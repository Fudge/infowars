[00:00.000 --> 00:18.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:18.600 --> 00:25.160]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot-com studios it's alex
[00:25.160 --> 00:34.000]  Jones Alex Jones show Owen shroyer and David Knight filling in and what will
[00:34.000 --> 00:41.400]  be a interesting beginning to this week it looks like now justice is moving
[00:41.400 --> 00:46.360]  against the left against Obama against Hillary Clinton and I think that all of
[00:46.360 --> 00:51.720]  the lies of the past that these people have promoted are starting to come back
[00:51.720 --> 00:56.160]  and bite them Donald Trump has gone on Twitter called Barack Obama an
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.600]  obstructionist of course he said that about the entire Democrat Party now
[01:00.600 --> 01:06.720]  you've got a Senate Department excuse me a State Department that is about to be
[01:06.720 --> 01:12.440]  probing again into Hillary Clinton's handling of her secret server that had
[01:12.440 --> 01:16.080]  classified emails on it Loretta Lynch is gonna have to testify soon she's gonna
[01:16.080 --> 01:20.840]  have to answer about that meeting that she had on the tarmac about why she
[01:20.840 --> 01:25.520]  decided to tell Comey to handle the Clinton investigation as a matter all of
[01:25.520 --> 01:30.640]  that is now coming to the front now at the same time the false narrative that
[01:30.640 --> 01:35.960]  Russia elected Donald Trump is coming crashing to a halt as well and let's not
[01:35.960 --> 01:40.640]  forget last week caught on video Russian NATO jets and near standoff after f-16
[01:40.640 --> 01:44.640]  buzzes defense ministers airplanes so you literally have Russia and the United
[01:44.640 --> 01:48.960]  States engaging in war games with one another and you have liars in the
[01:48.960 --> 01:52.760]  government that want to waste our time and money investigating into Russia
[01:52.760 --> 01:57.280]  Trump collusion now I want to ask David Knight a question because this is
[01:57.280 --> 02:01.200]  actually something David Knight and I have disagreed on not I don't even know
[02:01.200 --> 02:05.520]  if we've ever done it on air or even in a conversation just based on our coverage
[02:05.520 --> 02:09.440]  of Donald Trump and his tweets I know that David you have said you wish Donald
[02:09.440 --> 02:13.280]  Trump would tweet less you don't like the tweets I on the other hand have said
[02:13.280 --> 02:17.960]  I like the tweets and now though when we were talking before the show you were
[02:17.960 --> 02:22.120]  looking at the tweets saying wow he's calling out Obama it looks like he is
[02:22.120 --> 02:25.520]  kind of forcing the hand of the rest of the government to actually look at the
[02:25.520 --> 02:30.040]  collusion on the Democrat side of things meanwhile Bernie Sanders won't even
[02:30.040 --> 02:34.320]  mention the DNC fraud lawsuit that is being ongoing right now Donald Trump
[02:34.320 --> 02:38.000]  mentioned that the other day too so I'm just curious David do you still think
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.600]  Trump should tweet less you like Trump's tweets and do you think that his tweets
[02:41.600 --> 02:46.560]  today are indicating the way that the Justice Department is moving now they
[02:46.560 --> 02:50.160]  also have now said they'll instate the travel ban for 90 days so do you think
[02:50.160 --> 02:53.840]  now that Trump is trying to use his Twitter you know I think the government
[02:53.840 --> 02:57.640]  to do things I think that it's very important for Trump to be able to speak
[02:57.640 --> 03:01.140]  directly to the American people and he can do that very powerfully through
[03:01.140 --> 03:06.120]  Twitter but we all know that he's also it's a two-edged sword and he has done
[03:06.120 --> 03:10.000]  some self-inflicted damage as well with that so that's just what I've been
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.040]  saying what others have been saying the attacks that he did against the Deputy
[03:14.040 --> 03:17.520]  Attorney General Rosenstein last week I thought were non-productive counter
[03:17.520 --> 03:21.000]  productive to this but it's good that he's coming out and talking about what
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.800]  it truly is which is obstruction we've been saying this for a long time that
[03:24.800 --> 03:29.040]  there were multiple things behind this Russian narrative first of all they
[03:29.040 --> 03:32.720]  wanted to cover up the fact that they were hacking the election against Bernie
[03:32.720 --> 03:36.000]  Sanders they didn't want people to look at what had been revealed so they
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.360]  created this Russians hack the election narrative and then in addition to that
[03:40.360 --> 03:45.720]  they used it offensively against Donald Trump trying to tie up his
[03:45.720 --> 03:49.400]  administration trying to force some kind of a process crime and that's also my
[03:49.400 --> 03:53.720]  concern about his tweets that he might fall into that trap of a process crime
[03:53.720 --> 03:57.880]  in terms of his comments with that but we have to understand there's a third
[03:57.880 --> 04:02.200]  part of this the Democrats or the Obama administration was using the
[04:02.200 --> 04:07.280]  intelligence community as political operatives that's a key thing here this
[04:07.280 --> 04:10.960]  goes beyond simply collusion this is the fact that we have the massive
[04:10.960 --> 04:14.760]  intelligence community being used as political operatives and this is
[04:14.760 --> 04:18.520]  gradually beginning to come out Grassley Rand Paul others have pointed this out
[04:18.520 --> 04:23.960]  we've had the FISA court rule this that the NSA and the FBI under Comey broke
[04:23.960 --> 04:27.680]  the law violated the law and then declassified their ruling so that we
[04:27.680 --> 04:30.320]  could all see it but of course nobody's really paying much attention to it we've
[04:30.320 --> 04:33.720]  had circa talk about it it's been put up on the drudge report a couple of times
[04:33.720 --> 04:36.960]  so that's the other part of it they've been using it as defensive cover
[04:36.960 --> 04:42.480]  of their crimes which should send them to jail and then the CIA Washington post
[04:42.480 --> 04:46.760]  last Friday prints a 30-page article Obama's secret struggle to punish Russia
[04:46.760 --> 04:50.280]  for Putin's election result they try to force the Russian air to back out there
[04:50.280 --> 04:53.920]  like something exists it ends up biting them in the butt because Trump says
[04:53.920 --> 04:57.560]  wait a second Obama obstructed justice we'll be right back with a report from
[04:57.560 --> 05:04.800]  Alex Jones the struggle in the DNC fraud lawsuit continues you've had the
[05:04.800 --> 05:08.240]  current counsel for the plaintiffs request that the judge provide witness
[05:08.240 --> 05:12.640]  protection that notion was rejected despite three mysterious deaths of
[05:12.640 --> 05:17.160]  potential witnesses in the case Seth Rich Sean Lucas and Barrington Wison and
[05:17.160 --> 05:20.680]  junior there are also stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have
[05:20.680 --> 05:25.800]  this case dropped entirely despite the obvious glaring issues that the DNC has
[05:25.800 --> 05:29.080]  had over the course of the last two years while the lawsuit represents
[05:29.080 --> 05:33.560]  Bernie Sanders supporters who feel they have been wronged by the DNC Bernie
[05:33.560 --> 05:37.400]  Sanders has fallen silent on the issue Donald Trump tweeted out this weekend
[05:37.400 --> 05:40.280]  Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democrat Party in order to be crazy
[05:40.280 --> 05:44.800]  Bernie Sanders is she allowed to collude unfair to Bernie so now Donald Trump has
[05:44.800 --> 05:48.480]  done more to raise awareness for the DNC fraud lawsuit than Bernie Sanders has
[05:48.480 --> 05:52.200]  who actually is the one that had the election stolen from him why is Bernie
[05:52.200 --> 05:56.600]  Sanders silent on the issue maybe I guess he's busy with being investigated by
[05:56.600 --> 06:02.560]  the FBI for bank fraud for info wars.com this is Owen Schreuer the reason

[08:01.960 --> 08:20.080]  Live from the Infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[08:25.080 --> 08:28.960]  Donald Trump tweeted last night and this morning the tweets are up on info
[08:28.960 --> 08:33.240]  wars.com and everybody out there ought to be retweeting them and celebrating it
[08:33.240 --> 08:38.160]  because it shows that Trump is going on a major counter offensive against the
[08:38.160 --> 08:41.640]  globalist and the dirt bag Democrats and their leftist cohorts and the
[08:41.640 --> 08:50.160]  Islamist now if you go back about a year and a half ago we were about a year out
[08:50.160 --> 08:54.840]  from the election and there were news reports coming out confirming that
[08:54.840 --> 08:59.160]  Podesta and his brother and Hillary got 30 plus million dollars to transfer about
[08:59.160 --> 09:03.880]  25% of our uranium to Russia Hillary got caught meeting serial with Putin all
[09:03.880 --> 09:07.200]  this stuff was coming out Jay Johnson and Homeland Security even other
[09:07.200 --> 09:10.080]  Democrats at that level wanted to get in the computers to find what was
[09:10.080 --> 09:14.040]  happening and the Clintons everybody covered it up okay and she had her
[09:14.040 --> 09:18.760]  second server private server that she was selling data on the world market
[09:18.760 --> 09:21.960]  for letting people penetrate it in exchange for money to her foundation
[09:21.960 --> 09:26.920]  billions and billions so this was a legion of doom level Lex Luthor crime
[09:26.920 --> 09:31.040]  going on and so they were scared what were they gonna do well just covered it
[09:31.040 --> 09:35.760]  up but then once Trump won they had to go ahead and panic and say oh my god
[09:35.760 --> 09:39.760]  Trump's the Russian agent because they knew that Homeland Security was already
[09:39.760 --> 09:43.120]  aware of this and and Jay Johnson already testified last week but what's
[09:43.120 --> 09:47.520]  amazing is if you go back over a year ago when I was interviewing Roger Stone
[09:47.520 --> 09:50.820]  and Colonel Schaefer and so many other experts that have really you know high
[09:50.820 --> 09:55.240]  level connections they were continuing to break down the fact but so was even
[09:55.240 --> 09:59.720]  mainstream news this is all been in the news that it was the Democrats that had
[09:59.720 --> 10:03.320]  all these connections were trying to distract off onto the narrative claiming
[10:03.320 --> 10:07.680]  Trump was but again that all accelerated and got ten times worse once Trump won
[10:07.680 --> 10:11.000]  and that's why they've been so desperate why they've been like cornered rats
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.160]  well now with Jay Johnson's testimony last week former at Homeland Security and
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.240]  with all the other testimonies that are coming out we know that Obama this is
[10:19.240 --> 10:23.880]  confirmed they've admitted it ordered them to not investigate now the argument
[10:23.880 --> 10:28.560]  is he's the president and under a unitary executive he could do that well
[10:28.560 --> 10:31.800]  there's a unitary executive unless it's with a foreign power and selling out
[10:31.800 --> 10:35.720]  US interest and then that's an issue for Congress to decide and it's clear cut
[10:35.720 --> 10:39.960]  treason especially when Obama has a track record of selling us out to
[10:39.960 --> 10:43.600]  multinationals selling us out to foreign governments namely communist China
[10:43.600 --> 10:47.600]  Russia is a third level player they can barely stabilize their own country
[10:47.600 --> 10:51.960]  that's why it has been a red herring the whole time it's just that that's where
[10:51.960 --> 10:56.000]  the dirt is on the Democrats is China and Russia so that's why they've been
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.480]  again claiming they own the narrative of claiming everybody else is a Russian
[10:59.480 --> 11:04.760]  agent but them the fact that Trump has brought all this evidence out the fact
[11:04.760 --> 11:08.120]  that even mainstream media is admitting it the fact that CNN has had to retract a
[11:08.120 --> 11:11.840]  bunch of stories and then that they were fake news about Roger Stone scare
[11:11.840 --> 11:16.000]  emoji and others inside the Trump administration shows they're beginning to
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.880]  run scared and now with these tweets from Trump saying Obama wasn't scared he
[11:21.880 --> 11:25.680]  didn't choke he was obstructing because he knew the Russians were actually
[11:25.680 --> 11:31.240]  helping now I was told by some of our not just White House sources but CIA
[11:31.240 --> 11:36.320]  sources all about six months ago that the Russians actually had penetrated the
[11:36.320 --> 11:39.880]  Democrats as they historically have and we're actually to a great extent actually
[11:39.880 --> 11:43.280]  hedging their bets thinking Hillary would win and we're actually backing
[11:43.280 --> 11:47.920]  Hillary I kind of rolled my eyes at that and Dr. Corsi wrote articles about it we
[11:47.920 --> 11:52.040]  got a lot of heat from folks that think Russia can do no wrong but again this is
[11:52.040 --> 11:55.240]  what big governments do I'm not blaming Russia for anything but doing their
[11:55.240 --> 12:00.240]  normal national security outreach our own government does that as well but
[12:00.240 --> 12:04.400]  under globalism we do that for foreign multinational corporations at the
[12:04.400 --> 12:08.400]  expense of America what Trump's doing with his carbon tax killing operation
[12:08.400 --> 12:13.440]  pulling us out of the Paris deal what Trump's doing pulling us out of the TPP
[12:13.440 --> 12:18.360]  bringing the jobs back boosting the stock market is bringing back normal
[12:18.360 --> 12:22.760]  nationalism that a chief executive engages in for their country that's what
[12:22.760 --> 12:29.040]  third-world nations do is sell out their countrymen for 30 pieces of silver
[12:29.040 --> 12:32.160]  instead of building up a nation they actually live in that they actually
[12:32.160 --> 12:37.120]  care about that they actually believe in so that's just some of the backstory you
[12:37.120 --> 12:40.560]  all remember it we're going to do reports on it tonight on the news we're
[12:40.560 --> 12:43.880]  going to do a more focused report with all the documentation for the radio
[12:43.880 --> 12:49.760]  show tomorrow as well but this is such a big deal to have Trump boldly come out
[12:49.760 --> 12:54.720]  and say Obama committed crimes he obstructed when we already have the
[12:54.720 --> 12:59.600]  proof Jay Johnson saying he was told to drop it and do nothing that's why you
[12:59.600 --> 13:03.400]  see in that letter last week that we made such a big deal of Diane Feinstein
[13:03.400 --> 13:07.840]  saying yeah we need a criminal investigation of Loretta Lynch she's
[13:07.840 --> 13:13.320]  one of the top Democrats and she seemed so scared and so reclusive lately not
[13:13.320 --> 13:16.840]  out running her mouth against Trump and others shows that the amount of crimes
[13:16.840 --> 13:21.200]  committed by the arrogant crazy globalist Democrats and the Republican
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.560]  leadership like John McCain who just got fingered major publications for also
[13:25.560 --> 13:29.920]  taking Russian money the fact is this whole house of cards is starting to come
[13:29.920 --> 13:33.400]  down and this is an incredible victory everybody knows I'm not gonna tell you
[13:33.400 --> 13:37.120]  we're having victories if we aren't you can see it for yourself and I hate to
[13:37.120 --> 13:40.120]  be a cheerleader here because they could set off a new can DC they could
[13:40.120 --> 13:43.680]  activate any fun black lives matter to start burning down cities and shooting
[13:43.680 --> 13:47.560]  cops in every town you know but at the same time as long as we recognize that
[13:47.560 --> 13:51.120]  they're the enemy they're the scum they're the trash then it's clear why
[13:51.120 --> 13:54.720]  they're fighting for their lives call everybody a racist running around trying
[13:54.720 --> 13:58.360]  to hijack the economy and running the ground running around saying kill Trump
[13:58.360 --> 14:02.680]  kill me kill everybody else is because they're a bunch of trash that was
[14:02.680 --> 14:06.200]  inches away from bringing this country down once and for all but now it's all
[14:06.200 --> 14:10.520]  been jerked away from the scum and that's why again they've intensified their
[14:10.520 --> 14:14.080]  efforts saying Trump's failing I'm failing you're failing destroy everybody
[14:14.080 --> 14:18.640]  sue everybody is because we are kicking their ass so let's thank God for this
[14:18.640 --> 14:22.800]  let's thank our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for this and all your prayers I
[14:22.800 --> 14:26.280]  want to thank you out there for your prayers and intensify your prayers but
[14:26.280 --> 14:30.640]  also be watchful on the street spread the word and support info wars and spread
[14:30.640 --> 14:34.000]  our articles and videos like you never had before they've put all their
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.520]  foreign intel all their bots all their Facebook all their Googles all their
[14:38.520 --> 14:42.600]  Twitters all their Amazons with all their giant AI systems against the
[14:42.600 --> 14:46.400]  Liberty Movement to fill all of our Twitter feeds full of hate and that
[14:46.400 --> 14:49.760]  we're failing and that we're dead and that we're garbage and to fill our Google
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.000]  feeds with that and to fill our email with that and to fill the TV with that
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.000]  and to fill the newspaper with that that is so wonderful to get up every day and
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.120]  see hundreds of articles sometimes thousands saying I'm scum and I'm
[15:00.120 --> 15:04.440]  filth and I'm trash because that's the enemy saying that like Tokyo rose in
[15:04.440 --> 15:09.920]  World War two while her whole system is burning down around her ass so again
[15:09.920 --> 15:13.280]  this is an incredible time to be alive we are crushing them we are defeating
[15:13.280 --> 15:18.080]  them we're restoring prosperity the colleges are imploding where were these
[15:18.080 --> 15:22.280]  social justice warriors run things on every front these failing scum that
[15:22.280 --> 15:25.920]  wanted to take us down to their level are are just disintegrating because of
[15:25.920 --> 15:31.280]  your action but now is the time to press the attack at every level 24 7 because
[15:31.280 --> 15:35.000]  we are so close we're going to crush their Islamic invasion we're going to
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.520]  crush their communist brainwashing we're going to crush the antifa all of it
[15:38.520 --> 15:41.720]  intellectually we're going to shut our borders down to all the failed states
[15:41.720 --> 15:45.400]  we're going to restore the United States of America and then dictate peace
[15:45.400 --> 15:49.760]  through strength info wars dot com is the sort of truth you know it is that's
[15:49.760 --> 15:53.320]  why they hate us we don't compromise we don't back down and we can literally
[15:53.320 --> 15:57.440]  taste the victory it's in our guts it's in our hearts it's in our blood so keep
[15:57.440 --> 16:00.640]  spreading the word I want to salute you all want to salute the crew now back to
[16:00.640 --> 16:04.800]  David Knight no and shroyer but the main focus is we're on the march they're on
[16:04.800 --> 16:08.160]  the run and Trump is pressing the attack he is calling it out as the
[16:08.160 --> 16:12.960]  criminals they are and so get ready they bit off more than they can chew they
[16:12.960 --> 16:16.000]  absolutely push people to the breaking point they were given a chance to back
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.520]  down and just let America be great again but they did so now they're going to get
[16:20.520 --> 16:25.720]  something else now they're going to get the oblivion that they so begged for now
[16:25.720 --> 16:30.640]  what they hope to do to us is about to happen to them it's like the old
[16:30.640 --> 16:35.360]  nursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty and you couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together
[16:35.360 --> 16:38.880]  again I think that that's the point that they have reached right now with
[16:38.880 --> 16:43.720]  Obama McCain Loretta Lynch Hillary Clinton and it's only a matter of time
[16:43.720 --> 16:48.680]  before everyone in America I think is seeking justice now it's becoming more
[16:48.680 --> 16:53.560]  popular but that's the threat David is we know that these people have
[16:53.560 --> 16:56.720]  capabilities we know what they've done in the past we know that they don't care
[16:56.720 --> 17:00.440]  much for humanity they wouldn't mind if half of the earth was just wiped dry of
[17:00.440 --> 17:04.920]  humanity and then they are seriously I think facing some justice right now for
[17:04.920 --> 17:08.320]  their crimes we'll see how far it gets pushed how far they want to push back but
[17:08.320 --> 17:12.040]  I don't know about how this is melting down for them too because we had CNN come
[17:12.040 --> 17:19.720]  out we had yesterday Stelter CNN is asking Jeff Zucker and others to comment
[17:19.720 --> 17:24.640]  on the Russian retraction story and they're not they're stonewalling their
[17:24.640 --> 17:30.120]  own reporter so we have a situation here where CNN is calling CNN fake news it's
[17:30.120 --> 17:33.840]  gotten that bad and we've got the Democrats saying hey leaders let's not
[17:33.840 --> 17:38.120]  talk about Russia anymore okay people realize that we're totally out of touch
[17:38.120 --> 17:41.920]  with their concerns on a day-to-day basis they said they're trying to figure
[17:41.920 --> 17:43.920]  out how they're gonna make mortgage payments how they're gonna pay for
[17:43.920 --> 17:47.240]  their kids go to college what their energy will bill will look like and of
[17:47.240 --> 17:50.440]  course the Democrats have done everything they can to try to make sure
[17:50.440 --> 17:54.480]  that our energy bills are higher and higher so they are absolutely out of it
[17:54.480 --> 17:58.800]  out of touch with our concerns they're adamantly diametrically opposed to the
[17:58.800 --> 18:02.720]  things that they just listed here all they want to do is use Russia as a
[18:02.720 --> 18:06.760]  political weapon and what is imploding on them now is this Russian narrative
[18:06.760 --> 18:10.000]  they have jumped the shark CNN has jumped the shark they're now imposing
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.920]  strict new rules on coverage about Russia so CNN is saying let's not talk
[18:14.920 --> 18:19.520]  any more about Russia unless you clear this with a CNN vice president this is
[18:19.520 --> 18:23.720]  the email memo that went out on Saturday they retracted the story
[18:23.720 --> 18:30.480]  Stelter cannot get the Zooker to comment on his fake news story here and also the
[18:30.480 --> 18:33.920]  Democrats are coming back and say hey let's not talk about this now they're
[18:33.920 --> 18:38.160]  trying to shut it up it's too late because as Trump has pointed out we've
[18:38.160 --> 18:43.840]  learned from the revelations of James Comey very clearly that there was
[18:43.840 --> 18:47.240]  obstruction of justice going on it's been very clear that that was the case
[18:47.240 --> 18:50.240]  when he said that Hillary Clinton had violated all these laws and he wasn't
[18:50.240 --> 18:54.240]  going to prosecute her that was obstruction of justice folks it's not
[18:54.240 --> 18:58.640]  just that favorative you know doing a favor for somebody because they're
[18:58.640 --> 19:02.200]  politically connected that was obstruction of justice he should have
[19:02.200 --> 19:06.680]  been removed for that cause alone and yet they continue to go with this they
[19:06.680 --> 19:10.360]  have continued to try to obstruct what they did they were the ones who are
[19:10.360 --> 19:13.040]  hacking the election against Bernie Sanders and they created this false
[19:13.040 --> 19:19.280]  Russian narrative this information was not given to WikiLeaks by a state actor
[19:19.280 --> 19:22.720]  they've said that over and over again they have credibility the DNC does not
[19:22.720 --> 19:27.120]  the FBI director does not have credibility on this Julian Assange and
[19:27.120 --> 19:31.800]  WikiLeaks does they have said all along that this is not a state actor that
[19:31.800 --> 19:34.760]  this was handed over to them by people who were upset about what they were
[19:34.760 --> 19:38.520]  doing within the DNC so they've used this to distract people from what's
[19:38.520 --> 19:40.960]  going on and now this has started to come down around their heads well and
[19:40.960 --> 19:43.680]  they've cornered them they've cornered themselves too because they spent all of
[19:43.680 --> 19:47.800]  this time money and energy on the Russia investigation found nothing on Trump are
[19:47.800 --> 19:51.120]  they just gonna shut it down now and just prove that it was a witch hunt into
[19:51.120 --> 19:53.720]  Trump are they actually gonna look into Obama are they actually gonna look into
[19:53.720 --> 19:56.680]  Podesta actually look into Clinton we'll find out we'll be right back on the

[24:23.920 --> 24:29.000]  with you and we've got a lot of news to cover but Joyce Riley has passed away and
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.680]  David you wanted to address this situation before we moved on to anything
[24:31.680 --> 24:36.000]  else yeah we're sad to see that happen we are sympathies go out to her family
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.080]  you know she did very important work for promoting Americana her work with
[24:41.080 --> 24:44.720]  veterans she was a nurse and a veteran herself so she did a lot with veterans on
[24:44.720 --> 24:49.320]  health issues and that work is going to go on but she was really a very nice
[24:49.320 --> 24:52.840]  person I went on her show once and and caused her no end of grief with a bad
[24:52.840 --> 24:58.720]  phone connection she was very gracious about that but she has been followed by
[24:58.720 --> 25:01.760]  quite a few people and I'm sure that work is going on so we really do
[25:01.760 --> 25:05.120]  appreciate the important work that she did in her lifetime and our condolences
[25:05.120 --> 25:09.280]  go out to her family Joyce Riley passed away yesterday with a long struggle with
[25:09.280 --> 25:12.880]  cancer and I'm sure that all the feminists will celebrate the great
[25:12.880 --> 25:17.040]  woman that Joyce Riley was oh wait no I doubt that because she was a patriot and
[25:17.040 --> 25:22.400]  Americana so we celebrate the life of Joyce Riley a true American patriot
[25:22.400 --> 25:30.240]  sadness sadness and grieving today with her passing now I want to get to some
[25:30.240 --> 25:35.280]  legal stuff that President Trump has been dealing with the GOP is about to
[25:35.280 --> 25:38.720]  release their health care bill today their sets release it right in the face
[25:38.720 --> 25:41.920]  of the Democrats who are screaming and whining about how they won't release it
[25:41.920 --> 25:46.240]  which is exactly what the Democrats did for Obamacare so do as I say not as I
[25:46.240 --> 25:51.240]  do but more importantly I want to talk about the travel ban and now it is going
[25:51.240 --> 25:56.680]  to reach the Supreme Court they have done a temporary reinstatement and I
[25:56.680 --> 26:01.000]  just want to this is how they're phrasing it now it's going to the Senate
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.240]  to declare whether it's legal or not to declare whether President Trump has the
[26:05.240 --> 26:09.280]  legal authority to instate this travel ban which undoubtedly he does it that's
[26:09.280 --> 26:12.880]  that's not even up for debate in court yeah and so but this is how they're
[26:12.880 --> 26:16.760]  painting it David they say the Supreme Court is a limited version of the Trump
[26:16.760 --> 26:20.320]  administration is letting a limited version of the Trump administration ban
[26:20.320 --> 26:25.040]  on travel from six mostly Muslim countries or you could say where Obama
[26:25.040 --> 26:28.800]  bombed for eight years to take effect a victory for President Trump in the
[26:28.800 --> 26:33.160]  biggest legal controversy of his young presidency it's not a legal controversy
[26:33.160 --> 26:36.960]  anybody who knows the law knows that he is well within his boundaries has been
[26:36.960 --> 26:41.280]  done many times throughout presidential history so they're trying to spin this and
[26:41.280 --> 26:45.960]  pretend like it's being looked at that Donald Trump is breaking the law David
[26:45.960 --> 26:48.200]  do you see how they're trying to spin this narrative they're trying to steal it
[26:48.200 --> 26:51.840]  well these are lower courts that have put these obstacles in the way and they're
[26:51.840 --> 26:55.480]  the ones that broke the law yeah what they're doing is they're reading things
[26:55.480 --> 27:00.520]  like intent into it which it's not there basically if you judge it based on what
[27:00.520 --> 27:04.400]  the law says there is nothing that they should be able to take exception to and
[27:04.400 --> 27:09.480]  of course statutory law clearly gives Donald Trump and the administration the
[27:09.480 --> 27:12.840]  ability to decide who is going to come into the country and so forth I think
[27:12.840 --> 27:15.720]  it's interesting that we have California doing a travel ban
[27:15.720 --> 27:21.640]  California is banning travel to America imagine that they're saying that people
[27:21.640 --> 27:24.680]  who work for the government of California cannot travel to the real
[27:24.680 --> 27:29.280]  America they have now included this and extended this to eight states including
[27:29.280 --> 27:32.640]  Texas are now on the list and Governor Abbott said California may be able to
[27:32.640 --> 27:36.200]  stop their state employees but they can't stop all the businesses that are
[27:36.200 --> 27:40.920]  fleeing over their taxation their regulation and are relocating to Texas
[27:40.920 --> 27:45.320]  and elsewhere and then Tennessee came back with a scathing resolution it's a
[27:45.320 --> 27:48.520]  very long resolution among other things they said whereas this type of ban the
[27:48.520 --> 27:52.160]  result of legitimate disagreement about government policies neither persuasive
[27:52.160 --> 27:56.240]  nor productive for either party and will lead to economic warfare among states as
[27:56.240 --> 28:00.440]  one sovereign entity attempts to tell an equally sovereign entity how to conduct
[28:00.440 --> 28:04.400]  their affairs by restricting travel and whereas the US Constitution provides
[28:04.400 --> 28:07.840]  for a strong federal government for a common defense but the 10th amendment
[28:07.840 --> 28:11.480]  grants set the several states sovereignty and addressing issues solely within
[28:11.480 --> 28:15.800]  their jurisdiction so forth and so on they go down here be it further resolved
[28:15.800 --> 28:20.960]  that we urge the other 48 states to refrain from imposing their unfounded
[28:20.960 --> 28:25.640]  moral judgment on their sister states as California has done in order to prevent
[28:25.640 --> 28:30.920]  escalating foolishness and that's them down pretty good honestly if you look
[28:30.920 --> 28:34.800]  at the House and the Senate most of the swamp resides in California I mean it
[28:34.800 --> 28:38.360]  really does Maxine Waters Nancy Pelosi Diane Feinstein Eric Swalwell the list
[28:38.360 --> 28:41.520]  goes on and on and on and these people have been in government for way too long
[28:41.520 --> 28:45.920]  and but you know getting back to this getting back to this travel ban that's
[28:45.920 --> 28:49.560]  being reviewed by the and actually it's not so much a travel ban as it is the
[28:49.560 --> 28:55.880]  attempts of lower court district judges to try to stop and assert themselves over
[28:55.880 --> 29:01.600]  the president's rightful powers here what they said was that they're not going
[29:01.600 --> 29:05.280]  to put any restrictions people can be stopped if they do not have any
[29:05.280 --> 29:07.680]  connection in the United States it's just a given that they're not going to
[29:07.680 --> 29:12.520]  come here and as you pointed out oh and these are countries that Obama had been
[29:12.520 --> 29:16.280]  bombing had been going to war with and that's not even all of them and later in
[29:16.280 --> 29:21.560]  the program we're going to be talking to Michael Springman this is a individual
[29:21.560 --> 29:26.120]  who blew the whistle on visas for al-Qaeda and he's talking about goodbye Europe
[29:26.120 --> 29:29.440]  hello chaos and of course that's the key part of what he's talking about how we
[29:29.440 --> 29:33.440]  start the wars in the other countries so that they can then have a massive
[29:33.440 --> 29:37.120]  relocation and replacement of populations coming into this country
[29:37.120 --> 29:41.360]  that's what's truly behind this absolutely and everything it's true
[29:41.360 --> 29:45.320]  everything that the Democrats did and they claim that Trump did they're
[29:45.320 --> 29:50.560]  guilty of rigging elections breaking the law that's on the Democrats we're on
[29:50.560 --> 29:58.600]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:00.840 --> 30:05.240]  the struggle in the DNC fraud lawsuit continues you've had the current
[30:05.240 --> 30:08.960]  counsel for the plaintiffs request that the judge provide witness protection
[30:08.960 --> 30:13.760]  that notion was rejected despite three mysterious deaths of potential witnesses
[30:13.760 --> 30:18.280]  in the case Seth Rich Sean Lucas and Barrington Wison Ant Jr. there are also
[30:18.280 --> 30:21.640]  stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have this case dropped
[30:21.640 --> 30:26.560]  entirely despite the obvious glaring issues that the DNC has had over the
[30:26.560 --> 30:29.880]  course of the last two years while the lawsuit represents Bernie Sanders
[30:29.880 --> 30:34.440]  supporters who feel they have been wronged by the DNC Bernie Sanders has
[30:34.440 --> 30:37.960]  fallen silent on the issue Donald Trump tweeted out this weekend Hillary
[30:37.960 --> 30:41.400]  Clinton colluded with the Democrat Party in order to be crazy Bernie Sanders is
[30:41.400 --> 30:45.400]  she allowed to collude unfair to Bernie so now Donald Trump has done more to
[30:45.400 --> 30:49.040]  raise awareness for the DNC fraud lawsuit than Bernie Sanders has who
[30:49.040 --> 30:52.360]  actually is the one that had the election stolen from him why is Bernie
[30:52.360 --> 30:56.720]  Sanders silent on the issue maybe I guess he's busy with being investigated by
[30:56.720 --> 31:01.880]  the FBI for bank fraud for info wars.com this is Owen shroyer it's not just our

[35:15.600 --> 35:19.480]  failing miserably all of their narratives are falling in on themselves
[35:19.480 --> 35:23.560]  that it's the right that's going to cause violence it was Russia that was
[35:23.560 --> 35:27.800]  hacking in the election Trump was obstructing justice no that was Obama
[35:27.800 --> 35:30.920]  that was the left that's violent that was the Democrats that were breaking the
[35:30.920 --> 35:37.120]  law and Eric Trump went on Fox News and called out the left for what they've been
[35:37.120 --> 35:41.760]  doing including their violent calls for assassination
[35:42.720 --> 35:46.760]  if you look at the Democratic Party I keep saying it they're imploding they've
[35:46.760 --> 35:50.100]  got no leadership they've got no message if you look at the demo you know the
[35:50.100 --> 35:54.960]  DNC the DNC is half defunct they've got no money in the bank they have no
[35:54.960 --> 35:59.040]  operation look at the head of the DNC he's quite frankly a nut job that he
[35:59.040 --> 36:02.640]  walks from insults another nut job Democrats message right now I mean what
[36:02.640 --> 36:06.520]  are they running on all they're doing is is obstructing and it's clearly not
[36:06.520 --> 36:09.480]  working because every race that comes along every special election that comes
[36:09.480 --> 36:12.360]  along my father is winning and my father's out there saying I want to take
[36:12.360 --> 36:16.080]  care of the military I want to take care of vets I want to take care of health
[36:16.080 --> 36:20.440]  care and taxes and you know we want to bring back America and it's his message
[36:20.440 --> 36:24.760]  very simple make America great again and politicians have really run this
[36:24.760 --> 36:28.840]  country into the ground how is it possible for rushing that they're getting
[36:28.840 --> 36:32.720]  away with this Eric that they are obstructing and not listening to what
[36:32.720 --> 36:36.800]  the tone of the people is and what the tone of the people voted for last year
[36:36.800 --> 36:40.800]  they voted for tax reform they voted for health care repeal and replace your
[36:40.800 --> 36:45.280]  father's agenda so because they're out of touch they're out of touch half of
[36:45.280 --> 36:48.280]  them have never had real jobs before half of them have been sitting on a hill
[36:48.280 --> 36:53.400]  legislating for many years when they've never you know actually done before you
[36:53.400 --> 36:58.120]  know I mean my father is a practical guy my father is a doer you know he's he's
[36:58.120 --> 37:02.480]  a brilliant brilliant person but we need to bring some practicality back to the
[37:02.480 --> 37:06.680]  United States government but look what this has led to these celebrities out
[37:06.680 --> 37:11.600]  there that think it's okay for Kathy Griffin to hold be holding a bloody head
[37:11.600 --> 37:15.960]  there and and then you've got people like Robert De Niro saying I want to
[37:15.960 --> 37:21.280]  punch him in the face then of course the most recent you've got basically saying
[37:21.280 --> 37:25.760]  I want to assassinate the president Johnny Depp how do you deal with that I
[37:25.760 --> 37:29.960]  mean as a family when you hear this stuff at this point does it roll off your
[37:29.960 --> 37:34.320]  back or do you still get upset it has to roll up yeah it has to roll off your
[37:34.320 --> 37:37.880]  back I mean I have a pregnant wife she's seven months pregnant if you saw some
[37:37.880 --> 37:42.040]  of the the comments that she receives from people I mean I couldn't even say
[37:42.040 --> 37:45.800]  them honestly on the air because they're so ghastly but they're willing to
[37:45.800 --> 37:49.240]  attack a pregnant lady somebody who's seven months pregnant they're willing to
[37:49.240 --> 37:53.080]  attack a 11 year old boy meaning you know my brother Barron who's in the
[37:53.080 --> 37:56.680]  White House and at you know a fragile age if they're willing to go after my
[37:56.680 --> 38:01.400]  passive sister Tiffany 22 years old who's going to law school I mean there
[38:01.400 --> 38:04.560]  is no borders for these people I mean listen we're fair game fine you know
[38:04.560 --> 38:08.480]  where we're adults but I mean there are no borders for these people and you see
[38:08.480 --> 38:11.960]  Johnny Depp and what he said you know I'd like to go assassinate you know the
[38:11.960 --> 38:15.280]  president it's like Johnny Depp has his own problems see he has his own problems
[38:15.280 --> 38:18.240]  like how about you go back to making movies and doing your own thing I mean
[38:18.240 --> 38:23.320]  this is a man who gave up his life to try and help this country and he's doing a
[38:23.320 --> 38:27.040]  great great job and honestly I couldn't be more proud of Donald Trump's family
[38:27.040 --> 38:30.600]  represents him really well and but you know Eric Trump said something that I
[38:30.600 --> 38:36.760]  almost I almost lost my seat over practicality in the US government are
[38:36.760 --> 38:39.280]  you kidding they don't see themselves they don't see themselves as
[38:39.280 --> 38:42.960]  representing the American people that's the fundamental disconnect I think
[38:42.960 --> 38:46.240]  because Eric is is new to Washington it doesn't realize that these people
[38:46.240 --> 38:51.480]  represent themselves and the people who buy them and they could care couldn't
[38:51.480 --> 38:55.720]  care less about what the American people want so they're obstructing an agenda
[38:55.720 --> 38:59.480]  that could make life better for Americans and same time they're
[38:59.480 --> 39:02.160]  obstructing justice and that's the key thing that Donald Trump was talking
[39:02.160 --> 39:04.960]  about earlier today but we had this article come out the actor who played
[39:04.960 --> 39:09.960]  Brutus in Julius Caesar double down just in case you thought this is simply
[39:09.960 --> 39:13.560]  about the play okay he said the actor who played Brutus in the controversial
[39:13.560 --> 39:17.880]  production Julius Caesar has depicted Trump's assassination said each
[39:17.880 --> 39:22.880]  performance was an act of resistance make sure that you understand what that
[39:22.880 --> 39:27.880]  truly means okay when they get out there in a feeding frenzy and start screaming
[39:27.880 --> 39:34.520]  wildly and applauding as they see this surrogate for Trump being assassinated
[39:34.520 --> 39:38.280]  being knifed as they show the pictures of his head being cut off by Kathy Griffin
[39:38.280 --> 39:42.640]  we know precisely what they're doing this is they're getting off on this at a
[39:42.640 --> 39:47.520]  visceral level and we know precisely what they are modeling for other people
[39:47.520 --> 39:51.000]  they're disturbed individuals other hoping will take up take them up on this
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.160]  and when you talk about this being Julius Caesar's I said before they're
[39:55.160 --> 40:01.080]  using the bard as a beard you know this had yes the general storylines of Julius
[40:01.080 --> 40:06.360]  Caesar but beyond putting it in a contemporary milieu they also had
[40:06.360 --> 40:11.040]  things like Twitter they had Melania there obviously speaking in a salinian
[40:11.040 --> 40:15.520]  accent and so forth as least ran a hand said that they should have just called
[40:15.520 --> 40:20.680]  it orange Julius you know because it only has a twist of Shakespeare in it but
[40:20.680 --> 40:26.360]  it truly was them acting out their perverse fantasies and they continue to
[40:26.360 --> 40:31.200]  do that and that's where I think the the difference is I mean as I've said
[40:31.200 --> 40:35.160]  before you know when we talk about what we we have freedom of speech and where
[40:35.160 --> 40:37.480]  we draw the line and of course they're gonna be talking about that with the
[40:37.480 --> 40:41.720]  Supreme Court in terms of the gay bakeries and you know where the night you
[40:41.720 --> 40:46.560]  can be forced somebody to bake a gay wedding cake that's one of the cases
[40:46.560 --> 40:49.600]  that are gonna be considered by the Supreme Court when you look at rights
[40:49.600 --> 40:55.400]  in conflict like this and you look at free speech and conflict in my opinion
[40:55.400 --> 41:00.320]  this is and a kind of incitement like if you were to yell fire in a crowded
[41:00.320 --> 41:04.040]  theater when there is no fire and what they're doing is they're inciting
[41:04.040 --> 41:07.600]  hatred in the audience there and obviously you can see that I mean this is
[41:07.600 --> 41:12.280]  this is like 1984 where they got the two minutes of hate and they're inciting
[41:12.280 --> 41:17.160]  that and and what they're essentially saying is fire at that guy that I don't
[41:17.160 --> 41:22.520]  like fire at him and to me that is not legitimate use of free speech even in a
[41:22.520 --> 41:28.520]  theatrical area like this because yeah we've we've seen a lot of violence in
[41:28.520 --> 41:33.160]  Hollywood but this is targeted towards people and we've seen the result of this
[41:33.160 --> 41:37.120]  with us police shooting and others well there's absolutely zero excuse for
[41:37.120 --> 41:40.000]  calling for the assassination of Trump there should be zero excuse for that I
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.120]  think those people need to be investigated immediately but as far as
[41:43.120 --> 41:47.360]  you know the play is concerned you know what maybe maybe if this was an
[41:47.360 --> 41:51.560]  isolated incident maybe if this was the only play the only propaganda against
[41:51.560 --> 41:54.480]  Trump okay maybe we would turn the other cheek maybe wouldn't make a big deal of
[41:54.480 --> 41:58.160]  it but it's the group collective it's all of it you have the actor going off
[41:58.160 --> 42:02.200]  the stage saying this is about a resistance oh who tried to steal that
[42:02.200 --> 42:06.400]  phrase from the real resistance which was here started right here oh yeah
[42:06.400 --> 42:09.840]  Hillary Clinton super PAC the resistance more money to the Democrats taking
[42:09.840 --> 42:14.560]  from the poor giving to the rich oh yeah that's right that was a Shia LaBeouf
[42:14.560 --> 42:18.800]  saying he will not divide us when he was the one that was dividing us oh yeah
[42:18.800 --> 42:21.840]  that's right that's the Democrats crying resistance resistance all of a sudden
[42:21.840 --> 42:26.680]  that they're losing and you made a key point there David when liberals and
[42:26.680 --> 42:32.200]  anti-trumpers or whoever it is celebrate Trump quote unquote losing like for
[42:32.200 --> 42:36.480]  example with the travel ban they are celebrating America losing yeah that is
[42:36.480 --> 42:42.360]  their hatred of America showing and I don't even know if they understand it I
[42:42.360 --> 42:46.120]  don't know if they consciously understand it if they can admit it I mean
[42:46.120 --> 42:48.120]  they don't want to admit that they're never going to come out and just say oh
[42:48.120 --> 42:51.120]  I hate America because then they look like the scum they are but that's what
[42:51.120 --> 42:54.640]  they do well you know you had that person the Democrat Party say hey we
[42:54.640 --> 42:57.960]  got to get off of this Russian thing we're out of touch with America we need
[42:57.960 --> 43:01.640]  to get behind the issues that they're concerned about a cost of energy cost of
[43:01.640 --> 43:05.960]  mortgages cost of college education and so forth and yet everything they have
[43:05.960 --> 43:11.720]  done has made all of those things more expensive especially energy and so they
[43:11.720 --> 43:17.440]  are at odds with all of those issues besides not just being in you know in
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.120]  touch with our concerns the idea that we have those problems we have those
[43:21.120 --> 43:24.800]  issues we are concerned about how we're going to defend ourselves in a situation
[43:24.800 --> 43:28.000]  that is increasingly violent and of course it's always in the areas that are
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.000]  controlled by Democrats where they have gun control laws that we see the vast
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.480]  majority of the shootings taking place so yes we have these concerns that they
[43:36.480 --> 43:40.480]  do not share because they live in this privileged little bubble that they have
[43:40.480 --> 43:44.800]  going here so I don't think that they're going to be able to pull this around but
[43:44.800 --> 43:48.880]  I think it's very important now that Donald Trump is calling them out on the
[43:48.880 --> 43:54.480]  other kind of obstruction which is legal obstruction. Hillary Clinton was not
[43:54.480 --> 43:59.280]  found innocent she was not exonerated they merely let that go and said well I
[43:59.280 --> 44:02.760]  don't think we're going to prosecute her on this but she still has that legal
[44:02.760 --> 44:08.640]  liability there. And they're all involved Lynch, Comey, Clinton, Obama they're all
[44:08.640 --> 44:13.200]  involved in this mess. Cheryl Mills I mean the list goes on and on and on but
[44:13.200 --> 44:16.880]  I want to get back to this for a second you got Robert Rees, Hillary Clinton I
[44:16.880 --> 44:20.400]  mean all these people calling for the resistance all these people pointing to
[44:20.400 --> 44:24.720]  President Trump getting assassinated trying to inject that into our our lifestyle
[44:24.720 --> 44:29.080]  trying to inject that into our subconscious but then on the other end if
[44:29.080 --> 44:34.840]  Trump says something about a travel ban or if a conservative talk show host says
[44:34.840 --> 44:39.440]  something about radical Islamic terror they want to blame us for every terror
[44:39.440 --> 44:42.400]  attack they want to blame us for all the violence saying we're inciting violence
[44:42.400 --> 44:46.560]  we're the Islamophobes how dare Trump say that he's gonna cause radical
[44:46.560 --> 44:51.080]  Islamic terror but here they are trying to incite violence in this country and
[44:51.080 --> 44:54.280]  start terrorists and start assassinations why don't they get held to it why
[44:54.280 --> 44:57.960]  doesn't Robert Rees get held to the comments that he makes about the
[44:57.960 --> 45:01.120]  resistance and then all this violence happens but this is less than a month
[45:01.120 --> 45:05.280]  after Steve's police get shot and they're out here doing it again. Why is it racism
[45:05.280 --> 45:08.320]  when we say that we're not going to allow people in from countries that we're at
[45:08.320 --> 45:12.040]  war with when it wasn't racism when Obama dropped bombs on them. He's a Nobel
[45:12.040 --> 45:15.960]  Peace Prize winner. Yeah exactly. If I beat you to death if I beat you to death
[45:15.960 --> 45:18.280]  right now but I have a Nobel Peace Prize it's perfectly fine.
[45:18.280 --> 45:22.640]  Well in his last year he dropped 26,000 bombs on these countries and that
[45:22.640 --> 45:26.560]  worked out to something like three bombs an hour that he dropped on. Why is that
[45:26.560 --> 45:32.600]  not racist okay when we look at this but it's if we after we have created this
[45:32.600 --> 45:36.480]  problem there and it is all being done for the sake of regime change and there
[45:36.480 --> 45:41.000]  is still this establishment strain within the Trump administration got big
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.760]  masters part of the National Security Council still continuing to push for
[45:44.760 --> 45:48.840]  regime change when you got others like Mattis who is in
[45:48.840 --> 45:53.240]  Pentagon saying no we actually we want to fight ISIS so the question is are we
[45:53.240 --> 45:57.600]  going to work with ISIS to get regime change because that's our key goal or
[45:57.600 --> 46:02.640]  are we going to try to shut down ISIS that's a fight that continues to go on
[46:02.640 --> 46:06.960]  within the Trump administration that's how serious things are because we have
[46:06.960 --> 46:11.440]  even when we look at things like Obamacare or tax cuts we still have the
[46:11.440 --> 46:15.920]  vast majority of the Republican Party who want the status quo the ones who
[46:15.920 --> 46:19.800]  were the odd men out are the ones who say but wait a minute we campaigned for
[46:19.800 --> 46:23.360]  eight years and we won the last election as well by saying that we're going to
[46:23.360 --> 46:26.280]  repeal Obamacare those are the people who are considered to be extremists
[46:26.280 --> 46:29.440]  they're the outliers they're the ones who have to be isolated it's the
[46:29.440 --> 46:33.240]  establishment Republicans working with the so-called moderate Republicans who
[46:33.240 --> 46:36.880]  are trying to shut all this down and I don't see anything in any of these
[46:36.880 --> 46:39.720]  proposals that are coming out of the House or the Senate that are going to do
[46:39.720 --> 46:44.200]  anything to actually fix the affordability of health care because
[46:44.200 --> 46:47.480]  nothing in Obamacare does that it actually makes it worse just as they
[46:47.480 --> 46:50.400]  have and whenever you subsidize something whenever you steal money from
[46:50.400 --> 46:55.040]  one group to the other you are not doing anything to help us afford it and so all
[46:55.040 --> 46:59.040]  the things that Trump campaigned on in terms of his health care proposal I'm
[46:59.040 --> 47:02.280]  not seeing these being put in there by the people who are crafting the
[47:02.280 --> 47:07.000]  legislation at the House at the Senate because we know that when it came up for
[47:07.000 --> 47:10.560]  election in 2012 we had a choice we're going to be given a choice between
[47:10.560 --> 47:15.760]  Obamacare or Romney care and they picked Paul Ryan to run alongside and implement
[47:15.760 --> 47:19.840]  Romney care and so that really truly is the case right now it's a very very
[47:19.840 --> 47:23.000]  minor difference between these two plans because the establishment
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.920]  Republicans want Obamacare to continue well and Rand Paul points out how the
[47:27.920 --> 47:31.360]  subsidies coming from quote-unquote Trump care are actually worse than the
[47:31.360 --> 47:36.480]  subsidies from Obamacare but you know the left though they lie to their
[47:36.480 --> 47:39.920]  constituents they lie to their audience and they tell that they tell they're
[47:39.920 --> 47:43.160]  telling all of these people these anti-trumpers that they're having these
[47:43.160 --> 47:46.840]  victories oh the Trump travel ban being shut down is a victory for you that's a
[47:46.840 --> 47:50.560]  victory for us James Comey having to testify this is going to be a major
[47:50.560 --> 47:54.480]  victory from us so many implications on Trump and then it always turns out being
[47:54.480 --> 47:59.200]  the opposite the call me hearing was a total loss for the anti-trumpers the
[47:59.200 --> 48:03.320]  travel ban once this gets passed the Supreme Court will be a total loss for
[48:03.320 --> 48:06.640]  the anti-trumpers because he's going to be well within his rights is present now
[48:06.640 --> 48:10.520]  we're on to the health care bill I do think right now technically you could
[48:10.520 --> 48:14.120]  say that it's a loss for us because I don't want the new health care bill you
[48:14.120 --> 48:18.000]  don't want the new health care bill but guess what it's not gonna pass so we're
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.160]  not even gonna get the new health care bill so that's not even gonna be a loss
[48:21.160 --> 48:24.360]  and real quick to close out this segment I want to go because we were talking
[48:24.360 --> 48:28.960]  about Loretta Lynch and the Clinton email interference even Adam Schiff even
[48:28.960 --> 48:33.280]  the pencil neck himself is saying that he is feeling queasy about what's going
[48:33.280 --> 48:37.120]  on with this obstruction of justice here's pencil neck the former FBI
[48:37.120 --> 48:42.400]  director he also testified that the Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch
[48:42.400 --> 48:46.360]  improperly injected politics into the investigation of Hillary Clinton's
[48:46.360 --> 48:50.760]  emails I want you to listen to what he told the Senate Intelligence Committee
[48:50.760 --> 48:55.440]  Attorney General had directed me not to call it an investigation but instead to
[48:55.440 --> 49:01.280]  call it a matter which confused me and concerned me but that was one of bricks
[49:01.280 --> 49:05.320]  in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the department if
[49:05.320 --> 49:09.800]  we're to close this case credibly Senator Dianne Feinstein was on this
[49:09.800 --> 49:14.520]  program recently and she said that gave her a queasy feeling the Senate
[49:14.520 --> 49:18.000]  Judiciary Committee is investigating this do you think that Loretta Lynch could
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.160]  come to Capitol Hill and testify about this you know I think Senator Feinstein's
[49:23.160 --> 49:27.320]  comment I would agree with it does give me a queasy feeling as well there may be
[49:27.320 --> 49:32.680]  a perfectly accurate explanation by Loretta Lynch about why she thought
[49:32.680 --> 49:36.400]  matter was the appropriate term rather than investigation so I wouldn't assume
[49:36.400 --> 49:40.360]  James Comey's characterization is the last word on it even though I'm sure
[49:40.360 --> 49:44.880]  it's accurate but I'd like to hear what Loretta Lynch's explanation for that is
[49:44.880 --> 49:50.120]  either by having her come to the Hill or by having her speak publicly about what
[49:50.120 --> 49:55.840]  was you know I don't know that this is really part of the Russia investigation
[49:55.840 --> 49:59.880]  this was more part of the Clinton email investigation I'm not sure it's within our
[49:59.880 --> 50:04.320]  it's all the same thing David it's all the same thing it's all a canard it's all
[50:04.320 --> 50:07.240]  a lie we want to get down to the bottom of it well it should make them feel
[50:07.240 --> 50:10.960]  queasy because they are the ones who violated the law and this is becoming
[50:10.960 --> 50:14.720]  very apparent we've had as I mentioned before Senator Grassley Senator Paul said
[50:14.720 --> 50:19.560]  the unmasking and the surveillance of American citizens is a violation of the
[50:19.560 --> 50:25.040]  law the Obama administration the people in the NSA Comey and the FBI Lynch and
[50:25.040 --> 50:29.360]  the Attorney General's office they violated the law the FISA court this is
[50:29.360 --> 50:33.600]  not some anonymous whistleblower through the Washington Post but the FISA court
[50:33.600 --> 50:37.640]  said they did and declassified that so they should get a queasy feeling because
[50:37.640 --> 50:41.720]  they should be going to jail and I got news for all the drive-by media viewers
[50:41.720 --> 50:44.960]  out there Loretta Lynch has been obstructing justice for years on this
[50:44.960 --> 50:48.320]  deal every time she goes in front of a Senate committee she won't answer a
[50:48.320 --> 51:00.160]  question she's gonna have to start answering

[54:10.400 --> 54:14.640]  we are winning the culture war it's a slow but steady victory folks and we
[54:14.640 --> 54:20.200]  need to stay the course and President Trump is certainly a beachhead helping
[54:20.200 --> 54:25.120]  at the top of this movement and there's some culture war happening right now
[54:25.120 --> 54:30.240]  with maintaining our foundations of religion in this country and praying to
[54:30.240 --> 54:35.680]  God and accepting Christianity as the original foundation for this country but
[54:35.680 --> 54:40.080]  obviously the clash of civilizations multiculturalism is a globalism plan to
[54:40.080 --> 54:43.920]  bring this country to its knees so real quick and now David Knight has a story
[54:43.920 --> 54:49.080]  about an update on what's going on right now at as far as Hillary Clinton trying
[54:49.080 --> 54:51.960]  to be a part of this but I wanted to introduce it with this story because it
[54:51.960 --> 54:57.040]  kind of explains a lot Saudi student now a US fugitive after skipping bail paid
[54:57.040 --> 55:01.920]  by consulate so this is a Saudi Arabian national who was here in America as a
[55:01.920 --> 55:08.480]  student 21 years old and he is awaiting trial for a manslaughter case of a
[55:08.480 --> 55:12.840]  hit-and-run accident that killed a 15 year old last summer so he's been
[55:12.840 --> 55:17.880]  waiting in jail on bail well the Saudi Arabian consulate the Saudi Arabian
[55:17.880 --> 55:25.800]  government decided to pay for his bail so Saudi Arabia bails this person out and
[55:25.800 --> 55:33.000]  then what does he do he runs away he skirts the law he is now a fugitive
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.360]  shocking isn't that shocking he's about to face justice probably go to jail for
[55:38.360 --> 55:42.280]  a long time for this manslaughter Saudi Arabian bails him out and now he's gone
[55:42.280 --> 55:50.560]  so far they've been one family well his name is Abdul Raham Samir Nura and he
[55:50.560 --> 55:55.840]  gone yeah well you know there's a lot of talk the Washington Post took a big
[55:55.840 --> 55:59.840]  exception of the fact that Donald Trump did not have the Ramadan dinner and they
[55:59.840 --> 56:03.720]  began talking about that this weekend and they said that he's broken a two
[56:03.720 --> 56:09.240]  decade old tradition who started it Hillary Clinton 1996 she started
[56:09.240 --> 56:13.040]  celebrating Ramadan in the White House and they've continued every year since
[56:13.040 --> 56:16.480]  so we've had a tradition a venerable tradition that began with Hillary
[56:16.480 --> 56:22.160]  Clinton went through George W. and Barack Obama and we have Donald Trump
[56:22.160 --> 56:27.160]  saying no thank you also in 1998 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as
[56:27.160 --> 56:31.720]  Secretary of State pushed through a celebration of Ramadan and if if tar
[56:31.720 --> 56:35.480]  dinner for the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has not continued that they
[56:35.480 --> 56:39.800]  wish them well but they're not going to celebrate it now when I what I think is
[56:39.800 --> 56:44.760]  important about this is that the left the Washington Post and others have tried
[56:44.760 --> 56:49.240]  to say but it was Jefferson who did the very first one in 1805 well the reality
[56:49.240 --> 56:52.240]  is is that was not an iftar dinner that was not a celebration that was a
[56:52.240 --> 56:56.720]  situation with the Tunisian ambassador they invited him for dinner at 330 he
[56:56.720 --> 56:59.520]  said I can't do it because I've got this religious ceremony I can't eat until
[56:59.520 --> 57:03.560]  sunset so they said well okay well just delay it how about that and come it's a
[57:03.560 --> 57:07.960]  sunset okay fine so he does that there's no indication that there was any
[57:07.960 --> 57:12.140]  special food they were not aware of their traditions they didn't even call them
[57:12.140 --> 57:16.200]  Muslims or Muslims they called them muscle men at the time and of course they
[57:16.200 --> 57:21.480]  were aware of Islam and there are quite some interesting comments about the
[57:21.480 --> 57:26.720]  founding fathers they saw Islam as a political system a political system of
[57:26.720 --> 57:31.280]  oppression more than they saw it as a religion nevertheless what we see here
[57:31.280 --> 57:34.200]  with Jefferson I think illustrates a very important point and that's the
[57:34.200 --> 57:38.080]  difference between the free exercise of religion and the establishment of
[57:38.080 --> 57:41.600]  religion and what Hillary Clinton was trying to do with her state department
[57:41.600 --> 57:47.120]  and what we saw with Bush and with Obama was to try to establish a religion a
[57:47.120 --> 57:51.680]  tradition to try to establish a religious tradition in the White House as
[57:51.680 --> 57:55.840]  opposed to allowing people to freely exercise it by saying hey all right
[57:55.840 --> 57:59.240]  we'll delay our dinner until sunset then you're gonna come and that is kind of
[57:59.240 --> 58:03.160]  potluck whatever you can find you can eat that's what Jefferson did he was
[58:03.160 --> 58:07.360]  tolerant of other people he allowed the free exercise a religion but he was not
[58:07.360 --> 58:12.280]  going to establish a religious tradition not gonna do it that's what
[58:12.280 --> 58:16.520]  Hillary Clinton did that's what Madeleine Albright did as she was starving to death
[58:16.520 --> 58:21.240]  starving I guess that's a was I kind of a Ramadan tradition starving into death
[58:21.240 --> 58:23.960]  a half million children and then saying it was worth it because of her
[58:23.960 --> 58:28.960]  sanctions well I think that this is a purely political move started by the
[58:28.960 --> 58:32.920]  Clintons back in the 90s and we're gonna explain that and get into more than
[58:32.920 --> 58:36.960]  that on the other side Alex Jones show Owen shroyer David Knight second hour
[58:36.960 --> 58:40.440]  coming up Tommy Robinson will be joining us in the second hour don't go
[58:40.440 --> 58:53.920]  anywhere we've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together
[58:53.920 --> 58:58.920]  with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[58:58.920 --> 59:02.080]  that God gave us to Mother Nature to detoxify the body that's why I'm
[59:02.080 --> 59:07.200]  introducing the shield toxic metal and chemical defense support it's made in
[59:07.200 --> 59:11.720]  the USA it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[59:11.720 --> 59:15.320]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info or it is a
[59:15.320 --> 59:20.000]  classical 360 when this is the formula that I personally have been taking for
[59:20.000 --> 59:24.080]  over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it
[59:24.080 --> 59:27.780]  comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get you up to yourself you
[59:27.780 --> 59:31.400]  owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world
[59:31.400 --> 59:36.240]  that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[59:36.240 --> 59:40.960]  because we need you the remnant of America to reignite those brush fires the
[59:40.960 --> 59:44.000]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your
[59:44.000 --> 59:47.440]  support and your prayers together we're changing the world now it's time to
[59:47.440 --> 59:52.320]  change our bodies with z-shield and in foreshelves.com
[59:52.320 --> 59:58.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[59:58.160 --> 1:00:14.540]  this world can disagree they don't understand how it can be
[1:00:14.540 --> 1:00:21.920]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:31.120]  well president trump and his cabinet have decided to just forego the Ramadan
[1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:35.120]  dinner nothing vicious just they've decided to forego it nothing nothing
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:39.480]  bad to say just not gonna do that this year and the left is freaking out they
[1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:43.480]  cannot believe this intolerance from president trump it's really unbelievable
[1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:49.360]  but I'm trying to recall what is the name of the tradition that they do in the
[1:00:49.360 --> 1:00:54.280]  Muslim countries when they celebrate Christmas oh oh wait that doesn't happen
[1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:58.520]  oh oh funny how that works so but no complaining about that but let's be
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:04.280]  perfectly clear as you pointed out this is a political move David a hundred
[1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:07.760]  percent the reason why and it was actually in that Breitbart article you
[1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:12.560]  guys showed earlier the reason why Bill Clinton hosted this dinner the reason
[1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:18.320]  why the left tried to own having this dinner was to get votes simple that is
[1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:22.360]  it they knew that they were about to bring the mid-east into the United
[1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:26.080]  States they knew that there was going to be a huge refugee influx in the next
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:29.800]  couple decades so they decided to have this dinner and dear themselves to the
[1:01:29.800 --> 1:01:33.920]  Muslim community bring in the Muslims and then win a bunch of more votes that
[1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:37.600]  was the entire reason for this had nothing to do with tolerance had nothing
[1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:40.440]  to do with them wanting to reach out given alex branch to Muslims or anything
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:46.640]  like that a hundred percent a political tactic and again I'll wait I'll be
[1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:50.120]  waiting here probably my whole life for the left to call out Muslim countries
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:53.880]  that don't celebrate Christmas David well you're right that what they're
[1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:57.400]  doing is a a people replacement and they knew that this is part of their
[1:01:57.400 --> 1:02:02.400]  policy that's a key part of what their regime changes about it's creating chaos
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:06.680]  throughout the Middle East and there's a lot of chaos that's being created at the
[1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:11.360]  moment we have this back-and-forth going between Qatar and the United Arab
[1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:16.880]  Emirates and the Saudis and then on the side of Qatar is Turk government they're
[1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:19.960]  not going to remove their troops or their military base and of course the US has
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:24.400]  a big military base there but they're trying there is not a unified Arabic
[1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:27.720]  states matter of fact we have all these different factions with Islam and
[1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:31.240]  they're all these different political aspects of it as I said before the
[1:02:31.240 --> 1:02:34.600]  founders of this country sought more as a political system than they did as a
[1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:38.480]  religious system but we have to understand what actually makes sense why
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:42.120]  there's all that infighting that would actually make sense yeah yeah it is very
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:47.360]  much political and that was the problem with Christianity when Christianity had
[1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:52.160]  the problems that those on the left the atheists talk about the Christians
[1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:56.280]  against Christians that was when it became entangled with politics and
[1:02:56.280 --> 1:03:00.240]  that's why in the First Amendment we're very careful to allow the free exercise
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:04.880]  of religion but also not to have it established by the particular government
[1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:08.800]  because we know that that corrupts the religion and it certainly has corrupted
[1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:13.360]  Islam and there's no indication that's going to change but you know as we're
[1:03:13.360 --> 1:03:16.960]  looking at this and we mentioned this over the break even in Jordan which has
[1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:21.200]  been one of the most Western of the Muslim countries they just had a
[1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:25.560]  restaurant that will shut down because they served non-Muslims during Ramadan
[1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:29.360]  and they said well we can see you serving them and so forth and so on and
[1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:31.920]  you have to have special permissions to do this or we're going to shut you down
[1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:36.480]  that is the intolerance that is the politicization of their religion
[1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:41.320]  being enforced the Sharia law if you will even in Jordan where they're doing
[1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:44.960]  this so this is not the way the Middle East was a few years ago and it's
[1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:49.680]  continuing continuing to get worse as we have this regime change in Libya as
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:53.760]  they're trying to do this in Syria and elsewhere that it is they're breaking
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:57.080]  this apart and then bringing the people into the United States is the great
[1:03:57.080 --> 1:04:00.360]  people replacement and of course we're going to talk to Michael Springman about
[1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:05.360]  that in the third hour his book talking about the the great people replacement
[1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:08.600]  that is happening here but that's the thing that is behind all of us and we've
[1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:11.760]  got Tommy Robinson who's going to join us in the next segment and you know it
[1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:14.880]  would be one thing again I you know what we're not against any people we just
[1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:19.640]  want to live in reality but you know Tommy Robinson lives in London is dealing
[1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:23.240]  and he may live in Manchester I'm not sure but he he's dealing with this
[1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:27.640]  situation and he comes on the show and he talks about this with Alex Jones but
[1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:31.480]  here's the difference if if they were bringing in people to the to to our
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:34.240]  country or any of these countries and they were assimilating they were
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:37.800]  embracing the culture they weren't clashing with the civilization then I
[1:04:37.800 --> 1:04:40.800]  don't think it would be as big of an issue that's not what's happening Tommy
[1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:44.160]  Robinson walks down the streets of his own neighborhood where he grew up and
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:47.520]  the and the people that are Muslim are saying we own this neighborhood now
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:50.320]  this is our neighborhood now and he's like what the heck no you don't I've
[1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:53.600]  lived here my whole life so we're gonna be joined by Tommy Robinson on the
[1:04:53.600 --> 1:05:00.280]  other side don't go anywhere
[1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:06.880]  Wow you're going to love the latest idea out of the EU Scott Keller a German
[1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:10.720]  member of the European Parliament and of the Green Party so we should transplant
[1:05:10.720 --> 1:05:15.120]  entire villages from Syria to Germany and that would encourage more migrants to
[1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:19.760]  enter Germany listen to these quotes the idea of Syrian villages is only one
[1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:23.920]  possibility we can use for example if refugees don't want to go to a country
[1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:27.360]  alone that has no other refugees people would rather go where compatriots
[1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:31.640]  already live which makes integration and acceptance easier let's look at these
[1:05:31.640 --> 1:05:35.680]  three compatriots from Paul Joseph Watson Sweden migrants viciously beat
[1:05:35.680 --> 1:05:39.760]  disabled man while calling him racist three compatriot refugees attempted to
[1:05:39.760 --> 1:05:42.840]  steal a homeless man's wallet in a train station during an incident which
[1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:45.960]  took place last month the handicapped man was kicked and punched and received
[1:05:45.960 --> 1:05:48.800]  a vicious uppercut as one of the migrants lectured him about war on
[1:05:48.800 --> 1:05:53.360]  Muslims and how all Swedes were racist now how's that for acceptance you can

[1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:41.640]  Alex Jones show Owen Schroyer David Knight filling in for Alex today and we
[1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:46.960]  are joined by Tommy Robinson a lot to talk about with Tommy he's got say some
[1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:50.880]  charitable campaigns some awareness campaigns that he is going through right
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:55.200]  now he's being celebrated now in England one video I'll never forget Tommy you're
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:58.960]  walking down the streets and you have an entire crowd chanting Tommy Tommy Tommy
[1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:05.800]  Tommy that had to be wild for you but but I think that the thing that my
[1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:09.160]  audience here that our audience wants to hear about is your experience with
[1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:12.920]  Pierce Morgan obviously Alex Jones had a famous interchange with Pierce Morgan
[1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:17.720]  some years ago that well it kind of dealt a serious blow to Pierce Morgan I
[1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:22.800]  think that you may now have dealt another haymaker to Pierce Morgan tell us
[1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:27.960]  about your experience I think that the problem is with people up here Morgan
[1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:32.960]  they're not in touch with the people and I think he thought he'd be a white
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:38.400]  night by trying to absolutely crucify me and it's quite the opposite I don't
[1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:41.960]  think they realized it interaction we're having with the general public and the
[1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:45.800]  support we're getting from the general public so yeah he hasn't had a very good
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:50.760]  reaction to his response to me it was the typical I was basically my argument on
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:56.480]  facts I was trying to argue facts and he just wanted to shout and shout insults
[1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:01.480]  and lay me as a bigger as a fascist and the usual which to be honest people in
[1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:05.040]  in our country especially maybe not an establishment but people in the general
[1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:08.880]  public are sick to death of that now they're sick to death of because that is
[1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:13.400]  it's not an argument he didn't have an argument and that's what he did here in
[1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:16.640]  America too he came to America and he decided with his American show that he
[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:21.360]  was going to tell us what we didn't know that we needed to give up our guns
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:24.680]  and turn them in and not have the ability to protect ourselves and he would
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:29.640]  run one program after the other until he ran his program into the ground and
[1:10:29.640 --> 1:10:33.560]  what we do is he'd have people on who are very articulate effective spokes
[1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:38.560]  persons for the rational reasons as to why we should be able to protect
[1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:42.240]  ourselves not only constitutional reasons but also pragmatic reasons and he
[1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:45.440]  would just talk over them he wouldn't let them get a word in edgewise that was
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:50.200]  his strategy that's why Alex went on and he just shut him down with a 1776
[1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:53.720]  rant that was the perfect way to handle Piers Morgan
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:11:01.320]  I remember his rant I remember I was sat there and at first I tried at first I
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:04.600]  thought I'll try and see if I can and the longer I sat there the more he was
[1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:07.960]  talking I did it wasn't get a chance to talk and I thought unless I try and
[1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:12.800]  shout back unless I try and argue back it over him and talk over him I'm not
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:16.400]  going to get a chance to get an important person and to be honest with Piers
[1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:19.960]  Morgan's background in the UK with what he's been involved in he's been
[1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:25.840]  involved in hacking of dead children's phones yeah okay he was involved in the
[1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:30.080]  doctrine of photos which were put on the front page of his newspaper at the time
[1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:36.720]  which brought our armed forces it's destroyed their reputation because it
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:40.480]  was pictures that were doctored to make it look like our armed forces were
[1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:45.240]  torturing people in Iraq so he is a man whose morals go completely out the
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:50.560]  window for and I could I could have come in with all of these things and but I
[1:11:50.560 --> 1:11:57.200]  made that I made the point not to because we just saw that on TV I feel
[1:11:57.200 --> 1:12:01.320]  it's my job I'm doing a public service to debate the issues that people are
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:04.640]  desperate to have heard they they're not bothered about hearing about what Piers
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:08.600]  Morgan done five years ago ten years ago or what Tommy Robinson said eight years
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:12.560]  ago a demonstration they're bothered about the reason why we have dead
[1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:17.080]  children in our cities getting blown to pieces why we've had three terrorist
[1:12:17.080 --> 1:12:21.120]  attacks in three months why they've had five planned why 12 terrorist attacks
[1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:24.400]  were stopped last year that's what they're bothered about they're bothered
[1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:28.480]  about finding a solution to it about having the debate about it but all
[1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:31.960]  Piers tried to do was shut that down and stop it you know that is the fundamental
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:36.440]  difference right now in the two diametrically opposed sides right now
[1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:41.480]  on planet earth where you're coming at the issue saying here's the issue this
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:45.400]  is what people want to hear you're tuned in you're you're locked in you're
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:49.960]  engaged with the people where Piers Morgan still has this dinosaur train of
[1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:53.240]  thought that I think most mainstream media has where they think the people
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:56.760]  want to hear you complain they think the people want to hear you say this is
[1:12:56.760 --> 1:13:00.200]  how we're bad this is how we need to be better this is how we need to be more
[1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:03.720]  tolerant this is how we're racist this is how we're sexist this is how we should
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:06.920]  be better this is what's wrong with us people are over that they're done with
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:10.720]  that they see real issues affecting them in their daily lives that's what they
[1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:13.800]  want to address not some labeling contest
[1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:19.960]  did you know this show this show that was the most the biggest audience that
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:25.680]  ever had for that show ever so they really need to be in tune here that
[1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:29.280]  which they're not they really underestimated the support we have we
[1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:32.840]  have they really underestimated how many people are desperate for this
[1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:37.400]  conversation to be had desperate to hear the fact desperate to find solutions
[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:42.520]  not not as you're right shouted down and silent which is what has been
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:48.080]  happening for so long if you if you look when I picked up the Quran I picked up
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:51.200]  the Quran they were terrified the whole studio
[1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:56.520]  oh yeah I could see the alarm bells running straight away I could see their
[1:13:56.520 --> 1:14:05.640]  reaction put it down put it down put it down if he's in screaming at me when we
[1:14:05.640 --> 1:14:09.000]  when we talk about Islamophobia if there was a term which there isn't if there
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:15.240]  was any issue of Islamophobia and that is it the fact that the whole studio and
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:22.480]  the presenter were absolutely petrified because I picked up a book yeah that
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:26.440]  defines what it is at the same time you got Justin Trudeau this weekend
[1:14:26.440 --> 1:14:33.280]  wearing Islam themed Ramadan socks to an LGBT pride parade and it's like how do
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:38.160]  you even try to explain that kind of cognitive dissonance to these people
[1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:41.560]  they don't realize how diametrically opposed these people are and so that's
[1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:44.800]  why they don't want you holding the Quran they don't want you talking about
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:48.680]  what it is in reality they don't want you talking about the political the heavy
[1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:53.200]  political dimensions of this religion and and that's what they're trying to
[1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:57.000]  cover up that's what they think they can deceive the public with and they can
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:02.320]  wear again as we see the picture him wearing Islamic socks to an LGBT pride
[1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:06.680]  parade I mean it's this is absolute insanity it's almost like they're
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:10.120]  shoving it right in your face but the most amazing thing to me is they're
[1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:13.880]  gonna sit here and they'll point at Tommy Robinson and they'll say Tommy
[1:15:13.880 --> 1:15:19.440]  Robinson is an Islamophobe Tommy Robinson is gonna cause Islamic violence
[1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:24.080]  and you scratch and you're like wait a second doesn't that make you the Islamophobe
[1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:27.920]  how are you not the Islamophobe if you're the one that's afraid of these
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:30.840]  people committing violence just because you're talking about it I mean this is
[1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:33.800]  the reality we're living with Tommy I know that you're actually running some
[1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:36.960]  charitable campaigns right now you want to raise some awareness you're trying to
[1:15:36.960 --> 1:15:39.520]  look for solutions you're trying to bring the community together tell us
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:45.240]  about these so we're running one campaign called Justin Chelsea now Chelsea was a
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:50.000]  young mother of three who was on the night out with her mother she was she
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:57.920]  wasn't aware she was by Syrian refugees she was beaten, violently beaten, an intrusion
[1:15:57.920 --> 1:16:01.400]  you know what guys let's give this let's give this a second for this for this
[1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:05.280]  connection to re-stabilize because he was explaining this justice for Chelsea
[1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:08.600]  dot com if you guys could pull that website back up it started breaking up
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:13.200]  on you to Tommy when you were talking yeah start over Tommy go ahead
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:18.880]  okay so mother of three was out with her mother and she was gunned by by
[1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:24.920]  Syrian refugees now the police arrested six men they found two of their
[1:16:24.920 --> 1:16:34.280]  DNAs on her and on her and in her and from this the police support no no
[1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:39.240]  further action has been pulled so we then we then launched the campaign
[1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:43.320]  because no no no one even hears about these stories we've launched a campaign
[1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:48.480]  where we told her story we interviewed her it went viral in the UK and we've
[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:54.320]  held demonstration after demonstration we've gained over a hundred thousand
[1:16:54.320 --> 1:17:00.440]  figures from the UK's best lawyers to go against the police on this the
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:04.520]  challenge the Crown prosecution services decision not to bring any
[1:17:04.520 --> 1:17:09.040]  charges and obviously the campaign we're running on the website is for people
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:13.600]  to donate to help us with legal costs and hopefully bring justice for this
[1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:17.560]  young English mother of three so that's the theme that we continue to see over
[1:17:17.560 --> 1:17:21.040]  and over again just as we had this recent to tear attack where they had
[1:17:21.040 --> 1:17:25.240]  featured these people as the jihadis next door but they were refused to do
[1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:29.480]  anything to protect the British people and they refused to do it even after an
[1:17:29.480 --> 1:17:33.640]  attack that's what's so amazing about the government there and of course as you
[1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:38.320]  know just like we see here in America it's both parties that are involved the
[1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:42.000]  key parties or it's conservatives as well as labor they're standing down and
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:45.720]  not doing anything in the UK just as we see the same thing happening here with
[1:17:45.720 --> 1:17:50.480]  Republicans and with Democrats well we can as you know in the UK we've had
[1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:55.960]  conspiracy asylum between political leaders religious leaders these leaders
[1:17:55.960 --> 1:17:59.920]  take the rape of our women into in city lights in towns and cities like
[1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:03.880]  Roboram across our whole country now what's happened with Chelsea is and I'm
[1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:08.440]  just we don't know yet because we've got with we're having to hire private investigators
[1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:13.560]  to find who the men were because maybe just maybe these men were part of a
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:20.600]  government program now maybe maybe as the rest of the rate maybe that's why
[1:18:20.600 --> 1:18:23.800]  this has been shelled maybe that's why they have not been prosecuted that's
[1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:29.160]  what we need to find out why why these men it's quite clear we actually went
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:32.680]  and I contacted on the video we done for the Justice for Chelsea campaign I
[1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:37.760]  contacted an eyewitness who didn't know Chelsea who saw her running from the
[1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:44.240]  house naked with our clothes and being dragged back in her clothes that she
[1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:49.560]  wore out that night has still never been found so these are campaigns where
[1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:52.640]  this can't be happening to women in our towns and cities and this isn't just
[1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:58.320]  we're about to launch another campaign tomorrow similar where in the same city
[1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:02.880]  in the same city as Chelsea a young a young English businessman on the front
[1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:08.640]  of his shop he put don't fund terror shop at Fletcher's seven times the police
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:13.680]  visited him in two weeks seven times asking him telling him warning him they
[1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:19.920]  need to take down the sign says don't fund terror terrorism now because he
[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:24.520]  because he said no they then look and got the council involved to take away his
[1:19:24.520 --> 1:19:32.160]  licenses to send alcohol to affect his ability to provide for his family
[1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:36.400]  but this is bullying this is what goes on across our home country now since this
[1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:43.280]  again we got to go to a break our guest Tommy Robinson is on Skype right now
[1:19:43.280 --> 1:19:46.440]  we're gonna have him back for the other segment but that is amazing shutting
[1:19:46.440 --> 1:19:50.760]  down a shop it didn't it didn't it didn't say anything except don't fund
[1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:54.520]  terrorism it doesn't allude to who the terrace might be or anything it just says
[1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:57.800]  don't fund terrorism well that's hate speech we got up we got to shut that
[1:19:57.800 --> 1:20:03.000]  down said the British police unbelievable heart disease is on the rise

[1:24:13.640 --> 1:24:19.080]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show Owen shroyer David Knight we are joined by
[1:24:19.080 --> 1:24:23.840]  Tommy Robinson right now over skype and we've been talking about justice for
[1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:29.040]  Chelsea a charitable campaign and an awareness campaign that he has tried
[1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:32.920]  to gain some momentum on over there but I kind of wanted to shift the
[1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:35.960]  conversation in a different direction Tommy I wanted to talk about some
[1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:41.520]  events that happened over there that kind of you know we know how the media
[1:24:41.520 --> 1:24:44.280]  cycle works now it's a big story for a day or two and then it kind of gets
[1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:47.680]  swept away when there's some other developments that are happening first
[1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:51.880]  let's start on the Grenfell Tower now first you had Sadiq Khan come out and
[1:24:51.880 --> 1:24:55.240]  say well all of the immigrants that are in that tower that have been victimized
[1:24:55.240 --> 1:24:59.920]  by this burning that somehow started by a refrigerator I don't buy that for one
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:03.440]  second I'd like to hear if you buy that I'm not buying that for one second but
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:08.440]  now he's saying also this is a this is a residential tower that was filled with
[1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:12.200]  immigrants now he's saying the ones that weren't that didn't have amnesty or
[1:25:12.200 --> 1:25:15.520]  weren't citizens now he's gonna grant them amnesty I'd like to hear your
[1:25:15.520 --> 1:25:20.880]  thoughts on that situation everything has developed my thoughts are that the
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:27.200]  figures that I've met here and I haven't looked into how much I heard that 70
[1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:32.240]  people were evacuated 76 people evacuated I heard that up to nearly a hundred
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:38.440]  people could be dead that tower block holds six houses 600 people where's the
[1:25:38.440 --> 1:25:43.800]  rest of them nothing seems to really add up when he talks about an amnesty it's
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:47.680]  like all of a sudden you're just going to get hundreds of illegal immigrants saying
[1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:50.560]  they were saying that but I didn't read why we're not hearing that much it's
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:55.360]  because it is pretty much a tower block full of Muslim immigrants and I'm
[1:25:55.360 --> 1:25:58.600]  guessing that many of them have been subletting their council the houses
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:03.720]  that they're given for free paid for by the tax power I believe many of them are
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:09.000]  probably it seems subletting them out to illegals the people who shouldn't be in
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:14.080]  it and in itself be a story but yeah I don't buy it I know when I'm looking at
[1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:19.680]  the time in a bit I it started it's the fire started at quarter to two in the
[1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:25.040]  morning I believe and last prayers were half one
[1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:32.480]  but I think there's a lot more that will come out about this incident I
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:36.200]  watched it and don't mean that like anyone and you're watching a song like
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:41.320]  that and you've got you've got people from their children out of windows it's
[1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:45.280]  horrific it was horrific to watch yeah yeah and the building and the building
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:49.400]  still sits there almost like a symbol honestly like I mean you know what I'm
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:53.600]  saying well a burn for what was it something like 12 hours or something
[1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:57.880]  standing still standing like the twin towers that fell magically and then
[1:26:57.880 --> 1:27:00.840]  their footprint even though one of them wasn't even hit by a plane that's their
[1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:04.920]  narrative but it's interesting because that's typically what we do see with
[1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:09.400]  steel skyscrapers we don't see them collapsing even after they have burned
[1:27:09.400 --> 1:27:15.040]  like a torch as that one did for a dozen hours but I think it's also a man kind
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:20.760]  yeah it's also interesting I think to see the mayor's reaction after Fenbury
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:24.240]  Park saying well we're gonna have to protect Muslims now when as in the past
[1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:28.920]  he would say well this is part and parcel living in a big city you just have
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:33.960]  to deal with these terrorist events but then when something happens and you know
[1:27:33.960 --> 1:27:36.600]  there's a car driven into some muslims he says well we're now we're gonna have
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:39.400]  to do special protection for muslims I think that's very interesting the
[1:27:39.400 --> 1:27:44.040]  double standard that we see there the problem is that after every chair attack
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:48.800]  committed by Muslims the police go and they're at the mosques and they're all
[1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:52.800]  holding signs up together now after this happened at Fenbury Park Mosque if the
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:58.760]  police were to turn up in the church holding signs we'd all be saying that's
[1:27:58.760 --> 1:28:01.560]  pretty stupid what he's doing like it's quite clear the Muslim community
[1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:05.280]  is in this attack it's quite clear that if you need to go and see that anyone's okay
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:09.800]  in this in this incident after this attack it's the Muslim community but
[1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:12.520]  what you do after every time a Muslim commits a terrorist attack against our
[1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:16.120]  community you still are going to see that the Muslim community again I'm okay
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:20.880]  you never come in to see that I've never given us reassurances never
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:25.800]  after the London Bridge attack the first thing first thing I mean we've
[1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:28.880]  been like an hour I remember seeing the head of the head of the Metropolitan Police
[1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:33.560]  saying we want the Muslim community to know we stand together with you and no
[1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:38.760]  one will aim fear or aim threat to you and it's just what are you talking about
[1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:43.440]  every time but yeah part of parts we're living in a big city apparently terrorism
[1:28:43.440 --> 1:28:47.720]  is but unless it's directed at the Muslim community and then and then we're
[1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:51.960]  going to really stamp down and all this can be used for this Islamophobia this
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:56.520]  was a revenge attack a horrific attack it was a revenge attack the man was not
[1:28:56.520 --> 1:29:01.560]  part of a global national network of people who are obeying for the
[1:29:01.560 --> 1:29:07.400]  destruction of all Muslims which is what we face with on the opposite scale and
[1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:10.160]  I think that's a very important point that you made that when it happened with
[1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:14.400]  the London Howard Bridge the police come out and say we have to now make sure
[1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:19.240]  that we protect Muslims against any further attacks rather than saying we're
[1:29:19.240 --> 1:29:23.520]  going to stop this hate we're going to do something to protect people in
[1:29:23.520 --> 1:29:27.120]  general know they they circle the wagons around that particular community
[1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:31.000]  because they know where this is coming from and I don't recall Tommy real quick
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:34.560]  before we go what was the fun what was the final injury counter I don't remember
[1:29:34.560 --> 1:29:38.440]  even getting a body list or an injury counter anything on that attack what
[1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:44.240]  was what what did you hear I think anyone was killed I think that one man
[1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:49.200]  one man died that night I'll be honest I'll be honest I think that whole
[1:29:49.200 --> 1:29:52.200]  Finnsbury mosque attack was sketchy as well we'll be right back thank you to our
[1:29:52.200 --> 1:29:58.040]  guest Tommy Robertson support his website justiceforchelsea.com
[1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:05.080]  the struggle in the DNC fraud lawsuit continues you've had the current
[1:30:05.080 --> 1:30:08.840]  counsel for the plaintiffs request that the judge provide witness protection
[1:30:08.840 --> 1:30:13.600]  that notion was rejected despite three mysterious deaths of potential witnesses
[1:30:13.600 --> 1:30:18.000]  in the case Seth Rich Sean Lucas and Barrington Wison Ant Jr. there are
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:21.480]  also stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have this case dropped
[1:30:21.480 --> 1:30:26.440]  entirely despite the obvious glaring issues that the DNC has had over the
[1:30:26.440 --> 1:30:29.760]  course of the last two years while the lawsuit represents Bernie Sanders
[1:30:29.760 --> 1:30:34.320]  supporters who feel they have been wronged by the DNC Bernie Sanders has
[1:30:34.320 --> 1:30:37.840]  fallen silent on the issue Donald Trump tweeted out this weekend Hillary
[1:30:37.840 --> 1:30:41.040]  Clinton colluded with the Democrat Party in order to beat crazy Bernie Sanders
[1:30:41.040 --> 1:30:45.160]  is she allowed to collude unfair to Bernie so now Donald Trump has done more
[1:30:45.160 --> 1:30:48.880]  to raise awareness for the DNC fraud lawsuit than Bernie Sanders has who
[1:30:48.880 --> 1:30:52.200]  actually is the one that had the election stolen from him why is Bernie
[1:30:52.200 --> 1:30:56.560]  Sanders silent on the issue maybe I guess he's busy with being investigated by

[1:34:56.400 --> 1:35:00.640]  broadcast it's a 360 win now we're gonna talk about David wants to talk about
[1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:06.080]  some loopholes that people want to talk about at gun show loopholes yeah that's
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:08.400]  one of the favorite things of the liberals is to talk about the quote-unquote
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:12.480]  gun show loopholes here's the thing about these quote-unquote gun show loopholes
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:19.120]  you know what it's it's such a play on words because we just talked about this
[1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:23.760]  Saudi Arabian national who is being looked at for manslaughter he's being
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:29.040]  held and he's being held because he may be guilty of manslaughter and the Saudi
[1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:33.600]  Arabian government decides to bail him out well he gets bailed out and then he
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:39.920]  he up and leaves town is that a loophole do they call that a loophole yeah the
[1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:45.680]  bail loophole no that's not a loophole that's just how it works okay and I'm
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:49.880]  don't support that quote-unquote loophole but that's not how you phrase it but
[1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:53.280]  now this is one of the tax they have on gun shows David well and of course you
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:55.960]  know we talk about things like the gun show loophole we have to understand that
[1:35:55.960 --> 1:36:02.960]  it is a fundamental individual human right that you are able to protect
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:06.240]  yourself that you should own guns and of course the founders of this country
[1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:10.320]  understood that somebody who's not allowed to own guns is a slave by definition
[1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:14.040]  if you don't have any property rights you are the property so all these
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:16.960]  different things we talked about the right to self-defense the right to own
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:20.960]  property these fundamental liberties if you don't have them you are a slave and
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:24.720]  to the extent that they remove them from you to that extent you are a slave and
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:27.760]  so that's one of the reasons why in the Second Amendment it doesn't create a
[1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:31.600]  right it recognizes a right it prohibits the government from infringing on that
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:35.880]  right and the key word there is infringement because they understood it
[1:36:35.880 --> 1:36:40.040]  was always going to be a gradual process so the the liberals like to use the gun
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:44.040]  show loophole they say we need to shut that down and make sure that we shut
[1:36:44.040 --> 1:36:48.200]  down gun shows well here's an example and this is the I guess this was the
[1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:52.560]  latest terror attack we have so many of them I lose track it's been a very
[1:36:52.560 --> 1:36:57.600]  productive Ramadan this year in 2017 we set a new record for Ramadan terror
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:03.600]  attacks about 174 Islamic terror attacks they've left 1595 people dead
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:10.200]  1960 wounded so nearly 1600 dead about 2,000 people wounded in addition to that
[1:37:10.200 --> 1:37:15.600]  and so we have this situation in the Flint Michigan Airport where we had a
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:19.840]  policeman who has a guy run up to him with a knife and starts stabbing him
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:23.320]  multiple times once in the neck and so forth and so on but he tried and failed
[1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:28.880]  to purchase a firearm shortly before he attacked this police officer he was able
[1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:33.880]  to get the knife at the gun show but he was not able to get a firearm because
[1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:38.120]  he wasn't a citizen see they actually do background checks anybody that's meant
[1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:42.040]  to a gun show knows that there are actually background checks at the quote
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:47.360]  unquote gun show loophole and that's precisely what happened there but I
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:51.120]  think it's also related to that of a friend who's writer back in North
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:55.400]  Carolina Paul Chester writes for liberty headlines he has a story here
[1:37:55.400 --> 1:38:00.080]  North Carolina lawmaker offends the jihad media with the term jihad media
[1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:05.320]  where did this come from well in that same story that I was just just reported
[1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:08.960]  to you about the attack on the police officer in Flint Michigan when CNN tweeted
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:12.720]  it out they said well the suspect supported reportedly said something in
[1:38:12.720 --> 1:38:18.360]  Arabic what would that have been alahu akbar which many outlets even if they
[1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:23.840]  report that will come back and say Allah Akbar God is great no it's God is
[1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:27.760]  greater my God is greater than your God is what they are saying that's part of
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:31.680]  their attack and so when they put that kind of stuff out there this was a
[1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:36.520]  state senator Dan Bishop a Republican he came up with the term jihad media which
[1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:39.920]  I think is exactly right we talk about CNN is ISIS you know with a the
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:44.600]  Kathy Griffin meme and so forth and we have the contest going at info wars
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:49.560]  calm but it's also the jihad media I think is another good term for that
[1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:53.760]  group of people CNN is in an absolute tailspin right now when you get called
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:38:59.560]  out by Buzzfeed to be fake news when Brian Stelter the Stelter man is going
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:05.000]  on his Sunday show calling you fake news George Costanza I think George
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:09.320]  Costanza might have more credibility actually but it really just shows you
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:14.400]  that's the current state they're in and you know this this Flint Michigan thing
[1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:20.480]  it's just again the people that complain David they say oh it's so easy to get a
[1:39:20.480 --> 1:39:25.000]  gun it's too easy to get a gun these liberals who complain about that I bet
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:28.520]  you none of them have ever actually tried to get a gun yeah they just take
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:32.720]  what they hear on the media and assume it as fact and then they just repeat it
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:36.560]  that's the hearsay mafia when they've never actually tried to get a gun they've
[1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:39.920]  probably never gone to a gun show they don't know the rigmarole you have to go
[1:39:39.920 --> 1:39:44.360]  through to get a firearm when I moved to Texas I had to jump through hoops just
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:47.720]  to purchase a firearm down here it wasn't just walk to the store and get the
[1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:51.440]  weapon so there are checks and balances these things do exist honestly
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:55.680]  probably enough of them and they're looking for more so the people that
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:39:59.240]  complain about this though David I guarantee you they've never ever tried
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:02.480]  to buy a firearm the people that don't want gun rights have never gone to a
[1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:06.600]  gun range they've never shot and skeet they don't know what an assault rifle is
[1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:09.960]  they don't have a definition for it it's anything that scares them when they
[1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:13.280]  look at it and they don't want anybody to own any firearms other than the
[1:40:13.280 --> 1:40:17.360]  government we saw that in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting we had McChrystal
[1:40:17.360 --> 1:40:20.600]  come out and he started talking about I remember at the time this a guy of course
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:24.400]  was the guy that was exposed by Michael Hastings and lost his position in
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:27.760]  Afghanistan he would come out and he would talk about the muzzle velocity of
[1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:33.120]  all these different weapons and ammunition and so forth and talking
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:36.560]  about technical terms is that oh I really know this and nobody should have
[1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:40.320]  that except for the government I mean that that was his position but we
[1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:44.240]  understand and we come from a tradition where the people who founded this
[1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:49.920]  country wisely understood the danger of a monopoly of power by the people at the
[1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:53.720]  political center they said we do not want this is not an effective way to
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:58.160]  defend our country against foreign invasion and it invites domestic tyranny
[1:40:58.160 --> 1:41:02.720]  when you give the government a monopoly on firearms we can see this happening in
[1:41:02.720 --> 1:41:05.760]  every country it's happened over and over again and again going back to the
[1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:12.520]  Piers Morgan thing with Alex they're hunting the police down in the streets
[1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:16.440]  so they can take their firearms that's that's what that eventually comes down
[1:41:16.440 --> 1:41:20.360]  to they're hunting they're hunting down pets for food they're hunting down police
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:24.240]  for firearms and that's it's always going to come down to something like that
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:30.200]  because you cannot get rid of firearms they're there whether you like it or
[1:41:30.200 --> 1:41:33.600]  not and we need to explain that to the liberals but it's also an issue that it
[1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:38.360]  is simply a tool it can be used to defend life it can be used to as an
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:42.120]  aggressive way to take life but the vast majority of people are going to be
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:45.560]  responsible and they're going to use it in a responsible way to defend life we
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:49.040]  understand that that has been the tradition here in America and we know
[1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:53.760]  that even to this day the places where the vast majority of gun deaths and
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:58.240]  crime occur are in the areas that are controlled by the people who want gun
[1:41:58.240 --> 1:42:01.160]  control and take it out of the hands of the private citizens because that
[1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:05.560]  emboldens and empowers the criminal elements in those areas and that's
[1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:08.720]  one of the reasons why you don't have other nations willing to run up on our
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:13.000]  beaches and storm us because we're all armed to the teeth now I want to take
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:16.680]  the I want to take the conversation in a different direction here David as I'm
[1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:20.720]  monitoring the mainstream media as we're live and one thing that they're really
[1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:25.680]  pushing today is with with what looks like it's going to be success another
[1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:30.120]  victory for Donald Trump I think with this travel ban coming down they want
[1:42:30.120 --> 1:42:33.360]  to demonize him more on the proposed health care bill they want to demonize
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:36.840]  Trump care more as a loss when at the end of the day Trump's constituents if it
[1:42:36.840 --> 1:42:39.440]  doesn't pass they're actually going to consider that a victory because we don't
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:43.440]  want this bill to pass to begin with but they're trying to demonize Donald Trump
[1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:47.040]  they're trying to provide the optics of Donald Trump taking Medicaid away from
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:50.680]  these people taking their health care way they're all going to die now this is
[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:57.040]  the most amazing thing to me David for two reasons one Obamacare is still the
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:01.360]  law so they have these people on talking about how the GOP health care bill is
[1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:05.360]  taking away their health care except it's actually Obamacare the health care
[1:43:05.360 --> 1:43:09.440]  bill is actually still the Affordable Care Act that was signed by Obama so the
[1:43:09.440 --> 1:43:13.480]  Trump care bill that as they're dubbing it is not even law yet they bring in all
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:16.160]  of these people to complain about how they're losing their health care which
[1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:21.560]  is actually under the Obamacare coverage plan yeah nothing has changed the system
[1:43:21.560 --> 1:43:24.840]  is failing because when you try to pretend that you're giving something to
[1:43:24.840 --> 1:43:28.120]  somebody you have absolutely no basis for it you eventually run out of other
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:31.440]  people's money they're going to run out of Fannie and Freddie funds that they
[1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:35.120]  stole to get this going and when we look at the main while David's talking we
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:37.880]  look at the main opposition of this people are saying well of course the
[1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:41.880]  Congressional Budget Office is going to set their in judgment of any kind of
[1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:44.960]  reform that comes out of the House or the Senate and they're going to say but
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:47.840]  you're going to have fewer people insured with this what you know you don't
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:51.560]  really have people insured when we have the people who are paying for the
[1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:57.040]  insurance seeing their premiums going up 150% a year that's not a sustainable
[1:43:57.040 --> 1:43:59.560]  system they'd like to talk about sustainability when it comes to the
[1:43:59.560 --> 1:44:03.120]  environment but not when it comes to the economics of things and so this is
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:07.360]  not a sustainable system there isn't anything here that is really providing
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:11.880]  insurance to people they have done a head fake for a short period of time and
[1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:16.040]  they love to also talk about how this is a massive transfer of wealth from the
[1:44:16.040 --> 1:44:20.280]  middle class to a few people that's exactly what it is but the few people
[1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:24.080]  are the insurance companies and that was what it was designed to do from the very
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:26.960]  beginning it was welfare for insurance companies who said this from the very
[1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:31.840]  beginning and who are the people who are making out in terms of massive profits
[1:44:31.840 --> 1:44:35.120]  not on individual policies but on the group policies and they want the
[1:44:35.120 --> 1:44:39.120]  individual policies to go away but on the group policies the insurance companies
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:43.520]  who can hold a gun to your head now and force you to buy their product and then
[1:44:43.520 --> 1:44:47.800]  set the price for that product they're the ones who are getting this massive
[1:44:47.800 --> 1:44:52.480]  sweep of wealth from the middle class to them as they also then fund the
[1:44:52.480 --> 1:44:56.400]  insurance of people who get subsidies they fund that by theft out of the
[1:44:56.400 --> 1:45:01.760]  Fannie and Freddie funds as Dr. Corsi has pointed out many times you cannot reduce
[1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:06.520]  the cost of something by subsidizing it you will increase the cost whether it
[1:45:06.520 --> 1:45:11.040]  is college tuition or whether it is health insurance it will increase the
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:15.520]  cost it is not doing anything to bend the cost curve what it is doing is it's
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:19.880]  breaking our back in terms of people who pay for insurance who try to do the
[1:45:19.880 --> 1:45:24.160]  responsible thing there's nothing in any this legislation that will do any of
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:28.520]  the fundamental reforms that allow us to operate as consumers who are
[1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:31.600]  intelligent who have information who have the financial ability to make
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:35.360]  these decisions that's precisely what we need we need competition across state
[1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:39.560]  lines they're not putting this kind of stuff in these bills that's what Donald
[1:45:39.560 --> 1:45:43.240]  Trump ran on that's what Marco Rubio ridiculed him for lines lines what you
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:46.200]  talking about the lines you know what he was talking about with lines Rubio
[1:45:46.200 --> 1:45:49.920]  didn't know what he was talking about yeah but it's you know this health care
[1:45:49.920 --> 1:45:53.800]  bill I would say has a 99% chance of failing I don't see how this thing
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:57.800]  succeeds they'll dub it as a loss for Trump it'll be a victory for Trump by my
[1:45:57.800 --> 1:46:00.880]  estimation because Trump's constituents don't want this health care bill anyway
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:05.040]  and then I think it's gonna serve another purpose all of the conservatives
[1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:09.440]  the Republicans the GOP the Paul Ryan's that pushed this bill that are praising
[1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:14.280]  this bill that want this bill they're gonna be exposed in the 2018 midterms
[1:46:14.280 --> 1:46:17.880]  and I think Trump is gonna use that against them to help him drain the
[1:46:17.880 --> 1:46:21.280]  swamp of the people that are obstructing him that aren't going along with the
[1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:24.920]  agenda that the American people elect Donald Trump to so he should he should
[1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:27.600]  ally with the House Freedom Caucus and people who want to stand with their
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:31.520]  promises to get rid of this and he should attack the people like Paul Ryan
[1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:37.840]  who for years has run on this as a wedge issue but never had any intention of
[1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:41.280]  doing it they never had a plan that's quite obvious isn't it here we are well
[1:46:41.280 --> 1:46:43.840]  into the Trump administration and they're just kind of coming up with some
[1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:48.360]  little make work rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic they never had a
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:52.920]  plan they had never planned to do anything about it except to use it to
[1:46:52.920 --> 1:46:57.040]  win elections and that's the key thing to take away from all of this and if
[1:46:57.040 --> 1:47:00.840]  you're gonna describe it they want affordable care act it's it's the law
[1:47:00.840 --> 1:47:04.760]  is called the Affordable Care Act but actually it's really a monopoly care
[1:47:04.760 --> 1:47:11.600]  act all the trends since this bill was signed into law have moved counties into
[1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:15.520]  having one or two insurance providers I mean you look at you look at Oregon you
[1:47:15.520 --> 1:47:19.000]  look at Iowa these are some of the worst-case examples some counties now I
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:22.720]  think maybe even New Mexico it is where there's only one provider that's
[1:47:22.720 --> 1:47:27.080]  literally monopoly care and then why do we have anti-trust laws why aren't you
[1:47:27.080 --> 1:47:30.080]  allowed to have monopolies because that's how you skyrocket prices that's
[1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:33.520]  how you designed the market they're trying to push us towards a single-payer
[1:47:33.520 --> 1:47:38.240]  system the problem with the system that we have now is that there's not enough
[1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:41.680]  competition and what they're doing is a reducing competition they want the
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:47.680]  government to be the one who decides from some central ivory tower what
[1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:51.000]  insurance policy everybody is going to have and guess what one size does not
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:54.240]  fit all we want to be able to have choice and freedom and if they're
[1:47:54.240 --> 1:47:58.400]  concerned about affordability why don't they even allow us to deduct our
[1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:02.440]  medical expenses off of our income taxes they won't even go that far and when
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:06.880]  you have a medical expense they're going to take off a only going to allow a
[1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:11.600]  percentage of your adjusted gross income that you exceed on that to even be
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:16.120]  deducted let alone as a tax credit they don't give you any help at all to pay
[1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:19.600]  for health care but yet they say this is so important we need to take away your
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:23.440]  freedom we need to reorganize society we need to empower these other people we
[1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:27.280]  need to be able to hold a gun to your head and force you to buy a product from
[1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:32.040]  some of the most wealthy and powerful corporations in the country that is what
[1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:35.520]  Obamacare is about and they want to be a single-payer system it's nice so at least
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:38.220]  the Democrats put their money when their mouth is I mean it's not like the
[1:48:38.220 --> 1:48:42.720]  Democrats just spent $200 million to lose special elections they gave those
[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:46.080]  $200 million to people in Medicare that they're claiming are losing their
[1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:49.080]  coverage so it's nice that the Democrats are putting their money where their
[1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:53.360]  mouth is they had a huge you know a huge bank bank role here to run these
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:48:56.520]  special elections but they realized that the people were more important and they
[1:48:56.520 --> 1:48:59.960]  put that $200 million into the people that are losing their health care I
[1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:03.280]  don't think so oh wait that's not what happened that's not what happened oh wait
[1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:07.280]  now it goes into their coffers you know oh I'm sorry that must have confused me
[1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:10.920]  you're right about that the Democrats did spend that $200 million on losing four
[1:49:10.920 --> 1:49:14.960]  special elections they didn't give that back to the people and you know this has
[1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:20.520]  been Obama's line for the longest time now Obama says the Republicans want to
[1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:24.760]  take from the poor and give to the rich Elizabeth Warren says this is blood
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:28.680]  money this bill taking from the poor and giving to the rich I think there's one
[1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:32.440]  fundamental question that these people need to explain where is this money
[1:49:32.440 --> 1:49:36.600]  coming from that the poor are getting where where all these coffers of money
[1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:40.120]  that the poor is getting from some I don't know where they're getting it I
[1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:42.640]  guess from the government is what they're telling so the apparently poor
[1:49:42.640 --> 1:49:46.120]  people are just getting all this money somehow just raking in all these funds
[1:49:46.120 --> 1:49:49.800]  and and now we want to take it away from them and give it to the rich so I'm
[1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:53.800]  just I just want them to explain what money what money are we talking about
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:49:56.960]  where is this all where is all this money coming from that we're taking from
[1:49:56.960 --> 1:49:59.840]  the poor and giving to the rich if they're poor how do they have money for
[1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:02.400]  us to take from so I'm really just confused I'd like Obama to answer that
[1:50:02.400 --> 1:50:05.160]  you think he could explain that I can't explain it David you know if you take
[1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:10.040]  responsibility for your health care then what they're saying is you shouldn't be
[1:50:10.040 --> 1:50:13.080]  allowed to do that we're going to take that we're going to increase your
[1:50:13.080 --> 1:50:16.120]  insurance rates or if you take responsibility and you invest in
[1:50:16.120 --> 1:50:19.920]  something that you thought was safe like Fannie and Freddie because that was
[1:50:19.920 --> 1:50:22.880]  home mortgages that was something that was backed by the government so you had
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:25.680]  a lot of people with their entire retirement programs are trying to do a
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:29.760]  safe and responsible thing I remember years ago my father's dead now but you
[1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:32.520]  know he invested in Fannie and Freddie because he wanted something that was
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:35.920]  safe so what does the government do the government comes in and steals that money
[1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:39.520]  and then when somebody says maybe we shouldn't do that they say well you're
[1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:42.440]  gonna take that money from the poor and give it to the rich it's like no no
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:45.240]  you're taking it from the people who take responsibility for their own lives
[1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:49.560]  you're making their insurance unaffordable you're stealing everything
[1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:53.120]  that they invested for their retirement as well as other retirement funds taking
[1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:56.160]  that money away and then saying that we have insured 20 million people no you
[1:50:56.160 --> 1:51:01.640]  haven't you've just stolen on a grand scale will be right back it's been said
[1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:06.880]  any society is only three missed meals away from chaos those times may be near
[1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:10.200]  think about it our country faces multiple terrorist threats and
[1:51:10.200 --> 1:51:14.440]  aggressions from Russia and North Korea social unrest and violent marches yet
[1:51:14.440 --> 1:51:18.240]  again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns and a crumbling
[1:51:18.240 --> 1:51:21.800]  infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a
[1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:25.880]  single cyber attack when the chaos from any one of these threats arises the
[1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:29.720]  government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency
[1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:34.320]  that's why you need your own plan for self-reliance that's where my patriot

[1:53:53.160 --> 1:54:12.880]  pod.com the shelter pod at shelter pod.com shelter when you need it most here's
[1:54:12.880 --> 1:54:16.120]  what the mainstream media is trying to do here's what the fake news is trying
[1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:19.760]  to do right now they're trying to convince you they're trying to convince
[1:54:19.760 --> 1:54:23.400]  us they're trying to convince the people that elected Trump convince the
[1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:27.600]  patriots that we're not winning that we're losing that we're behind right now
[1:54:27.600 --> 1:54:31.400]  when really since Trump has gotten in since we elected Trump we've been
[1:54:31.400 --> 1:54:34.800]  absolutely dominating we're absolutely winning we're winning it's like we're
[1:54:34.800 --> 1:54:39.480]  winning 49 to nothing and the media is trying to tell us that we're losing 49
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:43.520]  nothing when the scoreboard clearly says patriots 49 Clinton crime family and
[1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:47.360]  her constituents nothing Nancy Pelosi zero a complete loser Bernie Sanders
[1:54:47.360 --> 1:54:52.880]  loser and and so then every time any little development happens the
[1:54:52.880 --> 1:54:57.040]  Democrats celebrate and pretend that they're having victory folks do not let
[1:54:57.040 --> 1:55:01.560]  the mainstream media trick you that is like a team celebrating a sack that's
[1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:06.160]  down 49 nothing that's like a team celebrating a first down when they're
[1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:09.680]  down 49 nothing with two minutes ago in the fourth quarter they're an
[1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:13.640]  embarrassment they're a joke they've already lost the game and they're trying
[1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:17.000]  to convince you that they haven't they're trying to pretend they're still
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:21.120]  relevant so except the fact that CNN is dying except the fact that the left is
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:24.960]  dying and I think now we've got some new hearings that we might be upcoming on
[1:55:24.960 --> 1:55:29.320]  Loretta Lynch possibly maybe I mean who knows where this could lead who knows
[1:55:29.320 --> 1:55:34.920]  what Loretta Lynch might say but David I think that she's not gonna be able to
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:39.920]  get back in front of the public and have a testimony and just not answer any
[1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:44.000]  more questions I do not think a judiciary committee will hear it I don't
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:47.200]  even think her own would hear it I think now I really think Dianne Feinstein
[1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:50.720]  would even call her to task well let's hope that's the case we'll have to see
[1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:55.360]  clearly they've been able to do whatever they wish up to this point and of course
[1:55:55.360 --> 1:56:01.040]  Loretta Lynch was also involved in Comey in terms of not moving against HSBC and
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:06.440]  these other issue and he came to this position at the FBI from HSBC a large
[1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:09.800]  bank that was convicted multiple times for money laundering for the Sinaloa
[1:56:09.800 --> 1:56:15.680]  Cartel El Chapo as well as for terrorist organizations I mean Sinaloa even had
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:19.720]  their own checkout window where they could launder cash and so what do you do
[1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:22.880]  you take you need a new FBI director well you would go to the board of
[1:56:22.880 --> 1:56:27.240]  directors for that corporation with you if the same guy that gave Sandy Berger a
[1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:33.000]  pass for destroying documents at the National Security Archives after 9-11
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:36.040]  they wanted to have some information about what the Clintons had been doing
[1:56:36.040 --> 1:56:39.600]  with bin Laden and others and he goes in and removes that cash just as they have
[1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:44.960]  now transferred documents relating to this information they have transferred
[1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:49.360]  them to the Obama libraries and now you can't look at them for five years
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:54.000]  that's the way these people have played every game in order to obstruct justice
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  and we certainly understand what's going on with that well and and we were kind
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:01.200]  of saying this outside of the break you know even Brian Stelter who I think
[1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:05.680]  maybe has the brain the size of a peanut even Brian Stelter looks at CNN and
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:11.680]  says wait a second we created fake news we had to retract I'm part of this
[1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:16.120]  network I have a show I need to address this issue I mean and he can't get an
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:19.320]  answer he doesn't know what's going on well good for him because he comes out
[1:57:19.320 --> 1:57:22.360]  he has the integrity to say look I asked for this information and I'm getting
[1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:25.960]  Stonewall by my own network and remember it was just a couple of weeks ago that
[1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:31.040]  we had Zooker out there attacking Alex Jones and defending Megan Kelly even
[1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:36.520]  after Alex had put out the tape where Megan Kelly was begging him to come on
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:39.440]  the show and telling him that he was not going she was not going to do a hit
[1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:44.040]  piece on him and so forth after she had then released some preliminary interview
[1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:48.200]  stuff showing that yes in fact it truly was a premeditated calculated hit piece
[1:57:48.200 --> 1:57:52.760]  but it was Zooker who is now Stonewalling at CNN Stonewalling his own
[1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:59.400]  reporters about this and I think it's very key that CNN is now so concerned
[1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:03.320]  about talking about Russia that they have now said you have to get permission
[1:58:03.320 --> 1:58:07.360]  from a at a vice presidential level before you can run within these stories
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:10.320]  the Democrats are saying we've got to get off this Russian narrative it is
[1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:14.160]  totally collapsed for them it is backfired on them people are beginning
[1:58:14.160 --> 1:58:18.120]  to understand that not only was this false not only was this designed to
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:21.440]  cover up their hacking of the election but people are going to begin to
[1:58:21.440 --> 1:58:26.400]  understand as we do already that this is designed to cover up criminal actions
[1:58:26.400 --> 1:58:30.200]  committed by James Comey Loretta Lynch and others in the Obama administration
[1:58:30.200 --> 1:58:34.200]  part of the intelligence community being used as Watergate burglars that's what
[1:58:34.200 --> 1:58:37.080]  this is really designed to cover up we'll be right back third hour the Alex
[1:58:37.080 --> 1:58:40.680]  Jones show on shorter David Knight with you
[1:58:41.680 --> 1:58:50.000]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today
[1:58:50.400 --> 1:58:55.320]  more than two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what
[1:58:55.320 --> 1:58:59.240]  has been called the iodine conspiracy I've told you about how scientists have
[1:58:59.240 --> 1:59:03.200]  known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how
[1:59:03.200 --> 1:59:07.160]  the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding
[1:59:07.160 --> 1:59:11.400]  fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the good
[1:59:11.400 --> 1:59:16.360]  halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as
[1:59:16.360 --> 1:59:20.400]  it still is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and
[1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:25.920]  family now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the
[1:59:25.920 --> 1:59:30.640]  connection between iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying could
[1:59:30.640 --> 1:59:34.680]  be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these
[1:59:34.680 --> 1:59:38.600]  studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine
[1:59:38.600 --> 1:59:43.600]  is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen stock up on survival
[1:59:43.600 --> 1:59:52.000]  shield x2 today at info wars live.com or by calling 888-253-3139
[1:59:52.240 --> 1:59:57.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:59:57.720 --> 2:00:18.280]  well people are jumping ship from the Russian collusion narrative like the
[2:00:18.280 --> 2:00:22.040]  boat is sinking well that's because the boat is sinking and the real Russian
[2:00:22.040 --> 2:00:27.600]  collusion is on the Democrat side so what are they gonna do when this Russian
[2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:32.400]  collusion Russian narrative Russian hacking ship is completely abandoned
[2:00:32.400 --> 2:00:37.120]  everybody's jumped ship what are they gonna do when that ship ports and now
[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:40.160]  you have people saying that Donald Trump obstructed justice in the Russian
[2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:43.440]  collusion case but there's nobody even on board that ship so there's no case
[2:00:43.440 --> 2:00:46.760]  there what are they gonna do because that's the reality that they're about to
[2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:51.760]  face David well again I think that the real issue here moving forward at this
[2:00:51.760 --> 2:00:56.720]  point Donald Trump and his Department of Justice and if Attorney General
[2:00:56.720 --> 2:01:00.840]  Sessions won't lead with this there are senators like Senator Grassley who will
[2:01:00.840 --> 2:01:05.800]  he's been asking very pointed questions of Jay Johnson about hacking into state
[2:01:05.800 --> 2:01:10.600]  Department of State Boards of Election why would Putin even want to go and get
[2:01:10.600 --> 2:01:13.880]  the voter rolls in some of these states he has no motivation to do that but the
[2:01:13.880 --> 2:01:18.440]  Democrats do and we had these individual states complaining about it they had in
[2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:22.160]  February they said we want the president to say that this is not going to be
[2:01:22.160 --> 2:01:24.880]  declared critical infrastructure we do not want the federal government
[2:01:24.880 --> 2:01:29.960]  intruding itself into state elections this was a meeting of secretaries of
[2:01:29.960 --> 2:01:35.480]  state in February and then subsequent to that we found that the Department of
[2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:39.520]  Homeland Security had been breaking into Indiana in massive quantities so we
[2:01:39.520 --> 2:01:43.600]  understand that they're very concerned it's going to come out what they've been
[2:01:43.600 --> 2:01:46.960]  doing they have been the ones who have been trying to hack the election they
[2:01:46.960 --> 2:01:50.480]  are the ones who have broken the law they are the ones who have committed
[2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:54.960]  obstruction of justice and now they need to go on the offensive this phony
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:59.080]  narrative which was designed to cover that up it was not only designed to try
[2:01:59.080 --> 2:02:03.160]  to hamstring President Trump to try to get a process crime against him it was
[2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:07.120]  designed to cover up their criminal actions and it's about time those
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:10.640]  criminal actions come out because that's really what is at the bottom of all of
[2:02:10.640 --> 2:02:14.120]  this if you guys could pull that story up that you just had that I don't I don't
[2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:17.960]  know who printed that story I never saw it no the one claiming that the Trump
[2:02:17.960 --> 2:02:22.040]  obstruction case is gathering momentum this is hilarious to me see this I'm
[2:02:22.040 --> 2:02:26.760]  talking about it's it's losing all momentum it never really had any
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:30.280]  momentum every time there's a new hearing a new testimony whether it be
[2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:35.360]  Sessions J. Johnson James Comey whoever it is it kills any momentum that it
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:39.400]  never had and so they're continuing to push the ship into Harbor they're
[2:02:39.400 --> 2:02:43.120]  continuing to want to port this ship hoping that when it ports they can
[2:02:43.120 --> 2:02:47.040]  claim that he obstructed justice but no one will be on the ship it'll be a ghost
[2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:50.680]  ship it'll be halfway there was ever any obstruction of justice because from
[2:02:50.680 --> 2:02:55.460]  Comey's own testimony if you listen to him as multiple sworn testimonies he
[2:02:55.460 --> 2:02:59.120]  can contradicts himself contradicts himself so he essentially committed
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:03.920]  perjury with that but when he said well you know no he never I've never had
[2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:07.160]  anybody try to shut down investigation for political purposes that would be a
[2:03:07.160 --> 2:03:10.080]  big deal he said that on earth then he comes back and goes well you know I
[2:03:10.080 --> 2:03:15.160]  think he really wanted me to shut that down so we need to take a look at that
[2:03:15.160 --> 2:03:19.880]  and yet if that were the case he would be contradicting himself at the same time
[2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:24.720]  Owen what he said was Donald Trump had said to him I want you to get all look
[2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:27.520]  into all these different peripheral issues of satellite people and so forth
[2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:30.960]  and so on so he's not trying to obstruct justice he appointed a special
[2:03:30.960 --> 2:03:35.400]  prosecutor who was hostile to him who was politically involved with the swamp
[2:03:35.400 --> 2:03:41.040]  Mueller and so he did everything other than obstructing justice he went to the
[2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:44.880]  nth degree even according to Comey's testimony the fact that he wanted just
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:47.520]  get this information out there about the satellite people and I want you to let
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:50.720]  people know that I'm not under investigation you have bespurched my
[2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:54.280]  good name why won't you tell people that and as Marco Rubio point out it was
[2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:57.920]  open secret Comey had told that to all the other senators he said everybody
[2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:01.400]  here knew that Donald Trump was not under investigation why is that the one
[2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:05.360]  thing that did not leak out of here was what you were telling everybody that he
[2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:08.560]  was not under investigation so the obstruction charges against Donald
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:11.800]  Trump are not going to go anywhere there's absolutely no legal basis for it
[2:04:11.800 --> 2:04:16.200]  there's no testimonial basis for it but there are there is a basis for
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:19.920]  obstruction of justice by Comey by letter Loretta Lynch by the Obama
[2:04:19.920 --> 2:04:23.840]  administration and the law was violated by the intelligence and law enforcement
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:27.320]  community the FBI and the intelligence community you know quite frankly Owen
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:31.760]  it's absolutely amazing to me that for so many years nobody would even talk
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:35.840]  about the NSA it was always called no such agency yet this time we had people
[2:04:35.840 --> 2:04:39.200]  who were head of the NSA head of these intelligence agencies coming out as
[2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:44.120]  political operatives publicly trashing Donald Trump I mean that's how open they
[2:04:44.120 --> 2:04:47.320]  are about this political corruption that they have sucked to and then Comey
[2:04:47.320 --> 2:04:50.440]  says well I've never had anyone interfere with an investigation that would be a
[2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:54.480]  big deal but then admits that Loretta Lynch wanted to handle the Hillary
[2:04:54.480 --> 2:04:57.800]  Clinton thing as a matter and not investigation so I think you did actually
[2:04:57.800 --> 2:05:02.760]  James Comey right Loretta Lynch contradict himself Wow you're going to
[2:05:02.760 --> 2:05:07.760]  love the latest idea out of the EU Scott Keller a German member of the European
[2:05:07.760 --> 2:05:12.080]  Parliament and of the Green Party so we should transplant entire villages from
[2:05:12.080 --> 2:05:15.960]  Syria to Germany and that would encourage more migrants to enter Germany
[2:05:15.960 --> 2:05:20.600]  listen to these quotes the idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we
[2:05:20.600 --> 2:05:24.480]  can use for example if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has
[2:05:24.480 --> 2:05:28.240]  no other refugees people would rather go where compatriots already live which
[2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:32.720]  makes integration and acceptance easier let's look at these three compatriots
[2:05:32.720 --> 2:05:36.480]  from Paul Joseph Watson Sweden migrants viciously beat disabled man while
[2:05:36.480 --> 2:05:40.000]  calling him racist three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:43.200]  homeless man's wallet in a train station during an incident which took place
[2:05:43.200 --> 2:05:46.000]  last month the handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:49.320]  vicious uppercut as one of the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and
[2:05:49.320 --> 2:05:53.600]  how all Swedes were racist now how's that for acceptance you can read both

[2:09:49.720 --> 2:09:52.480]  can't put your finger on it the doctors don't really know what to do you know
[2:09:52.480 --> 2:09:56.320]  and we've got products at info wars.com that address this we had a caller last
[2:09:56.320 --> 2:09:59.560]  night say that his mother was suffering from dementia that's never really got
[2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:02.160]  any answers from doctors never really got any answer from pharmaceutical just
[2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:06.400]  continue to get worse claims that she tried brain force and survival shield x2
[2:10:06.400 --> 2:10:10.520]  and now she's actually having an uptick she's actually gaining more consciousness
[2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:13.960]  an unbelievable story David Knight over here today he's got a cough it's been

[2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:50.080]  covering the relocation the clash of civilizations and what that all means
[2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:53.080]  what started it the phony wars and how they're bringing that to Europe in the
[2:10:53.080 --> 2:10:56.160]  United States Michael springman thank you so much for joining us the book
[2:10:56.160 --> 2:11:00.800]  goodbye Europe hello chaos thanks for joining us today I'm happy to be here I
[2:11:00.800 --> 2:11:04.600]  appreciate the invitation you know it's kind of interesting Michael that that
[2:11:04.600 --> 2:11:07.840]  you would come on today because today with the Supreme Court talking about the
[2:11:07.840 --> 2:11:10.680]  travel ban everything this is something that goes back to your first book I
[2:11:10.680 --> 2:11:16.080]  want to revisit that just briefly you had a book before visas for Al Qaeda CIA
[2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:21.080]  handouts that rocked the world and this is an insider's view and the original
[2:11:21.080 --> 2:11:24.600]  book that you had without a few years ago you were talking about the fact that
[2:11:24.600 --> 2:11:27.560]  you were working with the State Department your diplomat with the
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:31.280]  Foreign Service you were posted various countries Germany India but it was in
[2:11:31.280 --> 2:11:36.960]  Saudi Arabia that you came across a lot of individuals that you refused visas
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:40.560]  to you knew that they were not qualified for travel to the United States and yet
[2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:47.480]  you routinely saw that overruled and it was by the CIA at the CIA's direction
[2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:53.520]  wasn't it exactly I found out once I was out of the Foreign Service that this
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:57.320]  whole thing had been cooked up by the Central Intelligence Agency and the
[2:11:57.320 --> 2:12:01.800]  State Department and of some 20 Americans at the Consulate of Jetta where I
[2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:07.600]  was assigned as head of the visa section that the only three Americans who
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:12.760]  the best of my knowledge including myself who had no ties with the Central
[2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:16.640]  Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency so that's the kind of
[2:12:16.640 --> 2:12:19.640]  compartmentalization that we typically see you've got somebody there who's
[2:12:19.640 --> 2:12:23.040]  honestly trying to do their job you're looking at these people's qualifications
[2:12:23.040 --> 2:12:28.480]  and go no way this guy's not should not be traveling to the United States and
[2:12:28.480 --> 2:12:32.360]  then you reject that and then you get this series of people coming in what
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:35.600]  they do they kind of lean on you and tell you I think you should reconsider
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:39.880]  this or what what they do well initially it was well it's your decision but we
[2:12:39.880 --> 2:12:44.560]  want to make sure we get this guy into the states he's with contact he's done
[2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:49.800]  things for the Consulate etc and then it develops into if you don't issue the
[2:12:49.800 --> 2:12:52.920]  visa you're not gonna be working for the State Department anymore you're gonna
[2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:57.360]  get fired wow yeah so that's that's what we have seen now this has evolved now
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:01.640]  over the years your new book is Goodbye Europe Hello Chaos Subtitle
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:07.600]  Merkel's Migrant Bomb and that's precisely what we understand this is as
[2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:10.400]  we see this kind of regime change happening throughout Europe here's from
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:15.520]  your forward to your book if you really want to help refugees stop feeding them
[2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:19.880]  let a few of them die of starvation war injuries and disease on the sidewalks of
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:23.520]  Western Europe then go organize the ensuing public outrage to pressure the
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:28.880]  governments to stop the wars that's regime changes responsible for producing
[2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:32.720]  such refugee streams if you keep taking them in and feeding them you're
[2:13:32.720 --> 2:13:37.000]  complicit in cooperating with the aggressor because you aid and a bet in
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:41.080]  the process of them becoming permanently dislodged from their countries you are
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:45.400]  helping the aggressor win and that was from 1992 and those are words of a an
[2:13:45.400 --> 2:13:48.880]  emergency physician you point out that really unsettled you because that's
[2:13:48.880 --> 2:13:53.000]  pretty harsh words to say just let these people die in the streets it's
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:57.280]  because people don't understand the entire where this is all beginning and
[2:13:57.280 --> 2:14:00.720]  what is happening in their countries what is so horrific there and they don't
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:05.520]  understand now that these people are being brought in in massive unrestrained
[2:14:05.520 --> 2:14:09.680]  unvetted numbers and this is something that you have seen and now a tradition
[2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:12.800]  that you've seen throughout your entire career not only not vetting people
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:16.360]  because they're coming in you believe that they are perhaps violent
[2:14:16.360 --> 2:14:19.920]  individuals no no the CIA says bring them in and now they're doing it in such
[2:14:19.920 --> 2:14:23.880]  massive numbers that it's going to be the destruction of the West if we don't
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:29.720]  stop that and you trace this back to its origins as regime change exactly right
[2:14:29.720 --> 2:14:36.560]  yeah I had been in Jeddah and seen this and then I guess a year or two ago a
[2:14:36.560 --> 2:14:42.040]  friend of mine Sylvia Gell-Mack who supplied some research in the forward
[2:14:42.040 --> 2:14:45.800]  for the new book Goodbye Europe began talking to me about what was happening
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:50.160]  in Europe and sending me clips and newspaper articles and so on and I was
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:55.280]  astonished and it was the same line they were giving the Europeans as had been
[2:14:55.280 --> 2:14:59.560]  given to the United States for the last couple of decades oh these poor people
[2:14:59.560 --> 2:15:03.160]  they just want to leave a terrible homeland and come to our country and
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:07.960]  work for a living and live the good life and pay taxes and enjoy themselves and
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:13.960]  nobody pays any attention to well what about taking jobs away from the natives
[2:15:13.960 --> 2:15:19.880]  what about taking us taxes and and and funds for these people that should go
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:24.560]  to something else in the economy and so on and so forth yeah what about the fact
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:28.040]  that some of them probably genuinely hate your country because of the things
[2:15:28.040 --> 2:15:30.600]  that they've been told or the things that your government has done to them in
[2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:34.160]  the past including former regime changes that's right right you drop bombs on
[2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:39.480]  these people they probably don't look at America favorably as they should they
[2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:43.040]  don't necessarily don't want to come here and be a part of this culture perhaps
[2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:45.800]  they want to come here and destroy it one of the things that you point out your
[2:15:45.800 --> 2:15:51.240]  first chapter is weapons of mass migration and clearly it is a weapon it is a
[2:15:51.240 --> 2:15:55.640]  weaponized population bomb that they're bringing in when you bring in people and
[2:15:55.640 --> 2:16:01.560]  uncontrolled numbers and you stop the vetting of those people then what you
[2:16:01.560 --> 2:16:05.480]  have done as you've essentially created an invasion of your own country by your
[2:16:05.480 --> 2:16:11.480]  own government to destroy that country isn't it exactly right that's what one
[2:16:11.480 --> 2:16:14.920]  former justice on the German constitutional court said about the
[2:16:14.920 --> 2:16:18.440]  German government and Angela Merkel she said that they're in her entire
[2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:23.160]  government and violated oath of office to protect and defend the people of
[2:16:23.160 --> 2:16:26.960]  Germany to preserve territorial integrity and provide for the common
[2:16:26.960 --> 2:16:32.680]  welfare and when this wave of migrants hit when they tweeted in August 25th I
[2:16:32.680 --> 2:16:39.600]  guess was 2015 that we're not going to be enforcing the the Dublin rule where
[2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:45.120]  you had to apply for asylum in the first European community country you entered
[2:16:45.120 --> 2:16:49.680]  well that was it the floodgates opened and 10,000 refugees swarmed across the
[2:16:49.680 --> 2:16:55.840]  Hungarian border mm-hmm Michael your book has covered this you've had books in
[2:16:55.840 --> 2:16:59.320]  the past the forward that David just wrote in this most recent book again he
[2:16:59.320 --> 2:17:05.360]  said that was from 1992 it's amazing how is it that so many people saw this
[2:17:05.360 --> 2:17:09.360]  coming I mean there were so many people they wrote books you know that that saw
[2:17:09.360 --> 2:17:13.760]  this class of civilizations coming long before anyone else did what were the
[2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:18.360]  signs that you saw a building to this that's gotten us to this point well what
[2:17:18.360 --> 2:17:22.720]  I saw in the beginning and that probably could have started the book maybe a year
[2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:27.360]  earlier but I was too busy promoted the other book the visas for al-Qaeda was
[2:17:27.360 --> 2:17:33.880]  that people were saying well yeah bring these people in they serious in a
[2:17:33.880 --> 2:17:39.440]  terrible mess Libya's in a terrible mess and so on and they began putting things
[2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:46.200]  up on television in Germany for example a cute little cartoon with a catchy music
[2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:51.840]  to it that to angry children saying no animal is illegal and the idea was that
[2:17:51.840 --> 2:17:56.560]  the they were going to start training people's minds from great school age on
[2:17:56.560 --> 2:18:02.040]  up to welcome these people with with flowers and candy with no concept of
[2:18:02.040 --> 2:18:06.880]  well what's happening these people aren't from our own culture from Europe
[2:18:06.880 --> 2:18:12.800]  from they're not Italians are not you the swabs they're not even Turks they're
[2:18:12.800 --> 2:18:17.320]  people from countries with no real connection to Europe except being
[2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:22.000]  conquered and being bombed either during the first Crusades or during the
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:26.240]  present Crusades with the the Americans in the French and the British bombing
[2:18:26.240 --> 2:18:33.160]  the living daylights out of Syria and Libya and Iraq and so forth and you've
[2:18:33.160 --> 2:18:38.560]  got a total misfit you've got a total clash of civilizations of religion of
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:44.560]  culture and nobody really knows how to handle it and when anybody does have
[2:18:44.560 --> 2:18:49.280]  complain in Germany for example or France or anywhere else they're attacked as
[2:18:49.280 --> 2:18:52.920]  neo-Nazis they're attacked as anti-migrant they're attacked as Islam
[2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:58.800]  amuseus they're attacked as the heirs of Otto Hitler and so on and so forth yeah
[2:18:58.800 --> 2:19:03.080]  they resort to multiculturalism and yet what the one culture that they don't
[2:19:03.080 --> 2:19:06.640]  want is the one that is currently there one of the chapters you have is
[2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:10.120]  destabilization without a purpose what do you see is the purpose of this

[2:19:16.200 --> 2:19:22.440]  Europe a unified Europe as a competitor to the United States and also as a way
[2:19:22.440 --> 2:19:26.200]  of splitting Europe in particular Germany away from Russia you've got

[2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:50.400]  this they have fought two wars against Germany in the last century to ensure
[2:19:50.400 --> 2:19:54.160]  that Germany was not a powerful state and yet Germany has come back with 80

[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:18.920]  some stories I want to introduce this segment with Michael Springman on the
[2:24:18.920 --> 2:24:23.400]  United States is about to send 4,000 more troops to Afghanistan we saw what
[2:24:23.400 --> 2:24:26.040]  happened the last time we wanted to intervene in Afghanistan it turned into
[2:24:26.040 --> 2:24:31.920]  a big poppy field operation and let's not forget it was not but a few months ago
[2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:38.360]  where Donald Trump dropped the mother of all bombs on Afghanistan supposedly on
[2:24:38.360 --> 2:24:43.600]  CIA tunnels these are CIA tunnels that ISIS was using whether that bomb was
[2:24:43.600 --> 2:24:48.720]  effective or not will speculate but then also you've got all this going on the
[2:24:48.720 --> 2:24:52.400]  CIA the US forcing all this regime change in the Middle East which is causing an
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:56.240]  influx of migrants into Europe and the United States what a double standard the
[2:24:56.240 --> 2:25:00.720]  left has sitting here saying Trump's regime change Trump trying to do this
[2:25:00.720 --> 2:25:03.680]  Trump trying to do that oh we can't have this Russia meddling in our elections
[2:25:03.680 --> 2:25:07.160]  meanwhile the United States does that all across the planet especially in the
[2:25:07.160 --> 2:25:10.360]  Middle East including violently Michael Springman I just like to hear your
[2:25:10.360 --> 2:25:16.840]  general reaction from the developments in this story well basically you said
[2:25:16.840 --> 2:25:26.480]  pretty much what it really is you've got years of Clinton destroying Yugoslavia
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:33.080]  you've got years of both Bushes destroying Iraq and Afghanistan you've
[2:25:33.080 --> 2:25:39.920]  got eight years of Obama destroying Libya and Syria and then you got now
[2:25:39.920 --> 2:25:45.160]  Trump continuing it and nobody has said hey wait a minute this is a continuous
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:49.320]  policy it began back with Jimmy Carter the Democrat when he and Zbigniew
[2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:53.800]  Brzezinski decided they were going to take on the Soviet Union and Afghanistan
[2:25:53.800 --> 2:25:58.720]  nobody questions this we all think that's a wonderful thing and they they they
[2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:04.920]  cry crocodile tears over Americans being killed and the cost of the war but
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:08.800]  they never think well what are the real costs it's crumbling bridges it's lead
[2:26:08.800 --> 2:26:14.960]  in your drinking water it's not enough money for healthcare and so on and so
[2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:19.560]  we put this manufactured crisis and that's the key I think for people to
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:23.280]  take away from your experience from your books talking about the fact that they
[2:26:23.280 --> 2:26:26.840]  were putting in visas for Al Qaeda that they threatened you with the State
[2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:30.080]  Department in Saudi Arabia saying you know you're going to prove these people
[2:26:30.080 --> 2:26:33.600]  the CIA wants them in here even though you said you can see that they were not
[2:26:33.600 --> 2:26:38.640]  qualified and now this what we see happening in Europe especially but it's
[2:26:38.640 --> 2:26:42.480]  also going to be happening in America the chaos that is being created the
[2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:48.280]  migrant bomb that Angela Merkel has there this is a policy by design and
[2:26:48.280 --> 2:26:51.800]  your experience in these two books that you've written here goodbye Europe
[2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:55.680]  hello chaos a new one it shows that this is policy by design we are not
[2:26:55.680 --> 2:27:01.920]  reacting to a humanitarian crisis this is a crisis that we created in order to
[2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:07.080]  further this globalism that we have here this migrant chaos that takes down
[2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:14.080]  the West exactly right you've got George Soros and his central European
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:19.800]  University for example collecting speakers of exotic hard languages like
[2:27:19.800 --> 2:27:25.160]  Arabic and Prashtun and Dari and things like this and using them as translators
[2:27:25.160 --> 2:27:29.720]  to help guide the the migrant way through the Balkans into central and northern
[2:27:29.720 --> 2:27:35.680]  Europe you've got big America companies like Cisco giving huge donations to
[2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:40.120]  organizations that help herd the migrants and in addition Cisco set up
[2:27:40.120 --> 2:27:45.320]  companies I'm sorry not companies set up Wi-Fi systems throughout the migrant
[2:27:45.320 --> 2:27:49.240]  routes in the Balkans to help guide these people from wherever they came from
[2:27:49.240 --> 2:27:54.280]  in the past you had to use topographical maps and take your chances on
[2:27:54.280 --> 2:27:58.240]  finding your way from one place to another but now there's there's money
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:28:05.200]  being given to these people to go from Syria or Libya or wherever to Italy or
[2:28:05.200 --> 2:28:10.240]  Germany or Austria or name your country and somehow they have money for cell
[2:28:10.240 --> 2:28:14.720]  phones they have money for the internet my own internet phone the the iPhone
[2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:18.840]  that eats up batteries like nobody's business yet somehow they have charging
[2:28:18.840 --> 2:28:22.440]  stations for these people they don't leave anything to chance do they
[2:28:22.440 --> 2:28:26.360]  absolutely nothing is left to chance and you have people like Hamdi Ulukaya the
[2:28:26.360 --> 2:28:29.320]  guy who is a Turk citizen he's on the Federal Reserve Board and he runs
[2:28:29.320 --> 2:28:33.160]  Chamani yogurt and he goes on and the mainstream media is complicit in this
[2:28:33.160 --> 2:28:37.280]  CBS has money goes well when I give them a job they're no longer refugees well if
[2:28:37.280 --> 2:28:40.600]  you did if we didn't bomb their countries they would not be refugees
[2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:44.920]  that's the whole key but it's about the people replacement it's about bringing
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:48.480]  in foreigners setting them up in business with massive American subsidies
[2:28:48.480 --> 2:28:53.360]  the same foreigners are then then go to Davos and push this mass migration as
[2:28:53.360 --> 2:28:56.760]  you pointed out don't leave anything to chance they make sure they've got a
[2:28:56.760 --> 2:29:00.760]  complete infrastructure guidelines along the way they don't just leave breadcrumbs
[2:29:00.760 --> 2:29:04.200]  for them they give them iPhones and charging stations to help them find
[2:29:04.200 --> 2:29:10.520]  their way through exactly and it's it's the Germans in the short run think this
[2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:16.200]  is a great idea because it brings in more people supposedly who will pay taxes
[2:29:16.200 --> 2:29:22.080]  into their social welfare system and that the people there will think well
[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:25.280]  yeah well you know we've got somebody now to take care of us in our old age
[2:29:25.280 --> 2:29:30.640]  because there are no Germans being born to keep the system running and yet they
[2:29:30.640 --> 2:29:35.360]  don't seem to realize that the solution is to promote the the normal
[2:29:35.360 --> 2:29:39.080]  population increase they'll take care of them kind of like Kevorkin takes care
[2:29:39.080 --> 2:29:43.160]  of people that's the way it's gonna happen thank you so much Jaik Michael
[2:29:43.160 --> 2:29:48.400]  Springman the book is Goodbye Europe Hello Chaos excellent book we'll be
[2:29:48.400 --> 2:29:55.080]  right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[2:29:55.080 --> 2:30:04.560]  GCN radio network the struggle in the DNC fraud lawsuit continues you've had
[2:30:04.560 --> 2:30:08.120]  the current counsel for the plaintiffs request that the judge provide witness
[2:30:08.120 --> 2:30:12.560]  protection that notion was rejected despite three mysterious deaths of
[2:30:12.560 --> 2:30:17.040]  potential witnesses in the case Seth Rich Sean Lucas and Barrington Wisenant
[2:30:17.040 --> 2:30:20.600]  Jr. there are also stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have
[2:30:20.600 --> 2:30:25.720]  this case dropped entirely despite the obvious glaring issues that the DNC has
[2:30:25.720 --> 2:30:29.280]  had over the course of the last two years while the lawsuit represents Bernie
[2:30:29.280 --> 2:30:33.920]  Sanders supporters who feel they have been wronged by the DNC Bernie Sanders
[2:30:33.920 --> 2:30:37.760]  has fallen silent on the issue Donald Trump tweeted out this weekend Hillary
[2:30:37.760 --> 2:30:40.960]  Clinton colluded with the Democrat Party in order to beat crazy Bernie Sanders
[2:30:40.960 --> 2:30:44.880]  is she allowed to collude unfair to Bernie so now Donald Trump has done
[2:30:44.880 --> 2:30:48.400]  more to raise awareness for the DNC fraud lawsuit than Bernie Sanders has
[2:30:48.400 --> 2:30:52.080]  who actually is the one that had the election stolen from him why is Bernie
[2:30:52.080 --> 2:30:56.440]  Sanders silent on the issue maybe I guess he's busy with being investigated by
[2:30:56.440 --> 2:31:01.600]  the FBI for bank fraud for info wars.com this is Owen shroyer it's not just our

[2:33:16.880 --> 2:33:20.000]  came in my ear in the break is that hey you might want to mention that Megan
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:23.600]  Kelly has failed for the fourth weekend in a row with her ratings I was like who
[2:33:23.600 --> 2:33:29.280]  oh oh her oh her I completely forgot she even existed you know it's funny the
[2:33:29.280 --> 2:33:36.040]  hit piece that she did on Alex is the gift that keeps on giving folks and Alex
[2:33:36.040 --> 2:33:39.680]  allowed himself to get drugged through the mud for Megan Kelly's little hit
[2:33:39.680 --> 2:33:42.920]  piece but it showed who she really is it showed her true colors and it's the

[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:36.000]  calls whatever it is you want to talk about the collapse of the left the
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:39.200]  collapse of the Russian narrative now it's actually looking like it's going to
[2:35:39.200 --> 2:35:43.400]  fall back on them the Supreme Court is now in the spotlight with the travel ban
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:47.760]  and some other issues that have been brought to the Supreme Court and really
[2:35:47.760 --> 2:35:51.480]  I think that the overall thing other than the left absolutely collapsing right
[2:35:51.480 --> 2:35:56.040]  now is that we are really winning right now David we really are it's not perfect
[2:35:56.040 --> 2:35:58.960]  it's always going to be a struggle we've got so many battles here in front of us
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:03.560]  but but right now the battles that we're all facing together we are having
[2:36:03.560 --> 2:36:08.440]  victory we know as weak as the quote-unquote Obamacare bills that they
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:13.240]  have coming out of the house in the Senate are the hill points out the GOP
[2:36:13.240 --> 2:36:17.680]  agrees on one thing Obamacare taxes must go and I think that's very important
[2:36:17.680 --> 2:36:20.600]  because you know when we look at what Obamacare is what is it it's mandates
[2:36:20.600 --> 2:36:24.440]  it's subsidies as taxes that's the way the government the Democrats approach
[2:36:24.440 --> 2:36:27.680]  everything isn't it you know when you subsidize something you're gonna get
[2:36:27.680 --> 2:36:31.160]  more of it but of course the cost is going to go up as well when you subsidize
[2:36:31.160 --> 2:36:35.720]  it when you tax it the cost is also going to go up you're also gonna get
[2:36:35.720 --> 2:36:39.080]  less of it so we have this kind of back and forth that we see from the
[2:36:39.080 --> 2:36:42.920]  Democrats and when you look at the kind of Obamacare taxes we're looking at they
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:46.720]  said the bill with lower government revenues by nearly a trillion dollars
[2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:49.640]  over a decade in other words we've got about a trillion dollars worth of
[2:36:49.640 --> 2:36:54.320]  Obamacare taxes and the pipeline here because of this and this is these are
[2:36:54.320 --> 2:37:00.280]  taxes on things like medical devices if you want affordable health care you're
[2:37:00.280 --> 2:37:03.640]  not going to put taxes on medical devices you're not going to increase
[2:37:03.640 --> 2:37:07.280]  everybody's cost with regulation instead what you're going to do is you're
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:11.480]  going to give people tax credits or you're going to give them tax savings
[2:37:11.480 --> 2:37:14.360]  accounts you're going to give them competition you're going to give them
[2:37:14.360 --> 2:37:19.320]  information and know who is providing what services at what quality at what
[2:37:19.320 --> 2:37:23.400]  cost that's the kind of reform that we need if we're going to have affordability
[2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:28.200]  we didn't market forces involved and when you look at Donald Trump's proposal
[2:37:28.200 --> 2:37:31.040]  it's very detailed for a presidential candidate usually we just get these
[2:37:31.040 --> 2:37:36.760]  broad strokes of generalized areas of the directions that they want to go but
[2:37:36.760 --> 2:37:40.360]  he had very specific market improvements under there and these are things that
[2:37:40.360 --> 2:37:44.600]  we've all known for a long time can actually improve the cost of health
[2:37:44.600 --> 2:37:49.280]  care you're never going to make health care more affordable if you just go with
[2:37:49.280 --> 2:37:53.360]  mandates with taxes with subsidies that you steal from other people that's
[2:37:53.360 --> 2:37:57.880]  never going to work but of course we say it says right here about 660 billion of
[2:37:57.880 --> 2:38:01.560]  that one trillion dollars over a decade would come from repealing and changing
[2:38:01.560 --> 2:38:05.640]  Obamacare tax provisions not even directly related to health care so
[2:38:05.640 --> 2:38:10.760]  they're just massive new taxes holding a gun to our heads forcing us to buy a
[2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:14.960]  product from big insurance that we don't want and that in many cases don't
[2:38:14.960 --> 2:38:20.040]  it doesn't even apply to us a single individuals like you an individual
[2:38:20.040 --> 2:38:24.600]  single male being forced to buy maternity coverage okay that's that's what
[2:38:24.600 --> 2:38:28.760]  they want to shove down your throat for you Owen you don't have a wife anybody
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:31.440]  that would need to have maternity coverage but of course they're going to
[2:38:31.440 --> 2:38:34.560]  make you buy that well and not only that they're going to make you pay for
[2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:37.560]  abortions they give all this money to Planned Parenthood and then they try to
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:41.960]  tell you oh well you know those funds that we get don't go towards abortions
[2:38:41.960 --> 2:38:47.120]  what who in their right mind look these people don't understand business that's
[2:38:47.120 --> 2:38:50.680]  honestly what it comes down to because maybe they've never taken an economics
[2:38:50.680 --> 2:38:53.480]  class which I'm not going to sit here and act like I'm a master of but I
[2:38:53.480 --> 2:38:59.000]  understand the basic economic principle where if you have X amount of funding you
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:04.160]  have priorities and you're going to take whatever allotment of that funding to go
[2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:06.720]  towards these priorities and then you're going to take whatever allotment of that
[2:39:06.720 --> 2:39:09.920]  funding to go towards these priorities well if all of a sudden you have this
[2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:14.200]  new group of funding that comes in from why well now your priorities can change
[2:39:14.200 --> 2:39:17.760]  can't they because you've got this huge group of funding here that you can now
[2:39:17.760 --> 2:39:20.520]  say well we're not allowed to use in this group we're not allowed to use for
[2:39:20.520 --> 2:39:24.520]  this cause but guess what now that we have this extra funding that we can put
[2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:28.480]  towards this now we've got more money that we can spend on abortion so even if
[2:39:28.480 --> 2:39:34.480]  they say here's one dollar here's another dollar this dollar came from private
[2:39:34.480 --> 2:39:38.200]  funds this dollar came from public funds what are you going to use it as well
[2:39:38.200 --> 2:39:41.920]  technically I can't use that dollar for abortion so I'll use this dollar for
[2:39:41.920 --> 2:39:45.360]  abortion but what if you took that dollar away would they use that dollar on
[2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:48.720]  abortion or would they use that dollar on some other care that's how it works
[2:39:48.720 --> 2:39:53.320]  that is that is typical business deciding how the to allot these funds the
[2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:56.800]  Democrats don't get it and the biggest thing to me is David just like with
[2:39:56.800 --> 2:40:01.120]  everything else the biggest attack that they have on Donald Trump and the GOP
[2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:05.160]  right now with his health care bill is it's taking away Medicaid it wants to end
[2:40:05.160 --> 2:40:09.560]  Medicaid Medicaid cuts people are losing their care the poor are losing this
[2:40:09.560 --> 2:40:14.400]  money it's all this stuff that was already written into Obamacare into
[2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:19.920]  Obamacare now Medicare costs were already set to be cut so they know it was
[2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:23.240]  Obama cut them they know the people are ignorant they know they don't read the
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:27.160]  bill they know they have no business experience and they feed them lies all
[2:40:27.160 --> 2:40:30.080]  day long and it doesn't even matter because we don't want this Trump bill
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:34.360]  anyway yeah that's right yeah it's absolutely amazing how they keep okay
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:38.840]  keep pushing this but again we're not going to do anything for health care to
[2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:44.640]  affect the cost in a positive way unless we start putting market mechanisms
[2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:50.000]  in there we didn't have a rising health care cost because the market had failed
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:53.960]  we had failed to have a market and that's the key thing we had failed to
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:40:58.040]  try a free market and and that's why this thing is going in the way that it's
[2:40:58.040 --> 2:41:01.800]  going I mean going back to the fact that we even have a third-party insurer when
[2:41:01.800 --> 2:41:04.640]  you start doing that and saying well we're going to allow businesses to deduct
[2:41:04.640 --> 2:41:08.560]  health care insurance costs but not individuals once you start going down
[2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:12.800]  that path you start removing any accountability and any kind of market
[2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:16.720]  forces away from it and then ultimately what you're going to get is to a single
[2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:20.400]  payer system where there will be no market accountability there'll be nothing
[2:41:20.400 --> 2:41:24.240]  to control the cost there'll be no incentive to save money because it's all
[2:41:24.240 --> 2:41:27.520]  just going to be folded into Washington and they'll just dictate that you buy
[2:41:27.520 --> 2:41:31.760]  it from their friends and the quantities that their friends dictate to you so
[2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:34.480]  that's what we're looking at here that's why it has to be repealed and the
[2:41:34.480 --> 2:41:38.000]  frustrating thing about this is how the Republicans have used this election
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:42.320]  after election as a wedge issue to get elected when they have absolutely no
[2:41:42.320 --> 2:41:45.760]  intention or plan to do anything with it and now we can see this very clearly
[2:41:45.760 --> 2:41:50.000]  these first six months here the Trump administration they never had a plan
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:53.920]  they still don't have a plan to do what they campaigned on for eight years they've
[2:41:53.920 --> 2:41:58.440]  campaigned on this well and we've already seen now the the rising of premiums the
[2:41:58.440 --> 2:42:03.200]  rising of cost the less options of cost the depletion of the market in the
[2:42:03.200 --> 2:42:06.320]  monopoly care bill that's called the affordable care bill it's actually the
[2:42:06.320 --> 2:42:09.520]  monopoly care so we're already seeing all this it's already collapsing on their
[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:13.400]  face and they want to try to demonize the GOP bill which we don't want anyway
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:18.040]  even though it's not even a law yet so this is just how they operate and you
[2:42:18.040 --> 2:42:20.960]  know one last thing Owen one of the things that Donald Trump said which is
[2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:23.480]  very very clear you know when he was looking at this Senate planning is you
[2:42:23.480 --> 2:42:27.440]  know it's a very difficult problem because you try to help one person over
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:31.480]  here and it hurts somebody else over there that's an example of why our
[2:42:31.480 --> 2:42:36.200]  problems not every problem can or should be solved from Washington even from a
[2:42:36.200 --> 2:42:40.640]  pragmatic standpoint blood loan from a constitutional standpoint when they take
[2:42:40.640 --> 2:42:45.520]  it upon themselves to solve all the world's problems then they rightly get
[2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:49.520]  what they deserve when everybody shows throws bricks at them for failing they
[2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:53.760]  will never succeed at solving our health care problems from Washington because
[2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:57.720]  they have created the biggest problem by breaking our marketplace by breaking
[2:42:57.720 --> 2:43:00.920]  competition by shutting down the information that we need to make
[2:43:00.920 --> 2:43:04.440]  intelligent decisions about purchasing health care well and I love this to they
[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:08.000]  they always want to say repeal and replace repeal and replace repeal and
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:12.320]  replace how about just repeal just repeal that's really all we need and
[2:43:12.320 --> 2:43:15.280]  here's and here's and here's that again just general economics that people don't
[2:43:15.280 --> 2:43:19.240]  understand they say oh my gosh if you repeal the health care bill how are people
[2:43:19.240 --> 2:43:21.880]  gonna get health care how are people gonna see a doctor how are they gonna get
[2:43:21.880 --> 2:43:27.800]  insurance look are you that dumb do you realize that health insurance is a
[2:43:27.800 --> 2:43:32.320]  multi-billion dollar industry do you really think that these companies that
[2:43:32.320 --> 2:43:36.040]  are selling this this this health care for millions and millions and billions
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:40.160]  of dollars are just gonna stop servicing the country do you really think that
[2:43:40.160 --> 2:43:45.080]  that that billion dollar industry is just gonna disappear no it's gonna go
[2:43:45.080 --> 2:43:48.560]  private and there's gonna be competition and it's gonna drive costs down
[2:43:48.560 --> 2:43:52.840]  that's how capitalism works that's how the free market works they hate it
[2:43:52.840 --> 2:43:56.200]  David they hate it and it's because they don't understand it and they don't
[2:43:56.200 --> 2:44:01.560]  understand that just because this bill gets repealed health care isn't gonna
[2:44:01.560 --> 2:44:04.960]  disappear it's going to come back stronger than ever yeah you can you can
[2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:10.480]  see it with humana and etna they wanted to merge together and they were losing
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:14.120]  money in the individual exchanges so they wanted to merge together if they
[2:44:14.120 --> 2:44:17.360]  merged together they were going to become too big to fail just like the
[2:44:17.360 --> 2:44:21.400]  banks did when they merged together under Bill Clinton and then they shut
[2:44:21.400 --> 2:44:25.200]  down Glass-Steagall so what they have done is they've used Obamacare kind of
[2:44:25.200 --> 2:44:28.480]  like Glass-Steagall to shut down competition and in the marketplace then
[2:44:28.480 --> 2:44:31.760]  they want to merge because they knew that the failure was coming and then they
[2:44:31.760 --> 2:44:36.000]  could force everybody to bail them out to buy their product and then when that
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:39.880]  didn't happen when the merger wasn't going to go through that's like alright
[2:44:39.880 --> 2:44:42.680]  then we got to get out of these marketplaces really quickly and that's
[2:44:42.680 --> 2:44:47.040]  what we see collapsing down the whole thing is just going straight down the
[2:44:47.040 --> 2:44:52.120]  path that we saw with the mortgage crisis failure an unsustainable fraudulent
[2:44:52.120 --> 2:44:55.400]  marketplace that is going to collapse and you're gonna have a few big players
[2:44:55.400 --> 2:44:58.920]  who are betting on the fact that they're going to get bailed out by the
[2:44:58.920 --> 2:45:01.920]  government when they collapse all of this and that's that's what I'm
[2:45:01.920 --> 2:45:04.920]  concerned about you know before we go to a call here real quick I'm glad that you
[2:45:04.920 --> 2:45:09.080]  actually mentioned that this was a story that came out on Friday a second
[2:45:09.080 --> 2:45:14.080]  even bigger foreclosure reaches NYC billionaires row this is a story from
[2:45:14.080 --> 2:45:18.320]  Bloomberg here and it talks about how once again these billionaires and some
[2:45:18.320 --> 2:45:22.280]  of these top lofts in New York their mortgages are getting foreclosed on
[2:45:22.280 --> 2:45:26.360]  because they're they're getting crushed right now in the markets and it's just
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:29.240]  amazing you would think that the left who hates rich people would be
[2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:33.000]  celebrating this you'd think that they would be calling us out of course
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:36.600]  they're not because they don't actually look at news unless it's on CNN or MSNBC
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:41.160]  and this isn't a good thing either the these mortgages being foreclosed on is
[2:45:41.160 --> 2:45:45.840]  bad for banking industries it's bad for the bottom line of the US dollar value
[2:45:45.840 --> 2:45:49.400]  and this is what we're seeing right now with all of these bubbles collapsing and
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:53.560]  they all got inflated by Barack Obama the mortgage crisis and the Federal Reserve
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:57.600]  they they are running and keep cutting interest rates hold them very low for a
[2:45:57.600 --> 2:46:02.520]  very long time and then just like we saw with Alan Greenspan they start bumping
[2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:07.200]  it up every single quarter until they can pop the bubble and already since
[2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:11.360]  Trump has been they they took interest rates down very low and held them there
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:14.680]  for a very long time and then immediately after Donald Trump was elected
[2:46:14.680 --> 2:46:19.000]  president we had Yellen and the Federal Reserve have now raised interest rates
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:22.640]  a quarter per percent every quarter we've had three quarters they've done it
[2:46:22.640 --> 2:46:26.560]  three times that's exactly following the same plan that we saw with Alan
[2:46:26.560 --> 2:46:30.600]  Greenspan and and this that you see here but this is probably a factor here
[2:46:30.600 --> 2:46:34.880]  these expensive properties probably highly leverage they've got a lot of money
[2:46:34.880 --> 2:46:37.960]  in there they're very susceptible to changes in the interest rate in terms
[2:46:37.960 --> 2:46:42.440]  of their marketability that's just the tip of the bubble that is starting to
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:46.280]  burst perhaps let's go to some phone calls now we'll take your calls let's go
[2:46:46.280 --> 2:46:53.560]  to Dustin in Florida go ahead Dustin well nice to talk with Yellen and David
[2:46:53.560 --> 2:46:58.440]  well you know my thing was about no leftist cannibalism you know it's like a
[2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:04.720]  yeah this one up and you know to see who's the most progressive and you know
[2:47:04.720 --> 2:47:08.400]  they've been they've been fighting with themselves for a long time you know try
[2:47:08.400 --> 2:47:12.160]  to put who's gonna be the head of the party you know obviously Hillary Clinton
[2:47:12.160 --> 2:47:17.480]  didn't work for them and now you know they've they've ravaged themselves and
[2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:21.720]  they're turning you know they're shooting you know representatives are
[2:47:21.720 --> 2:47:28.680]  shooting anybody who they can get behold of you know you see all these riots and
[2:47:28.680 --> 2:47:34.240]  it's it's it's very bad and you know their their violence is definitely one
[2:47:34.240 --> 2:47:38.760]  upping for sure and you know you have all these people you know saying they
[2:47:38.760 --> 2:47:42.920]  want to blow up the White House they want to kill Trump they're doing art to
[2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:48.080]  depict that we know decapitation they're you know just clearly ramping up the
[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:53.880]  violence and if it was to be on the opposing side or back when Obama or you
[2:47:53.880 --> 2:47:58.600]  know any other which way it would be unacceptable and you know there's just no
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:01.960]  tolerance and for these people who say they're so progressive and they're so
[2:48:01.960 --> 2:48:06.960]  tolerant you know there's obviously none there and it's it's very sad and it
[2:48:06.960 --> 2:48:11.520]  just goes to show you how brainwash you know yeah there's a lack of tolerance
[2:48:11.520 --> 2:48:15.440]  there's a lack of understanding a lack of discernment a lack of knowledge just
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:19.520]  just to be frank with you but I think that Dustin makes an interesting point
[2:48:19.520 --> 2:48:23.160]  here David where it's almost like they are there's like they're trying to one
[2:48:23.160 --> 2:48:26.760]  up each other it's like who can be the most disgusting who can be the most
[2:48:26.760 --> 2:48:30.000]  vile who can be the most violent and you would think that it would tone down
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:33.360]  after they see the negative side of no they keep getting worse they keep
[2:48:33.360 --> 2:48:36.960]  ramping up and just to make a golf analogy it's like imagine if you're
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:40.280]  playing it if you're playing in a game of golf and you know the guy you're
[2:48:40.280 --> 2:48:43.240]  playing with hits a nice shot and puts on the green and you're like oh wow
[2:48:43.240 --> 2:48:45.840]  that's a great shot I'm gonna I'm gonna put it closer I'm gonna stick my ball
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:49.760]  closer to the green but they're doing it in violence they're doing it in in
[2:48:49.760 --> 2:48:54.640]  distasteful comments assassination please I mean that's an interesting point
[2:48:54.640 --> 2:48:58.320]  from Dustin it's almost like they've completely gone mental and it's a
[2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:01.600]  competition to see who can be the most disgusting person right now it's
[2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:04.360]  virtually signaling in their little community whether it's Hollywood or
[2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:08.360]  whether it's the universities that they work in this is what I held up Donald
[2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:11.840]  Trump's capitated Ted look at me I held a whole play for a month straight that
[2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:15.280]  depicted Trump's assassination look at me I pretended to shoot Donald Trump in
[2:49:15.280 --> 2:49:18.920]  the head look at me I'm Robert De Niro I'm a tough guy to beat him up like when
[2:49:18.920 --> 2:49:22.240]  are they gonna stop you know one of the things they said about the Trump play
[2:49:22.240 --> 2:49:24.800]  the Shakespeare play that said what we did that with Barack Obama a few years
[2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:30.120]  ago I wonder if you went back and saw that play I wonder about the rodeo clown
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:33.560]  he lost his job he had an FBI investigation I think right well I
[2:49:33.560 --> 2:49:39.080]  wonder if when they put that play on in New York I wonder if they were
[2:49:39.080 --> 2:49:44.000]  celebrating and cheering when Barack Obama was murdered in the Senate like
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:48.200]  they did when Donald Trump was murdered in the Senate I don't think so I think
[2:49:48.200 --> 2:49:51.200]  they would have absolutely been appalled and I don't think that that crowd
[2:49:51.200 --> 2:49:53.800]  would have been cheering they would have been you know it's it would have been a
[2:49:53.800 --> 2:49:58.200]  heart-rending experience for them but they were using this and in New York
[2:49:58.200 --> 2:50:02.220]  Central Park they were using it to cheer look it is what they do in their
[2:50:02.220 --> 2:50:05.760]  community you want the respect and the love of people that you work with in
[2:50:05.760 --> 2:50:09.640]  Hollywood you say these types of things you do these types of things you try to
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:13.960]  outdo the other people if you start to defend Trump or if you start to say
[2:50:13.960 --> 2:50:17.480]  conservative things you're not gonna work in that town it's just that simple and
[2:50:17.480 --> 2:50:20.360]  the same thing is true in the universities as well so it's within
[2:50:20.360 --> 2:50:23.160]  these communities that they're doing I hear what you're saying David so it's a
[2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:27.760]  competition in Hollywood who can be the biggest piece of crap who can be the
[2:50:27.760 --> 2:50:31.560]  biggest piece of garbage that that is literally what it is Johnny Depp yeah
[2:50:31.560 --> 2:50:35.400]  he's a I mean he's got he literally puts he has a tattoo on his knuckles it
[2:50:35.400 --> 2:50:40.080]  says scum so he's a self-admitted scumbag he's probably a pillhead I
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:44.160]  mean whatever if you want to destroy your own body but then he makes ass nine
[2:50:44.160 --> 2:50:47.560]  comments because he wants to be in the headlines he wants to be the new bit guy
[2:50:47.560 --> 2:50:50.840]  I'm the big guy that threatened Trump I'm the guy that said somebody should
[2:50:50.840 --> 2:50:54.480]  assassinate Trump no you're the jackass that's gonna lose your job with Disney
[2:50:54.480 --> 2:50:58.040]  and no one's gonna go watch your movies anymore that's what you are Johnny Depp

[2:54:27.640 --> 2:54:32.360]  senior citizens all this stuff using these stats to then twist the narrative
[2:54:32.360 --> 2:54:35.360]  and say Donald Trump is trying to take Medicaid away from the people when
[2:54:35.360 --> 2:54:39.560]  again the health care bill is not even gonna pass it's going to fail it's
[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:45.480]  going to fail and Obamacare actually cut the Medicaid so they use these stats
[2:54:45.480 --> 2:54:49.600]  about Medicaid to try to demonize Donald Trump demonize the GOP health care
[2:54:49.600 --> 2:54:53.160]  bill that won't even pass when if you look at the actual facts and you look
[2:54:53.160 --> 2:54:58.600]  at Obamacare he was the one that wanted to cut Medicaid MSNBC man I'll tell you
[2:54:58.600 --> 2:55:01.680]  it's just unbelievable to see how these people lie and distort the truth folks if

[2:55:40.400 --> 2:55:46.920]  third hour let's go to Mike in Kentucky go ahead Mike hey longtime supporter of
[2:55:46.920 --> 2:55:52.560]  GCN Joyce Riley the power hour and Alex Jones local TV station has been on the
[2:55:52.560 --> 2:55:58.760]  air up here in Moorhead Kentucky yes since I don't know 2005 or something I
[2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:02.200]  was asked to help out in 1997 I immediately started getting that getting
[2:56:02.200 --> 2:56:05.440]  up with Alex Jones and started airing a lot of his video tapes you know it's
[2:56:05.440 --> 2:56:10.240]  kind of a public access station we're small but I think we have you know some
[2:56:10.240 --> 2:56:15.600]  helping and moving that the the effort along I'm sure that was very helpful
[2:56:15.600 --> 2:56:20.680]  yeah Alex used to call me a TV guy and of course as he's gotten bigger it's
[2:56:20.680 --> 2:56:26.080]  harder and harder to stay in contact with him but you know the FCC's want I think
[2:56:26.080 --> 2:56:32.080]  and of course the left is going after a lot of people they targeted Sean Hannity
[2:56:32.080 --> 2:56:37.200]  they took down Bill O'Reilly pretty much you know Alex has always been under
[2:56:37.200 --> 2:56:40.840]  attack I think and so does anybody that's been in you know in the truth
[2:56:40.840 --> 2:56:45.280]  movement trying to alert the public to the things that the status quo just
[2:56:45.280 --> 2:56:50.160]  would rather people ignore but now they're talking about trying to make a
[2:56:50.160 --> 2:56:54.680]  national example out of us we're in an impoverished eastern Kentucky Obama
[2:56:54.680 --> 2:56:58.880]  war on coal economy you know that's crumbling around and there's a lot of
[2:56:58.880 --> 2:57:03.280]  poor people that are kind of hidden you know there are a lot of poor people in
[2:57:03.280 --> 2:57:06.960]  this country that people don't know about and there's a lot of scam artists
[2:57:06.960 --> 2:57:10.880]  trying to raise money for people you know you actually Mike makes a great
[2:57:10.880 --> 2:57:16.360]  point here it for whatever reason the liberals only care about poor people in
[2:57:16.360 --> 2:57:20.200]  the inner cities they don't they don't give a darn about people that are
[2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:24.000]  suffering in eastern Kentucky they don't give a darn about people in Michigan
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:27.760]  they don't give a darn about these people in the flyover they didn't even pull
[2:57:27.760 --> 2:57:31.200]  the rural areas because they didn't care about them they figured well we don't
[2:57:31.200 --> 2:57:36.360]  need them we've got our ability to pad the voter rolls in these urban areas and
[2:57:36.360 --> 2:57:39.800]  so forth and we've got illegal voters that have come in and so we're working
[2:57:39.800 --> 2:57:43.120]  with that so they really felt that they could win without it they didn't realize
[2:57:43.120 --> 2:57:47.760]  the extent of the discontent in those areas like Mike was talking about in
[2:57:47.760 --> 2:57:52.000]  areas where they decided that they were shut down entire industries even though
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:55.440]  there are ways to work there weren't gonna work with people to try to make it
[2:57:55.440 --> 2:57:58.360]  cleaner if that was their goal they were just going to bankrupt that industry
[2:57:58.360 --> 2:58:02.000]  that was Hillary as well as Obama they made no bones about it my guess Mike is
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:08.000]  that your region of Kentucky is probably a major Trump supporters a lot of flyover
[2:58:08.000 --> 2:58:12.400]  country was and in a large part I think it's because of the data analytics that
[2:58:12.400 --> 2:58:18.680]  he purchased and Hillary didn't you know and society is being run like a black
[2:58:18.680 --> 2:58:23.880]  box and thank you for the call Mike and thank you for your support in the

[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:25.520]  I ran a poll on Twitter it's actually got 12 minutes left I'll retweet it
[3:00:25.520 --> 3:00:29.960]  right now who would win in a bare knuckle boxing match president Donald

[3:00:36.120 --> 3:00:40.480]  shows the liberal media these liberal Hollywood fascists are nothing but
[3:00:40.480 --> 3:00:45.600]  they're not even snowflakes they're like little like brushweeds or something
[3:00:45.600 --> 3:00:50.360]  just tumbling through the desert just nothingness no life nothing to them can
[3:00:50.360 --> 3:00:54.440]  blow over with the wind I got a lot of stuff I want to cover there's some
[3:00:54.440 --> 3:00:58.840]  developments in the Supreme Court today there's a video that I want to get to
[3:00:58.840 --> 3:01:04.560]  but for now let's go back to the callers let's go to Dylan who's been holding in
[3:01:04.560 --> 3:01:10.320]  Florida go ahead Dylan I wanted to mention a couple of things y'all been
[3:01:10.320 --> 3:01:16.160]  talking about earlier about the health care and whatnot y'all are talking about
[3:01:16.160 --> 3:01:19.800]  how it's not a full repeal which obviously it's not but since they're
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:23.880]  using the debt reconciliation they can't do a full repeal and I figured that out
[3:01:23.880 --> 3:01:29.080]  a while back and and before they started pushing all this hype about oh it's not
[3:01:29.080 --> 3:01:35.200]  a full repeal it's not a full repeal no crap we knew that already but at least
[3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:42.280]  it's you know if they don't do anything then it's gonna be a crisis
[3:01:42.280 --> 3:01:48.400]  politically and you know in the health care market so better to move towards a
[3:01:48.400 --> 3:01:52.920]  repeal than just what's interesting it's an interesting point that you make
[3:01:52.920 --> 3:01:56.920]  actually and I'd like for you to expand on that for a second you talk about you
[3:01:56.920 --> 3:02:03.000]  know the collapsing into debt yeah you look at any welfare system you look at
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:06.640]  any government system that is going into these heaps of debt just look at the
[3:02:06.640 --> 3:02:10.720]  state of Illinois right now which isn't even in the worst-case scenario I think
[3:02:10.720 --> 3:02:14.120]  California is actually in a worst-case scenario than Illinois Illinois is
[3:02:14.120 --> 3:02:16.880]  actually at least addressing their symptoms and looking for the cause and
[3:02:16.880 --> 3:02:21.240]  they're saying guys we're bankrupt here okay we are broke what are we gonna do
[3:02:21.240 --> 3:02:26.280]  about it it's the same ends to the health care bill it doesn't matter it will
[3:02:26.280 --> 3:02:29.640]  always any of these government institutions just like all of the states
[3:02:29.640 --> 3:02:34.440]  just like the federal government they will all be collapsed into debt they
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:40.320]  cannot self sustain themselves to explain that a little bit more I was
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:43.560]  just saying that we should you know work towards moving towards a more free
[3:02:43.560 --> 3:02:49.440]  market solution you know while there's still some type of market intact but
[3:02:49.440 --> 3:02:53.600]  isn't repeal the first move to do that though I mean how is repealing it not
[3:02:53.600 --> 3:02:58.000]  the first move to do that I should repeal it but I mean they can't they don't
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:02.800]  have the votes to repeal it yet right now but maybe after the 2018 elections
[3:03:02.800 --> 3:03:06.880]  they'll have more you know okay yeah that's a fair point thank you for the
[3:03:06.880 --> 3:03:14.560]  call deal that's an interesting point I don't know he you're probably right you're
[3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:17.880]  probably right he doesn't have the votes to repeal it because he has too many
[3:03:17.880 --> 3:03:21.120]  Republican stalwarts in there that actually want to get this health care
[3:03:21.120 --> 3:03:25.800]  bill passed so you're absolutely right and I think that that's why this this
[3:03:25.800 --> 3:03:30.400]  this vote coming up is gonna serve a second purpose which is showing voters
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:34.520]  who in the GOP is not really on the GOP Trump movement right now because they
[3:03:34.520 --> 3:03:37.720]  voted for this ridiculous health care bill that nobody wants so it will fail
[3:03:37.720 --> 3:03:42.160]  but it will serve a higher purpose I think in identifying some of these swamp
[3:03:42.160 --> 3:03:45.720]  creatures that are on the Republican side and voting them out and then as you
[3:03:45.720 --> 3:03:49.920]  said on the other end of this maybe once we have a a Senate and House that
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:53.200]  actually reflects what the people in America are thinking and feeling maybe
[3:03:53.200 --> 3:03:58.760]  we can move on to the next level let's go to Dean in Wisconsin go ahead Dean
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:04.280]  you know and how you doing yeah can you hear me yeah go ahead okay yeah no I
[3:04:04.280 --> 3:04:09.680]  just want to comment on the Paris Accord I've been saying this I called a few
[3:04:09.680 --> 3:04:17.400]  times about Trump's gonna finally have to break down his curtain and I on what
[3:04:17.400 --> 3:04:22.520]  the truth is he said it plainly exactly what the extortion deal was with that
[3:04:22.520 --> 3:04:29.080]  agreement believe me if he finally starts carrying out a truth on our
[3:04:29.080 --> 3:04:35.480]  sovereignty versus globalism he's gonna get 80 to 20 agreement and we can work
[3:04:35.480 --> 3:04:39.720]  for there and I like to go off about what you said about the Republicans if
[3:04:39.720 --> 3:04:43.960]  they think they're winning as a party they're wrong we're voting for Trump
[3:04:43.960 --> 3:04:50.800]  that's the reason was five and all no that's a good point it is Trump has
[3:04:50.800 --> 3:04:55.960]  trumped the two-party system to use a pun Trump has trumped the two-party
[3:04:55.960 --> 3:04:58.920]  system and the American people are behind him you're absolutely right we'll be
[3:04:58.920 --> 3:05:03.240]  right back on the other side with your calls Wow you're going to love the
[3:05:03.240 --> 3:05:07.680]  latest idea out of the EU Scott Keller a German member of the European
[3:05:07.680 --> 3:05:12.000]  Parliament and of the Green Party so we should transplant entire villages from
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:15.880]  Syria to Germany and that would encourage more migrants to enter Germany
[3:05:15.880 --> 3:05:20.520]  listen to these quotes the idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we
[3:05:20.520 --> 3:05:24.440]  can use for example if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has
[3:05:24.440 --> 3:05:28.200]  no other refugees people would rather go where compatriots already live which
[3:05:28.200 --> 3:05:32.640]  makes integration and acceptance easier let's look at these three compatriots
[3:05:32.640 --> 3:05:36.400]  from Paul Joseph Watson Sweden migrants viciously beat disabled man while
[3:05:36.400 --> 3:05:40.400]  calling him racist three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless
[3:05:40.400 --> 3:05:43.640]  man's wallet in a train station during an incident which took place last month
[3:05:43.640 --> 3:05:46.720]  the handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut
[3:05:46.720 --> 3:05:50.120]  as one of the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and how all Swedes
[3:05:50.120 --> 3:05:54.600]  were racist now how's that for acceptance you can read both articles now on

[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:39.280]  of the school day they'd whine about a bad call or this or that they have a
[3:08:39.280 --> 3:08:43.160]  hundred thousand excuses that's the state of the left right now that's the
[3:08:43.160 --> 3:08:48.400]  state of the left media complex the left government complex it's all the same
[3:08:48.400 --> 3:08:52.360]  they're having utter defeat utter chaos screaming in circles they don't know
[3:08:52.360 --> 3:08:55.040]  what to do they don't know how to handle it they've been lied to the whole time
[3:08:55.040 --> 3:08:58.640]  by Obama they were tricked into thinking that just because Obama was in office
[3:08:58.640 --> 3:09:01.400]  for eight years even though he stole the elections that that was the heart and
[3:09:01.400 --> 3:09:09.520]  soul of America no no no no no so please let's just collectively all take a

[3:09:27.440 --> 3:09:32.040]  fish out of water to look at CNN eating their own to look at Nancy Pelosi
[3:09:32.040 --> 3:09:35.560]  getting eaten by the Democrat Party and then she gets up and like I'm a great
[3:09:35.560 --> 3:09:39.160]  legislator I'm winning I'm winning we're winning when she's literally the
[3:09:39.160 --> 3:09:42.040]  biggest loser doesn't even know what year it is can't even quote who the

[3:09:48.760 --> 3:09:53.200]  the graphic up again that's why this graphic is perfect folks we are crushing
[3:09:53.200 --> 3:09:58.960]  them we are crushing them in the votes we are crushing them politically we are
[3:09:58.960 --> 3:10:05.880]  crushing them in the narrative we are defeating them they are dying we are

[3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:03.720]  gonna be a long battle I'm saying we're in the second inning of this battle right
[3:11:03.720 --> 3:11:06.880]  now just in in terms if you want to break down Trump's presidency into a
[3:11:06.880 --> 3:11:09.680]  nining baseball game I think we just started the second inning we're having
[3:11:09.680 --> 3:11:13.000]  great victories to start the second inning and the left is just completely
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:16.200]  flopping like a fish out of water all over themselves here's a perfect
[3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:23.720]  example this literally epitomizes everything that you need to know about
[3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:28.680]  the current state of the left Bernie Sanders goes against Hillary Clinton in
[3:11:28.680 --> 3:11:34.240]  the Democratic primaries Bernie Sanders clearly the popular choice out numbers
[3:11:34.240 --> 3:11:40.120]  Hillary Clinton people going to rallies about 10 to 1 Bernie Sanders filling up
[3:11:40.120 --> 3:11:44.160]  whole arenas Hillary Clinton can't even fill out a high school gymnasium okay
[3:11:44.160 --> 3:11:48.800]  Hillary Clinton isn't even winning the votes she's not even winning the votes
[3:11:48.800 --> 3:11:51.960]  but because they already rigged it with the super delegates she's somehow
[3:11:51.960 --> 3:11:56.640]  winning the nomination so Hillary Clinton steals the nomination from Bernie
[3:11:56.640 --> 3:12:02.000]  Sanders there's currently a lawsuit ongoing about that right now three major
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:07.280]  witnesses in that lawsuit have all died mysteriously and the judge who's
[3:12:07.280 --> 3:12:11.360]  handling the lawsuit won't even provide witness protection of course they're
[3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:16.400]  trying to shut that lawsuit down to begin with but these are people that are
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:21.680]  suing the DNC for fraud because they were Bernie Sanders supporters who
[3:12:21.680 --> 3:12:25.720]  donated to the DNC voted for Bernie Sanders and then saw that they never
[3:12:25.720 --> 3:12:29.200]  really had a chance anyway the election was rigged the entire time for Hillary
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:33.440]  Clinton why did you pretend like Bernie Sanders had a choice why did you rip us
[3:12:33.440 --> 3:12:38.560]  off why did you steal our money and give it to the rich so then that lawsuit is
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:45.400]  ongoing then on the other side of it Bernie Sanders meanwhile 100% silent on
[3:12:45.400 --> 3:12:50.840]  the issue now endorses Hillary Clinton won't mention the DNC fraud lawsuit that
[3:12:50.840 --> 3:12:55.120]  all of his constituents are behind now won't mention Seth Rich won't
[3:12:55.120 --> 3:13:00.080]  mention Sean Lucas won't mention Baron wise and ant completely silent on that
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:07.960]  issue 100% and so what's going on on the back end of it though Bernie Sanders and
[3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:15.440]  his wife are being investigated for bank fraud folks you can't write this up the
[3:13:15.440 --> 3:13:19.480]  only way that something like this can happen is organically if you're dealing
[3:13:19.480 --> 3:13:23.640]  with a bunch of scumbags who are who can't even figure out their own criminal
[3:13:23.640 --> 3:13:31.520]  enterprise together so that's nice Bernie Sanders calls Trump a fraud he
[3:13:31.520 --> 3:13:36.320]  gets investigated for bank fraud meanwhile Bernie Sanders voters are
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:41.160]  suing the DNC for fraud because they stole the vote from Bernie Sanders and
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:46.360]  he won't even address that issue but now here's a clip of Bernie Sanders trying
[3:13:46.360 --> 3:13:51.280]  to explain trying to wrap his head around for his constituents on why the
[3:13:51.280 --> 3:13:55.640]  left is male is failing miserably right now here's the salesman about the
[3:13:55.640 --> 3:13:59.800]  millionaires in the billionaires except me because I'm a millionaire now here's
[3:13:59.800 --> 3:14:04.440]  me complaining about why we're losing you think Democrats lost that special
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:09.160]  election in Georgia last week that's more than the special election for the
[3:14:09.160 --> 3:14:13.760]  last nine years Democrats have lost the White House we've lost now the Senate
[3:14:13.760 --> 3:14:17.840]  we've lost the US House two-thirds of Governors chairs are controlled by
[3:14:17.840 --> 3:14:21.440]  Republicans a thousand seats have been lost the Republicans in state
[3:14:21.440 --> 3:14:24.720]  legislatures all over this country and I'll tell you what I think is going on I
[3:14:24.720 --> 3:14:29.640]  think there is a massive amount of the moralization on the part of the
[3:14:29.640 --> 3:14:33.800]  American people with the Democratic Party with the Republican Party I think
[3:14:33.800 --> 3:14:37.520]  the American people in many cases are seeing themselves working longer hours
[3:14:37.520 --> 3:14:41.600]  for lower wages they're worried about their kids not being able to go to
[3:14:41.600 --> 3:14:44.960]  college they're worried about what's gonna happen to them when they are
[3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:49.400]  retiring they're seeing almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1%
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:53.000]  there is an enormous amount of pain in this country why can't you find a new
[3:14:53.000 --> 3:14:56.960]  narrative or anything does anybody in Washington know what's going on in my
[3:14:56.960 --> 3:15:00.520]  life that I'm 60 years of age and I have nothing in the bank and I'll be
[3:15:00.520 --> 3:15:05.160]  retiring in five years or that I have $50,000 in college debt and I can't find
[3:15:05.160 --> 3:15:09.760]  these guys literally such a joke it's going to the Democrats know it and I
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:14.360]  think what the Democrats have got to say is that we will be on the side of the
[3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:17.400]  working class I'm done with him turn them off I'm done I don't care I want to
[3:15:17.400 --> 3:15:22.520]  hear the rest of it that look I can't even take these people seriously anymore
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:29.040]  folks they are such a failing miserable joke right now literally a fish out of
[3:15:29.040 --> 3:15:34.360]  water flopping around for their last breath of fresh air completely have
[3:15:34.360 --> 3:15:37.960]  failed the American public and then you have Bernie Sanders up here I mean what
[3:15:37.960 --> 3:15:43.040]  a what an what a piece of work Bernie Sanders is I mean on this guy honestly
[3:15:43.040 --> 3:15:48.520]  this guy is this guy's I mean wow he mentions the Democratic Party and how
[3:15:48.520 --> 3:15:53.400]  they're struggling right now and they're having all these issues again ignores the
[3:15:53.400 --> 3:16:00.280]  fact that his voters have sued the DNC for fraud why is Bernie Sanders ignoring
[3:16:00.280 --> 3:16:05.800]  this why won't Bernie Sanders bring this up who did Bernie Sanders cut a deal
[3:16:05.800 --> 3:16:12.060]  with Bernie Sanders wants to talk about fraud this fraud that stealing from the
[3:16:12.060 --> 3:16:15.720]  rich are stealing from the poor to give the rich all this stuff meanwhile that's
[3:16:15.720 --> 3:16:19.520]  all literally going on right in front of his face within the Democratic Party and
[3:16:19.520 --> 3:16:25.720]  he won't even mention it he won't even mention it I mean I mean let's be
[3:16:25.720 --> 3:16:29.640]  perfectly real is this guy the biggest fraud that you've ever seen is this guy
[3:16:29.640 --> 3:16:35.160]  the biggest clown like I mean at least with Hillary Clinton she gets up there
[3:16:35.160 --> 3:16:41.200]  she's like yeah we killed you know we're responsible for the problems in Libya
[3:16:41.200 --> 3:16:44.200]  you know we killed Gaddafi you know she at least laughs about it you know she's
[3:16:44.200 --> 3:16:48.360]  a she's an evil witch okay we know that Bernie Sanders meanwhile says a
[3:16:48.360 --> 3:16:52.320]  millionaires and billionaires as he's a millionaire as he's being investigated
[3:16:52.320 --> 3:17:01.200]  for bank fraud and you wonder why the left is flopping around like a fish out
[3:17:01.200 --> 3:17:06.960]  of water they have no leadership they have no policy they have nothing they
[3:17:06.960 --> 3:17:10.640]  literally have nothing they have Obamacare they're clinging to that to
[3:17:10.640 --> 3:17:15.160]  your life that's failing miserably that they literally have nothing folks and
[3:17:15.160 --> 3:17:18.440]  that's why give me the Trump graphic again that's why this is how I'm
[3:17:18.440 --> 3:17:21.400]  feeling right now when I think about these people when I look at Bernie
[3:17:21.400 --> 3:17:32.400]  Sanders let's just take another call this is all you can do is laugh at these
[3:17:32.400 --> 3:17:36.560]  people now folks they are such a joke I mean honestly just tuning into MMSNBC
[3:17:36.560 --> 3:17:42.080]  it's just like you are so pathetic you don't even get it let's go to Eric in
[3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:46.080]  Alabama go ahead Eric hey Owen and David I've been
[3:17:46.080 --> 3:17:49.700]  uh laughing and learning with you guys for about two weeks now thanks to the
[3:17:49.700 --> 3:17:54.560]  Meg and Kelly interview I don't know how you can laugh Eric we have millionaires
[3:17:54.560 --> 3:17:58.720]  and billionaires that are destroying the working class and then you tell me you
[3:17:58.720 --> 3:18:04.600]  can laugh about this unbelievable sorry Bernie but yeah in case the media has
[3:18:04.600 --> 3:18:09.480]  not been accurately reporting it I've got the the opinion from the Supreme
[3:18:09.480 --> 3:18:12.840]  Court in front of me today and it's it's a great day I mean this is it's a
[3:18:12.840 --> 3:18:17.080]  basically a partial shutdown it's a per curiam report which means they
[3:18:17.080 --> 3:18:22.720]  basically don't want to provide the author and Justice is Thomas Alito and
[3:18:22.720 --> 3:18:28.720]  Gorsuch say unequivocally that they would have completely shut them down and
[3:18:28.720 --> 3:18:33.280]  they would have stayed all of these stupid injunctions in full and we this
[3:18:33.280 --> 3:18:38.600]  should happen in October the really only the only real victory out of this
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:43.280]  report for the globalist is basically if you were going to the University of
[3:18:43.280 --> 3:18:47.720]  Hawaii and then you went to visit your Syrian mom and dad you can't be stopped
[3:18:47.720 --> 3:18:54.720]  from coming back now so a very hollow victory if any should be reported for
[3:18:54.720 --> 3:18:58.880]  the globalists the night circuit got shot down and the fourth circuit got
[3:18:58.880 --> 3:19:04.120]  shot down John do bingo now that is the key right there Eric just hit the nail
[3:19:04.120 --> 3:19:08.240]  on the head think about it folks you had the ninth circuit court the fourth
[3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:10.920]  circuit court you had all these unelected judges all of these liberal
[3:19:10.920 --> 3:19:15.080]  judges all of these Obama appointees that were trying to stop President Trump
[3:19:15.080 --> 3:19:19.800]  stop the American people stop the Patriot movement stop this country from
[3:19:19.800 --> 3:19:24.200]  having a country I mean that's what it really comes down to so what does it say
[3:19:24.200 --> 3:19:29.040]  now what what is the move now how do we respond now when you've got an American
[3:19:29.040 --> 3:19:36.480]  unelected I would say treasonous ninth circuit fourth circuit Obama appointee
[3:19:36.480 --> 3:19:41.640]  judges that shut down this travel ban now it makes it to the Supreme Court the
[3:19:41.640 --> 3:19:45.200]  Supreme Court says yes President Trump is well within his legal authority to do
[3:19:45.200 --> 3:19:50.040]  this what do we say now what do we say to those judges what do we say to the
[3:19:50.040 --> 3:19:53.240]  ninth circuit what do we say to the fourth circuit you don't we say you're
[3:19:53.240 --> 3:19:56.800]  guilty of treason you know we say getting that stand and testify we know
[3:19:56.800 --> 3:20:03.640]  what you say you're fired it's been said any society is only three missed meals
[3:20:03.640 --> 3:20:08.480]  away from chaos those times may be near think about it our country faces
[3:20:08.480 --> 3:20:11.800]  multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea
[3:20:11.800 --> 3:20:15.840]  social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and
[3:20:15.840 --> 3:20:19.400]  city shutdowns and our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid

[3:26:23.680 --> 3:26:28.680]  and the left is completely in a tailspin right now that is really what is going

[3:26:48.280 --> 3:26:52.360]  even know what this clip is exactly but this is just another example the left
[3:26:52.360 --> 3:26:56.720]  isn't a complete tailspin they're losing on every measure right now and they're
[3:26:56.720 --> 3:27:00.320]  trying to think of any excuse they possibly can and they're really calling
[3:27:00.320 --> 3:27:03.040]  for violence as well let's go to that clip
[3:27:03.040 --> 3:27:09.320]  conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Alito on the court to take the
[3:27:09.320 --> 3:27:13.320]  position that the entire injunction should have been lifted
[3:27:13.320 --> 3:27:17.560]  horsemen of the apocalypse and they're waiting for the fourth one to come along
[3:27:17.560 --> 3:27:24.600]  so that they can go on their trend toward what I call extremism and that's
[3:27:24.600 --> 3:27:28.160]  exactly you know I'm not surprised at all that you of course is just right in
[3:27:28.160 --> 3:27:32.880]  there with Thomas and Alito and I want to do that to pretty much tell the
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:36.840]  president you just go right ahead impose the most thing back I'm glad that the
[3:27:36.840 --> 3:27:42.560]  other justices are not there quite yet okay well yeah we've got the four
[3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:50.200]  horsemen here apparently of the health care bill but you know Hillary invading
[3:27:50.200 --> 3:27:55.040]  Libya and then removing Gaddafi from power and then laughing about him dying
[3:27:55.040 --> 3:28:00.800]  and then the stand down at Benghazi on 9-11 let's see you got the fast and
[3:28:00.800 --> 3:28:05.960]  furious arms deal no no no you know what I'm sure I'm sure that it's Trump's
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:11.040]  health care bill that's the four horsemen of the apocalypse though but you
[3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:17.320]  know what in a way she's kind of right that dingbat from MSNBC that was a
[3:28:17.320 --> 3:28:23.480]  senator boy somebody just slapped me silly and these are senators we're
[3:28:23.480 --> 3:28:29.840]  dealing with she's kind of right because the four horsemen of the New World
[3:28:29.840 --> 3:28:34.040]  Order are actually coming God's four horsemen against the New World Order to
[3:28:34.040 --> 3:28:40.080]  take down your satanic regime so that's the truth of the matter but they're
[3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:46.880]  never gonna tell you that I mean what how am I dealing with these people what
[3:28:46.880 --> 3:28:49.760]  is that senator's name
[3:28:50.720 --> 3:28:59.200]  Maisie Hirono a senator can we pull up her Wikipedia or something I'm reveling
[3:28:59.200 --> 3:29:03.280]  in the complete collapse of the Democrat Party this is amazing to me we are
[3:29:03.280 --> 3:29:06.440]  winning we are absolutely kicking their butt this is like this is like the
[3:29:06.440 --> 3:29:14.520]  Patriots who who just won the Super Bowl Maisie Hirono a senator from Hawaii
[3:29:14.520 --> 3:29:19.680]  of course a Democrat let's find out when is she up for reelection in the mid
[3:29:19.680 --> 3:29:24.400]  terms we're gonna find out about that we might have to drain that member of the
[3:29:24.400 --> 3:29:29.640]  swamp but this is like saying well the Patriots who won the Super Bowl well you
[3:29:29.640 --> 3:29:33.240]  know they didn't actually win the Super Bowl because most people turned out to
[3:29:33.240 --> 3:29:37.400]  the second half so they didn't actually win because we turned the game off we
[3:29:37.400 --> 3:29:41.800]  we we shut down the broadcast so no the Patriots didn't win the Super Bowl no
[3:29:41.800 --> 3:29:45.320]  wait the Patriots did win the Super Bowl just because you say they didn't win
[3:29:45.320 --> 3:29:48.120]  the Super Bowl doesn't mean they didn't win the Super Bowl we're winning the
[3:29:48.120 --> 3:29:52.520]  Super Bowl of freedom in America folks we're on the March the Empire's on the
[3:29:52.520 --> 3:29:58.440]  run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[3:29:58.440 --> 3:30:04.880]  the struggle in the DNC fraud lawsuit continues you've had the current
[3:30:04.880 --> 3:30:08.640]  counsel for the plaintiffs request that the judge provide witness protection
[3:30:08.640 --> 3:30:13.000]  that notion was rejected despite three mysterious deaths of potential
[3:30:13.000 --> 3:30:17.320]  witnesses in the case Seth Rich Sean Lucas and Barrington Wison and Junior
[3:30:17.320 --> 3:30:20.960]  there are also stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have this case
[3:30:20.960 --> 3:30:25.880]  dropped entirely despite the obvious glaring issues that the DNC has had
[3:30:25.880 --> 3:30:29.120]  over the course of the last two years while the lawsuit represents Bernie
[3:30:29.120 --> 3:30:33.800]  Sanders supporters who feel they have been wronged by the DNC Bernie Sanders
[3:30:33.800 --> 3:30:37.640]  has fallen silent on the issue Donald Trump tweeted out this weekend Hillary
[3:30:37.640 --> 3:30:40.840]  Clinton colluded with the Democrat Party in order to beat crazy Bernie Sanders
[3:30:40.840 --> 3:30:44.960]  is she allowed to collude unfair to Bernie so now Donald Trump has done more
[3:30:44.960 --> 3:30:48.680]  to raise awareness for the DNC fraud lawsuit than Bernie Sanders has who
[3:30:48.680 --> 3:30:52.000]  actually is the one that had the election stolen from him why is Bernie
[3:30:52.000 --> 3:30:56.360]  Sanders silent on the issue maybe I guess he's busy with being investigated by
[3:30:56.360 --> 3:31:01.600]  the FBI for bank fraud for info wars.com this is Owen Schreuer Alex Jones here to

[3:33:29.560 --> 3:33:37.560]  for reelection in the midterms in 2018 I got news for you Maisie you're out and
[3:33:37.560 --> 3:33:42.320]  all you other liberals that are opening your big fat mouths thinking you're
[3:33:42.320 --> 3:33:46.760]  endearing yourself to the liberals of America that are dominating the culture
[3:33:46.760 --> 3:33:50.960]  got bad news for you you're endearing yourself to the biggest dumbasses in
[3:33:50.960 --> 3:33:55.200]  America who don't even like America and who are actually in the minority and

[3:34:01.120 --> 3:34:07.600]  there's a reason why Democrats have been trending down in the last eight years

[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:17.840]  United States presidency lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose because they're
[3:34:17.840 --> 3:34:25.000]  losers and they're so obsessed with their own agenda they're so obsessed with
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:28.960]  their own liberal mentality of self-righteousness that they can't even
[3:34:28.960 --> 3:34:35.480]  look at the world for what it is they've pulled the wool over their own
[3:34:35.480 --> 3:34:41.440]  eyes and cannot live in reality so congratulations to Maisie Harano you've
[3:34:41.440 --> 3:34:46.520]  had a nice run as the US senator from Hawaii you're about to be out that is
[3:34:46.520 --> 3:34:50.480]  my prediction right now and you know what I've got a short list here of the
[3:34:50.480 --> 3:34:54.040]  swamp it's not completed yet long work to go but let's just go ahead name some
[3:34:54.040 --> 3:34:57.280]  of the swamp members because these are the people that we need to vote out not
[3:34:57.280 --> 3:35:01.480]  all of them are up in the midterms but a lot of them are Mark Warner swamp member
[3:35:01.480 --> 3:35:07.080]  out Patrick Lee swamp member out Al Franken complete nut job out Ron Wyden
[3:35:07.080 --> 3:35:11.440]  doesn't pass the schmale test out pencil neck Adam Schiff he doesn't even know

[3:35:16.120 --> 3:35:20.880]  latest round of investigation into Jeff Sessions he exposed himself as a swamp
[3:35:20.880 --> 3:35:25.640]  member out Kamala Harris she's been under investigation she's colluded with

[3:35:44.360 --> 3:35:48.920]  Terry McCullough Bernie Sanders John Lewis Elijah Cummings and now Maisie
[3:35:48.920 --> 3:35:53.400]  Harano there's your short list for the swamp folks these are the swamp members
[3:35:53.400 --> 3:35:57.920]  that we need to get out of our government and I trust that the American
[3:35:57.920 --> 3:36:01.400]  people are seeing through this now and they're ready to charge forward and drain
[3:36:01.400 --> 3:36:08.080]  the swamp with and for President Trump to move forward with his agenda and you
[3:36:08.080 --> 3:36:11.520]  know I understand the whole notion like oh we need to keep Nancy Pelosi and she's
[3:36:11.520 --> 3:36:15.480]  such an embarrassment she's such a joke she only hurts the Democrats the
[3:36:15.480 --> 3:36:18.280]  Democrats are already dead the Democrats have already stabbed themselves they've
[3:36:18.280 --> 3:36:21.920]  already shot themselves in the foot they've already lost complete control of
[3:36:21.920 --> 3:36:26.560]  themselves there's they're in a tailspin I don't want Nancy Pelosi there I don't
[3:36:26.560 --> 3:36:30.480]  care if it's good for the Republicans what we need is what's good for this
[3:36:30.480 --> 3:36:35.480]  country and Nancy Pelosi is the last thing that's good for this country so I
[3:36:35.480 --> 3:36:40.200]  don't think that she'll survive another round of elections either folks 2018 is
[3:36:40.200 --> 3:36:46.320]  going to be very very very key as far as the midterm elections are concerned and
[3:36:46.320 --> 3:36:51.760]  sending another message to Washington let's go back to the phone lines let's
[3:36:51.760 --> 3:36:57.360]  go to Cynthia in Florida who wants to talk about Johnny Depp the latest
[3:36:57.360 --> 3:37:01.760]  disgrace from Hollywood to push for an assassination of President Trump go
[3:37:01.760 --> 3:37:08.240]  ahead Cynthia hey Ellen thanks for taking my call I just want to remind you guys
[3:37:08.240 --> 3:37:15.200]  that I don't know who it was and he was a Mark Dice did a thing on Hunter Thompson
[3:37:15.200 --> 3:37:20.560]  being a pedo and that he did children snuff film stuff like that and you know
[3:37:20.560 --> 3:37:25.960]  Johnny Depp idolized that guy he like shot his ashes into the stratosphere and
[3:37:25.960 --> 3:37:31.080]  he'd be like hundreds of thousands of dollars to do that so I don't know you
[3:37:31.080 --> 3:37:34.400]  are that's not they mean I'll be honest with you I'm not fully familiar with
[3:37:34.400 --> 3:37:38.840]  that story but it wouldn't be the first case what was it Meryl Streep or what
[3:37:38.840 --> 3:37:43.000]  was the name of the actor that was supporting I think it was a pedophile
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:47.680]  who got arrested and the name is slipping me right now guys if you could help me
[3:37:47.680 --> 3:37:55.120]  and I'm sorry say it again yeah yeah yeah yeah Roman Polanski if you guys pull
[3:37:55.120 --> 3:37:57.920]  that story up and then I think wasn't it Meryl Streep that was praising Roman
[3:37:57.920 --> 3:38:02.600]  Polanski at some Hollywood event so yeah it doesn't shock me of course we know
[3:38:02.600 --> 3:38:05.920]  about this Hollywood and pedophilia and all this they've been one in the same
[3:38:05.920 --> 3:38:10.080]  we've had multiple actors come out and talk about it I mean you know so yeah
[3:38:10.080 --> 3:38:13.640]  absolutely Johnny Depp is a total scumbag he's probably a pillhead I think he
[3:38:13.640 --> 3:38:18.160]  actually did regret I mean maybe he has a heart maybe he has a soul I don't know
[3:38:18.160 --> 3:38:21.360]  but apparently he regretted what he said because he saw how much people
[3:38:21.360 --> 3:38:24.760]  resented him for it and he apologized almost immediately after yeah there you
[3:38:24.760 --> 3:38:31.040]  go Roman Polanski's rape victim speaks out and of course Roman Polanski was
[3:38:31.040 --> 3:38:34.520]  somebody that was cheered by people in Hollywood I think it was Meryl Streep that
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:37.240]  was leading that cheer but I'm not positive about that so yeah it doesn't
[3:38:37.240 --> 3:38:41.640]  surprise me that if Hunter S. Thompson was a pedophile and Johnny Depp wanted
[3:38:41.640 --> 3:38:49.080]  to praise him that wouldn't surprise me one bit yeah also am I still on yeah go
[3:38:49.080 --> 3:38:56.400]  ahead oh yeah so also I also want to see about Bernie Bernie was paid to lose
[3:38:56.400 --> 3:38:59.800]  that's what it seems like to me he was paid to lose the election just like a
[3:38:59.800 --> 3:39:04.880]  put option on the stock market you know he was just controlled opposition he was
[3:39:04.880 --> 3:39:09.000]  yeah that's all he was they they so thought Hillary was gonna get in there
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:12.760]  they were so blind they I mean because they have no idea about the internet they
[3:39:12.760 --> 3:39:16.080]  I mean like they don't even know what a meme is you know what I'm saying they're
[3:39:16.080 --> 3:39:20.160]  like they're smart but they're so stupid and they're so involved in their own
[3:39:20.160 --> 3:39:25.320]  BS and they've been kind of you know like top you know top dogs for too long
[3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:30.080]  but they've gone away with so much crap that that they didn't even know that you
[3:39:30.080 --> 3:39:34.680]  know who's actually the demographic now who is the next generation like you had
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:41.640]  no idea and I think that I also think that they forget how much they rely on
[3:39:41.640 --> 3:39:46.160]  illegal activity I really think that they forget how much they rely on how
[3:39:46.160 --> 3:39:50.800]  they rig elections how much they rely on getting in non-citizens and then and
[3:39:50.800 --> 3:39:55.080]  then using non-citizens using rigged elections to win votes and maintain
[3:39:55.080 --> 3:40:00.000]  power well all of that's coming to a crashing halt and so they still have
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:02.640]  this thought in the back of their mind that that safeguard is there and they
[3:40:02.640 --> 3:40:05.720]  can still get away with all this BS and they don't even realize how their own
[3:40:05.720 --> 3:40:11.280]  facade is falling out all around them totally and like North Korea North
[3:40:11.280 --> 3:40:14.440]  Korea just seems like they're a Rothschild wildcard you know anytime
[3:40:14.440 --> 3:40:17.440]  anything's going down in the US or anywhere in the rest of the world you
[3:40:17.440 --> 3:40:20.200]  know you got to have like you know reminds me of that always sunny in
[3:40:20.200 --> 3:40:23.840]  Philadelphia Charlie Kelly episode where he's like the wildcard you know you
[3:40:23.840 --> 3:40:28.360]  got to have some some country that does something I've been crazy to kind of you
[3:40:28.360 --> 3:40:32.680]  know they're distractors they they're magicians they work by by distraction and
[3:40:32.680 --> 3:40:39.240]  they're they fancy themselves royal so they use you know places like Cuba and
[3:40:39.240 --> 3:40:42.640]  Venezuela and all these places that are total dictatorships to kind of like
[3:40:42.640 --> 3:40:46.680]  instill fear in the rest of us with ISIS like what's up with ISIS blowing up
[3:40:46.680 --> 3:40:51.240]  their own Mecca trying to blow up I mean that doesn't make any sense well it
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:54.000]  actually does you know that's a good point but it actually started to make
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:57.960]  more sense to me when David Knight was breaking it down earlier saying how
[3:40:57.960 --> 3:41:04.000]  it was used to be looked at that you know Islam was a political system and if
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:09.120]  you look at it like that if you look at it as a political system and not a
[3:41:09.120 --> 3:41:14.640]  religious sect it actually makes more sense it the infighting the constant
[3:41:14.640 --> 3:41:18.680]  war then it actually makes more sense as a political system than a religious
[3:41:18.680 --> 3:41:22.120]  system but that's that's that's an entirely different argument and just
[3:41:22.120 --> 3:41:25.640]  everything that's going on in the Middle East has just completely decomposed it
[3:41:25.640 --> 3:41:30.720]  was destabilized as part of a globalist agenda so you're absolutely right thank
[3:41:30.720 --> 3:41:35.800]  you for the call Cindy Cynthia excuse me let's go to Kevin in West Virginia go
[3:41:35.800 --> 3:41:43.800]  ahead Kevin hey Owen hey David how's the Zara world treating me I don't know but
[3:41:43.800 --> 3:41:47.680]  the millionaires and billionaire class have been robbing us blind even though
[3:41:47.680 --> 3:41:52.720]  I'm a millionaire that is now being looked at for fraud all right well I got
[3:41:52.720 --> 3:41:56.680]  a bombshell for you I didn't know if you guys were aware that there is a
[3:41:56.680 --> 3:42:02.400]  recording a tape of Hillary Clinton John Podesta the rice lady I can't think of
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:07.040]  her first name Connolly the rice and Pelosi sitting in an office and comey
[3:42:07.040 --> 3:42:12.240]  and and comey sitting in an office before the election talking about how
[3:42:12.240 --> 3:42:16.480]  they're going to drop the investigation 10 days to two weeks to 10 days out of
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:21.520]  the election if this isn't obstruction and if this isn't collusion I don't know
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:29.720]  what is you're saying that there is a leaked recording of a meeting happening
[3:42:29.720 --> 3:42:35.640]  between those people you just mentioned talking about the Russia probe yes no
[3:42:35.640 --> 3:42:39.360]  not the Russia probe but dropping the investigation the Hillary email
[3:42:39.360 --> 3:42:44.720]  investigation the email investigation cool it's the one that you need to get a
[3:42:44.720 --> 3:42:49.680]  hold of this is I've never heard has anybody heard this audio back there
[3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:54.160]  anybody of the producers anyone yeah nobody from here has heard it so if you
[3:42:54.160 --> 3:42:58.720]  have that source or you can send me something or tweet it out here something
[3:42:58.720 --> 3:43:03.560]  who Larry Larry Nichols has it Larry has it huh well okay I guess maybe we need
[3:43:03.560 --> 3:43:07.400]  to maybe get Larry Nichols back on the show then that's interesting thank you
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:11.680]  for the call Kevin I have not heard that audio I've not even heard anyone
[3:43:11.680 --> 3:43:16.720]  allude to having heard that audio I trust Larry Nichols he gets he continues
[3:43:16.720 --> 3:43:20.240]  to get proven right every time he comes on the show so I'm not discounting that
[3:43:20.240 --> 3:43:23.520]  that's the case that's just yeah that's a major bombshell that I've not heard
[3:43:23.520 --> 3:43:31.040]  anybody talk about and that is that is I mean that's literal proof of collusion
[3:43:31.040 --> 3:43:36.320]  if you have that audio wow that's shocking let's go to Taylor in Connecticut
[3:43:36.320 --> 3:43:43.560]  go ahead Taylor first I wanted to say thank you for everything you guys do be
[3:43:43.560 --> 3:43:47.640]  in the main sphere in the alternative media I voted for Trump because of you
[3:43:47.640 --> 3:43:51.720]  guys although I was concerned that the establishment might be smart enough to
[3:43:51.720 --> 3:43:56.320]  put in an anti-establishment front-runner but time will tell so far he's done
[3:43:56.320 --> 3:44:01.120]  good other than in Syria but in my opinion I wanted to bring up the divide
[3:44:01.120 --> 3:44:05.040]  and conquer strategy that has been going on for decades but has recently been
[3:44:05.040 --> 3:44:10.280]  ramped up over the past three to four years I feel that there's so much
[3:44:10.280 --> 3:44:14.760]  division between the left and the right and people blindly follow one side without
[3:44:14.760 --> 3:44:19.320]  looking at the big picture and therefore unable to realize a solution
[3:44:19.320 --> 3:44:22.520]  well think about it like this think about it like this because I understand
[3:44:22.520 --> 3:44:25.400]  where you're going with this at least I think I do it and I'll take your
[3:44:25.400 --> 3:44:31.320]  comments after I finish my statement divide and conquer oldest trick in the
[3:44:31.320 --> 3:44:36.840]  book we all understand it we all understand the Psyop we all see it we
[3:44:36.840 --> 3:44:43.040]  know it's been going on for a long time so what is the solution what is the
[3:44:43.040 --> 3:44:47.280]  proper response how do we beat the divide and conquer will people say find
[3:44:47.280 --> 3:44:51.360]  common ground find stuff that we can get all get all get on board with and and
[3:44:51.360 --> 3:44:56.880]  see if we can move forward on that well unfortunately I think the instances or
[3:44:56.880 --> 3:45:01.080]  the cases or the examples where you think that you could get everybody behind
[3:45:01.080 --> 3:45:05.760]  something for example a Hillary Clinton clearly corrupt with her private email
[3:45:05.760 --> 3:45:10.400]  server James Comey's inditing her and then not it verbally in dining her and
[3:45:10.400 --> 3:45:14.320]  then not in dining her they can't get along on that so but but let's even go
[3:45:14.320 --> 3:45:18.640]  one step further let's even go more broad spectrum
[3:45:18.640 --> 3:45:24.360]  why can't we all come together as Americans why can't the left and the
[3:45:24.360 --> 3:45:30.360]  right find common ground in being an American why can't no matter where you
[3:45:30.360 --> 3:45:35.720]  come from left right up down center why can't we beat the divide and conquer by
[3:45:35.720 --> 3:45:39.920]  coming together on the common ground that we are Americans this is our
[3:45:39.920 --> 3:45:44.440]  country our lineage our forefathers everybody had to suffer through
[3:45:44.440 --> 3:45:48.840]  something for for hundreds of years to get us to this point where despite our
[3:45:48.840 --> 3:45:54.080]  shortcomings despite our evils despite all the problems we still could be the
[3:45:54.080 --> 3:45:59.560]  greatest country in the world with the most freedoms so you say why can't we
[3:45:59.560 --> 3:46:06.160]  come together everyone as Americans to make this country better but the answer
[3:46:06.160 --> 3:46:12.320]  is obvious because the left hates America the left is not interested in
[3:46:12.320 --> 3:46:17.000]  being an American citizen the left is not interested in showing American pride
[3:46:17.000 --> 3:46:21.360]  the left does not want to unite behind the United States of America they've
[3:46:21.360 --> 3:46:26.000]  been conditioned they've been trained they've been lied to and now they hate
[3:46:26.000 --> 3:46:30.360]  America they hate America and that's because they don't understand that again
[3:46:30.360 --> 3:46:34.640]  despite all the things that are wrong with this country despite all of the
[3:46:34.640 --> 3:46:38.040]  things that we've done that that we can sit here and look back on and say we
[3:46:38.040 --> 3:46:44.400]  shouldn't have done that that's not actually America that's America hijacked
[3:46:44.400 --> 3:46:48.840]  they don't understand that they don't understand that fundamental and they
[3:46:48.840 --> 3:46:54.120]  have no interest in uniting with other United States citizens because they've
[3:46:54.120 --> 3:46:57.840]  been trained they've been tricked and they've been conditioned to hate this
[3:46:57.840 --> 3:47:02.480]  country hate themselves think of themselves as victims and so as soon as
[3:47:02.480 --> 3:47:06.480]  you think of yourself as a victim you handicap yourself you don't feel that
[3:47:06.480 --> 3:47:09.360]  you can keep up with the rest of society so you know what you want to do
[3:47:09.360 --> 3:47:15.160]  handicap the rest of society that's the Psyop that's their mindset that's why
[3:47:15.160 --> 3:47:20.360]  we can't find common ground with these people your response well I feel a lot
[3:47:20.360 --> 3:47:25.400]  of that has to do with back in the this has been going on for decades and
[3:47:25.400 --> 3:47:32.760]  decades the dumbing down with society I know our ghettos if you will kind of
[3:47:32.760 --> 3:47:37.520]  got to the point where they are now with back in the 90s the mainstream media
[3:47:37.520 --> 3:47:42.040]  which is the establishment which controlled a lot of the music they
[3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:47.640]  started a push pushing rap music that idolized gangbanging that's a CIA that's
[3:47:47.640 --> 3:47:54.560]  a CIA operation using MTV to to destroy black culture you're absolutely right
[3:47:54.560 --> 3:48:00.680]  and a snoop dog I mean yeah yeah 100% I feel like if maybe like these topics
[3:48:00.680 --> 3:48:06.840]  which are kind of the root problem root cause if we could maybe like educate
[3:48:06.840 --> 3:48:10.880]  people more more people try to start talking to people about it like as a
[3:48:10.880 --> 3:48:15.440]  white person I can't really go talk to black people you like hey you know you
[3:48:15.440 --> 3:48:18.520]  can't have that attitude unfortunately you can't you can't have that
[3:48:18.520 --> 3:48:21.280]  defeatist attitude I'm not I'm not discounting what you're saying or
[3:48:21.280 --> 3:48:25.280]  disagreeing with you I'm just saying you know if that's your attitude it's just
[3:48:25.280 --> 3:48:29.800]  never gonna be possible but I will tell you this trust me I understand what
[3:48:29.800 --> 3:48:33.280]  you're saying you've seen the dozens of videos I do where I go out on the streets
[3:48:33.280 --> 3:48:36.760]  and I talk to these people or I try to talk to these people and I either get a
[3:48:36.760 --> 3:48:41.080]  bongo drum shoved in my face I get spit on I get things thrown at me I get told
[3:48:41.080 --> 3:48:45.080]  I'm a racist this that other thing but with no foundation no no intellect no
[3:48:45.080 --> 3:48:53.160]  education at all but but you still try and I still think that there is some
[3:48:53.160 --> 3:48:57.520]  hope I do think because because here's the thing guys there's there's a
[3:48:57.520 --> 3:49:02.640]  psychological this is throughout history there's a psychological thing where
[3:49:02.640 --> 3:49:07.400]  humans want to be a part of the winning team you see so the reason why all of
[3:49:07.400 --> 3:49:10.440]  these liberals all of these lowlifes all of these people that have never
[3:49:10.440 --> 3:49:14.200]  accomplished anything for themselves in life flock to the liberal movement
[3:49:14.200 --> 3:49:18.160]  flock to the liberal establishment flock to the to the to the Clintons and
[3:49:18.160 --> 3:49:21.640]  the Sanders is because they've been tricked they've been lied to they think
[3:49:21.640 --> 3:49:26.440]  that's the winning team they really think that Trump is losing they really
[3:49:26.440 --> 3:49:30.040]  think that the MAGA movement is losing they really think that liberals are
[3:49:30.040 --> 3:49:32.640]  still losing they really think they're on the right side of history stopping
[3:49:32.640 --> 3:49:37.560]  Donald Trump the next incarnation of Adolf Hitler by going in this movement
[3:49:37.560 --> 3:49:43.120]  but they are losing and they're gonna realize it soon they can't be fooled
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:46.680]  forever so it might take a year it might take two years might take three years
[3:49:46.680 --> 3:49:51.320]  they're gonna realize that they're having no victories these are spineless
[3:49:51.320 --> 3:49:56.720]  people these are cowards these are here's what I'm saying they're gonna jump
[3:49:56.720 --> 3:50:01.040]  ship they're gonna jump ship as soon as they see that Trump has done nothing but
[3:50:01.040 --> 3:50:04.360]  wins since he's been in office as soon as they see that the MAGA movement is
[3:50:04.360 --> 3:50:07.400]  taking off and actually winning as soon as they see that all their liberal
[3:50:07.400 --> 3:50:11.920]  leaders in media and government are losers not getting elected again losing
[3:50:11.920 --> 3:50:15.600]  their TV deals and they have nowhere else to look for leadership nothing
[3:50:15.600 --> 3:50:19.160]  nobody who's come through for them nothing at all they're gonna jump ship
[3:50:19.160 --> 3:50:22.240]  and they're gonna join our side that's what's going to happen that is a
[3:50:22.240 --> 3:50:27.040]  psychological thing it always happens throughout history and the only response
[3:50:27.040 --> 3:50:31.680]  that the globalist might have up their sleeve is literally just causing such a
[3:50:31.680 --> 3:50:39.960]  mass chaos event causing such a a mass I mean you know anything they could do
[3:50:39.960 --> 3:50:45.920]  just like a 9-eleven cell event a dirty bomb a nuke some sort of false flag to
[3:50:45.920 --> 3:50:49.680]  try to stop the momentum from Trump winning to try to steal the narrative
[3:50:49.680 --> 3:50:53.640]  from all of Trump's victories and to try to put the focus back on the chaos that
[3:50:53.640 --> 3:50:57.680]  they want to use to bring in the one-world government so I don't know I'm
[3:50:57.680 --> 3:51:01.640]  just glad that we're winning and I'm not gonna be denied the Genesis

[3:55:32.880 --> 3:55:38.440]  or a terrorist attack in Paris well the answer is obvious a terrorist attack in
[3:55:38.440 --> 3:55:41.240]  Paris so that's what I'm gonna go with but of course we don't know they're
[3:55:41.240 --> 3:55:44.960]  still responding I hope that's not the case and hopefully everybody that's
[3:55:44.960 --> 3:55:49.120]  involved is okay and really hopefully there is nothing to see there but that
[3:55:49.120 --> 3:55:52.520]  is developing right now so I'm sure we'll have more on that on tonight's
[3:55:52.520 --> 3:55:57.120]  nightly news again the big story right now the Russian narrative is completely
[3:55:57.120 --> 3:56:01.520]  collapsing especially with all of the heat with all the war games going on
[3:56:01.520 --> 3:56:05.720]  between Russia and the United States and what's developing in Syria Russia
[3:56:05.720 --> 3:56:09.240]  narrative falling apart then they want to try to say Donald Trump is obstructing
[3:56:09.240 --> 3:56:12.040]  justice in the Russia investigation oh but there's nothing there so he's
[3:56:12.040 --> 3:56:15.720]  obstructing justice of nothing State Department is opening or reopening
[3:56:15.720 --> 3:56:19.440]  probes into the Clinton email investigation Loretta Lynch is gonna
[3:56:19.440 --> 3:56:24.920]  have to answer some questions as well so more victories heading in our direction
[3:56:24.920 --> 3:56:29.840]  the momentum heading in our direction right now not the globalists not the
[3:56:29.840 --> 3:56:33.680]  Democrats they are the losers humanity is the winner let's take a couple more

[3:57:01.120 --> 3:57:06.320]  grandfather not Muslim I'm sorry Amish man there was an Amish man who was a
[3:57:06.320 --> 3:57:10.240]  grandfather and he accidentally mislabeled some product and now he's

[3:57:13.720 --> 3:57:16.680]  something that we should have covered more but yes totally a political prisoner
[3:57:16.680 --> 3:57:20.040]  and Amish man I have that story on my desk right now I can't think of it maybe

[3:57:24.240 --> 3:57:29.320]  sort of stuff this was up in Alaska they got 26 years and he did not commit any
[3:57:29.320 --> 3:57:33.280]  crime at all this is for Schaefer Cox and if they if the American people knew
[3:57:33.280 --> 3:57:36.720]  about this then they would have to let him go because you're a hundred percent
[3:57:36.720 --> 3:57:40.760]  right wasn't Schaefer Cox a second wasn't that a second amendment deal yeah
[3:57:40.760 --> 3:57:47.240]  um it was it was six years ago in Alaska yeah I forget the exact I forget the
[3:57:47.240 --> 3:57:51.240]  exact story there but I remember it was some second amendment deal he was
[3:57:51.240 --> 3:57:57.200]  executing his second amendment right and he basically ends up in jail for it he
[3:57:57.200 --> 3:58:00.040]  gave a speech in Montana it was the first amendment thing he gave a first
[3:58:00.040 --> 3:58:03.600]  amendment thing yeah like I said this is you know it's there's so much going on
[3:58:03.600 --> 3:58:08.880]  go ahead they tried to entrap him as a as a militia leader they tried to trap him
[3:58:08.880 --> 3:58:12.880]  and he said no to this entrapment so they just took the story and they charged
[3:58:12.880 --> 3:58:18.320]  him with it and they gave him 26 years and they they probably the jury they
[3:58:18.320 --> 3:58:23.160]  withheld exculpatory evidence they broke law and now they're trying to keep it
[3:58:23.160 --> 3:58:28.480]  quiet so that they can keep him there this is what they do this is how they
