[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.720]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.720 --> 00:43.840]  ladies and gentlemen we're live and we're broadcasting worldwide here we are on this Tuesday
[00:43.840 --> 00:52.800]  the 19th day of November 2013 and we've got a very interesting online commentator
[00:53.600 --> 01:01.840]  and author ET Williams joining us and he has a lot of fiery and interesting things to say
[01:02.880 --> 01:06.320]  so he's going to be coming on with us for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour and then
[01:06.320 --> 01:12.160]  Larry Pratt will be joining us via video sky for 30 minutes with some big updates on the battle
[01:12.160 --> 01:20.080]  for the second amendment the UN treaties and an update on that front as well now that said
[01:21.040 --> 01:26.560]  I began to break down a few weeks ago that I I believe they may have overdone Obamacare and the
[01:26.560 --> 01:32.160]  amount of fraud involved in it it was meant to betray people destroy the economy but
[01:32.160 --> 01:38.480]  when you actually get down to finally destroying the economy it's so painful that the propaganda
[01:38.480 --> 01:44.400]  doesn't work anymore it's one thing to talk about beating somebody's brains out with a hammer
[01:45.120 --> 01:50.880]  it's another thing to actually do it and so for all the people that want to be Mr. Tough Guy in
[01:50.880 --> 01:59.120]  the New World Order I remember reading in a Nuremberg account by an SS officer when they
[01:59.120 --> 02:08.560]  had of the SS the Stoon Stoffel was walking along with the head of the SS Heinrich Himmler who also
[02:08.560 --> 02:15.120]  commanded the Wafa SS the armed SS or the Nazi Praetorium Guard at a death camp and they were
[02:15.680 --> 02:23.120]  lining people up by the hundreds and shooting him and Himmler began to vomit and then he had to go
[02:23.120 --> 02:28.160]  review some more people being shot and killed and he began vomiting again and actually passed out
[02:28.160 --> 02:34.480]  and then said oh it's so dreadful what we have to do I don't ever want to see this again well you're
[02:34.480 --> 02:40.080]  going to have to see it you want to destroy America you want to destroy the family you want to destroy
[02:40.080 --> 02:45.280]  productivity because you're at odds with it at an instinctive criminal level you're going to now
[02:45.280 --> 02:55.040]  have to go to 80s and now as the roller coaster goes over the edge of the cliff down into the
[02:55.040 --> 02:59.920]  wondrous abyss and they've got real devils driving this that think is very beautiful and like it
[03:01.040 --> 03:07.040]  there are real devils in this whole thing that are piloting the ship of fools but the ship of fools
[03:07.040 --> 03:19.040]  are beginning to notice that the Valhalla Guder Damarung that they were promised is not going to
[03:19.040 --> 03:28.960]  actually materialize they're learning this is not a heaven this is a hell we're being transported to
[03:28.960 --> 03:35.760]  very very quickly and again we haven't even entered into the real tyranny yet we're just seeing liberty
[03:35.760 --> 03:44.480]  shields being brought down the enemy armies being prepared and so Obama the puppet is being burned
[03:44.480 --> 03:52.640]  alive politically and he will be politically hoisted on his own pre-tard that's part of the plan
[03:54.640 --> 03:58.080]  it looks like they're going with that plan as i've always said obama could be the false flag
[03:58.640 --> 04:05.280]  they could try to assassinate him god forbid or actually assassinating or stage him being shot in
[04:05.280 --> 04:10.800]  the head and then it only grazes him and oh he's messianic and then suddenly the health care plan
[04:10.800 --> 04:16.240]  works and everything's okay and he's our savior and i mean that's in the cards as well but i think
[04:16.240 --> 04:19.760]  that's a that's a very low probability you know i think we're going to see the political destruction
[04:19.760 --> 04:30.960]  of obama unless they pull another card which is definitely a 30 40 chance i'd say a 50 60
[04:30.960 --> 04:35.600]  percent chance he'll just be destroyed but all he's done kept in place because people will think
[04:35.600 --> 04:39.280]  of him being destroyed politically as a victory but then the tyranny will just stay in place
[04:39.280 --> 04:46.400]  it's like musical chairs but there's a very good chance i'd say 30 chance that they may stage a
[04:46.400 --> 04:52.080]  false flag to try to prop him up and then a 10 chance that they'll do an assassination attempt
[04:52.080 --> 04:56.640]  or they may actually kill him that's i think that's in the cards we'll be right back
[04:59.920 --> 05:04.320]  my friends alice jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning

[09:10.880 --> 09:20.560]  and don't say it today there is massive unprecedented unamerican censorship going on in this country
[09:20.560 --> 09:27.920]  there is persecution of libertarians christians conservatives protestants catholics i don't
[09:27.920 --> 09:34.720]  care if you're not a complete collectivist or communist or socialist or a big corporation
[09:34.720 --> 09:41.520]  using that model to destroy the middle class then you're being targeted it's in mainstream news today
[09:42.320 --> 09:47.600]  that hundreds of prominent libertarians and conservatives in wisconsin have a democratic
[09:47.600 --> 09:54.720]  special prosecutor subpoenaing them investigating them trying to arrest them out of austin texas they
[09:54.720 --> 10:02.240]  have a grand jury indicting republican sheriffs and others all over texas of the same folks that
[10:02.240 --> 10:10.800]  tried to put um tom delay in jail on trumped up charges and i'm not defending tom delay i didn't
[10:10.800 --> 10:18.800]  like a lot of his politics as a mainline republican but what he did was mainline accepted lawful
[10:19.840 --> 10:24.960]  pack money that's why when they taught me to run for state rep for about a week and a half i went
[10:24.960 --> 10:30.080]  and got lawyers checked the laws and said there's no way to follow this if they want to selectively
[10:30.080 --> 10:36.240]  indict me they can raising money i'm not doing this people ask why i haven't run for political
[10:36.240 --> 10:40.400]  office i can reach more people on the radio more people on tv more people politically
[10:40.400 --> 10:48.160]  getting out ideas and research and info plus the way it's written a republican grand jury
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.880]  or or group can go after democrats or democrat control groups and go after republicans but
[10:52.880 --> 11:00.000]  i'm going to tell you i've done research on this i want to say 98 percent of the time really i can't
[11:00.000 --> 11:08.720]  find cases of politically motivated political persecution by republicans of democrats you
[11:08.720 --> 11:17.200]  could say the impeachment of bill clinton over lying to a grand jury about uh holla jones and then
[11:17.200 --> 11:25.920]  jennifer flowers and uh monica lawinsky and all that and yeah that was politically motivated
[11:25.920 --> 11:30.400]  because the america people's pressure on the nuclear secrets to china the merve technology the
[11:30.400 --> 11:37.120]  long march rocket technology the the coupler technology the avionics technology just a complete
[11:37.120 --> 11:44.960]  sellout the republicans were all involved in that kin star's law firm was involved at levels in that
[11:44.960 --> 11:53.120]  so they came out with a cigar story to bring him down because that was the one thing that wasn't
[11:53.120 --> 11:58.640]  connected to all the other corruption that they could go after and then it was the lying that
[11:58.640 --> 12:04.640]  was the issue and of course that was political theater but i mean i i just i just study politics
[12:04.640 --> 12:09.840]  i study the world and the democrats are a bunch of gangsters i mean it's just absolutely true if we
[12:09.840 --> 12:14.880]  could take over the rhinos make them libertarian take over the republican party be a great thing
[12:14.880 --> 12:18.320]  and by the way that's starting to happen that's why the republican leadership the democratic
[12:18.320 --> 12:26.800]  leadership is all circling the wagons going after the real tea party going after rand paul going
[12:26.800 --> 12:33.280]  after ted cruse and i'm not seeing those men are perfect the issue is they're real they are
[12:33.280 --> 12:37.520]  constitutionalists they don't want to destroy america they don't fundamentally hate the bill
[12:37.520 --> 12:43.120]  rights and constitution they want their kids to live in a free country i know rand paul very well
[12:43.120 --> 12:48.240]  he's for real ted cruse kept him in arms link for a while watched him closely i could see it in his
[12:48.240 --> 12:54.560]  eyes he is really getting off on liberty he is really getting off on the vets and the family's
[12:54.560 --> 12:59.360]  coming up to him he's actually caught the bug that jfk caught who wasn't perfect by the way that
[12:59.360 --> 13:05.040]  wanted to be a leader wanted to actually help people wanted to actually have a real civil
[13:05.040 --> 13:08.960]  rights movement wanted to actually end these wars wanted to get rid of the fellow to serve
[13:08.960 --> 13:13.280]  they said we're gonna how about we blow your head off buddy kennedy cut taxes by 50 percent
[13:14.320 --> 13:19.840]  in one tax bracket 30 something in the other he's like you mean if i cut taxes more money comes in
[13:19.840 --> 13:25.520]  they go yes mr president but we we want control of the economy bull cut it boom the establishment
[13:25.520 --> 13:34.960]  said this guy's out of control blow his head off i mean they don't want leaders that get off on
[13:34.960 --> 13:44.240]  empowering people and get off on success and get off on prosperity that's a that's a normal
[13:44.240 --> 13:49.360]  instinct they want a bunch of kleptocratic beam counting social engineers that absolutely have
[13:49.360 --> 13:54.480]  a weird axe to grind with successful people you've got hordes of criminals in government
[13:54.480 --> 14:00.080]  corporations who have always gotten together historically to wage war on the real producers
[14:00.080 --> 14:06.400]  and the real artist and the true people of of beauty and i mean intellectual beauty physical
[14:06.400 --> 14:12.080]  beauty you name it everyone knows that you would think and i've read about this in philosophy
[14:12.080 --> 14:17.920]  psychology anthropology you would think a really good looking guy would have everybody kissing
[14:17.920 --> 14:22.160]  their hind in and wanting to hang out with them but the truth is in a lot of circles people
[14:22.160 --> 14:29.040]  are mean to you if you're good looking same thing especially for women really good looking women
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.600]  than other women are mean to them it's the same deal well when you're successful in business
[14:33.600 --> 14:39.840]  and get it on your own you make a lot of enemies when you develop and and patent things and and and
[14:39.840 --> 14:48.640]  develop things and are a trailblazer people don't like that societies that rise are based on honoring
[14:48.640 --> 14:57.920]  the productive and the honorable societies that fall are based on kleptocracy and gangs and insiders
[14:57.920 --> 15:06.720]  and manipulation and folks we're going down that path right now where hey why should i develop
[15:06.720 --> 15:11.120]  something i could just get a big gang together and come take your factory over yeah but then
[15:11.120 --> 15:14.240]  you can only make me work for you building it at gunpoint for so long
[15:14.240 --> 15:21.360]  and then your gang takes over the next town the next town pretty soon there's nobody producing
[15:21.360 --> 15:27.200]  anything to even be able to buy from my factory pretty soon you've broken down the supply chain
[15:27.200 --> 15:34.000]  pretty soon you've screwed the whole thing up and that's the system they've set up ladies and
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.320]  gentlemen of total dependency total control the federal government today has now come out and
[15:38.320 --> 15:47.840]  proposed putting everyone on a quote livable wage and just giving it to them well you do that by
[15:47.840 --> 15:52.800]  having a diverse economy and by having real open and free trade not kleptocratic select trade
[15:54.720 --> 15:59.520]  and now they've come out and said everyone will just get a check but when you just give everyone
[15:59.520 --> 16:05.200]  a check then no one needs to work no one needs to innovate and then the whole society degenerates
[16:05.200 --> 16:11.680]  i mean that's a fact they want to bankrupt health care now you've got last night i was in the coffee
[16:11.680 --> 16:18.320]  room and i was watching cnn and they had a democrat on there in fact i hit record it's on there
[16:18.320 --> 16:25.120]  they had a congressman on there forget the name i was just sitting there with my mouth hanging
[16:25.120 --> 16:29.360]  up and getting a glass of water going well you know what the good thing is even though this
[16:29.360 --> 16:34.160]  doesn't work well and is bad we'll just go to a total single payer and national health care
[16:34.160 --> 16:39.680]  which was always the plan i know rama manuals brother is equal manual who helped write the law
[16:40.960 --> 16:45.520]  out of all the architects he's like the chief master builder he's on record with with with
[16:45.520 --> 16:49.440]  tom dashall and others being the top guys that did it saying well the plan has always been to
[16:49.440 --> 16:55.840]  wreck it and we're going to a single payer and the insurance companies know that so the issue is
[16:55.840 --> 17:00.240]  they're just being completely public about it but but here's the deal they're not even going to
[17:00.240 --> 17:06.720]  actually give northern european style free health care where you pay 80 taxes in the country but you
[17:06.720 --> 17:10.640]  get free health care it's it's not free it's like the federal money oh we get free money from the
[17:10.640 --> 17:14.880]  federal government you mean they take a dollar of tax money from the state and then they send
[17:14.880 --> 17:19.200]  30 something cents back on average you mean that kind of free money how about i come and
[17:19.200 --> 17:25.440]  take your wallet out pull your money out if you don't i punch you in the nose like the irs will do
[17:25.440 --> 17:30.480]  it with you know police and then i go here i'm gonna you got a hundred dollars in there i'm going to give you 35
[17:30.480 --> 17:38.320]  dollars back here's here's 35 free dollars you're like you just took that out of my wallet shut up
[17:38.320 --> 17:46.320]  conspiracy theorist obama just came out and said 100 million americans have signed up the truth is i
[17:46.320 --> 17:51.200]  think the numbers less than 8 000 have signed up and now we're learning they didn't really sign up
[17:51.200 --> 17:55.920]  they thought they'd signed up and we knew that the first week but now that's confirmed they didn't
[17:55.920 --> 18:02.080]  really sign up so that matter though he said 100 million or i'm racist so i agree with the president
[18:02.080 --> 18:06.160]  i'm gonna do whatever he says because the stick that he and oprah wave that i'm gonna be called a
[18:06.160 --> 18:11.760]  racist is so powerful you're right mr president 100 million have enrolled and at lower health cost
[18:11.760 --> 18:16.960]  and nobody got kicked off their insurance plans you're right you're absolutely right you're dead
[18:16.960 --> 18:24.000]  right i apologize there you go of course he now admits that's not true but it doesn't matter
[18:24.000 --> 18:30.480]  i mean oprah wimpery said if he's criticized and called a liar it's because people are racist
[18:30.480 --> 18:34.880]  no ma'am that's not what happened people hoped obama would be good and now with all the race
[18:34.880 --> 18:41.040]  baiting of you and msnbc people aren't getting racist but some of them are moving in that direction
[18:41.040 --> 18:45.520]  because they're like well everybody hates me i hate you right back folks that's divide and conquer
[18:45.520 --> 18:50.400]  and that's their plan and don't go along with it we need to come together around the bill of rights
[18:50.400 --> 18:55.840]  constitution due process and i know msnbc will say i'm deeply racist for saying that because i'm
[18:55.840 --> 19:02.480]  against racism deeply because i'm deeply racist and the health care is free and nobody got kicked
[19:02.480 --> 19:07.280]  off their health plan and it's working really good and 100 million signed up for it see i'm already
[19:07.280 --> 19:10.880]  getting ready here with the double speak for the fairness doctrine to come back in next year they're
[19:10.880 --> 19:14.480]  trying to put it back in and talk radio and the internet to restrict free speech where i will say
[19:14.480 --> 19:20.000]  the truth then i'll say and now a government message for fairness and i will repeat whatever
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.720]  their talking point is i will say the truth for my research or as close as i can get to it is hard

[24:44.000 --> 24:51.120]  with our moles up there more than five blocks away so about a third of the downtown core of
[24:51.120 --> 24:59.200]  dallas will be shut down uh in a test of turning america into north korea to be able to get anywhere
[24:59.200 --> 25:05.680]  near deli plaza and then 5000 tickets have been given to select sycophants who agree with the
[25:05.680 --> 25:11.280]  official story if you were actually shot by bullet fragments on the day uh you're not allowed to be
[25:11.280 --> 25:14.640]  in there if you were part of the warren commission but don't agree with the official story you're not
[25:14.640 --> 25:22.640]  allowed you must be a worshipper of the state of lies of the state run media and below broadcasting

[25:28.080 --> 25:33.760]  i'm coming and i'm going to be covering it from every different angle i'm bringing four different
[25:33.760 --> 25:39.760]  reporters uh tv reporters radio reporters print reporters all totaled i'm bringing about 10 crew
[25:39.760 --> 25:46.160]  members are more up to dallas my hometown to retake the first amendment this is about free
[25:46.160 --> 25:53.600]  speech and and we'll announce more details this afternoon on info wars dot com and we're going
[25:53.600 --> 26:01.280]  to be going over all of it here on the show today but tomorrow night at eight o'clock at the federal
[26:01.280 --> 26:07.360]  reserve in downtown dallas at pearl street we're going to have a demonstration against the real
[26:07.360 --> 26:13.600]  shadow government that took over the country 100 years ago december 23rd another big anniversary
[26:13.600 --> 26:20.160]  is coming up not just the 50th of the killing of jfk by the shadow government but we're going to
[26:20.160 --> 26:25.760]  also have the 100th anniversary of the private federal reserve takeover which is symbolic we
[26:25.760 --> 26:30.240]  can remove its charter anytime congress does the right thing and the constitutional thing
[26:30.240 --> 26:38.640]  and takes the power of the purse back the power to control currency and taxation at the federal
[26:38.640 --> 26:43.600]  level now handed over to a private group that masquerades is a federal agency we've protested
[26:43.600 --> 26:49.840]  there three separate times in the last five years as part of in the fed rallies so we're
[26:49.840 --> 26:54.240]  going to have an in the fed free speech rally eight o'clock tomorrow night there's all sorts of
[26:54.240 --> 27:01.680]  parking around there is why i've chosen it and we're going to be handing out 20 000 free flyers
[27:02.320 --> 27:08.560]  we need at least 200 people to show up to give 100 flyers per person that you hand out to people
[27:08.560 --> 27:14.800]  and by the way copa began to file a lawsuit a local activist group that's been covering jfk for
[27:14.800 --> 27:21.200]  decades and so the city back up said okay you can hand out flyers okay you can copa can come in at
[27:21.200 --> 27:26.480]  the end of the ceremony and lay a wreath so they're doing token stuff already and the dallas police
[27:26.480 --> 27:30.800]  in my experience are pretty nice and are actually listeners so i've been up there three times and
[27:30.800 --> 27:34.880]  they're like hey man we're on your side hey i listen to the show hey we know what's going on
[27:34.880 --> 27:38.960]  we don't like the fellow reserve we don't like what's going on with the dollar bindi valued
[27:38.960 --> 27:43.680]  even the head of the dallas fed has come out against qe's unlimited and obama
[27:45.120 --> 27:48.960]  so we're not even against the people that run the dallas fed i mean they're like the rebels against
[27:48.960 --> 27:52.880]  the fed nationwide that in kansas city is also a better fed and they don't want to destroy the
[27:52.880 --> 27:57.520]  country completely you're in trouble and there's like actually sane members of the federal reserve
[27:57.520 --> 28:01.760]  against obama and they're going public against what the globalists are doing it's that bad
[28:02.720 --> 28:06.560]  they've had a bunch of fellow reserve officials come out and say we apologize it's a criminal
[28:06.560 --> 28:10.240]  transfer of wealth you know they bought into it that really the federal reserve is going to run
[28:10.240 --> 28:15.520]  things and stabilize the economy and they're saying whoa this is criminal so we're going to be there
[28:15.520 --> 28:20.400]  with a demonstration really not even so much a protest to raise awareness of free speech
[28:20.400 --> 28:25.440]  and to protest against the mayor who says i'm going to be out here with all my rich friends and
[28:25.440 --> 28:30.000]  we've decided that that you know that the chinese that died in tenement square for free speech and
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.760]  freedom of assembly they deserved to die basically and uh we've decided that the veterans that fought
[28:35.760 --> 28:40.160]  and died for the first amendment and all the rest you know they had a bad idea we're not going to
[28:40.160 --> 28:45.200]  allow any free speech in dallas on the 50th anniversary or the day before or the day after
[28:45.200 --> 28:52.560]  thursday friday saturday so here's the news we're going to show up and hand out 20 000 flyers and
[28:53.200 --> 28:59.040]  several hundred big full posters that have been posterized cost a lot of money that part does
[28:59.040 --> 29:04.240]  show that you can either go out and hand them out thursday or hand them out friday in the morning
[29:04.960 --> 29:08.560]  whether you can demonstrate for an hour and hand out flyers for an hour whether you can do it

[33:27.120 --> 33:32.640]  by the way in the next 10 15 minutes adan salazar is going to post on info wars dot com
[33:34.400 --> 33:37.840]  a article he put together off of my breakdown yesterday
[33:37.840 --> 33:44.240]  the only reason i mentioned that is sometimes you read this stuff and it's like they just
[33:44.240 --> 33:48.000]  tape record what i say and then kind of write an article around it which i know sometimes
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.280]  is really good stuff i spew out sometimes they have to correct a bunch of it but that article
[33:53.280 --> 34:00.560]  on our demonstration on our taking back of the first amendment in dallas this wednesday thursday
[34:00.560 --> 34:06.080]  friday and saturday and again folks i wouldn't even go up there for the 50th anniversary in fact
[34:06.080 --> 34:14.720]  i've never been there for the anniversary in my life i've never gone to dealy plaza for the
[34:14.720 --> 34:20.240]  anniversary i've been up there and shot documentaries done reports and interviews because we know the
[34:20.240 --> 34:24.480]  establishment killed kennedy we're fighting the info war to get the truth out and they've never
[34:24.480 --> 34:32.080]  barred the public from the huge park now they're barring everyone including victims who were there
[34:32.080 --> 34:37.760]  that day who saw kennedy's head blown off and he was hit by a bullet fragment james tagan others
[34:39.360 --> 34:46.160]  it's outrageous i mean if you try to gather entienement square for a peaceful political rally
[34:46.160 --> 34:50.880]  or handout paperwork you would be arrested and then if you fought back you would be shot
[34:52.400 --> 34:56.240]  well i mean i'll tell you right now if i go to dallas and i wasn't trying to force my way into
[34:56.240 --> 35:01.760]  that square and i resisted the cops they would first taser me and then if i resisted more killed
[35:01.760 --> 35:09.360]  me we could literally have a tenement square and the question is will the dallas police and i don't
[35:09.360 --> 35:13.280]  know if i'm going to do this it depends on how they act tomorrow at the fellow reserve and then
[35:13.280 --> 35:17.520]  the next day we're going to have a march thursday when all this starts we're trying to pick a place
[35:17.520 --> 35:22.800]  right now about seven eight blocks away to march down to the barricades and they're even trying to
[35:22.800 --> 35:29.040]  say you can't even have posters out in other areas because the mayor thinks he's kim jong-un and i'm
[35:29.040 --> 35:35.200]  telling you if we let the mayor operate as kim jong-un in dallas he is kim jong-un the leader of
[35:35.200 --> 35:40.560]  north korea that's how tyrants work if you put up with them and they get away with it it's over
[35:42.320 --> 35:46.560]  i'm gonna get to the news here in a moment it's just that this is a big deal
[35:48.720 --> 35:54.160]  this is a huge deal that in the town where i'm born deep in the heart of texas
[35:54.160 --> 36:00.320]  is that they're trying to declare most of the downtown area about a third of the total downtown
[36:00.320 --> 36:06.240]  but right in the heart of downtown most the heart of downtown a a free speech free zone
[36:07.600 --> 36:13.760]  a first amendment dead zone it's bad enough to cordon off the park and say thursday friday and
[36:13.760 --> 36:19.120]  saturday only the establishment can use it to spew their lies to have the international media
[36:19.120 --> 36:23.840]  there this is going to have over a billion people watching it worldwide but now they're pushing the
[36:23.840 --> 36:28.000]  barriers way down the road we've got a story coming out on that in fact we found the road
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.920]  closers in the dallas morning news did a map of that we probably need to have our crew do that
[36:32.480 --> 36:38.800]  and then you know photoshop in a line to show folks where it's shut down uh and then give that to
[36:38.800 --> 36:44.560]  a dawn so we can also put that in there now what a lot of folks have done is obviously if you already
[36:44.560 --> 36:49.200]  have a hotel down there or whatever you'll have to show your show your uh your your card and stuff
[36:49.200 --> 36:54.240]  to get through and that's not even into the main area so anytime there's a g20 anytime there's a
[36:54.240 --> 36:57.920]  globalist meaning they lock everything down now joe biden is going to be there tomorrow
[36:58.480 --> 37:04.480]  he's reportedly not there on uh thursday or friday uh obama's going to go to the eternal flame
[37:04.480 --> 37:09.280]  and arlington cemetery where kennedy is buried because he's a highly decorated pt boat captain
[37:09.280 --> 37:14.160]  from a from a little run in with a battleship with the japanese so he's buried in arlington
[37:14.160 --> 37:20.000]  cemetery obama will drop by there uh to spew his propaganda uh and of course covered up who
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.640]  really killed kennedy so we're going to be there we're going to be covering it and we're going
[37:24.640 --> 37:31.200]  to hand out 20 000 flyers with basic jfk info on it so that people know their censorship going on
[37:31.200 --> 37:37.440]  just to defy them saying you can't do this now they already backed off two days ago a judge came out
[37:37.440 --> 37:45.040]  and said over the weekend dallas police you've got to mayor you've got to let them do this and
[37:45.600 --> 37:51.040]  so they've backed off that but they're saying but the mayor says no big signs allowed so so it's
[37:51.040 --> 37:57.440]  the mayor the mayor is god now in america if you want to go to dallas and and walk around with a
[37:57.440 --> 38:03.360]  poster with your political views that is the most protected speech if a woman wants to walk around
[38:03.360 --> 38:07.520]  a scandaly clad outfit doesn't matter if it upsets people that's her free speech but that's
[38:07.520 --> 38:13.120]  that's that's mid-level protected and called community standards when it's political speech
[38:13.120 --> 38:21.600]  folks it is the most protected speech there is so this is literally black them saying black people
[38:21.600 --> 38:26.400]  can't go eat at these white only restaurants i mean this is the same level but they're saying
[38:26.400 --> 38:33.760]  everybody doesn't have speech black white hispanic old young male female they don't care they're
[38:33.760 --> 38:40.480]  saying you don't have rights ladies and gentlemen so it's everyone's duty if you live in the dallas
[38:40.480 --> 38:44.960]  forward area especially huge listenership up there it is your duty folks to bring you your
[38:44.960 --> 38:50.240]  friends your family tomorrow night eight o'clock at the fellow reserve all sorts of parking in
[38:50.240 --> 38:54.160]  the area that's why i picked that we've done demonstrations there before and come over and
[38:54.160 --> 39:01.520]  i will give you personally with my crew a hundred double-sided flyers with key information on each
[39:01.520 --> 39:08.480]  side that you can then go hand out that night to people or on your lunch break the next day or
[39:08.480 --> 39:13.920]  take off the day it's important to literally saturate things on thursday and then keep some
[39:13.920 --> 39:19.200]  of the flyers when you come down at say 10 a.m it runs until like 2 p.m the moment of silence is
[39:19.200 --> 39:26.800]  like at 12 30 when they blow his head off and we are going to hand out those flyers and then also
[39:26.800 --> 39:30.240]  by tonight because i've got to look at it and decide where we pretty much decided last night
[39:30.240 --> 39:35.440]  around out of time we've got to put out a new article tonight connected to adan's article he's
[39:35.440 --> 39:42.880]  about to put out showing where we're going to meet thursday after my radio show and we're going to
[39:42.880 --> 39:46.080]  march whether it's a hundred of us or a thousand of us i think it'll probably about a thousand
[39:46.080 --> 39:52.640]  people just guessing we do these things impromptu we will march down the sidewalk in an orderly
[39:52.640 --> 39:58.160]  peaceful way as we always do and i just say that so there's no provocateurs the dallas police you
[39:58.160 --> 40:02.880]  know in the past have honored the first amendment i'm sure that they don't like what the mayor's
[40:02.880 --> 40:06.320]  doing and and it's already been partially struck down and so i'm gonna tell the cops that they
[40:06.320 --> 40:10.160]  try to stop us marching down the street up to the barricades we don't plan to cross those
[40:10.880 --> 40:15.360]  i'm gonna tell them okay so you personally want to be listed in the lawsuit stand aside for the
[40:15.360 --> 40:20.640]  first amendment in the name of the first amendment in america and in the name of tenement square get
[40:20.640 --> 40:24.800]  the hell out of my way i don't think the cops are even going to get in our way i know the dallas
[40:24.800 --> 40:32.000]  police but if they try to stop me i'm going to go back on the radio with an emergency transmission
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.400]  that night and i'm going to call on everyone to come to texas and then friday we're crossing the
[40:36.400 --> 40:41.280]  barricades okay it's bad enough we're there to draw attention to the violation of free speech if
[40:41.280 --> 40:45.840]  they try to stop us marching up to the barricades i'm talking to the dallas police department right
[40:45.840 --> 40:52.240]  now get that mayor in control or send him to north korea i will not sit here and watch this
[40:52.240 --> 40:58.560]  and you shouldn't let your family have their birthright robbed either this is bs and i really
[40:58.560 --> 41:02.880]  get angry when i start thinking about how we just put up with this in america because the mayor says
[41:02.880 --> 41:08.560]  he wants there to be decorum and doesn't want protesters a conspiracy theorist around and and
[41:08.560 --> 41:13.760]  that they they they want to not talk about who how who killed him but remember that he was killed
[41:13.760 --> 41:22.480]  what in the world does that mean it doesn't matter what you want mayor you are not the king of dallas
[41:22.480 --> 41:32.000]  texas get that through your brain and i'm telling all my reporters be on the lookout and all the
[41:32.000 --> 41:38.800]  entrances to the barricades i want that mayor questioned on tape since when do you think america
[41:38.800 --> 41:44.080]  is tenement square i mean this is tenement square level stuff ladies and gentlemen believe me i've
[41:44.080 --> 41:49.120]  been arrested plenty of times demonstrating and protesting i don't want to go to jail again especially
[41:49.120 --> 41:54.320]  lose steric but i'll that horrible jail right there and there's just literally 200 yards away
[41:54.320 --> 41:58.560]  from where we're going to be at but if that does happen you can be assured everybody involved will
[41:58.560 --> 42:04.080]  be sued by the way we already sued and won against the pittsburgh police department okay so i'm just
[42:04.080 --> 42:10.960]  warning you right now why don't you do the right thing and behave and get your mayor under control
[42:10.960 --> 42:15.440]  or fine i'll personally sue you we are a little bit nice with the pittsburgh thing and just let
[42:15.440 --> 42:22.160]  the city pay out um but this is personal this is first amendment i've had enough of it so i'm
[42:22.160 --> 42:26.240]  coming up there and that's the end up we're going to be real nice real friendly like i always am
[42:26.240 --> 42:32.400]  you decide which way this goes i'm coming to my hometown to retake free speech in texas
[42:32.400 --> 42:36.960]  disgusting mayor we should get more articles out showing the quotes of the mayor and the
[42:36.960 --> 42:41.120]  dallas observer and the dallas morning news last year and then again this year and then point out
[42:41.120 --> 42:46.400]  that he's already been defeated notice of filming restrictions for dealie plaza
[42:49.120 --> 42:52.640]  due to construction renovations and preparation for his anniversary event
[42:52.640 --> 42:57.760]  extreme extensive filming will not be allowed there's no law oh yeah that's nothing they're
[42:57.760 --> 43:02.560]  now saying you can't even videotape anywhere near there they got cameras watching us but the mayor
[43:02.560 --> 43:09.120]  said oh like like maria entoinette let them eat cake oh and don't let them film anything either
[43:09.120 --> 43:14.160]  because we've got renovation going and we don't like how it looks i mean it's just just i mean
[43:14.800 --> 43:20.240]  the mag print that for me the magnitude of these scum in fact i'm just calling on everyone now to
[43:20.240 --> 43:24.720]  be there just be there tomorrow night be there thursday be there friday i mean we've got to
[43:24.720 --> 43:28.960]  stand for the first amendment or lose it i just i didn't even know about that that's even worse
[43:29.920 --> 43:35.520]  i mean this mayor is just get me the mayor's phone number and all his info i think we're
[43:35.520 --> 43:40.800]  going to give the mayor's phone number out i think i've had enough of it oh my gosh i've got all
[43:40.800 --> 43:45.040]  this news i want to get to and now i my blood pressure is rising right now see i meant to spend
[43:45.040 --> 43:48.640]  like three minutes on this but i start thinking about it i start thinking about what our country's
[43:48.640 --> 43:54.080]  turned into new york city tried to put free speech zones in and say no free speech put
[43:54.080 --> 43:57.360]  in these cordoned areas and then they would arrest everyone and beat them up in the in the
[43:57.360 --> 44:04.480]  cordoned areas they lost more than 10 000 lawsuits and over a hundred police ended up getting fired
[44:04.480 --> 44:10.480]  just from the dnc event of the rnc event 2004 by the way i was there for that and witnessed it
[44:11.360 --> 44:16.160]  it's the same thing in texas if we've got to file 10 000 lawsuits and and believe that's what'll
[44:16.160 --> 44:19.920]  happen to the arrest people and if we've got to get everybody fired that's the way it is
[44:19.920 --> 44:25.440]  i'm going to sue the mayor for civil rights violations what a bloated piece of trash to
[44:25.440 --> 44:31.760]  sit there and tell me that i can't film in downtown dallas because he waived his magic wand
[44:35.600 --> 44:41.520]  these people make me want to throw up okay let me just stop for a minute let me just stop for a
[44:41.520 --> 44:48.880]  minute shifting gears now into obama care obama is now collapsing because people stood up doing
[44:50.880 --> 44:54.560]  and because the truth of what was in obama care came out and we warned people up front
[44:54.560 --> 44:59.200]  and then it all happened just like we said because we had the bill it was it was not like it was
[44:59.200 --> 45:04.160]  hard it's like like a recipe like a chili recipe after you cook the chili oh gee i got chili on
[45:04.160 --> 45:12.320]  top the stove who would have ever imagined this well this this obama care thing was a bunch of
[45:12.320 --> 45:17.680]  special interest hospitals big hmo's big foreign banks literally wanting to lower the quality of
[45:17.680 --> 45:21.920]  care make you buy the care and be able to charge whatever they want in a controlled market as a
[45:21.920 --> 45:29.680]  tax to foreign banks the supreme court ruled a private corporate piracy levy to the globalist a
[45:29.680 --> 45:36.400]  bail in of american taxpayer money to predominantly offshore banks that run this and then they tell
[45:36.400 --> 45:41.200]  the left oh don't worry wink wink dashel's book even said this we're going to destroy health care
[45:41.200 --> 45:44.800]  with this and bring in the socialist utopia but of course that's not going to happen either
[45:46.320 --> 45:50.480]  you're going to get death panels welfare folks they're going to kill you when you come in
[45:51.360 --> 45:55.280]  to get your legs sawed off because of all the aspartame you're drinking or whatever with the
[45:55.280 --> 46:02.080]  diabetes this is the plan they got you dependent now they're going to go to work on you and we
[46:02.080 --> 46:13.200]  told you this and then the main architect the doctor zikio immanuel came out on fox and admitted
[46:13.200 --> 46:16.880]  this and now i'm seeing a minute everywhere and now i'm seeing democratic sites rub their hands
[46:16.880 --> 46:23.600]  together i plan to bring down america cloutin clout and pith in his working well oh i'll get
[46:23.600 --> 46:31.680]  you and your little dog too i mean it is sick so let's go to this clip to remind you before i go to
[46:31.680 --> 46:36.880]  the new breaking intel here it is people who knew the law as it was being written knew the president
[46:36.880 --> 46:41.360]  wasn't telling the truth the grandfather provision written into the law itself was too narrow and
[46:41.360 --> 46:45.840]  frankly they wrote a regulation intentionally trying to get people out of the individual market
[46:45.840 --> 46:50.000]  they want the people to go into the exchanges because there's a lot of people in the individual
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.760]  market the whole point of the exchanges is to close down the individual insurance market
[46:53.760 --> 46:58.400]  over time insurance company they wanted to move millions of people into the insurance companies
[46:58.400 --> 47:03.120]  don't want but insurance companies don't like the individual market as it's constructed they see
[47:03.120 --> 47:07.280]  the future that individual market is going away they don't want to invest in it but that's why
[47:07.280 --> 47:13.840]  president let me finish let me switch that's it wreck the individual market they've already wrecked
[47:13.840 --> 47:19.120]  the system with banks involved in insurance companies and hmo's ripping people off and so
[47:19.120 --> 47:24.880]  people go do something oh we will don't worry like right it's like little red riding hood fell down
[47:24.880 --> 47:28.480]  and skinned her knee and then the wolf popped out and said hi sweetie i want to help you and she
[47:28.480 --> 47:33.040]  said hey gonna help me big bad wolf and he said just come to my cave with me i'll help you he's
[47:33.040 --> 47:38.880]  gonna eat her and so yeah she's skinned her knee and now she's skipping along with the wolf
[47:39.680 --> 47:41.520]  he's like do you mind if i put these handcuffs on you
[47:41.520 --> 47:50.480]  you and then the public's gonna buy that too they're gonna buy the new scam the republicans
[47:50.480 --> 47:55.280]  come up with it'll be something just as bad or worse and then there'll be another emergency plan
[47:55.280 --> 48:01.280]  they put america into an emergency and then pass the buck around like pass the hand grenade
[48:01.280 --> 48:05.760]  and politically it blows up an obama's hands they don't care because they move on to the next puppet
[48:05.760 --> 48:13.920]  it chris christie michael rubio here let's go to this here it is and there's video of this
[48:13.920 --> 48:20.240]  woman hailed by president as obama care success story now can't afford obama care oh what your
[48:20.240 --> 48:28.080]  price is doubled cupcake but oh but but obama promised i mean you got off the bus in los
[48:28.080 --> 48:32.400]  angeles you're gonna be a star and now you're locked up in the back of a truck somewhere
[48:32.400 --> 48:37.360]  but that's all right because he got you now doesn't he let's move to the next one right here
[48:37.360 --> 48:43.360]  obama implores supporters for help on law crisis that's a psych warfare tactic to make them feel like
[48:43.360 --> 48:48.880]  they're part of it it's being sabotaged everything you know help me be with me it's total manipulation
[48:50.080 --> 48:55.600]  here's another one obama flubs during healthcare conference call with community organizers claims
[48:55.600 --> 48:59.680]  more than a hundred million americans have enrolled by the way you guys get the audio with that
[48:59.680 --> 49:04.640]  there's audio with that i want to i want to get the audio with that so i can play that that's
[49:04.640 --> 49:10.000]  really top top top level important thank you very much so there you go oh bloomberg obama
[49:10.000 --> 49:16.560]  care failure may shave 30 percent from us drug sales see that's there's so many hands in this
[49:16.560 --> 49:22.080]  thing cheating that it's just going to blow out the economy it's too good of a screw job it did
[49:22.080 --> 49:26.960]  you went way too far you've betrayed people too many times now they get the fixes in here's another
[49:26.960 --> 49:35.520]  one botched aca rollout hammers obama job this approval reaches a career high abc news reports
[49:35.520 --> 49:39.600]  and of course that's even in the whitewash media it's actually much worse than what those polls say
[49:39.600 --> 49:46.320]  obama care death spiral that's the hoover institute journal coming out saying that he's totally
[49:46.320 --> 49:51.280]  collapsing the left is saying it's endangering the left and the idea that hey you you get on our
[49:51.280 --> 49:55.520]  bandwagon you don't have to work anymore you know they're saying oh my gosh you're dropping the
[49:55.520 --> 49:59.520]  hammer too quick on all our people they want a free ride they're actually getting screwed
[50:00.240 --> 50:04.320]  you know what are you doing well it's like unions voting for naft and gat what are you people doing
[50:05.280 --> 50:10.320]  you believe if you buy into something that magically makes it okay you've got to buy into
[50:10.320 --> 50:15.440]  something that's real and it's moral to be empowered not something that's fake and a fraud
[50:15.440 --> 50:20.480]  i mean the globalist will kill a million plus iraqis just to have no bid weapons contracts and
[50:20.480 --> 50:26.240]  shut their oil off jack up prices do you think they wouldn't kill you if they could it's not just
[50:26.240 --> 50:32.560]  they don't care about you they see you as dumb vermin who they need to exterminate just remember
[50:32.560 --> 50:38.560]  that and the argument is are you dumb vermin that need to be exterminated don't act like dumb vermin
[50:38.560 --> 50:44.960]  then i don't want to exterminate you i could have joined the establishment i'm not getting on satan
[50:44.960 --> 50:52.320]  ship just because it looks like it's winning right now no way baby oh and here's the sweetest thing
[50:52.320 --> 50:56.720]  mint romney would beat obama today it wouldn't matter he helped ride obama care with the ziki

[51:07.520 --> 51:14.000]  practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride
[51:14.000 --> 51:19.520]  ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and
[51:19.520 --> 51:26.480]  encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results
[51:26.480 --> 51:32.560]  are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously been

[54:34.480 --> 54:40.560]  with being fired the state-run media and persecuted it's on record if you criticize
[54:40.560 --> 54:46.880]  obama in any way in hollywood you never work again well now that over intimidation of the
[54:46.880 --> 54:51.840]  first amendment has caused a backlash and so folks were in there recording it from the media
[54:51.840 --> 54:57.600]  him in the conference call and then obama had to come out today and admit that okay i misspoke
[54:57.600 --> 55:02.640]  no he didn't misspoke he lied but of course oprah wimpery says that's because i'm racist no i don't
[55:02.640 --> 55:10.640]  like make lied to i but see how they play that game but it isn't going to work anymore ladies
[55:10.640 --> 55:16.560]  and gentlemen we're sick of it we want prosperity we want freedom not a bunch of inside interest
[55:16.560 --> 55:21.920]  raping us financially all right let's go ahead and go to this audio from the conference call
[55:21.920 --> 55:26.640]  health care are going to be able to get the health care less than the cost of their cell phone bill
[55:26.640 --> 55:34.400]  or cable bill um and in the first month alone we've seen more than a million americans already
[55:34.400 --> 55:39.120]  in successfully enrolled in the new insurance young people are paying 200 a month million americans
[55:39.120 --> 55:45.200]  who completed it an application for themselves or their families and that represents about a
[55:45.200 --> 55:50.880]  million and a half people again i apologize i was talking over and uh started from the
[55:50.880 --> 55:56.720]  beginning did you hear him say 100 million people had signed up it's not even 10 000 folks
[55:58.400 --> 56:04.080]  i just cannot but it's like having your arm caught in a hay baler it's we're literally
[56:04.080 --> 56:11.200]  ripping us up inch by inch let's go back and play it again from the beginning most young americans
[56:11.200 --> 56:16.080]  who don't currently have health care are going to be able to get a health care less than the cost
[56:16.080 --> 56:22.800]  of their cell phone bill or cable bill um and in the first month alone we've seen more than 100
[56:22.800 --> 56:28.640]  million americans already in successfully enrolled in the new insurance plans you've got a million
[56:28.640 --> 56:34.960]  americans who completed it an application for themselves or their families and that represents
[56:34.960 --> 56:39.440]  about a million and a half people and of those million and a half people you've already got a
[56:39.440 --> 56:44.320]  whole bunch of folks who've successfully signed up to get coverage okay that's enough you've got
[56:44.320 --> 56:51.840]  a 400 000 folks you know what oprah has to say you know oprah says that if you disagree with him
[56:51.840 --> 56:56.080]  it's because he's black and if you say he's a liar it's because he's black and that you're basically
[56:56.080 --> 57:01.920]  racist and you just need to die so uh you heard it uh you everyone needs to kill themselves
[57:01.920 --> 57:06.160]  if you don't believe 100 million people signed up or if you don't believe that it doesn't kick
[57:06.160 --> 57:12.160]  you off your health plans when it has you're a racist if you think the sky's blue right now
[57:12.160 --> 57:17.280]  it's daytime and it's blue you're you're racist if he says it's pink and it didn't pink you just
[57:17.280 --> 57:22.240]  better do it or oprah went for his god she waves a magic wand and says you're racist and you know
[57:22.240 --> 57:27.520]  if she says that you you spontaneously combust she just points her finger like fire starter
[57:27.520 --> 57:31.520]  or whatever that movie was a little girl and you just blow up and just explode in flames she goes
[57:31.520 --> 57:36.800]  racist i hear i'm so afraid of it oh don't call me that here let's go ahead and play her there are
[57:36.800 --> 57:44.640]  still generations of people who were born and bred and marinated in that prejudice and racism
[57:45.200 --> 57:51.440]  and they just have to die but it's the other clip where she goes into it's right after that
[57:51.440 --> 57:57.360]  where she says uh he's black basically go ahead and play it just the level of disrespect
[57:57.360 --> 58:04.080]  when the senator yelled out you're a liar remember that because he was lying i mean
[58:04.080 --> 58:11.840]  yeah i think that there's a level of disrespect for the office that occurs and that occurs in
[58:12.800 --> 58:17.600]  some cases and maybe even many cases not like well i mean you heard it of course this is oprah
[58:17.600 --> 58:24.160]  wimfrey you can look it up who goes to europe and new york to meet with like ten other top globalist
[58:24.160 --> 58:32.000]  abc news reported times of london reported to discuss depopulating africa but that's okay i mean
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  you want to just get rid of all the black people that's fine but if you call obama a liar that's
[58:36.000 --> 58:42.720]  racist so i said i'm sorry i won't kill all the black people i i mean i just maybe i should be
[58:42.720 --> 58:48.640]  trendy i agree with oprah let's forcibly abort all the black people and uh i mean i guess i agree with
[58:48.640 --> 58:55.360]  her in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the
[58:55.360 --> 59:02.080]  halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen
[59:02.080 --> 59:07.920]  family fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[59:07.920 --> 59:14.960]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table
[59:14.960 --> 59:21.920]  and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously
[59:21.920 --> 59:28.560]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base

[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.200]  takeover folks uh we've got all of that coming up and of course biden calls on higher power what
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:54.480]  satan his father to save obama care and the death panels and making the churches pay for abortions
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.840]  and you know teaching five-year-olds uh you know how to have sex i mean it's just these people are
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:06.720]  a bunch of degenerates ladies and gentlemen and that's why i like et williams and you know i don't
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:12.320]  agree with everything et williams uh has to say uh but i understand his anger at some of the things
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:17.760]  that are going on his websites whatever happened to common sense dot com and et williams is a simple
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:25.360]  man who doesn't mind standing alone by himself um when convinced that it's right and he joins us and
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.920]  i've seen his youtube videos some of them get hundreds of thousands of millions of views and he also
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:34.080]  of course stood up for us with the whole pierce Morgan thing he was like the first person that
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.560]  next day to come out and defend us because at first people were saying oh alex you really screwed
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:43.280]  up getting his face but now it's recognized as turning the tide at many levels saying look you
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:48.720]  want our guns you want to enslave us if you try to take them it'll be 1776 again red coat
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:55.120]  so they tell us to sit down and shut up while they're all aggressive and try to shout us down
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.720]  so that's why i like et williams and i've been wanting to get him on for a long time but we finally
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:04.800]  got to hold them and are getting him on right now to cover the waterfront of subjects but
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:10.480]  mr williams good to good to have you on with us today good to be on alex appreciate it you bet
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.800]  wow well you've got the floor for folks that don't know who you are tell us your world view
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:20.800]  well it's i'm a pretty simple man uh alex i always tell people i'm not going to blow your way
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:25.680]  being the most articulate person in the world but i know the difference between right and wrong and
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:30.160]  that's why i think the american people have lost this sense when our grandfathers and fathers grew
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.840]  up when a man shook your hand and said he was going to do something but he did what he said he was
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:39.920]  going to do and i think we have raised up a bunch of wussies a bunch of wimp men a bunch of pacifists
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.000]  they're letting the homosexuals just to take over our damn country they are violating every
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.520]  constitutional right under the sun there's no way that a man like barack obama could have stayed in
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:56.560]  charge unless we have uh become a bunch of wimps uh if this had happened 50 or 60 years ago we have
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:01.680]  we would have stormed the white house and removed this damn communists out of the white house but
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:07.360]  too many of us have become content because long as we have our iPods and our internet and our
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:13.440]  two-car garages we're content with letting these sobs completely dictate what the hell we think
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:18.080]  and i'm just one of the minds said i'd rather die than let a bastard like barack obama or joseph
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:23.120]  biden or any of these other damn frauds tell me to shut up i'd rather die than let these bastards
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.920]  tell me to shut up well take over winfrey she's on record at these secret eugenics meetings that
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:32.640]  have come out in mainstream news trying to basically pay for forced abortions in africa
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:38.880]  and depopulation but then if i say obama's a liar she says that's because i'm a racist and it's not
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.400]  because obama's supposedly part black that i dislike him i i'd love like a black ron paul or
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:50.160]  something it's because he is absolutely fundamentally trying to transform this country into a tyranny
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:55.200]  you're absolutely right but this alex this is what most of the liberals do and always tell
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.680]  the conservatives whether you're black black white or white especially to the white conservative
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.640]  or libertarian whoever may be out there whenever they go with the race card you know you have them
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:10.000]  on the run because they never attack what you said about barack obama they never attack what you
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.960]  said is isn't the truth in that they go with the race card and their trump card they use to try to
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.440]  silence any critics they usually call me an uncle tom or something i was just telling them after
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:24.320]  yourself or go to hell because when they find out that these tactics doesn't work when they call
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.480]  your names the racist name when they find out this doesn't work they have to try to destroy
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:33.760]  your character all together because whenever the race card doesn't work then you're going to see the
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:39.280]  really ugly side of them working for that their daddy the devil who they work for anyway and whenever
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.560]  they notice whenever the race card doesn't work you're going to see the most violent individuals
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.680]  come out then they let their true colors show whenever you don't let the race card work operate
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.760]  i always tell people Oprah Winfrey is one of the reasons that barack obama is the president
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:16:00.320]  she's the one who baptized him in and let the rest of the media accept him i told people when
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:04.320]  barack obama first started running for office he was a straight up communist everybody looked at
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:09.200]  me like i was insane i said go look what the man stands for he now he doesn't stand for anything
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:14.720]  that the country should be founded and built on he's a straight up communist and he wants to
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:20.240]  destroy our country i don't see how anybody can't even see that well now they've got democrats coming
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:24.640]  out like Ezekiel Emanuel and admitting they want to wreck health care to take it over they want to
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.960]  wreck the country so you they've got to go on welfare they admit that's their plan and they've
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:37.200]  almost won see but the only thing i i'm i have a little confidence in now alex is that uh this is
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.840]  the first time you've seen barack obama actually vulnerable all the other times everything was
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:46.960]  rolling off him now the democrats are just looking for to be re-elected in 2014 the only reason
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.120]  a bunch of them are standing they need phoning republicans the only reason they're standing
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.960]  is that you remember when Ted Cruz first came out and attacked Obamacare and says we need to
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:00.320]  defund it everybody made him out to be some type of terrorist and racist now we see that Ted Cruz
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:05.200]  was actually correct i think we need to hold all these politicians democrats and republicans
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:11.600]  uh accountable for them attacking Ted Cruz they all attacked him and i said back then that he was
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:16.480]  absolutely right and he should stay at it but now we see that barack obama may be vulnerable
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.880]  for the first time not because the democrats want to do the right thing not because the republicans
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:25.520]  have any damn backbones because they lost their textbooks a long time ago but now they want to
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:30.240]  get re-elected we're trying to cut off their mill ticket so now they may be vulnerable to attack
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:36.080]  barack obama we see even uh liberal news media outlets attacking obama which we've never seen
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.880]  before so i think we need to attack like now attack attack him right now like we've never
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:46.240]  did before oh i totally agree with you that they're turning on him because obamacare is an even
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.440]  bigger screw job than they'd intended it's so well done direct economy it's happening too fast i'm
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:58.240]  concerned what they may pull to try to prop him up i mean i try to think like they do if i was them
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:03.920]  they might try to stage some type of assassination on him uh and blame some idiot patsy they find
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.640]  yeah you know or or they might blow something up and blame it on their political enemies
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:13.680]  another oklahoma city i mean if i was them i'd be getting ready to stage something to blame
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:19.840]  my political enemies now i wouldn't put this past the mindset of these evil people because
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:25.600]  they're capable of doing anything but i can tell you what it's going to be an inside job
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:30.480]  they're gonna do obama because he's one of the most protected men of all time he don't trust
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:35.040]  anybody that's why he wants his own secret military he wants his own people around him because
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:38.960]  he don't trust them either he knows that they may try something like this i don't know if they can
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:44.160]  get to him now but the last thing i ever want is anything to happen to him that would turn him
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:52.400]  from the you know rotting political thing that he is now into a mythical figure
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:57.520]  you're absolutely right the worst thing could happen to barack obama now if somebody tried
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.760]  to assassinate him because i want him to live because i want him to fall on his face i want
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.560]  him to be exposed for the following years because if he dies now if something happens to him now
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.320]  they're gonna prop him up the media's great martyr that was only looking for the freedom
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:15.280]  people and we would never be able to expose the defund obama care like we should anyway
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:20.400]  so i hope nothing happens to him now because i've seen him vulnerable for the first time
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:24.960]  the writers hope no i agree with you he is politically bleeding out right now et williams

[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:11.440]  all right here is where i stand on the entire quote homosexual gay agenda
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:20.400]  i do not dislike anybody for their sexual activities what goes on their bedrooms their
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.840]  issue as long as it's adult and consenting i'm libertarian but i'm also a christian
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:31.760]  that means i can have my views of it and i'm tolerant but it doesn't mean i have to adopt it
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:38.320]  and what's happening is i can't let my children watch any tv show or pretty much any movie a
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:45.680]  cooking show a remodeling show we try to let them watch that it's all got a sexual agenda
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:50.400]  which is anti-heterosexual and here's an example goose yard he said i could tell the story
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.080]  he brought this up this morning goose yard he's never brought up anything about the gay
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:58.320]  agenda to me or the homosexual agenda or whatever you want to call it he was in whole foods yesterday
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:04.320]  he said last night driving home he went in there to get some food and a smoothie you know a vitamin
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.840]  drink nobody's there at the counter he walks up the guys clearly gay behind the counter said
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:16.000]  fine didn't matter to him whatever he's sitting there the guy is making his uh a smoothie
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:22.640]  and it's about two minutes into it and two gay guys walk up and go uh a straight guy literally
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:28.800]  this happened to him last night uh a straight guy uh he got service first and started griping
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:32.400]  at the guy behind the counter now folks whole foods does have high quality foods a little bit
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.360]  overpriced obviously whole paychecks the real name of it but that i've got to go there a central
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:44.080]  market to try to get organic food and and listen my wife more than ten times has had people walk
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:49.200]  over and say you shouldn't have three kids they literally come over when you're buying a bunch
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:54.080]  of red meat and say that may not be a good choice it's like a communist compound so i'm i said i'm
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.880]  done i just can't go in there anymore and it's not because i can't stand to see trendy gay people
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:04.400]  it's that they don't want to see me and so i'm you know i thought i have et williams on
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.880]  about six months ago that man but the way he goes after these folks i don't dislike people because
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:13.440]  of what they're what they are i mean here's an example the american uh you know a psychological
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.600]  association came out and tried to say pedophilia was okay last week and had to reverse themselves
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:24.720]  you can look that up they said it was a uh uh a what was the exact uh a sexual orientation
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:29.280]  grabbing your kid out of your backyard so so et williams joins us and i just i've got to tell
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:35.520]  you his point that it's being literally dropped down on everybody from five-year-olds in school
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.080]  to you name it if you try to teach a five-year-old about heterosexual sex it's pedophilia but when
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:46.000]  they teach them about what two daddies do or two mommies do literally to five-year-olds that's not
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:52.800]  pedophilia it is so what it really has become is is is i think regular folks out there you know gay
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:57.040]  folks wherever you want to say really need to get a hold on their movement because there's going to be
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:02.880]  a major backlash to the fact that this is literally like a military takeover of society so so there's
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:08.880]  my real view on it is it is the tip of the spear of the revolution obama has these gay lesbian groups
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:13.360]  and then has little kids up to introduce it on purpose saying look we got your kids you wouldn't
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:18.080]  have a playboy mansion thing uh you know with you have to have little kids introducing the women
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:24.560]  i mean this is sexualizing children and i don't like it et williams i like you absolutely right
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:29.600]  this is every time i talk to you something about the gay mafia the reason i attack them
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:33.840]  so vehemently because the way they attack people so vehemently personally i don't have anything against
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.000]  the gay people like i tell people all the time i have i know people who are gay some of them are
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.960]  the nicest people you can possibly talk to the problem i have is with the way they come out like
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:49.200]  some type type of mob that's why my pet name for him is the gay mafia because mafia style people
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:54.160]  used to try to extort money out of people do a shakedown to make you do what they want you to do
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:59.600]  soon as the business disagrees with them it can be for for their religious conviction they have a
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:04.240]  right it's still a free country that's their constitutional right but the gay mafia what
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:10.240]  they do is come in and try to literally destroy a company or business or individual for disagreeing
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:15.200]  with their lifestyle they have no middle ground when it comes to this they're everywhere they
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:19.760]  literally shove it down your throat they want you to agree with their their lifestyle and i always
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:24.880]  tell them why don't i have a damn opinion why don't you agree with my my viewpoint i don't
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.880]  care what you do in your own home but i don't think we should be redefining marriage i don't
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:35.200]  think we should be uh caring to the whole gay movement and doing everything to uh pacify them
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:40.800]  and also we're confusing the children the little boys don't know they're boys and girls that's why
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:45.200]  i have a problem with the way they're literally shoving it down through you can't talk about god
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:50.320]  or jesus in school but you can talk about how to put a banana on a condom you can talk about how
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:55.440]  sally has two mothers uh billy has two fathers well they teach more than that they remember
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:00.960]  they've taken 12 year olds to college courses in dormitories and beds and teach them stuff i can't
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:06.640]  even say on air it's pedophilia it's exactly what it is but see you used to get say that this is
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:11.440]  pedophilia but see what they wanted to do is desensitize you to the whole gay movement and
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:15.760]  tell you that all business normally you think you accepted or something wrong with you you're
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:20.960]  homophobia always funny yeah what it is is like sexual harassment because because it's one thing
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:24.880]  if somebody just says hey but then if you keep doing it over and over again it's the pushing the
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:31.120]  pushing the pushing the pushing that's the issue of absolutely if somebody just says hey you know
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:35.040]  this is what i like i like you or whatever that's one thing but if it keeps going going going it's
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:40.160]  the hammering just keep pushing keep pushing keep pushing keep pushing it's just unbelievable
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:43.280]  and there's going to be a backlash let's talk about it more when we come back and talk about where

[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:01.680]  the story briefly here in just a minute as we go back to our guests first off we're not going to
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:07.120]  be able to run it for more than another week or two max because um they don't want to get too low
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:12.480]  and be on back order with the manufacturing process so even when the special angel still
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:17.840]  be able to get the pro pure systems with the pro one filters the entire line with 10 off promo
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:25.680]  code water but we're running it with 20 off promo code water which is 20 off the already lowest
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:33.360]  allowable price but i'm the biggest distributor in the world of these now so i'm able to twist arms
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:41.760]  i'm able to offer 20 below the lowest price that other people are allowed to offer now that
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:45.040]  means somebody can't buy one individually and just to be weird so on ebay or something for
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:50.560]  lower price but for a major seller of these we are the best price period promo code water

[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:40.160]  am and fm affiliates as well supporting their local sponsors or becoming a sponsor today
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:46.240]  today like wbcr right there in tennessee i did for two weeks they kept saying do these liners
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:49.840]  for stakes or do these liners for stations had a big stack of them i was reading the liners for
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:54.880]  wbcr and it was the fact that they've never done this in the 16 years or whatever it is they've
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:02.080]  been carrying my show 15 and a half 16 years there in noxville it's an am station a great station
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:09.520]  they've never had a fundraiser to to to get the final fees done for a powerful fm and so i think
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:14.080]  everybody who's listening on wbcr should donate to that so i've cut the promo for that and sent
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:18.720]  it on to them but two weeks late uh and their fundraiser i apologize for that but uh police
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:25.120]  support wbcr they i believe other than two stations in upstate new york they are our oldest affiliate
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:36.000]  15 16 years old i don't know since about 19 1998 was one you know amazing okay uh wbcr
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.840]  they're in noxville okay enough of me doing that long plug i didn't plug last hour so i doubled
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:45.840]  down right now let me just explain this whole story i was brought up kind of as a fiscal libertarian
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:55.440]  pro america pro gun conservative but on social issues liberal and literally you know have like
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.800]  a gay cousin uh he's like a second cousin or whatever and friends or whatever college i don't
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:07.440]  care i'm not obsessed with stuff like that but there's going to be a backlash to to the open
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:11.520]  pushing in schools and everywhere else you can't turn on any television show i mean they've even
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:16.160]  had gay activists come out and say it's it's it's it's literally getting like a motorcycle gang or
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:20.560]  something i've criticized motorcycle gangs i'm not criticizing all motorcycle gangs but i've had
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:25.760]  motorcycle gangs bow up repeatedly for no reason and i'm like really if you get in a fight with me
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:31.200]  it's it's literally somebody's going to die okay i can't help it you may be able to kick my butt
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:36.320]  but you're going to be in a fight with somebody that kicks like a mule and bites like a crocodile
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:41.760]  i mean you know you really want this because man i tell you what jump in my briar patch man it's you

[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:17.600]  people came over and bitched at her for being pregnant and for having kids said it's gross
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:21.280]  we're having kids and it's gross that we're straight and i looked at my cousin i said man what
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:25.760]  who kind of friends are these i'm getting out of here and that's what i'm telling you folks i've
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:34.560]  put up with this in austin now no exaggeration a lot of times to where just because i'm a libertarian
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:40.160]  i will literally have gay men get in my face and parking lots and go i don't like you extremist
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:44.000]  or in a restaurant i walked in to pick up food a few weeks ago don't let this guy in this guy's
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:49.040]  an extremist and i want you're joking around he goes no i'm not who just was so angry because
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:54.320]  i don't worship obama it's a cult is what i'm telling you i don't like the klan because it's a cult
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:59.520]  i don't like some motorcycle gangs because they're a cult i don't like cults and i'm telling you it
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:06.800]  is a cult now where the author of ender's game had is against getting rid of marriage and so they
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:11.840]  tried to block that movie coming out i mean this is a mafia folks and it's being used by obama now
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:17.280]  et williams that's a long intro i never get into this subject but since you get into it i thought
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:21.600]  we would broach it and i'm sure now i will probably have the free speech mafia come after
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:27.040]  me but it's just at a certain point i just don't like being pushed around and told i'm bad i mean
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.840]  gucciardi was literally in peck for about five minutes last night while he was waiting for a
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.800]  smoothie so three minutes no one's there and they come over and say get out of my way you're
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:43.280]  serving a straight before me and he's like gucciardi said are you joking and they ignored him and
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:47.760]  talked trash about him for another three couple minutes while he waited for the for the smoothie
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:52.800]  i mean it's like crazy and i guess i guess you're supposed to just blow your head off and go i'm sorry
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.080]  shove a gun in your mouth and blow your head off maybe that'd make him happy maybe that'd make
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.960]  Oprah Winfrey happy saying i'm a racist because i know obama's a liar what do i do et williams
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:06.720]  to prove i'm not racist do i throw myself into a wood chipper i think what you always you tell
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:12.320]  all of mrs to go to hell at it i always tell them don't even address uh if you're a racist and i
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:17.200]  say when you entertain the argument and even make the argument with them you've already they already
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.760]  defeat you because all they try to do is get you sidetracked on what you're actually doing so whatever
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:26.240]  they call a race call me something obviously go to hell i'm gonna keep talking about what i'm talking
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:30.880]  about because they want to get you sidetracked that's their whole playbook is what they use
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:34.560]  if you have to start defending what are your races and that is like do you have to defend
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:40.160]  whether you are a a dog or not you know you're not a dog so always tell people don't even address it
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:44.160]  when they say you're racist say go to hell if you want to think that i'm not going to even address it
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:48.800]  now here's my point why i don't like barack obama this is why i don't like it because some of these
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:53.120]  people you're never going to convince them that you're not a racist anyway and technically they
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:57.600]  know you're not a racist but they're using that in order to get you sidetracked on your argument
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:05.600]  keep breaking it down but see another thing is why i said i even made a video saying this right
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:10.400]  here i said stop saying you're not a racist don't even address these jackasses you don't even have
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:15.200]  to address them just like when people say you're homophobic i start laughing and i said you want
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:20.320]  me to stop talking about homosexual gender is because they're trying to bully us around i always
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:24.400]  tell people i'm not going to let you bully me around to stop me from saying something i know
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:29.760]  is not right you i don't like to see a two a heterosexual sucking face in public because my
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:35.200]  kids maybe but be maybe right here i don't like them always shoving in down there some things i
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:40.160]  think is meant for the bedroom or meant for your home i don't think they should be all in public
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:45.120]  forcing us to accept this and also have a problem with people redefining words i've always had a
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:50.800]  problem with people redefining words and i don't care if people like what i say i always tell them
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:55.760]  show me what i'm wrong here i don't see you showing me the wrong the gay the gays act like a bunch
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:00.240]  of mafias soon as just like you said the incident from the gentleman you were talking about he went
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:05.680]  into the uh to get a smoothie and they're bullying him around now if he had said shut the hell up
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:10.720]  get out of my face if something had happened they had came to blows the media coverage on that would
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:16.080]  have been man attacks guy for being gay they would never have said the gays attack him first
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:21.280]  this is how they put a spin on anything so always tell him i'm going to speak for myself so when
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:25.280]  you when the story comes out you can say what you want to but i'm going to tell my story whether
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:32.560]  you like it or not and i always tell my kids the same thing i i i i i i tell my kids my kids going
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:37.440]  to know what i stood for because they don't have to ask somebody what daddy stood for daddy's going
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:41.280]  to tell you what he stands for and i'm not going to give me into a bunch of cowards a bunch of
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:47.040]  race mongers a bunch of homosexuals who want to show homosexual down there just because barack
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:51.120]  obama is a homosexual i don't dislike barack obama because he's a homosexual and he is a
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:55.040]  homosexual by the way i don't dislike barack obama because he's black or half white or nothing
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:00.000]  like that i dislike barack obama because he's a communist and a socialist and he wants to
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:05.760]  destroy our country the way we know i like being i like capitalism i think capitalism work i don't
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:10.080]  think of a man should be able to lay around a woman should be able to lay around and not work and
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:14.640]  should be able to draw paychecks from hardworking people who go to work every day i think this is
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:19.840]  absolutely nonsense hey i'm going to be honest with you ellis when i grew up i was 30 years old
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:24.480]  before i even got health care as a matter of fact my birthday today i'm 48 today i didn't have a
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:29.280]  health care job 30 years old so don't tell me anything about these people thinking they're
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:32.960]  entitled to help well i didn't either i've got nothing but i didn't have insurance till i was
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:38.000]  30 it's funny it's the same year we only had it about 10 years but expanding on that again et
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:45.120]  williams is joining us right now it's like saying do you beat your wife or saying walking up saying
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:51.200]  prove you don't beat your wife and i've noticed my son's got a birthmark with clearly a little
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:55.920]  pink mirth mark on the side of his head it's always at the park and stuff liberals we're
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.960]  really authoritarians come over and say does your dad do something to you and i learned this because
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:06.080]  i had a dog a lab that got hit by a car he wanted to eat the fence and he got hit by a car and and
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:10.320]  they wanted to chop his leg off but i said no so he got some feeling back in it he'd have to swing
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:14.240]  his leg and i learned at the park it was always the liberals because i later i would ask him i'd
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:19.200]  say so you're a big democrat aren't you they'd say they come over to my dog and say did he did he
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:23.520]  do something to you did you hurt his leg their whole world and they did a study in canada about
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:29.600]  the environmentalist the fake ones how they are six times more likely to commit crime and how they
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:35.600]  also share on facebook for charities but are the lowest givers democrats are the lowest givers
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:41.120]  it's all about how they've got moral high ground and you don't of course i'm oversimplifying this
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:46.640]  but it's a great example and then they'll use an example of some thugs beating up some gay guy
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:52.880]  about oh my gosh everybody who you know isn't accepting our radical agenda is wants to beat
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:57.840]  people up no i don't want to beat anybody up in fact the truth is i'm very accepting and very
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:03.120]  tolerant and quite frankly you don't obsess over what people are up to are doing it's it's just
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:07.600]  amazing how this has been organized but because we mentioned this anthony good shard he was up
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:12.640]  here writing an article today at the info war center with story leak dot com you told me this
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:18.000]  story this morning how bizarre it was because i was on the hike and bike trail of my son
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.280]  and i said two trendies were talking trash about me go on oh look there's alex jones pointing at me
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:29.200]  and then you said man it's so weird but then you told the story of whole foods last night again
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:32.960]  anthony good shard he tell folks what happened yeah exactly so i was at whole foods i was
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:37.600]  getting a smoothie because they use a lot of organic produce and stuff and the guy behind the counter
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:42.160]  was clearly gay and that was fun you know no big deal and then i ordered my smoothie i was waiting
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:47.680]  maybe five ten minutes and this gay couple comes up two guys come up and they order their smoothie
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:51.840]  which by the way was much larger and would take a lot longer and i went up and other people were
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:55.680]  getting their smoothies who had already been there for about ten minutes and they said typical
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:00.400]  serving the straight man before us when when when the guy behind the counter was gay making the
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:04.880]  juice and then i went to get mine and they were laughing at me and pointing at me saying you know
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:09.200]  typical that you know look at the straight guy getting served first and complaining and saying
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:13.840]  how they're being mistreated when they had no idea the guy behind the counter was actually gay
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:18.480]  well half the people in there probably were yeah like i'm telling you what we'll be like there's
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.640]  one straight guy running and they're like hunting us on horseback with like bows and arrows like
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:27.440]  hunger games soon it's funny like our existence means it is against them the fact that we don't
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:31.840]  make a big deal about it makes them make a big deal out you know it's well that's another issue
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:36.880]  is that like everywhere now they're talking about especially in schools that that that like two girls
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:41.840]  two guys will start kissing each other and doing all this but then if if a girl and a guy kiss they
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:47.680]  get suspended but then it's okay if it's i mean it's a cult takeover man it is a cult takeover
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:54.480]  no no i mean god forbid we say that a 50 year old man with male genitalia can't go into an
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:58.320]  eight year old girl's locker room because he identifies as a woman you know i went to the
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:03.040]  dmv and i was getting my license plate in texas where you have the thumb scan and i said you know
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:08.560]  what if i identified as a female as a black female on my license and she said well you could do that
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:12.720]  i honestly asked her that i said there's nothing against that she said no i should
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:17.840]  identify as illegal alien i'll get everything free you should i mean this this is now a society where
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:22.640]  if i feel like i'm a black female i apparently can be one and it's nothing against black people
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:26.400]  or females it's just completely ludicrous no no if you point out the insanity then it's even
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:30.160]  racist to point that out it's racist to say that it's just like this article i wrote yesterday
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:35.040]  in the article about how 55 plus percent of the country wants to repeal obama care they were saying
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:39.600]  anyone who wants that is in favor of slavery period well you are you don't want to be ripped off
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:43.360]  soon yeah the comments were saying that anyone who wants that wants barack and his family to be
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:49.200]  slaves again et williams final segment with him thank you anthony for telling your hate filled

[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:25.600]  center of attention that's like the south park episode where the big motorcycle gangs take over

[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:34.880]  they go in the restaurants and go rum rum rum rum rum rum rum rum actually making that noise and
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:42.240]  i think that's kind of what it has become is a bunch of grandstanding not people that don't
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:46.640]  want to be messed with because you know because but that's what happened with the whole civil rights
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:52.960]  movement a lot of really good things happened it went on but then it becomes an institution to then
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:57.520]  say brown bags are racist in seattle and don't wear a native american outfit to halloween
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:02.240]  it's disrespectful and don't be a geisha girl and it becomes like a way to dominate politically
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:05.920]  while meanwhile we're all being cheated by these foreign banks that run the insurance companies
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:11.200]  with obama care we're all being cheated as our dollars devalued by the federal reserve and then
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:15.760]  meanwhile they've got us all fighting with each other and people are so entitled so looking to be
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:22.480]  abused that brown bags are racist literally and and and a and a lone man getting a smoothie how
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:29.280]  do they know what gucciardi's is into i mean it's really ultimately bizarre et williams you've got
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:32.800]  the final comments on that and i want to briefly talk to you about where do you think obama's going
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:37.360]  to end up where do you think this whole agenda is going has the whole control freak socialist
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:44.240]  movement gone too far or are they winning i think it may have gone too far because unless the american
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:49.840]  people stand up and start just recognizing some of the basic essentials of their their rights being
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:55.440]  eroded away i don't think we're gonna ever uh be able to the curve this prime example of uh i don't
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:59.840]  know i know you for me with alex barvin his latest rant he's always going off on people he's cursed
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:04.640]  out flight attendants but the minute he says i'm about the homosexual uh people all of a sudden
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:08.800]  they suspend his show corby brad got fined a hundred thousand dollars the basketball player
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:13.760]  for calling the referee an f in fact and even though the referee himself was not a game uh this
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:18.400]  whole way that they do do things like the the incident you talked about about the smoothie
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:24.000]  i believe if this had happened and he was the way i've been reversed around and heterosexual
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.560]  had treated him the way it starts saying it's about gay glad and lgbt and all these other
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:33.280]  organizations would have been on the tv and i witnessed you seeing in would have been out there
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:38.080]  everybody would have made a big deal about the distorted but when a heterosexual male gets discriminated
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:42.960]  against it's it's no big deal and especially if you happen to be a heterosexual male that's white
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:48.480]  and if you're christian that makes it even worse so this is an all out assault on man and an all
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:53.600]  out assault on our way of life and until we start standing up uh opposing these people
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:58.800]  when i go that's why barack obama has got away with what he's gotten away with this long i don't
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:03.040]  think it's going to end because i think we have too many cowards that has been neutered amongst
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:10.240]  our men now that's how i see it but then that'll make the extremists get so wild they'll finally
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:16.880]  be a point where there's even a i mean if i was a gay man i would not want to be associated with
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:21.600]  these groups acting like this and i would be criticizing it because if they take the most
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:26.480]  extreme people and make them the leaders of it saying we're going to teach your five-year-olds
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:32.560]  how to do this i mean what happens and what happens i think sometimes is that the extremists these
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:37.280]  these radical ones they take over the organization and the other people who may be a little bit more
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:41.200]  moderate they don't want to say anything because they don't like confrontation but these radicals
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:46.400]  really like confrontation and the only way that you can combat them is to be confrontational
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:50.960]  towards them you can't ignore these people when you ignore them they get more and more bolder
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:56.240]  i've had them try with me plenty of times i always talk to them just as bad as they talk to me and
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:00.640]  they always go away you can ignore them all you want to i tell people it's all the time you ignore
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:04.640]  them all you want to see how far they get you because when you ignore these people they get
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:11.040]  more and more radical i got friends who is on face with uh book with me who's gay and people get mad
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:15.280]  if i have a friend that's gay i don't agree with their lifestyle they know i stand it i tell them
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:19.040]  all the time i don't agree with your lifestyle they know what my stand is but they're not trying
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:23.200]  to push it down everybody's throat like some of these other people they know my stand on it and
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:27.920]  i'm not going to change my stand can i be friends with the gay people of course i could but i'm

[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:36.640]  all right folks larry pratt's coming up with breaking news a little bit later in the hour
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:42.560]  and i'm gonna hit a bunch of news i haven't gotten to yet but i wanted et williamsville to
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:47.760]  finish up now that i thought about it in the short segment getting into obama now that
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:55.440]  he is literally imploding politically and the democrats are abandoning ship and he's being
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:00.800]  called on his lies finally and all the old lies are coming out what do you expect obama to do
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:06.480]  and what does your gut tell you because i i'm concerned that they might again as i said earlier
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:10.720]  try to stage a fake assassination to then blame their political enemies and claim we're all violent
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:15.120]  which is what msnbc always does but but other than that i mean what's your gut tell you et williams
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:20.720]  you know my my gut tells me that he's too arrogant to try to fake assassination just because
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:25.200]  i think the man loves himself so much but i i would say that i think he may try some type of
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:30.720]  scandal i don't know if it may be start a war i don't know if he may try to start a race war
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:36.560]  but barack obama is going to try to he doesn't want to relinquish power he is a power-hungry driven
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:41.440]  man those behind him have invested too much in barack obama to put him in office and they don't
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:46.800]  want to lose their political capital now the problem that they may have is that they don't
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:52.000]  mind us ushering hillary clinton but the problem is they got so much to invest in the barack obama
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.720]  and he still has three years left so i think they may try to come up with some kind of scandal
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:02.160]  to get the focus off his obama care and all the other scandals that he's been involved in i wouldn't
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:08.480]  put past him starting a war of some type of uh a martial law thing going on i i don't put anything
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:12.720]  past sure i've got to be honest i thought he'd come after the guns and stuff but i had no idea
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:17.280]  he would be such a communist style race baiter i mean i knew that from the revin right but he
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:24.080]  really uh did it and now you watch msnbc cnn i mean they clearly are trying to start racial
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:29.200]  division in this country and the statistics show that it's that racial division is increasing
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:34.160]  and even analysts admit it's been the uh race baiting of the democrats and it's just unbelievable
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:39.120]  you see that that's the problem i always tell people we have you have to talk about it because
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:43.840]  the conservatives or the libertarians cannot ignore the subject because the democrats and the
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:47.760]  liberals are going to talk about it and they're going to talk about it from a wrong standpoint
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:54.960]  so as conservative or libertarian uh patriot you have to come out and have a conversation and expose
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:59.120]  these frauds for the frauds they are when they try to say that you're racist because you oppose
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:03.760]  barack obama say what part of what i just said was racist now let's deal with the facts and i don't
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:07.600]  want to deal with this none since you're talking about i want to deal with facts and most of the
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:11.920]  time you'll notice that they don't never want to deal with facts anyway they want to get you sidetracked
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:18.960]  on a bunch of on a wild goose hunt because they don't deal with facts they don't uh what about the
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:22.800]  republican party larry pratt's coming up talking about how they're trying to sabotage all the real
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:28.160]  patriot libertarian constitutionalist types they're actually trying to save the country i mean it's not
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:32.400]  just the democrats the republican leadership they're a bunch of scum they are scum and i've been
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:35.920]  telling people this for the longest and also i don't know if you heard enough but they think
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:41.440]  about putting christia for 2016 what a joke that is i told i wouldn't admit running to win just because
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:45.920]  barack obama is such a bad candidate don't think for any stretch of imagination i'd like to admit
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:49.840]  running because he was way too liberal for me but the problem with the republicans is
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:56.560]  they're just as liberal in some aspects as the democrats are jfk looks like a stone cold
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:01.760]  conservative compared to all these republican most of those guys are nothing but frauds and we
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:06.560]  and people on the republican side side in the libertarian side got to stop propping up these
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:12.480]  phonies there are phonies stop acting like these that's right jfk cut taxes by 50 in the major
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:18.000]  bracket that's beyond what ron paul proposed exact and only that jfk don't forget he hated
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:24.480]  coming he hated coming i don't understand how these people have came to this level that we have
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:31.520]  such a american hating republicans and democrats these people literally are trying to destroy our

[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:20.560]  operation imagine if they called it the foreign or the offshore banking cartel take over of health
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:27.840]  care and direct bailout tax to them but they don't call it that they call it obama care
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:32.080]  and then we all make it about the website doesn't work and obama's gonna get it fixed and
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:39.600]  maybe if we pray it will uh the clouds will will part and this is the washington times
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:48.160]  literally quoting him biden calls on higher power to save obama care and his hopes of higher
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:59.200]  office there you go absolutely mind blowing and obama has been caught uh lying and uh saying
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:04.240]  that a hundred million people we played the tape last hour that a hundred let's cue that back up
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:09.280]  we can that a hundred million people have successfully signed up for the health care
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:18.080]  and it's cheaper it gets better than the cost of a cable bill that must be an expensive cable bill
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:24.880]  so that is just some of the news but don't worry uh joe biden came out and said that
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:33.360]  he wants to call on our power it must not be god because obama has removed god from the gettysburg
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:39.360]  address that's that that's right so he better have better get them in on a joe biden not to call
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:45.520]  on a higher power maybe it's not the proper name uh maybe they called on joe hova or jesus or something
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:50.880]  or even a uh you know the problem is you're not supposed to you don't you have to call on bls bob
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:58.480]  maybe you should add uh in bls bob we trust instead of just removing god bls bob or lucifer
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:10.080]  satan bathomet leviathan let me think of some other ones asteroth maybe maybe maybe that's what
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:14.880]  they have to put in there to make the obama care work if you add that to the gettysburg address
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:22.720]  then that will fix everything won't it boys and girls so continuing here but don't worry
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:28.400]  politico says people are waxing nostalgic back to the election they feel betrayed and
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:35.280]  mitt romney would win in a landslide election today if it was held again um but then it wouldn't
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:41.200]  matter because it was the exact same plan yeah i actually helped write it with ezekiel ezekiel
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:48.960]  um manual so there you go ladies and gentlemen there is the ongoing uh betrayal and they're calling
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:53.440]  it a mess and blaming obama which he is part of the crew that's done this but remember it's the
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:57.120]  globalists that did it they just got a little greedy and i guess they thought that everybody
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:13:04.000]  would put up with this uh here here is the clip that i mentioned um where obama yesterday in a
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:10.320]  conference called to his uh victims uh what would you call jim jones followers or hitler followers
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:18.320]  the cult victims so so obama was in a cult victim meeting yesterday telling his cult victims and
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:21.040]  of course if i was on the phone with somebody selling me something and they sounded like this i
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:28.560]  wouldn't walk i would run like in the uh like in the cartoon whenever you see somebody see
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:33.040]  something scary and they run and then they then they bust through the wall i mean that's what i
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:37.840]  would do the the obvious praying on them he's talking in a real quiet voice again this is the
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:42.800]  same voice i i've read in criminology that you would use to coax a puppy into your car if you
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:48.400]  want to take it and have it turned into food at the local uh a cuisine or if you wanted to coax
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:53.600]  a child into your vehicle everything's okay i'm i'm iraq obama i love you and i and a hundred
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:58.560]  million people got it and it and it cut the prices and here it is don't currently have health care
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:03.360]  are going to be able to get health care for less than the cost of their cell phone bill or cable
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:10.560]  bill um and in the first month alone we've seen more than a hundred million americans already
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:16.320]  in successfully enrolled in the new insurance plans you got a million americans who completed
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:21.280]  an application for themselves that's so you heard that a hundred million americans have enrolled
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.760]  in the data mining thing that they give to basically facebook so they can promote open
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:30.320]  borders and gun control there's just data mining your your info so they can then legally use it
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:36.560]  under federal law because you went and signed up there no they think a hundred million buffoons
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:40.640]  have gone and mainly felt like 30 million they think they on average they've done like three times a
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:48.000]  piece reentering their names over and over and over again trying to get the free you know lottery
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:54.800]  win and and my issue is this i've now figured out that obama isn't shoveling like regular bull
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:15:03.280]  droppings on us or horse pucky there's actually a a pot of gold into the rainbow obama is a leprechaun
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:11.680]  literally all these lies are not lies they are golden nuggets that he's the putting into the
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.320]  folks always thought it was a pot of golden legend actually a porta potty but the golden
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:21.840]  nuggets get dropped into and so i can now officially say that obama is a demonic leprechaun
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:28.960]  but he is giving us free health care so it makes it okay ladies and gentlemen shifting years we
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:35.040]  are joined by larry pratt the head of gun owners of america gun owners dot org the only no compromise
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:39.760]  pro second amendment anti-victim disarmament group out there that's what ron paul calls them the only
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:46.080]  no compromise gun lobby in washington they have forced the last decade uh the nra to stop being
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:52.240]  compliant rhinos handing over our liberties and so literally we would have lost the gun
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:56.720]  battles if it wasn't for gun owners of america and if it wasn't for you being supporters out there
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:01.920]  of gun owners and if it wasn't for their alerts and their intel and their tireless work and he's
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:10.240]  here giving us big intel today on what the rhinos are doing as usual for the establishment sabotaging
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:15.520]  true libertarian patriot constitutionalist we're trying to get other people into state and federal
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:22.000]  government like ted cruise and ran paul and the enemy is there sniping them and our intel chief
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:27.120]  larry pratt uh not just on the second amendment all things freedom uh is here to give us the
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:32.480]  inside scoop larry pratt sir thank you for joining us alex thank you so much for having me before i
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:38.320]  get started i wanted to just say that that clip that you had of the president claiming a hundred
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:46.560]  million signups is he delusional everybody knows that's not true exactly what he's lying to his
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:53.600]  to his cult members he didn't know anybody was recording that maybe that's it it was sort of
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:17:00.400]  like his bitter clinger comment at a ten thousand dollar a pop fundraiser in the o8 campaign and
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:08.640]  that occasion does to make a t-shirt with a hand on a 45 and a hand on a bible and the legend
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:13.360]  i'm a bitter clinger exactly i'm proud to be a bitter clinger so larry you've got big intel
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:18.960]  for us here today obama and his whole group are in trouble except at the state level uh they are
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:25.920]  being able to maneuver their people in actually it was not so much their maneuvering as it was the
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:33.760]  the uh unwillingness of the republican national types and specifically the republican national
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:40.800]  committee to help out ken kuchinelli the attorney general of the state who was competing to be the
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:48.000]  uh governor of the state had he won he would have very likely i think you'd have to say been the most
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:58.640]  conservative small government uh governor in the country and as the obama care debacle was beginning
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:05.440]  with the rollout and as the numbers started to move against the administration they also started
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:12.720]  to move against the governor elect now uh here in virginia it's an open seat they the republicans
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:19.520]  the republican national committee gave nine million dollars to bob mcdonald the incumbent governor
[02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:28.000]  they gave three million to kuchinelli and the last two weeks of the campaign even though it was obvious
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:36.320]  that zero care i think is a better name for it uh was going to be tanking people associated with
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:45.120]  with that and indeed kuchinelli's numbers started to come up but in the last two weeks of the campaign
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:51.200]  he had no money to advertise in the northern virginia area which is a very expensive area
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:58.400]  because it's the entire washington metropolitan area and there you had it instead of a victory
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:06.000]  of several points he lost by two and a half and i lay that directly at the feet of people like
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:11.040]  carl rove at the republican national committee because they were the ones that knew that this
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:16.400]  guy couldn't win besides that i don't really think they wanted him to win i think they're happier
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:20.480]  with a liberal democrat than a conservative republican well that's right i want to come back
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:23.600]  and talk about this but from my study and you're up there you know more than i do about this but
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:28.480]  it's clear there's a real libertarian patriot revolution that could save this country and
[02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:34.720]  we're getting so popular not just my show your work anybody who promotes basic liberty compared
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:39.440]  to all this marxism is popular we could take the country back and the old blue blood republicans
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:43.120]  that are part of the globalism they don't want that to happen so i want to get your breakdown on
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:48.720]  what we do if that's accurate and then where we go from here because you you can see it i mean they
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:53.840]  are carl rove the whole republican establishment is after ram paul after ted cruise after me
[02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:59.680]  they're they're angry at drudge report for promoting liberty i mean they are just coming after us

[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:53.840]  make some pretty good movies but man and i met one of them one time at a meeting um they were
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:58.800]  looking at distributing a film but the point is is that they're nuts politically uh going back to
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:03.680]  larry pratt larry so you heard my question i mean i mean every time i turn on fox news
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:09.520]  perching up there is carl roe who lives in austin i don't know where he lives i got a friend lives
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:14.320]  two doors down and i know people including somebody in that control room right now who's
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:18.800]  worked with carl roe i'll just leave it that uh behind the scenes you know not not closely but
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:23.280]  seen him multiple times and everybody else i know that knows him but when he's at a conservative event
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:29.840]  he'll look through the curtains like a face in the crowd and say look at those scum idiots
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:37.200]  hillbillies and look at those scum texans and i mean it's literally he's like a demon and uh is it
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:42.880]  okay if i say who who told me that predict i mean christ christ jordan's actually you know
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:47.120]  run sound systems he's witnessed it behind the scenes roe for 30 minutes is talking trash about
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:52.480]  the conservative group and how much he hates them and everything i mean carl roe is literally a demon
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:56.800]  and i don't mean to go off and rant about that but i've been told that by other high powered people
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:01.680]  who've been at tea party events and stuff when he was trying to take it over like four years ago
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:06.800]  now he couldn't do it so he wants to wreck it because they don't want real conservatism they
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:11.360]  want the i'm sorry larry i have you want to be a guest and i'm ranting break down carl roe and
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:17.040]  what the republican establishment is doing you helped make the nra and of course he said it
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:21.200]  here one of the board members that said thank god for you and thank god for his courage at ted
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:27.120]  new jen how do we take over the republican party and what do we do about carl roe well i think
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:32.960]  getting the word out on roe is beginning to help because he was able to raise a lot of money from
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:41.520]  people that would not did not like the way it was being spent and he ended up you know the architect
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:50.000]  uh as he's been misidentified of losing virtually every single race he was in and he's always on
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:56.080]  the liberal side in a primary uh but that's where the fight i think uh certainly one of the dimensions
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:27:04.080]  of the fight can be conducted uh we've endorsed uh mcconnell's opponent in this us senate primary
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:12.000]  there in kentucky coming up next year uh matt bevin uh is a wealthy businessman and seems to be just
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.320]  square on all the issues in addition to our endorsement he's gotten the endorsement of
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:23.040]  all the tea party groups in the state and that gives us a great opportunity because if we can
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:27.680]  take out one of the lead dogs then i think that would be a message that would even be
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:34.880]  sent louder than say taking out lindsay graham which we're also going to be involved in once the
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:41.760]  the uh well assuming he makes it through the first primary ever runoff primary in south carolina
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:47.520]  and the last time i saw some numbers several weeks ago he was at 43 so it's guaranteed that there
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:53.440]  will be a runoff and we're not sure if he's going to be in it good news yeah well what do we do about
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:58.560]  both these guys i mean lindsay graham get him out of the senate um but what do we do about people
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:03.360]  like carl roe i guess just get the word out don't be associated with anything he's involved in i mean
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:08.400]  he took all that money and tried to use it to keep the republican party uh basically the right wing
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:16.160]  of the democratic party absolutely getting the word out that that guy is a not only a bad investment
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:22.480]  uh it's it's like committing suicide politically to contribute to him exactly giving money to carl
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:29.280]  roe was giving money to diane feinstein and obama and it's certainly giving money to the most liberal
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:35.120]  republicans that he can find and then he'll try to paper them over and make them look conservative
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:41.840]  when he's talking to conservative groups uh and he's certainly very smooth uh about doing that when
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:50.080]  he first broke on the scene uh a lot of people viewed him as a conservative but what he is is a
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:56.640]  quite the chameleon uh from what i've learned since he first came uh came into the national scene
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:29:03.360]  he had actually been uh working in a gubernatorial primary for somebody even more liberal than
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:09.440]  george bush when bush won that he hopped on his campaign and he rode that wagon to the white house
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:14.320]  uh this guy's amazing and well really what he is is a hardcore democrat i mean he's the guy that
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:21.440]  got rick perry to flip over being a democrat to a republican and uh it just never ends it just never
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:30.240]  ends but i think we've got a rising tea party sentiment to give it a name uh it was very pronounced
[02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:38.880]  in 2010 and i think the the revelation that the president is a premeditated liar he didn't just
[02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:45.120]  speak an error he conned the america stay there i want to come right back with that now shame shame
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:50.320]  oprah says if you say he's a liar you know what that means larry you've got to get 10 lashes we're

[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:37.360]  all right larry pratt the head of gun owners in america gun owners dot org he uh got cut off
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:42.800]  of the brakes i was bringing up the fact that you're saying obama's a liar but oprah wimbury says
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:48.720]  that that means you're racist and need to die that's a quote of what she had to say so uh there you
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:53.680]  go a hundred million people did sign up obama cares working great i don't want to be called a racist i
[02:33:53.680 --> 02:34:00.480]  agree uh whatever oprah says is gospel but i mean seriously larry pratt getting back into the fact
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:07.520]  of the premeditated lying i you got cut off well i just wanted to comment that the good ladies
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:17.120]  race card has expired and it's no longer being accepted so that that is just so obviously an
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:23.440]  excuse for being stupid and not having an actual argument that they don't have much of an argument
[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:30.960]  after all their guy got caught lying flat-footed so i think this is a a gift that has been given to
[02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:38.640]  us that he's been so nakedly exposed and i'm i'm really hoping that what we saw almost happened
[02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:45.600]  in virginia is going to carry through to the primaries to come and most of my guests will be
[02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:52.080]  next year and we're going to be able to weed out some of these republicans who especially in the
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:59.200]  senate who stuck a knife in uh ted cruz's back when he was doing the right thing and he would
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:07.360]  and thanks to him this one scandal has become a serious problem for the democrat all these other
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:15.440]  scandals never really had anybody developed them prominently uh the way zero care has been
[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:20.160]  and let's quantify that for folks that don't know the republican leadership's all part of the same
[02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:25.040]  globalist power structure now so they always say be nice be moderate but then the other side never
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:30.800]  moderates and and everything's going to be fine and then meanwhile they try to stop a libertarian
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:36.080]  revolution a constitutional revolution when all the polls show the average americans really a libertarian
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:40.480]  even if they're getting assistance they understand libertarianism is the real liberty way to go it's
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:46.640]  what thomas jefferson stood for it's real america it's real americana so that there's a power structure
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:52.880]  republican and democrat doing everything they can right now to try to block this real revolution
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:36:00.640]  from happening 2014 to quote matt drudge is everything so what do we do larry pratt uh
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:06.240]  to to win well we do what ted cruz did you point out it's wrong so there's a debate and so obama
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:12.080]  doesn't just go unchallenged and because there was that little bit of challenge now it's routing the
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:17.600]  daylights out of them is that what you're saying that is what i'm saying i think we owe a lot of
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:25.360]  this to ted cruz because by entering into that talkathon that he conducted i happened to tune
[02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:31.040]  in around eight o'clock in the evening the guy was still lucid he'd been going on for six seven
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:37.840]  hours but he was still on message and that tells me that no matter when somebody might have tuned
[02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:43.760]  in they were getting the straight deal about just what a horrible piece of legislation
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:50.400]  the democrats have put on the book and when a guy like mitch mcconnell goes and whips republicans
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:57.680]  to oppose ted cruz it seems to me uh we now have the kind of information that we can use
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:06.000]  to put a fork in his political career that's right so why do you think mitch mcconnell did that he
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:11.440]  tried to argue hey it's so bad let's just let him have it which i agree with that but you need to
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:16.800]  first explain it's bad and try to stop it to have the moral high ground absolutely and i frankly
[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:23.680]  have no trouble with having the government uh slow down uh the the only reason that it was a
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:29.680]  political problem for the republicans is that they can't speak uh they don't believe in anything
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:37.760]  and it took a ted cruz to to replace the shutdown backlash with the zero care backlash which i think
[02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:43.920]  is going to consume a lot of the republican rhinos as well as the democrats come next year well
[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:47.520]  larry you know what they're afraid of they're afraid of a leader because it won't just be
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:51.920]  somebody to rally behind other people will then realize they can be leaders at city council
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:58.640]  council legislatures governors congress i mean people are hungry for freedom they're hungry for
[02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:04.320]  individualism they're hungry for us to take the country back and that's why as you know democratic
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:08.960]  party strategy meetings with joe biden have been leaked uh documents have been leaked on carl roe
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:14.080]  the republicans they are scared of ted cruz even more than ran paul and i would love to think of
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:19.360]  ran paul is even better than ted cruz because i've known him for literally 16 years 17 years
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:24.960]  and no he's from real he's a great guy but they're really scared of ted cruz why is that i think
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:32.960]  cruz has a way of presenting himself and his information that is clear uh he can say very
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:38.400]  conservative things and it doesn't sound radical at all because they're not and he presents it
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:44.320]  that way and when somebody tries to take him on they're taking on a guy that when he was in the
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:50.560]  school of geniuses at harvard one of his law professors said he was so far above the rest of
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:56.720]  the class that wasn't even close and that was a lefty that said that about ted cruz that the
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:03.520]  fact of the matter is uh the guy can really run circles hey i would just love to see him in a
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:09.760]  presidential debate with give us hillary clinton give us anybody that the democrats might throw up
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:14.720]  he's gonna tie him up and not well what really tells is they're all lining up against him both
[02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:20.080]  parties the entire power structure uh so we need to get even more people like that in so there's
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:27.200]  no way to stop us i think cruz encourages good guys to get involved in political campaigns
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:33.040]  and i think we're beginning to see some of that uh if a guy like cruz can come out of
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:40.960]  relatively nowhere uh he was not in any elected position until he got elected to the u.s senate
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:48.560]  and yet he had been doing things i now learn that was giving him a network he had been in high
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:54.960]  school part of a free enterprise club and they read all kinds of adam smith and belton freedman
[02:39:54.960 --> 02:40:02.480]  type books and then he was in a debate uh i guess they weren't so much debating as they were
[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:08.640]  presenting about the constitution which he had memorized in high school and then five or six of
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:14.160]  them would go out and one of them would recite a part of the or maybe the whole constitution
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:19.680]  it's not that long while the others were writing it on a whiteboard and this was you know this was
[02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:29.200]  his uh exercise as a high school student and he is just so well prepared uh from those experiences
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:35.360]  and he had obviously kept the record of the people with whom he had worked and that he had met as he
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:44.000]  traveled the state and uh when you meet the guy uh you can't not be impressed i was in a meeting
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:49.840]  with him and eight other senators and there were some 40 guys like me uh in the room had
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:55.920]  different conservative groups and cruz made it clear that when he was preparing to take on zero
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:01.120]  care he said look this is a fight that we may lose but it's a fight that we can't avoid we've
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:08.320]  got to enter it to hear a republican say something like that i i can it was looks like water for a
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:13.920]  guy in the desert uh finally exactly because they always say oh don't fight that's they're gonna win
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:19.200]  that is absolutely a lion i want to say this about ted cruz you know obviously smart guys like him
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:24.240]  get scooped up by the establishment so you know his his wife have been part of the council on
[02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:30.640]  farm relations things like that the cfr goes after everybody who's smart and promising the point is
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:36.800]  is that he got away from it and decried it later and his fruits through his whole life have been
[02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:44.000]  good and the establishment is scared of him and he hasn't compromised so we have to own ted cruz
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:50.640]  and ran paul and others and give them the support so they can stand against the establishment i mean
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:56.000]  you know anybody who has high test scores and is smart gets recruited by the establishment we have
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:01.440]  to be ready to win and not just expect if somebody starts having success they must be bad we have to
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:07.680]  go off what they're delivering what they're doing the fruits as christ said and ted cruz's fruits
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:15.120]  are pure gold they absolutely are and i think now it would probably be just as a matter of personal
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:22.800]  social dynamics impossible for cruz to go to the dark side uh john mccain has called him a wacko bird
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:28.560]  well i don't really care what john mccain thinks but when john mccain's insulting a guy that i'm
[02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:36.240]  enjoying watching work then that just it serves as a validation to me that he's not uh schmoozing
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:41.600]  well sure let's just say it mccain is known for literally chewing the carpet and and if anybody's
[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:50.560]  a wacko bird it's him exactly and so i mean even stuff like that cruz handles brilliantly the next
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:56.080]  day he went out on the floor and he said well if being a wacko bird is being pro second amendment
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:43:00.960]  pro life pro family pro limited government pro constitution i think he might have listed a few
[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:07.520]  other things off said well then call me a proud wacko bird exactly normally the the the the the
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:13.840]  dinosaur corporate establishment uh state run media attacks you and people roll over like it
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:18.880]  means something i learned a long time ago they're not that powerful they're even less powerful now
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:24.720]  and when you say i love it give me more and laugh at them it's when you roll over and act like
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:31.840]  they've got you and oh the scandal it's it's all like a mind game you know uh everyone's of other
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:39.520]  people like cruz our founder as uh was california state senator bill richardson and when he was in
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:44.960]  office a bunch of feminists came to him and they were going to uh present him with a misogynist of
[02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:52.160]  the year type of an award and they just kind of walked in the office with the plaque and a photographer
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:56.800]  and he said well can you wait an hour what for it because i want to get all the media in here this
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:10.960]  is really good oh man i tell you look it's time to stop letting the establishment define who patriots
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:17.200]  are it's time for us to point out they're the people wrecking the country do you like living under
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:22.320]  this type of government folks do you like living under socialism and crony capitalism where the
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:27.360]  winners are picked by these mafias or do you want to live in freedom again and they want to always
[02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:33.040]  fight the old injustices and project that on us today when we have nothing to do with that we're
[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:38.000]  trying to bring back what was good in america before that produced more wealth than the world's
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:44.080]  ever seen and it's that simple so so briefly's now you got to go what else larry pratt head of
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:49.200]  gunners of america if you just joined us what's happening on this second amendment radar i know
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:54.080]  we've got the un treaties that they're trying to implement i know we've got at the state level
[02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:59.680]  they're going after our guns bloomberg's trotting people out there's a lot of other fights happening
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:04.080]  what are the threats what's the positive stuff happening for the right to self-defense what's
[02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:10.880]  the negative stuff well one of the good things is they build it senator soon has had that would
[02:45:10.880 --> 02:45:19.120]  basically convert your concealed carry permit into a national permit take your gun anywhere
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:24.480]  in the country you'd have to observe their restrictions but you you wouldn't have to keep
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:29.520]  getting another permit and if you were from one of the four constitutional states where you don't
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:35.200]  even need a permit then your driver's license would suffice and that's a pretty exciting concept that
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:43.440]  kind of blows up liberal heads so we'd like to see that move congressman stockman from near
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:50.240]  houston has a bill that would do away with the gun free zones at schools something that
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:53.840]  desperately needs to be done all of our mass murders have occurred in
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:46:02.960]  gun free zones and why they don't realize that their law is stacking the bodies up
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:07.520]  i just can't understand by the way have you noticed again i'm a libertarian and i'm into
[02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:10.880]  freedom period across the board it just so happens the democrats are totally destroying
[02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:15.120]  the country right now so i'm trying to take over the republicans exactly but but have you noticed
[02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:19.520]  almost all these mass shooters come from like liberal democrats families and they're all into
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:24.800]  weird occult stuff and are on a bunch of drugs and are satan worshipers and video game heads
[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:30.400]  and then i'm getting blamed for what people with green hair that worship the devil are doing yep
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:37.760]  they uh they try to project their shortcomings on to us and we're not buying that that cart has
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:42.880]  expired also and again i'm not against you if you got green hair i'm just saying it happens to be
[02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:48.960]  like prozac heads with green hair who love the devil and have skull shrines in their backyard
[02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:53.840]  i mean i'm not even blaming voodoo people for you know the the arizona shooting but he was a voodoo
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:59.600]  head on drugs i mean why do i get blamed why do you get blamed he had a satanic altar in his backyard
[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:04.480]  that that's pretty creepy yeah we i think we should be if we're gonna profile anybody
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:10.640]  why don't we profile satanist what it teaches us i think is that angry liberals probably should be
[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:16.960]  the exception to our tourist second amendment views because they can't handle guns they are
[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:22.800]  inherently violent and they a lot of them i think realize it and they say well i i wouldn't
[02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:28.000]  trust myself with a gun and i say to that good that's buzz bissinger he said he wanted to kill
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:33.840]  me on air shoot me we see we find the club and then the two guests appears morgan the ambassador's
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:39.200]  daughter and and then uh and then and then the host agreed that he would wear a uniform when he
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:43.680]  did it and then days later when he responded to saying why do you want to kill me he said well
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:48.320]  i shouldn't have said that i'm on masonry medication and that's why no one should own guns
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:53.280]  because i do bad things if i had one i'm like now i see why they're so scared of having guns
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:59.840]  because they are lunatics they assume that we are in the same boat with them and that just is
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:10.080]  not true in fact the gun owners i talk to are uh extremely concerned that anything might happen
[02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:17.280]  while they're packing and so they will they will go away from a problem they will go away from
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:22.320]  somebody that's insulting and by the way the statistics as you know show that uh that the
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:27.440]  concealed carry holders have the lowest crime rate period lower than the cops by a good measure
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:34.720]  that's right because it's exactly it's concealed carry than cops lowest crime rate yep uh they're
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:40.160]  the choir boys of our society and yet they're the ones that these uh the folks that we're talking
[02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:46.800]  about who think that guns are icky uh they're the ones really with the problem and it's just
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:53.840]  we've got to push back against that these people are not credible and uh their car is expired i'm
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:57.600]  sorry what do you think's happening politically that we're having major victory just because of
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:03.200]  the fruits of the communists and the socialists and the people are so horrible but but in one
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:07.200]  that we've got left larry pratt how are they going to counter strike at us i mean there could
[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:12.320]  be another mass shooting at another victim disarmament zone any day now uh how do you see
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:17.920]  them coming back at us that's a possibility but you know i think they really thought they had
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:25.360]  us after newtown and sandy hook and frankly uh if anything it made their situation worse and
[02:49:25.360 --> 02:49:33.040]  backfired thanks to cruise and leah in particular uh we won the gunfight in april uh and uh when
[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:38.880]  we started that didn't look good again we almost lost if it wasn't for cruise and paul and people
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:42.640]  would say oh they're not perfect or whatever what are you talking about they're the only reason we're
[02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:47.680]  having victories and the system's scared we're going to put a hundred more in there we're going to
[02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:55.440]  try yeah we can just get carl roe if i tell you what a piece of trash gun owners dot org larry

[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:31.680]  the name of them but aren't these progressives really they're for the progression of tyranny
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:36.800]  well and let's say it the president's mask is off and now we're looking at a communist so
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:43.200]  that's that's not a bit of rocket science nor is it a news flash i think many of us have now
[02:50:43.200 --> 02:50:49.600]  doped it out that the guys whole education was by communists so what do you expect that's right

[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:20.320]  look at this headline out of politico judge won't allow holder appeal now in contempt case
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:24.320]  for fast and furious and other issues as well are now coming to the forum
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:31.760]  so we've got articles like that one right there breaking that down and then here's another
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:38.880]  interesting headline since this faked new york post reports 2012 election jobs report
[02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:46.960]  really they're saying that there's fake data on jobs and fake data on inflation no
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:53.360]  well corporations go out and get real data for their decision making we know what the real
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:58.800]  unemployment is we know what the real inflation is and it's basically double what they're saying
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:05.360]  in every case and this is the type of deception that we're seeing look at this article out of
[02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:10.560]  the guardian this is what i told you about in 1997 when i first learned about it when insiders
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:15.280]  told me what to look at the telecommunications act they've built a whole separate internet a
[02:56:15.280 --> 02:56:20.800]  whole separate telecom that you have to pay for in quotes security fees that are on your bills
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:26.080]  for these companies to actually be paid not just the cost of the equipment but the cost of
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:30.400]  administering it so it's one of the biggest profit centers basically in some cases doubling the price
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:36.560]  of telecommunications just like it increases the cost of an iphone or droid all the spy tech in it
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:41.840]  it's mandated in there private firms selling mass surveillance systems around the world
[02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:48.480]  document show one dubai based firm offers d i y system similar to the gchq's
[02:56:48.480 --> 02:56:56.400]  temporia program which taps fiber optic cables and that gchq's that their nsa in england so this
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:57:02.240]  is what they've got whole rooms and floors at every telecom with government and corporate
[02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:08.880]  contracts to pay for the spine and the word is they even have patented google patents on this
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:15.200]  with the cameras the microphones but it goes both ways the nsa is then giving google and then google
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:19.920]  gives them data what you're talking about on the phone and what they call metadata but metadata
[02:57:19.920 --> 02:57:26.400]  means your profile talking about dog food talking about you know stand up desks talking about whatever
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:30.720]  and now everybody i know start to see as they go i never searched this online cj was telling me
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:35.360]  about this i've never looked this up i talk about on the phone a bunch a day later it's on my phone
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:41.120]  and on my computer ads well guess what there's a patent for that and people better just understand

[03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:42.160]  article by watson i was reading during the right before last new media wars the empire strikes back
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:45.920]  establishment seeks to assimilate or eliminate independent media yeah they're not gonna just
[03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:52.640]  give up easily ran paul a handset 2016 presidential run says americans are looking for someone like
[03:00:52.640 --> 03:00:57.760]  himself this is the big story i'm going to tweet out right when the show ends at real alex jones
[03:00:57.760 --> 03:01:06.400]  please retweet this uh texas to protest censorship of free speech in dallas texas jfk events
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:12.240]  or at dallas texas jfk events that's a very important article explain the demonstration i've
[03:01:12.240 --> 03:01:16.960]  got coming up tomorrow night in dallas the first one it's key to be there folks and then coming
[03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:22.720]  soon biometric fingerprint scan just to leave the airport that is really a big story they have these
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:28.160]  locking cage doors you go into now and then you've got a biometrically scan when you leave again just
[03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:32.480]  all part of training you that you're a prisoner while the government runs alcada publicly also
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:37.680]  again i already mentioned this but it's pretty powerful info the october 2012 pre-election jobs
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:44.960]  report was a fake of course it was uh and again a really big story i didn't get to by michael schneider
[03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:48.960]  we can't do anything about the antibiotic resistant superbugs some are immune to it
[03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:53.360]  that will kill millions yeah it's already getting really bad that's why i got to be dying to get
[03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:58.960]  near a hospital you got to go to newer high-end clinics that's where everybody's going now folks
[03:01:58.960 --> 03:02:02.960]  now i don't even have to go i just know what the establishment's doing you do not want to get near
[03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:11.040]  a hospital especially an old one i mean they are death traps most powerful bacteria and viruses that
[03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:18.720]  that like disinfectants and iodine can't kill and stuff that has been drug resistant i mean it is
[03:02:18.720 --> 03:02:25.920]  just in there literally see they have what you call immortal cell lines in cells and bacteria but also
[03:02:25.920 --> 03:02:33.360]  similar superviruses that just cannot be killed the only way to kill immortal cell lines and
[03:02:33.360 --> 03:02:40.000]  human tissue is to burn them in fact people say there's no science to zombies there isn't in the
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:48.560]  biochemical electrochemical locomotion of a human body but in cells there are zombies
[03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:56.240]  a literal undead zombos that you can put in a petri dish of water and 50 years later they're still
[03:02:56.240 --> 03:03:02.080]  there i mean it's incredible ladies and gentlemen and basically that's what all these drugs and
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:09.840]  chemicals are doing is like in a hitlerian super race uh you know uh evolution where
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:14.160]  we want to call it where where only the most powerful it's like insects two or three generations
[03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:19.120]  of insects they become resistant and then 10 generations or so on average immune to pesticide
[03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:24.720]  well it's the same thing with bugs they're dividing even faster and they are getting tougher and
[03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:27.840]  tougher and tougher people say well what do you believe in the third evolution no no no
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:34.640]  things get immunity things do evolve just not the way the scientists say and then the preachers they
[03:03:34.640 --> 03:03:40.320]  don't define for me science that's all of it to trick with with preachers defining what the bible
[03:03:40.320 --> 03:03:45.360]  is saying i'll read that for myself thank you it makes a lot of sense not with some preacher who
[03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:49.680]  doesn't even know how to tie a shoelaces tells me or certainly some scientists with an agenda
[03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:58.240]  does that make sense because we see evolution in bacteria in viruses in computers in automobiles
[03:03:58.240 --> 03:04:04.320]  in understanding people say that there is entropy in the universe but there's also ascendancy
[03:04:04.320 --> 03:04:09.120]  there's also things becoming more complex more advanced there's everything in the universe
[03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:15.520]  there's constant change but constant flux but constant non change in the whole fractal
[03:04:16.320 --> 03:04:23.440]  mass design there's everything and nothing pretty zen isn't it all right folks i'm out of time
[03:04:24.160 --> 03:04:29.520]  but please come and see us up in dallas tomorrow night eight o'clock at the fellow reserve on
