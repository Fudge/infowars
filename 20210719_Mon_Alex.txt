[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  Who would have guessed that the Chinese communists would improve their big country as much as
[00:12.480 --> 00:14.480]  they have in the last 30 years?
[00:14.480 --> 00:17.280]  Charlie Munger is one of the board members of Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:17.280 --> 00:21.840]  He's like 90-something years old, and he is the main advisor to Warren Buffett and Bill
[00:21.840 --> 00:22.840]  Gates.
[00:22.840 --> 00:23.840]  He's both their personal lawyer.
[00:23.840 --> 00:28.680]  And Charlie Munger was on national television last week, and he said the goal is Communist
[00:28.680 --> 00:29.680]  China.
[00:29.680 --> 00:30.680]  We don't want to be like Communist China.
[00:30.680 --> 00:35.640]  We want to arrest anybody we want for any reason if they don't do what the big corporations
[00:35.640 --> 00:36.640]  want.
[00:36.640 --> 00:37.640]  And the lady said, really?
[00:37.640 --> 00:38.640]  He goes, absolutely.
[00:38.640 --> 00:44.920]  If we don't like what you're doing, Sonny, we just send you to a work camp.
[00:44.920 --> 00:46.160]  You say, why is he saying that?
[00:46.160 --> 00:47.680]  Well, he's not saying it because he's seen all.
[00:47.680 --> 00:49.560]  He's saying he's an evil monster.
[00:49.560 --> 00:54.640]  It was one of the most remarkable things that ever happened in the history of the world
[00:54.640 --> 01:02.040]  when a bunch of committed communists just looked at the prosperity of places like Singapore
[01:02.040 --> 01:05.160]  and said, the hell with this, we're not going to stay here in poverty.
[01:05.160 --> 01:07.960]  We're going to copy what works.
[01:07.960 --> 01:09.960]  And they changed communism.
[01:09.960 --> 01:16.440]  They just accepted Adam Smith and added it to their communism and said, now we have communism
[01:16.440 --> 01:18.560]  with Chinese characteristics.
[01:18.560 --> 01:24.920]  The Americans would like to think that our free expression and allowing all kinds of opinion
[01:24.920 --> 01:31.040]  and all kinds of criticism of the government is totally essential part of the economy.
[01:31.040 --> 01:37.160]  And what the Chinese have proved is you can have a scrimmally successful economy with
[01:37.160 --> 01:39.320]  a fairly controlling government.
[01:39.320 --> 01:41.680]  I can play you for dough of Canada.
[01:41.680 --> 01:47.000]  One of the challenges of previous governments is there was often sort of a hard or cold
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.160]  approach on China.
[01:48.160 --> 01:53.800]  We've been very much trying to be consistent in looking for economic opportunities, looking
[01:53.800 --> 01:59.400]  for ways to benefit from access to an extraordinary growing market of hundreds of millions of
[01:59.400 --> 02:02.200]  people who are part of the global middle class in China.
[02:02.200 --> 02:05.360]  They all praise Xi Jinping and say, he's the model.
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.240]  They have a fascination with authoritarianism and this happens right before you have a big
[02:09.240 --> 02:10.240]  war.
[02:10.240 --> 02:15.280]  This is an authoritarian move by globalists and by the UN and it's all announced and
[02:15.280 --> 02:16.280]  it's all here.
[02:16.280 --> 02:18.760]  So then you ask, why the hell would they roll something out?
[02:18.760 --> 02:19.760]  They know it's going to do that.
[02:19.760 --> 02:20.960]  How are they going to get away with it?
[02:20.960 --> 02:24.800]  Because they're planning on launching something even bigger, a total financial collapse and
[02:24.800 --> 02:26.480]  or a major war or both.
[02:26.480 --> 02:29.440]  And they think that that will then cover up the last crime they committed.
[02:29.440 --> 02:33.200]  You only commit yourself to an assault like this that will lay down a bankrupt society
[02:33.200 --> 02:36.400]  known as a soft kill if you're fully absolutely committed.
[02:36.400 --> 02:42.360]  But first, here is the head of the Global UN Rapid Reaction Force, Dr. Michael Ryan telling
[02:42.360 --> 02:45.920]  you in April last year, 16 months ago, the plan.
[02:45.920 --> 02:49.320]  We advised that all contacts should be quarantined.
[02:49.320 --> 02:54.800]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove
[02:54.800 --> 02:59.080]  them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[02:59.080 --> 03:04.000]  Did you hear that total power, total control, total martial law, the UN setting the policy?
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.040]  And he said when they're sporadic or almost no cases, there are towns in Australia and
[03:08.040 --> 03:12.160]  in Canada shut down still a year and a half later and major cities have been shut down
[03:12.160 --> 03:13.520]  again because they have one case.
[03:13.520 --> 03:16.160]  Or they go, oh, there's a Delta variant.
[03:16.160 --> 03:17.160]  And where did it come from?
[03:17.160 --> 03:21.440]  This lab run by Fauci in the UN so they could fear monger.
[03:21.440 --> 03:27.520]  Gates has these incestuous relationships with Anthony Fauci that go back 20 years where
[03:27.520 --> 03:33.400]  he's paying Fauci and they have all kinds of really corrupt financial entanglements
[03:33.400 --> 03:34.400]  with each other.
[03:34.400 --> 03:41.080]  They, you know, he brought Fauci to his house in 2000 and brought him into the den, sat
[03:41.080 --> 03:44.080]  him down and said, I want to have a partnership with you.
[03:44.080 --> 03:53.440]  The way that Fauci explains it is that Fauci would develop the drugs and then pass them
[03:53.440 --> 04:01.640]  on to the drug companies, Merck, Sanofi, Gilead, Johnson & Johnson.
[04:01.640 --> 04:07.480]  Gates would then guarantee markets in Africa through his control of WHO.
[04:07.480 --> 04:13.640]  He can require those companies, those countries to buy the vaccines from these companies and
[04:13.640 --> 04:17.480]  he then is invested in the companies.
[04:17.480 --> 04:23.360]  Now you've got Charlie Munger, a Rockefeller operative, head lawyer for Bill Gates and
[04:23.360 --> 04:26.920]  Warren Buffett saying, I want to live like communist China.
[04:26.920 --> 04:30.280]  I want to arrest anybody I don't like.
[04:30.280 --> 04:31.280]  See how it works?
[04:31.280 --> 04:36.560]  And now the Rockefeller Foundation is in charge of the entire federal government's
[04:36.560 --> 04:37.760]  medical response.
[04:37.760 --> 04:40.280]  Bill Gates had to step down.
[04:40.280 --> 04:43.680]  His foundation got removed from command.
[04:43.680 --> 04:49.040]  And what did I tell you hundreds of times last year and a half, who was in command of
[04:49.040 --> 04:50.040]  Bill Gates?
[04:50.040 --> 04:51.040]  Who was in command?
[04:51.040 --> 04:52.040]  Who was in command?
[04:52.040 --> 04:53.040]  Who was in command?
[04:53.040 --> 04:54.040]  Who was in command?
[04:54.040 --> 04:55.040]  Rockefeller Foundation.
[04:55.040 --> 04:56.040]  Who was in command?
[04:56.040 --> 05:02.480]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[05:02.480 --> 05:06.720]  First off, green fiber capsules, highest quality fiber you're going to find with all
[05:06.720 --> 05:09.720]  the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[05:09.720 --> 05:11.400]  This is an incredible formula.
[05:11.400 --> 05:12.680]  Everybody should be taking it.
[05:12.680 --> 05:15.600]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[05:15.600 --> 05:16.720]  It's an amazing product.
[05:16.720 --> 05:17.880]  It's our newest product.
[05:17.880 --> 05:21.200]  It's 50% off out of the Gates, infowars.org.com.
[05:21.200 --> 05:24.520]  Then we have both types of X2s, the exact same X2 with a bottle.
[05:24.520 --> 05:29.480]  But one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap for 60 and 40% off, depending on which
[05:29.480 --> 05:30.480]  one.
[05:30.480 --> 05:31.480]  They're both excellent at infowars.org.com.
[05:31.480 --> 05:36.520]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of
[05:36.520 --> 05:39.640]  the good halogen and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[05:39.640 --> 05:41.880]  It's all available at infowarsstore.com.
[05:41.880 --> 05:47.760]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off, and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper
[05:47.760 --> 05:50.320]  bottle for 60 and 40% off.
[05:50.320 --> 05:52.200]  And it funds the infowar.
[05:52.200 --> 06:10.160]  It's deeper crystal iodine for itself, and keep your gut healthy at infowarsstore.com.
[06:10.160 --> 06:14.880]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:14.880 --> 06:16.600]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:16.600 --> 06:18.160]  Well so does he.
[06:18.160 --> 06:25.920]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:25.920 --> 06:29.320]  Today is the first full day of the New World Order.
[06:29.320 --> 06:32.560]  Outdoor gatherings are limited to two people.
[06:32.560 --> 06:36.600]  Exercise is allowed, but no further than a 10 kilometre radius from your home.
[06:36.600 --> 06:38.720]  Browsing in shops is not permitted.
[06:38.720 --> 06:42.480]  Only one person per household may leave to do essential shopping.
[06:42.480 --> 06:45.360]  And from tomorrow, funerals are limited to 10 people.
[06:45.360 --> 06:48.440]  This is a world pandemic, it's a 100 year event.
[06:48.440 --> 06:53.560]  So you can expect that we will have transmission from time to time, and that's just the way
[06:53.560 --> 06:54.560]  it is.
[06:54.560 --> 06:56.360]  We've got to accept that this is the New World Order.
[06:56.360 --> 06:58.680]  We've got to accept that this is the New World Order.
[06:58.680 --> 07:00.120]  This is the New World Order.
[07:00.120 --> 07:01.680]  This is the New World Order.
[07:01.680 --> 07:04.400]  Today is the first full day of the New World Order.
[07:04.400 --> 07:05.520]  The New World Order.
[07:05.520 --> 07:07.880]  The New World New World New World Order.
[07:07.880 --> 07:10.720]  I want to be straight with you.
[07:10.720 --> 07:16.360]  There will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future.
[07:16.360 --> 07:22.080]  I repeat, there will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future.
[07:22.080 --> 07:30.080]  So people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had, and everything
[07:30.080 --> 07:36.320]  will be normal again in how we are used to normal in the old fashioned.
[07:36.320 --> 07:39.240]  This is, let's say, fiction.
[07:39.240 --> 07:40.240]  It will not happen.
[07:40.240 --> 07:45.800]  A vaccine on its own will not end the pandemic.
[07:45.800 --> 07:48.240]  Surveillance will need to continue.
[07:48.240 --> 07:53.120]  People will still need to be tested, isolated, and cared for.
[07:53.120 --> 07:57.360]  Contacts will still need to be traced and quarantined.
[07:57.360 --> 08:00.280]  Communities will still need to be engaged.
[08:00.280 --> 08:04.800]  It is a big idea, a New World Order.
[08:04.800 --> 08:12.760]  We can find meaning and reward by serving some higher purpose than ourselves.
[08:12.760 --> 08:14.520]  A shining purpose.
[08:14.520 --> 08:17.200]  The illumination of a thousand points of light.
[08:17.200 --> 08:22.680]  It's no longer a theory, what I'm about to say is fact.
[08:22.680 --> 08:27.280]  The secret organizations of the World Power Elite are no longer secret.
[08:27.280 --> 08:32.100]  They have planned and are now leading us into a one-world communist government.
[08:32.100 --> 08:37.760]  This is terrorism of the most worst kind, brought on you by our own government.
[08:37.760 --> 08:53.600]  It's a lead in shaping a New World Order for the 21st century.
[08:53.600 --> 08:56.760]  It was just last week that the Pope announced World Government, the Australian Government
[08:56.760 --> 09:01.120]  announced World Government, and permanent lockdowns, and now the U.N. has come out over
[09:01.120 --> 09:05.160]  the weekend and said, lives will never go back to normal, you will always wear a mask
[09:05.160 --> 09:10.080]  and you will be controlled by an app on your phone that tells you when you can go outside
[09:10.080 --> 09:12.320]  and where you can go.
[09:12.320 --> 09:15.720]  So they're leaping into total absolute tyranny all at once.
[09:15.720 --> 09:20.600]  All the major governments are working in concert together except for a handful that are not
[09:20.600 --> 09:21.680]  under globalist control.
[09:21.680 --> 09:23.240]  They're all under siege though.
[09:23.240 --> 09:29.480]  Those that are fighting back like Hungary and Romania and Brazil and the U.S. has basically
[09:29.480 --> 09:33.480]  already been taken over at the federal level, though there is major opposition here, the
[09:33.480 --> 09:35.400]  most opposition to the New World Order.
[09:35.400 --> 09:40.880]  There is on the planet, but the enemy is pouring everything they've got into the takeover.
[09:40.880 --> 09:45.960]  We have big tech openly working with governments and authoritarian regimes around the world
[09:45.960 --> 09:49.760]  to suppress their populations and to suppress us.
[09:49.760 --> 09:50.760]  It's incredible.
[09:50.760 --> 09:56.280]  You have the Surgeon General coming out and saying that the Rockefeller Foundation is
[09:56.280 --> 09:59.280]  in charge of U.S. health policy.
[09:59.280 --> 10:03.480]  It was Bill Gates, and I told you before it was even announced four months ago that he
[10:03.480 --> 10:09.200]  was being removed from command, according to my high-level sources that have seldom
[10:09.200 --> 10:10.200]  been wrong.
[10:10.200 --> 10:14.400]  I could also look at the tea leaves and tell you that was the case.
[10:14.400 --> 10:20.120]  And now you've seen the halo move from him to the Rockefeller Foundation to now be in
[10:20.120 --> 10:21.120]  charge.
[10:21.120 --> 10:25.360]  It was always the Rockefeller Foundation that was running Gates.
[10:25.360 --> 10:29.480]  The director of the CIA is the former head of the Carnegie Endowment he stepped down
[10:29.480 --> 10:32.240]  eight months ago to take over.
[10:32.240 --> 10:38.280]  So we're seeing the project of the robber barons, the project of the British royalty,
[10:38.280 --> 10:44.360]  the project of Cecil Rhodes, they expanded against us right now, and how do these three
[10:44.360 --> 10:46.640]  big stacks tie together?
[10:46.640 --> 10:50.680]  The U.S. Surgeon General Rockefeller Foundation announced big initiatives to address urgent
[10:50.680 --> 10:54.440]  threat of vaccine misinformation, which is the actual truth.
[10:54.440 --> 10:58.640]  That protects you from COVID viruses, they now admit that, that makes you very, very
[10:58.640 --> 11:04.680]  sick, attacks your ovaries, attacks your brain and heart, and they got half the public won't
[11:04.680 --> 11:09.680]  take it and they need to get 80, 90% to do it so they can bully that 10% and bring in
[11:09.680 --> 11:10.680]  tyranny against them.
[11:10.680 --> 11:14.040]  But they can't bully 30%, 40%, 50%, 50%.
[11:14.040 --> 11:17.760]  And as soon as the public realizes they've been poisoned, which is starting to happen,
[11:17.760 --> 11:23.120]  they're going to be in deep trouble, so they need to hurt and maim and kill as many of us
[11:23.120 --> 11:27.600]  with the soft-kill weapons so that nobody's healthy in a year or two when there's dawns
[11:27.600 --> 11:28.600]  on folks.
[11:28.600 --> 11:33.880]  I mean, this is not rhetoric, this is happening.
[11:33.880 --> 11:39.200]  Continuing, Democrats want to monitor your text and use aggressive fact checkers to dispel
[11:39.200 --> 11:40.720]  vaccine misinformation.
[11:40.720 --> 11:48.920]  It's already been announced, White House flagging posts for Facebook to censor over COVID misinformation
[11:48.920 --> 11:50.480]  and who directs that?
[11:50.480 --> 11:58.280]  The Rockefeller and Carnegie Endowment, through a quote, anti-racist organization funded itself
[11:58.280 --> 12:05.240]  again by the ADL's and the Public Law Center, they're now listing if you criticize open borders,
[12:05.240 --> 12:09.960]  if you criticize lockdowns, if you criticize any of it, you are a terrorist, that's in
[12:09.960 --> 12:13.480]  the national directives that are now public.
[12:13.480 --> 12:18.800]  And that ties in with Biden administration, announces censorship bureau that will spy
[12:18.800 --> 12:20.680]  on Americans.
[12:20.680 --> 12:24.000]  Continuing, who runs that censorship bureau?
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.360]  Oh, well, it's Jen Psaki and the Democrats.
[12:28.360 --> 12:33.880]  You trust this crew to determine which political speech counts is disinformation and which American
[12:33.880 --> 12:36.960]  citizens should be barred from social media, right?
[12:36.960 --> 12:42.480]  Jen Psaki famously said that she'd been told by dozens of intel officials that it was Russians
[12:42.480 --> 12:46.760]  lying about the laptop that didn't exist, but Hunter now admits it does exist and it
[12:46.760 --> 12:47.760]  is his laptop.
[12:47.760 --> 12:55.520]  Oh, and look at this, emails confirmed, Hunter Biden wrote Facebook's Adam Connorm and had
[12:55.520 --> 12:58.080]  him remove a count that attacked him.
[12:58.080 --> 13:02.400]  Yes, that's your fact checker, he's also a journalism professor with an honorary degree
[13:02.400 --> 13:16.720]  now teaching in New Orleans, he's Hunter, the Chinese spy, crackhead, pedophile, hunter.
[13:16.720 --> 13:20.960]  That's your fact checkers, and that ties into this.
[13:20.960 --> 13:26.640]  They had a bunch of DHS officials, both current and former, from the Clinton, Obama, and now
[13:26.640 --> 13:34.160]  Biden dictatorship coming out and saying over the weekend on all the news shows that the
[13:34.160 --> 13:42.160]  Republican Party is now the number one national security threat, told you that's what that
[13:42.160 --> 13:48.360]  big national announcement did a month ago declaring anybody questions elections, anybody
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.760]  questions open borders, anybody questions anything, anybody questions lockdowns, oh,
[13:52.760 --> 13:57.080]  you are a white supremacist and they define that as terrorism, they can define whatever
[13:57.080 --> 14:01.080]  they want, they're dictators, getting ready for war with the American people.
[14:01.080 --> 14:10.000]  That all ties in, and we will tie it in next segment to this key stack of news right here,
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  and that is the communist Chinese hacking into Microsoft.
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.400]  They didn't hack into Microsoft, Bill Gates gave them full access to it along with the
[14:19.400 --> 14:23.360]  current head, and I told you this years ago, I'm going to tell you the rest of the story
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.360]  we come back, they're just covering their bases right now so that China can leverage
[14:27.360 --> 14:31.520]  its power and control over us and hold its hostage and we'll have little excuses and
[14:31.520 --> 14:37.040]  reasons why, and that ties into this next story, US accuses Chinese intelligence agents
[14:37.040 --> 14:44.040]  of master mining hacks on Microsoft and others worldwide, leads to exposed global abuse of
[14:44.040 --> 14:48.600]  cyber weapon to target politicians, activists, and journalists by Israel, we'll talk about
[14:48.600 --> 14:55.320]  that when we come back, that's Reuters, Israel firms, spyware, used to target journalists,
[14:55.320 --> 15:01.520]  cell phones, big story there, but what's the rest of the story, we'll be getting into all
[15:01.520 --> 15:05.680]  of it in the next segment then.
[15:05.680 --> 15:11.840]  Pre-humanity is really pushing back around the world, millions of people protested in
[15:11.840 --> 15:20.120]  France, but they would only show one shot of one square, there was clearly over 100,000
[15:20.120 --> 15:27.400]  against the ongoing lockdowns, against all the things that are being pushed right now,
[15:27.400 --> 15:31.560]  the forced inoculations, the total tyranny, so good for the French standing up because
[15:31.560 --> 15:36.600]  it's coming here next with the UN announcing and pushing their permanent lockdown, that
[15:36.600 --> 15:42.920]  is the headline of the main broadcast show today, I hope you'll share it from Infowars.com.
[15:42.920 --> 15:48.600]  Planetary tyranny is here, UN announces permanent lockdown, you wake up and the UN's in charge
[15:48.600 --> 15:52.800]  of your speech, your medicine, your life, and leaving your house and rolling out the new
[15:52.800 --> 16:00.360]  digital ID on your smartphone to be able to even have a life.
[16:00.360 --> 16:06.520]  Your voice counts, when you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[16:06.520 --> 16:11.520]  the world, the globalists know their agenda is unpopular, they know you're angry, and
[16:11.520 --> 16:16.520]  now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[16:16.520 --> 16:21.000]  Well ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can

[16:58.320 --> 17:02.480]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast, hell I've been
[17:02.480 --> 17:06.600]  on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that, but let me tell you,
[17:06.600 --> 17:10.920]  the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming
[17:10.920 --> 17:14.720]  after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down, so please pray to keep
[17:14.720 --> 17:19.040]  Infowars on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as well,
[17:19.040 --> 17:25.000]  at the same time go to infowarsstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.880]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[17:29.880 --> 17:31.360]  in the face of this thing.
[17:31.360 --> 17:36.240]  I need your help more than ever now, I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't
[17:36.240 --> 17:41.480]  do it if you don't support us, so pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast
[17:41.480 --> 17:46.400]  however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every
[17:46.400 --> 17:51.120]  day at infowarsstore.com, whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements, or books
[17:51.120 --> 17:56.880]  or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human
[17:56.880 --> 17:59.360]  and pro-god, thank you so much.
[17:59.360 --> 18:04.600]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years, deep earth crystal iodine, the
[18:04.600 --> 18:09.880]  good halogen in its essential for all actions in the body, you must have it to live.
[18:09.880 --> 18:13.000]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't
[18:13.000 --> 18:14.000]  have it if iodine.
[18:14.000 --> 18:18.000]  We have X2 in two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray
[18:18.000 --> 18:24.400]  top, one has a dropper top, 60% off on the spray top, 40% off on the dropper top for
[18:24.400 --> 18:26.920]  a limited time because they're both selling out.
[18:26.920 --> 18:29.480]  I want to thank all of the supporters that have gotten these over the years, they're
[18:29.480 --> 18:33.720]  amazing, so that's a great deal for you to stock up on it, but this deal is really for
[18:33.720 --> 18:37.960]  folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[18:37.960 --> 18:42.880]  So X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle, 60 and 40% off for a limited time
[18:42.880 --> 18:46.800]  because it's selling out right now at M4WareStore.com, but we're going to keep this still going
[18:46.800 --> 18:49.560]  until it sells out and probably take about two weeks.
[18:49.560 --> 18:53.920]  Don't procrastinate, take advantage of this special right now at M4WareStore.com and check
[18:53.920 --> 19:01.400]  out the new products we just got in as well.
[19:01.400 --> 19:16.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[19:16.720 --> 19:31.480]  All right, there's a saying on the internet that's put out millions of times a month that
[19:31.480 --> 19:35.080]  it's a very positive thing to say and it's a maxim that really upsets the globalist and
[19:35.080 --> 19:39.080]  if it got big enough it could bring down their new world order.
[19:39.080 --> 19:43.880]  Their transhumanist post-human tyranny will still have corruption, will still have problems,
[19:43.880 --> 19:47.080]  will still be falling creatures, but will be in a lot better position.
[19:47.080 --> 19:53.240]  And that's Alex Jones was right and there's another hashtag going around now where people
[19:53.240 --> 19:58.520]  just basically say it's Alex Jones' world, we're just living in it.
[19:58.520 --> 20:01.280]  I'm not arrogant and I don't think that at all.
[20:01.280 --> 20:08.440]  It's not Alex Jones' world and we're certainly not just living in that, it's Satan's world
[20:08.440 --> 20:14.720]  and he's got a lease on it for a limited number of time to test us and then it will be taken
[20:14.720 --> 20:15.720]  away from him.
[20:15.720 --> 20:19.960]  And whether you believe in a literal devil or not, the devil believes in you and you
[20:19.960 --> 20:26.760]  study these globalists, they are the most vicious, hateful, cunning, soulless people
[20:26.760 --> 20:32.560]  you can imagine and they do serve an evil force and they will tell you they did.
[20:32.560 --> 20:37.320]  So just keep that in the back of your mind when we're understanding this that as negative
[20:37.320 --> 20:41.800]  as things get, praise God, God's real and prophecy is being fulfilled.
[20:41.800 --> 20:47.000]  And just as the Bible says, the church will fall away and endorse the antichrist, but
[20:47.000 --> 20:53.000]  then the antichrist will start killing everybody after running stuff really nice for a while
[20:53.000 --> 20:58.240]  and giving people all these wonders and all this great science and all this life extension.
[20:58.240 --> 21:01.320]  That's really human science, they've been suppressing.
[21:01.320 --> 21:06.600]  It's all a magic trick, but then he will turn on the planet and start killing people in
[21:06.600 --> 21:07.600]  the mass.
[21:07.600 --> 21:09.640]  Well, they're already doing it.
[21:09.640 --> 21:11.360]  And so this isn't the beginning of the end times.
[21:11.360 --> 21:15.280]  I don't know what is or or if God didn't real, the devil isn't real.
[21:15.280 --> 21:22.760]  We've just manifested what people imagined 2000 years ago in the desert of Israel.
[21:22.760 --> 21:26.400]  The desert of Palestine, whatever you want to call it.
[21:26.400 --> 21:28.560]  So that's where we are right now.
[21:28.560 --> 21:34.920]  And let me just do this, I'm going to come back next segment and hit the huge US accuses
[21:34.920 --> 21:39.200]  Chinese intelligence of master mining hacks of Microsoft and other worldwide and kind
[21:39.200 --> 21:40.200]  of unpack that.
[21:40.200 --> 21:46.560]  And why is there an even bigger story dwarfing that about an Israeli firm spying on the press,
[21:46.560 --> 21:49.480]  which by the way, I think it's terrible and if it's true, they should go to prison.
[21:49.480 --> 21:53.120]  But why is that being reported on?
[21:53.120 --> 21:57.240]  And that's a bigger story than China hacking billions of files.
[21:57.240 --> 22:02.200]  Well, I've got the rest of the story for you and we're going to break it all down coming
[22:02.200 --> 22:04.520]  up on the other side.
[22:04.520 --> 22:08.480]  And then the huge COVID-19 global lockdown part two is already here.
[22:08.480 --> 22:09.480]  It'll be here very, very soon.
[22:09.480 --> 22:13.800]  It'll be announced in Los Angeles and other areas within a month or two, maximum in my
[22:13.800 --> 22:15.040]  view.
[22:15.040 --> 22:19.160]  But the Federal Reserve last week said they're preparing for more lockdowns.
[22:19.160 --> 22:22.480]  That's why the stock market's plunged as of going live 700 points.
[22:22.480 --> 22:24.280]  Let's look at the Dow Jones industrial average.
[22:24.280 --> 22:26.520]  Maybe put that on screen for folks.
[22:26.520 --> 22:28.880]  But we're going to be looking at all that.
[22:28.880 --> 22:33.920]  But you yelling said, it looks like more lockdowns are going to be needed.
[22:33.920 --> 22:36.680]  Once again, destroys the real economy, puts everybody deeper into debt.
[22:36.680 --> 22:41.360]  The government gives you inflated currency which furthers inflation and then pretends
[22:41.360 --> 22:47.240]  like it's a lifeboat while they're busy trying to push you under the water.
[22:47.240 --> 22:53.000]  Well, it was down 700, now it's down 445.
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.600]  So we'll watch all of that as it unfolds today.
[22:57.600 --> 23:02.680]  But let me just do this because this is something exciting and it's something that really is
[23:02.680 --> 23:08.000]  a win-win-win-win-win-win-win and is next level 360 win.
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.040]  Everything I've ever done here is from my philosophy that I didn't give a name 27 years
[23:13.040 --> 23:18.760]  ago but that I did in the last decade and that's a 360 win or what would be called in
[23:18.760 --> 23:25.080]  science a non-zero sum game.
[23:25.080 --> 23:27.440]  People believe that there's only a pie this big and you've got to have winners, you've
[23:27.440 --> 23:28.440]  got to have losers.
[23:28.440 --> 23:33.280]  So with the technology and with our ingenuity and with our minds, if we turn loose innovation
[23:33.280 --> 23:39.560]  and celebrate competitiveness and celebrate the individual, humans can basically do anything
[23:39.560 --> 23:40.560]  we want.
[23:40.560 --> 23:47.080]  We can do horrible things, we can do mediocre things, we can do incredibly powerful, amazing,
[23:47.080 --> 23:52.280]  beautiful things, good things and it really is up to what we want to do with the power
[23:52.280 --> 23:57.680]  God's given us with these incredible brains and our incredible imagination and ingenuity.
[23:57.680 --> 24:00.640]  But I've never seen a 360 like this.
[24:00.640 --> 24:06.760]  Michael Lindell who's coming on in the third hour today, my pillow, gets criticized a lot
[24:06.760 --> 24:10.400]  for being extremely optimistic and saying we're going to reinstate Trump, we're going
[24:10.400 --> 24:15.280]  to expose Biden, we're going to remove this dictator and then he's put everything on the
[24:15.280 --> 24:19.880]  line, he's been sued by all these top companies, it costs tens of millions of dollars conservatively
[24:19.880 --> 24:22.680]  just to fight those in the opening phases.
[24:22.680 --> 24:26.800]  He has been stopped, he has been attacked, he has been harassed behind the scenes, he
[24:26.800 --> 24:31.120]  doesn't make a big deal about it but he stays on the road just for his own safety.
[24:31.120 --> 24:34.880]  The stuff I've been through, the stuff Trump's been through, I only want to imagine what
[24:34.880 --> 24:39.760]  Michael Lindell's been through so we should imagine Trump's going to be reinstated.
[24:39.760 --> 24:44.200]  We should imagine we're going to reverse the fraudulent election because we better or they're
[24:44.200 --> 24:48.160]  going to submit the fraud they engaged in and do it again at the midterms in 16 months
[24:48.160 --> 24:50.520]  and they're never going to let us get to the midterms, they're going to trigger a civil
[24:50.520 --> 24:53.880]  war before then, that's clearly now admitted and they're saying they're political opposition
[24:53.880 --> 24:58.000]  or terrorist, they're saying the Republican Party is the number one terror threat now.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.880]  To the official terror report that they put out a month ago where Biden says official
[25:02.880 --> 25:07.440]  policy, anybody opposes me as a terrorist, the logical extension is now the Republican
[25:07.440 --> 25:11.640]  Party and I've got the clips, I've got the article right here, I'll show it to you when
[25:11.640 --> 25:12.760]  we come back.
[25:12.760 --> 25:15.960]  So we better get on the march, we better get in the face of the system and not keep our
[25:15.960 --> 25:21.000]  heads down because they're going for broke to get rid of all checks and balances and
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.400]  to trigger social crises in the country that are to the cover for a complete total takeover.
[25:25.400 --> 25:30.280]  So my relationship and I wish I had called Wendell five months ago, Roger Stone gave
[25:30.280 --> 25:33.880]  me his number and I thought Michael Wendell is so busy and whatever, I'm not even going
[25:33.880 --> 25:38.640]  to call Michael Wendell and I called him a few months ago, finally got him on the air
[25:38.640 --> 25:42.480]  and he just does a great job and we should all really support him.
[25:42.480 --> 25:48.480]  Separately the guy has a lot of great products and so he said, hey would you like to partner
[25:48.480 --> 25:54.680]  with us, I'll give your fans the biggest discount we give up to 60% off on our sheets, on our
[25:54.680 --> 26:01.000]  new beds, on our pillows of course, on the towels that are awesome, it's all made right
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.720]  here in America, thousands of American employees up in Minnesota and several other states,
[26:05.720 --> 26:10.400]  the American dream and I said yes, please, so he gave us up to 60% off the promo code
[26:10.400 --> 26:17.080]  Alex and boom, they ended up calling us last week saying, hey, do you want your money?
[26:17.080 --> 26:21.360]  I said, oh, we kind of forgot, we did that one blog promo code and it was a substantive
[26:21.360 --> 26:24.480]  amount, it wasn't hundreds of thousands, it wasn't millions but I mean it was a nice
[26:24.480 --> 26:29.760]  chunk of change and it was actually 100% of that money, you know, if you get $50,000
[26:29.760 --> 26:34.520]  because he gave us half the profit from his sales and he doesn't make a huge profit, that
[26:34.520 --> 26:40.240]  big a discount but the volume was so huge, that's actually $50,000, that's not $50,000
[26:40.240 --> 26:46.560]  of supplements sold and then we have $20,000 to work with, that's actually $50,000 and
[26:46.560 --> 26:50.840]  so praise God, I've been praying to have the funds, we've been in the red most of the
[26:50.840 --> 26:54.920]  year, my house is in the process of being sold right now, we had to do some repairs
[26:54.920 --> 27:00.360]  on it, I mean I'm all in, like the widows might and boom, it was like dropped in my
[27:00.360 --> 27:05.840]  lap by Roger Stone, I didn't take action on it, it's not even a pride thing, I just
[27:05.840 --> 27:09.600]  get busy and you know, I'm so used to having to raise our own money and sell our own things
[27:09.600 --> 27:12.600]  that why did I partner with somebody, well they've gone after all our other sponsors
[27:12.600 --> 27:15.560]  and ran them off, well here's the guy on the same boat as me, they've been targeting and
[27:15.560 --> 27:22.520]  persecuting and we're brothers in arms so it's a perfect 360, so mypelo.com, promo

[29:57.280 --> 30:01.600]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet.
[30:01.600 --> 30:04.760]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we have
[30:04.760 --> 30:08.480]  a lot of credibility but I don't care about that, I care about beating the new world order
[30:08.480 --> 30:13.160]  and it's because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much longer
[30:13.160 --> 30:16.480]  and I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons
[30:16.480 --> 30:20.160]  I can't tell you what's going on but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[30:20.160 --> 30:25.160]  the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can so please pray for us and please
[30:25.160 --> 30:29.840]  buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com, they're great products plus they fund the operation
[30:29.840 --> 30:34.000]  so you know unlike other products you can buy they're still great, do they fund freedom?
[30:34.000 --> 30:38.960]  No a lot of them don't, these are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the
[30:38.960 --> 30:43.440]  whole world's waking up and looking for truth, that's why the globalists are censoring, they
[30:43.440 --> 30:47.160]  can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air so while you're
[30:47.160 --> 30:50.880]  at it don't just financially support us and spread the word, download everything we've
[30:50.880 --> 30:54.720]  done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[30:54.720 --> 31:01.720]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[31:24.720 --> 31:31.720]  My friends we are witnessing everything we warned of, in fact I was this morning brushing
[31:31.720 --> 31:38.720]  my teeth at about six a.m. scaring into my bloodshot eye and I just thought about
[32:02.040 --> 32:06.280]  you gotta go on air and slow down and get calm because you got so much news you get
[32:06.280 --> 32:12.080]  hyped up you want to cover it all you see just slow down Alex and just talk to the people
[32:12.080 --> 32:17.880]  about the historical point we're at because we're already at a point in our return going
[32:17.880 --> 32:24.720]  into world government going into the population it's going to be hellish what we face and
[32:24.720 --> 32:31.280]  the good news is at least you know the general public does not know this stuff and I've had
[32:31.280 --> 32:36.400]  to get my family convinced who are smart people and then now they're saying okay what do we
[32:36.400 --> 32:41.000]  do and that's the rest of the equation we have some resources nothing like these globalists
[32:41.000 --> 32:46.160]  and we don't know what to do either we're all in this together and that's why we don't
[32:46.160 --> 32:50.840]  want to believe these bad things are happening as incrementally they get away with more more
[32:50.840 --> 32:57.200]  more this is all basic psychology and when we push back they stop and even pull back
[32:57.200 --> 33:01.240]  a little and as soon as we go back to our business they push forward even harder and then we
[33:01.240 --> 33:07.920]  push back and they push again but over time they're moving forward and it really scared
[33:07.920 --> 33:13.680]  them when Trump got in and Bolsonaro got in so they slipped their double agent in Boris
[33:13.680 --> 33:20.680]  Johnson he was in there already but agent in places they say and they have just accelerated
[33:22.480 --> 33:26.960]  their whole program and it's going to waste society down to collapse point which is their
[33:26.960 --> 33:34.640]  plan when you've got a large percentage of people with degenerative diseases cognitive
[33:34.640 --> 33:40.920]  diseases cardiovascular diseases infertility just a mass scale and they're going to say
[33:40.920 --> 33:46.720]  new variants just like we predicted it's all very easy new variants of COVID is why everybody's
[33:46.720 --> 33:51.640]  dying this year and next year you're like well I took five five COVID vaccines oh we're
[33:51.640 --> 33:58.040]  sorry it's it's funny I take the shots I get real sick well you just need more and I always
[33:58.040 --> 34:04.000]  talked about this psychology it's the psychology of people I know that buy lottery tickets
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.280]  and look if you got plenty of money and you like to buy them because they're fun it messes
[34:07.280 --> 34:11.920]  with your dopamine and you know you like to gamble that's your issue I don't like gambling
[34:11.920 --> 34:16.600]  on things that don't matter or just for money and I like a poker game and you know bet a
[34:16.600 --> 34:21.640]  few hundred bucks maybe just to make it fun just to have some interest in or maybe you
[34:21.640 --> 34:28.920]  bet at the deer camp that year a thousand dollars who can shoot the biggest deer you
[34:28.920 --> 34:36.080]  know the best rack I mean I've done that kind of stuff okay it makes it more interesting
[34:36.080 --> 34:41.800]  but I bet on fighting tyranny my blood my name my honor my will that's where I'm putting
[34:41.800 --> 34:47.440]  my energy is put the skin of the game out the street where I can get killed fight these
[34:47.440 --> 34:58.760]  globalists because of their operatives but that said just pulling back and realizing
[34:58.760 --> 35:04.000]  how evil these people are that they're really made their move and that the type of folks
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.120]  that buy a lottery ticket the more they get scanned by the ticket the more they get deeper
[35:09.120 --> 35:14.720]  into the debt the more that their paycheck isn't going to pay for their children's food
[35:14.720 --> 35:22.760]  and clothing and housing and electricity and medicine the more they bet on the leftist
[35:22.760 --> 35:28.400]  ideology and I've liked it at many times you've heard me tell the story of there was a GCN
[35:28.400 --> 35:36.120]  talk show host I know this was like 20 years ago and he had a popular show he was a young
[35:36.120 --> 35:41.720]  man on the afternoon and I tuned into the show and I heard him saying I'm raising money
[35:41.720 --> 35:47.120]  from these Nigerians and they're going to send me all this money and you ought to get
[35:47.120 --> 35:51.040]  invested with them too and I called up the owner of the company to the other side I said
[35:51.040 --> 35:56.040]  you got to tell him that's a scam either he's involved in it or the talk shows involved
[35:56.040 --> 36:01.280]  or he's an idiot and of course it turned out that he was young and stupid and wanted to
[36:01.280 --> 36:06.520]  believe that he'd given $10,000 or whatever it was I don't remember to the Nigerians
[36:06.520 --> 36:11.120]  and then he was going to get a million back and I've known people personally who were
[36:11.120 --> 36:16.640]  pretty successful in business but they were still that gambler type who would get the
[36:16.640 --> 36:22.520]  email from the Nigerians or other online scams and would give him $1,000 to get $10,000 back
[36:22.520 --> 36:27.240]  and then oh sorry you know we can't give you the $10,000 now we need $2,000 more but now
[36:27.240 --> 36:33.520]  you'll get $30,000 and once you put in $5,000, $10,000 these people would get mad at you
[36:33.520 --> 36:41.720]  if you explained that you're being a rope-adopt and it's basic psychology and that's what
[36:41.720 --> 36:47.640]  these so-called shots are they're not vaccines a real vaccine gives you immunity for 10 years
[36:47.640 --> 36:55.200]  to life that's an attenuated virus or bacteria your body learns how to beat it that's a real
[36:55.200 --> 37:00.960]  technology it's got problems they can spike them they've got histories of chaining them
[37:00.960 --> 37:06.400]  but it's real this has nothing to do with vaccine just like injecting you with cyanide
[37:06.400 --> 37:11.800]  it's not a vaccine it's a deadly poison or plugging an electrical cord into you and
[37:11.800 --> 37:17.160]  turning it on and electrocuting you you know if I walk up and throw a fan or a radio that's
[37:17.160 --> 37:21.080]  on into your bathtub and kill you it's I'm not I'm sending electricity into your body
[37:21.080 --> 37:28.080]  but that's not a vaccine they just call putting things in a needle in you a vaccine and say
[37:28.080 --> 37:35.080]  save and effective over and over again this is called failing forward or too evil to fail
[37:35.080 --> 37:39.200]  or too corrupt to fail oh you're worried about our old tainted vaccines we're going to give
[37:39.200 --> 37:46.680]  you gene therapies that on record in animal studies cause massive blood clots brain damage
[37:46.680 --> 37:51.880]  Alzheimer's infertility the list goes on and on and now all of that is happening just like
[37:51.880 --> 37:57.840]  the most prestigious scientists in the world all said the Nobel Prize winners the Pfizer
[37:57.840 --> 38:03.680]  chief scientist that had EU advisors all of them and it was dead on science and they said
[38:03.680 --> 38:10.040]  we don't get how this is happening this is so well known like if you run over somebody
[38:10.040 --> 38:14.120]  in an 18 wheeler going 100 miles an hour and you hit them dead on they're going to die
[38:14.120 --> 38:18.240]  or you shoot somebody in the head with 357 Magnum six times at point blank range they're
[38:18.240 --> 38:22.400]  going to die or if you pour gasoline on somebody a gallon of gas and light them on fire they're
[38:22.400 --> 38:28.560]  going to die or if I hit you in the face with a hammer it's going to hurt I mean they're
[38:28.560 --> 38:35.440]  doing this there isn't any but the question about it none of it and the thing is they're
[38:35.440 --> 38:41.480]  all wild-eyed and crazy up there you look at the spokesperson for a Biden I mean they
[38:41.480 --> 38:47.880]  just intend to go forward with this so you've got people suckered into the system and the
[38:47.880 --> 38:53.120]  social contract not knowing it's been broken and they don't know what to do so they're
[38:53.120 --> 38:58.420]  scared so all they do is keep complying and we can all say well they're dumb suckers
[38:58.420 --> 39:03.440]  let them get killed let them get hurt it's going to collapse the civilization and the
[39:03.440 --> 39:08.560]  worse it gets the more crazy the mass is going to get when the people killing them and maiming
[39:08.560 --> 39:12.960]  them and bankrupting them are already telling them oh you've got to take a third or fourth
[39:12.960 --> 39:19.640]  shot because Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson wouldn't take their shots and because Sally
[39:19.640 --> 39:24.440]  Johnson wouldn't take hers and Bob Sanchez wouldn't take his and David Chang wouldn't
[39:24.440 --> 39:32.000]  take his and Leroy Brown wouldn't take his and they're already doing it you can see the
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.440]  scripting a year ago we said then they'll blame those of us that don't take it on why
[39:35.440 --> 39:40.360]  new variants are out when their own studies show injecting people with this doesn't create
[39:40.360 --> 39:48.560]  a virus it creates a synthetic toxic replicating pollution of a spike protein that eats holes
[39:48.560 --> 39:55.440]  in your tissue just like alien blood aliens aren't real from the movie alien and aliens
[39:55.440 --> 39:59.400]  but remember their blood it just keeps eating through things well that's what this does
[39:59.400 --> 40:04.600]  a spike protein replication yourselves your body replicates the spike protein to supposedly
[40:04.600 --> 40:10.640]  stop the virus what then it spreads and infects your body and colonizes your body a little
[40:10.640 --> 40:19.000]  protein crystal a prion a form of what gives you spongiform encephalopathy top it up to
[40:19.000 --> 40:24.560]  hit you with all the hydrofluorosalic acid top it up to hit you with all the electrified
[40:24.560 --> 40:35.240]  fluoride and they're just doing it to you so this is it and they're already a hundred
[40:35.240 --> 40:40.840]  million people at least in the US walking around with prions growing at them and the
[40:40.840 --> 40:44.400]  sicker you get the more shots they get oh you're not you're having range while you're
[40:44.400 --> 40:48.400]  really sick you feel like you have the flu you're a long hauler now you're gonna have
[40:48.400 --> 40:52.680]  COVID forever you need 10 shots a year and then they kill you with the drugs are supposed
[40:52.680 --> 40:57.080]  to treat it just like Fauci did with AZT and other drugs in Africa I never had a marketing
[40:57.080 --> 41:01.640]  plan for him for worse I went out and found the best products I could find from the research
[41:01.640 --> 41:05.680]  to fund her operation I wanted you to get products that empowered you that you loved
[41:05.680 --> 41:09.640]  so you'd want to come back and buy more I treat you like I want to be treated it's very very
[41:09.640 --> 41:14.480]  simple it's instinctive it's spiritual it's what I do and that said our iodine products
[41:14.480 --> 41:19.320]  have become our best sellers and X2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers
[41:19.320 --> 41:24.880]  are habituated to only buy it when it's on sale and so I'm gonna catch 22 when I don't
[41:24.880 --> 41:28.800]  have it on sale I don't sell it but we're selling out of all other products because
[41:28.800 --> 41:33.040]  of supply chain breakdowns and so I'm gonna catch 22 I need to sell products at full price
[41:33.040 --> 41:38.200]  but I can't I gotta sell them at discount and so it's discounted 40% off for the dropper
[41:38.200 --> 41:42.860]  bottle 60% off for the spray bottle even though it's about to sell out it won't be available
[41:42.860 --> 41:49.880]  for months so get it X2 is selling out at infowarstore.com for 40 and 60% off with double
[41:49.880 --> 41:54.160]  page reappoints and free shipping because why that's when you buy it we need your funds
[41:54.160 --> 42:00.840]  or be off air it's an amazing product the globalists are having their revolution but
[42:00.840 --> 42:08.280]  for humanity has to have its revolution we have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers
[42:08.280 --> 42:15.680]  trying to enslave the entire biological processes for humans and turn us into these artificial
[42:15.680 --> 42:26.200]  corporate controlled slaves or slaves just property from cradle to grave of the system
[42:26.200 --> 42:32.320]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and safety
[42:32.320 --> 42:37.880]  and control we have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world that realizes
[42:37.880 --> 42:42.080]  the nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of
[42:42.080 --> 42:47.880]  their dystopia it's that choice it's that realization that's going to change the world
[42:47.880 --> 42:53.400]  and it's the only choice we've got freedom or slavery go to reval it is a spiritual battle
[42:53.400 --> 43:01.360]  and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it
[43:01.360 --> 43:13.720]  ok
[43:13.720 --> 43:15.720]  It's like we're livin' at a twilight zone, and...

[45:31.720 --> 45:33.720]  And I understand why. That's how the ratings work.
[45:33.720 --> 45:36.720]  For radio still, it's all name recognition.
[45:36.720 --> 45:38.720]  And we're on hundreds of great radio stations.
[45:38.720 --> 45:40.720]  We're listening to those stations. Please support them.
[45:40.720 --> 45:42.720]  That's one reason they try to deplatform us
[45:42.720 --> 45:44.720]  in the last three years. We stayed on air.
[45:44.720 --> 45:46.720]  Those stations are extremely precious,
[45:46.720 --> 45:49.720]  especially if Biden puts an internet kill switch,
[45:49.720 --> 45:53.720]  which is simply millions of sites that are blocked from access.
[45:53.720 --> 45:55.720]  You'll still be able to get us on local radio stations
[45:55.720 --> 45:58.720]  and you'll still be able to get us off of their streams.
[45:58.720 --> 46:02.720]  Because the kill switch will be illegal.
[46:02.720 --> 46:06.720]  But it's already being incrementally put in
[46:06.720 --> 46:09.720]  and the beta test was yours truly and then Donald Trump,
[46:09.720 --> 46:11.720]  where he's been taken off of everything.
[46:11.720 --> 46:13.720]  That is a selective internet kill switch.
[46:13.720 --> 46:15.720]  It's how it was designed to be used.
[46:15.720 --> 46:18.720]  That's why Socky's up with this great face going.
[46:18.720 --> 46:22.720]  Only authoritative sources will be allowed to see our COVID information.
[46:22.720 --> 46:25.720]  Hunter Biden did not have a laptop.
[46:25.720 --> 46:27.720]  The Chinese are not hacking us.
[46:27.720 --> 46:30.720]  The virus did not come from Wuhan.
[46:30.720 --> 46:35.720]  On and on and on and on.
[46:35.720 --> 46:38.720]  So it's all here. So let's get into the big news.
[46:38.720 --> 46:40.720]  US accuses Chinese intelligence agents
[46:40.720 --> 46:44.720]  of masterminding hacks on Microsoft and others worldwide.
[46:44.720 --> 46:48.720]  We reported this three and a half years ago
[46:48.720 --> 46:54.720]  when Bill Gates was over in China along with Tim Cook of Apple
[46:54.720 --> 47:00.720]  saying we're giving China access to all our networks.
[47:00.720 --> 47:03.720]  And I thought it was crazy when the Pentagon
[47:03.720 --> 47:06.720]  gave Microsoft the contract for cloud computing.
[47:06.720 --> 47:09.720]  I mean, you can't trust Apple. You can't trust Google.
[47:09.720 --> 47:11.720]  You can't trust any of them.
[47:11.720 --> 47:14.720]  Microsoft is shy, calm.
[47:14.720 --> 47:18.720]  I mean, Bill Gates, look it up, started China
[47:18.720 --> 47:22.720]  in the early 1990s with modern computers and merging.
[47:22.720 --> 47:24.720]  I mean, this guy's incredible.
[47:24.720 --> 47:28.720]  Look it up. Bill Gates, quote, modernized China's internet.
[47:28.720 --> 47:32.720]  He is the only guy first allowed in there because he's so damn evil.
[47:32.720 --> 47:33.720]  He is a China file.
[47:33.720 --> 47:35.720]  Oh, they had a great COVID response.
[47:35.720 --> 47:36.720]  We had a bad response.
[47:36.720 --> 47:38.720]  Oh, my lawyer Charlie Munger, he loves them.
[47:38.720 --> 47:42.720]  He's one of the best computers on and on and on.
[47:42.720 --> 47:44.720]  Bill Gates is Rockefeller Foundation manager.
[47:44.720 --> 47:47.720]  Charlie Munger literally is the top advisor to the Chicoms.
[47:47.720 --> 47:49.720]  Okay.
[47:49.720 --> 47:53.720]  So when you read this crap,
[47:53.720 --> 47:56.720]  this is now because there's a bunch of pushback
[47:56.720 --> 47:59.720]  with a few patriots left the Pentagon and other places about
[47:59.720 --> 48:04.720]  how the hell is the Pentagon's coordinated computers worldwide,
[48:04.720 --> 48:07.720]  the most top secret stuff run by Microsoft
[48:07.720 --> 48:08.720]  and the Chinese.
[48:08.720 --> 48:09.720]  And if you don't believe me,
[48:09.720 --> 48:12.720]  Trump didn't even know this three and a half years ago
[48:12.720 --> 48:13.720]  about these companies.
[48:13.720 --> 48:15.720]  And that's when I was finally told,
[48:15.720 --> 48:17.720]  if you do it again, you're dead.
[48:17.720 --> 48:19.720]  Well, I didn't stop and I'm not asking to be killed.
[48:19.720 --> 48:20.720]  I don't want to be killed.
[48:20.720 --> 48:21.720]  But remember the headlines were,
[48:21.720 --> 48:27.720]  General Kelly's job is to keep Alex Jones away from Trump.
[48:27.720 --> 48:30.720]  Well, I got to a Fox News host that talks to Trump,
[48:30.720 --> 48:32.720]  not Tucker Carlson, another one.
[48:32.720 --> 48:36.720]  And I said, hey, you know this Reuters article
[48:36.720 --> 48:40.720]  about how Apple has given its code keys to communist China.
[48:40.720 --> 48:41.720]  It was in Reuters.
[48:41.720 --> 48:43.720]  No one even, he didn't know.
[48:43.720 --> 48:50.720]  Apple gave all their code keys four years ago to the Chinese.
[48:50.720 --> 48:53.720]  So when you read this, ladies and gentlemen,
[48:53.720 --> 48:56.720]  and you hear about, oh, they hacked into things.
[48:56.720 --> 48:57.720]  They don't need to hack in.
[48:57.720 --> 49:01.720]  Trump finally woke up in his last year about Huawei
[49:01.720 --> 49:03.720]  and the Chicoms and all of it.
[49:03.720 --> 49:06.720]  Because they can then, with those devices,
[49:06.720 --> 49:08.720]  take over any device that's in their area.
[49:08.720 --> 49:09.720]  You understand?
[49:09.720 --> 49:10.720]  With the 5G.
[49:10.720 --> 49:12.720]  Because the 5G's meant to control all of us.
[49:12.720 --> 49:14.720]  It's just that this other globalist faction
[49:14.720 --> 49:15.720]  wants to control the 5G.
[49:15.720 --> 49:17.720]  They don't want the Chicoms having it.
[49:17.720 --> 49:19.720]  There's only a turf battle over controlling us.
[49:19.720 --> 49:22.720]  And all the driverless cars and drones and systems
[49:22.720 --> 49:23.720]  that 5G controls.
[49:23.720 --> 49:24.720]  All right, next.
[49:24.720 --> 49:28.720]  Leak exposes global abuse of cyber spying weapon
[49:28.720 --> 49:30.720]  to get politicians, activists and journalists.
[49:30.720 --> 49:34.720]  So Zero Hedge started breaking this a few days ago.
[49:34.720 --> 49:38.720]  And then it came out in Reuters today about the Israelis.
[49:38.720 --> 49:40.720]  Okay.
[49:40.720 --> 49:43.720]  If an Israeli firm hacked into journalist phones,
[49:43.720 --> 49:45.720]  I think they should be arrested and put in prison.
[49:45.720 --> 49:48.720]  And it's terrible and it's horrible.
[49:48.720 --> 49:51.720]  And it's just a horrible thing of the Israeli government's involved.
[49:51.720 --> 49:57.720]  When you read this article, it talks about dozens of journalists
[49:57.720 --> 50:01.720]  having an app that they didn't know was hacking them.
[50:01.720 --> 50:06.720]  So I say we give these Israelis life in prison.
[50:06.720 --> 50:10.720]  Now, what do we do to Jen Psaki saying that they are spying
[50:10.720 --> 50:12.720]  on everybody's text messages in live time
[50:12.720 --> 50:14.720]  and that they want an internet kill switch to control
[50:14.720 --> 50:15.720]  what email you can send.
[50:15.720 --> 50:17.720]  And then give them the Southern Poverty Law Center
[50:17.720 --> 50:21.720]  and the ADL access to this with 200,000 trainees
[50:21.720 --> 50:22.720]  that are in big tech.
[50:22.720 --> 50:25.720]  Project Veritas got the video of this two years ago
[50:25.720 --> 50:27.720]  that the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL
[50:27.720 --> 50:30.720]  have trained 200,000 people in big tech
[50:30.720 --> 50:33.720]  in their training course about what's white supremacist,
[50:33.720 --> 50:35.720]  what's evil, what's bad, what they've got to block.
[50:35.720 --> 50:37.720]  And now they're saying questioning elections you can't do.
[50:37.720 --> 50:42.720]  Now they're saying questioning medical information you can't do.
[50:42.720 --> 50:45.720]  Totally silencing you.
[50:45.720 --> 50:48.720]  Now, the truth is caller ID is run through an Israeli company
[50:48.720 --> 50:51.720]  and Israel's got control of most of the phone lines
[50:51.720 --> 50:53.720]  and their data tracking.
[50:53.720 --> 50:55.720]  And that was done a long time ago and that's terrible
[50:55.720 --> 50:57.720]  and that's wrong.
[50:57.720 --> 50:59.720]  But you know, if you don't hear about that,
[50:59.720 --> 51:03.720]  instead you hear out of Reuters Israeli firm spyware used
[51:03.720 --> 51:05.720]  to target journalist cell phones report.
[51:05.720 --> 51:08.720]  Oh, big story breaking today.
[51:08.720 --> 51:11.720]  You know, an Israeli company spyware was used
[51:11.720 --> 51:15.720]  in an attempt in successful hacks of 37 smartphone
[51:15.720 --> 51:17.720]  belong to journalists, government officials
[51:17.720 --> 51:19.720]  and human rights activists around the world
[51:19.720 --> 51:22.720]  according to an investigation by 17 media organizations
[51:22.720 --> 51:26.720]  published on Sunday.
[51:26.720 --> 51:30.720]  Big tech and big media and fat checkers at CNN and MSNBC
[51:30.720 --> 51:35.720]  have dual hat access to your cell phones in live time
[51:35.720 --> 51:37.720]  and your private messages.
[51:37.720 --> 51:41.720]  That's all come out.
[51:41.720 --> 51:45.720]  They're reading your emails in live time.
[51:45.720 --> 51:48.720]  They're spying on you, big tech spying on you
[51:48.720 --> 51:52.720]  and then interfacing with the Obama administration,
[51:52.720 --> 51:55.720]  part two, the Biden administration to do all this.
[51:55.720 --> 51:59.720]  So, 17 media organizations got together
[51:59.720 --> 52:03.720]  to expose Israel or an Israeli group spying on journalists.
[52:03.720 --> 52:08.720]  Good. You caught somebody stealing a hamburger
[52:08.720 --> 52:10.720]  from a hamburger shop.
[52:10.720 --> 52:12.720]  Put them in prison for life.
[52:12.720 --> 52:14.720]  Hell, if a jury says it, execute them.
[52:14.720 --> 52:18.720]  Why are we focused on this when the communist Chinese
[52:18.720 --> 52:20.720]  are running everything, spying on everything,
[52:20.720 --> 52:23.720]  have the code teased and now it's coming out.
[52:23.720 --> 52:25.720]  Oh, all the Microsoft users, Chinese are spying on you
[52:25.720 --> 52:28.720]  and billions of files because Bill Gates set it up that way
[52:28.720 --> 52:31.720]  and Charlie Munger says, don't worry about it, Sonny,
[52:31.720 --> 52:33.720]  China's going to run America.
[52:33.720 --> 52:37.720]  See, this is trillions of times worse than what the Israelis did
[52:37.720 --> 52:39.720]  and I guarantee all the white supremacists are going to freak out
[52:39.720 --> 52:42.720]  and say, there's Joe's covering up for Israel.
[52:42.720 --> 52:44.720]  That's not what I'm doing.
[52:44.720 --> 52:47.720]  I'm saying, why is this the top story in the country
[52:47.720 --> 52:49.720]  about Israel spying on journalists?
[52:49.720 --> 52:51.720]  It's wrong. It's not good.
[52:51.720 --> 52:53.720]  Of course, that being sarcastic, don't execute them.
[52:53.720 --> 52:58.720]  I'm just saying, what is the level of punishment
[52:58.720 --> 53:02.720]  for Bill Gates versus what's happening with the Israelis?
[53:02.720 --> 53:04.720]  It's all a distraction.
[53:04.720 --> 53:07.720]  Just like saying, oh, China hacked Microsoft.
[53:07.720 --> 53:09.720]  China didn't hack Microsoft.
[53:09.720 --> 53:12.720]  Bill Gates basically moved his operations to China
[53:12.720 --> 53:15.720]  to be dominant and to have sweetheart deals
[53:15.720 --> 53:20.720]  and to consolidate power because he's a sociopathic, greedy monster.
[53:20.720 --> 53:23.720]  This is a distraction, the whole Israel thing,
[53:23.720 --> 53:25.720]  from, look at this Ben Garrison cartoon,
[53:25.720 --> 53:28.720]  the fourth branch of government, the CIA, the NSA, the FBI,
[53:28.720 --> 53:32.720]  now the entire corporate media in your life spying on you
[53:32.720 --> 53:34.720]  and saying they're going to control what you can say
[53:34.720 --> 53:38.720]  and what you can do on your text messages in live time.
[53:38.720 --> 53:40.720]  And the Rockefeller Foundation is going to tell them
[53:40.720 --> 53:45.720]  what can be said and what can't be said.
[53:45.720 --> 53:47.720]  Who was telling you the Rockefeller Foundation
[53:47.720 --> 53:49.720]  was quarterbacking all this behind the scenes?
[53:49.720 --> 53:50.720]  I'm the only one.
[53:50.720 --> 53:52.720]  And by the way, it's not about being Mr. Smartypants.
[53:52.720 --> 53:54.720]  I'm like, I'm right again.
[53:54.720 --> 53:56.720]  I'm not making any of this up.
[53:56.720 --> 53:59.720]  And as soon as everybody realizes that I'm not making this stuff up,
[53:59.720 --> 54:01.720]  they may change their mistakes, but not on purpose.
[54:01.720 --> 54:07.720]  As soon as you figure that out, it's game over, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:07.720 --> 54:12.720]  It's absolute game over.
[54:12.720 --> 54:15.720]  So that's just part of this because you've got this other huge article
[54:15.720 --> 54:19.720]  with the O. Biden administration coming out.
[54:19.720 --> 54:21.720]  This is such a key zero hedge article.
[54:21.720 --> 54:23.720]  It's on infowars.com as well.
[54:23.720 --> 54:26.720]  Now that they're saying Republican Party is the number one
[54:26.720 --> 54:28.720]  national security threat to the United States of America,
[54:28.720 --> 54:30.720]  and they talk about how dangerous it is and how out of control.
[54:30.720 --> 54:33.720]  I'm going to open the phones up next hour specifically
[54:33.720 --> 54:35.720]  for a certain group of people.
[54:35.720 --> 54:36.720]  I will tell you who that group of people is
[54:36.720 --> 54:38.720]  when we come back, please stay with us.
[54:38.720 --> 54:41.720]  Separately, we're running out of the Deepworth crystal,
[54:41.720 --> 54:45.720]  super high quality iodine that is so essential for your libido,
[54:45.720 --> 54:48.720]  your energy, your stamina, your immune system.
[54:48.720 --> 54:49.720]  It is essential.
[54:49.720 --> 54:50.720]  Not iodine, you die.
[54:50.720 --> 54:52.720]  Most iodine is bound into other things.
[54:52.720 --> 54:53.720]  You don't absorb it right.
[54:53.720 --> 54:55.720]  Most people have iodine deficiencies.
[54:55.720 --> 54:58.720]  Even the UN estimates over 2 billion people have cognitive disabilities
[54:58.720 --> 54:59.720]  because of lack of iodine.
[54:59.720 --> 55:02.720]  They hit us with a bad halogen to block the good iodine.
[55:02.720 --> 55:05.720]  Fluoride blocks iodine, so it takes more iodine to override it
[55:05.720 --> 55:08.720]  with all the iodine that's been depleted.
[55:08.720 --> 55:09.720]  You need to supplement.
[55:09.720 --> 55:10.720]  We have the best out there.
[55:10.720 --> 55:13.720]  It's 60% off in the spray bottle.
[55:13.720 --> 55:15.720]  The same amount that's in the dropper bottle.
[55:15.720 --> 55:17.720]  I'm just discounting the spray bottles.
[55:17.720 --> 55:18.720]  We've got more of that.
[55:18.720 --> 55:20.720]  And we've got 40% off on the dropper bottle,
[55:20.720 --> 55:22.720]  but they're going to sell out the next week or so,
[55:22.720 --> 55:23.720]  at least the spray bottle will.
[55:23.720 --> 55:25.720]  And you've got to try it.
[55:25.720 --> 55:28.720]  It's a win-win, funds the operation, and it's amazing.
[55:28.720 --> 55:32.720]  Get X2, the Deepworth halogen, purest iodine, atomic iodine.
[55:32.720 --> 55:37.720]  You can find anywhere at InfowarsStore.com for 60% off,
[55:37.720 --> 55:38.720]  but it's selling out.
[55:38.720 --> 55:41.720]  Take advantage of that now and fund the Second American Revolution.
[55:41.720 --> 55:45.720]  I guess the globalist will be right back in hour number two.
[55:45.720 --> 55:47.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here,
[55:47.720 --> 55:48.720]  the host of the Infowars War Room.
[55:48.720 --> 55:52.720]  And I am very excited about our latest supplement edition
[55:52.720 --> 55:54.720]  to InfowarsStore.com.
[55:54.720 --> 55:56.720]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers,
[55:56.720 --> 55:58.720]  and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[55:58.720 --> 56:01.720]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own
[56:01.720 --> 56:04.720]  greens fiber caps to InfowarsStore.com.
[56:04.720 --> 56:07.720]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[56:07.720 --> 56:08.720]  Listen to this.
[56:08.720 --> 56:11.720]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf,
[56:11.720 --> 56:14.720]  organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf,
[56:14.720 --> 56:18.720]  organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[56:18.720 --> 56:21.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible
[56:21.720 --> 56:22.720]  for your health.
[56:22.720 --> 56:25.720]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement
[56:25.720 --> 56:26.720]  for your health.
[56:26.720 --> 56:29.720]  And we packed it all in to fibergreencaps
[56:29.720 --> 56:31.720]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[56:31.720 --> 56:34.720]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[56:34.720 --> 56:37.720]  I suggest that you do the same thing.
[56:37.720 --> 56:41.720]  And right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[56:41.720 --> 56:46.720]  That's 33% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[56:46.720 --> 56:49.720]  The world is awakening.
[56:49.720 --> 56:52.720]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[56:52.720 --> 56:55.720]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites,
[56:55.720 --> 56:58.720]  the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral commission,
[56:58.720 --> 57:03.720]  the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[57:03.720 --> 57:07.720]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning,
[57:07.720 --> 57:10.720]  the truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack
[57:10.720 --> 57:13.720]  human freedom because they're actually losing.
[57:13.720 --> 57:16.720]  We have forced them out in the open.
[57:16.720 --> 57:18.720]  So as bad as these times are,
[57:18.720 --> 57:20.720]  and a lot of negative things are about to happen,
[57:20.720 --> 57:22.720]  realize humanity is winning.
[57:22.720 --> 57:24.720]  You've got to trust in the plan of God.
[57:24.720 --> 57:27.720]  And trust in the plan of God's justice.
[57:27.720 --> 57:29.720]  That is invincible.
[57:29.720 --> 57:32.720]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[57:32.720 --> 57:33.720]  So don't trust in man.
[57:33.720 --> 57:36.720]  Trust in God to lead God and direct your soul
[57:36.720 --> 57:38.720]  and then take action against the globalists
[57:38.720 --> 57:40.720]  and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones
[57:40.720 --> 57:42.720]  and my crew to you.
[57:42.720 --> 57:44.720]  We will never back down from the globalists
[57:44.720 --> 58:13.720]  and we will never surrender.
[58:13.720 --> 58:17.720]  All right, we're going to fire up the phone system
[58:17.720 --> 58:20.720]  in the second hour ahead of Mike Lindell
[58:20.720 --> 58:22.720]  with a lot of election fraud news and information.
[58:22.720 --> 58:25.720]  As it all comes out, it confirms he was right.
[58:25.720 --> 58:28.720]  He'll be joining us in the third hour.
[58:28.720 --> 58:29.720]  Again, this is Alex Jones' show.
[58:29.720 --> 58:31.720]  Thank you for joining us.
[58:31.720 --> 58:33.720]  I want to open the phones up for a specific group,
[58:33.720 --> 58:39.720]  and I'm asking our amazing listeners to please not call in
[58:39.720 --> 58:42.720]  unless you are someone that took the vaccine
[58:42.720 --> 58:43.720]  because you were pressured by work
[58:43.720 --> 58:45.720]  or maybe you're a new listener.
[58:45.720 --> 58:46.720]  Maybe you got damaged by the shots
[58:46.720 --> 58:48.720]  so you sought out info wars.
[58:48.720 --> 58:50.720]  Or maybe you took the vaccine
[58:50.720 --> 58:51.720]  and like some love to say,
[58:51.720 --> 58:53.720]  it makes them feel like they're in ecstasy.
[58:53.720 --> 58:56.720]  They think it just really feels good.
[58:56.720 --> 58:58.720]  I guess to collapse and have convulsions
[58:58.720 --> 59:01.720]  or start having those deadly crystal prions
[59:01.720 --> 59:02.720]  grow in their body.
[59:02.720 --> 59:05.720]  So I would like to seriously hear from you.
[59:05.720 --> 59:06.720]  Maybe you disagree.
[59:06.720 --> 59:08.720]  Maybe you think I'm wrong about the vaccine.
[59:08.720 --> 59:10.720]  So either people out there that think
[59:10.720 --> 59:12.720]  I'm wrong about the so-called vaccines
[59:12.720 --> 59:13.720]  and aren't vaccines.
[59:13.720 --> 59:15.720]  I'd love to hear from you.
[59:15.720 --> 59:18.720]  And I'd love to hear from folks who have taken the vaccine
[59:18.720 --> 59:21.720]  to see what happened to you.
[59:21.720 --> 59:24.720]  And I'll also leave the door open if you have family,
[59:24.720 --> 59:26.720]  like your husband or wife or son or daughter
[59:26.720 --> 59:28.720]  or brother or sister, immediate family.
[59:28.720 --> 59:30.720]  If you'd like to tell us what happened
[59:30.720 --> 59:32.720]  with the vaccine with them.
[59:32.720 --> 59:35.720]  Because we've opened the phones up probably on 20 shows or so
[59:35.720 --> 59:37.720]  in the last six months since the injections started
[59:37.720 --> 59:39.720]  of this experimental garbage.
[59:39.720 --> 59:41.720]  And we can just take four hours of calls.
[59:41.720 --> 59:42.720]  One person after the other.
[59:42.720 --> 59:43.720]  My mother died.
[59:43.720 --> 59:44.720]  My brother died.
[59:44.720 --> 59:45.720]  My father died.
[59:45.720 --> 59:46.720]  My son died.
[59:46.720 --> 59:47.720]  My sister died.
[59:47.720 --> 59:48.720]  My father's fighting for his life.
[59:48.720 --> 59:50.720]  My brother's fighting for his life.
[59:50.720 --> 59:53.720]  Massive heart attacks, stroke, bleed out in the brain.
[59:53.720 --> 59:56.720]  I mean, it is just, and people take them a shot.
[59:56.720 --> 59:58.720]  They tell you, sit there for 30 minutes
[59:58.720 --> 1:00:01.720]  because so many people collapse after they've taken it.
[1:00:01.720 --> 1:00:03.720]  I mean, it's bad.
[1:00:03.720 --> 1:00:05.720]  And you've just got the full court press
[1:00:05.720 --> 1:00:07.720]  of the corporate media and the AI,
[1:00:07.720 --> 1:00:10.720]  straight jacket of big tech,
[1:00:10.720 --> 1:00:13.720]  which is really just a modern electronic stazi,
[1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:15.720]  the electronic martial law.
[1:00:15.720 --> 1:00:16.720]  That didn't rhetoric.
[1:00:16.720 --> 1:00:18.720]  That's what this is.
[1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:21.720]  Just hammering people and silencing them
[1:00:21.720 --> 1:00:23.720]  in such a devilish way.
[1:00:23.720 --> 1:00:25.720]  So I'm going to give the phone number out
[1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:28.720]  for people who've had the vaccine.
[1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:29.720]  And don't be ashamed.
[1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:31.720]  And even I just called it a vaccine.
[1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:34.720]  For people that have had the deadly injection,
[1:00:34.720 --> 1:00:37.720]  sorry, the people that have had the mRNA gene therapy,
[1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:41.720]  non-approved experimental injection.
[1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:42.720]  Because that's what it is.
[1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:44.720]  It's not a quote, vaccine that again,
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:46.720]  attenuates the virus or something else.
[1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:49.720]  I want to hear from you.
[1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:50.720]  You know who you are.
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:51.720]  We love you.
[1:00:51.720 --> 1:00:52.720]  We appreciate you.
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:53.720]  We want to really just unfiltered.
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:54.720]  Have you called in?
[1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:58.720]  877-789-2539-877-789.
[1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:03.720]  Alex, right there on screen, 877-789-259.
[1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:08.720]  We will get you up and on the air.
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:12.720]  877-789-2539.
[1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:15.720]  And again, only those callers please.
[1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:17.720]  Or we can't get to anybody because hundreds of people call in
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:19.720]  and we give the number out, which I appreciate normally.
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:22.720]  It's just that then we cannot get the folks
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:23.720]  that are actually calling in.
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:25.720]  So we have one person answering the phone.
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:27.720]  So you'll hear yourself put on hold.
[1:01:27.720 --> 1:01:30.720]  It'll probably take them four or five minutes to get to you.
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:34.720]  So 877-789-2539.
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:40.720]  And the phone system is open right now for you to get in.
[1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:42.720]  And I'm also asked this politely,
[1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:44.720]  we'll dispense with the pleasantries.
[1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:45.720]  You don't need to thank me.
[1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:47.720]  I'm not going to thank you.
[1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:49.720]  I just want to get to you and hear your testimony
[1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:51.720]  to the next person to respect your time
[1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:52.720]  and to get to everyone.
[1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:56.720]  So we're going to do this in the next hour.
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:01:58.720]  And I'm also going to speed read through a bunch
[1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:01.720]  of important headlines and other breaking news.
[1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:05.720]  And then Mike Lindell joins us to get into a bunch
[1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:09.720]  of election fraud news that I've got here in my stack.
[1:02:09.720 --> 1:02:11.720]  Breaking big.
[1:02:11.720 --> 1:02:14.720]  Breaking big Georgia residents to file a lawsuit on Monday
[1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:17.720]  at 1.30 p.m. contesting the fraudulent results
[1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:19.720]  of the Georgia Senate elections.
[1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:23.720]  It was all done illegally and people are fighting back
[1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:25.720]  and the courts would never hear the information.
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:27.720]  The middle of the election, they all rolled over
[1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:30.720]  because they were scared of the establishment.
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:32.720]  Because if you backed the will of the people,
[1:02:32.720 --> 1:02:35.720]  you got targeted, believe me.
[1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:38.720]  I got to experience it big time.
[1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:41.720]  So 877-789-2539.
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:42.720]  And don't forget the websites.
[1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:43.720]  Please share them.
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:44.720]  When you do that, it changes everything.
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:47.720]  I want to come out of all of you that have been doing that.
[1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:48.720]  Freeworldnews.tv.
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:49.720]  Freeworldnews.tv.
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:54.720]  Find all the videos and share that link.
[1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:57.720]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements
[1:02:57.720 --> 1:02:58.720]  in the next 60 seconds.
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:00.720]  First off, green fiber capsules.
[1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:02.720]  Highest quality fiber you're going to find
[1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:05.720]  with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:07.720]  This is an incredible formula.
[1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:08.720]  Everybody should be taking it.
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:10.720]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white.
[1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:11.720]  It doesn't matter.
[1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:12.720]  It's an amazing product.
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:13.720]  It's our newest product.
[1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:15.720]  It's 50% off out of the gates.
[1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:16.720]  M4store.com.
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:18.720]  Then we have both types of X2s,
[1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:20.720]  the exact same X2 with a model,
[1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:22.720]  but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:25.720]  for 60 and 40% off, depending on which one.
[1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:27.720]  They're both excellent at M4store.com.
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:30.720]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented,
[1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:33.720]  but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen
[1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:35.720]  and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:37.720]  It's all available at M4store.com.
[1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:41.720]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off, and X2
[1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:44.720]  in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:45.720]  for 60 and 40% off.
[1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:47.720]  And it funds the M4Ware.
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:50.720]  Experience deeper crystal iodine for itself
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:51.720]  and keep your gut healthy.
[1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:52.720]  M4store.com.
[1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:23.720]  In this second hour ahead of Mike Lindell,
[1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:26.720]  the big election fraud confirmation news
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:28.720]  pouring out across the country,
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:29.720]  truly vindicated,
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:32.720]  he'll be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:35.720]  But I want to open the phones up right now
[1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:37.720]  for one group of people.
[1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:42.720]  People that have taken the experimental
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:44.720]  mRNA gene therapy injection
[1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:46.720]  that the media has been lying about,
[1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:48.720]  calling a vaccine or inoculation.
[1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:49.720]  It's not the same science.
[1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:51.720]  It's completely different.
[1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:54.720]  It's genetic engineering, live time,
[1:04:54.720 --> 1:04:55.720]  and that's their own admissions.
[1:04:55.720 --> 1:04:57.720]  I want to hear from you.
[1:04:57.720 --> 1:04:58.720]  Were you forced to take it?
[1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:00.720]  Did you like it?
[1:05:00.720 --> 1:05:01.720]  Did you have any side effects?
[1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:02.720]  This is unfiltered.
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:03.720]  This is real.
[1:05:03.720 --> 1:05:10.720]  877-789-ALIX, 877-789-2539.
[1:05:10.720 --> 1:05:12.720]  And Dr. Mike, Jay, Manny, Emma,
[1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:15.720]  I'm going to get to all of you here in just a moment.
[1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:18.720]  But let me get to this news
[1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:23.720]  since I was just starting to get into this.
[1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:27.720]  Let's talk about fighting back against what's happening.
[1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:31.720]  Whether you live in Australia or whether you live in Nigeria
[1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:33.720]  or whether you live in Mexico,
[1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:36.720]  whether you live in the UK or Germany or Russia,
[1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:38.720]  or whether you live on Easter Island,
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:39.720]  it doesn't matter.
[1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:41.720]  You're a human being.
[1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:44.720]  And you should fight back.
[1:05:44.720 --> 1:05:47.720]  You should speak out against the absurdity of what's going on
[1:05:47.720 --> 1:05:49.720]  if you've had a vaccine,
[1:05:49.720 --> 1:05:51.720]  then you're supposedly protected.
[1:05:51.720 --> 1:05:52.720]  Why should I have to take it?
[1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:54.720]  It's a lie.
[1:05:54.720 --> 1:05:57.720]  And so I'm going to redo what this fellow did.
[1:05:57.720 --> 1:05:58.720]  He did a great job.
[1:05:58.720 --> 1:06:00.720]  Joe Rogan sent me this last night.
[1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:02.720]  This is Gabriel Rossi,
[1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:04.720]  a well-known comedian in Australia.
[1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:09.720]  He did a great little 47-second piece, low-tech.
[1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:12.720]  Anybody can shoot this with a camera by yourself
[1:06:12.720 --> 1:06:16.720]  where you're on one side and you shoot the monologue
[1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:18.720]  or the statements.
[1:06:18.720 --> 1:06:20.720]  You turn the other side and shoot that side
[1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:22.720]  as the same person talking back at the person
[1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:26.720]  and then you upload this to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, wherever.
[1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:29.720]  This is how we're going to fight these people is with peaceful truth
[1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:31.720]  because none of this makes sense.
[1:06:31.720 --> 1:06:32.720]  None of this is true.
[1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:33.720]  All of this is a fraud.
[1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:36.720]  And they don't want you to have a voice.
[1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:37.720]  That's what they're trying to sign.
[1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:40.720]  It's me and all these medical doctors and scientists and others.
[1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:43.720]  So here's the short piece that I think everyone.
[1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:47.720]  In fact, I don't have the crew to judge a contest.
[1:06:47.720 --> 1:06:48.720]  And then every time we have a contest,
[1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:51.720]  we get so many thousands of entries, it takes up all our time,
[1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:54.720]  which is a great thing to have all the thousands of entries
[1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:55.720]  and has an amazing effect.
[1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:57.720]  But then it becomes a huge fiasco.
[1:06:57.720 --> 1:06:58.720]  But you know what?
[1:06:58.720 --> 1:06:59.720]  I'm doing it.
[1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:02.720]  But instead, I'm going to start doing quick contest
[1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:03.720]  that are only one week long.
[1:07:03.720 --> 1:07:07.720]  You have until next Monday at 11 a.m. Central.
[1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:10.720]  And then we'll announce the winner the next day.
[1:07:10.720 --> 1:07:16.720]  $10,000 for whoever remakes this video that I judge is the best.
[1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:18.720]  And you can riff on it like jazz.
[1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:19.720]  You can change it.
[1:07:19.720 --> 1:07:21.720]  You can make it different.
[1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:24.720]  $10,000, one prize first place.
[1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:29.720]  And we will announce it on Tuesday at 1.30 p.m.
[1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:30.720]  And that's it.
[1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:35.720]  And you will send those to contest at infowars.com,
[1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:39.720]  which is an active email, contest at infowars.com.
[1:07:39.720 --> 1:07:41.720]  We'll be sure and check the spam filter.
[1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:43.720]  Half of the stuff goes in there.
[1:07:43.720 --> 1:07:44.720]  But here it is.
[1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:47.720]  $10,000 prize will be announced next Tuesday at 1.30 p.m.
[1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:48.720]  Central.
[1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:50.720]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:54.720]  Comparisons is what it's called for conversations in 2021.
[1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:55.720]  Gabriel Rossi.
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:56.720]  Here it is.
[1:07:56.720 --> 1:07:58.720]  Are you going to get vaccinated?
[1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:00.720]  I think I want to wait a bit longer.
[1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:01.720]  What do you need to wait?
[1:08:01.720 --> 1:08:03.720]  I'm just not in a rush to get it, mate.
[1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:04.720]  Have you had it?
[1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:05.720]  Yeah, I've had it.
[1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:07.720]  Why are you doing so selfish?
[1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:09.720]  How am I being selfish?
[1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:11.720]  Because if you get COVID, you can pass it on to me.
[1:08:11.720 --> 1:08:13.720]  But you've been vaccinated.
[1:08:13.720 --> 1:08:15.720]  Yeah, but I can still get it.
[1:08:15.720 --> 1:08:18.720]  So if I get vaccinated, I can still get it too.
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:21.720]  Yeah, but you should still get it because then you won't pass it on to me.
[1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:25.720]  But if I get vaccinated, I can still get it and still pass it on to you.
[1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:27.720]  Well, yeah, but you should still get it.
[1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:30.720]  But you can catch it off me whether I've been vaccinated or not.
[1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:32.720]  Yeah, but you should still get vaccinated.
[1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:33.720]  But why?
[1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:35.720]  Because it's the right thing to do.
[1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:36.720]  Who says?
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:38.720]  The people that make it.
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:46.720]  And again, we'll post an article about this later today with the video I've done here live,
[1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:47.720]  clipped in there.
[1:08:47.720 --> 1:08:50.720]  And the show rules are don't do anything illegal.
[1:08:50.720 --> 1:08:52.720]  Do something similar to this.
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:57.720]  And you will win $10,000 if you're the one first place prize winner.
[1:08:57.720 --> 1:09:00.720]  You need to upload it to more platforms is better,
[1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:05.720]  but it needs to be at least uploaded to YouTube, Twitter or Facebook or Instagram.
[1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:08.720]  And again, if you want to win, I put it up on as many as you can.
[1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:11.720]  But we'll also judge the content on how many places it's up.
[1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:13.720]  I'll also look at the view counts.
[1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:19.720]  But at the end of the day, it'll be just whatever I think the winner is $10,000 for this contest.
[1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:25.720]  And I guess we'll call it the Gabriel Rossi Contest.
[1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:27.720]  Well, how about?
[1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:29.720]  Now, that's not a good name.
[1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:30.720]  He's a good guy that did it first.
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:31.720]  We're giving him credit.
[1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:33.720]  In fact, he can enter the contest if he wants it.
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:34.720]  I'll just judge it off.
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:36.720]  He can win.
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:45.720]  Let's call it something like, you know,
[1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:49.720]  COVID-19 murdering logic or murdering logic contest,
[1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:52.720]  COVID-19 murdering logic contest, something like that.
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:54.720]  So it's the murdering logic contest.
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:59.720]  It's make sure freeworldnews.tv is in there somewhere, freeworldnews.tv.
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:02.720]  $10,000 will help educate millions of people
[1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:05.720]  and get folks into infowars.com.
[1:10:05.720 --> 1:10:07.720]  Okay, let's go to this next report,
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:10.720]  and I'm going to go to break and come back to your phone calls.
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:13.720]  I've looked into this guy some, but I want to get him on the show.
[1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:15.720]  He's Dr. Brian Artis.
[1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:17.720]  He goes on a lot of people's shows, I respect.
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:19.720]  He's a pretty prominent guy.
[1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:23.720]  He says he's discovered that there are 11 different government reporting systems,
[1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:27.720]  not just VAERS, for COVID-19,
[1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:31.720]  and that the death numbers are much, much higher.
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:34.720]  I don't know if that's true, but I know everybody I know
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:38.720]  has friends and family that have died after taking these vaccines,
[1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:42.720]  and they are covering it up, and it's not a vaccine.
[1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:45.720]  And the people that studied it said it will kill people with blood clots
[1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:47.720]  and heart attacks, and now it is.
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:50.720]  So here's the very scary clip.
[1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:52.720]  We're back here with Dr. Brian Artis.
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:53.720]  We did an interview with him,
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:55.720]  and he wasn't able to release the numbers at 3 o'clock.
[1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:57.720]  So 3 o'clock today, right here in Anaheim.
[1:10:57.720 --> 1:10:58.720]  What happened, Brian?
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:01.720]  It was confirmed today by Thomas Renz that just filed federal papers
[1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:03.720]  and a lawsuit against the government.
[1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:08.720]  45,000 confirmed dead from the COVID-19 shots within three days so far,
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:11.720]  and they've covered it up.
[1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:13.720]  45,000.
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:15.720]  The VAERS data is only reported 11,000,
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:19.720]  but there's 11 different report systems into the government.
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:22.720]  One of them alone has 45,000 that they have not released or told you.
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:25.720]  And Thomas Renz has got the paperwork, has the whistleblower,
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:28.720]  has the smorn affidavit, and they've already filed the lawsuit today.
[1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:29.720]  It's not a game.
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:30.720]  It's disgusting.
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:32.720]  And now they want to push it on every child,
[1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:36.720]  and they've passed them all that by September of this year by the fall.
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:38.720]  They will be able to vaccinate every five-year-old in America
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:39.720]  before they go to school.
[1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:41.720]  45,000 confirmed dead from one reporting system.
[1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:44.720]  Breaking news right here on the MG Show for Manhattan, California.
[1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:45.720]  Thank you, Dr. Artis.
[1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:46.720]  Thanks for tuning in, Matrix Crew.
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:47.720]  Boom.
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:49.720]  And it's all about managing the cover-up
[1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:51.720]  to see how many they can kill and get away with it.
[1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:53.720]  They already got tens of millions of autistic kids.
[1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:55.720]  They've already got all of this going on.
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:58.720]  And the very guy that launched the HIV attack,
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:02.720]  all the evidence is overwhelming, Fauci is now in control of this again.
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:05.720]  So for a virus that spike proteins what makes you sick,
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:07.720]  they give you something that makes more spike protein,
[1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:09.720]  and you get sicker and sicker and sicker.
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:10.720]  We're going to go to break.
[1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:14.720]  Come back with your calls for folks that have taken the vaccine to give us their take on it.
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:15.720]  Unfiltered.
[1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:16.720]  You love it. You hate it.
[1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:18.720]  We'd love to hear from you on the other side.
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:23.720]  Again, Dr. Mike, Jay, Manny, Emma, Graham, Jason, John, CD,
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:29.720]  Cali, Patriot, and others, 877-789-2539.
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:31.720]  And then we also have the solution to this.
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:33.720]  The French by the millions are out in the streets all over the country.
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:36.720]  They're saying no, they're not backing down.
[1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:38.720]  The police are exempt from these deadly inoculations.
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:40.720]  This is a big, big deal.
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:43.720]  Please also don't forget, in these trying times,
[1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:46.720]  it's more important ever to remember people are desperate for the truth.
[1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:55.720]  So, as ambassadors, as emissaries, as what do you call it when Christians go around the world?
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:12:56.720]  Missionaries.
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:59.720]  As missionaries of the truth of the New World Order and what it's doing,
[1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:02.720]  and how humanity is under attack, this dog only hunts,
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:07.720]  and the word only gets out, and lives only get saved when you tell people about the show.
[1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:10.720]  And more than ever, folks aren't ashamed of the show.
[1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:12.720]  The broadcast is exploding as all this horrible stuff comes true.
[1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:14.720]  We wish we didn't get to this point.
[1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:18.720]  I wish we could have stopped it, not have been that cuck that was wrong, but we're here now.
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:20.720]  And so people are ready to hear the truth.
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:23.720]  We'll tell them, hear the suppressed news, learn what you're not supposed to hear.
[1:13:23.720 --> 1:13:27.720]  For yourself, the number one attack show in the world at infowars.com,
[1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:29.720]  or if they won't let you send that over your email or text message,
[1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:31.720]  that's already happening on a lot of systems like WhatsApp.
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:37.720]  Send freeworldnews.tv, freeworldnews.tv,
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:40.720]  and that'll take them to Band-Aid video to see all the films and more.
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:43.720]  And we're going to create a backup site for info wars as well.
[1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:46.720]  We have newswars.com, all walks in our summit.news.
[1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:49.720]  But we'll be right back on the other side.
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:14:15.720]  Please stay with us for your phone calls.
[1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:29.720]  Please stay with us for your phone calls.
[1:14:49.720 --> 1:14:53.720]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist.
[1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:26.720]  Please stay with us for your phone calls.
[1:15:49.720 --> 1:15:56.720]  Please stay with us for your phone calls.
[1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:28.720]  What kind of nasty evil people want to take over America?
[1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:30.720]  Well, it's these kind of people.
[1:16:30.720 --> 1:16:33.720]  Look at these headlines that I'm going to your calls.
[1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:40.720]  Ontario woman charged after allegedly sexually assaulting a young boy in a park
[1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:44.720]  and raping him, and you look at it and it's a degenerate scumbag man.
[1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:49.720]  And he's a man, and he's got two eggs and a snake in his pants.
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:56.720]  But they're going to go along with the gaslighting that a woman raped a little boy in a park.
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:17:06.720]  Here's another one, transgender biological male cleared to compete in women's weightlifting in Tokyo Olympics.
[1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:11.720]  It's all a joke just to see what they can get us to take.
[1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:15.720]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[1:17:15.720 --> 1:17:23.720]  I'm just going to go in the order they're received here, and that would be Dr. Mike in Texas.
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:24.720]  Go ahead.
[1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:29.720]  So what is your experience or what's your view on taking the vaccine?
[1:17:29.720 --> 1:17:32.720]  Don't, in one word.
[1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:45.720]  Alex, I called the number that was listed on that paper you guys posted from Dr. Bart Klassen on the possibility of prion disease coming, being induced by this phony vaccine.
[1:17:45.720 --> 1:17:48.720]  I left my phone number in the morning.
[1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:50.720]  He called me back that evening, so he is approachable.
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:52.720]  We had a long discussion.
[1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:56.720]  He really does believe this produces prions.
[1:17:56.720 --> 1:18:03.720]  He used to work with Fauci back in the 80s, or at least starting in the 80s, knows him well and says that.
[1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:04.720]  Okay, this is huge.
[1:18:04.720 --> 1:18:07.720]  You've been calling on the show for like 16, 17, 18 years, maybe longer.
[1:18:07.720 --> 1:18:09.720]  Recognize your voice, Mike.
[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:10.720]  I'm glad you got in.
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:17.720]  Give the name and number of that doctor that put the big paper out on the study about prion disease, and we will call and get him on.
[1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:20.720]  That is a big tip, and we do want to get him on.
[1:18:20.720 --> 1:18:28.720]  But as a medical doctor yourself, and because I know who you are, we've had you on as a guest before, when you used to live in California, in the Montana, wherever the back to Texas.
[1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:38.720]  Give us your take on where this is going now, because it's one thing that Wolfgang Wodarg and Dr. Giedon and all these prestigious guys say this about blood clots before the inoculation began.
[1:18:38.720 --> 1:18:39.720]  Now it's happening.
[1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:42.720]  What is you as a medical doctor watching this unfold?
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:44.720]  What do you think is happening?
[1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:50.720]  It's a nightmare unfolding in slow motion before our eyes.
[1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:59.720]  I can't tell you how many family members, old friends that went ahead and for some reason they were in a big hurry to get the so-called vaccine.
[1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:09.720]  And then they had major problems, headaches, blood clots in their legs, things that are difficult to fix once, you know, once this thing.
[1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:14.720]  So you know why they wanted things to go back to normal, and now people are getting pissed or being told it doesn't go back to normal.
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:17.720]  How do you think that's going to go?
[1:19:17.720 --> 1:19:18.720]  I don't know.
[1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:20.720]  Obviously, we're in a death struggle here.
[1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:22.720]  At least these people are out in the open.
[1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:32.720]  It's like that old story that Andrew Jackson told, or told, told about Jackson that a young soldier said, the fog is so bad, sir.
[1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:34.720]  How am I going to be able to shoot the enemy?
[1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:41.720]  And Jackson says, don't worry, son, the fog will lift in time and you'll have ample time to deal with the enemy.
[1:19:41.720 --> 1:19:44.720]  These guys are out in the open now.
[1:19:44.720 --> 1:19:54.720]  Well, he said, don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes, because that way that old-fashioned rifle would have twice the acceleration power at 30 yards instead of 200 yards.
[1:19:54.720 --> 1:19:58.720]  So he always said, that was all guerrilla tactic, because he was in the first Revolutionary Wars.
[1:19:58.720 --> 1:19:59.720]  Mother and brother died in it.
[1:19:59.720 --> 1:20:01.720]  His dad had died before that working farm.
[1:20:01.720 --> 1:20:07.720]  I mean, Jackson was like the real Colanda Barbarian, but he was not a big, he was a tall guy, but not, you know, big muscular, like some bodybuilder.
[1:20:07.720 --> 1:20:12.720]  But yeah, he always told his troops, wait till they get right up close and then kill them.
[1:20:12.720 --> 1:20:23.720]  But Classen, you know, knowing Fauci well, says that the whole system there in Washington, at least the CDC, is in control of Mossad.
[1:20:23.720 --> 1:20:29.720]  And he sees this whole battleground as Mossad versus China for control of the world.
[1:20:29.720 --> 1:20:32.720]  But I, they kind of turned my head around underneath degrees.
[1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:33.720]  I didn't know what.
[1:20:33.720 --> 1:20:41.720]  No, I agree that the same power base that works with working in Israel, there's one power base that's allied with the Anglo-American establishment in Israel, the kind of Rothschild arm.
[1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:43.720]  You've got China's the other arm.
[1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:46.720]  They were both interconnected, but now they've double crossed each other.
[1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:47.720]  That's why you see dueling stories.
[1:20:47.720 --> 1:20:50.720]  Oh, the Israelis are spying on journalists.
[1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:53.720]  And then, oh, China's spying on Microsoft.
[1:20:53.720 --> 1:20:56.720]  And that's just each side threatening the other to bring that information out.
[1:20:56.720 --> 1:20:57.720]  Right.
[1:20:57.720 --> 1:20:58.720]  Here's his number.
[1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:02.720]  Let's not give it out on air just in case.
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:04.720]  Doc, guys, get this scientist number.
[1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:06.720]  Get his info.
[1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:11.720]  Again, Doc's telling you just, you know, inside the crew case weren't listening.
[1:21:11.720 --> 1:21:15.720]  It's one of the scientists that wrote the paper on the threat of prion disease.
[1:21:15.720 --> 1:21:17.720]  And Dr. Mike was impressed with it.
[1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:19.720]  So I want to try to get that to scientists on.
[1:21:19.720 --> 1:21:20.720]  Thank you, Dr. Mike.
[1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:22.720]  Okay, great caller out of the gate.
[1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:23.720]  But he didn't take it.
[1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:24.720]  He's telling you about family.
[1:21:24.720 --> 1:21:26.720]  They got really sick, a bunch of them taking it.
[1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:29.720]  And again, most of them are going to die down the road from this.
[1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:31.720]  That's what the scientists have predicted.
[1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:32.720]  And now it's happening.
[1:21:32.720 --> 1:21:34.720]  Very, very sad.
[1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:37.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jay in Missouri.
[1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:39.720]  Family member took the shot.
[1:21:39.720 --> 1:21:40.720]  Tell us what happened.
[1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:43.720]  Hey, Alex, I did not take it myself.
[1:21:43.720 --> 1:21:45.720]  I've got a female family member who did.
[1:21:45.720 --> 1:21:48.720]  And then about three months afterwards,
[1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:52.720]  she had her annual well woman check and found lumps in her uterus.
[1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:55.720]  And she's now scheduled for a full history.
[1:21:55.720 --> 1:21:56.720]  Well, that's right.
[1:21:56.720 --> 1:21:57.720]  Remember the news said,
[1:21:57.720 --> 1:22:00.720]  don't worry when you get lumps in your uterus or in your ovaries
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:01.720]  or in your body.
[1:22:01.720 --> 1:22:02.720]  It's not cancer.
[1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:04.720]  But then when you go to the doctor, they say,
[1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:05.720]  no, this is malignant cancer.
[1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:08.720]  So think of that headline, the mRNA shot.
[1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:11.720]  Let me guess, you take Pfizer or Moderna?
[1:22:11.720 --> 1:22:14.720]  I don't know which one exactly she took.
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:16.720]  She took it for a dumb reason anyway, just for,
[1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:18.720]  she wasn't forced to, but to not wear masks at work.
[1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:21.720]  You know, you can give her literature when they set up front.
[1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:23.720]  Oh, don't worry when you get tumors.
[1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:27.720]  Well, what's funny about it is when the family found out about it,
[1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:29.720]  I was the first one to point it out of, you know,
[1:22:29.720 --> 1:22:31.720]  the timeframe and all the news behind it.
[1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:33.720]  And then last at a family gathering,
[1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:35.720]  we tried to see if she was magnetic or not.
[1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:38.720]  And she was not willing to let us do that.
[1:22:38.720 --> 1:22:42.720]  Well, it actually hit the news quite a bit.
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:44.720]  COVID is causing a cancer crisis.
[1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:46.720]  The World Health Organization warns.
[1:22:46.720 --> 1:22:48.720]  And of course, that's them talking about,
[1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:51.720]  because people aren't getting diagnosed for cancer.
[1:22:51.720 --> 1:22:54.720]  And this is a big deal cause, sorry, go ahead, sir.
[1:22:54.720 --> 1:22:57.720]  No, I just find it amazing that right out the gate before,
[1:22:57.720 --> 1:22:59.720]  it was even rolled out much here in America,
[1:22:59.720 --> 1:23:01.720]  that they were saying it causes temporary infertility.
[1:23:01.720 --> 1:23:04.720]  And so supposedly for a drug that was made in nine months,
[1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:06.720]  I don't know how they know what was temporary
[1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:08.720]  and what was not right out of the gate.
[1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:10.720]  Well, I've seen it all over the news,
[1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:12.720]  record levels of hysterectomies of women
[1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:14.720]  that have taken the mRNA vaccines.
[1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:17.720]  We've had a lot of callers whose family members
[1:23:17.720 --> 1:23:20.720]  have had their uterus removed after they took this.
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:22.720]  If I got one more second,
[1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:25.720]  I actually ran into an old buddy on Saturday.
[1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:27.720]  His wife chose to get it as well.
[1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:29.720]  And she's gone through menopause,
[1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:32.720]  but started a menstrual cycle as well,
[1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:34.720]  two years after menopause after she took it,
[1:23:34.720 --> 1:23:35.720]  about six weeks after.
[1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:36.720]  Even mainstream media said,
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:39.720]  don't worry if you're 85 and had your period again.
[1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:40.720]  Everything's fine.
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:42.720]  And then now they want to give it to children, brother.
[1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:44.720]  How evil is that?
[1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:46.720]  It's terrible.
[1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:48.720]  Well, I appreciate you calling.
[1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:50.720]  Anything else?
[1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:51.720]  No, that's all. Thank you, brother.
[1:23:51.720 --> 1:23:52.720]  And God bless you.
[1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:53.720]  Thank you.
[1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:55.720]  And I do something that's very rude here on air,
[1:23:55.720 --> 1:23:56.720]  and it's rude to the crew,
[1:23:56.720 --> 1:23:57.720]  and it's rude to the listeners,
[1:23:57.720 --> 1:23:59.720]  and it's rude to the truth.
[1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:01.720]  I get very OCD with this wonderful crew.
[1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:07.720]  So you bring up the fact that it attacked your uterus.
[1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:09.720]  And you bring up the fact,
[1:24:09.720 --> 1:24:12.720]  and then I get mad because they can't instantly pull it up
[1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:15.720]  to show TV viewers that what you're saying is admitted.
[1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:16.720]  That's not realistic.
[1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:19.720]  That's very OCD of me, and I apologize.
[1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:23.720]  But yeah, that's why I get so angry, folks,
[1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:26.720]  is you understand I've seen hundreds of admissions
[1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:28.720]  where they go, don't worry if you get tumors in your breast.
[1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:30.720]  Don't worry if you start bleeding.
[1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:32.720]  Just go in and like, well, yeah, those are tumors.
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:35.720]  Doctors are being told, don't worry about those tumors.
[1:24:35.720 --> 1:24:36.720]  That's a headline.
[1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:37.720]  Doctors are being told,
[1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:39.720]  don't worry about tumors in the breast or uterus.
[1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:41.720]  They should go away in six months.
[1:24:41.720 --> 1:24:42.720]  What the hell does that mean?
[1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:44.720]  And then it doesn't, and it's killing people.
[1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:46.720]  They're giving you cancer.
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:47.720]  They're murdering.
[1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:49.720]  Can you believe this?
[1:24:49.720 --> 1:24:52.720]  I mean, what the hell, man?
[1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:53.720]  God damn it.
[1:24:55.720 --> 1:24:58.720]  The globalists are having their revolution,
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:01.720]  but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:05.720]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers
[1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:11.720]  trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:18.720]  and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves,
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:23.720]  worse than slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system,
[1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:27.720]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system
[1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:31.720]  and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:34.720]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:36.720]  that realizes a nightmare dystopia
[1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:38.720]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:41.720]  that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:43.720]  It's that choice, it's that realization
[1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:45.720]  that's going to change the world
[1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:47.720]  and it's the only choice we've got,
[1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:49.720]  freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:51.720]  It is a spiritual battle
[1:25:51.720 --> 1:26:19.720]  and it's the only choice we've got.
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:22.720]  This mouthwash only uses the best natural ingredients
[1:26:22.720 --> 1:26:26.720]  like real peppermint oil, thymol, xylitol
[1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:29.720]  and of course, high quality charcoal.
[1:26:29.720 --> 1:26:33.720]  Not only fluoride free, this mouthwash is completely free
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:38.720]  of other dangerous ingredients such as SLS, harsh detergents,
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:40.720]  BPA and so much more.
[1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:44.720]  As soon as you use it, you can tell that this formula is the real deal,
[1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:48.720]  so get your bottle of the new activated charcoal mouthwash
[1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:52.720]  right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:20.720]  I just want to throw a quick plug out for the owner of the product.
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:22.720]  The X2 does wonders.
[1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:24.720]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:27.720]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info war.
[1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:30.720]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air, thanks for rolling, go ahead.
[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:32.720]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you, it's an honor.
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:33.720]  Honor, talk to you.
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:34.720]  Awesome.
[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:38.720]  So, personally, I wanted to do was say I love the products,
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:41.720]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half,
[1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:44.720]  she loves it and it helps in the bedroom,
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:46.720]  so just number one for a few of you.
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:48.720]  It definitely works, it's not a joke.
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:28:17.720]  Absolutely.
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:28.720]  It was an inside job, folks.
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:37.720]  It was an inside job by the well connected.
[1:28:37.720 --> 1:28:39.720]  They cooked it all up at the Lohan, they released it,
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:42.720]  now they're taking the world over as our saviors.
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:44.720]  And they got big tech in the media,
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:47.720]  suppressing anybody that talks about alternative treatments
[1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:50.720]  or anybody that talks about how their mommy and their daddy died
[1:28:50.720 --> 1:28:52.720]  after they took the shot or how their neighbor had a stroke
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:55.720]  and is now in a nursing home at the age of 35.
[1:28:55.720 --> 1:28:58.720]  I asked the crew in the last caller,
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:01.720]  the last caller brought up, people getting cancer.
[1:29:01.720 --> 1:29:05.720]  I got mainstream news, reporting it like it's no big deal.
[1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:07.720]  This is health.com.
[1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:12.720]  This woman's COVID vaccine side effect led to stage two breast cancer.
[1:29:12.720 --> 1:29:16.720]  Oh, that's no big deal, sounds pretty good.
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:19.720]  The doctor said it's just an accident that you have a giant cancer
[1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:22.720]  right where they gave you the shot one month after.
[1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:24.720]  I'm not laughing at them, man.
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:26.720]  I'm laughing because I'm going crazy here.
[1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:29.720]  That's mainstream news, that's business news.
[1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:32.720]  Woman advised to delay mammogram after vaccine
[1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:34.720]  because they said, well, that is cancer,
[1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:36.720]  but maybe it'll go away.
[1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:39.720]  Cancer COVID, now it's COVID-19.
[1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:43.720]  Cancer 19 vaccines can cause lumps and mimic breast cancer.
[1:29:43.720 --> 1:29:46.720]  Oh, my goodness.
[1:29:46.720 --> 1:29:49.720]  Swollen lymph nodes reported after COVID-19 vaccines.
[1:29:49.720 --> 1:29:51.720]  Oh, they say don't worry about it.
[1:29:51.720 --> 1:29:54.720]  Oh, the COVID-19 vaccine can lead to false positive mammogram.
[1:29:54.720 --> 1:29:57.720]  Then it goes on to women having their uteruses removed
[1:29:57.720 --> 1:30:00.720]  after them swelling up and bleeding out.
[1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:04.720]  80-year-old women dying because gallons of blood pour out of them.
[1:30:04.720 --> 1:30:08.720]  Cancer-specific mRNA.
[1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:11.720]  It's all the studies on it attacking your immune system.
[1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:15.720]  Today, it's all the studies on it attacking your body.
[1:30:15.720 --> 1:30:18.720]  Health experts warn a side-effect of COVID-19 and COVID-19
[1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:20.720]  could cause cancer scare.
[1:30:20.720 --> 1:30:22.720]  Yeah, I remember that was like six months ago.
[1:30:22.720 --> 1:30:24.720]  Yeah, April. April, four months ago.
[1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:26.720]  They're like, oh, it might cause a cancer scare.
[1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:29.720]  And now it's like, well, you got cancer, record cancer,
[1:30:29.720 --> 1:30:32.720]  but it's okay because you got the vaccine.
[1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:35.720]  I got the vaccine. You got the vaccine.
[1:30:35.720 --> 1:30:37.720]  We get the vaccine.
[1:30:37.720 --> 1:30:39.720]  Health experts warn a side-effect of COVID-19
[1:30:39.720 --> 1:30:42.720]  that the vaccine could cause cancer scare.
[1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:43.720]  Oh, my gosh.
[1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:46.720]  A man in Italy got COVID-19 and his cancer went into remission.
[1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:48.720]  Oh, there's an article about how wonderful it was.
[1:30:48.720 --> 1:30:51.720]  It's a cancer cure.
[1:30:51.720 --> 1:30:53.720]  So give me some positive news there.
[1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:55.720]  Believe any of that.
[1:30:55.720 --> 1:30:57.720]  Man, I tell you, hey, but it's okay because, hey,
[1:30:57.720 --> 1:31:00.720]  did you hear a woman raped a little boy in a park in Canada?
[1:31:00.720 --> 1:31:03.720]  Yeah, he's got a penis, but it's a woman.
[1:31:03.720 --> 1:31:05.720]  I mean, they're just gaslighting us.
[1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:07.720]  We're like, going along with us.
[1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:08.720]  Okay, I'm going to shut up now.
[1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:09.720]  This is from Carolina.
[1:31:09.720 --> 1:31:11.720]  You tell us your news on the vaccine.
[1:31:11.720 --> 1:31:15.720]  How's that going for you and yours?
[1:31:15.720 --> 1:31:17.720]  Hi, Alex. Yeah, sorry.
[1:31:17.720 --> 1:31:19.720]  You still don't have anybody on this actually have the vaccine.
[1:31:19.720 --> 1:31:21.720]  I have a feeling that that might be difficult.
[1:31:21.720 --> 1:31:23.720]  Yeah, no one's calling you who likes it.
[1:31:23.720 --> 1:31:25.720]  Every person on the board says they hate it.
[1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:27.720]  I mean, I just don't know why it's so popular,
[1:31:27.720 --> 1:31:31.720]  but tell me how wonderful it is or tell me your story please.
[1:31:31.720 --> 1:31:32.720]  Right. Yes, sir.
[1:31:32.720 --> 1:31:37.720]  One of my best friends, both of his parents got the vaccine
[1:31:37.720 --> 1:31:45.360]  late January, they got the first dose of the Moderna. And his dad got very, very sick.
[1:31:45.360 --> 1:31:51.000]  This is a guy who's in his 80s, but he's he's driving to work every day and you know, relatively
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:58.280]  in shape. And he gets the first dose. He completely has to sit out of work. It's very, very ill.
[1:31:58.280 --> 1:32:03.720]  But and his wife gets a little bit ill, but not quite as bad. So they convince him he
[1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:12.200]  goes back, gets the second dose and immediately gets very, very ill as difficulty breathing.
[1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:20.520]  Two days later, he's in hospice. And two days after that, he's dead. So he died in February.
[1:32:20.520 --> 1:32:26.600]  And then his wife, I know how it is, old folks who are married for a long time. Sometimes the other
[1:32:26.600 --> 1:32:32.840]  one becomes depressed and also dies. But I know that her lung function went down drastically.
[1:32:32.840 --> 1:32:40.360]  And within two months, she lost complete use of her left lung. And then by
[1:32:42.120 --> 1:32:45.080]  the end of April, she was dead also. So they both died.
[1:32:45.080 --> 1:32:48.600]  How's the family feeling right now? They're going to give their children the shots?
[1:32:51.320 --> 1:32:56.520]  Well, my friend, he has not been vaccinated and his brother has also not been vaccinated.
[1:32:57.320 --> 1:33:00.840]  They were able to convince them to get the parents vaccinated because of the statistics.
[1:33:00.840 --> 1:33:07.720]  We all realized he, myself, others, our age sort of realized how illogical it was because of the
[1:33:07.720 --> 1:33:14.040]  low death risk from the actual virus. For somebody in our age bracket, it's one in a million.
[1:33:15.800 --> 1:33:19.880]  I believe it is. So now, now are they pissed that their parents were murdered because they
[1:33:19.880 --> 1:33:25.560]  need to now go out and warn people? I just, I just can't see people who have family die and
[1:33:25.560 --> 1:33:29.080]  they just take it. They go, well, that's how it works. And now they're coming for our children.
[1:33:29.080 --> 1:33:35.640]  Yes, sir. Unfortunately, that's kind of how their reaction has been. I think that they were pursuing
[1:33:35.640 --> 1:33:39.320]  getting the money, if there's some sort of government money to have your parents
[1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:44.520]  buried if they died of coronavirus. And they did say their official cause of death for both of
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:49.480]  them was coronavirus. Wow. Yeah, that's what they do when the virus kills you. God bless
[1:33:49.480 --> 1:33:53.000]  you, brother. I appreciate your call. Yeah, people lost their life instinct. They've lost
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:57.480]  their survival instinct. I mean, if somebody kills my parents, you're going to die.
[1:33:57.480 --> 1:34:03.000]  That's just how it works. And I can't help it. Hurt my kids too. You're dead. Or at least I'm
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:08.200]  going to try. And now everybody's just, well, my dad, my mom, they're dead. I get some money.
[1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:19.800]  Let's talk to John in California, callers of nurse. Stepson took the max. Tell us what happened,
[1:34:19.800 --> 1:34:24.600]  John. Appreciate you holding. How you doing, Alex? I've been listening to you for over 20 years.
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:31.880]  I've been a nurse for about 20 plus years. My wife's a nurse 20 plus years. Her son,
[1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:39.320]  my stepson, he's 22 years old. And just this past week, we took him to the emergency room for
[1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:45.080]  numbness, tingling all over his body, difficulty eating and keeping food down.
[1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:54.440]  And he doesn't live with us. But we found out that he took the vaccination that same week.
[1:34:56.680 --> 1:35:00.440]  Still there? Yes, sir. I'm right here. I'm listening to you.
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:08.760]  So my wife, she works currently with the VA and she runs a clinic. And I hear complaints all the
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:13.960]  time via her about patients that have had the vaccination and the problems they have.
[1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:20.760]  The symptoms, they're just a list of them, a plethora. So a needless to say, I have not taken
[1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:27.000]  the vaccination. I haven't taken vaccinations for as far back as I can remember. Well, let's be
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:30.520]  clear. They're all got a bad history and got problems and they spike them. But remember,
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:36.200]  this isn't a vaccine. This is a gene therapy that makes your body attack proteins in itself.
[1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:42.680]  I mean, they know exactly what they did. Well, I agree with you. That just makes it all the
[1:35:42.680 --> 1:35:47.400]  more reason why I would never take it. In fact, that's one of the reasons why I work in a specialty
[1:35:47.400 --> 1:35:52.120]  within my field, such that there's not a whole lot of pressure at this point. But I used to work
[1:35:52.120 --> 1:36:00.680]  for the LA Department of Public Health and I left for reasons related to this. I could see what was
[1:36:00.680 --> 1:36:06.520]  coming down the line, potentially mandated vaccinations, et cetera. And I was not going
[1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:11.880]  to participate in that. So I ventured out and I'm an independent. I'll leave it at that. But I don't
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:17.800]  have pressures at the moment for on that. But if at some point down the line, you know, it comes
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:22.440]  to me, I mean, that's the line in the sand, at least one of the lines in the sand. I will.
[1:36:22.440 --> 1:36:27.320]  Well, that's right. They're trying to say that vaccination. Biden's people say they publicly,
[1:36:27.320 --> 1:36:31.320]  they want us not be able to have a job or have our children. They literally want to put us in
[1:36:31.320 --> 1:36:35.800]  digital concentration camps. And we don't take this. It's so obvious. This is their big move.
[1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:41.000]  They know they've got to kill in name as many as they can. America rebelled against the globalist.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:44.920]  And so we're being hit with a weapon. Members present before he died said,
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:48.200]  we can no longer convince Americans. Now we need to start killing Americans.
[1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:51.880]  Did you know he said we need to start killing populist nations?
[1:36:53.400 --> 1:36:57.320]  And he helped fund Pol Pot and the Cameroos that killed one third of the Cambodians. So
[1:36:58.200 --> 1:37:02.120]  he wrote books bragging about it. So people understand this is their assault. It's a military
[1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:06.760]  attack through the medical system. So you trust it with big tech and the media suppressing it and
[1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:10.600]  covering it up, John. And I think we have to all let that full horror sink in here. What do you
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:23.720]  think we should do? What to do? We're going to have to make some difficult decisions as a population
[1:37:23.720 --> 1:37:28.600]  and as an individual. And those decisions that we're going to make is going to determine whether
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:33.080]  or not we're going to take the high road or the low road. And the high road in my mind is making
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:41.000]  that difficult decision so that long term we have freedom. And if we don't make that decision and
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:45.480]  they make it for us, we're going to go down in slavery. That's right. That's right. They're
[1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:50.360]  assaulting us with a high tech form of modern warfare that's covert. And so what do we do
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:55.480]  is the question. Thank you so much. Right back to your calls. X2 has been our number one best
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:38:01.720]  seller over the years. Deep earth crystal iodine. The good halogen. It is essential for all actions
[1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:06.040]  in the body. You must have it to live. The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:10.600]  disabilities because they don't have a iodine. We have X2 at two different bottles. Same amount
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:16.680]  in each bottle. But one has a spray top. One has a dropper top. 60% off on the spray top. 40%
[1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:22.040]  off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out. I want to thank all the
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:25.400]  supporters that have gotten these over the years. They're amazing. So that's a great deal for you
[1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:30.040]  to stock up on it. But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't
[1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:34.840]  experienced the good halogen for yourself. So X2 and the dropper bottle and the spray bottle.
[1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:39.880]  60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at infowarstore.com. But
[1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:43.720]  we're going to keep the spell going until it sells out. Probably take about two weeks. Don't
[1:38:43.720 --> 1:38:48.440]  procrastinate. Take advantage of the special right now at infowarstore.com and check out the new
[1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:57.160]  products we just got in as well. As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[1:38:57.160 --> 1:39:01.640]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people
[1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:05.880]  to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:10.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storeable food that's ready
[1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:15.720]  to ship while you still can at 20 or 20 prices. We have the biggest, best company in the United

[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:31.480]  week, Alex, but that's it. They won't do this sale again until November, and then the food prices
[1:39:31.480 --> 1:39:36.920]  go up in 2022. This is insurance you can eat. It's the highest quality, hundreds of high quality

[1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:58.840]  while you still can. The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years
[1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:04.040]  has now gone from beta testing to operational. The globalists are out of the open with their
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:09.400]  planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news is we've been working
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:13.720]  and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready
[1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:18.760]  for this, to be able to find it off. Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:23.000]  the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance,
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:27.560]  we will defeat it. So prayer is essential. Research is essential. Getting prepared is
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:32.280]  essential. And warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting

[1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:20.760]  Oh.
[1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:28.280]  Take you back to America.
[1:42:30.280 --> 1:42:39.000]  If you want it back, feel security and strength and being the leader. Because we love God,
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:47.400]  we love justice, we love individualism. Then the evil came and intimidated us with political
[1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:56.680]  correctness. And we bowed down to it. And now the dam is broken. And all of our freedoms are
[1:42:56.680 --> 1:43:02.520]  draining away. By the minute things get worse. When will you decide to say no? When will you
[1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:10.360]  decide to not back down anymore? All right, let's go to Andrew. And then we'll go to Michael
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:13.560]  or Michelle and others. Andrew, you're on the air from Florida. Go ahead.
[1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:20.760]  How are you doing? I've got a couple of things for you. The first thing is about three months ago,
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:26.120]  I was scrolling down on my Facebook feed and I noticed that my brother-in-law had, you know,
[1:43:26.120 --> 1:43:31.480]  how they do the whole virtue signaling thing on their profile pic saying that, hey, I got mine.
[1:43:31.480 --> 1:43:36.600]  I got my vaccination and he and his wife did. And I leaned over to my wife and I said, you know what?
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:43.880]  Someday he may come to regret that. And sure enough, within 30 days, we've got a call in the
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:49.080]  morning on Sunday morning. I'll never forget it stating that his wife had passed away. This was
[1:43:49.080 --> 1:43:57.160]  within 30 days of a blood clot. And they were going to, of course, they're not going to admit
[1:43:57.160 --> 1:44:00.840]  what it was or anything like that. That was my next question is what's the reason the globalists
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:06.040]  are doing this is the sheeps they're killing never admit they've been hurt. It's like Stockholm
[1:44:06.040 --> 1:44:11.800]  syndrome. So I bet he'll push for his grandkids to take it. And if they die, he'll still love it,
[1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:16.680]  right? Oh yeah, absolutely. In fact, his whole family could die. He'd still do it. Exactly.
[1:44:16.680 --> 1:44:20.280]  Because he won't admit an outside group attacking. He won't admit he's under attack.
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:25.800]  Absolutely. Because I live in Florida, but my family lives in Michigan and New York.
[1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:30.040]  And to my complete astonishment, they're not all on the left for sure. I even have a lot of
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:35.720]  military in my family and who have never taken vaccines in their life. And I called right around
[1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:44.280]  Mother's Day and come to find out my entire family has taken all the vaccines, except one
[1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:49.480]  family, two family members. One is my cousin and she's the only one in the medical field. And she
[1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:54.280]  says, I will not take this thing. There's not enough testing on this thing. And then the other
[1:44:54.280 --> 1:45:00.440]  one is our granddaughter. And that is our biggest fear because in New York, they are going to push
[1:45:00.440 --> 1:45:03.640]  her and she's in a private school. This is not public school. Yeah, what's going to happen when
[1:45:03.640 --> 1:45:08.680]  you're when somebody's kid dies and then the teacher, whoever pushes the principal ends up
[1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:12.440]  getting major repercussions. If you know what I mean, I mean, listen, they're pushing a war. You
[1:45:12.440 --> 1:45:15.720]  get where this is going because they're never going to be able to hide what happened. They're
[1:45:15.720 --> 1:45:20.040]  planning the civil war that comes out of the vaccine damage to end the country. That's why
[1:45:20.040 --> 1:45:24.280]  they're pissed though, because they haven't even gotten half the public to take it. They're lying
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:28.520]  when they say that it's more about 40%. But like you said, in the Northeast, in those areas, for
[1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:32.600]  whatever reason, where they were really locked down hard, they wanted out of the lockdown. So
[1:45:32.600 --> 1:45:36.920]  they but what are they going to do now that they're told lockdown to is coming and more shots are
[1:45:36.920 --> 1:45:42.760]  needed? I thought this shot was going to protect them. Only hope to because when we're going to
[1:45:42.760 --> 1:45:47.320]  be going up there for the first time, and we haven't seen any of them in almost two years now,
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:51.960]  and we want to go up there and visit and try to convince them not to give our granddaughter
[1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:56.840]  this shot. And they're at least a little bit open to the fact that maybe this isn't the safest thing.
[1:45:56.840 --> 1:46:01.480]  And you know, so I'm trying to give them some information on it. But I'm even surprised too
[1:46:01.480 --> 1:46:06.440]  at one one last thing is I'm surprised that someone who they're both conservatives down here in
[1:46:06.440 --> 1:46:13.160]  Florida. And we went over to a pool party. And I noticed that one of my friends, she said, well,
[1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:17.000]  you know what, I've got to go in and have this operation done this week, I'm getting this thing
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:23.480]  taken out of me. And I was looking over and she she has a light palma. And it's one of those,
[1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:27.000]  you know, side effects that, you know, from the virus, of course, I didn't say that, you know,
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:30.600]  that's directly from the vaccine. But I'm going, Oh, my God, everybody I know is having effects
[1:46:30.600 --> 1:46:36.520]  on this thing. Sir, they hit us with a weapon. And they know how humans work. If humans make
[1:46:36.520 --> 1:46:40.840]  a big deal about something, we make a big deal. Stalin said one man dies. It's a horror show.
[1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:45.800]  It's a tragedy. 10,000 dies of statistic. They know if they just normalize it will accept it
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:50.760]  like having now a third of our boys are autistic to some degree. Soon it'll be half then it'll be
[1:46:50.760 --> 1:46:55.640]  all I mean, they're killing us. And God bless you. Sorry for your family. Take them a stack of news,
[1:46:55.640 --> 1:47:01.480]  a stack of documents and just warn the hell out of them, please. My God is a race against time,
[1:47:01.480 --> 1:47:06.280]  isn't it? I'll guarantee you, though, the new world order is going to pay for this. But see,
[1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:09.640]  they're slaves of Satan. They know that too. They're scared. They're ordered to do this.
[1:47:11.160 --> 1:47:15.960]  Let's go to Michelle in Pennsylvania. Finally, a caller who did take it. Thank you for calling
[1:47:15.960 --> 1:47:21.320]  and getting in and holding. Tell us what happened. Hi, Alex. I'm the only boyfriend or a huge fan
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:27.560]  just to let you know. But a recent calling is, yeah, I got pressured into taking the vaccine
[1:47:28.200 --> 1:47:34.360]  by my family and my dad, especially. He wouldn't stop harboring about it. And I, me, we were against
[1:47:34.360 --> 1:47:40.200]  it very much in my stupidly caves and took it. I was so healthy before I took this thing. I am
[1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:45.800]  like right now, like everything's a mess. I'm covered in scabs and blood clots and bruises.
[1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:51.800]  You're like scabs aren't going away. I keep coughing. My lungs are congested all the time.
[1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:56.040]  And I have nausea. Like ever since I got it, I have this nausea where literally
[1:47:56.040 --> 1:48:01.400]  I can be anywhere and I'll just start throwing up. Like, you know what's happening. Your body is
[1:48:01.400 --> 1:48:06.680]  producing a toxic spike protein. This is such a sick joke. I mean, they knew it would do this to
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:11.960]  you. I'm so sorry. Yeah, I literally feel like I'm dying all the time. Like it's horrible. Like
[1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:17.560]  how does your father feel? Is he proud of himself? He probably would blame it on anything else,
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:22.600]  I'm sure. He's still a supporter, but I mean, I'm waiting for when I die. Maybe then I'll
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:27.880]  give a point. Yeah, it's ridiculous. He'll probably feel different when something happens.
[1:48:27.880 --> 1:48:32.680]  Well, I hope you don't die. But here's the problem. It only hit you earlier. And who knows
[1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:36.440]  how this is going to work. But you know, in the studies, it killed the mice on average in about
[1:48:36.440 --> 1:48:41.000]  two months. That's a couple years in humans. So I hope you don't die. And that's what I keep asking
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:47.880]  medical doctors and scientists and we don't know. Is there a way to reverse the spike protein growth,
[1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:52.600]  the crystal growth? Because basically, the best knowledge we have is you have a form of
[1:48:52.600 --> 1:48:57.000]  mad cow disease now. And I don't know how you reverse it. I guarantee the globalists have
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:00.280]  a way to reverse it. They're obviously not going to tell us. Have you done any research on that?
[1:49:02.200 --> 1:49:05.240]  Have I? No, I would like to do some though.
[1:49:05.240 --> 1:49:12.120]  Well, I'm sorry. And you know why I'm really sorry? I care about you, Michelle, but you understand
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:17.240]  the evidence overwhelming. They've been admitted in EU law now and big pharma Pfizer admits this
[1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:22.760]  sheds. So even if you wouldn't have taken it, we can everybody could get this anyway. So think
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:30.120]  about how diabolical that is. Yeah, this is crazy. I think this is like absolutely ridiculous if
[1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:34.760]  they're doing this to people. Well, they're going to pay. And the reason is they've never paid
[1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:39.480]  physically. And that's why they keep doing this. And so we just have to keep notes of this. And
[1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:44.760]  what do you make a big pharma trying to suppress people like you, even women and men that die,
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:48.840]  they suppress their funerals on big tech, aiding and abetting the evil. That makes me angry.
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:54.200]  Yeah, that's that's ridiculous. Yeah, the worst time is in nausea.
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:49:58.040]  Honestly, that like it's just like really hard to deal with that part, especially
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:03.160]  which vaccine did you which so called vaccine did you take the Moderna?
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:07.320]  Did you take both shots? I did, unfortunately.
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:12.920]  Did you have any ill effect the first shot? No, I didn't if this didn't start happening
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:18.600]  till after the second shot. Yeah, I have a family member who did want to listen to me and
[1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:23.080]  thinks I'm crazy. And they took the first shot got seriously ill and they haven't taken the second
[1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:28.600]  shot yet. And but they're thinking about it. So, you know, I guess, gotta prove me wrong.
[1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:35.000]  God got a show. It's great. One of the shots from the Pfizer. Thank you so much and God bless
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:40.040]  you. Pray to God, Michelle. God has power. And just we need all research. How do we
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:48.600]  it's not a virus, folks. It is your body producing a spike protein, a virus attacks you. So,
[1:50:48.600 --> 1:50:58.120]  you create a spike protein. What? God help us. But what we know is I answered my own question.
[1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:03.800]  I'm not going to be medical advisor. But what we know is the vaccine is much worse than the COVID
[1:51:03.800 --> 1:51:08.440]  itself. But COVID does the same thing as the vaccine. So, what's helping people? Steroids.
[1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:14.120]  So, just like you're having an autoimmune response to bad pollen, you go get a steroid shot.
[1:51:15.720 --> 1:51:18.600]  Corporate to corporate ticket or how would you say it? My brain's not working right.
[1:51:19.320 --> 1:51:22.680]  I'm not a doctor, but I used to work with a large animal that small that before that you would give
[1:51:22.680 --> 1:51:29.800]  them the depo med roll and stuff like that. There's a non-anabolic steroid. And if things
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:34.120]  were going shocky or having really big autoimmune responses or a dog couldn't get up and walk,
[1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:37.800]  you know, you give them a shot of that. I know they have aerosolized steroid that cured almost
[1:51:37.800 --> 1:51:41.080]  everybody that had COVID. They were having an autoimmune response. They'd be dying. Couldn't
[1:51:41.080 --> 1:51:45.080]  breathe. They'd give them that. And then that would fix it. Showing the doctors it wasn't viral.
[1:51:45.080 --> 1:51:50.920]  It was an autoimmune response to it. Hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, huge dosages of vitamin C,
[1:51:50.920 --> 1:51:57.240]  things like that, huge doses of vitamin D. Whatever fights the virus, it tends to say would
[1:51:57.240 --> 1:52:02.760]  then counter the vaccine that's basically growing the equivalent of the virus to spike protein in
[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:08.280]  you. Not giving medical advice. I'm just saying, what do you have to lose? Take a lot of zinc,
[1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:14.920]  take a lot of C, take a lot of, I would take iodine, I'd drink a crap ton of water,
[1:52:14.920 --> 1:52:19.000]  and I would probably fast and just squeeze that crap out of you and your body.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:24.680]  You know, here's the problem. The Rockefellers and Gates tested stuff for decades of what would
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:29.320]  really be nasty and hard to be. So they've hit our people for every race, color, and creep.
[1:52:29.320 --> 1:52:32.680]  It's just a horrible thing. It's really hard to come and grips with that. They did this. They
[1:52:32.680 --> 1:52:39.480]  did it. We are in the depopulation now. Wow. Wow. Can you imagine once the dial is all over,
[1:52:39.480 --> 1:52:45.960]  there's people dead everywhere. It's already happening. X2 has been our number one bestseller
[1:52:45.960 --> 1:52:51.800]  over the years. Deep earth crystal iodine, the good halogen, it is essential for all actions
[1:52:51.800 --> 1:52:56.120]  in the body. You must have it to live. The UN estimates two billion plus people have cognitive
[1:52:56.120 --> 1:53:00.280]  disabilities because they don't have enough iodine. We have X2 and two different bottles,
[1:53:00.280 --> 1:53:05.480]  same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top. 60% off on the spray
[1:53:05.480 --> 1:53:11.800]  top, 40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out. I want to thank
[1:53:11.800 --> 1:53:15.080]  all the supporters that have gotten these over the years. They're amazing. So that's a great
[1:53:15.080 --> 1:53:19.560]  deal for you to stock up on it. But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence
[1:53:19.560 --> 1:53:23.960]  and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself. So X2 and the dropper bottle and the
[1:53:23.960 --> 1:53:29.800]  spray bottle, 60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:53:29.800 --> 1:53:33.560]  But we're going to keep this cell going until it sells out. Probably take about two weeks.
[1:53:33.560 --> 1:53:37.800]  Don't procrastinate. Take advantage of this special right now at infowarstore.com
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:39.640]  and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[1:53:39.640 --> 1:53:51.240]  The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm. They are
[1:53:51.240 --> 1:53:56.600]  discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral commission,
[1:53:56.600 --> 1:54:03.560]  the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome. And so even though it seems like the
[1:54:03.560 --> 1:54:09.560]  globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out the open to attack human freedom
[1:54:09.560 --> 1:54:16.520]  because they're actually losing. We have forced them out in the open. So as bad as these times are,
[1:54:16.520 --> 1:54:21.400]  a lot of negative things are about to happen. Realize humanity is winning. You've got to trust
[1:54:21.400 --> 1:54:28.760]  in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice. That is invincible. That is ethereal,
[1:54:28.760 --> 1:54:34.520]  timeless, and unstoppable. So don't trust in man. Trust in God to lead God and direct your soul
[1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:38.920]  and then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones
[1:54:38.920 --> 1:54:44.200]  and my crew to you. We will never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:57.960 --> 1:55:05.080]  All right, we're back. My fellow head, Mike Wendell joining us next segment after he leaves
[1:55:05.080 --> 1:55:09.160]  for a couple of seconds. We're going to go back to your calls. And then we've got Gerald Slantek
[1:55:09.160 --> 1:55:13.720]  coming up. And I want to go to people that hold the longest. Manny and then Emma, Manny's in Florida,
[1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:18.200]  Emma's in California. Manny, welcome. Tell us your view on the vaccine or what you witnessed.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:25.080]  All right. Hi. By the way, I used to listen to Rush Limbaugh and now I follow you because,
[1:55:25.080 --> 1:55:30.600]  you know, you're a great dude. I see you when I was a kid, face to face, you gave me some good
[1:55:30.600 --> 1:55:38.600]  advice and I see what the reality is. My mother-in-law has took in the vaccine and she's having a
[1:55:38.600 --> 1:55:47.560]  problem that I've seen on TikTok that her legs won't lift. And there was a woman on TikTok
[1:55:47.560 --> 1:55:51.880]  that had the same problem and said- Yeah, millions have it. It's called Guillaume Barre.
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:55:56.200]  And it's the nerve endings not working. I can totally paralyze you and kill you.
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:56:02.760]  Yeah. And then my father-in-law, who threatened my life because I refused to let my wife and
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:09.640]  my three kids and also she's pregnant with my current even youngest child.
[1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:12.920]  Oh, wow. So even the husband of the lady that's been hurt by it now wants you to hurt your
[1:56:12.920 --> 1:56:18.840]  children with it? Yes. And I literally got arrested for defending myself. And Florida
[1:56:18.840 --> 1:56:21.720]  has a law called the Castle Doctrine.
[1:56:21.720 --> 1:56:26.440]  So he came over to kick your ass because he's the big hero because she wouldn't take an experimental
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:33.560]  pharmacot. Wow. Yes. And I refused my lady and the kids to take it too, which even a nurse said
[1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:42.600]  that she doesn't recommend the women to take it. Oh, exactly. But notice how every grandpa now,
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:46.360]  and I'm not bashing grandpa, so that's what's happening. He's the enforcer. He's the doctor.
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:51.560]  He's going to make sure you take it. Yeah. And the cops actually seen my flag that
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:57.720]  I have. I have 1776 with the people, the American flag, the Bessie Ross flag, and they
[1:56:57.720 --> 1:57:02.920]  literally said the only thing that they're going to arrest me on is prior charges of felony battery.
[1:57:04.760 --> 1:57:11.000]  Well, it sounds like your father-in-law is an idiot. Yeah. He told them that I pushed him
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:15.320]  because he threatened my life to say that he was going to kill me in my own home in the
[1:57:15.320 --> 1:57:20.840]  Castle Doctrine clearly states that I was incorrect. I even told the cops that by law,
[1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:27.560]  you're violating my constitutional rights and it's illegal for you to arrest me when he's the one
[1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:30.920]  that... Well, Manny, you're a good father and they're going to wage war on all of us. This is
[1:57:30.920 --> 1:57:36.360]  just getting started. Thank you so much, Manny. Bruce in... No, no, it was Emma. Emma in California.
[1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:43.240]  Go ahead. You're on the air. Oh, hello. Yes, go ahead. Welcome. Yes, thanks for taking the call.
[1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:51.320]  So my good friend, his 80 years old, took the first vaccine in February. We tried to talk
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:56.280]  him out of that one, but he was so scared. His image was, I don't want to be on a respirator,
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:58:00.440]  so he took it. But we talked him out of the second one because we showed him all the
[1:58:00.440 --> 1:58:07.480]  facts. But unfortunately, two months ago, he started seeing blood and then his platelets
[1:58:07.480 --> 1:58:12.040]  went really low down to 53. Yeah, that's the thing. It attacks your kidneys and your blood, yeah.
[1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:18.440]  Yeah. And so this is what's interesting though. So they didn't tell the hospital that he took
[1:58:18.440 --> 1:58:22.840]  the vaccine because they heard that sometimes when you say that, they won't treat you. So
[1:58:23.720 --> 1:58:29.880]  the doctor let it slip and said, oh, that's kind of funny. We see these cases mostly in people who
[1:58:29.880 --> 1:58:34.280]  have been vaccinated. So that's one thing that's really strange. And then the second thing was,
[1:58:34.280 --> 1:58:39.800]  is how they told him on the hospital that he had the vaccine, they said that insurance
[1:58:39.800 --> 1:58:46.360]  wouldn't have covered a COVID-19 vaccine injury. And then now it turns out he has leukemia and
[1:58:46.360 --> 1:58:50.680]  he's being treated for leukemia because that's the only thing that will try to get his blood
[1:58:50.680 --> 1:58:56.040]  platelets down is by using chemo. And that's because it's creating the spike protein that
[1:58:56.040 --> 1:59:01.400]  basically is. Yeah. It's creating the spike protein that basically is a blood platelet.
[1:59:01.400 --> 1:59:05.880]  Wow, pure evil. And he's really healthy. And it's not like he's a totally healthy
[1:59:05.880 --> 1:59:10.680]  baby or like tennis four times a week. He's healthy. He's never had any. Well, is he awake now?
[1:59:10.680 --> 1:59:16.200]  Because before he dies, he needs to warn some people. Yeah. Well, yeah, I don't know that
[1:59:16.200 --> 1:59:20.120]  they're willing to do that. You never know. They'll all, you know, he might. That's incredible.
[1:59:20.120 --> 1:59:24.280]  Yeah. They don't have a life force or instinct. I'm not against this guy, but he needs to warn
[1:59:24.280 --> 1:59:31.240]  people. Who is the famous guy that played Pharaoh in the Ten Commandments? Yule Brenner.
[1:59:31.240 --> 1:59:34.520]  And before he died, he said, whatever you do, don't smoke. He had lung cancer.
[1:59:34.520 --> 1:59:38.440]  They say tens of millions of folks quit smoking. I know my uncle quit smoking from that. Just
[1:59:38.440 --> 1:59:42.760]  whatever you do, don't smoke. Stop smoking. And all these folks dying of these things,
[1:59:42.760 --> 1:59:46.280]  they need to get up there. They need to speak out. God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[1:59:46.280 --> 2:00:16.120]  All right. We've got a very special guest right ahead. Stay with us.

[2:01:09.480 --> 2:01:15.640]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've got our special guest, Mike Lindell of mypilla.com,
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:22.760]  who's been really leading the effort to expose the fraudulent election of 2020. But the Democrats say
[2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:28.920]  how dare you question any election, even though they said they were going to challenge this election,
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:36.520]  no matter what. But here are top Democrats agreeing with the founder of mypilla.com. Here it is.
[2:01:37.400 --> 2:01:41.320]  I continue to think that our voting machines are too vulnerable. For researchers have repeatedly
[2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:46.200]  demonstrated that ballot recording machines and other voting systems are susceptible to tempering.
[2:01:46.200 --> 2:01:51.320]  Even hackers with limited prior knowledge, tools and resources are able to breach voting machines
[2:01:51.320 --> 2:01:56.280]  in a matter of minutes. In 2018, electronic voting machines in Georgia and Texas deleted
[2:01:56.280 --> 2:02:01.320]  votes for certain candidates or switched votes from one candidate to another. The biggest seller of
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:07.480]  voting machines is doing something that violates cybersecurity 101, directing that you install
[2:02:07.480 --> 2:02:12.760]  remote access software, which would make a machine like that, you know, a magnet for fraudsters and
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:18.520]  hackers. These voting machines can be hacked quite easily. You could easily hack into them. It makes
[2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:24.200]  it seem like all these states are doing different things. But in fact, three companies are controlling
[2:02:24.200 --> 2:02:29.560]  that it is the individual voting machines that some pose that pose some of the greatest risks.
[2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:35.320]  There are a lot of states that are dealing with antiquated machines, right, which are vulnerable
[2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:40.120]  to being hacked. The workers were able to easily hack into the electronic voting machine. It was
[2:02:40.120 --> 2:02:48.600]  possible to switch votes. 43 percent of American voters use voting machines that researchers have
[2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:55.640]  found have serious security flaws, including backdoors. We know how vulnerable now our systems
[2:02:55.640 --> 2:03:00.120]  were. We know, I know that hackathon that took place last year where virtually every machine
[2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:04.360]  was broken into fairly quickly. I actually held a demonstration for my colleagues here at the
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:12.760]  Capitol where we brought in folks who, before our eyes, hacked elections. This goes on for an hour.
[2:03:12.760 --> 2:03:17.240]  I'm not going to play it all. Mike Lindell of MyPelo.com is here with us. And I want to just say
[2:03:17.240 --> 2:03:20.600]  something before we give you the latest numbers and him being vindicated and all the stuff that's
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:24.520]  coming out, whether it's August that Trump can be reinstated or September, October, it doesn't
[2:03:24.520 --> 2:03:29.400]  matter. It's about our election integrity. That's about not letting them steal the midterms. And
[2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:33.640]  Mike Lindell is right. You've got to be positive and point out they stole this election with the
[2:03:33.640 --> 2:03:37.160]  evidence. You've got to say we want Trump reinstated or it's never going to happen. You've got to
[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:42.680]  believe and that's how we bring them down because we have the evidence. But talk about a trailblazer.
[2:03:42.680 --> 2:03:48.040]  Suit all these big groups, attacked, lied about, demonized with all the evidence of the hacking
[2:03:48.040 --> 2:03:52.680]  that went on and the ballot harvesting and the stuffing and all of this being confirmed and the
[2:03:52.680 --> 2:03:58.440]  ballots that weren't folded and the Scantron ballots and all of it. Thank God for Mike Lindell
[2:03:58.440 --> 2:04:02.760]  and his spirit and what he's done. And now it's gone from when he started six, seven months ago
[2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:08.600]  questioning from 60% of Republicans questioning to 80 plus percent and it's gone from 50% of
[2:04:08.600 --> 2:04:13.960]  Democrats questioning up to 40%. So the vast majority of Americans on average about 60%
[2:04:13.960 --> 2:04:18.840]  and growing know the election was stolen. So the majority of people know the truth. The question is
[2:04:19.480 --> 2:04:24.680]  then how do we see that reinstatement or because now the courts, the lawsuits are getting filed
[2:04:24.680 --> 2:04:31.560]  confirming with the evidence of fraud in Georgia and other states like Arizona. We now have the
[2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:36.120]  real proof for courts. So Mike Lindell, thank you for being a trailblazer. Tell us the latest
[2:04:36.120 --> 2:04:43.880]  information. Well, it's all good. We got great things are coming everybody. Everybody knows on
[2:04:43.880 --> 2:04:49.400]  January 9th, I got attacked because starting from that point on, because, you know, in November and
[2:04:49.400 --> 2:04:54.840]  December, I was like everybody else. I was like, all these deviations are going, what happened?
[2:04:54.840 --> 2:05:00.760]  What happened? Well, I kept looking at numbers and looking at different states and counties and
[2:05:00.760 --> 2:05:05.080]  one of the things I felt I noticed was the numbers were too big. It had to be done by
[2:05:05.080 --> 2:05:11.720]  computers or machines. There wasn't enough people to put that many ballots to change that many.
[2:05:11.720 --> 2:05:16.520]  And when I got this evidence on January 9th, totally different. It explained everything.
[2:05:16.520 --> 2:05:23.880]  It was a hack with the machines and so what I've ever since that day for five months now I've been
[2:05:23.880 --> 2:05:31.560]  attacked almost daily. And so what I'm doing now, it's a cyber symposium. It's August 10th,
[2:05:31.560 --> 2:05:37.960]  11th and 12th and you're going to see starting this week Wednesday morning at 10 a.m. You're
[2:05:37.960 --> 2:05:43.160]  going to get one of the biggest announcements you've ever heard. It'll be heard around the world and
[2:05:43.160 --> 2:05:48.920]  it involves this symposium. It's not open to the public. Everybody needs to watch it. It'll be 72
[2:05:48.920 --> 2:05:54.840]  hours streamed on Frankspeech.com. We're bringing in all the cyber experts. We're bringing in all
[2:05:54.840 --> 2:05:59.720]  the, I invited all the government, all of our government, state legislatures, federal,
[2:06:00.920 --> 2:06:06.920]  attorney generals, governors and all the media. And what we're going to do, we're going to show them
[2:06:06.920 --> 2:06:12.280]  all the packet captures from the whole election. Everything was captured from start to finish.
[2:06:12.280 --> 2:06:20.440]  The evidence is not subjective. It is 100% you can't argue it. And when we do that,
[2:06:21.720 --> 2:06:25.880]  right after that, we're going to be bringing the case to the Supreme Court with the states as the
[2:06:25.880 --> 2:06:31.320]  plaintiffs. And I truly believe because it's non-subjective evidence, they can't say 8 to 1
[2:06:31.320 --> 2:06:37.880]  or 7 to 2. It'll be 9-0 to bring the selection down. I've said it before, every election in our
[2:06:37.880 --> 2:06:43.560]  country's history, the person that won, when fraud was involved, gets put back in. There's no
[2:06:43.560 --> 2:06:51.000]  statute limitations. So you, the statute limitations are gone. I mean, in this, you're going to
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:57.160]  reinstate Donald Trump this fall. And the mainstream media, they've been, or the media's been slamming
[2:06:57.160 --> 2:07:02.840]  Mike Lindell back shopping his claim of August. Well, excuse me, I'm off by a month or so.
[2:07:02.840 --> 2:07:07.960]  But they, the bottom line is this is going to be taken down. Also, the day of the symposium,
[2:07:07.960 --> 2:07:13.240]  the three days, we're going to show an alternative way to get rid of these machines and an alternative
[2:07:13.240 --> 2:07:18.680]  way to vote. I've already seen it, Alex. It is 100%. I don't believe you could hack it ever.
[2:07:18.680 --> 2:07:22.200]  And it's going to be amazing. We have a lot of changes coming up and we're going to get our
[2:07:22.200 --> 2:07:26.520]  country back. Well, Mike, most people don't have the courage you've got to put your money where
[2:07:26.520 --> 2:07:31.160]  your mouth is and do rallies all over the country and to put tens of millions of dollars into all
[2:07:31.160 --> 2:07:35.800]  the research. And now all these cyber experts are coming out and they're confirming that
[2:07:35.800 --> 2:07:40.680]  there was access into the computers and a racing of the roles and then lying about it. And then
[2:07:40.680 --> 2:07:45.480]  now look at Arizona where they keep battling to never release it to the legislature under law,
[2:07:45.480 --> 2:07:52.200]  where they may have to arrest them. What are they hiding? Yeah, exactly. Well, the, you know,
[2:07:52.200 --> 2:07:56.840]  if, you know, everybody, I want everybody to know we have, I have the packet captures of
[2:07:56.840 --> 2:08:02.520]  the whole election. So no matter what would happen in the States, you don't need that. If you have
[2:08:02.520 --> 2:08:08.040]  the packet captures in cyber forensics, you have everything you need. But now if you didn't have them,
[2:08:08.040 --> 2:08:13.400]  now you need to do these state, these audits of full forensic audit, which is the machines,
[2:08:13.400 --> 2:08:19.800]  the ballots and the routers. Now, what's in a router? You have packet captures in routers.
[2:08:19.800 --> 2:08:23.640]  But that's what I was about to say. They are not releasing that under court order. Why would they
[2:08:23.640 --> 2:08:29.960]  release it if there wasn't fraud? 100%. This is the thing is, and you ask yourself this,
[2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:34.680]  like, you can bring it right down to why is Doug Ducey, the governor of Arizona,
[2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:40.120]  such an obstructionist, and he's a Republican, these, these county board members, Republicans,
[2:08:40.120 --> 2:08:43.640]  why are they obstructing? What are they hiding? They're not, are they doing it because they
[2:08:43.640 --> 2:08:48.120]  don't want their party in power anymore? I don't get it. And then you got Brian Kemp in Georgia,
[2:08:48.120 --> 2:08:53.240]  Brad Rassenberger, you guys, when the dust clears here, they got an answer to the American people.
[2:08:53.240 --> 2:08:58.280]  Are they traitors? Why would they do this to it? Why would they say, hey, you've got a court order?
[2:08:58.280 --> 2:09:03.160]  Go in and look at whatever you want. It shouldn't have even came to a court order. We own these
[2:09:03.160 --> 2:09:07.800]  machines, everybody. That's right. The public we paid for them. In Georgia, Doug, or I mean,
[2:09:07.800 --> 2:09:15.560]  Brian Kemp bought $107 million of Dominion machines in 2019 on taxpayer money, everybody,
[2:09:15.560 --> 2:09:22.120]  on taxpayer money. Explain yourself. Well, let's expand on that. The Democrats are now really scared
[2:09:22.120 --> 2:09:26.760]  of what's coming out. The Justice Department's trying to block it. They're trying to block what
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:31.800]  the states are doing. They're trying to block what you're doing. Again, this shows total guilt.
[2:09:31.800 --> 2:09:36.280]  Plus, I understand you're right. It's the hacking is the main way they do it. But you also have them
[2:09:36.280 --> 2:09:41.640]  grabbing the suitcases out, running the same ballots. That's all confirmed, falsifying. I mean,
[2:09:41.640 --> 2:09:47.800]  we got them at every level. Right. I call that the organic theft, Alex. I did a speech yesterday
[2:09:47.800 --> 2:09:53.240]  in California, and they asked me, they go, Mike, but does your data show that he won California,
[2:09:53.240 --> 2:10:00.120]  Donald Trump? And I said, well, let me tell you, there's two kinds of that I call a crime. One of
[2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:05.320]  them is the cyber crime, the biggest crime against our country. I can't even believe it's historical
[2:10:05.320 --> 2:10:12.120]  proportion. Now, if you take the cyber crime out of California, Donald Trump still loses by a little
[2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:17.480]  bit. But if you add in, now this is subjective because I don't know how broad it is. If you add
[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:24.440]  in the organic crime, which means illegal aliens voting, minors voting, non-residents voting,
[2:10:24.440 --> 2:10:29.080]  people that have seven ballots said to them, people that people that people that pulled
[2:10:29.080 --> 2:10:34.440]  suitcases out from under tables voting, if you add that in, he wins even California. It was the
[2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:39.560]  biggest. It was 80 million. This is the real colors. And we're going to show this at the symposium.
[2:10:39.560 --> 2:10:44.600]  All right, final segment with Mike Lindell giving us an update. We got some of the very exciting
[2:10:44.600 --> 2:10:50.600]  talk about as well. Mypilla.com promo code Alex. I misspoke. It's 66% off up to that.
[2:10:54.200 --> 2:10:59.960]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person,
[2:10:59.960 --> 2:11:04.680]  it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.
[2:11:05.320 --> 2:11:10.760]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[2:11:51.800 --> 2:11:57.320]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown. The first one has already destroyed
[2:11:57.320 --> 2:12:00.920]  the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death,
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:04.200]  and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the Western world.
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:07.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality,
[2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:12.680]  storeable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices. We have the biggest,

[2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:09.080]  But seriously, the UN admits two plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because of
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:13.240]  lack of iodine. You need to experience it for yourself. It takes two weeks to a month to kick
[2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:17.480]  in. Try it and tell me what you think. You can't lose your fund in the M4. And again,
[2:13:17.480 --> 2:13:22.840]  I can harp on this all day, but just like our information is dead on from research,
[2:13:22.840 --> 2:13:29.800]  I'm telling you, I couldn't do what I do without deep breath crystal iodine and X2.
[2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:35.560]  Just in the stamina and mental focus area, it's incredible. What it did for libido is incredible.
[2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:39.480]  When I don't take it, I feel the difference. When I do take it, I'm so empowered.
[2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:44.680]  Get your X2 today, discounted in the spray bottle and in the eyedropper bottle to take
[2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:48.680]  it under your tongue at infoorstore.com. The globalist hope you don't explore
[2:13:48.680 --> 2:13:53.880]  how incredibly powerful deep breath crystal iodine is.
[2:14:19.080 --> 2:14:38.680]  Well, the head of mypilla.com, Mike Lindell, is certainly fighting back against tyranny.
[2:14:38.680 --> 2:14:43.000]  He's certainly a man of action. The vast majority of Americans agree with him.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:49.400]  And the evidence is just pouring out. What do you expect the establishment to do as this
[2:14:49.400 --> 2:14:54.200]  evidence becomes overwhelming, Mike Lindell? And why are you so confident Trump will be reinstated?
[2:14:54.200 --> 2:14:58.120]  You've been saying that for six months. Trump's talking about reinstatement,
[2:14:58.120 --> 2:15:03.400]  panicking with Democrats. What would be the process of making the puppet president Biden step down?
[2:15:04.840 --> 2:15:09.080]  Well, after we do the cyber symposium on the 10th, 11th and 12th,
[2:15:09.080 --> 2:15:13.720]  we've already got the case ready. It'll be the states. They'll be the plaintiffs. We'll bring
[2:15:13.720 --> 2:15:19.640]  it to the Supreme Court. It's called a quoll warrant. And when we bring it there, they're
[2:15:19.640 --> 2:15:25.160]  going to pull it down 9-0. They'll have a lot of options. So they could push it back to the states,
[2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:30.600]  but because it was an attack by China, we believe that they'll just pull it down 9-0.
[2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:36.360]  Because it affects so many down tickets, maybe they'll say, hey, you need to do a new election.
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:41.960]  I don't know that part. I'm not with them. But in every other case, everybody in the country's
[2:15:41.960 --> 2:15:46.920]  history, they take the winner and put him back in right away and they finish out that term.
[2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:52.520]  Now, everybody always asks me, well, would Donald Trump get extra time? And according to my lawyers
[2:15:52.520 --> 2:15:57.400]  and stuff, it doesn't look like he would. He would just go right up to the 2024 election.
[2:15:57.400 --> 2:16:03.640]  And that would be it. But as we know, everything going on right now, time is of the essence because
[2:16:03.640 --> 2:16:08.840]  our country is getting destroyed day by day by day with decisions that are coming out of D.C.
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:13.640]  And it's not helping anyone, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, it's not helping
[2:16:13.640 --> 2:16:18.440]  any people. It's helping other countries. And Mike, when you talk to Trump, I mean,
[2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:23.080]  he's come out and said, I think I may be reinstated. Evans is coming out. I know you talked to him.
[2:16:23.080 --> 2:16:28.200]  What is he saying? Does he seem positive or where is Trump in all this?
[2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:34.120]  He seems very, he's very positive because he sees other things happening on other fronts,
[2:16:34.120 --> 2:16:39.320]  like Arizona, that audit coming out, they found all that, all the stuff they're finding in Georgia.
[2:16:39.320 --> 2:16:45.240]  We have new audits starting in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. This is all going to come crumbling down
[2:16:45.240 --> 2:16:52.360]  like Domino's. And he's getting validated for everything he said in November,
[2:16:52.360 --> 2:16:57.960]  December, of course, this election was stolen. So he's just getting validated and proven right.
[2:16:57.960 --> 2:17:03.800]  And, and, but he's, he's, whenever I talk to him, he's very concerned about that the time
[2:17:03.800 --> 2:17:09.240]  factor he tells people to say, you know, there's not going to be a 2022 or a 2024. We have to
[2:17:09.240 --> 2:17:15.960]  address 2020. And you've got to fix the pathway going forward too. There can't be machines and,
[2:17:15.960 --> 2:17:21.080]  and also he's worried about, especially the border, the stuff that's going on down there that he put
[2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:26.920]  in place and, and all of these things that, that he put in place, these great things that
[2:17:26.920 --> 2:17:33.880]  manifested to December of 2019, when we were all in our happy place, everybody was, everybody that
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:40.200]  consumer confidence at an all-time high, well, those were from, they was manifested from great
[2:17:40.200 --> 2:17:48.200]  political decisions made by Donald Trump. And so yeah, but he's very positive there's been a big
[2:17:48.200 --> 2:17:54.200]  shift because I think everybody in our country, you know, each, as days go by, more and more
[2:17:54.200 --> 2:17:59.960]  evidence keeps coming out in spite of the media trying to stop us. They've attacked me. You know
[2:17:59.960 --> 2:18:05.080]  what, you know what I did Alex the other day, I sent all of the media from Huffington Post to
[2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:11.080]  Political Daily Beast Business Insider, um, New York, New York Times, CNN, I thanked them all
[2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:16.600]  because they're the only ones that, that kept me in the news and attacked me every day.
[2:18:16.600 --> 2:18:20.600]  Mike Lindell lost four more retails. I said, did you hear about China, the attack through the
[2:18:20.600 --> 2:18:25.560]  machine? Did you hear about Dominion, Dominion, Dominion? And every day I got attacked, but at
[2:18:25.560 --> 2:18:30.360]  least I was able to voice what I wanted to say. Shame on Fox, where have they been? Now, I've
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:34.200]  talked about it. And by the way, it's coming out now that they hacked Microsoft with Bill Gates's
[2:18:34.200 --> 2:18:38.920]  help, all of it. I mean, we are literally are under Chi-Com attack and, and China Joe is controlled
[2:18:38.920 --> 2:18:43.240]  by them. I mean, he's got to go, even if he won the election, which he didn't, he's got to go,
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:50.520]  he's a Chinese spy. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, all these two, when you find out all this stuff was
[2:18:50.520 --> 2:18:57.480]  with, uh, you know, Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey and Google, all these that were in on it.
[2:18:57.480 --> 2:19:03.400]  I mean, you know, oh, great. They put billions of dollars in to manipulate local votes and
[2:19:03.400 --> 2:19:08.520]  everything else. It's insane. Yeah. Oh, they did more than that. It's all going to come out. Jack
[2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:14.360]  Dorsey especially, well, Mark Zuckerberg too, but Jack Dorsey, I mean, they broke laws, clear back,
[2:19:15.240 --> 2:19:21.080]  clear back to the primaries with Dr. Shiva in Massachusetts. He got caught red-handed doing
[2:19:21.080 --> 2:19:26.760]  stuff for the secretary of state. And all this stuff's going to come out, but that's after the fact.
[2:19:26.760 --> 2:19:31.560]  Absolutely. Listen, listen, you've been gracious to come on in your car in a parking lot there in
[2:19:31.560 --> 2:19:36.520]  your minivan. We really appreciate you. But I want to talk about something keeping you operating in

[2:20:16.360 --> 2:20:21.160]  It got some great support into info wars to keep us on air. So Mike, tell us about my pillow.com
[2:20:21.160 --> 2:20:27.800]  promo code Alex. Yeah, it's up to 66% off everybody, but I want to tell you just a couple of them.
[2:20:27.800 --> 2:20:33.480]  And I'm only offering to like your, to Alex, to like your listeners and, uh, and it's a basically
[2:20:33.480 --> 2:20:39.560]  a radio podcast special. This is got this. We're doing this this week. I passed the savings of
[2:20:39.560 --> 2:20:45.080]  all of the box stores that have canceled my pillow and attacked our company and I have 2,500
[2:20:45.080 --> 2:20:51.080]  employees you're supporting. Well, the towels are clear about the middle man and instead helping
[2:20:51.080 --> 2:20:56.200]  radio shows and shows that help with the truth out and you're doing a great job up to 66% off.
[2:20:56.200 --> 2:21:03.960]  Tell folks about it. Right. And the towels are normally $109.99. They're only $39.99. The lowest
[2:21:03.960 --> 2:21:10.040]  price in history. You have geezer dream sheets. I'm going to put them at 50% off. Um, and those
[2:21:10.040 --> 2:21:16.600]  are the lowest price ever as lowest $49.99 for a set of my, the greatest sheets ever. Um, you've
[2:21:16.600 --> 2:21:21.560]  got my brand new bed commercial, my bed I developed just came out. You guys got it checked out.
[2:21:21.560 --> 2:21:26.680]  There's no bed like it in the world. And then, you know, you've got my pillows, my regular premium
[2:21:26.680 --> 2:21:31.960]  pillows that are normally $69.99. These are the ones you see in the box stores I have left,
[2:21:31.960 --> 2:21:39.720]  like, um, where they're $39.99 and up to $69.99 only $29.99. So what I've done is to help out
[2:21:39.720 --> 2:21:44.840]  like your show with your show, Alex and all these other podcasts and people that have been
[2:21:44.840 --> 2:21:50.520]  canceled out and to help my pillow. I'm just passing the savings directly on to the public.
[2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:54.520]  And by the way, let me explain this. They've taken the sponsorship in the last five years
[2:21:54.520 --> 2:21:58.440]  from all major nationalists in patriot radio. I talked to everyone. They said,
[2:21:58.440 --> 2:22:03.080]  you didn't know Lindell is the guy keeping most of talk radio afloat and all your employees. I mean,
[2:22:03.080 --> 2:22:07.240]  literally you are a superstar, bro. And our listeners buying great products are as well.
[2:22:07.240 --> 2:22:10.680]  We've got to build our own economy. We've got to have our own system. And people don't know
[2:22:10.680 --> 2:22:14.600]  how tenuous this is. I mean, how important this funding is and how great these products are.
[2:22:14.600 --> 2:22:20.440]  Right. Well, it's like helping a cause and you get something great in return. I mean,
[2:22:20.440 --> 2:22:25.640]  I mean, this was a perfect fit when they canceled out the 24 retailers they canceled,
[2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:30.600]  they canceled me part of the cancel culture from Costco, Bed Bath and Beyond, Coles,
[2:22:30.600 --> 2:22:35.560]  all the shopping channels. So I just said, you know what, and they usually take 50 some percent
[2:22:35.560 --> 2:22:40.920]  everybody of everybody's product is country. So we passing the savings on that's why we can not
[2:22:40.920 --> 2:22:46.120]  only not only save you all kinds of money, but you're right. Supporting all the podcasters that
[2:22:46.120 --> 2:22:51.320]  have been canceled on crooked YouTube and I know you got to go, but you got to finish up. Hold on.
[2:22:53.640 --> 2:22:59.400]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person,
[2:22:59.400 --> 2:23:04.200]  it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.
[2:23:04.840 --> 2:23:10.200]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever to use every tool we've got.

[2:23:51.880 --> 2:23:55.000]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air trying to move quicker.
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:56.280]  Hey, Alex. Welcome.
[2:23:56.280 --> 2:24:01.400]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[2:24:01.400 --> 2:24:05.560]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amp
[2:24:05.560 --> 2:24:12.920]  UT and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away. A living defense saved my life.
[2:24:12.920 --> 2:24:18.760]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back.
[2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:25.160]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew
[2:24:25.160 --> 2:24:32.680]  24, verse nine. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall
[2:24:32.680 --> 2:24:39.400]  be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one
[2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:44.760]  another and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at brother. And that's because God's
[2:24:44.760 --> 2:24:48.920]  name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it

[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:10.680]  All right a few more minutes with Mike Lindell here on the Alex Jones show that I'm going to
[2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:15.640]  write to Brian, Denise, Eva, Rose, and Alice that have been patiently holding to tell their
[2:27:15.640 --> 2:27:20.840]  vaccine stories. Again, MikeLindell.com. We're working with him and he's really been great. His
[2:27:20.840 --> 2:27:25.240]  people have been great and I had called him a couple weeks since he was on there contacting us
[2:27:25.240 --> 2:27:29.800]  saying hey do you want the money from the revshare? I'm like oh yeah the revshare. He's offered you
[2:27:29.800 --> 2:27:33.240]  a promo code in there. I just wanted to support what he's doing because I know the enemy's coming
[2:27:33.240 --> 2:27:36.280]  after him because we're in the same boat, Mike Lindell and I. We've been attacked by the same
[2:27:36.280 --> 2:27:41.320]  people, the same Democratic party, the same law firms trying to shut us down but we're happy
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:45.160]  about it. We're charging for because we know we're doing the right thing. You know I just
[2:27:45.160 --> 2:27:51.320]  want to say this in closing when you were on Jimmy Kimmel and he tried to discredit you and you
[2:27:51.320 --> 2:27:56.680]  were so charming you just totally disarmed him and then they said the public loved you even more
[2:27:56.680 --> 2:28:02.440]  after that. You are just a very likable guy and so I think it's not just great products you've got.
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:07.400]  I mean what is it Mike about you that you're just so likable because I'd already bought your products
[2:28:07.400 --> 2:28:11.160]  years ago just because you were so likable and then I loved them but you've got what they call
[2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:18.440]  high Q scores in TV. Well I don't know it's I have kind of you know we do all our own commercials.
[2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:25.240]  I've just always enjoyed helping people and the products I make it's problem solution
[2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:31.080]  and they help people. I love hearing people's response and I guess I am when I believe in
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:35.960]  something I'm all in and I do my due diligence so it's pretty hard like when on Jimmy Kimmel
[2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:40.600]  I just be myself and I'm going you know I'm not going to change but I don't have to worry about
[2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:46.040]  changing any answers and you know I want to say something about Jimmy Kimmel when I was on there.
[2:28:46.040 --> 2:28:50.920]  I wanted to reach the other side you know I wanted to reach the Democrats and stuff and get the word
[2:28:50.920 --> 2:28:56.200]  out so they so they really know that this happened and Jimmy had read my book and halfway through
[2:28:56.200 --> 2:29:02.120]  the interview we went to a commercial and I said Jimmy you know they tried to cancel you out last
[2:29:02.120 --> 2:29:07.000]  summer because he had done blackface in the 90s and I said Jimmy remember when they tried to do
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:11.400]  that to you and he goes we have something in common there and Jimmy goes Mike the difference is
[2:29:11.400 --> 2:29:16.760]  I did something bad all you did was back a man you believe in and I thought that was in then at the
[2:29:16.760 --> 2:29:21.880]  end of the interview he shook my hand I think he was kind of torn when he did his interview
[2:29:21.880 --> 2:29:27.480]  because he's seen I mean I didn't go in there with any any vengeance or anything I'm just not
[2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:31.720]  Jimmy Kimmel's a fan of my show I'll leave it at that I'm not going to get an inside baseball but
[2:29:32.280 --> 2:29:37.480]  he overall is a good guy that's halfway sold his soul but I'm just saying the intent was by the
[2:29:37.480 --> 2:29:41.480]  executives to make you look bad it backfired on him so now I notice they try to not give you any
[2:29:41.480 --> 2:29:47.080]  coverage. Yeah absolutely they want to attack me that was part of the big attack that's been going
[2:29:47.080 --> 2:29:53.480]  on they just want to wipe out my pillow and wipe out my voice and there and God's blessed me with
[2:29:53.480 --> 2:29:59.720]  the very big platform and and if I if I can't if they wanted to that's why that was an all out
[2:29:59.720 --> 2:30:05.880]  attack from bots and trolls to the you know this cancel culture and I was number one on the list
[2:30:05.880 --> 2:30:11.080]  and everybody everybody they went after everybody but and they tried they thought Jimmy was going
[2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:17.240]  to be the last nail and he actually got a lot of flat friends so did ABC for let me out why did
[2:30:17.240 --> 2:30:22.040]  you let Mike Lindell on why did you let him out you know because they didn't treat me bad enough I
[2:30:22.040 --> 2:30:27.720]  guess amazing in closing what else you want to add about the stolen election where this is going

[2:33:00.120 --> 2:33:05.960]  and what good guys you know they call us hey you didn't collect the money you just made up I'm like
[2:33:05.960 --> 2:33:12.040]  wow and so that partnership should really help us stay on air because it's been a it I'm not
[2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:17.080]  complaining it's just I don't want to spend my time trying to raise money and I'm not complaining I
[2:33:17.080 --> 2:33:21.000]  mean you know you know cry me a river I'm just saying I want to stay on air I want to hire more
[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:26.520]  crew I want to fight the new world order and instead I mean I'm doing stuff like selling my house
[2:33:26.520 --> 2:33:31.000]  which is fine because I don't want that I didn't trust banks years ago I saw the market going up
[2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:35.480]  about a bigger house knowing that if the Austin market was going to double in three years which
[2:33:35.480 --> 2:33:39.480]  it more than did I could take that as an investment and put it back into info wars which we're doing
[2:33:40.360 --> 2:33:43.960]  and we've got a lot of other stuff going on you know I haven't made 300 million dollars like
[2:33:43.960 --> 2:33:51.320]  Mike Lindell we've made millions and we plowed almost all of it back into this operation and that
[2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:54.680]  big house means nothing to me in fact it's actually a hassle I'm glad to be selling and getting rid
[2:33:54.680 --> 2:33:59.720]  of it I did it as you know it literally is an investment I just want a small house with a nice
[2:33:59.720 --> 2:34:04.440]  big kitchen in the middle of the countryside and just to be away from people but you know they're
[2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:07.000]  not going to let us do that ladies and gentlemen they're going to keep coming after us until we
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:11.960]  defeat them and so I'm very excited about working with Mike Lindell we're going to set up a marketplace
[2:34:11.960 --> 2:34:16.520]  with him because you know they're trying to take our platforms away our banking away everything and
[2:34:16.520 --> 2:34:23.880]  we've been able to do it but he's got platforms that because he's got so big that he we can get
[2:34:23.880 --> 2:34:28.120]  deals with him that we can't get with other people and that's the thing coming up together under
[2:34:28.120 --> 2:34:32.840]  umbrellas and and then and then reaching out and networking is how we're going to defeat this okay
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:39.800]  Brian Denise Eva Rose and Alice I'm going to get to all of you if you're a new listener just
[2:34:39.800 --> 2:34:44.760]  tuned in we were taking calls from folks about their experience with the vaccine uh so let's
[2:34:44.760 --> 2:34:49.560]  Susan hold the longest and that would be Brian in Arizona tell us what happened
[2:34:50.200 --> 2:34:56.440]  fine she's been trying with a phone number uh he may have me on hold and I know he's talking
[2:34:56.440 --> 2:35:01.320]  can you hear me Brian oh I'm right here yeah I'm here all right can you hear me I can't go ahead
[2:35:01.320 --> 2:35:10.680]  yeah no I would I just want to say love you out um so my brother he's uh 53 years old about a week
[2:35:10.680 --> 2:35:19.240]  before Easter his wife is a jabber for uh CBS or for Albertsons or something like that yeah so he
[2:35:19.240 --> 2:35:25.000]  got the J&J vaccine and then I get a phone call it was one week before Easter I get a phone call
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:32.760]  10 o'clock Easter night and my brother pretty much died they got him back uh he had to get open
[2:35:32.760 --> 2:35:40.120]  heart surgery one of the valves the fluid around his heart one of the valves like uh was damaged
[2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:45.400]  so when they opened them up to do the open heart surgery they saw all the blood clots on his lungs
[2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:53.320]  so they did some procedure on his lungs so now his lungs are damaged 58 percent he's 100 percent
[2:35:53.320 --> 2:35:58.360]  oxygen dependent now for the rest of his life he can't get an operation on his lungs because
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:02.920]  it's irreversible uh Brian stay there because your phone was breaking up at first I want you
[2:36:02.920 --> 2:36:07.720]  to start over and complete this testimony this is powerful this is exactly what the top scientist
[2:36:07.720 --> 2:36:12.520]  Wolfgang Wudarg and Dr. Giedon and others warned what happened uh before it was released it all
[2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:16.760]  happened now and it's advisories now they admit this can happen they try to call it rare now they
[2:36:16.760 --> 2:36:22.360]  admit it's not rare think of the magnitude they knew in the animal studies the University of Texas
[2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:28.920]  with similar vaccines under Fauci and Bill Gates in 2012 this was going to happen and I want to
[2:36:28.920 --> 2:36:34.040]  know if your brother who did the J&J shot does the exact same thing causes an autoimmune response
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:38.360]  to the spike protein I want to know if he's still for it if he has children if he's planning
[2:36:38.360 --> 2:36:42.840]  to kill them I'm serious this all these folks are under stock on they're like I'm dying give
[2:36:42.840 --> 2:36:46.680]  more people give more people it's like a great delusion well they're right back don't hang up Ryan

[2:41:27.320 --> 2:41:35.640]  brian in arizona i want him to start over with because he was talking fast he was excited to
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:39.800]  get on and i was interrupting as his phone was breaking up some start over about somebody's
[2:41:39.800 --> 2:41:44.520]  working at a pharmacy they're the ones giving the injections somebody takes a j and j what happens
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:52.840]  start over brian and tell folks what happened all right so uh my brother's wife is a jabber for a
[2:41:52.840 --> 2:41:58.600]  pharmacy here in arizona so when my brother didn't want to get a double shot but go back
[2:41:58.600 --> 2:42:03.400]  twice so he said she said hey i got a johnson and johnson come down here so he gets a johnson
[2:42:03.400 --> 2:42:11.080]  and johnson shot about a week before easter so i get a phone call easter night about 10 o'clock
[2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:17.240]  at night saying hey your brother's in the emergency room he's gonna have open heart surgery he pretty
[2:42:17.240 --> 2:42:25.720]  much died for like 12 seconds and uh so they go in there was a fluid around his heart and the fluid
[2:42:25.720 --> 2:42:29.880]  filled up one of the valves so they had to go inside and fix one of the valves in his heart
[2:42:29.880 --> 2:42:36.600]  and when they opened them up they noticed the blood clots were like uh attached to his lungs so
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:43.320]  so they fix whatever they need to fix with that and then his lungs were damaged 52 percent you
[2:42:43.320 --> 2:42:49.640]  only has 48 percent of lung capacity left it's irreversible he's on a hundred percent oxygen
[2:42:49.640 --> 2:42:57.800]  dependent now and uh so well here's the thing they call it rare but i could open the phones
[2:42:57.800 --> 2:43:05.080]  up all day and before this happened again top research scientist nobel prize winners others
[2:43:05.080 --> 2:43:09.640]  said this will cause blood clots in the lungs the brain and the heart because they knew i mean
[2:43:09.640 --> 2:43:14.360]  again bill gates and all them knew this why do you think they got such big balls i mean because a
[2:43:14.360 --> 2:43:18.840]  lot of people are gonna come after them i don't i don't just mean with lawyers i mean they really
[2:43:18.840 --> 2:43:24.520]  did this they really did this people can go back a year and a half ago folks a year ago eight months
[2:43:24.520 --> 2:43:30.680]  ago before the shot started and we had a guest on that told you exactly what would happen you don't
[2:43:30.680 --> 2:43:35.480]  think fouchy and bill gates didn't know and it turns out they did studies where the animals died
[2:43:35.480 --> 2:43:43.400]  of blood clots in their lungs a hundred percent of them god the evil sorry go ahead says oh you're
[2:43:43.400 --> 2:43:48.360]  crazy you're crazy so i send them all everything that i see that you put out or i don't mean to
[2:43:48.360 --> 2:43:52.680]  interrupt again wait wait wait so you warned him and they still say you're crazy tell us about that
[2:43:53.720 --> 2:43:58.920]  oh yeah so now his eyes are a little bit open now he's not saying you're crazy he's like can you
[2:43:58.920 --> 2:44:04.280]  send me this can you send me that his wife now shuts up when i'm around before they were trying to

[2:44:11.640 --> 2:44:15.640]  and then they were telling me how crazy i was well now my brother wants information on
[2:44:17.240 --> 2:44:22.120]  on what i find about blood clots on the lungs about heart issues so he's kind of opened his
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:29.560]  eyes a little bit well sir i'm sorry this happened to your brother how old's your brother he's uh

[2:46:46.680 --> 2:46:55.880]  got that skin that just keeps growing on the plate not like healing like you should your skin on top
[2:46:55.880 --> 2:47:02.680]  should be healing and closing up this stuff keeps growing underneath well you know i got a stack of
[2:47:02.680 --> 2:47:07.640]  articles where they say don't worry when you take this new vaccine it's going to make you have tumors
[2:47:07.640 --> 2:47:12.200]  but they're not bad but the doctors go no those are malignant we got to remove them i mean think

[2:52:49.640 --> 2:52:57.800]  we have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological
[2:52:57.800 --> 2:53:05.880]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves
[2:53:06.920 --> 2:53:13.800]  worsted slaves just just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile
[2:53:14.440 --> 2:53:20.600]  minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and safety and control we have to recognize
[2:53:20.600 --> 2:53:24.920]  their great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to
[2:53:24.920 --> 2:53:30.840]  promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia it's that choice it's that
[2:53:30.840 --> 2:53:36.520]  realization that's going to change the world and it's the only choice we've got freedom or slavery
[2:53:36.520 --> 2:53:41.000]  go to evil it is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:51.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:53:55.320 --> 2:54:01.080]  there's a man going round taking names so they hit you with something so hardcore that grows
[2:54:01.880 --> 2:54:07.000]  protein crystals in you until it kills you kill some people in six months some in five years some
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:13.000]  in a day and they just think you're able to cover it up and get away with it eva you're in texas
[2:54:13.640 --> 2:54:18.600]  and you're talking about all these family members getting the vaccines and dying and that your own
[2:54:18.600 --> 2:54:23.560]  family's not waking up to it well this is just terrible thing to hear what else would you like
[2:54:23.560 --> 2:54:32.040]  to finish up and say it doesn't matter how much we warn people they think we're crazy and that's
[2:54:32.040 --> 2:54:38.760]  just infuriating all my cousins they've seen this happening and i'm crazy i'm the crazy one does that
[2:54:38.760 --> 2:54:43.480]  make sense so yes they won't admit they're under attack they don't have life force they don't have
[2:54:43.480 --> 2:54:48.760]  survival instinct i don't understand it it's the stock home syndrome like you always speak of and
[2:54:48.760 --> 2:54:54.440]  it is just ridiculous i don't know what else to do i don't know what else to do alex how else to
[2:54:54.440 --> 2:55:00.600]  open well just recap slowly how who in the family and what and do you know what supposed shot they
[2:55:00.600 --> 2:55:07.720]  done okay i don't know what anybody took but my brother took it in march and immediately got sick
[2:55:07.720 --> 2:55:14.360]  needed to be sent to the hospital he fought for a week his body was attacking itself according to
[2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:20.440]  the medical staff he was having heart attack after heart attack brain damage each time he had a heart
[2:55:20.440 --> 2:55:25.480]  attack ultimately he wasn't going to come back so they just let him pass that was like a family
[2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:32.200]  decision his daughter took the shot she went into convulsions as soon as she took it which i'm
[2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:37.560]  wondering if it may be a bloodline thing like if i were to take it well exactly i was about as soon
[2:55:37.560 --> 2:55:41.720]  as you said that i bet it's genetic because it hits everybody but some people worse because
[2:55:41.720 --> 2:55:48.200]  we hear about a lot of clusters in families where it like kills everybody yes now my mom has impact
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:54.040]  i was saying that it seems that she has a doctor who is awake so he sent her to nuclear medicine
[2:55:54.040 --> 2:55:59.640]  if i'm not mistaken and they actually found out that she's got those crystal prions growing on
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:06.040]  poor organs they've operated her already twice on her heart to try to help her but i have to take
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:10.120]  her to the hospital last night she's in the emergency right now i don't think they call them
[2:56:10.120 --> 2:56:17.080]  prions or do they just say it's blood clots no they call them crystal prion wow yeah that's in the
[2:56:17.080 --> 2:56:22.920]  medical studies they sent her through nuclear medicine i don't know what kind of but they
[2:56:22.920 --> 2:56:29.640]  they saw it and let's explain folks these are infectious these are infectious it's so damn
[2:56:29.640 --> 2:56:35.880]  scary all i know is fouching gates are gonna pay pay for this right now thank you so much man i'm
[2:56:35.880 --> 2:56:41.640]  sorry to hear that after your family wow i'm really fighting mad right now alice in arkansas or as we
[2:56:41.640 --> 2:56:47.160]  say around here arkansas welcome alice go ahead and tell us your story okay uh first of all my
[2:56:47.160 --> 2:56:56.680]  daughter-in-law is a pa in michigan and she took the uh fizer and back in february and within 90 days
[2:56:56.680 --> 2:57:01.640]  so she started bleeding from her rectum she too has the stockholm syndrome but i don't call it
[2:57:01.640 --> 2:57:08.280]  stockholm syndrome i call it judgment because god said if you did not love the truth he would give
[2:57:08.280 --> 2:57:14.600]  you strong delusion to believe and love the lie so your damnation would be secured it is judgment
[2:57:14.600 --> 2:57:21.640]  because you did not want the truth and called all of god's messengers conspiracy theorists this is god
[2:57:21.640 --> 2:57:28.200]  working and i have two the reasons that i called in was not so much about the fact that she took
[2:57:28.200 --> 2:57:35.240]  the shot but because i have two reasons uh to save lives number one i believe they have contaminated
[2:57:35.240 --> 2:57:41.800]  the blood supply because all of their um and i i ran this through a holistic doctor he agreed with me
[2:57:41.800 --> 2:57:49.880]  all of their uh diseases and you know nano robots their cryon crystals their you know all the stuff
[2:57:49.880 --> 2:57:55.000]  that they replicate or sell all that stuff can be transferred to the people who go in for surgeries
[2:57:55.640 --> 2:58:01.080]  or automobile accidents in the blood transfusion so i want you to think about that that's very
[2:58:01.080 --> 2:58:07.560]  important they've contaminated the blood supply number two um i was made in the likeness and image
[2:58:07.560 --> 2:58:15.240]  of god i genetically identified to jesus christ and the family of god why in the world would i
[2:58:15.240 --> 2:58:20.760]  want to take anything that would change my genetic sequence to the new world order global
[2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:27.480]  anti christ beast and be in the family of satan i do not want to stand in front of jesus christ
[2:58:27.480 --> 2:58:34.120]  and try to explain that to him you are actually making your choice do you want to genetically
[2:58:34.120 --> 2:58:40.120]  identify to the family of god or do you want to genetically identify to the global beast it is

[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:34.040]  the news and the medical literature and what they're saying is exactly what's happening
[3:00:34.040 --> 3:00:40.440]  i mean this is this is just a crime of all of human history this is this is the biggest thing
[3:00:40.440 --> 3:00:43.800]  ever and it's all done to the medical system i think they're gonna get away with it i don't
[3:00:43.800 --> 3:00:49.560]  i don't think they will tom in new york you say uh got the johnson and johnson vaccine and got sick

[3:00:54.920 --> 3:01:00.680]  and honestly it was because of uh you know i heard trump talking it up and and actually hearing all
[3:01:00.680 --> 3:01:06.120]  the the bad about the johnson and johnson from the medical authorities and how it could cause blood
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:10.280]  clots and stuff i thought well this must be the good one because they're trying to push on all
[3:01:10.280 --> 3:01:15.160]  these Pfizer two-shot and aderna two-shot exactly i thought the same thing i even said on a roll
[3:01:15.160 --> 3:01:20.360]  maybe maybe this one is it back as they're attacking it right and it's a viral vector versus
[3:01:20.360 --> 3:01:25.880]  the mrna and then and that's what i was really uh that's what really got my attention it's one
[3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:33.000]  shot viral vector but i did get sick the next day like very drowned out down not nothing too bad but
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:38.680]  um it definitely i and i and i kicked myself because i just started listening to you like

[3:02:32.920 --> 3:02:37.880]  york okay let me bring up jeryl salente who's been best selling author for 30 something years
[3:02:37.880 --> 3:02:42.760]  or longer than that uh one of the top trends people probably the top trends forecaster out there
[3:02:42.760 --> 3:02:47.000]  predicted basically everything that's now happened what do you make of them on the news saying we're
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:52.200]  gonna read your text messages in live time the democratic party tells big tech who to ban who
[3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:57.640]  not to ban i mean that's state-run media that's fascism the merger of uh the state corporations
[3:02:57.640 --> 3:03:03.560]  as you know and the republican leadership doing almost nothing uh and then all these deaths from
[3:03:03.560 --> 3:03:10.520]  the vaccine and then wanting to outlaw talking about it and it just to me jeryl did this headline
[3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:15.480]  zero heads did an excellent job showing all these homeland security former and current people in it
[3:03:15.480 --> 3:03:19.960]  saying we should outlaw the republican party uh we should so it's not just if you're
[3:03:19.960 --> 3:03:23.720]  you're questioning the election you're a criminal or if you question lockdowns you're a criminal
[3:03:23.720 --> 3:03:28.280]  that's in biden's new national security directive on terrorism they're literally because you always
[3:03:28.280 --> 3:03:32.040]  warned always warned they'll use the patriot act on us now they're saying the american
[3:03:32.040 --> 3:03:37.160]  people period and the republican party are terrorist and i've got all the videos and all
[3:03:37.160 --> 3:03:42.360]  the articles that are in here that's their new talking point dozens of them current
[3:03:42.360 --> 3:03:48.120]  former homeland security literally with the pentagon saying we're preparing for war with
[3:03:48.120 --> 3:03:54.200]  the american people what in the hell is going on this pentagon not our troops with this pentagon
[3:03:54.200 --> 3:04:00.120]  can't win vietnam it can't win korea it can't win any of these wars and now i guess i guess it can
[3:04:00.120 --> 3:04:04.360]  win a war against us with poison vaccines i guess that's what this is but i mean who are these people
[3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:09.320]  this isn't our military we have an endorsing marxism we have the new head of the blm
[3:04:10.200 --> 3:04:14.680]  bureau and management was the editor of earth's first that called for an overthrow of civilization
[3:04:14.680 --> 3:04:19.960]  and killing all the conservatives i mean this lady right here i mean i mean this is a literal
[3:04:19.960 --> 3:04:26.760]  takeover of out of control complete maniacs what would you call and again none of them are even
[3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:31.320]  military people they're all just weird academic communists but we all follow their orders to
[3:04:31.320 --> 3:04:35.960]  death how do we break out of the trance when these dirty commies are running everything and
[3:04:35.960 --> 3:04:40.280]  i know it's not a communist system it's really fascist but what in the world's going on here
[3:04:40.280 --> 3:04:50.040]  drill salante we had forecast over a decade ago censorship 2.0 if anybody wants to know when
[3:04:50.040 --> 3:05:03.720]  it accelerated it happened around 2018 when the tech giants banned info wars that was the beginning
[3:05:03.720 --> 3:05:11.800]  right there for everybody to see it the soul has been sucked out of america
[3:05:14.040 --> 3:05:22.440]  look at the headline today in the toilet paper of record the new york times right down the bottom

[3:07:14.600 --> 3:07:21.160]  today we live in a world where misinformation poses an imminent and insidious threat to our
[3:07:21.160 --> 3:07:28.760]  nation's health this little clown goes on to say that bogus claims have led people to reject vaccines

[3:13:57.480 --> 3:14:03.400]  he's concerned about what lies ahead as covet 19 infections are rising in every state news and
[3:14:03.400 --> 3:14:14.520]  people remain unvaccinated despite widely available jabs and the new contagious virus that's spreading
[3:14:14.520 --> 3:14:22.360]  that they don't say is less lethal anyway in an interview on cnn with the other
[3:14:22.360 --> 3:14:30.680]  cartoon news networks prostitutes yesterday dr murthy said nearly all coronavirus related
[3:14:30.680 --> 3:14:34.840]  deaths in the united states are among the tens of million people who have not been vaccinated
[3:14:34.840 --> 3:14:47.240]  huh covet related deaths deaths rose this is how they use propaganda deaths rose by 26
[3:14:47.240 --> 3:14:57.560]  percent week over week yeah there they are it look at that little clown jerk boris johnson

[3:15:04.600 --> 3:15:11.000]  yeah because when you put your dirty butt down there you don't want anybody else to get near

[3:15:19.080 --> 3:15:31.640]  percent week over week huh so the average is 250 a day 250 a day at a 332 million people
[3:15:31.640 --> 3:15:39.320]  oh and by the way nobody died in the flu last year or this year vanished went away hey how about
[3:15:39.320 --> 3:15:44.520]  all the unvaccinated people and didn't wear the mask how come they didn't get the flu oh because
[3:15:44.520 --> 3:15:50.280]  we lied made the flu the covid maybe no salenti that would be misinformation you have to swallow

[3:16:18.200 --> 3:16:29.000]  average 4409 but now they're putting out these little low lives spreading this crap

[3:16:36.440 --> 3:16:38.040]  and that's so many people are dying
[3:16:41.320 --> 3:16:43.240]  it's one after another
[3:16:43.240 --> 3:16:53.000]  but they're not fighting in america as i see it we have to unite to fight
[3:16:53.800 --> 3:17:01.880]  look what's going on in the uk today they relaxed a lot of the rules people have taken
[3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:07.560]  to the streets of london yet again to protest against coronavirus rules despite today being the
[3:17:07.560 --> 3:17:13.960]  long-awaited freedom day thousands of demonstrators gathered outside parliament this morning and
[3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:21.080]  over lunchtime but their message seemed this is how the prostitutes do it seem to be unclear
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:26.760]  people have regularly taken part in protests against london lockdowns and restrictions
[3:17:26.760 --> 3:17:32.200]  due to covid 19 over the past 16 months but now such arguments appear almost redundant
[3:17:32.200 --> 3:17:37.640]  as life could only let's let's have the crap that they write look at the people where do you see
[3:17:37.640 --> 3:17:44.040]  this in america where do you see that happening hey what went on in france over the weekend

[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:30.360]  We come back to tell you Alan what to do
[3:38:30.360 --> 3:38:59.360]  We come back to tell you Alan what to do
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:13.360]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Salente
[3:39:13.360 --> 3:39:19.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:39:19.360 --> 3:39:30.360]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show
[3:39:30.360 --> 3:39:50.360]  Again, when you have these clowns coming out telling us about misinformation, what we have to believe

[3:40:01.360 --> 3:40:10.360]  And that's what no one talks about

[3:40:40.360 --> 3:40:54.360]  That's incredible formula works together to promote calcium absorption, support the body's natural immune system, provide the necessary vitamin D for whole body support
[3:40:54.360 --> 3:41:03.360]  and vitamin D and K work together synergistically to maximize the benefits of both vitamins for your body and at such great savings
[3:41:03.360 --> 3:41:12.360]  It is the best way to get your nutraceutical vitamin D3 for less while supporting the info wars crew and what a crew it is

[3:41:21.360 --> 3:41:30.360]  And again, what a great crew they are, what great work they do, how they fight for freedom and truth and peace and justice
[3:41:30.360 --> 3:41:37.360]  And that's what we're doing and of course we have the Trends Journal magazine last week was 160 pages, no ads
[3:41:37.360 --> 3:41:43.360]  Oh I can't read 160, you read what you want, it's a magazine, you have to read everything, you read what you're interested in
[3:41:43.360 --> 3:41:51.360]  Because we're looking at this thing and it's going down, hey do you see the markets today? No news to Trends Journal subscribers
[3:41:51.360 --> 3:42:10.360]  It's going down over 800 points, West Texas intermediate down over 8%, Brent crew down over 7%, Copper all the precious metals way, way, way, way down
[3:42:10.360 --> 3:42:18.360]  Crypto's going down, the reality is hitting us
[3:42:18.360 --> 3:42:31.360]  Even when they started the COVID war back in winter of 2020, all the little gutless low life people said, oh it'll come back, it'll come back, it's not coming back
[3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:41.360]  It's dead out here at night, go down to city in New York, smokey, smokey OML, plays down in Brooklyn
[3:42:41.360 --> 3:42:47.360]  You know the time they finished playing at night now, 10.30 at night, that's when you used to go out
[3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:51.360]  And now as a young guy we still go out to one o'clock in the morning
[3:42:51.360 --> 3:42:55.360]  Anyway, it's not coming back
[3:42:55.360 --> 3:43:05.360]  Billionaire investor Bill Ackerman said Monday today that the spread of the Delta variant doesn't pose significant threat to the economic reopening
[3:43:05.360 --> 3:43:10.360]  And here's what he goes on to say, I'm reading this because this guy, this is quote
[3:43:10.360 --> 3:43:21.360]  I hope what it does is that it motivates anyone who doesn't get the vaccine to get the vaccine
[3:43:21.360 --> 3:43:26.360]  Who the hell are you?
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:31.360]  Operation warp speed warped head
[3:43:31.360 --> 3:43:37.360]  Has not met with approval by the FDA, billionaire
[3:43:37.360 --> 3:43:41.360]  Member of the club
[3:43:41.360 --> 3:43:44.360]  And all they're doing is selling fear
[3:43:44.360 --> 3:43:53.360]  You had Yellen, the Howard Treasury secretary coming out this past weekend
[3:43:53.360 --> 3:44:00.360]  Telling people to get the shot, get the shot
[3:44:00.360 --> 3:44:03.360]  One after another
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:10.360]  And they're talking about the cases going up, even though we know the cases are inaccurate
[3:44:10.360 --> 3:44:14.360]  And it's not only the United States
[3:44:14.360 --> 3:44:23.360]  Sydney Titans lockdown as Australia's COVID-19 case is rise
[3:44:23.360 --> 3:44:26.360]  Authorities, that's a curse word
[3:44:26.360 --> 3:44:33.360]  South Wales state of which Sydney is the capital, banned hundreds of thousands of people in the city's western suburb
[3:44:33.360 --> 3:44:40.360]  The worst affected area, leaving their, for they can't leave their immediate neighborhoods for work
[3:44:40.360 --> 3:44:44.360]  They recorded 111 new cases
[3:44:44.360 --> 3:44:49.360]  Huh, how many people died?
[3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:55.360]  One
[3:44:55.360 --> 3:45:01.360]  One person dead
[3:45:01.360 --> 3:45:07.360]  It's one, here, this is today, this is right out of the news from Australia
[3:45:07.360 --> 3:45:10.360]  Same place
[3:45:10.360 --> 3:45:17.360]  North South Wales held on Monday afternoon reported the death of a woman in her 50s
[3:45:17.360 --> 3:45:20.360]  Woman found dead in home
[3:45:20.360 --> 3:45:22.360]  One person died
[3:45:22.360 --> 3:45:28.360]  What was the pre-existing comorbidities?
[3:45:28.360 --> 3:45:31.360]  We won't talk about that
[3:45:31.360 --> 3:45:36.360]  You should see this woman who's the premier over here, shooting a mouth off
[3:45:36.360 --> 3:45:41.360]  It's a freak show
[3:45:41.360 --> 3:45:43.360]  Huh
[3:45:43.360 --> 3:45:50.360]  The premier miss, been jerking around or been jerking all around, whatever off
[3:45:50.360 --> 3:45:56.360]  She said, huh, there are decisions that affect the lives and livelihoods
[3:45:56.360 --> 3:45:59.360]  There are decisions that affect millions of people
[3:45:59.360 --> 3:46:06.360]  But my job and the government is to keep people safe to reduce transmission, reduce risk
[3:46:06.360 --> 3:46:10.360]  So she's putting on this mask
[3:46:10.360 --> 3:46:14.360]  Look at this, alright?
[3:46:14.360 --> 3:46:17.360]  Look at that freak with that freak show
[3:46:17.360 --> 3:46:21.360]  Here's the mask, moron
[3:46:21.360 --> 3:46:28.360]  Here's the mask, imbecile, arrogant little
[3:46:28.360 --> 3:46:32.360]  I can't use the word
[3:46:32.360 --> 3:46:37.360]  Here's the mask, same mask
[3:46:37.360 --> 3:46:41.360]  Same mask
[3:46:41.360 --> 3:46:45.360]  Hope you don't get the infection
[3:46:45.360 --> 3:46:47.360]  Right on the box
[3:46:47.360 --> 3:46:52.360]  These masks do not eliminate exposure to the risk of any disease or infection
[3:46:52.360 --> 3:46:57.360]  But we're going to shove them down your throat and make you wear them
[3:46:57.360 --> 3:47:08.360]  913 or 912 people died in all of Australia over the course of a year and a half
[3:47:08.360 --> 3:47:15.360]  Face masks are laced with cancer-causing toxic chemicals and they don't work according to the studies
[3:47:15.360 --> 3:47:20.360]  And even that little freaky-lined piece of scum-fouchy said it
[3:47:20.360 --> 3:47:24.360]  On CBS, back in March 2020
[3:47:24.360 --> 3:47:29.360]  And in the email to Obama's former Health and Human Services Director
[3:47:29.360 --> 3:47:32.360]  Don't wear one when you go to the airport, they're not effective
[3:47:32.360 --> 3:47:44.360]  Israel launches happy badge for weddings and large parties
[3:47:44.360 --> 3:47:53.360]  Here's Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen screamed out that the U.S. could see lockdowns return to parts of the country
[3:47:53.360 --> 3:47:59.360]  So I mean, we have solid rates of vaccination in many parts of the country
[3:47:59.360 --> 3:48:05.360]  But certainly, it's something that could happen in areas where the vaccination rates are low
[3:48:05.360 --> 3:48:11.360]  So it's critically important that we maintain progress on vaccinating more Americans
[3:48:11.360 --> 3:48:14.360]  A Treasury Secretary
[3:48:14.360 --> 3:48:19.360]  Who the hell are you to say what we should be doing?
[3:48:19.360 --> 3:48:25.360]  You're a member of the Bankster Gang, they've taken over our country right in front of our eyes
[3:48:25.360 --> 3:48:29.360]  She came from the Federal Reserve and now is running out at Treasury
[3:48:29.360 --> 3:48:33.360]  Hey, I would say that is misinformation
[3:48:33.360 --> 3:48:38.360]  Yeah, miss Yellen's, miss information
[3:48:38.360 --> 3:48:41.360]  The markets, stay tuned to what happens
[3:48:41.360 --> 3:48:46.360]  The magazine and tomorrow's issues coming out tomorrow, this week's issues coming out tomorrow
[3:48:46.360 --> 3:48:49.360]  This thing's going down, bigot's going down hard
[3:48:49.360 --> 3:48:53.360]  These lockdowns are destroying the world, France, lockdown
[3:48:53.360 --> 3:48:56.360]  Australia, they're locking down, locking down
[3:48:56.360 --> 3:48:59.360]  And now the Delta variant is going to get you
[3:48:59.360 --> 3:49:02.360]  And the moron, imbeciles, jerks in L.A.
[3:49:02.360 --> 3:49:04.360]  They got you wearing a mask again
[3:49:04.360 --> 3:49:06.360]  And most of the people are masked up
[3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:10.360]  It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority
[3:49:10.360 --> 3:49:13.360]  King-on-setting brush size of freedom in the minds of men
[3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:16.360]  And the minds of men and women of info wars
[3:49:16.360 --> 3:49:19.360]  We are the speakers of freedom
[3:49:19.360 --> 3:49:24.360]  We were the first magazine to call this a fraud, and the frauds are right in front of you
[3:49:24.360 --> 3:49:26.360]  So do you care to support info wars?
[3:49:26.360 --> 3:49:29.360]  Go to TrendsJournal.com for the Trends Journal
[3:49:29.360 --> 3:49:31.360]  And we see you next week
[3:49:31.360 --> 3:49:32.360]  Stay tuned for the truth
[3:49:32.360 --> 3:49:50.360]  Here comes Alex and the gang
