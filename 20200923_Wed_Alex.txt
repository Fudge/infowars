[00:00.000 --> 00:05.520]  Our chaotic political climate has levied a lopsided justice system to the point that
[00:05.520 --> 00:11.080]  Jake Gardner, a Nebraska bar owner, chose to commit suicide rather than face prison
[00:11.080 --> 00:13.520]  for defending his life, liberty and property.
[00:13.520 --> 00:18.120]  Share the news of his death today at his own hand.
[00:18.120 --> 00:23.000]  38-year-old Jacob Gardner, the bar owner charged in the killing of 22-year-old James
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.800]  Scurlock, was found dead on Sunday afternoon in front of a medical clinic in Hillsborough,
[00:27.800 --> 00:30.360]  Oregon, according to the Hillsborough Police Department.
[00:30.360 --> 00:34.160]  Dornan spent much of the news conference defending Gardner.
[00:34.160 --> 00:39.760]  And I want to make it very clear that this was a clear case of self-defense.
[00:39.760 --> 00:43.700]  Dornan says on the night of the shooting, Gardner believed he was in a war zone when
[00:43.700 --> 00:46.080]  protests erupted in downtown.
[00:46.080 --> 00:51.320]  A result of what Dornan said was PTSD and traumatic brain injuries Gardner suffered
[00:51.320 --> 00:53.520]  after serving in Iraq.
[00:53.520 --> 00:59.360]  He did not know when he was sitting at the Omaha Police Department for over 24 hours
[00:59.360 --> 01:04.360]  exactly what had happened to Mr. Scurlock.
[01:04.360 --> 01:06.120]  And he was devastated by it.
[01:06.120 --> 01:11.880]  As was reported by Cassandra Fairbanks at Gateway Pundit, on May 30, the 38-year-old
[01:11.880 --> 01:18.240]  veteran confronted a group of rioters outside one of the bars he owns in Omaha and was knocked
[01:18.240 --> 01:19.240]  to the ground.
[01:19.240 --> 01:24.000]  From there, he fired two warning shots and tried to get to his feet, prosecutors said.
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.400]  As he did, Gardner got into a fight with one man, James Scurlock, aged 22.
[01:29.400 --> 01:36.960]  The two scuffled before Gardner fired a shot that killed him, according to Yahoo News.
[01:36.960 --> 01:42.920]  Donald Klein, the Douglas County attorney, determined that Gardner had acted in self-defense
[01:42.920 --> 01:44.880]  and declined to bring charges.
[01:44.880 --> 01:49.160]  He felt that I felt that my life was a jeopardy or at least I was in jeopardy of getting serious
[01:49.160 --> 01:53.600]  bodily injury, getting pummeled, or getting choked out with this guy on top of me.
[01:53.600 --> 01:57.360]  And I asked the guy to get off me and he wouldn't get off me.
[01:57.360 --> 02:03.480]  Immediately after, pressure from BLM protesters and local media allowed a false narrative to
[02:03.480 --> 02:06.800]  erupt branding Gardner a racist homophobe.
[02:06.800 --> 02:10.520]  The mob then marched to District Attorney Klein's house.
[02:10.520 --> 02:13.800]  Things then rapidly began to change.
[02:13.800 --> 02:18.680]  Protesters made their way to Don Klein's neighborhood today demanding justice for James Scurlock.
[02:18.680 --> 02:22.460]  James Scurlock was the unarmed 22-year-old black man shot and killed during the George
[02:22.460 --> 02:25.640]  Floyd protests in Omaha back on May 30th.
[02:25.640 --> 02:31.840]  We want all of testimonies to be honored and listened to and we want you to stop the grand
[02:31.840 --> 02:34.000]  jury process and prosecute now.
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.200]  He's a known racist, he's a known homophobic, he's a known bigot, this is not the first
[02:38.200 --> 02:42.400]  time it's happened, he's been in the news several times and I hope he's held accountable
[02:42.400 --> 02:43.400]  for what he's done.
[02:43.400 --> 02:45.160]  It's not okay, it's not acceptable.
[02:45.160 --> 02:50.360]  Protesters go fund me page to raise money for his defense was deleted by the platform.
[02:50.360 --> 02:56.040]  Douglas County District Court Judge Shelly Stratman then appointed a special counsel,
[02:56.040 --> 03:00.840]  Frederick Franklin, an assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Omaha to
[03:00.840 --> 03:05.160]  handle the case, though they said they expected the same outcome.
[03:05.160 --> 03:10.200]  Instead, Franklin bowed to the pressure, dug up evidence and filed a manslaughter charge
[03:10.200 --> 03:15.600]  in a charge of making terrorist threats that Franklin had claimed was linked to a verbal
[03:15.600 --> 03:18.880]  confrontation that Gardner had with Skirlock.
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.040]  This is KMTV 3 News Now, live at 6.
[03:23.040 --> 03:30.680]  I expected to ultimately end up at the conclusion of their decision making to stand in front
[03:30.680 --> 03:36.240]  of the press and say the same thing that Don Klein said, which was that the shooting
[03:36.240 --> 03:38.640]  was justifiable self-defense.
[03:38.640 --> 03:46.960]  That was my initial reaction, but I can tell you that there is evidence that undermines
[03:46.960 --> 03:55.680]  that and again that evidence comes primarily from Jake Gardner himself.
[03:55.680 --> 04:00.600]  And Omaha Mayor Gene Souther sent out a statement saying I ask everyone to accept the grand jury's
[04:00.600 --> 04:05.040]  decision and respect the confidentiality of the grand jury process.
[04:05.040 --> 04:08.040]  The case against Jake Gardner will now move to trial.
[04:08.040 --> 04:14.320]  This trial was carried out by social media, rioters and local television, another casualty
[04:14.320 --> 04:19.720]  to the mob unleashing their vengeance on any American standing in the way of the Marxist
[04:19.720 --> 04:20.720]  takeover of America.
[04:20.720 --> 04:23.000]  So can you just tell us your name and where you're from, sir?
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.200]  My name is Jake Gardner, I'm from Omaha, Nebraska.
[04:26.200 --> 04:28.520]  And then Jake, what brings you to D.C.?
[04:28.520 --> 04:29.520]  I'm here for the inauguration.
[04:29.520 --> 04:31.960]  Okay, I understand you're a volunteer for the Trump campaign.
[04:31.960 --> 04:37.600]  Yeah, I was a volunteer for the Trump campaign in Nebraska, California and Michigan.
[04:37.600 --> 04:41.200]  And what do you think about what's going on here today with the Women's March?
[04:41.200 --> 04:46.160]  You know, these people just want to be heard and it's a very appropriate venue, a very
[04:46.160 --> 04:48.560]  appropriate weekend with all eyes on them.
[04:48.560 --> 04:51.040]  So I mean, it is what it is.
[04:51.040 --> 04:55.040]  I think a lot of their criticisms are, they're going to be proven wrong.
[04:55.040 --> 04:56.040]  We'll be right back.
[04:56.040 --> 04:57.040]  Stay with us.
[04:57.040 --> 05:00.520]  It is a live transmission.
[05:00.520 --> 05:03.880]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[05:03.880 --> 05:05.880]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[05:05.880 --> 05:08.640]  Is your city too safe?
[05:08.640 --> 05:11.560]  Well, not anymore.
[05:11.560 --> 05:14.320]  Introducing Democrats.
[05:14.320 --> 05:19.800]  Politicians so incompetent they'll build your neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant
[05:19.800 --> 05:22.680]  violence and even homelessness.
[05:22.680 --> 05:27.720]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity.
[05:27.720 --> 05:29.920]  No more pesky law and order.
[05:29.920 --> 05:34.080]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[05:34.080 --> 05:38.960]  Only vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[05:38.960 --> 05:44.920]  Plug weight, vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud,
[05:44.920 --> 05:48.880]  cancel culture, taxes and more taxes.
[05:48.880 --> 06:07.840]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[06:07.840 --> 06:14.240]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[06:14.240 --> 06:21.840]  front lines of the Info War, 40 days, 40 days, 40 days until the election.
[06:21.840 --> 06:25.720]  It is Wednesday, September 23rd and your host Alex Jones.
[06:25.720 --> 06:28.800]  There's so much incredible news breaking on so many fronts.
[06:28.800 --> 06:33.360]  But first, I thought I'd air this intro piece that we've been airing for about five, six
[06:33.360 --> 06:39.480]  years that deals with dehumanization because now there's a new phenomenon on TikTok with
[06:39.480 --> 06:44.440]  millions of views per video, many of them, of Democrats celebrating the murder of their
[06:44.440 --> 06:49.600]  children as an act of their power and their selfishness, where they then imply that they're
[06:49.600 --> 06:54.080]  going to kill their three, four, five, six year old children as well.
[06:54.080 --> 06:57.920]  This is a group of psychotic demons.
[06:57.920 --> 07:01.600]  Here is the report from five, six years ago now coming true and we'll go right to that
[07:01.600 --> 07:11.800]  new shocking development and you'll see the videos for yourself.
[07:11.800 --> 07:38.000]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals
[07:38.000 --> 07:39.000]  in the UK.
[07:39.000 --> 08:08.240]  To speed things up, it is made public in order media and to provide
[08:08.240 --> 08:10.680]  before in the flavoring, but we already know.
[08:10.680 --> 08:12.720]  So enjoy the flavor.
[08:12.720 --> 08:14.080]  We're gonna get the real solution,
[08:14.080 --> 08:16.080]  which is gonna be a combination of death panels
[08:16.080 --> 08:17.280]  and sales taxes.
[08:17.280 --> 08:19.240]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[08:19.240 --> 08:21.160]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[08:21.160 --> 08:22.480]  I'm for regular suicide.
[08:22.480 --> 08:24.280]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[08:24.280 --> 08:26.840]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months
[08:26.840 --> 08:29.760]  of life for that patient, would it be better
[08:29.760 --> 08:32.840]  not to lay off those 10 teachers
[08:32.840 --> 08:35.760]  and to make that credit for medical costs?
[08:35.760 --> 08:38.280]  But that's called the death panel,
[08:38.280 --> 08:40.080]  and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[08:40.080 --> 08:43.320]  They told me to say that they were sorry,
[08:44.160 --> 08:46.760]  but that you had become unreliable.
[08:47.760 --> 08:48.600]  Yeah.
[08:54.600 --> 08:57.200]  Is this the kind of society that you wanna live in?
[08:57.200 --> 09:00.040]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children
[09:00.040 --> 09:02.080]  will do it to its senior citizens.
[09:02.080 --> 09:04.640]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[09:04.640 --> 09:08.000]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police,
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.200]  on its army, on its prison guards,
[09:10.200 --> 09:12.080]  on the quizlings and the collaborators
[09:12.080 --> 09:14.000]  who make that possible.
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.240]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[09:17.240 --> 09:19.360]  The scoops are on their way.
[09:19.360 --> 09:21.880]  The scoops are on their way.
[09:21.880 --> 09:25.080]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[09:25.080 --> 09:26.440]  You will find out why
[09:26.440 --> 09:28.320]  Soylent Green means life.
[09:28.320 --> 09:31.840]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[09:31.840 --> 09:33.640]  We gotta stop them.
[09:33.640 --> 09:37.640]  The next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle for food.
[09:37.640 --> 09:39.640]  You gotta tell them.
[09:43.640 --> 09:47.640]  Next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle for food.
[09:47.640 --> 09:49.640]  You gotta tell them.
[09:57.640 --> 09:59.640]  And now in Europe,
[09:59.640 --> 10:01.640]  and in places like Washington State
[10:01.640 --> 10:03.640]  where the level is still controlled,
[10:03.640 --> 10:05.640]  they take people's dead bodies and grind it
[10:05.640 --> 10:08.640]  into fertilizer to plant on the crops.
[10:08.640 --> 10:10.640]  All of this is to teach you
[10:10.640 --> 10:13.640]  that you have absolutely no value.
[10:13.640 --> 10:15.640]  And so you won't stand up for your neighbors.
[10:15.640 --> 10:17.640]  They won't stand up for you.
[10:17.640 --> 10:19.640]  They can turn your emotions
[10:19.640 --> 10:22.640]  and your so-called morality on like a light switch.
[10:22.640 --> 10:26.640]  Oh, George Soros' Black Lives Matter is moral,
[10:26.640 --> 10:29.640]  but if you're marching for
[10:29.640 --> 10:33.640]  better VA benefits, you're not allowed to.
[10:33.640 --> 10:35.640]  It's all very, very simple.
[10:35.640 --> 10:37.640]  This is total tyranny.
[10:37.640 --> 10:41.640]  And tyranny's not supposed to be logical.
[10:41.640 --> 10:44.640]  It's about power and control.
[10:44.640 --> 10:46.640]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live
[10:46.640 --> 10:49.640]  September 23rd, Wednesday edition.
[10:49.640 --> 10:52.640]  I do want to open the phones up quite a bit today.
[10:52.640 --> 10:54.640]  I do want to cover the waterfront,
[10:54.640 --> 10:58.640]  but I was looking at the news we had here
[10:58.640 --> 11:02.640]  in front of us,
[11:02.640 --> 11:06.640]  and I was thinking
[11:06.640 --> 11:09.640]  about what's unfolding,
[11:09.640 --> 11:12.640]  and there was a theme without me even looking
[11:12.640 --> 11:15.640]  that just came out, and that's Democrats
[11:15.640 --> 11:18.640]  and leftists around the world celebrating abortion
[11:18.640 --> 11:24.640]  and talking about how much they love
[11:24.640 --> 11:27.640]  to kill children and how it's about power.
[11:27.640 --> 11:29.640]  And then there's new stuff coming out with the left
[11:29.640 --> 11:32.640]  with their fetishizing things that I only want to say on air.
[11:32.640 --> 11:35.640]  It's beyond pedophilia.
[11:35.640 --> 11:37.640]  It's child sacrifice.
[11:37.640 --> 11:42.640]  And I happened to run into this again
[11:42.640 --> 11:45.640]  going on a rabbit trail the other day on Paul Watson's Twitter,
[11:45.640 --> 11:47.640]  and I meant to come in and cover it,
[11:47.640 --> 11:50.640]  and then once I got here, I just couldn't make myself do it.
[11:50.640 --> 11:51.640]  But let's just do this.
[11:51.640 --> 11:53.640]  Let's hear this little four-minute compilation
[11:53.640 --> 11:55.640]  of some of the things they've said in the past
[11:55.640 --> 11:57.640]  in the next segment, but that's who our enemies are.
[11:57.640 --> 11:59.640]  Here it is.
[11:59.640 --> 12:02.640]  Our main story tonight concerns breast implants.
[12:02.640 --> 12:04.640]  Some are against them.
[12:04.640 --> 12:06.640]  Others believe they're fine in rare cases,
[12:06.640 --> 12:08.640]  and many believe you should be able to get them
[12:08.640 --> 12:10.640]  whenever the f*** you want.
[12:10.640 --> 12:12.640]  Sorry, did I say breast implants?
[12:12.640 --> 12:14.640]  I meant abortions.
[12:14.640 --> 12:18.640]  Tonight's main topic concerns abortion.
[12:18.640 --> 12:20.640]  So tonight, in honor of America,
[12:20.640 --> 12:22.640]  I'd like to do a salute to abortion
[12:22.640 --> 12:25.640]  and break 10 annuals salute to abortions.
[12:25.640 --> 12:29.640]  Get out of my behind.
[12:29.640 --> 12:31.640]  Get out of my vagina.
[12:31.640 --> 12:32.640]  Get out.
[12:32.640 --> 12:34.640]  It's a woman's body, and she should not be forced
[12:34.640 --> 12:36.640]  to carry anything inside of it.
[12:36.640 --> 12:38.640]  You wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm.
[12:38.640 --> 12:39.640]  That has a heartbeat.
[12:39.640 --> 12:41.640]  So you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm?
[12:41.640 --> 12:43.640]  A fetus is a parasite, sweetie.
[12:43.640 --> 12:45.640]  That is not what a fetus looks like, okay?
[12:45.640 --> 12:47.640]  It's a flip of cells at 12 weeks.
[12:47.640 --> 12:49.640]  You think that it is the white man's duty
[12:49.640 --> 12:51.640]  to fix everybody's problems, right?
[12:51.640 --> 12:53.640]  How many did you adopt?
[12:53.640 --> 12:55.640]  How many did I adopt? I killed my kids.
[12:55.640 --> 12:57.640]  Well, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[12:57.640 --> 12:58.640]  I love it.
[12:58.640 --> 12:59.640]  You love it, huh?
[12:59.640 --> 13:00.640]  Yeah, I do.
[13:00.640 --> 13:02.640]  Okay, I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[13:02.640 --> 13:03.640]  Oh, I'd ever go to Christ.
[13:03.640 --> 13:04.640]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[13:04.640 --> 13:05.640]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[13:05.640 --> 13:07.640]  A fertilized egg is a human being.
[13:07.640 --> 13:08.640]  Yeah.
[13:08.640 --> 13:10.640]  A fertilized egg is a human being.
[13:10.640 --> 13:11.640]  You're a pig.
[13:11.640 --> 13:12.640]  You guys, I don't want to come, baby.
[13:12.640 --> 13:13.640]  Oh, you killed them.
[13:13.640 --> 13:16.640]  You let them live so they can starve to death.
[13:16.640 --> 13:18.640]  Why'd you spit at us?
[13:18.640 --> 13:20.640]  I don't agree with you.
[13:20.640 --> 13:23.640]  No uterus, no right to talk about it.
[13:23.640 --> 13:24.640]  Understand me, motherfucker?
[13:24.640 --> 13:27.640]  In the ninth month, you can take the baby
[13:27.640 --> 13:31.640]  and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother
[13:31.640 --> 13:34.640]  just prior to the birth of the baby.
[13:34.640 --> 13:37.640]  Now, you can say that that's okay,
[13:37.640 --> 13:39.640]  and Hillary can say that that's okay,
[13:39.640 --> 13:41.640]  but it's not okay with me.
[13:41.640 --> 13:43.640]  Well, that is not what happens in these cases,
[13:43.640 --> 13:46.640]  and using that kind of scare rhetoric
[13:46.640 --> 13:48.640]  is just terribly unfortunate.
[13:48.640 --> 13:50.640]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lit up
[13:50.640 --> 13:53.640]  the One World Trade Center's Spire in Pink
[13:53.640 --> 13:55.640]  to celebrate his erotical expansion
[13:55.640 --> 13:57.640]  of abortion in New York.
[13:57.640 --> 13:58.640]  State lawmakers approved a law
[13:58.640 --> 14:00.640]  permitting abortion in the state
[14:00.640 --> 14:03.640]  for any reason until the 24th week of pregnancy
[14:03.640 --> 14:05.640]  and then up until birth.
[14:05.640 --> 14:06.640]  If a mother is in labor,
[14:06.640 --> 14:09.640]  I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[14:09.640 --> 14:11.640]  The infant would be delivered.
[14:11.640 --> 14:13.640]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[14:13.640 --> 14:15.640]  The infant would be resuscitated
[14:15.640 --> 14:18.640]  if that's what the mother and the family desired,
[14:18.640 --> 14:20.640]  and then a discussion would ensue
[14:20.640 --> 14:22.640]  between the physicians and the mother.
[14:22.640 --> 14:24.640]  There was a question over here.
[14:24.640 --> 14:25.640]  Yes.
[14:25.640 --> 14:28.640]  Are you for third trimester abortions?
[14:28.640 --> 14:30.640]  My answer to you is that that should be
[14:30.640 --> 14:32.640]  a decision that the woman makes.
[14:34.640 --> 14:36.640]  There's scientific consensus
[14:36.640 --> 14:39.640]  that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[14:39.640 --> 14:41.640]  Is it okay to still have children?
[14:41.640 --> 14:43.640]  How do you justify the decision
[14:43.640 --> 14:45.640]  to allow Planned Parenthood
[14:45.640 --> 14:47.640]  to rent in this city for free?
[14:47.640 --> 14:49.640]  That's your time.
[14:49.640 --> 14:50.640]  Next speaker.
[14:50.640 --> 14:52.640]  There's a new video out on inforwars.com
[14:52.640 --> 14:56.640]  of two partial birth abortions,
[14:56.640 --> 14:58.640]  eight and a half month old babies.
[14:58.640 --> 15:01.640]  And it makes you want to kill people.
[15:01.640 --> 15:04.640]  I'm going to just be honest with you right now.
[15:04.640 --> 15:07.640]  My guts, my spirit sees a baby
[15:07.640 --> 15:10.640]  who got killed and its brain sucked out
[15:10.640 --> 15:13.640]  by some asshole, and then they make a joke out of it.
[15:13.640 --> 15:17.640]  These are abortion doctors with third trimester babies
[15:17.640 --> 15:19.640]  that were about to be born.
[15:19.640 --> 15:21.640]  The filing them, they can joke about them
[15:21.640 --> 15:22.640]  that they're having a fight.
[15:22.640 --> 15:24.640]  They're playing with dead babies
[15:24.640 --> 15:28.640]  in a little medical pan,
[15:28.640 --> 15:31.640]  and it was pretty shocking through some stuff to see
[15:31.640 --> 15:34.640]  and just a total lack of regard for humanity.
[15:34.640 --> 15:36.640]  That's just absolutely amazing.
[15:36.640 --> 15:40.640]  We're going to have Abby Johnson.
[15:40.640 --> 15:41.640]  I'm sorry.
[15:41.640 --> 15:45.640]  God bless abortions and God bless America!
[15:45.640 --> 15:50.640]  Don't knock it till you try it.
[15:50.640 --> 15:53.640]  And when you do try it, really knock it.
[15:53.640 --> 15:57.640]  You know, you got to get that baby out of there.
[15:57.640 --> 15:59.640]  If you look at the top tech billionaires
[15:59.640 --> 16:01.640]  and the big banks that finance and control them,
[16:01.640 --> 16:03.640]  to a man and to a woman,
[16:03.640 --> 16:05.640]  they believe there's too many people on the earth
[16:05.640 --> 16:07.640]  and they constantly whine about
[16:07.640 --> 16:09.640]  when they want to go to a mountain top or a national park,
[16:09.640 --> 16:12.640]  they have to look at us, the common people.
[16:12.640 --> 16:14.640]  They have to look at the proletariat,
[16:14.640 --> 16:15.640]  they have to look at the scum.
[16:15.640 --> 16:17.640]  That's why they love the lockdown,
[16:17.640 --> 16:18.640]  putting muzzles on us.
[16:18.640 --> 16:20.640]  That gives them a big thrill,
[16:20.640 --> 16:22.640]  controlling where we can go, what we can do.
[16:22.640 --> 16:24.640]  Bankrupting Main Street,
[16:24.640 --> 16:25.640]  bankrupting small towns,
[16:25.640 --> 16:28.640]  all of it is a vertical integration, consolidation,
[16:28.640 --> 16:31.640]  so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender,
[16:31.640 --> 16:35.640]  which is taking sterilant vaccines day one.
[16:35.640 --> 16:37.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over,
[16:37.640 --> 16:39.640]  playtime's over,
[16:39.640 --> 16:41.640]  they used all the entertainment and garbage
[16:41.640 --> 16:42.640]  to put us into a trance,
[16:42.640 --> 16:44.640]  and now the spider's moving in for the kill.
[16:44.640 --> 16:46.640]  You know this, I know this,
[16:46.640 --> 16:47.640]  it's all out in the open.
[16:47.640 --> 16:49.640]  The question is, what are we going to do about it?
[16:49.640 --> 16:51.640]  Well, the first thing is identify the enemy.
[16:51.640 --> 16:53.640]  Identify the enemy, identify the enemy,
[16:53.640 --> 16:56.640]  identify your enemy now.
[16:57.640 --> 16:59.640]  I don't want to be negative
[16:59.640 --> 17:01.640]  about the prospects of the election,
[17:01.640 --> 17:03.640]  but I need to be honest with everybody.
[17:03.640 --> 17:06.640]  The Democrats and their deep-state controllers,
[17:06.640 --> 17:07.640]  Communist Chinese,
[17:07.640 --> 17:09.640]  have come out and said they're going to contest the election.
[17:09.640 --> 17:11.640]  They know that Trump's going to win a landslide.
[17:11.640 --> 17:14.640]  And the destabilization that that's going to cause
[17:14.640 --> 17:17.640]  is going to further destroy the markets and the economy.
[17:17.640 --> 17:18.640]  And going into the future,
[17:18.640 --> 17:21.640]  even if Trump is able to prove that he's won the election,
[17:21.640 --> 17:25.640]  the Democrats have said they're going to break away
[17:25.640 --> 17:27.640]  politically and culturally
[17:27.640 --> 17:29.640]  into the blue states and blue cities
[17:29.640 --> 17:32.640]  and basically use that as a pretext of sabotage
[17:32.640 --> 17:34.640]  the Republic even more.
[17:34.640 --> 17:37.640]  So, until this cancer is rooted out,
[17:37.640 --> 17:40.640]  until these criminals that work with foreign governments
[17:40.640 --> 17:42.640]  that are trying to basically destroy the country
[17:42.640 --> 17:44.640]  are punished and removed,
[17:44.640 --> 17:46.640]  it's just going to continue to happen.
[17:46.640 --> 17:48.640]  And so that's the big problem here.
[17:48.640 --> 17:51.640]  That is that we have systemic dug-in corruption
[17:51.640 --> 17:57.640]  by people that hate the country's very existence.
[18:22.640 --> 18:25.640]  Findings and the rest of it once going to end up happening.
[18:25.640 --> 18:26.640]  The verdict.
[18:26.640 --> 18:29.640]  On the SWAT team rating on bad,
[18:29.640 --> 18:31.640]  police didn't want to kill that EMT.
[18:31.640 --> 18:34.640]  They didn't know she was shacking up with the bad guy.
[18:34.640 --> 18:36.640]  And when the police are on the wrong,
[18:36.640 --> 18:37.640]  they're on the wrong,
[18:37.640 --> 18:39.640]  but why can't you get black folks or white folks
[18:39.640 --> 18:43.640]  to care about the millions of aborted babies every year?
[18:43.640 --> 18:44.640]  The babies that keep alive,
[18:44.640 --> 18:48.640]  that they then harvest their organs and things like that.
[18:48.640 --> 18:53.640]  No. We're told when we're allowed to get upset.
[18:53.640 --> 18:56.640]  We're told the narrative the media wants us to have.
[18:56.640 --> 19:00.640]  Here's another great example of that.
[19:00.640 --> 19:02.640]  Facebook threatens to delete Mark Dice
[19:02.640 --> 19:07.640]  over a clip of Kyle Rittenhouse offering medical aid to protesters.
[19:07.640 --> 19:08.640]  He put this out over a month ago.
[19:08.640 --> 19:10.640]  We played it as well.
[19:10.640 --> 19:14.640]  It's Rittenhouse out there giving aid to looters that were hurt,
[19:14.640 --> 19:18.640]  not by him. It was before the shooting.
[19:18.640 --> 19:19.640]  He has a medical kit there,
[19:19.640 --> 19:22.640]  and that's just the truth of what happened.
[19:22.640 --> 19:25.640]  And Facebook has a policy saying we say he's a mass murder.
[19:25.640 --> 19:28.640]  No judge, no jury. Big tech is God.
[19:28.640 --> 19:31.640]  Zuckerberg's even setting up his own tribunals now.
[19:31.640 --> 19:34.640]  I'm not joking. It will judge what's what.
[19:34.640 --> 19:39.640]  And so they wouldn't have let Rittenhouse's lawyer have statements on Twitter or Facebook.
[19:39.640 --> 19:42.640]  They're trying to block the new 10-minute Rittenhouse documentary,
[19:42.640 --> 19:45.640]  or 11-minute documentary that his lawyer has just put out.
[19:45.640 --> 19:47.640]  It's on infowars.com.
[19:47.640 --> 19:54.640]  So it's just an amazing level of control.
[19:54.640 --> 19:56.640]  And now when crime statistics come out,
[19:56.640 --> 19:59.640]  showing on average 14, the Attorney General said 12.
[19:59.640 --> 20:00.640]  It's the number I saw is 14.
[20:00.640 --> 20:04.640]  It's 14 on average black men that are wrongly killed by police each year.
[20:04.640 --> 20:06.640]  They're bad cops. They make mistakes.
[20:06.640 --> 20:08.640]  Some of them are crazy. Some of them are having a bad day.
[20:08.640 --> 20:12.640]  They have PTSD. And they kill you. It's wrong.
[20:12.640 --> 20:14.640]  But the media takes that and zooms in.
[20:14.640 --> 20:19.640]  Imagine a whole sea shore of dead babies being aborted, black, white, brown,
[20:19.640 --> 20:24.640]  and the whole globalist system and all the evil.
[20:24.640 --> 20:26.640]  And what GMOs are doing to everybody,
[20:26.640 --> 20:29.640]  and what the electromagnetic radiation of the 5G and all that give us cancer on record,
[20:29.640 --> 20:34.640]  all that, and millions of people getting hurt by vaccines,
[20:34.640 --> 20:38.640]  polio all over the world, tens of thousands of deaths a year from Bill Gates' vaccine.
[20:38.640 --> 20:41.640]  Even AP reports that.
[20:41.640 --> 20:43.640]  And none of that's on the radar screen.
[20:43.640 --> 20:46.640]  So just a whole sandbox of sand.
[20:46.640 --> 20:49.640]  And they get 14 grains out and they go,
[20:49.640 --> 20:52.640]  this is all that matters is these 14 black men.
[20:52.640 --> 20:56.640]  And then that makes people go out and start killing whites to start a race war.
[20:56.640 --> 20:59.640]  It's so stupid.
[20:59.640 --> 21:02.640]  George Soros is not a black man's friend.
[21:02.640 --> 21:06.640]  He's not anybody's friend, but the devil's.
[21:06.640 --> 21:10.640]  The reason I played with all this news I've got, I've got a full big news day.
[21:10.640 --> 21:14.640]  I wanted to go back to abortion because I saw this video this morning.
[21:14.640 --> 21:17.640]  There's a bunch of these videos to me to air them all.
[21:17.640 --> 21:21.640]  And it reminded me of something I saw a year ago that's in another compilation video we've got.
[21:21.640 --> 21:24.640]  And I'm not going to air it. I'm not going to put you through it.
[21:24.640 --> 21:30.640]  But this is a big thing where the left fetishizes being nine months pregnant.
[21:30.640 --> 21:34.640]  And they talk about, oh, you feel the baby kick and we love it and we talk to it.
[21:34.640 --> 21:37.640]  And we make jokes about how we're going to buy it toys.
[21:37.640 --> 21:41.640]  And then it really turns me on when my husband and I go in and get that abortion.
[21:41.640 --> 21:44.640]  And we chop that little piece of garbage up because it's about our power.
[21:44.640 --> 21:46.640]  This is pure Satanism.
[21:46.640 --> 21:48.640]  I mean, maybe I should play the clip again.
[21:48.640 --> 21:49.640]  You want me to play the clip again?
[21:49.640 --> 21:52.640]  There's videos people talking about this and it's all over Twitter and they do it.
[21:52.640 --> 21:55.640]  And she's like, baby, it turns me on when we kill it.
[21:55.640 --> 21:57.640]  He goes, I know I love it.
[21:57.640 --> 22:00.640]  This is their main culture, folks.
[22:00.640 --> 22:02.640]  They are Satanist.
[22:02.640 --> 22:06.640]  They're into that energy of selfishness and not caring about themselves or anyone
[22:06.640 --> 22:09.640]  and just being totally into evil.
[22:09.640 --> 22:11.640]  It's a spirit.
[22:11.640 --> 22:13.640]  And you see the selfishness everywhere.
[22:13.640 --> 22:25.640]  So the new TikTok thing run by the Communist Chinese is to have people sing about how they're going to kill their baby
[22:25.640 --> 22:28.640]  and how they love abortion and how it's about their power.
[22:28.640 --> 22:30.640]  And then they show you their babies.
[22:30.640 --> 22:31.640]  We've blurred their faces.
[22:31.640 --> 22:32.640]  They don't.
[22:32.640 --> 22:35.640]  And they throw the babies, obviously hurting them in many cases.
[22:35.640 --> 22:36.640]  They could break ribs.
[22:36.640 --> 22:38.640]  You name it.
[22:38.640 --> 22:43.640]  And look, because, again, the media says, oh, black people, we love you.
[22:43.640 --> 22:47.640]  Men should remove their genitals and you should get rid of the nuclear family
[22:47.640 --> 22:48.640]  and you should abort your babies.
[22:48.640 --> 22:53.640]  They got mainly black people really getting into that Jezebel spirit of,
[22:53.640 --> 22:55.640]  I'm going to kill my baby.
[22:55.640 --> 22:57.640]  I'm going to kill my baby.
[22:57.640 --> 22:59.640]  And you can say, oh, it's a joke.
[22:59.640 --> 23:00.640]  No, it's not a joke.
[23:00.640 --> 23:02.640]  It's all about dehumanizing themselves.
[23:02.640 --> 23:07.640]  There's nothing grosser than having a song about abortion and saying you're going to kill your baby.
[23:07.640 --> 23:10.640]  I mean, there's hours of this crap and it's being pushed to the front.
[23:10.640 --> 23:17.640]  Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and the media loves it.
[23:17.640 --> 23:20.640]  But, oh, none of us against it can have a voice because that's what Big Tech is about,
[23:20.640 --> 23:23.640]  is silencing everybody that stands up for God and justice and children.
[23:23.640 --> 23:27.640]  But I just, Christ warned the people that are into killing kids and hurting kids.
[23:27.640 --> 23:30.640]  He said, I'm going to get you like nobody else.
[23:30.640 --> 23:35.640]  You're my number one enemy and I am going to break you into a thousand pieces.
[23:35.640 --> 23:38.640]  I'm going to get ahold of you and you're going to pay big time.
[23:38.640 --> 23:42.640]  Let's go ahead and play these brainwashed devils out there externalizing the Satanism.
[23:42.640 --> 23:44.640]  Here it is.
[23:44.640 --> 23:46.640]  Oh, baby, we can't have a baby.
[23:46.640 --> 23:53.640]  If you want to just plan B, plan C.
[23:53.640 --> 23:56.640]  No, baby, we can't have a baby.
[23:56.640 --> 24:03.640]  If you want to just plan B, plan C.
[24:03.640 --> 24:05.640]  No, baby, we can't have a baby.
[24:05.640 --> 24:12.640]  If you want to just plan B, plan C.
[24:12.640 --> 24:19.640]  If you want to just plan B, plan C.
[24:19.640 --> 24:22.640]  No, baby, we can't have a baby.
[24:22.640 --> 24:27.640]  If you want to just plan B, plan C.
[24:27.640 --> 24:31.640]  No, baby, we can't have a baby.
[24:31.640 --> 24:34.640]  If you want to just plan B, plan C.
[24:34.640 --> 24:39.640]  So it's all about throw away your children, throw away your future.
[24:39.640 --> 24:42.640]  Again, we heard a shorter compilation from a few years ago.
[24:42.640 --> 24:51.640]  We've got a new one that, again, has people on it talking about how much it turns them on to chop their children up.
[24:51.640 --> 24:57.640]  They go, you know what, it is a baby and I'm going to kill it because it's about my power.
[24:57.640 --> 25:01.640]  And it's a parasite and I'm going to get it.
[25:01.640 --> 25:03.640]  And they love taunting everybody.
[25:03.640 --> 25:08.640]  They love to humanize it because they have partaken in this twisted spirit.
[25:08.640 --> 25:14.640]  And the system needs us to get God out of the world so we can move against humanity.
[25:14.640 --> 25:15.640]  And that's what all this is about.
[25:15.640 --> 25:22.640]  These globalists are the most empty, selfish, devoid of God people you could ever imagine.
[25:22.640 --> 25:23.640]  And I'm done talking about that.
[25:23.640 --> 25:28.640]  I wanted to spend the first half hour on that we need to really value life if we value ourselves.
[25:28.640 --> 25:36.640]  And when we stop caring about other people, it creates just a hellish world and that's where we're going.
[25:36.640 --> 25:40.640]  And President Trump has marched with the pro-life for something no republic has done.
[25:40.640 --> 25:42.640]  He's called to stop the partial birth abortion.
[25:42.640 --> 25:44.640]  He's called for states to have the right to ban it.
[25:44.640 --> 25:47.640]  And they always said it was about a woman's choice and it's not a human.
[25:47.640 --> 25:50.640]  No, it's a blood sacrifice and a sacrament.
[25:50.640 --> 25:59.640]  And I can tell you the Chuck E. Schumer's of the world, the Bill Clinton's of the world, the Hillary Clinton's of the world, the Ruth Bader Ginsburg's of the world are little vampire bats.
[25:59.640 --> 26:00.640]  It's their sacrament.
[26:00.640 --> 26:01.640]  They love it.
[26:01.640 --> 26:03.640]  They think they get their power from it.
[26:03.640 --> 26:07.640]  Just like all the other ancient societies did, they're killing children.
[26:07.640 --> 26:10.640]  Just like they want to kill your economy and kill your future.
[26:10.640 --> 26:13.640]  To them, that's power to be able to kill a bunch of kids.
[26:13.640 --> 26:15.640]  To them, that's power to have you wear a muzzle over your face.
[26:15.640 --> 26:21.640]  To them, that's power to lie about everything and have you have to bow down and say you're not essential but their companies are.
[26:21.640 --> 26:23.640]  Governor Newsom, all his wineries never closed.
[26:23.640 --> 26:26.640]  His restaurants never closed but everybody else's did.
[26:26.640 --> 26:32.640]  It's all about them laughing at you and training you to bow to them so they can destroy you.
[26:32.640 --> 26:34.640]  They're the enemy.
[26:34.640 --> 26:40.640]  We need to start identifying them as such and knowing that they are your mortal enemy sworn to destroy you.
[26:40.640 --> 26:44.640]  And as soon as you understand that, everything makes sense.
[26:44.640 --> 26:47.640]  But until you click into that mindset, nothing makes sense.
[26:47.640 --> 26:49.640]  So don't let them get you down.
[26:49.640 --> 26:51.640]  We're going to get them down.
[26:51.640 --> 26:52.640]  Real down.
[26:52.640 --> 26:53.640]  You know how.
[26:53.640 --> 26:54.640]  Deep down.
[26:54.640 --> 26:55.640]  We'll get right back.
[26:55.640 --> 27:08.640]  Remember the Global Lockdowns you're witnessing, the Black Lives Matter, Antifa riots and racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly directed by a handful of top billionaires.
[27:08.640 --> 27:14.640]  Led by people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, of course, Tim Cook and others.
[27:14.640 --> 27:19.640]  They set up there with their trillions of dollars they control in their companies.
[27:19.640 --> 27:29.640]  They're hundreds of billions of dollars individually leveraging that against us and trying to create an artificial revolution against local government and police.
[27:29.640 --> 27:40.640]  And the mayors are, again, they're playing their political game to try to trigger the complete breakdown of the United States and Western Europe to show these billionaires could come in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar.
[27:40.640 --> 27:48.640]  That's why I'm so angry at these globalists because when you're looking at them, they're the ones that sit in their councils and have decided to run these plans against us.
[27:48.640 --> 27:52.640]  They are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with.
[27:52.640 --> 27:54.640]  It's us or them, period.
[27:54.640 --> 28:00.640]  In the area, during a pandemic, we looked to local health authorities.
[28:00.640 --> 28:09.640]  So, for example, in the U.S., it would be CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation in a narrow way which could cause harm in the real world.
[28:09.640 --> 28:19.640]  That was a few months ago and the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai made a very important statement. All the other big tech heads made the exact same statement because it comes out of the U.N.
[28:19.640 --> 28:23.640]  That they follow the guidance of the WHO and or local government.
[28:23.640 --> 28:31.640]  What they mean is, in the United States, other areas of the world, cities that have been unionized or that have actually signed on to U.N. memorandums and agreements.
[28:31.640 --> 28:41.640]  So, what he's saying is, oh, we follow the United Nations and our global government and then we've got little stakeholder parents, that's how the U.N. works, that then give the illusion of it being local.
[28:41.640 --> 28:49.640]  But then when your doctors or your scientists or virologists come out and say that COVID-19 has massively exaggerated the power grab, they get silenced.
[28:49.640 --> 28:55.640]  Their press conferences get muzzled just like they do in Communist China. That's what's really going on here.
[28:55.640 --> 29:02.640]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[29:02.640 --> 29:07.640]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[29:07.640 --> 29:20.640]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids, don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships,
[29:20.640 --> 29:31.640]  and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like Siri or Alexa do,
[29:31.640 --> 29:37.640]  and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[29:37.640 --> 29:42.640]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[29:42.640 --> 29:52.640]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score. Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks.

[30:32.640 --> 30:43.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are 40 days out. Dr. Mercola, medical doctor, one of the leading experts on exposing the whole COVID scam, will be joining us.
[30:43.640 --> 30:50.640]  Now you can call it a hoax, but a hoax means it's all fake. No, it's a scam. It's a power grab.
[30:50.640 --> 30:57.640]  You know, I feel like this speech the President gave is so important, even though I want to talk, you know, I want to talk because I want to cover a lot of stuff.
[30:57.640 --> 31:05.640]  I really think we should air the entire seven minutes of his speech yesterday afternoon. Recalls out China.
[31:05.640 --> 31:24.640]  Now, the reason the media doesn't want China called out, the reason Big Tech blocks and censors anybody that says that, is that if it comes out, that it came out of Wuhan, which it did, and it's manmade, so everybody gets it, so they can then make money off of it and then make everybody guilty of having it.
[31:24.640 --> 31:33.640]  It's a real virus, folks, very, very hard to kill somebody with it. But if you're deficient in any of your vitamins or minerals, it will kill you better than a hammer.
[31:33.640 --> 31:48.640]  It's a real flu or a regular cold. That said, we've cracked the code, we know the operation. But it is a power grab. It is the cover for the rollout of worldwide martial law, the cashless society, the digital tracking systems, all of it.
[31:48.640 --> 32:01.640]  And so that's why Big Tech has one iron rule. You will not say China is connected to this because then it goes to Gates, it goes to Fauci, it goes to NIH, it goes to the UN.
[32:01.640 --> 32:11.640]  That's been successful in getting into all these countries worldwide, not with regular governance, taken over the military, people say no to that, but getting control of the medical system.
[32:11.640 --> 32:18.640]  Now they won't control the police systems with a UN program called Strong Cities.
[32:18.640 --> 32:36.640]  They come into cities and pump in hundreds of millions of dollars into big ones, tens of millions into medium sizes, hundreds of thousands into small towns, and they fly your mayors off to the UN in Europe and in New York, line and dine them, $200 steak dinners, investment deals.
[32:36.640 --> 32:43.640]  I mean, they just prostitutes, it's all come out. And that's how they get control through something called mutualization.
[32:43.640 --> 32:56.640]  And I know I harp on this so much because they don't have full control of the federal government, the globalist don't, but they've gotten almost every major city because the average mayor is already corrupt and they're just so stupid.
[32:56.640 --> 33:03.640]  And their city manager tells them, just go ahead and do this. Let's go ahead and go to Trump's speech. This is very historical. It's very important.
[33:03.640 --> 33:10.640]  And we need to point out that everybody that's against America and against Trump is a CHICOM agent, whether they know it or not, here it is.
[33:10.640 --> 33:14.640]  It is my profound honor to address the United Nations General Assembly.
[33:14.640 --> 33:24.640]  75 years after the end of World War II and the founding of the United Nations, we are once again engaged in a great global struggle.
[33:24.640 --> 33:35.640]  We have waged a fierce battle against the invisible enemy, the China virus, which has claimed countless lives in 188 countries.
[33:35.640 --> 33:42.640]  In the United States, we launched the most aggressive mobilization since the Second World War.
[33:42.640 --> 33:52.640]  We rapidly produced a record supply of ventilators, creating a surplus that allowed us to share them with friends and partners all around the globe.
[33:52.640 --> 33:59.640]  We pioneered life-saving treatments, reducing our fatality rate 85 percent since April.
[33:59.640 --> 34:11.640]  Thanks to our efforts, three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials. We are mass producing them in advance so they can be delivered immediately upon arrival.
[34:11.640 --> 34:25.640]  We will distribute a vaccine, we will defeat the virus, we will end the pandemic, and we will enter a new era of unprecedented prosperity, cooperation, and peace.
[34:25.640 --> 34:35.640]  As we pursue this bright future, we must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world, China.
[34:35.640 --> 34:45.640]  In the earliest days of the virus, China locked down travel domestically while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world.
[34:45.640 --> 34:53.640]  China condemned my travel ban on their country even as they canceled domestic flights and locked citizens in their homes.
[34:53.640 --> 35:05.640]  The Chinese government and the World Health Organization, which is virtually controlled by China, falsely declared that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission.
[35:05.640 --> 35:11.640]  Later, they falsely said people without symptoms would not spread the disease.
[35:11.640 --> 35:15.640]  The United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions.
[35:15.640 --> 35:36.640]  In addition, every year China dumps millions and millions of tons of plastic and trash into the oceans, overfishes other countries' waters, destroys vast swaths of coral reef, and emits more toxic mercury into the atmosphere than any country anywhere in the world.
[35:36.640 --> 35:48.640]  China's carbon emissions are nearly twice what the U.S. has, and it's rising fast by contrast after I withdrew from the one-sided Paris climate accord.
[35:48.640 --> 35:54.640]  Last year, America reduced its carbon emissions by more than any country in the agreement.
[35:54.640 --> 36:03.640]  Those who attack America's exceptional environmental record while ignoring China's rampant pollution are not interested in the environment.
[36:03.640 --> 36:08.640]  They only want to punish America, and I will not stand for it.
[36:08.640 --> 36:15.640]  If the United Nations is to be an effective organization, it must focus on the real problems of the world.
[36:15.640 --> 36:28.640]  This includes terrorism, the oppression of women, forced labor, drug trafficking, human and sex trafficking, religious persecution, and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities.
[36:28.640 --> 36:44.640]  America will always be a leader in human rights. My administration is advancing religious liberty, opportunity for women, the decriminalization of homosexuality, combating human trafficking, and protecting unborn children.
[36:44.640 --> 36:58.640]  We also know that American prosperity is the bedrock of freedom and security all over the world. In three short years, we built the greatest economy in history, and we are quickly doing it again.
[36:58.640 --> 37:08.640]  Our military has increased substantially in size. We spent $2.5 trillion over the last four years on our military.
[37:08.640 --> 37:16.640]  We have the most powerful military anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. We stood up to decades of China's trade abuses.
[37:16.640 --> 37:23.640]  We revitalized the NATO alliance where other countries are now paying a much more fair share.
[37:23.640 --> 37:32.640]  We forged historic partnerships with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to stop human smuggling.
[37:32.640 --> 37:38.640]  We are standing with the people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela in their rights.
[37:38.640 --> 37:53.640]  All right. The full speech is on infowards.com, and I know listeners hear him saying we've got a vaccine. America's strong. He's doing that because the Gates U.N. plan is to keep us closed for a couple years and saying we can't reopen until we get a vaccine.
[37:53.640 --> 38:07.640]  So by him checkmating them and coming out with a vaccine, that restarts the economy, which is their main target. It's a very dangerous gamble, but I understand why Trump's doing it because at least half the public is buying into all this fear.
[38:07.640 --> 38:14.640]  So how is he supposed to get them to go back to work and get out of the shell that's supposedly never going to end according to the U.N.?
[38:14.640 --> 38:26.640]  So I am not for the vaccine. I think it's all dangerous. It all causes bad autoimmune problems. Most of these vaccines are contaminated.
[38:26.640 --> 38:34.640]  But what we don't want is the Bill Gates vaccine. So I know exactly what Trump's doing. Doesn't mean I'm even endorsing it.
[38:34.640 --> 38:45.640]  There's been a lot of misinformation out there that I am endorsing Trump's vaccine. No, I am wargaming why he's doing it, and the people that say that I'm promoting the vaccine clip out a 10-second clip out of context.
[38:45.640 --> 38:54.640]  It's like mainstream media does. But that's on them. But I get a lot of calls, a lot of emails. You know, you get stuff people saying, is it true? We should take the vaccine.
[38:54.640 --> 39:00.640]  That's up to you. I'm not taking anything other than the normal vitamins and minerals that fortify my immunity.
[39:00.640 --> 39:11.640]  We should open the phones up and talk about that and bring up Trump and bring up his vaccine bushing. Because, again, it's very Machiavellian. I know what he's doing.
[39:11.640 --> 39:21.640]  The leftist media tells us America is closed forever. America is going to fall apart. The virus destroyed us. But oh, China's open for business.
[39:21.640 --> 39:35.640]  And so if Trump can head them off and say, oh, no, we're not going to have a vaccine in 2022 or like 2021, we have it now and go to these other companies that don't have the special vaccine gates is developing that literally goes in and reprograms your cell as a guinea pig.
[39:35.640 --> 39:47.640]  That just is the excuse to open everything up and then most people don't get the vaccine. We'll see, though, as this unfolds. But if they keep the economy locked down, the depression will be irreversible.
[39:47.640 --> 39:53.640]  We'll collapse. The third world will die. It'll be hell on Earth. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[40:18.640 --> 40:26.640]  The globalist won us off the air because their global plan of total tyranny and a post-human world will not succeed if we stay on air.
[40:26.640 --> 40:34.640]  If you don't support us, ladies and gentlemen, now they're going to shut InfoWars down and shut everybody else down as well. You already know that it's out of the open.
[40:34.640 --> 40:45.640]  So again, count the cost, focus and realize how critical you are with your word of mouth spreading the word that overrides the censors, your financial support getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com and your prayer.
[40:45.640 --> 40:54.640]  I'm praying for you. Please pray for us. Let's do this together. We're going to win. We are winning, but it's not going to be easy. The enemy is trying to take it all from us. Let's not let them succeed.
[41:15.640 --> 41:24.640]  That aren't like Nostradamus, they but are very, very detailed, extremely specific, that are now coming true at a frightening rate.
[41:24.640 --> 41:35.640]  Frightening because so many people are still living under the control of the God of this world. Satan did not realize that their immortal souls are in grave danger.
[41:35.640 --> 41:42.640]  Do not fear he who can kill the body. Fear he who can kill the soul as the good book warns us.
[41:42.640 --> 41:50.640]  I'm Alex Jones and I'm very honored to be on air still during this time. Every day we're still on air as a blessing. So please pray for InfoWars.
[41:50.640 --> 42:13.640]  Pray for yourself, pray for the children, pray for the world. God bless you all.
[42:21.640 --> 42:30.640]  Once they have the electronic straightjacket in place, they are on record that they will bring in force inoculations that sterilize you and your family and worse.
[42:30.640 --> 42:39.640]  Many of the vaccines being pushed by the United Nations actually give people polio and actually give people cancer. Most cancer is viral.
[42:39.640 --> 42:46.640]  That's a big secret, but the secret is beginning to come out. It's even in the associated press.
[42:46.640 --> 42:55.640]  Remember, all of these banned videos and reports are banned on video, but only you can share them and save humanity.
[42:55.640 --> 43:04.640]  There is a forced evolution taking place. The scientific ruling elite believe they are transcending to a silicon life form.
[43:04.640 --> 43:13.640]  While they are making this hypothetical, very dangerous transition that is guaranteed doom to fail and create nightmares that are almost unimaginable,
[43:13.640 --> 43:18.640]  their plan for us is extermination or spiking the cannon.
[43:18.640 --> 43:27.640]  Like after a major war is done, you don't want those weapons used again. You get rid of them. We are being rendered into scrap metal right now.
[43:27.640 --> 43:32.640]  So think about all your ancestors. Think about your grandparents. Think about your parents. Think about your children. Think about the future.
[43:32.640 --> 43:41.640]  And ask yourself, are you really going to let a bunch of crazy mad scientists steal the future destiny of everyone and basically use us like guinea pigs to experiment
[43:41.640 --> 43:45.640]  so they can try to find cures to cancer and things, not for us, but for them?
[43:45.640 --> 43:51.640]  Bill Gates is the leader of this organization. Bill Gates is the enemy of humanity.
[43:51.640 --> 43:54.640]  Decide what you're going to do, America. Decide what you're going to do, humanity.
[43:58.640 --> 44:01.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[44:01.640 --> 44:03.640]  The Alex Jones Show.
[44:32.640 --> 44:35.640]  All right.
[44:42.640 --> 44:46.640]  Dr. Merkola from merkola.com.
[44:46.640 --> 44:50.640]  Dr. Joseph Merkola will join us for much of the next hour.
[44:50.640 --> 44:57.040]  hour. Then I'm going to open the phones up for the entire third hour that John
[44:57.040 --> 44:59.440]  Rapoport takes over an hour before the war room.
[45:03.680 --> 45:10.480]  I do want to get into the latest developments with the whole COVID-19 situation.
[45:11.360 --> 45:18.080]  There's a new big letter with hundreds of doctors and thousands of other medical workers
[45:18.080 --> 45:23.760]  saying no medical justification for emergency measures, open letter, hundreds of doctors,
[45:24.480 --> 45:29.280]  health providers, urge into the lockdown and you can go see it for yourself and sign on to it if
[45:29.280 --> 45:36.800]  you'd like. That's at infowars.com. Let's see what they're doing is they're getting rid of
[45:36.800 --> 45:42.000]  normal behavior. There's always thousands dying of pneumonia every year per country. There's always
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.680]  thousands dying the flu but now they're fetishizing it where well if there's any possible you can die,
[45:47.680 --> 45:51.360]  you just can't ever go outside again even though statistically you can get viruses there and die.
[45:52.640 --> 45:55.840]  And I know we all know the statistics and the numbers. The globalists don't care
[45:58.640 --> 46:03.120]  because half the population at least especially who are TV heads
[46:04.720 --> 46:11.120]  are highly suggestible and to them it's the perception that there are millions of dead.
[46:11.120 --> 46:18.880]  Joe Biden comes out and says 200 million people are dead. There are folks defending that who believe
[46:18.880 --> 46:25.360]  that happened. It's not even a million worldwide. And if you look at the flu numbers all the world
[46:25.360 --> 46:30.480]  they're no longer counting flu numbers in Europe and Japan and China and here they all call it
[46:30.480 --> 46:37.920]  COVID-19. This is completely synthetic. This is a scam. This is a power grab. There's an article
[46:37.920 --> 46:44.240]  out called The Emperor's New Clothes from Tablet Magazine dealing with a Chinese scientist in
[46:44.240 --> 46:49.120]  Hong Kong who worked at the WHO who saw the evidence that it was man-made and that it came
[46:49.120 --> 46:54.560]  out of Wuhan on purpose and again she's being censored everywhere. And Facebook threatens to
[46:54.560 --> 46:58.640]  unpublish Mark Dice Page for written house video that just shows what written house really did.
[46:58.640 --> 47:10.240]  So we'll be breaking all that down. And also Target Store is boarded up in Louisville, Kentucky
[47:10.240 --> 47:20.640]  preparation for potential Breonna Taylor riots. When that verdict comes out later today we're
[47:20.640 --> 47:27.040]  going to be following all of that. And then now there's just so many Black Lives Matter videos
[47:27.040 --> 47:35.360]  of horrible, evil, dumbed down mindless people. Black, white, you name it, coming up and just
[47:35.360 --> 47:40.880]  saying the most racist horrible people, horrible things to white people. It's just so sad to see
[47:40.880 --> 47:47.840]  this division and so sad to see the backlash of whites becoming radicalized and the globalists
[47:47.840 --> 47:52.480]  just playing us all off against each other. It's so sad. Soros is the main guy funding all of this
[47:52.480 --> 47:57.280]  but he's just the front guy. They're so evil. And this is the Democratic Party and this is the
[47:57.280 --> 48:02.080]  globalists that are bringing all the Islamists to Europe and then making it against the law to report
[48:02.080 --> 48:09.360]  on the different crimes and things that they are, crimes and things that they are committing.
[48:09.360 --> 48:14.640]  There's this little velcro thing on this headpiece, earpiece that's driving me crazy.
[48:15.360 --> 48:18.720]  So it reminds me during the break to take it off because it's just like hanging down on my back
[48:18.720 --> 48:23.280]  and rubbing nuts. I wore a t-shirt today. I didn't wear my normal sports check and stuff because
[48:23.920 --> 48:28.800]  we were going to go for like an eight mile hike this morning at 6 a.m. in the dark and we took
[48:28.800 --> 48:33.520]  the wrong turn. People were arguing with the GPS and said we need to go this way. We didn't go that
[48:33.520 --> 48:37.360]  way. We went a couple miles out of the ways. We went basically hike like 10 miles, some of it,
[48:37.360 --> 48:43.440]  you know, bouldering and going through the woods at night and man, my sciatica, which doesn't hit
[48:43.440 --> 48:49.040]  a lot but it did hit is just flamethrower pain. But I'm not going to take painkillers for it.
[48:49.040 --> 48:52.880]  I'm not going to even take Advil. I'm just going to ignore it, take a hot bath when I get home
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.840]  tonight. But it's kind of good sometimes when I'm in pain or sick. Folks say I do a better show
[48:58.560 --> 49:03.120]  because it makes me slow down a little bit. And so that's what's going on. I haven't had a
[49:04.320 --> 49:10.000]  half bottle of whiskey or anything. I am just super tired from that because at 46 and not having
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.320]  a lot of time to work out like I used to as much, you know, 10 mile hike in the dark,
[49:15.040 --> 49:21.120]  climbing over a bunch of boulders and stuff. The seven miles was fun. At the last three miles,
[49:21.120 --> 49:26.480]  I was like, man, I am sick of this. This is not fun, but I'll certainly get the benefits from it.
[49:27.360 --> 49:31.520]  Okay, enough about that. There's a lot of other just over the top news. We're going to be breaking
[49:31.520 --> 49:40.800]  down in unprecedented monetary overhaul. The Fed is preparing to deposit digital dollars directly
[49:40.800 --> 49:48.880]  into each American's account. Big zero hedge.com article about that. It's also posted info wars.com
[49:50.080 --> 49:56.000]  and that's really a big, big deal. You know, I don't like living in a welfare state like that.
[49:56.000 --> 50:03.760]  And I don't like that in spirit. But in function, if we've already had trillions and trillions
[50:03.760 --> 50:09.280]  of bailout that mainly got grabbed by Jeff Bezos, they got 33 billion of it and other globalists.
[50:10.400 --> 50:14.240]  Trump, when he learned that most of it wasn't getting the people, he said, then we're going to
[50:14.240 --> 50:19.120]  try to have this directly to the people to get the economy turbocharged and going again.
[50:19.120 --> 50:28.000]  And so that is definitely what's going on. And yes, it in theory could devalue the
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.960]  dollar. But here's the problem. China has already probably the numbers are five times
[50:32.960 --> 50:38.320]  over in front of their currencies versus ours. Globally, they have an internal and external
[50:38.320 --> 50:46.160]  currency, Yen and Yon. They are also paying to have media run articles is on record,
[50:46.160 --> 50:51.760]  badmouthing the dollar. So what matters now is that the United States end up with the world
[50:51.760 --> 50:56.160]  reserve currency still and China not get that. Because if we lose the dollar, it's over. And
[50:56.160 --> 51:01.360]  so right now it's about the dollar being propped up domestically. So when you see CNN, MSNBC,
[51:01.360 --> 51:05.520]  all these stations and foreign news saying the dollar is dead, the dollar is going under.
[51:06.080 --> 51:10.560]  And then they get people that are so-called fiscal conservatives to technically sit there and go,
[51:10.560 --> 51:15.040]  well, this is wrong. Well, they're not living in the real world. You know, a quote I gave a few
[51:15.040 --> 51:20.160]  weeks ago was taken out of context. I said, listening to big libertarian establishment,
[51:21.920 --> 51:29.920]  heritage foundation type propaganda isn't real libertarianism when the rest of the
[51:29.920 --> 51:34.560]  world economies are rigged. And so when we're libertarian and open up, they exploit us and
[51:34.560 --> 51:39.120]  use that against us. And so one of the dumbest things I ever did was being a pure libertarian.
[51:39.120 --> 51:42.720]  And that's why the big banks and people did fund that libertarian movement to make us all
[51:42.720 --> 51:47.840]  a bunch of schmucks and not protect our markets. So it's taken out of context that I hate all
[51:47.840 --> 51:54.320]  libertarians. No, no, I get the social issues with libertarians. I get the mutual agreement
[51:54.320 --> 51:59.680]  not to initiate aggression. I think a lot of libertarian ideas are fantastic. They're very
[51:59.680 --> 52:04.960]  Americana, but in function and with the party itself and who they are, they're a bunch of leftists
[52:04.960 --> 52:09.120]  at the top of it and that have endorsed the COVID lockdowns and all the rest of it. And
[52:09.120 --> 52:16.160]  they just support the complete collapse of this country. So we're in a war to have confidence
[52:16.160 --> 52:20.640]  in the nation, the military, our currency and our culture. We need to believe in ourselves.
[52:20.640 --> 52:25.120]  We need to believe in what made America great. We do need a strong defensive military that pulls
[52:25.120 --> 52:30.400]  back, licks its wounds and then prepares to protect itself, not just in the physical realm,
[52:30.400 --> 52:35.840]  but in the cyber area. And we need to then get control of the military and the intelligence
[52:35.840 --> 52:41.520]  agencies that global is still having partial control of and have them stop engaging in
[52:41.520 --> 52:46.400]  psyopsis against the American people and start engaging in real soft power by being open and
[52:46.400 --> 52:51.920]  good and truthful and virtuous. That's what real power is, not sneaking around and running
[52:51.920 --> 52:56.960]  scams and dividing people. And there's a real fight inside our intelligence agencies. You know, I
[52:56.960 --> 53:04.320]  thought about five years ago, six years ago, the Pentagon came out and they quoted dredge report
[53:04.320 --> 53:08.560]  back when dredge was really waking folks up and said, you know, we know that we've been lying to
[53:08.560 --> 53:12.960]  the public and we and we're making a commitment here at the Pentagon to stop lying to you
[53:13.760 --> 53:17.200]  like we did about all these different things. And we're not going to let the politicians
[53:17.200 --> 53:22.080]  make turn us into liars anymore. And it was the, it was the deputy secretary of defense.
[53:22.080 --> 53:24.000]  We got to find that speech and put that out.
[53:26.480 --> 53:30.320]  And I think the headline was deputy secretary of defense says they're going to stop lying because
[53:30.320 --> 53:35.440]  of dredge report. And it was actually the headline. They want to say alternative independent media.
[53:35.440 --> 53:40.240]  And I thought it was a cynical move at the time. But if you look to the faces of everybody in there,
[53:40.240 --> 53:45.360]  some of them were crying. These are the civilians the Pentagon that had to sit there and lie to
[53:45.360 --> 53:53.760]  everybody all day and run all this. So there's a real civil war inside the government. And it's
[53:53.760 --> 53:57.920]  real simple what side we should be on the one that's pro America, the one that our fathers and
[53:57.920 --> 54:02.000]  mothers and grandparents were part of the one that believes in freedom and the right to self
[54:02.000 --> 54:07.360]  defense and capitalism and the one that we know is successful and is it perfect because we never
[54:07.360 --> 54:14.720]  really realized it's true aims. And so that's where I'm coming from on that front. It's just
[54:14.720 --> 54:21.840]  really amazing. And to see people throwing down their American birthright to take on globalist
[54:21.840 --> 54:26.080]  birthright with Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook and Gigi Ping, you think those guys,
[54:26.080 --> 54:32.160]  they don't just not care about you. They have a will to dominate you. They are psychotic monsters.
[54:33.120 --> 54:38.320]  We'll be right back on the other side info wars.com news wars.com. Only way the dog
[54:38.320 --> 54:42.240]  guns spread the links. We'll be right back. I know you're going to spread those links until
[54:42.240 --> 54:48.400]  most local stations. We've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown. And it's
[54:48.400 --> 54:53.600]  horrible. And it's killing millions of people via starvation. But the good news is it's caused
[54:53.600 --> 55:00.640]  a planetary awakening as well. The general public all over the planet hate Bill Gates. He's the most
[55:00.640 --> 55:06.320]  unpopular person on earth. People know he's not a doctor. People know he's a eugenicist.
[55:06.320 --> 55:11.680]  The population knows that his vaccines that he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses,
[55:11.680 --> 55:17.520]  polio, steroids and more. It's even in the associated press. So now they're beginning
[55:17.520 --> 55:22.800]  to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate global government and the
[55:22.800 --> 55:28.240]  beast top tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type of race war scams
[55:28.240 --> 55:34.160]  and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing. So remember that and let them know that we know
[55:34.160 --> 55:39.840]  who they are and what they've done and we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization.
[55:39.840 --> 55:47.840]  They are the enemies of humanity. They want you dead. Last week Tucker Carlson came out and said
[55:47.840 --> 55:53.600]  America is becoming the Soviet Union. In many ways, we're worse than the Soviet Union. The
[55:53.600 --> 55:58.400]  Soviet Union couldn't dream of what big tech can do, surveilling and censoring us. And we're going
[55:58.400 --> 56:02.560]  to get a lot worse than the Soviet Union when it comes to forced inoculations and the medical
[56:02.560 --> 56:08.080]  tyranny being rolled out by the United Nations now in control of what you can and can't say online.
[56:08.640 --> 56:13.440]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, America is fighting for its life. And the enemy's
[56:13.440 --> 56:19.200]  number one mission is to get Trump out of office and number two is to silence info wars because we
[56:19.200 --> 56:25.200]  understand just how diabolical they are, just how evil they are. And we want men's words. We know
[56:25.200 --> 56:29.280]  who the globalist are. We've got their number and we know how to beat them and we cover it seven
[56:29.280 --> 56:34.640]  days a week live at info wars and it's only because of your support. So keep spreading the word,
[56:34.640 --> 56:39.280]  keep praying for us and take advantage of the sales and get great products at infowarstore.com
[56:39.280 --> 56:45.200]  now. The globalists were hoping you don't visit infowarstore.com.
[56:48.800 --> 56:55.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:55.200 --> 57:07.200]  Don't let last night's crisis rewrite your history. As Black Lives Matter continues to lose
[57:07.200 --> 57:12.160]  support from the masses, it seems they are now trying to do damage control after realizing that
[57:12.160 --> 57:18.320]  attacking the nuclear family and bolting criminals to burn down the US and pushing Marxist ideologies
[57:18.320 --> 57:23.680]  onto America wasn't the best way to win over hearts and minds. Black Lives Matter, which has been
[57:23.680 --> 57:28.880]  linked to over 90 percent of the riots this past summer, has completely removed their what we believe
[57:28.880 --> 57:35.200]  page, which has some pretty extreme ideas. And before BLM tries to backtrack and push the idea
[57:35.200 --> 57:39.920]  that they are all for peace and simply uplifting the downtrodden black man, let's look into what
[57:39.920 --> 57:45.600]  BLM actually stands for and what they are trying to hide. When reading through their now deleted
[57:45.600 --> 57:51.280]  what we believe page, the main phrases and sentences that pop out all seem to surround demonizing men,
[57:51.280 --> 57:57.520]  heterosexuality and disrupting the nuclear family. For example, one of the key phrases on their page
[57:57.520 --> 58:02.720]  is their declaration to disrupt the Western prescribed nuclear family structure, aka destroy
[58:02.720 --> 58:07.680]  the traditional family with one mother and one father and then replace them with villages. That
[58:07.680 --> 58:12.480]  is then followed by more ideology where women and parents are mentioned, but nowhere in the whole
[58:12.480 --> 58:18.880]  page are fathers or men mentioned in a positive light. Also attacked is the idea of heterosexuality
[58:18.880 --> 58:23.440]  being the norm. Their page stated that they gathered with the intention of freeing ourselves
[58:23.440 --> 58:29.200]  from the tight grip of heteronormative thinking or rather the belief that all in the world are
[58:29.200 --> 58:34.960]  heterosexual. They also discussed the goal of dismantling cisgender privilege and talk about
[58:34.960 --> 58:41.200]  uplifting transgender people, specifically transgender women. The word comrade primarily
[58:41.200 --> 58:45.680]  used in communists or socialist settings is also heavily used throughout the page.
[58:45.680 --> 58:52.000]  But that has all since been deleted but not forgotten. We will never forget the Marxist
[58:52.000 --> 58:56.960]  ideologies that BLM was founded upon or the legacy of death, destruction, violence and chaos
[58:56.960 --> 59:02.720]  they have left behind. This year alone Black Lives Matter has been tied to 91% of the riots
[59:02.720 --> 59:07.840]  that have ravaged America. A new study by Princeton University revealed that over the three months
[59:07.840 --> 59:14.800]  span from May to September of this year there were over 630 riots across the U.S. With 91% of
[59:14.800 --> 59:20.080]  these riots linked to BLM. So out of all of those photos, videos and news reports of looted
[59:20.080 --> 59:25.280]  businesses, feet of Americans or burned down car locks, about 9 out of 10 of those were incidents
[59:25.280 --> 59:30.960]  directly tied to the Black Lives Matter movement. But the movement's destruction doesn't stop there.
[59:30.960 --> 59:35.200]  Since the beginning of the riots in May, cities across the U.S. have suffered up to $2 billion
[59:35.200 --> 59:41.120]  in damages due to the riots linked to BLM. A record-breaking number never seen in the history
[59:41.120 --> 59:46.960]  of the U.S. And let's not forget the BLM leaders who continue to embolden this type of behavior
[59:46.960 --> 59:52.240]  through either refusing to condemn rioting and looting or praising it by equating it to reparations.
[59:52.240 --> 59:58.880]  Care if somebody decides to loot a Gucci or a Macy's or a Nike because that makes sure that
[59:58.880 --> 1:00:06.000]  that person eats. That makes sure that that person has clothes. That's reparations. That is reparations.
[1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:10.240]  Anything they want to take take it because these businesses have insurance.
[1:00:10.240 --> 1:00:16.720]  The problem with oppression and white supremacy is white supremacy will have you criticizing
[1:00:16.720 --> 1:00:22.640]  the oppressed and worshiping the oppressors. Millions of dollars have also been raised in
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:26.960]  the name of Black Lives Matter, with these funds continuously used to bail out and
[1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:32.560]  re-release BLM riders back onto the streets. For example, the Minnesota Freedom Fund,
[1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:37.680]  which raised over $30 million after the death of George Floyd and has been promoted by politicians
[1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:42.880]  such as Kamala Harris, has used their funds to continually bail out the criminals arrested
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:48.480]  at violent riots, with many of these individuals having a history of violence, sexual assault,
[1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:59.760]  or even murder. As Black Lives Matter continues to embolden criminal behavior and push Marxist
[1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:04.720]  ideologies throughout America, people have begun to fear for their lives as this malicious mob
[1:01:04.720 --> 1:01:08.480]  continues to terrorize Americans and force them to stand in solidarity with the group.
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:40.560]  Black Lives Matter may try to rewrite their history or hide the reality of what they truly
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:45.520]  stand for, but they have left a huge stain on this country's history and America will not
[1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:51.600]  super get the real legacy that this organization has left behind. This has been Savannah Hernandez
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:02:00.240]  for Action 7 News. And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications
[1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:09.520]  from COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million people
[1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:16.880]  have died. Probably by the time I finish this talk. Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar,
[1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:23.120]  part of the establishment for close to 50 years. But now, boy, as his brain degenerates,
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:29.920]  we are seeing walking public dementia on the biggest stage in the world, the 2020 election.
[1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:35.600]  There are 370 million people in the United States. If 200 million died from COVID, that'd be more
[1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:41.600]  than half of the population, when not even one tenth of 1% have actually died. But him putting
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:47.200]  these giant lies and these incredibly brain damaged statements out is emblematic of the general
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:03:03.120]  public being in a trance. How is anyone even putting up with this? It is beyond bizarre.
[1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:24.720]  All right, again, Alex Jones here back live. I went for a 10-mile hike this morning,
[1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:32.800]  including some stomping around and bouldering. And my sciatica went out. I'm still here on
[1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:38.640]  air. I'm in a little bit of pain, so I'm making mistakes. I said Dr. Joseph Mercola was on next
[1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:43.200]  hour. He's on in the third hour. So we look forward to that. I'm going to open the phones up
[1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:48.240]  in this hour. Again, for first-time callers, that includes folks that were still on hold
[1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:52.320]  when the show ended yesterday. I'm going to really try to just get a limit, let's say,
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:56.240]  of seven or eight callers that way nobody else gets left on hold. I'll actually get to all your
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:02.000]  calls this hour on what do you make of Trump's China speech, calling out China for the COVID-19
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.840]  virus and saying that that's what really happened is the evidence shows that they're censoring
[1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:12.880]  even Tucker Carlson on Facebook when he has whistleblowers on. And they admit it came out of
[1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:18.640]  that lab. It's just incredible. What do you make of that? What do you make of 40 days of the election,
[1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:22.960]  how they're trying to plunge the dollar and crash the dollar, and how China is threatening war
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:28.480]  against the United States and doing flyovers on Hong Kong and Taiwan? What do you make of all the
[1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:33.520]  new COVID-19 lockdowns that are unfolding and all the other craziness that is happening?
[1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:40.800]  Let's go over some of these headlines. Here's the toll-free number, 877-789. Alex, 877-789.
[1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:49.360]  2539 is the toll-free number. And most folks can call from other countries on the toll-free,
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:57.600]  but some countries can't. So you dial the US access code and 512-646-1776, 512-646-1776.
[1:04:57.600 --> 1:05:02.480]  And it's good we still have phone lines. There's more and more. You can't communicate on the WhatsApp
[1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:08.240]  with Facebook. You can't communicate in these other big tech steps all over the world. Big tech is
[1:05:08.240 --> 1:05:14.000]  in live time watching what you type and not letting you send it. Talk about beyond the
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:19.360]  old Soviet Union, beyond 1984, and they're just doing it, ladies and gentlemen. Thousands of
[1:05:19.360 --> 1:05:25.840]  medical doctors, banned or restricted for talking about, hey, if you have vitamin C, if you have
[1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:36.160]  zinc, if you have vitamin D3, the NIH website says, and it's a fact, that it's very hard for viruses
[1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:40.240]  to replicate in the cells. In fact, if you're taking large dosages of those three things,
[1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:47.440]  they, many scientists and doctors say it's impossible. The problem is, as you get older,
[1:05:47.440 --> 1:05:53.840]  you don't absorb as much. And to sit there and to finally have Fauci come out and say that last
[1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:59.360]  week was a big deal, because everyone was calling him out, going, you say the UN says,
[1:05:59.360 --> 1:06:06.880]  no vitamins or minerals are a good preventative BS, buddy boy. You will die without vitamin C.
[1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:12.960]  You will die without vitamin D. You will die without zinc. You will die without iodine.
[1:06:15.840 --> 1:06:22.720]  These are facts, and they're stubborn things that these enemies don't want you to know,
[1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:28.400]  because if the average person knew that they shouldn't eat fast food all day and not take
[1:06:28.400 --> 1:06:35.520]  and not take organic vitamins and minerals, you would have almost no cases of people dying from
[1:06:35.520 --> 1:06:40.640]  viruses. Scientists know that, but there's so many people that have lots of calories, but
[1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:48.000]  they're starving to death with deficiencies. And again, if you do not have, guys, search
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:53.200]  engine, I forget the number, how many essential vitamins and minerals are there? Where they know,
[1:06:53.200 --> 1:06:58.640]  within six months, you die. A cold comes by, you die. And I forget the exact number, but there's
[1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:05.760]  was it 20-something vitamins? It's more than a dozen minerals, isn't it? I mean, let's see if I'm right.
[1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:11.200]  Let's see if I'm right. Let's just go from memory. How many vitamins you type in? How
[1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:15.600]  many vitamins and how many minerals are essential? And essential means for living. And look, I know,
[1:07:15.600 --> 1:07:19.520]  I got hundreds of articles and hundreds of clips, and I got guests coming up and your phone calls.
[1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:23.520]  Why am I saying this every hour on the hour? Because this will save lives, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:31.840]  This will absolutely save lives. All right. I like to take them all, but it says 13 essential
[1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:37.200]  vitamins. Okay. Well, I thought all 20-something were essential. And then how many minerals are
[1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:41.200]  essential? And again, who knows who's even saying this? For the scientists I've talked to, they
[1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:44.720]  say they're all basically essential. How much do you know about the 13 essential vitamins the
[1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:49.680]  body needs? 13 essential vitamins your body needs are. And then it goes through them all.
[1:07:50.480 --> 1:07:56.560]  And then Wikipedia or whatever, say 16. See what I mean? They all differ. Calcium, iron. Let's just
[1:07:56.560 --> 1:08:06.560]  go through these. Calcium, iron, sulfur, sodium, chloride, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese,
[1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:14.960]  iodine, selenium, chromium, a microscopic amount of fluoride, but not sodium fluoride.
[1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:22.160]  Sodium fluoride is what you need. It's the hydrofluorosalicyx
[1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:25.920]  that you don't want. Super poisonous. Those are your glands.
[1:08:28.320 --> 1:08:31.680]  So again, just go read that for yourself. I'm not going to go down that rabbit trail anymore.
[1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:38.320]  Oh, it's just very, very, very, very frustrating. So let's look at this. No medical justification
[1:08:38.320 --> 1:08:42.560]  for emergency measures, open letter, hundreds of doctors, thousands of health care workers.
[1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:49.920]  It's on infowars.com. This is just out of Belgium. We Belgian doctors and health professionals wish
[1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:56.640]  to express our serious concern about the evolution of the situation in the recent months surrounding
[1:08:56.640 --> 1:09:02.080]  the outbreak of SARS COVID-V2 virus. That's a technical name. We call them politicians
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:12.320]  to independently and critically informed in the decision-making process
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:17.840]  and the compulsory implementation of Corona measures. We asked for an open debate where all
[1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:22.080]  experts represented without any form of censorship. That's because you're not allowed to on any major
[1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:26.640]  platform in the world. That's you in control folks right there. Boom. It's world government.
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:31.200]  After the initial panic surrounding COVID-19, the objective facts now show
[1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:34.640]  a completely different picture, a completely different picture. You hear that?
[1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:45.840]  There is no medical justification for any emergency policy anymore. The current crisis
[1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:53.120]  management has become totally disproportionate and causes more damage than it does any good.
[1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:59.920]  We call for an end to all measures and ask for an immediate restoration of our normal
[1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:05.760]  democratic governance and legal structures and of all of our civil liberties and wait for it.
[1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:12.400]  Facebook has been censoring their letter. Thousands of medical workers in one country over
[1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:17.760]  100 doctors and it's the list is getting bigger. They're like, sorry, you can't talk. The UN said
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:23.760]  but Trump can get up there and say it's a China virus. Trump can get up there and see
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:27.920]  because he's the president. He has a voice but almost no one else does. Everybody else has a
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:33.040]  platform on Twitter, on Facebook, on YouTube. You try to create a website, try to promote it there.
[1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:38.480]  Oh, sorry. Can't do that because it's a takeover and I know the audience knows this but people
[1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:43.600]  have to understand. I'd say about a third of the people I saw on the hiking bike trail this morning
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:47.760]  when we got more populated areas. We were in some rougher areas for the first part of it.
[1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:53.680]  We're wearing masks. They see us. They put them on and I just say, come on. It's 10 to 100 times
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:57.680]  lower than the flu depending on where you are and it's a vitamin deficiency and they would
[1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:02.880]  laugh at me and one woman said, you're a white supremacist. I said to her, I said,
[1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:06.000]  I said, hey, how are you doing? I see you put your mask on. You know, it's at least 10 times
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:10.080]  weaker than the flu and they're using as a power grab. You know, the third world millions are starving
[1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:19.440]  to death. She goes, oh, you're into white power. The third world starving to death and we need to
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:24.720]  stop the lockdown that's killing them. I'm for white power. It was a white woman, of course,
[1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:30.000]  but she knew who I was and then it was really weird. I forget the guy's name. I forgot to ask
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:36.960]  the crew. I've seen before they ran into a big YouTuber that had hundreds of videos of millions
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:43.440]  of views apiece and he lives in Austin and both Pat and Tim that were with me were like, whoa,
[1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:48.880]  this is such a such. And after we talked to him, he was a listener and we said, hi, we went walking
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:53.280]  and they went, you know, he's been banned off everything now too. And that was Pat Riley telling
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:58.240]  Tim that and Tim couldn't believe it because the guy isn't even political. He just tells jokes,
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:02.320]  but see, these thought controllers want control of everything.
[1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:09.760]  They just picked info or demonized us to set the precedent so nobody would stand up for us
[1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:14.960]  while they demonize us at the same time. And then when that domino fell, everybody else was next
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:19.440]  and I watched all the other conservatives and all the other people, oh, Jones, we'd love to have you
[1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:25.520]  on but we might get censored. And I said, that's okay. A man only dies once a coward dies a thousand
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:31.120]  deaths. By you doing that, by you not all rallying at once behind free speech, you'll now be picked
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:36.320]  off one after the other. Someone that didn't back down, who wasn't a coward was Mark Dice,
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:40.960]  he's defended me massively. And notice he's still on air, though they're honing in on him now,
[1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:45.680]  starting to censor him. So that's how it all goes down, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:50.160]  your calls and a lot more straight ahead, 877-789, Alex, we'll be back.
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:56.960]  If you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and control them,
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:01.840]  to a man and to a woman, they believe there's too many people on the earth and they constantly whine
[1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:06.080]  about when they want to go to a mountain top or a national park, they have to look at us,
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:10.400]  the common people, they have to look at the proletariat, they have to look at the scum.
[1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:15.040]  That's why they love the lockdown, putting mussels on us, that gives them a big thrill,
[1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:20.640]  controlling where we can go, what we can do, bankrupting Main Street, bankrupting small towns,
[1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:26.160]  all of it is a vertical integration, consolidation, so they can then dictate the terms of our total
[1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:32.800]  surrender, which is taking sterile vaccines day one. Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over,
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:37.360]  playtime's over, they used all the entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance,
[1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:42.640]  and now the spider's moving in for the kill. You know this, I know this, it's all out in the open,
[1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:46.560]  the question is, what are we going to do about it? Well, the first thing is identify the enemy,
[1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:50.800]  identify the enemy, identify the enemy, identify your enemy now.
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:57.680]  You notice that over and over again, the United Nations, our supposed controllers and bosses,
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:01.280]  the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with, has come out and said,
[1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:07.440]  nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19. Ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie,
[1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:11.840]  you get a lot of sunlight, it's on record, to produce a ton of vitamin D3,
[1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:16.480]  and it's almost impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3,
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:20.880]  if you have zinc and vitamin C as well. That's why people get the flus and these colds in the
[1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:25.840]  winter, because that's when vitamin D levels plunge. Now I've pointed this out, and the media has
[1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:30.800]  called me a scammer for saying that there's hope that people should have their vitamins and their
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:36.240]  minerals. Well now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and see,
[1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:41.120]  he should have also added zinc, because the NIH website says you die without zinc,
[1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:45.680]  but it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality, because so many doctors and
[1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:49.920]  nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that he's not been warning the public
[1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:57.200]  to get their vitamins. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:16.480]  The date is Wednesday, September 23rd, the year is 2020, and we are 4-0-4-0-0-0 out
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:22.880]  on the most important election in world history. Nationalism versus globalism, a pro-human future,
[1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:27.840]  versus the end of humanity, and Satan's great dream. I'm your host Alex Jones. We're going to go
[1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:31.600]  right to your calls here in a moment and cover a ton of vital news and information,
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:36.320]  and Dr. Joseph Mercullo will join us in hour three ahead of investigative journalist John
[1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:42.080]  Rababort. This is the Info War, and we stand for humanity and justice and truth, and we are winning.
[1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:49.440]  All right, let me just throw this out there at you. Two things. We've extended it for another four
[1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:54.000]  or five days, and then they are going to end it. It's the highest quality, swarable food at the
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:59.120]  lowest prices. We sell the whole catalog at infowarstore.com, but they have rules because they
[1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:04.320]  have other suppliers that they can't go beneath a certain point, because it undercuts the market,
[1:16:04.320 --> 1:16:10.320]  unless they're doing a special promo themselves. And so we did it on their website at preparewithalex.com,
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:16.240]  that's a subdomain of my Patriot Supplies website, preparewithalex.com. You get an additional $170
[1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:21.840]  off, one of their smaller food packages, that's huge. $100 off another one, $170 off another one,
[1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:26.160]  and those specials are there. We can put it up on screen, preparewithalex.com.
[1:16:26.160 --> 1:16:34.160]  Five days, 14 hours, 37 minutes, 31 seconds. And if I was going to get swarable food and I have,
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:38.320]  this is where I'd get it. I've also augmented with some of this gourmet stuff. I've tried a lot of
[1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:43.040]  other places, and again, it costs three to five times more than this, and some of this stuff is
[1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:46.560]  just a taste way better when you have the grocery store. They've got stuff that tastes gourmet,
[1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:50.800]  a lot of it tastes okay. It's all good, it's all nutritious, it's all high quality.
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:56.800]  But the price you're paying, nothing comes close to this, especially all the little side desserts
[1:16:56.800 --> 1:17:00.080]  and their creams and their gravies and everything else. I'm getting hungry talking about it.
[1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:06.400]  So, preparewithalex.com, that helps fund the info war. It's a major checkbox everybody needs to get
[1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:11.200]  taken care of with all the craziness going on. Because even if Trump wins, things are going to
[1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:15.600]  be crazy for the next few years, probably forever now, things are just getting the singularity,
[1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:22.000]  the robots, the globalism, the populations, the satanic media is not going to give up. I mean,
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:26.240]  this is biblical. So, getting swarable food the last 25 years is critical. Do it now,
[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:31.440]  get the best deal and fund the info war. Also, when I want to clean out myself, and every time I
[1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:36.880]  forget to take DNA force plus, I'm like, you're an idiot, you need to do it. It's got PQQ, CoQ10,
[1:17:36.880 --> 1:17:44.800]  OrganicReachee, Astragalus, ELEV, ATP, Ancient Pete, Apple Extract and so much more. This is one
[1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:51.120]  of the strongest, highest quality organic systems because, you know, they've got synthetic PQQs and
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:56.000]  CoQ10s and all that, and they quite frankly probably don't even do anything. This is the real deal,
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:02.480]  and it's known to regrow nerves. It's known to make your telomeres last longer. I mean,
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:07.040]  this is an amazing product, DNA force. Even though it's going to sell out, we don't get more for two
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:11.360]  months. I want to just move it out of the warehouse so that we know we've got funds to operate.
[1:18:11.360 --> 1:18:17.200]  Very close to cost, 60% off and free shipping. Now's the time to get DNA force. Plus, and then
[1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:23.360]  separately, fall is here. And if you're not somebody that swims in lakes and stuff when it's
[1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:28.000]  getting cold, like I do, I'm a polar bear, then, and if you're not somebody that goes out and,
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:32.640]  you know, lays out your backyard even when it's 60 degrees, 40 degrees. I mean, I just love it.
[1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:37.840]  You need sun. The best way is vitamin D3 from the sun. You need vitamin D3 under the tongue.
[1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:43.600]  This is the highest quality, highest rate that we can get with vitamin K to help the absorption.
[1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:47.840]  This is for children. This is for women. This is for men. This is for old people especially,
[1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:52.800]  but everybody should be fortifying with D3 in general for everything. It is essential.
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:58.560]  Now, the God Fauci has said it is. Fauci said, you don't need oxygen. They might strangle all
[1:18:58.560 --> 1:19:02.160]  the children in school to say, you don't need oxygen anymore. And the CDC actually said breathing
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:06.400]  is bad. It spreads COVID now. I'm not joking. So, you know, there's, well, we have to kill everybody.
[1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:10.400]  It'll spread COVID. Everybody's dead. There'll be no more COVID problem. That's literally the
[1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:14.800]  mindlessness of these people because they're programming you with psychological warfare
[1:19:14.800 --> 1:19:18.480]  to be given so much garbage. If somebody lies, you just give up. Well, don't give up. Fight harder.
[1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:24.000]  Get stronger. Stop ranting. Winter sun is going to sell out as well, but we're getting more of it
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:28.560]  in about a month. But I would get it now. It is 50% off plus free shipping. You're not going to find
[1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:35.600]  a vitamin D3 anywhere near this for 1995. Okay. We put a lot of money into these products,
[1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:39.120]  and we're very, very proud of them. There's a lot of synthetic crap out there that does nothing
[1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:42.720]  effective. Because you see studies always like, oh, you don't need vitamins and minerals. This
[1:19:42.720 --> 1:19:47.440]  study showed it gave people liver problems. The synthetic multivitamins that are 10 bucks for
[1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:52.720]  a bottle, and it's all synthetic vitamins. That's not a real vitamin. That's deadly poisonous.
[1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:59.040]  That's so sick how they operate. You want organic vitamins. All right. I'm going to stop right there,
[1:19:59.040 --> 1:20:02.320]  ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to go to your phone calls and thank you all for your support.
[1:20:03.280 --> 1:20:08.080]  We got Chuck. We got Dustin. We got Brendan. We got Kevin. We got Cameron, Jim, Susan, Josh, Jay.
[1:20:09.200 --> 1:20:12.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Cameron in the great state of Texas. Cameron, thanks for calling.
[1:20:12.720 --> 1:20:19.200]  Hello, sir. It's good to speak with you today. Absolutely. Didos.
[1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:24.880]  Yeah. I was calling because I wanted to get your take on the CDC director saying that the
[1:20:25.600 --> 1:20:28.400]  mask is going to be more effective than a coronavirus vaccine.
[1:20:29.840 --> 1:20:36.560]  Yes. That's because the entire CDC with Fauci and Redfield and all these guys,
[1:20:36.560 --> 1:20:40.240]  whatever the hell his name is, they're all work for Gates. They all work for the globalists.
[1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:45.920]  They're all on record. And so they've got their vaccine that Fauci owns part of four of the vaccines
[1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:52.480]  with Gates. Gates owns part of seven of the regular vaccines. And then the new vaccine that goes in
[1:20:52.480 --> 1:20:56.480]  and reprograms the DNA that's totally experimental makes almost everyone sick that takes it. There's
[1:20:56.480 --> 1:21:03.600]  been deaths. I mean, this is crazy. And so they're having the CDC head and others come out and say,
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:07.600]  oh, the mask is better than vaccines because they want to keep the crisis going. They want to keep
[1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:16.080]  the lockdown going until Gates comes out with his beyond vaccine, his cellular reprogramming,
[1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:18.880]  GMO mutation injection.
[1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:26.080]  Well, one last thing. I was going to plug some products, but you just took a lot of time with
[1:21:26.080 --> 1:21:31.280]  the products. And I don't want to take from other collars, but I probably have 10 of your shirts
[1:21:31.280 --> 1:21:35.120]  and probably take 15 of your supplements daily. So I want to thank you for that.
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:38.640]  Well, brother, you've kept us on air despite all the enemy attacks. And God bless you. We
[1:21:38.640 --> 1:21:42.160]  couldn't do it without you. But your point is great, though. Hey, what do you think of Trump
[1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:46.960]  coming out and saying he's for a vaccine? And now he's got Gates and the Democrats saying,
[1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:51.520]  don't take his vaccine. Don't you see the genius of him coming out to end the lockdown and saying,
[1:21:51.520 --> 1:21:55.600]  we'll take this other vaccine that isn't the one Gates made to cut Gates out? I mean,
[1:21:55.600 --> 1:21:59.120]  I see what he's doing. It doesn't mean I think it's a safe gamble, but it's definitely working
[1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:05.440]  right now. No, I think it makes total sense. So I listened to your analysis because I wouldn't
[1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:09.280]  ever broke it down that way. But like I said, I don't want to take too much time. But I do want
[1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:13.920]  to get your input on one of the one other thing from around the end of 2019 to the beginning
[1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:18.000]  of 2020, all of the CEOs and every and all these businesses from business.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:23.040]  Quitting and cashing out quitting and cashing out. What do you make of that now that we're
[1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:28.880]  six months into this and no one's talking about that anymore? They had plans on the shelf 20
[1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:34.000]  years ago to release a bio weapon and trigger a lockdown. The first bio weapon would not be that
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:38.880]  deadly. It would just be a simulant to practice the lockdown. Then once that lockdown happened,
[1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:42.640]  they would then release another bio weapon within a year or two that would actually kill
[1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:46.960]  billions. So this is all a dress rehearsal for them wiping everybody out. So now that they've
[1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:53.520]  gotten to this point, the 1300 CEOs are moving to armored fortresses in really the big secret
[1:22:53.520 --> 1:22:58.960]  place is central Canada out in the middle of nowhere. They're building armored redoubts, New
[1:22:58.960 --> 1:23:04.880]  Zealand, Tasmania, Hawaii. That's why they've got Marshall on Hawaii is for Zuckerberg and others.
[1:23:05.760 --> 1:23:10.160]  And so they've all been led on. I was led into this by research scientists were working high
[1:23:10.160 --> 1:23:16.960]  level at UT with Dr. Pionka, who was openly planning, you know, praising 90% dying from an
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:20.800]  airborne Ebola even got visited by the FBI after we exposed him. I talked to some of the folks that
[1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:28.720]  worked with him and others and they they were already moved out to hunt and out to curvil in
[1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:33.120]  places because they they were thinking it could be released at any time because they were big
[1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:36.240]  liberals. They were actually led in on the meetings about how they're going to kill everybody.
[1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:43.520]  So they're moving back. They're preparing to kill everybody. So yeah, folks, I mean,
[1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:47.920]  they're going to kill you and your family. I mean, just get ready. I'm trying to stop them here. I'm
[1:23:47.920 --> 1:23:55.360]  sorry. It's all true. Remember, the Global Lockdowns are witnessing the Black Lives Matter
[1:23:55.360 --> 1:24:01.280]  Antifa riots and racial attacks. We're all seeing are publicly directed by a handful
[1:24:01.920 --> 1:24:08.400]  of top billionaires led by people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, of course, Tim Cook and others.
[1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:14.480]  They set up there with their trillions of dollars they control in their companies and
[1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:20.240]  they're hundreds of billions of dollars individually leveraging that against us and trying to create
[1:24:20.240 --> 1:24:26.000]  an artificial revolution against local government and police. And the mayors are again, they're
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:30.800]  playing their political game to try to trigger the complete breakdown of the United States and Western
[1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:35.440]  Europe show these billionaires could come in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar.
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:39.360]  That's why I'm so angry that these globalists because when you're looking at them, they're the
[1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:44.400]  ones that sit in their councils and have decided to run these plans against us. They are here
[1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:51.600]  enemies of humanity and must be dealt with. It's us or them period in the area during a pandemic.
[1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:58.880]  We look to local health authorities. So for example, in the US, it would be CDC for guidelines around
[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:04.320]  medical misinformation in a narrow way, which could cause harm in the real world.
[1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:09.600]  That was a few months ago and the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai made a very important statement.
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:13.920]  All the other big tech ads met the exact same statement because it comes out of the UN that
[1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:20.080]  they follow the guidance of the WHO and or local government. What they mean is in the United States
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:24.400]  other areas of the world, cities that have been unionized or that have actually signed on to
[1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:28.560]  UN memorandums and agreements. So what he's saying is, oh, we follow the United Nations
[1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:33.440]  of the global government and then we've got little stakeholder parents. That's how the UN works,
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:38.080]  that then give the illusion of it being local. But then when your doctors or your scientists,
[1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:43.200]  your virologists come out and say that COVID-19 has massively exaggerated the power grab,
[1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:48.400]  they get silenced, their press conferences get muzzled just like they do in communist China.
[1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:54.320]  That's what's really going on here. The planets have aligned globally. They've aligned nationally.
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:26:00.000]  They've aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly, spiritually. We are living
[1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:06.480]  at a point in human development that's beside the entire future destiny of our species. So that's
[1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:13.440]  why big tech control with the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to dumb us down, isolate
[1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:19.040]  us, make us depressed, make us alone and try to control every aspect of our lives, literally
[1:26:19.040 --> 1:26:23.680]  brainwashing us with the stimuli that they put forward because they do not want us to take our
[1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:29.920]  birthright, not just of Americana, but of true Christendom and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:34.880]  They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and
[1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:40.240]  life extension, and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:46.560]  credits and through a social credit score. This is their plan. We must come together and awaken
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:27:06.560]  out of our trance and say, no, we must embrace God. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:16.800]  InfoWars.com, because there's a war on for your mind. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:19.920]  Go right back to your phone calls in just a moment, but first, this is just in
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:26.080]  Louisville, Grand Jury, and Dites, one of the officers involved in Breonna Taylor's death.
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:28.240]  That probably won't be enough, so the city will probably burn.
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:35.280]  Protesters demand justice for her. Hundreds of protesters gathered during a rally demanding
[1:27:35.280 --> 1:27:41.200]  justice for Breonna Taylor outside the Kentucky State Capitol. A Louisville Grand Jury indicted
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:46.560]  only one of three officers involved in the fatal shooting of the 26-year-old Breonna Taylor Wednesday.
[1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:53.920]  Police investigators, Britt Hankinson, Miles Cosgrove, and Jonathan Mattingly
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:28:01.280]  fired their weapons during the botched operation in which police shot and killed Taylor. A 15,000
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:07.120]  bond was set for Hankerson. Hankerson was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment.
[1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:11.520]  The court announced Wednesday no charges were announced against the other officers.
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:16.560]  I think you'll see rioting. That's what Soros has paid people to do.
[1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:26.800]  All right. I'm going to go back to your phone calls. Some other really interesting news here
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:31.360]  in the stack, but I'll get to that at the start of the next segment. That was a really good call or
[1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:37.120]  last segment, and I want listeners to understand something. I make a statement like, the globalist
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:41.760]  want to kill you and your family, and if I make that statement, you have to understand I've made
[1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:46.800]  several films on that topic, and I've shown you all the proof in films like Endgame,
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:54.560]  and that's really what they're planning to do. So I'd be lying to you if I didn't say that,
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:29:00.000]  but I think it does take a little bit of backing it up, doesn't it? You've all heard that Bill Gates
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:03.520]  wants to depopulate the planet. You've heard about Ted Turner saying, you see all the TV shows about
[1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:07.600]  humans are bad, and we need to have a world without humans. I mean, that's their mainline view now.
[1:29:09.680 --> 1:29:13.680]  26 years ago when I was first talking about it, it was only in their own publications,
[1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:18.640]  their own white papers. But now you see headlines in the Wall Street Journal,
[1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:23.920]  dreaming of the end of humanity, and NBC's similar headlines. So now they've externalized all this.
[1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:29.360]  You have to understand though how they're going to do it. First, they teach you not to love yourself
[1:29:29.360 --> 1:29:33.360]  and to hate yourself and learn to lie down and let them run over you so you don't have a life force
[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:38.640]  and a survival instinct. And then once they've done that, they organize groups to be divided,
[1:29:38.640 --> 1:29:42.160]  they try to shut down the economy, they try to pump us with all these psychotropic drugs,
[1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:48.000]  they make a suicidal, so we give up hope and are not connected to God. They want to give
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:53.120]  up on the future, not to have children, not to bet on humanity. That's their main mission,
[1:29:53.760 --> 1:29:58.240]  because they're here to again depopulate, kill, steal, and destroy. That's the spirit they follow.
[1:30:00.160 --> 1:30:06.240]  But they've rolled out plans about how they're going to manage the new controlled societies,
[1:30:06.240 --> 1:30:09.840]  and then they tell you, oh, because of climate change, there's going to be bio
[1:30:11.680 --> 1:30:16.240]  events that kill billions of people. Of course, they don't add, they're going to do it.
[1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:20.960]  But in other white papers, they do admit they're going to do it. So it's all there, 95% of it,
[1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:25.520]  they just don't finish the statement, but it's all completely obvious. Then you get deeper
[1:30:25.520 --> 1:30:31.280]  their literature, they all admit it. And so once they've got robots tending the fields,
[1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:35.920]  once they've got robot cars driving up down the roads, once Amazon has 100 story buildings
[1:30:35.920 --> 1:30:39.760]  with thousands of drones flying out an hour, delivering everything because we're not essential.
[1:30:39.760 --> 1:30:42.320]  And because of lockdowns, because of the flu or other viruses,
[1:30:42.320 --> 1:30:48.240]  then we've been taught that we're not essential. Then they can morally get us, they say,
[1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:55.040]  to sign on to giving up our rights, to not have children or become sterilized or sterilize our
[1:30:55.040 --> 1:31:00.800]  children to get credits. So that's one phase of this. But they debate whether they go into
[1:31:00.800 --> 1:31:04.720]  that phase and just sterilize us and drug us out and kind of slowly phase us out over the next 50
[1:31:04.720 --> 1:31:13.280]  years, or get the control grid, get the robots in place, have a bunch of smaller lockdowns to
[1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:19.360]  train us to stay in place. So when the big one hits, we stay in our houses and we die. And a lot
[1:31:19.360 --> 1:31:23.440]  of the intel is they're going to use electromagnetics to actually kill us. We'll think it's a bio weapon
[1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:28.880]  while we're dying. And they'll just move down the different paths with the electromagnetics
[1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:33.520]  killing us. It'll be carried out by things like robot trash trucks. And you'll just think it's
[1:31:33.520 --> 1:31:37.680]  robot trash trucks going around. But really, they're going to have high energy weapons loaded up in
[1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:43.040]  the top, frying you and your family. And then when you die in a few weeks, the same trash trucks are
[1:31:43.040 --> 1:31:48.240]  going to pull up and robots will unload out of the back and then go get your dead bodies and put you
[1:31:48.240 --> 1:31:55.520]  in bags and then take you out and throw you into the back. So they've got a whole plan. And so,
[1:31:55.520 --> 1:32:00.160]  again, they're going to urge you into the super cities where you think you're safe. They're going
[1:32:00.160 --> 1:32:04.080]  to lock you down and claiming it's all about surveilling the bio threat. And the more you get
[1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:09.680]  locked down, the worse the bio threat gets, okay? And this is really, again, just a giant execution
[1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:18.000]  grid. And they let the doctors and the scientists in on this. So a lot of leftist scientists are
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:21.360]  led in on the higher level because they're like, yeah, let's get rid of people. Yeah, it's cool.
[1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:27.280]  But it's more academic than it's more something that's theoretical. Then these people tend to have
[1:32:27.280 --> 1:32:31.920]  children. And then they're in the meetings and they get into a higher level meeting where they go,
[1:32:31.920 --> 1:32:37.920]  we're having a tabletop exercise where a race specific mouse pox is released that kills 98%.
[1:32:38.640 --> 1:32:42.480]  And you know, it's sad it's probably going to happen, but it will save the earth. How do we
[1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:47.200]  contain the populations and keep the reactors from melting down and keep the crowds from getting
[1:32:47.200 --> 1:32:52.240]  out of the cities. So now we're going to work on the next year on a plan. And here we've gotten in
[1:32:52.240 --> 1:32:56.000]  from the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency and the Ford Foundation,
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:01.200]  Rand Corporation here to help us. And then you work with them for six months and you find out what
[1:33:01.200 --> 1:33:07.120]  you're doing is creating the battle plan to kill everybody. I have met and had dinner and stayed
[1:33:07.120 --> 1:33:14.960]  with people who have been in those meetings. Okay. I mean, folks, they're going to kill everybody.
[1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:19.600]  I mean, they're going to kill you and your family. So I mean, people, I know people you think I was
[1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:24.480]  crazy telling you all this because I mean, watch in game folks, I tell you all in a two and a half
[1:33:24.480 --> 1:33:29.120]  hour film, everything that was going to happen and 70% of it's happened now. Just as I said,
[1:33:29.120 --> 1:33:35.760]  you want the rest of it to happen? When you're Jeff Bezos and you're Ted Turner and you're Bill
[1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:41.360]  Clinton and you're George Soros and your Bill Gates and you've got trillions of dollars together
[1:33:41.360 --> 1:33:45.360]  and you've got the whole planet through fraud and the public's all stupid and dumbed down.
[1:33:45.360 --> 1:33:48.400]  They all talk about how much they hate going out in public and seeing the general public,
[1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:51.440]  how much they hate going to national parks and seeing you there and how you're eating up all
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:57.440]  their food and how you're a big problem and how they want to get rid of you. And so when you
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:02.480]  sit there and let them plan all of this and then do nothing back to them, they believe it's their
[1:34:02.480 --> 1:34:10.240]  right to do this to you. Now they're so pissed on their timelines because of what I've done
[1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:17.280]  and what others have done, exposing the timeline of this that they're going to have real problems
[1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:24.080]  executing this. They've done the math. They know that they're going to end up getting fished out
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:29.200]  of their holes by whoever's left and they're not going to escape justice and that's really our mission
[1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:32.800]  is to make them understand they're not going to get away. The problem is they have a plan B
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:42.560]  and that's the issue. Here's the deal. We've cornered these people
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:49.200]  and they may just skip to the end and release a super bio weapon early. They were planning
[1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:53.120]  a straight jacket and trained us to be slaves because they're orderly. They wanted to be orderly
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:56.880]  how they kill us and have us kind of buy into it and change and acclimate, you know,
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:02.000]  have a few years to get ready and take our vaccines and take our tracker chips and everything. But
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:08.640]  I realize and I've been watching them closely that I think we may have pushed them
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:12.480]  just to go to the end game right away and release the weapons.
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:19.120]  So just remember who killed you and your family
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:26.640]  because some of you are going to survive and then at that point you're going to need to carry out
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:35.840]  justice. I wish we could stop these people but I wish we could stop killing billions of babies.
[1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:38.800]  I wish we could stop selling out to China. I wish we could stop being Satanist.
[1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:43.760]  But we're going to be judged and God's removing his protection from us right now. So
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:48.640]  these globalists see the ugly strip malls and they see your little house, they see your little
[1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:51.760]  swimming pool and they just think you're ugly and they don't like you because they're projecting
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:55.680]  their own hatred of themselves onto you and they just have this view of this pastoral,
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:35:59.600]  beautiful future world and they're going to have life extension but you can't have it because
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:05.040]  that'd be too many people and they've just decided to wipe everybody out and you know,
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:08.160]  I don't agree with them because I know they're a bunch of evil people, they're worse than the
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:15.200]  general public but the general public are a bunch of self-absorbed, stupid, lazy,
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:28.480]  empty, non-giving sociopaths and you are conjuring your own destruction so it's going to be bad one
[1:36:28.480 --> 1:36:31.520]  way or the other and I just don't want to be negative here but lying to you would be even
[1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:37.040]  more negative so just get ready, things are never going to be the same and if we can hold
[1:36:37.040 --> 1:36:41.760]  them back, maybe we got 10, 15, 20 years but I don't think so, I think the killing's about to
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:45.520]  start, I think they're going to start killing everybody so get ready and all you left is get
[1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:53.600]  ready for your bosses to kill you. Real power comes from the grassroots and real power comes
[1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:58.080]  from experience and I've been in the fight more than 26 years against the globalist so it's
[1:36:58.080 --> 1:37:01.920]  important for listeners and viewers to understand when you support info wars that keep us on the
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:06.560]  air you're not supporting a news outlet that has sources and so we're able to always tell you what's
[1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:13.200]  coming when others can't it's because we are studying the enemy and doing the original analysis
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:17.600]  that gets picked up by trump intelligence agencies and major corporations that are part of the
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:22.000]  resistance that are part of the resistance to the overarching globalist system so I have to tell
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:28.640]  you how the hierarchy works in many cases info wars is at the head we're not the tail that means
[1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:33.600]  you're at the head and that's why your support of us is so critical biden and his constellation of
[1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:37.760]  criminals have told us and many others that if they get elected they're not just going to shut
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:42.320]  down info wars they're going to shut you down the long depression forced inoculations and more
[1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:46.960]  so now more than ever keep info wars on the air with high quality products at infowarstore.com
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:54.720]  last week Tucker Carlson came out and said america is becoming the soviet union in many ways
[1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:59.120]  we're worse than the soviet union the soviet union couldn't dream of what big tech can do
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:04.000]  surveilling and censoring us and we're gonna get a lot worse than the soviet union when it comes
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:09.120]  to forced inoculations and the medical tyranny being rolled out by the united nations now in
[1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:14.400]  control of what you can and can't say online the truth is ladies and gentlemen america is fighting
[1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:20.320]  for its life and the enemy's number one mission is to get trump out of office and number two
[1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:26.000]  is to silence info wars because we understand just how diabolical they are just how evil they are
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:31.120]  and we want mince words we know who the globalist are we've got their number and we know how to beat
[1:38:31.120 --> 1:38:37.040]  them and we cover it seven days a week live at info wars and it's only because of your support
[1:38:37.040 --> 1:38:40.800]  so keep spreading the word keep praying for us and take advantage of the sales and get great
[1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:46.000]  products at info wars store dot com now the globalists are hoping you don't visit info wars store dot com
[1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:56.800]  and perhaps most cruelly of all if donald trump has his way the complications from
[1:38:56.800 --> 1:39:05.840]  covid-19 which are well beyond what they should be it's estimated that two hundred million people
[1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:13.040]  have died two hundred million people have died probably by the time i finish this talk right
[1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:18.800]  after joe biden made that statement that more than 60 of america has died from covid-19 when it's
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:24.480]  not even 200 000 reality he would want to say six million have lung scarring and heart damage
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:28.240]  it's all made up but you know where you got it the mainstream media that continues to actually
[1:39:28.240 --> 1:39:35.360]  say things like that they said that four percent of america would be dead already of course it's point
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:42.720]  000 000 and then add a number because the numbers vary it's a real virus just like people being struck
[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:48.800]  by lightning is real but to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:57.760]  control introducing info wars life pure turmeric extract this is taken under the tongue it is pure
[1:39:57.760 --> 1:40:04.560]  turmeric it goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a

[1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:15.280]  the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach so it's more of an
[1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:20.640]  intense delivery system the two formulas are different but both are concentrates and our first

[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:57.920]  in pennsylvania my man uh second off uh what trump's been saying it's great but you know i just keep
[1:41:57.920 --> 1:42:04.160]  on getting aggressive you should just stay aggressive and get more aggressive with i mean no i agree but
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:10.400]  i mean we've said call out china call out bill gates call out the new order he's starting to do it
[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:14.800]  i know if i i do something wrong i'm gonna end up in jail or go here to there
[1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:18.720]  and what makes these people so special well that's another question by the way chuck you got a friend
[1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:23.120]  in texas why why have it came out of china in the wuhan lab that's been confirmed now
[1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:28.880]  why would our media block us as citizens saying or even the president that just shows how crazy
[1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:33.920]  they are now they think they control reality they don't yeah they turn everything backwards and i
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:38.960]  you know i i've got a thing i do myself uh you know i'm a hard-working blue-collar man
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:43.680]  but uh i call it the white collar movement i i take the path three path to white t-shirts and
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:51.920]  a sharpie and i write things i have one we the people matter uh 1776 with the greater than 1984
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:57.680]  or covid 1984 and i tell you those three on top of your shirt that's what i'm learning right now
[1:42:57.680 --> 1:43:01.760]  yeah we're your death don't try beautiful brother you know i've been thinking of the right shirt
[1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:06.080]  i think we the people matter it's just everybody that's the part that's better than all lives matter
[1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:09.920]  it's we the people matter because we are the people together and we come together
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:16.400]  we've got the power that's why they want to divide us yeah but you know it might be dark times but
[1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:20.560]  we all need to stand together like vikings but you know if it's gonna happen and we're going to
[1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:25.360]  meet our maker make peace with your maker stand like a viking and just hit him head off absolutely
[1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:29.840]  and look folks when i get up here and i say the things i say i look back on ago that sounds crazy
[1:43:29.840 --> 1:43:34.720]  but that's what the globalists in the u-inter saying i mean they have articles in the wall
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:39.520]  street journals saying it's time to get rid of all humans and then i i've heard this from top people
[1:43:40.560 --> 1:43:47.120]  they try to recruit my dad in like 1966 because he was top of his class in the top test scores
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:52.320]  at the university of texas he was in plan two they called them in the top test score kids six of them
[1:43:52.320 --> 1:43:57.600]  and said we're gonna bring in eugenics and world government my dad said no thank you but i mean
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:03.120]  this is the cult folks thank you chuck it's absolutely out of control and and i know you
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:07.520]  don't want to kill everybody you like people so you're like this can't be true it is true
[1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:14.800]  this is a sick power cult of these ultra rich people it's like nero they're pretty sure burned
[1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:19.920]  down part of rome because he wanted to expand his palace he did by the way expand his palace
[1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:25.040]  but i mean it's like why would you do that because they think that they i saw a denis rodman
[1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:28.800]  video that i think i sent the producers i didn't see on the list yesterday but remind me to play
[1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:33.360]  it tomorrow it's a five minute clip with mike tyson and he describes going to north korea
[1:44:35.280 --> 1:44:39.360]  and he just says what a great time he had and he doesn't care about the problems
[1:44:39.360 --> 1:44:46.400]  and it's the most satanic video because i like kim jong un
[1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:54.160]  and it's great and you're hearing this about the great time they're having
[1:44:54.880 --> 1:44:59.120]  and how much he loves partying with him and then a mile away are people starving to death and
[1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:03.120]  oppression when they have food they starve them to control them and i'm just sitting there looking
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:07.200]  at denis rodman and mike tyson is sitting there going i want to meet kim jong un
[1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:16.400]  and it's his nfl player and mike tyson this other guy and they're so disconnected
[1:45:19.440 --> 1:45:23.360]  and so separated from the people that it made me want to throw up
[1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:28.400]  like it's a fascination like oh that's really a cool dictatorship
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:34.560]  that these guys will stand up for you to earn a attorney hell no imagine being married to one of
[1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:40.400]  these guys the britain guy the white guy all of them i mean imagine being so empty and you live in
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.560]  la or on other people and all you do is virtually signal to each other and drive around your
[1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:50.480]  maseratis and then talk and brag how you hang out with a dictator that literally makes them sell
[1:45:50.480 --> 1:45:59.200]  their children for meat so he can dance around and sing karaoke they have no spiritual connection
[1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:05.440]  to god you know how dangerous that is in front of god's eyes i want to be denis rodman and people
[1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:10.000]  say oh he went and i was saying i see what denis rodman you know getting at least open a peace
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:14.960]  deal i don't think denis rodman even knows that's what i'm saying he's so selfish that he doesn't
[1:46:14.960 --> 1:46:27.200]  even care it's like it's beyond it's just they're just disconnected folks they're spiritually blind
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:34.800]  and god help us and and that's what leads to all the pedophilia and the rest of it it's about the
[1:46:34.800 --> 1:46:40.320]  selfishness it's about well my conscience i don't want to do that but this is their mind well
[1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:44.000]  they don't want to do it but their conscience tells them not to do it so this evil thing says you
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:49.600]  need to do it then they get into it then they're bound by it and just imagine being these people
[1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:55.120]  even worse imagine living under them which is we're about to be living under them
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:47:00.800]  you know they're under covid lockdown boy kim jung un loves the covid lockdown every dictator loves it
[1:47:03.840 --> 1:47:08.800]  brendan and georgia thanks for holding i really appreciate it go ahead thank you alex and god
[1:47:08.800 --> 1:47:15.040]  bless you sir uh so i called in uh hopefully to make a couple quick points the main point is
[1:47:15.040 --> 1:47:22.000]  i wanted to raise awareness uh with the other vet uh the the alana va here uh in particular
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:28.320]  uh i found is rationing uh health care now and so if it was difficult for a veteran to even
[1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:34.400]  receive limited care before it's definitely not going to happen now because of this covid situation
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:41.520]  uh i have uh called the white house hotline trump's white house hotline that he set up a few years
[1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:48.000]  ago and filed the complaint and uh and so that's an ongoing battle we're trying to get some doctors
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  fired because they're lying to veterans and they're telling kakamemi bs stories to veterans about why
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:59.520]  they can't come into the clinic and you know trump signed a bill but congress didn't pass it and it's
[1:47:59.520 --> 1:48:04.000]  already a law and and you know the once again the left hand doesn't know what the right hand's doing
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:12.480]  these are md's these are alleged md's brendan i'm glad you called because there's a lot of check boxes
[1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:18.480]  why the u n why the rock of fellers why the roth child's under gates launched this the global
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:23.840]  digital society the digital passport the social credit score the getting rid of cash the making
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:29.360]  is not essential the locking center houses but one of the other big ones is the medical tyranny
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:33.840]  of locking up nursing homes not letting family come but then putting covid patients in there
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:38.080]  knowing the only group it really kills his old people that are deficient in vitamins and minerals
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:43.040]  and then getting the death numbers to set the precedent to then corrupt all the nursing homes
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:47.440]  and hospitals to say we'll arrest you in the future if you don't do what we say because you
[1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:53.520]  murdered those old people that was a corruption on purpose but it gets worse now we're seven months
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:49:01.200]  in to most cities and most hospitals and most providers saying here's an example i got two dental
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:08.000]  implants put in before covid they put the post in every time i try to go have the crown put on
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:13.680]  oh we can't that's non essential for you to have teeth okay now now and i don't look at the numbers
[1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:17.520]  90 plus percent of medical procedures are not being done many of them are really essential
[1:49:18.160 --> 1:49:25.040]  my i have family that had a assist on their ovary they made them wait four months while this went
[1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:30.880]  on and got bigger and out of control and finally let her go in and get it dealt with so so that's
[1:49:30.880 --> 1:49:35.920]  what this is and so you're paying all this insurance money and and you went signed up as a
[1:49:35.920 --> 1:49:39.840]  you're a veteran you paid with your your blood sweat and tears you're supposed to be getting this
[1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:45.680]  trump says it and they use it to sit on their ass and play golf and it's so damn evil it's a fraud
[1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:51.920]  it's rationing health care like the nih like the national health service does in england our nih is
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:58.240]  becoming the national health service of england the nhe so you're absolutely right brother is that
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:06.640]  not outrageous it's completely outrageous alex and it's just a huge disservice absolutely uh it's
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:13.360]  just i used to advocate for veterans out west i'm from idaho originally and uh and it's just a
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:19.040]  travesty i mean i i knew what i was dealing with already and then now to have this happening
[1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:25.920]  and and so i'm doing i'm doing my part to try to raise awareness to it and think about this think
[1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:30.720]  about this brother remember they said oh if someone's having a heart attack don't necessitate them
[1:50:30.720 --> 1:50:34.880]  because uh we don't need them at the hospital right now let them die again it's all just
[1:50:34.880 --> 1:50:39.200]  getting us used to getting rid of our standard good loving american procedures that are based
[1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:45.840]  in british common law and flushing 800 years of war that we had to enforce that freedom taken from
[1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:53.440]  us like that brother alex you're exactly right the words are contraction consolidation and vertical
[1:50:53.440 --> 1:51:00.160]  integration that is their modus operandi that is exactly what they're doing on all levels they are
[1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:05.440]  they and saying because there's too many of us have you seen the new national health service in
[1:51:05.440 --> 1:51:10.800]  england the national health service now says when you give someone cpr you have to smother their face
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:17.680]  but i'm a dual citizen i'm a citizen of ireland but i was born in idaho so i'm an american first
[1:51:17.680 --> 1:51:24.720]  so believe me i understand the the dynamics here and so i'm an american first i wore the uniform
[1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:29.920]  for this country i wore the uniform for brendan we love you and the country's under attack we're
[1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:34.240]  going to come through this the tyrants are about to win more calls of dr mccollis thank you brendan
[1:51:34.240 --> 1:51:42.800]  we'll be right back stay with us we've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown and it's
[1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:48.160]  horrible and it's killing millions of people via starvation but the good news is it's caused a
[1:51:48.160 --> 1:51:55.040]  planetary awakening as well the general public all over the planet hate bill gates he's the most
[1:51:55.040 --> 1:52:01.600]  unpopular person on earth people know he's not a doctor people know he's a eugenicist the population
[1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:07.680]  knows that his vaccines that he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses polio sterilants and
[1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:13.920]  more it's even in the associated press so now they're beginning to understand that we the people
[1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:19.680]  know that there is a corporate global government and the beast top tech billionaires sit in meetings
[1:52:19.680 --> 1:52:25.840]  and decide to pull the type of race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing so remember
[1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:32.240]  that and let them know that we know who they are and what they've done and we hold them responsible
[1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:38.320]  for the collapse of civilization they are the enemies of humanity they want you dead
[1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:46.720]  the answer to 1984 is 1776
[1:52:54.960 --> 1:52:57.040]  info wars has been banned
[1:52:57.040 --> 1:52:59.920]  and arrested

[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:22.560]  mask above your nose keep the mask above your nose i'm like oh i'm so over this and my second question
[1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:28.880]  is how do you feel our president should handle china and now and i like i said god bless you alex it's
[1:56:28.880 --> 1:56:33.040]  a pleasure pleasure to talk to you god bless well god bless you thank you wow those are big
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:37.840]  questions i think the president should be handling china just like he is very steadily trying to get
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:42.560]  them to do the right thing uh he should be rounding up their agents inside the u.s he should expand
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:49.600]  prosecutions of their american operatives uh for espionage and watch the rats leave the sinking ship
[1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:55.680]  up but i would also uh you know separately on the subject of family go set your family member
[1:56:55.680 --> 1:57:00.320]  it was going to be 15 days because the hospitals were going to be full we'd have 2.5 million dead
[1:57:00.320 --> 1:57:04.640]  first they said 5 million dead than 2.5 million dead than 2.3 million dead than 2.2 million dead
[1:57:04.640 --> 1:57:09.680]  they say it's say it's 200 000 now and you can show them articles or 94 died of something else
[1:57:09.680 --> 1:57:14.000]  they just said they had covered like this poor baby is born with its intestine outside its body
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:19.760]  and it and it died because of blood loss and and the doctors you know went public and said they put
[1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:24.640]  on the death certificate of covid it's not true uh 90 plus percent of the test it turns out
[1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:28.880]  are false positive they engineered the test to be false positive that way it's a problem that
[1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:33.120]  could never be fixed trump figured that out so he goes okay let's have a vaccine to reopen the
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:38.000]  economy that's going to kill millions if we don't they go oh no our vaccine won't be ready for a
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:41.760]  year or two more years because they want to keep the lockdown going that's the real goal
[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:48.800]  the vaccine is secondary so i get what uh trump is doing i do not agree that we should
[1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:52.480]  have forced vaccines trump does not say that either i think it's a very dangerous game the
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:56.240]  president's playing but i don't just think trump did that i was let in on that by the
[1:57:56.240 --> 1:58:01.440]  white house on these big issues they've let me in on it um and i said can i tell the public this
[1:58:01.440 --> 1:58:05.840]  they said yeah i just don't tell you tell people who told you and uh you know i was attacking
[1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:11.200]  trump over the gun stuff and then one nra member called me nra board member and then another nra
[1:58:11.200 --> 1:58:15.920]  board member called me up and you know invited me out to their house uh and then they basically gave
[1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:20.000]  me the same speech when you know hey don't have your crew in here let's have a little talk in here
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:25.120]  around the kitchen table and i got the same talk um and uh and i've gotten some calls in the same
[1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:30.560]  talk from people that trump was gonna do this with a vaccine uh and so he wants you to know uh
[1:58:30.560 --> 1:58:33.600]  through us that that's going on so that's that's pretty heavy and i told him i said
[1:58:33.600 --> 1:58:38.080]  i think it's a very dangerous game but it usually seems to work trump knows what he's doing so
[1:58:38.080 --> 1:58:41.680]  god bless you i really appreciate your call ma'am all right dr mercola's with us a few
[1:58:41.680 --> 1:58:45.280]  segments we'll look forward to that we'll go back to your calls i promise i really appreciate you

[2:00:16.880 --> 2:00:26.960]  generation triumph and this generation won't you have to stand on the shoulders of all those that
[2:00:26.960 --> 2:00:32.000]  came before you all right we're really excited for the next three segments and i'll go back to
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:38.960]  your calls into the next hour that dr joseph mccullough i won't go over his whole bio he is a
[2:00:38.960 --> 2:00:45.840]  medical doctor he is undoubtedly the number one voice the last 30 years on the internet reaching
[2:00:45.840 --> 2:00:52.080]  billions of people uh exposing the dangers of vaccines giving people solutions on how to protect
[2:00:52.080 --> 2:00:56.720]  themselves outside the mainline medical system and so much more he's been on everything from
[2:00:56.720 --> 2:01:01.840]  abc news with peter jennings to you name it he's done it and we always enjoy having him here with
[2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:04.960]  us last time he was on let me just get this out of the way because i haven't talked about the shed
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:10.320]  outside of this morning to talk about it and then when i saw mccullough just now on skype i thought
[2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:13.840]  let me get this out of the way because he was excited when he was on a month ago that oh you're
[2:01:13.840 --> 2:01:17.280]  one of the first interviews joe rogan's gonna have on spotify is gonna be you because joe had told me
[2:01:17.280 --> 2:01:21.360]  that when he'd already moved to austin just didn't want folks to know that he was here months ago
[2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:26.880]  officially moved here uh at the end of last month and it moved his family here but he was
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:30.960]  already here most of the time and joe hasn't lied to people and i haven't lied to you either things
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:37.440]  change um what you've seen in the news about the rebellion at spotify israel in new york
[2:01:38.080 --> 2:01:41.360]  that's where they do the sales and all the media stuff the technical stuff is in
[2:01:41.360 --> 2:01:47.440]  stockham sweden they've they've actually wanted joe basically taken off air not just his quote
[2:01:47.440 --> 2:01:53.760]  transphobic stuff saying we're biological men we're biological women and so people say well
[2:01:53.760 --> 2:01:58.240]  where are you on the joe rogan show hey listen that's all in flux and i'm not worried about it we
[2:01:58.240 --> 2:02:03.360]  have this audience we have you we're reaching out to people i can tell you joe is very frustrated
[2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:08.800]  by all this uh joe did sign his contract again whoever he wants and and i was put in there
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:14.800]  as an example and uh i'm gonna i'm gonna leave it that i've talked to joe you know at link to the
[2:02:14.800 --> 2:02:18.960]  last week uh and i'm not just bringing up joe rogan's he's the number one podcast from the world
[2:02:20.640 --> 2:02:25.520]  just a name draw i'm bringing it up because they're coming for everybody they want they're coming
[2:02:25.520 --> 2:02:31.040]  for everybody that's popular to make you be their mouthpiece and to not be an open free form discussion
[2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:35.840]  this is so dangerous and i actually pitched dr joseph mercola to joe and i was talking to him a
[2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:39.600]  few weeks ago i said you want to have this mercola on because he asked me he says well is it a real
[2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:44.080]  virus or are you saying it's a hoax i'm like no it's it's it's it's it's manufactured so the gates
[2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:48.640]  and people can own it in my view control it if you had deficiency it can kill you it's a bad
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:54.400]  pneumonia uh but you know the statistically uh it looks like it's not as strong as demonia but
[2:02:54.400 --> 2:02:57.760]  it's a power grab and you know then joe's like okay well well then what guest should i have i'm
[2:02:57.760 --> 2:03:02.480]  gonna go you ought to have her colon and you will see how that happens but the reason i raise that is
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:09.280]  these type of shows are extremely important and i know the listeners get that but but we've been
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:12.800]  running around like chickens with our heads cut off for so long as the censorship's intensified
[2:03:12.800 --> 2:03:19.280]  the last five years to now there's not many places left like mercola dot com or stop covid cold dot
[2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:23.680]  com there's not many places like info wars dot com or news wars dot com they actually get big traffic
[2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:27.920]  and actually have experts on and now they're censoring individual facebook users and it's
[2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:32.160]  really rolling out and it will be the truth that sets us free so i wanted to get dr mercola before
[2:03:32.160 --> 2:03:37.760]  we get into the latest developments and last week fouchy finally saying you've got to have d3 and
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:42.160]  you know you've got to have to see and all that uh obviously a lot of medical pressure on him to
[2:03:42.160 --> 2:03:46.000]  do you know to stop saying like the un says that it doesn't help you that's like saying fish don't
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:51.120]  need water to live in or plants don't need sunlight or plants don't need carbon dioxide it's an outrageous
[2:03:51.120 --> 2:03:55.600]  statement what does the central mean but but but just your view on the state of the world today
[2:03:55.600 --> 2:04:02.080]  politically uh the massive censorship that's just now ai real time surveillance is really the
[2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:07.440]  issue of what we say they're now even censoring whatsapp text messages uh that people try to send
[2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:13.120]  out of a whole range of people this is next level doctor thanks for joining us well thank you for
[2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:17.600]  having me and thank you so much for that incredible update on the rogan podcast because i was wondering
[2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:24.000]  what happened then you know rogan is not censored like you and i he's managed and i'm not sure how
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:28.720]  he's done it but he's managed to avoid that censorship and that's why he is the number one
[2:04:28.720 --> 2:04:34.800]  podcast in the world typically and especially if you go on the show i think you'll have 15 25 million
[2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:41.680]  viewers which literally is five to six hundred percent larger than the number one broadcast on
[2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:48.560]  news uh which is tucker carlson i mean literally six times more viewers so he is one of the hopes
[2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:53.440]  we have that's spreading the truth out there i'm so glad that that you know you're likely going to
[2:04:53.440 --> 2:04:56.960]  be on and you're good friends with him and you live close to him in austin so well he's a good guy
[2:04:56.960 --> 2:05:00.800]  i don't know he's really i don't want to get into his private stuff because he said i could but then
[2:05:00.800 --> 2:05:05.520]  the media spends it he's genuinely really freaked out when he saw that top chinese scientist the
[2:05:05.520 --> 2:05:09.920]  words of the WHO get censored when tucker did it and he saw facebook block that that really freaked
[2:05:09.920 --> 2:05:16.480]  Joe out and and it should i mean this is crazy it is crazy and i i i know in the last hour you
[2:05:16.480 --> 2:05:24.240]  talked to answer one of the viewers questions uh the call and see about the uh the cdc a few weeks
[2:05:24.240 --> 2:05:30.800]  ago which really reclassified the death rate to only six percent dying without formal comorbidities
[2:05:30.800 --> 2:05:36.640]  like diabetes or obesity or the outrageous conditions like they go shot or they had terminal
[2:05:36.640 --> 2:05:44.000]  cancer and happened to test positive for covid so that is beyond crazy literally the uh the
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:49.600]  the mainstream narrative now is that we're approaching 200 deaths in the united states
[2:05:49.600 --> 2:05:57.360]  and that died and here's the key this is how they twist the truth they're changing the prepositions
[2:05:57.360 --> 2:06:02.800]  they're using the preposition from covid 19 and that's actually incorrect it should be from the
[2:06:02.800 --> 2:06:09.040]  infection itself which is SARS-CoV-2 but they're saying it's from and that according to the cdc
[2:06:09.040 --> 2:06:14.480]  statistics is clearly inaccurate they died with which is the correct explain you're a medical
[2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:21.040]  doctor but explain how they use this legalese slowly that's important well it's it's it's
[2:06:21.040 --> 2:06:26.800]  you know they're claiming that they died from it which i mean if you just literally just understand
[2:06:26.800 --> 2:06:30.880]  what the english language says that is the sole cause and it clearly isn't i mean this even the
[2:06:30.880 --> 2:06:37.440]  cdc acknowledged that so they died with it and then as you have also mentioned these tests are
[2:06:37.440 --> 2:06:43.120]  highly controversial and the and we really aren't quite certain what the accuracy is it really depends
[2:06:43.120 --> 2:06:48.160]  on the populate the incidence of the disease in the population you're testing so that's one issue
[2:06:48.160 --> 2:06:59.840]  and then the other issue is that uh they are let me see the uh oh their conflate okay here's this is
[2:06:59.840 --> 2:07:04.880]  this is so crazy but it's a clearly part of the entire narrative which is the fear this is a fear
[2:07:04.880 --> 2:07:10.480]  they're seeking to engender the population so they can they can generate their agenda and direct
[2:07:10.480 --> 2:07:15.920]  the narrative of closing down the economy and shutting down and requiring everyone to wear
[2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:22.320]  mask and social distancing so they're saying that there's there's a million cases in the united states
[2:07:22.320 --> 2:07:30.160]  and that is an absolute destruction of the of the meaning of the word cases every time in pre in
[2:07:30.160 --> 2:07:35.120]  history we talked about case it was something who was symptomatically ill from the infection these
[2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:41.040]  are not cases these are positive individuals with positive test results nothing more here some of
[2:07:41.040 --> 2:07:45.520]  these people actually have COVID-19 if they the SARS country virus they progressed to the point
[2:07:45.520 --> 2:07:51.760]  where they're hospitalized yes but that is far less than five percent of the population and with
[2:07:51.760 --> 2:07:56.080]  that's what i'm saying somebody has black plague well yeah they've got the sores all over them
[2:07:56.080 --> 2:08:00.240]  and they're dying from it they have the infection from black plague but you were to test positive
[2:08:00.240 --> 2:08:05.280]  they found botchal botchalism on the bottom of your foot but you're not sick you don't have black plague
[2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:08.640]  well botchalism and plague are two different i know two different deals i know botchalism gets
[2:08:08.640 --> 2:08:14.160]  in the from rice or whatever yeah that's a tetanus or as opposed to but anyway the other quite
[2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:17.760]  question i know i just i mean sure i mean i know tetanus and something gets in the blood so they're
[2:08:17.760 --> 2:08:22.640]  conflicting those they're confusing massively confusing everyone believes them that they're
[2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:27.840]  using this narrative to to radically increase the amount of fear within the population and when
[2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:32.320]  you look at populations like sweden which initially we were concerned with because they had high death
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:37.280]  rates and it turns out those high death rates in sweden were a result of their failure to really
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:42.000]  address the nursing home population if they'd done that they wouldn't have had high death
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:45.680]  rates initially let's talk about how we do that and just to get back not this beginning
[2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:49.760]  to technicals i i meant black plague i didn't mean to say botchalism i know the difference
[2:08:49.760 --> 2:08:55.520]  but but explain that to people in the 30 seconds we have that that that just because someone tests
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:08:59.520]  positive for something doesn't mean they quote have it because by having it you have the symptoms
[2:08:59.520 --> 2:09:05.600]  being an infection correct well if you're assuming the test is correct and they then they do have
[2:09:05.600 --> 2:09:11.200]  or had presence of the of that uh virus or infection in their body but that doesn't mean they
[2:09:11.200 --> 2:09:16.400]  develop symptoms from it and certainly serious symptoms that require hospitalization and could
[2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:21.120]  potentially to to death so there's a there's an absolute conflation of those two terms
[2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:26.160]  to mislead the public and exactly and it's all run out of the u n and then if you question the u
[2:09:26.160 --> 2:09:30.480]  n you get banned on the internet dr joseph mercola mercola.com is our guest you can find
[2:09:30.480 --> 2:09:35.760]  stopcovidcold.com that has all the factoids all the stuff from medical doctor so you can
[2:09:35.760 --> 2:09:42.240]  share that with friends and family and educate them as the fall as the winner gets here but not
[2:09:42.240 --> 2:09:49.280]  having your vitamins and minerals can kill you if you look at the top tech billionaires and the big
[2:09:49.280 --> 2:09:54.480]  banks that finance and control them to a man and to a woman they believe there's too many people on
[2:09:54.480 --> 2:09:59.120]  the earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountaintop or a national park
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:03.760]  they have to look at us the common people they have to look at the proletariat they have to look
[2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:09.360]  at the scum that's why they love the lockdown putting muscles on us that gives them a big thrill
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:15.440]  controlling where we can go what we can do bankrupting main street bankrupting small towns all of it
[2:10:15.440 --> 2:10:21.440]  is a vertical integration consolidation so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender
[2:10:21.440 --> 2:10:27.200]  which is taking sterilant vaccines day one ladies and gentlemen all the games are over
[2:10:27.200 --> 2:10:32.240]  play times over they used all the entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance and now the
[2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:37.520]  spider's moving in for the kill you know this i know this it's all out in the open the question
[2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:42.000]  is what are we going to do about it well the first thing is identify the enemy identify the enemy
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:48.880]  identify the enemy identify your enemy now i've come to you many times and ask for your support
[2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:54.480]  and you've always come through and info wars has come through we've never sold out we've never
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:11:02.000]  backed down we've always told the truth we've made mistakes but 98% of the time or so we're dead on
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:07.440]  and the enemy knows that info wars is a thought leader not just here but around the world and
[2:11:07.440 --> 2:11:13.360]  that's why the chai comms hollywood the globalist won us off the year because their global plan
[2:11:13.360 --> 2:11:18.960]  of total tyranny and a post-human world will not succeed if we stay on air if you don't support
[2:11:18.960 --> 2:11:23.600]  us ladies and gentlemen now they're going to shut info wars down and shut everybody else down as
[2:11:23.600 --> 2:11:30.240]  well you already know that it's out the open so again count the cost focus and realize how critical
[2:11:30.240 --> 2:11:34.480]  you are with your word of mouth spreading the word that overrides the sensors your financial
[2:11:34.480 --> 2:11:38.800]  support getting the products at info wars store dot com and your prayer i'm praying for you please
[2:11:38.800 --> 2:11:43.360]  pray for us let's do this together we're going to win we are winning but it's not going to be easy
[2:11:43.360 --> 2:11:45.920]  the enemy's trying to take it all from us let's not let them succeed
[2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:52.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:11:52.720 --> 2:12:08.160]  all right let's go right back to our guest dr joseph mccullough and this one i tell you he's been
[2:12:08.160 --> 2:12:14.240]  the leading guy most of you already know that when it comes to exposing the predatory activity of
[2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:20.160]  big pharma some of the dangers of vaccines gmo's i mean he's been the big kahuna and i know over the
[2:12:20.160 --> 2:12:24.480]  last four or five years they've really started to censor him down as well that's why we all know
[2:12:24.480 --> 2:12:30.560]  this info or know a lot of it but we need to pass it on to others stop covid cold dot com i've tried
[2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:33.920]  to build my own little side because everybody's asking what to print off what to give out yours is
[2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:38.560]  much better so i abandoned it two weeks ago because blisters were asking for it uh and i just
[2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:42.320]  be able to print the stuff you've got off and hand it out to people that's that's how we save lives
[2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:48.400]  so stop covid cold dot com now first question i actually i know you're a medical doctor and
[2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:52.880]  doctors love to give info out they love to explain things they want to inform people you see all these
[2:12:52.880 --> 2:12:59.360]  thousands of doctors being blocked we've got um in belgium 100 plus doctors and thousands of nurses
[2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:04.480]  and people saying covid is just a giant evil power grab that's now being blocked on facebook
[2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:08.640]  we know about the censorship but specifically you're a smart guy you run a big business you're
[2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:14.800]  best-selling author a few minutes on the agenda of this who's behind it what they want why they're
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:23.120]  lockstep lying and and how we counter that well i have some suggestions as to the counter with
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:33.600]  respect to the understanding of the the conspiracy behind this you know i you know i i i clearly
[2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:38.400]  believe that you know there's that gates is associated with this it means well established
[2:13:38.400 --> 2:13:42.800]  he's funded the world health he's the largest private funder of the the world health organization
[2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:48.880]  and since trump in fact doesn't continue to fund the who he was the largest funder of the world
[2:13:48.880 --> 2:13:53.200]  health organization he's got his own home obviously vested interests he's conflicted he's
[2:13:53.200 --> 2:13:58.400]  head of gavi and uh is going to financially benefit from me you know it's interesting he was the
[2:13:58.400 --> 2:14:03.840]  number one the wealthiest guy in the world he's been surpassed by bezos and elon musk has run
[2:14:03.840 --> 2:14:10.240]  it up his tail pretty quickly but uh he's donated tens of billions of dollars to his foundation
[2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:16.800]  and even after donating he's doubled his wealth so it's because he has a really clever strategy
[2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:21.920]  donates his wealth from the into the foundation the foundation invests in companies that he
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:27.440]  personally financially benefits from it's a legal loophole that he uses so he's not this great
[2:14:27.440 --> 2:14:32.560]  philanthropist that he's trying seeking to convince the media you know he's donated more than two hundred
[2:14:32.560 --> 2:14:38.480]  and fifty million dollars and twenty thousand different grants to some of the biggest publishers
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:46.240]  in the world like the bbc and the new york times and uh pbs i mean abc news especially everything
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:52.320]  everything yeah yeah so the answer it's a great investment from his perspective that's a small
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:57.440]  amount of money when you when you have got wealth like gays and the leverage you can get on the pr
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:02.240]  i mean it's like buying tens of million or tens hundreds billions of billions of dollars worth
[2:15:02.240 --> 2:15:08.000]  of pr it's incredible and the leverage that he's getting so i don't know what his ultimate objective
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:12.720]  is other than that you know i'm a big fan of patrick wood also who was really historical the
[2:15:12.720 --> 2:15:18.880]  chronicle the technocracy that's happened since the trial at all commission in 1975 for the last
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:24.480]  two decades nearly 50 years and you know that it's not a partisan it's not democrat or republic oh
[2:15:24.480 --> 2:15:28.560]  exactly the big the brazilian wrote two books of the technocracy the technotronic era and
[2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:34.720]  one admitting all of this yeah absolutely right and uh he did it with i think he did it with car
[2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:39.360]  as he started in 1975 so you know that is spectacular but i want to focus on things that you can do
[2:15:39.360 --> 2:15:44.720]  and as you mentioned earlier that fauci uh and you know since our the last time was on the show
[2:15:44.720 --> 2:15:49.520]  actually admitted when he was doing an interview with jennifer garter that he actually uses vitamin
[2:15:49.520 --> 2:15:54.560]  d and vitamin c but she asked him what do you do for covid-19 for supplements and he admitted to it
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:16:00.160]  now the media distorted that and took out took out that he was using it to to prevent covid-19
[2:16:00.160 --> 2:16:05.040]  but that's what he said so this works and you know i mentioned the lesson and thank you for
[2:16:05.040 --> 2:16:11.920]  mentioning again to stopcovidcold.com no email opt-ins there's not an email grab you just free
[2:16:11.920 --> 2:16:16.320]  information as a quick quiz and by the way alice did you ever get your uh vitamin d level tested
[2:16:17.760 --> 2:16:22.640]  wow so so why do you think why do you think he's been forced to do this
[2:16:24.240 --> 2:16:29.840]  uh that fauci's been forced to acknowledge that he's taken vitamin d and c
[2:16:29.840 --> 2:16:34.240]  yes i don't know i don't know that he's been forced i mean he might have been but maybe
[2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:39.680]  just had a glimpse of integrity in his brain and decided to admit that what he was really doing
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:44.160]  but i'm wondering if you've ever had your vitamin d level tested out i thought that's what you're
[2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:48.240]  asking uh yes i did have my vitamin d level tested i had genetic testing done two different
[2:16:48.240 --> 2:16:53.680]  big tests with a medical doctor um four years ago and it was okay they checked my genes for
[2:16:53.680 --> 2:16:58.400]  vitamin d absorption well yeah that's a vitamin d receptor but your vitamin d levels will change
[2:16:58.400 --> 2:17:02.080]  just like if you're not eating enough it's it's a supplement they can go up and down depending
[2:17:02.080 --> 2:17:06.720]  on what your levels are i mean i guess i haven't lately had my vitamin d tested no yeah you can
[2:17:06.720 --> 2:17:11.360]  have at least tested once a year so it's a really easy thing to do your your doctor can do it there's
[2:17:11.360 --> 2:17:15.280]  you can get it done on on the line you don't need a doctor's order but if you have a doctor
[2:17:15.280 --> 2:17:19.360]  an insurance that'll cover it so you need to know what your level is and you know the levels are
[2:17:19.360 --> 2:17:24.080]  all in this report online there the free information tells you exactly why it's so important to do
[2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:31.120]  and really will can help prevent it well i just love the sun so i'm just guessing i've oh yeah
[2:17:31.840 --> 2:17:36.640]  it's being in austin i mean i you know you five days a week you're inside when this when you can
[2:17:36.640 --> 2:17:40.800]  get the sun so that's a bit of a challenge for you because really if you're and it's a less
[2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:45.760]  advantage you're not going to get as much vitamin d exposure in the winter even in austin no it takes
[2:17:45.760 --> 2:17:51.200]  more time in the winter well how much does somebody say how much does somebody say in phoenix
[2:17:51.200 --> 2:17:56.400]  in the winter get a natural sunny enough d3 or it just depends on skin color right black folks don't
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:18:01.120]  get as much latitude your latitude and your altitude and obviously the the cloud exposure
[2:18:01.120 --> 2:18:08.080]  in the time of year so in the middle of you know the wrong christmas time the autumna the winter
[2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:12.640]  solstice you're not going to get hardly any even sure why do black folks have the highest number
[2:18:12.640 --> 2:18:18.720]  of coveted is it true that's because they absorb less vitamin d3 we don't know why for sure but
[2:18:18.720 --> 2:18:24.000]  there's clearly there's strong epidemiological coral of data that shows that when you have dark
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:31.040]  colors get not just black or southeast asia and indians the uh you're going to as more of a screen
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:35.040]  so that the uv light that you're exposed to is not going to cause your body to increase your
[2:18:35.040 --> 2:18:38.160]  vitamin d levels this month that's why it's so important to measure your vitamin d and that's
[2:18:38.160 --> 2:18:43.760]  one of the risk factors on this stop covid colk uh dot com there's a test there's a simple quiz
[2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:48.400]  take two minutes and we'll tell you exactly what your risk factor is and then it's not just tell
[2:18:48.400 --> 2:18:53.040]  you oh you're high risk it tells you what to do to change that risk because it's be all about
[2:18:53.040 --> 2:18:58.240]  being proactive remember an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and but if you do need
[2:18:58.240 --> 2:19:01.840]  that pound of cure and i don't know if we have enough time in this segment i'm going to talk
[2:19:01.840 --> 2:19:08.000]  talk to you about a therapy a treatment that will literally obliterate yeah start getting into that
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:11.200]  pound of cure that benjamin frankl will talk about we've got about a minute and a half start
[2:19:11.200 --> 2:19:17.040]  start talking about that all right well it's it's uh i'll i'll put it as a hook for you
[2:19:17.040 --> 2:19:21.040]  your view is about tell you about it dr david brownstein has been doing it for 25 years and i
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:27.680]  interview him it's a therapy that he has published to study it but there were 107 patients all who
[2:19:27.680 --> 2:19:32.960]  had the covid 19 and not one of them died not one of them went to the hospital because it
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:37.120]  aborted it literally in hours when people have this illness when they're sick they have a fever
[2:19:37.120 --> 2:19:41.440]  they feel like they're going to die they can't breathe they're just short of breath they do this
[2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:48.160]  therapy and literally within hours within hours almost all of the symptoms reverse it's unbelievable
[2:19:48.160 --> 2:19:53.680]  there's no toxicity no side effects and here assuming you have the equipment to do it the
[2:19:53.680 --> 2:19:59.200]  cost of the therapy is less than one cent well i want to hear about this because i i lost a lot
[2:19:59.200 --> 2:20:06.720]  of family to pneumonia six years ago well i hope for the viral infection that proceeds that typically
[2:20:06.720 --> 2:20:11.520]  proceeds in pneumonia and is particularly problematic for many elderly people explain how
[2:20:11.520 --> 2:20:15.840]  that works when we come back because when i see the flu they die from pneumonia typically not not
[2:20:15.840 --> 2:20:21.120]  from the flu and and describe to us what a pandemic is versus an epidemic and is this even
[2:20:21.120 --> 2:20:26.720]  still a pandemic with dr joseph mccullough's friend he's defined by the world health organization
[2:20:26.720 --> 2:20:32.400]  and pan means also it's a global infection that literally uh they're able to classify as i think
[2:20:32.400 --> 2:20:37.920]  they help they're the only ones of the authority to do that i mean pan the great god meaning pan or
[2:20:37.920 --> 2:20:40.960]  system-wide we'll be right back dr joseph mccullough stay with us
[2:20:45.360 --> 2:20:51.200]  remember the global lockdowns are witnessing the black lives matter antifa riots and racial
[2:20:51.200 --> 2:20:58.720]  attacks we're all seeing are publicly directed by a handful of top millionaires led by people
[2:20:58.720 --> 2:21:06.640]  like bill gates jeff bezos of course tim cook and others they set up there with their trillions of
[2:21:06.640 --> 2:21:10.800]  dollars they control on their companies and they're hundreds of billions of dollars individually
[2:21:11.520 --> 2:21:16.800]  leveraging that against us and trying to create an artificial revolution against local government
[2:21:17.360 --> 2:21:22.800]  and police and the mayors are again they're playing their political game try to trigger
[2:21:22.800 --> 2:21:27.760]  the complete breakdown of the united states in western europe show these billionaires could come
[2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:32.240]  in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar that's why i'm so angry that these globalists
[2:21:32.240 --> 2:21:36.480]  because when you're looking at them they're the ones that sit in their councils and have decided
[2:21:36.480 --> 2:21:42.800]  to run these plans against us they are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with it's us or them
[2:21:42.800 --> 2:21:50.320]  period in the area during the pandemic we look to local health authorities so for example in the
[2:21:50.320 --> 2:21:56.880]  us it would be cdc for guidelines around medical misinformation in a narrow way which could cause
[2:21:56.880 --> 2:22:02.640]  us harm in the real world that was a few months ago and the ceo of google sundar pachai made a
[2:22:02.640 --> 2:22:07.280]  very important statement all the other big tech ads met the exact same statement because it comes
[2:22:07.280 --> 2:22:13.760]  out of the un that they follow the guidance of the who and or local government what they mean is
[2:22:13.760 --> 2:22:18.800]  the united states other world cities that have been unionized or they've actually signed on the
[2:22:18.800 --> 2:22:23.440]  un memorandums agreements so what he's saying is oh we follow the united nations of the global
[2:22:23.440 --> 2:22:28.480]  government and then we've got little stakeholder parents that's how the un works that then give
[2:22:28.480 --> 2:22:33.920]  the illusion of it being local but then when your doctors or your scientists your virologists come out
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:39.840]  and say that covid-19 is massively exaggerated the power grab they get silenced their press conferences
[2:22:39.840 --> 2:22:45.600]  get muzzled just like they do in communist china that's what's really going on here the planets
[2:22:45.600 --> 2:22:51.280]  have aligned globally they've aligned nationally they've aligned financially culturally but most
[2:22:51.280 --> 2:22:57.920]  importantly spiritually we are living at a point in human development that will decide
[2:22:57.920 --> 2:23:03.440]  the entire future destiny of our species so that's why big tech control by the very dark
[2:23:03.440 --> 2:23:09.920]  forces of the globalist is trying to dumb us down isolate us make us depressed make us alone
[2:23:10.480 --> 2:23:15.200]  and traffic control every aspect of our lives literally brainwashing us with the stimuli
[2:23:15.200 --> 2:23:20.640]  that they look forward because they do not want us to take our birthright not just of americana
[2:23:20.640 --> 2:23:26.240]  but of true christ kingdom and the renaissance and the enlightenment they are trying to create
[2:23:26.240 --> 2:23:31.120]  the new dark age where they have all the high technology and life extension and we are walled
[2:23:31.120 --> 2:23:36.560]  off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon credits and through a social credit
[2:23:36.560 --> 2:23:43.120]  score this is their plan we must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no we must
[2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:59.040]  embrace god you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:24:07.760 --> 2:24:11.440]  we are back live i'm your host alex jones we could talk a hundred hours with dr joseph
[2:24:11.440 --> 2:24:14.160]  recolored with us a little bit longer and then we're going to go to your phone calls
[2:24:14.160 --> 2:24:20.480]  i'll host some of the next hour and lyce ranahan is one of the top experts on this he's going to
[2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:24.560]  either be popping in on the war room or the election countdown tonight with yonah rain
[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:30.000]  seven to nine raking this is uh out of daily wire we already knew all this but now it's confirmed
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:37.360]  hunter biden received millions from wife of x moscow mayor paid suspects allegedly tied to
[2:24:37.360 --> 2:24:43.440]  trafficking had contacts with individuals linked to chinese military senate report documents i mean
[2:24:43.440 --> 2:24:49.040]  this is all on record folks it's disgusting hell hunters dad says china should run every
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:53.920]  aspect of her lives i'm gonna play the clip for you that's why they're always saying
[2:24:53.920 --> 2:24:58.000]  trumps in with the russians they went to between four and eight thousand the numbers vary
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:04.480]  and offered them money or assistance as russians once the fake russia investigation i had them i
[2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:11.760]  had the government approach me the whole muller people okay with uh money of course i went reported
[2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:19.040]  to the fbi but this is happening to everybody and they couldn't get one patriot to take the money
[2:25:19.040 --> 2:25:24.160]  well of course you can't i mean are you crazy but the democrats are all about the country not even
[2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:28.080]  existing and they've never gotten in trouble enough of that we'll talk about it more your calls
[2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:32.640]  are coming up dr joseph mccole i've been asking a lot of the questions here get into this amazing
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:37.600]  thing you were just talking about uh yeah that can help folks in just an hour from your research
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:47.680]  yeah well it's it is truly fundamentally from my view in 35 years of clinical experience the
[2:25:47.680 --> 2:25:53.920]  best strategy to treat this infection and uh the idea well the best strategy is to prevent it so
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:57.360]  that's why you really want to optimize your body d levels and not only that but become
[2:25:57.360 --> 2:26:02.720]  metabolic flexible make sure that you're not insulin resistant that stock cold com goes into
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:09.520]  all details for you know in email opt-in it's nothing but say you a family of member of friend
[2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:15.280]  or someone you care for deeply is acquires this illness and obviously it's a little bit too late
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:18.880]  for vitamin d to do much because you need it to be being resistant for a few weeks to a few months
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:22.560]  before it really kicks in that's why you want to do it now measure your test measure your levels
[2:26:22.560 --> 2:26:27.280]  with the good vitamin d test so you know where you're at and adjust your dosages accordingly
[2:26:27.280 --> 2:26:32.560]  but if you anyone gets sick then what do you do well that therapy talked about is just unbelievable
[2:26:32.560 --> 2:26:40.800]  and what is it is hydrogen peroxide now you could use that the cheap one dollar a bottle of hydrogen
[2:26:40.800 --> 2:26:47.440]  peroxide you get at any drugstore in the us uh that is a commercial one that has some stabilizer
[2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:52.720]  and it's not the ideal the best peroxide would be food grade because it doesn't have these stabilizers
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:56.960]  but the reason why you could use the commercial one probably and get away with it is because
[2:26:56.960 --> 2:27:04.080]  you're not going to use it straight this is the key alex you use it diluted 30 to 1 because it's
[2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:09.680]  what the concentration of the peroxide in the in the commercial one you buy in the drugstore is
[2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:15.280]  3% and you don't want it if you do it by 10 fold it would be 0.3 all right i want to hear about
[2:27:15.280 --> 2:27:19.760]  this because you're a medical doctor you're a very conservative guy with what you say you've been on
[2:27:19.760 --> 2:27:26.160]  target we've seen the media go oh a lady drank fish bowl cleaner and died or groups saying they've
[2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:30.400]  got a you know whatever and they're selling super strong bleach this is completely different the
[2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:34.720]  media misrepresents explain what you're talking about explain what from your research it does well
[2:27:34.720 --> 2:27:40.400]  simple hydrogen peroxide the one you do you see disinfect rooms but it's 30 per 30 times lower
[2:27:40.400 --> 2:27:45.280]  concentration it's diluted now you could use water but because you're going to inhale this and
[2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:50.080]  what's in nebulizer we'll talk about sure well i use hydrogen peroxide every morning to gargle with
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:54.960]  i guess i've got bad breath that's not going to treat that's not going to treat this illness though
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:27:58.080]  oh no i wouldn't say that i'm saying is that healthy for me to do just for my teeth
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:05.120]  actually it's an oxidative therapy and it probably is good i actually use ozone in an ozone
[2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:09.760]  tray of three times a week and it's phenomenally good for periodontal disease so i use it as a
[2:28:09.760 --> 2:28:14.160]  prophylaxis but you probably it's probably reasonable to do i think i don't know that i do
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:18.480]  every day but periodically my dad's a dentist he said do it but i know you're a smart guy too i
[2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:22.720]  don't know what you thought yeah well you just want to give you a chance for your flora in your
[2:28:22.720 --> 2:28:28.000]  mouth to restore so you don't want to pound them every day but and in this treatment i'm discussing
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:32.480]  it's not something you do every day it's only when you're sick okay it's but you have to get this
[2:28:32.480 --> 2:28:39.040]  nebulizer beforehand because it's too late if you're already sick you need now so the nebulizer
[2:28:39.040 --> 2:28:44.320]  is described on my site at mercola.com and i have two interviews with dr brownstein and another
[2:28:44.320 --> 2:28:49.840]  interview i did and of course it's not on youtube because they censored it they absolutely censored
[2:28:49.840 --> 2:28:54.400]  it they censored it let me interrupt you again i've seen big studies mainline medical studies
[2:28:54.400 --> 2:29:00.560]  about nebulizers and and and silver helping in the lungs i've also seen articles where nebulizers
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:04.800]  and steroids and medical doctors saying hundred percent rates on those so how is this different
[2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:12.000]  what does this do i think it's better i i just i'm uh i would not recommend the stories unless
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:16.240]  you're like dying it's just really part of an effective protocol or the math protocol that's
[2:29:16.240 --> 2:29:21.520]  used for ibisepsis but you don't need it just a simple peroxide it costs less than a penny is
[2:29:21.520 --> 2:29:26.160]  probably all you need to treat this but you the devil's in the details you've got to get the nebulizer
[2:29:26.160 --> 2:29:31.360]  there's two types of nebulizers basically the battery-powered ones for 25 on amazon and they
[2:29:31.360 --> 2:29:36.000]  don't recommend them although that they have a mask which is good that fits over the mask is what
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:40.480]  you need because you could use a mouthpiece which is you know how you would inhale this if it goes
[2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:46.000]  well this is something i'm going to get because i know you're right i've read about it and and alice i
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:50.480]  will give you the interview i'll give it to daria and so you you need to have this you need to have
[2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:55.120]  it in your your home there's no question so you get this and you dilute that water so again you
[2:29:55.120 --> 2:29:59.360]  have the three percent or twelve percent if you have the food grade or thirty thirty five percent
[2:29:59.360 --> 2:30:05.040]  you've got to dilute it to zero point one percent you do dilute it with just clean pure distilled
[2:30:05.040 --> 2:30:10.880]  water that you add salt to about a teaspoon per pint so that's create something called normal saline
[2:30:10.880 --> 2:30:15.360]  which is the physiologic osmolality of your blood so that you don't damage your cells when
[2:30:15.360 --> 2:30:21.360]  you're inhaling this water because this prime is 99.9 percent water that you're inhaling it's on it
[2:30:21.360 --> 2:30:28.400]  what is the hydrogen peroxide due to the viruses it kills them plus this is the key thing just like
[2:30:28.400 --> 2:30:36.720]  vitamin d it it it really instantly up regulates your local immune system so that you can start
[2:30:36.720 --> 2:30:41.840]  to destructive process to destroy those invading invading pathogens well let me ask you this question
[2:30:41.840 --> 2:30:45.200]  trump gets told stuff by doctors around him and then he kind of butchers it like i would do because
[2:30:45.200 --> 2:30:49.280]  i'm not a doctor he came out and said i hear about things you can inhale to help you so i went
[2:30:49.280 --> 2:30:54.240]  in search engine didn't found Brazilian and german and russian and japanese about inhaling silver
[2:30:54.240 --> 2:30:58.640]  in it working with demonias then working with SARS and then i went and found about inhaling steroids
[2:30:58.640 --> 2:31:02.560]  even before i ever saw it on the news doctors in texas saying hey i've got hundreds of patients
[2:31:02.560 --> 2:31:07.440]  secured with it yeah but but but but there's texas doctors you're using to decimate for that but i
[2:31:07.440 --> 2:31:11.760]  don't recommend it it's sure sure i'm just saying what you're saying makes sense hydrogen peroxide
[2:31:11.760 --> 2:31:18.160]  kills bacteria and viruses and yes of course it's well documented there's a nice non-controversial
[2:31:18.160 --> 2:31:22.560]  it's what it does and you're putting the solution right where the fading path is what i'm saying is
[2:31:22.560 --> 2:31:26.720]  we need to get this video to president trump and your sinuses in your nose that's why you
[2:31:26.720 --> 2:31:31.280]  want to use a mask so you get it in your note nasal passages in your sinuses because then
[2:31:31.280 --> 2:31:37.680]  that's where the infection lies to and your lungs well so we need to get stop covid cold
[2:31:37.680 --> 2:31:42.160]  dot com to the president we need to flood the white house with this actually interestingly
[2:31:42.160 --> 2:31:48.960]  alice tomorrow i'm interviewing with ron paul his son is rand paul yes incurbing him to tell
[2:31:48.960 --> 2:31:55.120]  rand to to tell that president trump to tweak this and hopefully he will we'll see well that's why
[2:31:55.120 --> 2:31:59.440]  it's so excited i'm gonna call him because you're literally like uh you know guardian angel you're
[2:31:59.440 --> 2:32:02.880]  you're telling people you gotta have vitamin d3 founcing now admits that you're telling people
[2:32:02.880 --> 2:32:07.280]  about this you've got the studies and and the system gets so mad when people like you give good
[2:32:07.280 --> 2:32:13.760]  solutions mad mad is an understatement alice it's an understatement well tell me about the doctor
[2:32:13.760 --> 2:32:17.440]  and the studies about because when obviously hydrogen peroxide in the lungs it's done right
[2:32:17.440 --> 2:32:21.680]  we're saying it's really good but i mean how do you discover this how do you develop this
[2:32:22.800 --> 2:32:27.920]  well he he actually it was a derivative of there are physicians who use hydrogen peroxide
[2:32:27.920 --> 2:32:32.880]  intravenously and then he literally very carefully over many years figured out the lowest he figured
[2:32:32.880 --> 2:32:37.520]  it would be much easier to inhale it through a nebulizer and so you need to get that desktop
[2:32:37.520 --> 2:32:43.440]  nebulizer and again the details are on the site on my site at record com but he so he just kept
[2:32:43.440 --> 2:32:48.800]  in continuously lowering the concentration until he found the dose that worked and he actually uses
[2:32:48.800 --> 2:32:53.680]  a little lower dose point zero four percent about half the dose i recommend but it gives you if you
[2:32:53.680 --> 2:32:57.200]  got a point one it gives you the chance to make an error and you're measuring that you're not going
[2:32:57.200 --> 2:33:04.640]  to be off so it's still it's 99.9 percent water and then 0.1 percent and you are a physician but
[2:33:04.640 --> 2:33:08.320]  you're not giving medical advice or people should consult their physician i mean you have to consult
[2:33:08.320 --> 2:33:13.680]  with your physician you know or if you're a healthcare professional just give it but but i mean realistically
[2:33:13.680 --> 2:33:19.680]  it doesn't take a rocket scientist to believe that 99.9 percent water and 0.1 percent tree
[2:33:19.680 --> 2:33:23.520]  percent hydrogen peroxide inhaling is going to cause any harm or damage it's just it's almost
[2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:27.600]  in physiologically impossible but it takes out the viruses let's do a few more minutes that i'm
[2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:30.960]  going to calls into the next hour callers be patient let her Joseph McCullis here because
[2:33:30.960 --> 2:33:36.560]  i have family that died of stuff like this six years ago uh you know a similar type pneumonia
[2:33:36.560 --> 2:33:40.320]  and you know i've been with it's actually scared of covid and this is something that really gives
[2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:48.720]  a piece of mind you notice that over and over again the united nations are supposed controllers
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:52.960]  and bosses the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with has come out and said
[2:33:53.600 --> 2:34:00.000]  nothing can treat or prevent covid-19 but ladies and gentlemen that's a total lie you get a lot of
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:05.760]  sunlight it's on record to produce a ton of vitamin d3 and it's almost impossible to get viral
[2:34:05.760 --> 2:34:10.320]  infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin d3 if you have zinc and vitamin c as well that's
[2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:15.200]  why people get the flus and these colds in the winter because that's on vitamin d levels plunge
[2:34:15.200 --> 2:34:21.120]  now i've pointed this out and the media has called me a scammer for saying that there's hope that
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:25.520]  people should have their vitamins and their minerals well now fouchy's been forced to come out and
[2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:31.360]  admit that you need vitamin d3 and see he should have also added zinc because the NIH website says
[2:34:31.360 --> 2:34:36.400]  you die without zinc but it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality because
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:40.960]  so many doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that he's not been
[2:34:40.960 --> 2:34:46.960]  warning the public to get their vitamins servants of state are working around the clock to silence
[2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:51.920]  the people of not just the united states but of the world because there is a great awakening
[2:34:51.920 --> 2:34:57.200]  taking place everyone i talk to everywhere i go people that weren't even religious or spiritual
[2:34:57.200 --> 2:35:02.640]  people now understand this is fight between good and evil and they're finding christ and they're
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:08.800]  finding the prophecies that aren't like nostradamus they but are very very detailed and extremely
[2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:16.240]  specific that are now coming true at a frightening rate frightening because so many people are still
[2:35:16.240 --> 2:35:23.200]  living under the control of the god of this world satan did not realize that their immortal souls
[2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:30.720]  are in grave danger do not fear he who can kill the body fear he who can kill the soul as the good
[2:35:30.720 --> 2:35:36.160]  book warns us i'm alex jones and i'm very honored to be on air still during this time every day we're
[2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:40.720]  still on air as a blessing so please pray for info wars pray for yourself pray for the children

[2:35:48.880 --> 2:35:56.720]  voices of independent people all over the world the globalist have a plan for total vertical
[2:35:56.720 --> 2:36:06.320]  integration absolute authoritarianism to where you are a captive of their devices of their control
[2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:13.280]  but that is only a means to an end once they have the electronic straightjacket in place
[2:36:13.280 --> 2:36:18.400]  they are on record that they will bring in force inoculations that sterilize you and your family
[2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:24.720]  and worse many but the vaccine is being pushed by the united nations actually give people polio
[2:36:24.720 --> 2:36:31.200]  and actually give people cancer most cancer is viral that's a big secret but the secret
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:38.240]  is beginning to come out it's even in the associated press remember all of these banned videos
[2:36:38.240 --> 2:36:44.800]  and reports are banned on video but only you can share them and save humanity i've got some bad news
[2:36:44.800 --> 2:36:50.800]  for you that i got some really bad news and i've got some good news the bad news is even if trump
[2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:54.960]  is free elected they're gonna still trigger attempts at martial law medical lockdowns
[2:36:54.960 --> 2:37:00.320]  race riots and a depression that's the globalists they're trying to bring america to our knees now
[2:37:00.320 --> 2:37:05.760]  if trump doesn't get elected they're still planning to bring us to our knees and really try to break
[2:37:05.760 --> 2:37:10.400]  our will and bring us into a super intense depression total control and like australia is
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:15.600]  already doing rounding up and arresting people that criticize what the left are doing that's the
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:20.320]  really bad news the good news is this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world
[2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:25.680]  and the resistance is mounting and the globalists are panicking so bottom line we're in the fight
[2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:31.360]  we're starting to win but it's serious so pray to god for a global awakening support info war
[2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:36.400]  spread the word and buy products at infowarstore.com literally we're having an emergency keep info war

[2:37:48.080 --> 2:37:50.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:38:01.040 --> 2:38:05.040]  alex jones here back live you know i don't sell nebulizers i don't sell these things
[2:38:05.040 --> 2:38:09.680]  but back when i would go on the news here on the show and talk about hey here's the study
[2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:13.920]  backing up what trump says about people with nebulizers with this type of steroid or nebulizers
[2:38:13.920 --> 2:38:18.640]  with silver and it was having great effects they would attack us and they would uh you know have
[2:38:18.640 --> 2:38:23.680]  the attorney general of new york come out and lie about us um and you know that's all that dr
[2:38:23.680 --> 2:38:27.840]  mercola's doing he's a medical doctor he's written papers he's got links to other scientific papers
[2:38:27.840 --> 2:38:32.960]  about this and this is something that people should know about it and really angers me that
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:38.880]  that the un came out the media came out and said you know there's no preventative for covet 19 well
[2:38:39.440 --> 2:38:43.680]  if you don't drink water you die of thirst dehydration if you don't have vitamin c you
[2:38:43.680 --> 2:38:48.240]  get scurvy and die so when they call these things essential i don't think the public knows going
[2:38:48.240 --> 2:38:54.640]  back to preventatives um i mean if you have a bunch of zinc and vitamin d3 and and vitamin c
[2:38:54.640 --> 2:38:59.200]  and uh you're drinking plenty of clean water and you're not dehydrated and don't have other issues
[2:38:59.200 --> 2:39:05.600]  i mean how hard is it to i mean i know it's complex but statistically how hard is it to get the flu
[2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:14.240]  or the common cold or you is that a question yes sir that's a question yeah actually if you're
[2:39:14.240 --> 2:39:18.480]  giving your body what it needs if you optimize your vitamin d levels and you're metabolically
[2:39:18.480 --> 2:39:25.840]  flexible you're insulin sensitive you're uh able to easily transition between burning fat
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:33.040]  and carbohydrates is your primary fuel and you have a metabolically resilient the likelihood of
[2:39:33.040 --> 2:39:37.600]  you coming down with any type of infection is extremely low well obviously depends on many
[2:39:37.600 --> 2:39:44.080]  variables and factors i mean exercise and sleep and you know stress are big ones but if you're
[2:39:44.080 --> 2:39:49.120]  optimizing all of those you can virtually many people i know just don't get sick for decades
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:53.520]  because they're engaging exactly because their immune system is optimized and it's designed
[2:39:53.520 --> 2:39:59.680]  to fight infections why do the diabetics die so easy how how is insulin well diabetes you know
[2:39:59.680 --> 2:40:04.560]  there's two types of diabetes type one and type two but each one especially if they're not properly
[2:40:04.560 --> 2:40:09.840]  controlled will clearly severely impair your immune response so that's one of the reasons why
[2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:15.200]  and it compromises your blood supply so that's why they tend to get infections and their extremities
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:20.640]  and they have uh they're one of the leading risk factors for kidney disease and eye disease
[2:40:20.640 --> 2:40:27.120]  diabetic retinopathy so it really challenges the blood the blood vessel system and uh you're
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:32.400]  predisposed to increase increased risk of infections but you also at marcolla.com you're
[2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:40.000]  one of the leading experts on ways to naturally not become diabetic oh yeah what about all the
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:45.680]  studies i see when it says on an m mr vaccine paper they can give you pancreatitis and it says
[2:40:45.680 --> 2:40:49.680]  can even give you diabetes it says on the sheet and what i was reading is there's a lot of these
[2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:53.760]  kids are getting type one diabetes are telling them it's genetic but really the vaccine's causing
[2:40:53.760 --> 2:40:59.680]  an autoimmune response uh in the uh i guess the kidneys are in the adrenals are in the
[2:40:59.680 --> 2:41:05.920]  areas where i guess the pancreas there there's two separate sess two basic sess setups in your
[2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:13.600]  immune system the um with respect to the t helper t cells and the others and other subsets that did
[2:41:13.600 --> 2:41:19.440]  t and b cells so you did you actually activate one when you get the immune system uh the the
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:25.760]  b cell which is a humeral immunity but you tend to ignore the t cell or humeral or cell mediated
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:30.560]  immunity and that disturbance that the the ratio gets get messed up predisposed to you
[2:41:30.560 --> 2:41:35.520]  diseases like autoimmune diseases and like type one diabetes and and other illnesses like you
[2:41:35.520 --> 2:41:40.000]  mentioned like pancreatitis and things so so you've got to be really really really careful
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:46.800]  with vaccines uh and certainly ones that are accelerated to warp speed and and exclude all
[2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:51.840]  that was my final question i i really don't like trump trying to head off i know what he's doing
[2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:58.800]  heading off gates by saying uh you know oh we've got ours so we can then unlock the economy i know
[2:41:58.800 --> 2:42:02.960]  why he's doing it and then that takes the power away from gates and Fauci and the nih but i still
[2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:07.840]  think it's dangerous what do you think i couldn't agree more i mean it's interesting i just read
[2:42:07.840 --> 2:42:15.360]  us a poll this morning and the entire country only 40 percent are willing to take the vaccine
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:20.400]  if you look at republicans it's like 30 percent and maybe 48 percent for democrats but the the
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:25.120]  mean was 40 percent the majority of people are not going to take the back and doc as you know the
[2:42:25.120 --> 2:42:31.600]  key is that's up 10 percent so so 10 10 percent more so they won't take it the last month so right
[2:42:31.600 --> 2:42:39.520]  confidence is collapsing we're convincing people that's insanity it's absolutely irrational
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:46.640]  to take this vaccine all right thank you so much for the time stop covidcold.com all that great
[2:42:46.640 --> 2:42:50.800]  for information there couldn't be better info let's save some lives let's get that out thank you sir
[2:42:52.160 --> 2:42:59.760]  right there he goes and again uh dr mccola is a very successful guy has his own supplement
[2:42:59.760 --> 2:43:03.120]  lines his own books all his other stuff he doesn't pay to come on the show we're very honored to
[2:43:03.120 --> 2:43:07.520]  have him on so when you hear me hammering and plugging somebody else's stuff it's because
[2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:12.400]  i don't care where you get it this is good information just get it i'm not jealous of
[2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:17.120]  tucker carlson i'm not jealous of tucker carlson i'm not jealous of joe rogan i mean i'm jealous
[2:43:17.120 --> 2:43:20.560]  of that big audience man i want to reach out and warn people and that's why i've tried to you know
[2:43:20.560 --> 2:43:25.520]  get mccola on other shows because he knows what he's talking about and we need to save lives folks
[2:43:25.520 --> 2:43:30.000]  we need to save lives and the people perish for lack of knowledge you don't have the knowledge
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:36.240]  of d3c and zinc it says right from the n i h website you don't have that your cells can't defend
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:41.440]  themselves the n i h website basically says viruses can't replicate in the high zinc vitamin d3
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:46.160]  environment and then the c it's just all the things it does for you and then listen i'm not
[2:43:46.160 --> 2:43:53.120]  mr health i work 18 hours a day i've eaten like a pig i've been in a back when i was younger i
[2:43:53.120 --> 2:43:58.240]  i mean i'm talking real fights whatever reason wherever i got dropped in it was like i heard
[2:43:58.240 --> 2:44:01.360]  mike tyson describing how he grew up that sounds about like me people just beat the
[2:44:01.360 --> 2:44:06.080]  limit hell out of each other so i mean i i look old for 46 okay because i put a lot of miles on this body
[2:44:07.360 --> 2:44:12.320]  but i could not continue to function if it wasn't for dna force plus if it wasn't for x2
[2:44:12.320 --> 2:44:17.280]  it wasn't for winter sun and then i tell the crew i tell them remind me guys to bring in
[2:44:17.280 --> 2:44:22.000]  bottled water or filtered water for me to drink or i'll forget and remind me to take my x2 and to
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:27.760]  take my winter sun and when i remember to take it i lose weight i'm healthy but i'm just like all
[2:44:27.760 --> 2:44:32.160]  you guys i didn't start taking supplements till 10 years ago and that's because they were our
[2:44:32.160 --> 2:44:36.560]  sponsors and i'm like why did i because i mean i was the guy that would go to the all you could
[2:44:36.560 --> 2:44:41.680]  eat chinese food buffet you know and then go run six miles the next day but i'd literally eat like
[2:44:41.680 --> 2:44:49.040]  10 plates of food i'm not like that now i probably eat a third of what i used to uh but let's just
[2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:54.720]  say this i'm a prime heart attack candidate all my stress family history i'm extremely alpha male
[2:44:54.720 --> 2:45:01.920]  type a personality and i just have to remember for myself that i need to religiously take the main
[2:45:01.920 --> 2:45:05.600]  regiment of m4's my products are the best you're gonna find and it funds the operation i'm gonna
[2:45:05.600 --> 2:45:12.000]  break and i'm gonna promise to get to meg kevin kin jim and josh i love the callers i love the guys
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:16.400]  that answer the phones that's why i said in that second hour only take eight calls because i knew
[2:45:16.400 --> 2:45:20.960]  i could get to eight i got to eight then all these poor folks when a guest comes on hold i feel bad
[2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:26.640]  and i feel bad but i'm gonna get to you i'm gonna take up some time from um trauma airport to get
[2:45:26.640 --> 2:45:30.640]  to you and i respect you i feel guilty like i disrespecting you when you sit there on hold for
[2:45:31.280 --> 2:45:35.600]  one guy an hour and 41 minutes we're gonna go to jim and josh and it's other callers so
[2:45:36.240 --> 2:45:41.200]  just once once you do something you can never change i love the call folks i love the crew
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:46.000]  just when i say it from now on let's just get a limited number of calls so i get to them because
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:49.680]  i want to go to these calls and i'm gonna go to the calls just real briefly i'm jamming a call
[2:45:49.680 --> 2:45:55.280]  right now we have winter sun with high quality vitamin d3 and k that helps with the absorption
[2:45:55.280 --> 2:45:58.960]  the experts tell me highest quality get under the tongue you get higher level of absorption of the
[2:45:58.960 --> 2:46:03.600]  body whether you're a young person or an old person it's great it's good it's essential but if
[2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:08.800]  you're above 60 and you don't get out the sun a lot i mean if i was you i'd be taking vitamin d3
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:12.400]  it's selling out but despite that with all the stuff that's going on we're normally just kind of 30
[2:46:12.400 --> 2:46:19.600]  percent it's 60 and free shipping info or sort.com and so is dna force plus it is 60 off with
[2:46:19.600 --> 2:46:25.600]  free shipping info or store.com okay who's been holding the longest here that would be
[2:46:26.640 --> 2:46:34.640]  jim in california thank you so much for holding go ahead yeah hi elix i have two autistic children
[2:46:34.640 --> 2:46:42.080]  with autism and my 39 year old son has basically been mute for his entire life other than a few
[2:46:42.080 --> 2:46:49.760]  uh occasional words here or there i have lived uh for years with the truth about vaccines being
[2:46:49.760 --> 2:46:55.440]  suppressed and drowned out by the mainstream media you know so think of what it would mean
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:47:01.680]  if we could figure out a way to have our voice heard the same to the same extent that the mainstream
[2:47:01.680 --> 2:47:06.560]  media is being heard well the nightmare would be over sir in the autoimmune response causing
[2:47:06.560 --> 2:47:10.880]  brain damage in young boys especially his blood brain barriers aren't as strong as girls is
[2:47:10.880 --> 2:47:16.640]  documented and it is part of a larger program of soft kill and the prison sentence for your
[2:47:16.640 --> 2:47:22.640]  children the prison sentence for you of having their destiny stolen is a is a crime against
[2:47:22.640 --> 2:47:28.720]  humanity my friend yes and so this is what i'm saying look at what trump did to get his message
[2:47:28.720 --> 2:47:35.600]  out using tweet it was brilliant now and then and then you take a look at what breitbart said
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:42.320]  they ran a poll and they said that the public trust of trump was more than the establishment media
[2:47:42.320 --> 2:47:51.680]  on the coronavirus so his brand is just enormous so why not use the strength of the trump brand
[2:47:51.680 --> 2:47:59.200]  to get the truth out to the nation by having a weekly f dr style fire fireside chat i've always
[2:47:59.200 --> 2:48:05.440]  said that but listen you've had your family damaged i know for a fact that um when he was
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:11.360]  like two years old baron was great talking doing great got a shot of vaccine a triple jab
[2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:15.760]  got really sick didn't talk for a while they're really scared he bounced back that's what trump
[2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:19.760]  has said they're giving too many too early well then trump doesn't need to give aid to this just
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:26.480]  to get the economy going he needs to expose it as toxic and bad he knows that so uh jim god bless
[2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:30.320]  you sir we love you we appreciate you trump needs to do that thanks for holding more calls straight
[2:48:30.320 --> 2:48:37.120]  ahead back in two minutes we've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown and it's
[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:42.400]  horrible and it's killing millions of people via starvation but the good news is it's caused a
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:49.360]  planetary awakening as well the general public all over the planet hate bill gates he's the most
[2:48:49.360 --> 2:48:55.920]  unpopular person on earth people know he's not a doctor people know he's a eugenicist the population
[2:48:55.920 --> 2:49:02.000]  knows that his vaccines that he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses polio sterilants and
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:08.240]  more it's even in the associated press so now they're beginning to understand that we the people
[2:49:08.240 --> 2:49:14.000]  know that there is a corporate global government and the beast top tech billionaires sit in meetings
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:20.160]  and decide to pull the type of race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing so remember
[2:49:20.160 --> 2:49:26.560]  that and let them know that we know who they are and what they've done and we hold them responsible
[2:49:26.560 --> 2:49:34.960]  for the collapse of civilization they are the enemies of humanity they want you dead last week

[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:45.360]  worse than the soviet union the soviet union couldn't dream of what big tech could do surveilling
[2:49:45.360 --> 2:49:49.840]  and censoring us and we're going to get a lot worse than the soviet union when it comes to force
[2:49:49.840 --> 2:49:55.520]  inoculations and the medical tyranny being rolled out by the united nations now in control of what

[2:51:04.560 --> 2:51:10.800]  antifa folks they are planning a night of mayhem and craziness because on a drug raid
[2:51:11.840 --> 2:51:16.720]  the guy started shooting at them and they shot back think about how they can paralyze the police
[2:51:16.720 --> 2:51:22.400]  anytime they want if the cops get called they come they get shot at they shoot back they're
[2:51:22.400 --> 2:51:28.560]  bad it's just ridiculous unbelievable when we go up to leptis college reform did it there's video

[2:51:38.400 --> 2:51:44.000]  black guys died burned down the whole country just all bs man it's so transparent let's go to meg
[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:50.560]  in oregon meg thanks for holding your awesome go ahead yeah i uh alex this is my first time calling
[2:51:50.560 --> 2:51:55.920]  and i want to just say something that nobody's talking to and i about and i listen to a lot
[2:51:55.920 --> 2:52:02.960]  of conservative media and it's i drive i drive a truck i transport hay for a living between
[2:52:03.520 --> 2:52:10.640]  northern orgin and central california and i want people to really hear me the bread basket of the
[2:52:10.640 --> 2:52:20.960]  world which is that valley is empty the fires and i see it i i like my car my rig is covered
[2:52:20.960 --> 2:52:28.560]  in ash it's not just the fires it's it's the ash it's the smoke the fish hatcheries are destroyed
[2:52:28.560 --> 2:52:34.240]  and that's where the salmon comes from the olives are gone the grapes from the wineries are gone the
[2:52:34.240 --> 2:52:42.080]  marijuana is gone the rice crop is here uh the tomatoes are covered in ash it can be salvaged
[2:52:42.080 --> 2:52:47.120]  some of them but it's going to be expensive to the farmers and that's going to pass on to you
[2:52:47.120 --> 2:52:53.760]  that grazing uh lands for the cattle up here so a lot of the country gets fed by california some
[2:52:53.760 --> 2:52:58.640]  numbers are of the 20 of our food comes from there and imagine all of that with the rest of the
[2:52:58.640 --> 2:53:03.280]  lockdown and the shutdown and farms destroying their crops because they can't even sell them no
[2:53:03.280 --> 2:53:07.920]  one will even take them that's a great point this is really going to add to the the economy and crisis
[2:53:07.920 --> 2:53:18.160]  it's really different between wants and needs and um if they're doing like i am the rice and beans
[2:53:18.160 --> 2:53:23.520]  and all of that they need to get the nutritional products you saw as a supplement if they thought
[2:53:23.520 --> 2:53:29.120]  they were going to go out and get a buck in northern california or organ those those animals are
[2:53:29.120 --> 2:53:37.120]  gone the livestock has no more grazing grounds um i'm telling you the food is destroyed and so people
[2:53:37.120 --> 2:53:45.360]  need to not go get that new pair of nikes for 200 bucks but by storeable food by nutritional product
[2:53:46.320 --> 2:53:50.480]  listen i never go on air just to sell products to try to scare people i mean i'm selling the
[2:53:50.480 --> 2:53:54.720]  products to fund ourselves and it's good products but yeah you look at every economic metric going
[2:53:54.720 --> 2:53:59.600]  on and this country's under attack and and and they don't want people to be self-sufficient
[2:53:59.600 --> 2:54:04.320]  or to be ready and you're absolutely right uh meg what else are you seeing as you drive around
[2:54:04.320 --> 2:54:09.440]  in oregon and northern california nobody's talking about the destruction of food in the
[2:54:09.440 --> 2:54:17.600]  central valley of california with ash and smoke alone not to mention the fire listen we we had
[2:54:17.600 --> 2:54:21.680]  smoke from california here this weekend my wife's like what's that i went and looked it up and it
[2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:28.160]  was smoke blowing all the way across the country well my car's covered in ash and i'm just passing
[2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:36.800]  through so those tomatoes are covered in ash the naturally the peaches the olives and they can't
[2:54:36.800 --> 2:54:44.880]  salvage they can't pressure wash a crop full of fruit or tomatoes it'll turn into tomato sauce
[2:54:44.880 --> 2:54:49.280]  and it's sure and most things can't be clean once ash is on them and sits on them it really
[2:54:49.280 --> 2:54:54.800]  it tastes horrible what about the fish hatcheries that feed most of the salmon to our nation throughout
[2:54:54.800 --> 2:55:03.520]  orfans those fish are choking on ash and ash and water turns to live so and nanti Pelosi doesn't
[2:55:03.520 --> 2:55:08.880]  want to include uh funding for the farmers in the bill let me ask you this in closing i know they
[2:55:08.880 --> 2:55:12.800]  have caught a lot of antifa setting fires i've heard the public's really pissed at antifa is
[2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:19.680]  that what you've heard oh yeah and everybody believes antifa setting the fires i've talked to
[2:55:19.680 --> 2:55:28.560]  people and it's like they're setting fires purposefully in the backyard of grazing land
[2:55:28.560 --> 2:55:35.120]  they're purposefully going into chico california oh yeah they've been catching them stay there mag
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:38.960]  back in 60 seconds i want you to finish it then we'll go to josh uh and then we've got john raport
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:43.440]  about to take over really appreciate you all we'll be right back on the other side on this and perhaps
[2:55:43.440 --> 2:55:52.320]  most cruelly of all if donald trump has his way the complications from COVID-19 which are well beyond
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:56:01.040]  what they should be it's estimated that 200 million people have died probably by the time i
[2:56:01.040 --> 2:56:06.720]  finished this talk joe biden has always been a congenital liar part of the establishment for
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:15.120]  close to 50 years but now boy as his brain degenerates we are seeing walking public dimension
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:20.640]  on the biggest stage in the world the 2020 election there are 370 million people in the
[2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:26.400]  united states if 200 million died from COVID that'd be more than half of the population
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:31.680]  when not even one tenth of one percent have actually died but him putting these giant lies
[2:56:31.680 --> 2:56:36.560]  and these incredibly brain damage statements out is emblematic of the general public being
[2:56:36.560 --> 2:56:41.200]  in a trance how is anyone even putting up with this it is beyond bizarre
[2:56:46.480 --> 2:56:55.040]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow well we've had a lot of amazing
[2:56:55.040 --> 2:57:00.480]  callers today and again i love to take your calls i told john that takes your calls i said just get
[2:57:00.480 --> 2:57:05.200]  eight calls in line um because i want to be able to get to him that second hour and then not have
[2:57:05.200 --> 2:57:09.520]  you sit on hold but he loaded up with 20 phone calls and i appreciate that some folks had to
[2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:13.360]  sit on hold after that first group but the way i'm going to fix that problem is we're going to start
[2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:16.960]  taking just a limited number and then when those are gone we'll open the phones up again uh is that
[2:57:16.960 --> 2:57:20.960]  really appreciate everybody holding and i'm alex joneshow your host josh and texas you're our last

[2:57:30.080 --> 2:57:35.360]  days out from the election we've got this brianna taylor deal going on and just like it says in the
[2:57:35.360 --> 2:57:40.800]  bible okay we've got 40 days of noah in the flood we got 40 days of jesus being tested
[2:57:40.800 --> 2:57:46.560]  in the wilderness and uh 40 years of israelites i think that we are uh working ourselves into a
[2:57:47.120 --> 2:57:52.320]  into a situation here that we're going to see unfold before this election comes around so
[2:57:52.320 --> 2:57:59.280]  you always talk about how we all need to pray and i've got a words to live by which are pray
[2:57:59.280 --> 2:58:04.560]  like it's all up to god and work like it's all up to you and i think if we stick with that um
[2:58:05.200 --> 2:58:10.720]  we'll uh we'll end up on top but also i would just want to remind you about a month ago i heard you
[2:58:11.920 --> 2:58:15.920]  give a personal detail about how you felt the lord was telling you to pray on air

[2:58:19.760 --> 2:58:24.400]  here but i've got a solution for you the first five minutes of the show or so you always play a
[2:58:24.400 --> 2:58:31.360]  john bound report um and what i would recommend is i know you hate it when people call you up
[2:58:31.360 --> 2:58:36.000]  and tell you what you should be doing so i understand that but if we could get uh the the
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:41.040]  dallas preacher that you know and uh the the bishop up there in new york that you have on

[3:05:07.200 --> 3:05:12.800]  each other imagine psychologically because the spirit does go on it's been proven it's been
[3:05:12.800 --> 3:05:18.320]  documented and imagine being with a bunch of them forever that's called hell with their burning hate
[3:05:18.320 --> 3:05:24.880]  of god and their burning desire to hurt innocents and together not able to hurt innocents not able
[3:05:24.880 --> 3:05:31.600]  to vandalize god's creation not able to run around burning everything down anymore walled off from god
[3:05:31.600 --> 3:05:38.640]  walled off from human communion walled off from the future walled off from christ
[3:05:39.120 --> 3:05:42.880]  bill gates isn't a winner bill gates is a loser
[3:05:49.200 --> 3:05:53.600]  ruthbader ginsberg isn't a winner ruthbader ginsberg's a loser
[3:05:54.480 --> 3:05:58.400]  john rapaport's always informative but he's really been on fire up during this covet situation
[3:05:58.400 --> 3:06:01.920]  and boy has been proven dead on right i thought he was mainly right eight months ago but now
[3:06:01.920 --> 3:06:06.880]  it's really bad but there's mounting opposition on every front coming forward and it's a very
[3:06:06.880 --> 3:06:10.240]  important time to be alive they now admit the lockdowns permit the forced inoculations are
[3:06:10.240 --> 3:06:14.800]  coming uh i can't wait to hear his view on trump i know is using this vaccine thing to take control
[3:06:14.800 --> 3:06:18.240]  away from gates because they want to keep things locked down until they have the vaccine i still
[3:06:18.240 --> 3:06:23.200]  don't agree with what trump's doing even though i was been led in on what he's doing to take the
[3:06:23.200 --> 3:06:28.960]  power from gates and the bureaucracy but we'll get his take on that and more as john rapaport
[3:06:28.960 --> 3:06:34.800]  of no more fake news dot com takes over as for us you know the urls news wars dot com
[3:06:34.800 --> 3:06:39.120]  and bandod video with lifesaving information so keep spreading it patriots i love you all
[3:06:40.960 --> 3:06:45.120]  if you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and control them
[3:06:45.120 --> 3:06:49.680]  to a man and to a woman they believe there's too many people on the earth and they constantly
[3:06:49.680 --> 3:06:54.480]  whine about when they want to go to a mountaintop or a national park they have to look at us the
[3:06:54.480 --> 3:06:59.280]  common people they have to look at the proletariat they have to look at the scum that's why they
[3:06:59.280 --> 3:07:04.480]  love the lockdown putting mussels on us that gives them a big thrill controlling where we can go what
[3:07:04.480 --> 3:07:10.720]  we can do bankrupting main street bankrupting small towns all of it is a vertical integration
[3:07:10.720 --> 3:07:16.480]  consolidation so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender which is taking sterilant
[3:07:16.480 --> 3:07:23.120]  vaccines day one ladies and gentlemen all the games are over play times over they used all the
[3:07:23.120 --> 3:07:28.240]  entertainment garbage to put us into a trance and now the spiders moving in for the kill you
[3:07:28.240 --> 3:07:32.960]  know this i know this it's all out in the open the question is what are we gonna do about it
[3:07:32.960 --> 3:07:37.600]  well the first thing is identify the enemy identify the enemy identify the enemy identify
[3:07:37.600 --> 3:07:45.440]  your enemy now i don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election but i need to be
[3:07:45.440 --> 3:07:51.440]  honest with everybody the democrats and their deep state controllers commerce chinese have come out
[3:07:51.440 --> 3:07:55.360]  and said they're going to contest the election they know that trump's gonna win a landslide and
[3:07:55.360 --> 3:08:01.040]  the destabilization that that's going to cause is going to further destroy the markets and the economy
[3:08:01.040 --> 3:08:05.920]  and going into the future even if trump is able to prove that he's won the election the democrats
[3:08:05.920 --> 3:08:12.320]  have said they're going to break away politically and culturally into the blue states and blue cities
[3:08:12.320 --> 3:08:20.000]  and basically use that as a pretext of sabotage the republic even more so until this cancer is
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:25.040]  rooted out until these criminals that work with foreign governments that are trying to basically
[3:08:25.040 --> 3:08:30.880]  destroy the country are punished and removed it's just going to continue to happen and so that's the
[3:08:30.880 --> 3:08:36.640]  big problem here that is that we have systemic dug in corruption by people that hate the country's
[3:08:36.640 --> 3:08:45.920]  very existence you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:04.000]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:11.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host john rapaport
[3:09:14.160 --> 3:09:22.160]  greetings folks another week major major news today which i'll get to in a minute
[3:09:23.040 --> 3:09:32.640]  has to do with the vaccine but first you're on a site called info wars there is a war on
[3:09:32.640 --> 3:09:42.320]  for your mind this has to do with information or as people like to say these days data data
[3:09:42.320 --> 3:09:54.080]  garbage in garbage out garbage in garbage out not science data for example here's how we can do a
[3:09:54.080 --> 3:10:03.520]  straight data analysis case numbers and the death numbers of kovat are completely wrong
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:12.320]  that's data new york times article recently stated that up to 90 percent of all us kovat cases
[3:10:13.120 --> 3:10:19.120]  could be false positives because the test is completely unreliable for several different
[3:10:19.120 --> 3:10:33.520]  reasons wow cdc admitted that only six percent of all kovat deaths in the u.s. happened exclusively
[3:10:33.520 --> 3:10:42.880]  from the virus in all other cases other serious illnesses were present in the people elderly
[3:10:42.880 --> 3:10:50.240]  elderly people that could certainly have been lethal all on their own no virus necessary
[3:10:52.400 --> 3:10:53.360]  hope you're getting this
[3:10:55.760 --> 3:11:05.680]  data bad bad data being foisted on the american people took me like 30 seconds to correct that
[3:11:05.680 --> 3:11:14.320]  garbage in garbage out there's a war on for your mind with false data
[3:11:16.640 --> 3:11:21.120]  when people say well it's science and you can't refuse science you can't challenge
[3:11:21.120 --> 3:11:25.760]  science only experts know what's happening and we have to defer to them no you don't
[3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:32.160]  that's just a smoke screen it's much simpler than that it's about data
[3:11:32.160 --> 3:11:42.400]  data data data data data move in the data age everybody's aware of the it people are aware
[3:11:42.400 --> 3:11:47.520]  of it people who work at home doing spreadsheets are aware of it all the people who work from
[3:11:47.520 --> 3:11:56.640]  major corporations are aware of it what's the quality of the data every giant corporation
[3:11:56.640 --> 3:12:04.240]  in the world is now saying we are a data driven corporation whatever they mean by that it means
[3:12:04.240 --> 3:12:11.360]  they're collecting billions of pieces of data not only on their customers potential customers but
[3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:18.000]  on their own employees they're trying to shape management and shape this and shape that okay
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:28.960]  okay so let's get out to data let's do data fake death numbers fake case numbers in the
[3:12:28.960 --> 3:12:36.800]  u.s. and all over the world when you actually clear the smoke away you're talking about almost
[3:12:36.800 --> 3:12:46.000]  nothing in terms of numbers at which point say that's it what was all that nonsense and insanity
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:50.880]  and illusion about everybody go back to work everybody take off the mask everybody stop
[3:12:50.880 --> 3:12:55.920]  distancing it's all over it's finished no more lockdowns no more anything
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:10.400]  data data data so segueing from that two breaking stories in the washington post and the new york
[3:13:10.400 --> 3:13:24.160]  times about the clinical vaccine trials oh this is so good you won't believe it the clinical vaccine
[3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:34.480]  trials for a covid vaccine that are being conducted the three major ones by fizer moderna and astrazeneca
[3:13:34.480 --> 3:13:48.720]  data data data data data and the gist of these two articles is that the design of these clinical
[3:13:48.720 --> 3:13:59.200]  trials is completely fatally flawed not just that the researchers that are conducting the
[3:13:59.200 --> 3:14:06.320]  trials are doing it badly or whatever whatever but the basic structure the way they've designed
[3:14:06.880 --> 3:14:18.480]  the protocol for the clinical trials has a fatal flaw in it for all three major companies listen up
[3:14:19.280 --> 3:14:26.640]  scott atlas at the white house new corona virus advisor listen up donald trump listen up
[3:14:26.640 --> 3:14:36.640]  scientists doctors fda you see it's quite likely that the washington post and the new york times
[3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:44.560]  thought that it would be a good idea to publish articles warning people that the vaccine can't
[3:14:44.560 --> 3:14:50.400]  be rushed into production and approved so on until after the election you know the usual
[3:14:50.400 --> 3:15:02.320]  antitrump message but what they got instead in these two major editorials is a total torpedoing
[3:15:02.320 --> 3:15:12.320]  amid ships of the design and protocol of all of these major studies that would lead the fda
[3:15:12.320 --> 3:15:24.720]  listen up you fda that would lead to the approval of a covid vaccine it's all fatally flawed and
[3:15:24.720 --> 3:15:33.600]  i will be explaining to you exactly why that's true and how that's true i've dug deep into this
[3:15:33.600 --> 3:15:43.120]  to show you exactly how it's false how it's irreparable how it's going down a blind alley
[3:15:43.680 --> 3:15:52.000]  how the whole concept that is being sold to the public of a savior vaccine is complete why
[3:15:52.720 --> 3:16:01.440]  and how the major vaccine companies conducting these trials have to know it's a complete lie
[3:16:01.440 --> 3:16:10.000]  by the very nature of what they're looking for in the trials their data their garbage
[3:16:11.120 --> 3:16:18.880]  their structure how they're separating this from that and counting this and counting that
[3:16:19.680 --> 3:16:27.280]  the whole gigantic pile of rubbish is coming forward into the light
[3:16:27.280 --> 3:16:36.240]  so that anybody with brain cells to rub together can see the truth this is what you need to understand
[3:16:36.240 --> 3:16:43.520]  this is what i'm going to be revealing here in the rest of this hour to you as to how and why this
[3:16:43.520 --> 3:16:52.480]  is so and one of the major clues that i will leave you with as we go to a break here is
[3:16:52.480 --> 3:17:04.960]  is in these clinical trials they are looking for a magic number of 150 people
[3:17:06.880 --> 3:17:14.800]  out of 33,000 40,000 enrolled in each one of these clinical trials they're looking for a magic
[3:17:14.800 --> 3:17:25.200]  number of 150 people on which to make a judgment call about injecting seven billion people in
[3:17:25.200 --> 3:17:32.160]  the arm with a code they're looking for a magic number of just under
[3:17:35.440 --> 3:17:43.040]  say two remember the global lockdown for witnessing the black lives matter
[3:17:43.040 --> 3:17:48.960]  antifer riots and racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly directed by a handful
[3:17:49.600 --> 3:17:56.080]  of top billionaires led by people like bill gates jeff bezos of course tim cook and others
[3:17:56.880 --> 3:18:02.160]  they set up there with their trillions of dollars they control their companies and
[3:18:02.160 --> 3:18:07.920]  their hundreds of billions of dollars individually leveraging that against us and trying to create
[3:18:07.920 --> 3:18:14.000]  an artificial revolution against local government and police and the mayors are again they're playing
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:19.280]  their political game try to trigger the complete breakdown of the united states in western europe
[3:18:19.280 --> 3:18:24.080]  show these billionaires can come in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar that's why i'm so
[3:18:24.080 --> 3:18:27.760]  angry at these globalists because when you're looking at them they're the ones that sit in
[3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:33.600]  their councils and have decided to run these plans against us they are enemies of humanity
[3:18:33.600 --> 3:18:41.760]  and must be dealt with it's us or them period in the area during the pandemic we look to local
[3:18:41.760 --> 3:18:47.680]  health authorities so for example in the u.s it would be cdc for guidelines around medical
[3:18:47.680 --> 3:18:53.200]  misinformation in a narrow way which could cause harm in the real world that was a few months ago
[3:18:53.200 --> 3:18:58.560]  and the ceo of google sundar pachai made a very important statement all the other big tech ads
[3:18:58.560 --> 3:19:04.160]  made the exact same statement as it comes out of the event that they follow the guidance of the who
[3:19:04.160 --> 3:19:09.360]  and or local government what they mean is in the united states other areas of the world cities that
[3:19:09.360 --> 3:19:14.000]  have been unionized or that have actually signed on to un memorandums and agreements so what he's
[3:19:14.000 --> 3:19:18.320]  saying is oh we follow the united nations of the global government and then we've got little
[3:19:18.320 --> 3:19:24.000]  stakeholder parents that's how the un works that then give the illusion of it being local but then
[3:19:24.000 --> 3:19:29.360]  when your doctors or your scientists your virologists come out and say that cover 19 is massively
[3:19:29.360 --> 3:19:34.400]  exaggerated the power grab they get silenced their press conferences get muzzled just like
[3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:39.360]  they do in communist china that's what's really going on here it was in the telecommunications
[3:19:39.360 --> 3:19:46.480]  act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your gps location i read from the federal law
[3:19:46.480 --> 3:19:52.160]  and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un american now the media admits that almost
[3:19:52.160 --> 3:19:57.920]  every app and every company that are on apple and androids don't just track your location but
[3:19:57.920 --> 3:20:04.400]  your surfing history where you go who you talk to your relationships and they all share the data
[3:20:04.400 --> 3:20:09.920]  with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well including having apps turn on and listen
[3:20:09.920 --> 3:20:16.480]  to what you're saying just like siri or alexa do and then putting databases transcripts of everything
[3:20:16.480 --> 3:20:21.680]  you say into those systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on you and companies are
[3:20:21.680 --> 3:20:26.640]  generating secret surveillance scores based on information this is the global chinese communist
[3:20:26.640 --> 3:20:32.400]  social credit score get your protection privacy pockets at info war store dot com and cut big
[3:20:32.400 --> 3:20:48.320]  brother off dead in his filthy tracks info or store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:21:03.360 --> 3:21:10.880]  got a report back here so they're looking for 150 people the results in 150 people in these
[3:21:10.880 --> 3:21:20.000]  clinical vaccine trials based on what they can say about those 150 people they will want approval
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:26.960]  for a vaccine to shoot up seven billion people on the planet so i want to explain how this works
[3:21:26.960 --> 3:21:38.640]  exactly what's revealed in these two articles in the times and the post is that the design protocol
[3:21:38.640 --> 3:21:51.120]  of these clinical vaccine trials is directed naturally to discover very mild cases or to prevent
[3:21:51.120 --> 3:22:00.480]  let's say mild very mild cases of covet 19 but who cares about those because they cure themselves
[3:22:00.480 --> 3:22:06.080]  no real harm comes to anybody in other words there's no vaccine necessary in the first place
[3:22:06.880 --> 3:22:08.400]  for very mild cases
[3:22:11.600 --> 3:22:14.400]  what about these 150 people how does that work
[3:22:14.400 --> 3:22:24.960]  the vaccine manufacturers fiser moderna astrazeneca assume that during these giant clinical trials
[3:22:26.080 --> 3:22:34.320]  because the corona virus is loose in the world it's going to visit the volunteers in their own
[3:22:34.320 --> 3:22:42.320]  clinical trials and some of them will get cases of covet 19 see and some of these will be in the
[3:22:42.320 --> 3:22:50.480]  placebo group and some will be in the vaccine and that's what they want to have happen so they can see
[3:22:50.480 --> 3:22:56.400]  how effective the vaccine is versus the placebo because half the volunteers are going to get shot
[3:22:56.400 --> 3:23:04.400]  up with the vaccine and half are going to get shot up with saltwater a placebo and so for example
[3:23:04.400 --> 3:23:14.960]  let's say that they do get 150 very light cases of covet 19 inside their study their clinical trial
[3:23:16.080 --> 3:23:22.160]  meaningless of course as i've just explained because who cares about those in the first place
[3:23:22.160 --> 3:23:30.000]  they don't need a vaccine but that's what they're looking for and let's say that 50 of those
[3:23:30.000 --> 3:23:38.800]  cases occur in the vaccinated group and 100 occur in the placebo group then they can suddenly say
[3:23:38.800 --> 3:23:47.440]  study is over clinical trial is over we just proved that the vaccine is 50 effective and
[3:23:47.440 --> 3:23:54.240]  that's all that the fda requires for authorization and we can now get the vaccine approved and we
[3:23:54.240 --> 3:24:01.760]  can shoot it it's a seven billion people all over the world on the basis of 150
[3:24:05.760 --> 3:24:11.680]  people that couldn't be no they wouldn't be that stupid i mean they couldn't possibly yeah they are
[3:24:12.560 --> 3:24:21.600]  that's what was revealed in these two pieces especially in the new york times piece and i
[3:24:21.600 --> 3:24:30.720]  dealt deeply into that piece to find out exactly what was meant it's astound it's staggering it's
[3:24:30.720 --> 3:24:42.960]  unbelievable again this is not me these are the manufacturers phyzer astrazeneca moderna they're
[3:24:42.960 --> 3:24:49.920]  conducting the biggest vaccine clinical trials in the world right now for covid and they are the
[3:24:49.920 --> 3:24:55.200]  and they are the leading companies expected all of them two of them one of them to come out with a
[3:24:55.200 --> 3:25:03.120]  vaccine that's going to be approved and what they're saying is during our clinical trial we expect
[3:25:03.120 --> 3:25:10.160]  the corona virus to come drifting in from the outside nothing to do with the trial and it will
[3:25:10.160 --> 3:25:19.280]  and it will infect and cause mild cases of corona covid 19 in our volunteers in the study and we are
[3:25:19.280 --> 3:25:26.960]  looking at that yes very good and we want to find out where those cases occur how many in the
[3:25:26.960 --> 3:25:36.080]  vaccinated group how many in the placebo and what we are hoping for and praying for is that of these
[3:25:36.080 --> 3:25:44.080]  of these 150 that's all we need of these covid 19 cases that 50 will occur in the vaccinated group
[3:25:44.080 --> 3:25:51.200]  and 100 in the placebo group and we can say you see the vaccine actually is working because there's
[3:25:51.200 --> 3:25:58.800]  less covid 19 cases in the vaccinated group and a lot more in the placebo group in fact there's
[3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:06.160]  in fact there's twice as many in the placebo group and that means that the vaccine is 50% effective
[3:26:06.160 --> 3:26:13.120]  and that's all we need to get approval from the FDA and here we go billions and trillions in profit
[3:26:13.120 --> 3:26:19.040]  we shoot up everybody on the planet who knows what's going to be in that vaccine and uh we're
[3:26:19.040 --> 3:26:29.200]  off and running not so fast junior it's preposterous completely preposterous
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:37.520]  because mild cases of covid 19 are irrelevant meaningless don't care whether they occur in
[3:26:37.520 --> 3:26:42.960]  the vaccine group the vaccinated group or the placebo group it makes no difference it's all
[3:26:42.960 --> 3:26:50.000]  ridiculous because a light case of covid 19 is like a sniffle and a cough and you get over it
[3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:59.680]  and you don't need a vaccine at all for it in the first place now it gets even worse than that much
[3:26:59.680 --> 3:27:11.360]  worse because you can ask these manufacturers Pfizer AstraZeneca Moderna well when you talk about
[3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:18.480]  people in the study your volunteer is getting becoming cases of covid 19 because the virus
[3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:26.640]  drips in whatever how do you define a covid case what do you mean it's a covid 19 case
[3:27:26.640 --> 3:27:39.680]  oh loving this loving this what it means is somebody has a cough or a cough and fever
[3:27:39.680 --> 3:27:50.880]  and they test positive on a PCR test and that becomes a case of covid 19 that's all
[3:27:51.760 --> 3:27:59.040]  that's all totally irrelevant in fact recently the new york times itself published another
[3:27:59.040 --> 3:28:07.440]  article in which they said set up to 90 of all us covid cases but very well be false positives
[3:28:07.440 --> 3:28:20.240]  because the test is completely unreliable so they're not cases at all so even these 150
[3:28:20.240 --> 3:28:28.240]  magic number cases in these clinical vaccine trials why would you be calling them covid
[3:28:28.240 --> 3:28:34.560]  19 cases at all since you're talking about the vaguest of symptoms like a cough and a
[3:28:34.560 --> 3:28:45.120]  sneeze and a little fever and a positive result on a test that is completely unreliable
[3:28:46.880 --> 3:28:56.240]  yet one more reason that these major clinical vaccine trials are a total and complete
[3:28:56.240 --> 3:29:12.880]  hoax hoax hoax phony con tap dancing blue sky con job unscientific data driven garbage in garbage
[3:29:12.880 --> 3:29:27.280]  out useless unreliable deceptive misleading worthless fraudulent criminally fraudulent
[3:29:31.440 --> 3:29:38.720]  there you have it and this whole argument though you need to rush the vaccine or
[3:29:38.720 --> 3:29:44.640]  wait for the vaccine or speed versus a Fauci versus this or that
[3:29:47.040 --> 3:29:55.200]  it's all a tempest natica compared with what i'm talking about here which is remember the old
[3:29:55.200 --> 3:30:06.400]  phrase the ship was torpedoed amid ships bang and it's saying that's what just happened to the major
[3:30:06.400 --> 3:30:16.880]  clinical trials of the covid 19 vaccine sinking below the waves as we watch it go down and down
[3:30:16.880 --> 3:30:28.640]  and down new york times washington post they thought i'm pretty sure that these would be as i said
[3:30:28.640 --> 3:30:34.480]  anti-trump particles you know in other words oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait don't don't
[3:30:34.480 --> 3:30:39.120]  approve the vaccine yet you see because there's some problems with the clinical trial for your
[3:30:39.120 --> 3:30:44.880]  support and you've always come through and info wars has come through we've never sold out we've
[3:30:44.880 --> 3:30:51.440]  never backed down we've always told the truth we've made mistakes but 98% of the time or so
[3:30:51.440 --> 3:30:57.440]  we're dead on and the enemy knows that info wars is a thought leader not just here but around the
[3:30:57.440 --> 3:31:03.120]  world and that's why the chai comms hollywood the globalist won us off the air because their
[3:31:03.120 --> 3:31:09.040]  global plan of total tyranny and a post-human world will not succeed if we stay on air if you
[3:31:09.040 --> 3:31:13.680]  don't support us ladies and gentlemen now they're going to shut info wars down and shut everybody
[3:31:13.680 --> 3:31:20.000]  else down as well you already know that it's out the open so again count the cost focus and realize
[3:31:20.000 --> 3:31:24.480]  how critical you are with your word of mouth spraying the word that overrides the sensors
[3:31:24.480 --> 3:31:28.960]  your financial support getting the products in info war store dot com and your prayer i'm praying for
[3:31:28.960 --> 3:31:33.360]  you please pray for us let's do this together we're going to win we are winning but it's not
[3:31:33.360 --> 3:31:37.200]  going to be easy the enemy's trying to take it all from us let's not let them succeed last week
[3:31:37.200 --> 3:31:42.480]  tucker carlson came out and said america is becoming the soviet union in many ways we're
[3:31:42.480 --> 3:31:47.600]  worse than the soviet union the soviet union couldn't dream of what big tech can do surveilling
[3:31:47.600 --> 3:31:51.760]  and censoring us and we're going to get a lot worse than the soviet union when it comes to
[3:31:51.760 --> 3:31:57.440]  force inoculations and the medical tyranny being rolled out by the united nations now in control
[3:31:57.440 --> 3:32:02.240]  of what you can and can't say online the truth is ladies and gentlemen america is fighting for
[3:32:02.240 --> 3:32:07.920]  its life and the enemy's number one mission is to get trump out of office and number two
[3:32:07.920 --> 3:32:13.600]  is to silence info wars because we understand just how diabolical they are just how evil they are
[3:32:13.600 --> 3:32:18.480]  and we won't miss words we know who the global star we've got their number and we know how to
[3:32:18.480 --> 3:32:24.640]  beat them and we cover it seven days a week live at info wars and it's only because of your support
[3:32:24.640 --> 3:32:28.400]  so keep spreading the word keep praying for us and taking advantage of the sales and get great
[3:32:28.400 --> 3:32:33.600]  products at infowarstore.com now the globalists are hoping you don't visit infowarstore.com
[3:32:38.080 --> 3:32:44.480]  and perhaps most cruelly of all if donald trump has his way the complications from
[3:32:44.480 --> 3:32:54.800]  covid-19 which are well beyond what they should be it's estimated that 200 million people have died
[3:32:54.800 --> 3:33:02.240]  200 million people have died probably by the time i finish this talk right after joe biden made that
[3:33:02.240 --> 3:33:08.400]  statement that more than 60 of america has died from covid-19 when it's not even 200 000 reality
[3:33:08.400 --> 3:33:13.520]  he would want to say six million have lung scarring and heart damage it's all made up but you know
[3:33:13.520 --> 3:33:17.280]  where you got it the mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that
[3:33:17.280 --> 3:33:24.080]  they said that four percent of america would be dead already of course it's point zero zero zero
[3:33:24.080 --> 3:33:30.400]  zero and then add a number because the numbers vary it's a real virus just like people being struck
[3:33:30.400 --> 3:33:36.480]  by lightning is real but to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind
[3:33:36.480 --> 3:33:44.640]  control there is a forced evolution taking place the scientific ruling elite believe they are
[3:33:44.640 --> 3:33:51.200]  transcending to a silicon life form while they are making this hypothetical very dangerous transition
[3:33:51.200 --> 3:33:56.480]  that is a guaranteed doom to fail and create nightmares they're almost unimaginable their
[3:33:56.480 --> 3:34:03.280]  plan for us is extermination or spiking the cannon like after a major war is done you don't want
[3:34:03.280 --> 3:34:09.920]  those weapons used again you get rid of them we are being rendered into scrap metal right now so
[3:34:09.920 --> 3:34:13.200]  think about all your ancestors think about your grandparents think about your parents think about
[3:34:13.200 --> 3:34:16.560]  your children think about the future and ask yourself are you really going to let a bunch
[3:34:16.560 --> 3:34:22.480]  of crazy mad scientists steal the future destiny of everyone and basically use us like guinea pigs
[3:34:22.480 --> 3:34:27.920]  to experiment so they can try to find cures the cancer and things not for us but for them
[3:34:27.920 --> 3:34:34.160]  bill gates is the leader of this organization bill gates is the enemy of humanity decide what
[3:34:34.160 --> 3:35:00.640]  you're gonna do america the cyber gonna do humanity you're listening to the alex jones show news
[3:35:00.640 --> 3:35:07.920]  analysis reports it's the alex jones show and now your host john wrap up
[3:35:11.600 --> 3:35:16.800]  okay so in this last segment here what are the implications of all of this
[3:35:18.480 --> 3:35:26.000]  first of all the fda proves all vaccines better watch out i don't care whether they
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:30.320]  think they're gonna approve it now later before the election after the election whatever whatever
[3:35:30.320 --> 3:35:38.960]  whatever that doesn't matter what matters is all of the major clinical trials are now exposed as
[3:35:38.960 --> 3:35:48.000]  complete frauds just as i've been describing in this hour fraud fraud fraud fraud fraud
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:54.160]  fraud therefore no approval no approval no approval and guess what no approval is really
[3:35:54.160 --> 3:36:01.280]  necessary because the whole thing is a fraud to begin with the whole operation the whole
[3:36:01.280 --> 3:36:09.040]  covid the whole pandemic it's not a pandemic it never was i've spent many hours in articles and
[3:36:09.040 --> 3:36:14.560]  on the show talking about that from the very beginning what happened in china all the way up
[3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:22.960]  until now total fraud down to the ground but people are out there waiting oh i gotta have
[3:36:22.960 --> 3:36:29.440]  the vaccine oh this or that i'm leaving my house until the vaccine is available oh it's science yes
[3:36:29.440 --> 3:36:36.160]  no it isn't has nothing to do with science your little degree that you got from a little college
[3:36:36.160 --> 3:36:43.360]  that cost 150 grand doesn't entitle you to know anything about science you're just parroting
[3:36:43.360 --> 3:36:49.760]  back what they're telling you sciences actual science is when you look below the surface and
[3:36:49.760 --> 3:36:56.800]  you find out oh that's a complete fake my god they're just selling something and dressing it up
[3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:05.840]  to look like science but it's really a pig it's really a pig completely
[3:37:08.080 --> 3:37:10.800]  and that's what i've been talking about here for the last hour
[3:37:10.800 --> 3:37:20.880]  all of the conversation about the vaccine and this and that boils down to 150 people
[3:37:22.320 --> 3:37:31.040]  who will all be looked at and analyzed by these vaccine manufacturers through a fraudulent lens
[3:37:31.040 --> 3:37:43.760]  based on no science whatsoever and evaluated in order to say we now have the right to shoot
[3:37:43.760 --> 3:37:52.880]  up seven billion people with whatever we want to i don't think anybody listening here wants that
[3:37:52.880 --> 3:38:00.720]  sure they don't and i don't think anybody in the american public or anywhere in the world would want
[3:38:00.720 --> 3:38:11.520]  that if they were aware of what's actually going on there's no science going on here
[3:38:11.520 --> 3:38:23.280]  there's liability there's fraud there's what should be prison yeah that's going on for sure
[3:38:23.280 --> 3:38:28.480]  but there's no science going on there's no true data going on
[3:38:31.840 --> 3:38:37.280]  and the more people that would become aware of this including people from the so-called educated
[3:38:37.280 --> 3:38:45.760]  class the better for everybody for you me for humanity so on so
[3:38:48.720 --> 3:38:49.760]  no question about
[3:38:53.280 --> 3:38:59.200]  in my experience as a reporter for 38 years going on now it's always been that way
[3:38:59.200 --> 3:39:09.440]  somebody gets up there at a podium and you know he's basically got experience let's say
[3:39:10.560 --> 3:39:18.400]  doing voiceovers that's where he's coming from he's got a certain attitude a certain
[3:39:18.400 --> 3:39:23.680]  rectitude a certain appearance of authority and he happens to be called a scientist and he's got some
[3:39:23.680 --> 3:39:32.560]  some letters and credentials next to his name but the whole question really is can he sell you a used
[3:39:32.560 --> 3:39:40.000]  car that's all we're talking about here folks can he sell you and everybody else a used car
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:46.240]  that's going to break down about 10 minutes after you get it out of the lot or as soon as a check
[3:39:46.240 --> 3:39:56.720]  clears can he do that and if he can do that he's got a career and those of you watching are looking
[3:39:56.720 --> 3:40:07.200]  at one of those people right now dr. Fauci oh yeah of course you know of course i'm right
[3:40:07.760 --> 3:40:15.040]  of course this is science of course we're the experts of course we know what's going on of
[3:40:15.040 --> 3:40:22.240]  course this justifies police powers of course this justifies breaking into your car or your house
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:28.160]  and putting you under arrest and taking you to a facility and locking you down if necessary or
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:35.840]  giving you an angle bracelet or shooting you up with whatever we want to shoot you up with of
[3:40:35.840 --> 3:40:43.040]  course it does of course this justifies you wearing a mask and distancing yourself from
[3:40:43.040 --> 3:40:51.760]  all other human beings i mean there's no question about it of course we're going to lock you down
[3:40:51.760 --> 3:40:58.800]  again of course we're going to renew these or of course we're going to destroy the economy
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:05.120]  of course we're going to take you into a brave new world where you're completely
[3:41:05.760 --> 3:41:10.320]  under real-time moment-to-moment surveillance whatever you do so that we can
[3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:17.440]  prevent future pandemics and keep an eye on you and make sure that you behave absolutely according
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:24.080]  to rules in order to receive your government check so i mean what else you're going to live on when
[3:41:24.080 --> 3:41:30.000]  everything else is destroyed you're going to have to behave otherwise you know the amount of that
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:35.280]  check is going to get quickly produced and we have a whole system for that of course so we roll out
[3:41:35.280 --> 3:41:42.320]  it's copied on the chinese who really know what they're doing yes and we're going to institute that
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:47.440]  and build all these smart cities and that's where all the slaves are going to live and
[3:41:47.440 --> 3:41:54.800]  it's all going to be very peaceful and very calm and there's not going to be any war and you know
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:42:05.200]  as long as you obey this is science of course it is of course we know what we're doing
[3:42:07.600 --> 3:42:12.320]  we have many years of experience not only in government but in research labs and
[3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:22.160]  corporations so this is what they're selling see that's it and if millions of people and people
[3:42:22.160 --> 3:42:28.960]  are definitely waking up i mean i've talked about rallies protests demonstration so on for here
[3:42:31.440 --> 3:42:34.640]  people suddenly woke up and say well this is used car sales
[3:42:36.320 --> 3:42:41.600]  that's what i'm being given here because i can actually think a little bit about data and and
[3:42:41.600 --> 3:42:49.440]  now i see this whole thing's a con it's a complete con and what i've been falling for is the of course
[3:42:49.440 --> 3:42:58.320]  come on folks that's all people are falling for the of course the guy who gets up there and says
[3:42:58.320 --> 3:43:06.400]  of course this is science what else would it be what else would it be i'm a doctor i know
[3:43:07.760 --> 3:43:13.760]  i'm the head of an agency of the government of course i know what i'm doing of course i know
[3:43:13.760 --> 3:43:21.120]  and those other scientists and doctors who are trying to argue with us let's just say they're
[3:43:21.120 --> 3:43:30.880]  lesser lights okay they don't really know they think they know but of course i do know
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:42.320]  see i do know yeah exactly that's how thin this whole thing is that's what i'm trying to tell you
[3:43:44.560 --> 3:43:50.240]  it's like the government puts out an ad for scientists it says we're looking for the very best
[3:43:50.240 --> 3:44:00.000]  voiceover of course people so that they can make convincing presentations to the public
[3:44:00.960 --> 3:44:06.720]  they can appear at press conferences they can line up they can wear white coats they can have
[3:44:06.720 --> 3:44:13.360]  stethoscopes around their necks if we want to they can wear masks they can take off masks they can
[3:44:13.360 --> 3:44:21.760]  you know have all of the perks and they're on television most importantly we control who's on
[3:44:21.760 --> 3:44:26.880]  television that's who we're looking for that's who we're trying to employ
[3:44:28.800 --> 3:44:34.960]  and then you get a career scientist who's been in government for 38 years oh fred you're
[3:44:34.960 --> 3:44:41.520]  applying for the job yes i am yes i am okay fred we're going to give you some copy to read here
[3:44:41.520 --> 3:44:46.880]  it's a kind of a sample press release and we want you to deliver this with the sort of
[3:44:47.440 --> 3:44:56.240]  casual arrogance of the of course this is science friggin baloney that we need to sell
[3:44:56.240 --> 3:45:03.440]  to the public you think you can do that and fred says guess what of course i can do this
[3:45:04.640 --> 3:45:09.440]  of course i can do it or it says hey that's good that's exactly what we're looking for
[3:45:09.440 --> 3:45:15.040]  that's what we want that's the attitude you could be the one fred to appear
[3:45:15.680 --> 3:45:21.280]  soon the white house press conference i've given you the science i've laid out the con
[3:45:21.280 --> 3:45:38.960]  talk to you soon again
