[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, May 11th, the year is 2021.
[00:11.920 --> 00:17.320]  And this is undoubtedly the most important news we've ever broken today.
[00:17.320 --> 00:20.520]  I stayed up here late last night, but got too exhausted to finish the report.
[00:20.520 --> 00:22.000]  It'll be done in a few hours.
[00:22.000 --> 00:26.200]  And I was so pleasantly surprised when I got home and turned on Tucker Carlson to have
[00:26.200 --> 00:30.400]  dinner with my family that he scooped us, which is great.
[00:30.400 --> 00:34.160]  This is going to save civilization and society if this gets out.
[00:34.160 --> 00:37.280]  But he only told you part of the story because of the time constraints.
[00:37.280 --> 00:39.000]  We're going to give it all to you.
[00:39.000 --> 00:39.720]  Here's the headline.
[00:39.720 --> 00:43.200]  Tucker Carlson, Anthony Fauci, let the coronavirus pandemic happen.
[00:43.200 --> 00:44.320]  Well, they did it on purpose.
[00:44.320 --> 00:46.760]  Why is it they're a criminal investigation?
[00:46.760 --> 00:53.760]  Well, we have the smoking gun where the director for Bill Gates and for Fauci admitted
[00:53.760 --> 00:58.040]  to creating the five in one super virus on video.
[00:58.040 --> 00:59.040]  Here's part of what I told.
[00:59.040 --> 01:02.080]  Oh, and yesterday that we'll come back and get to the bombshell news.
[01:02.080 --> 01:03.280]  We've got five minutes left.
[01:03.280 --> 01:06.480]  Alex Jones joins me in studio.
[01:06.480 --> 01:08.400]  What is the latest, Alex?
[01:11.520 --> 01:14.440]  Rob is trying to get me to shoot as much for a port, but I've been up since like
[01:14.440 --> 01:15.080]  five a.m. working.
[01:15.080 --> 01:16.920]  I'm too exhausted right now to do it.
[01:16.920 --> 01:20.720]  But I don't want to walk out of this building without this being said.
[01:20.720 --> 01:24.800]  So let me get on the microphone out there by this huge news right now.
[01:24.800 --> 01:28.880]  And of course, the Biden administration now announcing you're not going to have power.
[01:28.880 --> 01:32.520]  You're not going to have freedom, but you will be forced to take a vaccine.
[01:32.520 --> 01:33.360]  Is that a hate crime?
[01:33.360 --> 01:34.400]  I doubt the left cares.
[01:34.400 --> 01:36.400]  Alex, what's the breaking news?
[01:36.400 --> 01:37.560]  All right.
[01:37.560 --> 01:40.880]  I just spent an hour with Rob working on this and I read all the documents.
[01:40.880 --> 01:44.280]  I watched all the videos and normally I worked till seven or eight.
[01:44.280 --> 01:46.880]  Sometimes up here, but I'm just too tired today to do it.
[01:46.880 --> 01:48.000]  I'm going to come back up here in the morning.
[01:48.000 --> 01:49.800]  I'm going to shoot the report.
[01:49.800 --> 01:51.960]  And it'll be ready.
[01:51.960 --> 01:55.160]  I would imagine by the last hour of my show tomorrow, but this is the type of stuff that
[01:55.160 --> 01:58.800]  does exhaust me in that the weight of this is so insane.
[01:58.800 --> 02:00.320]  You know, we broke here with Dr.
[02:00.320 --> 02:04.080]  Francis Boyle and all the researchers on your show and my show, you know, and thanks
[02:04.080 --> 02:07.680]  to those for supporting us on air that this came out of the lab, that it was on purpose
[02:07.680 --> 02:11.880]  and that it was a five stage Chimera virus.
[02:11.880 --> 02:14.000]  And then people spinning go, Oh, no, there is no virus.
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.640]  All that those people are incorrect.
[02:15.640 --> 02:17.640]  This is a virus for a reason.
[02:17.640 --> 02:18.360]  They want to own it.
[02:18.360 --> 02:23.360]  They want to patent it and own five diseases that they claim a vaccine will then cure.
[02:23.360 --> 02:28.000]  But to create that vaccine, they've got to then create the pathogen and then of course
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.000]  release it.
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.600]  So they can be the savers of the world, get trillions of dollars, shut down the economy
[02:33.600 --> 02:34.600]  and consolidate power.
[02:34.600 --> 02:35.600]  They have all the motives.
[02:35.600 --> 02:36.600]  That's all coming out.
[02:36.600 --> 02:41.600]  We have the documents from the Chinese military who was also brought in on this with Obama.
[02:41.600 --> 02:44.200]  It all came out of Chapel Hill.
[02:44.200 --> 02:50.360]  Well, it turns out hiding in plain view and this is already broken different places, pieces
[02:50.360 --> 02:51.360]  of it.
[02:51.360 --> 02:58.960]  But we have it all that the head scientist at Chapel Hill, the Wuhan lab and the producer,
[02:58.960 --> 03:09.960]  the main manager of all of it, all bragged in 2019 that they were creating a five part
[03:09.960 --> 03:18.080]  time era virus out of SARS and out of bats at the Wuhan lab and it's the director of
[03:18.080 --> 03:19.080]  the whole project.
[03:19.080 --> 03:20.440]  It's everything.
[03:20.440 --> 03:27.440]  And so I'm going to put it together in a entire piece and a lot of this again has already
[03:27.440 --> 03:28.440]  come out.
[03:28.440 --> 03:34.920]  But this is a new video that's been out for years actually hiding in plain view of all
[03:34.920 --> 03:37.080]  of them bragging how they did.
[03:37.080 --> 03:40.320]  And so you and then of course Fauci funded along Bill Gates and clearly they knew they
[03:40.320 --> 03:41.920]  had this on the shelf.
[03:41.920 --> 03:44.320]  They knew they even had to quote cure.
[03:44.320 --> 03:45.640]  So they launched it and did this.
[03:45.640 --> 03:49.760]  But then the even bigger lie is that it's a cure because they later admit it actually
[03:49.760 --> 03:50.760]  isn't.
[03:50.760 --> 03:53.280]  And so we're going to be bringing that out tomorrow.
[03:53.280 --> 03:57.360]  But I mean, these people are out of their minds and so they scripted this that they're
[03:57.360 --> 03:58.680]  the savers of the world.
[03:58.680 --> 04:03.560]  I was watching Fox a little while ago between your show and they had Brett Bear on there.
[04:03.560 --> 04:04.560]  What the hell's his name?
[04:04.560 --> 04:08.280]  The evidence is the Russians launched the pipeline shut down and later they go, well,
[04:08.280 --> 04:09.280]  there's no evidence of that.
[04:09.280 --> 04:15.160]  So yeah, just Chris Ray claiming it, you know, yeah, well, I mean, I mean, uh, somebody
[04:15.160 --> 04:18.560]  that was a ransomware might have bounced off an IP address in Russia.
[04:18.560 --> 04:20.360]  And they know they put out their reports.
[04:20.360 --> 04:24.080]  We've even had the vault seven releases, how they can put a fingerprint.
[04:24.080 --> 04:28.080]  It's like if I put a fake fingerprint and I go on to make the point there at the end
[04:28.080 --> 04:32.760]  of the war room that it's Biden that already shut down under 21 and 20 30.
[04:32.760 --> 04:39.560]  The keystone pipeline that supplies the oil to be refined to go to the East coast pipeline.
[04:39.560 --> 04:43.640]  So that is all coming up as well today.
[04:43.640 --> 04:47.280]  The colonial pipeline and more, but we've got the smoking gun video I talk about and
[04:47.280 --> 04:49.040]  all of it straight ahead.
[04:49.040 --> 04:52.400]  Call everybody, you know, and tell them tune in now because we either expose this global
[04:52.400 --> 04:59.000]  is takeover and how they use the virus to shut us down or they win.
[04:59.000 --> 05:04.640]  Others have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most
[05:04.640 --> 05:07.360]  of the best selling products you have that we love?
[05:07.360 --> 05:10.080]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[05:10.080 --> 05:13.880]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[05:13.880 --> 05:16.320]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[05:16.320 --> 05:19.880]  That's why info wars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would
[05:19.880 --> 05:20.880]  be buying it.
[05:20.880 --> 05:23.640]  We have the money, but so many of them have been sold out.
[05:23.640 --> 05:27.600]  Just like you notice a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization
[05:27.600 --> 05:29.200]  is being artificially imploded.
[05:29.200 --> 05:35.560]  But finally, X2 is back in stock, the good halogen deep earth crystal iodide so essential
[05:35.560 --> 05:36.560]  in your body.
[05:36.560 --> 05:37.760]  It's really the missing link.
[05:37.760 --> 05:38.760]  It's 50% off.
[05:38.760 --> 05:40.760]  We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com.
[05:40.760 --> 05:45.360]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage
[05:45.360 --> 05:49.920]  of this now, stock up and don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to forget
[05:49.920 --> 05:51.920]  how great it is and not take it myself.
[05:51.920 --> 05:55.560]  But when I do stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[05:55.560 --> 05:59.560]  This is central, it's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[05:59.560 --> 06:14.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:14.960 --> 06:16.680]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:16.680 --> 06:23.360]  Well so does he, live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:23.360 --> 06:28.920]  All right, the biggest developments in world history are taking place right now.
[06:28.920 --> 06:33.200]  If the truth comes out that the globalist through the UN and the Chai comms launched
[06:33.200 --> 06:39.720]  government 19 as a planetary shutdown economic weapon, then the vaccine is the actual bio
[06:39.720 --> 06:43.640]  weapon attacking your own body because it teaches you to attack the same protein that's
[06:43.640 --> 06:44.640]  in your body.
[06:44.640 --> 06:50.680]  If this comes out, which is starting to happen, we're like in labor and the baby's head is
[06:50.680 --> 06:55.400]  cresting, if the truth comes out, they're done.
[06:55.400 --> 07:00.600]  We'll still have evil, we'll still have corruption, there'll be new elites to deal with, but this
[07:00.600 --> 07:07.280]  current crop is burning up in front of us like Count Dracula, a hold out of his tomb
[07:07.280 --> 07:10.720]  at high noon.
[07:10.720 --> 07:18.480]  So we are about to lay the mega bombshell on you right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:18.480 --> 07:21.840]  Now I told you at the end of the war yesterday that the biggest news yet was coming out,
[07:21.840 --> 07:23.360]  but I would break it today.
[07:23.360 --> 07:30.600]  Tucker Carlson broke it last night and he gave you about 80% of it.
[07:30.600 --> 07:33.640]  But the clip he didn't play, and we're going to get to that after we play the Tucker Carlson
[07:33.640 --> 07:39.000]  report a part of it, is that the director of the program under Faucian Gates, on record
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.920]  funded by them, four million bucks for just six programs, they funded some others as well
[07:42.920 --> 07:50.000]  at the Lulon lab, gave an interview and admitted they were splicing five viruses together as
[07:50.000 --> 07:55.760]  a bio weapon that then produced a quote vaccine for it, and that they got emergency authorization
[07:55.760 --> 07:57.960]  to do it.
[07:57.960 --> 08:02.360]  This is game over for these people, ladies and gentlemen, if the public ever grasps this
[08:02.360 --> 08:06.320]  and it's starting to come out, you can't hide something this big, here's Tucker Carlson
[08:06.320 --> 08:09.000]  and we'll come back with the rest of the story.
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.400]  You're never taking off the mask.
[08:11.400 --> 08:16.960]  Get ready for a lifetime of filthy, wet cotton covering your mouth, reduced oxygen flow to
[08:16.960 --> 08:23.120]  your brain, and a world where every stranger looks the same because no one has a face.
[08:23.120 --> 08:27.000]  When Kamala Harris and her husband kissed the other day while wearing masks, they were
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.120]  giving you a preview of your daughter's wedding.
[08:30.120 --> 08:33.880]  In a masked world, human beings never really touch each other.
[08:33.880 --> 08:35.320]  Is that public health?
[08:35.320 --> 08:38.840]  No, it's not public health, it's a kind of punishment.
[08:38.840 --> 08:42.000]  Tony Fauci is punishing the country, you ask everyone.
[08:42.000 --> 08:43.440]  The question is, why is he doing that?
[08:43.440 --> 08:45.560]  Maybe he likes it, that's possible.
[08:45.560 --> 08:50.520]  But you've got to think that at least part of Tony Fauci's authoritarian germ hysteria
[08:50.520 --> 08:52.760]  is a cover for something else.
[08:52.760 --> 08:58.080]  Could it be that Tony Fauci is trying to divert attention from himself and his own personal
[08:58.080 --> 09:00.320]  role in the COVID-19 pandemic?
[09:00.320 --> 09:03.520]  Now, what do we mean by that?
[09:03.520 --> 09:09.080]  We cannot recommend more strongly a new piece by Nicholas Wade, who for more than 50 years
[09:09.080 --> 09:13.240]  has been one of the preeminent science writers in the world.
[09:13.240 --> 09:17.000]  For 30 years, Nicholas Wade worked for the New York Times, he edited the science section
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.680]  there, but this piece did not run in the New York Times, it ran on Medium.
[09:20.680 --> 09:25.160]  And the piece explains where this virus almost certainly came from.
[09:25.160 --> 09:29.880]  In it, Nicholas Wade makes it clear that more than any other single-living American, Tony
[09:29.880 --> 09:36.200]  Fauci is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
[09:36.200 --> 09:41.080]  Wade lays out a nearly insurmountably large amount of evidence that this virus originated
[09:41.080 --> 09:44.080]  at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in central China.
[09:44.080 --> 09:47.320]  It seemed to make sense this show and others had raised the possibility from the early
[09:47.320 --> 09:49.840]  days of the pandemic.
[09:49.840 --> 09:53.200]  But this piece all but proves it.
[09:53.200 --> 09:57.880]  At the time the outbreak began last fall, the Wuhan lab was conducting experiments on
[09:57.880 --> 10:01.280]  how to make bat viruses infectious to human beings.
[10:01.280 --> 10:04.480]  Those experiments were funded by American tax dollars.
[10:04.480 --> 10:11.080]  Those experiments were, their funding, approved and directed by Tony Fauci in Washington.
[10:11.080 --> 10:12.080]  By Tony Fauci.
[10:12.080 --> 10:15.440]  That is hard to believe, but it's true and the piece lays it out.
[10:15.440 --> 10:19.040]  Many of the Wuhan experiments fell under the direction of a Chinese researcher called
[10:19.040 --> 10:21.840]  Xi Zeng Li, known as the Bat Lady.
[10:21.840 --> 10:24.920]  She was China's leading expert on bat-borne viruses.
[10:24.920 --> 10:30.600]  Her job was to genetically engineer coronaviruses so that they infect human beings and do so
[10:30.600 --> 10:32.880]  as easily as possible.
[10:32.880 --> 10:37.240]  This work, Nicholas Wade notes, involved, quote, doing gain-of-function experiments
[10:37.240 --> 10:41.800]  designed to make coronavirus infect human cells.
[10:41.800 --> 10:44.200]  Now why was this research going on?
[10:44.200 --> 10:47.320]  We'll have to ask the scientists who did it.
[10:47.320 --> 10:51.560]  But the fact remains these were some of the most dangerous experiments ever conducted
[10:51.560 --> 10:53.040]  by mankind.
[10:53.040 --> 10:57.040]  And yet we know that China was not taking necessary safety precautions and we should
[10:57.040 --> 10:58.680]  not be surprised by that.
[10:58.680 --> 11:03.240]  Several years ago, American diplomatic cables warned about low and lack standards at the
[11:03.240 --> 11:04.240]  Wuhan lab.
[11:04.240 --> 11:09.000]  In fact, the Wuhan facility was classified as a biosafety level two laboratory.
[11:09.000 --> 11:10.840]  What does that mean?
[11:10.840 --> 11:15.520]  Well according to Richard Ebright, who's a molecular biologist at Rutgers, that is approximately
[11:15.520 --> 11:21.240]  the same level of safety that you would find in a dentist's office in America.
[11:21.240 --> 11:28.400]  So that lab conducting research experiments on the coronavirus and how to make it transmissible
[11:28.400 --> 11:33.520]  to human beings resulted almost certainly in the infection of a lab researcher and the
[11:33.520 --> 11:35.120]  virus spread from there.
[11:35.120 --> 11:40.440]  The first coronavirus patients, in fact, did not come from the so-called wet market,
[11:40.440 --> 11:43.560]  as we heard, that was a lie.
[11:43.560 --> 11:48.240]  The first patients of the coronavirus, in fact, were employees at the Wuhan Institute
[11:48.240 --> 11:51.560]  of Virology at the lab.
[11:51.560 --> 11:56.320]  So once again, why would the Wuhan lab be conducting experiments like that in the first
[11:56.320 --> 11:57.320]  place?
[11:57.320 --> 12:01.400]  Well, we know that Tony Fauci had authorized payment for the research.
[12:01.400 --> 12:06.840]  For five years from 2014 to 2019, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
[12:06.840 --> 12:10.800]  which Tony Fauci runs and has for decades, pumped money to a group called the EcoHealth
[12:10.800 --> 12:11.800]  Alliance.
[12:11.800 --> 12:16.880]  The EcoHealth Alliance is run by a man whose name he may recognize, Dr. Peter Dazik.
[12:16.880 --> 12:21.480]  Dazik contracted with Dr. Sheet to conduct gain-of-function experiments at the Wuhan
[12:21.480 --> 12:23.000]  lab.
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.720]  Just before the pandemic became public knowledge on December 9, 2019, Peter Dazik sat for an
[12:28.720 --> 12:31.000]  interview that was streamed online.
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.960]  In that interview, Dazik bragged about how easy it is to manipulate coronaviruses in
[12:35.960 --> 12:38.240]  lab experiments.
[12:38.240 --> 12:39.240]  Coronaviruses are pretty good.
[12:39.240 --> 12:44.040]  I mean, Virology, she knows all this stuff, but you can manipulate them in the lab pretty
[12:44.040 --> 12:45.040]  easily.
[12:45.040 --> 12:50.360]  The spike protein drives a lot of what happens with the coronavirus, zoonotic risk.
[12:50.360 --> 12:53.720]  So you can get the sequence, you can build the protein, and we work with Ralph Barrick
[12:53.720 --> 13:04.480]  at UNC to do this, insert it into backbone of another virus and do some work in the lab.
[13:04.480 --> 13:11.120]  So just days after that was shot, it became clear that this new version of coronavirus,
[13:11.120 --> 13:17.040]  this novel coronavirus, what we now call COVID-19, was running rampant through Wuhan, then China,
[13:17.040 --> 13:18.960]  and then the world.
[13:18.960 --> 13:23.600]  Since then, since the pandemic began, Peter Dazik, not surprisingly, has appeared on virtually
[13:23.600 --> 13:28.720]  every media platform available to him to deny, in the most strenuous and dismissive terms,
[13:28.720 --> 13:32.880]  that the Wuhan lab could be in any way linked to the outbreak, since, of course, he has
[13:32.880 --> 13:35.800]  very personal motives for claiming that quote.
[13:35.800 --> 13:40.800]  The idea that this virus escaped from the lab is just pure baloney, he said last year,
[13:40.800 --> 13:43.560]  but that was a lie, it's not pure baloney.
[13:43.560 --> 13:46.040]  And a lot of smart people knew that right away.
[13:46.040 --> 13:50.280]  One of those people is Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute at Harvard
[13:50.280 --> 13:51.840]  and MIT.
[13:51.840 --> 13:57.280]  She bravely wrote a paper about how the coronavirus's genome hadn't changed much over time and
[13:57.280 --> 14:03.840]  that was odd, because that genome had gone through trillions of replications.
[14:03.840 --> 14:09.600]  According to Chan, that fact implied that the virus was designed for human-to-human transmission
[14:09.600 --> 14:10.920]  from the outset.
[14:10.920 --> 14:15.680]  The former director of the CDC also clearly understood this, and he too argued that the
[14:15.680 --> 14:19.520]  virus came from the Wuhan lab.
[14:19.520 --> 14:26.800]  I am of the point of view that I still think the most likely etiology of this pathogen
[14:26.800 --> 14:31.920]  in Wuhan was from a laboratory, you know, escaped.
[14:31.920 --> 14:35.440]  Other people don't believe that, that's fine, science will eventually figure it out.
[14:35.440 --> 14:39.600]  It's not unusual for respiratory pathogens that are being worked on in a laboratory to
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.240]  infect a laboratory worker.
[14:44.240 --> 14:47.440]  Millions of people have died of COVID-19.
[14:47.440 --> 14:52.720]  So it's not a matter of score settling or blame assignment to figure out where it came
[14:52.720 --> 14:53.720]  from.
[14:53.720 --> 14:58.800]  If you want to prevent the next global pandemic, you have to figure out how this one started.
[14:58.800 --> 15:02.160]  And so the World Health Organization said it would get to the bottom of it.
[15:02.160 --> 15:05.480]  The World Health Organization, of course, is beholden to China.
[15:05.480 --> 15:09.120]  And so it tried to hide the basic facts of the origins of this pandemic.
[15:09.120 --> 15:15.440]  And to hide those facts, WHO appointed none other than Peter Dasek as the only America-based
[15:15.440 --> 15:20.240]  representative on the investigative team looking into where the virus came from.
[15:20.240 --> 15:24.240]  In what turned out to be a sham report, that team concluded that it's, quote, extremely
[15:24.240 --> 15:26.720]  unlikely that the virus came from the Wuhan lab.
[15:26.720 --> 15:28.120]  Again, that's not true.
[15:28.120 --> 15:32.720]  The WHO's investigation into the origins of the virus was fraudulent.
[15:32.720 --> 15:35.160]  And that matters to public health globally.
[15:35.160 --> 16:05.120]  But one thing you'll notice is that Tony Fauci did not say that.
[16:05.120 --> 16:10.600]  For the first time, the bio-pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation
[16:10.600 --> 16:12.400]  products to the everyday consumer.
[16:12.400 --> 16:17.280]  Their first product they are launching is called BioCeptic Pro, a product specifically designed
[16:17.280 --> 16:20.000]  to establish a healthy septic system.
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.240]  BioCeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[16:24.240 --> 16:26.200]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[16:26.200 --> 16:28.600]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[16:28.600 --> 16:33.720]  Say goodbye to septic problems, gas buildup, and odor guaranteed.
[16:33.720 --> 16:37.440]  BioSeptic Pro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[16:37.440 --> 16:41.720]  They have a revolutionary patent delivery system that carries live microorganisms to
[16:41.720 --> 16:46.680]  treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times more effective than
[16:46.680 --> 16:47.680]  its competitors.
[16:47.680 --> 16:51.840]  BioSeptic Pro is safer plumbing, human, animal, and aquatic life.
[16:51.840 --> 16:58.720]  Secure your BioSeptic Pro today at vbiopros.com for anaerobic septic tanks, vbiopros.com.
[16:58.720 --> 17:05.240]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the shutdown
[17:05.240 --> 17:10.360]  of the East Coast Gasoline Pipeline that goes from Houston right up through New York City
[17:10.360 --> 17:13.120]  and supplies more than half of the gasoline to the East Coast.
[17:13.120 --> 17:18.120]  But who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline from Canada through the Midwest
[17:18.120 --> 17:23.280]  to Houston to refine the oil that's then turned into gas and sent to the East Coast?
[17:23.280 --> 17:28.600]  That's right, Joe Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline right after it was completed.
[17:28.600 --> 17:30.760]  Joe Biden did that to America.
[17:30.760 --> 17:31.760]  He has the history.
[17:31.760 --> 17:32.760]  He has the background.
[17:32.760 --> 17:36.280]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels.
[17:36.280 --> 17:40.440]  He's the one that's trying to extend the lockdowns of the country.
[17:40.440 --> 17:44.720]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world,
[17:44.720 --> 17:49.160]  and they want the United States, Europe, and Australia crippled so Communist China can
[17:49.160 --> 17:50.160]  be dominant.
[17:50.160 --> 17:51.800]  It's not Russia that's the enemy.
[17:51.800 --> 17:56.520]  It's Communist China and their millions like Joe Biden in control of the White House.
[17:56.520 --> 17:57.520]  That's the facts.
[17:57.520 --> 18:01.040]  That's the information.
[18:01.040 --> 18:22.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:22.040 --> 18:24.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[18:24.280 --> 18:28.280]  We're breaking the biggest news we have ever brought out on air.
[18:28.280 --> 18:31.680]  It is incredible what's happening.
[18:31.680 --> 18:38.520]  The lab manager for the COVID-19 gain of function research being done at Chapel Hill had it
[18:38.520 --> 18:49.920]  moved with the scientist at Wuhan and then admits on video to merging five viruses together
[18:49.920 --> 18:56.400]  to be able to then deploy them and infect humans.
[18:56.400 --> 18:57.400]  It's all on video.
[18:57.400 --> 18:58.400]  I have the video.
[18:58.400 --> 19:00.560]  I'll play it in a moment.
[19:00.560 --> 19:06.400]  He did the interview in late 2019, right as this was all breaking out.
[19:06.400 --> 19:08.640]  There it is on screen.
[19:08.640 --> 19:13.200]  He then wrote the report but told people to keep his name off of it.
[19:13.200 --> 19:14.200]  That's come out.
[19:14.200 --> 19:18.360]  Journalists have gotten the emails saying there was no connection to being man-made and then
[19:18.360 --> 19:23.120]  using the media and governments to suppress the Australian government at the Indian universities
[19:23.120 --> 19:27.080]  that scan the virus and said it was man-made.
[19:27.080 --> 19:28.080]  Five different viruses.
[19:28.080 --> 19:34.240]  He's on video saying five different viruses were combined.
[19:34.240 --> 19:36.360]  What a bombshell.
[19:36.360 --> 19:38.160]  He confesses to it.
[19:38.160 --> 19:43.720]  Now, I have Alfie Oaks talking about the pipeline shutdown, the food shortages.
[19:43.720 --> 19:46.920]  He's one of the biggest producers of food in Florida, if not the biggest.
[19:46.920 --> 19:49.160]  He doesn't just own grocery stores.
[19:49.160 --> 19:52.560]  His real business is growing food.
[19:52.560 --> 19:57.640]  I wanted to get his expert take on the inflation we're seeing and where that's going, selling
[19:57.640 --> 20:02.480]  food to grocery stores across the South and across Florida.
[20:02.480 --> 20:06.080]  I got Ted Nugent coming on about the attack on guns, the open borders, and we're still
[20:06.080 --> 20:07.080]  going to have them on.
[20:07.080 --> 20:08.880]  Those are big guess.
[20:08.880 --> 20:13.480]  When Nugent leaves us at the bottom of the next hour, I'm going to drill into my analysis
[20:13.480 --> 20:17.440]  and the complete rest of the story, because again, I love being scooped by Tucker.
[20:17.440 --> 20:18.920]  I didn't send Tucker the story.
[20:18.920 --> 20:20.800]  We were working on it for a couple of days.
[20:20.800 --> 20:23.120]  We already had all the pieces.
[20:23.120 --> 20:27.200]  I told people we were going to break it today, but Tucker already had a big piece of it.
[20:27.200 --> 20:32.480]  But the rest of it that he had there is the smoking gun, where he says we took all the
[20:32.480 --> 20:34.400]  viruses and we're putting them together.
[20:34.400 --> 20:37.600]  Do you realize how big that is?
[20:37.600 --> 20:41.480]  And then now the fact that the former top science writer, the New York Times, they won't
[20:41.480 --> 20:46.120]  publish it, so he went to Medium and other publications and put it out, and Zero Hedge
[20:46.120 --> 20:51.040]  before he put that out, put out a 30-page report that we're posting in the live show
[20:51.040 --> 20:53.800]  feed today of InfoWars.com and tailing it all.
[20:53.800 --> 20:56.120]  But this is incredible.
[20:56.120 --> 20:58.400]  It's worse than we even thought.
[20:58.400 --> 21:02.080]  Definitely premeditated, released to bring down our economies, consolidate power, and
[21:02.080 --> 21:06.600]  then bring in the bio-weapon that Fauci also tested knowing these coronavirus vaccines
[21:06.600 --> 21:10.920]  will attack the protein in the body with that particular protein spike.
[21:10.920 --> 21:16.720]  So this is a multi-phase attack, all premeditated, all launched, and they even did their cover
[21:16.720 --> 21:19.880]  story so that ever came out, they'd say, hey, I hit it in plain view.
[21:19.880 --> 21:20.880]  It's incredible.
[21:20.880 --> 21:27.040]  But here's the rest of Tucker Carlson last night historically saying Fauci let the coronavirus
[21:27.040 --> 21:28.040]  pandemic happen.
[21:28.040 --> 21:29.280]  Well, he actually engineered it.
[21:29.280 --> 21:31.120]  Why is it they're a criminal investigation?
[21:31.120 --> 21:32.120]  Here it is.
[21:32.120 --> 21:34.960]  One thing you'll notice is that Tony Fauci did not say that.
[21:34.960 --> 21:35.960]  Why?
[21:35.960 --> 21:40.080]  Because once again, he is implicated in it personally.
[21:40.080 --> 21:43.960]  The gain-of-function research that Peter Dasek was bragging about in the video we just showed
[21:43.960 --> 21:47.680]  you had, in fact, been banned explicitly by the US government.
[21:47.680 --> 21:52.800]  There was a federal moratorium on the funding of exactly the kind of gain-of-function experiments
[21:52.800 --> 21:56.240]  that went on in the Wuhan lab to disaster its effects.
[21:56.240 --> 22:02.560]  So why didn't the US government halt its funding of the lab in Wuhan?
[22:02.560 --> 22:06.320]  That is a central question, and Nicholas Wade, to his great credit, looked into it, and here's
[22:06.320 --> 22:07.320]  what he found.
[22:07.320 --> 22:10.880]  Someone wrote a loophole into the moratorium.
[22:10.880 --> 22:15.840]  The moratorium specifically barred funding of any gain-of-function research that increased
[22:15.840 --> 22:21.040]  the pathogenicity of the flu, MERS, or SARS viruses.
[22:21.040 --> 22:25.640]  But then a footnote on page two of the moratorium document states that, quote, an exception
[22:25.640 --> 22:30.360]  from the research pause may be obtained if the head of the US government funding agency
[22:30.360 --> 22:36.880]  determines that the research is urgently necessary to protect the public health or national security.
[22:36.880 --> 22:40.680]  And that's exactly the loophole that was exploited.
[22:40.680 --> 22:42.720]  Who signed off on this?
[22:42.720 --> 22:47.560]  Tony Fauci, possibly along with Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, invoked that special
[22:47.560 --> 22:53.920]  exemption in order to keep funding the Wuhan lab and the deadly experiments that were going
[22:53.920 --> 22:58.440]  on there, the experiments that clearly went so wrong.
[22:58.440 --> 23:03.400]  According to Richard E. Bright, quote, unfortunately, the NIAID director, that would be Fauci,
[23:03.400 --> 23:08.320]  and the NIH director, exploited this loophole to issue exemptions to projects subject to
[23:08.320 --> 23:14.080]  pause, preposterously asserting that the exempted research was, quote, urgently necessary to
[23:14.080 --> 23:19.520]  protect public health or national security, and thereby nullifying the pause.
[23:19.520 --> 23:25.440]  This wouldn't have happened if Tony Fauci didn't allow it to happen.
[23:25.440 --> 23:27.760]  That is clear.
[23:27.760 --> 23:28.760]  It's an amazing story.
[23:28.760 --> 23:30.920]  It is a shocking story.
[23:30.920 --> 23:34.400]  In a functional country, there would be a criminal investigation currently underway
[23:34.400 --> 23:39.720]  into Tony Fauci's role in the COVID pandemic that has killed millions and halted our country
[23:39.720 --> 23:41.480]  and changed it forever.
[23:41.480 --> 23:46.080]  So why isn't there a criminal investigation into Tony Fauci's role in this pandemic?
[23:46.080 --> 23:47.320]  All right.
[23:47.320 --> 23:51.800]  Again, it's an hour-long interview with Peter Dazak.
[23:51.800 --> 23:55.320]  We're going to have the whole thing posted to the Band-Aid video, so in case they try
[23:55.320 --> 23:56.560]  to take it down.
[23:56.560 --> 24:02.520]  In the full Tucker Carlson 14-minute dialogue, it's also been posted because Fox isn't posting
[24:02.520 --> 24:03.680]  that on YouTube.
[24:03.680 --> 24:04.680]  They always post this full show.
[24:04.680 --> 24:06.840]  They always post clips, but they're not doing it.
[24:06.840 --> 24:12.440]  So the interest of public interest, I'm posting it to Band-Aid video for commentary and analysis
[24:12.440 --> 24:16.360]  and historic reference.
[24:16.360 --> 24:19.880]  But at the bottom of the next hour, because I'm not canceling out the Oaks, I already
[24:19.880 --> 24:22.160]  did it yesterday, and I'm not canceling Ted Nugent.
[24:22.160 --> 24:23.920]  They're here, and it all ties together.
[24:23.920 --> 24:29.360]  But after they're gone in an hour and five minutes from now, I am going to, you see this
[24:29.360 --> 24:30.920]  stack right here?
[24:30.920 --> 24:36.040]  This is all the documents he's talking about and the videos of total open and shut case.
[24:36.040 --> 24:40.800]  There isn't a grand jury in America, if I had a day to show them this, and the clips would
[24:40.800 --> 24:45.720]  not indict Fauci and indict Peter Dazak and all these people, and Bill Gates.
[24:45.720 --> 24:49.240]  So you wonder why Bill Gates's wife split with him last week?
[24:49.240 --> 24:51.480]  It's because of all this crap's coming out.
[24:51.480 --> 24:54.040]  And by the way, Jeffrey Epstein was heavily involved as well.
[24:54.040 --> 24:59.520]  This was their big plan to take the world over, and they still might succeed unless
[24:59.520 --> 25:02.480]  we're willing to get censored and attacked and killed.
[25:02.480 --> 25:06.040]  I mean, the globalists have told me, you know, you're dead if you don't shut up.
[25:06.040 --> 25:07.040]  And what did I tell them a couple of weeks ago?
[25:07.040 --> 25:08.040]  I said, let's go.
[25:08.040 --> 25:10.360]  It's not some macho pissing contest.
[25:10.360 --> 25:15.400]  I am not bowing to you, murderers, and signing on to all the millions you just killed.
[25:15.400 --> 25:16.720]  I'm not with you, okay?
[25:16.720 --> 25:17.720]  I'm against you.
[25:17.720 --> 25:18.720]  You know what that means?
[25:18.720 --> 25:20.480]  It means I'm at war with you.
[25:20.480 --> 25:21.480]  And I get it.
[25:21.480 --> 25:23.560]  And I expect whatever happens, happens.
[25:23.560 --> 25:24.560]  People have to have that attitude.
[25:24.560 --> 25:27.840]  That's what created freedom is people willing to fight for freedom and not roll over.
[25:27.840 --> 25:32.400]  But I'm going to tell you, Fauci and Gates and all of them are going to be lucky if they
[25:32.400 --> 25:36.760]  just spend the rest of their lives in prison after we have Nuremberg trials.
[25:36.760 --> 25:40.680]  A lot of them, if justice is done through the courts, I'm not calling for outside the
[25:40.680 --> 25:45.080]  courts to vigilante stuff, but I believe they should be tried for treason and biological
[25:45.080 --> 25:46.800]  warfare under the Nuremberg Code.
[25:46.800 --> 25:51.320]  And I believe just like Nazi scientists, they should be executed.
[25:51.320 --> 25:52.320]  And that's what I stand for.
[25:52.320 --> 25:55.120]  I stand for justice against these criminals.
[25:55.120 --> 25:56.680]  And we'll see who wins at the end of this.
[25:56.680 --> 25:57.680]  But I know this.
[25:57.680 --> 25:58.680]  I'm with God.
[25:58.680 --> 25:59.680]  And that's what really matters.
[25:59.680 --> 26:03.240]  God watches over our battlefields, over our lives, and over our children, and over our
[26:03.240 --> 26:04.240]  destiny.
[26:04.240 --> 26:06.960]  And I put my hands into Jesus Christ's hands.
[26:06.960 --> 26:12.080]  I put my soul into Christ's orbit, and I commit myself to God.
[26:12.080 --> 26:13.080]  All right.
[26:13.080 --> 26:14.080]  I got to go to break.
[26:14.080 --> 26:19.040]  I got Alfie Oaks coming on, one of the biggest food producers on the East Coast to tell you
[26:19.040 --> 26:22.200]  what's really going on with the giant food price increases that are already here and
[26:22.200 --> 26:23.200]  coming.
[26:23.200 --> 26:27.800]  Don't forget, you have until tomorrow night at midnight that it's got to end to get last
[26:27.800 --> 26:31.600]  year's prices on high quality, affordable food ready to ship to you within days.
[26:31.600 --> 26:34.800]  They ship it out the next day from five locations across the country.
[26:34.800 --> 26:35.800]  Preparewithalix.com.
[26:35.800 --> 26:38.720]  It's the lowest prices anywhere on the highest quality food.
[26:38.720 --> 26:41.960]  Last year's prices still, and then they're going to have to go up a few weeks even over
[26:41.960 --> 26:42.960]  the special.
[26:42.960 --> 26:46.720]  So I would go to preparewithalix.com, where you find the sublink, storeablefood, and
[26:46.720 --> 26:51.560]  infoorstore.com, or call toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three,
[26:51.560 --> 26:52.560]  nine.
[26:52.560 --> 26:57.240]  They need to be arrested and tried for biological war crimes against humanity.
[26:57.240 --> 26:59.680]  The world is awakening.
[26:59.680 --> 27:03.200]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[27:03.200 --> 27:08.520]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[27:08.520 --> 27:14.520]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome.
[27:14.520 --> 27:19.680]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to
[27:19.680 --> 27:24.280]  come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[27:24.280 --> 27:27.400]  We have forced them out in the open.
[27:27.400 --> 27:31.320]  So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to happen.
[27:31.320 --> 27:33.240]  Realize humanity is winning.
[27:33.240 --> 27:38.400]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[27:38.400 --> 27:39.840]  That is invincible.
[27:39.840 --> 27:43.120]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[27:43.120 --> 27:48.000]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.720]  against the globalists and realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my
[27:51.720 --> 27:52.920]  crew to you.
[27:52.920 --> 27:58.760]  We will never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender.
[27:58.760 --> 28:02.120]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[28:02.120 --> 28:06.440]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[28:06.440 --> 28:11.160]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[28:11.160 --> 28:15.680]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[28:15.680 --> 28:20.440]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[28:20.440 --> 28:26.200]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[28:26.200 --> 28:32.200]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[28:32.200 --> 28:38.840]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[28:38.840 --> 28:43.440]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[28:43.440 --> 28:49.400]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[28:49.400 --> 28:52.040]  facts that pertain to reality.
[28:52.040 --> 29:09.400]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[29:09.400 --> 29:24.540]  Everyone else has already raised prices way more than my Patreon.
[29:24.540 --> 29:30.200]  We have their entire spectrum and catalog at InfowarsStore.com, ParaDalex.com.
[29:30.200 --> 29:36.200]  You get an additional 10% off on 3 months, 6 months, your supplies, and everything else
[29:36.200 --> 29:37.560]  on the site.
[29:37.560 --> 29:39.080]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[29:39.080 --> 29:43.680]  I would take advantage of this with what's happening in food price increases around the world
[29:43.680 --> 29:49.840]  I predict that by the fall you're going to see major shortages. You're going to see huge price increases
[29:49.840 --> 29:54.440]  I think it's a smart bet right now to get high-quality storeable food at last year's prices
[29:54.440 --> 29:57.520]  Well, you still can at preparewithalex.com
[29:58.280 --> 30:04.520]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting patients
[30:04.520 --> 30:11.800]  Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women and children with uranium and plutonium
[30:11.800 --> 30:17.520]  at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many of the test subjects
[30:17.520 --> 30:22.520]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made
[30:22.520 --> 30:27.520]  14 years ago we tracked and documented the Boulderburg Group's activities and their plan for a great reset
[30:27.520 --> 30:33.520]  using the threat of a fake virus. The film now is more important than ever. When it shot to number one on Amazon last year
[30:33.520 --> 30:38.520]  they banned it. We have it back in print. Available now at infowarstore.com
[30:38.520 --> 30:42.520]  Selling them as low as $3.95 a piece of the environment bulk and there's a zero country code
[30:42.520 --> 30:47.520]  So anywhere on the planet you can make copies. In fact, I want you to make copies. You are the Paul Revere's
[30:47.520 --> 30:54.520]  1776 worldwide, 1776 worldwide, in-game blueprint for global enslavement. Available now at infowarstore.com
[30:54.520 --> 31:04.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[31:24.520 --> 31:53.520]  Well, I'd like to go to the source to find out what's really happening in the economy.
[31:53.520 --> 31:59.520]  In most companies, most grocery stores in the United States buy from farming consortiums
[31:59.520 --> 32:08.520]  or they buy from overseas, but Alfie Oaks, who owns some big, really nice first-class grocery stores
[32:08.520 --> 32:12.520]  probably the nicest I've ever been to in the United States or anywhere in the world
[32:12.520 --> 32:17.520]  and I had a chance to, a few months ago, go to Naples and visit his flagship there
[32:17.520 --> 32:23.520]  but then I was talking to other people in the industry, they said, well, you know Alfie Oaks
[32:23.520 --> 32:27.520]  sells billions of dollars of produce all over Florida and all over areas of the South
[32:27.520 --> 32:32.520]  and then he actually grows it in the U.S. and I knew he did that, but he wasn't, I guess, bragging
[32:32.520 --> 32:38.520]  he was on my show about the fact that the grocery stores are like a small part, almost a hobby of what he does
[32:38.520 --> 32:43.520]  compared to that. So I wanted to talk about food price increases going on. I wanted to talk about
[32:43.520 --> 32:47.520]  why that's happening, where he sees that really going. They have a global index out of Bloomberg
[32:47.520 --> 32:51.520]  that's been very accurate over the years. It shows current crop purchases through the summer
[32:51.520 --> 32:56.520]  are going to be up 76% of what they were previously. That's going to cause major civil unrest.
[32:56.520 --> 33:02.520]  Then you've got the Keystone XL pipeline that was opening a few months ago.
[33:02.520 --> 33:07.520]  It got closed to bring in all the oil from Canada and around the Midwest down to Houston to be refined
[33:07.520 --> 33:13.520]  and then sent up the Colonial pipeline to these posts. So Biden shut that down.
[33:13.520 --> 33:16.520]  They say some shadowy hacker group did it. They say they want to post industrial America.
[33:16.520 --> 33:20.520]  He said he would kill fossil fuels. I believe the main suspect is Biden now blaming Russia.
[33:20.520 --> 33:25.520]  That's just where the historical evidence is. He already shut down our main other pipeline.
[33:25.520 --> 33:29.520]  Well, why wouldn't he shut down the other? He shut down the pipeline that supplies the raw material.
[33:29.520 --> 33:35.520]  So joining us to talk about the raw material from seed to table.
[33:35.520 --> 33:41.520]  Oaks grocery stores. Obviously, his name Alfie Oaks, self-made man.
[33:41.520 --> 33:44.520]  Thank you so much for joining us. My friend, it was great to have dinner with you
[33:44.520 --> 33:47.520]  and hang out with you at your flagship store there in Naples.
[33:47.520 --> 33:51.520]  What can you tell us as somebody who's on the ground?
[33:51.520 --> 33:58.520]  Well, I guess I'd like to start out first by saying that every single thing that we watched this
[33:58.520 --> 34:03.520]  by the administration do, everything has been to destroy this country.
[34:03.520 --> 34:11.520]  So I don't know how deep you have to have your head in the sand to think anything else.
[34:11.520 --> 34:17.520]  And I know you've covered a lot of that. And every day that goes by, it's more and more mind-blowing to me
[34:17.520 --> 34:25.520]  to see how many decisions that are coming out of this White House that are specifically to destroy the country.
[34:25.520 --> 34:37.520]  We know that when the socialists take over, globalists take over, there's several things that have to take place.
[34:37.520 --> 34:43.520]  They want to control the media. They want to control the education, control the minds of our children.
[34:43.520 --> 34:49.520]  They want to divide our country. But the other thing that they've always done,
[34:49.520 --> 34:57.520]  you go back to every single country where they've taken over, whether it be in Venezuela or even in Russia or Cuba,
[34:57.520 --> 35:01.520]  and what they used to do is they used to go and just put a bullet in the farmer's head.
[35:01.520 --> 35:05.520]  They would put the bullet in the farmer's head and stop the food supply
[35:05.520 --> 35:09.520]  because these are all things that are necessary to crush the nation.
[35:09.520 --> 35:15.520]  So this time, thank God, I guess for me, we have 3,200 acres that we farm.
[35:15.520 --> 35:19.520]  And I guess I'm thankful that they're not coming and putting the bullet in my head.
[35:19.520 --> 35:26.520]  But in other ways, they are. And they've been working on this for a long time as they've been working on everything else.
[35:26.520 --> 35:31.520]  You got Bill Gates buying up massive, massive amounts of the farmland.
[35:31.520 --> 35:45.520]  When Barack Obama put the head of Monsanto in charge of the FDA, we were moving in the wrong direction there.
[35:45.520 --> 35:50.520]  Monsanto now owned by Bayer owns the vast majority of the world's seed supply.
[35:50.520 --> 35:55.520]  And then even worse than that, the products that they put together right now,
[35:55.520 --> 36:00.520]  like the wheat that's grown in the United States is illegal to sell in most of the countries.
[36:00.520 --> 36:07.520]  Most of the stuff that we eat here, that product that is in 98% of the food that we eat is toxic,
[36:07.520 --> 36:11.520]  and it's banned in most of the countries in Europe.
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.520]  So they've been destroying our food supply, and it is scary.
[36:16.520 --> 36:18.520]  As a farmer, I've got way ahead on seed.
[36:18.520 --> 36:26.520]  I spent $8 or $9 million on extra seeds for the future just concerned about what direction it's going to go
[36:26.520 --> 36:31.520]  because they're going to clamp down here, we can see the writing on the wall.
[36:31.520 --> 36:34.520]  Well, that's right, and that's why I appreciate you doing your busy schedule coming on
[36:34.520 --> 36:38.520]  because you don't just have your own farms or you buy from other local farms as well.
[36:38.520 --> 36:42.520]  And then I learned that you really supply a lot of the other big grocery store chains in your state
[36:42.520 --> 36:46.520]  and that there's not a lot of people that do the model you're doing.
[36:46.520 --> 36:50.520]  We've always been very vertically integrated here.
[36:50.520 --> 36:52.520]  We do our own distribution.
[36:52.520 --> 36:57.520]  Our food is being consumed all around the country, and even in Canada,
[36:57.520 --> 37:00.520]  Canada businesses are really down.
[37:00.520 --> 37:05.520]  They've really had, as you know, just insane lockdowns there.
[37:05.520 --> 37:13.520]  My Canadian business used to be some of the most vibrant for certain commodities,
[37:13.520 --> 37:16.520]  the best business we had, and it's down to nothing.
[37:16.520 --> 37:18.520]  I don't even know what the people must be eating up there.
[37:18.520 --> 37:22.520]  They must be eating a lot of canned goods or fasting or something
[37:22.520 --> 37:24.520]  because they're not using any produce right now.
[37:24.520 --> 37:26.520]  It's really scary.
[37:26.520 --> 37:34.520]  But to go further, I don't know where it's going to go.
[37:34.520 --> 37:36.520]  We see inflation on everything.
[37:36.520 --> 37:40.520]  I mean, we see all these policies are meant to hurt one person.
[37:40.520 --> 37:45.520]  It's always mind-blowing how the left tries to be this party that's helping the poor.
[37:45.520 --> 37:49.520]  If food costs go up 300%, you're not hurting the wealthy people.
[37:49.520 --> 37:52.520]  The wealthy people can afford 300% more for food.
[37:52.520 --> 37:56.520]  The people that you're hurting are the people that are just getting by.
[37:56.520 --> 38:05.520]  The very people that the left has duped into thinking that they are for those people.
[38:05.520 --> 38:11.520]  It's the same thing as the ridiculous minimum wage tactic that they use.
[38:11.520 --> 38:17.520]  It only hurts the very people at the bottom.
[38:17.520 --> 38:25.520]  The reason I take this stand, and I was also with Mike Lindell on Friday out there in Minnesota,
[38:25.520 --> 38:30.520]  what an amazing job he's doing to spend so much of his own money to get the truth out.
[38:30.520 --> 38:33.520]  I got a lot of respect for him.
[38:33.520 --> 38:37.520]  The reason I bring that up, I was jumping into like real capitalism.
[38:37.520 --> 38:43.520]  It's the most amazing thing that's brought people out of poverty.
[38:43.520 --> 38:46.520]  And that's what's under attack for this great reset.
[38:46.520 --> 38:48.520]  You mentioned it, Alvi.
[38:48.520 --> 38:52.520]  Look, O'Biden, that's what I call him, or O'Harris administration,
[38:52.520 --> 38:56.520]  shut down the Keystone pipeline right when it was finished.
[38:56.520 --> 38:59.520]  It was going to supply a third of the fuel we need to expand.
[38:59.520 --> 39:02.520]  It was going to supply the East Coast. It was already having problems.
[39:02.520 --> 39:04.520]  That shut down. So, Biden did that.
[39:04.520 --> 39:09.520]  Well, if you look at suspects, the guy that already shut down the pipeline that supplies the colonial pipeline,
[39:09.520 --> 39:14.520]  he's the main suspect, some shadowy hacker group who believes any of this.
[39:14.520 --> 39:20.520]  Texas wrote a letter three days before the power outage here this winter and said,
[39:20.520 --> 39:23.520]  you won't let us up our gas power or our coal power.
[39:23.520 --> 39:27.520]  We haven't got authorization. If we don't, there's a million dollar a day fines per facility,
[39:27.520 --> 39:29.520]  and we don't tell you we can be arrested,
[39:29.520 --> 39:32.520]  and the feds wouldn't give them the authorization until the power outage happened.
[39:32.520 --> 39:35.520]  So, I watched him turn the power off. That's a fact.
[39:35.520 --> 39:42.520]  And so, I think Biden, people behind him are the main suspects in the Great Reset shutting down the colonial pipeline.
[39:42.520 --> 39:45.520]  Absolutely. They're all on the same team.
[39:45.520 --> 39:53.520]  I mean, these globalists, whatever you're going to call them, the CCP, they're all working in concert with,
[39:53.520 --> 40:00.520]  you know, we used to call it the deep state before we really found out who was backing all of what is the deep state of all the money pouring in.
[40:00.520 --> 40:08.520]  So, we know that the Biden White House agenda is lockstep with every single thing that these globalists want to do to ruin our country,
[40:08.520 --> 40:11.520]  to have their takeover. We're the last beacon.
[40:11.520 --> 40:21.520]  And I do feel, with all this doom that we see, I do feel very confident that we're going to get the country back this time.
[40:21.520 --> 40:26.520]  It's not going to be easy. It's not going to be as fast as everybody wants, but our American spirit is still there.
[40:26.520 --> 40:34.520]  I feel firmly that there was 80 million people that voted for Trump and somewhere in the 61 million that voted for Biden.
[40:34.520 --> 40:37.520]  And the majority of Americans, even in the national polls, do not agree.
[40:37.520 --> 40:43.520]  70% of Republicans, 34% of Democrats in the numbers higher, know it was a fraud. Stay there. Let's talk about solutions.
[40:43.520 --> 40:49.520]  I agree with you. How do we take these lemons, turn them into lemonade with Alfie Oaks on the other side?
[40:49.520 --> 40:57.520]  A true American success story. Started his own company 37 years ago now. All the main food suppliers all over the country.
[40:57.520 --> 41:01.520]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[41:01.520 --> 41:02.520]  Hello. Can you hear me?
[41:02.520 --> 41:03.520]  I sure can, sir. Thank you.
[41:03.520 --> 41:10.520]  Hey, Alex. Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[41:10.520 --> 41:11.520]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[41:11.520 --> 41:19.520]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver and Tuber Force have changed the way I drive.
[41:19.520 --> 41:26.520]  Me and my brothers have drive. There's a couple of us. We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[41:26.520 --> 41:33.520]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rola, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar.
[41:33.520 --> 41:35.520]  And I just want to thank you for that, man.
[41:35.520 --> 41:41.520]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[41:41.520 --> 41:43.520]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[41:43.520 --> 41:48.520]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[41:48.520 --> 41:54.520]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better.

[42:57.520 --> 43:12.520]  I'm driving home at 7 o'clock at night on Monday night to see my family, and I just remember there's only two days left for our wonderful listeners to get incredibly high-quality, storeable food at the lowest price they're going to find anywhere at preparewithalix.com.
[43:12.520 --> 43:20.520]  These are 20-20 prices for a limited time for our listeners, and then the price isn't just going to go back to regular. It's going to have to go up.
[43:20.520 --> 43:24.520]  Everybody else has already raised prices way more than my Patreon.
[43:24.520 --> 43:30.520]  We have their entire spectrum and catalog at infowarstore.com, preparewithalix.com.
[43:30.520 --> 43:37.520]  You get an additional 10% off on three months, six months, your supplies, and everything else on the site.
[43:37.520 --> 43:44.520]  Preparewithalix.com. I would take advantage of this with what's happening in food price increases around the world.
[43:44.520 --> 43:50.520]  I predict that by the fall you're going to see major shortages and you're going to see huge price increases.
[43:50.520 --> 43:58.520]  I think it's a smart bet right now to get high-quality, storeable food at last year's prices while you still can at preparewithalix.com.
[43:58.520 --> 44:10.520]  Bio-remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.

[45:34.520 --> 45:42.520]  Alfie Oaks is our guest for one more segment. He owns a large farm distribution system that supplies the country and Canada,
[45:42.520 --> 45:46.520]  and also some top of the line grocery stores in Florida.
[45:46.520 --> 45:48.520]  And you can find his Facebook.
[45:48.520 --> 45:52.520]  You know, just Google Alfie Oaks. He does a lot of great work out there.
[45:52.520 --> 45:56.520]  People say, why are you plugging Facebook? Hey, if you can stay on Facebook and get the truth out, do it.
[45:56.520 --> 46:02.520]  Take our information posted on Facebook or oakfarms.com. He is here with us right now.
[46:02.520 --> 46:07.520]  And I don't want to just get up here because I hear that from you, you're being positive and just be negative.
[46:07.520 --> 46:12.520]  I just want folks to know it's very positive to admit we're under attack, not because we're victims,
[46:12.520 --> 46:15.520]  but because we're going to recognize it. We're going to stand up to it.
[46:15.520 --> 46:18.520]  We're going to say, no, the globalists have made investment in China.
[46:18.520 --> 46:21.520]  They want America to collapse and to consolidate it and to break our will.
[46:21.520 --> 46:25.520]  That's their own admissions. And that's what Biden wants. He's breaking our borders.
[46:25.520 --> 46:29.520]  He's telling us our country sucks. He's laughing about the unemployment.
[46:29.520 --> 46:34.520]  He knows the average person doesn't have a bunch of employees like I do or Alfie does at a greater level.
[46:34.520 --> 46:40.520]  If you've got to pay somebody $15 an hour, you've got to match them with their FICA and Social Security and all that crap.
[46:40.520 --> 46:44.520]  So now that's $22, $23 you're paying somebody. Then you've got to get them insurance.
[46:44.520 --> 46:49.520]  It's basically $30 an hour and now you can't hire new people and spend the time training them.
[46:49.520 --> 46:53.520]  People don't understand getting hired to a business is they're putting an investment and believing in you.
[46:53.520 --> 46:57.520]  And in most countries and the way this country used to work is you'd work for six months a year,
[46:57.520 --> 47:02.520]  maybe five years for free, become an apprentice because you're learning skills.
[47:02.520 --> 47:06.520]  So what we have in this country is paid apprenticeship at minimum wage.
[47:06.520 --> 47:09.520]  They've just gotten rid of that. So now companies are okay.
[47:09.520 --> 47:15.520]  We'll only take skilled workers, which again keeps a lot of people out of the market and then makes the price of the skilled go up.
[47:15.520 --> 47:20.520]  Is that a good way as a business owner that's had thousands of employees to say it, Alfie?
[47:20.520 --> 47:26.520]  Well, there's nothing that I'm more proud of than I started with nothing because it gives you a great sense
[47:26.520 --> 47:29.520]  of integrity and accomplishment.
[47:29.520 --> 47:35.520]  And unfortunately, what I found throughout my whole life is that when, no matter who it is, if you get money that you didn't earn,
[47:35.520 --> 47:40.520]  whether it's from a trust fund, whether you've been, you know, blessed enough to be born,
[47:40.520 --> 47:45.520]  or maybe I wouldn't say blessed at this point to be born in India and it gets a bunch of casino royalties,
[47:45.520 --> 47:51.520]  or you just believe the welfare system or like many people are doing right now where they're, you know,
[47:51.520 --> 47:56.520]  they're on this, on this government team from this COVID relief, even though they're very able to get a job and there's
[47:56.520 --> 47:58.520]  help wanted signs everywhere.
[47:58.520 --> 48:05.520]  We know, and I'm not saying that every person that's a trust fund or that gets a casino cut or alternative,
[48:05.520 --> 48:09.520]  I'm not saying that everyone were bad people, but I'm telling you, it makes it much, much harder.
[48:09.520 --> 48:13.520]  All the Roman emperors that chose their sons, the sons were losers.
[48:13.520 --> 48:18.520]  And Rome fell because they started choosing their sons to be the emperor instead of choosing the best man.
[48:18.520 --> 48:22.520]  And so, yes, what you're saying is people being dependent on average destroys them.
[48:22.520 --> 48:24.520]  It's the worst thing you can do to somebody.
[48:24.520 --> 48:29.520]  It's the worst thing that you can do to their, to psychologically, it's the worst thing that you can do to a person.
[48:29.520 --> 48:33.520]  And that's what they're after right now.
[48:33.520 --> 48:35.520]  They're trying to ruin our culture.
[48:35.520 --> 48:39.520]  It's been, they're trying to make everyone dependent on the government.
[48:39.520 --> 48:44.520]  And then after the business, all the small businesses that are destroyed, once they're destroyed,
[48:44.520 --> 48:48.520]  then they can cut them off of the government teeth and then everyone's, everyone's screwed.
[48:48.520 --> 48:55.520]  So there's so many people that are sitting at home making a few more bucks or maybe even a lot more money than what they would if they're working.
[48:55.520 --> 48:59.520]  But meanwhile, their small businesses are bleeding and going to be going out of business.
[48:59.520 --> 49:01.520]  And where's it going to get them in the long run?
[49:01.520 --> 49:05.520]  And this is what we're lacking right now in this country is we're lacking throughout the masses.
[49:05.520 --> 49:11.520]  We're lacking integrity for people to pull yourself up by the bootstraps and get the work.
[49:11.520 --> 49:18.520]  I don't care if you can, if you can do better sitting at home, go to work, do something productive, be a productive member of society.
[49:18.520 --> 49:19.520]  And, and that's, I agree.
[49:19.520 --> 49:23.520]  What did you make of Biden and Socky as Press Secretary saying it's preposterous.
[49:23.520 --> 49:25.520]  No one is staying home because of these benefits.
[49:25.520 --> 49:26.520]  They've done surveys.
[49:26.520 --> 49:30.520]  People are staying home because they can make more of the benefits than working at an entry level job.
[49:30.520 --> 49:32.520]  It's preposterous to say otherwise.
[49:32.520 --> 49:34.520]  The facts are the facts.
[49:34.520 --> 49:39.520]  We were watching more money go out for unemployment than ever in history.
[49:39.520 --> 49:45.520]  And meanwhile, there's helpful audit signs everywhere that people won't come in and get to pay $21 an hour.
[49:45.520 --> 49:50.520]  And I'm not lecturing, you know, I'm lecturing people that maybe new listeners in the audience, maybe millennials, generations here, whatever.
[49:50.520 --> 49:52.520]  Some of us haven't had jobs.
[49:52.520 --> 49:54.520]  And I know a lot of you have.
[49:54.520 --> 50:00.520]  You need to understand you're not just going to win now getting to sit at home for a couple of years and watch Netflix and drink beer or play video games.
[50:00.520 --> 50:02.520]  Already there's more people not working.
[50:02.520 --> 50:06.520]  That means less productivity with more dollars chasing less.
[50:06.520 --> 50:10.520]  That's going to cause inflation and scarcity, which is already here.
[50:10.520 --> 50:12.520]  So we're already getting screwed by this.
[50:12.520 --> 50:14.520]  There's no free lunch.
[50:14.520 --> 50:16.520]  There's no, there's no, there's no free lunch.
[50:16.520 --> 50:18.520]  And at the end of the day, you have to answer yourself.
[50:18.520 --> 50:21.520]  You might think you're getting over on the man, but you're not.
[50:21.520 --> 50:24.520]  You've got to, we've got to go and be productive members of society.
[50:24.520 --> 50:25.520]  This is insanity.
[50:25.520 --> 50:27.520]  What we're seeing right here.
[50:27.520 --> 50:31.520]  I want to jump back just on the one other thing that a lot of people may not have thought about.
[50:31.520 --> 50:33.520]  These companies like Massana.
[50:33.520 --> 50:36.520]  Monsanto in particular owned by Bayer.
[50:36.520 --> 50:37.520]  Think about this.
[50:37.520 --> 50:39.520]  And this scheme has been going on for a long time.
[50:39.520 --> 50:43.520]  And you used to be maybe thought of as a conspiracy theory, but we're watching it play out.
[50:43.520 --> 50:48.520]  We disrupted like putting real fertilizer in the ground, like real organic fertilizer.
[50:48.520 --> 50:53.520]  And they're putting this chemical MPK that Bayer will sell these farmers.
[50:53.520 --> 50:55.520]  Universities are telling them it's okay to use.
[50:55.520 --> 50:59.520]  Then because it's not nutrient rich, it grows an inferior product.
[50:59.520 --> 51:02.520]  And most of it's, you know, GMO stuff.
[51:02.520 --> 51:04.520]  So then that product grows.
[51:04.520 --> 51:05.520]  We put it in our bodies.
[51:05.520 --> 51:07.520]  Our bodies are starving to death.
[51:07.520 --> 51:09.520]  We fill up our guts with stuff, but we're not.
[51:09.520 --> 51:13.520]  We're starving because the food that we're eating is not nutrient rich.
[51:13.520 --> 51:14.520]  And then guess what?
[51:14.520 --> 51:15.520]  We get ill.
[51:15.520 --> 51:22.520]  And guess what company is selling you the pharmaceutical drugs that supposedly make you better.
[51:22.520 --> 51:23.520]  It's Bayer.
[51:23.520 --> 51:24.520]  It's the same company.
[51:24.520 --> 51:26.520]  So it's a vicious cycle.
[51:26.520 --> 51:29.520]  And it's really, I don't know if they were that genius to create it.
[51:29.520 --> 51:32.520]  Or if they've just been business, let it go along the way.
[51:32.520 --> 51:37.520]  But, but this, we actually have documents where they give us the illnesses to then give us the treatments.
[51:37.520 --> 51:38.520]  Exactly.
[51:38.520 --> 51:40.520]  It's, it's, it's a hundred percent what's happening.
[51:40.520 --> 51:45.520]  There's, there's, and this is, this is why, and I'm not saying it because I have local farms
[51:45.520 --> 51:49.520]  and we grow the stuff the right way, but go out there and support your local farms.
[51:49.520 --> 51:53.520]  There's also other studies that say you can eat product that was picked within 24 hours
[51:53.520 --> 51:55.520]  rather than getting something that's months old.
[51:55.520 --> 51:59.520]  And the, you know, that might, might be from, from in a controlled atmosphere.
[51:59.520 --> 52:00.520]  Cool.
[52:00.520 --> 52:01.520]  There's huge, huge health benefits to that.
[52:01.520 --> 52:04.520]  And that's the way that nature intended for us to eat that.
[52:04.520 --> 52:05.520]  So right now.
[52:05.520 --> 52:10.520]  Well, I gotta say, I've been in two of your stores and the food is glowing with life.
[52:10.520 --> 52:13.520]  I mean, it looks, it looks like beyond fake fruit.
[52:13.520 --> 52:17.520]  It looks like, like, like if you were in heaven, what the fruit would look like.
[52:17.520 --> 52:19.520]  I mean, how the hell are you doing that?
[52:19.520 --> 52:23.520]  Well, we, we grow, we grow it with real nutrient rich fertilizer.
[52:23.520 --> 52:28.520]  We have, we put compost, mulch and, and chicken, composted chicken manure that's,
[52:28.520 --> 52:31.520]  that's been pasteurized and it has all the nutrients in it.
[52:31.520 --> 52:32.520]  I drink these doctor here.
[52:32.520 --> 52:35.520]  This is a drink with beet and carrot and ginger and celery.
[52:35.520 --> 52:37.520]  I bring several of them a day.
[52:37.520 --> 52:42.520]  And because I've been able to eat this product that is picked that same day.
[52:42.520 --> 52:44.520]  I've, for, for 40 years, I've never had a cold.
[52:44.520 --> 52:45.520]  I've never had the flu.
[52:45.520 --> 52:48.520]  I've never would never ever consider taking a flu shot.
[52:48.520 --> 52:51.520]  I've never taken any prescription medicine at all.
[52:51.520 --> 52:55.520]  And it's because of what you put in your body and, and people need to wake up
[52:55.520 --> 52:59.520]  because this pandemic has caused more people to hit these fast food joints that are,
[52:59.520 --> 53:02.520]  that have, you know, the bread is made out of poison.
[53:02.520 --> 53:03.520]  Who knows what's in the meat.
[53:03.520 --> 53:06.520]  The meat sometimes might be from 17 different countries.
[53:06.520 --> 53:07.520]  I want to have you back on some time.
[53:07.520 --> 53:10.520]  I was talking to a lot of medical doctors and experts about what you were saying
[53:10.520 --> 53:13.520]  is I didn't even really know about that, that they've changed the way the wheat's grown.
[53:13.520 --> 53:17.520]  They've changed the genetics of it and what they grow it in.
[53:17.520 --> 53:18.520]  And so it's not even really wheat.
[53:18.520 --> 53:21.520]  And that's why people are getting the gluten intolerance,
[53:21.520 --> 53:24.520]  but that other types of old fashioned wheat don't do that.
[53:24.520 --> 53:25.520]  A hundred percent.
[53:25.520 --> 53:28.520]  I have, I have wheat that comes from Central Milling in Utah that we sell here
[53:28.520 --> 53:30.520]  costs like three times as much a bag.
[53:30.520 --> 53:33.520]  And that's what we make everything in the store out of.
[53:33.520 --> 53:34.520]  And guess what?
[53:34.520 --> 53:37.520]  Everyone that thinks they have gluten intolerance comes in here and can eat the wheat.
[53:37.520 --> 53:40.520]  And, and then, you know, we were hearing this from years ago, people go to Europe
[53:40.520 --> 53:43.520]  and they can eat the wheat and they're not bothered.
[53:43.520 --> 53:45.520]  Well, this, the problem is not the wheat.
[53:45.520 --> 53:46.520]  It's not the gluten.
[53:46.520 --> 53:49.520]  And the reason our great grandparents weren't gluten intolerant
[53:49.520 --> 53:51.520]  is because they weren't eating this frankenwheat.
[53:51.520 --> 53:55.520]  This, this new, this, this wheat that there's in 98% of the stuff that we're eating,
[53:55.520 --> 53:59.520]  the DNA strain on it is 20 times bigger than our own human DNA.
[53:59.520 --> 54:00.520]  It's, it's, it's toxic.
[54:00.520 --> 54:02.520]  And, and that's the problem.
[54:02.520 --> 54:04.520]  And, and, and they know what they're doing.
[54:04.520 --> 54:09.520]  These, these companies that are making this, this frankenwheat, they know exactly what they're doing.
[54:09.520 --> 54:10.520]  Well, you know, they fed it to lab rats.
[54:10.520 --> 54:12.520]  Same thing with the genetically modified soybeans.
[54:12.520 --> 54:14.520]  It literally sterilizes them.
[54:14.520 --> 54:19.520]  That's why Gates is buying up all the farmland so he can displace all the real farmers and kill us with his crap.
[54:19.520 --> 54:20.520]  It's incredible.
[54:20.520 --> 54:22.520]  Alf, we got a minute and a half left.
[54:22.520 --> 54:24.520]  You have a lot of positive views towards the future.
[54:24.520 --> 54:25.520]  So do I.
[54:25.520 --> 54:27.520]  We're seeing a giant awakening as bad as things are.
[54:27.520 --> 54:32.520]  What else can people do to stay positive and, you know, be the change they want to see in the world?
[54:32.520 --> 54:37.520]  I always tell everyone like we have, we have to, we have to, right now we have our dollars.
[54:37.520 --> 54:42.520]  So right now we have our dollars and we have to support the companies that are doing the right thing.
[54:42.520 --> 54:45.520]  I threw, I threw Coca-Cola out of the store here.
[54:45.520 --> 54:49.520]  I asked my people to stop buying from out in the mockery.
[54:49.520 --> 54:50.520]  They're buying a lot from Amazon.
[54:50.520 --> 55:06.520]  I'm like, even if we got to drive a little bit farther to support a small business, I went and bought a vacuum cleaner the other day from a little vacuum cleaner shop that, you know, instead of going to a, to a Walmart or, you know, those little things make a huge difference.
[55:06.520 --> 55:07.520]  That's right.
[55:07.520 --> 55:10.520]  They're waging war on small businesses and independent local business.
[55:10.520 --> 55:12.520]  We've got to prop up the small businesses.
[55:12.520 --> 55:14.520]  This is an economic war.
[55:14.520 --> 55:15.520]  It is.
[55:15.520 --> 55:16.520]  And then that's what we got.
[55:16.520 --> 55:18.520]  And we got to get, get behind.
[55:18.520 --> 55:23.520]  I talked to a group of 400 women the other night and I, and there are a lot of wealthy people in Naples.
[55:23.520 --> 55:34.520]  I'm like, I know you probably have some hair and hair in this left for your children or your grandchildren, but you better put some money behind some of these really strong candidates this election or the money that you leave them is not going to be worth anything anyway.
[55:34.520 --> 55:37.520]  So I hope people are paying attention and invest wisely.
[55:37.520 --> 55:40.520]  Beautifully said, Alfie Oaks, a great American success story.
[55:40.520 --> 55:41.520]  Come back soon.
[55:41.520 --> 55:42.520]  We love you, brother.
[55:42.520 --> 55:43.520]  Thank you so much.
[55:43.520 --> 55:44.520]  All right.
[55:44.520 --> 55:46.520]  Ted Nugent coming up.
[55:46.520 --> 55:48.520]  Again, I don't like to lecture people.
[55:48.520 --> 55:55.520]  I'm a very private person, but because of the globalist and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure.
[55:55.520 --> 55:59.520]  And we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[55:59.520 --> 56:03.520]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me a break.
[56:03.520 --> 56:10.520]  The Satanism's out in the open, I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[56:10.520 --> 56:11.520]  And I get it.
[56:11.520 --> 56:13.520]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[56:13.520 --> 56:19.520]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system, and I get it, me too, believe me, I'm one of them.
[56:19.520 --> 56:26.520]  But it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential.
[56:26.520 --> 56:31.520]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life.
[56:31.520 --> 56:33.520]  And so that's what Info Wars is really all about.
[56:33.520 --> 56:35.520]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[56:35.520 --> 56:41.520]  Thank you for spreading the word about Info Wars, and thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting infowarstore.com.
[56:41.520 --> 56:44.520]  Because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases, we'll be taking off the air.
[56:44.520 --> 56:48.520]  So thank you for the support, infowarstore.com.
[56:48.520 --> 56:54.520]  When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say thank you for what you've done.
[56:54.520 --> 56:56.520]  Thank you for keeping Info Wars on the air.
[56:56.520 --> 57:00.520]  Thank you for praying for us, and thank you for spreading the word.
[57:00.520 --> 57:10.520]  If all of you will simply go to infowarstore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[57:10.520 --> 57:16.520]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[57:16.520 --> 57:22.520]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil.
[57:22.520 --> 57:29.520]  And in the surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[57:29.520 --> 57:31.520]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.
[57:31.520 --> 57:36.520]  They're available at infowarstore.com in four different colors, and they are only $19.95.
[57:36.520 --> 57:40.520]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95, or even $29.95 everywhere.
[57:40.520 --> 57:43.520]  They're available right now for $19.95, and they fund the Info War.
[57:43.520 --> 58:09.520]  Please take action today, protect your privacy, and fund the Info War.
[58:09.520 --> 58:16.520]  You know, everybody mentions their words, people back down from the truth, and that's why we've gotten in this position with these corrupt tyrants running our lives.
[58:16.520 --> 58:27.520]  And so I was deadly serious when I said when they're convicted for releasing this bio weapon on purpose and running the Wuhan lab, that's Bill Gates and Fauci and the rest of them.
[58:27.520 --> 58:29.520]  I mean, I think that they should face the death penalty.
[58:29.520 --> 58:34.520]  I don't want anybody to attack Gates or attack Fauci. I don't want anybody to go to their house, any of that stuff.
[58:34.520 --> 58:38.520]  I'm saying I want them arrested. I want them indicted. I want them tried.
[58:38.520 --> 58:46.520]  I can show this evidence. I'm going to show you at the bottom of the hour, pretend Nugent joins us and leaves us a smoking gun and admitting they did the whole thing.
[58:46.520 --> 58:48.520]  And it's all coming out.
[58:48.520 --> 58:57.520]  And so we've got to not just push them to have all their policies reversed and to show it's a premeditated power grab, they've got to face prison time.
[58:57.520 --> 59:00.520]  They're trying to put us all in prison for loving liberty.
[59:00.520 --> 59:08.520]  Coming up, Australia joins military drills with France, Japan, U.S. extensions with China Intensify. And it's all coming out.
[59:08.520 --> 59:11.520]  Tucker Carlson is calling for criminal investigations of Fauci and others.
[59:11.520 --> 59:16.520]  So the truth is coming out, ladies and gentlemen, and that's all coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[59:16.520 --> 59:19.520]  Ted Nugent, I want to get him on and talk about a host of issues with the open borders.
[59:19.520 --> 59:21.520]  The gun grab, the globalist, what's happening with China.
[59:21.520 --> 59:24.520]  He got COVID as well, but took ivermectin. That's coming up.
[59:24.520 --> 59:29.520]  But here's Greg Reese's latest report, evidence of self-spreading vaccines being used for depopulation.
[59:29.520 --> 59:34.520]  The official death numbers from 2020 are out for the United States.
[59:34.520 --> 59:41.520]  And only 5% of those labeled as COVID deaths actually died from COVID.
[59:41.520 --> 59:48.520]  Less than 19,000 people in the U.S. died from COVID-19 in 2020.
[59:48.520 --> 59:53.520]  Far less than those who die each year from the flu or cold.
[59:53.520 --> 1:00:00.520]  Another bald-faced, big farm of fraud admitted to in their own fine print.
[1:00:00.520 --> 1:00:11.520]  They've gotten away with falsifying the numbers before to fake a swine flu pandemic and it influenza scare.
[1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:20.520]  Both to sell billions of dollars worth of needless, dangerous vaccines to a dumbed-down, brainwashed public.
[1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:28.520]  Is it about eugenics? Yes. Eugenics 101 is to kill off the sick and elderly.
[1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:34.520]  Is it about money? Of course. In the U.S. alone, based on two shots per person,
[1:00:34.520 --> 1:00:42.520]  the vaccine manufacturers are making over $13 billion a year, paid for by taxpayer dollars.
[1:00:42.520 --> 1:00:50.520]  The manufacturers have no liability. They cannot be held accountable for any deaths or injury.
[1:00:50.520 --> 1:00:58.520]  They will only profit more by selling drugs to everyone that they've injured with their experimental vaccines.
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:05.520]  Is it a big experiment? Absolutely. And there is no shortage of suckers and fools.
[1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:12.520]  Millions are willingly lining up for the mystery injection, proudly boasting their compliance and ignorance
[1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:19.520]  for all the world to see on social media. But is it all voluntary?
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:27.520]  In recent years, Big Pharma has been pushing for vaccines to self-spread to non-vaccinated individuals.
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:34.520]  They claim to already have this technology and have discussed using it on the public covertly.
[1:01:34.520 --> 1:01:44.520]  One application considered was an anti-fertility vaccine that could be administered to human women without their knowledge.
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:51.520]  A recent Pfizer study describes the potential for their COVID vaccine to cause adverse effects in pregnant women
[1:01:51.520 --> 1:01:57.520]  who come into close contact with recently vaccinated individuals.
[1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:04.520]  And we have seen thousands of women reporting abnormal menstrual cycles, miscarriages and blood clots
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:10.520]  after coming into contact with the vaccinated.
[1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:19.520]  Former chief science officer for Pfizer said that he thinks vaccines will be used for mass depopulation.
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:25.520]  If this is being done to us deliberately, obviously we wouldn't be told.
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:29.520]  Bill Gates doesn't think you deserve to know what's in the vaccine.
[1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:33.520]  There's been some speculation that the changing intellectual property rules
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:41.520]  and allowing these vaccines, as you say, the recipe for these vaccines to be shared would be helpful.
[1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:43.520]  And do you think that would be helpful?
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:44.520]  No.
[1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:49.520]  And the inserts are dubiously left blank on purpose.
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:52.520]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:56.520]  All right, Ted Nugent in 60 Seconds.
[1:02:56.520 --> 1:03:00.520]  I'm driving home at 7 o'clock at night on Monday night to see my family.
[1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:06.520]  And I just remember there's only two days left for our wonderful listeners to get incredibly high quality,
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:10.520]  storeable food at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere at preparewithalux.com.
[1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:15.520]  These are 20, 20 prices for a limited time for our listeners.
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:18.520]  And then the price isn't just going to go back to regular, it's going to have to go up.
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:22.520]  Everybody else has already raised prices way more than my Patreon.
[1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:28.520]  We have their entire Spectrum and Catalog at infowarsstore.com, preparewithalux.com.
[1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:35.520]  You get an additional 10% off on three months, six months, your supplies, and everything else on the site.
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:37.520]  Preparewithalux.com.
[1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:42.520]  I would take advantage of this with what's happening in food price increases around the world.
[1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:47.520]  I predict that by the fall you're going to see major shortages and you're going to see huge price increases.
[1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:52.520]  I think it's a smart bet right now to get high quality, storeable food at last year's prices
[1:03:52.520 --> 1:04:18.520]  while you still can at preparewithalux.com.
[1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:32.520]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:34.520]  And we've got Ted Nugent on with us.
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:38.520]  A few weeks ago we heard that he got in COVID, which is a very real thing, a very serious kind of function.
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:42.520]  Pneumonia cold that can also attack the brain and other parts of the body.
[1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:44.520]  We now know it was a weapon made in China.
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:46.520]  As we told you a year ago, that's now coming out.
[1:04:46.520 --> 1:04:48.520]  We have the documents when Ted Nugent leaves us.
[1:04:48.520 --> 1:04:50.520]  We'll cover that at the bottom of the hour.
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:55.520]  I wanted to get him on because he was really sick, took ivermectin and had a great testimony.
[1:04:55.520 --> 1:04:56.520]  And that saves lives.
[1:04:56.520 --> 1:04:58.520]  They've tried to suppress ivermectin.
[1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:02.520]  They've tried to suppress hydroxychloroquine because if you have a treatment that's already there,
[1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:08.520]  well then you can't have emergency authorization for these GMO Franken shots.
[1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:13.520]  But now there was a court order in Chicago where a woman was on a ventilator dying.
[1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:14.520]  Her daughter got a court order.
[1:05:14.520 --> 1:05:15.520]  They put on ivermectin.
[1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:17.520]  She's now better out of the hospital.
[1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:20.520]  So now out of the coma, that was last week.
[1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:22.520]  Now she's out of the hospital last time I heard.
[1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:24.520]  So joining us to save lives.
[1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:26.520]  There's so many ways promoting the Second Amendment.
[1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:32.520]  And also self-sufficiency with hunting is Ted Nugent who needs no introduction.
[1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:34.520]  Sir, thanks for coming on again.
[1:05:34.520 --> 1:05:35.520]  My pleasure, Alex.
[1:05:35.520 --> 1:05:40.520]  A very happy springtime across the heartland out there and to you.
[1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:41.520]  And you nailed it.
[1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:43.520]  I would just like to say ditto, ditto, ditto.
[1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:50.520]  But what I want to bring is just a glowing, inescapable, irrefutable tsunami of evidence
[1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:55.520]  that the most important responsibility of an American is to remain suspicious
[1:05:55.520 --> 1:06:01.520]  and to constantly ask questions and never back down to get answers that have evidence,
[1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:06.520]  that have information that you can believe because of scientific research,
[1:06:06.520 --> 1:06:08.520]  just boots on the ground research.
[1:06:08.520 --> 1:06:13.520]  But let me tell you, I'm a happy, happy, dangerously healthy young man.
[1:06:13.520 --> 1:06:14.520]  I don't know about how young I am.
[1:06:14.520 --> 1:06:15.520]  I'm 72 now.
[1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:17.520]  But I got the Chinese virus.
[1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:21.520]  And let's make the most important point possible that you do all the time, Alex.
[1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:28.520]  And we, the people out here in the asset column of America, we salute you and thank you,
[1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:33.520]  as I always mention, for always asking the hard questions and spotlighting the cockroaches,
[1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:35.520]  which are just everywhere now.
[1:06:35.520 --> 1:06:40.520]  In 2019, I did hundreds and hundreds of interviews.
[1:06:40.520 --> 1:06:41.520]  I write for different publications.
[1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:43.520]  I do podcasts all the time.
[1:06:43.520 --> 1:06:45.520]  I'm doing Facebook live.
[1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:50.520]  I admitted, obviously, that there was a Wuhan virus.
[1:06:50.520 --> 1:06:53.520]  That's what they called it because that's where it started, just like the German measles
[1:06:53.520 --> 1:06:55.520]  and the Spanish flu and the West Nile virus.
[1:06:55.520 --> 1:07:00.520]  There's a geographical reference, historically, to medical considerations.
[1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:03.520]  I'm just a guitar player, but I figured that out.
[1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:08.520]  I admitted hundreds, if not thousands of times, based on my scientific buddies,
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:14.520]  my epidemiologist buddies, my doctor buddies, the white papers from the frontline doctors.
[1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:20.520]  And that there was a Wuhan virus, a Chinese virus that they started calling a COVID-19
[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:23.520]  because our government wants to cover for the Communist Chinese Party.
[1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:25.520]  The evidence is irrefutable.
[1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:33.520]  That my sickness, along with billions of people around the world that got the Chinese virus,
[1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:38.520]  that Ted Nugent, getting the Chinese virus and getting very, very sick,
[1:07:38.520 --> 1:07:45.520]  was actually a trending global story claiming that I called it a hoax.
[1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:46.520]  Now, Alex, I'm verbose.
[1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:47.520]  I have a loud mouth.
[1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:48.520]  Oh, I know.
[1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:49.520]  I follow you.
[1:07:49.520 --> 1:07:50.520]  You've been on the show.
[1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:51.520]  You've called it Chinese virus.
[1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:52.520]  You never said it wasn't real.
[1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:56.520]  So they used that to defame you claiming that you were a fraud,
[1:07:56.520 --> 1:07:58.520]  but now admitted you were a fraud and that you were wrong.
[1:07:58.520 --> 1:07:59.520]  Total hoax.
[1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:00.520]  I mean, it wasn't just global trending.
[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:03.520]  It was the number one story in the world for about a day and a half.
[1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:07.520]  And let's identify what that story was.
[1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:12.520]  The Satanists, and they used to be Democrats, and I guess they morphed into Marxists
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:19.520]  and Communists and Black Lives Matter and Antifa and the MS-13 devil gangs.
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:26.520]  They literally celebrated the suffering of their fellow man.
[1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:30.520]  But meanwhile, now make sure that doesn't escape us.
[1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:35.520]  The global media community driven by the ultra-leftist...
[1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:38.520]  I remember they said, I hope Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson die next.
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:40.520]  That was trending as well.
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:46.520]  It literally global media celebrated the suffering of a fellow man.
[1:08:46.520 --> 1:08:50.520]  That's ugly and that's demonic and it's pure evil.
[1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:56.520]  But Alex, millions, if not tens of millions of people from around the world,
[1:08:56.520 --> 1:08:59.520]  they come on my Facebook, I get the email, we get bombarded.
[1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:06.520]  The love, the caring, the empathy, the compassion, the support,
[1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:10.520]  the positive spirit and goodwill and decency.
[1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:13.520]  Alex, I'm telling you, it was immeasurable.
[1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:18.520]  People prayed for me. I went to the frontline doctors, the great doctor Simone Gold and her team.
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:22.520]  I got immediately on the hydroxychloroquine, the ivermectin, the steroids.
[1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:26.520]  I've always pounded basic vitamins, but I increased the vitamins.
[1:09:26.520 --> 1:09:33.520]  And within three or four days, I literally started feeding like that dangerous guitar player
[1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:36.520]  that stands up for truth, logic and common sense and all the good stuff in the world.
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:40.520]  So right now as I face you, Alex, I couldn't be healthier.
[1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:45.520]  I couldn't be more cocked, locked and ready to rock the clock around the cock, Mr. Spock.
[1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:48.520]  And I killed two black fuck with my bow and arrow.
[1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:59.520]  I'm literally toothpicking my teeth right now in an immeasurable joyous celebration of venison, conservation, resource stewardship.
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:03.520]  I trained with a bunch of heroes of the sheriff's department with our firearms yesterday.
[1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:11.520]  So I am on point. I have recovered because of the frontline doctors implementing the proven methodologies
[1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:17.520]  that Trump recommended that were banned by big tech and our government.
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:19.520]  Really try to grasp that.
[1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:23.520]  And here's the very part. I want to tell you why I want you on. You're a great guy. You come on.
[1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:30.520]  We're so sympatico. I wanted you on to talk about the fact they tried to suppress what worked for you and millions of other people
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:35.520]  and how that's another crime they're committing with big tech and big pharma, wanting us to only have these vaccines,
[1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:37.520]  which they now admit aren't even protecting people.
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:41.520]  In fact, the majority of people not going to the hospital with COVID were already vaccinated.
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:44.520]  This is insane. This is a crime.
[1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:51.520]  Yeah, I've heard from literally hundreds of my buddies out there, hunting buddies, law enforcement, military, the ranchers down the road.
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:56.520]  Band members, not my band members. They've somehow avoided it. They're young and healthy.
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:11:02.520]  They take good care of themselves, clean and sober. They're strong, fortified individuals.
[1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:06.520]  But some of my other musician friends from around the country got hit real hard.
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:08.520]  Now, you never heard those stories.
[1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:17.520]  And no devils wrote journalistic hate hoping that my friends and other bands die from the Chinese virus,
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:23.520]  but they did that about me. And Alex, I know you love me. I feel the love I celebrate the love.
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:35.520]  But do you realize as bad of a mofo as I think I am, I couldn't possibly be as wonderful of a human being to deserve the hate from the Satanist
[1:11:35.520 --> 1:11:43.520]  that they've trended a global article celebrating my sickness and suffering is proof that they're scared to death of me.
[1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:54.520]  And it makes me so happy and so strong and good people celebrate that my good, my spirit irritates the demon.
[1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:59.520]  Your spotlight. It's like Jimi Hendrix said, stand next to your fire. You've got the fire of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:04.520]  It pisses them off. I agree. People ask me all the time, how do you handle being lied about and demonizing attack?
[1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:09.520]  And I go, that means the old World War II saying I'm over the target. That's what I expect.
[1:12:09.520 --> 1:12:23.520]  Well, I consider myself a Schindler and my list of Jews that I'm saving is growing so quickly and so voluminously that the brown shirts hate everything I stand for.
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:27.520]  Now, that's a metaphor that I think the Alex Jones viewers will understand.
[1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:36.520]  But some people will completely miss my point is that I have dedicated myself to being in the asset column to be productive,
[1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:40.520]  to be law abiding, to support God, family, country, law enforcement.
[1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:45.520]  The heroes of the military when they properly crush the evil forces like in World War II.
[1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:48.520]  And I don't think since with all due respect.
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:55.520]  So I study, I research, I'm just a guitar player, but here's the most important thing about an American.
[1:12:55.520 --> 1:13:01.520]  We give a damn. I give a damn. The people who prayed for me give a damn.
[1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:08.520]  Alex Jones that questions the abuse of authority and the demonic decrees from the Biden zombies.
[1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:15.520]  You are a warrior. You're in the asset column. That's why we are kindred souls because truth logic in common sense matters.
[1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:21.520]  And they want to take the economy and culture and church away from us and music and everything else because they want us to be dependent.
[1:13:21.520 --> 1:13:26.520]  When we come back, I want to talk about that Biden saying, oh, people aren't going back to work because the money we're giving them.
[1:13:26.520 --> 1:13:33.520]  But we know that's what they're doing. And now the pipelines are shutting down and they claim the Russians did it with no evidence.
[1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:38.520]  I want to see evidence because I know who shut down a pipeline just as big.
[1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:49.520]  And his name is Joe Biden from the third Obama administration, the main keystone to Houston that's refined and sent on the colonial pipeline.
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:56.520]  So only guy knows what's shutting down pipelines is Joe Biden.
[1:13:56.520 --> 1:14:01.520]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been Alex Jones was right.
[1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:10.520]  But it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[1:14:10.520 --> 1:14:13.520]  Well, let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today. And thanks for your support.
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:19.520]  We're still on air and at FullWars.com and Bandai Video radio stations and TV stations across the country.
[1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:25.520]  And our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years ago, is now available again.
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:29.520]  We have reprinted it on high quality DVD in HD. It has a zero country code.
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:35.520]  Anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it. And I'm asking you to get the original, make copies, give it to everyone you know.
[1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:44.520]  You can get the original, access TV, give it to your pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever you do, warn the world.
[1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:48.520]  This film uses their own documents and own statements 14 years ago to expose them.
[1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:55.520]  It's more important than ever available at infowarstore.com. That's infowarstore.com. Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:14:55.520 --> 1:15:04.520]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the shutdown of the East Coast gasoline pipeline.
[1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:10.520]  That goes from Houston right up through New York City. It supplies more than half of the gasoline to the East Coast.
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:19.520]  But who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline from Canada to the Midwest to Houston to refine the oil that's then turned into gas instead of the East Coast?
[1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:24.520]  That's right. Joe Biden shut down the Keystone pipeline right after it was completed.
[1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:29.520]  Joe Biden did that to America. He has the history. He has the background.
[1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:36.520]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels. He's the one that's tried to extend the lockdowns of the country.
[1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:46.520]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world and they want the United States, Europe and Australia crippled so Communist China can be dominant.
[1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:52.520]  It's not Russia that's the enemy. It's Communist China and their minions like Joe Biden in control of the White House.
[1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:55.520]  That's the facts. That's the information.
[1:15:55.520 --> 1:16:00.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:00.520 --> 1:16:26.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction. That's Newtonian physics.
[1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:32.520]  It's been proven to be very accurate since he observed that fact of this universe that God created.
[1:16:32.520 --> 1:16:37.520]  And so as negative as things are, as bad as things are, that is eliciting a massive response.
[1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:41.520]  Trump won the election by landslide. The majority of Americans know it polls.
[1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:45.520]  Everything Biden does is a joke. Everything he touches turns to crap.
[1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:52.520]  They're waging war. They want to domesticate us. They want to get us on the dull. They want to break our will. It's not going to work.
[1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:58.520]  And Ted Nugent is here at American Success Story to lay it out and just illustrate.
[1:16:58.520 --> 1:17:05.520]  It's great to have him as someone of a peer. He's my elder, but I go through the same lies where they just edit something or whole cloth lie.
[1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:10.520]  Well, when he sees that, he knows it's bull. When I say stuff about him, I know it's bull. All of it is an inversion.
[1:17:10.520 --> 1:17:18.520]  And so that's the key to remember that the left are just bad people and they're not going to stop.
[1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:25.520]  We just have to go on living and producing and building excellence and like fill the dreams they will come.
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:28.520]  But it really is coming to a head. What do we do about Biden?
[1:17:28.520 --> 1:17:35.520]  What do we do about him coming for the guns and dissolving the borders and new evidence of his son being on the Communist Chinese payroll?
[1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:38.520]  And what do we do about the Justice Department being globalist run?
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:46.520]  What do we do when the country's awake, but they've stolen the election and are really trying to start a civil war?
[1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:56.520]  Well, Alex, number one, we need more Alex Jones that are willing to put their literally their lives on the line spotlighting the cockroaches that have metastasized
[1:17:56.520 --> 1:18:03.520]  into every orifice, every every element of America, the media, our government, Hollywood, academia.
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:13.520]  It's literally at their best moment, their Marxists, more often than not, they're literally rock solid in this in the Satan column.
[1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:17.520]  If you look what they're doing, that the economy is all artificial.
[1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:26.520]  We're selling pork bellies and orange futures that there are no groves of orange to represent and the pigs won't have enough babies to produce the pork bellies that they're selling.
[1:18:26.520 --> 1:18:30.520]  I mean, I'm just the entire player, but I understand economics 101.
[1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:39.520]  But the most important thing is to support the Alex Jones to watch Tucker Carlson and look at the evidence and share it with our dumb friends and our dumb family members.
[1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:46.520]  With all due respect, I don't have any dumb family members and I don't have any dumb friends, but I see them wearing masks on their motorcycle.
[1:18:46.520 --> 1:18:52.520]  So I know there's some really dumb people out there that have turned into walking, breathing, mouth breathing zombies.
[1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:54.520]  But Alex, listen closely.
[1:18:54.520 --> 1:18:56.520]  I know the answer.
[1:18:56.520 --> 1:19:00.520]  That's awfully cocky of me, which I've got down to a science.
[1:19:00.520 --> 1:19:08.520]  Every American who believes in independence and freedom and the American dream outlined in the Constitution of the Bill of Rights.
[1:19:08.520 --> 1:19:18.520]  I'm telling you, you have to be a member of the National Rifle Association and the gun owners of America and the United States Concealed Carry Association.
[1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:21.520]  And let me stop you. Let me stop you because you've paid a big price.
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:27.520]  I know behind the scenes with all the big giant booking places, even though you can fill up stadiums, not doing it because you're pro America.
[1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:31.520]  The NRA is being attacked by George Soros's attorney general in New York.
[1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:33.520]  They're trying to basically arrest them.
[1:19:33.520 --> 1:19:35.520]  They're trying to bankrupt our organization.
[1:19:35.520 --> 1:19:39.520]  Now they're trying to keep them from fleeing to Texas to live in some form of freedom.
[1:19:39.520 --> 1:19:40.520]  Trump's had to leave New York.
[1:19:40.520 --> 1:19:42.520]  I mean, this we are in battle.
[1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:43.520]  I am in battled.
[1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:44.520]  You were in battle.
[1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:45.520]  The NRA is battled.
[1:19:45.520 --> 1:19:48.520]  People need to know we're confident about this.
[1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:49.520]  We're strong.
[1:19:49.520 --> 1:19:55.520]  We don't flop around like victims, but people better know now is the time to support with prayer, word of mouth and financially.
[1:19:55.520 --> 1:19:57.520]  The NRA, I totally agree.
[1:19:57.520 --> 1:20:03.520]  Well, because the NRA are at the executive board, God bless all the board members and all my fellow members.
[1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:05.520]  But the NRA is about we the people.
[1:20:05.520 --> 1:20:17.520]  It's the most important civil rights family organization in the world that stands up for the most powerful instinct and God given individual right to defend our lives to keep and bear.
[1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:21.520]  And the NRA under you on the board has gone from being soft 30 years ago to being hardcore.
[1:20:21.520 --> 1:20:24.520]  It's a wonderful organization and they're trying to demonize it.
[1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:27.520]  No, you just support it now more than ever.
[1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:36.520]  And let me point out a couple of others. I know it's a pain in the ass when you list different websites and organizations, but there's an organization called Hunter Nation.
[1:20:36.520 --> 1:20:38.520]  We made the difference.
[1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:40.520]  It's not a pain in the ass.
[1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:44.520]  In fact, another reason I wanted to get you on is now with the food running scares.
[1:20:44.520 --> 1:20:46.520]  They don't want us to be so sufficient.
[1:20:46.520 --> 1:20:50.520]  How important is it for people that have never been hunting or fishing to start getting into it?
[1:20:50.520 --> 1:20:53.520]  Are those of us that have been so busy to make ourselves go do it?
[1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:54.520]  It's so restful.
[1:20:54.520 --> 1:20:55.520]  We're supposed to do it.
[1:20:55.520 --> 1:20:56.520]  It's spiritual.
[1:20:56.520 --> 1:20:57.520]  You talk about it.
[1:20:57.520 --> 1:21:02.520]  Tell us how people get back into hunting or if they've not been involved in how they get involved.
[1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:23.520]  Well, certainly in during the Chinese virus attack, there were more hunting and fishing license sold that in decades because there is a instinctual understanding of the healing powers of nature and that all your food, clothing, shelter, weapons, tools, medicine and spirit comes from wildlife and wild ground.
[1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:30.520]  Some people have intentionally removed themselves from that nature reality, but the hunting, fishing, trapping families in this country have understood that.
[1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:36.520]  We embrace it and we live it to the nth degree of ultimate declaration of independence.
[1:21:36.520 --> 1:21:50.520]  So go to your local gun range, go down to Cabela's and Bass Pro, talk to the guys behind the counter, find that bow and arrow that turns you into a samurai alignment of the spiritual planets when you can put that arrow where you want it.
[1:21:50.520 --> 1:21:54.520]  And there is more wildlife, there's more deer, more turkey, more bear, more cougar.
[1:21:54.520 --> 1:21:55.520]  There's more antelope.
[1:21:55.520 --> 1:21:56.520]  There's more bison.
[1:21:56.520 --> 1:22:02.520]  They're having an emergency bison hunt in the Grand Canyon because they didn't harvest an adequate number over the years.
[1:22:02.520 --> 1:22:05.520]  And by the way, Joe Rogan didn't hunt till like 15 years ago.
[1:22:05.520 --> 1:22:06.520]  Now he does it all the time.
[1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:07.520]  He's totally addicted.
[1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:09.520]  He says it's the best thing in his life.
[1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:12.520]  Yeah, but people visit hunternation.com.
[1:22:12.520 --> 1:22:15.520]  I think it might be hunternation.org.
[1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:22.520]  Because there's regulations that are anti-hunting, that are anti-wildlife, that are anti-science.
[1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:23.520]  Visit hunternation.
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:24.520]  Here's another one.
[1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:25.520]  Very important.
[1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:29.520]  CreateChangeNow.org.
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:30.520]  Please write that down.
[1:22:30.520 --> 1:22:32.520]  CreateChangeNow.org.
[1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:42.520]  We're creating an army of conservatives across this country that are going to put the hardest pressure on our elected employees and the history of this experiment and self-government.
[1:22:42.520 --> 1:22:45.520]  Because they are elected employees.
[1:22:45.520 --> 1:22:49.520]  Don't care if they don't hear from you and if they don't hear from you.
[1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:50.520]  I totally agree.
[1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:51.520]  It is hunternation.org.
[1:22:51.520 --> 1:22:54.520]  Let's go back to that and then back to the political thing for a few minutes.
[1:22:54.520 --> 1:22:55.520]  We got to go.
[1:22:55.520 --> 1:22:57.520]  And we always want you back here, sir.
[1:22:57.520 --> 1:22:58.520]  Getting back to hunting.
[1:22:58.520 --> 1:23:02.520]  I found with leftist and liberals, I've taken a lot of Hollywood people out over the years.
[1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:04.520]  Mike Judge and I did a few times in Texas.
[1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:10.520]  They convert to shooting and hunting instantly and don't know why they were taught to hate it.
[1:23:10.520 --> 1:23:15.520]  So I found the most successful way to convert leftist is if you can get them hunting or fishing.
[1:23:15.520 --> 1:23:16.520]  There's no question about it.
[1:23:16.520 --> 1:23:24.520]  I've had such a success with that from the rock and roll world that I'm in where they've been brainwashed that somehow animals have rights in between the barbecue.
[1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:29.520]  The brain dead propaganda mushy goofiness that exists out there.
[1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:39.520]  But to the man and the woman and mostly the Ted Nugent camp for kids, children, we've baptized tens of thousands of people who were animal rights inclined because of the propaganda.
[1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:45.520]  And then they realize you want grass fed, natural, organic, renewable, ultimate, healthy protein.
[1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:47.520]  It's called venison.
[1:23:47.520 --> 1:23:53.520]  And they fall in love with the challenge, the spirituality of being out there because we don't kill much, especially with the bone arrow.
[1:23:53.520 --> 1:23:56.520]  But you understand your role in nature.
[1:23:56.520 --> 1:24:05.520]  And I'm telling you, when you return back to the city life or whatever life you lead, no matter how stress it is, there is a peacefulness.
[1:24:05.520 --> 1:24:12.520]  There is a stream of spiritual consciousness when you utilize God's healing powers of nature.
[1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:14.520]  I'm interfacing with God's creation.
[1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:15.520]  So hunternation.org.
[1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:18.520]  And then what's the other one for political action?
[1:24:18.520 --> 1:24:23.520]  CreateChangeNow.org, an army of conservatives.
[1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:25.520]  All right, listen, come back again sooner.
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:29.520]  I'd love to get you in studio or come up and see you at the ranch and say hi to your beautiful wife, my friend.
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:30.520]  You bet.
[1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:31.520]  God bless America.
[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:32.520]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:36.520]  All right, there goes Ted Nugent, who knew that the virus was real, always said it was.
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:38.520]  Got it, got healed with ivermectin.
[1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:40.520]  And now he's there warning people then you know about ivermectin.
[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:47.520]  So tell others about ivermectin because people will die, folks, if they don't demand ivermectin or the vitamins or minerals or the hydroxychloroquine.
[1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:50.520]  All right, the big secrets of the Wuhan virus are now out.
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:52.520]  We'll break it down on the other side.
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:53.520]  Stay with us.

[1:26:00.520 --> 1:26:06.520]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.

[1:27:56.520 --> 1:28:05.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:27.520]  I'm no stranger to the rain. I'm a friend of thunder. A friend isn't any wonder a lightning strikes me.
[1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:38.520]  I've fought with the devil, got down on his level, but I never gave in, so he gave up on me.
[1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:54.520]  I'm no stranger to the rain. I could spot bad weather, and I'm good at finding shelter in a downward fold.
[1:28:54.520 --> 1:29:04.520]  I've been sacrificed by brothers crucified by lovers.
[1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:13.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am about to break the most important news in my 27 years on air.
[1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:28.520]  This is absolutely incredible, and if this information does not bring the criminals to justice, if it does not reverse the operations that they've launched,
[1:29:28.520 --> 1:29:38.520]  then things are going to get a lot darker a lot quicker. Let me give you a summation before I go through the evidence.
[1:29:38.520 --> 1:29:48.520]  We've known that Bill Gates and the UN and Fauci and the Chai comms were doing level four bio weapons development of gain of function coronavirus research.
[1:29:48.520 --> 1:29:55.520]  That was known in 2015 at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. There was a major scandal. It was in the newspapers.
[1:29:55.520 --> 1:30:01.520]  Scientists blew the whistle and said this is dangerous. It's illegal. And so Obama had it moved to come into China.
[1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:09.520]  Just like he moved black sites out of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Jordan, and Egypt for torture to China.
[1:30:09.520 --> 1:30:17.520]  And that's highly classified. That's directly from CIA operatives that I've talked to two different ones separately, and later part of it came out.
[1:30:17.520 --> 1:30:25.520]  So they moved all this illegal stuff to come into China.
[1:30:25.520 --> 1:30:36.520]  And then when Trump was dominating, was defeating the impeachments, when they knew they didn't have the votes, they released it on purpose so they could then have a shutdown of the West.
[1:30:36.520 --> 1:30:45.520]  Communist China would never really shut down and it would become the dominant force, not the number two economy, which it now has in all the globals that were invested in China would make trillions and trillions of dollars,
[1:30:45.520 --> 1:30:54.520]  which they all have as well. And we would now go under a global ID, a global control with the UN in charge.
[1:30:54.520 --> 1:31:12.520]  We know the names of the scientists. We know who did it. We know. And now video has surfaced, not one video, but two videos, of the project manager and managers admitting to going and getting the five viruses.
[1:31:12.520 --> 1:31:29.520]  The Thanos in in game or something, and combining them all together to create the super weapon. Emergency alert Fauci project manager confesses to creating COVID-19.
[1:31:29.520 --> 1:31:43.520]  Tucker Carlson began to break this last night. I told you in the war room, we'd be breaking it today. He broke it. That's great. But he didn't get to the last part where he admits the project manager.
[1:31:43.520 --> 1:31:56.520]  But they didn't just go get the five viruses that they combined them for a vaccine. But to make the vaccine, you got to make the pathogen of something that never existed that no one would ever make.
[1:31:56.520 --> 1:32:03.520]  And again, you do it in China, show that when you release it on the world, it's a weapon for China to have power over the West.
[1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:16.520]  But you can't blame China because US and British contractors are involved organizing it with the UN and Bill Gates, who have been rooting for China and saying America's bad and saying our response was bad.
[1:32:16.520 --> 1:32:29.520]  So this globalist cabal went to China, did this with the Chinese. That's what the documents came out of the Australian newspapers two days ago, three days ago, I guess on Saturday, so four days ago.
[1:32:29.520 --> 1:32:38.520]  And the Chinese admit it's real their war college in 2015 saying we're developing SARS COVID weaponized systems.
[1:32:38.520 --> 1:32:45.520]  Now this five virus combo is only the carrier group. Its real power is the HIV delivery system.
[1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:52.520]  So the virus isn't that deadly unless you have autoimmune issues are very sick already preexisting conditions and or vitamin mineral deficiency.
[1:32:52.520 --> 1:33:09.520]  But as I predicted studying the spectrum of analysis, it's a carrier where they can easily release a new variant that they've already got in a laboratory frozen in a test tube in liquid oxygen that they can bring out and release anytime they want.
[1:33:09.520 --> 1:33:17.520]  They've even got manuals on what time to do it early morning hours into the air so that doesn't die via the sun and so that people coming out.
[1:33:17.520 --> 1:33:24.520]  Breathe it. You spray it on their doorsteps. You spray it into their ventilation systems at night.
[1:33:24.520 --> 1:33:31.520]  And they did a big implantation of it in Italy and other areas and the US.
[1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:41.520]  And so that's why they wouldn't let Trump and try to stop Trump from banning the Chinese flights up front. They wanted to get more of the carriers and China now basically admits they had carriers into the US.
[1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:48.520]  And then it quote gets rid of the old population of Gates already wants to pay out the trillions of dollars of benefits people paid into.
[1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:52.520]  So it's a multifaceted plan. They had to get all the hospitals on board.
[1:33:52.520 --> 1:34:03.520]  And now Tucker Carlson has come out in a 14 minute report last night that they're not posting the YouTube. So we posted the Band-Aid video and exposed this.
[1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:08.520]  The censored Tucker Carlson report Anthony Fauci let the coronavirus pandemic happen.
[1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:14.520]  Why isn't there a criminal investigation? That's the Fox News headline and Fox has the report.
[1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:22.520]  But it's not on YouTube. There it is censored. See the Tucker Carlson will on lab report. Fox News won't let you see.
[1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:29.520]  And that's the cruise great. I didn't give him a headline. I did say the headline this morning actually said say see the censored report.
[1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:37.520]  See the censored Tucker Carlson Anthony Fauci. So just change the headline please to censored and then this headline overhead shop please.
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:43.520]  This headline right here this headline Tucker Carlson Anthony Fauci let the coronavirus pandemic happen.
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:50.520]  Why isn't there a criminal investigation? Okay. This is the censored report in the sub headline.
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:55.520]  You explained that Fox isn't posting this online. They may have changed that since I went live.
[1:34:55.520 --> 1:35:04.520]  Okay. We'll also post that to info wars.com. So here's part of what Tucker Carlson said last night that I'm going to come back with the video.
[1:35:04.520 --> 1:35:10.520]  With the video of the project manager admitting it all the smoking gun.
[1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:13.520]  But here's Tucker Carlson last night. Those facts.
[1:35:13.520 --> 1:35:22.520]  WHO appointed none other than Peter Dasek as the only America based representative on the investigative team looking into where the virus came from.
[1:35:22.520 --> 1:35:29.520]  In what turned out to be a sham report that team concluded that it's quote extremely unlikely that the virus came from the Wuhan lab.
[1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:37.520]  Again, that's not true. The WHO's investigation in the origins of the virus was fraudulent and that matters to public health globally.
[1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:46.520]  But one thing you'll notice is that Tony Fauci did not say that. Why? Because once again he is implicated in it personally.
[1:35:46.520 --> 1:35:53.520]  The gain of function research that Peter Dasek was bragging about in the video we just showed you had in fact been banned explicitly by the US government.
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:36:02.520]  There was a federal moratorium on the funding of exactly the kind of gain of function experiments that went on in the Wuhan lab to disaster its effects.
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:08.520]  So why didn't the US government halt its funding of the lab in Wuhan?
[1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:14.520]  That is a central question and Nicholas Wade to his great credit looked into it and here's what he found quote.
[1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:27.520]  Someone wrote a loophole into the moratorium. The moratorium specifically barred funding of any gain of function research that increased the pathogenicity of the flu, MERS or SARS viruses.
[1:36:27.520 --> 1:36:43.520]  But then a footnote on page two of the moratorium document states that quote, an exception from the research pause may be obtained if the head of the US government funding agency determines that the research is urgently necessary to protect the public health or national security.
[1:36:43.520 --> 1:36:47.520]  And that's exactly the loophole that was exploited.
[1:36:47.520 --> 1:37:01.520]  Who signed off on this? Tony Fauci, possibly along with Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, invoked that special exemption in order to keep funding the Wuhan lab and the deadly experiments that were going on there.
[1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:04.520]  The experiments that clearly went so wrong.
[1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:25.520]  According to Richard E. Bright quote, unfortunately, the NIAID director that be Fauci and the NIH director exploited this loophole to issue exemptions to projects subject to pause, preposterously asserting that the exempted research was quote, urgently necessary to protect public health or national security and thereby nullifying the pause.
[1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:31.520]  This wouldn't have happened if Tony Fauci didn't allow it to happen.
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:34.520]  That is clear.
[1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:37.520]  It's an amazing story. It is a shocking story.
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:47.520]  In a functional country, there would be a criminal investigation currently underway into Tony Fauci's role in the COVID pandemic that has killed millions and halted our country and changed it forever.
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:51.520]  So why isn't there a criminal investigation into Tony Fauci's role?
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:53.520]  I'll tell you why when we come back with the bombshell.
[1:37:53.520 --> 1:38:04.520]  What's the most important part, let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist, the treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important, but the fuel is paramount and that's my allegor.
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:23.520]  Turbo Force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system, metabolism of a human.

[1:39:53.520 --> 1:40:08.520]  I'm driving home at 7 o'clock at night on Monday night to see my family, and I just remember there's only two days left for our wonderful listeners to get incredibly high-quality, storeable food at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere at preparewithalix.com.
[1:40:08.520 --> 1:40:19.520]  These are 20-20 prices for a limited time for our listeners, and then the price isn't just going to go back to regular, it's going to have to go up. Everybody else has already raised prices way more than my Patreon.

[1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:39.520]  Preparewithalix.com. I would take advantage of this with what's happening in food price increases around the world.
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:53.520]  I predict that by the fall you're going to see major shortages and you're going to see huge price increases. I think it's a smart bet right now to get high-quality, storeable food at last year's prices while you still can at preparewithalix.com.
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:41:07.520]  The BioProse are the new non-GMO pollution solution using eco-friendly products to treat everyday problems while supporting our environment.

[1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:37.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide. I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm going to give you the rest of the story of what Tucker Carlson just dropped, the Mega Bombshell, and the fact that prestigious science writers in mainstream news are now reporting everything that we told you over a year ago here on air, because the documents were already there.
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:56.520]  But now new information has been discovered of the very people involved bragging that they were creating a five virus chimera bio weapon to produce a vaccine, exactly what Dr. Francis A. Boyle said 15 months ago.
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:09.520]  That was February, early February of last year. Gosh, that's more than 15 months ago now. Man, time is flying, and it's not about being right. It's about we don't make stuff up here. We make mistakes sometimes.
[1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:25.520]  I wish I was wrong about a lot more, because we have a very accuracy rate, probably 98%. And usually things are worse than we thought. Usually the mistake is that things are worse than we thought.
[1:43:25.520 --> 1:43:34.520]  So let me now get to this as quickly and as cogently as I can.
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:51.520]  Before I hit this bombshell info, here's some background. Here's Fauci this year telling Senator Rand Paul he knows nothing about gain of function research when he specifically funded Peter Daska to carry this out.
[1:43:51.520 --> 1:43:58.520]  And that's in all the admissions and that's in all the documents and they moved it from Chapel Hill, and he was directly over it. And I'll show you those articles in a moment.
[1:43:58.520 --> 1:44:10.520]  So here he is lying to Congress about putting in the spike protein that is the HIV spike protein that allows it to go into the mucous membrane and go right into ourselves. Here it is.
[1:44:10.520 --> 1:44:34.520]  Dr. Fauci, do you still support funding of the NIH funding of the lab in Wuhan? Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely and completely incorrect that the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain of function research in the Wuhan Institute.
[1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:41.520]  Do they fund Dr. Barrick? We do not fund. Do you fund Dr. Barrick's gain of function research?
[1:44:41.520 --> 1:44:51.520]  Dr. Barrick does not do gain of function research and if it is, it's according to the guidelines and it is being conducted in North Carolina.
[1:44:51.520 --> 1:45:06.520]  What do you think concerning a bat virus spike protein that he got from the Wuhan Institute into the SARS virus' gain of function? That is not a minority because at least 200 scientists have signed a statement from the Cambridge Working Group saying that it is gain of function.
[1:45:06.520 --> 1:45:16.520]  Well, it is not. And if you look at the grant and you look at the progress reports, it is not gain of function despite the fact that the people tweet.
[1:45:16.520 --> 1:45:27.520]  That is the criminal himself saying that back in May. That is just recently.
[1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:38.520]  So he is in a lot of trouble. He looks extremely scared. Paul asked him that a few months ago. This is breaking now. This is happening just today. Wow.
[1:45:38.520 --> 1:45:47.520]  I thought that was the old clip when they said, hey, we got the clip of Fauci denying it. Wow. Wow. Man, this is moving in a lot of time.
[1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:52.520]  Okay. So here it is.
[1:45:52.520 --> 1:46:09.520]  Peter Dasgev, president of EcoHealth Alliance starting in 14 was project lead on six NIH projects with focus on the emergence of novel zoonotic coronaviruses COVID with bad origins.
[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:17.520]  Some of the project's work was performed at the Wuhan Institute of Oralogy. Now we're going to show you him saying that it's an hour long interview.
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:29.520]  Researchers are considered gain of function studies. The six project receive a total funding of $3,748,715 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.
[1:46:29.520 --> 1:46:41.520]  That's what Fauci is the head of. And we've got all the grants and all that right here. And there's huge articles with the former top New York Times science writer detailing it all.
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:44.520]  That's what Tucker was going off of.
[1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:51.520]  So here, ladies and gentlemen, is him in an interview taped December 9, 2019. That's the date on the interview.
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:56.520]  It was then finally posted on May 19 of last year, a year ago.
[1:46:56.520 --> 1:47:02.520]  And here is the project manager who was given money directly by the NIH on record.
[1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:13.520]  It's mainstream news to carry this out. Peter Dasik to do it. And there was Fauci just now today in the Senate lying, looking scared as hell.
[1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:22.520]  Again, he already did not a few months ago. Here he is when this is already out denying it. Wow. So here is the smoking gun.
[1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:32.520]  We went out to Southern China and did surveillance of bats across Southern China. And we've now found after, you know, six or seven years of doing this,
[1:47:32.520 --> 1:47:43.520]  over 100 new SARS related coronaviruses very close to SARS. Some of them get into human cells in the lab.
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:52.520]  Some of them can cause SARS disease and humanized mice models and are untreatable with therapeutic monoclonals.
[1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:57.520]  And you can't vaccinate against them with the vaccine. So these are clear and present danger.
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:04.520]  We've even found people with antibodies in Yunnan to SARS related coronaviruses. So there's a human exposure.
[1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:12.520]  We're now doing surveillance. We're just beginning another five years of work to look at cohorts in Southern China to say,
[1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:16.520]  well, how frequent does this spillover happen? And is it associated with disease?
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:27.520]  Because I expect just like Nipro and Bangladesh, there are dozens and dozens of small spillovers going on on the planet at any one time, which we just never see.
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:33.520]  Sure. They never amplify. There are a few cases and they're just absorbed in the illness, the overall illness of the population, right?
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:40.520]  No, you could say, so who cares? You know, and that's one argument. But our strategy is any one of those could become pandemic.
[1:48:40.520 --> 1:48:50.520]  There's a lot of stochasticity in what happens then. So if we look at all of them, understand patterns, try and reduce the number of spillover events we've got.
[1:48:50.520 --> 1:48:58.520]  But if you're saying these are diverse coronaviruses and you can't vaccinate against them, there are no antivirals. What do we do?
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:06.520]  Well, I think coronaviruses are pretty good. I mean, you're a virologist, you know, all this stuff, but you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily.
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:17.520]  Just spike protein drives a lot of what happens with coronaviruses at zoonotic risk. So you can get the sequence, you can build the protein and we work with Ralph Barrick at UNC to do this.
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:27.520]  Insert it into backbone of another virus and do some work in the lab. So you can get more predictive when you find a sequence. You've got this diversity.
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:37.520]  Now, the logical progression for vaccines is if you're going to develop a vaccine for SARS, people are going to use, you know, pandemic SARS.
[1:49:37.520 --> 1:49:42.520]  But let's try and insert some of these other related and get a better vaccine.
[1:49:42.520 --> 1:49:50.520]  And I guess also knowledge of what's there. If you see something emerging, give a head start on making a vaccine or a therapeutic.
[1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:58.520]  That's true. If you see five viruses merging, you get ahead of it. They don't do that would take millions of years.
[1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:01.520]  The scientists have to happen naturally. It just just happened magically.
[1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:07.520]  They they it's all merged at the Indian and the Australian scientists said a year ago, the peace shuttle teams, the HIV added.
[1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:09.520]  They didn't come from a bat. They created it.
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:18.520]  He's just hearing. We went out. We got it. We mixed it together for a vaccine, which we know they were developing vaccines at the little lab funded by the NIH for those five viruses.
[1:50:18.520 --> 1:50:23.520]  And he just admitted it. And that's what COVID-19 is, but it gets worse.
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:32.520]  When we come back, Fauci funded the University of Texas himself directly out of his organization, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:42.520]  to study coronaviruses, vaccines of what it would do on lab rats, and it caused protein problems, heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, you name it.
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:49.520]  Just in the last two days, I've talked to two people in my office, one in that building and one in this building that works directly for us.
[1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:53.520]  But she doesn't want to come on there. She's getting her uncle on tomorrow who got the shot.
[1:50:53.520 --> 1:50:57.520]  They had a stroke the next day and her cousin got super sick and almost killed him.
[1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:03.520]  She hasn't been here for days taking care of them, but now they're going to come on the show. That's people right next to me.
[1:51:03.520 --> 1:51:07.520]  This is an attack. We have all the science. They did it on purpose.
[1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:14.520]  And they think it's so horrible we won't ever admit to ourselves what's happened. Listen, I can't keep this on air unless you fund this.
[1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:18.520]  Plus, we've got great products, but nobody's fighting like we are. Thanks to your support. We're here.
[1:51:18.520 --> 1:51:23.520]  Please know we've got to end the turbo for sale very soon because we've got a limited amount of the 10-hour clean energy in.
[1:51:23.520 --> 1:51:28.520]  People absolutely love it. It's amazing. And because of the breakdown, we've got a very small shipment.
[1:51:28.520 --> 1:51:35.520]  We're going to have to end the 40% off this weekend, maybe sooner, because I want to then go back to regular price when more comes in in a few months, I guess.
[1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:37.520]  Hopefully, from the operation, that sale is going to end.
[1:51:37.520 --> 1:51:41.520]  Turbo force, ultimate, fish oil is amazing. 50% off. That's going to end soon.
[1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:43.520]  Old acrylic oil, I think it's already sold out.

[1:52:27.520 --> 1:52:30.520]  We're in an info war. We're not backing down.
[1:52:30.520 --> 1:52:34.520]  And thank God, thanks to all your action and others' action, the truth's coming out.
[1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:40.520]  We salute Tucker Carlson and others. But there's the head of the coronavirus program admitting they were building COVID-19.
[1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:43.520]  These folks be gone.
[1:52:43.520 --> 1:52:52.520]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the shutdown of the east coast gasoline pipeline
[1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:58.520]  that goes from Houston right up through New York City and supplies more than half of the gasoline to the east coast.
[1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:03.520]  New isn't that actually shut down the main pipeline from Canada through the Midwest to Houston
[1:53:03.520 --> 1:53:07.520]  to refine the oil that's then turned into gas and sent to the east coast.
[1:53:07.520 --> 1:53:12.520]  That's right. Joe Biden shut down the Keystone pipeline right after it was completed.
[1:53:12.520 --> 1:53:17.520]  Joe Biden did that to America. He has the history. He has the background.
[1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:20.520]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels.
[1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:24.520]  He's the one that's trying to extend the lockdowns of the country.
[1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:28.520]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world.
[1:53:28.520 --> 1:53:34.520]  And they want the United States, Europe and Australia crippled so Communist China can be dominant.
[1:53:34.520 --> 1:53:40.520]  It's not Russia that's the enemy. It's Communist China and their millions like Joe Biden in control of the White House.
[1:53:40.520 --> 1:53:43.520]  That's the facts. That's the information.
[1:53:43.520 --> 1:53:50.520]  When listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say thank you for what you've done.
[1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:55.520]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air. Thank you for praying for us and thank you for spreading the word.
[1:53:55.520 --> 1:54:02.520]  If all of you will simply go to infowarsstore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or a droid,
[1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:06.520]  it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[1:54:06.520 --> 1:54:12.520]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[1:54:12.520 --> 1:54:18.520]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech and the globalist are predatory and are evil.
[1:54:18.520 --> 1:54:25.520]  And in the surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:32.520]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings. They're available at infowarsstore.com in four different colors and they are only $19.95.
[1:54:32.520 --> 1:54:36.520]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere.
[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:39.520]  They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the InfoWars.
[1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:43.520]  Please take action today. Protect your privacy and fund the InfoWars.
[1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:49.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:05.520]  Ha ha ha! Yeah!
[1:55:05.520 --> 1:55:09.520]  I smell blubberless blood in the water.
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:14.520]  And I mean that as a parable.
[1:55:14.520 --> 1:55:19.520]  I mean that as an archetype, but nevertheless.
[1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:24.520]  Well, Gregory's has put out a particularly powerful report. All his reports are powerful.
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:28.520]  It is evidence of self-spreading vaccines being used for depopulation.
[1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:34.520]  I aired it during one of these little No Man's Land segments last hour, but I'm probably going to air it during the full transmission again.
[1:55:34.520 --> 1:55:41.520]  This one deserves to be aired during the full transmission, but some states don't care this five, so I'm going to pick up where I left off, the bombshell of bombshells.
[1:55:41.520 --> 1:55:49.520]  The director of the Game of Function coronavirus program admittedly refusing five viruses into one was their goal.
[1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:53.520]  He said, what's coming next? Which is what they were already doing. That's how they were working.
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:58.520]  Research science, you tell people about your last project. You say coming is the new project even though it's done.
[1:55:58.520 --> 1:56:06.520]  And like you tell your kid, I hear Santa Claus is bringing you a bicycle for Christmas. You tell him that in December 1st because the bike's already, you know, already your storage shed.
[1:56:06.520 --> 1:56:09.520]  You just got to put it together. It's the same deal.
[1:56:09.520 --> 1:56:18.520]  But here is a new report. The age of bio weapons is here. Only way this dog hunts and gets out of the backyard is you let him out.
[1:56:18.520 --> 1:56:22.520]  So here is the report from John Bowne.
[1:56:22.520 --> 1:56:27.520]  And they're now calling for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to have the Pentagon and CIA take him out.
[1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:37.520]  We need to understand that people in authority lie. People in authority will abuse every power that we relinquish to them.
[1:56:37.520 --> 1:56:45.520]  And right now we are giving them the power to micromanage every bit of our lives 24 hours a day.
[1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:49.520]  They're going to know where we are. They're going to know the money that we spend.
[1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:55.520]  They're going to have access to our children. They're going to have the right to compel.
[1:56:55.520 --> 1:56:59.520]  A message heard vocally and on posters.
[1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:07.520]  Thousands of parents and their children lined at the L.O.V. and the state capitol early in the morning filled with emotions.
[1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:10.520]  Most of it, frustration and anger.
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:19.520]  Because the virus is sweeping across the country. And it's not COVID-19. It's communism.
[1:57:19.520 --> 1:57:25.520]  Just last week lawmakers spent up to 16 hours debating this controversial bill in the House.
[1:57:25.520 --> 1:57:32.520]  One that would remove Connecticut's religious and medical exemption for schools beginning with the 2022 school year.
[1:57:32.520 --> 1:57:36.520]  Blood clots, heart attacks, strokes, and it's all in the literature.
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:39.520]  Fauci funded studies at the University of Texas.
[1:57:39.520 --> 1:57:50.520]  Level four bioweapons lab and conclusively found that any vaccine for a coronavirus, which is what I've never done them, causes massive blood clots.
[1:57:50.520 --> 1:57:56.520]  The body eats holes in the heart lining, in the artery lining, and in the lungs, particularly in lab rats.
[1:57:56.520 --> 1:58:10.520]  Phyzer, BioNTech, and Moderna are DNA genetically engineered and they were funded by the Pentagon DARPA.
[1:58:10.520 --> 1:58:23.520]  I realized that what we were going to have here was the Gulf War syndrome on steroids, especially for the people targeted.
[1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:29.520]  This is basically the Nazi philosophy of useless ears.
[1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:38.520]  They get every group involved at the top so they're all corrupted and that brings in the world government.
[1:58:38.520 --> 1:58:44.520]  So you have the UN, you have the Communist Chinese, you have them all with gain of function viruses.
[1:58:44.520 --> 1:58:53.520]  Being developed at Lujan and University of Texas, Galveston, as I told you a year ago, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and many other places.
[1:58:53.520 --> 1:59:05.520]  What's going on here is they have plausible deniability when they create these things so that even when it gets out, which is the plan, they claim it's an accident.
[1:59:05.520 --> 1:59:08.520]  Or if there is an accident, everybody can point their fingers at each other.
[1:59:08.520 --> 1:59:15.520]  When you hear COVID-19, that means global, UN, world government, bio assault on the planet to bring in world government.
[1:59:15.520 --> 1:59:25.520]  The Chinese are allied with the globalists, the globalists colonize them with their Communist Party, and so you have people inside the US that are patriots and government getting that out.
[1:59:25.520 --> 1:59:30.520]  And so China will then blame the army, but it's above that, it's the globalists doing the whole thing.
[1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:41.520]  The Chinese military discussed weaponizing COVID in 2015 to cause the enemy's medical system to collapse, and of course to collapse our economic system.
[1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:51.520]  What do you think happened? That's the year Obama moved the COVID-19 system to Wuhan.

[2:01:19.520 --> 2:01:24.520]  One last breath, the four windows that arrange your ears.
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:27.520]  Tell the hoods not to catch me burning.
[2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:29.520]  Fuck up your wife.
[2:01:29.520 --> 2:01:30.520]  Children now.
[2:01:30.520 --> 2:01:34.520]  It's time to wield the blade.
[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:37.520]  Now you got some company.
[2:01:37.520 --> 2:01:40.520]  You hear that falchion, Gates?
[2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:43.520]  And if you're the Four Horsemen, think again.
[2:01:43.520 --> 2:01:46.520]  Injust belongs to God.
[2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:48.520]  Onto the dead of night.
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:51.520]  It's the horseman ride.
[2:01:51.520 --> 2:01:54.520]  So treat your feet and die.
[2:01:54.520 --> 2:01:57.520]  Oh, yeah.
[2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:00.520]  You've been dying since the day you were born.
[2:02:00.520 --> 2:02:03.520]  You know it's all been planned.
[2:02:03.520 --> 2:02:07.520]  I like the fact that James Hatfield came out against the vaccines.
[2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:09.520]  That's good to know.
[2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:11.520]  I was talking to Dave Mustaine one time.
[2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:12.520]  I'm not name-dropping.
[2:02:12.520 --> 2:02:17.520]  He said, I want you to help me write the new album with songs like Four Horsemen I wrote.
[2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:19.520]  And I just looked at him and grabbed along in my car.
[2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:22.520]  And Austin, I said, dude, this is a very surreal day.
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:24.520]  We just had dinner with Willie Nelson.
[2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:28.520]  And I said, I said, I think that's up to you to write that album.
[2:02:28.520 --> 2:02:32.520]  And he did write that album called Endgame based on my film Endgame,
[2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:38.520]  which, by the way, we brought back and which is going to be still at $3.95 until this weekend.
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:41.520]  And then it's going to go to $9.95 in price.
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:44.520]  Hardcover, DVD, hours of extras on it.
[2:02:44.520 --> 2:02:49.520]  It exposes the whole great reset 14 years before it did.
[2:02:49.520 --> 2:02:51.520]  Every library should have this.
[2:02:51.520 --> 2:02:56.520]  Get it, make copies, donate the hardcover copies to your local library or your local VA
[2:02:56.520 --> 2:02:58.520]  because people need to see this.
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:02.520]  They need to understand it to understand the attack we're under infowarstore.com.
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:07.520]  OK, let's stop right there.
[2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:18.520]  If you just joined us, before I hit more of this news, I just want to say this is hands down the biggest crop of awakening,
[2:03:18.520 --> 2:03:22.520]  the biggest hall of truth, the biggest wound to the globalist,
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:31.520]  the biggest opportunity to deal with deathblood of these people politically to their agenda, to kill their agenda.
[2:03:31.520 --> 2:03:33.520]  And I mean, the dominoes start falling.
[2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:35.520]  You're going to have Nuremberg trials.
[2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:41.520]  I mean, there's going to be people getting hung because that's what happens when you launch a bioattack.
[2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:49.520]  You get marched up there and they pull a switch and a trapdoor opens up and you fall about two feet and that's what happens.
[2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:53.520]  And your legs start kicking and you take a dump down the side of your leg.
[2:03:53.520 --> 2:03:54.520]  I don't like death.
[2:03:54.520 --> 2:03:55.520]  I don't like killing people.
[2:03:55.520 --> 2:03:59.520]  I don't like starting to fight with these murderers, but they started to fight with us.
[2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:11.520]  And I'm just telling you, like I said in the first hour, that we don't want any violence against Fauci or Bill Gates or the New World Order from vigilantes.
[2:04:11.520 --> 2:04:17.520]  We want to take our governments and our countries back and we want to have them indicted with all the evidence.
[2:04:17.520 --> 2:04:21.520]  And we want to see them up on Nuremberg too.
[2:04:21.520 --> 2:04:28.520]  And that's what last weekend, the weekend before last, I had Dr. Francis Boyle on and he laid all that as well.
[2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:31.520]  And the punishment for what they've done is death.
[2:04:31.520 --> 2:04:33.520]  And so I don't say that to be dramatic.
[2:04:33.520 --> 2:04:35.520]  I don't say that to stick my head in the mouth of a lion.
[2:04:35.520 --> 2:04:38.520]  These guys are hyenas and still they can bite.
[2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:41.520]  I do it because I will not be a coward.
[2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:48.520]  And I want to thank God for your prayers, listeners, and I want to thank God for God taking action.
[2:04:48.520 --> 2:04:57.520]  This is devastating, devastating, devastating.
[2:04:57.520 --> 2:05:01.520]  There's no way to describe how much trouble they're in.
[2:05:01.520 --> 2:05:06.520]  And I can tell you this, they're never going to get out of this now.
[2:05:06.520 --> 2:05:12.520]  One way or another, this is a political death blow to what these guys did.
[2:05:12.520 --> 2:05:14.520]  They're megalomaniacs though.
[2:05:14.520 --> 2:05:15.520]  They were mad at Trump.
[2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:16.520]  They were mad at Bolsonaro.
[2:05:16.520 --> 2:05:20.520]  They were mad at Boris Johnson, who's a follower, but thought he was winning Brexit and could do what he wanted.
[2:05:20.520 --> 2:05:29.520]  They launched this to bankrupt the small economy, to bankrupt the hardworking people, to let the global banks and big box stores take over with Big Tech.
[2:05:29.520 --> 2:05:33.520]  And they had it cooked up and they had it ready and they did it in China so they could release it.
[2:05:33.520 --> 2:05:37.520]  So they had plausible deniability and so was an attack on humanity.
[2:05:37.520 --> 2:05:43.520]  And then they had the very individuals that ran the operation for gain of function.
[2:05:43.520 --> 2:05:50.520]  Peter, Dasek, and others write the paper for Lancet and their own emails have been now leaked by their colleagues.
[2:05:50.520 --> 2:05:51.520]  People are blowing the whistle now.
[2:05:51.520 --> 2:05:52.520]  That's what's happening.
[2:05:52.520 --> 2:05:58.520]  Where they're telling them, don't let anyone know that we are writing all of this.
[2:05:58.520 --> 2:05:59.520]  It's all right there.
[2:05:59.520 --> 2:06:02.520]  These are just my notes.
[2:06:02.520 --> 2:06:04.520]  We're going to go over all of this for you in this hour.
[2:06:04.520 --> 2:06:06.520]  This is just mega massive.
[2:06:06.520 --> 2:06:11.520]  And they're now video of them admitting it, not just the documents.
[2:06:11.520 --> 2:06:13.520]  And a lot of these people are useful idiots.
[2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:17.520]  That will come out in the Nuremberg trials.
[2:06:17.520 --> 2:06:23.520]  Because we're not like the globalists that want to just grab people out of their houses at night and shoot them in a ditch somewhere.
[2:06:23.520 --> 2:06:25.520]  We want all this to come out.
[2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:33.520]  We want to take years if need be to just pour over all the evidence and punish severely everyone involved.
[2:06:33.520 --> 2:06:44.520]  So other people that have this hankering like fictional movies, 12 monkeys described to kill people.
[2:06:44.520 --> 2:06:47.520]  Now the bombshell of bombshells is Rob do walked in here during a break.
[2:06:47.520 --> 2:06:57.520]  He goes, hey, it's in the computer in there that Fauci said was asked by Rand Paul about gain of function.
[2:06:57.520 --> 2:06:58.520]  And he said it wasn't happening.
[2:06:58.520 --> 2:07:00.520]  I figured it was like three months ago.
[2:07:00.520 --> 2:07:01.520]  The same thing happened.
[2:07:01.520 --> 2:07:02.520]  He lied.
[2:07:02.520 --> 2:07:03.520]  Then I thought, okay, that's a good clip to show.
[2:07:03.520 --> 2:07:08.520]  I didn't realize when they played it, it was this morning.
[2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:16.520]  And man, did he lie.
[2:07:16.520 --> 2:07:18.520]  So this is a big deal.
[2:07:18.520 --> 2:07:23.520]  And I'm here to tell you that I have never felt so much fulfillment.
[2:07:23.520 --> 2:07:25.520]  And I wouldn't call it satisfaction.
[2:07:25.520 --> 2:07:26.520]  This is a horrible thing.
[2:07:26.520 --> 2:07:27.520]  We're in a global war.
[2:07:27.520 --> 2:07:29.520]  The globalist war was humanity.
[2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:31.520]  This is a terrible thing happening.
[2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:39.520]  But I've been around 47 years and I have never, never felt so much satisfaction in my life.
[2:07:39.520 --> 2:07:45.520]  Except maybe a few times where I was getting my ass absolutely beat.
[2:07:45.520 --> 2:07:54.520]  And I dug down deep and turned on the, turned on the Ben Grim Power and, you know, broke that guy's jaw and saw his head at the ground.
[2:07:54.520 --> 2:07:55.520]  And I wasn't happy.
[2:07:55.520 --> 2:07:57.520]  I'd hurt him bad, but I was happy that I'd won the fight.
[2:07:57.520 --> 2:08:05.520]  It was just a feeling of just satisfaction that you just, you get it and you'd reach down and you turned it on.
[2:08:05.520 --> 2:08:13.520]  And risking my life, you risking your life, everything we've done together, man, the satisfaction right now.
[2:08:13.520 --> 2:08:16.520]  Because I can tell you, they're not going to survive this.
[2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:26.520]  And everything they've done to all these people, these millions they've killed, all the people they starved to death with the lockdown,
[2:08:26.520 --> 2:08:28.520]  they're going to get retribution.
[2:08:28.520 --> 2:08:32.520]  They're going to be avenged.
[2:08:32.520 --> 2:08:40.520]  And so I can just tell you that, man, I look, I'm just telling you,
[2:08:40.520 --> 2:08:44.520]  they'll probably release a new Bible up and down to cover this up, but it doesn't matter.
[2:08:44.520 --> 2:08:46.520]  What matters is getting right with God.
[2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:48.520]  And in the end, they're going to pay.
[2:08:48.520 --> 2:08:50.520]  And you're going to see all the signs of it.
[2:08:50.520 --> 2:08:53.520]  You see Gates's wife running for the hills right now.
[2:08:53.520 --> 2:08:55.520]  All the molestation stuff is going to come out.
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:08:58.520]  The devil worship, the cloning, all the mad scientist stuff.
[2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:00.520]  You think Hitler was bad or Stalin was bad?
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:05.520]  These guys were unimaginative lightweights compared to these people.
[2:09:05.520 --> 2:09:09.520]  Okay, these are heavyweight devils.
[2:09:09.520 --> 2:09:16.520]  The Bible describes Satan as a dragon.
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:19.520]  Well, the stupid KKK has grand dragons.
[2:09:19.520 --> 2:09:23.520]  That's like a grand lizard compared to a real dragon, folks.
[2:09:23.520 --> 2:09:25.520]  I mean, these guys are devils.
[2:09:25.520 --> 2:09:28.520]  Yeah, there's two of them.
[2:09:28.520 --> 2:09:31.520]  There's Gates hanging out with the other child molester.
[2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:34.520]  So that's who they are.
[2:09:34.520 --> 2:09:38.520]  And they only feel good when they're sucking life force out of people and when they're killing people.
[2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:40.520]  And when they're hurting people.
[2:09:40.520 --> 2:09:43.520]  So I'm done talking about this.
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:47.520]  I'm going to come back with the bombshells and I'm going to tie it all together.
[2:09:47.520 --> 2:09:53.520]  But my God, they control the Facebook and Apple and YouTube fact checkers.
[2:09:53.520 --> 2:09:59.520]  And everybody at Big Tech that signed on to this, you've now signed on to a bioweapon attack.
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:04.520]  You've now signed on to starving tens of millions in Africa, Latin America, and Asia and the Middle East.
[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:06.520]  You're killers now.
[2:10:06.520 --> 2:10:11.520]  You're just like the Nazis or just like the Soviets or just like mouths of people.
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:13.520]  You're big boys now.
[2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:15.520]  You always wanted to be somebody leftist.
[2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:21.520]  Well, you're signed on with devil worshiping pedophiles that wants to bio attack to take the planet over.
[2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:23.520]  And it's all coming out.
[2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:25.520]  It's all going to come out.
[2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:30.520]  To all you leftists, you ought to really be proud of yourselves, what you do.
[2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:34.520]  There's still time to repent for some of you and blow the whistle and people are blowing the whistle.
[2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:39.520]  You saw the former director of NIH, Redfield came out and spilled his guts.
[2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:43.520]  Because they know it's all coming out and they know nothing's going to stop it.
[2:10:43.520 --> 2:10:46.520]  Comprende, you got that?
[2:10:46.520 --> 2:11:15.520]  All right, we'll come back and finish all this TNews up. Stay with us.
[2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:29.520]  We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well.
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:32.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:35.520]  The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed.
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:40.520]  Until you wake up and this is a globalist chai-com takeover, Gregory said, you have no hope.
[2:11:40.520 --> 2:11:45.520]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[2:11:45.520 --> 2:11:51.520]  They told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[2:11:51.520 --> 2:11:57.520]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[2:11:57.520 --> 2:12:07.520]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stocked full of high quality Info Wars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:19.520]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:24.520]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:28.520]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars.
[2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:35.520]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[2:12:35.520 --> 2:12:54.520]  Now at the Info Wars store, sign up for auto-ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at infowarstore.com.
[2:12:54.520 --> 2:13:03.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:13:03.520 --> 2:13:15.520]  Now, just because I'm reveling in the enemy's bleed out doesn't mean they're not going to strike back at us.
[2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:26.520]  We're far from out of the woods when I can see the mountaintop through the moonlight.
[2:13:26.520 --> 2:13:31.520]  Alright, let's go over it right now. The rest of the story. Wow.
[2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:34.520]  We've known this since it happened.
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:40.520]  Side is across the U.S. warned of it six years ago. Obama and Fauci moved it overseas.
[2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:47.520]  They knew it was all coming out, so they had the Washington Post with that Rogan character, not Joe Rogan, the other Rogan.
[2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:54.520]  Come out and say, oh, it is Fauci and them and they're bad and they're covering it up and they were involved and they created it.
[2:13:54.520 --> 2:13:59.520]  But Obama moved it in 2015 because of whistleblowing.
[2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:09.520]  And remember Fauci very arrogantly bragged will play that next segment that don't worry Trump will be very challenged by a biological event very soon.
[2:14:09.520 --> 2:14:13.520]  I can assure you they didn't look so arrogant.
[2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:23.520]  Well known for helping spread HIV in the homosexual community when they first launched out of the tetanus through the through the hepatitis shots.
[2:14:23.520 --> 2:14:31.520]  Old Fauci, old Faustus. It looked so arrogant when Rand Paul was talking today and now he's been caught lying saying there is no gain of function.
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:43.520]  The U.S. government has assessed that the will on institute of virology was conducting gain of function research in some form report Josh Rogan noted in Politico in March.
[2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:50.520]  Jamie Mechel, an expert in gene editing, has also noted that the will on institute of virology performed gain of function.
[2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:57.520]  The discoverer of HIV said that the Indian Institute as a CRISPR, the Australian that has a CRISPR, they stand it.
[2:14:57.520 --> 2:15:00.520]  It looks like Frankenstein.
[2:15:00.520 --> 2:15:10.520]  It's even got the peace shuttle gene insertion points where they splice the damn viruses together.
[2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:14.520]  Rand Paul urges Fauci to ban a gain of function research, setting possible COVID lab leak.
[2:15:14.520 --> 2:15:18.520]  That's the mainstream media's whitewash in national review.
[2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:20.520]  It wasn't a leak.
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:22.520]  They launched it to take us down and lock us down.
[2:15:22.520 --> 2:15:23.520]  They had it all in lockstep.
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:25.520]  They had it all in the great leap forward.
[2:15:25.520 --> 2:15:30.520]  Cloud Schwab, great reset program.
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:37.520]  They had it all battle planned and they followed an exact script.
[2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:45.520]  Dr. Fauci assembled or tried to hide as long time support gain of function research which creates super viruses that jump from animals to humans.
[2:15:45.520 --> 2:15:48.520]  Rand Paul goes over all the evidence.
[2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:49.520]  That's what I told you.
[2:15:49.520 --> 2:15:50.520]  This is going to snowball now.
[2:15:50.520 --> 2:15:52.520]  Like I said yesterday, you can feel it.
[2:15:52.520 --> 2:15:53.520]  You can see it.
[2:15:53.520 --> 2:15:57.520]  You can smell it.
[2:15:57.520 --> 2:15:59.520]  Let's get to what's really sick.
[2:15:59.520 --> 2:16:07.520]  Not only did Peter Dazik run the program for Fauci, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:09.520]  I'll show you mainstream news reporting that.
[2:16:09.520 --> 2:16:11.520]  They have all the documents.
[2:16:11.520 --> 2:16:21.520]  They just go on TV December 9, 2019 and brag that they were merging all five viruses to produce a vaccine later, which is the pathogen itself that obviously was released.
[2:16:21.520 --> 2:16:22.520]  Am I saying he did it himself?
[2:16:22.520 --> 2:16:25.520]  No, somebody did.
[2:16:25.520 --> 2:16:26.520]  Who has the motive?
[2:16:26.520 --> 2:16:27.520]  Who has the background?
[2:16:27.520 --> 2:16:28.520]  Who battle planned at all?
[2:16:28.520 --> 2:16:29.520]  Fauci and Gates.
[2:16:29.520 --> 2:16:33.520]  Who wants to depopulate Gates and Fauci?
[2:16:33.520 --> 2:16:37.520]  And here's Fauci again who runs that institute just in case you think I'm making that up.
[2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:39.520]  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
[2:16:39.520 --> 2:16:44.520]  The 2012 study to see what it would do if you vaccinated people for that.
[2:16:44.520 --> 2:16:49.520]  Well, it gives them blood clots, gives them heart attacks, eats their lungs.
[2:16:49.520 --> 2:16:55.520]  Again, on screen you see Ralph C. Barrick who ran the program Chapel Hill, who ran the program at Wuhan.
[2:16:55.520 --> 2:16:57.520]  We have him with the Bat Lady at Wuhan.
[2:16:57.520 --> 2:17:01.520]  We have all the videos, all the photos and Rob too.
[2:17:01.520 --> 2:17:09.520]  It's putting together a report that will be ready either later in the shower or after the show today that will be featured at Bandod video.
[2:17:09.520 --> 2:17:13.520]  That is the smoking gun.
[2:17:13.520 --> 2:17:18.520]  The head of the Wuhan program confesses to creating COVID-19.
[2:17:18.520 --> 2:17:19.520]  The smoking gun.
[2:17:19.520 --> 2:17:21.520]  I mean, it's all happening now.
[2:17:21.520 --> 2:17:23.520]  And here's that article I mentioned.
[2:17:23.520 --> 2:17:36.520]  This is from the NIH on website immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology on challenge with the SARS virus and challenge means those injected with it.
[2:17:36.520 --> 2:17:38.520]  And it goes through it all right there.
[2:17:38.520 --> 2:17:40.520]  And it says that Fauci funded it in here.
[2:17:40.520 --> 2:17:47.520]  And it then has the conclusion that it causes an autoimmune response in the lungs and the heart and other areas.
[2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:59.520]  And that any application of SARS COVID-19 humans is received with caution.
[2:17:59.520 --> 2:18:04.520]  And it goes on.
[2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:06.520]  I'm going to find the actual printout.
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:07.520]  This is not the full printout.
[2:18:07.520 --> 2:18:09.520]  Guys, print me the whole study.
[2:18:09.520 --> 2:18:13.520]  The actual copy of the study, not just a printer friendly one because it disappears the blue links.
[2:18:13.520 --> 2:18:14.520]  Thank you.
[2:18:14.520 --> 2:18:15.520]  I'll show that next segment.
[2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:25.520]  Continuing eco health alliance orchestrated key scientist statement on natural origin of SARS COVID-2.
[2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:36.520]  The emails obtained via public records request shows that eco health alliance president Peter Daska grabs it a lands at statement and that intended to not be identified as coming from any organization or person.
[2:18:36.520 --> 2:18:47.520]  But rather be seen as simply a letter from leading scientist Dasik wrote as he wanted to avoid the appearance of political statement because he was running the program and then he wrote the lands at study that wasn't a study.
[2:18:47.520 --> 2:18:56.520]  And here's the lands at study right here for you on screen, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:18:56.520 --> 2:19:10.520]  And then here's the Indian studies uncanny similarity of unique inserts of the 2019 CN OV spike protein HIV one GP 120 and gag and it goes through and all they have scans of the virus and the whole nine yards.
[2:19:10.520 --> 2:19:11.520]  Now here's the big, big one.
[2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:14.520]  This is out of this is a big report at zero hedge.
[2:19:14.520 --> 2:19:17.520]  It is really long and detailed with all the documents.
[2:19:17.520 --> 2:19:24.520]  I suggest you read it bulletin of atomic scientists opens the Wuhan virus Pandora's box.
[2:19:24.520 --> 2:19:34.520]  There's one out of science at the wire from the former top New York Times science writer, Nicholas Wade, origins of COVID-19 who opened Pandora's box at Wuhan, people or nature.
[2:19:34.520 --> 2:19:36.520]  And then he details the whole thing.
[2:19:36.520 --> 2:19:39.520]  Everything we just told you and more.
[2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:49.520]  Meanwhile, Chinese military discussed weaponizing COVID in 2015 to cause enemies medical systems to collapse.
[2:19:49.520 --> 2:20:00.520]  Bombshell modernist chief medical officer admits mRNA alters DNA, but that's from three years ago, and that they actually edit your DNA and that it changes it.
[2:20:00.520 --> 2:20:01.520]  We're going to have that in the report.
[2:20:01.520 --> 2:20:10.520]  And then you see them demonizing Marjorie Taylor green slammed for mad claim that Fauci paid for creation of man made COVID.
[2:20:10.520 --> 2:20:11.520]  And that's not a raw story.
[2:20:11.520 --> 2:20:17.520]  The left hoping you don't see all this information for yourself.
[2:20:17.520 --> 2:20:19.520]  And again, I'm going to print that full study.
[2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:21.520]  We got like 10 copies of it later on here.
[2:20:21.520 --> 2:20:23.520]  You pull it out of your state stack, guys, please.
[2:20:23.520 --> 2:20:27.520]  So I can actually show you the actual original statement and it's in blue.
[2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:30.520]  So you can see the finding and see the recommendation not to make a vaccine.
[2:20:30.520 --> 2:20:33.520]  You see that Fauci funded it for some reason.
[2:20:33.520 --> 2:20:37.520]  The printer friendly did not print the parts that were in blue on that particular piece I had.
[2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:39.520]  All right, so that is all coming up.
[2:20:39.520 --> 2:20:44.520]  We've got the latest news on the nightmare situation when we return.
[2:20:44.520 --> 2:20:50.520]  And again, a detailed report that isn't just me live on air talking about all this.
[2:20:50.520 --> 2:20:53.520]  We'll be out soon that has all of it.
[2:20:53.520 --> 2:21:00.520]  The head director guy with the Bat Lady at Wuhan bragging they ran at all the different video clips of Fauci coming out lying about it.
[2:21:00.520 --> 2:21:04.520]  All of it in one devastating report at Band-Aid video.
[2:21:04.520 --> 2:21:11.520]  Remember big tech criminally has worked for 16 months to suppress the truth to cover it up.
[2:21:11.520 --> 2:21:16.520]  To block therapeutics to cover up shipping people with COVID in the nursing homes to kill people.
[2:21:16.520 --> 2:21:21.520]  It's all been one giant evil criminal assault of censorship and lies.
[2:21:21.520 --> 2:21:32.520]  And now it's all coming down crashing and burning and Facebook and YouTube and Google and the CEO of YouTube and all of them are complicit saying only the U.N.
[2:21:32.520 --> 2:21:42.520]  Which is advised by Fauci in a Wuhan lab and the Chinese can say anything about COVID, not medical doctors, not scientists, not the heads of universities, not virologists, not epidemiologists,
[2:21:42.520 --> 2:21:46.520]  not even women whose father died or sister died or they got sick.
[2:21:46.520 --> 2:21:47.520]  You complain about it.
[2:21:47.520 --> 2:21:48.520]  Shut up.
[2:21:48.520 --> 2:21:50.520]  You don't count Facebook and YouTube will silence you.
[2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:54.520]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off.
[2:21:54.520 --> 2:22:03.520]  The success is simple versus that if you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:04.520]  But I'll tell you this.
[2:22:04.520 --> 2:22:10.520]  The technocrats are really up in their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[2:22:10.520 --> 2:22:13.520]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance.
[2:22:13.520 --> 2:22:18.520]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[2:22:18.520 --> 2:22:21.520]  Everything you warned your friends and family about us around to be true.
[2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:24.520]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[2:22:24.520 --> 2:22:28.520]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:33.520]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:22:33.520 --> 2:22:35.520]  We have the power.
[2:22:35.520 --> 2:22:39.520]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:22:39.520 --> 2:22:44.520]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:47.520]  So be the polar bears you are.
[2:22:47.520 --> 2:23:00.520]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at surviving
[2:23:00.520 --> 2:23:02.520]  in this crazy environment when you have high-quality fish oil.
[2:23:02.520 --> 2:23:03.520]  We've got the best out there.
[2:23:03.520 --> 2:23:08.520]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:23:08.520 --> 2:23:11.520]  Everybody already knows what high-quality fish oil does.
[2:23:11.520 --> 2:23:15.520]  And it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[2:23:15.520 --> 2:23:17.520]  So this is also clean at fish oil.
[2:23:17.520 --> 2:23:20.520]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[2:23:20.520 --> 2:23:21.520]  Grill oil is set to sell out.
[2:23:21.520 --> 2:23:23.520]  It's amazing as well.
[2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:28.520]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.

[2:23:38.520 --> 2:23:40.520]  Blizzard thought I was joking.

[2:23:47.520 --> 2:23:48.520]  Ultimate fish oil.
[2:23:48.520 --> 2:23:49.520]  Infowarstore.com.
[2:23:49.520 --> 2:23:50.520]  Infowarstore.com.
[2:23:50.520 --> 2:23:51.520]  Infowarstore.com.
[2:23:51.520 --> 2:23:55.520]  I'm driving home at 7 o'clock at night on Monday night to see my family.
[2:23:55.520 --> 2:24:05.520]  And I just remember there's only two days left for our wonderful listeners to get incredibly high-quality, storeable food at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:24:05.520 --> 2:24:10.520]  These are 20-20 prices for a limited time for our listeners.
[2:24:10.520 --> 2:24:13.520]  When the price isn't just going to go back to regular, it's going to have to go up.
[2:24:13.520 --> 2:24:17.520]  Everybody else has already raised prices way more than my Patreon.
[2:24:17.520 --> 2:24:23.520]  We have their entire spectrum and catalog at infowarstore.com, PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:30.520]  You get an additional 10% off on three months, six months, your supplies, and everything else on the site.
[2:24:30.520 --> 2:24:32.520]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:37.520]  I would take advantage of this with what's happening in food price increases around the world.
[2:24:37.520 --> 2:24:43.520]  I predict that by the fall you're going to see major shortages and you're going to see huge price increases.
[2:24:43.520 --> 2:24:51.520]  I think it's a smart bet right now to get high-quality, storeable food at last year's prices while you still can at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:55.520]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet.
[2:24:55.520 --> 2:24:58.520]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[2:24:58.520 --> 2:25:02.520]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order.
[2:25:02.520 --> 2:25:06.520]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[2:25:06.520 --> 2:25:09.520]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[2:25:09.520 --> 2:25:11.520]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[2:25:11.520 --> 2:25:14.520]  But let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end.
[2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:17.520]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[2:25:17.520 --> 2:25:21.520]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowarstore.com.
[2:25:21.520 --> 2:25:23.520]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[2:25:23.520 --> 2:25:26.520]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[2:25:26.520 --> 2:25:28.520]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[2:25:28.520 --> 2:25:35.520]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[2:25:35.520 --> 2:25:37.520]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:40.520]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[2:25:40.520 --> 2:25:43.520]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:25:43.520 --> 2:25:46.520]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it.
[2:25:46.520 --> 2:26:07.520]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:17.520]  We're on the march. The globalists are on the run.
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:23.520]  All right, Alex Jones here on the front lines.
[2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:36.520]  And the first thing I want to play before I get into this document and I did get the full printout of the immunization SARS coronavirus vaccine leads to pulmonary immunopathology where they say extreme caution proceeding with vaccines for humans.
[2:26:36.520 --> 2:26:46.520]  Because it attacked and killed the rats and mice and the fact that it was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the University of Texas, that's Fauci.
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:51.520]  It's absolutely insane and tie that in with the Senate hearings today and more.
[2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:55.520]  But first, I want to play a short clip from the war room.
[2:26:55.520 --> 2:27:06.520]  Not Owen Schreuer 3 to 6 p.m. But Steve Bannon's war room. And I know Steve Bannon and Roger Stone have had their fights. I don't want to be in a fight with anybody.
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:09.520]  I've had my issues with Bannon. He's obviously a smart guy.
[2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:13.520]  But he and his host co-host made a statement about Alex Jones.
[2:27:13.520 --> 2:27:17.520]  People used to think it was crazy, but now he's improving right.
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:21.520]  Well, that's how it is when you're ahead of your time.
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:27.520]  But it's not about me being ahead of my time. It's about people realizing that we don't make this stuff up.
[2:27:27.520 --> 2:27:32.520]  We really tirelessly research and we have a wide spectrum understanding of the world.
[2:27:32.520 --> 2:27:39.520]  We're not specialists. We're generalists in that we really study how the globalist operate and we know how they do things.
[2:27:39.520 --> 2:27:43.520]  So we know how to counter them and we know how to beat them.
[2:27:43.520 --> 2:27:50.520]  Everything should be about the globalist because they're the ones in control of civilization taking us to a very bad place.
[2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:52.520]  And so that's what I'm getting at here.
[2:27:52.520 --> 2:27:58.520]  But it is good to see it trend yesterday. Alex Jones printed on Twitter again that Alex Jones was right.
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:03.520]  And you can just type in my name or you can do it all over many other places.
[2:28:03.520 --> 2:28:09.520]  And you just see people flooding with all the examples of hundreds of things I talked about that are admitted.
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:12.520]  But all the stuff I talked about was already there.
[2:28:12.520 --> 2:28:23.520]  How she already was the main fundraiser on lab before this came out. All this stuff is known. It's just that the corporate media won't touch it with a 10 foot pole.
[2:28:23.520 --> 2:28:27.520]  And other people are scared to report on it because they know you get attacked if you do.
[2:28:27.520 --> 2:28:37.520]  So really the globalist in a way built me up not intentionally because they would demonize me as a bad guy as a symbol of fraud.
[2:28:37.520 --> 2:28:44.520]  And then they would say oh look Alex Jones claims there's chemicals that make the frogs here. Alex Jones claims Fauci made the virus that will on.
[2:28:44.520 --> 2:28:47.520]  Oh he's a cookie. He's a racist. He's a bad guy.
[2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:55.520]  And then when it all comes out that it's true that backfires on them and blow up their face.
[2:28:55.520 --> 2:29:00.520]  And so that's basically what's happened here. And so it's a big deal.
[2:29:00.520 --> 2:29:06.520]  If you hadn't kept us on air up until this point we couldn't have had this big effect together. You did this.
[2:29:06.520 --> 2:29:11.520]  But through the thick and thin through the lies through the demonization through the attacks you stood with us listeners.
[2:29:11.520 --> 2:29:16.520]  And so every success we've had you've had. So I salute you and I thank you.
[2:29:16.520 --> 2:29:21.520]  But here is the war room with Steve Bannon last night.
[2:29:21.520 --> 2:29:29.520]  I mean and I think you know this is it's really difficult to do this without.
[2:29:29.520 --> 2:29:37.520]  I never thought I'd say this. But you look at the last 15 20 years of conservative commentary or across the Western world.
[2:29:37.520 --> 2:29:44.520]  He looked at people like Alex Jones right who for a decade I thought this guy is a nut job.
[2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:48.520]  And but you actually read between the lines of the things that he's sort of trying to communicate.
[2:29:48.520 --> 2:29:51.520]  It is kind of you know crazy way.
[2:29:51.520 --> 2:29:56.520]  He's a smart guy. He's the don't don't never discount Alex Jones's brilliance.
[2:29:56.520 --> 2:29:59.520]  But put it this way. Right.
[2:29:59.520 --> 2:30:04.520]  We've had a Christian pastor arrested in Canada. We try to get him on today.
[2:30:04.520 --> 2:30:08.520]  By the way we need to get an update. I'm sorry.
[2:30:08.520 --> 2:30:12.520]  I kind of forgot time flies. Have we got an update on our tour Pulaski.
[2:30:12.520 --> 2:30:15.520]  Cruz doing a great job. They're busier than I am.
[2:30:15.520 --> 2:30:18.520]  He got arrested last week and wouldn't even know where it was happening.
[2:30:18.520 --> 2:30:20.520]  I mean we're trying to open a church.
[2:30:20.520 --> 2:30:27.520]  When when the topless bars open down the street literally and target Walmart they're all seeing what they can get away with right now.
[2:30:27.520 --> 2:30:36.520]  So let's talk about this because it's such a horrifying thing happening.
[2:30:36.520 --> 2:30:42.520]  Are we going to admit we're under attack or tell ourselves that's too scary.
[2:30:42.520 --> 2:30:49.520]  I'm going to deny it because that's what's happening and things are only going to get worse.
[2:30:49.520 --> 2:30:53.520]  Pastor Pulaski speaks after being released from jail. Good. The rebel news.
[2:30:53.520 --> 2:30:57.520]  Well great. Let's try to get him on tomorrow. And I guess that's him with his brother.
[2:30:57.520 --> 2:31:01.520]  Boy they look like twins.
[2:31:01.520 --> 2:31:06.520]  All right folks. I meant to take calls today. I didn't Paul Watson's coming up.
[2:31:06.520 --> 2:31:13.520]  I got a lot to hit before the show's over in 22 minutes or for my part of the broadcast is over.
[2:31:13.520 --> 2:31:16.520]  But let me do this because it's so powerful.
[2:31:16.520 --> 2:31:19.520]  I aired it during that little no man's land first five of the second hour.
[2:31:19.520 --> 2:31:24.520]  But this is really an important report because this is all coming of age now.
[2:31:24.520 --> 2:31:26.520]  It's all coming to fruition.
[2:31:26.520 --> 2:31:29.520]  It's it's it's this is the time of great awakening that we're just entering.
[2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:33.520]  So a lot of this has been already reported but it's kind of the latest added to it.
[2:31:33.520 --> 2:31:36.520]  It's at Bandot video in the Gregory's section.
[2:31:36.520 --> 2:31:38.520]  Look on the left hand corner and go to it.
[2:31:38.520 --> 2:31:45.520]  Evidence of self spreading vaccines being used for depopulation.
[2:31:45.520 --> 2:31:52.520]  And it's it's a part three on the shedding that's definitely going on when they turn us into an engine.
[2:31:52.520 --> 2:31:55.520]  A weapon to release this synthetic RNA.
[2:31:55.520 --> 2:31:59.520]  And now they admit that most of the people in the hospitals with COVID took the shot.
[2:31:59.520 --> 2:32:01.520]  That's even a mainstream news.
[2:32:01.520 --> 2:32:03.520]  It was like a Yale doctor three weeks ago.
[2:32:03.520 --> 2:32:07.520]  And now this week it's like, yeah, people are got COVID that took the shot.
[2:32:07.520 --> 2:32:10.520]  The answer is more shots. No.
[2:32:10.520 --> 2:32:14.520]  No. So here is that incredibly report report.
[2:32:14.520 --> 2:32:18.520]  I'm bound to the great report as well. Please share those. This is life and death. Here it is.
[2:32:18.520 --> 2:32:24.520]  The official death numbers from 2020 are out for the United States.
[2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:31.520]  And only 5% of those labeled as COVID deaths actually died from COVID.
[2:32:31.520 --> 2:32:38.520]  Less than 19,000 people in the U.S. died from COVID-19 in 2020.
[2:32:38.520 --> 2:32:43.520]  Far less than those who die each year from the flu or cold.
[2:32:43.520 --> 2:32:50.520]  Another bald faced big pharma fraud admitted to in their own fine print.
[2:32:50.520 --> 2:33:01.520]  They've gotten away with falsifying the numbers before to fake a swine flu pandemic and an influenza scare.
[2:33:01.520 --> 2:33:10.520]  Both to sell billions of dollars worth of needless, dangerous vaccines to a dumbed down brainwashed public.
[2:33:10.520 --> 2:33:13.520]  Is it about eugenics? Yes.
[2:33:13.520 --> 2:33:17.520]  Eugenics 101 is to kill off the sick and elderly.
[2:33:17.520 --> 2:33:20.520]  Is it about money? Of course.
[2:33:20.520 --> 2:33:29.520]  In the U.S. alone, based on two shots per person, the vaccine manufacturers are making over $13 billion a year,
[2:33:29.520 --> 2:33:32.520]  paid for by taxpayer dollars.
[2:33:32.520 --> 2:33:35.520]  The manufacturers have no liability.
[2:33:35.520 --> 2:33:39.520]  They cannot be held accountable for any deaths or injury.
[2:33:39.520 --> 2:33:47.520]  They will only profit more by selling drugs to everyone that they've injured with their experimental vaccines.
[2:33:47.520 --> 2:33:51.520]  Is it a big experiment? Absolutely.
[2:33:51.520 --> 2:33:54.520]  And there is no shortage of suckers and fools.
[2:33:54.520 --> 2:33:58.520]  Millions are willingly lining up for the mystery injection,
[2:33:58.520 --> 2:34:06.520]  proudly boasting their compliance and ignorance for all the world to see on social media.
[2:34:06.520 --> 2:34:09.520]  But is it all voluntary?
[2:34:09.520 --> 2:34:17.520]  In recent years, Big Pharma has been pushing for vaccines to self-spread to non-vaccinated individuals.
[2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:24.520]  They claim to already have this technology and have discussed using it on the public covertly.
[2:34:24.520 --> 2:34:34.520]  One application considered was an anti-fertility vaccine that could be administered to human women without their knowledge.
[2:34:34.520 --> 2:34:41.520]  A recent Pfizer study describes the potential for their COVID vaccine to cause adverse effects in pregnant women
[2:34:41.520 --> 2:34:47.520]  who come into close contact with recently vaccinated individuals.
[2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:54.520]  And we have seen thousands of women reporting abnormal menstrual cycles, miscarriages and blood clots
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:35:00.520]  after coming into contact with the vaccinated.
[2:35:00.520 --> 2:35:08.520]  Former chief science officer for Pfizer said that he thinks vaccines will be used for mass depopulation.
[2:35:08.520 --> 2:35:14.520]  If this is being done to us deliberately, obviously we wouldn't be told.
[2:35:14.520 --> 2:35:18.520]  Bill Gates doesn't think you deserve to know what's in the vaccine.
[2:35:18.520 --> 2:35:26.520]  There's been some speculation that the changing intellectual property rules and allowing these vaccines, as you say,
[2:35:26.520 --> 2:35:32.520]  the recipe for these vaccines to be shared would be helpful. And do you think that would be helpful?
[2:35:32.520 --> 2:35:33.520]  No.
[2:35:33.520 --> 2:35:38.520]  And the inserts are dubiously left blank on purpose.
[2:35:38.520 --> 2:35:59.520]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:15.520]  From Canada to the Midwest, to Houston, to refine the oil that's then turned into gas, except for the East Coast.
[2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:20.520]  That's right, Joe Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline right after it was completed.
[2:36:20.520 --> 2:36:25.520]  Joe Biden did that to America. He has the history. He has the background.
[2:36:25.520 --> 2:36:28.520]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels.
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:32.520]  He's the one that's tried to extend the lockdowns of the country.
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:39.520]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world, and they want the United States, Europe, and Australia crippled,
[2:36:39.520 --> 2:36:43.520]  so Communist China can be dominant. It's not Russia that's the enemy.
[2:36:43.520 --> 2:36:50.520]  It's Communist China and their millions like Joe Biden in control of the White House. That's the facts. That's the information.
[2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:53.520]  Gerald in South Carolina. Go ahead. You're on the air trying to move quicker.
[2:36:53.520 --> 2:36:54.520]  Hey, Alex.
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:55.520]  Welcome.
[2:36:55.520 --> 2:37:00.520]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[2:37:00.520 --> 2:37:03.520]  I want to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year. Okay.
[2:37:03.520 --> 2:37:09.520]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[2:37:09.520 --> 2:37:15.520]  Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:17.520]  Living defense brought me back.
[2:37:17.520 --> 2:37:22.520]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:34.520]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[2:37:34.520 --> 2:37:41.520]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at, brother.
[2:37:41.520 --> 2:37:51.520]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:56.520]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying,
[2:37:56.520 --> 2:38:00.520]  where are most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:02.520]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[2:38:02.520 --> 2:38:06.520]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[2:38:06.520 --> 2:38:09.520]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[2:38:09.520 --> 2:38:13.520]  That's why info wars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would be buying it.
[2:38:13.520 --> 2:38:16.520]  We have the money, but so many of them have been sold out.
[2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:22.520]  Just like you noticed, a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:29.520]  But finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen, deep earth crystal iodide, so essential in your body.
[2:38:29.520 --> 2:38:32.520]  It's really the missing link. It's 50% off.
[2:38:32.520 --> 2:38:35.520]  We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com.
[2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:41.520]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage of this now, stock up, and don't forget to take your X2.
[2:38:41.520 --> 2:38:48.520]  Because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself, but when I do stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[2:38:48.520 --> 2:38:51.520]  It's essential. It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[2:38:51.520 --> 2:38:58.520]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[2:38:58.520 --> 2:39:03.520]  In the near future, earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:39:03.520 --> 2:39:09.520]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:39:09.520 --> 2:39:12.520]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:39:12.520 --> 2:39:20.520]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:39:20.520 --> 2:39:25.520]  The globalist spear this film made 14 years ago. It is the blueprint for their plan to figure the world.
[2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:28.520]  It is the blueprint for the great reset. It is in-game.
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:35.520]  Blueprint for globalist slavemen available right now at infowarstore.com with a zero country code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[2:39:35.520 --> 2:39:39.520]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at infowarstore.com.
[2:39:39.520 --> 2:39:41.520]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it.
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:47.520]  And if you take that action, I demand you tell others you've given a copy too that they make copies and share it as well.
[2:39:47.520 --> 2:40:11.520]  It will trigger distribution by proxy meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[2:40:11.520 --> 2:40:19.520]  All right, the fourth hour when Paul Joseph Watson is going to be coming up and then the war room is going to be premiering today.
[2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:24.520]  The detailed special report won't be done until about the time Owen's show starts.
[2:40:24.520 --> 2:40:31.520]  It's going to be about 20 minutes long that documents even better than I've done in the last few hours,
[2:40:31.520 --> 2:40:47.520]  but just in a short concise piece on how the Wuhan virology director hired by Bill Gates and Fauci admitted to creating the five virus Corona COVID-19.
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:54.520]  In a TV interview and just everything surrounding it, Fauci testing vaccines to make sure it did kill similar mammals to us with blood clots.
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:40:58.520]  And now the mass of blood clots taking place. It's just insane.
[2:40:58.520 --> 2:41:01.520]  I'm going to hit some more news on that in a moment.
[2:41:01.520 --> 2:41:13.520]  But first, the prime suspect in the shutdown of the colonial pipeline that's now a national emergency is the globalists that run Joe Biden.
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:17.520]  They're the ones that shut our coal power plants off over a thousand.
[2:41:17.520 --> 2:41:23.520]  They're the ones that shut down our last lead smelting plants so we can't even make our own bullets.
[2:41:23.520 --> 2:41:31.520]  They're the ones that shut down the keystone pipeline, first thing he did on January 21st, one day in office.
[2:41:31.520 --> 2:41:39.520]  He'll shut down a $40 billion pipeline that was going to deliver two to $3 billion of oil a day to Houston refineries to be refined.
[2:41:39.520 --> 2:41:50.520]  If you look at the pipeline, it comes down out of the Midwest, out of Canada, and all those oil fields, you refine it in Houston, it goes back up the East Coast to the colonial pipeline.
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:54.520]  So they cut off the pipeline to the other pipeline.
[2:41:54.520 --> 2:42:00.520]  Well, of course they cut it off and now some nebulous groups says, oh, we're not political.
[2:42:00.520 --> 2:42:03.520]  We just want money.
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:06.520]  This is exactly what these James Bond villains do.
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:14.520]  And so now there are gas lines, there are gas outages all over, particularly the southeast and the northeast.
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:16.520]  And now this from CNN that's so excited.
[2:42:16.520 --> 2:42:24.520]  American Airlines has to add fuel stops after pipeline shutdown.
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:26.520]  Think about that.
[2:42:26.520 --> 2:42:30.520]  Pipeline outage force American Airlines to add stops to some long haul flights.
[2:42:30.520 --> 2:42:34.520]  Southwest flies in fuel.
[2:42:34.520 --> 2:42:37.520]  It's on ladies and gentlemen.
[2:42:37.520 --> 2:42:42.520]  That's why I told you a year ago I said it's going to collapse the first world.
[2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:47.520]  It's going to collapse all the just on time deliveries, the supply chain.
[2:42:47.520 --> 2:42:54.520]  It's going to put all the little companies out of business that service the infrastructure.
[2:42:54.520 --> 2:43:00.520]  Then only Apple and Google and Facebook and Twitter and big tech will survive servicing Amazon or Walmart.
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:06.520]  They'll all double and triple profits, which they've done because they have their own supply chain or own infrastructure.
[2:43:06.520 --> 2:43:08.520]  They're vertically integrated.
[2:43:08.520 --> 2:43:12.520]  So that's the great reset. That's what Schwab said they do.
[2:43:12.520 --> 2:43:14.520]  And now it's like, oh, you think you're going to reopen the country?
[2:43:14.520 --> 2:43:16.520]  Turn the pipeline off.
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:20.520]  Hackers did it. Yes, that they can never catch.
[2:43:20.520 --> 2:43:24.520]  Sure. Oh, that's why we need AI to run everything.
[2:43:24.520 --> 2:43:34.520]  So the whole planet's run by AI so the globalists have all the robots and combat droids and control the dams and all the switches and all the electrical and all the pumps and all the pipelines.
[2:43:34.520 --> 2:43:39.520]  The left one's pipeline shut down everywhere. Well, now they're just showing you, oh, nebulous hackers did it.
[2:43:39.520 --> 2:43:48.520]  Oh, and Russia's behind it with no evidence at all.
[2:43:48.520 --> 2:43:52.520]  But all over the country, no gas or big lines where there is gas.
[2:43:52.520 --> 2:43:55.520]  And I told you, there'll be almost no gas this summer.
[2:43:55.520 --> 2:43:59.520]  So you're going to stay put regardless. See how it works.
[2:43:59.520 --> 2:44:02.520]  Learning how that happens.
[2:44:02.520 --> 2:44:05.520]  What did I say when Biden stole the election January 20th?
[2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:09.520]  I said, get ready for pulling power outages and gas shortages.
[2:44:09.520 --> 2:44:13.520]  It's a plan. We're under military attack.
[2:44:13.520 --> 2:44:17.520]  You cut the power off from an enemy. You dissolve their borders.
[2:44:17.520 --> 2:44:22.520]  You bankrupt their treasury. You devalue it.
[2:44:22.520 --> 2:44:25.520]  People keep wondering, how does Jones know? I mean, I cut all those reports.
[2:44:25.520 --> 2:44:28.520]  I just said the power will be cut off one way or another.
[2:44:28.520 --> 2:44:33.520]  I said last week, they're going to claim hackers shut down gas pipelines.
[2:44:33.520 --> 2:44:36.520]  You go find the video.
[2:44:36.520 --> 2:44:38.520]  And people ask, how the hell do you know that?
[2:44:38.520 --> 2:44:40.520]  Because they wrote a big John Hopkins report.
[2:44:40.520 --> 2:44:44.520]  And Klaus Schwab says, next is going to be the hack attack.
[2:44:44.520 --> 2:44:48.520]  It'll be bigger than COVID. And the same damn people run that.
[2:44:48.520 --> 2:44:51.520]  This ain't hard.
[2:44:51.520 --> 2:44:57.520]  I'd give it about a 95% chance. The globalists did the pipeline show them.
[2:44:57.520 --> 2:45:01.520]  95% chance somebody got pissed. They shut down T-stone inside.
[2:45:01.520 --> 2:45:04.520]  And it's doing that to show everybody the dependence on pipelines.
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:07.520]  95% it's a globalist. 5% chance that I'm wrong.
[2:45:07.520 --> 2:45:11.520]  It was done by people pissed off with the keystone being shut down
[2:45:11.520 --> 2:45:13.520]  to show people how dependent we are.
[2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:16.520]  But see, that's in a logical world. You do that and then maybe people understand.
[2:45:16.520 --> 2:45:18.520]  But no, there's no logic here.
[2:45:18.520 --> 2:45:21.520]  The left want to be homeless. They want their children brain damaged.
[2:45:21.520 --> 2:45:25.520]  They want to be dead. Everybody I know that when they got the vaccine, had strokes or heart attacks.
[2:45:25.520 --> 2:45:27.520]  They love it, they tell me. Oh, their kids died.
[2:45:27.520 --> 2:45:31.520]  They're in the news. Oh, my kid died. It's a wonderful thing.
[2:45:31.520 --> 2:45:34.520]  It's a happy thing.
[2:45:34.520 --> 2:45:38.520]  That's how all this crap works, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:45:38.520 --> 2:45:45.520]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on from there.
[2:45:45.520 --> 2:45:48.520]  Hey, guys, I just hit my wireless headset and knocked my audio off.
[2:45:48.520 --> 2:45:52.520]  And I forget how this works. It's got a lot of settings.
[2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:57.520]  Somebody come in here and just take this little beauty for me and punch it up where it works.
[2:45:57.520 --> 2:46:00.520]  Thank you so much.
[2:46:00.520 --> 2:46:04.520]  Now, it's right there on the other table. Just try to bring it to you if you'd like.
[2:46:04.520 --> 2:46:05.520]  Just right over there. Thank you.
[2:46:05.520 --> 2:46:13.520]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we are here fighting the new world order as hard as we can.
[2:46:13.520 --> 2:46:15.520]  And we can't do it without your support.
[2:46:15.520 --> 2:46:22.520]  And I sell you things that I know that you really, really, really, really need.
[2:46:22.520 --> 2:46:26.520]  And so we go out and get the best horrible food company with the highest quality for the lowest price.
[2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:29.520]  We get it ready for, but you're breaking on to me. Thank you. Appreciate that.
[2:46:29.520 --> 2:46:32.520]  And thank you, sir.
[2:46:32.520 --> 2:46:40.520]  And we bring you those products so we can get money to stay on air and sell you something you need.
[2:46:40.520 --> 2:46:43.520]  It's called symbiotic relationship, a 360-win and non-zero-sum game.
[2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:50.520]  It's how we operate. And so you've got 2020 prices until tomorrow night.
[2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:52.520]  And then it's going to go to its regular price. It's still a great deal.
[2:46:52.520 --> 2:46:56.520]  And they've told me in the next two weeks or so, they're going to have to go up in price.
[2:46:56.520 --> 2:47:00.520]  So you're not just going to not get the sale. You're going to have to go up in price because the whole thing is shutting down
[2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:06.520]  and the supply chains are breaking down and the pipelines are being turned off because we're under attack.
[2:47:06.520 --> 2:47:12.520]  And because governors have demanded things reopened and because we've got some patriots, the globalists aren't going to stop.
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:17.520]  They want the whole system shut down.
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:24.520]  They want it shut down now so your bankruptcy, you go on universal guaranteed income, which won't buy you anything.
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:29.520]  Less people working, more scarcity, less products, more money chasing it.
[2:47:29.520 --> 2:47:31.520]  You're under economic attack.
[2:47:31.520 --> 2:47:37.520]  And until you blame Biden and the globalists of the New World Order and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, they're going to keep doing it.
[2:47:37.520 --> 2:47:41.520]  They've learned they can attack you and you don't even know what hit you.
[2:47:41.520 --> 2:47:43.520]  You can have 2,000 dead in Chicago.
[2:47:43.520 --> 2:47:45.520]  They don't talk about that, but five die over here.
[2:47:45.520 --> 2:47:53.520]  We've got to take your guns because the death of logic where we say that men are women and women are men and we're going to cut little boys genitals off
[2:47:53.520 --> 2:47:54.520]  and it's liberal.
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:48:02.520]  It's not male genital mutilation or female genital mutilation because they think we have no sense.
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:05.520]  They're assaulting us. They're attacking us.
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:08.520]  So thank you all for your support.
[2:48:08.520 --> 2:48:15.520]  I know my Patriots are smart. They've expanded out even once the COVID fear went by because they knew it's going to cause a global breakdown.
[2:48:15.520 --> 2:48:23.520]  They've massively expanded and I predict in the future we're going to get to a point where there's going to be lines around the street to get food just like the gas.
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:25.520]  So just do what's smart.
[2:48:25.520 --> 2:48:30.520]  Go to mfoarstore.com or pharaohdallas.com and get a three month, get a six month, get a year.
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:32.520]  This is what I've chosen for my family.
[2:48:32.520 --> 2:48:36.520]  Get their Alexa Pure water filtration portable for streams, rivers, lakes.
[2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:37.520]  Everybody needs them.
[2:48:37.520 --> 2:48:39.520]  I'm getting more storeable food for the office.
[2:48:39.520 --> 2:48:40.520]  I'm getting more at my house.
[2:48:40.520 --> 2:48:42.520]  I ordered more last week.
[2:48:42.520 --> 2:48:48.520]  I told my wife to get all the little delectable canned goods and things that save and some of the gourmet storeable foods as well.
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:50.520]  Just get ready.
[2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:52.520]  And my parents have got a trailer out a little ranch.
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:49:02.520]  I've got a little solar and all the stuff that's gone in and I got to get a little shack or something for me too because it's going to be like Road Warrior if we don't turn this around.
[2:49:02.520 --> 2:49:05.520]  And there's not much time left.
[2:49:05.520 --> 2:49:11.520]  So mfoarstore.com or pharaohdallas.com takes you right to the sub page to find that 10% off.
[2:49:11.520 --> 2:49:14.520]  It'll still be a great deal once the deal is over on Thursday.
[2:49:14.520 --> 2:49:16.520]  And separately, turbo force.
[2:49:16.520 --> 2:49:17.520]  We tried to put in a big order.
[2:49:17.520 --> 2:49:21.520]  Couldn't get the big order we wanted because of supply chain problems because of the high quality ingredients we use.
[2:49:21.520 --> 2:49:23.520]  Packaging issues, ingredient issues.
[2:49:23.520 --> 2:49:24.520]  We got a limited supply.
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:25.520]  Still 40% off.
[2:49:25.520 --> 2:49:26.520]  That's going to end in a few days.

[2:49:48.520 --> 2:49:49.520]  1776.
[2:49:49.520 --> 2:49:53.520]  And you notice I brought on some more sponsors too.
[2:49:53.520 --> 2:50:01.520]  Because like the sat phone are great folks and others because and now a gold sponsor because we can't get enough supplements to pay the bills.
[2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:05.520]  We used to be able to pay the bills selling supplements and T-shirts in a few books.
[2:50:05.520 --> 2:50:10.520]  You can't get half the damn supplements anymore because there's a fricking supply chain right now all over the world.
[2:50:10.520 --> 2:50:12.520]  And now the fuel's running out.
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:14.520]  I don't just tell you this for fun.
[2:50:14.520 --> 2:50:18.520]  I don't just tell you they launched an attack from Lulon so the FBI puts me in jail.
[2:50:18.520 --> 2:50:20.520]  Do you think I want to die?
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:22.520]  Do you think I like the feds following me around?
[2:50:22.520 --> 2:50:25.520]  No, but I got to do this because these are killers.
[2:50:25.520 --> 2:50:27.520]  So tell everybody you know about the show.
[2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:30.520]  Tell everybody about other broadcasts and tell the truth.
[2:50:30.520 --> 2:50:33.520]  And all you idiots and big tech to sign on to all this Satanism.
[2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:34.520]  Your fools.
[2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:35.520]  It's never too late to turn back though.
[2:50:35.520 --> 2:50:37.520]  We'll be right back with hour number four.
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:41.520]  The best product.
[2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:43.520]  I'm not supposed to be biased but I'm going to tell you all now.
[2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:45.520]  If you haven't tried Turboforce you need to try it.
[2:50:45.520 --> 2:50:47.520]  I've tried Turboforce with everything.
[2:50:47.520 --> 2:50:49.520]  Sometimes you know I went a little bit crazy.
[2:50:49.520 --> 2:50:51.520]  I put Turboforce in my coffee.
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:52.520]  That was a crazy week.
[2:50:52.520 --> 2:50:56.520]  I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go Turboforce is my favorite.
[2:50:56.520 --> 2:51:00.520]  All the Infowars products are down to take control of your life, take control of your health.
[2:51:00.520 --> 2:51:03.520]  Not relying on other people to do it for you.
[2:51:03.520 --> 2:51:09.520]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:10.520]  I'm going to wake up today.
[2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:11.520]  You know what?
[2:51:11.520 --> 2:51:15.520]  I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[2:51:15.520 --> 2:51:17.520]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[2:51:17.520 --> 2:51:18.520]  I don't think that happens very often.
[2:51:18.520 --> 2:51:19.520]  It's never happened to me.
[2:51:19.520 --> 2:51:22.520]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[2:51:22.520 --> 2:51:24.520]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[2:51:24.520 --> 2:51:27.520]  There's only one person who woke up in front of that and that was me.
[2:51:27.520 --> 2:51:28.520]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:30.520]  Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[2:51:30.520 --> 2:51:33.520]  I want to take control of my health and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[2:51:33.520 --> 2:51:35.520]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[2:51:35.520 --> 2:51:36.520]  Don't buy into the group thing.
[2:51:36.520 --> 2:51:37.520]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[2:51:37.520 --> 2:51:38.520]  Drink the Turboforce.
[2:51:38.520 --> 2:51:41.520]  Kool-Aid's bad and the Turboforce is good.

[2:51:59.520 --> 2:52:05.520]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does and it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[2:52:05.520 --> 2:52:07.520]  This is also clean fish oil.
[2:52:07.520 --> 2:52:10.520]  It's been sold out for months but it's back in stock 50% off.
[2:52:10.520 --> 2:52:13.520]  Grill Oil is set to sell out and it's amazing as well.

[2:53:14.520 --> 2:53:17.520]  But I mean these are just wild times.
[2:53:17.520 --> 2:53:24.520]  Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over here in five minutes and he always does a great job.
[2:53:24.520 --> 2:53:30.520]  And then as I told you, Owen Troyer is going to be hosting three hours of the war room today.
[2:53:30.520 --> 2:53:32.520]  And so much is breaking.
[2:53:32.520 --> 2:53:36.520]  We have so many documents about the globalist planning cyber attacks on infrastructure.
[2:53:36.520 --> 2:53:39.520]  It's another way to bring down society in the post-industrial world.
[2:53:39.520 --> 2:53:41.520]  How do you think they're going to do it?
[2:53:41.520 --> 2:53:48.520]  They're going to do it and say hackers and terrorists did it and then give themselves more power to respond to the crisis they created.
[2:53:48.520 --> 2:53:53.520]  Now, we have been funding ourselves with other great products.
[2:53:53.520 --> 2:54:02.520]  And thank God I started working with other companies over the last few years wanting to diversify how we fund ourselves because of deplatforming and other issues.
[2:54:02.520 --> 2:54:08.520]  But now the supply chain is broken down so bad it's really hard to get the high quality ingredients we put in our supplements.
[2:54:08.520 --> 2:54:15.520]  So because we don't cut back the quality of the supplements, a lot of them aren't available anymore or we get limited supplies of them.
[2:54:15.520 --> 2:54:21.520]  As you've been seeing up to half our products are either discontinued because we can't get them or we go five, six, seven months without having it.
[2:54:21.520 --> 2:54:24.520]  Hopefully DNA force will be done and come in soon.
[2:54:24.520 --> 2:54:27.520]  But we're still waiting on that.
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:31.520]  Now, this is a story that really has gone on for five years.
[2:54:31.520 --> 2:54:36.520]  It's been two years in earnest and then about six months ago I threw a fit over it.
[2:54:36.520 --> 2:54:38.520]  And now we finally have it.
[2:54:38.520 --> 2:54:41.520]  So I'm going to tell you about this right now and it's very, very exciting.
[2:54:41.520 --> 2:54:43.520]  Well, I say exciting extremely so.
[2:54:43.520 --> 2:54:50.520]  I happen to know a petroleum engineer and some other engineers.
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:55:05.520]  And I learned five years ago that at the industrial level, they had the patent and everything on delivery system and on naturally occurring bacteria that they breed that eats oil, garbage, anything.
[2:55:05.520 --> 2:55:15.520]  And that they were talking about deploying it for people, septic tanks and other things like RVs and, you know, boat, toilet systems, drains, everything.
[2:55:15.520 --> 2:55:18.520]  And so I tried to get them to do it for years.
[2:55:18.520 --> 2:55:24.520]  And finally they did it, but then got the facility together to sell it to consumers.
[2:55:24.520 --> 2:55:34.520]  They sell it to oil companies and to pig farms to eat, you know, those big slurries they have and all the pig feces and urine and all the rest of them just eat through it.
[2:55:34.520 --> 2:55:38.520]  And then it wasn't big enough business for them to do it.
[2:55:38.520 --> 2:55:42.520]  Well, I finally twisted arms, took them two years to do it, and they're great folks.
[2:55:42.520 --> 2:55:45.520]  This is the first time this is available to the public.
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:49.520]  We launched it yesterday with a soft launch, not my product, but we're promoting it.
[2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:52.520]  And they're a huge sponsor for us.
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:56:10.520]  We had over 10,000 visits to the website that maybe you guys can run the b-roll in the background, biosepticpro.com and the bio pros.
[2:56:10.520 --> 2:56:14.520]  And what I wanted to just hit here for you.
[2:56:14.520 --> 2:56:18.520]  I'm just going to play one of the one minute ads here in the last minute.
[2:56:18.520 --> 2:56:25.520]  Is we had over 10,000 people visit the site yesterday, but we only had like 100 that bought it because they don't even know that it's affiliated with us.
[2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:26.520]  This is a real product.
[2:56:26.520 --> 2:56:27.520]  It's amazing.
[2:56:27.520 --> 2:56:28.520]  It's incredible.
[2:56:28.520 --> 2:56:29.520]  It was hard to get to market.
[2:56:29.520 --> 2:56:39.520]  We got it to you, the consumer, and it's available at info wars store.com in the future.
[2:56:39.520 --> 2:56:47.520]  But right now at bioseptic pros and we'll put that up for you at the bio pros.com.
[2:56:47.520 --> 2:56:50.520]  And again, I don't even have the, I mean, I've just done all this myself.
[2:56:50.520 --> 2:56:53.520]  I'm not bitching, but I mean, I don't even have the hard copy here to even launch this myself.
[2:56:53.520 --> 2:56:55.520]  I just have to extract it, do it, do it all.
[2:56:55.520 --> 2:56:56.520]  I'm not bitching.
[2:56:56.520 --> 2:56:58.520]  It's just that's the insane asylum I live in around here.
[2:56:58.520 --> 2:56:59.520]  And it's okay.
[2:56:59.520 --> 2:57:02.520]  But they're telling me, hey, that's the wrong URL.
[2:57:02.520 --> 2:57:04.520]  Well, I don't have anything that tells me that.
[2:57:04.520 --> 2:57:05.520]  That's my life here.
[2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:06.520]  So, but I love it.
[2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:07.520]  It's okay.
[2:57:07.520 --> 2:57:09.520]  Watson is going to take over.
[2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:11.520]  I was trying to cut an ad for this live on air, but that didn't work.
[2:57:11.520 --> 2:57:12.520]  Doesn't matter.
[2:57:12.520 --> 2:57:13.520]  We're fighting hard.
[2:57:13.520 --> 2:57:14.520]  Great news is coming out.
[2:57:14.520 --> 2:57:15.520]  It's all very important.
[2:57:15.520 --> 2:57:17.520]  And so that's that.
[2:57:17.520 --> 2:57:19.520]  And that's you're going to burn in hell.
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:21.520]  And so is Bill Gates, all the rest of them.
[2:57:21.520 --> 2:57:25.520]  And like I said, I'm going to shoot a report on the pipeline and all the rest of it and
[2:57:25.520 --> 2:57:26.520]  everything else.
[2:57:26.520 --> 2:57:27.520]  But this is really amazing.
[2:57:27.520 --> 2:57:31.520]  It's like a hundred times better in studies they've done than the enzymes you put in your
[2:57:31.520 --> 2:57:32.520]  septic tank.
[2:57:32.520 --> 2:57:35.520]  And so it's really, really revolutionary and we're very, very excited about it.
[2:57:35.520 --> 2:57:37.520]  And it's going to help fund the info war.
[2:57:37.520 --> 2:57:43.520]  So this is true Americana, ladies and gentlemen, and it's badass and it's non GMO.
[2:57:43.520 --> 2:57:46.520]  And like I said, someday I'll be able to give you the URL someday, probably not ever.
[2:57:46.520 --> 2:57:49.520]  All right, we'll be right back.
[2:57:49.520 --> 2:57:53.520]  I'm driving home at seven o'clock at night on Monday night to see my family.
[2:57:53.520 --> 2:57:58.520]  And I just remember there's only two days left for our wonderful listeners to get incredibly
[2:57:58.520 --> 2:58:03.520]  high quality, affordable food at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere at preparewithalix.com.
[2:58:03.520 --> 2:58:08.520]  These are 20, 20 prices for a limited time for our listeners.
[2:58:08.520 --> 2:58:11.520]  And then the price isn't just going to go back to regular, you should have to go up.
[2:58:11.520 --> 2:58:15.520]  Everybody else has already raised prices way more than my Patreon.
[2:58:15.520 --> 2:58:21.520]  We have their entire spectrum and catalog at infowarstore.com, preparewithalix.com.
[2:58:21.520 --> 2:58:27.520]  You get an additional 10% off on three months, six months, your supplies and everything else
[2:58:27.520 --> 2:58:28.520]  on the site.
[2:58:28.520 --> 2:58:30.520]  Preparewithalix.com.
[2:58:30.520 --> 2:58:35.520]  I would take advantage of this with what's happening in food price increases around the world.
[2:58:35.520 --> 2:58:40.520]  I predict that by the fall you're going to see major shortages and you're going to see huge price increases.
[2:58:40.520 --> 2:58:45.520]  I think it's a smart bet right now to get high quality, affordable food at last year's prices
[2:58:45.520 --> 2:59:08.520]  while you still can at preparewithalix.com.
[2:59:08.520 --> 2:59:28.520]  I'm going to get into big breaking news over in France where to be honest France could become
[2:59:28.520 --> 2:59:35.520]  the first European country to resemble the third world style failed state as a result
[2:59:35.520 --> 2:59:41.520]  of a complete failure to integrate mass hordes of mainly Islamist immigrants and of course
[2:59:41.520 --> 2:59:47.520]  the quote anti racism movement with which seeks to tear down everything that makes France
[2:59:47.520 --> 2:59:51.520]  France its entire identity in a bid to dissolve the country.
[2:59:51.520 --> 2:59:57.520]  That's not why I'm saying that's what top military active service members are saying
[2:59:57.520 --> 2:59:59.520]  right now in France.
[2:59:59.520 --> 3:00:05.520]  We had an initial letter which was signed by 20 retired generals a couple of weeks ago
[3:00:05.520 --> 3:00:07.520]  which we featured here on this broadcast.
[3:00:07.520 --> 3:00:12.520]  Now that was followed up by active duty members of the French military people who have fought
[3:00:12.520 --> 3:00:19.520]  in the most hardcore destinations locations in the world against Islamist militants coming
[3:00:19.520 --> 3:00:24.520]  out and saying that France is being subsumed its national identity is being crucified on
[3:00:24.520 --> 3:00:30.520]  the altar of globalism on the altar of political correctness on the altar of anti racism.
[3:00:30.520 --> 3:00:34.520]  And basically the government responded by saying they're going to be investigated they're going
[3:00:34.520 --> 3:00:38.520]  to be court martial they're going to be named shamed and humiliated.
[3:00:38.520 --> 3:00:43.520]  So we're going to get into that and the backlash from that what it truly means in the next
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:49.520]  segment but first we're going to start off with the gracious announcement and again I'm
[3:00:49.520 --> 3:00:56.520]  so grateful to the government for allowing us yes wait for it wait for it from Monday
[3:00:56.520 --> 3:01:03.520]  the 17th of May this coming Monday the British government has said that they will allow us
[3:01:03.520 --> 3:01:11.520]  they will permit us to hug our own family members and this apparently is a great revelation
[3:01:11.520 --> 3:01:17.520]  to many people who if you believe it haven't hugged their own family members or friends
[3:01:17.520 --> 3:01:23.520]  for over a year even though the government literally never outlined that it was a rule
[3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:28.520]  or a law that you weren't allowed to hug your family member or your friend even during
[3:01:28.520 --> 3:01:35.520]  the harshest coronavirus lockdown period apparently now it was a law even though it wasn't
[3:01:35.520 --> 3:01:41.520]  and the government is giving us yet another juicy carrot because we've been so well behaved
[3:01:41.520 --> 3:01:48.520]  we've obeyed their every pedantic mandate to the T the opinion polls show that 80% plus
[3:01:48.520 --> 3:01:54.520]  of the British public support all the lockdowns they say the lockdowns weren't harsh enough
[3:01:54.520 --> 3:01:59.520]  maybe we should have been put under literal house arrest with GPS electronic tagging bracelets
[3:01:59.520 --> 3:02:06.520]  attached to our legs literally there was a poll which said that 20% of the public wanted
[3:02:06.520 --> 3:02:14.520]  that but the government will allow us to hug our friends and family from Monday because
[3:02:14.520 --> 3:02:19.520]  apparently nobody's even seen their friends and family for the best part of the year
[3:02:19.520 --> 3:02:26.520]  aside from the few months that they graciously afforded us in summer absolutely incredible
[3:02:26.520 --> 3:02:30.520]  what's more chilling is not the fact that the government and now the state broadcasted
[3:02:30.520 --> 3:02:36.520]  the BBC which I'm going to get onto in a minute is openly describing how when in what scenario
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:41.520]  in what way you can hug your own family member that's not the most chilling aspect of it the
[3:02:41.520 --> 3:02:49.520]  most chilling aspect of it is the fact that millions of Brits will have refrained from
[3:02:49.520 --> 3:02:55.520]  hugging their own family members inside their own houses because the government said it
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:03:00.520]  wasn't allowed or because the media hinted it wasn't allowed even though they never even
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:10.520]  made that rule in the first place absolutely incredible can you imagine parents whose kids
[3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:16.520]  are whatever away at university maybe working in a different city who they haven't seen
[3:03:16.520 --> 3:03:22.520]  for the best part of the year actually making the decision to not hug their own children
[3:03:22.520 --> 3:03:29.520]  because the pedantic conservative government conserved in name only government said that
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:35.520]  it was not allowed while wearing their face masks which the coronavirus particle itself
[3:03:35.520 --> 3:03:41.520]  is a thousand times smaller than the face mask while obeying all these rules you'd be
[3:03:41.520 --> 3:03:47.520]  surprised how many people have obeyed these rules going to get into a couple of clips
[3:03:47.520 --> 3:03:53.520]  here the headline from the article on summit.news is government doctors warn Brits against hugging
[3:03:53.520 --> 3:03:58.520]  even after restrictions lifted oh yeah all the restrictions are supposed to be lifted on
[3:03:58.520 --> 3:04:03.520]  June 21st by the way even though they've literally said in two dozen different scenarios
[3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:09.520]  context none of the restrictions will be lifted it's been BS from the start the government
[3:04:09.520 --> 3:04:13.520]  and medical experts are urging Brits to be cautious when hugging other people even after
[3:04:13.520 --> 3:04:20.520]  lockdown measures are eased next week from May 17th Brits will be permitted by the government
[3:04:20.520 --> 3:04:28.520]  in all the gracious infinite wisdom to meet with a total of six people indoors six people
[3:04:28.520 --> 3:04:32.520]  however despite being legally allowed to congregate inside for the first time in nearly six months
[3:04:32.520 --> 3:04:37.520]  rules on close contact and hugging have remained largely undefined they were never defined in
[3:04:37.520 --> 3:04:44.520]  the first place let's go to the first clip which is a doctor Dr. Hillary Jones Dr.
[3:04:44.520 --> 3:04:51.520]  Hillary Jones as he's also known on one of Britain's most watched morning TV shows Good
[3:04:51.520 --> 3:04:57.520]  Morning Britain saying that people still need to be cautious about hugging one another even
[3:04:57.520 --> 3:05:03.520]  though there are virtually now zero COVID deaths on a day-to-day basis in the United Kingdom
[3:05:03.520 --> 3:05:10.520]  let's go to the first clip Dr. Hillary Jones here it is the increased risk of transmission
[3:05:10.520 --> 3:05:15.520]  oh I mean biologically it's quite substantial if you're in hugging range you're touching
[3:05:15.520 --> 3:05:21.520]  somebody in your your face is right next to theirs you're going to be breathing the breath
[3:05:21.520 --> 3:05:26.520]  that they're exhaling the virus is transmitted through aerosol droplets so the risk is much
[3:05:26.520 --> 3:05:34.520]  higher now Professor Noakes has said she's part of SAGE the the the group for for emergencies
[3:05:34.520 --> 3:05:39.520]  scientific advisory group she's saying that actually she's worried that she's saying that
[3:05:39.520 --> 3:05:44.520]  hugs should be selective they should be short they should be selective rather hug your children
[3:05:44.520 --> 3:05:49.520]  hug your grandchildren not promiscuous hugs we're not talking about here not hugging everybody
[3:05:49.520 --> 3:05:57.520]  why did he look at you every time you turn to me in a conversation there was absolutely
[3:05:57.520 --> 3:06:01.520]  no other reason I do like a cuddle and occasionally the sniff of a neck just to check someone's
[3:06:01.520 --> 3:06:05.520]  signature scent there you go but it could be more dangerous than you know just keeping
[3:06:05.520 --> 3:06:12.520]  a distance and being sensible but no it's great hugs actually have a benefit they have a
[3:06:12.520 --> 3:06:17.520]  benefit in health in terms of you forget the aerosol transmission of viruses for a moment
[3:06:17.520 --> 3:06:22.520]  there's all sorts of things that happen so you release oxytocin that we talked about earlier
[3:06:22.520 --> 3:06:26.520]  these are the these are the comforting I'm happy talking about hugging just not actual
[3:06:26.520 --> 3:06:32.520]  yeah yeah so the happy hormones are released you feel more relaxed you feel calm anxiety
[3:06:32.520 --> 3:06:38.520]  diminishes depression diminishes so getting close and touching is something that a lot
[3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:45.520]  of people have touched deprived in our society we live in these isolated bubbles and the
[3:06:45.520 --> 3:06:49.520]  showing of human affection through touch and through a hug is actually very beneficial
[3:06:49.520 --> 3:06:54.520]  in most circumstances but right now it might be a mistake because we've got these new
[3:06:54.520 --> 3:06:59.520]  variants we've still got 2000 in fact cases that we know about every day probably a lot
[3:06:59.520 --> 3:07:09.520]  more that we're not testing for so it is still time to be cautious so you notice that we
[3:07:09.520 --> 3:07:16.520]  went from back in March 2020 three weeks to protect the NHS they said we just need to
[3:07:16.520 --> 3:07:20.520]  lock down for three weeks maybe a month to protect the NHS stop it being overwhelmed
[3:07:20.520 --> 3:07:27.520]  fast forward 14 15 months later and it's literally the government and the state
[3:07:27.520 --> 3:07:34.520]  broadcaster which I'm going to get on to defining how and when you can hug your own family
[3:07:34.520 --> 3:07:39.520]  members within your own private residence that's how far we've come and this is supposed to
[3:07:39.520 --> 3:07:44.520]  be in an environment when restrictions are being eased they're literally telling you
[3:07:44.520 --> 3:07:49.520]  how you can hug your friends and family inside your own home and they do the polls and 80%
[3:07:49.520 --> 3:07:56.520]  the public says yes that's completely reasonable why I'm even talking about it when the vast
[3:07:56.520 --> 3:08:02.520]  majority of the population love being told by the state when and how they can hug their
[3:08:02.520 --> 3:08:08.520]  own family members then notice you get the example you saw there with a female presenter
[3:08:08.520 --> 3:08:12.520]  and many of the op-eds that have been written in these papers over the past few days of
[3:08:12.520 --> 3:08:18.520]  people saying oh I always hated hugging people anyway so this is good this is government
[3:08:18.520 --> 3:08:22.520]  this is good that the government tells us that we can't properly hug our own family members
[3:08:22.520 --> 3:08:28.520]  yet yeah they're psychopaths they're sociopaths who hate humanity who hate themselves that's
[3:08:28.520 --> 3:08:33.520]  why they hate hugging people they don't want any close contact they've loved this entire
[3:08:33.520 --> 3:08:38.520]  lockdown throughout the whole gamut of it and they want it to continue indefinitely
[3:08:38.520 --> 3:09:02.520]  we're going to get onto that in the next segment summit.news.go away we'll be right back.
[3:09:02.520 --> 3:09:09.520]  So I get to see things that the republic doesn't get to see and let me tell you whether it's
[3:09:09.520 --> 3:09:13.520]  police chiefs or members of congress or even folks in hollywood or mainstream media or industry
[3:09:13.520 --> 3:09:19.520]  people are really really away from the establishment they don't want to go along with the globalists
[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:25.520]  but they're scared they're looking for leadership well that's where m4 comes in you fund us you
[3:09:25.520 --> 3:09:30.520]  support m4.com you get great products at the same time we will then go out and do what the
[3:09:30.520 --> 3:09:35.520]  globalists say is unpopular but the globalist is targeting for to show people that it's safe
[3:09:35.520 --> 3:09:41.520]  to tell the truth and to take the heat that's our job so please keep us on air so we can
[3:09:41.520 --> 3:09:47.520]  hit the barbed wire so we can meet the shock groups and the information war fund us at m4store.com
[3:09:47.520 --> 3:09:53.520]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something
[3:09:53.520 --> 3:09:57.520]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[3:09:57.520 --> 3:10:02.520]  the years it is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you the
[3:10:02.520 --> 3:10:06.520]  listeners of this show I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you whether you are
[3:10:06.520 --> 3:10:10.520]  old whether you are Hispanic white black it doesn't matter you've got red blood and if you
[3:10:10.520 --> 3:10:15.520]  love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children we are brothers and sisters
[3:10:15.520 --> 3:10:20.520]  together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years and
[3:10:20.520 --> 3:10:26.520]  it's crazier things are I want to keep working into the future but again that's really up to
[3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:32.520]  you and up to God so please I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to
[3:10:32.520 --> 3:10:36.520]  support us but again that's up to you and your relationship with God I just want to thank you
[3:10:36.520 --> 3:10:40.520]  all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done and just ask you again to
[3:10:40.520 --> 3:10:45.520]  pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully God will touch your heart to
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:11:01.520]  continue to support us God bless you're listening to the Alex Jones show you're listening to the
[3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:11.520]  summit dot news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson can you imagine if they'd have conducted a
[3:11:11.520 --> 3:11:16.520]  call around 18 months ago asking the British public do you think the government should have
[3:11:16.520 --> 3:11:22.520]  the right should have the power to decide how many people are allowed to enter your home as
[3:11:22.520 --> 3:11:29.520]  guests or how you're allowed to behave around them in terms of physical embracing in terms of
[3:11:29.520 --> 3:11:35.520]  hugging I would hope that that would literally be 99% who would say no that's that's a
[3:11:35.520 --> 3:11:42.520]  totally abusive power that's totalitarianism oh but the coronavirus happened we had polls after
[3:11:42.520 --> 3:11:48.520]  that as recently as last summer which found that the average Brit thought coronavirus
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:55.520]  had killed 225 times more people than it actually did and that's why there's now a complete flip
[3:11:55.520 --> 3:12:02.520]  and 80% of people support these kind of ridiculous absurd totalitarian measures because they've
[3:12:02.520 --> 3:12:08.520]  been so terrorized for the past 15 months with the idea that this virus is literally laying
[3:12:08.520 --> 3:12:16.520]  waste to the population when for example I'm going to get offered the jab the vaccine within the
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:22.520]  next couple of weeks they're offering it to over 35s the next couple of weeks now I'm not
[3:12:22.520 --> 3:12:28.520]  taking it I've got a greater risk of being killed by the blood clot I have a chance of getting
[3:12:28.520 --> 3:12:36.520]  from the vaccine than coronavirus itself so no I'm not taking your vaccine ever I don't care
[3:12:36.520 --> 3:12:42.520]  what kind of restrictions you impose on people who don't take it now of course we have basically
[3:12:42.520 --> 3:12:50.520]  the coronavirus tax which is you have to pay for these PCR tests which are notoriously unreliable
[3:12:50.520 --> 3:12:56.520]  to leave the country to go on holiday for example in my case to visit my parents in Spain
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:13:04.520]  upwards of 150 pounds per test so again that is a tax on people who don't take the vaccine
[3:13:04.520 --> 3:13:10.520]  it's not about encouraging people to take the vaccine we had a clip last week of Trevor Noah
[3:13:10.520 --> 3:13:16.520]  expressing his amazement at how people were being discouraged from taking the vaccine because
[3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:22.520]  in America they're still telling people who take the vaccine to wear their masks to maintain
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:26.520]  social distancing that they will still be tested for coronavirus that they will still
[3:13:26.520 --> 3:13:30.520]  have all the same restrictions imposed on them even if they've taken the vaccine it was
[3:13:30.520 --> 3:13:37.520]  never about encouraging more people to take the vaccine it was about punishing and identifying
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:45.520]  and segregating the people who refuse to take the vaccine and why that is is a whole different
[3:13:45.520 --> 3:13:50.520]  debate but it gets very interesting when you see when you learn about some of these side
[3:13:50.520 --> 3:13:58.520]  effects that young women are having as a result of this vaccine in particular
[3:13:58.520 --> 3:14:02.520]  meanwhile we literally have the government and the state broadcaster here in the UK telling us
[3:14:02.520 --> 3:14:08.520]  that we can't hug our own family members or if we do we have to be very cautious about it
[3:14:08.520 --> 3:14:16.520]  absolutely absurd to the end degree. Delling Paul writes for Breitbart BBC expert gives
[3:14:16.520 --> 3:14:22.520]  advice on how to hug safely so it's not just the government it's the state broadcaster
[3:14:22.520 --> 3:14:28.520]  remember this was the same BBC that put out an article around a year ago literally telling
[3:14:28.520 --> 3:14:36.520]  people that when they have sex with their partners they should wear a face mask they literally
[3:14:36.520 --> 3:14:42.520]  published an article on the BBC website saying that when you have sex with your girlfriend
[3:14:42.520 --> 3:14:48.520]  you need to wear a face mask yeah that actually happened well now they've issued some expert
[3:14:48.520 --> 3:14:54.520]  advice on how to hug your granny without killing her writes James Delling Paul
[3:14:54.520 --> 3:15:00.520]  according to Catherine notes a specialist in airborne infections at the University of Leeds
[3:15:00.520 --> 3:15:06.520]  which is not noticed as being one of the top universities the secret is to hug in moderation
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:11.520]  turn your face away slightly and always bear in mind the risk you are taking because you are
[3:15:11.520 --> 3:15:17.520]  very close to their breath at that moment well that what how about we bear we bear in mind
[3:15:17.520 --> 3:15:24.520]  the risk that we're taking even if for example myself as somebody under the age of 40 gets
[3:15:24.520 --> 3:15:31.520]  the coronavirus and still has a 99.8% chance of surviving it and then even within those figures
[3:15:31.520 --> 3:15:37.520]  you have to account for obesity and several other comorbidities why don't we account for that
[3:15:37.520 --> 3:15:45.520]  why don't we account for the fact that the COVID-19 virus particle is a thousand times smaller
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:51.520]  than that stupid face mask that you're wearing to signal your virtue how about we account for that
[3:15:51.520 --> 3:15:59.520]  how about we have a little risk assessment here and on the subject of masks again we have Fauci
[3:15:59.520 --> 3:16:06.520]  yesterday coming out and saying that mask mandates could last indefinitely to fight the flu we've had
[3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:13.520]  several other esteemed health experts denizens of the new scientific date dictatorship that we're all
[3:16:13.520 --> 3:16:20.520]  supposed to obey saying that no the mask mandates may end temporarily over the summer but they're
[3:16:20.520 --> 3:16:26.520]  just going to be brought back to fight the flu because the flu apparently is completely disappeared
[3:16:26.520 --> 3:16:32.520]  and it totally wasn't being counted as COVID in order to inflate the statistics and the numbers
[3:16:32.520 --> 3:16:40.520]  to terrorize the American people even more no that never happened it just disappeared the flu is gone
[3:16:40.520 --> 3:16:50.520]  but it's only going to remain gone if you remain muzzled in that face nappy I got in a lift or an elevator
[3:16:50.520 --> 3:16:58.520]  as Americans would call it the other day here in the building and it was a young woman who had just
[3:16:58.520 --> 3:17:06.520]  gone out to get her lunch evidently she wasn't wearing a face mask and she was waiting for the lift
[3:17:06.520 --> 3:17:14.520]  to come down with a man who presumably she didn't know and he was wearing a face mask he was the typical
[3:17:14.520 --> 3:17:21.520]  you know disgenic soy boy and he was about to get into a lift with this woman but there's a rule that
[3:17:21.520 --> 3:17:26.520]  you're not supposed to get into a lift with other people because we're all toxic virus spreaders
[3:17:26.520 --> 3:17:32.520]  despite the fact that literally in London there are zero COVID deaths whatsoever but the disgenic
[3:17:32.520 --> 3:17:40.520]  soy boy was quick to reassure the woman don't worry I'm wearing a face mask so of course what I did was
[3:17:40.520 --> 3:17:48.520]  got in the lift before both of them without a face mask forcing them to both get in the lift with me
[3:17:48.520 --> 3:17:54.520]  and then make little snidey comments to one another about how I'd ruined their little tryst
[3:17:54.520 --> 3:18:00.520]  their little safety exercise because of the disgenic soy boy was wearing a face mask so then when he got
[3:18:00.520 --> 3:18:06.520]  out of the lift on the 10th floor or whatever and I remained in the lift with the young woman she
[3:18:06.520 --> 3:18:16.520]  literally pulled up her blouse over her nose like I had BO or had let off a massive fart in the elevator
[3:18:16.520 --> 3:18:22.520]  that is the level of absurdity that we have right now she literally looked at me like I was the virus
[3:18:22.520 --> 3:18:29.520]  incarnate because I dared to get into an elevator without a face mask when there are zero deaths
[3:18:29.520 --> 3:18:36.520]  happening in London even if you believe the grossly exaggerated myth that is the big coronavirus
[3:18:36.520 --> 3:18:42.520]  threat so it's good as continuing definitely and during his appearance on Meet the Press Dr.
[3:18:42.520 --> 3:18:47.520]  Fauci was asked when Americans could take the masks off given that even the CDC is now advising
[3:18:47.520 --> 3:18:54.520]  vaccinated Americans that they can remove the face coverings when outside but he basically said no
[3:18:54.520 --> 3:19:02.520]  we have a flu season coming back and people are going to have to mask up once again because we can
[3:19:02.520 --> 3:19:09.520]  fight the deadly flu but as Tom Papper points out a national file Fauci contradicted one of his
[3:19:09.520 --> 3:19:13.520]  own claims elsewhere within the same interview the very next question appeared to exemplify an
[3:19:13.520 --> 3:19:18.520]  inconsistency as Chuck Todd proceeded to ask if Americans could finally let their God down as he
[3:19:18.520 --> 3:19:24.520]  claims they did in May of 2020 Todd's question would seem to indicate that 2020 saw the spread of
[3:19:24.520 --> 3:19:29.520]  COVID-19 because of the lack of adherence to COVID-19 precautions like social distancing
[3:19:29.520 --> 3:19:35.520]  lockdowns and mask wearing only seconds after Fauci suggested that the 2020 flu season was greatly
[3:19:35.520 --> 3:19:40.520]  diminished because of social distancing lockdowns and mask wearing yeah so apparently it ended the
[3:19:40.520 --> 3:19:46.520]  flu and yet it made the COVID spike exponentially worse makes no sense whatsoever we'll be right back
[3:19:46.520 --> 3:19:51.520]  don't go away you know listeners call into the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:19:51.520 --> 3:19:58.520]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer for financial support and
[3:19:58.520 --> 3:20:03.520]  for word of mouth and then we're all this together and you know it gets old having to come to you
[3:20:03.520 --> 3:20:07.520]  and say hey I've got great products please bomb or we won't be here on air but it's true for the only
[3:20:07.520 --> 3:20:12.520]  media organization the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to
[3:20:12.520 --> 3:20:16.520]  big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else they've crippled
[3:20:16.520 --> 3:20:21.520]  all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out and be open
[3:20:21.520 --> 3:20:26.520]  our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken off air that's why America has got to be
[3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:31.520]  taken down you can't have all these other nations enslaved and America's still quasi free you can't
[3:20:31.520 --> 3:20:36.520]  have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold

[3:21:57.520 --> 3:22:02.520]  the supply chain has broken down I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get
[3:22:02.520 --> 3:22:06.520]  a lot of these and so that's why we don't have a lot of products in that's why info wars is in
[3:22:06.520 --> 3:22:11.520]  financial trouble is because if we had the product you would be buying it we have the money but so

[3:24:12.520 --> 3:24:18.520]  back and we are now going to go to this video which is an explainer of why active duty military
[3:24:18.520 --> 3:24:25.520]  in France and our warning president Macron that France is potentially heading for a civil war
[3:24:25.520 --> 3:24:33.520]  could France be the first European example of where mass uncontrolled immigration combined with
[3:24:33.520 --> 3:24:39.520]  the dual threat to the identity of the nation of this quote anti-racism movement which topples
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:45.520]  the statues which tear the part of fabric of society could that lead to France being the
[3:24:45.520 --> 3:24:50.520]  first European example of a third world style failed state we're going to go to this video
[3:24:50.520 --> 3:24:56.520]  and I'm going to talk about the reaction to this letter after this clip here it is huge news
[3:24:56.520 --> 3:25:01.520]  out of France where active duty military personnel are now warning the government that civil war
[3:25:01.520 --> 3:25:06.520]  is on the horizon the controversy began last month when a group of retired military generals
[3:25:06.520 --> 3:25:11.520]  wrote a letter to president Macron they told Macron that the twin threats of the homeland
[3:25:11.520 --> 3:25:17.520]  hating statue toppling anti-racism movement and France has fractured an integrated immigrant
[3:25:17.520 --> 3:25:23.520]  populations were coalescing consolidating around an agenda to subvert the nation state and allow
[3:25:23.520 --> 3:25:28.520]  Islamist factions to gain pockets of control almost like they've been using Michelle Welbeck's
[3:25:28.520 --> 3:25:34.520]  2015 novel submission as an instruction manual recent poll found that the majority of French
[3:25:34.520 --> 3:25:40.520]  people thought the country was headed towards civil war now active duty military service
[3:25:40.520 --> 3:25:45.520]  members are echoing the same warning while chastising the government for treating the
[3:25:45.520 --> 3:25:50.520]  retired generals as extremists in an open letter to president Emmanuel Macron published by
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:55.520]  the French magazine Valure Actuelle on Sunday the service men whose names were not disclosed
[3:25:55.520 --> 3:26:00.520]  noted that the nation's elders are fighters who deserve to be respected for example there
[3:26:00.520 --> 3:26:05.520]  are those elderly servicemen whose honor you have trampled in recent weeks there are thousands
[3:26:05.520 --> 3:26:09.520]  of French servants who signed an open letter with common sense soldiers who gave their
[3:26:09.520 --> 3:26:14.520]  best years defending our freedom you treated them like rebels although their only fault
[3:26:14.520 --> 3:26:19.520]  is that they love their country and mourn its apparent fall the military members further
[3:26:19.520 --> 3:26:25.520]  warned that hatred for France and its history is becoming the norm they also said that violence
[3:26:25.520 --> 3:26:31.520]  in towns and villages is becoming commonplace they warned the government quote a civil war
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:37.520]  is brewing in France and you know that perfectly well they also literally said that the survival
[3:26:37.520 --> 3:26:42.520]  of the country was at stake France has much feared ban liers a high-rise suburb surrounding
[3:26:42.520 --> 3:26:48.520]  major cities where law and order has all but broken down police ambulance and fire crews
[3:26:48.520 --> 3:26:54.520]  are attacked viciously if they try to enter the area whenever authorities have violent
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:27:00.520]  attacks with criminals migrant populations react by rioting for days or even weeks on
[3:27:00.520 --> 3:27:06.520]  end not even the omnipresent force that is coronavirus lockdown restrictions could be
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:12.520]  fully imposed on such areas meanwhile although seemingly on the decline in other European
[3:27:12.520 --> 3:27:17.520]  countries Islamist terror attacks continue to be a routine occurrence in France last year
[3:27:17.520 --> 3:27:23.520]  teacher Samuel Patty was beheaded by a boat migrant who arrived in France as a refugee
[3:27:23.520 --> 3:27:28.520]  long French ambassador respond by saying that France is now a Muslim country
[3:27:35.520 --> 3:27:39.520]  intellectuals like Eric Zemmour have called for France's no-go zones to be reconquered
[3:27:39.520 --> 3:27:45.520]  by force by the military that's how dire the situation has become of course according
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:51.520]  to the media none of this exists and no-go zones are just one giant conspiracy theory
[3:27:51.520 --> 3:27:56.520]  in France and average of two churches are vandalized or set on fire every single day
[3:27:56.520 --> 3:28:01.520]  but Notre Dame was totally an accident Algerians in Paris like to celebrate football victories
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:05.520]  by tearing down Charles de Gaulle statues and attacking people in the streets
[3:28:05.520 --> 3:28:09.520]  so I'm sure they can be totally integrated violent attacks on Jews and Christians continue
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:15.520]  to rise yet who did the police routinely and savagely beat up for months on end
[3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:21.520]  Hello Vest protesters who do French authorities prosecute for hate speech but the very people
[3:28:21.520 --> 3:28:27.520]  warning about all this France is likely to be the first European example where mass
[3:28:27.520 --> 3:28:33.520]  uncontrolled immigration leads to a third world style failed state unless Marine Le Pen
[3:28:33.520 --> 3:28:38.520]  can stage a last-minute intervention by defeating President Macron in next year's
[3:28:38.520 --> 3:28:49.520]  presidential election remember to subscribe to the channel new videos every day maybe
[3:28:49.520 --> 3:28:54.520]  now after this letter was released and was published by the French newsletter
[3:28:54.520 --> 3:29:00.520]  over 220,000 of the French public signed on to it supporting the open letter
[3:29:00.520 --> 3:29:05.520]  now let's get this clear we had the first letter the initial letter which was signed
[3:29:05.520 --> 3:29:11.520]  by 20 retired military generals back in April last month that caused some waves this
[3:29:11.520 --> 3:29:17.520]  has caused even more because this is active duty military in France and they're part
[3:29:17.520 --> 3:29:22.520]  of the younger generation of soldiers this is from a zero hedge article entitled
[3:29:22.520 --> 3:29:28.520]  new military letter warning of civil war in France gains over 220,000 signatures
[3:29:28.520 --> 3:29:33.520]  this is part of the younger generation of soldiers who have served in Afghanistan,
[3:29:33.520 --> 3:29:39.520]  Mali and the Central African Republic or joined domestic anti-terrorism operations
[3:29:39.520 --> 3:29:44.520]  and boy is that a busy job in France because again as I point out in the video
[3:29:44.520 --> 3:29:48.520]  unlike other European countries where Islamic terror attacks kind of declined
[3:29:48.520 --> 3:29:54.520]  over the past couple of years in France it's a routine occurrence the beheading
[3:29:54.520 --> 3:30:01.520]  of the teacher the beheading of the women outside of Nice Cathedral the attacks on
[3:30:01.520 --> 3:30:05.520]  the streets that happen on a regular basis it hasn't stopped in France because
[3:30:05.520 --> 3:30:10.520]  Islamists have gained pockets of control and then they protect the violent criminals
[3:30:10.520 --> 3:30:15.520]  they protect the terrorists they don't integrate into society they don't even
[3:30:15.520 --> 3:30:20.520]  follow oh my god they don't follow COVID-19 lockdown rules surely that will cause
[3:30:20.520 --> 3:30:24.520]  the government to go and sort it out right because that's obviously the most
[3:30:24.520 --> 3:30:30.520]  important thing no but the people warning about this social dislocation this
[3:30:30.520 --> 3:30:36.520]  literal civil war in France that's on the horizon before in all these deadly
[3:30:36.520 --> 3:30:42.520]  countries where Islamist militants have gained a foothold so this goes beyond
[3:30:42.520 --> 3:30:49.520]  you know retired right-wing military generals from 30 40 years ago these are
[3:30:49.520 --> 3:30:54.520]  literally people who are fighting in the Central African Republic in Mali in
[3:30:54.520 --> 3:30:58.520]  Afghanistan they're in their 20s they're fighting against Islamic militants and
[3:30:58.520 --> 3:31:03.520]  they're seeing that in many cases they are being brought into France being brought
[3:31:03.520 --> 3:31:09.520]  into the EU as part of the quote refugee wave and then what did we see in
[3:31:09.520 --> 3:31:15.520]  France last October the beheading of the teacher Samuel Patty again for
[3:31:15.520 --> 3:31:21.520]  showing Charlie Hebdo offensive cartoons in the classroom who was responsible
[3:31:21.520 --> 3:31:25.520]  for that beheading it was a Tunisian boat migrant who arrived on the Mediterranean
[3:31:25.520 --> 3:31:31.520]  island of Lampedusa back a month before the beheading took place by the way
[3:31:31.520 --> 3:31:35.520]  there are thousands of these migrants these boat migrants arriving in Italy
[3:31:35.520 --> 3:31:42.520]  right now over the past couple of weeks many many such cases in France where
[3:31:42.520 --> 3:31:47.520]  these refugees have gone on directly to commit atrocities terror attacks in
[3:31:47.520 --> 3:31:52.520]  France in fact the majority of the Paris massacre terrorists came into the
[3:31:52.520 --> 3:31:58.520]  country disguising themselves amongst the refugee wave the guy who was one of
[3:31:58.520 --> 3:32:03.520]  the chief masterminds behind the Paris terrorist attack the Paris massacre that
[3:32:03.520 --> 3:32:08.520]  killed hundreds of people Abdeslam Salar Abdeslam again arrived on the
[3:32:08.520 --> 3:32:13.520]  refugee wave then he inverted he subverted himself into these banlios
[3:32:13.520 --> 3:32:18.520]  into Brussels Belgium particularly Molenbeek where we were sent as a film
[3:32:18.520 --> 3:32:24.520]  crew back in 2015 and literally got chased out of the area by Islamists he
[3:32:24.520 --> 3:32:30.520]  was hidden in that disjointed dislocated community in Molenbeek Brussels
[3:32:30.520 --> 3:32:34.520]  Belgium after slipping through the border from France because there is no
[3:32:34.520 --> 3:32:42.520]  border for three months minimum and the police were fearful to go into that
[3:32:42.520 --> 3:32:48.520]  area because as in France with these banlios with these high-rise ghetto
[3:32:48.520 --> 3:32:52.520]  suburbs on the edge of major major cities whenever police go in whenever ambulance
[3:32:52.520 --> 3:32:57.520]  crews go in go in whenever fire crews go in they get attacked they
[3:32:57.520 --> 3:33:02.520]  literally get rocks pelted at them by the local population so it's no
[3:33:02.520 --> 3:33:06.520]  surprise that it took them months and months to literally arrest one of the
[3:33:06.520 --> 3:33:12.520]  chief masterminds and perpetrators of the Paris massacre even though he was
[3:33:12.520 --> 3:33:18.520]  literally you know a hundred miles away in Brussels Belgium from Paris
[3:33:18.520 --> 3:33:23.520]  France so when these military members when these active duty military
[3:33:23.520 --> 3:33:27.520]  members warn about what they've seen in Mali in the Central African Republic
[3:33:27.520 --> 3:33:32.520]  and indeed domestically this is why it's important and in the next segment I'm
[3:33:32.520 --> 3:33:36.520]  going to go on to explain how this has been completely dismissed by the French
[3:33:36.520 --> 3:33:41.520]  government by potential presidents in the next French election in the next
[3:33:41.520 --> 3:33:45.520]  segment this is the summit news hour summit dot news don't go away
[3:33:45.520 --> 3:33:53.520]  the answer to 1984 is 1776

[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:42.520]  huge price increases I think it's a smart bet right now to get high quality

[3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:52.520]  14 months ago I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world
[3:36:52.520 --> 3:36:57.520]  collapses the third world dies we have such a complex civilization with so many
[3:36:57.520 --> 3:37:01.520]  billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world it causes a
[3:37:01.520 --> 3:37:05.520]  chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first
[3:37:05.520 --> 3:37:09.520]  world well now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States
[3:37:09.520 --> 3:37:13.520]  that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely
[3:37:13.520 --> 3:37:17.520]  get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down plus the keystone
[3:37:17.520 --> 3:37:21.520]  pipelines been shut down along with other pipelines the left is now blowing up dams
[3:37:21.520 --> 3:37:26.520]  across the US we're being shut down our coal power plants are off as well
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:30.520]  ladies and gentlemen prepare to be a total slave the third world is imploding
[3:37:30.520 --> 3:37:33.520]  as well the borders have been removed until you wake up this is a globalist
[3:37:33.520 --> 3:37:37.520]  chai-com takeover Gregory said you have no hope they're announcing that there
[3:37:37.520 --> 3:37:42.520]  will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this summer so they told you
[3:37:42.520 --> 3:37:46.520]  that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family
[3:37:46.520 --> 3:37:58.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:37:58.520 --> 3:38:06.520]  you're listening to summit.news with Paul Joseph Watson
[3:38:06.520 --> 3:38:16.520]  so we have the initial lecture from 20 retired military generals in France last month
[3:38:16.520 --> 3:38:21.520]  running president of a civil war in that country and now this has been escalated to
[3:38:21.520 --> 3:38:25.520]  the point where active duty military service members are basically echoing
[3:38:25.520 --> 3:38:30.520]  the same sentiment but their active duty they're young they call them the fire
[3:38:30.520 --> 3:38:36.520]  generation they've served recently in actual Islamist hell holes in Africa in
[3:38:36.520 --> 3:38:41.520]  the Middle East but how did the French government react to this letter first of
[3:38:41.520 --> 3:38:46.520]  all what did the letter say signed again by active duty military personnel who
[3:38:46.520 --> 3:38:51.520]  remained anonymous precisely because the French government vowed to prosecute the
[3:38:51.520 --> 3:38:57.520]  previous retired military generals who wrote the first letter they said quote
[3:38:57.520 --> 3:39:03.520]  a civil war is brewing in France and you know it perfectly well this is
[3:39:03.520 --> 3:39:07.520]  directly addressed to the president of the country the military members warned
[3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:11.520]  adding that the French government must take swift action to ensure quote the
[3:39:11.520 --> 3:39:16.520]  survival of our country so how did the French government react they tried to
[3:39:16.520 --> 3:39:21.520]  dismiss this as some fringe extremist belief by right-wing zealots despite the
[3:39:21.520 --> 3:39:26.520]  fact that they already had a poll based off of the first letter written by the
[3:39:26.520 --> 3:39:31.520]  retired generals which showed that 58% of the French public agreed that the
[3:39:31.520 --> 3:39:37.520]  country is headed towards civil war so it's very easy to write this off as some
[3:39:37.520 --> 3:39:42.520]  disgruntled individuals within the military these right wingers they claim
[3:39:42.520 --> 3:39:47.520]  who they say have taken the military hostage politicizing the military as
[3:39:47.520 --> 3:39:52.520]  they shouldn't do but when they took it to the French population the majority
[3:39:52.520 --> 3:39:59.520]  of the French population thinks the country is headed for civil war 58%
[3:39:59.520 --> 3:40:04.520]  that is massive that is a massive number but how did the French government
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:08.520]  react to the second letter while we have the headline here on summit.news
[3:40:08.520 --> 3:40:13.520]  French Interior Minister mocks letter that warns Macron of civil war this is
[3:40:13.520 --> 3:40:19.520]  French Interior Minister Gerald Dominan who mocked the letter signed by active
[3:40:19.520 --> 3:40:23.520]  duty military personnel that won Macron off civil war consuming the country
[3:40:23.520 --> 3:40:30.520]  why did he mock it because he said basically oh it's been signed by 229
[3:40:30.520 --> 3:40:37.520]  thousand people it means nothing no he doesn't understand how an open letter
[3:40:37.520 --> 3:40:43.520]  works the initial letter was released signed anonymously by active duty military
[3:40:43.520 --> 3:40:50.520]  service members via actual the side which is the French publication that
[3:40:50.520 --> 3:40:54.520]  released the initial letter as well so the initial letter was released by
[3:40:54.520 --> 3:41:00.520]  these active duty military personnel it was then supported within 24 hours by
[3:41:00.520 --> 3:41:06.520]  almost a quarter of a million French people but then they tried to use that
[3:41:06.520 --> 3:41:09.520]  and say well if a quarter of a million people have signed on to this letter
[3:41:09.520 --> 3:41:14.520]  they can't all be active duty military members right now that's not how an
[3:41:14.520 --> 3:41:20.520]  open letter works it's signed it's legitimized it's authenticated by the
[3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:26.520]  original authors which then leave it open for whoever they like to enlist
[3:41:26.520 --> 3:41:31.520]  their advocacy their support for the open letter that's the concept of an open
[3:41:31.520 --> 3:41:36.520]  letter and this idiotic French Interior Minister Dominan apparently doesn't
[3:41:36.520 --> 3:41:42.520]  understand that basic simple concept and as I write in the article
[3:41:42.520 --> 3:41:47.520]  Jelaine Maxwell could sign the letter she's French right but it still wouldn't
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:50.520]  change the fact that it represents a serious warning to Macron's
[3:41:50.520 --> 3:41:56.520]  administration that should be treated soberly not childishly mocked again I
[3:41:56.520 --> 3:42:01.520]  point to the poll the majority of French people agree agree with these
[3:42:01.520 --> 3:42:04.520]  individuals within the military who have signed this letter warning of civil war
[3:42:04.520 --> 3:42:09.520]  because of the anti-racism movement tearing down toppling statues hating
[3:42:09.520 --> 3:42:15.520]  France hating everything it stands for and then aligning with these Islamists
[3:42:15.520 --> 3:42:19.520]  who have created these pockets of unruly control within the banlios within
[3:42:19.520 --> 3:42:24.520]  the ghettos within the outer areas of the cities where law enforcement fears
[3:42:24.520 --> 3:42:30.520]  to tread and they've created their own parallel legal system that's a big
[3:42:30.520 --> 3:42:34.520]  problem because if you get enough of those areas they end up taking over the
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:40.520]  entire city this mimics Michelle Welvex 2015 book submission which was
[3:42:40.520 --> 3:42:44.520]  published on the day of Charlie Hebdo attacks which predicted this very
[3:42:44.520 --> 3:42:49.520]  scenario the Islamists would gain enough pockets of control because of their
[3:42:49.520 --> 3:42:54.520]  being empowered by the anti-racism leftist the far left and being empowered by
[3:42:54.520 --> 3:42:58.520]  the government with its complete inaction that they would not only take
[3:42:58.520 --> 3:43:02.520]  over certain areas that they would then become enough of a nuisance that they
[3:43:02.520 --> 3:43:07.520]  would need to be an Islamist political party to literally enter into government
[3:43:07.520 --> 3:43:11.520]  as a coalition with the far left and say oh because this is such a big problem
[3:43:11.520 --> 3:43:16.520]  we can keep the violent Islamists in control under control just give us
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:21.520]  power within the government that scenario laid out in his work of fiction
[3:43:21.520 --> 3:43:26.520]  six years ago is actually now unfolding in France the military members are
[3:43:26.520 --> 3:43:31.520]  warning about it and the government's reaction is just to scoff, dismiss and
[3:43:31.520 --> 3:43:36.520]  laugh at them well France has a presidential election next year and
[3:43:36.520 --> 3:43:40.520]  we'll see given those polls that show the majority of French people support
[3:43:40.520 --> 3:43:44.520]  the sentiment expressed in this letter we'll see how well that translates
[3:43:44.520 --> 3:43:50.520]  mocking and laughing at the people warning about this meanwhile the socialist
[3:43:50.520 --> 3:43:54.520]  presidential candidate in France was more direct with his response to the letter
[3:43:54.520 --> 3:43:59.520]  headline socialist presidential candidate vows to purge French military after
[3:43:59.520 --> 3:44:05.520]  letter warning of civil war this is Jean-Luc Mélenchon who by the way came
[3:44:05.520 --> 3:44:11.520]  forth in the 2017 French president presidential election and he reacted
[3:44:11.520 --> 3:44:16.520]  to the letter by saying he would purge the military of these dissidents if he
[3:44:16.520 --> 3:44:23.520]  is elected president in next year's election he labeled it the issue in
[3:44:23.520 --> 3:44:27.520]  exceptionally serious situation and asserted that the military should not
[3:44:27.520 --> 3:44:32.520]  allow factions to politicize it he said quote if I'm elected president of the
[3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:37.520]  republic these crimes will not go unpunished I intend to purge the army of
[3:44:37.520 --> 3:44:42.520]  the factions so he's literally saying he will identify root out the dissenters
[3:44:42.520 --> 3:44:47.520]  and kick them out the military and then you know set an example for everyone
[3:44:47.520 --> 3:44:52.520]  else so the government is mocking it Mélenchon the far left candidate who has
[3:44:52.520 --> 3:44:57.520]  a chance of winning in 2022 is saying he will tackle it head on by purging the
[3:44:57.520 --> 3:45:02.520]  military then we have this comment which is even more interesting from Michel
[3:45:02.520 --> 3:45:09.520]  Barnier now he is what they term a global centrist or a moderate in terms of
[3:45:09.520 --> 3:45:15.520]  European politics you can even call him a globalist he negotiated the Brexit deal
[3:45:15.520 --> 3:45:21.520]  on behalf of the EU with the United Kingdom and now Michel Barnier the
[3:45:21.520 --> 3:45:27.520]  ultimate centrist moderate neoliberal politician is calling for a three to
[3:45:27.520 --> 3:45:34.520]  five-year suspension of immigration into the EU that's a complete moratorium on
[3:45:34.520 --> 3:45:41.520]  all immigration entering the EU for three to five years and this is a moderate
[3:45:41.520 --> 3:45:46.520]  saying this this is a huge story Michel Barnier is called for a three to five
[3:45:46.520 --> 3:45:51.520]  year suspension of immigration into EU countries warning that the blocs external
[3:45:51.520 --> 3:45:57.520]  borders have become a sieve for criminals and terrorists he said quote I think we
[3:45:57.520 --> 3:46:03.520]  have to take the time for three or five years to suspend immigration now when
[3:46:03.520 --> 3:46:07.520]  you've got countries that literally allow in per year hundreds of thousands of
[3:46:07.520 --> 3:46:12.520]  immigrants every single year not just from other EU countries but from the rest
[3:46:12.520 --> 3:46:17.520]  of the world for a centrist moderate politician to come forward and say that's
[3:46:17.520 --> 3:46:23.520]  it it's done we need to pause it for at least three to five years that is a huge
[3:46:23.520 --> 3:46:31.520]  story however while making this point Barnier asserted that the controls wouldn't
[3:46:31.520 --> 3:46:36.520]  apply to refugees because we can't discriminate against the pressure
[3:46:36.520 --> 3:46:42.520]  precious refugees again despite the fact as I talked about earlier there are
[3:46:42.520 --> 3:46:48.520]  numerous cases in front of quote refugees carrying out direct terror attacks
[3:46:48.520 --> 3:46:52.520]  against the French population including the beheading of the school teacher back
[3:46:52.520 --> 3:46:57.520]  in October last year and including the Paris massacre itself so if it doesn't
[3:46:57.520 --> 3:47:02.520]  include as was Trump's policy quote refugees from countries which had been
[3:47:02.520 --> 3:47:06.520]  associated with terrorism on numerous occasions including Syria Afghanistan and
[3:47:06.520 --> 3:47:11.520]  the like then it's not a moratorium on immigration at all in fact Barnier made
[3:47:11.520 --> 3:47:15.520]  the point that it's about stopping criminal human traffickers and it's about
[3:47:15.520 --> 3:47:18.520]  stopping terrorists it's not going to stop terrorists if you allow for
[3:47:18.520 --> 3:47:23.520]  refugees because terrorists time and time again have proven to exploit the
[3:47:23.520 --> 3:47:29.520]  refugee wave to insert themselves into Europe and carry out mass casualty terror
[3:47:29.520 --> 3:47:34.520]  attacks it's happened at least a dozen times in major European countries
[3:47:34.520 --> 3:47:40.520]  over the past five years meanwhile the New York Times reports in this final
[3:47:40.520 --> 3:47:46.520]  story a misleading CDC number they admit that the census for disease control
[3:47:46.520 --> 3:47:50.520]  said that less than 10% of COVID-19 transmissions were occurring outdoors
[3:47:50.520 --> 3:47:56.520]  now even the New York Times is admitting that not only is the number below
[3:47:56.520 --> 3:48:05.520]  1% that it's below 0.1% according to top epidemiologists yet Americans in
[3:48:05.520 --> 3:48:09.520]  numerous major cities not in Texas not in South Dakota not in Florida where
[3:48:09.520 --> 3:48:14.520]  they've had a drastic drop in coronavirus cases and deaths Americans are still
[3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:19.520]  wearing masks outdoors in the open air to virtue signal about what good people
[3:48:19.520 --> 3:48:26.520]  they are despite the fact that less than 0.1% of COVID transmissions occurred
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:31.520]  outdoors absolutely absurd ridiculous and incredible that's going to wrap it up
[3:48:31.520 --> 3:48:50.520]  for Summit News hour coming up next is warring the summit.News.
