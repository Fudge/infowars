[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:30.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.480 --> 00:36.800]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this
[00:36.800 --> 00:41.880]  Monday edition of the Worldwide Transmission we're going to be live here
[00:41.880 --> 00:47.000]  for the next three hours and I am surveying western areas of the United
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.720]  States to see for myself how much globalism and the tattletale control
[00:52.720 --> 00:57.840]  free society has expanded I will have reports for you later in the hour on
[00:57.840 --> 01:03.640]  basically what I have witnessed while we have been out here I am now in southern
[01:03.640 --> 01:08.440]  Utah crossing over from the Grand Canyon and Arizona yesterday and I've
[01:08.440 --> 01:12.280]  already filed some of those video reports at info wars.com I'm gonna be
[01:12.280 --> 01:16.600]  filing more as soon as I can get to a spot that has good internet I am
[01:16.600 --> 01:24.240]  literally a hundred miles from nowhere as the Dwight Yocum song says in fact
[01:24.240 --> 01:28.760]  I'm probably 500 miles from nowhere and so all we've got is a landline that's
[01:28.760 --> 01:32.560]  another reason I'm engaging in this trip is that plan to travel around the
[01:32.560 --> 01:36.880]  country a lot next year giving speeches and visiting our AM and FM affiliates
[01:36.880 --> 01:41.280]  and just unfortunately we would try to go up on mountain top of the RV and it
[01:41.280 --> 01:46.240]  just would not connect so we're here via landline we have quite a broadcast
[01:46.240 --> 01:52.680]  lined up for you today to say the very least and we're going to be breaking all
[01:52.680 --> 01:56.960]  that down here in just a moment and just the unbelievable quickening of what's
[01:56.960 --> 02:02.160]  happening we have Gerald Salente joining us with an update on what's happening
[02:02.160 --> 02:09.880]  with MF Global basically grabbing somewhere between 700 and a billion
[02:09.880 --> 02:15.440]  dollars of their clients money and first thing JP Morgan had it now saying
[02:15.440 --> 02:19.200]  they don't know where it is and I guess the federal government because most
[02:19.200 --> 02:24.360]  the regulators including the head of the CFTC were invested with Mr. Corzine
[02:24.360 --> 02:27.680]  of course they all got the warning to get out early like they'd like the Coke
[02:27.680 --> 02:32.040]  brothers so this is a new level of where they just take the money out of your
[02:32.040 --> 02:36.120]  segregated personal account I've done some research those are supposedly
[02:36.120 --> 02:39.440]  guaranteed as well for another system but now they're saying no this is the
[02:39.440 --> 02:43.760]  new way things work we're taking your money so Gerald Salente is going to be
[02:43.760 --> 02:47.360]  joining us Jesse Ventura you got to get him always hot because he's about to go
[02:47.360 --> 02:51.680]  back to Mexico at least for a few months gonna be joining us we'll talk more
[02:51.680 --> 02:55.920]  about will he run for president I've now talked to libertarian party people they
[02:55.920 --> 03:01.640]  certainly would like to entertain that we also have Max Kaiser joining us about
[03:01.640 --> 03:07.240]  the importance of the MF global fiasco and info wars nightly co-host nightly
[03:07.240 --> 03:14.360]  news co-host Aaron Dykes will also be in Austin Texas riding shotgun with us as
[03:14.360 --> 03:19.840]  backup in case I have any technical difficulties he'll also be adding quite a
[03:19.840 --> 03:24.720]  bit of his expert analysis in historical commentary to backstop what we're
[03:24.720 --> 03:28.520]  covering here we're gonna go to break in a moment and I'll come back and run
[03:28.520 --> 03:32.600]  through the unbelievable developments but here's just some of them New York
[03:32.600 --> 03:37.440]  Times tries to blame political film for White House shooting guess what
[03:37.440 --> 03:44.160]  political film that's right the Obama deception continuing Egypt's brutal
[03:44.160 --> 03:49.800]  military junta is supported by Obama administration remember CIA Anderson
[03:49.800 --> 03:55.840]  Cooper oh it's so gracious the democracy and in Egypt as they kicked out the
[03:55.840 --> 04:00.080]  old dictator who wasn't brutal enough and now just machine gun people in mass
[04:00.080 --> 04:04.400]  and beat their heads in the Egyptian military is saying look at the police
[04:04.400 --> 04:09.320]  in America they shoot and kill people so now America is an example of evil not
[04:09.320 --> 04:15.840]  an example of good continuing if there's a run on the banks you know who to
[04:15.840 --> 04:19.840]  blame by Paul Joseph Watson I asked Paul to write that article last night
[04:19.840 --> 04:25.160]  because I discovered Forbes in a big article on us a few days ago with the
[04:25.160 --> 04:30.160]  headline talk show host and guest talk show host Alex Jones and guest call for
[04:30.160 --> 04:35.280]  run on banks what we said is the globalist are gonna pick people off one
[04:35.280 --> 04:39.760]  by one and steal your mega counts outright also put all these crazy fines
[04:39.760 --> 04:43.920]  and fees on it and so what MF global and others are doing is going to destroy
[04:43.920 --> 04:46.880]  confidence that's already happening with people getting their money out of the
[04:46.880 --> 04:51.120]  big mega banks we'll be right back after the break is an incredibly jam packed
[04:51.120 --> 04:55.880]  transmission I'm Alex Jones person planet TV
[04:59.320 --> 05:03.280]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:03.280 --> 05:07.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.640 --> 05:11.800]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:11.800 --> 05:15.840]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:15.840 --> 05:19.680]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:19.680 --> 05:23.880]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:23.880 --> 05:28.160]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:28.160 --> 05:32.440]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:32.440 --> 05:36.160]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[05:36.160 --> 05:40.360]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[05:40.360 --> 05:43.760]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[05:43.760 --> 05:49.160]  from science one of my old responses you can get more information at www.mysolar
[05:49.160 --> 05:53.440]  backup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own
[05:53.440 --> 06:01.160]  the Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 a very wealthy US

[07:04.560 --> 07:09.320]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[07:09.320 --> 07:13.240]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[07:13.240 --> 07:17.080]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[07:17.080 --> 07:22.040]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[07:22.040 --> 07:27.320]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[07:27.320 --> 07:31.960]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[07:31.960 --> 07:36.160]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[07:36.160 --> 07:41.040]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[07:41.040 --> 07:45.800]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to
[07:45.800 --> 07:51.400]  www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of
[07:51.400 --> 07:57.440]  the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[07:57.440 --> 08:11.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[08:11.640 --> 08:19.200]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[08:19.200 --> 08:35.640]  Texas Alex Jones
[08:35.640 --> 08:40.080]  okay we have some kind of technical issue Alex is going to be back in just a
[08:40.080 --> 08:45.840]  moment but of course the news is loaded and chief among them is the so-called
[08:45.840 --> 08:51.760]  assassination plot where the accused assassin has been linked to none other
[08:51.760 --> 08:56.640]  than Alex Jones is Obama deception they've got the guy who allegedly sold
[08:56.640 --> 09:02.560]  him the gun quoting that he knows he watched the Obama deception produced and
[09:02.560 --> 09:07.120]  written by Alex Jones he doesn't recall however if Mr. Ortega ever talked of
[09:07.120 --> 09:13.320]  taking violent action but he does recall the political film he watched online so
[09:13.320 --> 09:16.800]  that's very interesting tie-in as they've repeatedly tried to demonize
[09:16.800 --> 09:21.720]  this broadcast and other alternative news and furthermore you see a resurgence
[09:21.720 --> 09:25.760]  of this talking point where now you're supposed to watch what you say you have
[09:25.760 --> 09:30.360]  to be careful who and how you criticize you've got the Christian Post reporting
[09:30.360 --> 09:34.560]  quoted here in Curt Nemo's article that conservatives and faith leaders warn
[09:34.560 --> 09:39.560]  Christians to be more careful of how they criticize political opponents after
[09:39.560 --> 09:42.760]  court documents reveal that the suspect in the White House shooting Oscar
[09:42.760 --> 09:47.920]  Romero Ortega Hernandez believe President Obama to be the anti-Christ so
[09:47.920 --> 09:52.160]  just like in the Tucson shooting and other incidents you see an attempt to
[09:52.160 --> 09:57.320]  blame the rhetoric in media for actual attempted violent action or in the case
[09:57.320 --> 10:03.680]  of Tucson actual violent action we have Alex back on the line yes I'm lucky to
[10:03.680 --> 10:09.080]  have any phone service at all I'm here in Monument Valley Utah where they have
[10:09.080 --> 10:13.680]  to truck the water red so it's like back in the nineteen back in the 1940s this
[10:13.680 --> 10:17.920]  was John Wayne's favorite place to hang out even when he wasn't shooting more
[10:17.920 --> 10:24.520]  than more than 10 of his famous films here like the searchers and a yellow
[10:24.520 --> 10:29.440]  ribbon but we are here basically tracking globalist activities I left the
[10:29.440 --> 10:35.200]  Grand Canyon yesterday I'll have reports on that for people coming up in the
[10:35.200 --> 10:40.480]  third hour today again I join you by phone not by our crystal clear skype
[10:40.480 --> 10:46.160]  audio and video because I'm back in the 1940s here in beautiful Monument Valley
[10:46.160 --> 10:52.360]  and we just got incredible video from inside the Grand Canyon the UN signs a
[10:52.360 --> 11:00.560]  local tourist basically gets upset that I'm even talking about the UN taking
[11:00.560 --> 11:07.080]  over America gets mad at me all of that is is coming up later today and we've
[11:07.080 --> 11:11.720]  got a jam-packed broadcast lined up for you as well and again Aaron Dykes there
[11:11.720 --> 11:18.560]  is in studio with us in case I have any technical difficulties continuing here
[11:18.560 --> 11:22.720]  was just some of the headlines Aaron was just getting into this New York Times
[11:22.720 --> 11:27.920]  tries to blame political film for White House shooting the political film is the
[11:27.920 --> 11:31.720]  Obama deception and we've got all these quote conservative Christian leaders
[11:31.720 --> 11:35.720]  coming out and saying don't criticize the government it's not of the Lord that's
[11:35.720 --> 11:39.640]  all part of the FEMA clergy response team situation very frightening that
[11:39.640 --> 11:43.720]  they continue to have so-called friends of all these different shooters come out
[11:43.720 --> 11:48.880]  and blame our films when my film the Obama deception says Obama is a puppet
[11:48.880 --> 11:54.200]  and not even a bad person he's a teleprompter reading a minion a nobody
[11:54.200 --> 11:58.800]  and then it's the mega banks the council on farm relations the the the the
[11:58.800 --> 12:04.880]  private Federal Reserve we never call for offensive violence and I don't believe
[12:04.880 --> 12:10.200]  for a minute he's so-called friend that's quoted in the New York Times just
[12:10.200 --> 12:15.080]  like with Poplowski the guy that shot three cops and within two hours the
[12:15.080 --> 12:19.920]  Southern Primary Law Center connected writer who later had to retract five of
[12:19.920 --> 12:24.840]  the publications had to retract had all had said that he shot the cops because
[12:24.840 --> 12:29.480]  of me when they when they actually released his full searching record and
[12:29.480 --> 12:33.960]  what he was visiting it was hundreds of sites including Fox News CNN and it
[12:33.960 --> 12:39.800]  turned out Richard Poplowski hated Alex Jones hated info wars calm and posted
[12:39.800 --> 12:44.440]  on all the big white supremacists posted on our site attacking us and the
[12:44.440 --> 12:50.680]  system knew it and didn't care within two hours the cops weren't even cold yet
[12:50.680 --> 12:55.800]  they blamed us when it was he was drunk with pit bulls his mother he was a
[12:55.800 --> 13:00.440]  mama's boy he got threw out of the Marine Corps she said you're not gonna
[13:00.440 --> 13:03.600]  have a second dog they're go they're crapping all over the floor excuse my
[13:03.600 --> 13:07.840]  French and he threw a fit she said I'm calling the police to throw you out at
[13:07.840 --> 13:11.760]  you know 4 a.m. in the morning they showed up and he shot him with his
[13:11.760 --> 13:17.160]  semi-auto AK-47 okay so that's what happened there and within two hours of
[13:17.160 --> 13:20.800]  him being in handcuffs they came out on the news and said he did it for Alex
[13:20.800 --> 13:24.800]  Jones they went into his computer and said look this guy's attacking Alex
[13:24.800 --> 13:30.600]  Jones will blame him same thing with Tucson I got blamed for it turned out
[13:30.600 --> 13:34.520]  the guy was attacking me was a big liberal and then fried his brain on a
[13:34.520 --> 13:39.240]  bunch of drugs and was connected to psychiatrist as usual now it turns out
[13:39.240 --> 13:43.800]  this guy they're saying watch the Obama deception and so that's the one reason
[13:43.800 --> 13:47.880]  he must have done this when I explained the first 10 minutes of it that Obama
[13:47.880 --> 13:52.360]  is built up to be destroyed so that he'll take the political blame for the
[13:52.360 --> 13:56.640]  globalist agenda just like the next Republican they put in might not even be
[13:56.640 --> 14:00.960]  a bad person individually but will still be politically destroyed and blame for
[14:00.960 --> 14:07.920]  the entire agenda this is very very very very dangerous and that's why you have
[14:07.920 --> 14:11.680]  to understand ladies and gentlemen the FBI visited us three days before the
[14:11.680 --> 14:16.280]  Obama deception was released they delivered a gag order to us would not
[14:16.280 --> 14:20.520]  say why they were there but kept asking about the Obama deception in the days
[14:20.520 --> 14:24.960]  after they would call up and ask my employees questions about it and then
[14:24.960 --> 14:29.680]  of course I had a gag order all I could say is the FBI came here and then of
[14:29.680 --> 14:32.600]  course later came out in the news that they had indeed been to our office folks
[14:32.600 --> 14:36.240]  thought that was some stunt ladies and gentlemen we're on almost a hundred a
[14:36.240 --> 14:39.960]  million FM affiliates we're on XM global short way if we have three million
[14:39.960 --> 14:45.200]  listeners a day we don't need to pull studs okay we have the New York Times
[14:45.200 --> 14:51.960]  and all these other giant publications attacking us all over the place right
[14:51.960 --> 14:56.920]  now trying to set us up for violence so that when they swap team us or kill us
[14:56.920 --> 15:02.400]  or do whatever they're going to do to me that they can basically rationalize the
[15:02.400 --> 15:07.560]  whole thing they're trying to paint us as violent so they can have the pretext
[15:07.560 --> 15:11.520]  to come after us they got the internet kill switch bill they're pushing they've
[15:11.520 --> 15:15.600]  got all this other legislation coming out they've got this legislation where
[15:15.600 --> 15:19.960]  under copyright there's no due process they can shut on any website it's on
[15:19.960 --> 15:25.160]  why is info wars calm being attacked why is the Obama deception being attacked
[15:25.160 --> 15:30.480]  why is Alex Jones being attacked because we hit bubbles I we're over the
[15:30.480 --> 15:36.120]  target dropping heavy poundage pounding the enemy blowing them to kingdom come
[15:36.120 --> 15:40.560]  in the info war we know the pen is mightier than the sword we know the film
[15:40.560 --> 15:44.280]  is a trillion times mightier than the sword we understand this speech and
[15:44.280 --> 15:47.960]  ideas are bulletproof and cannot be defeated and we're not backing down
[15:47.960 --> 15:51.880]  we're going head-on into this black hole the New World Order we're going in
[15:51.880 --> 15:55.960]  through and beyond and nothing is going to stop us at the end of the day it
[15:55.960 --> 15:58.480]  doesn't matter what happens to Alex Jones doesn't matter what happens in
[15:58.480 --> 16:02.440]  full wars dot com that's the reason we're so attacked by the co-intel pro and
[16:02.440 --> 16:06.640]  the disinfo ops from below were attacked from above were attacked by
[16:06.640 --> 16:10.840]  establishment media you name it we are under total bombardment because we are
[16:10.840 --> 16:14.560]  on target we are over the enemy targets just like the whole World War two
[16:14.560 --> 16:18.280]  saying how do you know when you're over the target it's because you see the
[16:18.280 --> 16:22.960]  black smoke trying to block everything out you get into that fog of war and
[16:22.960 --> 16:29.160]  here comes the strafing here comes the anti-aircraft here comes the exploding
[16:29.160 --> 16:32.840]  shells putting all the metal into the air to fly through your engines and blow

[16:52.520 --> 16:55.880]  stealing people sequestered accounts but that's how they're trying to spend it
[16:55.880 --> 17:01.080]  New York Times Forbes just the attacks continue MSNBC
[17:01.080 --> 17:06.040]  nightline just pounding and attacking savagely because they don't know how to

[17:10.240 --> 17:13.200]  us into a martyr they know that I studied history they know that I'm
[17:13.200 --> 17:15.680]  committed and don't care and they understand that they don't know how to
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.200]  deal with it so they're trying to assassinate our character so I hope you

[17:21.720 --> 17:25.360]  it to her at New York Times tries to blame political film for White House

[17:42.920 --> 17:47.240]  Egyptian military justifies murder of protesters by pointing to American
[17:47.240 --> 17:52.920]  police curling up in a ball to avoid police violence may be considered
[17:52.920 --> 17:56.480]  active resistance there's videos coming out of people curled up in balls being
[17:56.480 --> 18:00.600]  billy clubbed and rubber bulleted and pepper sprayed and the police are saying
[18:00.600 --> 18:04.000]  this is the new freedom you are resisting us when you curl up in a ball
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.200]  you must stick your chin out and say please break my jaw again this is just
[18:09.200 --> 18:13.120]  the total wickedness that's coming into America as the banks prepare to suck
[18:13.120 --> 18:18.080]  everything absolutely dry joining us today in about 40 minutes Jesse Ventura
[18:18.080 --> 18:22.080]  with breaking news and information coming up in about 12 minutes we got
[18:22.080 --> 18:25.680]  Gerald Salenta on the latest on MF global saying we're not going to tell you
[18:25.680 --> 18:30.280]  where the 700 to 1 billion dollars in customer money went that's all coming
[18:30.280 --> 18:34.600]  up and Max Kaiser on MF global and how big this is and the fact that the media
[18:34.600 --> 18:39.280]  admits that's what's hammering markets right now it is Monday November 21st
[18:39.280 --> 18:45.560]  2011 this is the info war and I am wound up Aaron Dykes take us out to break tell
[18:45.560 --> 18:48.560]  us what else is coming up we are going to go to break and something I want to
[18:48.560 --> 18:53.280]  get into later is that angle that Egyptian military justifies murder of
[18:53.280 --> 18:57.440]  protesters by pointing to American cops and they routinely use the way they
[18:57.440 --> 19:02.760]  handle civilians to justify things that happen overseas often by military and
[19:02.760 --> 19:08.400]  other units trained in America but more on this alleged attempted assassination
[19:08.400 --> 19:12.720]  attempt when Obama wasn't even in the country is the fact that he's been
[19:12.720 --> 19:17.720]  politically desperate for a long time now and the democratic establishment is
[19:17.720 --> 19:23.680]  scrambling to either justify a resurgence of Obama's political popularity
[19:23.680 --> 19:28.720]  through some kind of pretext or false flag attack or to rebrand another
[19:28.720 --> 19:34.560]  Democrat Hillary one possible name floated they weekly weekly constantly
[19:34.560 --> 19:38.520]  report on how he has politically dropped so bad in the polls that they are
[19:38.520 --> 19:42.600]  desperate to figure out what to do so we'll see which way that goes we'll be

[24:37.720 --> 24:40.760]  is article in a way is almost positive I don't know if it's a hit piece or not
[24:40.760 --> 24:44.960]  because recall conspiracy theorists and things but it does admit that we've been
[24:44.960 --> 24:48.600]  right about gold going up in price and it does admit that MF global has
[24:48.600 --> 24:52.840]  disappeared all this money and so people have a right to be upset but it uses all
[24:52.840 --> 24:57.920]  the standard cliches the headline is not right though we're saying you can't
[24:57.920 --> 25:02.320]  trust the banks so that's going to elicit the bank run that's what always
[25:02.320 --> 25:05.920]  causes the bank run you already see people the last few months pulling their
[25:05.920 --> 25:11.080]  money out of the big six mega banks and you now see I'm arresting people that
[25:11.080 --> 25:13.600]  come in and try to get their money out when I first heard that a month ago I
[25:13.600 --> 25:18.200]  thought this can't be true and then I watch YouTube after YouTube after YouTube
[25:18.200 --> 25:22.760]  where the people would go in and the cops were waiting and they would like say
[25:22.760 --> 25:26.440]  you're upset today why are you so upset ma'am they'd be like I'm not upset give
[25:26.440 --> 25:30.360]  me my money they'd be like you've got to wait no you give it to me now that's a
[25:30.360 --> 25:36.000]  disorderly conduct you're out of here so many of these poor people that work for
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.760]  the system really think that they're gonna hold the system up by by engaging
[25:40.760 --> 25:45.000]  all this tyrannical activity the truth is they're gonna allow the globalist to
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.560]  end this free republic as it's been known traveling across the west and I've
[25:49.560 --> 25:53.760]  been out here many times I've never seen children looking more poor into
[25:53.760 --> 25:58.320]  shovels people looking more freaked out and poor restaurants that are few and
[25:58.320 --> 26:03.840]  far between being more empty hotels and motels being more empty we pulled up to
[26:03.840 --> 26:08.720]  get gas last night next door to a
[26:09.240 --> 26:16.160]  Burger King that was right next to the border with southern Utah and Arizona
[26:16.160 --> 26:19.720]  which it was just on the Arizona side for your crossover into the monument
[26:19.720 --> 26:26.000]  Valley Utah area and I got on video nine stray dogs but by the time we got back
[26:26.000 --> 26:33.640]  on the RV and left there was about 15 with more showing up just large stray
[26:33.640 --> 26:39.920]  dogs fighting over scraps of food and following people into the Burger King
[26:39.920 --> 26:43.760]  growling at them demanding that they give them something to eat I mean it was
[26:43.760 --> 26:47.960]  very very dystopic I've never seen anything like this and I've been on the
[26:47.960 --> 26:53.120]  west a lot I've never seen the Indian reservations looking more run down and
[26:53.120 --> 26:57.480]  shelled I've never seen the people looking more dejected freaked out I've
[26:57.480 --> 27:04.280]  never seen more police more forest service people bugging their eyes out
[27:04.280 --> 27:11.440]  the only new cars or government vehicles it is really scary the things
[27:11.440 --> 27:14.600]  I've seen out here and I'm gonna be filing more of those reports I probably
[27:14.600 --> 27:19.840]  got 20 video reports I haven't uploaded yet you know why because it's there's
[27:19.840 --> 27:23.800]  no internet out here I mean you get in towns and sit there in a parking lot for
[27:23.800 --> 27:28.240]  an hour trying to upload a four-minute clip so I'll have to follow most of
[27:28.240 --> 27:35.000]  these as we're driving back to Austin tomorrow evening and so I want to
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.780]  challenge everybody out there to be watching Tuesday night the info wars
[27:40.780 --> 27:46.000]  calm and Wednesday with the nightly news we've got Mike Adams who's gonna be
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.400]  hosting the nightly news tonight it's Aaron Dyches tomorrow and I really
[27:49.400 --> 27:53.680]  appreciate the great job they're doing Robin it's a great job it's so good to
[27:53.680 --> 27:57.040]  see other informed people who can in some cases do a better job than I'm doing
[27:57.040 --> 28:02.080]  God bless them plus that means more targets I don't like being the only the
[28:02.080 --> 28:05.720]  only B-17 up here dropping bombs on the New World Order Aaron you started
[28:05.720 --> 28:10.280]  getting into the incredible statements by the military regime installed by the
[28:10.280 --> 28:15.320]  globalist the same folks that have taken our country over through COG now just
[28:15.320 --> 28:19.640]  machine-gunning men women children arresting anybody that doesn't wear a
[28:19.640 --> 28:27.120]  burka sharia law boy and putting al-qaeda in Libya and then the new forces
[28:27.120 --> 28:31.120]  say hey we're doing what America does incredible Aaron well yeah you've got
[28:31.120 --> 28:35.560]  the tale of two cities going on because if you're Syria or some other country
[28:35.560 --> 28:40.720]  they want to run over then every outrage every injustice is totally an
[28:40.720 --> 28:45.840]  outrage but if you're a US client state like Egypt in the middle of internal
[28:45.840 --> 28:51.160]  civil war every injustice is just justified because it's just like
[28:51.160 --> 28:55.760]  America and the quote here is we saw the firm stance US took against Occupy
[28:55.760 --> 28:59.520]  Wall Street people and the German government against green protesters to
[28:59.520 --> 29:04.520]  secure the state said an Egyptian state television anchor yesterday and thus the
[29:04.520 --> 29:10.360]  implied justification for what I think now amounts to at least 35 murders just
[29:10.360 --> 29:14.520]  from these recent clashes all because the military will not give up power in
[29:14.520 --> 29:22.120]  Egypt and they're saying elections would be in 2013 or after amazing and notice
[29:22.120 --> 29:27.160]  how Anderson Cooper and others endorse this as the ultimate democracy six months
[29:27.160 --> 29:31.480]  ago eight months ago and now they're not even criticizing the mass murder and
[29:31.480 --> 29:35.720]  slaughter because it's purely a globalist system again every country
[29:35.720 --> 29:40.520]  being taken over by this corporate is bored and we're all liberties are thrown out the window
[29:40.520 --> 29:45.560]  we'll be right back with your old Salete Aaron Dykes Jesse Viterra Max Kaiser

[33:55.640 --> 34:02.040]  watched more than 35 million times for free online because we want to beat the globalist
[34:02.040 --> 34:07.160]  we make powerful films and put them out for free and they're now seeing the guy that shot the
[34:07.160 --> 34:13.960]  why house and did it because of the obama deception really a film that calls for non-violence a film
[34:13.960 --> 34:19.240]  that points out obama is a puppet three years ago and would betray everything he said he would do
[34:20.200 --> 34:28.520]  really know they're blaming the tucson shooting they're blaming poplotsky the cop killer they're
[34:28.520 --> 34:34.520]  blaming this latest thing on the obama deception we've proven over and over again because they're
[34:34.520 --> 34:40.040]  scared to death of it they're scared to death of our analysis like the three-year-old singing
[34:40.040 --> 34:45.560]  emperors not wearing any clothes and everybody finally points out the obvious i know rocket
[34:45.560 --> 34:52.120]  scientist i know tyranny when it's coming down the road a million miles an hour at me okay now i
[34:52.120 --> 34:56.520]  want to get gerald salentes update on this because as soon as he started blowing the whistle that
[34:56.520 --> 35:02.920]  caused the dam to break it was that it was the straw that broke the camel's uh proverbial back
[35:03.560 --> 35:08.680]  it turned out for almost two weeks going back to early last week they had known that massive
[35:08.680 --> 35:13.480]  amounts of money were missing from mf global that had bought up other solvent firms like the one
[35:13.480 --> 35:19.880]  that gerald salentes had a multi-decade long account with by the way i've now done research
[35:19.880 --> 35:24.920]  and we have the head of mf global and others including federal regulators at the cftc who
[35:24.920 --> 35:30.200]  were invested with mf global and had to recuse himself saying that these funds would be guaranteed
[35:30.200 --> 35:35.400]  through a different system just not fdic so i put that in your pipe and spoke it but here's
[35:35.400 --> 35:40.600]  why gerald salentes joins us i misspoke at the start of the show if you're just trying to mf
[35:40.600 --> 35:46.440]  global into google and click news the first two headlines you get are ap and cnn will put these
[35:46.440 --> 35:54.440]  on screen mf global missing funds may hit 1.2 billion now that was earlier this morning
[35:54.440 --> 36:01.000]  now the trustees come out and said oops it's more than 1.2 billion that's the ap headline
[36:01.000 --> 36:07.400]  and i see another one here saying it might be as high as two plus billion of the six billion
[36:07.400 --> 36:13.560]  that went into bankruptcy with the former globalist goldman sacks alumni new jersey mayor with the
[36:13.560 --> 36:20.520]  head of the cftc invested in it involved with corezine retusing himself a week and a half ago
[36:20.520 --> 36:26.360]  according to roiders and forbes so it's but but but it's not their fault it's gerald salente
[36:27.320 --> 36:33.960]  of trendsresearch.com and alex jones of info wars.com it's our fault erin dykes is riding shotgun in
[36:33.960 --> 36:38.600]  the studio he'll be popping in we've got gerald till five after and then he's leaving and then
[36:38.600 --> 36:44.280]  governor jessie ventura is joining us then max keiser going to gerald salente gerald it's now
[36:44.280 --> 36:50.120]  above 1.2 billion and they're telling uh now they're talking about more than 50 000 customers it
[36:50.120 --> 36:55.560]  was 33 000 you're not going to get anything and they're now saying we thought jp morgan had the
[36:55.560 --> 37:01.560]  money but now we're just going to say it disappeared into the easter bunny patch uh gerald this is all
[37:01.560 --> 37:07.560]  our fault didn't you hear yeah i i get a kick out of these people i said i should have been smarter
[37:07.560 --> 37:12.520]  yeah i should have been smarter it's like walking down the street and somebody blowing your brains
[37:12.520 --> 37:22.040]  out from behind you know if jessie james did this it would be robbery but when john corzine does it
[37:22.040 --> 37:30.280]  oh it was just a mistake how come this guy isn't being even brought in for questioning i just heard
[37:30.280 --> 37:38.680]  senator robits over there saying that it looks like illegal behavior is behind this how come he
[37:38.680 --> 37:46.600]  isn't being brought up where's the perp walk as i said before the press is really easy to judge
[37:46.600 --> 37:54.520]  people prejudge them in the media you don't even hear corzine's name come up anymore we sent out
[37:54.520 --> 38:01.720]  that press release alex that you have about cme group where they said that they guaranteed
[38:01.720 --> 38:11.960]  me the funds and that nobody's ever lost a penny we went out to over 45 000 people in the media
[38:12.760 --> 38:20.600]  none of the major prostitutes will touch it and then i got this letter from this guy this
[38:20.600 --> 38:33.320]  little worm of a man i use the word man loosely his name happens to be jeffrey m christensen christian
[38:33.960 --> 38:42.440]  not to confuse him with jeffrey zero christian and here's what he says about me and talking to
[38:42.440 --> 38:54.440]  people like you that i'm ignorant i'm stupid and i'm delusional and self delusional and that
[38:55.000 --> 39:03.640]  corzine has not done a perp walk because he has not been alleged to have done anything illegal
[39:03.640 --> 39:12.520]  only incredibly stupid hey worm christian if you listen you're incredibly stupid and if you
[39:12.520 --> 39:19.160]  want to talk to me like that face to face come on over and let's have a visit because here's the
[39:19.160 --> 39:29.160]  facts a little worm corzine it is allegedly has done something that is more than just incredibly
[39:29.160 --> 39:37.720]  stupid he has broken the cardinal rule yeah don't go into a customer's private account
[39:38.360 --> 39:47.560]  to go do the firm's gambling yeah get it it's as simple as that this is robbery and no one
[39:47.560 --> 39:56.120]  is calling him out maybe corzine has you know he just held a 35 000 a play dinner for obama
[39:56.120 --> 40:03.240]  a fundraiser maybe he's not showing up because he's preparing a tanksgiving dinner for us
[40:03.880 --> 40:11.960]  you know so we'll all get a little more turkey to eat this little this little twerp going on and
[40:11.960 --> 40:21.000]  on and on and here you'll love this one alex this is a beauty when anyone stops talking about
[40:21.000 --> 40:30.520]  the trilateral here when a man like him meaning me calls others sheeple and speaks of the trilateral
[40:30.520 --> 40:37.720]  commission in the builder bird group i know i can stop listening oh by the way this little
[40:38.760 --> 40:48.600]  weenie worm guy christian the cpm group they said gold wasn't going to go up this year
[40:48.600 --> 40:58.920]  yeah that's right he's so brilliant no trilateral commission no builder bird hey jerk even go on
[40:58.920 --> 41:06.520]  wikipedia look up the names that i was talking about drogy the new head of the european central
[41:06.520 --> 41:19.800]  bank mario three cod monty the new head over there in italy papa damos over there in greece all
[41:19.800 --> 41:28.680]  members of the trilateral commission one drogy is a chief cat with the builder bird it's right there
[41:28.680 --> 41:38.760]  this is a conspiracy this is guys like him that are probably cia agents this is important
[41:39.560 --> 41:45.960]  here is cnn more than 1.2 billion and customer funds might be missing from bankrupt broker
[41:45.960 --> 41:51.720]  emf global now this is going on three weeks now nearly twice previous estimates of the
[41:51.720 --> 41:57.480]  shortfall the trusty administering the firm's bankruptcy said monday and that's who they're
[41:57.480 --> 42:02.040]  saying has the accounts emf global is forced to file for bankruptcy last month effort to close
[42:02.040 --> 42:07.640]  6.3 billion in exposure to troubled sovereign debt from weak european countries sparking panic
[42:07.640 --> 42:14.600]  among investors so of course they have to spin gerald and myself and others pointing this out
[42:14.600 --> 42:20.200]  as if somehow we're bad it's true all of these major bank heads all of these finance ministers
[42:20.200 --> 42:26.280]  all of these prime ministers presidents they're all financed or our actual goldman sacks operatives
[42:26.280 --> 42:31.720]  even time magazine last week said it's a global coup a coup in europe by goldman sacks government
[42:31.720 --> 42:39.720]  buy banksters for banksters but but again now here we are three weeks later she's going back a week
[42:39.720 --> 42:46.760]  and a half ago uh even when we showed these on air even roiders and and and and and forms and others
[42:46.760 --> 42:52.520]  had cftc acting ahead over this investigation because the head is invested in it so had to say
[42:52.520 --> 42:58.280]  you know i'm recused saying this appears to be illegal and something's nefarious but now
[42:59.160 --> 43:03.800]  the media just says well i guess it's it's more than 700 million it's more than a billion it's
[43:03.800 --> 43:09.320]  1.2 billion it's more than 1.2 billion and they admit that it's destabilizing the whole market
[43:09.880 --> 43:15.480]  you have over 1.2 billion or whatever it really is they won't deliver people's money when we're
[43:15.480 --> 43:21.880]  talking about a 800 trillion dollar group in the press release by the cme group that you just
[43:21.880 --> 43:27.480]  mentioned of course they've got to turn it around and have forbes come out and imply we're the bad
[43:27.480 --> 43:33.400]  guys uh folks no one's bank account is safe they've already stolen most your pension funds they've
[43:33.400 --> 43:38.040]  already invested those in derivatives your 401k's it's all admitted your social security it was
[43:38.040 --> 43:44.280]  spent decades ago and here everything is falling apart we've been in a depression for years they
[43:44.280 --> 43:49.320]  keep lying to us but going back Gerald because i don't spend too much time on this guy who is this
[43:49.320 --> 43:57.000]  person you're quoting uh that was making those asinine statements because over over some years
[43:57.000 --> 44:04.520]  it's 60 some years it's over 70 of the 125 people 130 or so that are in Bilderberg are Goldman Sachs
[44:04.520 --> 44:09.960]  i mean no one denies now from the financial times of london to time magazine that it's a global
[44:09.960 --> 44:14.040]  government of foreign by the bankster so i don't want to spend all day on this guy because he's not
[44:14.040 --> 44:20.040]  worth the time is this some analyst that attacked you who is this person this guy's the head of the
[44:20.040 --> 44:30.600]  cpm group they're they're gonna start barraging us with negative with negative news to try to
[44:30.600 --> 44:40.760]  discredit us when in the meantime corezine where's corezine where is this guy he's not even look where
[44:40.760 --> 44:48.280]  we as i said you know when dominique Strauss-Kahn was accused of allegedly false you know uh
[44:48.280 --> 44:53.960]  having sex with a maid boy the press jumped on that one all over the place gave him a purple
[44:53.960 --> 45:00.280]  one you know it was staged yeah and yeah now where is corezine how come he's not showing up
[45:00.280 --> 45:05.480]  so and i'm with the reason i'm bringing this up and you mentioned about forbes try this one on
[45:05.480 --> 45:15.800]  everybody go to forbes 2009 they made fun of me then one of my assistants at the time cashed out her
[45:15.800 --> 45:27.080]  401k and bought gold at 700 an ounce they said she was overreacting gold is at 1700 an ounce now
[45:27.080 --> 45:33.320]  what an overreaction and not even a retraction they're going to do everything they can do now
[45:33.320 --> 45:38.680]  to try to discredit us because the whole system is going down and they misquoted me in there
[45:40.440 --> 45:44.920]  it's not really a correction you may not have read the forbes article he actually admits that
[45:44.920 --> 45:50.760]  you were right about that and so they must be listening and it said well the uh it's a weird
[45:50.760 --> 45:55.080]  article i mean they're kind of framing us for any problems that may come but then they also admit
[45:55.080 --> 45:59.320]  that you've been right and that i've been right so you might want to go see that article i know you've
[45:59.320 --> 46:05.240]  made a point out of that but they say that she did it at 900 and that it basically doubled but i
[46:05.240 --> 46:10.920]  remember it was 700 so it's more than doubled now yeah but alex i want i want to follow up on this
[46:11.560 --> 46:17.800]  because it's very important they misquoted me and i'm saying this and the reason i'm going so public
[46:17.800 --> 46:27.640]  with this is that the entire global financial system is melting down what's the stocks doing
[46:27.640 --> 46:34.120]  over in europe what are they doing in the united states they can't solve these problems i said
[46:34.680 --> 46:43.080]  if your money's with schwaab if it's with reagan james i don't care who is with smith barney if
[46:43.080 --> 46:50.040]  this thing collapses you're going to get shafted oh they're going to tell you that you have insurance
[46:50.040 --> 46:57.560]  just like the cme said that ours was guaranteed yeah it'll be guaranteed and you know when you
[46:57.560 --> 47:04.600]  get it i guarantee you'll get it after you're dead because that's how long it's going to take
[47:04.600 --> 47:10.920]  and if you get your money before then it's going to be devalued into nothing and they're going to
[47:10.920 --> 47:16.520]  say it's your fault for being in a pension or a stock market just like his sequestered account
[47:16.520 --> 47:20.680]  segregated account under the wall that was his was taken they're going to say it's your fault
[47:20.680 --> 47:25.720]  when you complain they're going to say you caused the market to fall now now now gerald i want to
[47:25.720 --> 47:30.280]  get into where you're going with this but i think now it's confirmed as you said as i said last week
[47:30.280 --> 47:35.000]  this is way bigger than 700 million it's way bigger than 1.2 million they're now admitting
[47:35.000 --> 47:41.240]  and this is about physical delivery as max keiser predicted they could not deliver the gold to people
[47:41.240 --> 47:46.520]  that had won it in the open market and so they simply defaulted and instead of even paying you
[47:46.520 --> 47:52.760]  in cash they just said you know what that's the way it is and then now it's kind of creepy to have
[47:52.760 --> 48:00.680]  the biggest uh uh derivatives kingpins i forgot that that guy is actually attacking you and to
[48:00.680 --> 48:08.200]  have forms coming after us we must have really hit a nerve how do we hear a nerve alex the cme group
[48:08.200 --> 48:13.720]  the group over there where that guy duffy says that they guarantee everything they've lost over
[48:13.720 --> 48:23.880]  2.5 billion dollars in equity share since this thing happens i'd like to see it go down to zero
[48:24.840 --> 48:33.400]  cme maybe it's the chicago mafia enterprise where is the money duffy that you said you were going
[48:33.400 --> 48:39.240]  to guarantee how come the prostitutes aren't calling them out on this and i'll tell you why
[48:39.240 --> 48:45.240]  because maybe they don't have the money and i'm here's a scenario i'm gonna give you a scoop
[48:45.960 --> 48:52.200]  i'm it was saving this to the top trends of 2011 but i'm letting you know this because of all the
[48:52.200 --> 48:57.560]  listeners there that are faithful to your show and want to know what's going to happen before it
[48:57.560 --> 49:06.840]  happens you go back alex to when obama was elected i said prepare for a bank holiday
[49:06.840 --> 49:16.440]  what happened is i'm doing research in the corezine thing there it pops up with joe biden
[49:17.000 --> 49:23.000]  you remember he was head of uh he was senator from that state of uh the loophole state over
[49:23.000 --> 49:28.120]  there in delaware that gives all these corporations a free ride before he became vice president
[49:28.760 --> 49:34.840]  he's out there campaigning for corezine in his aborted effort to get reelected as governor
[49:34.840 --> 49:44.280]  and big joe puts his arm around corezine and he said biden said you know it was talk about a bank
[49:44.280 --> 49:53.160]  holiday when we came into office they were discussing it and we brought in joe to advise us
[49:53.160 --> 50:02.280]  i'm saying this because the entire system is collapsing i believe they're going to keep propping
[50:02.280 --> 50:11.800]  it up until after christmas so they can sucker everybody into spending money that they don't have
[50:11.800 --> 50:19.720]  and buying a lot of christmas crap that they don't need and after that scam is over bam it's
[50:19.720 --> 50:26.840]  gonna come down because the entire global financial system is collapsing and if anybody
[50:26.840 --> 50:36.600]  with anything between their heads think that sarcozine miracle dragui papademos are going to
[50:36.600 --> 50:45.480]  solve this problem along with the super committee i love it the super committee a house of fools
[50:45.480 --> 50:48.920]  are going to solve this problem you're going to get what you deserve

[53:15.240 --> 53:21.320]  sheep-like and passive frozen like deer and headlights of an oncoming car waiting for others
[53:21.320 --> 53:27.160]  for help one out of ten will actually panic and endanger family and friends as they melt down
[53:27.160 --> 53:33.480]  and only one out of ten will take swift and decisive action when the going gets tough dramatically
[53:33.480 --> 53:38.600]  increasing their chances of survival folks i've just read a new book called ready for anything
[53:38.600 --> 53:43.800]  it's a must read for anyone who wants to increase their chances of survival in the coming hard times
[53:43.800 --> 53:49.720]  ahead to read more about this important new book go to ready for anything manual dot com that's

[53:56.280 --> 54:00.360]  com that's ready for anything manual dot com
[54:19.960 --> 54:25.640]  here's a two-head line from the street super committee failure won't hit u.s rating agency
[54:25.640 --> 54:29.800]  won't lower rating again. Remember, you heard Geithner, six months before they lowered it
[54:29.800 --> 54:35.320]  from AAA plus to AAA. He said there's no way that would happen. And of course, it did happen.
[54:35.880 --> 54:42.920]  It just goes on and on. So this is becoming a huge issue. And imagine the magnitude of this,
[54:42.920 --> 54:47.000]  where you've got people's own private accounts and they just take them. And now we learn it's
[54:47.000 --> 54:52.920]  1.2 billion. And remember, all these mega banks and brokerage firms have gotten tens of trillions
[54:52.920 --> 54:57.400]  of our taxpayer money. And now they want more, more, more. At five after Jesse Ventura is joining
[54:57.400 --> 55:01.000]  us, we're about to go back to Gerald Salente and get the comments from Aaron Dykes, who's riding
[55:01.000 --> 55:08.040]  shotgun. But I just also want to point out that Gerald's right. It's time to support alternative
[55:08.040 --> 55:14.520]  media, which is growing and being attacked, obviously. It's time to subscribe at trendsresearch.com.
[55:14.520 --> 55:23.320]  It's time to get all 18 of my films that are on DVD for $260 off or $99.95 at infowars.com.
[55:23.320 --> 55:27.240]  We're on the front lines of the fight against tyranny and we need your support. Get the Obama
[55:27.240 --> 55:32.840]  deception on DVD. We sell it very inexpensively with expanded extras at infowars.com. Or you
[55:32.840 --> 55:37.960]  can see it and download it at www.prisonplanet.tv. The system is scared of this information. We
[55:37.960 --> 55:42.680]  couldn't do it without you, the listeners, our AM and FM affiliates and their local sponsors.
[55:42.680 --> 55:50.360]  Just all of you that support us and, of course, our sponsors. Again, we have inserted a few days,
[55:50.360 --> 55:55.800]  15-day free trial, www.prisonplanet.tv to also see the nightly news. We've got hosting the
[55:55.800 --> 55:59.800]  nightly news tonight. The health ranger, Mike Adams, is going to be breaking down some incredible
[55:59.800 --> 56:04.360]  info on the Super Committee. Now it's going to control legislation. On the Farm Bill,
[56:04.360 --> 56:08.360]  Dondee Mills originate with individual House members. We have a 12-member committee with a
[56:08.360 --> 56:13.960]  13th leader. Now, General, this is a short segment. One more coming up. Looking at this,
[56:13.960 --> 56:20.200]  I mean, it's asinine, the mind job, the con job they do trying to spin it around against us.
[56:20.200 --> 56:25.400]  Obviously, that's not going to work. So, as you said, this is obviously much bigger than what
[56:25.400 --> 56:31.000]  they were first saying. Where does it go? How does he get away with this? They're taking his name
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.040]  out of the news instead of just doing a rehabilitation job because obviously that didn't work. But when
[56:36.040 --> 56:42.360]  all these heads of federal agencies that protected Madoff for 11 years are caught in bed with Corzine,
[56:42.360 --> 56:46.040]  I mean, I guess at a certain point it's just total criminal takeover. What do you do?
[56:47.000 --> 56:52.600]  Well, again, what we're warning is the high probability that there's going to be some type
[56:52.600 --> 56:58.760]  of economic martial law. And just like I couldn't get my money, it has nothing to do with Corzine.
[56:58.760 --> 57:05.320]  He's just one of the Goldman Sachs gang. And the Goldman Sachs gang, as I said on your show,
[57:05.320 --> 57:13.160]  the Rothschilds would be envious to see what the Goldman Sachs reaches. So, what I'm saying is
[57:13.160 --> 57:18.280]  there's going to be some level of martial law. I'm not economic martial law. I'm not telling
[57:18.280 --> 57:23.480]  anybody what to do. I always make this clear. Think for yourself. But for me, I'm not having
[57:23.480 --> 57:28.920]  any money where anybody can get their hands on it. Gold, silver, dollars, I don't care what they are.
[57:28.920 --> 57:34.200]  And the other thing too, Alex, all of those police out there that are beating up and pepper
[57:34.200 --> 57:43.560]  spraying the people. Guess what, guys? Now hear this. You're going to lose your pensions. That's
[57:43.560 --> 57:50.680]  right. You know that retirement that you're looking for? You're not going to get it because the whole
[57:50.680 --> 57:58.760]  thing's going down. And it's not only MF global. It was Lehman, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch,
[57:58.760 --> 58:04.200]  you name it, one after another that needed to get bailed out and went under. And your money's
[58:04.200 --> 58:11.400]  going to go too. So you're beating up the wrong people. All you guys that are protecting the
[58:11.400 --> 58:19.640]  Wall Street mob, you should be protecting your family, your friends, and yourself because you're
[58:19.640 --> 58:27.080]  going to get it, boy. That baton you're beating people with, you better not bend over because
[58:27.080 --> 58:34.040]  the white shoe boys are ready to stick it to you, cops. They're going to make mincemeat out of you.
[58:42.760 --> 58:46.840]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[1:00:02.920 --> 1:00:11.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:11.240 --> 1:00:17.320]  All right, Jesse Ventura scheduled to be with us with a lot of breaking news and information
[1:00:17.320 --> 1:00:21.960]  coming up in the next segment. Gerald's wonderful. That's for another five minutes. I appreciate
[1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:27.400]  spending so much time with the eFoodsThreak.com family. Gerald, you were on fire there. You know,
[1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:32.600]  what's incredible is they've hired a lot of sociopaths now and I see the police now have
[1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:39.000]  an article at eFoodsThreak.com. Gerald's saying that they're now charging people resisting arrest
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:44.120]  that if they start beating you with a billy club, you do not cover your face and they're
[1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:50.360]  charging people who are in field positions now. That's resisting. So, I mean, it's like they're
[1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:56.120]  trying to put people in life in prison for videotaping cops in public in Illinois. We have a criminal
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:01:01.160]  government and now the bankers that own it are going to steal everybody's bank accounts.
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:05.160]  And even though the cops are going to lose everything, I predict just because of the uniform
[1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:09.240]  of the power trip, a lot of them are going to go ahead and enjoy it and thank their masters.
[1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:13.800]  The good ones are just going to get out, which is part of the plan. So, it's a pure army of evil.
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:19.880]  I mean, I don't see how if they put criminals in every position where they can just publicly do
[1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:25.400]  all of this, the sky is the limit. I mean, this is so incredible. It's so clear, Gerald,
[1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:30.520]  that Homeland Security has been set up so the bankers can carry out this orderly gang rape.
[1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:36.360]  All right. You know, Alex, remember, remember the one thing people don't like to get it in the
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:44.200]  pocketbook. It becomes a gut issue, an empty gut issue. Everyone out there that's listening.
[1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:50.120]  If you know a cop, let them know that they're not going to be getting their pensions if things
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:55.560]  continue the way they are. And the people that are protesting are the ones that are going to
[1:01:55.560 --> 1:02:01.400]  save their pensions. So, just let them know. The other thing too, of course, I've been getting
[1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:07.480]  warnings, watch for the three or four AM raid because they're out to get to take me out.
[1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:12.200]  And then finally, what I really want to make a point on this, Alex, and drive it home,
[1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:21.880]  this release we sent out, those CME group guarantees, there are no guarantees. Again,
[1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:27.160]  it's not the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It appears from what they've written here
[1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:35.800]  that the correct abbreviation for CME is the Chicago Mafia Enterprise. Because here's what
[1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:42.840]  Duffy, the vice chairman of that company says, I want to make this 100% clear to everyone so you
[1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:50.440]  know how you're going to get shafted when it hits you. Quote, no customer has ever lost a penny
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:56.680]  as a result of a clearing member default. More than a penny's been lost. Number one.
[1:02:57.560 --> 1:03:06.600]  Number two, quote, since we are the guarantor of every transaction that happens in our markets,
[1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:13.880]  we have to guarantee the performance of each and every one of these contracts.
[1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:21.640]  To do this, we hold more than 100 billion of collateral to support the transactions
[1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:30.920]  that are being done on our markets. Where's the money? Where's the guarantee? I say either Duffy,
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:38.200]  put it up or you don't have it. Oh, and you cops out there that are beating up people for resisting
[1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:44.360]  the rest. How about going after cause nine? Well, they're bought and paid for. Let me throw this
[1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:48.040]  in in closing and obviously we're going to update from you, Gerald, tomorrow. If you can do it,
[1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:52.680]  you've been very gracious with your time. I want to expand on this. You're not going to commit
[1:03:52.680 --> 1:03:57.800]  suicide. I'm not going to commit suicide. They could send SWAT teams in and show you resisted.
[1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:01.240]  So are you getting threats or are you getting warnings or both? What's happening?
[1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:10.680]  Mostly warnings. Mostly warnings. Watch for the three a.m. raid because that's when they like
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:18.360]  to do it. When your deepest sleep and your equilibrium is off. Yeah, there's no suicide.
[1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:26.120]  This guy's life. No, no, they're going to come after us. Alex, the white shoe boys don't like
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:32.120]  the money junkies. Don't like anybody messing with their to take their fix away from them.
[1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:38.280]  So things are going to get worse before they get better. And as I said, everyone out there,
[1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:43.720]  you know, a cop, let them know they're going to get that for time where they're not going to like
[1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:48.760]  it. All right, Gerald Salente, trustresearch.com. Thank you. Jesse Ventura straight ahead. Stay with us.
[1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:54.520]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[1:04:54.520 --> 1:05:01.400]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says that the state
[1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:06.360]  is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police
[1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:12.360]  states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[1:05:12.360 --> 1:05:17.800]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[1:05:17.800 --> 1:05:22.520]  has established an old powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening
[1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:27.880]  depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency
[1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:34.040]  dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every
[1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:39.240]  street corner. It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan. The police state
[1:05:39.240 --> 1:05:46.600]  isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest

[1:05:57.320 --> 1:06:02.440]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[1:06:02.440 --> 1:06:09.240]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[1:06:09.240 --> 1:06:17.560]  They so pride in every stitch. Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:27.160]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it.
[1:06:28.120 --> 1:06:35.320]  Others don't. We turn jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled
[1:06:35.320 --> 1:06:40.680]  quality. Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you

[1:06:48.360 --> 1:06:54.440]  don't. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:06:54.440 --> 1:06:59.560]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:04.440]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[1:07:04.440 --> 1:07:10.120]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:15.080]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now,
[1:07:15.080 --> 1:07:20.600]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always
[1:07:20.600 --> 1:07:25.080]  a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[1:07:25.080 --> 1:07:30.200]  onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:34.200]  mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:40.120]  one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's
[1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:45.800]  mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:55.960]  or call 1-877-327-0365. From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines,
[1:07:55.960 --> 1:08:01.560]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:04.760 --> 1:08:08.040]  You know, I'm going to be honest with you, ladies and gentlemen. It's pretty creepy
[1:08:08.680 --> 1:08:14.040]  to have the New York Times saying my film, The Obama Deception, is responsible for the guy that
[1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:18.280]  shot the White House. And all I do is point out that Obama's a puppet in the two-party systems
[1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:24.040]  to come afraud. Or that Forbes has come out and blamed myself and Gerald Salente saying,
[1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:29.000]  we're going to cause runs on banks when mega brokerage firms are taking people's private
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:35.800]  accounts and CNN admits it's destroying confidence. It's still somehow our fault. It is so creepy.
[1:08:35.800 --> 1:08:40.120]  I'm going to get Governor Ventura's take on that a lot more. He joins us to give us the latest
[1:08:40.760 --> 1:08:46.280]  on his fight. Really, it's all of our fight. Fordue process for the 10th Amendment, for the
[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:51.720]  4th Amendment, with the TSA now expanding out. They have announced, and I did confirm,
[1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:57.000]  we got a tip last week, they are going to be in Mall of America starting next February.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:01.480]  And you'll see this announced in the news, probably in January. But I have talked to insiders of
[1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:06.760]  Mall of America. TSA has put out press releases, video press releases, showing them in malls
[1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:13.000]  and at football games, NFL football games with the Buccaneers. And those articles are all posted
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:17.800]  with the videos at infowars.com. But I'll get Governor Ventura's take on that. He lives up
[1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:23.240]  there. So I wonder, he can't go to the mall now. They're also putting in jumbo drawn
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:28.360]  telescreens saying, don't trust anybody, but they exist. So we've got that happening. We're
[1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:33.000]  going to get Governor Ventura's take on the protest, not just here, but overseas.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:38.600]  Egyptian military justifies murder of protesters by pointing to American cops. That's an actual
[1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:46.200]  headline. Here's another one that breaks it down. Curling up in a ball to avoid police violence
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:51.240]  may be considered active resistance. They've got a police commander here on tape who defended
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:55.640]  police that beat people in field positions in the head with batons and sprayed them with pepper
[1:09:55.640 --> 1:10:01.880]  spray as saying that is resistance to curl up. If you raise an arm to block when they billy club
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:08.280]  you, that is resistance. I mean, this is so comical now. It's like, oh, what's that case we saw
[1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:13.560]  but life in prison for filming police in Illinois. Now I got thrown out of court, but the point is
[1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:18.600]  they keep trying it. Governor Jesse Ventura best selling author obviously hit TV show
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:25.000]  conspiracy theory. New season almost a complete big shot coming up next year. Jesse, what is it
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:31.080]  like for you, Governor? I mean, I feel like I've woken up in the twilight zone. What do you think
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:36.600]  so well? Let me have this from your initial comments of them blaming you and blaming people
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:42.520]  that take things to the public. That's an old standard play. That's called kill the messenger,
[1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:49.560]  not the message. They don't want to talk about what you're saying. They just want to go after
[1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:56.840]  you for saying it. That's a typical play. I don't know. I'd like to think people are smarter
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:11:02.200]  than that. I'd like to think people see through nonsense like that where when there is a whistle
[1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:08.920]  blower, when they attack a whistle blower, well, if there was no information to give,
[1:11:08.920 --> 1:11:14.280]  there wouldn't be whistle blowers. If there wasn't bad things going on, there wouldn't be whistle
[1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:20.520]  blowers. So, you know, just buckle up on that. That's the old standard play, kill the messenger,
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:26.680]  not the message, and how they can possibly blame you and people like you who simply, you know,
[1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:31.880]  put out information. Hey, if your information is untrue, well, then it'll be untrue and it'll come
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:37.080]  out through the wash being untrue. But if it is true, then how can, you know, I wouldn't worry about
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:41.640]  it. No, I agree, Governor, but it's just like the national media turned it around against you
[1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:47.240]  when you stood up for our 10th and 4th Amendment, when UWU did, they pretty much unanimously attacked
[1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:51.960]  you because they know over 90% of people agree with you. They're scared. Even if they make us
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:59.080]  respond, they now get us off the offensive and exposing them. I agree. It's just still totally
[1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:04.760]  creepy and weird that, you know, headline Forbes Magazine, talk show host Alex Jones
[1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:09.880]  and guest call for bank runs. No, we pointed out that they've taken now over a billion,
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:15.880]  two hundred million dollars of people's private accounts at MF Global with the former New Jersey
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:21.240]  Governor Corzine running it and Goldman Sachs and all them involved. And then you come out and talk
[1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:24.840]  about it and say, boy, I guess your money's not saving the bank. And then they turn it around.
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:28.920]  It just shows they have nothing but contempt for the public. And I agree with you, Governor.
[1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:32.120]  I think people are starting to wake up. I think people are really starting to see through it
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:38.200]  because the bologna has gotten so thick. I don't know. I'd like to hope so. But, you know, I'm doing
[1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:44.280]  a lot of interviews again dealing with my court case. And I'm still getting a lot of resistance
[1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:50.920]  of people with this attitude. Well, we haven't been attacked now in 10 years. So it's a good thing
[1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:57.560]  what they're doing at airports. It's a good thing that we're frisking down 95 year old women and
[1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:02.840]  taking their depends. It's a good thing when we're grabbing in the crotches of little children because
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:08.760]  after all, it's keeping us all safe and we haven't been attacked again. And I mean, these are the
[1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:14.440]  people I don't know if it's the fluoride in the water or what has done it to them. But, you know,
[1:13:14.440 --> 1:13:21.400]  they're doing exactly what Ben Franklin warned when Ben Franklin warned us that those who will
[1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:28.120]  give up their liberty for security shall deserve and have neither because, you know, you're not going
[1:13:28.120 --> 1:13:34.200]  to be free and be made safe. People need to understand that that was the great thing about our
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:41.080]  country was this bill of rights and constitution that allow you to come here and not be oppressed
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:47.800]  by government. Yes, it makes it makes you dependent upon yourself. You have to have self-reliance to
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:55.480]  achieve, but that's good. And for our country to lose that, well, then we're nothing special anymore
[1:13:55.480 --> 1:14:01.480]  and we're losing it because we're allowing judges and we're allowing the judicial system and our
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:07.240]  elected system and our executive branch to literally trample and destroy the constitution
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:12.200]  and the bill of rights and these candidates that you have out there, you know, that claim
[1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:18.200]  they're constitutional and this and that. Well, on the Republican side, in my opinion, half of them
[1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:24.120]  are disillusioned because they're sitting here telling us God told them to run. And anybody
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:29.000]  that makes that statement to me, I look at them like they're insane because they obviously are,
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:34.360]  you know, have voices in their heads, you know, a lot like what I'm one of my conspiracies I'm
[1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:39.400]  looking into this year is the fact that are they doing that to people? Are they putting,
[1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:44.440]  you know, sounds and words and thoughts in the people's minds? That's one of our conspiracies.
[1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:48.600]  Well, maybe the answer is true. Maybe they're doing it to half of the Republican candidates.
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:53.080]  Well, you know, they have some sat-in, they have some people on this bill,
[1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:57.800]  tongue and cheek and sarcastic. Sure, they do have systems as I know you're going to cover on
[1:14:57.800 --> 1:15:02.840]  the show. Since the fifties in Japan, they have coke machines that, you know, soft drink machines
[1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:07.880]  that actually broadcast directly to the enter here. And it turns out governments have used those
[1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:13.240]  in tests to try to drive people crazy. But the public center trance and some of them that have
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:17.800]  woken up feel powerless. So they go ahead and say who cares? In fact, I'll briefly tell you a story.
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:23.480]  I was at the Grand Canyon yesterday, governor, and 14 years ago I've been there and shown how
[1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:27.320]  our land have been signed over to the UN as collateral to the big banks.
[1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:31.400]  And just like they've done in Greece and places, so I went back to the visitor center to show the
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:36.280]  plaque. They've torn down the old visitor center built a giant sprawling complex, but there's the
[1:15:36.280 --> 1:15:43.160]  plaque still. And I start shooting a video. One minute in, a guy walks up with a, you know,
[1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:49.640]  blues windbreaker on with American flags and stuff all over it. And he stops. There's nobody around
[1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:53.400]  me. I'm not through the parking lot. He stops while I'm shooting a video. One minute in,
[1:15:53.400 --> 1:15:58.520]  it's up on YouTube right now. And he says, hold on, honey. I gotta see what this guy's saying.
[1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:02.360]  And he goes, oh, this guy needs to shut up. You know, I'm going to take a photo of this.
[1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:07.960]  And he steps in front of me because he didn't like hearing me talk about the UN and the global
[1:16:07.960 --> 1:16:14.200]  banks. He didn't want to believe that America was in trouble. He saw me as unpatriotic for wanting
[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:19.560]  to defend my country. He thinks patriotism is just being a violent city.
[1:16:23.560 --> 1:16:28.360]  What'd you say, Gav? I said he believes patriotism is going along to get along.
[1:16:28.360 --> 1:16:33.400]  Yes, that's it. You know, and that's the worst thing. I mean, Tom Jefferson told us dissensions,
[1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:39.880]  the greatest form of patriotism. I can tell you, in all my experience of being a mayor and a governor,
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:48.920]  they govern best when the public participates. They govern best when the public criticizes
[1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:55.560]  and puts them under the microscope. They govern worst when they're allowed to do what they want.
[1:16:55.560 --> 1:17:01.080]  And the public becomes apathetic and the public doesn't care. That's when you will get your
[1:17:01.080 --> 1:17:07.240]  worst government. You get your best government when you hold their feet to the fire. And people
[1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:12.760]  better wake up to that. If they throw their hands up in the air and say, well, there's nothing I
[1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:19.240]  can do about it. Well, that's exactly the reaction that they want you to do. You're playing right
[1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:25.320]  into their game when you do that. You know, I saw a film a few months ago called The Conspirators,
[1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:29.800]  and it's basically a true story by Robert Redford about the trial after the killing
[1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:35.080]  of Lincoln at the Ford Theater. And I forget the name of the briefing, but callers have made
[1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:40.440]  that point. It's not popping in my head to minute. But there is a system, and it's shown at the end
[1:17:40.440 --> 1:17:47.320]  of the film, Governor, where they go ahead and stand the Secretary of Defense or war, goes ahead
[1:17:47.320 --> 1:17:52.520]  and orders the woman executed, even though she's been found not guilty by the military tribunal.
[1:17:52.520 --> 1:18:04.120]  And basically, it's kicked up past the tribunal to a higher judge to call for another trial,
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:09.800]  but the stand ignores that and hangs her. But they have the term there, and I looked it up in
[1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:14.840]  federal law. There is a way, even if that judge sat on that and claimed that, that your lawyer
[1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:23.640]  can kick it up and force the tribunal to at least respond to it and say they'll hear it or not,
[1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:27.000]  and then put something public on the record. Has your lawyer talked about that?
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:32.280]  No, because it's a catch-22, because there's also something they don't tell you in my case.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:41.640]  The day you file the lawsuit, you have 60 days in which to appeal it. Well, the judge sat on it
[1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:47.160]  for six months before she had the hearing, and then three more months before she ruled on it.
[1:18:47.160 --> 1:18:53.000]  So if I take it to the Court of Appeals, it gives them the perfect way out. All they have to do,
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.960]  then, is rule out the statute of limitations ran out.
[1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:01.480]  Incredible, but I mean, the catch-22 doesn't look a year and a half ago.
[1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:07.880]  You can't win either way. The point is, Alex, the bottom line is this. Our government does not
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:15.160]  respect us, the citizens enough, to allow us to make a decision on what's constitutional
[1:19:15.160 --> 1:19:21.960]  and what is not. You're right. They do not want any constitutional issue going before a jury,
[1:19:22.680 --> 1:19:29.640]  because they cannot control a jury. And if a jury rules in the favor in my case, well,
[1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:35.560]  that could open up Pandora's box on them, because then there would be a precedence in court. So
[1:19:35.560 --> 1:19:40.600]  the easiest way to defend that is through what they call this administrative law ruling. Yes,
[1:19:40.600 --> 1:19:46.360]  sir. Stay there. Which was back in the days of Woodrow Wilson, when he wanted to bring in the
[1:19:46.360 --> 1:19:53.480]  damn Federal Reserve. Stay there, Gov. As we age, we lose both strength and muscle mass.
[1:19:53.480 --> 1:19:58.920]  Undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows is nature's most powerful food to gain back lost
[1:19:58.920 --> 1:20:04.120]  muscle. Virtually all whey protein powders or drinks have been damaged during processing or
[1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:09.320]  are high in sugar. This damaged whey causes a significant loss in the ability of the body to
[1:20:09.320 --> 1:20:14.200]  build new muscle proteins. The high sugar content will stop all the benefits of your
[1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:20.200]  growth hormone from causing muscle repair. By giving your body easily absorbed, undamaged whey,
[1:20:20.200 --> 1:20:25.080]  free of added sugar, you may be able to gain back lost muscle and strength. One world whey is
[1:20:25.080 --> 1:20:30.520]  truly undamaged whey protein powder, free of added sugar. Both young and elderly are reporting
[1:20:30.520 --> 1:20:36.600]  increases in muscle strength and size without any additional exercise. Go to oneworldwhey.com.

[1:21:58.840 --> 1:22:05.000]  I've said on his program before that studies show that in a true crisis, 8 out of 10 people
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:10.680]  will remain sheep-like and passive, frozen like deer and headlights of an oncoming car,
[1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:16.120]  waiting for others for help. 1 out of 10 will actually panic and endanger family and friends
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:22.520]  as they melt down. And only 1 out of 10 will take swift and decisive action when the going gets

[1:23:52.920 --> 1:23:58.600]  The butcher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold guy.
[1:23:58.600 --> 1:24:02.200]  We're going to get into a host of other issues with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:06.840]  You can get his best-selling book. That's amazing. 63 documents. The government doesn't want you to
[1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:13.720]  read at infowars.com or bookstores everywhere. By the way, Governor, you've also got your
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:17.880]  own site. We'll plug that here in a moment, but the governor had something key. When I was flying
[1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:21.560]  out of Las Vegas a month ago, when I was out there shooting some interviews and doing some
[1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:27.640]  investigations with Ventura with Jesse, when I'm flying out, they had me in the business class,
[1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:32.440]  so I got to go to the short line, but everybody's body scanned at that one. I didn't know that.
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:38.600]  So I come out on the other end of the trap and say, I'm not body scanning, so they call me over.
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:42.760]  I start telling them that's going to give you cancer. They're like, no, it isn't. And then he
[1:24:42.760 --> 1:24:48.440]  says, I've got to do this. It's my administrative right, or you're going to face the other consequences,
[1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:53.000]  which are now, they try to arrest you and stuff. And I said, well, I do this under
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:58.680]  distress. He goes, it's my administrative right as the gropelage began. And people are like, well,
[1:24:58.680 --> 1:25:02.840]  why'd you go through it? I wanted to experience it. Kind of like, I guess when Jesse was learning
[1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:07.000]  how to be tortured, nothing compared to that. But I wanted to actually see what was going on.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:10.680]  Plus, I wanted to get home to my family. I had about three hours sleep, but he said,
[1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:16.920]  this is administrative. And he goes, it's my administrative right. And his eyes literally
[1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:21.960]  twinkled with that power. So I guess his administrative power will also protect him
[1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:25.720]  from the radiation, which the TSA has been caught lying about. Governor?
[1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:31.400]  Well, that's just it. It's called, he hit the nail on the head, Alex. I learned from my court case,
[1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:37.000]  it's called an administrative law ruling. And it was back in the days of Woodrow Wilson when
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:43.640]  they created the Federal Reserve, as we all know, our Constitution clearly states there will be no
[1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:49.880]  central bank. So the way they looped that was Wilson back then created these administrative
[1:25:49.880 --> 1:25:55.320]  law rulings that the president does. And apparently our courts have let them stand up
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:26:01.720]  to where they looped the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. And that's how their TSA is able
[1:26:01.720 --> 1:26:07.800]  to do. And this guy's able to say that to you because what happened was George Bush did the
[1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:15.880]  same thing in creating the TSA. He did it under a presidential thing where he signs it. And therefore,
[1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:22.360]  it makes it exempt from the Bill of Rights of the Constitution. It allows it to loop the law.
[1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:28.120]  It's called an administrative law ruling. And that's exactly the essence of my court case,
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:33.720]  of why I am not allowed to go to court to determine whether my Fourth Amendment rights are being
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:42.760]  violated. And here's all they do. The Congress then passes this and gives the TSA the ruling of,
[1:26:42.760 --> 1:26:50.200]  okay, don't make our airports safe. Well, when they give them that instruction, that means they
[1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:56.440]  got carte blanche. They can do anything they want to do to allegedly make the airports safe.
[1:26:56.440 --> 1:27:02.200]  And you have no control. You have no Constitution or Bill of Rights protection at airports.
[1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:08.680]  And the other thing that you need to bottom is, like it was stated by my attorney, and here's
[1:27:08.680 --> 1:27:14.840]  another interesting thing, Alex. When they rule against you is what federal judge Nelson did to
[1:27:14.840 --> 1:27:22.200]  me. They don't even do it face to face. They send you an email. I mean, how pathetic and
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:28.760]  how cowardly is that? They won't even bring you into court, sit down, look you in the eye and
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:33.400]  tell you why you can't go to court. They send you an email. But let me read what the order of the
[1:27:33.400 --> 1:27:39.400]  my old attorney, he said, her order dismissing our case for lack of jurisdiction reads much like
[1:27:39.400 --> 1:27:45.160]  the government's brief and does not directly address the gist of our argument regarding the
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:52.920]  constitutional absurdity of being subject to a secret order that can be changed in secret at
[1:27:52.920 --> 1:28:00.680]  any time and without notice and cannot be challenged in a district court. Unbelievable. Now, that's
[1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:07.960]  he ruled in favor of that. And so when you go to an airport, you don't even know what the rules are.
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:13.720]  They don't even have to tell you. So you got all these little guys like that guy you ran into
[1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:21.480]  who are kings of their own domain. In essence, he can do anything he wants there. And you can't
[1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:28.920]  know the rules. He can grope you anywhere. He can take you in a back room. Hey, if I was a pedophile,
[1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:33.240]  I'd get a job doing this in a minute. Well, they've caught a lot of them doing that. But that's key
[1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:38.360]  what you just said, because they admit now over 2 million Americans are on the no fly list, no way
[1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:43.960]  to get off of it, won't tell you why you're on it. That whole thing is secret. No judge, no jury,
[1:28:43.960 --> 1:28:48.920]  the end of our entire system, they put three year old kids on it. Now they're saying to drive down the
[1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:52.520]  highway, you're going to have to have their authorization. Well, that's they'll do it with
[1:28:52.520 --> 1:28:58.040]  these administrative law rulings until we as a people stand up and tell them enough of this.
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:05.800]  Well, that's what I'm saying. China. What's that? Exactly. I'm saying no due process,
[1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:10.040]  worse than China. And they just say administratively, we say you can't fly. And now they're
[1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:16.040]  saying they're going to have an administrative no gun by list, Governor. I wouldn't doubt it for a
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:22.520]  minute. Every every one of our constitutional Bill of Rights is being assaulted by our very elected
[1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:28.920]  officials by them allowing them to do this. I want to finish up with this. I get into JFK anniversary
[1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:42.680]  all this stuff coming up. Stay with us, Jesse. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.

[1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:11.720]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[1:31:11.720 --> 1:31:17.720]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:31:17.720 --> 1:31:24.200]  nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[1:31:24.200 --> 1:31:29.160]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the
[1:31:29.160 --> 1:31:33.880]  Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right

[1:33:03.800 --> 1:33:07.320]  Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest. We're going to get into a host of other issues.
[1:33:07.320 --> 1:33:11.400]  Aaron Dyches is also up there at the network riding shotgun. I know he's going to pop in
[1:33:11.400 --> 1:33:16.440]  in a few minutes with a question for Jesse Ventura on the TSA. Aaron has to fly a lot
[1:33:16.440 --> 1:33:21.240]  shooting interviews for my films and believe me he used to like to travel. Now he's like do I have
[1:33:21.240 --> 1:33:27.080]  to go on the road and I at a certain point I have to morally say no you don't. Here's the company RV
[1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:34.120]  but now they're going to set up highway checkpoints. Now this dovetails into the protesters being
[1:33:34.120 --> 1:33:38.520]  attacked, the Bill of Rights under attack, all of it with Governor Ventura but the heart of the
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:45.800]  matter is this administrative law. They set up the CIA in 47 and said it would be reviewable by
[1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:51.400]  Congress but would be basically above the law. Now when the EPA shuts down selective power plants
[1:33:51.400 --> 1:33:57.320]  that aren't part of the insiders they declare that it's administrative that Congress has given them
[1:33:57.320 --> 1:34:03.800]  a blank check but all of the common law and all the federal rulings until about the 50s and 60s
[1:34:03.800 --> 1:34:10.040]  stated this stuff is not even law it's a fraud. So they just have made up Trump's baloney that they
[1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:17.480]  then slap on top and do things that the most authoritarian states don't even do and now they're
[1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:21.240]  saying they're going to have a no-gun buy list folks are you ready for that you didn't do anything
[1:34:21.240 --> 1:34:26.920]  wrong no judge no jury you're not a felon you're on the list TSA says they want to have a system
[1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:33.400]  where you don't get a job unless they authorize you to have one this is a total
[1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:40.680]  and complete federal power grab uh Governor Ventura how I mean how far how far can this
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:45.000]  this corruption go I mean I know they're now teaching police everywhere but the Constitution
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:50.120]  is not relevant I see that in state and federal cases where the judge says to people you don't
[1:34:50.120 --> 1:34:57.000]  bring the Constitution in my courtroom to lawyers is this not classical treason I would think so
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:02.840]  you know it it'll go as far as we allow them to go with it because ultimately Alex it's all
[1:35:02.840 --> 1:35:09.240]  fault it is you know and for for for being laissez faire for being asleep at the wheel
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:14.680]  whatever you want to say for not being concerned for living in our own little lives and not
[1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:19.880]  paying attention to what they're doing so whatever happens to this country is ultimately the people's
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:26.280]  fault now but you still can't blame them solely there are some dastardly people that are running
[1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:33.720]  our country and dastardly people that are in control of the power and uh you know it's it's
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:39.720]  very frustrating because you think no one's out there listening you think no one cares because
[1:35:39.720 --> 1:35:45.480]  everyone just sits back and accepts it accepts it like lemmings you know no one voices any concern
[1:35:46.040 --> 1:35:52.600]  again I would love to see the day where everyone would boycott the airport in protest but you
[1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:58.920]  can't get people to do that because they think they've been made safe they think that because of
[1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:05.880]  9-11 this is required in airports to keep us safe and it's going to spill out of the airports and
[1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:11.320]  it's going to spill into everybody's life and I guess nobody's going to truly believe it until
[1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:16.680]  they come up to your home without a warrant and they come inside to search it and then I've even
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:24.600]  had people say to me well I've got nothing to hide why should I care if they do that you know
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:30.520]  that's the attitude you got out there amongst a great deal of people Alex well I'm not a criminal
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:36.520]  I don't care what they do I have nothing to hide exactly but what about government in history the
[1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:41.880]  horrible things it does when it's not kept on a short leash as our founders with common sense
[1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:47.800]  pointed out but think about the precept the idea that anywhere there's a potential danger
[1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:54.200]  government has a right to put its hands on you to stop you to arrest you to keep you safe
[1:36:54.200 --> 1:36:57.720]  there could well then I guess you can't ride a horse you might fall off of your kills you can't
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:37:03.480]  go surfing and that used to be the greatness of this country the greatness of this country was
[1:37:03.480 --> 1:37:09.400]  the fact that you were you could come here and be self-reliant that you wouldn't have a government
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:16.600]  hovering over your head and that yes it will stumble and make mistakes yes things will happen
[1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:23.320]  but it's like what I used to say when I was governor you can't legislate stupidity people
[1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:29.720]  will do stupid things that's also part of freedom the freedom to be stupid you have freedom to be
[1:37:29.720 --> 1:37:36.600]  smart and freedom goes both ways and you can't sit back and jury pick what you're going to be free
[1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:41.240]  and what's not going to be free well it gives the feds an excuse to go everywhere if there's
[1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:44.840]  this shadowy enemy they can't defeat but let me tell you a quick story get your deck on it then
[1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:49.880]  Aaron Dix has got a question who's up there in the studio uh in Austin all right it's down there
[1:37:49.880 --> 1:37:56.440]  I'm up here in Utah I went to uh to uh meteor crater where one of the biggest meteors ever
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:38:00.760]  hit the earth and when I'd been there as a child they let us hike down the bottom and the guy said
[1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:06.280]  nope because of lawsuits even if you sign a form lawyers still sue they've taken the diving boards
[1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:11.080]  out of the swimming pools they're taking the metal slides out everywhere they're taking the marigo
[1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:15.720]  rounds out then I get to the Grand Canyon and I said these areas were open when I was in college
[1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:23.000]  they go not now uh and they're even talking about getting rid of the mule rides where you can't do
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:28.920]  that because somebody might get hurt sometime and then I got to monument valley Utah I hadn't
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:33.080]  read the fine print and they said oh you're not allowed to go in 90 plus percent unless it's on a
[1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:38.600]  little truck and you can't really get off you could just go to the front of it and look at them
[1:38:38.600 --> 1:38:43.480]  because somebody might get hurt and I mean literally this country is going beyond
[1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:50.600]  Jeremy's we've seen her now why do you think I was half the year in Mexico yeah I go I go to
[1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:56.440]  things down there called the bloodless bullfights where they don't hurt the bull you still have
[1:38:56.440 --> 1:39:01.160]  the matador the matador is in danger but the bull isn't harmed at all and so I don't have a problem
[1:39:01.160 --> 1:39:06.680]  with that well one of the things that they do things in Mexico you wouldn't dare do here
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:11.560]  like they got a thing where they take two people out of the crowd and they put them on a teeter
[1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:17.400]  totter you know that goes up and down yeah only this this one also circles like a propeller
[1:39:17.400 --> 1:39:22.760]  and then they let a bull loose and the bull charges so you got to go up when the bull goes
[1:39:22.760 --> 1:39:29.320]  underneath you I mean it's hilarious I turned to my wife I said oh my god could you imagine
[1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:36.360]  if somebody proposed this in the United States see I like living in Mexico because down there you're
[1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:43.720]  kind of on your own and if you and if you do something stupid like if I go out surfing alone
[1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:48.680]  and I hit my head on the board and I drown out there well the Mexican people they're going to
[1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:53.880]  feel bad for me and they're going to probably say a prayer for me and all that stuff but ultimately
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:40:00.440]  they're going to say what a big dummy he was why would you think of going swimming alone exactly
[1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:10.680]  you'd rather face the danger exactly then lose my freedoms I would rather be able to go be stupid
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:17.640]  and go out into the water alone and kill myself than to have the army or the police I'm sure
[1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:23.240]  saying nobody's allowed to swim because you might kill yourself well that's always the greatest
[1:40:23.240 --> 1:40:28.200]  danger as well Aaron Dykes I believe Aaron's riding shotgun there Aaron you had a question
[1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:33.720]  for Governor Ventura yeah I did and I wanted to go back to the great quote from Benjamin Franklin
[1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:39.080]  that he brought up regarding if you trade your liberty for security you end up with neither
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:44.760]  and how many things have we been asked to compromise our liberty on and under the name of national
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:50.120]  security and the rest of it where safety cannot be guaranteed and with that in mind I ask how
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:55.720]  long has the government known that these x-ray body scanners are dangerous oh I don't think they've
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:41:02.120]  ever done proper testing at all if it's so sick you don't put them in shirt off yeah yeah but I've
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:08.920]  got a big money he works for them now this was your typical Halliburton pay over but but the
[1:41:08.920 --> 1:41:12.440]  reason I bring that up is because I've got a report here from earlier this month that the
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:18.680]  government studied these x-ray body scanners in 1998 and found that they were dangerous and could
[1:41:18.680 --> 1:41:24.280]  cause up to 100 cases of cancer a year how's that for keeping us safe yeah there you go see they're
[1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:33.880]  going to kill you the slow way it's going to be people being multiple x-rayed every week till
[1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:39.400]  they finally catch cancer get a tumor and die within a half a year well that's what happened in
[1:41:39.400 --> 1:41:45.320]  Vegas is I just abbreviated what happened I said listen I'm not going through that that increases
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:51.240]  cancer I've seen even the articles of the New York Times and they're like no uh John Hopkins
[1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:55.640]  says it's safe and I looked at the guy and I said John Hopkins head of radiology went public and
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:42:00.280]  said he never talked to them and did do a study for the government and found massive increases in
[1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:05.000]  radiation and the guy responds and goes this is the second generation it's safe and I rattled off
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:09.480]  the name of it and said no you're wrong they've got an eight-year study at Boston Logan where they
[1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:15.320]  first put these in a seven and fold increase in cancer clusters and he said nope you're wrong and
[1:42:15.320 --> 1:42:20.440]  then started his administrative rights garbage I mean it's just you even want to help these people
[1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:26.280]  but they don't care it's too much of a power trip to be able to grow people's genitals well it's a
[1:42:26.280 --> 1:42:33.640]  case too of like like I was so proud of that big marine during the Wall Street protest that stood
[1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:39.480]  out there with his iraq ribbons on on his shirt and he looked at those police the stormtroopers who
[1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:45.480]  were getting ready to do in the protesters if they could and he challenged them he said where is your
[1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:52.760]  honor where's your honor and I say that to any policeman out there any military person out there
[1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:59.080]  remember you take an oath to the constitution and the bill of rights and always remember your
[1:42:59.080 --> 1:43:05.720]  honor is your honor more important than is it your job we know governor that's a really good
[1:43:05.720 --> 1:43:12.760]  point if the constitution is dead and that's what they teach now at the federal level if it's dead
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:19.640]  why do they still swear enough to it to defend it from enemies foreign and domestic we've definitely
[1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:25.000]  got some some domestic enemies oh we've got huge domestic enemies against the constitution
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:30.520]  bill of rights the majority of the leaders of our country seem to be that way or who's ever in
[1:43:30.520 --> 1:43:36.200]  charge running the departments it may not be the elected people maybe it's maybe this deals like
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:42.520]  colonel proudy said in his book the secret team where he exposes who truly runs the government
[1:43:42.520 --> 1:43:48.760]  it's the bureaucrats at high level who remain there after elected people come and go look at
[1:43:48.760 --> 1:43:58.840]  look at Europe Jesse they're saying technocratic elite they're saying all these former Bilderberg
[1:43:58.840 --> 1:44:03.480]  people all these central bankers they now are being put in as the presidents and prime ministers
[1:44:03.480 --> 1:44:08.360]  that are saying they're above the law and they're calling it technocrats whatever they want to call
[1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:14.600]  it but i'll tell you that's why people got to support these this movement against wall street
[1:44:14.600 --> 1:44:20.920]  it's not a movement against capitalism it's not a movement to make us communist which is what
[1:44:20.920 --> 1:44:28.360]  mainstream media tries to portray it what it simply is it's a movement stating wall street stop
[1:44:28.360 --> 1:44:35.480]  corporations stop buying our politicians because unfortunately alex i'll be the one to say this
[1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:41.240]  on the record as a former military person you don't serve the people of the united states anymore
[1:44:41.240 --> 1:44:47.400]  you don't serve the constitution of the bill of rights our military is the muscle for the corporate
[1:44:47.400 --> 1:44:53.720]  power if they can't beat them in the corporate boardrooms then they'll send in the u.s marines
[1:44:54.280 --> 1:45:00.120]  well that's what's medley mutler said 80 years ago exactly and it's been going on for a hundred years
[1:45:00.680 --> 1:45:08.680]  nothing has changed all these wars are not wars for freedom they're wars of corporate greed nothing
[1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:19.160]  more these people attack us if we weren't over there occupying them well said speaking of the
[1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:25.720]  republican candidates of course cbs news got caught giving romp all the televised portion
[1:45:25.720 --> 1:45:31.320]  89 seconds and giving romney more than 10 and then they got a memo where mockman was only
[1:45:31.320 --> 1:45:38.040]  supposed to get two minutes poll 90 seconds paul was given 89 seconds now when he wins polls
[1:45:38.040 --> 1:45:42.680]  they just remove him from the winner place i mean that shows how scared they are
[1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:48.680]  oh they're scared to death ron paul's got him on the run uh hopefully ron paul will do something
[1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:54.040]  after they won't give him the republican nomination because rest assured he's not going to get it
[1:45:54.680 --> 1:45:59.880]  and uh and hopefully he'll be courageous enough and take the bold step to become the libertarian
[1:45:59.880 --> 1:46:05.560]  and be our candidate but we'll have to wait and see on that but the rest of these i'll tell you
[1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:10.040]  they're disillusional how can somebody how can you take someone serious who gets up there and
[1:46:10.040 --> 1:46:18.120]  tells you god told him to run i mean well that's a lot of cynically to to to get the evangelical
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:22.600]  so that means so that means i guess he's going to be there and god's going to be telling them
[1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:29.000]  what to do it's kind of like when george bush was questioned on the invasion of iraq and they asked
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:34.600]  him well did you consult your father and bush turned around proudly and said no i consulted
[1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:42.200]  a higher father and i almost fell out of the chair i said you mean this s o b wants me to believe
[1:46:42.200 --> 1:46:47.800]  he talked to god and god told him to invade iraq well that's like the head of goman sex
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:56.040]  says he's doing god's work well any any evangelical people out there if you buy into that you're a
[1:46:56.040 --> 1:47:03.320]  bunch of idiots if you really and truly believe that these high elected officials have been told by
[1:47:03.320 --> 1:47:11.240]  god well that was hitler's favorite passage just do whatever the government says you know throw
[1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:19.160]  people in ovens in order to it's of the lord it's very sick the jfk anniversary is coming up i know
[1:47:19.160 --> 1:47:24.200]  you're speaking at a prestigious dinner boy would they've now released the author's messenger junior
[1:47:24.200 --> 1:47:28.920]  tapes of uh and i've always been told this by jam mars and others but now it's released
[1:47:28.920 --> 1:47:33.640]  that jackie kennedy said that the lbj had him killed now we have the deathbed confession that
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:38.680]  you first air on tv last year on television for the first time of e howard hunton the confession
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:45.160]  he lost the lawsuit when he tried to sue spotlight you know 30 years ago uh and and and now all these
[1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:51.000]  people have come out i mean this is pretty much open and shut now gov but it's not alex because
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:57.960]  mainstream media who have bamboozled us for 50 years still will not say a word about it nor will
[1:47:57.960 --> 1:48:05.000]  they admit that they were wrong that lee harvey Oswald did not kill john kennedy and if he was
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:12.680]  involved he certainly was not alone and yet mainstream media ignores everything you say
[1:48:12.680 --> 1:48:20.040]  and continue to do it and they will never admit it alex you could have a film of somebody
[1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:26.920]  shooting from behind the picket fence and they still would not accept it you know you could have
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:33.400]  one of the shooters come forward if they're still alive and say yep i was the guy in the deltex
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:39.800]  building or i was the guy behind the picket fence and he could provide all the information needed
[1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:46.360]  he still wouldn't see the light of day because always remember from the power brokers if they
[1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:52.360]  can kill the president and get away with it what can't they do well there's always a bridge to
[1:48:52.360 --> 1:48:56.520]  fall as humorous but i agree with you they certainly think they're invincible now mf global
[1:48:56.520 --> 1:49:02.520]  has taken 1.2 million of private accounts and they're actually admitting it's illegal but
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:09.160]  saying no one will get in trouble because corezine is is basically above the long well isn't that
[1:49:09.160 --> 1:49:16.520]  interesting too and i'm glad isn't he a democrat yes yeah see so it ain't just the republicans
[1:49:16.520 --> 1:49:24.040]  it's the democrats also and people better wake up to that i've been harping on it now for 20 to 25
[1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:30.680]  years that these two political parties are not the solution they're the problem john adams warned
[1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:35.720]  us way back when they formed the country he said the fall of the united states would not come from
[1:49:35.720 --> 1:49:41.240]  a force outside it would come from within and it would be when political parties take over the
[1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:47.880]  government now he said party faction the factionalization where we have a two-party dictatorship
[1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:55.400]  exactly it's just like pro wrestling alex people wake up in front of the cameras they don't like
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:50:02.120]  each other behind the scenes they're working together and earning money that's exactly what
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:09.320]  pro wrestling is and and now if you'll believe that for pro wrestling why won't you believe it
[1:50:09.320 --> 1:50:14.200]  for the politicians well gov i'm just glad that you're on this tsa thing because you're bringing
[1:50:14.200 --> 1:50:19.080]  a lot of light to it and things are coming to a head we had to make opt out last year on thanksgiving
[1:50:19.080 --> 1:50:27.560]  we didn't launch that this year we we need to get groups pushed final questions and comments

[1:53:58.760 --> 1:54:03.960]  called me last monday and said oh boy the uh david ike thing didn't go too well and i said well he
[1:54:03.960 --> 1:54:08.840]  was in the show two seasons ago it was very fair and he said yeah they just you know it just didn't
[1:54:08.840 --> 1:54:14.040]  go well he was just letting me know what had happened and because david had put out a big
[1:54:14.040 --> 1:54:20.520]  article and i admire governor de ventura uh you know uh you know ike is a very charismatic
[1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:25.880]  guy i believe what he's saying and i appreciate his work as well it's sad to see what happened but
[1:54:25.880 --> 1:54:31.960]  god you never talk about the tv show until it's out but obviously this information is now out so i
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:37.560]  want to ask you uh you want to interview ike in in uh well pennsylvania believe what oh cleveland
[1:54:37.560 --> 1:54:43.880]  ohio uh and uh what happened there between you and david ike well uh he just i don't know he got
[1:54:43.880 --> 1:54:49.240]  all offended and told me to f off and walked off the interview simply i was asking him uh questions
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:57.000]  about his expertise and that's reptilians and uh you know i i go from a point of you know there is
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:02.120]  no dumb question if i don't understand it it's certainly not dumb to me i was trained that way
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:07.720]  by chief warrant officer i'm in demolition when i went through uh navy seal training and that's
[1:55:07.720 --> 1:55:13.640]  how i've lived my life and apparently he doesn't like to be questioned on anything that he believes
[1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:18.840]  in or anything that he espouses and i think that's ridiculous because if you believe in
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:24.440]  what you say then you should have no problem discussing it with anyone and uh i just found
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:29.640]  him to be one of the worst interviews i've ever possibly done because he's not forthcoming at all
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:38.280]  well he had been sick um and uh i've i've almost wish you guys via skype can do it again
[1:55:38.280 --> 1:55:43.640]  and and and you know try it one more time because you know two years ago you guys had a positive
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:50.520]  positive interview with him and you know he's really great on so many issues and i'm just uh i
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:55.000]  mean i know this you guys weren't intending just to do a fair interview correct absolutely
[1:55:55.640 --> 1:56:02.040]  everything i did on that episode pointed to going to him to get answers but getting answers from him
[1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:08.040]  is impossible you know that's what that's what i told him i said oh no they wanted an open-minded thing
[1:56:08.040 --> 1:56:13.320]  and you're basically the star of this episode this you know this interview and but it is reality
[1:56:13.320 --> 1:56:18.760]  so sometimes things get things get crazy i just there's so few of us that are really questioning
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:24.040]  reality and the officialdom and uh but he gets away with it because he tells you right at the
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:30.360]  opening thing he looks right at you and says nothing is real nothing is what it is so when he
[1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:35.880]  opens that door that means he can say anything he wants and he doesn't have to defend it with
[1:56:35.880 --> 1:56:42.120]  any facts or anything because nothing's real and it's laughable when somebody says that to you or
[1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:47.400]  to be anyway you know we only get you and i call this radio show for a debate that'd be that'd be
[1:56:47.400 --> 1:56:54.280]  interesting i have my you know i don't think i care too i don't think it would go anywhere alex
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:57:00.200]  because he he obviously took great offense to me and i don't know why i you know all i did was
[1:57:00.200 --> 1:57:07.880]  asking questions that were pertinent things that i wanted to get hopefully answers before you go
[1:57:07.880 --> 1:57:12.920]  to mexico within the next month or two we can talk about it but it's a side issue i just no problem i
[1:57:12.920 --> 1:57:17.640]  mean i don't lose sleep over it he goes on and i go on he's making a lot of money that's for sure
[1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:23.400]  what was the question he raised that he got angry at can he one of them there wasn't one there was
[1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:28.280]  the whole interview you know i think he misunderstood reading his article because he said he sat there
[1:57:28.280 --> 1:57:32.760]  for an hour and then he wanted to meet you and they didn't bring him in i don't think he understood
[1:57:32.760 --> 1:57:37.160]  that with that you know with with real reality tv they don't they want to keep you guys separate
[1:57:37.160 --> 1:57:41.720]  so the meetings knew if you read his article what you told me off here you haven't i think
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:46.920]  i think he took it like like it was a setup he didn't know that the lighting guys were just
[1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:52.120]  as usual taking their time well i don't know anything about that you know and i'm not going
[1:57:52.120 --> 1:57:57.720]  to worry about it uh you know i'm i'm there i was there to interview him he clearly didn't want to
[1:57:57.720 --> 1:58:03.160]  talk to me about anything and when he did he wouldn't answer any questions he attacked me all right
[1:58:03.160 --> 1:58:07.880]  well god listen i want you to have a great time down at mexico be safe and uh i know you're talking
[1:58:07.880 --> 1:58:13.880]  to libertarians off record you might run huh no i wouldn't hold my breath on it i've just spoken to
[1:58:13.880 --> 1:58:19.000]  them and they've spoken to me and the lines of dialogue are open it's not anything father than
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:24.280]  that they'll have their convention in early may and at that convention they will decide who's
[1:58:24.280 --> 1:58:31.880]  going to be the candidate for the uh the 2012 election thank you so much okay on you are listening

[1:59:57.000 --> 2:00:07.720]  and now live from austin texas alex jones okay my friends greg palast is coming up to break
[2:00:07.720 --> 2:00:13.320]  down the incredible developments with mf global i mean do people realize how big this is and the
[2:00:13.320 --> 2:00:19.640]  company could just say we're keeping 1.2 million or more of people's private segregated accounts
[2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:24.120]  and that the media hasn't really made a big deal about it i mean it's finally starting to get attention
[2:00:24.120 --> 2:00:29.880]  but if you look at how many people in the republican and democratic parties but particularly the
[2:00:29.880 --> 2:00:38.040]  democratic parties are just out and out villainous street type criminals a lot of republican leaders
[2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:43.480]  they do it through big giant global contracts howler merton stuff like that it's just as corrupt
[2:00:43.480 --> 2:00:49.640]  or more so but with the democrats it's a it's a gutter type thing like with bill clinton you know
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:54.840]  being out of me in arkansas flying the cocaine in and he was there with his limo taking delivery
[2:00:55.880 --> 2:01:01.080]  and he'll overseeing who would be murdered and personally raping the women and here's
[2:01:01.080 --> 2:01:09.960]  another headline political fixer and obama pal tony resko gets 10 years in jail isn't that
[2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:15.880]  precious again obama parton's dope dealers chicago jewel thief parton
[2:01:15.880 --> 2:01:23.160]  and uh nancy polosi's using occupy wall street to raise cash when she's totally controlled
[2:01:23.160 --> 2:01:27.480]  by the corrupt elements of wall street they're using big government control and selective
[2:01:27.480 --> 2:01:32.120]  enforcement to shut down their competition but see it's not either you're for free market let
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:35.880]  banks run over you and let them get maker bailouts logins very free market but you'll
[2:01:35.880 --> 2:01:42.120]  make her bailouts can mean lying conservative say it's mega banks waging war against the real
[2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:50.760]  economy here's another one where's the cash core sign uh you know again is the new york
[2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:57.000]  timeshank where is the 1.2 billion plus and while imath global shortfall doubles to over
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:06.040]  1.2 billion anger raises his clients he funds frozen farm belt rage that's right farm belt
[2:02:06.040 --> 2:02:10.200]  rage well don't worry that the farm belts is going to be imploded and taken over and bank
[2:02:10.200 --> 2:02:15.240]  reps because they've now got the rural affairs council under the department of defense and
[2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:22.120]  owned homeland right security land security i mean that is going to keep everybody just
[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:26.280]  incredibly safe everything's going to be wonderful and so what if they don't pay people
[2:02:26.280 --> 2:02:30.120]  back and destroy confidence when the markets implode even more the bankers will just take
[2:02:30.120 --> 2:02:35.880]  that over it's all part of the fun command destruction or creative destruction as they
[2:02:35.880 --> 2:02:41.240]  call it does it look created to you the economy falling apart and sinking into a depression
[2:02:41.240 --> 2:02:47.720]  does to them the farm belt rage over imath global could chill markets when the cme group
[2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:52.680]  pledged 300 million of its own money to help former imath global customers get their cash
[2:02:52.680 --> 2:02:59.880]  back faster the exchange was likely uh thinking of customers like kansas cattle rancher tim
[2:02:59.880 --> 2:03:07.960]  ritzky yeah that's right the cme group has already kicked in 300 million oh but it's above
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:14.840]  1.2 billion i'm afraid and the cme group we we've we've uh reissued their press releases
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:19.960]  from a year ago promising that they had all these hundreds of trillions and assets and everything
[2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:24.760]  was guaranteed while attacking chiral solente in his comments on the show
[2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:31.960]  so fed up and frustrated with his brokers collapse and when he sees as the cme slow efforts
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:38.600]  to help him retrieve his 30 000 in stranded capital the farmer says his faith in the futures
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:46.760]  industry has been shaken to its core oh i would be hedging some feeder cattle right now
[2:03:48.600 --> 2:03:54.280]  but i'm not going to do it i'm leaving them exposed to the cash market and i don't like
[2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:57.320]  that you know that'll drop down prices he went on to say
[2:03:59.720 --> 2:04:05.960]  ritzky may reside far from the trading pit in chicago but he and thousands of other ranchers
[2:04:05.960 --> 2:04:11.880]  and farmers across the country are at the heart of our futures trading with billions of dollars
[2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:19.880]  locked up in mf globals october 31 bank repc filing they are likely a key voice in determining

[2:10:09.800 --> 2:10:16.840]  to take calls but only on the global derivatives meltdown only on the brokerage firms only on
[2:10:16.840 --> 2:10:23.240]  um credit swiss coming out and predicting bank runs and the possible end of the euro
[2:10:24.600 --> 2:10:28.440]  the destruction of confidence is what we're talking about and greg palast i'm so glad
[2:10:28.440 --> 2:10:34.600]  we've got him his new book just debuted uh last week it's amazing shooting up the best
[2:10:34.600 --> 2:10:38.680]  selling list we're going to be breaking that down as well before he leaves us but he was a
[2:10:38.680 --> 2:10:44.600]  former top federal white collar crime investigator just like william k black who's in my film fall
[2:10:44.600 --> 2:10:49.160]  the republic and he said a year and a half ago he said this is an order of magnitude that means
[2:10:49.160 --> 2:10:55.480]  10 times bigger than the biggest snl scam we've ever seen the difference now is they're not just
[2:10:55.480 --> 2:11:01.080]  selling Ponzi schemes they're stealing money directly out of the accounts so he's a bbc a bc
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:06.440]  reporter best-selling author multi times over former federal investigator and i'm just lauding our
[2:11:06.440 --> 2:11:10.760]  guest because he's predicted everything that's come true that's the kind of guest we have on here
[2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:14.440]  i have a whole chapter in my book to send to tyranny where we it's a transcript of my interview
[2:11:14.440 --> 2:11:19.400]  with him in 2002 looking out into the future with derivatives and breaking down what's now
[2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:24.440]  happened the model of the global banks imploding third world countries through fraud buying off
[2:11:24.440 --> 2:11:30.040]  their politicians going ahead and killing the gooses that lay golden eggs so you control it if
[2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:34.440]  you kill and eat the goose you know nobody else is going to get the golden eggs so they're going
[2:11:34.440 --> 2:11:38.280]  for red meat not gold eggs they don't want a free market they don't want true freedom they don't
[2:11:38.280 --> 2:11:42.440]  want stability and here's Reuters what we told you about i'm going to get greg palaces take on this
[2:11:44.120 --> 2:11:51.560]  farm belt rage over mf global could chill markets and it quotes all of these farmers and ranchers
[2:11:51.560 --> 2:11:56.840]  that bet on the different commodities because they're experts in it and i've got family that's been
[2:11:56.840 --> 2:12:01.880]  involved in cattle futures and corn futures and do pretty good in it they're not involved in it now
[2:12:01.880 --> 2:12:06.920]  because they know you can get burned even when you've already taken the money put in your account
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:12.920]  it's your money you even put in many cases they're taking these accounts and here's the keyword that
[2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:19.000]  are segregated now just a week and a half ago the head of the cftc who we now learn was involved
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:24.920]  in mf global has had to recuse himself with core sign he came out and said this looks you know
[2:12:24.920 --> 2:12:30.760]  criminal blah blah blah now now there was a week long cover up where they didn't want to discuss it
[2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:36.760]  now the new york times is covering it today since it's over 1.2 billion up from 600 million
[2:12:36.760 --> 2:12:44.040]  and the cme group has had to dump 300 million in this ladies and gentlemen could be the the the
[2:12:44.040 --> 2:12:50.200]  the the spark that lights off the the fireworks factory as they say and joining us to break this
[2:12:50.200 --> 2:12:56.680]  down how big this could be you think we're in a depression now folks why would the banksters
[2:12:56.680 --> 2:13:04.360]  destroy confidence like this greg palace who understands their kleptocracy their kleptocratic
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:11.160]  psychology because he studied them and put a lot of them in jail joins us greg is is this the
[2:13:11.160 --> 2:13:18.120]  beginning of the wild orgy of corruption or have we seen the worst no this is the beginning of the
[2:13:18.120 --> 2:13:23.880]  exposure of some of the wild orgy of corruption it's there okay let's remember when you're talking
[2:13:23.880 --> 2:13:30.760]  about mf capital and you're talking about john uh john core sign this was the guy who was ceo of
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:36.760]  golden sacks so in other words this is the guy that lit the fuse and began the fires that of
[2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:41.880]  course blew up his company not that he cares he was already worth about a quarter billion dollars
[2:13:41.880 --> 2:13:48.200]  so if you're if you're out there uh don't wring out your hanky for john core sign you know that
[2:13:48.200 --> 2:13:53.080]  just a billion bucks is disappearing a lot of it farmers money because they're in the commodity
[2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:58.600]  because it's commodities and you're right and so what i did in vultures picnic and by the way i
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:03.320]  just so you know alex one i want to thank you i know what they think that uh that the listeners
[2:14:03.320 --> 2:14:09.720]  out there in in the middle of america are illiterate but actually uh you put vultures picnic on the
[2:14:09.720 --> 2:14:14.440]  times bestseller list act uh alex so thank you much but i have to change the name from vultures
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:19.720]  picnic to job creators picnic you know people like john core sign right but here's one of
[2:14:19.720 --> 2:14:26.440]  things i i uncovered there these guys goldman and the and the big banks were running this scam
[2:14:26.440 --> 2:14:32.440]  where they're working with the euro countries uh especially greece secretly working with the
[2:14:32.440 --> 2:14:37.240]  governments and the central bankers to pull money out of their of the central banks to convert
[2:14:37.240 --> 2:14:43.560]  the currencies into yens dollars move them around where there were euros at first put them back in
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:48.280]  and supposedly these big operators like goldman were taking billions and billions and billions
[2:14:48.280 --> 2:14:54.360]  of dollars of losses well that's on the cover on the surface and of course the tarp program
[2:14:54.360 --> 2:15:00.040]  you are now paying for all their losses goldman sacks was turned into a commercial bank with
[2:15:00.040 --> 2:15:06.440]  public guarantees in 24 hours this usually takes 10 years and you have to show a strong balance sheet
[2:15:06.440 --> 2:15:10.840]  goldman sacks says we're bankrupt make us a commercial bank and bail us out they do that
[2:15:10.840 --> 2:15:15.800]  in 24 hours so so they're showing losses but they weren't there those losses weren't there
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:20.200]  they had secret agreements with the greek government they had secret agreements with other
[2:15:20.200 --> 2:15:25.640]  with italian and then spanish governments in which goldman and the other banks losses but
[2:15:25.640 --> 2:15:33.640]  particular goldman would be made up goldman would be basically paid off secretly and in addition
[2:15:33.640 --> 2:15:39.480]  goldman got about 300 million that's a 340 million dollars of fees that's about a third of a billion
[2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:45.800]  dollars of fee for this scam the purpose was by the way so that these governments could say that
[2:15:45.800 --> 2:15:51.880]  their deficits were less than 3% which is what they need to be in the eurozone but of course being
[2:15:51.880 --> 2:15:57.960]  the eurozone is like you know wanting to be in the in the leper colony but nevertheless so you
[2:15:57.960 --> 2:16:02.760]  have to you have to understand that what's happening in the world financial markets it would be wrong
[2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:10.040]  to think of this as a financial disaster first it is a crime scene and like many crime scenes where
[2:16:10.040 --> 2:16:15.320]  there's bleeding bodies where there's blown up buildings where there's arson and this is financial
[2:16:15.320 --> 2:16:23.960]  arson yeah there's destruction but it there is very to use the foggy term financial downturn
[2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:29.960]  big recession is missing the point what we have now is a world is is a finance community which is
[2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:36.200]  a crime scene because you know when i was a fraud investigator i mean what's what's strange to me
[2:16:36.200 --> 2:16:41.160]  i don't know what you know i i mean i've seen the bottom i've seen some pretty bad stuff alex after
[2:16:41.160 --> 2:16:46.600]  all i did racketeering investigations but this is the type of stuff we used to cuff people for i mean
[2:16:46.600 --> 2:16:53.080]  guys like corezine guys like blank fine from uh uh goldman involved me when they got caught in
[2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:56.440]  this game we used to like cuff these guys and read them their rights and walk them out of the
[2:16:56.440 --> 2:17:01.560]  buildings like i've been bozki i mean bozki was this a girl scout compared to these guys and he
[2:17:01.560 --> 2:17:06.360]  didn't take down entire nations well that's a question um bernie made off go to jail for only
[2:17:06.360 --> 2:17:12.360]  50 75 billion or so some say 100 billion when these guys are involved in destroying and and
[2:17:12.360 --> 2:17:17.560]  tying up trillions uh i mean was he kind of an outside player i mean he was the guy that
[2:17:17.560 --> 2:17:25.320]  in you know chemical the nasdaq well uh let's not forget that uh made off was covering for others
[2:17:25.320 --> 2:17:31.480]  like paulson okay um and he had guys there were investors in made-offs funds who were earning
[2:17:31.480 --> 2:17:37.160]  two and 300 percent when everyone else was getting was getting hosed because obviously the bill a few
[2:17:37.160 --> 2:17:45.560]  billionaires knew so either he took the fall for them or basically the one percent of the one percent
[2:17:45.560 --> 2:17:52.600]  was going down he was their toy boy he was just a tool someone got that money and take a look it
[2:17:52.600 --> 2:17:57.400]  wasn't made off that money that money went somewhere it didn't just go vanish into outer space you
[2:17:57.400 --> 2:18:02.440]  know they say they lost so much the money wasn't lost believe me someone found it it went somewhere
[2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:10.440]  and that's and the guys who got the money are giggling are giggling okay and there were there's
[2:18:10.440 --> 2:18:16.680]  at least four arbitrageers that you could name who got the money from that scam so why aren't they
[2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:21.560]  giving it up only one woman yeah i mean how much confidence is this going to destroy
[2:18:21.560 --> 2:18:29.240]  well they they confidence destruction because it creates more of all what's called volatility
[2:18:29.240 --> 2:18:33.560]  in the markets which increases the value of derivatives so volatility destruction is part
[2:18:33.560 --> 2:18:38.760]  of the game that's the problem so yeah it's going to increase because what's happening just like the
[2:18:38.760 --> 2:18:43.560]  oil market where they like it bouncing up and down uh volatility if you're in the derivative
[2:18:43.560 --> 2:18:49.400]  selling game which is the derivatives like credit default swaps it's like selling fire insurance
[2:18:49.400 --> 2:18:53.960]  but it's like arson is selling fire insurance the the banks that are selling it like gold
[2:18:53.960 --> 2:18:59.480]  men's uh so they keep setting fires they keep saying oh you need fire insurance you know how
[2:18:59.480 --> 2:19:03.640]  much they're making you have no you know that the average greek family for example and that's

[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:55.080]  mega minions mega gophers like made off up to super minions like corezine who then works for
[2:24:55.080 --> 2:24:59.960]  the Rockefeller the Rothschilds the Dutch royalty the British royalty the the Saudi royalty folks
[2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:05.000]  like that now we're getting up to the i mean are they just going to take everybody's money and that's
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:11.800]  just the way it is and and i guess homeland security standing by well i thought that there
[2:25:11.800 --> 2:25:17.080]  was kind of a bottom to what these guys would do but i i just you know and uh let me be commercial
[2:25:17.080 --> 2:25:21.320]  reminded that my new book is vultures picnic and you've got a vultures picnic dot org you can get
[2:25:21.320 --> 2:25:27.880]  some of this info including by the way that the secret memo between tim geithner secretary of
[2:25:27.880 --> 2:25:34.760]  the treasury and larry summers our economic star who should be called the uh uh you know the typhoid
[2:25:34.760 --> 2:25:40.840]  merry of economics i want you to go and see that at at vultures picnic dot org and you'll see what's
[2:25:40.840 --> 2:25:45.640]  going on these guys really have no bottom when you look at that that was a memo and by the way
[2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:51.080]  i got that memo verified by the head the director general the world trade organization itself because
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:56.760]  you know my position with bbc i can get to anyone in the world basically um and they verified this
[2:25:56.760 --> 2:26:02.440]  stuff this they don't spit these guys without asking the banks and there was corezine's name
[2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:09.960]  don't there there is no financial international policy made in the united states geithner tells
[2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:15.640]  summers call corezine this is the guy that just took us down for a billion bucks and believe me
[2:26:15.640 --> 2:26:20.040]  he ain't going to be wearing pinstripes and ain't happening so i thought that there was a bottom till
[2:26:20.040 --> 2:26:25.640]  i've seen the latest documents the latest material these guys are going for broke we go broke and they
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:31.400]  clean up they set the fire in greece and now they're buying up the greek water systems the greek ports
[2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:36.360]  like uh phesalonica you know like these they're famous you know old names and you saw the film
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:41.720]  300 or something you know ancient stuff that they're buying at the beaches right so now they're moving
[2:26:41.720 --> 2:26:47.080]  on to italy they're moving out to portugal spain um you know they've tried they're doing this thing
[2:26:47.080 --> 2:26:51.960]  all over the world and of course picking up oil properties absolutely everywhere you set the world
[2:26:51.960 --> 2:26:58.120]  on fire you have the you're the last guy standing with the cash you clean up and pick up everything
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:03.400]  at the fire sale the number one thing that's happening these so-called austerity programs
[2:27:03.400 --> 2:27:09.320]  that are the result of this massive volatility and explosion costs of derivatives the austerity
[2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:16.840]  programs begin with privatization selling off of public properties you know that man these guys
[2:27:16.840 --> 2:27:21.560]  are cleaning it up and it you know they're going to be the landlords of the planet they'll have
[2:27:21.560 --> 2:27:26.760]  everything you know we're just going to be living on their planet that's it and you can see setting
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:32.440]  up this total police state surveillance grid it's standardized worldwide and now greg i guess they
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:37.960]  can't call people like myself a cook they admit in the time magazine wall street journal financial
[2:27:37.960 --> 2:27:43.720]  times of london london independent london telegraph oh it's a banking dictatorship by goldman sacks
[2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:48.760]  who goes in and takes over governments and takes decades to do it and makes money on the way up with
[2:27:48.760 --> 2:27:53.080]  derivatives and makes money on the way down and thank god they're they're running everything
[2:27:53.080 --> 2:27:59.240]  it's a global corporate government i mean wow and i guess they just think it'll just go on forever
[2:27:59.240 --> 2:28:08.760]  greg yeah i think one of the things that we have to recognize is that um i can you hear me yes sir
[2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:15.400]  okay sorry i was losing out there um what was happening right my friend go ahead
[2:28:17.240 --> 2:28:22.360]  okay all right yeah i came back into you um wait this is can you i'm sorry can you hear me now i
[2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:30.520]  just want to make sure yes go ahead greg i lose you alex all right um what's happened is that the um
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:37.640]  that in the cradle of democracy greece when uh the president the greece said well we should let
[2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:45.640]  the people vote on the bankers proposal the us an international press went completely hogged nuts
[2:28:45.640 --> 2:28:50.280]  wild how dare you let people vote on the fate of their economy and they got rid of the elected
[2:28:50.280 --> 2:28:55.240]  president and they put in a guy who was a golden sacks advisor completely unelected the same thing
[2:28:55.240 --> 2:28:59.720]  happened in italy i wasn't the fan of barrel of sconey but at least he was an elected president
[2:28:59.720 --> 2:29:05.080]  now you have can you imagine the bankers are literally picking presidents it's it's a financial
[2:29:05.080 --> 2:29:10.840]  coup d'etat and and we're being told that this is a good idea because only the unelected have the
[2:29:10.840 --> 2:29:16.840]  guts to tell us um that we have to cut uh you know that we have to cut government and cut well
[2:29:16.840 --> 2:29:21.480]  we are old it's a new type of authoritarianism i want you to finish up with that talk about
[2:29:21.480 --> 2:29:26.040]  austerity and grace that we'll go to calls straight ahead stay with us greg palest is our

[2:33:07.560 --> 2:33:11.560]  blame us for the guy that shot up the white house who just gets a friend who thinks he's the christ
[2:33:11.560 --> 2:33:17.480]  reportedly because he supposedly watched the obama deception a year ago at the party so we

[2:33:35.960 --> 2:33:41.720]  what greg's saying and give him about five minutes of the floor to really flesh this out understand
[2:33:42.520 --> 2:33:51.240]  i have heard bloomberg radio i have heard uh you name it as cnbc i say heard because i listened to
[2:33:51.240 --> 2:33:56.840]  him on on xm on a watch bunch tv but i listened to tv on radio i have heard them all in the last
[2:33:56.840 --> 2:34:02.520]  few months demonize freedom demonize people being able to vote anywhere in europe demonize the
[2:34:02.520 --> 2:34:08.520]  germans who might not want to go along with bankrolling all of this i've seen them demonize
[2:34:08.520 --> 2:34:13.160]  and i've heard them with with assurance they don't worry they'll do the right thing with the european
[2:34:13.160 --> 2:34:17.480]  you know bureaucracy it's got expert you know bankers in there from goldman sacks they know
[2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:22.360]  what to do and they sell it like europe's falling apart because none of them ever work and they're
[2:34:22.360 --> 2:34:28.360]  lazy idiots and they're all just sitting around drinking coffee all day or you know sopping up
[2:34:28.360 --> 2:34:34.760]  olive oil on their you know baguettes these people they're not doing anything yeah look at look at
[2:34:34.760 --> 2:34:41.480]  europe folks look at the production look what they built that's a lie okay that's a lie so so continuing
[2:34:41.480 --> 2:34:49.160]  i've done the math but they've admitted this iceland 91 of the um debt not owed by the people
[2:34:49.160 --> 2:34:54.440]  they said no for over a year finally got the documents turned out it was all basically the
[2:34:54.440 --> 2:34:59.480]  bank's own debt that they've gotten their own operatives in government to sign on to same thing
[2:34:59.480 --> 2:35:07.160]  in ireland same thing in grace and it's so over the top that the criminals that engineer the derivative
[2:35:07.160 --> 2:35:13.400]  fraud get the governments to sign on to it and then spin golly it that oh this is you mean this is
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:18.280]  because you've got you know you know too many weeks off a year and because your social security is
[2:35:18.280 --> 2:35:23.000]  too big i've always been against big government because then they hold people hostage for the
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:28.360]  benefits and steal most of it but then people still back the stealing because they've been made
[2:35:28.360 --> 2:35:33.880]  dependent that's why i've always been against it but the point is tens of trillions of taxpayer
[2:35:33.880 --> 2:35:39.560]  money backing up these derivatives in bailouts you never hear that discussed all you hear by
[2:35:39.560 --> 2:35:44.600]  the fake neocons is how this is great free market and anybody that doesn't like the bailouts is a
[2:35:44.600 --> 2:35:51.880]  commie no no the fascistic groups are up there using the public's wealth and fake privatization
[2:35:51.880 --> 2:35:58.360]  pushed by fake libertarians it's not privatization dan roads over for nothing to a foreign corporation
[2:35:58.360 --> 2:36:04.440]  like centra so they can slap toll roads on it at five times what it's worth gang raping you
[2:36:04.440 --> 2:36:11.080]  financially greg palace explained to them what austerity means in argentina in in in all these
[2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:16.040]  formerly wealthy countries moving over to europe what's coming what they're going to do because
[2:36:16.040 --> 2:36:20.040]  we've seen this handbook before what is austerity before we go to these calls
[2:36:20.040 --> 2:36:26.840]  okay well we saw it in in argentina and by the way i checked the inside documents i got from
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:31.160]  the imf the world bank worked with the big banks i checked it with joe stiglitz won the nobel prize
[2:36:31.160 --> 2:36:36.760]  in economics and was the chief economist the world bank he's got to come out of the cold
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:40.840]  he verified this stuff was real they had planned in that there's going to be that uh that they were
[2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:45.080]  going to squeeze down the people take away as you say their benefits and you know kick up the price
[2:36:45.080 --> 2:36:52.280]  of of food and we ended up with riots in argentina the riots allowed for for a repression that's what
[2:36:52.280 --> 2:36:57.240]  they want they want the riots so the tanks can roll it's in the plan and when i say i don't
[2:36:57.240 --> 2:37:03.000]  say that stuff lightly alex i i put this stuff at the top the bbc nightly news no they're very very
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:09.240]  quiet in the document yeah they write the riot into document joe stiglitz called the imf riot
[2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:13.400]  and uh he said it was right there they because they want that riot so then they bring in the
[2:37:13.400 --> 2:37:17.560]  tanks and then they impose this so-called austerity what does austerity mean it means they cut all your
[2:37:17.560 --> 2:37:21.320]  government benefits they take the money out of your pension funds this is not about whether you
[2:37:21.320 --> 2:37:25.240]  think government pension funds are a good idea this is about looting them whether it's good or
[2:37:25.240 --> 2:37:28.680]  bad they get looted okay that's let's keep in mind what this is about a lot of so-called
[2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:33.480]  conservatives are going to say correct just briefly oh good cut off the welfare queen folks
[2:37:33.480 --> 2:37:39.400]  there they took gerald selente's account that was his they're going to rob everyone and they're
[2:37:39.400 --> 2:37:44.520]  going to not send the welfare queen the money they're going to riot and burn the cities and
[2:37:44.520 --> 2:37:49.240]  then they're going to use that to take everybody's liberty this is a blueprint listen to greg palest
[2:37:50.760 --> 2:37:54.840]  yeah so then what they did started selling off everything in sight they had a state oil company
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:38:00.520]  which is bought by the spanish spanish rexall now uh we did a calculation with some other economists
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:06.520]  and if the spanish if the argentine government had never been forced to basically give away
[2:38:06.520 --> 2:38:13.800]  their massive oil fields an oil company they'd be they would right now have no debt at all but
[2:38:13.800 --> 2:38:18.360]  instead they were they were gunned to their head they they gave up the oil company they sold the
[2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:25.560]  Buenos Aires oil system excuse me water system water system to enron to enron had a water unit
[2:38:25.560 --> 2:38:31.240]  and of course the first thing enron did was jack up water prices 400 and then there was no water
[2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:36.840]  and then of course enron evaporates with uh with the water money of course that's the game that's
[2:38:36.840 --> 2:38:43.800]  being played they ruined us there were doctors i was getting calls from argentina i knew some
[2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:50.520]  doctors and teachers who were hunting in the alleys and garbage cans looking for food until they said
[2:38:50.520 --> 2:38:55.960]  enough and the people stood up and democratically elected a leader we saw this in in Ecuador where
[2:38:55.960 --> 2:39:02.040]  they were ruined and then the indians came out the hills burning the the towns starving starving
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:07.640]  and in ecuador in brazil and argentina they said enough they elected officials just told these
[2:39:07.640 --> 2:39:15.240]  financial jackals you may not operate here stick your your so-called the debts and get out of here
[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:20.360]  and they reversed the privatizations they took back their own oil companies kept the wealth
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:25.560]  for themselves and now brazil ecuador argentina these are the economies that are growing at
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:29.800]  8 percent a year these these economies are booming because they told the jackals to get the hell out
[2:39:29.800 --> 2:39:37.480]  and and i gotta tell you in brazil i got a document from the european community and our uh
[2:39:37.480 --> 2:39:45.320]  endorsed by our um secretary of state which is a plan to to destroy the brazilian economy through
[2:39:45.320 --> 2:39:52.280]  a trade war because brazil refuses to accept derivatives trades from jp morgan jp morgan
[2:39:52.280 --> 2:39:58.040]  wants to operate in brazil the brazilian government said we don't allow toxic financial assets we
[2:39:58.040 --> 2:40:02.600]  don't allow gambling with banking money and the us and the european community have now said well
[2:40:02.600 --> 2:40:07.640]  you know what if you don't let in these bankers with their toxic assets if you don't decriminalize
[2:40:07.640 --> 2:40:11.240]  your banking system like we've done we're not going to buy your orange juice not going to buy
[2:40:11.240 --> 2:40:16.040]  your ethanol we're going to just wipe you out and i have to say that brazil stood strong on this
[2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:22.680]  they said you know what go ahead uh do you know make our day and they have been growing at 8 percent
[2:40:22.680 --> 2:40:30.680]  a year they are booming and they just say you know um you know we're not inviting we're not
[2:40:30.680 --> 2:40:35.720]  inviting disease in here including financial diseases you know and that's but now in europe
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:41.160]  they're not doing that they're letting the uh if you read vultures picnic um the the chapter called
[2:40:41.160 --> 2:40:45.080]  the generalism of globalization you can see in fact that vultures picnic dot org you can see
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:49.240]  a little film called the generalism of globalization where i'm in the room with the head of wto
[2:40:49.240 --> 2:40:53.240]  and we're going over these documents these inside documents and he is saying well yeah
[2:40:53.240 --> 2:40:56.520]  he's trying to explain him away of course there's always an explanation alex there's always an
[2:40:56.520 --> 2:41:02.200]  explanation uh the frenchman is sitting there going we are not the evil cabal of bankers well
[2:41:02.200 --> 2:41:06.200]  he's head of credit linais the biggest french bank you know so it's not a cabal but they're
[2:41:06.200 --> 2:41:11.160]  just secretly meeting and burning down the world for us in europe the people are not standing up
[2:41:11.160 --> 2:41:16.280]  the each of these nations has two political major parties the socialist party the christian
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:21.960]  democratic party of each nation they're all hand in hand you can't put you know stick a dime between
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:27.080]  these two parties and they're all completely mobbed up with the banks like goldman you know
[2:41:27.080 --> 2:41:33.800]  both greek parties conducted this fraud with golden sacks both of them they're both dirty on this so
[2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:38.760]  when it came up for when there was a panic that the god forbid the greek people should be allowed
[2:41:38.760 --> 2:41:46.120]  to vote in the cradle of democracy the two parties which are involved in the fraud said no no no vote
[2:41:46.120 --> 2:41:50.280]  we're just going to pick this golden consultant to be the president the guys doesn't even live
[2:41:50.280 --> 2:41:54.120]  in greece he's from the he's from the states he's an american you know i mean it's ridiculous you
[2:41:54.120 --> 2:42:00.440]  know and i don't care if he's american or greek or whatever he is he's a banker and he's not elected
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:04.840]  and you know they fear democracy but i'm telling you that what happened if you're involved just
[2:42:04.840 --> 2:42:10.040]  picnic in i i met with the president of ecuador about this he's an economist by the way he taught
[2:42:10.040 --> 2:42:14.760]  at university of illinois he said i'm not going to look at these jackals rip our country apart
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:19.480]  i you know i showed him the documents from the imf he said i thought this was happening i thought
[2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:25.080]  there was a conspiracy here it is he made those documents public in ecuador our state department
[2:42:25.080 --> 2:42:30.360]  went completely wild over him doing that but he said you know what i see the documents now
[2:42:30.360 --> 2:42:36.600]  you guys take your bankers and and go fly and his economy is soaring they were right there greg
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:40.200]  incredible info and i want to go to college but obviously we're gonna have to get you back up in
[2:42:40.200 --> 2:42:44.520]  the next week or two because there's so much to cover and i want to get into how we beat these
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:49.480]  people perhaps if we take a few calls and and and where you see things going and we don't stand up
[2:42:49.480 --> 2:42:56.520]  against them but going back to what you just pointed out to hear so-called media in the united
[2:42:56.520 --> 2:43:06.280]  states especially the financial news uh actually demonizing uh anybody who is for the people
[2:43:06.280 --> 2:43:11.240]  running their own governments and admitting it's a new government where bankers are appointed over
[2:43:11.240 --> 2:43:16.520]  your country and then now it's not even an issue that shows you what they want to set up here with
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:22.680]  the supercommittees and everything else it is a hundred percent pure confirmation of just how
[2:43:22.680 --> 2:43:27.640]  dangerous this system is greg yeah where's the super committee in the constitution i thought we
[2:43:27.640 --> 2:43:31.800]  were supposed to elect our congress i mean i didn't vote for no super committee did you i don't
[2:43:31.800 --> 2:43:36.360]  remember them on the ballot i mean what is this new thing that now let's let's turn over we're
[2:43:36.360 --> 2:43:44.200]  now going to be turning over our finances to unelected committees groups um you know it's
[2:43:44.200 --> 2:43:50.920]  it's uh deeply dangerous it's deeply dangerous and it's financially destructive the nations which
[2:43:50.920 --> 2:43:58.280]  chose democracy in latin america are financially economically soaring the nations which have chose
[2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:03.320]  the bankers dictatorship are dying briefly just interjecting because i want to go to calls here
[2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:09.320]  stop breaking up a bit the issue is this is in our face the constitution says bills come out of the
[2:44:09.320 --> 2:44:14.280]  house introduced by individual members and they go through a committee process now they take six
[2:44:14.280 --> 2:44:18.840]  house six senate and the president say we don't need that and now they're going to run the farm
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:23.880]  bill and now they've got the pentagon or homeland security running the rural affairs and now they're
[2:44:23.880 --> 2:44:29.000]  suddenly federal police everywhere running the occupy attacks let's go to calls but i want to
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:34.440]  get your get your take after that on those subjects greg palace investigative journalist is our guest
[2:44:34.440 --> 2:44:39.400]  frank in canada thanks for holding her on the air hey good afternoon gentlemen just two questions
[2:44:39.400 --> 2:44:44.920]  if i may please uh first of all with regards to to the markets i mean the markets are predicated
[2:44:44.920 --> 2:44:49.640]  on a certain amount of stability and if we've taken a look at at you know the artificially
[2:44:49.640 --> 2:44:54.840]  low interest rates and quantitative easing as a kind of artificial way to prop up the markets
[2:44:54.840 --> 2:44:59.880]  then wouldn't this be counter to that top one percent that owns eighty percent of the wealth
[2:44:59.880 --> 2:45:05.400]  and assets in the markets would this not serve uh basically counter to productive to their interest
[2:45:05.400 --> 2:45:10.440]  now they want to keep the quantitative easing in to prop up the general market so they can control
[2:45:10.440 --> 2:45:16.280]  the ups and downs and siphon off money because they're involved in total insider uh accounting level
[2:45:16.920 --> 2:45:24.760]  fraud it's total insider it's beyond insider greg you can curb that well yeah i mean take a look
[2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:29.000]  at that when you talk about the very low interest rates that's what they're borrowing at now we're
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:33.240]  borrowing at they are borrowing at the fed window in some cases that actually negative interest rate
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:37.320]  but roughly normally about a quarter percent interest is what the big banks are paying quarter
[2:45:37.320 --> 2:45:43.240]  percent basically nothing and then they are lending to us look at your credit card rates here at
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:48.120]  29 percent in some cases look at what they're charging the european union they're they're
[2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:53.640]  charging italy like nine percent interest and they're getting at a quarter percent interest
[2:45:53.640 --> 2:45:59.000]  the spread is insane and they are making that right look at how they're moving to get rid of
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:03.480]  our credit rating uh you'll guide her saying it never happened knowing they were planning it
[2:46:03.480 --> 2:46:07.400]  they're maneuvering us just like a third world country in a complete receivership
[2:46:09.800 --> 2:46:14.280]  well yeah and what's happening is that we have to so we are lending them money
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:20.440]  at a quarter percent and then we're borrowing it back at massive interest rates i mean what
[2:46:20.440 --> 2:46:24.840]  keep in mind that the banks today are holding a trillion and a half us banks are holding more
[2:46:24.840 --> 2:46:31.400]  than trillion and a half dollars in cash assets what the heck is going on that's our money we guarantee
[2:46:31.400 --> 2:46:35.640]  their fiat currency then they loan it back to us at interest frank does that answer your question
[2:46:35.640 --> 2:46:39.960]  what's your other one it does thank you and another question for both you gentlemen please
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:44.520]  with regards to the occupy movement no matter what we may think about that aren't as effective as
[2:46:44.520 --> 2:46:49.880]  they're not uh mr salente you know alluded to something a few days ago which i think you know
[2:46:49.880 --> 2:46:56.280]  may be a a way of looking at this he was talking about the idea of a boycott that if we if we just
[2:46:56.280 --> 2:47:02.760]  buy local or in fact in many cases not support the system by either a withdrawing our funds from
[2:47:02.760 --> 2:47:08.600]  the economic system yeah that's what i think it says yeah just buying staples and then taking the
[2:47:08.600 --> 2:47:13.640]  money out of the financial system the way we know it i mean that that would cause the so-called
[2:47:13.640 --> 2:47:17.880]  elites a lot of infighting would you gentlemen agree or reflect let me briefly get solution
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:23.160]  ideas from greg and we'll go to kyle and others quickly quickly uh what are solutions and and
[2:47:23.160 --> 2:47:28.200]  particularly uh how about this true local sustainability i mean it's not even so much a
[2:47:28.200 --> 2:47:34.760]  solution it's a survival tactic we're going to have to do this well i think the first simple
[2:47:34.760 --> 2:47:41.000]  step is most most of america and places of texas california new york have community credit unions
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  these are not for profit banks that by law must loan all their money into the community move your
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:53.720]  money there don't buy don't feed the snakes that bite you i have my money at the uh at the new york
[2:47:54.360 --> 2:47:59.160]  community credit union lower east side peoples federal they were the ones that by the way
[2:47:59.160 --> 2:48:04.120]  are occupy wall streets banker and they're the ones that goldman sacks is trying to shut down
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:09.880]  because they're so that's the interesting thing these guys like goldman and capital one is is
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:14.520]  going on a war path against the community credit unions which means that they're probably a very
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:20.120]  good idea a good place to put your money they're safe and they're insured uh they're uh and they
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:25.960]  loan into the community they do not do they are prohibited from doing the ribbons instead of just
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:30.840]  being even in local banks i'm going to move mainly into credit unions with the info wars piggy bank

[2:54:09.640 --> 2:54:15.720]  and key analysis with erin dykes coming up in the third hour today greg that's pretty much the same
[2:54:15.720 --> 2:54:19.960]  question i asked earlier but you didn't get to answer because we ran out of time coming into a break
[2:54:21.320 --> 2:54:23.800]  what is the financial future going to look like
[2:54:23.800 --> 2:54:33.000]  um a if we're able to just imprison these guys and turn this around or b if they just have
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  their way and keep driving forward or is it gonna be a mix of the two i mean is is is argentina the
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:46.360]  type of situation we're looking at well it's kind of up to us in the case of argentina things hit
[2:54:46.360 --> 2:54:51.160]  rock bottom as they did in ecuador people you know like i say teachers eating out of garbage cans
[2:54:51.160 --> 2:54:55.160]  so people went into the streets banging pots and pans and saying that they weren't going to work
[2:54:55.160 --> 2:55:01.080]  it's all done they they have to eat and democracy took over in the economy sword they told the banks
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:05.800]  to go buzz off and that's that i mean and the and the guy who's screaming about it by the way
[2:55:05.800 --> 2:55:10.440]  the number one you know my book vultures picnic the number one vulture finance here in america is
[2:55:10.440 --> 2:55:17.480]  guy named paul singer by the way he was just named as mit romney's top economic advisor uh hello so
[2:55:17.480 --> 2:55:21.240]  what's going to happen and that doesn't mean that obama is going to be a better choice because his
[2:55:21.240 --> 2:55:27.240]  top economic advisor is robert rubin you know of city bank and care of the candidates they got they
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:33.160]  got both parties i just wanted to make it official i tell you it's official now that the the uber
[2:55:33.160 --> 2:55:39.640]  the uber vulture who is screaming bloody murder about argentina telling the banks telling him to
[2:55:39.640 --> 2:55:45.240]  take his bonds and fly with them the vulture ecuador did the same thing and you know because
[2:55:45.240 --> 2:55:49.800]  democracy took hold it was pretty painful people went into the streets and were burning down the
[2:55:49.800 --> 2:55:54.360]  capital the the indians came out of the mountains but they said we're going to vote our way to
[2:55:54.360 --> 2:55:59.240]  freedom we're not going to uh you know we're not going to say oh we'll just turn over the banks
[2:55:59.240 --> 2:56:04.040]  because we know how difficult it is we are out of control we spend too much money and the money
[2:56:04.040 --> 2:56:10.360]  really should go to the bankers but unfortunately i see in europe there seems to be no organized
[2:56:10.360 --> 2:56:17.240]  dissenting force and so where is america stand are we going to be well i mean i mean i mean this is
[2:56:17.240 --> 2:56:24.360]  good maybe this is good to let them go all the way and really show people what bankster global
[2:56:24.360 --> 2:56:29.720]  is tearing he is before people finally wake up we'll take another call here uh craig in connecticut
[2:56:29.720 --> 2:56:35.080]  you're on the air with greg palace go ahead craig great thanks alex uh and hi greg how are you
[2:56:35.080 --> 2:56:41.560]  quick question for you um you've been doing a lot of analogies to uh the case uh with madeoff uh to
[2:56:41.560 --> 2:56:47.000]  mf global i think one key difference that i'm seeing right now is that the trusty erving peccard
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:53.640]  for the uh for the bankruptcy with madeoff he's been doing a phenomenal job in tracing the assets
[2:56:53.640 --> 2:56:59.480]  where they went clawing them back from people who had the sweetheart deals do you guys have any
[2:56:59.480 --> 2:57:04.600]  insight in terms of the trusty that's that's here is he a globalist is the trusty to be trusted
[2:57:04.600 --> 2:57:09.880]  you know if you know it doesn't look good i'll talk to salente and others and now two three weeks
[2:57:09.880 --> 2:57:14.280]  into this they're saying we're not going to discuss where the money is and you're just you know not
[2:57:14.280 --> 2:57:20.200]  going to get it back uh but then we saw that kind of reverse with the cmt group uh come in and and
[2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:25.320]  dump 300 million in but that's not going to satisfy people because this is a lot bigger amount greg
[2:57:25.320 --> 2:57:33.080]  palace um well actually that's one of the things i'm very concerned about is who exactly is going
[2:57:33.080 --> 2:57:38.600]  to be uh on top of this ship there's two types of trustees you're right the card at the on the
[2:57:38.600 --> 2:57:42.520]  madeoff deal i think he's he's shocked everyone but actually saying wait a minute there's some guys
[2:57:42.520 --> 2:57:46.120]  who got some sweetheart deals and he's trying to claw him back he doesn't have much legal authority
[2:57:46.120 --> 2:57:51.720]  to do that uh just keep in mind and he's only been only one of the big billionaires has given back
[2:57:51.720 --> 2:57:56.360]  the money actually the guy who died his wife gave it back and she didn't want blood money uh but in
[2:57:56.360 --> 2:58:01.080]  the case of mf global i'm worried we're going to end up with something like the bp situation
[2:58:01.080 --> 2:58:06.120]  where the number where the trustees this guy ken feinberg who's usually uses their big trusty
[2:58:06.680 --> 2:58:12.920]  and uh he's known otherwise known as the reptile now uh when they stand there let's hear about
[2:58:12.920 --> 2:58:32.280]  the reptile on the other side great question caller uh great question from craig more calls straight ahead
