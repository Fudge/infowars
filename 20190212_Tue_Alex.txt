[00:00.000 --> 00:19.240]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info
[00:19.240 --> 00:48.440]  War. Tuesday, February 12, 2019 on your host Alex Jones.
[00:48.440 --> 00:55.000]  And when we say this is the most demonized, most lied about, most attacked broadcast in the world,
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.440]  it's the truth. Think about that. What is it we're saying? What is it we're doing that scares the
[01:02.440 --> 01:07.520]  establishment so much? And if you know the answer to that, you know how to defeat the anti-human
[01:07.520 --> 01:11.800]  agenda, the globalist agenda. Whatever's running it, whatever's at the bottom of that spider hole,
[01:11.800 --> 01:16.640]  it wants to hurt innocent children, it wants to dumb us down, it wants to poison us, it wants to
[01:16.640 --> 01:22.400]  kill us, it wants to destroy our dreams, it wants to suck our very essence out of us. And I'm
[01:22.400 --> 01:29.120]  extremely honored to take these globalists on, but I'm also enraged at points that I don't have
[01:29.120 --> 01:34.680]  the will of the strength to defeat them quickly enough. And it is our spirit, the enemy wants
[01:34.680 --> 01:38.600]  to shut down, but I want to salute and thank the listeners and viewers for everything you do,
[01:38.600 --> 01:47.320]  because you are the engine of the resistance and without you there is nothing. You know,
[01:47.320 --> 01:54.240]  there's a lot obviously to cover here today, quite a bit. And this news and information is all so
[01:54.240 --> 02:06.360]  epic that I literally have trouble even processing it, but I'm going to do my best today to do it.
[02:06.360 --> 02:14.520]  And we do have Gavin McInnis and Ali Alexander, both very interesting informed fellows in studio
[02:14.520 --> 02:21.720]  with us. Gavin has just launched a lawsuit obviously last week against the evil offshore
[02:21.720 --> 02:30.520]  foreign intelligence operation known as the Southern Private Law Center. I'm going to tell you
[02:30.520 --> 02:34.000]  some secrets about the Southern Private Law Center today that nobody knows except those
[02:34.000 --> 02:43.440]  in the inside of it and those that have done deep, deep research and penetrated their operation.
[02:43.440 --> 02:52.600]  So remind me to do that when they come on today. Another reason they want to stop the year,
[02:52.600 --> 02:59.280]  but when we come back, I'm going to plunge directly into the news and I'm going to get
[02:59.280 --> 03:08.320]  into all the news that we have here in front of us. There's a big op-ed by George Soros in
[03:08.320 --> 03:17.320]  MarketWatch. That's the Wall Street Journal online. And he says word for word, Europe is on the verge
[03:17.320 --> 03:24.400]  of collapsing. That is the EU like the old Soviet Union. Isn't that amazing because that's what
[03:24.400 --> 03:29.880]  we've likened the EU to as an authoritarian Soviet Union, unelected bureaucracy over the
[03:29.880 --> 03:36.960]  member states. It's not Europe. It's the globalist control arm. And then he calls for a structure
[03:36.960 --> 03:43.920]  to force nations to stay in it. What a incredible authoritarian statement. I mean, we're talking
[03:43.920 --> 03:51.120]  a literal Nazi collaborator promoting the Nazi plan of the European Union. That's on record
[03:51.120 --> 03:59.120]  that it's a Nazi plan and saying use force to keep people in while they open the borders and
[03:59.120 --> 04:08.400]  collapse the nation states. What a fabulously evil statement. And that's just one of the hundreds of
[04:08.400 --> 04:13.440]  articles that I read last night and this morning. You know, that's part of my frustration. Part of
[04:13.440 --> 04:18.240]  the reason I get so hyped up when I go on air is that I've just been reading this and watching
[04:18.240 --> 04:23.520]  this for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours. And then I go crazy on air. Everybody
[04:23.520 --> 04:28.880]  to know the real me is like this. Pretty calm, pretty focused. But I get to a hysterical point
[04:28.880 --> 04:37.200]  because that was just one of the articles. Here's the next one. The police in New York said that a
[04:37.200 --> 04:42.400]  man that stabbed a woman to death and killed the baby on purpose. He got her pregnant. They said,
[04:42.400 --> 04:47.120]  no, he's not being charged. He's allowed to kill the baby. The law says so. Yeah, you heard me right.
[04:47.120 --> 04:51.920]  This isn't a Twilight Zone episode. This is America, right by the demonic left.
[04:52.480 --> 04:55.920]  Every blue city is a festering cancer. Stay with us.
[05:09.600 --> 05:15.920]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world
[05:15.920 --> 05:22.480]  is energy drinks and energy supplements. But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[05:22.480 --> 05:27.280]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours
[05:27.280 --> 05:31.600]  and have terrible side effects. We have developed hands down from our research,
[05:31.600 --> 05:37.280]  the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.440]  There's nothing else like it. You must experience it. It is a total game changer. It comes in easy
[05:43.440 --> 05:48.000]  to use, packaged, mixed with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like. Warning though,
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.240]  it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half packet the first time you take it
[05:52.240 --> 05:57.840]  because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive. TurboForce,
[05:57.840 --> 06:16.880]  and enforcelife.com. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[06:16.880 --> 06:27.760]  front lines of the InfoWar. Gavin McGinnis, Ali Alexander will be in studio in the second half
[06:27.760 --> 06:33.520]  of the broadcast. All Joseph Watson will join us from her Britannic majesties. Command base, London.
[06:35.600 --> 06:43.600]  Should say her Transylvanian majesty. It's Tuesday, February 12th, 2019. Our president is
[06:43.600 --> 06:52.160]  Donald J. Trump, 45. And I'm your host, Alex Jones from Austin, Texas, 45 years old yesterday.
[06:52.960 --> 07:00.880]  Again, it is the year of 45. So much happening, so much unfolding. Let me just do this.
[07:03.680 --> 07:08.480]  When you study globalists and you study their publications, they have business publications
[07:09.040 --> 07:12.480]  that pretty much tell you what's going on because business readers are going to be
[07:12.480 --> 07:16.160]  investing in things. They really want to know what's going on for sophisticated audiences.
[07:17.680 --> 07:21.840]  And they hide it in plain view. George Soros just came out in the Wall Street Journal
[07:22.400 --> 07:30.240]  and MarketWatch online and not bad and said, we need authoritarianism in the Euro or it's going
[07:30.240 --> 07:34.240]  to collapse like the Soviet Union and we need an EU army to smash resistance.
[07:34.240 --> 07:42.800]  That's just sensational evil. We're going to be getting to that article. Europe may be on the
[07:42.800 --> 07:50.720]  cusp of a nightmare, but it's not too late to wake up. Twitter and up or over Soros analogy
[07:50.720 --> 07:57.680]  comparing EU to USSR, which of course, we've always called it that. This is the same project
[07:57.680 --> 08:03.040]  from the very same people. I will explain it at the bottom of the hour. I'm going to cover that
[08:03.040 --> 08:10.160]  little jewel. Then I pulled together a bunch of articles on the latest censorship where Apple and
[08:10.160 --> 08:16.480]  Google admit their censoring in America and all over different nations, tailoring it for Islamic
[08:16.480 --> 08:22.960]  censors, communist censors, fascist censors, autocratic censors, and then they go to Congress
[08:22.960 --> 08:28.240]  and say nothing's happening. It's, it's flagrant lies. We're going to be getting to all of that
[08:28.240 --> 08:36.320]  bombshell info because natural news is now published. It's up on informers.com. The screenshots of
[08:36.320 --> 08:42.000]  Apple officially telling them we will not accept your news app. Even it talks about abortions,
[08:42.880 --> 08:48.640]  Satanism, and a whole bunch of other things. You talk about committed to evil. This is it.
[08:49.200 --> 08:55.360]  So this is refusing you and having a loyalty test basically before you can even have an app
[08:55.360 --> 09:01.520]  to then get out on the internet. An incredible communist Chinese level censorship. Well, they
[09:01.520 --> 09:05.040]  already been banning and controlling thousands of apps in China, of course.
[09:07.600 --> 09:14.240]  This is here. This is happening. You knew it was coming. I'm going to cover this in the next segment.
[09:14.240 --> 09:22.000]  It begins. This is not, this is not a joke. This is ominous. They're defending it. Governor Cuomo
[09:22.000 --> 09:30.800]  is defending it. Man spared charge for stabbing unborn baby to death due to New York abortion
[09:30.800 --> 09:35.760]  law. That's an info wars.com article. And the headline, Jimmy White did a great job,
[09:35.760 --> 09:41.120]  but the headline is not even strong enough. It should be man stabs woman to death and unbung
[09:41.120 --> 09:49.520]  baby. I can't even come with a headline strong enough. It's New York says that a man can legally
[09:49.520 --> 09:54.240]  stab a baby to death. I mean, that's it. New York, no charges for man who stabbed unborn
[09:54.240 --> 10:01.040]  baby to death. That's your headline. Let's just change it. New York City announces no charges.
[10:02.240 --> 10:06.800]  No charges for man who stabbed unborn baby to death. And they say it with a straight face.
[10:06.800 --> 10:12.640]  They go, no, the new law says anybody anywhere anytime can kill a baby even when they come out
[10:12.640 --> 10:19.920]  of the womb. Fact will keep those little buggers alive and get their organs. I'll get you your
[10:19.920 --> 10:27.360]  little, your little organs too, my prettys. This must be done delicately though by our moral compass
[10:27.360 --> 10:33.200]  that the governor's not calling himself in Virginia. He will teach us reconciliation. He's calling for
[10:35.360 --> 10:41.280]  reparations because he is in blackface or in a KK outfit. We're not sure which one,
[10:41.280 --> 10:48.320]  you know, his official yearbook photo. We get to all pay people money.
[10:50.240 --> 10:58.000]  Just unbelievable. Oh, and the black liberal commentator fawns over him. She just fawns
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.040]  over him. Oh, it's so sweet. Tell me about those little babies. You keep alive and get their goodies.
[11:05.040 --> 11:07.280]  So we're going to be breaking that down. That's not Twilight Zone.
[11:07.280 --> 11:12.640]  Also, as Gallup pulled in a big study in Central and South America, five million are
[11:12.640 --> 11:16.800]  planning to come here illegally this year of the 40 plus million on the asylum list.
[11:17.920 --> 11:22.480]  We've got all the highlights of the Trump rally last night. We'll be getting to those.
[11:24.720 --> 11:30.640]  And so the first clip I want to play is of Beta O'Rourke, excuse me, Pito O'Rourke.
[11:30.640 --> 11:37.920]  I always get his name wrong. Not Pito, not Beta O'Rourke. Pito or whatever his name is. You know,
[11:37.920 --> 11:46.160]  the fake guy with giant buck teeth. And so we're going to play him in his little tiny crowd last
[11:46.160 --> 11:57.280]  night of a few thousand people, a few thousand people. I mean, the news said a few thousand.
[11:57.280 --> 12:00.880]  Let's just go with a few thousand. Looks like a few hundred to me versus Trump's giant crowd.
[12:00.880 --> 12:06.160]  We're going to show you all that video that our crew shot last night down there in South Texas
[12:06.160 --> 12:12.800]  on the border in El Paso. But the first thing we're going to get to is him saying that
[12:14.000 --> 12:20.640]  walls are immoral and that walls are bad. Let me give you the exact quote. He says,
[12:20.640 --> 12:26.480]  walls don't save lives. They end lives. So that's why you have a cell wall. You have skin. You have
[12:26.480 --> 12:34.560]  doors on your house. You have steel cages in your car. You put babies in safety seats. You have walls
[12:34.560 --> 12:40.720]  around military bases, walls around companies, walls around your home. If you live on a busy
[12:40.720 --> 12:45.600]  street, you better have concrete barriers so somebody doesn't, you know, run their car into
[12:45.600 --> 12:50.240]  your house. That happens routinely. We have these things. That's why they're all over the world.
[12:50.240 --> 12:59.120]  And so this is a war on reality. This is a war on just common sense. Like Alexandria Cortez says,
[12:59.120 --> 13:06.160]  don't worry about deficits. Just spend unlimited. And we'll get rid of airplanes and everything
[13:06.160 --> 13:10.560]  will be free. If you don't want to work, you get money. And then we go, wow, this is your official
[13:10.560 --> 13:15.760]  thing on your website. Yes, it is. Oh, no, it's not. You made it up. It's fake news. These people
[13:15.760 --> 13:21.680]  just are waging war against reality because what they're doing is bad for humanity, period. So here
[13:21.680 --> 13:32.160]  is Beto down on the Texas border. Walls do not make us safer. We know that walls do not save lives.
[13:33.120 --> 13:40.800]  Walls end lives. We stand for America and we stand against walls.
[13:40.800 --> 13:44.640]  And then he does a Hitler salute. Let's stop right there.
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.120]  We're going to go back to it in a moment when we come back. But if you're a TV viewer, you saw it.
[13:51.120 --> 13:56.640]  In fact, let's just roll out that audio for TV viewers please. He is there with a 20 plus foot
[13:57.280 --> 14:03.920]  chain link fence behind him at the stadium where he's meeting for his security. And people had to
[14:03.920 --> 14:10.480]  go through a checkpoint to get in there. So he's surrounded by armed guards. He's got a big fence,
[14:10.480 --> 14:17.680]  a big barrier behind him. But he's telling you and he's telling me and he's telling the world that
[14:17.680 --> 14:25.040]  walls do not work and that walls are bad and that walls are evil. That's like saying bulkheads on
[14:25.040 --> 14:31.520]  ships are bad or bulkhead doors on submarines are bad or your eye having a membrane. That's what
[14:32.160 --> 14:37.440]  contains things. That's what protects things. That's what our bones are a part of a structure.
[14:37.440 --> 14:43.760]  And to have these heavily guarded Democrats and this billionaire Beto, his wife's a billionaire,
[14:43.760 --> 14:51.200]  his father-in-law is worth $27 billion. He flies around in luxury jets.
[14:52.080 --> 14:55.600]  He doesn't go to the regular airports like the rest of us, but that's okay because he's Beto
[14:56.320 --> 15:01.200]  Aurora. We're going to go to break. I want to just remind listeners that Soros and the Democratic
[15:01.200 --> 15:06.000]  Party are officially trying to sue us out of oblivion. We've had some victories. We've had
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.720]  some defeats. The point is, is that we're still moving forward and fighting. And so when you spread
[15:10.720 --> 15:14.640]  the word about the local stations you're listening to or watching us on, when you tell people about
[15:14.640 --> 15:18.400]  infowars.com and say, listen, you've heard about Alex Jones. You've heard about how evil he is.
[15:18.400 --> 15:23.920]  You hear about he's attacked everywhere. You hear how they lie about it. Go hear it for yourself.
[15:23.920 --> 15:29.840]  Go see what it is that's supposedly so bad and so evil and so horrible that the system is fighting
[15:29.840 --> 15:33.840]  as hard as they can to make sure nobody gets to hear it. And then separately to our great audience

[17:28.640 --> 17:34.960]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[17:34.960 --> 17:40.560]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that
[17:40.560 --> 17:47.680]  World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:47.680 --> 17:53.200]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I,
[17:53.200 --> 17:58.080]  the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[20:00.240 --> 20:18.240]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[20:18.240 --> 20:30.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[20:30.640 --> 20:44.240]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:44.240 --> 20:52.880]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and we are broadcasting worldwide. I'm your host,
[20:52.880 --> 21:02.960]  Alex Jones. Okay, let's get into the blackening of all of our hearts. Even if we love God and
[21:02.960 --> 21:08.880]  love children, the system is learning how to manipulate us more and more using psychological
[21:08.880 --> 21:15.760]  warfare to harden our hearts is the biblical term. To harden our hearts, because even if you
[21:15.760 --> 21:20.480]  don't like hurting children or hurting innocent animals or being mean, when you're shown it and
[21:20.480 --> 21:27.680]  you hear about it, you become numb to it. You are dehumanized. And so there's a big article up on
[21:27.680 --> 21:37.200]  infowars.com and newswars.com that you should send to every leftist you know and say, what do you
[21:37.200 --> 21:44.320]  think of this? You know, I know Alex Jones is the bad guy. He questioned Sandy Hook. That's the
[21:44.320 --> 21:48.880]  ultimate crime in the world. Even the government lied about WMDs, lied about babies and incubators.
[21:48.880 --> 21:54.800]  I was watching last night with my daughter's Minions, I think three, where it's based in the
[21:54.800 --> 22:01.920]  60s. And the Minions break into the set of Hollywood and they're shooting the fake Apollo
[22:01.920 --> 22:08.480]  landing. Oh, it's okay for Hollywood to say that the Apollo landings didn't happen. But if I see
[22:08.480 --> 22:13.360]  something that looks pretty synthetic and I say, because the public was saying it, oh, I question
[22:13.360 --> 22:18.480]  that. I'm the worst man in the world. When I walk down the street in Austin, people go, you're an
[22:18.480 --> 22:24.800]  effing Russian. Or they say, how dare you attack those children's parents? And I go, I never did
[22:24.800 --> 22:32.320]  that. They were shut up. But I go, hey, the New York Times and others premeditatedly lied
[22:33.840 --> 22:40.960]  about WMDs in Iraq, and it killed millions. Get out of here, you piece of crap. You're Nazi. F you,
[22:40.960 --> 22:47.920]  Nazi. Meanwhile, they had Gallup polls and others in the last month, all showing the same thing.
[22:47.920 --> 22:54.560]  50 to 55% to 57% of Democrats now just say they're pro-war. They don't care what it is. They want
[22:54.560 --> 23:00.560]  to stay in Afghanistan. They want to stay in Syria, war, war, war, hot and cold running war. Just give
[23:00.560 --> 23:08.960]  us more war. Did we tell you how much we love war? This is a sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick,
[23:08.960 --> 23:14.400]  sick, sick, sick group of people who say they have the moral high ground and everybody else is a
[23:14.400 --> 23:19.680]  Nazi. And their captain is a famous Nazi collaborator who writes op-eds for market
[23:19.680 --> 23:24.640]  watch in the Wall Street Journal saying the euro must become a dictatorship and stop countries
[23:24.640 --> 23:31.360]  from leaving or it'll collapse like the Soviet Union. He defines it as evil and says we should,
[23:31.360 --> 23:36.160]  see, that's the new thing. Let's, let's show TV viewers, radio listeners, anybody can type into
[23:36.160 --> 23:42.160]  a search engine. Governor Cuomo signs post birth abortion bill and there's video and photos of
[23:42.160 --> 23:47.200]  them cackling and them laughing and looking like they're in heaven when they signed this thing.
[23:47.200 --> 23:55.920]  And now Virginia is trying to pass it and other states to kill babies after they're born.
[23:59.360 --> 24:05.440]  So now they've gone to the next level, ladies and gentlemen. Now they've gone to the next level.
[24:06.800 --> 24:14.640]  A man has been arrested for reportedly stabbing a woman to death that he'd been dating
[24:14.640 --> 24:19.440]  who was pregnant. He stabbed her in the stomach till she died saying reportedly he wanted to kill
[24:19.440 --> 24:26.640]  the baby. Yeah, there's a photo of your TV viewers, the smirking, the laughing, the video is the most
[24:26.640 --> 24:30.960]  sickening thing you've ever seen. You'd think they'd all just won the lottery. I mean, even if you
[24:30.960 --> 24:37.200]  think kill babies after they're born, it would be a solemn thing. No, no, no, because these are demonic
[24:37.200 --> 24:42.800]  people showing you who they are. And that's the good news is they can't help but show you who they
[24:42.800 --> 24:51.760]  are. So now this man reportedly stabbed this woman more than 30 times in her stomach screaming,
[24:51.760 --> 24:59.520]  die baby, die. That's in the police report. He wanted that baby dead and dead that baby is and
[24:59.520 --> 25:07.520]  dead the mother is. He then slit her throat. She's another partial birth abortion, isn't she?
[25:07.520 --> 25:14.160]  Poor lady. I guess she's a post birth abortion. And the police say sorry.
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.240]  We're only charging him with one homicide. Doesn't matter that the baby was close to being due.
[25:20.880 --> 25:26.160]  None of that matters. We say babies aren't human. So these statutes are so broad that
[25:26.160 --> 25:30.240]  always if a mother didn't want to abort a baby and somebody kills the mother and the baby,
[25:30.240 --> 25:33.920]  you get charged with double homicide or double capital murder was premeditated.
[25:33.920 --> 25:41.360]  Not anymore, not in New York, man. That's not a person period. Even if you want to say it's a
[25:41.360 --> 25:46.480]  person, even if you want to protect it, they're dehumanizing it. The poor baby, little boy, little
[25:46.480 --> 25:51.680]  girl, I guess it'd be a mixed race baby, a black guy and a white lady.
[25:54.560 --> 26:00.240]  And so you've got a poor little black baby getting murdered by its daddy
[26:00.240 --> 26:05.200]  with a butcher knife. But oh, we're only going to charge you for killing mama.
[26:06.800 --> 26:11.440]  And that's America 2019. It begins. Man
[26:14.240 --> 26:20.480]  spared charge for stabbing unborn baby due to New York abortion law. Translate that.
[26:21.840 --> 26:25.600]  Man stabs baby to death. New York says it's legal.
[26:25.600 --> 26:35.120]  New York, no charges for man who stabbed unborn baby to death. That's the reality 2019. A Queens
[26:35.120 --> 26:41.920]  man who beat and stabbed his pregnant girlfriend and her baby to death was spared abortion charges
[26:41.920 --> 26:46.880]  thanks to New York's recently enacted abortion law. Queens District Attorney Richard Brown
[26:46.880 --> 26:52.160]  initially released a statement saying 48 year old Anthony Hobson would be charged with murder
[26:52.160 --> 26:59.040]  and abortion for the fatal stabbing of his girlfriend Jennifer. You're going earlier this month.
[26:59.040 --> 27:03.920]  A woman was brutally stabbed killing her baby and the unborn child Brown said a statement.
[27:03.920 --> 27:08.720]  The defendant is alleged to have shown no mercy and no regard for human life when he repeatedly
[27:08.720 --> 27:15.120]  and purposely plunged the knife into his expected mother's abdomen torso and neck.
[27:15.120 --> 27:21.280]  But a DA spokesperson later revised the charges, noting that the abortion charge was repealed
[27:21.280 --> 27:27.040]  by the legislature and this is the law as it exists today, close quote. Authorities believe
[27:27.040 --> 27:32.240]  Hobson was directly targeting the baby because he didn't want to be the father. Democrat Governor
[27:32.240 --> 27:37.920]  Andrew Cuomo signed reproductive health act into law to a chorus of applause on the 40th anniversary
[27:37.920 --> 27:42.720]  of Roe v. Wade legalizing abortion up to the moment of full term delivery. Additionally,
[27:42.720 --> 27:47.760]  the updated legislation removes the state fetal homicide law from the criminal code so other people
[27:47.760 --> 27:54.160]  can kill babies now. And it's not a human. Think about the magnitude of that. As I said in my floor
[27:54.160 --> 27:59.280]  speech, being assaulted or in this case murdered and losing your baby is not a woman's choice,
[27:59.280 --> 28:07.040]  said Republican or Assemblywoman Nicole Malatukas. As I said in my floor speech, and it goes on from
[28:07.040 --> 28:15.760]  there. So now Malatakis, however you say it, this is the evil in your face. And in New York as well,
[28:15.760 --> 28:22.400]  they have nine, 10, 11 year old little boys dressed like girls at strip gay bars having money thrown
[28:22.400 --> 28:28.400]  at them and then meeting on TV with convicted acts murderers talking about using drugs. Little drug
[28:28.400 --> 28:33.200]  dot kids all skinny look like they're dying, dressed like girls with convicted famous murderers
[28:33.200 --> 28:40.800]  out of prison talking about using drugs. You cannot make it up. You cannot make up how evil
[28:40.800 --> 28:47.040]  these people are. And there's no limit. They're never going to stop until we say no to them.
[28:47.840 --> 28:53.840]  America is dying. The world has satanic cancer. Only getting our knees to Jesus Christ is going
[28:53.840 --> 29:02.480]  to fix it. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries,

[33:49.440 --> 33:55.760]  all these worldly people say alex you're under attack everywhere lies to see demonization
[33:56.320 --> 34:06.240]  you're a loser no my friends i'm a winner take a good look at it i don't enjoy this one bit
[34:07.040 --> 34:12.160]  having to put my name my treasure my children my guts my soul on the line
[34:12.160 --> 34:22.240]  my soul won't let me do anything else in fact my soul is like a big group of 12 horses
[34:23.280 --> 34:34.240]  pulling a weapon and god's got that whip digging the spurs in i got frost blood coming out
[34:34.880 --> 34:41.040]  and i'm the happiest horse you could ever imagine just to get that weapon in place
[34:41.040 --> 34:45.440]  to get the truth in place and i can see the ridge we're almost there
[34:46.480 --> 34:50.800]  and i can roll over and collapse and that big gun's gonna swing around right on the enemy
[34:50.800 --> 34:57.120]  and it's gonna unload in the information war we've already begun to launch operations that
[34:57.120 --> 35:04.320]  are unstoppable at this point and i thank god for driving me or i'd never do this my problem is i'm
[35:04.320 --> 35:12.080]  too driven my problem is i had no fear of the enemy only fear of god and then i see them
[35:12.080 --> 35:19.360]  literally celebrating satanism in the albany new york state house laughing and giggling
[35:19.360 --> 35:24.000]  about how they're going to keep babies alive and harvest their organs believe it that's the whole point
[35:26.080 --> 35:32.640]  and it makes me sick but let's let's let's let's juxtapose to people johnny karson
[35:32.640 --> 35:37.440]  who i know folks that do him well as it was a great really good guy but was also upset about
[35:37.440 --> 35:42.240]  evil and things in the world and was very depressed most of his life actually so i did comedy trying
[35:42.240 --> 35:50.320]  to not commit suicide juxtapose johnny karson with walter kronkite who was a big globalist
[35:50.880 --> 35:56.400]  into one world government absolutely recruited when he was in austin texas by the nwo
[35:56.400 --> 36:05.040]  juxtapose those two people before i go to this next big story that is so massive
[36:05.040 --> 36:08.960]  it shapes the entire future of the planet let's hear from walter kronkite first then we'll go
[36:08.960 --> 36:15.680]  right into johnny karson pat robertson has written in a book a few years ago that we
[36:15.680 --> 36:25.200]  should have a world government but only when the messiah arrives he rose and literally any attempt
[36:25.200 --> 36:33.600]  to achieve world order before that time must be the work of the devil well join me i'm i'm
[36:33.600 --> 36:39.680]  glad to sit here at the right hand to see do you get sensitive about the fact that people say
[36:39.680 --> 36:45.520]  he'll never take a serious controversy well i have an answer to that i said now tell me the
[36:45.520 --> 36:54.480]  last time that jack benny redskillton uh benny comedian used his show to do serious issues
[36:54.480 --> 36:59.440]  that's not what i'm there for can't they see that but you're neither they think that just
[36:59.440 --> 37:04.720]  because you have a tonight show that you must deal with serious issues that's a danger it's a real
[37:04.720 --> 37:10.880]  danger once you start that you start to get that self-important feeling that's what you say has
[37:10.880 --> 37:15.040]  great import and you know strangely enough you could use that show as a forum you could sway
[37:15.040 --> 37:28.160]  people and i don't think you should as an entertainer we're surrounded by followers
[37:30.160 --> 37:35.680]  we're surrounded by people that think going along with the system is going to get them ahead and for
[37:35.680 --> 37:42.960]  the last 50 60 years that's been the case monetarily while you lose your soul while we lose our country
[37:42.960 --> 37:49.840]  while we lose our strength or we lose our will but now we're getting down to the time when
[37:50.480 --> 37:57.840]  following orders will get you destroyed and where we just have a nation of cowards
[37:58.720 --> 38:05.360]  preening cowards all looking for their place in the hierarchy in the pantheon
[38:07.120 --> 38:08.320]  that's really a panopticon
[38:08.320 --> 38:13.760]  it's going to go to our next big story here i mentioned at the first broadcast but
[38:15.280 --> 38:20.000]  this is just as big as new york and other states legalizing killing babies after they're born
[38:20.560 --> 38:26.640]  and now when somebody shoots a woman or stabs a woman and even premeditatedly says i'm going
[38:26.640 --> 38:29.680]  to kill that baby like charlie manson did share and take
[38:29.680 --> 38:37.280]  the government says we're not charging you because you just killed some tissue
[38:40.720 --> 38:47.920]  how much fun these are a group of monsters but let's go to the next report here
[38:47.920 --> 38:57.360]  here europe may be on the cusp of a nightmare but it's not too late to wake up
[38:57.360 --> 39:03.600]  and who wrote it george soros so zoom in on this for me and i'm going to read this for folks
[39:04.320 --> 39:08.960]  there's a boil down article on info wars dot com that gets right to the quotes
[39:08.960 --> 39:22.240]  mr new world order twitter in uproar over soros analogy comparing eu to the ussr
[39:22.800 --> 39:31.280]  what if i compared it for my 20 years plus on air but to the ussr the very same multinational
[39:31.280 --> 39:39.680]  globalist forces that put v island in power and then propped up stalin the very same forces
[39:41.920 --> 39:50.000]  that created a bipolar multipolar world as a pretext to launch western globalist expansion
[39:50.880 --> 39:56.320]  juxtaposed to soviet expansion instead of having global peace if we would have ever
[39:56.320 --> 40:02.960]  allied with russia early on as statisticians and experts and historians have been saying since the
[40:02.960 --> 40:10.400]  days of uh lincoln we should have done that's the clear strategic regional control of the world a us
[40:10.400 --> 40:17.280]  russia alliance is unbreakable the resources the militaries the people the the the iqs it's
[40:17.280 --> 40:24.160]  unstoppable and it's been the british model which is not the british people but their evil crown
[40:24.160 --> 40:35.040]  has been obsessed in mainline news reports since the 1770s with making sure a us russo alliance
[40:35.040 --> 40:44.000]  never takes place and that's why we inflicted them that is our globalist elites in 1917
[40:44.880 --> 40:51.200]  with the horrible bolshevik disease all paid for out of london england supplied with
[40:51.200 --> 40:58.800]  immigrants from russia who've been living in the us less than a generation a 100 000 man army
[41:00.400 --> 41:07.920]  shipped in paid in gold paid in spoils so now we move on to george soros the nazi collaborator
[41:08.880 --> 41:13.840]  the e u being a nazi plan just don't believe me type in european union was a nazi plan
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.040]  you'll get bbc a little until london telegraph it's not debated it came out in the nuremberg trials
[41:19.040 --> 41:26.240]  the big hitler plan was the capital of europe would be in berlin with uh
[41:28.720 --> 41:33.920]  a capital dome i think was like 10 times bigger than the us dome all the big domes of the world
[41:33.920 --> 41:39.920]  he wanted to be able to fit inside it never happened he was going to this gigantic thing
[41:39.920 --> 41:44.960]  and he would europe would run the world they'd have a european union and hitler even sketched
[41:44.960 --> 41:51.520]  the stars in the blue background the gold stars he he sketched the um he sketched the um
[41:52.560 --> 41:57.360]  again everything uh the the vaults wagon was his idea he drew the original design uh he uh
[41:57.360 --> 42:03.120]  outie uh the olympic symbol uh just everything's hitler space program hitler hitler hitler
[42:03.920 --> 42:08.320]  evil guy uh very demonically uh influence very smart

[42:25.920 --> 42:31.920]  we need to crush europe and not let them leave and he compares it to the fall of the ussr which
[42:31.920 --> 42:40.560]  we can't allow oh yeah george herbert walker bush was flipping out when the ussr fell in 1991
[42:40.560 --> 42:44.320]  and that's why all the fake right wing stuff said oh it's all staged they're planning to come back as

[49:47.280 --> 49:53.440]  all right let's get right into the news here so george soros the nazi collaborator promoting
[49:53.440 --> 50:00.720]  the nazi plan of hitler the eu has come out in market watch and said everything i ever said
[50:00.720 --> 50:07.680]  about the eu it's authoritarian it's unelected he needs to control and dominate the nation states
[50:07.680 --> 50:12.720]  and it's like the old soviet union but that's a good thing europe may be on the cusp of a
[50:12.720 --> 50:18.400]  nightmare but it's not too late to wake up that's right and flood europe with more islamicists
[50:18.400 --> 50:23.520]  who don't get jobs and are 80 plus percent welfare to the state controls
[50:24.880 --> 50:32.640]  mr new world order twitter in uproar over soros analogy comparing eu to the ussr
[50:34.960 --> 50:38.960]  george soros has written an op-ed for market watch a finance and investing news site yeah
[50:38.960 --> 50:43.280]  that's one with a wall street journal warning that anti-european forces now that don't know
[50:43.280 --> 50:52.240]  the eu is the anti-european they're the anti-nation state may enjoy an advantage at the upcoming
[50:52.240 --> 50:56.400]  european parliament elections in may even though that's a ceremonial parliament the eu is a
[50:56.400 --> 51:04.640]  dictatorship it still is a bully pulpit to expose the whole thing the hungarian-born billionaire
[51:05.360 --> 51:11.360]  outlawed in the nation he helped round up his fellow jews has been waging an ideological war
[51:11.360 --> 51:16.240]  with conservative eurosceptic forces in countries such as hungary poland in italy
[51:16.240 --> 51:21.680]  spending hundreds of millions of dollars on his open society foundations in geos across europe and
[51:21.680 --> 51:26.720]  the united states george soros has written an op-ed for market watch a finance and investing
[51:26.720 --> 51:32.240]  news site warning that anti-european forces may have enjoyed an advantage the upcoming european
[51:32.240 --> 51:40.800]  parliament elections in may urging in his voice sleeping pro european majority not to sleepwalk
[51:40.800 --> 51:48.240]  into oblivion soros made the eyebrow raising argument by suggesting that if they don't the european
[51:48.240 --> 51:58.240]  union will go the way of the soviet union in 1991 one can still make a case for preserving the eu
[51:58.240 --> 52:04.800]  in order to radically reinvent it but that would require a change of heart in the eu
[52:04.800 --> 52:10.320]  soros stressed the current leadership is reminiscent of the pollute bureau when the
[52:10.320 --> 52:18.240]  soviet union collapsed continuing to issue orders as if they were still relevant yes like
[52:18.240 --> 52:24.560]  her hitler in the bunker the upcoming european parliamentary elections are set to become
[52:25.440 --> 52:31.920]  an infection point for the european project the billionaire argued according to soros oh funny
[52:31.920 --> 52:38.880]  what am i called by she and an msnbc an infection a disease alex johns is a
[52:39.680 --> 52:47.520]  virus he must be silenced he gives them spirit he is willing to stand against us we must first
[52:48.320 --> 52:56.720]  destroy his name bankrupt him before we kill him do not make him a martyr destroy him first
[52:56.720 --> 53:07.040]  then i will have my victory over him sorry the upcoming european parliamentary elections
[53:07.040 --> 53:11.440]  oh george the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray
[53:14.160 --> 53:18.480]  the upcoming european parliamentary elections are set to become an infection an infection
[53:18.480 --> 53:25.760]  plant for a european project oh the european project whose project is that the billionaire argued
[53:25.760 --> 53:33.360]  the european project according to soros and the eu forces enjoy an advantage thanks to an
[53:33.360 --> 53:40.240]  outdated party system yes you must get rid of them voting the the practical impossibility
[53:41.040 --> 53:48.880]  of changing the eu treaty and a lack of legal tools for disciplining disciplining yes i'm being
[53:48.880 --> 53:56.560]  disciplined lack of legal tools for disciplining member states that violate the principles on
[53:56.560 --> 54:03.840]  which the european union was founded close court soros marked particular concern with germany's
[54:03.840 --> 54:11.040]  alternative for deutsland a right wing euro skeptic anti mass immigration party which he
[54:11.040 --> 54:17.760]  derided as extremist at the same time soros praised the german greens calling him the only
[54:17.760 --> 54:25.360]  consistently pro european party in the country and one that like the afd has also been rising in
[54:25.360 --> 54:31.680]  popularity put that in your pipe and smoke it

[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:14.080]  ridiculous statement but here is a report splc praise on american unity it's critical
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:24.800]  for years the splc's bullying of conservatives and typical everyday americans amounted to that of an
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:30.880]  annoying blood-sucking mosquito but the temptation of that untapped vein appears to be leading to
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:38.240]  the downfall of the splc since the early 1970s splc founder morris deez had fed on the civil
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:44.000]  rights victory of wrestling down the last remnants of the democratic party creation known as the
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.880]  kuklux clan drinking from its wealthy liberal donors which also led to the splc's nine figure
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:56.320]  endowment but how do you keep the hate fighting money rolling in when generation x the children
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:02.640]  of integration all got along for the most part and the dying culture of racism in america seemed
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:09.760]  to be on its last leg well you rebrand racism fuel it with marx's critical theory and deliver
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:15.920]  that to the gullible little brothers and sisters of generation x the millennials as the washington
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:21.680]  free beacon reported the southern poverty law center a left-wing nonprofit known for its hate
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:28.320]  group designations now has 92 million dollars in offshore investment five times that according to
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:34.960]  financial statements the splc has been thriving since president donald trump entered the white
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:43.920]  house the controversial organization reported 477 million in total assets and 132 million
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:50.400]  in contributions on its most recent tax forms millions flow to the group following the deadly
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:56.720]  charlottesville virginia attacks from employees at companies including jp morgan chase and apple
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.960]  and that was staged by sorrishers such as george cloney and so here we are up to our necks and divide
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.880]  and conquer hysteria in the midst of it proud boys founder political commentator and fellow
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:16.400]  generation xer gavin mcginnis has had enough the splc has positioned themselves with such
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:22.320]  immense power that they are now infiltrating not just big tech where they decide who can say what
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.720]  but they're getting involved in banking and they're getting involved with the way everyone
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.680]  can do business they're bankrupting people and they're ruining innocent people careers i mean
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:44.240]  i'm doing this as much for deputy brian green who was fired from louisiana law enforcement
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.960]  for being a proud boy this guy volunteered doing women's self-defense on the weekends
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:54.160]  is a stalwart of the community graduated head of his class in the academy and he's now lucky
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:59.200]  if he can get air conditioning work this is actually worse than communism because in communism
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:05.040]  you would go to the gulag you'd go to the reeducation camp and you'd come back vindicated
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:11.120]  in today's america with this witch hunt you're never vindicated so once you're a bigot once
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:16.880]  you're a homophobe racist transphobe anti-semai whatever that's permanently on your record thanks
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.320]  to the splc and you can never recover from that like the people that i'm representing here the
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:27.680]  people that i'm fighting for they'll always be googleable as part of a hate group and they you
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:33.040]  know the splc starts with bonafide bigots maybe like five percent of their total list and then
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.320]  they just spread that out and include everyone remotely christian everyone remotely conservative
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:45.040]  and they make this massive hate map that makes america look like a racist hellhole the family
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:51.040]  research council the black security guard was shot defending them and then the guy who shot them
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.160]  said he wanted to kill as many people as he could the steve scolese shooting was based on the splc
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.200]  hate group just the other day charles murray was at middlebury college and the students were so
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:06.480]  rabid that they attacked a professor got in the way of the attack was hospitalized this is all
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:14.480]  due to the splc's hate group they are fomenting hate they are a hate group and as pj media reported
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:20.000]  baltimore attorney glenn keith allen is suing the southern poverty law center for racketeering

[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:34.000]  the splc's 501c3 tax exempt status which could seriously cripple the organization fortunately
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.680]  there is something we can all do to make a difference go to defend gavin dot com and give
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:46.800]  what you can to take on the bloated anti-american goliath known as the splc because division

[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:25.200]  is obedience to god it's alex jones the spirit of america the spirit of 1776 the spirit of god's
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:35.440]  real providence and blessing has been bestowed to our republic and to info wars and i am a dirty
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:42.960]  beggar in god's presence my best is dirty rags but i am a true and faithful servant to god
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:49.840]  and i have asked for what's happened and i've been committed to carry it out and i've never been
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:56.080]  happier and i want to thank all of you for your prayers your support because we're in this together
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:05.360]  and i salute you all i'm going to get to a bunch of clips from trump in
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:15.520]  south texas down on the border with mexico and i'm going to play some of the beta or
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:20.240]  videos as well if you're a radio listener i'll describe it obviously it's critical that you
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.360]  go to info wars.com so you can actually see this because we had two of our reporters
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:35.040]  greg rees and drew down there and the pedo or or sorry pedo or or crowd
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:43.040]  man looked like maybe 500 the news said a couple thousand then they said trump was lying and that
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:47.680]  didn't have 30 something thousand we have photos of you eight thousand inside tens of thousands
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:53.520]  outside 50 something thousand rsvp it doesn't matter the point is the guy had a pathetically
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.800]  small crowd i couldn't believe it there's our footage we shot
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:05.840]  and he also spoke inside a stadium with big fences around him so here he is saying no walls
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:17.680]  we're going to play that insane video that is the most upside down statement i've ever heard
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:24.320]  but that's what democrats are doing it's just upside down world they're just trying to condition
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.320]  you to accept the horrible things they're doing we're going to kill babies after they're born
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:38.640]  we're going to say that walls quote don't save lives they in lives and are immoral
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.960]  your epidermis your skin is a beautiful wall around your body you die without it
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.640]  we have cell membranes that are walls barriers plants have actual walls
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.440]  it's amazing i'm going to go that moment but
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:10:01.120]  but first i want to just remind listeners and i want to really sink in and really hit bedrock that
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:06.960]  info wars that means you you're the folks that spread the word that did all this
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:16.000]  is known by hillary and the deep state to have been the final global catalyst or detonator
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:20.960]  and again you might have some giant artillery shell that's uh
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:27.840]  uh you know 10 inches across on the bottom and it's a two feet long and it's carrying this giant
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:35.200]  you know charge and they can shoot five miles but it's got a cap in it that might be
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:45.520]  120th of an ounce of powder you know it's the old saying i'm going to bust a cap in your butt
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:53.040]  and it could be a 30 odd 6 round or a 308 round or it could be a 223 round it could be whatever
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.920]  the round is there's a little bit of cap in the back less the amount of powder that's in a match
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:04.720]  and that's the highly explosive accelerant that detonates the chain reaction
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:11.600]  to then ignite the powder in the chambered round and send the projectile down the
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:18.640]  rifle ding and out towards its intended target and info wars is ground zero
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.200]  for at least half of the devastating victories against the globalist
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.400]  i would give the rest and it's not about credit but the enemy's giving us the credit that means
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:37.520]  it's a big crosshair on us took people like matt drudge and drudge report dot com and it's not
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:42.240]  bragging it's saying hey info wars is a national treasure for all its issues i'm not perfect
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.200]  and we're under massive unprecedented attack because we have everybody else on his bnd platform
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.040]  everybody else on the fundraise rush home all this have anybody on this show to fundraise
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.280]  and i get he works for corporation it's all about the benjamin's not me
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:06.160]  i support everybody else and most time they never even support me i don't care it's about a war
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:09.920]  and we keep coming to you and coming to you for support but when i asked you just a word of
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:15.840]  mouth tell your office about info wars about news wars tell your church send it out to your email
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.920]  list every day send our articles out text message them you don't want to get censored on social media
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:25.840]  whatever set up another account on social media you use to push info wars or use news wars that
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:35.360]  doesn't get censored we're in a war start a new site yourself get our content post it get it out
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:43.120]  that way this is a war we were effective hillary admits to congress she believes info wars be her
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:48.480]  we did then trump gets crowded around by a bunch of politicos a bunch of politicians
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:54.320]  who all just want money for fox news and money for their tv ads and they see info wars as a
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.960]  threat to their republican dominance i don't live in dc or new york or la i don't want to hang around
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:06.080]  with you mummies you all are pathetic scum most of you the leadership i'm just here in texas
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.920]  where my family's been since 1822 trying to just be a decent person and and fighting back against
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:17.200]  you guys so i'm not getting into your territory but because the republican leadership wants its
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.280]  territory and there are a bunch of lawyers and all play golf and hang out and or intermarry with
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:29.600]  the democrats this country is in deep crap and is being set up for a fault and we've been totally
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.560]  sold up the chai comms and others and it just has to stop so the listeners just commit today and i
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.400]  thank you for all you've already done but commit today they know info wars were spreading like
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:45.680]  wildfire biggest thing in the world at that point when it came to actual nationalism and
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:51.600]  free market capitalism and ringing the alarm bell the christianity is being targeted under attack
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.560]  so the globalist set about to to to shut us down to cut us off from our audience of activists
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.760]  to cut us off from the troops literal and figurative
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.200]  and to then build a straw man out of us that doesn't exist to then demonize liberty movements worldwide
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:15.600]  and that's why it's so critical that they've been demonizing us to psychologically inoculate
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.760]  people so when they hear about info or think oh that's evil so you take that you go oh you've
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:24.160]  heard how evil it is you've heard how bad it is right why do you think that is he didn't launch
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.720]  wars that killed millions of people he didn't do all these why do they say he's so bad all day
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:34.400]  why don't you go to info wars dot com or news wars dot com and click on the listen button

[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:20.720]  through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:25.200]  and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.960]  of pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to the establishment trying
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:36.800]  to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.840]  chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other

[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:46.800]  texas command center it's alex jones don't tell pito or orc uh that the world's dangerous place
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.720]  he says we shouldn't have any walls period we're gonna play that clip in a moment but
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:54.000]  you know i thought the president wasn't going to reach a deal because the current deal we've been
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  hearing about is not a good deal at all but just minutes ago he said well he's not happy with it
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:05.440]  but that it's the start so this is um really not a good move by the president he's capitulating
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:10.000]  on letting him censor us again i still like the president still thinks i'm a lot of great things but
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.600]  his trajectory is going from dead on to couple degrees off more and more degrees off and over
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:21.680]  time that means instead of going straight up he'll turn and crater and crash and once you go too many
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:26.640]  degrees you can't change that trajectory his approval ratings weigh up but again those are
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:31.680]  gamed approval ratings so as soon as he starts acting like he does what the media wants they
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:35.520]  boost the approval rating and then later they take it away again so let's go and go to the president
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:42.800]  just minutes ago here he is from the widows sir will you sign congress's border deal i have to
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:49.120]  study it i'm not happy about it it's not doing the trick but i'm adding things to it and when you add
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:56.640]  whatever i have to add uh it's all it's all gonna happen where we're gonna build a beautiful big
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:03.360]  strong wall that's not going to let criminals and traffickers and drug dealers and drugs into our
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:09.360]  country it's very simple it's very simple we're building a wall and now i'm saying we're finishing
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:16.160]  a wall we just started a big big section on the Rio Grande you probably saw it some of you were
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.600]  there when they started you went there you didn't believe it you went there you see trucks all over
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.160]  the place you said hey he's not kidding i don't care i never cared about construction i love
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:29.440]  construction and i know how to do it for the right price and we're getting a beautiful
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:38.000]  look in structure that's also less expensive to build and works much better that's a good
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.480]  combination of events you get what's happening with this point in fact i happen to think that the
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:48.000]  wall trump is distracting us with the wall while they're gonna let a bunch of docket people
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.440]  be legalized which will then just cause a bigger flood of illegals up here and the democrats don't
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:23:00.080]  even want us to have any beds for criminals so they can be kept i mean it's just total insane
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:06.240]  asylum lawlessness and trump is buckling on the border issue and they'll boost his approval
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:10.560]  rating which is totally fake his approval rating was already high with this with his core base
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:16.880]  and with others and super popular in europe i mean he's popular all over but he's gonna live and die
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:22.480]  by those stupid polls that are as fake as a three dollar bill speaking as fake as a three dollar bill
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:30.720]  here is pito or roark the darling of the establishment says walls don't save lives they
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:38.480]  end lives while he's guarded by police with huge 20-plus foot chain link barriers and walls
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:44.080]  behind him so let's let's go to pito there's a little pathetic rally you notice they were always
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:49.200]  zoomed in at the rallies on him because we have our own footage we'll show you maybe 500 people
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:55.200]  maybe if this is shocking uh how fake this guy is here it is the walls do not make us safer
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:08.480]  we know that walls do not save lives walls end lives we stand for america and we stand against
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:17.920]  walls immigrants commit crimes including violent crimes at a lower rate than do americans who were
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:27.440]  born in this country el paso has been the safest city in the united states of america not in spite
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:35.600]  of the fact that we're a city of immigrants but because we are a city of immigrants i love how
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:41.360]  all these literal carpet backers running for obvious in texas do not have texas accents
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:49.360]  and he certainly doesn't have a el paso accent because the white folks down in el paso you know
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:56.560]  speak kind of a little bit of spanish accent again he's a billionaire his uh his father-in-law is
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:01.840]  worth 27 million he's just a total i'm not saying it's bad to have money just he says i got my he
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:06.000]  has this fake thing they go the same school it's like you're supposed to talk like this it's really
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.240]  confident where white people don't know what it's like to be poor he's got a connecticut or new york
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:18.480]  accent he's trying to this is how a texan talks and i'm not against people from new york but imagine
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.600]  if i don't have to new york and i was like and with my texas accent going i'm from new york city
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:29.760]  and yeah you doing there partner like a pace pacante commercial or something it's fake
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.440]  i vote for somebody from new york city they were down here in texas for 20 years owned a
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:41.440]  business cared about the state we're pro second amendment hell make the whole legislature yankee
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.520]  most of texas won't act like anymore down here but i mean that big old butt toothed lion snake
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:53.440]  makes me sick here's trump on the wall that uh he's giving us a little piece of so they can
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:58.320]  have doca and sell us down the river here it is it has nothing to do with anything other than safety
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:04.640]  for the american safety for our people safety for our country and a wall is a very good thing
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:10.000]  not a bad thing it's a moral thing to put it in the opposite terms and uh we have tremendous
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.760]  support we're building it right now we don't even say build the wall anymore we say finish the wall
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:19.600]  because we've built a lot and we're renovating a tremendous amount of all stuff that was really
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:23.920]  in bad shape but it had good structure uh so we're saying finish the wall no walls are very
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.320]  important if you don't have it all of the technology laura all of the drones that they're
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:35.040]  flying around so nicely up in the air they don't mean a thing okay so let's go ahead now and go to
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:40.480]  trump's really truthful statement here that the so-called fact checker snopes and politifact
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:47.200]  they're the worst but you call yourself a fact checker sanctimonious arrogant how about i call
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:54.160]  myself the high priest of truth and i sit up here on my throne and i tell you what's true or not
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:58.240]  like is that flag behind me red white and blue well let me ask a fact checker
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:05.520]  no you don't need the fact checker you look at it for yourself you decide what's real news and
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:13.360]  what's fake news but oh cnn's the main fact checker that's like saying a you know a nymphomaniac
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:19.520]  prostitute is going to uh go out and eradicate prostitution for us or i mean it's it's upside
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:26.400]  down world none of it's true and here's trump on the so-called fact checkers here it is to pave the
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:33.680]  way for socialism democrats are calling for massive tax hikes and the complete elimination

[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:09.680]  what's next are schools going to suspend students for wearing shirts with the american flag on them
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:16.480]  oh wait what's this california students said home for wearing us flags on cico de male the students
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.600]  did the right thing and sued the school for violating their first amendment rights but the
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:28.160]  ninth circuit court ruled in favor of the school here cnn celebrating the decision the school was
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:34.800]  within their right to ban the us flag t-shirts on cico de male a mexican holiday if you didn't
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:39.520]  know here in america so many people found it hard to believe that a school in america would
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:45.200]  ban students from wearing shirts with the american flag on them that even snopes did an article about
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:51.600]  it and they're like is it true yes it's true back in 2016 i interviewed a bunch of random people
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:56.960]  on the beach boardwalk in a college town here in san diego telling them that congress was
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:02.320]  getting ready to issue a new american flag because so many people found it offensive
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:07.520]  just to see what they would have to say the old stars and stripes a little bit a little too
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:13.200]  offensive you think yeah give it a good change just like other countries okay after maybe after
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:18.560]  the rebel revolution and the new american flag you think after the after the revolution yeah we
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.880]  might have a better start i think i think that's good like as far as like the african american
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:26.960]  community i think that's right for us you think that's maybe a good idea to be um i'm always excited
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:32.080]  for change i'm always excited for growth if it's something that everybody could agree on then
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:36.320]  that'd be fantastic so you would you think it's about time to for the new flag you're excited
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:41.440]  about it um yeah i mean the flag changed before you know what i mean like there's been old flags
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:46.400]  everything like that so eventually yeah i think it'd be a great idea for a change excited about
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:52.560]  the new designs for the new the new flag haven't seen them a lot of people are just saying that just
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.040]  any new design would be better just because the stars and stripes still kind of just represent
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:02.880]  america's kind of racist foundation and past so i think it's time that they they issue a new
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:09.120]  design for the flag um yeah i think it should be the colors of the rainbow that's actually one of
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:14.320]  the one of the designs is the rainbow uh some some sort of to just celebrate the first city
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:21.040]  yeah i agree absolutely as you can see even two and a half years ago when this was recorded
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:26.240]  many millennials were uncomfortable with the american flag and wanted a new one for the
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.640]  new world order and this was before the social justice warrior madness caused by the liberal
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:36.160]  pathogen began to really boil over like it has in the last few years and today we have cnn
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:41.360]  contributors like angela rye who's literally paid by the network to spew her nonsense on air
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:45.840]  who wants all american symbols just torn down to me i don't care if it's a george
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:50.960]  washington statue or at thomas jefferson statue or a robert e lee statue they all need to come
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:55.600]  down there is a way that we can recognize and appreciate i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not you're
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:00.720]  not an american and you need to get out of our country santa barbara community college recently
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.800]  banned the pledge of allegiance for being given at their meetings after the president of the board
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:12.080]  of trustees said that he didn't like its history and symbolism and especially the phrase one nation
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:17.280]  under god so this patriotic woman decided to show up at the meeting with her own flag and
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:22.000]  give the pledge of allegiance anyway and just listen to them trying to shout her down i would
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:29.520]  ask anyone who would like to stand with me i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:39.840]  states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:54.000]  with liberty and justice nothing triggers them more than saying america's coming back
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.920]  it's literally an anti-american cult oh being a patriot's ridiculous now huh at this rate it
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:07.200]  won't be long now until the democrat nominee for 2020 adopts no border no wall no usa at all
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:20.320]  as their campaign slogan make no mistake about it today's democrat party and the liberal media
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.280]  are literally trying to overthrow our republic and if they succeed they're not just going to
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:41.200]  replace the american flag they're going to replace the american way of life
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:48.080]  waging war on corruption crashing the lies and disinformation it's gab mcginnis and ali

[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:14.240]  by leaps and by bounds the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:20.320]  and energy supplements but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:25.120]  chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:31.680]  side effects we have developed hands down from our research the most powerful healthy energy drink
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:37.920]  pre-workout and beyond system in the world there's nothing else like it you must experience it it is
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:43.680]  a total game changer and it comes in easy to use packets to mix in the fruit juice or water whatever
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:48.800]  you'd like warning though it's very very strong it lasts 10 hours so take a half packet the first
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:54.320]  time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:44:01.120]  turbo force and enforce live com i've been doing a lot of research into google and youtube
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:07.920]  censorship and i've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:15.760]  buried the most suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:21.520]  all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others it's so butt hurt when
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:27.360]  trump won they don't want us to have that victory they don't want us to remember what political
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:33.840]  action did and that's why the globalist hillary and others are trying to shut in force down this
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:40.080]  is a fight about taking your speech away not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty away

[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:16.800]  they i'm not gonna get into that we're gonna do it next hour there's so much to cover oh yeah this
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:22.960]  video uh explosive here uh gav mcginnis takes on the southern poverty law center in their own
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:28.400]  backyard and you can narrate if you want here it is i'm here joined with gavin mcginnis who today
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:32.000]  looks like he told me he was going to come down with a white suit and i did not believe him
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:38.320]  lost dog alabama will be available for questions but what's really important for us in this case
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:44.880]  against the splc is that gavin not shut up gavin is a satirist he's a political commentator the
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:49.920]  splc has put him on a hate list to terrorize his family and then to chill the speech of americans
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:56.080]  like us so we want gavin to tell you what he thinks is going on and then we'll be available for a q
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:03.520]  and a and uh we want people to support his lawsuit at defend gavin dot com defend gavin dot com gavin
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:09.280]  mcginnis that's it i've never been here before i've never seen the splc's headquarters but it looks
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:17.200]  like jar fader's son's apartment it looks like an evil empire so yeah i i think the splc started
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:23.680]  out with noble intentions we all want bigotry and hatred to be monitored to be stemmed sounds good to
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:33.360]  me i'm in great and then what i presume happened is the check started pouring in and they went wow
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:39.200]  this white hate thing is profitable i think more steve said originally let's just cap it at 50 million
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:46.560]  and then it went to 100 million and now i believe it's at 430 million and that doesn't include the
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:51.200]  money in the caiman islands which is probably comparable so we've got hundreds and hundreds of
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:57.040]  millions into fighting hate now when that is your business plan you need to expand the net
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:06.000]  of hatred it can't just be the kkk it has to be homophobia it has to be islamophobia transphobia
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:13.360]  it has to be christian conservatives i i don't know why it doesn't include uh jihadists for some
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:20.400]  reason extremist islam gets a pass but outside of that if we really hone in on christian conservatives
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:26.240]  we could probably expand this hate map i kind of like the white boys like america is a racist
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:31.760]  it's a fountain oh that's what it is oh yeah and you look at their hate map on their site and there's
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:36.000]  there seems to be more hate groups than there are post offices they're everywhere
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:47.280]  and it depicts this picture of america which is basically the worst of the 1930s coast to coast
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:53.680]  they cast this wide net of everyone's a nazi and they start destroying lives you know i love the
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:59.040]  boss fog outfit thank you very much i kind of missed shot i'm a canadian and i was in in alabama
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:03.360]  and people go why are you dressed like a texan i thought it's the south and they go no no no
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:08.080]  in alabama we'd wear like under armor camo you look like you're from dalis and i went damn it
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:14.240]  i should have an atv a camo well that's in modern times now what you're wearing from the 50s 60s i mean
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:20.160]  back to the 30 that that's an alabama outfit oh good so i did nail it nice nice yeah it's i love
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:26.880]  the south if it wasn't an oven for seven months a year i would move here in a heart boot well
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:33.440]  awesomeness is bad but houston is an oven houston humidity 90 percent humidity yeah you'll be totally
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:37.680]  clean take a shower try to take your wife out a girlfriend out to dinner and it's not at night man
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:43.120]  you open the front door you're just it's unbelievable you know one thing i wanted to say
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:47.280]  about that quick speeches you ever hear this bill hicks bit where he says uh i don't know if you
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:52.800]  ever watched uh cnn for 24 hours but you just hear war famine disease death war famine disease death
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:56.800]  and then you walk outside and the birds are chirping and everyone's saying morning it's an
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:01.840]  ultimate reality yeah and and this is the same with the splc oh hate's on the rise anti-semitism on
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:05.920]  the rise hate crimes are on the rise and then you walk out and there's some old black guy talking
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:10.640]  to an old white lady going hi there uh miss andra how's now what's going on with your mother oh she's
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:15.680]  still not well and you realize wait the splc's lying about this country totally and they say
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:21.040]  oh there's more there's more racist white power terrorism than there is jihadists and you go
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:25.200]  let me just sit in an armchair and think about this this is our 99 percent of it's islamic terror
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:29.920]  yeah like what with dylan roof that mentally ill kid that was an example of rampant white
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:34.800]  nationalism and then and then did you know that mcvay lived at the elaheem city compound that
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:38.960]  came out in federal documents run by the southern property law center they were leading the white
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:42.800]  supremacist group but what u.s intelligence when it's a breakaway criminal group will do
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:48.880]  is they will use an outside government british or german usually so they had a different foreign
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:53.200]  intelligence agencies this all came out federal court i've had the lawyers on the families all of
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:57.680]  it even came out local newspapers so they were winding up white supremacist to carry out an attack
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:01.360]  and they thought they were going to do a sting and then mcvay didn't want to go ahead with the sting
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:04.800]  they even came out in federal court so the southern law parvy law center one reason they
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:08.880]  want me off the air is i expose the fact the southern parvy law center was heavily involved
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:14.720]  in the whole operation of oklahoma city you know what it is it's entrapment it's sort of like
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:18.800]  leaving a bunch of lamborghini's in harlem with the keys in them and then you catch all these
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:24.240]  thieves and you go there's a huge car thief problem and we caught them all no you created the problem
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:29.040]  this happened in canada with the heritage front they said we're going to make an area where we can
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:34.480]  draw in all the nazi skinheads and they'd have conventions and newsletters and they ended up
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:39.680]  creating nazi skinheads oh oh where there were none some of my films police state films i show
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:44.960]  like one in guardian even ap back then would tell the truth and it was like 94 percent of german hate
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:51.920]  crimes committed by german secret police posing as nazis to get funding and then i start questioning
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.520]  other things like oh no you know don't question other events we don't know what's real we don't
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:59.760]  know what is it because this history a false fly well this is this is their entire system right the
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:05.680]  splc has its tentacles inside a silicon valley inside of academia inside of government they've
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:11.280]  launched this new program called change the terms in which they say we'll handle your research we'll
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:16.160]  tell you who the bigots are you just go ban them and kick them off the internet and that's why gavin
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:20.720]  suit is so important you know when when his team called me and said ollie you know we need somebody
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:25.440]  where you know gavin can concentrate on his work and his speech but we need somebody rallying the
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:29.840]  movement i said yeah i'm in let's go to mcgummery and let's take it to them because it's absolutely
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:35.360]  important that gavin be the first of many victims that stand up against the splc so that we can take
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:39.840]  them out of silicon valley away from twitter away from facebook away from the government
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:44.960]  and you know it's it's they commit violence they can well they incite violence right where there
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:49.040]  was none i mean the steve's glee shooting was inspired by the splc family research council
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:53.520]  getting shot at thanks to the splc you got charles murray getting attacked professor hospitalized
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:58.400]  thanks to the splc they're a hate group they're generating hate they're generating death they're
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:03.600]  generating well if you read the wiki leaks it says we're losing the we need to create culture war
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:07.600]  and so that's what hillary's talking about with professors is divide everybody
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:11.920]  because that's the only hope this ruling corrupt class has all these big silicon valley ads
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:17.360]  pay almost no taxes they pay no local taxes they screw their employees over like snap kitchen
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:22.880]  just takes their tips pays them nothing basically and it's exactly this leftism is camouflage
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:29.280]  for serious 2.0 robber barron insanity look this country was built on free speech this country was
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:34.880]  built on liberty and they are taking that away and they're turning it into worse than a totalitarianism
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:40.080]  state because with with totalitarianism you get punished you get sent away then you come back
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:46.480]  in your record screen here when you get this scarlet letter alan rick jones banned for life on twitter
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:51.440]  yep it's banned for life no no redemption no redemption at all you can't redeem yourself
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:56.000]  you can't negotiate with him apologize you can go to an apology tour in the country no you're that
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.600]  evil not only if you're the democrat governor right he's going to be our moral compass now
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:04.640]  yeah yeah robert bird he can be in the clan hillary's kissing him on the lips that's fine
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:09.680]  she said his funeral crying yeah he was a good grand dragon what was it wizard
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:16.000]  harry potter wizard sir can say that that that uh israel shouldn't exist alana omar can talk
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:22.240]  alana omar can talk about how israel should be abolished but if anyone knew a nazi or or like
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:27.120]  the same sandwich david duke does you're dead if you're on the right when we come back i want to
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:32.080]  get into their next plan for the total takeover what this censorship was about but most importantly
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:37.440]  why is it trump doing it because here's the deal i'm getting ready to take the gloves off on front
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:40.480]  and it's not because they're attacking the advantage of curry tower to the left no no no
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:44.960]  this will piss silicon valley off but i'm getting ready to take the gloves off with djt we'll be right

[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:27.200]  fashion lady give up your vows save our city
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:37.120]  oh
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:46.080]  good time real good time all right let's repeat that two minute break all the cool stuff you
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:50.320]  were just saying okay that's pretty pretty powerful there's a lot of anti-wall propaganda going
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:55.280]  around and the big one is walls don't work i've been to israel i did a tour with the guy who helped
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:00.800]  build the wall down there and it is a work of art can we pull up the israeli wall please
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:04.720]  five percent of it is about nine meters tall it's like more doors are the same the rest is
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:10.480]  just a smart fence where no no ice officer there are cool no ice officer is more than a minute away
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:14.880]  from getting over there and they used to have a real obviously a serious terrorism problem with
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:21.520]  people that would sneak over and that that wall has brought their terrorism attacks down to zero
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:27.680]  there have been zero attacks since that wall and the eye and you have all these liberals
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:33.680]  even liberal jews saying oh no the wall is a stupid idea really would you rather live in
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:40.000]  televieve pre-wall or post-wall and another lie that they say look at that work of art
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.800]  another lie they say about the wall is it's so stupid to build a wall all of your legals in
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:50.560]  america they come from planes that's it's people skipping out on their visas and i just i want
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:56.560]  to write this in the clouds over the entire country those are the documented illegals those
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:02.400]  are the cases we know of and that number doesn't hold a candle to the illegals that are running
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:06.560]  over the border the reason we don't have that number is because they're illegals doing it
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:11.120]  illegally a lot this you said guess how many there are in the country and they said yeah that my new
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:14.480]  trick with leftist is because they haven't done their homework and i hate that because it shows
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:17.680]  they don't genuinely care about what they're talking about so you give them a few basic quiz
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:22.560]  questions it's all a virtue signal exactly and one i like is how many legals do you think are there
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:28.720]  in the country now the left number is 13 14 million 30 40 and culture is more upwards of 30 40 the
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:34.080]  the smart people go 30 40 but i'm happy to argue with anyone who says between 13 and 30 there's probably
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:40.000]  40 million texas or something sorry and i said i said give me a number and she said i look i'm not
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:45.120]  a numbers person which which the whole subject of immigration is based solely on numbers well
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:51.440]  10 000 illegals i would never mention you said she said a billion she said 80 billion hey sweetheart
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:55.200]  there's seven and a half billion people on the planet i had my dad's a mathematician and i had i
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:00.560]  said dad if we froze all the lakes and we were sitting like chest to back how many could we fit
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:05.440]  in the country he worked on it for days and he's like i've done some research and we have to freeze
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:10.400]  the lake so obviously but i think it could be but you couldn't turn you'd have to be like and then
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:17.440]  he started going wait a minute wow about a high rise like tokyo he's fat bastard and the old brew
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:21.440]  and then he's like wait but too many buildings you'd have to worry about sewage and we need
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:26.640]  farmland but maybe we could import that he was working on it for about a week space elevators
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:32.160]  so the truth is 80 billion ain't sitting captain i don't know if we got the power that's my dad
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:36.480]  he's scotty isn't this supposed to be the party we should figure that on the show sorry isn't this
[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:39.360]  the party that worship science and math though you know shouldn't take care about they don't
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:44.800]  wish we're so they have signs all over us that say science matters yeah they want to get women into
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:49.120]  stem hate they want to get one in the math so we can continue to worry about this 80 billion number
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:55.600]  in america it's ridiculous and it's a serious problem i think the one of the reasons the left
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:00.960]  attacked math is so they can say platitudes like we're a nation of immigrants and we can't come
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:07.120]  back with questions like okay i agree with you to what number like ask them how much per student
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:12.320]  should we pay an education no numbers to let me ask that question like cortez says oh don't worry
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:18.880]  about budgets just free health care is the entire budget great so then there's a free education and
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:22.800]  of course once you make it free it balloons the price right of course right they can't give you
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:29.440]  numbers how much should we pay per student 50 grand 100 grand more okay let's literally take it away
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:33.600]  from because where's this money because you know the IRS is taking old people's houses for this
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:39.520]  and they don't they think that they can ignore numbers and numbers like gender are fluid and
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:44.400]  you can just go with whatever number that's right randy roads is taking us out ladies and

[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:47.200]  deplatformed out there he's suing the splc over their incredible demonization calling him a nazi
[02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:51.680]  white supremacist all this made-up crap and then of course when they're heavily funded by george
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:57.280]  soros the literal nazi collaborator alie alexander political analyst pundit uh you name it defend
[02:06:57.280 --> 02:07:03.920]  gabin dot com uh is the site that gabin has up right now and of course you can follow on twitter
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:08.960]  uh ali alexander at ali ali okay i got a lot of stuff i want to cover all the clips i want to
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:14.720]  get to and any other issues you men want to get into but i want to just get to this right now
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:22.960]  i've been persecuted for supporting trump and so i have a dogged thing that i have where i'm very
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:27.600]  loyal yeah especially when i get persecuted i get more loyal it's like a dog in a fight gets even
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:34.800]  meaner but at the same time hey it's great we beat hillary but if trump won't do something
[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:40.640]  about the organized mass focus censorship and really racketeering as the whole class of people
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:45.680]  christians conservatives gun owners veterans free speech advocates leftists that are anti-war
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:50.880]  they're being censored if he won't do something about that and then he goes well i don't like this
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:56.320]  deal but we'll probably go with it for a billion three and but we'll do all this DACA stuff uh
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:02.160]  he's going back on promises now he's way beyond compromising when he has the power to declare an
[02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:07.600]  emergency and though the whole wall in like a year uh with just a tiny bit of the defense spending
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:13.760]  and his own advisors have told him that so i've reached the point here gentlemen of where uh i'm
[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:17.760]  not you know doing like in culture does where every day a stunt attacking trump is to get in the
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:21.520]  news and have the leftist you know picker up and not shadow banner and i'm not against handcultures
[02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:27.120]  coming on soon it it's just that i've come more her way or say tucker carlsson's way where i know
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:34.720]  the inside baseball yeah and trump does literally has some good ideas and you know has uh miller
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:40.160]  and a few good people in there but by and large now trump really thinks he won the election
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:46.160]  not the internet not the patriots not the discontent and he's in la la land uh when it comes to a lot
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:50.400]  of stuff and i'm i'm i'm getting ready you know i'm not bragging or anything but just like joe
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:54.720]  rogan i think i'm diminished and you know that i unleash on joe and you know the phone starts ringing
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:09:00.160]  but that's the power of the audience and so trump i don't take pleasure on swinging our
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:05.440]  political guns around on him but at a certain point i i love what he's doing i hate when he gets
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:09.200]  attacked you know the enemy wants to bring him down because they know he's a nationalist and he's
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:13.120]  for real and his big crime is he's being the president and they don't like someone actually
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:19.040]  being the president the whole swamp likes to have big meetings and parlay it and sell the country off
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:24.640]  so i think he's a great man but if he won't protect us from savage censorship if he won't
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:30.240]  protect us and do anything about it if he won't you know do that then i don't know what i'm supposed
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:34.560]  to do because he's his own worst enemy alex you're being a patriot you know we live in a republic
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:39.920]  where we're supposed to be responsive to our public servants donald trump ran on a series of promises
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:45.680]  and that's how he earned our support and so and he and he said during the 2016 election i'll never
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:50.880]  forget it in north carolina he gave a beautiful speech after you know kelly and conway got uh
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:54.880]  you know some of the collaborating on the on the writing and and you know he talked about you know
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:10:00.880]  black americans have been sold out by both parties i want y'all to hold me accountable yada yada yada
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:05.680]  yada so we ought to hold him accountable and you know i've i've been on white house working groups
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:10.240]  with you know executive orders drafted for the president on the silicon valley issue
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:16.160]  and the president's instincts are to act it's the corporatist inside of the oval office who have
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:20.480]  oval office access who can walk in you know whenever they want who have convinced him what the free
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:25.520]  market work or and i agree and we've got to get really pissed and camp around the white house to
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:30.640]  override those pieces of crap right we are the market the people the consumers are a market force
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:37.360]  our petitions our voices our protest uh you know gimmick stunts whatever it takes we can't forget
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:42.720]  that the first amendment was codified into law to protect a principle right so we can exchange
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:48.960]  these ideas together to keep us civil so we won't go into some warlord factionist you know you know
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:53.520]  african country type of man and that's exactly where we're headed is is tribalism europe was
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:58.720]  under for thousands of years africanism until we got christianity that unified us right well he
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:02.480]  he keeps talking about social media and how it's unfair the way christians and conservatives are
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:06.960]  being treated okay do something about it i'm not saying that i want the president to give my twitter
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:12.000]  account back but this this giant do more than tweet and here's the deal let's go after trump
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  folks in a loving way he's he's got to cover his flank and i'm gonna go over just the articles
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:22.240]  last few weeks iron sharp of big tech censorship and then them lying to congress roger stone is
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.360]  charged to lying for congress i looked at what he said he didn't do it these people are doing it
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:33.360]  but naked sorry it was a typo and we have much more serious things going on than than this platitudes
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:38.480]  about how everyone's against me and rico uh tario is the chairman of the proud boys he was
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:44.080]  selling the shirt that says roger stone did nothing wrong he gets bombarded his his bank chase takes
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:49.200]  him off chase takes him off his personal kind instead of her 15 years jennifer morris who runs
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:52.800]  the ruth institute they decide that she's a homophobe because she prefers male female adoption
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:57.680]  over gay adoption her bank cuts her off by the way let's go further let's go further they're
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:03.360]  constantly saying everyone's nazis the first thing the nazis wisely did in their evil brains
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:08.960]  was from 33 to about 37 take everybody's bank accounts and write the commerce until they were
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:13.600]  all bankrupted for four or five years in ghettos then he started picking them off one by one taking
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:18.320]  their leaders away so when they came for everybody nobody would stand up that model is being played
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:23.600]  out again absolutely i guarantee you jeffrey sandusky has a bank account i guarantee you jeffrey
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:28.160]  daumer maintained a bank account i'm guarantee exactly people people being charged with capital
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:32.880]  murder get to keep their bank account fine but don't support trump they encourage the parkland
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:37.280]  shooter to make sure that he voted in the midterms i mean it is the criminal well your dad's a lawyer
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:41.680]  what is this well i'm not my mom's a lawyer well but but expanding on this isn't it racketeering
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:45.200]  isn't it persecution of a class i mean what do you call it when they're telling conservatives
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:48.960]  this is a chinese social score we're going to take your bank accounts away we're going to take
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:53.360]  i mean this is insane yeah i think that this is uh the invasion of privacy i think this is
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:58.400]  targeted harassment i also think that uh there can these silicon valley companies are committing
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:03.120]  antitrust behavior you know we are competitors to some of these well it's cartels they're

[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:21.520]  music i've always liked guest hosting for that reason it pumps you know white people i was gonna
[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:26.400]  say thank you man thank you very much thank you white people hey alie alexander let me ask you
[02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:34.080]  this question yeah you've seen the big national polls democrats now are 52 to 57 depending on the
[02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:40.240]  national poll they go we just want war and they're like and the pollsters are like well okay we don't
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:45.120]  like trump we want war so now don't let black people out of prison who big give it unfair sentences
[02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:49.440]  three times the cocaine sentence of the white thank you trump yeah you just don't do that and
[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:54.640]  they're like that's not good and we love war and bill mars says make the economy tank i want the
[02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:58.720]  economy to be doing badly so he looks bad so that's when we go back to the original question
[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:05.120]  we'll get into this big news what alie gavin what is the bottom here i mean like the governor's
[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:09.200]  celebrating like they just won the the power ball we could kill babies after they're born
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:13.200]  who and then a woman stabbed the death the guy wants to kill the baby and they go well it's not
[02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:17.280]  murder it's just not a human it's really sticking it with what's amazing is you know when we were on
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:21.840]  david night show gavin was observing that you know these people are becoming feral they're they're
[02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:26.960]  kind of authoritarian but what's really interesting in this information age is so the information is
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:32.960]  spreading faster so ideas are more viral which is actually leading to consensus which is why
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:37.120]  progressives who are increasingly you know they don't have an absolute right so they're pushing
[02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:41.680]  their values so everyone's running together but they're not actually expanding their majority
[02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:47.280]  so they are going to cannibalize each other but our response is the next question for this age is
[02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:52.080]  what's the response from the right and the three of us are like whoa whoa whoa you better stop before
[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:58.160]  you know the response looks something like you know brazil or or or you know that's what they want
[02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:03.280]  remember thatcher right that's what they want i don't want all that right we don't we want peace
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:07.280]  that's what peace thatcher was on the on the house commons whatever you call it and they
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:12.000]  were complaining that the the gap throughout thatcher's regime between rich and poor was
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:16.640]  bigger than it was before her and she goes yes but the poor are doing better off right and then
[02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:21.440]  she said you would rather both people be doing worse off if the gap was smaller right and the
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:25.680]  poor were doing worse than the poor doing better but the gap being bigger and i honestly believe a lot
[02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:31.200]  of these leftists would rather we were in the great depression and we didn't have trump and hillary
[02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:38.720]  came back then said that well portez said if you can't work or don't want to work and then she took
[02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:43.280]  it down and said she didn't do it but it's it's on the archive they do this all the time now you
[02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:47.520]  know these they've always been revisionist but now they're doing it in real time and then the
[02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:53.360]  media was echoing them so the media two days ago is saying mark dyson jack basopex spread this meme
[02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:59.360]  and it's it's misinformation when her own newt greed deal document said crazy stuff that she
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:03.360]  doesn't have to take credit for anymore i mean we're living in the the age of disinformation if i
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:08.720]  could ban the yankees and the astros and make every other team have to play with one hand
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:12.560]  tied behind their back it's possible that the mets would win well by the way people ask why why i
[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:18.320]  was banned everywhere we happened to launch an app in july early july and i was banned on on august
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:24.720]  seventh and it was all it was already like the number 10 app in news and then they banned me it
[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:28.480]  went to number one so they just removed it where you couldn't see it i remember that yeah people
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:33.120]  could still find it so they just removed it total and he's like well we're curating okay your users
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:38.400]  say something's number one against eight year old apps i mean we had three million downloads
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:44.160]  and and and we looked at it with our our statisticians we got one here and and rob dues brothers a
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:48.400]  multi-degree statistician we looked at it we're like my god within six months will be the number
[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:53.360]  one app on apple they're not going to allow that to be number one so it's like you're a race car
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:58.080]  driver that keeps winning all the races they go dude you're not getting in the car and we're going
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:03.920]  to take your sponsors to just go like let's get blacks out of the nba i want my team to win i'm
[02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:08.800]  going to rig it like truth is not on their side well exactly info wars i'm not bragging and just
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:14.000]  like you were number one on crtv which made people match they removed you being number one is without
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:18.720]  the big establishment people nighting you because they are like slave owners to use the nfl analogy
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:24.080]  they're literally sitting there saying okay alex jones is the lebron james of the internet he's
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:28.000]  number one everywhere even with the suppression just take him out of the game get him out of there
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:34.320]  now i can win now i've got well same thing happened to you you were you were a nvp you know uh you
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:39.440]  know uh nfl a super team guy what do they call that where it's the big uh you know pro bowl where
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:44.000]  all the top guys have the big game i don't follow football anymore but what's that super bowl no not
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.640]  the super bowl they have the pro bowl oh yeah yeah so so they took you because you were number one
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:54.640]  on crtv so that's like you're off here done sure you can have a sharia app you can't have the info
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:26:00.880]  wars app i want all the apps like malice said let a thousand flowers bloom but they don't they would
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:06.240]  just want their particular flower but i'm not bragging about that it's like you're number one
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:11.840]  and then they take you off it's a metric of public support that's what it is and they want to manipulate
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:16.480]  the public they don't hate alex jones they hate that the public supports alex exactly and they
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:19.920]  hate the public realizing that that they've got people that agree with them right they don't want
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:24.160]  a sense of community in fact they say that in wikileaks we can't let nationalist and capitalist and
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:29.440]  independent free marketers have a sense of community which is the whole basis of this country by the way
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:36.000]  it predates this country right the pilgrims came here to get a sense of of community the puritans
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:41.440]  did it the the the founders uh you know their parents did it i mean literally the whole basis
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:47.040]  of this land mass uh is is is that people from first so ali where does it end and gabin i mean how
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:53.040]  you keep saying i mean where does it go is it civil war is it is it is it a ferguson riot from
[02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:58.640]  coast to coast is it murder uh is it assassination is it burning people's hell they're gonna say
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:03.040]  you're caught for that i don't know you're saying where i don't want that i don't want we've already
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:09.200]  seen this in california the racial tension is so bad that you have mexican gangs ms-13 throwing
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:14.480]  molotov cocktails into black people's homes we already have a brown and black race war
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:19.360]  so that's so astute because all the numbers state and federal show the real wars between
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:25.120]  hispanics and blacks what why is that uh it's economics it's economics and notice it doesn't
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:30.160]  get reported on though right if you shove everyone in a ghetto you know you want some people want to
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:35.520]  be king of the ghetto like ben Shapiro you know he wants his write-ups at at uh at the new york
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:40.800]  times etc etc and then there's other people like okay well i need to compete for land mass in the
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:44.800]  ghetto and so that's what happens is you have all these rich people i think this is actually the
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:49.840]  plan for california the plan in california is to make elites and slaves and then carve out the
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:55.280]  middle class shove them into montana nevada arizona making them blue states and then they've taken
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:00.400]  over the nation by building you know district one moving it from dc to california i think that's
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:04.240]  what you're right they're moving into district one yeah and then they see texas as their other
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:09.520]  command base oh yeah they got if they take texas or florida off the map they've won i can't tell you
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:14.240]  how many conservatives i talk to who say i'm sick of being around these people it's just not fun
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:18.480]  it's it my kids aren't getting educated i want to move to montana everyone i know
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:24.560]  and i uh we're gonna come back i'll talk about this but i want to get into censorship i know a
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:29.200]  lot of wealthy people harbour but employ a lot of people and they're all moving to montana and
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:34.800]  they're trying to get me to move montana they're like the private jet is waiting for you we want

[02:33:55.520 --> 02:34:00.240]  get that self-important feeling that's what you say has great import and you know strangely enough
[02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:04.240]  you could use that show as a form you could sway people and I don't think you should as an entertainer
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:19.920]  that walls do not make us safer we know that walls do not save lives
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:28.640]  walls end lives we stand for america and we stand against walls
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:37.360]  immigrants commit crimes including violent crimes at a lower rate than do americans who
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:46.160]  were born in this country el paso has been the safest city in the united states of america
[02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:52.160]  not in spite of the fact that we're a city of immigrants but because we are a city of immigrants
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:35:02.880]  the globalists want to sabotage this country there's photos of bido behind a 20-plus foot
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:10.880]  fence being guarded by a wall saying walls shouldn't exist gab mcginnis just suit just the splc
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:15.280]  ali alexander here working with him great journalist and patriot i got a lot of angles
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:18.880]  i want to cover paul watch is coming up next hour i'm gonna host a little bit with him but we'll see
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:24.400]  but but but the time we have together with you guys other issues other points you want to get
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:28.480]  into because i've kind of been guiding the discussion here uh but i think what's coming
[02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:37.040]  out as a consensus is the left isn't even liberal anymore they're just insane pro war crazy people
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:42.000]  funded by big corporations and multinationals that want control of this country and they're
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:47.040]  really just a bunch of followers well the problem with all this censorship is we go off
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:51.120]  at a tangent and i don't think the country's ever been more divided maybe during vietnam
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:56.640]  we were this divided but they come up with say that that stupid myth about how all of our
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:36:01.280]  illegals come from planes no those are the only ones we have on file much more illegals come
[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:05.520]  over the border we just don't have them on file now when times the number when ten times the
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:09.120]  number when that rumor propagates on social media we used to be able to go in there and go
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:14.320]  that's a common misconception and sort of correct the ship now the ship is cut us off and they're
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:19.440]  just going off and the next thing you know we are these horrible nazis that don't know the whole
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:24.400]  thing about planes or the way they say Statue of Liberty they used to hold you three to six
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:28.640]  months in quarantine to make sure you didn't have a disease or treat you they're not even the democrats
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:33.520]  wanted to have no beds and check no one oh the plague's coming back you know we have our own
[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:38.240]  people in san francisco and and and los angeles with the fecal matter the hair and needles all
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:42.160]  that stuff and then we have you know people overstaying their visas on planes and then
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:46.640]  you have the southern border i mean something bad's coming if you read the fine print smallpox
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:52.560]  and measles and all this stuff it's they go look no we thought we're gone illegal aliens and i'm not
[02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:56.960]  against illegal aliens we should have given them treatment yeah well we're not against them as as
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:37:00.720]  human beings right we want to make mexico great again we want to make Guatemala great again we
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:05.520]  want to keep but you just can't let them in and then that's mean to them to not test them open
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:11.760]  borders only hurts the brown people in both countries it only makes rich white mexicans
[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:16.080]  richer and rich white right and that's the club of the rich the elitist attitude whether it's a
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:21.520]  rich mexican or a rich german or rich chinese is we live in the elite area screw them exploit it
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:25.760]  yeah well they they you know you live in these rich neighborhoods and they have their hate has no
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:31.120]  home here attitude and you realize the only visible minorities you see are your servants is your
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:36.800]  mate oh paul shows the numbers in england he'd looked at jk rallying all him saying how's these
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:40.320]  people you know in germany when they're throwing old germans out of their house and putting 20
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:48.880]  you know muslim men in it and literally it's 99.9 percent white yeah the whiter you are
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:54.400]  the more you cherish your precious little race and it's so insincere they don't really like
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:58.800]  black culture or brown they like the restaurants that's all it is i like when they come up to me
[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:02.880]  with a tray i like the fried chicken and i like the sag and i like you know you know this and that
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:07.360]  i like them serving me things and and i'm not speaking me i'm saying the the rich rich liberal
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:11.760]  elites i like them serving me things your jenna like when they dust my house but they don't
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:18.240]  you know play soccer with dominicans they don't roll dice with blacks they don't hang out at the
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:23.760]  apollo theater they're not into the culture they're into them being served they're like aristocrats
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:31.360]  and that they're important in britain it's not american what do you make of this spectacle of
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:38.400]  the the governor of virginia announcing he's a moral compass he's gonna teach us it's amazing
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:43.040]  you know i didn't want that guy to be pillared when i first heard the story and then i remembered
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:50.320]  wait a minute this is the guy who ran on a lie that trump supporters are driving through virginia
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:56.000]  with dixie flags on their trucks yeah trying to run over mexican children just trying to kill
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:00.480]  them he's the guy that got elected on that yes there was an ad you know the viewers there was
[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:06.240]  an ad yeah i pulled the virginia ad where a white guy in truck runs over mexican kids right
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:11.040]  they were scaling a fence like white guys in truss are going let me find some mexican kids to
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:17.200]  run them over there's one i'm gonna find me a mexico oh and a muslim too i know it's the
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:22.960]  muslims running folks over with cars yeah this is crazy why don't you just show footage of the
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:27.920]  west side highway instead of making a republican nominee with ed gillespie who is a moderate
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:33.520]  republican not a trumpist you know so they just are going to paint all white people all christians
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:38.320]  all republicans anyone who's not agreeing with the orthodox let's be clear gillespie's a neo con
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:43.040]  and he wasn't good enough yeah so you know you're racist we're all racist meanwhile this is an isis
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:48.800]  recruiting video run run run run run run children over no he's coming to kill us that's a slow truck
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:52.720]  by the way i would have killed those kids a hundred times over by now yeah yeah yeah yeah you know i
[02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:57.200]  brought this paddle can we get the camera oh he's got a don't tread on me a thing look at that crazy i
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:40:01.040]  but what about the who's the other guy it's all three of the leaders in an order in trouble well
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:04.320]  there's the other guy who admitted that he's like the attorney general or something and then he got
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:08.640]  the rapist fire him he's in blackface turns out he's in blackface yeah yeah so the attorney general
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:13.760]  mark herring was also in black or was also in blackface at least who knows they might also be
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:17.600]  in the kkk you don't know what these southern democrats and then the lieutenant governor
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:22.880]  justin fairfax you know apparently is going around grabbing you know women's tushies at the democrat
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:26.720]  national convention you know very credible allegations but suddenly the democrats are
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:31.520]  defending right right so they've got me too scandals and blackface scandals and kkk scandals
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:36.000]  and you know what you notice what i've noticed i've had a 12 year career but even in high school
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:41.760]  the only people who are caught in blackface or kkk outfits or kkk titles you know well i've
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:46.720]  been alive have only been democrats but let me tell you i've grown up in texas and by christian
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:52.960]  conservative parents my mom was socially you're liberal on a few things but we were like a shame
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:57.680]  that america ever did bad stuff we weren't like but then i would suddenly get around democrats
[02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:01.440]  and i'm not in the north but i'll try to go in you know north by the time i was in college
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:06.640]  and i'd be at a bar was supposed to be like yeah these gd such and such they're like what are you
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:12.160]  testing me because i'm not i'm my own person like my mother king i'm proud that i'm about what i stand
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:17.920]  for not what color i am and i just learned like my god is these democrat cities have been using racial
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:22.240]  management and cultural management and now they're trying on a whole country and it's not going to
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:26.480]  work it's going to blow up the north is much more racist than this absolutely as a as an immigrant
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:31.760]  i've noticed that absolutely the north hates them in practice but likes them in theory and the south
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:35.440]  hates them in theory but likes them in practice i i talk about this all the time look where have
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:41.200]  we had race riots we've had them in la detroit and then the fake south baltimore and fergersen
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:45.600]  you don't have it in atlanta which is called the the busy too busy the city too busy to care about
[02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:49.440]  race you don't have it in dallas you don't have it in jackson mississippi don't have it in alabama
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:54.160]  they've done that well i'm not virtually signaling but it was weird it's the truth it was weird when
[02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:58.560]  i was a kid at thanksgiving or christmas if i was at my grandma's house in texas that like a line of
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:04.880]  black people would bring all these incredible uh sweet potato pie and pumpkin pie and and hams
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:08.800]  and they were all crying giving my grandmother's food and it was because my grandfather was the
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:12.640]  county tax assessor and it didn't matter if you're poor black or poor white he'd come tell their rich
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:16.720]  neighbor we're going to increase your taxes this widow's not going to pay tax and and they did stand
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:20.960]  up against the kkk and you know and my grandfather was the first republican elected in that county
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:25.600]  uh and you know they got threatened and seven the black people literally worshiped my family
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:29.360]  all of a sudden i'm here with a southern property law center saying i'm a nazi
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:34.480]  i mean it's it's just not reality let's let's let's leave the left to their own but i feel
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:39.200]  like why are there's another car pulls up with black people giving us pies i don't think well
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:45.600]  just don't worry about they like us anyways because we stood up to the kkk and then i you know how to
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:50.000]  coexist in the south blacks and whites know how to coexist they don't in the north that's just the

[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:08.080]  it's going to take years and it's going to take a lot of money a whole lot of spending money
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:14.000]  you know we we met with the legal team we have two legal teams one in new york and one in alabama
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.960]  and you know gavin asked me he said are you ready to spend two years of your life
[02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:22.400]  doing this with me and i said if you're in man i'm in and so uh you know what we're doing is a
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:27.440]  multi-front war we've got two different legal teams we've got researchers researchers and we but
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:31.520]  what's really important is that we got to make sure that gavin doesn't disrupt his entire life he's
[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:35.680]  got a family to support you know he's got a new show i'm still gonna do stuff i'm gonna keep fighting
[02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:39.200]  but i don't think the the left and i don't think a lot of people on the right realize
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:44.880]  how much of the new rights time is spent in court balance jones the amount of time you spend in

[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  before congress gavin and ali uh ali i'm saying it wrong ali alexander they go there and they say
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:28.400]  none of this is happening that's lying to congress and it's really strange how we lost our freedom
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:32.240]  i don't know when this happened i think it's happened it's been an asymptote that's really
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:37.920]  ramped up in the past two to five years but we are happily censoring conservatives and christians
[02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:44.480]  in our own country and then making deals with these communists and saying yeah well we're fine
[02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:49.200]  without as long as we can have our app in your country we'll follow all your tyrannical rules
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:53.840]  we're living in a la la land you know i was i was i was talking with uh jesse who runs a lot
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:58.960]  of the creative direction over at culture.com with 3Ts and you know i was like you know 10 years
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:04.240]  ago i think things were crazy okay that was 2009 what are we in now and he said you know this is
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:10.640]  sci-fi this is sci-fi we're told to go to war with russia even though we're arming ukraine and poland
[02:51:10.640 --> 02:51:16.160]  and to ignore china you need to go to irvine california and see what the chinese are actually
[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:20.000]  doing it to our country they are gutting the country i'm not supposed to talk about this but
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:25.040]  you know go to cities like irvine california go to parts of oregon go to parts of washington state
[02:51:25.040 --> 02:51:29.200]  they're totally gutting our country they'll come and buy these houses in all cash they'll leave
[02:51:29.200 --> 02:51:34.400]  leave louis futon bags in their ferrari's and not care because it's all fake it's all fake and then
[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:38.880]  we're told they're using fiat currency their government premium and then trump isn't a fiat
[02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:44.000]  guy but he gets wearing a fiat right so he says give america fiat and the federal reserve goes no
[02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:48.240]  you're smart yeah i mean a lot of people don't actually get this we are explaining it so we're
[02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:53.360]  due for a solid we're due first i trade stocks i mean that's how some that's how i sustain myself
[02:51:53.360 --> 02:51:58.640]  so we're not for fiat but we're in a fiat war and trump gets it right so the higher the us dollar
[02:51:58.640 --> 02:52:05.200]  goes the more we can pay down our debt and so trump has engaged in type in this type of non-fiscal
[02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:09.920]  conservative policy in order to pump up the dollar but what people don't know and the the the media
[02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:15.200]  won't tell you and i hate this stuff is the reason why jesson trudeau had to make the new nafta deal
[02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:21.600]  is because their economy was down 32 percent when ours was up 32 percent that's a 64 spread so a lot
[02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:26.080]  of us don't see that in our day and just trump getting a few things fixed yes turning around but
[02:52:26.080 --> 02:52:30.480]  now they're taking power away from when the federal reserve right explain that though i'm not for fiat
[02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:35.520]  i'm not for deficits but if the chi comes and everybody else is in a race to the value right
[02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:40.400]  and they're giving themselves trillions of free money right give it to americans build factories
[02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:44.000]  because at least we've got infrastructure and pride right right so we're gonna have a freaking
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:49.200]  bubble baby let's ride that sucker all the way to bohala yeah you just actually described what's
[02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:54.800]  going on so trump is engaging with the system that we have until it can get fixed later but you
[02:52:54.800 --> 02:53:00.800]  know china's economy is also down 30 something like petership he's like oh no we don't know i get
[02:53:00.800 --> 02:53:06.720]  his like perfect puritan deal yeah the chinese government has a 10 growth rate they put tens
[02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:11.760]  of trillions into their market they prop it all up we're in we were put into a global market right
[02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:16.000]  we're playing by these rules and then trump goes you know i'm not gonna just give like obama did
[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:20.480]  for eight years zero percent interest to big mega banks mainly in europe and china right we're gonna
[02:53:20.480 --> 02:53:24.720]  actually make it for the people right and then the establishment craps their bridges and goes
[02:53:24.720 --> 02:53:29.200]  oh my god america may come back from the dead and just a slight like they're smothering us with a
[02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:33.840]  pillow trump halfway pulled it back we go oh god that air's good broon the pillow's right back on
[02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:39.200]  her face yeah that's that's that so what they want to do is that they want to increase the increase
[02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:43.840]  but trump should just open up the floodgates i say give everybody a million bucks freaking
[02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:48.240]  chai comes want to deal with like a million bucks everybody let's break the commies back
[02:53:48.240 --> 02:53:52.000]  right now because already can be flooded anyways breaks them and then reform you know bring them
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:55.600]  to the negotiating table and i think that that's what we three are about we don't we're engaged in
[02:53:55.600 --> 02:54:00.720]  a cold so we're being realist this is real real not all like oh my god we got the deficit and
[02:54:00.720 --> 02:54:06.640]  we're gonna go bankrupt the bank's already moved to china they're screwing us singapore beijing those
[02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:10.720]  are the next capitals of the world gavin you're looking at me with that no you guys are real smart
[02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:16.480]  about economics and stuff i thought fiat was a car i'm getting about 15 to 20 percent of this
[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:22.240]  he's got the cowboy hat between the two texans i'm not getting alley how much do you think trump
[02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:25.920]  statistically was able to get done of what he wanted to do i think like 20 percent
[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:30.720]  and it literally was like bringing day back tonight i mean it was it's it's it's stuff to say i would
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:33.920]  i would probably argue that it's more than that i don't agree with the heritage foundation that he
[02:54:33.920 --> 02:54:38.640]  got a hundred percent of his agenda or 80 percent of that's horse crap yeah so it's so that you know
[02:54:38.640 --> 02:54:42.000]  i don't want to get into why they're doing that it's not putting trump down no it's not well they
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:46.400]  want him to think everything's one right right right it's to defend mitch mcconnell on the chamber
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:50.800]  of commerce you know let's not get into it mitch mcconnell more keep labor yeah and so that so
[02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:55.920]  that mitch why we need more cheap mexicans for us to do it all hello he looks like a turtle you know
[02:54:55.920 --> 02:54:59.680]  let's pull up mitch mcconnell he looks like a turtle but his wife is the department of transportation
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:04.960]  secretary funded by soros so he wants to get an infrastructure bill through so that he can retire
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:09.200]  who's going to manage that money alex that two trillion dollars that goes through a you know an
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:13.680]  infrastructure bill this is a good you know i i try not to talk about it too much because it will
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:17.600]  get you hurt but um you know there's an infrastructure bill that can pass both parties
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:23.200]  and you know god he does look like a galopist tortoise jeez i want to preserve him i'm worried
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:26.720]  he's going to go extinct let's put him on the you know he's an endangered species
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:31.760]  and i think the when you see him with glasses it's almost like there's been too much pollution in
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:37.440]  the ocean you know he literally like 20 of our audience is tv we're mainly radio we're hundreds

[03:02:57.120 --> 03:03:01.760]  meeting him in town this is austin this is the yuppie town this is the blue center in a red state

[03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:11.040]  yourself and he's and then he called the police okay folks he's off calling the police i'll probably

[03:03:46.400 --> 03:03:51.920]  and then it started in uh in college we had a professor who was the head of the canadian communist
[03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:58.240]  party marvin glass and he said it's okay to abort a baby up until a year and a half after the baby's

[03:06:31.120 --> 03:06:35.760]  that's it i've never been here before i've never seen the splc's headquarters but it looks like
[03:06:35.760 --> 03:06:42.720]  jar fader's son's apartment doesn't it so yeah i i think the splc started out with noble intentions
[03:06:42.720 --> 03:06:50.400]  and then what i presume happened is the check started pouring in and they went wow this fighting
[03:06:50.400 --> 03:06:56.800]  hate thing is profitable and now i believe it's at 430 million and that doesn't include the money
[03:06:56.800 --> 03:07:02.240]  in the cayman islands which is probably comparable now when that is your business plan you need to
[03:07:02.240 --> 03:07:11.120]  expand the net of hatred it can't just be the kkk it has to be homophobia it has to be islamophobia
[03:07:11.120 --> 03:07:17.760]  transphobia and make it look like america is a racist hellhole a dangerous place to be and you
[03:07:17.760 --> 03:07:22.160]  look at their hate map on their site and there's there seems to be more hate groups and there are
[03:07:22.160 --> 03:07:34.320]  post offices they cast this white net of everyone's a nazi and they start destroying lives all right
[03:07:34.320 --> 03:07:40.000]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live polled joseph lawson from her britannic majesties
[03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:44.960]  england is taking over here in about two minutes but i gotta tell you allie alexander and of course
[03:07:44.960 --> 03:07:50.800]  the great gavin mckinnis are on fire today uh the news will say fake news earlier that was
[03:07:50.800 --> 03:07:56.240]  satire people keep saying alex jones admitted years ago in a custody battle for his children
[03:07:56.240 --> 03:08:02.000]  that he was an entertainer no my ex-wife was introducing video of me in lizard outfits in cobra
[03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:08.400]  commander outfits in in in whiteface as the joker you know saying all these i love the new world
[03:08:08.400 --> 03:08:13.840]  order i'm gonna kill your kids and my lawyer is like when he's doing that right satire he's an actor
[03:08:13.840 --> 03:08:19.360]  but oh my god he admits he's an actor no i'm being myself right now but earlier with the satire piece
[03:08:19.360 --> 03:08:23.040]  because let's just say or though there's a lot of the viewers or listeners they'll say that was real
[03:08:23.040 --> 03:08:28.720]  earlier yeah i don't i don't want to ruin the bit alex i can't but it was a bit of the class but it
[03:08:28.720 --> 03:08:34.160]  was real but it was real your brother just my brother was just here um but we have to do that
[03:08:34.160 --> 03:08:38.800]  because the left does this they lie so much we're not the big sarcastic now alie don't make me
[03:08:38.800 --> 03:08:44.720]  commit how many sins no but but i've brought that up i do work those words it's ollie it's ollie
[03:08:44.720 --> 03:08:49.520]  ollie like ollie Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali yeah i know you for years and i keep going yeah here's
[03:08:49.520 --> 03:08:54.560]  the thing alex alex i don't i don't know if i'm supposed to supposed to uh uh plug this or not but
[03:08:54.560 --> 03:09:01.600]  you know when i got pre footage of mike sternovich's hoax movie and it had you in it i have never seen
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:10.320]  anyone capture and explain what it is you do you are a newsman who engages in um you know hyperbole
[03:09:10.320 --> 03:09:15.680]  in exaggeration to exaggerate true points true points and it's color it's color this is what
[03:09:15.680 --> 03:09:20.960]  i hate about the war on alex you know why it's a war on color right and so i like that that's
[03:09:20.960 --> 03:09:25.760]  clever uh so people need to watch this info wars needs to put on their site because when alex
[03:09:25.760 --> 03:09:30.240]  jones is describing like i'm going to do this i'm going to do this and he gets these millions of people
[03:09:30.240 --> 03:09:35.120]  to tune into a very important issue that is a great service in in the information agent you
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:38.800]  know you should be praised for it yeah and and that's what i realized i was a normal gop
[03:09:38.800 --> 03:09:42.560]  operative and i you know someone said would you ever go on info wars i was like of course not
[03:09:42.560 --> 03:09:46.960]  and then eventually you know the hour is nigh all of us have to be networking we have to be

[03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:02.880]  the system they are after all of us right now i totally agree and in summation because look paul's

[03:12:57.440 --> 03:13:02.720]  taking over paul what do you think of these guys alie alexander here and gab mcganis these are both
[03:13:02.720 --> 03:13:07.680]  thought criminals what do you think well they're both patriots and obviously they're both standing
[03:13:07.680 --> 03:13:14.800]  up to social media censorship alex in terms of um now the media is again painting itself as the victim
[03:13:14.800 --> 03:13:20.560]  you've probably seen this um mega hat attack on the media last night at the uh trump rally they
[03:13:20.560 --> 03:13:27.440]  described it uh in two separate ways one it was quote an incredibly violent attack and then in
[03:13:27.440 --> 03:13:32.880]  the same news article they said that this guy shoved into them now of course no one advocates
[03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:38.000]  violence against the media but they're waiting alex to seize on anything against the media remember
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:44.080]  the shooting against the uh capital gazette last year which again was the result of a multi-year
[03:13:44.080 --> 03:13:50.080]  long vendetta by the gunman against individuals um at that newspaper for reports that he thought
[03:13:50.080 --> 03:13:56.080]  were inaccurate immediately cnn blamed it on trump's rhetoric now we've got this incident
[03:13:56.080 --> 03:14:02.560]  and according to a gateway pundit article the tag was still on the mega hat so it looks like a
[03:14:02.560 --> 03:14:09.520]  provocateur operation oh i meant to mention that what about this uh big big tv star guy the police
[03:14:09.520 --> 03:14:15.200]  have all the footage there's no evidence that he was ever attacked no guys in mega hat jesse no
[03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:20.960]  one's jesse it's jesse jesse mullet so he's saying he's saying it looks like another one of these
[03:14:20.960 --> 03:14:27.600]  staged events he said that he was attacked in the middle of the night two a.m in a gay and shishi
[03:14:27.600 --> 03:14:33.760]  neighborhood in soho or not soho but in chicago but it's like chicago's version of soho and they
[03:14:33.760 --> 03:14:40.800]  these rednecks with mega hats and ski masks said hey you're that f uh euphemism for homosexuals uh
[03:14:40.800 --> 03:14:45.920]  n word from the move the show empire which no white person's ever seen let alone any racist
[03:14:45.920 --> 03:14:51.440]  which turned into a huge stunt and now as usual i mean how many hate crimes are real and apparently
[03:14:51.440 --> 03:14:57.040]  they said we're in mega country boy which no one says it's chicago no one says you say
[03:14:57.040 --> 03:15:03.040]  trump country obama country bush country but you know mega country you don't use the slogan

[03:20:26.480 --> 03:20:31.360]  you're live it is the fourth hour of the alex jones show and we're talking about a story that's
[03:20:31.360 --> 03:20:38.160]  being hit a lot of play over here in the uk because it was essentially a vicious attack on a bbc
[03:20:38.160 --> 03:20:43.200]  cameraman that's how some news outlets are reporting it in fact there was a sky news report
[03:20:43.200 --> 03:20:49.600]  which is another british news outlet which reported this both as a shove and a quote
[03:20:49.600 --> 03:20:55.840]  incredibly violent attack this happened last night during trump's rally in el paso texas
[03:20:56.400 --> 03:21:01.920]  daily caller reports man in mega hat attacks press el paso trump rally now there's no actual
[03:21:01.920 --> 03:21:08.400]  video from what i've seen so far of the actual attack the incredibly violent attack on the media
[03:21:08.400 --> 03:21:16.560]  by this man wearing a mega hat who shouted f the media repeatedly until being dragged away by security
[03:21:17.440 --> 03:21:25.040]  now know that the man who tackled or grabbed this assailant responsible for the incredibly violent
[03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:31.280]  attack from behind was also a trump supporter wearing a mega hat again that's uh not being
[03:21:31.280 --> 03:21:35.840]  mentioned in the in the reports in the uk they see the incident right there the immediate aftermath
[03:21:35.840 --> 03:21:43.760]  of it and during this incident trump stopped his speech called out to the media to check if everyone
[03:21:43.760 --> 03:21:50.880]  was okay if the incident had passed off and had ended which it had and obviously we discourage
[03:21:50.880 --> 03:21:56.800]  all political violence including violence against the media but then gateway pundit has come out
[03:21:56.800 --> 03:22:03.680]  with an article asking was this a setup and they know that the tag or some kind of tag is still on
[03:22:03.680 --> 03:22:09.920]  the mega hat now it's not in the realms of wild conspiracy theory to suggest that violent
[03:22:09.920 --> 03:22:16.640]  provocateurs are inserted and have been inserted at trump rallies in fact there's this article from
[03:22:16.640 --> 03:22:22.960]  brightbot from back in october 2016 oh keith video sting exposes bird dogging democrats
[03:22:22.960 --> 03:22:29.920]  effort to incite violence at trump rallies and of course he got clinton campaign managers on tape
[03:22:29.920 --> 03:22:35.680]  admitting that they did use this tactic bird dogging to quote create a sense of anarchy
[03:22:35.680 --> 03:22:40.560]  around donald trump that would undermine his political support you remember i think the big
[03:22:41.120 --> 03:22:46.480]  trump rally in i think it was in chicago where it all kicked off and people just started having
[03:22:46.480 --> 03:22:51.760]  fist fights with each other and they had to basically cancel the event this was a admitted
[03:22:52.320 --> 03:22:59.040]  democratic tactic of bird dogging inserting violent individuals into trump rallies to make
[03:22:59.040 --> 03:23:04.880]  them start fights with trump supporters or to make them attack the media and it's a known tactic
[03:23:04.880 --> 03:23:10.560]  that's been uncovered by a secret recordings from james o'keith and other people so we asked the
[03:23:10.560 --> 03:23:15.680]  question given all the fake hate crimes that we've seen in the united states over the past few years
[03:23:16.320 --> 03:23:20.720]  we asked the same question as the gateway pundit was this a setup because we have this narrative
[03:23:21.760 --> 03:23:27.600]  in the media that trump supporters are violent unhinged they want to attack the media of course
[03:23:27.600 --> 03:23:31.920]  all the violent unhinged violence or the vast majority of it at least since trump's election
[03:23:31.920 --> 03:23:39.120]  has come from the left has come from antifa we've often played videos trump supporters being beaten
[03:23:39.120 --> 03:23:44.160]  being smacked in the head with flags and running away as they're assaulted by antifa by far left
[03:23:44.160 --> 03:23:51.840]  agitators but could this be an example of someone being planted at a rally to start an attack to
[03:23:51.840 --> 03:23:56.480]  create the narrative that the media is under threat because of course that is the narrative that
[03:23:56.480 --> 03:24:02.000]  they've been pushing we had the super bowl ad washington post super bowl ad which they spent
[03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:10.080]  over five million dollars on basically claiming that journalists are heroes not firefighters not
[03:24:10.080 --> 03:24:15.920]  soldiers but journalists now back in the day if you wanted to talk about war journalists you know
[03:24:15.920 --> 03:24:22.000]  the kind of people who ran just a few paces behind the guns in places like vietnam to get the truth
[03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:27.040]  yes you could call them heroes modern day journalists don't do that do they they find
[03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:33.440]  things that a few people are outraged about on twitter and make that into a huge story they ruin
[03:24:33.440 --> 03:24:39.760]  people's lives they smear them they open them up to doxing and harassment they often get them fired
[03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:48.880]  in many cases that's modern journalism that's not heroic you know bus feed losing 15 of its staff
[03:24:48.880 --> 03:24:55.120]  the huffings and posts losing its staff vice losing its staff and then them getting up on twitter
[03:24:55.120 --> 03:25:02.080]  begging for sympathy and leading outrage brigades leading lobbying campaigns to have people banned
[03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:08.800]  on twitter for tweeting hashtag learn to code that's not heroic either so the media set up this
[03:25:08.800 --> 03:25:14.320]  entire narrative that they're constantly under attack that their profession is under is under
[03:25:14.320 --> 03:25:19.600]  constant threat from trump who has no power to do anything basically in terms of you're not going
[03:25:19.600 --> 03:25:25.680]  to abridge the first amendment in any way but you know we have democracy dies in darkness and all this
[03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:33.200]  emotive grandstanding all this whining all this victimhood complex from the media so they're
[03:25:33.200 --> 03:25:37.680]  setting up this narrative that trump supports a violent and unhinged and are going to violently
[03:25:37.680 --> 03:25:44.400]  attack the media and we already had a taste of that last year in june in four wars headline cnn
[03:25:44.400 --> 03:25:51.840]  blames trump for newspaper shooting that had nothing to do with him this gunman in anapolis
[03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:58.880]  this was the capital gazette shooting jarrod ramos killed five journalists tragically last summer
[03:26:00.240 --> 03:26:06.240]  and immediately cnn came out and blamed trump's rhetoric despite the fact that we knew from records
[03:26:06.240 --> 03:26:12.720]  and from previous news reports that this gunman had had a vendetta against this newspaper because
[03:26:12.720 --> 03:26:19.760]  he'd sued them for defamation back in 2011 so he had a seven-year vendetta against this new
[03:26:19.760 --> 03:26:27.600]  newspaper he walks into this newspaper office and kills five people tragically cnn immediately got
[03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:33.040]  up cnn's asher ranger part blamed donald trump's rhetoric for the shooting even though he had
[03:26:33.040 --> 03:26:37.360]  nothing to do with it and the gunman had a 70 a vendetta against the journalist and that's why
[03:26:37.360 --> 03:26:42.800]  he targeted them but again they said donald trump's quote dangerous rhetoric could have
[03:26:42.800 --> 03:26:50.000]  been a motivating factor with no evidence for that whatsoever so we've got all these hate
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:57.280]  hoaxes happening we've got men in mega hats with tags on attacking journalists and we have had this
[03:26:57.280 --> 03:27:04.240]  narrative for many months now that violent trump supporters are about to attack the media are they
[03:27:04.240 --> 03:27:10.000]  preparing us in some way or at least trying to put this in the minds of the public where there's
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:16.720]  some kind of deranged idiot radical like you know the case of the mega bomber are they trying to
[03:27:16.720 --> 03:27:24.480]  inspire somebody to attack the media let's not forget that the one of the violent attacks on
[03:27:24.480 --> 03:27:29.040]  donald trump himself at his rallies of course we had the infamous example where the guy tried
[03:27:29.040 --> 03:27:34.640]  to rush him on stage two days later he was on cnn they were hailing him as a hero but there's
[03:27:34.640 --> 03:27:39.520]  actually a british guy his name slips my mind right now but he was i think he's an 18-year-old
[03:27:39.520 --> 03:27:45.040]  guy this was before the election grabbed the gun of an officer at one of these trump events and
[03:27:45.040 --> 03:27:51.520]  literally tried to assassinate trump it got minimal media coverage there you see the first
[03:27:51.520 --> 03:27:56.800]  incident i mentioned where the guy tried to rush trump on stage the only violence that these trump
[03:27:56.800 --> 03:28:03.120]  rallies apart from the one example where i think it was a black guy who got punched by a trump
[03:28:03.120 --> 03:28:10.000]  supporter but apart from that every single example of violence has been carried out by leftists and
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:17.200]  it's a known tactic called bird dogging which james o' keith uncovered and revealed that they implant
[03:28:17.200 --> 03:28:23.840]  violent individuals to stage violent incidences to make the whole rally look chaotic look out of
[03:28:23.840 --> 03:28:30.480]  control and look violent so people are now asking the question was this a setup this mega hat attack
[03:28:30.480 --> 03:28:37.200]  on the media which they described as incredibly violent and also as a shove who knows because
[03:28:37.200 --> 03:28:43.040]  there's no video of it but we have to be cognizant of the fact that violent attacks against the media
[03:28:43.040 --> 03:28:48.320]  could be exploited by the media to paint itself as a victim and we need to discourage those attacks

[03:33:29.840 --> 03:33:35.600]  this big article up on info wars dot com right now headline french intellectual zemore elites
[03:33:35.600 --> 03:33:41.200]  organized migrant invasion so they could import servant class and he's put his finger on the
[03:33:41.200 --> 03:33:47.440]  pulse of one of the primary reasons why the elite does encourage mass migration and basically it's
[03:33:47.440 --> 03:33:54.240]  to import a servant class that is no longer there to serve their needs now this was a talk he gave
[03:33:54.240 --> 03:34:01.120]  recently eric zemore is a big intellectual in france he's an author public speaker and he says
[03:34:01.120 --> 03:34:06.080]  that the elite organized an invasion of europe via mass immigration primarily because they wanted
[03:34:06.080 --> 03:34:11.920]  to import a servant class to replace europeans who are no longer willing to perform menial
[03:34:11.920 --> 03:34:18.080]  tasks and this is one of the primary reasons why the yellow vests have popped up in france
[03:34:18.800 --> 03:34:23.200]  over the past what is it almost three months now they've been out three months maybe total
[03:34:23.920 --> 03:34:27.360]  one of the reasons that they give when people interview yellow vests is that
[03:34:27.920 --> 03:34:32.320]  they're no longer willing to tolerate you know stagnant wages and a standard of living that
[03:34:32.320 --> 03:34:39.200]  continues to drop year after year after year and they don't want to do the menial slave class jobs
[03:34:39.200 --> 03:34:46.320]  to service the globalists and this is what eric zemore has said in his speech quote today the
[03:34:46.320 --> 03:34:51.520]  economic organization of the world relies on large cities large metropolises where the winners of
[03:34:51.520 --> 03:34:57.040]  globalism live and that's the key point you know these mega cities keep getting bigger and bigger
[03:34:57.040 --> 03:35:02.960]  more people are moving away from the countryside leaving behind those yellow vest protested in
[03:35:02.960 --> 03:35:08.400]  france who are dependent on you know slightly different economic models to succeed but he
[03:35:08.400 --> 03:35:14.000]  continues and those winners of globalism who are connected to the world need servants voila they
[03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:19.680]  need servants to deliver the sushi to bring them pizza to babysit their children to work in the
[03:35:19.680 --> 03:35:25.680]  restaurants to work everywhere in the large cities and the servants you know the old european
[03:35:25.680 --> 03:35:31.280]  peoples french english they don't want to they don't want to they decide they don't feel like
[03:35:31.280 --> 03:35:36.400]  working in this profession they consider they aren't paid enough and so on therefore there has
[03:35:36.400 --> 03:35:41.280]  been an entire organized action for the last 20 years for the purpose of getting rid of those
[03:35:41.280 --> 03:35:48.160]  original peoples who don't want to perform the job they're asked to do and to replace them and
[03:35:48.160 --> 03:35:53.440]  this is what you see in places like london you know globalist metropolis mega cities where the
[03:35:53.440 --> 03:35:59.280]  winners of globalism do live and where they have nannies who raise their children and where they
[03:35:59.280 --> 03:36:04.960]  don't want to pay those nannies double the price where they have cleaners that clean their properties
[03:36:04.960 --> 03:36:10.400]  and they don't want to pay them double the price so they vote for remain they vote against things
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:16.640]  like brexit they vote for the winners for the globalists in which they're a part of that movement
[03:36:17.520 --> 03:36:23.760]  and again this is a movement against the working class globalism always punishes the working class
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:28.960]  and this is the point that zemore is making in this speech he goes on to make the point
[03:36:28.960 --> 03:36:35.040]  that elites are organizing the invasion and he added that globalists treat individual people
[03:36:35.040 --> 03:36:40.320]  as if they have no roots and he talks about this in the sense of christian universalism
[03:36:41.040 --> 03:36:46.400]  universalism gone mad which thinks that every human is an individual with no roots and that
[03:36:46.400 --> 03:36:52.240]  man is reduced to the condition of consumer so from the perspective of the globalists he can be
[03:36:52.240 --> 03:36:57.520]  from any culture any race any origin it doesn't matter so long as he is consuming night voila
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:37:02.960]  this is the universalism of consumers and he makes the point which i've made before
[03:37:04.080 --> 03:37:10.560]  that the scale of mass immigration into europe into the west in general is so rapid that there's
[03:37:10.560 --> 03:37:15.760]  no chance whatsoever for them to assimilate there's no chance whatsoever to see any kind of real
[03:37:15.760 --> 03:37:22.640]  integration and in fact the reverse is happening inverse assimilation where the populations who
[03:37:22.640 --> 03:37:27.440]  are being supplanted who are being swamped the native populations in these european cities
[03:37:27.440 --> 03:37:33.200]  are either choosing to leave which is what we saw for example in the east of london where all
[03:37:33.200 --> 03:37:41.280]  the white people fled to esics which is a county just bordering london and it got replaced by you
[03:37:41.280 --> 03:37:48.000]  know muslims islamists who basically have swamped many areas of east london now he makes the same
[03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:53.280]  point rather than these migrants coming in and assimilating and integrating there are so many
[03:37:53.280 --> 03:37:59.040]  of them that the people the native people left in these areas where these migrants flood in
[03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:07.440]  they assimilate to the migrants culture so it's reverse colonization it's inverse assimilation
[03:38:07.440 --> 03:38:13.120]  and again this was emphasized by a story that we had recently whereby in areas of vienna
[03:38:14.240 --> 03:38:19.200]  white girls young girls and young women who are being harassed by male muslim migrants
[03:38:19.200 --> 03:38:24.640]  because that's just what they like to do reference cologne germany is the biggest example of that
[03:38:24.640 --> 03:38:29.200]  new year's eve where hundreds of women were molested and a few of them in some cases were raped
[03:38:29.760 --> 03:38:34.240]  so their fathers told them to start wearing islamic headscarfs when they were walking
[03:38:34.240 --> 03:38:39.440]  home from work or from school so they wouldn't be sexually harassed by male muslim migrants
[03:38:40.400 --> 03:38:46.640]  again an example of reverse colonization inverse assimilation where the populations there get
[03:38:46.640 --> 03:38:53.360]  taken over by a stronger more closely knit group which is muslim families essentially
[03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:58.240]  they've got large families they're very close unlike you know in many way major western cities
[03:38:58.240 --> 03:39:01.840]  where people don't even talk to their neighbors anymore don't even know who their neighbors are
[03:39:02.480 --> 03:39:06.560]  so the native population assimilates to their culture even though they're the outside group
[03:39:06.560 --> 03:39:12.960]  coming in so again he makes the point that mass immigration is an attack on the working
[03:39:12.960 --> 03:39:18.000]  class this is what has come out of the yellow vest movement as well and it's the way of importing
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:23.760]  a wage slave servant class for the elite which is no longer there from the native population
[03:39:23.760 --> 03:39:29.520]  because they're not willing to do those jobs because the wages have stagnated forget about
[03:39:29.520 --> 03:39:35.200]  needing two people in a household to maintain a household now you have groups of migrants in
[03:39:35.200 --> 03:39:41.360]  some areas of london and france you know living tend to a property each earning if they're earning
[03:39:41.360 --> 03:39:46.800]  at all if they're not on welfare minimum wage or below minimum wage on the black market but
[03:39:46.800 --> 03:39:52.400]  they're servicing the elite and they're willing to put up with that lifestyle because again once
[03:39:52.400 --> 03:39:57.040]  they send their money back to their home countries you know places like afghanistan it's worth way
[03:39:57.040 --> 03:40:01.840]  more so they can support their families and eventually they can return if they want to they've
[03:40:01.840 --> 03:40:07.600]  got that option but they're perfectly willing to have a far lower standard of living and people
[03:40:07.600 --> 03:40:14.160]  in the west so then perfectly willing to do these wage slave servant class jobs which european native
[03:40:14.160 --> 03:40:19.040]  people on the elite the globalists are perfectly happy with that situation which is one of the
[03:40:19.040 --> 03:40:26.880]  main reasons why they're importing migrants on mass it's an attack on the working class and that's
[03:40:26.880 --> 03:40:33.760]  also exemplified with this story out of breitbart bbc journalist allegedly likened working class to
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:42.160]  cannibals so tommy robinson did an appearance of panorama which is a big bbc show he secretly
[03:40:42.160 --> 03:40:49.760]  recorded for his own protection john sweeney who was the head hon show of this show and he was
[03:40:49.760 --> 03:40:56.000]  caught referring to working class men as being like cannibals from amazonia in an undercover video
[03:40:56.000 --> 03:41:02.800]  so they're literally discovering working class people in the green room of this show that they're
[03:41:02.800 --> 03:41:08.640]  recording and they're treating it as if it's like a david attenborough documentary where he's going
[03:41:08.640 --> 03:41:14.400]  out into the wild and and catching like an amazon a rare amazonian tribe and it's in its natural
[03:41:14.400 --> 03:41:20.800]  environment this is literally what they think of working class people because they're so secluded
[03:41:20.800 --> 03:41:27.600]  from the people who they claim to represent it's like when middle class people in london especially
[03:41:27.600 --> 03:41:34.480]  literally virtue signal about how that's so pro diversity and so pro minority and how much they
[03:41:34.480 --> 03:41:41.040]  love muslims and black people none of them live around muslims and black people i've done videos
[03:41:41.040 --> 03:41:46.800]  on this the most virulent virtue signal is about mass immigration the ones who live in london live
[03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:52.400]  in the whitest areas of london that you could possibly live in they don't live around these people
[03:41:52.400 --> 03:41:56.960]  they don't use public transport they have private health care they don't have to use
[03:41:56.960 --> 03:42:02.000]  nhs government health care which has a massive burden on it as a result of mass immigration
[03:42:02.800 --> 03:42:08.880]  they don't interact with working class people or with black people or muslims who typically
[03:42:08.880 --> 03:42:15.600]  tend to also be in that bracket of income working class in fact it's the white working class people
[03:42:16.160 --> 03:42:22.960]  the ones who mainly voted for brexit who do relate and live around and live amongst black people
[03:42:22.960 --> 03:42:29.360]  and muslims and yet they're the ones who are constantly castigated as being racists even
[03:42:29.360 --> 03:42:34.960]  though the middle class the upper middle class have completely segregated themselves from black
[03:42:34.960 --> 03:42:41.200]  people from muslims so they've literally got a guy working for the bbc likening working class
[03:42:41.200 --> 03:42:47.120]  people to cannibals to amazonian tribes does nothing more than that reflect the sheer arrogance
[03:42:47.120 --> 03:42:51.520]  that these people viewers will we'll be back at the alex joneshow live breaking news info was

[03:49:13.120 --> 03:49:18.160]  still is trending from what i see it was trending number one for hours earlier today and wait for
[03:49:18.160 --> 03:49:26.240]  it it's a shocker esquire magazine wait for it prepare yourself they featured on their front page
[03:49:26.240 --> 03:49:35.520]  for their march 2019 issue a white man yes it was to be more accurate a white teen and that
[03:49:35.520 --> 03:49:43.840]  provoked absolute bedlam toys out of the prem freaking out from progressives on twitter again
[03:49:43.840 --> 03:49:51.920]  because the ban the teen is male and white headline and esquire magazine profile of 17-year-old
[03:49:51.920 --> 03:49:57.120]  white teen prompts outrage from leftists now i was looking into this article to see if there
[03:49:57.120 --> 03:50:01.840]  was any other reason why there would be so much outrage so much frothing no it's the simple fact
[03:50:01.840 --> 03:50:07.760]  that they've chosen a white male to be on the front page of their magazine this is where we're at
[03:50:07.760 --> 03:50:15.120]  right now and in this article you will see a deluge of tweets from leftists will some of the
[03:50:15.120 --> 03:50:20.880]  daily beast totally baffled by this 7000 plus word esquire cover story about a run of the mill
[03:50:20.880 --> 03:50:26.960]  republican teen who likes cool sneakers ominously we're told this is only part one of a new series
[03:50:26.960 --> 03:50:32.320]  and even though the editor came out afterwards and said this is just part one we're going to have
[03:50:32.320 --> 03:50:40.240]  black people lgbt people whoever else muslims no it's not good enough the very fact that this white
[03:50:40.240 --> 03:50:48.160]  male was on there once is enough to cause them to break out in hives absolutely incredible
[03:50:48.160 --> 03:50:54.160]  cool so again the point is clear if you're upset over the fact that somebody is on the
[03:50:54.160 --> 03:51:00.960]  front page of a magazine because of their skin color then you're a racist period full stop
[03:51:02.160 --> 03:51:06.400]  so they even tried to backtrack and semi apologize for it but they're still getting
[03:51:06.400 --> 03:51:12.960]  heat on twitter because it's black history month so now every person on the cover of every major
[03:51:12.960 --> 03:51:19.360]  magazine apparently has to be black because that's diversity in fact there was another magazine
[03:51:20.640 --> 03:51:27.520]  i think it was out magazine which featured a whole issue the entire magazine featured only
[03:51:27.520 --> 03:51:32.560]  women and non-binary females which means basically anyone who claims to be
[03:51:33.360 --> 03:51:37.760]  anyone of the infinity number of genders that they've now invented in their head
[03:51:37.760 --> 03:51:45.280]  one of the individuals involved in this project janet mark tweeted only women and non-binary
[03:51:45.280 --> 03:51:51.600]  fems wrote styled photographs and were featured in its pages so they've got an entire magazine
[03:51:51.600 --> 03:51:58.080]  that eliminates an entire gender and they're calling that diversity and inclusivity but
[03:51:58.080 --> 03:52:06.320]  having a single story about a white person that's offensive that's white privilege bottom line is
[03:52:06.320 --> 03:52:12.320]  it's okay to be white and anyone who gets salty over the mere sight of a white person
[03:52:12.320 --> 03:52:16.960]  is a racist deal with it absolutely incredible the level it's reached
[03:52:18.000 --> 03:52:22.640]  meanwhile ex-google engineer hails youtube censorship as historic victory now looking
[03:52:22.640 --> 03:52:28.400]  into jordan peterson videos well who could have seen this coming oh yeah we did the first time it
[03:52:28.400 --> 03:52:35.040]  happened so buzzfeed and we talked about this on the show before came out with an article
[03:52:35.040 --> 03:52:41.920]  where they said oh my god the horror youtube is recommending conspiracy videos to people who watch
[03:52:41.920 --> 03:52:48.960]  conspiracy videos the absolute horror so buzzfeed came out with this entire again contrived moral
[03:52:48.960 --> 03:52:56.160]  outrage story but in that article they conflated flat earth conspiracy theories fake moon landing
[03:52:56.160 --> 03:53:03.600]  stuff like that with ben Shapiro with the neshta suzer with prager university and with jordan peterson
[03:53:03.600 --> 03:53:10.400]  so the agenda was obvious from the beginning within 24 hours of that buzzfeed article youtube
[03:53:10.400 --> 03:53:15.920]  put out a statement saying now we're going to bury quote conspiracy theory content in the
[03:53:15.920 --> 03:53:20.720]  algorithm so it doesn't come up as recommended videos which by the way is where most people's
[03:53:20.720 --> 03:53:25.680]  youtube views come from well now an ex-google engineer who previously worked on youtube's
[03:53:25.680 --> 03:53:31.680]  algorithm has shifted his attention to finding out why jordan peterson's videos get so much
[03:53:31.680 --> 03:53:38.880]  traction so again he hails youtube algorithm change as a historic victory then people are
[03:53:38.880 --> 03:53:45.200]  asking about him about it in the thread of this tweet he started talking about quote political
[03:53:45.200 --> 03:53:50.240]  abuse and radicalization which are two of the buzz terms used by the left to again try and
[03:53:50.240 --> 03:53:55.440]  censor conservatives then someone asked him why jordan peterson's videos were being recommended
[03:53:55.440 --> 03:54:00.640]  to everyone and he said that he's working on that and he's working on the understanding the reasons
[03:54:00.640 --> 03:54:06.240]  as to why that happens so you know where this is going they start off with conspiracy theories they
[03:54:06.240 --> 03:54:11.680]  start off with you know harmful misleading information and within a few paragraphs you're
[03:54:11.680 --> 03:54:17.840]  talking about ben Shapiro who's one of the most mainstream conservatives fox news level
[03:54:17.840 --> 03:54:25.040]  conservatives out there so obviously yes it's a back door once again to de-platform to silence
[03:54:25.040 --> 03:54:30.960]  to turn the volume down on right of center political opinion we saw through it from the
[03:54:30.960 --> 03:54:36.320]  very beginning it was so transparent and now one of this one of the people who helped build
[03:54:36.320 --> 03:54:41.040]  youtube's algorithm which by the way is the second biggest search engine in the world we've
[03:54:41.040 --> 03:54:47.440]  highlighted that before you know mark dice can put out a video about michelle obama you search
[03:54:47.440 --> 03:54:53.360]  for it on youtube with the exact title of the video it's got millions of views and yet it's
[03:54:53.360 --> 03:54:59.920]  buried on page four beneath dozens and dozens of mainstream media videos which in some cases
[03:54:59.920 --> 03:55:05.280]  have nothing to do with even michelle obama the subject which which is searched for you put in
[03:55:05.280 --> 03:55:12.480]  the direct exact headline doesn't show up because they broke their own search algorithm to game it
[03:55:12.480 --> 03:55:17.600]  to silence conservatives transparently meanwhile pitch high and the rest of them get up in front
[03:55:17.600 --> 03:55:24.480]  of congress and lie and say that there's no partisan bias then we get the leaked transcript from
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:29.680]  within google which alan bachari at brightwater revealed with them openly admitting yes there's
[03:55:29.680 --> 03:55:37.280]  clearly a partisan bias well go to an abortion search for example and too many of the videos
[03:55:37.280 --> 03:55:43.120]  at the top of the search or anti-abortion so a slate writer complains about it in an article
[03:55:43.120 --> 03:55:48.080]  within 24 hours or a few days in that case i think it was youtube had completely changed
[03:55:48.080 --> 03:55:53.840]  the ranking in which these results appeared so pro-abortion results appeared well above any
[03:55:53.840 --> 03:56:00.080]  anti-abortion results and they did this with google as well during the irish referendum on abortion
[03:56:01.360 --> 03:56:06.160]  remember robert eppstein has done studies which show they can shift millions and millions of
[03:56:06.160 --> 03:56:12.320]  votes on election day based on which search result appears above which other search result
[03:56:12.320 --> 03:56:19.840]  on any given day if they do that on election day they can swing elections and that's why it matters
[03:56:19.840 --> 03:56:24.240]  that's why we need some kind of executive order which forbids them or at least changes
[03:56:24.240 --> 03:56:30.960]  the communications act to forbid these platforms from behaving like publishers for partisan bias
[03:56:30.960 --> 03:56:37.440]  ends which essentially is election meddling and on that subject in forwards dot com reports
[03:56:37.440 --> 03:56:43.840]  bombshell apple demands natural news stop writing about abortion satanism threatens to block app
[03:56:43.840 --> 03:56:49.920]  from apple devices this is a mike adams article so again they're behaving like publishers not
[03:56:49.920 --> 03:56:56.240]  like platforms they're saying if you have content that's anti-abortion if you call out new york for
[03:56:56.240 --> 03:57:01.760]  passing legislation which allows for late term abortions basically aborting babies when they're
[03:57:01.760 --> 03:57:07.520]  fully grown absolutely despicable and sick then you're not going to be allowed on their platform
[03:57:07.520 --> 03:57:14.480]  okay that's not hate speech that's policing opinions held by millions and millions of people
[03:57:14.480 --> 03:57:19.840]  in the united states so yes they are behaving like publishers they stop behaving like platforms
[03:57:19.840 --> 03:57:25.200]  a long time ago and we need some actual regulation and teeth we can't just keep saying
[03:57:25.200 --> 03:57:31.520]  my free market because we're getting silence out of existence and if it doesn't change it's going to
