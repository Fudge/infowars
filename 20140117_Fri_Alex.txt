[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.920 --> 00:19.440]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.440 --> 00:41.840]  Alex Jones
[00:41.840 --> 00:45.720]  okay I'm out of breath I'm out of breath I was back there in the coffee room
[00:45.720 --> 00:50.960]  we've got different state-run media channels up in all the studios in the
[00:50.960 --> 00:59.360]  hallways in the writers offices we were monitoring C-SPAN CNN MSNBC Fox you
[00:59.360 --> 01:06.000]  name it and I barely made it back because Obama just ended his 15 eight
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.080]  minutes speech just about two minutes ago on C-SPAN they were carrying it and
[01:13.080 --> 01:19.720]  he said NSA agents are our neighbors and our friends even though panels admit
[01:19.720 --> 01:23.400]  that the program hasn't prevented any terrorist attacks and say that we are
[01:23.400 --> 01:29.120]  now a police state and spies want Edward Snowden dead that's from BuzzFeed
[01:29.120 --> 01:34.520]  we're gonna tie it all into the NSA takeover folks this is all illegal it
[01:34.520 --> 01:38.920]  has nothing to do with fighting terrorism it is all about dominating and
[01:38.920 --> 01:43.600]  controlling markets and society for select inside groups it is the total
[01:43.600 --> 01:48.440]  monopoly it is like all of us living in glass houses all the establishment is
[01:48.440 --> 01:53.120]  making everything they do more secret and they've got all these different
[01:53.120 --> 01:57.640]  people calling for Snowden's death and that's up on info wars.com right now and
[01:57.640 --> 02:04.240]  what else is up on info wars.com is just a mega important article that I've
[02:04.240 --> 02:10.560]  got Paul Watson joining us on at the start of the next segment from England
[02:10.560 --> 02:17.400]  from Albion from Britannia Watson will be joining us ladies and gentlemen the
[02:17.400 --> 02:22.680]  think tanks aren't just calling for Snowden to be killed this ties in to the
[02:22.680 --> 02:27.960]  article on Drudge where the spies won Edward Snowden dead the author of the
[02:27.960 --> 02:37.080]  shocking on doctrine Harlan K. Ullman has come out at an Atlantic Council
[02:37.080 --> 02:41.240]  meeting this is the guy that meets with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs the
[02:41.240 --> 02:45.800]  chairman and the other Joint Chiefs and called for eliminating quote and I
[02:45.800 --> 02:52.160]  tweeted this out of real Alex Jones non-state actors and empowered individuals
[02:52.160 --> 02:58.160]  and he said the state is failing the New World Order is failing it is failing by
[02:58.160 --> 03:04.360]  the way it's about ten years behind and it's still in the pole position but they
[03:04.360 --> 03:08.400]  got three laps to go fires coming out of the engine it's gonna blow it's gonna
[03:08.400 --> 03:12.160]  blow and I don't know if they can put up the dump you back together again they
[03:12.160 --> 03:16.280]  may be able to with a nuclear war or something and that's what he said he
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.440]  said without a giant mega worldwide crisis they're done and they are they're
[03:21.440 --> 03:25.520]  done they're done so they're on the bridge of their ship it's on fire
[03:25.520 --> 03:31.040]  they're attacking the ship of liberty and if they're gonna blow up they're gonna
[03:31.040 --> 03:35.460]  blow us up that's basically what they're threatening to do they're holding us
[03:35.460 --> 03:39.440]  hostage like when you catch the bank robber and the cops come in he grabs a
[03:39.440 --> 03:42.000]  woman and puts the gun to her head he says get back or I'll blow her head off
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.880]  I mean that's what they're doing right now and you know what I just we just
[03:45.880 --> 03:52.920]  exposed are the ones behind it and we say okay go ahead pull the trigger go
[03:52.920 --> 03:57.800]  ahead pull the trigger because there's gonna be no mercy for you and yours when
[03:57.800 --> 04:02.200]  you do and you're not gonna get away with this but when we tell them go ahead
[04:02.200 --> 04:06.280]  and pull the trigger they're gonna pause for a moment and then we politically
[04:06.280 --> 04:10.480]  pull the trigger and they won't know what hit them you understand that go ahead
[04:10.480 --> 04:16.000]  pull the trigger right as they hesitate boom we pull the trigger politically but
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.840]  I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen they are getting ready and I don't know
[04:19.840 --> 04:23.720]  what false flags are gonna pull but my spidey sense is pegging the meter
[04:23.720 --> 04:27.920]  everybody else who's got discernment got their head screwed on straight nose we
[04:27.920 --> 04:33.800]  are in mega crisis and it's an incredible time to be alive right now

[08:41.040 --> 08:47.560]  plan to rein in NSA phone sweeps the president's plan to limit the NSA's
[08:47.560 --> 08:52.840]  most controversial program will it be enough to calm privacy fears I love how
[08:52.840 --> 08:59.360]  the dinosaur media sits there while Obama and the other globalist front
[08:59.360 --> 09:05.160]  people run around denying the NSA sweeping up all the data denying if
[09:05.160 --> 09:08.720]  they're tracking everywhere you go and what you do denying they have plans to
[09:08.720 --> 09:12.720]  tax your car by the mile or that smart meters are dialing into all the hidden
[09:12.720 --> 09:17.680]  chips in all the new appliances to listen to you and watch you while they
[09:17.680 --> 09:24.480]  simultaneously make hundreds of billions of dollars a year just in western
[09:24.480 --> 09:29.920]  Europe the United States England Australia multinational corporations make
[09:29.920 --> 09:33.320]  over a hundred billion dollars a year conservatively getting paid by
[09:33.320 --> 09:40.760]  governments to spy and to run these spy networks and the entire infrastructure
[09:40.760 --> 09:47.840]  of the technotronic technological age since the 1970s under the Brzezinski
[09:47.840 --> 09:54.520]  plan has had backdoors tracker chips tracker wireless systems hidden
[09:54.520 --> 10:03.200]  cameras microphones built into it several orders worse than 1984 and it's
[10:03.200 --> 10:08.600]  all coming out now and they're still busy going oh we don't troll all the email
[10:08.600 --> 10:12.360]  we don't troll all the phone data we're not and then of course it comes out
[10:12.360 --> 10:17.200]  there they are so they'll focus in on one area of a program where they
[10:17.200 --> 10:20.840]  intercepted a hundred thousand plus packages of people having computers
[10:20.840 --> 10:26.160]  mailed to them from Apple Microsoft you name it when the government puts a
[10:26.160 --> 10:30.560]  surveillance chip that transmits everything back to them in your
[10:30.560 --> 10:37.960]  computer that is the tip of the tip of the tip of the iceberg all the major
[10:37.960 --> 10:45.400]  computers and quote smartphones for over a decade have capacitor chips that
[10:45.400 --> 10:50.720]  can be activated by remote control and powered by outside microwaves period
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.560]  that's patented that's in the computers we've written articles a year ago
[10:55.560 --> 11:00.680]  listing the chips that do it now that all broke on Monday and the New York
[11:00.680 --> 11:04.960]  Times is patting themselves on the back for telling you they saw a snowflake
[11:04.960 --> 11:07.920]  falling in the North Atlantic well meanwhile we're in the middle of a giant
[11:07.920 --> 11:12.040]  iceberg field and they're saying you know we're breaking some news that there
[11:12.040 --> 11:17.640]  might be some frozen ice around here this is ridiculous and they're only
[11:17.640 --> 11:24.280]  doing this because they become so passé they become so dinosaur they become so
[11:24.280 --> 11:30.560]  absolutely discredited they know all of this they know what's going on they
[11:30.560 --> 11:38.120]  know the system a bipartisan global long-term strategic program to roll out
[11:38.120 --> 11:45.840]  what they call the technocracy for the quote scientific autocratic global
[11:45.840 --> 11:51.080]  rule of a leech to quote Zabignan Brzezinski I call it the scientific
[11:51.080 --> 11:55.040]  dictatorship and then they talk to you like your children and go there's none
[11:55.040 --> 12:00.160]  of that happening why there was another Huffington Post article out yesterday
[12:00.160 --> 12:06.960]  that I never mentioned it's for the GOP an abyss instead of ideas and they say
[12:06.960 --> 12:11.480]  many of the ideas first media matters put this out last week so the Huffington
[12:11.480 --> 12:15.360]  Post everybody's picking it up salon all of government run groups government
[12:15.360 --> 12:20.880]  fellow travelers Jones claims the government's buying armored vehicles and
[12:20.880 --> 12:26.240]  bullets and preparing for civil unrest he's and they just say he's discredited
[12:26.240 --> 12:33.280]  and it's not true that's like saying it's not 1112 central as we broadcast live
[12:33.280 --> 12:39.160]  and then I don't give you any proof I mean of course it is 1112 central am from
[12:39.160 --> 12:42.960]  Austin Texas is where I come to but it's just like no no Alex Jones wasn't on the
[12:42.960 --> 12:52.360]  year at 1112 central on the 17th day of January 2014 in fact it's not even 2014
[12:52.360 --> 12:56.760]  right now that's discredited as well in fact there's not even a planet Earth
[12:56.760 --> 13:00.920]  like you don't even exist all this is a dream none of its real all there is this
[13:00.920 --> 13:06.200]  big brother in Obama or your racist and the health care plan doesn't kick you
[13:06.200 --> 13:09.560]  off your doctor and doesn't raise any premiums and that's a conspiracy theory
[13:09.560 --> 13:13.400]  if you say it does and then well okay Obama you said it wouldn't do this but
[13:13.400 --> 13:18.000]  now it does I never said that see that's right there's no drones there's no
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.440]  bullets there's no armored vehicles there's no black uniforms there's no NSA
[13:22.440 --> 13:26.800]  there's no war it's only peace he got a piece right here's Fox News channel
[13:26.800 --> 13:30.440]  thanks for taking my question will you taught data center hold the data of
[13:30.440 --> 13:41.160]  American citizens no that's a clapper head of cyber security who also told
[13:41.160 --> 13:46.000]  Congress along with Alexander and others that that we're not spying on anyone
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.120]  there there's no surveillance we hold no data I mean it's just it's not
[13:52.120 --> 13:59.000]  happening conspiracy theorists and again they have the Huffington Post come out
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.840]  and literally say oh my gosh the Republicans listen to Alex Jones oh
[14:03.840 --> 14:09.520]  they're so discredited oh no Alex Jones says the fellow reserves private Alex
[14:09.520 --> 14:12.480]  Jones says it's called it's in a 21 takeover with the health care to create
[14:12.480 --> 14:15.800]  death panels and cut the quality of care and bring in total social control and
[14:15.800 --> 14:19.440]  Alex Jones says there's a cloud and pivot plan to bankrupt the nation to
[14:19.440 --> 14:24.560]  socialize us to Alex Jones said and of course it's all true so so so what do we
[14:24.560 --> 14:30.360]  do I mean it's scary there's all these libertarians and freedom lovers they're
[14:30.360 --> 14:35.880]  listening to Alex Jones and and and and he's discredited he's discredited because
[14:35.880 --> 14:40.800]  we said because we have the moral authority we're in charge and you do
[14:40.800 --> 14:44.600]  what we say so you don't lose your doctor none of your health care premiums
[14:44.600 --> 14:47.760]  one up even though they're doubling dribbling and by the way Obama never
[14:47.760 --> 14:52.800]  promised they wouldn't so they went up but they didn't and Obama promised they
[14:52.800 --> 14:56.960]  wouldn't but it's a conspiracy ever said that so he never did you understand
[14:56.960 --> 15:01.920]  that good I'm glad you understand that now okay now drink your fluoride take
[15:01.920 --> 15:06.140]  your vaccines eat your GMOs and roll over and watch some television and get

[15:16.880 --> 15:21.880]  the backdrop of Obama saying quote calm down these agents are our neighbors and
[15:21.880 --> 15:25.880]  our friends of course the NSA didn't exist it wasn't spying on you illegally
[15:25.880 --> 15:32.200]  now that's all come out so they're like we come in peace we're your friends they

[17:46.480 --> 17:54.040]  must be done now now listen empowered individuals are the enemy of the state
[17:54.040 --> 17:59.080]  and he says in this a public journal war on terror is not the only threat get it
[17:59.080 --> 18:03.360]  war on terror no no no now the terror is now the threat is an al-Qaeda that these
[18:03.360 --> 18:09.400]  people openly run no no no now it's empowered individuals what it presents
[18:09.400 --> 18:13.160]  he said the council on fine relations in Canada a couple years ago we're gonna
[18:13.160 --> 18:16.640]  play the clip coming up he said the whole world is awakening politically for
[18:16.640 --> 18:21.640]  the first time in history it's over for the elite we cannot do this it's cheaper
[18:21.640 --> 18:25.440]  to kill a million people than to use propaganda to control them and he went
[18:25.440 --> 18:30.080]  on to say that word-for-word in his book that came out last year so now
[18:30.080 --> 18:35.120]  rosinckis at the top of the food chain when it comes to actual planners he
[18:35.120 --> 18:38.600]  shaped our world more the last 40 years than probably anybody else the elite
[18:38.600 --> 18:44.400]  have adopted his particular stratagem and strategies in this overall program so
[18:44.400 --> 18:49.120]  we better study the people that run things omen is is an acolyte of this guy
[18:49.120 --> 18:53.200]  and is implementing the same plan he developed shock and awe current
[18:53.200 --> 18:58.960]  strategies for a new world order and he's saying we need to kill empowered
[18:58.960 --> 19:05.760]  individuals we need to kill people that are criticizing the state he says in
[19:05.760 --> 19:10.760]  here those that are discrediting and the he goes on to say the new world order is
[19:10.760 --> 19:16.400]  failing in its governance you are going to fail you can't kill us all do you
[19:16.400 --> 19:20.480]  understand that and we're identifying you but these people are so arrogant and
[19:20.480 --> 19:26.360]  so open and he goes on to say we need an extraordinary crisis to be able to do
[19:26.360 --> 19:31.040]  this I'm telling you they're going to stage stuff or wind up terrorists to do
[19:31.040 --> 19:33.760]  it they're going to blame it on the patriots and they're going to come
[19:33.760 --> 19:37.760]  after us I'm telling you that's the only move they've got I'm telling you get
[19:37.760 --> 19:42.960]  ready and if we weren't here hammering them to hell and exposing the boss and
[19:42.960 --> 19:46.440]  bombing as it happened all the rest of it they would have already carried out

[25:02.400 --> 25:08.960]  part of the next I cannot state to you how big a deal this is when you read
[25:08.960 --> 25:16.040]  what Brzezinski has to say and you read what other globalists are saying it is
[25:16.040 --> 25:23.120]  simply amazing that they are openly saying hey the war on terror is not
[25:23.120 --> 25:26.520]  really what we're worried about now it's the war on quote empowered
[25:26.520 --> 25:31.520]  individuals and non-state actors so he says we got to take out people like
[25:31.520 --> 25:37.240]  Snowden but also empowered individuals I have the quotes here there why the
[25:37.240 --> 25:40.760]  state is failing because we won't just give up all our rights and be slaves to
[25:40.760 --> 25:46.080]  these guys and it just shows how disconnected from reality are that
[25:46.080 --> 25:49.240]  we're just gonna roll over just because they've gotten the majority of people to
[25:49.240 --> 25:53.400]  roll over into a trance watching television and all the rest of it not
[25:53.400 --> 25:57.600]  everyone has slipped into unconsciousness most people that I know are
[25:57.600 --> 26:02.060]  waking up and they're waking up fast they're waking up to more and more every
[26:02.060 --> 26:07.520]  minute but this story should be red link to the top on info wars.com and quite
[26:07.520 --> 26:11.720]  frankly Paul's a better writer than I am a better researcher but but I would have
[26:11.720 --> 26:18.200]  the headline saying you know top government strategist take out empowered
[26:18.200 --> 26:25.080]  individuals I mean this is a declaration of war and I love how they're always on
[26:25.080 --> 26:29.040]  the news going let's kill Snowden he's a traitor no the people funding Al Qaeda
[26:29.040 --> 26:33.000]  through our government or traders the people spying on the Tea Party and gun
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.200]  owners and Christian groups and trying to take their 501c3 you're the
[26:37.200 --> 26:40.560]  authoritarians and you know you are that's the thing they know they're
[26:40.560 --> 26:46.320]  taking over this is a gang takeover this is a foreign spy corporate espionage
[26:46.320 --> 26:51.600]  infiltration but that isn't rhetoric these are people in the Pentagon
[26:51.600 --> 26:55.600]  teaching that the Bill of Rights is bad because it stands in the way of their
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.540]  criminal operations and this is the 53rd anniversary of Eisenhower's farewell
[27:00.540 --> 27:08.040]  address in 1961 I'm going to play the entire 15 minute address at the bottom
[27:08.040 --> 27:11.640]  of the next hour but I'm gonna play later in this hour the clip where he says
[27:11.640 --> 27:17.840]  we're in danger of a technocratic elite that controls the military industrial
[27:17.840 --> 27:21.320]  complex totally taking over our civilization and creating a breakaway
[27:21.320 --> 27:25.740]  society that's because he was brought in on the plans and didn't like him he
[27:25.740 --> 27:30.960]  refused to stage false flags to start a war with Russia he refused Operation
[27:30.960 --> 27:36.160]  Northwood before Kennedy did so this is the real world okay we've been seized
[27:36.160 --> 27:40.040]  by criminals they're illegitimate they're in a race to impoverish us and
[27:40.040 --> 27:44.080]  break us politically to complete our journey into slavery where that one of
[27:44.080 --> 27:48.440]  the only countries that hadn't been disarmed they're coming we're the enemy
[27:48.440 --> 27:54.080]  foreign globalists are occupying us face the facts now Paul Watson we got two
[27:54.080 --> 27:56.640]  minutes before break you're gonna come back and expand and we're gonna read
[27:56.640 --> 28:01.840]  some of these clips of these quotes and then play some clips of Brzezinski and
[28:01.840 --> 28:05.920]  others saying basically the same thing but this is serious when Brzezinski says
[28:05.920 --> 28:10.200]  it's cheaper to kill a million people than to convince them now no one believes
[28:10.200 --> 28:15.760]  us time to start killing and this guy is basically saying the same thing well
[28:15.760 --> 28:20.480]  this is a trend Alex that we've been tracking since around 2010 when
[28:20.480 --> 28:24.840]  Brzezinski gave that speech to the CFR where he said that you know there's a
[28:24.840 --> 28:30.080]  global political awakening taking taking place the infighting is amongst the
[28:30.080 --> 28:35.760]  elite because we've got people on the inside who are on our side and now this
[28:35.760 --> 28:39.960]  article comes out of the Atlantic Council which if you look into the
[28:39.960 --> 28:44.360]  background of that group it's basically a revolving door to the Obama
[28:44.360 --> 28:50.000]  administration James L. Jones was the former chairman he stepped down to become
[28:50.000 --> 28:56.360]  Obama's national security advisor numerous other major players in the
[28:56.360 --> 29:01.200]  Obama administration Susan Rice Richard Holbrook Chuck Hagel current defense
[29:01.200 --> 29:07.160]  secretary were were a part or are still a part of this think tank the Atlantic
[29:07.160 --> 29:11.560]  Council and this article came out a few months ago but it basically got no
[29:11.560 --> 29:15.960]  attention whatsoever and as he said it's on a similar theme to the Brzezinski
[29:15.960 --> 29:20.240]  speech he basically says that and this is the author of shock and awe the
[29:20.240 --> 29:24.240]  military doctorate doctrine who's writing this article and he basically says
[29:24.240 --> 29:29.520]  that we need a new extraordinary crisis to preserve the new world order
[29:29.520 --> 29:35.160]  because it's being completely undermined by non-state actors like Edward
[29:35.160 --> 29:39.800]  Snowden and he actually dismisses the threat to the new world order from
[29:39.800 --> 29:44.360]  superpowers like China and says that it's all coming from non-state actors
[29:44.360 --> 29:48.280]  and self-empowered individuals that's right it is the individual that the state
[29:48.280 --> 29:54.640]  is threatened by we're on the March the Empire is free will Alex Jones and the

[33:52.440 --> 33:56.600]  quote coming up in his book last year where he said it's easier to kill a
[33:56.600 --> 33:59.720]  million people now than to convince a million people you've got him a few
[33:59.720 --> 34:04.360]  years ago at the council on farm relations on C-SPAN saying that the
[34:04.360 --> 34:09.680]  state is losing people are awakening worldwide and then now you've got all
[34:09.680 --> 34:13.520]  these other globalists coming out including top technocrats that advise
[34:13.520 --> 34:19.280]  the security council at the UN that advise the national security council that
[34:19.280 --> 34:24.000]  actually runs this country that are setting up a COG continuity of
[34:24.000 --> 34:32.280]  government coup d'etat program against humanity and they are setting up this
[34:32.280 --> 34:35.960]  program and then using the threat of terrorism as the pretext to take our
[34:35.960 --> 34:42.240]  liberties and then the article up on info wars dot com think tank extraordinary
[34:42.240 --> 34:46.760]  crisis needed to preserve new world order that's a quote and and I read from
[34:46.760 --> 34:51.280]  Robert Shapiro advising Obama in the financial times of London yesterday I
[34:51.280 --> 34:55.920]  read that quote on on air where he said we need major terror attacks so we can
[34:55.920 --> 35:00.960]  take over that's how dumb they think you are in newspapers they admit they're
[35:00.960 --> 35:05.640]  using this to take over and pick winners and losers and spy on everyone and give
[35:05.640 --> 35:09.640]  the data to select corporations and Obama's gonna save us and getting rid of
[35:09.640 --> 35:13.680]  the borders and coming after our guns and the state saying our kids belong to
[35:13.680 --> 35:17.640]  them and teaching five-year-olds about homosexuality they shouldn't be teaching
[35:17.640 --> 35:22.680]  them about heterosexuality the state is a bunch of crazy people that want to be
[35:22.680 --> 35:26.480]  empowered to run our lives and I'm not saying everybody in the state is but the
[35:26.480 --> 35:30.720]  people that run the state apparatus and the media apparatus are very very
[35:30.720 --> 35:36.640]  dangerous anti humans engaged in major social engineering so Paul Watson joins
[35:36.640 --> 35:41.040]  us to read over this article and give us his take on it but here they are saying
[35:41.040 --> 35:44.640]  you know the good news is their programs in trouble people are waking up to them
[35:44.640 --> 35:49.040]  the bad news is they're saying we need to kill non-state actors like Edward
[35:49.040 --> 35:55.600]  Snowden we need to also take out we need to take out and get rid of eliminates
[35:55.600 --> 36:01.800]  the word empowered individuals who know the globalist or tyrants who were
[36:01.800 --> 36:06.120]  conscious who is empowered people that know what's going on and who are
[36:06.120 --> 36:10.760]  instinctively threatened by it and won't go along with it this shows we're in
[36:10.760 --> 36:16.080]  the fight this shows the huge effect that we can have this shows what we can
[36:16.080 --> 36:24.800]  do this shows the power of humanity but it also shows we're right there at the
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.560]  edge here we're in the fight we could win this but folks have to admit how
[36:29.560 --> 36:34.920]  much danger we're in that the global governance heads are saying the enemy is
[36:34.920 --> 36:39.000]  libertarians that's whatever Snowden is the enemy is empowered individuals the
[36:39.000 --> 36:44.160]  enemy is Thomas Jefferson the enemy is George Washington the enemy is 1776
[36:44.160 --> 36:47.840]  worldwide the enemy isn't communist China the globalists run and work with a
[36:47.840 --> 36:52.480]  bunch of you know fellow communists and killers and psychopaths and monopoly
[36:52.480 --> 36:57.240]  men the enemy isn't in North Korea it's not Germany it's not all the corrupt
[36:57.240 --> 37:01.160]  ruling elites they can all get together and meet and decide you know new
[37:01.160 --> 37:05.400]  criminal operations against humanity their enemy is the individual standing up
[37:05.400 --> 37:09.360]  and saying no and the individual linking up with other individuals and and
[37:09.360 --> 37:13.720]  collectively as individuals saying we recognize your illegitimate criminals
[37:13.720 --> 37:18.120]  we withdraw our consent we would draw our support you're not going to build
[37:18.120 --> 37:22.360]  your technocracy we're aware of it we're going to dismantle it you've
[37:22.360 --> 37:27.640]  declared war on us we declare survival on you we're not declaring war on you
[37:27.640 --> 37:32.120]  we're declaring that we aren't slaves we have inalienable rights we run up the
[37:32.120 --> 37:36.560]  flag of liberty and we do not submit we do not comply we are awake we are
[37:36.560 --> 37:41.440]  conscious you people are declaring war on yourselves you are mentally ill power
[37:41.440 --> 37:47.800]  drunk out of control playing God with your technologically as Eisenhower said
[37:47.800 --> 37:53.120]  and we are not going to put up with it anymore now let's go to Paul Watson Paul
[37:53.120 --> 37:59.480]  Watson break it down well Alex I see this as an incredibly positive development
[37:59.480 --> 38:03.560]  because you know in his editorial for the Atlantic Council
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.920]  Oldman states quote very few have taken no and fewer have acted on this
[38:08.920 --> 38:13.440]  realization the realization that empowered individuals are the major
[38:13.440 --> 38:20.160]  threat to the power elite quote information revolution and instantaneous
[38:20.160 --> 38:24.520]  global communications that's what he identifies as the major threat he's
[38:24.520 --> 38:28.280]  talking about the internet of course Hillary Clinton a couple of years ago
[38:28.280 --> 38:33.240]  said that quote we're losing the info war that's what it's all about the info
[38:33.240 --> 38:37.480]  war they don't even realize that they're losing it you know these guys in these
[38:37.480 --> 38:43.000]  think tanks are in their 60s and 70s they're years and years behind suddenly
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.640]  they're starting to realize that they're losing the ideological battle and it's
[38:47.640 --> 38:52.640]  starting to cost them because as I said before people on the inside and out on
[38:52.640 --> 38:58.000]  our side you know Edward Snowden Bradley Manning the entire collective
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.680]  activist organizations that have sprung off from them we're winning the
[39:02.680 --> 39:05.960]  information war and they're in a blind panic because it's undermining their
[39:05.960 --> 39:10.440]  system which is emphasized by what happened last year with Syria when you
[39:10.440 --> 39:14.880]  know the military generals went to Obama and basically basically said what the
[39:14.880 --> 39:19.240]  hell are you doing this is not going to wash and it prevented that attack so the
[39:19.240 --> 39:24.480]  info war which that they now lament is actually having a very real direct
[39:24.480 --> 39:28.520]  effect on their actions and it's preventing them from carrying through
[39:28.520 --> 39:34.200]  this quote New World Order which they identify in this article and they
[39:34.200 --> 39:38.040]  define the New World Order if you read their other writings on the Atlantic
[39:38.040 --> 39:43.200]  Council website which again is a major think tank NATO heads have heralded it
[39:43.200 --> 39:47.880]  as hugely influential it's a revolving door to the Obama administration they
[39:47.880 --> 39:52.800]  define the New World Order as a global technocracy run by basically corporate
[39:52.800 --> 39:58.400]  fascism the fusion of big government and big business and Scowcroft particularly
[39:58.400 --> 40:04.480]  talks about their ultimate agenda being a transhumanist singularity that will
[40:04.480 --> 40:10.040]  replace individuality so that's how they plan on eliminating self-empowered
[40:10.040 --> 40:14.640]  individuals by moving towards this transhumanism so now they're in a blind
[40:14.640 --> 40:19.280]  panic that people have suddenly started to wake up and realize that this is what's
[40:19.280 --> 40:24.720]  been going on all along they're years and years behind so now they're saying well
[40:24.720 --> 40:29.240]  we need a new crisis a new 9-11 style event we know where we heard that before
[40:29.240 --> 40:35.280]  project for a new American Century in 1997 to get this all back on track to
[40:35.280 --> 40:41.160]  re-enrich the state with carte blanche power to do what it likes for the
[40:41.160 --> 40:47.280]  president to have 80 90% approval ratings like Bush had after 9-11 to get this
[40:47.280 --> 40:51.880]  executive dictatorship through so now they're starting to lament it and
[40:51.880 --> 40:56.640]  starting to realize that they may need to stage certain crises to get it all
[40:56.640 --> 40:59.880]  back on track let's be clear the council on foreign relations heart
[40:59.880 --> 41:05.320]  rudman committee 10 months before 9-11 issued a report calling for giant
[41:05.320 --> 41:10.680]  catalyzing events just as the PNAC report 12 months before 9-11 called for a
[41:10.680 --> 41:15.400]  catalyzing Pearl Harbor event with 3,000 dead incredible how they could say
[41:15.400 --> 41:19.360]  3,000 dead and that's what died unbelievable and then it magically
[41:19.360 --> 41:23.400]  happens they are now making the announcement across the board to their
[41:23.400 --> 41:28.880]  operatives hitting the panic switch to begin the new false flag and you see him
[41:28.880 --> 41:32.400]  segwaying saying it's not al-qaeda now in his quotes we're gonna read some of
[41:32.400 --> 41:38.880]  these now it's domestic empowered individuals so as I've said folks in the
[41:38.880 --> 41:42.720]  last few years you can see all the scripting in the TV the movies preparing
[41:42.720 --> 41:47.080]  the public where the militia releases a bio weapon the militia nukes a city
[41:47.080 --> 41:52.520]  working with al-qaeda totally ridiculous saying the tea party works with al-qaeda
[41:52.520 --> 41:57.520]  in Pentagon training manuals where they invade North Carolina that got leaked
[41:57.520 --> 42:00.880]  last year and people say well that doesn't make sense the tea parties
[42:00.880 --> 42:06.040]  Islamophobic it doesn't matter they will nuke a city and they will have some
[42:06.040 --> 42:09.960]  drugged-up militia guy with a drugged-up al-qaeda guy and they'll who've been
[42:09.960 --> 42:14.360]  electro shocked and only know who they are to get up on TV and say yeah I did
[42:14.360 --> 42:18.680]  it these guys have probably been you know six months in a torture dungeon then
[42:18.680 --> 42:22.040]  they'll later kill them bring out body doubles I mean that's the kind of stuff
[42:22.040 --> 42:26.280]  they do in these operations they will nuke a city they will release a bio
[42:26.280 --> 42:30.440]  weapon I'm telling you they will do one of those two things or they will nerve
[42:30.440 --> 42:36.000]  gas a football game I'm telling you something big in fact I think to really
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.720]  bring us to our knees I think they're gonna nuke a city I mean I just cannot
[42:39.720 --> 42:43.400]  believe I'm on air talking about this I cannot believe it's this real I cannot
[42:43.400 --> 42:46.160]  believe I'm not even afraid of being killed and I'm not saying I'm a hero
[42:46.160 --> 42:49.800]  here folks I'm just telling you you better know nobody else gets it like we
[42:49.800 --> 42:53.520]  do nobody else will hardcore go up against the enemy and I hope you
[42:53.520 --> 42:57.120]  realize as listeners this shows we're in the game the fact that so many people
[42:57.120 --> 43:00.520]  in the military are awake the fact that so many media people behind the scenes
[43:00.520 --> 43:03.440]  are awake the fact that more and more media people in the mainstream are
[43:03.440 --> 43:08.560]  leaking what they can telling me off record hey I've been sent here by you
[43:08.560 --> 43:12.400]  know AP or Reuters to do a hit piece on you but I'm not going to I've been sent
[43:12.400 --> 43:16.160]  here by hey we all know what's going on you know the revolution's coming it's
[43:16.160 --> 43:20.360]  all gonna come down they know behind the scenes they've lost the military they're
[43:20.360 --> 43:23.760]  losing the media they're losing conservatives they're losing liberals
[43:23.760 --> 43:27.720]  and they want us all in fight they may stage a race war or something I don't
[43:27.720 --> 43:31.920]  know but I don't think that's enough for them they are in a desperate situation
[43:31.920 --> 43:36.120]  if you read his quotes on info wars dot com right now in this article he says
[43:36.120 --> 43:40.680]  the new world order is done global governance is failing if they don't
[43:40.680 --> 43:46.120]  have a giant crisis like a new war or a terror attack and the Chinese behind the
[43:46.120 --> 43:50.360]  scenes are working with these people the Chinese chikoms they may let them attack
[43:50.360 --> 43:54.280]  that Philippine island or one of those other islands off Japan as the Chinese
[43:54.280 --> 43:59.360]  say they're getting ready to do and even have a limited exchange between ships
[43:59.360 --> 44:03.960]  and have a real war but not nuke each other and then have a big fake peace deal
[44:03.960 --> 44:08.600]  that's the governments have done this I've read stuff from 600 years ago 700
[44:08.600 --> 44:14.000]  years ago where you'd have 50 year 20 year 100 year wars between France and
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.160]  England and they'd be you know the the British royalty was really at that time
[44:18.160 --> 44:22.920]  Norman Viking slash French and they would say I'm having uprisings cousin to
[44:22.920 --> 44:27.080]  the other king we're gonna invade at Brittany again and then you let us have
[44:27.080 --> 44:30.960]  Samaria then we'll let you invade we need to kill off some peasants and and
[44:30.960 --> 44:36.160]  cause a distraction knowing the uprisings in England and France would
[44:36.160 --> 44:40.200]  stop if they could get each other fighting so these were hereditary
[44:40.200 --> 44:44.720]  cousins and these are public letters now many of these are famous you can pull
[44:44.720 --> 44:49.160]  them up they're online doing this so they're making deals with China I believe
[44:49.160 --> 44:54.040]  to have a limited staged police action war which could get out of hand quite
[44:54.040 --> 44:57.920]  easily the war with Russia is real from everything I've seen yeah the move in
[44:57.920 --> 45:01.320]  the missiles in trying to destabilize Russia trying to do all that stuff but
[45:01.320 --> 45:05.000]  I'm telling you that could be the false flag it could be a nuke going off and
[45:05.000 --> 45:10.680]  that's why I'm so concerned because they're losing the info war in their
[45:10.680 --> 45:15.640]  own words we are absolutely turbo charging at every level over the enemy
[45:15.640 --> 45:19.200]  right now we're now getting into their main command bases if you would to use
[45:19.200 --> 45:23.240]  this in a two-dimensional classical battlefield scenario we are about to
[45:23.240 --> 45:27.800]  route their general staff we're about to take out the command structure we are
[45:27.800 --> 45:33.400]  engaged in an information war you know during the Cold War we did a great job
[45:33.400 --> 45:37.560]  in getting America's message out after the Berlin Wall fell we said okay fine
[45:37.560 --> 45:42.360]  enough of that you know we've done it we're done and unfortunately we are
[45:42.360 --> 45:47.560]  paying a big price for it and our our private media cannot fill that there you
[45:47.560 --> 45:50.920]  know so now what are they doing they're coming out with fake foundation
[45:50.920 --> 45:53.960]  alternative media they're activating their operatives and alternative media
[45:53.960 --> 45:58.160]  to start infighting and lies you're going to see all hell breakless before
[45:58.160 --> 46:02.600]  they physically kill me they will plant stories make stuff up you name it they'll
[46:02.600 --> 46:06.320]  do it to other people but we now have the moral high ground and we have so
[46:06.320 --> 46:13.160]  many people in the FBI NSA CIA Defense Intelligence Marine Corps Army Air Force
[46:13.160 --> 46:17.680]  private corporations our people are everywhere when they stage an underwear
[46:17.680 --> 46:22.560]  bombing we within two days have the lawyer on who saw it all staged and
[46:22.560 --> 46:29.040]  then later it all comes out the CIA ran it we have humid organic true operatives
[46:29.040 --> 46:35.320]  that are the organic battle response of a free nation in our forebears worldwide
[46:35.320 --> 46:39.600]  not just in America there is an organic autoimmune response to a takeover like
[46:39.600 --> 46:45.440]  this we are the our organic military cultural response we are in a war
[46:45.440 --> 46:50.400]  ladies and gentlemen this is it and we are literally in a battle with these
[46:50.400 --> 46:54.800]  guys and we're all bleeding but we're in the fight we're getting the initiative
[46:54.800 --> 47:00.000]  the enemy is losing strength they've got wounds all over them we're about to win
[47:00.000 --> 47:05.280]  and I'm telling you I'm telling you they're gonna pull out all the stops
[47:05.280 --> 47:10.400]  because we've already begun to one to win that now Watson I'm ranting but I
[47:10.400 --> 47:13.640]  just played that clip we got a brzezinski clip coming up but when I read
[47:13.640 --> 47:17.440]  these these quotes this morning and I went and found some C-span footage of
[47:17.440 --> 47:21.600]  him saying similar things I mean it is chilling why do you think they operate
[47:21.600 --> 47:27.000]  with it with like a thinly veiled Bible page thick veil of not being obvious
[47:27.000 --> 47:31.080]  that they're gonna stage stuff I mean is that to normalize it in front of the
[47:31.080 --> 47:35.560]  the ruling class and all the minions so they feel confident in the criminal
[47:35.560 --> 47:40.240]  actions that that they would openly say stuff like this in major public journals
[47:40.240 --> 47:43.960]  and they're all saying it in unison now I mean why do you think they're so
[47:43.960 --> 47:49.000]  public about it well because they own the media Alex and they can rely on the
[47:49.000 --> 47:54.880]  mass media not to cover it and they know that 99.9% of the American people are
[47:54.880 --> 47:59.560]  not going to read think tank websites where they openly talk about this stuff
[47:59.560 --> 48:05.040]  but more and more people are which is why they're starting to panic about it you
[48:05.040 --> 48:10.240]  know the political class needs to create and maintain this irrational world it's
[48:10.240 --> 48:16.360]  like what the Saxo CEO talked about last week so they need to stage crises to
[48:16.360 --> 48:19.880]  maintain that irrational world because they only remain relevant in an
[48:19.880 --> 48:25.040]  irrational world and using that irrationality they can then blame us for
[48:25.040 --> 48:29.360]  the terror attack which is apparently coming because we opposed NSA
[48:29.360 --> 48:33.640]  surveillance and that was necessary to prevent the terror attack you just you
[48:33.640 --> 48:39.440]  know played Hillary Clinton claiming victory for the Cold War and Angela
[48:39.440 --> 48:44.520]  Merkel the German Chancellor who had her mobile phone spied on by the NSA
[48:44.520 --> 48:50.040]  compared the NSA to the Stasi who were of course on the opposite side in the
[48:50.040 --> 48:55.480]  Cold War and now Obama today I'm just reading says that the United States is
[48:55.480 --> 49:01.160]  not spying on ordinary people this applies to foreign leaders as well again
[49:01.160 --> 49:06.320]  that's a blatant lie it came out that they were spying on Angela Merkel's
[49:06.320 --> 49:10.800]  cell phone and he says you know these are your friends and neighbors well yeah
[49:10.800 --> 49:15.080]  they are friends and neighbors that are spying on quote love interests that came
[49:15.080 --> 49:18.800]  out in the Wall Street Journal they actually have a name for it called love
[49:18.800 --> 49:25.320]  int where these NSA analysts go in and read their ex-girlfriend's email to see
[49:25.320 --> 49:29.840]  what they're doing in the private life so lie piled upon lie upon lie and they
[49:29.840 --> 49:33.800]  don't care anymore they're just brazenly lying in public because again they
[49:33.800 --> 49:36.880]  think they insult around our intelligence and thinking the American
[49:36.880 --> 49:40.080]  people are stupid but they're going to have this crisis and they're going to
[49:40.080 --> 49:44.520]  blame it on people who opposed NSA surveillance and they say they say the
[49:44.520 --> 49:49.360]  threat is no longer foreign terrorist it is empowered individuals that need to
[49:49.360 --> 49:53.160]  be eliminated so they're going to stage a domestic attack and blame it on the
[49:53.160 --> 49:56.360]  Liberty Movement because we are the resistance and they say we're a bigger
[49:56.360 --> 50:01.920]  threat than China and you know what we are because the globalist help run
[50:01.920 --> 50:07.200]  China the globalists are in bed without other criminal group and then Obama says
[50:07.200 --> 50:10.880]  if only you'd have let us collect this metadata without complaining we'd have

[54:05.600 --> 54:22.600]  radio network
[54:22.600 --> 54:27.440]  it was easier to control and million people literally it was easier to
[54:27.440 --> 54:35.440]  control a million people then physically to kill a million people today it is
[54:35.440 --> 54:42.000]  infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people
[54:42.000 --> 54:48.040]  it's easier to kill than to control and that's now the decision they've made he
[54:48.040 --> 54:51.840]  also basically said that in his book last year strategic vision America and
[54:51.840 --> 54:55.120]  the crisis of global power and in the book I went and bought it and read it
[54:55.120 --> 54:58.920]  he he says the patriot movement worldwide of just people that want to be
[54:58.920 --> 55:03.640]  free are the enemy so so this is a organized governmental system that says
[55:03.640 --> 55:09.760]  quote empowered individuals are the enemy they've already taken over national
[55:09.760 --> 55:13.120]  sovereignty worldwide they're mopping up a few countries now it's the
[55:13.120 --> 55:18.120]  individual and then you look at who runs this and you know the average people
[55:18.120 --> 55:21.240]  out there are good or moral or hard-working there's so many good
[55:21.240 --> 55:25.240]  professionals in this country doctors lawyers police officers school teachers
[55:25.240 --> 55:31.040]  factory owners business people I mean the artist I mean the list goes on and
[55:31.040 --> 55:36.200]  on service folks there's so many good people but we just seed control to guys
[55:36.200 --> 55:39.760]  in suits that land in helicopters and have red carpets because you know they're
[55:39.760 --> 55:45.800]  on red carpets they must be good guys well president Eisenhower 53 years ago
[55:45.800 --> 55:50.600]  today said beware the technological critic technological elite getting
[55:50.600 --> 55:53.880]  control and we're gonna play that entire speech coming up at the bottom of the
[55:53.880 --> 55:57.920]  hour I'm gonna be talking over it adding points so it's very very important
[55:57.920 --> 56:01.520]  to understand that but this is so huge folks you should go read the quotes for
[56:01.520 --> 56:06.440]  yourself line for wars.com I know it's not you know the latest Justin Bieber
[56:06.440 --> 56:09.960]  stuff if you're a new listener but this is a guy that advises the National
[56:09.960 --> 56:16.720]  Security Council that runs things that are busy purging a military preparing
[56:16.720 --> 56:20.120]  for war domestically their own training manuals preparing for trees and
[56:20.120 --> 56:24.840]  preparing for hot coup preparing for a purge of the American people preparing
[56:24.840 --> 56:29.680]  for civil war I mean we're talking about just hellish stuff when they finally
[56:29.680 --> 56:33.640]  dropped the hammer and implode the economy completely they're gonna stage
[56:33.640 --> 56:36.560]  terror attacks they're gonna blame it on us they're gonna come after anybody
[56:36.560 --> 56:40.240]  that criticizes them and folks if you roll over to them they win I mean these
[56:40.240 --> 56:45.720]  people are so bad and they lie to you openly like Obama just did for an hour
[56:45.720 --> 56:55.320]  and Oldman again for the Atlantic Council he says without an extraordinary
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.320]  crisis little is likely to be done to reverse the limit reverse or limit the
[57:00.320 --> 57:04.640]  damage imposed by failed or failing governance writes Oldman implying with
[57:04.640 --> 57:08.320]  only another 9-11 style cataclysm will enable the state to research dominance
[57:08.320 --> 57:12.000]  while containing reducing and eliminating the dangers posed by newly
[57:12.000 --> 57:16.400]  empowered non-state actors he goes on to say this is the only way to secure a
[57:16.400 --> 57:22.400]  new world order and that the quote must be done and then he goes on to say we
[57:22.400 --> 57:27.880]  must also eliminate empowered individuals I mean Watson I can't think of a
[57:27.880 --> 57:33.760]  more creepy open declaration of war I mean these people indict themselves
[57:33.760 --> 57:38.720]  publicly Watson other key points well we've seen the move to demonize
[57:38.720 --> 57:43.520]  patriots to terrorists but what's amazing now is that this has just gone up on
[57:43.520 --> 57:49.280]  info wars.com Obama is now associating himself with the founding fathers and
[57:49.280 --> 57:54.360]  saying that people who oppose NSA surveillance are basically anti-American
[57:54.360 --> 57:59.160]  and anti-patriotic he said quote at the dawn of our republic a small secret
[57:59.160 --> 58:02.200]  surveillance committee born out of the Sons of Liberty was established in
[58:02.200 --> 58:06.600]  Boston the groups members included Paul Revere and at night they would patrol
[58:06.600 --> 58:09.960]  the streets reporting back any signs that the British were preparing raids
[58:09.960 --> 58:15.240]  against America's early patriots I think I woke up in the twilight zone he's
[58:15.240 --> 58:21.320]  actually comparing warrantless mass NSA surveillance of innocent American
[58:21.320 --> 58:27.400]  people to the founding fathers of America and what they did yeah they were
[58:27.400 --> 58:33.200]  spying on an invading occupying army of their fellow countrymen because they
[58:33.200 --> 58:38.080]  declared a new country oh this is unbelievable stay there I got to talk
[58:38.080 --> 58:48.560]  more about this thank you the article just went up on info wars.com visit GCN live.com.com today

[58:54.560 --> 58:59.840]  entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is
[58:59.840 --> 59:04.800]  to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the
[59:04.800 --> 59:08.120]  global takeover that's why we've assembled the most vital and important

[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:12.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:21.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:32.560]  I cannot believe it it just went up on info wars.com by Steve Watson Paul
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:42.640]  Watson's brother absolutely incredible to see this Obama justifies NSA spying
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:48.480]  Paul Revere did it first yeah military spying on military movements not peeping
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:52.600]  through the windows or stealing the mail of all the colonists argues US is
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.720]  always offended freedom through surveillance but you're not defending
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:02.000]  freedom you're butchering the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution absolutely
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  off the charts insane Watson I've been ranting here you got four minutes in the
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.720]  short segment you've got the floor to talk more about the incredible news that
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.440]  we've been breaking where top Atlantic Council advisors the National Security
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.440]  Council call for huge catalyzing terror attacks in America as a pretext to go
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.400]  after the Liberty Movement and quote empowered individuals well yeah just
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.960]  done that last point I mean Rand Paul immediately came out and said Paul
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.240]  Revere was warning us that the British were coming he wasn't warning us that
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:38.320]  the Americans were coming and even the Washington Post completely ripped it
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.440]  apart saying if the British Redcoats had access to the type of metadata and
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.640]  processing power the NSA does today Revere probably would have been caught
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.520]  before he could go on his legendary midnight ride indeed Revere would have
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:56.160]  been outed as a terrorist so even the Washington Post is completely
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.000]  eviscerating this ludicrous one I'm saying everyone's realizing they're a
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.120]  bunch of lying crooks who are gonna wreck everything people are not gonna
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.560]  play ball with us anymore that's what I'm saying and that's why they're gonna
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.240]  nuke a major city and blame it on us Paul I'm telling you it's the only move
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:13.200]  they've got or start war or something what do you think they're gonna do I
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:18.000]  think the buildup of Russia and China which we've been closely tracking over
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.480]  the past three to six months definitely indicates that there's some kind of
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:28.160]  conflict two or three years down the road I mean China has been bellicose in
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.280]  its threats they actually put out a map of US major US cities saying what the
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:39.480]  effect would be if each one was nuked by their PLA submarine force they've been
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.360]  talking about invading islands China just came out with their first major
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:51.960]  aircraft carrier they put out a an image to go along with their Luna Rover
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:57.560]  program which depicted a mushroom cloud over Europe and this is all while
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.040]  they're in their own state media saying about how they could attack America and
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.080]  win a war and a lot of the Chinese media is talking about when this war is gonna
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:09.680]  take place and the fact that China is gonna win it because America is
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.720]  basically going the way of Russia it's collapsing into complete nothingness and
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:20.080]  that China is the the emerging military power so it seems you know that's the way
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:25.760]  we're heading also they've got this ace card of the catalyzing event which you
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.720]  talked about but I think the the positive thing is the fact that the
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:35.240]  political class which as I said before relies on creating an irrational world
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:42.240]  through these manufactured false flags and crises is shrinking because more and
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:47.600]  more people on the inside as proven by the derailment of the attack on Syria
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.520]  last year more and more people on the inside are on our side and they're
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:57.360]  fighting back against this so these 67-year-old people that staff these
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:02.640]  think tanks are increasingly becoming irrelevant they don't even understand the
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:07.320]  power the massive power of global communications and the internet to
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.360]  derail their agenda they're only just starting to understand the true threat
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.960]  that that poses which is of course outlined in this article that we're
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.320]  focusing on today and basically it's too late for them it's game over but as you
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:26.040]  said they they do have the ace card of these extraordinary crises that they
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:30.520]  can create in an effort to re-energize popular support for big
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:35.960]  government and basically totalitarianism Paul I really appreciate your time but
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:39.320]  I want to do five more minutes with you on what you think they're going to pull
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.000]  I really want to give you the floor when we come back for five minutes and then
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.880]  I'm gonna get into all the other news and open the phones up our reporters

[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.640]  after our guns shutting down our industry he's got his top advisor up on
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:20.040]  info wars.com saying only an extraordinary crisis can save their new
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.000]  world order and that they need to go after empowered individuals and
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:32.160]  eliminate them that that that that individuals are the enemy and we're
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.560]  going back to Paul Watson here to talk about this but I wanted to play because
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:40.160]  it's the 53rd anniversary of his farewell address as the president
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:46.240]  general Eisenhower president Eisenhower warning of a technological elite in
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:50.640]  control of a military industrial complex and how they were the main threat to
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.960]  America and how America would be discredited worldwide and destroyed if
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.880]  we let this group continue to take over because this group had come to him and
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.040]  said let's bomb US cities and take over American liberty and set up a
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:08.560]  dictatorship with you at the head of it and have war with Russia and Eisenhower
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:14.560]  said you're fired. The adjuncts of those guys came to Kennedy and said do it he
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:18.120]  said you're fired they said we're gonna blow your head off and they took over
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:23.120]  and they've been in control ever since and they built all of this you're seeing
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:29.400]  and they brag they built this and they brag they stage terror attacks. The
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:33.320]  PNAC which is written by people that were protogees of LL Limnitzer that wrote
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:39.440]  the Northwoods plan. The protogees of that guy Rumsfeld Nuthers wrote that
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.600]  and they said we need a catalyzing Pearl Harbor giant event to take over
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:49.280]  Central Asia and and Brzezinski wrote the book on that the grand chessboard I
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.040]  mean I've read all their books they admitted it's like a confession that's
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:58.720]  what's so frustrating and they've been so arrogant criminals always brag that
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.620]  now good people in the government CIA FBI military you name it the government
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:07.520]  drug dealing by the DEA is coming out from the top the money laundering by
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.920]  the big banks they run it all the only real drug war is against people they
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:15.080]  don't control that's a small minority the drug war is to keep prices up the
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:18.360]  drug war is to keep it illegal the drug war is to launder the money and to
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:23.320]  control competition people are waking up to that and Brzezinski came out I
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.840]  played the clip earlier and he said look we just need to kill it's easier to kill
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.600]  a million people now than to convince them the world is awake and staring I'm
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.200]  gonna play the full clip coming up but but here is Eisenhower next hour I'll
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.560]  play the full 15 minute farewell address and then make comments throughout it but
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.880]  but but here is some of the meat of it the essence of it we must also be alert
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:52.160]  to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:59.280]  captive of a scientific technological elite and the councils of government we
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:04.800]  must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:11.680]  unsought by the military industrial complex there you go and he had just
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.040]  fired a whole bunch of people because they came to him and said everybody
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:19.920]  loves you this has come out by the way you ought to try to stay on the way to
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:25.600]  do it is to blow up bases and blow up movie theaters and shoot people on the
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.600]  street and blame it on domestic groups working with communists and we can take
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:37.760]  over and he said you know what you're fired and the memoirs he alluded to it
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.480]  but more came out later he didn't want to shake up the country he didn't come out
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:45.560]  against it all because he didn't want to destroy confidence in government it's
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:51.400]  always that same story Eisenhower was not a bad guy and he was like he's more
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:55.000]  old-fashioned he wasn't perfect by any stretch and he's like no we're not gonna
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.760]  create a dictatorship I don't want to be a dictator he's like George Washington
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:03.520]  they came to him and said be king be dictator they the people love you and
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:09.200]  he said no America has been saved over and over again by presidents that
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.680]  refuse the dictatorship Smedley Butler two-time congressional Medal of Honor
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:19.520]  winner set to be the commandant of the Marine Corps a Marine major general and
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:23.200]  they came to him and said we're gonna stage a coup d'etat with 500,000 men
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.720]  you're gonna lead and we're gonna merge with the fascist and he said you know
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.680]  what he'd overthrown a bunch of countries that was his job as as a
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:35.600]  Marine he said no and then he blew the whistle on him to the McCormick-Dickstein
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.000]  Committee and this isn't taught in schools folks we almost never had World
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.320]  War two because it wasn't like the Nazis were going to take over there were a
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.120]  lot of people that had taught Germany everything it knew that was the Nuremberg
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:52.200]  defense was the Cold Springs Harbor labs had set up the Kaiser Wilhelm
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:57.600]  Institute with the Rockefeller money Hitler been financed by the the
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:04.840]  Harriman's and others here in the US they were competing a leech and basically
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:09.080]  the liberal elite who weren't really liberal they adopted the fascist Nazi
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:14.080]  model but with a quote liberal progressive icing and that's their
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.840]  program and that's their dominant operation here and so they've used
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:22.360]  terrorism COG to set up this illegitimate criminal government separate
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:27.200]  from the Constitution and now they're absorbing the old original Republic now
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.520]  going back to Paul Watson till we go to break I want to give you the floor Watson
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:35.160]  to talk about the state of the world Watson editor of prisonplanet.com
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:43.560]  roving editor of mfallwars.com what is the bottom line here with what you see
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:48.480]  and and the pieces on the chessboard and where things are going and what are
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:53.560]  you and your gut think they're getting ready your planning to do the bottom
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:59.480]  line Alex is that the elite knows that not only is this global revolution
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:03.720]  restoration insurrection call it what you want gonna happen it's already
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:09.360]  unfolding I'm looking at a picture of activists in Paris France who hired a
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:16.320]  giant 18-wheeler truck to dump horse manure in front of the National Assembly
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:22.000]  in Paris France I'm looking at you know Italy with a pitchfork movement again
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.560]  uniting left and right with even the Italian president now warning of violent
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:33.120]  unrest in 2014 this is unfolding it's not only coming it's unfolding right now
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:39.240]  so the the the concern of the global elite is to try and infiltrate those
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:45.000]  movements and use them to enrich the state with more power by pretending that
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.880]  the problem is a lack of collectivism within government they're trying to you
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:53.960]  know polarize it into that left-right issue because both left and right
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:58.880]  especially in Europe are joining together in places like France and Italy
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.920]  in Italy you've got the student movement and the farmers who have joined
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:07.160]  together with this pitchfork revolt and the elite will need to infiltrate that
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:12.640]  in order to derail it I think they're gonna go with the the iron-rand blueprint
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:18.720]  Atlas shrugged where they basically try and completely wreck the economy wreck
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:25.240]  human ingenuity and entrepreneurship and you know grandstand as if the problem
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:31.160]  is a lack of power concentrated within the state so people then beg for more
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:37.280]  centralization of power to solve the very problems that they created which is
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:43.040]  exactly what the Saxo Bank CEO warned of last week so they're gonna keep on
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:47.400]  they're gonna keep on making these mistakes in the economy which make
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:52.760]  people poorer and poorer and say that the only solution is more power in the
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.960]  hands of the state which of course as we know is not some utopian idea of
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:03.040]  socialism it's corporate fascism because the the same big business as the
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.640]  oversee that system work hand-in-hand with the government it's a revolving door
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:12.420]  they get the special exemptions of special favors in America you've got the
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:17.200]  Obama administration shutting down the coal plants giving special waivers to
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:22.480]  general electric so they're gonna go with that totalitarianism but I mean did
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.600]  you hear Michelle's turning 50 I mean don't you want to celebrate that I mean
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.760]  that's what's important well that's the bread and circuses that they try and
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:34.320]  keep the 95% the rest of the population distracted with so they're gonna turn up
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.200]  that so bottom line where do you see it going because they can't help but steal
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.960]  everything with their crony system which destroys productivity so then they
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.160]  argue well it's a cosmology of a 21 when the truth is they're just a bunch of
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:49.000]  locusts but now we're going to be here exposing that they're the authors of it
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.280]  how does this end well they intend to use homeland security systems worldwide
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:58.240]  to suppress the population they're gonna they're gonna hope that we haven't
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:03.840]  remembered history but precisely because of the internet because now which no
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:08.440]  other generation ever before has had access to the entire history of the
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:13.000]  world all the information our fingertips now we do know our history and
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  they're not gonna be able to pull that off so in the end we're gonna win the
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.840]  human spirit human ingenuity is gonna win out and we're gonna move into a
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.400]  gradually more free world and a more prosperous world for everybody I agree
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:29.520]  and humanity is gonna split into two groups consciously it already has we'll
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.800]  have the TV heads that are still fed on by the predator groups and by the con
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:38.120]  artist and who don't even know what planet they're on versus a large minority
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:43.320]  of empowered enlightened people that are going to build our own systems that
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:48.680]  will then be so successful culturally without force we will then dominate and
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:54.840]  take over the world by pure virtue and by pure competition we will end up
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:19:01.000]  unseating the establishment and the problem is though they're going to try
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.480]  to use chemical and biological systems to suppress our free will in the battle
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:10.920]  towards that point but because they're so spiritually blind and don't see the
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:16.840]  fourth-dimensional aspects of this they're going to fail what exactly it's
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:20.240]  always gonna be a game of brinksmanship isn't it whenever gonna be able to
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.480]  declare total victory over tyranny because that's what drives the human
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.200]  spirit always has throughout history so it's always gonna be a game of
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:32.680]  brinksmanship but eventually people are gonna see as he said we're gonna be the
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:38.600]  example that everybody aspires to human ingenuity creativity and basic
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:44.360]  individual freedom is gonna triumph as the ultimate zenith of the human race
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:50.980]  that's right honor being good building being honorable that is the secret
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:55.600]  Paul Watson thank you for joining us we'll be right back thank you sir

[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:30.840]  your phone calls are coming up in the next segment I'd like to hear again from
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:38.400]  military police former FBI current FBI retired federal marshals secret service
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.800]  agents I know you're listening and of course you know everybody's being
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:45.800]  surveilled there's databases so what how about all of you start going public at
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:48.640]  least by calling into shows and see if they come after you and if they come
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:52.080]  after you'd be like Bongino and go completely public I mean we're going to
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:57.760]  lose everything if the good men and women in the system don't start speaking
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:02.720]  out more that's what the enemy fears and they fear alternative media and they
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:09.720]  fear quote empowered individuals it is empowering to fight evil it is
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:16.080]  empowering to do the right thing it is empowering to fight the good fight I
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:21.640]  want to hear from people in the system university professors people in Hollywood
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.960]  are told if you don't put out anti human pro government pro tyranny pro
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:31.120]  collectivism messages your film won't get seen cans it's coming out has banned
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:36.160]  anything libertarian or a conservative a Sundance is banning it film festival
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.800]  ignores conservative documentaries even though they make you know 40 million
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:48.040]  dollars like Obama 2016 this is the issue and and sometimes I start
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:53.840]  hyperventilating and sometimes I start talking fast because it's exciting to see
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:57.200]  all the globalists and all their white paper singers a global awakening they're
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:01.240]  losing the info war the liberty movements the enemy the tea parties the
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:07.000]  enemy Rand Paul the enemy Alex Jones is the enemy Matt drudge is the enemy I
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.720]  mean the Pentagon came out three months ago gave a briefing this deputy
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:15.200]  secretary of defense we played the clips and said the public doesn't believe us
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:21.680]  we have our systems in SA over 90% believe we lying we've got to quit lying
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:26.960]  and we've got to engage the public and convince them we're their friends well
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:29.720]  the Pentagon on average isn't bad people but the leadership's pure evil
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:36.360]  they're globalist and but they're not suicidal some of them and everybody's
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.520]  freaked out all the psyops people are in there's like 500 of a military
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:42.640]  civilian and they get up and go you mean we don't have to lie anymore because
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.040]  nobody believes us there's the headline government promises to stop lying
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:52.840]  because of drudge report but then they go on in the article in the video and
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:57.040]  said we're gonna go out and engage the alternative media that means buy them
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:02.520]  off infiltrate takeover and that's why everybody looks really upset in the
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:07.360]  meeting and mad except for one junior lady who's in PR who doesn't seem to
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:12.360]  understand what's happening but they're saying we're gonna quit lying now this
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:16.680]  is not an assault this is on a war sorry they don't believe us anymore so we're
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:20.320]  gonna not lie when it's incredibly obvious and we're gonna get caught he
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:24.840]  actually says that where it's already admitted but then we come out and lie
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:29.360]  like when Obama says I never said you'd lose your doctor I never said that you
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:35.160]  wouldn't have your premiums go up well he guaranteed it but it was all lie
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:39.440]  that's the kind of lie they're saying they can't tell anymore stop using the
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:44.120]  stonewall false reality with people that doesn't work like there are no bullets
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:47.320]  being bought there are no drones there are no armored vehicles Huffington post
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:52.400]  Alex Jones is discredited he's only giving no link to where this is
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:57.440]  yesterday there were five separate Democratic Party organization sites that
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.920]  came out and said I was a liar and the Republicans are insane for having bills
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.960]  to cut buying billions of bullets for Homeland Security and they say there are
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.680]  no bullets being bought I'm a liar now it doesn't matter they are buying the
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:12.040]  bullets doesn't matter they're training with paper targets of patriots doesn't
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.080]  matter they're openly trying to take on the Tea Party and gun owners and that's
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.760]  in the news they just say I'm a liar with no proof to where I'm a liar like
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:25.000]  they say I'm deeply racist with no proof on MSNBC because it's a Psyop but good
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:33.120]  keep it up that doesn't work anymore just ball-faced lying to everyone so let's
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:37.280]  go to Brzezinski three years ago talking about how humanity is awakening
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:46.040]  first time in all of human history mankind is politically awakened that's a
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:51.360]  total new reality total new reality it has not been so for most of human
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.640]  history until the last 100 years and in the course of the last 100 years the
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:01.640]  whole world has become politically awakened and no matter where you go
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:09.400]  politics is a matter of social engagement and most people know what is
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:14.360]  generally going on generally going on in the world and are consciously aware of
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:24.040]  global iniquities inequalities lack of respect exploitation mankind is now
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:28.960]  politically awakened and stirring the combination of the two a diversified
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.480]  global leadership politically awakened masses makes a much more difficult
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:38.240]  context yeah for any major power yeah for their new world order and he goes on
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:41.040]  to say we got to go to break is easier to kill a million people than to
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:44.440]  convince them now and that's now what they're saying a new white paper to the
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:50.080]  White House is it's time to just start going after empowered individuals we're

[01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:17.100]  what are you gonna do about it you know they used a kind of fake right-wing
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:21.900]  counter to communism in the 50s to bring in a lot of tyranny in this country to
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:25.700]  counter communism and then now that they've got the tyranny in place they're
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:29.620]  now moving into a type of communism and they've got all the horrible Hollywood
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:34.660]  people selling their collectivist worldview they are brainwashing our youth
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:38.340]  they're targeting young children they're demonizing Vladimir Putin because he
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:45.740]  says gays must leave children in peace AP reports that he says that Russian
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:48.660]  president Vladimir Putin says gay should feel welcome at the upcoming
[01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:55.100]  Winter Olympic Games but they must leave the children in peace well I mean
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:58.820]  heterosexuals shouldn't come up and try to target children with sexual
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:02.740]  propaganda I mean that's the thing about the so-called gay lobby the
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:07.880]  Democratic Party one is that I mean they will they want your children but they
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:11.020]  want your children period where they say the state rules your kids and we got
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:15.420]  to get past this idea that kids belong to their parents they belong to the
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:21.020]  collective they belong to the village that's run by a bunch of pedos so see
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:25.420]  that's it pedophiles are now calling themselves gay to be able to get
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:29.020]  political correct coverage that's the plan Putin told Volunteers Friday that
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:33.740]  gays visiting the city can feel calm and at ease and vowed that there would be
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:37.260]  no discrimination at the games but he emphasized that according to law banning
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:41.740]  homosexual propaganda among minors gays cannot express their views on gay
[01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:46.740]  rights issues anyone underage yeah no kidding and they're saying he's like
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:51.260]  Hitler on you know Jay Leno because of that Putin and other political politicians
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:54.900]  have defended the June propaganda law as the protection of child rights but
[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:58.500]  critics believe that the law discriminates in sexual minorities and
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:03.260]  folks it's not that Putin's even some angel we in this country allow them to
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:08.340]  teach five-year-olds all of them okay you're not gonna read and write did you
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:12.940]  know some boys like to wear dresses and some girls like to be boys and you can
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:20.220]  go in any bathroom you want I mean that is trying to screw the kids up oh we're
[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:25.380]  teaching tolerance no you're recruiting because you already run everything and
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:27.980]  now you want our kids and if you get away with that get away with anything I
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:34.300]  mean it just shows how crazy it is it's like the immigration issue I put that
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:39.780]  article back up that was amazing Kansas School poster listing sex acts part of
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:47.180]  health and science curriculum oral sex sexual fantasy caressing anal sex
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:53.380]  dancing massage masturbation holding hands see oh anal sex is like holding
[01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:55.740]  hands
[01:36:56.260 --> 01:37:03.260]  cuddling on the couch what's the anal sex say oh it's by anal sex and kissing
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:09.660]  vaginal intercourse hugging chucked each other's genitals how do people express
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:18.700]  their sexual feelings this is not the school's business but again these are a
[01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:23.660]  bunch of pervs ladies and gentlemen Gallup only 3% of Americans rank
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:28.980]  immigration reform as a top priority a new Gallup poll yeah I mean you can't go
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:31.460]  down to Mexico and just live unless you've got a bunch of money and get
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:34.580]  authorized you sure can't go down there get welfare and have your baby for free
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:37.560]  they've got one of the strictest immigration laws in the world they put
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:41.340]  Guatemalans for six months to a year in forced labor camps in Mexico if you
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:46.260]  come in but we're like hey free tuition in-state tuition free health care
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:50.020]  everything anchor babies come on it's racist if you don't the country's going
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:54.020]  bankrupt I saw John Kerry in a North American Union meeting on c span
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:57.540]  earlier during a break in there pushing open borders and they're just doing it
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:38:02.220]  by fiat and most Hispanics in polls don't want open borders they're not
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:06.000]  stupid they make it a Hispanic issue because the majority are Hispanic there's
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.020]  650 million people in Latin America their population is doubling every 25
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:14.060]  years I mean we can't take all these people especially if they're gonna get
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:18.740]  welfare or bankrupt the big banks the Republicans a Democratic leadership all
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:23.380]  want this just like they all wanted Obamacare the Republican Party leadership
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:26.380]  wanted it they're not getting rid of it now if you noticed they could repeal it
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:30.900]  it's totally unpopular even amongst Democrats they're not going to because
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:36.020]  it's a planned takeover they want our guns I'm against it they want open borders
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:39.380]  I'm against it they want Obamacare I'm against it they want to attack Syria
[01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:43.700]  the Al-Qaeda I'm against it anything therefore I'm against everything
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:51.660]  therefore is bad everything they stand for is bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:55.420]  bad bad you don't even have to intellectually analyze it I want you to
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:59.380]  but if you listen to the rhetoric of being nice and legalize the 30 million
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:03.460]  illegals let them have everything free or your races and America's are so nice
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:10.260]  we go okay here everything's for free if an old lady whose husbands died doesn't
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:14.980]  pay her property taxes they come and the city sells their house on the courthouse
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:18.940]  steps next time I want my reporters to go out to Travis County the next time
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:22.180]  they're having an auction and they'll be crying old people mainly we used to do
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:25.220]  this and then we go into Nell DeWell Spears the county tax assessor at the
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:29.260]  time I don't know if she's the county tax assessor at this time and we'd say
[01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:33.700]  on camera why are you taking a miss Johnson's house because of you know
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:37.060]  three years of unpaid stuff she doesn't have any money show Social Security she
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:41.580]  goes we don't take people's homes and we said well here's the then we show the
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:44.300]  video of it happening and then they don't even announce them a lot of times
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:48.100]  they have insiders there that are getting the houses or they won't really put it
[01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:52.300]  on the auction they'll go quietly behind the courthouse and have another
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:55.500]  auction with their friends and give it to them for nothing I mean they're it's
[01:39:55.500 --> 01:40:00.300]  unbelievable it's unbelievable how evil this government is you will take
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:04.620]  people's houses if they don't pay income tax if they don't pay property tax if
[01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:10.020]  they're bankrupt and that's loving and good but then it's it's it's it's you
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:15.420]  know just absolutely horrible if we don't give all this free stuff to anybody
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:21.460]  that doesn't want to work and by the way the illegals all are pretty hard working
[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:24.780]  okay and in many cases haven't been under American culture and had better
[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:29.860]  family values on average but the system set up where mama stays at home look at
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:35.700]  the statistics and gets three or four welfare checks show dad can work for
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:44.260]  reduced wages and still be the Patron that's it most illegals don't even need
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:47.460]  to work folks they're driving around in brand new cars everywhere I see it doing
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:50.780]  awesome because they're out there working on a construction job or out there
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:54.180]  working at a restaurant after running a business working hard have a work ethic
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:41:00.140]  and mama sits at home having kids and gets all the free welfare and you got a
[01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:03.660]  lot of Hispanic families statistically that are too proud in fact of blacks or
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:07.940]  whites to take welfare you have one of the largest groups is is he legals it
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:10.860]  will get welfare but it's also a large statistic of groups that will take none
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:13.940]  of it there are a lot of Hispanics that will take no welfare so they have TV and
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:18.500]  radio ads nationwide going Hispanics who are illegal by the way come get the
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:26.020]  welfare trust the system get on the welfare and of course their old-fashioned
[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:30.100]  so like Americans used to be they won't do it out of self-respect but they're
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:32.940]  gonna get them don't worry they'll break them by the time they're done and
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:36.100]  that's what all this is about ladies and gentlemen because they already taught
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:39.580]  Americans black white Hispanic that matter not to have kids we're all dying
[01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:43.300]  1.3 percent replacement rate so the argument's true to support social
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:48.100]  security all of it you got to bring in 30 million illegals every 10 years because
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:52.980]  that many people are dying basically boy haven't they screwed things up by design
[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:57.460]  but they don't care because they run the train wreck I want to hear from you if
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:01.060]  you work for the system in the system at a corporate insurance company if you're

[01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:58.860]  is going and it's the best of times worst of times they admit we're starting
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:02.580]  to gain the upper hand we're beginning to win their illusions imploding the
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:09.340]  military is almost completely awake now thank God and the power structure the
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:12.980]  illegitimate foreign corporate coup is getting ready to stage something and
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:18.180]  openly admitting it so Katie bar the door let's talk to shall former New York
[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:22.780]  police officer what is your take on all this coming from South Carolina hey
[01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:27.740]  Alex I don't I'm doing I'm like I said best of times worst of time brother hey
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:33.860]  listen I've been a I was a cop for 16 years in New York City I relocated down
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:39.180]  South Carolina can't afford to live up north people up north I think are
[01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:45.260]  basically clueless to what's going on they don't they don't have a grasp I've
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:50.020]  been listening to you for about two and a half years I actually got turned on to
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:56.100]  you from Glenn Beck and you just take it a step further I don't know what
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:48:01.260]  happened to Glenn Beck he he kind of changed his tone rhetoric he was all
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:05.860]  against the New World Order when he was on Fox and since he's got his own
[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:10.580]  channel it seems that he's toned it down an awful lot I don't know if he's been
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:15.580]  threatened or not he's undoubtedly listen he's undoubtedly been threatened he's
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:19.700]  scared to death upwards of 10 bodyguards in any one time I have I know
[01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:22.940]  people obviously they're you know in and out of Glenn Beck's circle and he's
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:27.260]  scared to death Glenn ought to just walk around in public get over it and go up
[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:31.140]  again he's doing some good work I don't want to criticize him go ahead oh yeah
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:36.420]  no I totally agree I mean I I backed him a hundred percent when he was on Fox
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:41.900]  like I said he was he was the person who got me into what was no I mean I mean he
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:45.100]  read three different Democratic Party funding letters where they said we need
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:48.780]  a stage terror attack to blame on the Tea Party I mean you've got to cover that
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:52.020]  when they're openly saying we're gonna stage terror attack these are criminals
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:56.180]  admitting it and so he did that and they can to show but sorry go ahead yeah
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:49:01.020]  you know I try to get the word out as much as I can living out in South
[01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:05.300]  Carolina I spotted my own little farm here try to become self-sufficient I
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:10.940]  got some cow and goats and and stuff and I'm ammoed up and I'm I'm prepared as
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:16.940]  much as I can I like your format because you bring God into everything and I
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:20.180]  really think that's going to be the well I bring God into it because when I
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:23.820]  wake up scared at 3 a.m. in the morning God is the comforter and my fear goes
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:28.100]  away believe me I mean I bring God into it because as stuff gets worse and worse
[01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:33.500]  God goes right to the center of my life yeah yeah 100% right I've tried the
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:38.060]  week in my family they're all living in New Jersey they're all clueless they they
[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:41.900]  think I'm half out of my mind which you have to be half out of your mind you
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:45.500]  know to even go down this road I believe because most people are just too
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:49.620]  afraid to face what's really happening well that's it they're children they're
[01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:52.500]  children and they were brought up everything's okay everything's going to
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:59.020]  be all right and it's not going to be all right I you know I got my cousin my
[01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:02.740]  cousin Tommy you know he's what one of the only family members I have that I'm
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:07.340]  you know he's actually listening and trying to prepare and learn the main
[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:12.340]  thing is to learn because it's so much to learn and when you talk to people like
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:16.540]  I guess where I'm at it's kind of like where you're at when we talk to people
[01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:19.780]  they must think we're out of our mind like wow how did you come up with all
[01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:23.620]  these thoughts I said listen just look it up research it it's right there to be
[01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:28.820]  found people just don't want to do the research exactly it's so alien to people
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:33.380]  to know data that they think you're showing off when you're trying to save
[01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:36.380]  them because if we don't wake them up we've got to wake them up to save
[01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:40.020]  ourselves and but but believe me it's starting to happen God bless you keep it

[01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:21.380]  retirees have received a mere 1.3 percent annual increase to their social
[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:25.540]  security checks meanwhile food stamp recipients have seen their payouts

[01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:48.100]  democracy don't rule the world you better get that to your head this world
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:55:08.420]  is ruled by violence this world is ruled by violence but a man's gonna do what a
[01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:22.220]  man's gonna do by the way folks out in Beijing they have such bad smog that
[01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:27.700]  they put up giant telescreens showing a sunrise for everyone and the people
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:32.420]  flock to it that's because no environmental standards are allowed to
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:36.980]  fully deindustrialize the US and the West so it's so cheap to make things
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:40.740]  there everything moves there that's economic warfare with Kissinger with
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:46.940]  the globalist we're gonna go to Travis and Michelle and Bert and Tom and John
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:51.020]  but right now you know it was my uncle William Farris Hammond who recommended
[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:58.580]  that song about 10 years ago for the show sundown on the Union and of course
[01:55:58.580 --> 01:56:02.820]  he died a few weeks ago I just always remember him but he lives on by
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:07.740]  recommending that song for the show from the Broadway to the Milky Way that's a
[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:15.340]  lot of real estate indeed let's go to who's up next Brett who was a Marine
[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:18.860]  for four years and now is TSA what is your take on everything that's
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:25.500]  happening hey Alex top of the morning yeah thanks for calling yeah I'm not in
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:31.700]  the TSA anymore I was when it was first started so you were in it before they
[01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:36.780]  started roping people's genitals and putting them in microwave ovens right
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:44.260]  right absolutely that's a good thing to do well absolutely so so what's your
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:50.180]  take on all the stuff that's happening well you know my my entire family has
[01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:55.820]  been in the military as long as I can remember and I'm pretty disgusted by
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:57:05.820]  what's going on the cops beating up this guy to death getting away with it that
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:13.260]  that recruits that's supposed to be a Marine saying that he's gonna beat the
[01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:20.060]  crap out of people and this that and the other it's disgusting that doesn't to me
[01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:27.420]  that's not a mine he's he's not deserving of that title if that's how he's
[01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:37.660]  going to treat his fellow man and now I'm really scared of where it's all
[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:45.180]  going just you know with the bombings and bullgrad and with the winter
[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:51.140]  Olympics coming up I'm like you said you know your your spidey senses start
[01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:56.820]  tingling and something's gonna happen whether it's a NFL game or winter
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:03.020]  Olympics just too many things going on nukes coming up missing all these
[01:58:03.020 --> 01:58:10.540]  threats from Omen I had that that was really a tell-tale sign that's
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:15.620]  something getting ready to come I agree and you know they want to corrupt the
[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:19.060]  government so good people don't want to serve that's why it's important to not
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:23.660]  just attack police out of hand because then it keeps good people from joining
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:27.740]  and then only scum join but the corruptors know that that's why they
[01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:33.380]  give the police missions that are dishonorable to dishonor them so they
[01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:37.420]  can fully dishonor them great points we're gonna come back in 60 seconds and
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:41.620]  go to Travis, Michelle, Tom, John, and others

[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:48.460]  people but I can't let's just say it's not boring around here let's just say I
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:52.180]  don't have trouble getting out of bed in the morning but then there's so much I
[02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:56.900]  wish I did it later it's unbelievable let's go to Travis in Washington wife
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:01:00.580]  works in medical system and data mining what's your take on all this stuff that's
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:06.860]  happening oh gosh Alex it's crazy well first time caller I've been listening to
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:11.980]  you about a year and a half or so I fell back asleep for a lot of years wife
[02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:19.100]  kids all that stuff I know how it is you made a point a while back that you said
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:23.140]  that some people are immune to all the crap that they shove at you and I think
[02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:27.100]  that's true to a certain extent I've always kind of seen past things seen
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:30.140]  things differently and whatnot but that's the one thing you know you push the
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:33.540]  fluoride stuff the you know everything else that's the one thing most people
[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:39.660]  aren't immune to is that numbing effect that being said yeah my wife came home
[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:45.600]  yesterday and she looked kind of strange and to practice this she's starting to
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:50.740]  wake up but she thinks I'm nuts half the time but she came home with this weird
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:54.620]  look on her face and said you wouldn't believe what I found out today and she
[02:01:54.620 --> 02:02:01.380]  told me she works in mental health care her job right now is basically as a care
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:07.300]  coordinator and she basically mitigates the amount of hospital care and whatnot
[02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:11.740]  that patients go through to keep you from going into the system too much so she
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:17.660]  tells me that the program that they use to basically correlate all the data in
[02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:21.380]  figure out why they're seeing the doctors too much or you know to slow them
[02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:27.700]  down whatnot this that and the other is called prism and I went what we mean it's
[02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:32.180]  called prism and she said that she caught her eye or caught her ear because
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:37.060]  she had heard me talking about it yeah that's NSA yeah yep and I said well it's
[02:02:37.060 --> 02:02:41.140]  this that's what the NSA's program is and she said no this is the NSA's program
[02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:48.380]  the medical industry is basically they have limited access to health histories
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:54.380]  and yeah let me stop that's what I'm saying over a thousand major companies
[02:02:54.380 --> 02:02:59.660]  just in the US alone nexus into the NSA this is actually public and they dump
[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:04.300]  all your data into the NSA and then they get to share the limited data back out
[02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:08.340]  and they're nexusing this so that if you ever go see the psychologist and want
[02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:11.780]  to put it on your insurance to get it paid for they're going to give you a
[02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:16.100]  psychological designation they're going to take your guns so yes when you go to
[02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:19.700]  the psychologist now that now the little one down the street for now that
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:22.660]  just puts it on paper records and stuff that's not happening yet but it's going
[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:29.460]  to be phased in so yes sir so so tell me what else your wife said well she said
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:34.380]  that she asked there's a whole lot of you know bureaucracy involved in it and
[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:38.380]  one of the things that she asked was well why can't I just get a access code
[02:03:38.380 --> 02:03:43.860]  to the program to go in and and do the calculations myself and she said oh no
[02:03:43.860 --> 02:03:47.620]  or boss said oh no we can't they only give us limited access because if you
[02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:51.860]  had access the whole thing you had to have access to classified stuff and
[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:56.300]  everything else and it she said it shocked her that that system was
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:59.540]  integrated into health care as well and that's one of the things that I think
[02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:02.780]  people need to realize yes sir we wrote articles last year you can pull them up
[02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:08.660]  on info wars.com that Obama health care Obama care puts your health records
[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:12.900]  into the NSA and and that's what it is yes sir so I think you should write a
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:16.220]  report up you can put a known deployment if you want or she could write a
[02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:20.660]  report send it to us and we'll publish it and then we'll tie it in though to all
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:24.180]  the articles but when it's a person on the inside talking about it even though
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:27.420]  she's not whistleblowing it still has more of an effect with people do you
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:32.140]  understand absolutely well and that's one of the things that I that first stuck
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:37.500]  out my head is was to ask her a lot I'm gonna start to work her a little bit see
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:42.260]  if she'll get a screenshot or something redacting any personal information but
[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:46.700]  get some sort of screenshot or or any kind of documentation on it and she
[02:04:46.700 --> 02:04:49.380]  might not but I don't know I mean that's why the new
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:52.220]  Obamacare thing says when you have it that you wave all your rights to
[02:04:52.220 --> 02:04:56.060]  privacy but they're doing it to everybody get a screenshot send it to

[02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:25.300]  listening to an info wars.com frontline report it's Alex Jones coming on who a
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:31.140]  year ago early 2013 was on and then also had him on after Bilderberg's I saw him
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:35.700]  out there in England a Pierce Corbin not Pierce Morgan Pierce Corbin and he's
[02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:39.180]  going to be joining us coming up to about five minutes from England from
[02:08:39.180 --> 02:08:43.140]  weatheraction.com he predicted extremely cold weather because of the sun
[02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:46.580]  decreasing its activity and some other issues and of course the media said it
[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:50.340]  was going to be record hot and was proven wrong but so what they're a pack of
[02:08:50.340 --> 02:08:54.980]  liars by design but I want to explain something through the total information
[02:08:54.980 --> 02:08:59.340]  awareness network that Admiral Poindexter rolled out in 2001 when
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:02.700]  everybody was scared was already in place they tried to get everybody to
[02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:06.300]  accept total NSA surveillance then and he wrote an article for the New York
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:09.580]  Times saying everything you do is watched every major corporation from
[02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:14.460]  pizza places to you name it when you buy something uploads it to us and there's
[02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:17.940]  a warrant out for your arrest when you order a pizza the police are coming and
[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:21.380]  every bank account everything you do and everything you eat we're going to
[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:25.060]  track it for your own good and people freaked out so they backed off and said
[02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:29.380]  we're not doing that and we were talking to Travis and the only reason I'm
[02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:32.340]  holding him over is because a he sounds credible b I already know what he's
[02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:37.380]  saying is true but to hear it from his wife who is a health care manager over
[02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:43.620]  the mental health division of hospital and now under Obamacare they go into the
[02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:47.780]  prism system you've heard of the prison software prism that's been used to
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:52.620]  spy on everybody and it is an NSA database and she's not allowed to get
[02:09:52.620 --> 02:09:56.900]  into it because she'd see everything the whole file on you everything you're
[02:09:56.900 --> 02:10:01.420]  doing that the app that the NSA people can go in and see everything you're
[02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:05.140]  going to turn on their girlfriends webcam or the school was turn on webcams
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:09.340]  and watch people they do it and all the government bureaucrats will end up
[02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:13.340]  being given access to this to run rough shot over everybody it's called
[02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:18.260]  infrastructure protection and so they're phasing it in first to power
[02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:24.700]  plants and then into police stations and then into everything and then you get
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:28.580]  your data and you put it in there imagine what Richard Nixon did with
[02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:32.420]  income tax records against people in an enemy's list look at how Obama has an
[02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:37.300]  enemy's list and I'm on it's been reported now they've got access into
[02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:41.740]  your data and they've got access into your computer to plant whatever they
[02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:48.380]  want a rogue criminal global system of spying uncontrolled that's totally
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:52.780]  illegal every time they do it felonies and so this fellow called in and said
[02:10:52.780 --> 02:10:55.980]  his wife thought he was a cook until recently she's starting to wake up but
[02:10:55.980 --> 02:11:00.260]  she came home because you know all the sitcoms say the woman's the boss and the
[02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:04.460]  man's the cook and even if she loves her husband or whatever still it's kind of
[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:08.740]  like an attitude all you know she's all women have seen hundreds of thousands of
[02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:11.740]  times since they were kids the image that men are buffoons and women know
[02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:15.180]  best and the state knows best above women and that there's nothing going on
[02:11:15.180 --> 02:11:19.500]  bad only cooks believe it and I'm not psychoanalyzing his wife from afar but
[02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:23.460]  as she begins to see more is going on oh maybe her husband knows something maybe
[02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:27.820]  he does care about her maybe he's not just paranoid and then she goes and says
[02:11:27.820 --> 02:11:31.540]  yeah we have a prison system now under Obamacare he goes oh that's the name of
[02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:35.820]  the NSA thing and she goes no it is the NSA they told us I'm dialing into the
[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:41.180]  NSA of course you are when I went to get some clarity in last week because of
[02:11:41.180 --> 02:11:47.740]  allergies at Walgreens the woman obviously knew who I was at the pharmacy I
[02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:51.700]  had to stand in line for 30 minutes waiting for them to come to me to buy an
[02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:54.100]  over-the-counter medication they're gonna make everything behind the counter
[02:11:54.100 --> 02:12:00.540]  basically is what this is a digital wall and I went up and she goes you know
[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:03.820]  about this medication do you know what it can be used for and I'm just like yeah
[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:07.900]  there's a huge you know cedar fever in Austin she goes I know it's sold out
[02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:12.340]  except for a few boxes she says give me your driver's license she swipes it now
[02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:15.780]  they don't just check it to see you know who you are and put it in the log because
[02:12:15.780 --> 02:12:18.980]  you could make methamphetamine with it hypothetically well so what I could make
[02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:22.500]  mall off cocktails with gasoline do I need to show my ID to do that well yes
[02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:25.620]  now they're saying they want that it's all about you show your ID to buy and
[02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:29.660]  sell to then get the cashless society in where even if you pay with cash they
[02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:34.660]  track what you do and then they can put the VAT tax on it the national sales
[02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:39.940]  tax see this is the total control grid going in here and it's all conditioning
[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:43.260]  us conditioning us and everyone's a secret police officer when you rent a
[02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:47.220]  car when you go to hotel when you do anything there's 20 questions they're
[02:12:47.220 --> 02:12:53.420]  putting you in an NSA database the hotels the car rentals the aircraft the
[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:58.980]  airports but it's not to keep you safe it is to watch you so the criminal group
[02:12:58.980 --> 02:13:03.100]  has all the data on how to rig the economy how to actuary the economy and
[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:08.060]  how to go after anybody they don't like this is hellish this is hellish so fit
[02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:11.580]  recap your story sir and then finish up then I'm gonna go to our guest after he's
[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:14.820]  gone I'll go back to the callers that are holding but finish your point Travis
[02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:18.860]  from Washington was this a wake-up call for her and what was the rest of the
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:24.620]  story it was a bit of a wake-up call it kind of put two and two together in her
[02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:30.540]  head and she is a she's a strong-willed intelligent woman that has bought into a
[02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:36.660]  lot of stuff but she is starting to you know reclaim a bit of her her true
[02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:44.340]  independence not her socially authorized feminist garbage and that's one of the
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:49.260]  things that I explained to her is that this isn't some you know some huge thing
[02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:52.820]  right now but it's like you said it's an incremental process this is what
[02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:56.520]  they're getting people used to to say okay well we think you've seen the
[02:13:56.520 --> 02:14:02.380]  doctor too many times we're not gonna allow this one or you have a reoccurring
[02:14:02.380 --> 02:14:08.380]  issue that seems to be something mental so we're gonna you know based on all your
[02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:11.540]  information we're gonna file you over in this direction and put you on our
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:14.420]  mental health side and she said that that's one of the things that she
[02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:19.420]  noticed is that she one of the the program is just a medical side of home
[02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:23.460]  health care and the other is a mental health and she sees clients being
[02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:26.940]  transferred from the standard medical side to the mental health side that's
[02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:30.780]  what they're doing under insurance they go you know you're stressed I'm gonna
[02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:34.860]  transfer your insurance over to this area it'll get you more coverage now
[02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:39.820]  you're in their special needs area now they can take your rights away now they
[02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:44.980]  can surveil you and I knew this when we had our first child my son eleven years
[02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:51.100]  ago the nurse had nurse for that floor asked me will you take this down to the
[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:54.900]  first floor for me and then when I came back my wife goes man she was asking if

[02:15:00.220 --> 02:15:03.460]  great well the lady came back and I said you put that in a database didn't you
[02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:06.420]  she goes yeah the health department were required to and I said really you're
[02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:09.420]  required to kind of like cops walked up to our reporters and said you're not
[02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:13.740]  allowed to film a wastewater plant from a public you know sidewalk and we said is
[02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:16.580]  there a law and they said no but you know we'll arrest you if you don't I mean
[02:15:16.580 --> 02:15:21.100]  there's no law we're just doing it we have guns and and and you know why are
[02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:24.620]  you giving us trouble you know your first amendment's trouble being a media's
[02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:28.540]  evil you know you're a empowered individual you're the enemy I mean the
[02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:31.420]  cops don't know this their brainwashed to I'm telling them I'm reverse
[02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:35.340]  engineering this forum and and this is the takeover and they're putting
[02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:38.300]  everyone in the mental health system that's the new freedom initiative is to
[02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:42.500]  make at least half the public basically mentally ill listed and people are going
[02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:45.780]  to go mentally ill society's breaking down it's screwed up the radiation the
[02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:51.500]  food the the you know the garbage the GMO the fluoride I mean society screwed up
[02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:56.980]  men have been emasculated women have been turned into tarts the children are
[02:15:56.980 --> 02:16:01.620]  falling apart I mean this is a societal overwrite a societal crisis they
[02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:06.540]  create to then collapse things into their own hands and everything is being
[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:13.580]  fed into the NSA the NSA is a front computer database for the fortune 1000
[02:16:13.580 --> 02:16:18.420]  really who set it up and get paid there as I've said Microsoft and all those
[02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:23.420]  guys Apple you name it Google they're really the corporate NSA and then the
[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:28.660]  NSA is only their mass interface that they integrate into forcing all the
[02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:33.020]  smaller companies and corporations and groups to put their data in so they can
[02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:37.060]  then mine it and control it to actuary the shutdown of all the competition you
[02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:46.060]  understand that does that make sense brother absolutely well hey one thing I
[02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:50.100]  want to say to everybody that is the most important thing if you've got any
[02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:54.420]  any inkling that things just aren't right there's a reason for that that's
[02:16:54.420 --> 02:17:00.140]  your instinct your God given nature looking around you seeing what's going
[02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:04.820]  on saying something's not right use that look into things question things
[02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:08.500]  question everything my goodness when I first started listening to you I thought
[02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:11.900]  you were a bit radical and extreme and then I started looking into things and
[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:15.260]  started remembering that sense from when I was younger before I had kids that
[02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:19.580]  something's not right and it's there that the information is out there it's
[02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:24.340]  hard to get to sometimes but look for it big absolutely I mean you mentioned
[02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:29.300]  healthcare hooking into the NSA that actually came out in you know just the
[02:17:29.300 --> 02:17:33.980]  back of financial publications and trade publications dealing with how
[02:17:33.980 --> 02:17:38.220]  everything's nexusing into this but then you call in and I remember how much
[02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:42.140]  worse it is that I'm even saying and then we pointed out on air and now it'll
[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:46.940]  draw attention undoubtedly under whistleblowing now in this new tyranny
[02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:50.740]  who knows everything's illegal and anything good is illegal she can
[02:17:50.740 --> 02:17:54.380]  undoubtedly take screenshots of all of that as long as there's no personal
[02:17:54.380 --> 02:18:00.220]  data or you know no information on the people but what's more important is her
[02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:07.500]  testimony and if you email it to us her testimony not with the name of the
[02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:12.980]  hospital not the group not any of that because that is proprietary but protected
[02:18:12.980 --> 02:18:16.900]  under whistleblowing let's just not do that write a five-page or a five
[02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:19.900]  paragraph and we'll write a five-page article around it with all the documents
[02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:25.260]  with open source information to prove it have a write up a five paragraph write
[02:18:25.260 --> 02:18:30.500]  up send a screenshot of the prism NSA interface her testimony that she was
[02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:34.180]  told this is the NSA that you're interfacing with and then we'll have a
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:39.140]  huge national breaking story on that again out of Washington State just like
[02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:43.780]  a whistleblower there gave us the data on the police under NSA with illegal spy
[02:18:43.780 --> 02:18:47.700]  hubs grabbing all the cell phone traffic and lying to the city council about it
[02:18:47.700 --> 02:18:51.700]  that program has now been suspended is in deep trouble and the legislature is
[02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:55.140]  moving to criminalize it it's already illegal but they're moving to double
[02:18:55.140 --> 02:19:00.900]  criminalize it so give us that data and that testimony will then link it to open
[02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:04.940]  source proves and we will hammer the enemy god bless you I appreciate it
[02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:10.260]  Travis thanks Alex all right we're gonna be calling you okay Rob do get his
[02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:15.180]  info and then give this to Mikhail Thelon or give it to Gucci already or
[02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:20.300]  give it to Watson and just make sure they know we already broke this last year
[02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:24.540]  we got to go find all the articles we wrote about it that Obamacare is the
[02:19:24.540 --> 02:19:27.820]  back door for NSA takeover of your medical records I believe that was the
[02:19:27.820 --> 02:19:32.540]  headline if we search that I mean I know I said that 500 times on air and then
[02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:36.580]  pointed out where it was so I just want to show people that okay we're gonna come
[02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:40.180]  back with Pierce carbon of weather action calm I appreciate him joining us
[02:19:40.180 --> 02:19:43.260]  I'll be with us till 45 after then we'll continue with your calls and other news
[02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:46.980]  I haven't hit yet and there's a lot of it you know the police can't even find
[02:19:46.980 --> 02:19:50.140]  police now that can write from millennials so they're having to hire
[02:19:50.140 --> 02:19:54.060]  middle-aged and old people the dumbing down process has been so successful that
[02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:58.020]  even police departments that for 40 years don't hire folks with over 100 IQs
[02:19:58.020 --> 02:20:04.260]  they can't hire people with 75 IQs that's the sound of a 44 Magnum and

[02:24:20.460 --> 02:24:28.220]  mind Al Gore in 2007 and in 2009 on record we'll show you some screenshots of
[02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:32.180]  these news articles said that the Arctic the North Pole would be completely
[02:24:32.180 --> 02:24:40.300]  melted completely melted in winter by 2013 it's expanded and is the thickest
[02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:44.940]  in many many decades being recorded the northern hemisphere has seen record
[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:49.260]  cold temperatures across the board temperature records have been smashed
[02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:57.020]  all across North America it goes on and on and on and Pierce carbon in the last
[02:24:57.020 --> 02:25:03.300]  five years has come on a few times a year and we appreciate it he's the owner
[02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:09.140]  and operator of weather action a very powerful web presence exposing what's
[02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:15.900]  happening he heads up weather action dot com and he's been featured on Fox News
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:21.780]  BBC you name it many other news programs for accurately predicting what would
[02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:27.420]  happen 30 45 60 days in advance and sometimes six months to a year ahead
[02:25:27.420 --> 02:25:32.780]  dealing with the solar winds and the moon and how that affects climate now the
[02:25:32.780 --> 02:25:36.620]  UN says that's not the case it's your car you got to pay them money and they'll
[02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:39.500]  save you but they've been fully discredited but they don't care they're
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:44.020]  still moving forward so he predicted record cold temperatures a year ago on
[02:25:44.020 --> 02:25:47.900]  this show and then about six months ago on this broadcast he's back to tell us
[02:25:47.900 --> 02:25:50.980]  how he was able to predict that and then coming up in the next segment he's going
[02:25:50.980 --> 02:25:56.140]  to tell us what he sees for the spring what he sees for the summer into the
[02:25:56.140 --> 02:26:01.540]  fall and next year looking into not a crystal ball but into the heavens and
[02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:07.180]  that big ball of gas that huge nuclear reactor burning in the sky that actually
[02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:11.740]  drives our climate Pierce thanks for coming on thank you it's great to be on
[02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:15.220]  your show Alex great to have you this is a short segment long segment coming up
[02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:22.900]  how did you predict it all as usual well we understand in a predictable way the
[02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:30.940]  key things the sun is going to do and how the moon will modulate the particles
[02:26:30.940 --> 02:26:35.460]  coming from the sun in what is called a solar wind the rush of particles which
[02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:40.700]  come to the million miles an hour and the son of connection is primarily
[02:26:40.700 --> 02:26:46.500]  magnetic and the moon's modulation of it is magnetic so we can ascertain when
[02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:52.700]  similar son of magnetic states happened in the past as will take place sometime
[02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:58.180]  in the future and we use the weather in the past to predict the future so these
[02:26:58.180 --> 02:27:03.100]  very extreme events in Europe and in America were things that have happened
[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:08.540]  in the general terms in the past and we use those as the predictors and that
[02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:15.300]  includes things like this pole of vortex which is a kind of well media term if
[02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:19.220]  you like but that type of very cold weather has happened before in the in
[02:27:19.220 --> 02:27:24.780]  the USA well when my dad was a little boy it was a lot colder than it even is
[02:27:24.780 --> 02:27:28.020]  now but now it's going and now it's going back towards being called again
[02:27:28.020 --> 02:27:32.700]  that's right that's right are we in danger of slipping back into a mini ice
[02:27:32.700 --> 02:27:38.540]  ages many people think we are yes the big variations in the jet stream which is
[02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:45.980]  this kind of guiding thing behind where the low pressure systems track these are
[02:27:45.980 --> 02:27:51.340]  these it now goes up to the north and down to the south in great big long deep
[02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:58.140]  waves and this is a characteristic of mini ice ages so it means on average the
[02:27:58.140 --> 02:28:04.020]  northern hemisphere is colder with longer colder winters late springs and wet
[02:28:04.020 --> 02:28:09.900]  summers but sometimes in some places sometimes is also going to be very mild
[02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:14.940]  where the jet stream is going taking warm air northwards and for example the
[02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:20.580]  British Isles now is in fact in such a situation so we've got a mild winter
[02:28:20.580 --> 02:28:26.300]  whereas you've got an astoundingly cold episodes happening in the
[02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:31.420]  Norwell in most many parts of the USA but especially the north central and
[02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:37.460]  northeast parts amazing and again you don't like to toot your horn but you do
[02:28:37.460 --> 02:28:41.980]  have the reports from last year and well absolutely yes yes and interestingly of
[02:28:41.980 --> 02:28:47.300]  course the warmest have got nothing to say except lie and I do mean lie they
[02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:54.620]  they claim oh yes this is all CO2 now I was at a meeting last year in October in
[02:28:54.620 --> 02:29:00.780]  the Wall Society in London where the IPCC that's the United Nations Climate
[02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:05.420]  Committee we're reporting you know to the public and scientists mainly what's
[02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:09.900]  going on and they said there there's all these variations in the jet stream
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:15.340]  happening we don't know why and it doesn't follow from anything to do with
[02:29:15.340 --> 02:29:21.820]  our CO2 more CO2 doesn't make these wild ways in the jet stream so I stood up and
[02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:26.020]  said well we predicted these things are gonna happen some time ago we know why
[02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:34.180]  it's happening is to do with solar lunar effects and that is the only way you
[02:29:34.180 --> 02:29:38.060]  can understand these things certainly not by CO2 tell you what stay there it's
[02:29:38.060 --> 02:29:41.980]  simply incredible and people can go to your site and see the published reports
[02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:45.540]  from a year ago six months ago we had him on you heard him he said one whopper of
[02:29:45.540 --> 02:29:50.740]  a freezing winter get ready we're in danger of a new ice age we're on the

[02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:44.420]  predict the weather accurately dealing with the sun and the cycles it's going
[02:33:44.420 --> 02:33:50.180]  through is with us and by the way I've interviewed many other astrophysicists
[02:33:50.180 --> 02:34:03.780]  scientists meteorologists who are on record who who are on record saying the
[02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:07.380]  exact same thing it's not like only Pierce Corbin is saying this he's just
[02:34:07.380 --> 02:34:11.020]  very good with the mathematics to break it down for decades you know as a
[02:34:11.020 --> 02:34:14.300]  meteorologist as an astrophysicist at weatheraction.com but I want to give you
[02:34:14.300 --> 02:34:19.460]  the floor the next 10 minutes sir I know your time is important to present to us
[02:34:19.460 --> 02:34:23.860]  the you know the fraud of the warmest how they're wanting to demonize CO2 so
[02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:27.340]  they can tax it all ignoring real environmental issues and then tell us
[02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:31.060]  what you think's coming in the future with their movement how we counter it
[02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:34.100]  when we've been proven totally accurate and right Al Gore has been proven to be
[02:34:34.100 --> 02:34:37.860]  a fraud saying polar bears can't swim and that it's all just a power grab and
[02:34:37.860 --> 02:34:43.020]  then tell us most importantly what's coming up now where most of our
[02:34:43.020 --> 02:34:47.140]  listeners are in the northern hemisphere Europe and the United States
[02:34:47.140 --> 02:34:54.700]  Canada what we can expect according to past trends with similar solar and
[02:34:54.700 --> 02:35:02.020]  lunar activity. Yes right okay well first of all the CO2 story or lie and
[02:35:02.020 --> 02:35:08.620]  then secondly what's happening next well first of all on the CO2 story I mean the
[02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:16.900]  reason for it is as you said it's a tax collecting scam it's social control it's
[02:35:16.900 --> 02:35:23.700]  a way of creating a bubble of false value through carbon trading and there's a
[02:35:23.700 --> 02:35:30.300]  lot of people riding on it so they are prepared to tell lies in order to keep
[02:35:30.300 --> 02:35:35.620]  the story going and that means for example that people like me just never
[02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:40.780]  get a look in on BBC television even though they'll have the other side on
[02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:47.260]  all the time talking nonsense now they claim basically were claiming before
[02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:52.340]  that the world was warming due to CO2 now the world is not warming in fact on
[02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:57.660]  real data it's cooling and even on their fiddle data it's not warming it's
[02:35:57.660 --> 02:36:02.780]  staying flat or cooling a little bit so they can't say that anymore instead they
[02:36:02.780 --> 02:36:06.900]  talk about climate change and now we've got all these quite considerable
[02:36:06.900 --> 02:36:13.460]  extremes going on they say that extremes are caused by CO2 now this is a lie
[02:36:13.460 --> 02:36:20.260]  and the people who put this forward know it's a lie because they also know these
[02:36:20.260 --> 02:36:25.260]  scientists that they cannot explain the variations in the jet stream which are
[02:36:25.260 --> 02:36:31.500]  the root cause of these extremes whereas we can the solar lunar theory can and we
[02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:37.420]  can prove absolutely that it is due to the sun because we can predict solar
[02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:43.580]  events, coronal holes, big solar flares and when these are going to happen and
[02:36:43.580 --> 02:36:48.020]  then what will follow and one thing which follows is at times you have these
[02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:52.860]  warmings of the stratosphere now when these warmings of the stratosphere
[02:36:52.860 --> 02:36:58.780]  happen they encourage changes lower down in the toposphere that is where the
[02:36:58.780 --> 02:37:03.020]  weather happens and bigger variations in the jet stream and that is what is
[02:37:03.020 --> 02:37:07.060]  happening now we predicted some warmings on the stratosphere they have
[02:37:07.060 --> 02:37:11.900]  happened or indeed are happening as we speak whereas the CO2 people can explain
[02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:18.340]  none of this whatsoever so they know when they say CO2 they are lying and they
[02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:24.700]  can carry on lying as long as the governments allow them to and encode
[02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:29.580]  them to and shovel them money in order to lie so what can they probably do about
[02:37:29.580 --> 02:37:34.380]  that well the thing is you have to demand your politicians only listen to
[02:37:34.380 --> 02:37:39.580]  proven science and just say look the CO2 people have got no evidence and if any
[02:37:39.580 --> 02:37:44.140]  politician says they have just say to him okay where is it and you'd be surprised
[02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:47.660]  that politicians will then shut up and they probably refuse to talk to you or
[02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:51.900]  you might get some on your side and they're alright well in America there's
[02:37:51.900 --> 02:37:58.340]  more politicians skeptical or you know we'll know the CO2 stories are lying
[02:37:58.340 --> 02:38:02.420]  I prefer to say that in Britain but we do have a increasing number in Britain and
[02:38:02.420 --> 02:38:05.940]  I think there will be a change at some point but it has to be worked on I was
[02:38:05.940 --> 02:38:09.700]  about to say just last week it came out in the news that the BBC has secret
[02:38:09.700 --> 02:38:14.460]  meetings with their thousands of news presenters of how to defraud the public
[02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:19.780]  and keep the lie going that's right absolutely completely see the BBC is
[02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:23.060]  going to be publicly controlled it's meant to be open accountable now this
[02:38:23.060 --> 02:38:28.380]  was a lie they had this meeting in January 2006 where they said they had
[02:38:28.380 --> 02:38:33.380]  they were calling together 28 scientific experts to establish beyond any reasonable
[02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:37.220]  doubt what was really going on actually there were two scientists presence and
[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:42.740]  the rest were all greenpeace fraudsters various people on the gravy train
[02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:48.780]  assorted liars people of whom I have absolutely zero respect and there were
[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:51.900]  two scientists who were on the gravy train themselves now of course that
[02:38:51.900 --> 02:38:57.180]  meeting wasn't discussing science it was discussing how to lie which is why the
[02:38:57.180 --> 02:39:04.380]  BBC spent a huge amount of effort legal defenses to prevent who was at this
[02:39:04.380 --> 02:39:10.460]  meeting being made no now the judges judges to give them a credit of those
[02:39:10.460 --> 02:39:14.340]  said no no BBC can't hide these things and the list of who was there as public
[02:39:14.340 --> 02:39:18.980]  no I've met three of those people and you know it's very interesting what
[02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:23.180]  happened subsequent to that meeting because one of the very interesting
[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:27.100]  things was about the insurance industry in Britain we have been predicting
[02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:32.180]  floods that happened in 2007 for example and the insurance industry has spent
[02:39:32.180 --> 02:39:37.860]  six million pounds on predicting on a flood map flood risk map to show when
[02:39:37.860 --> 02:39:43.300]  floods the most likely to happen where they'll happen and if they happen are you
[02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:47.820]  going to be affected so I found them I said well that's a great map you got do
[02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:51.500]  you want to know if it's actually going to flood and they said no no we don't want
[02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:56.100]  to know I said what you don't want to know no we don't want to know in the
[02:39:56.100 --> 02:39:58.900]  conversation that followed it was basically the reason they said well
[02:39:58.900 --> 02:40:03.180]  you're on the wrong bus Mr. Corbyn and then you think about it the reason why
[02:40:03.180 --> 02:40:06.700]  they don't want to know is kind of obvious they are defrauding the public
[02:40:06.700 --> 02:40:09.940]  by claiming there's going to be loads of floods now there will be floods of course
[02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:15.940]  at some point but they want people to buy insurance that they won't use and of
[02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:19.300]  course me popping up one year saying oh there will be floods this year or there
[02:40:19.300 --> 02:40:24.980]  won't be would mean that someone who had bought the insurance when the insurance
[02:40:24.980 --> 02:40:28.060]  companies knew there was going to be no floods could take them to court you see
[02:40:28.060 --> 02:40:31.500]  and I'll give it off so they don't want to hear I remember you were on a couple
[02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:36.260]  years ago talking about the drought in the Midwest and Texas and then you
[02:40:36.260 --> 02:40:42.140]  predicted did it with solar activity and and that that the flooding would come
[02:40:42.140 --> 02:40:46.660]  soon and then now we've seen some of the worst flooding on record again how do
[02:40:46.660 --> 02:40:51.900]  you do that so actually and then a in the time we've got left what's coming
[02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:57.220]  what's coming January for example that was those snowmagedons if you like you
[02:40:57.220 --> 02:41:01.860]  had three of those also in December under these super cold backs in January we
[02:41:01.860 --> 02:41:06.900]  predicted those from the careful timing of the solar lunar effects and when they
[02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:11.100]  happened in the past sometimes a number of times in the past and then say okay
[02:41:11.100 --> 02:41:16.260]  so this message is on and we can say when give or take a day or so I mean I
[02:41:16.260 --> 02:41:21.940]  suppose the super cold came of day or two earlier than we said but you know it
[02:41:21.940 --> 02:41:25.820]  carried on in it was pretty you know it was basically there when we said in
[02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:30.540]  where we said as well so we're pleased with that and I've just been thinking
[02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:35.740]  about your people who listen to your show and what we ought to do I think is
[02:41:35.740 --> 02:41:41.100]  we'll give them free extra forecast for the next three days for anyone getting
[02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:45.420]  USA forecast and we'll put on the website this is for Alex Jones show
[02:41:45.420 --> 02:41:48.620]  listeners but of course anyone who gets on there will take advantage of it but
[02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:52.740]  doesn't matter so for the next three days we give people extra forecast so you
[02:41:52.740 --> 02:41:56.980]  set them on when you get to you see so when you pay for one month you get two
[02:41:56.980 --> 02:42:00.500]  months well it's certainly worth it and we should probably try to even get you
[02:42:00.500 --> 02:42:05.540]  to action.com yeah absolutely but but in general coming up as you make these
[02:42:05.540 --> 02:42:11.780]  predictions each year on the show yes we have not yet done actually a detailed
[02:42:11.780 --> 02:42:20.060]  forecast for the USA or Britain for the coming six months but we are doing it
[02:42:20.060 --> 02:42:27.500]  and extending the time ahead and what is obvious is that these world swings of
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:33.740]  the jet stream are going to continue so it will mean another summer of dramatic
[02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:41.620]  contrast in the USA so you know very hot dry bits in places and breaking down in
[02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:50.660]  other parts to you know severe rain and cold bits and similar types of contrast
[02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:57.380]  in Britain although Britain is smaller so it you know the variations across
[02:42:57.380 --> 02:43:02.660]  it might not be so large as they are across the US of A but a characteristic
[02:43:02.660 --> 02:43:07.500]  of last summer for example or a lot of or even this this winter was we had them
[02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:13.260]  quite warm in the south-west USA a very warm at times as well as being very
[02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:17.620]  cold in the northeast now this type of conflict will continue I'm not saying
[02:43:17.620 --> 02:43:22.460]  it'll be that contrast exactly but that type of thing will continue and that's
[02:43:22.460 --> 02:43:30.540]  because the jet stream is moving wildly because the Sun is doing what and the
[02:43:30.540 --> 02:43:35.140]  Sun is the main driver explain that to people yeah the Sun sending its particles
[02:43:35.140 --> 02:43:40.380]  out charge particles are captured by various planets one of them being the
[02:43:40.380 --> 02:43:46.820]  earth and they're magnetically connected to the Sun so when the magnetic
[02:43:46.820 --> 02:43:50.900]  connections are favorable you get more of these particles and the moon
[02:43:50.900 --> 02:43:56.660]  interrupting or not the solar wind also again changes the number and effect of
[02:43:56.660 --> 02:44:00.940]  the particles and these particles they change the rate at which weather fronts
[02:44:00.940 --> 02:44:07.060]  operate so when we have our five periods they call that means red red action
[02:44:07.060 --> 02:44:12.540]  red weather action period five level five it means that weather fronts are
[02:44:12.540 --> 02:44:19.060]  much more intense and you can see that in this very cold bit as it was warming
[02:44:19.060 --> 02:44:23.820]  up we warned there will be tornadoes now somebody emailed in said what tornadoes
[02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:27.100]  and of course they started at the start of this period I said well just wait and
[02:44:27.100 --> 02:44:32.380]  see and sure enough the word tornadoes the end of that in various places as a
[02:44:32.380 --> 02:44:39.060]  war man at the cold as we predicted well I mean the big issue here is farmers
[02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:42.620]  going back thousands of years looked at how the Sun was acting how the moon was
[02:44:42.620 --> 02:44:46.900]  acting and you know had lore about weather according to the Sun and moon
[02:44:46.900 --> 02:44:51.620]  because they didn't know that the Sun had basically these winds to boil it down
[02:44:51.620 --> 02:44:55.420]  and then when the moon got and then when the moon gets in front of the earth I
[02:44:55.420 --> 02:44:59.220]  mean it's more complex than that but that obviously that's one of the main
[02:44:59.220 --> 02:45:03.340]  drivers of climate but you talk to a mainline meteorologist they'll tell you
[02:45:03.340 --> 02:45:10.420]  the Sun has nothing to do with it I mean that's a son I mean we ought to call
[02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:14.100]  the science of these so-called scientists what it is it is mentally
[02:45:14.100 --> 02:45:19.420]  defective is credit is credit is that I mean you know the Vikings knew that when
[02:45:19.420 --> 02:45:24.780]  there was Aurora as sure as my follow-stay storms will follow and that
[02:45:24.780 --> 02:45:29.020]  always always the case you are bigger or you will have big storms especially in
[02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:31.820]  the northern hemisphere for those that don't know that's when there's more
[02:45:31.820 --> 02:45:36.020]  radiation coming in from the Sun causing an aurora borealis I mean
[02:45:36.020 --> 02:45:39.740]  everybody knows now that that when you get a big solar flare that hits the
[02:45:39.740 --> 02:45:44.700]  earth it it will produce nuclei then you'll have a bunch of rain come out
[02:45:44.700 --> 02:45:48.900]  of a clear sky it'll form clouds and you'll get rain I mean it's one of the
[02:45:48.900 --> 02:45:53.580]  astrophysicists all know this NASA knows this but even their own scientists
[02:45:53.580 --> 02:45:56.700]  won't come out and say it it's just ridiculous
[02:45:56.700 --> 02:46:02.660]  after all who's paying them I mean they're on a government payroll which is there to
[02:46:02.660 --> 02:46:10.700]  rob the public through you know carbon taxes subsidies to various green dodgy
[02:46:10.700 --> 02:46:16.980]  operations and so forth so we have a lack of accountability in the state
[02:46:16.980 --> 02:46:21.780]  apparatus when that should be where we have accountability and it's only when
[02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:26.580]  voters rise up and demand accountability from their politicians that we're going
[02:46:26.580 --> 02:46:30.700]  to get somewhere I mean you should vote out chuck out the people that don't
[02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:35.620]  believe in accountability very well said sir well listen I appreciate your time
[02:46:35.620 --> 02:46:40.540]  thank you do we have any idea in this Sun cycle I mean I know when you know the
[02:46:40.540 --> 02:46:44.340]  Sun's doing something or going in a certain cycle you can predict with 90%
[02:46:44.340 --> 02:46:48.740]  or more accuracy what's going to happen but but generally you know the Sun we
[02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:52.540]  don't know always acts the same yeah
[02:46:52.540 --> 02:46:57.820]  yeah we around now with these this month and last month well the early part of
[02:46:57.820 --> 02:47:01.780]  this month we've had a lot of extra solar activity which we predicted and it
[02:47:01.780 --> 02:47:05.980]  came on time I'm very pleased with that the next few months though month or two
[02:47:05.980 --> 02:47:11.220]  is going to be much quieter there'd be much less solar activity less aurora which
[02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:19.260]  often favours cold weather and less active weatherfront so there will be
[02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:23.060]  some more cold blast in general we can say without doing the detailed forecast
[02:47:23.060 --> 02:47:28.700]  but you know you can't for sure where and one thing we're pretty aware of
[02:47:28.700 --> 02:47:35.300]  already though is that the Olympics in the Winter Olympics in Russia they will
[02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:40.420]  be there will be a lot of very cold air there and cold snowy blast so they're
[02:47:40.420 --> 02:47:47.820]  not going to be troubled by more air which is probably good news what about
[02:47:47.820 --> 02:47:50.580]  the Olympics coming up they want to have out in the middle of the desert in
[02:47:50.580 --> 02:47:55.420]  the Middle East well I think that's insane by any measure you know it's
[02:47:55.420 --> 02:48:00.980]  just complete balmy insanity I mean there's a reason why people don't live
[02:48:00.980 --> 02:48:05.100]  there I mean it's because it's too damn hot so I mean to run Olympics that is
[02:48:05.100 --> 02:48:11.100]  just just completely stupid it's some money grabbing operation well we are
[02:48:11.100 --> 02:48:15.380]  seeing more and more insane behavior thank you very much thank you very much
[02:48:15.380 --> 02:48:21.140]  here's all right there he goes the head of weather action the man who predicted
[02:48:21.140 --> 02:48:23.940]  so much of what happened this winter you can go back to the show last time he was
[02:48:23.940 --> 02:48:27.100]  on I mean it's amazing it really is amazing and he like you said the
[02:48:27.100 --> 02:48:31.220]  Vikings basically knew this stuff when there's a big aurora borealis that
[02:48:31.220 --> 02:48:35.340]  means they didn't know what was causing that the northern lights they thought it
[02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:39.540]  was Thor riding around as chariot they just knew that that mean a bunch of
[02:48:39.540 --> 02:48:43.700]  weather was going to come the next few days because all that nuclei comes in
[02:48:43.700 --> 02:48:48.580]  creates static electricity to boil it down to layman's terms that then allows
[02:48:48.580 --> 02:48:53.980]  water droplets to condense to make bigger droplets clouds rain thunderstorms
[02:48:53.980 --> 02:48:59.580]  snow I mean it's just it's just the Sun folks the if it wasn't for the Sun the
[02:48:59.580 --> 02:49:07.300]  Earth would be absolute zero absolute zero no life on it but the UN says the
[02:49:07.300 --> 02:49:10.780]  Sun has no effect on climate I mean that's like saying the Sun has no effect
[02:49:10.780 --> 02:49:14.740]  on plants growing I mean and like you said it is total mental illness ladies
[02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:19.420]  and gentlemen total mental illness where they I mean they could come out and say
[02:49:19.420 --> 02:49:24.140]  the world's flat and people might believe it I want to go to Michael who says
[02:49:24.140 --> 02:49:27.980]  he works at a large financial company when we come back then John a veteran
[02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:32.140]  Tom in Missouri former military wants to give us take on the state of things and

[02:54:43.060 --> 02:54:48.900]  calls right now let's talk to Michael Michael you're on the air thanks for
[02:54:48.900 --> 02:54:54.300]  holding go ahead Alex thanks for having me Michael man I'm calling out of the
[02:54:54.300 --> 02:55:00.300]  West Coast in San Diego and don't even know where to start I want to start I
[02:55:00.300 --> 02:55:04.620]  work at a big kind of financial institution out here in San Diego I
[02:55:04.620 --> 02:55:10.340]  won't name their name but it starts with three letters and there are just
[02:55:10.340 --> 02:55:15.540]  things that we are doing within our industry that I cannot take anymore
[02:55:15.540 --> 02:55:21.820]  personally I'm 26 I took a service job I was questioned for two months on any
[02:55:21.820 --> 02:55:27.060]  outside nothing that I have which I don't I don't invest I was also asked to
[02:55:27.060 --> 02:55:32.460]  not disclose our certain fees that we are sliding into customers accounts I've
[02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:36.620]  also were on recorded lines being in service and I've been asked not to go
[02:55:36.620 --> 02:55:41.940]  into anything political and aside from that we're about 12 miles away from your
[02:55:41.940 --> 02:55:48.020]  in our airspace and I have seen just tenfold increase in kind of military
[02:55:48.020 --> 02:55:53.420]  presence looks like military operations drills and wanted to get your take on
[02:55:53.420 --> 02:55:58.100]  that and then secondly I had an uncle who did some work with JAXA he works with
[02:55:58.100 --> 02:56:03.660]  NASA for the precipitation satellite that they launched and he's just got some
[02:56:03.660 --> 02:56:08.700]  photos stories from Japan on the radiation over there Japanese government
[02:56:08.700 --> 02:56:14.060]  coming out saying that iodine is in fact not helpful and toxic he's got
[02:56:14.060 --> 02:56:18.620]  pictures of the coastal regions over there and just wanted to get your your
[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:25.260]  take on all that what do we do and it's the iodine back in supply well I mean I
[02:56:25.260 --> 02:56:28.060]  haven't seen the Japanese government say that but it's on record that iodine is
[02:56:28.060 --> 02:56:31.820]  good for you with different isotopes protect the thyroid so doesn't absorb
[02:56:31.820 --> 02:56:34.980]  the bad isotopes but the Japanese government has been lying saying there's
[02:56:34.980 --> 02:56:39.620]  no radiation they've been caught lying that's all on record they've got all
[02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:42.260]  sorts of propaganda here saying don't worry about radiation on the West Coast
[02:56:42.260 --> 02:56:46.340]  it's just all part of this attitude of not caring but I do know financial
[02:56:46.340 --> 02:56:50.740]  institutions are jacking up fees and stuff across the board and then trying
[02:56:50.740 --> 02:56:55.740]  to deny it later like JP Morgan Chase and others remember Bank of America tried
[02:56:55.740 --> 02:57:00.060]  the $5 fee every time you use your debit card I mean they're talking about in the
[02:57:00.060 --> 02:57:04.500]  news making you pay to deposit money now because money is so worthless the
[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:08.580]  the globalists can give themselves all the fiat money they want so that's why
[02:57:08.580 --> 02:57:12.100]  they don't even need us in their economy anymore because it's so fraudulently
[02:57:12.100 --> 02:57:15.620]  based thanks for the call let's go to John in Wisconsin you're on the air go
[02:57:15.620 --> 02:57:19.540]  ahead thanks for holding yeah I've got about two or three comments for you Alice
[02:57:19.540 --> 02:57:24.500]  for first of all this NSA thing you know they really wanted to change the NSA
[02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:34.100]  works they skate Congress to enact a law that dissolves the biker courts you
[02:57:34.100 --> 02:57:41.620]  don't need a secret court to do business and just delete everything that they
[02:57:41.620 --> 02:57:48.940]  don't need you know because otherwise it's just all rhetoric no I know they
[02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:52.820]  have secret courts about how they're spying on us and they've been caught
[02:57:52.820 --> 02:57:56.500]  lying on over and over again and they have lapdog people in these courts but
[02:57:56.500 --> 02:58:01.260]  that's a red herring too because most of spying goes on outside that court
[02:58:01.260 --> 02:58:08.300]  anyways it's just like a distraction like well we have a court over here yeah
[02:58:08.300 --> 02:58:12.860]  but you know they kind of like to use that to make us think that the
[02:58:12.860 --> 02:58:16.540]  government's working no no I totally agree with you I totally agree with you
[02:58:16.540 --> 02:58:21.420]  anything else yeah the as far as the environment is concerned you know a lot
[02:58:21.420 --> 02:58:25.780]  of people don't realize that there's more active volcanoes right now since you
[02:58:25.780 --> 02:58:31.340]  know biblical times and each one of those volcanoes is doing out so much
[02:58:31.340 --> 02:58:37.220]  sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide oh exactly no no exactly great point we're gonna be
[02:58:37.220 --> 02:58:41.940]  right back they just want to power grab folks but back on the radio this Sunday

[03:01:49.980 --> 03:01:54.340]  a school on lockdown and I'm concerned that they may be trying to do something

[03:01:58.220 --> 03:02:03.020]  kids that they're prisoners and they do it to create psychological trauma and a
[03:02:03.020 --> 03:02:07.260]  mass Stockholm syndrome where they only think the state can keep them
[03:02:07.260 --> 03:02:13.900]  safe daddy can't do that but expanding on all the points you made you want to

[03:02:56.300 --> 03:03:00.660]  full frontal oh I know they're attacking the Midwest big time because the Midwest
[03:03:00.660 --> 03:03:04.740]  for all its problems economically is the absolute heart of this country right

[03:04:16.340 --> 03:04:20.300]  get millions more people to come to the site and then people would also ask you
