[00:23.600 --> 00:30.600]  The York Monument is dedicated to commemorate racial integration.
[00:30.600 --> 00:36.600]  Thank you for listening to GPN.
[00:36.600 --> 00:39.600]  I.R.N. USA Radio News, I'm Jody Jordan.
[00:39.600 --> 00:43.600]  The Red River is slowly receding at Fargo, North Dakota.
[00:43.600 --> 00:47.600]  But a breach in the dyke protecting the city's north side has flooded the school campus.
[00:47.600 --> 00:51.600]  But it wasn't serious enough to warrant the evacuation of nearby residents.
[00:51.600 --> 00:54.600]  Robin Litky is a spokeswoman for the city of Fargo.
[00:54.600 --> 00:57.600]  We've just asked them to plug their sewers in to monitor their basements.
[00:57.600 --> 01:01.600]  Watters may remain dangerously high for a week.
[01:01.600 --> 01:06.600]  And the Obama administration is readying a fresh aid for General Motors and Chrysler.
[01:06.600 --> 01:10.600]  The two automakers have already received more than 17 billion.
[01:10.600 --> 01:15.600]  GM is asking for more than 16 billion in new aid while Chrysler wants another 5 billion.
[01:15.600 --> 01:20.600]  The administration is expected to insist on tough cost-cutting measures.
[01:20.600 --> 01:22.600]  Here's Ken Thomas.
[01:22.600 --> 01:29.600]  It has an impact on communities throughout the country in terms of supplier jobs, dealer jobs, and the like.
[01:29.600 --> 01:32.600]  This is I.R.N. USA Radio News.
[01:32.600 --> 01:36.600]  My name is John DiMartino. I'm from Colorado.
[01:36.600 --> 01:39.600]  And I started using Andy Willoughby's three-step plan.
[01:39.600 --> 01:41.600]  It's extremely encouraging for me.
[01:41.600 --> 01:45.600]  And they've given me training on exactly what to say.
[01:45.600 --> 01:49.600]  And I don't have to be a salesman to talk to people that are calling me.
[01:49.600 --> 01:52.600]  It's made me feel like, wow, let's do business.
[01:52.600 --> 01:57.600]  I can only conceive of growing and growing and growing now.
[01:57.600 --> 02:01.600]  I'm 56 years old and I feel young. I feel renewed.
[02:01.600 --> 02:04.600]  I'm happy. I'm excited about my financial future.
[02:04.600 --> 02:10.600]  In a short amount of time, less than an hour a day, if someone wanted to, they could have a system.
[02:10.600 --> 02:13.600]  This is a stress-relieving business.
[02:13.600 --> 02:16.600]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway? This is Andy Willoughby.
[02:16.600 --> 02:20.600]  After five years, the three-step plan is a proven success story.
[02:20.600 --> 02:28.600]  If you're tired of worrying about money all the time, go to threestepplan.com or call 800-480-2102.
[02:28.600 --> 02:33.600]  800-480-2102.
[02:33.600 --> 02:39.600]  President Barack Obama makes his first overseas presidential visit this week to some of America's closest allies.
[02:39.600 --> 02:43.600]  The president is widely popular among the European public.
[02:43.600 --> 02:47.600]  It may learn this week whether the same holds true for European leaders.
[02:47.600 --> 02:52.600]  His agenda includes the global financial meltdown and the fight against terror.
[02:52.600 --> 03:00.600]  An Israeli official close to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert says there's a slim chance of a prisoner swap deal with Hamas before Olmert believes office.
[03:00.600 --> 03:08.600]  The official says contacts are ongoing, but he assumes matters will wait for the new government, which will be sworn in next week.
[03:08.600 --> 03:15.600]  When College Basketball's Final Four is shaping up, Connecticut will be there along with Big East rival Villanova.
[03:15.600 --> 03:20.600]  Villanova beat Pitt last night while Yukon topped Missouri.
[03:20.600 --> 03:26.600]  Later today, Louisville takes on Michigan State and North Carolina plays Oklahoma for the two other spots.
[03:26.600 --> 03:53.600]  For the latest news and analysis, log on to IRNUSANews.com.
[03:53.600 --> 04:09.600]  A number of deadly incidents are being reported across Afghanistan. Here's Jason Stragioso.
[04:09.600 --> 04:16.600]  A surgeon attacks on a roadside bomb killed 10 Afghan security force members and at least four incidents across Afghanistan.
[04:16.600 --> 04:22.600]  A roadside bomb killed three Afghan army commanders on patrol Saturday in eastern Paxia province's Gardez district.
[04:22.600 --> 04:27.600]  Alaska's Mount Redoubt volcano continues to spew out towering columns of thick ash.
[04:27.600 --> 04:31.600]  An eruption early Saturday produced a cloud nearly five miles high.
[04:31.600 --> 04:36.600]  There have been about a dozen bursts and a series of eruptions that began last weekend.
[04:36.600 --> 04:39.600]  And a Karabara is an anchorage resident.
[04:39.600 --> 04:43.600]  It's an odd glow. It's like being on maybe a different planet or something.
[04:43.600 --> 04:50.600]  It's not really dark. It's not dusk. It's almost like a deep blue hue or something.
[04:50.600 --> 04:52.600]  And it's also very quiet.
[04:52.600 --> 04:59.600]  Iraqi troops using loudspeakers ordered Sunni security volunteers in a Baghdad neighborhood to turn in their weapons today.
[04:59.600 --> 05:06.600]  The arrest of their leader has sparked fierce gun battles between the former U.S. allies and American and Iraqi troops.
[05:06.600 --> 05:11.600]  The arrests could have long-term implications. Here's Robert Reed.
[05:11.600 --> 05:20.600]  With the crackdown on the group at Fado, similar organizations in other parts of Baghdad are now quite concerned that this may be the beginning of a government crackdown.
[05:20.600 --> 05:28.600]  If that's the case, it would seriously undermine U.S. efforts to stabilize Baghdad before American troops are due to pull out of the city at the end of June.
[05:28.600 --> 05:43.600]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.

[07:00.600 --> 07:11.600]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[07:11.600 --> 07:15.600]  Welcome, welcome, and thank you so much for joining us today.
[07:15.600 --> 07:20.600]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[07:20.600 --> 07:25.600]  Central Standard Time with a syndicated transmission across the country and the world.
[07:25.600 --> 07:31.600]  It is the 29th day of March 2009.
[07:31.600 --> 07:40.600]  Economist, author, historian, Webster Griffin Tarbley will be with us for an hour and 45 minutes today when we come back in the next segment.
[07:40.600 --> 07:43.600]  Later in the next hour, I see the phone lines are already loaded.
[07:43.600 --> 07:45.600]  We will start going to your calls next hour.
[07:45.600 --> 07:50.600]  So for folks that are already holding, you can either hold or call back next hour.
[07:50.600 --> 07:55.600]  We have a host of important issues to talk about. Webster wrote a book 10 years ago detailing the derivatives bubble.
[07:55.600 --> 07:59.600]  The central bank setting up world government through controlled bankruptcy.
[07:59.600 --> 08:03.600]  We're going to be discussing that in detail and what the real Barack Obama agenda is.
[08:03.600 --> 08:05.600]  He's written two books on Barack Obama.
[08:05.600 --> 08:13.600]  He also wrote the unauthorized biography groundbreaking research on George Herbert Walker Bush back in the early 1990s.
[08:13.600 --> 08:18.600]  So that is coming up in the next segment.
[08:18.600 --> 08:30.600]  Luke Radowski is 22 years old and founded We Are Change, an activist group that goes around at press conferences and other events confronting politicians about serious issues of government-sponsored terrorism, globalization, the New World Order.
[08:30.600 --> 08:34.600]  He also does freelance reporting for infowars.com.
[08:34.600 --> 08:41.600]  He went to ask Mayor Bloomberg questions as he's done many times at an event at a major hotel in New York City.
[08:41.600 --> 08:43.600]  They grabbed him and didn't tell him to leave.
[08:43.600 --> 08:47.600]  They just grabbed him and charged him with trespassing with two other We Are Change members.
[08:47.600 --> 08:50.600]  They have a story on that up at infowars.com.
[08:50.600 --> 08:54.600]  He's still in jail and is reportedly going to be arraigned tomorrow for trespassing.
[08:54.600 --> 08:57.600]  They also then told him he wasn't a member of the press.
[08:57.600 --> 09:05.600]  As if a blogger or anybody else, whether you work for the New York Times or the Associated Press or a blog, the first amendment is your right to go to press conferences and ask questions.
[09:05.600 --> 09:09.600]  And it was advertised as an open hotel with restaurants and bars.
[09:09.600 --> 09:11.600]  And that's where he went to ask him the question.
[09:11.600 --> 09:14.600]  And he's been seized upon along with two other people.
[09:14.600 --> 09:17.600]  The details of that are up on infowars.com.
[09:17.600 --> 09:20.600]  I did a little emergency broadcast last night, Internet only.
[09:20.600 --> 09:28.600]  We always have thousands of people, even when I'm not live, listening to the rebroadcasts, audio streams at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[09:28.600 --> 09:35.600]  And I was at my studios in South Austin, our main TV studios, interviewing Webster Tarpley for a second Obama film that we're making.
[09:35.600 --> 09:48.600]  We've got Jesse Ventura and Webster Tarpley and Gerald Salente and Economist George Humphrey and KRS-1, Rap Icon and so many others in the Obama deception that's the mega viral film on the Internet right now,
[09:48.600 --> 09:51.600]  sending shockwaves all over the place, thanks to you out there spreading the word.
[09:51.600 --> 09:54.600]  And then we got the call, so I was able to go in and do about 15 minutes.
[09:54.600 --> 09:56.600]  I want to thank folks for calling.
[09:56.600 --> 10:00.600]  The 18th precinct still has busy phones the last time I checked.
[10:00.600 --> 10:05.600]  As we called down there at about nine when we learned of it and said, listen, you're saying you're in a lot of trouble, young man.
[10:05.600 --> 10:06.600]  You're not really press.
[10:06.600 --> 10:07.600]  Your press press is fake.
[10:07.600 --> 10:09.600]  There's no such thing as infowars.com.
[10:09.600 --> 10:11.600]  So I called up politely and said, no, that's a real reporter.
[10:11.600 --> 10:14.600]  You can't make up some charge about impersonating a reporter.
[10:14.600 --> 10:16.600]  And they were very rude and hung up on me.
[10:16.600 --> 10:20.600]  So we just gave their number out on air to let them know that we're fully aware of what they're doing there and tracking it.
[10:20.600 --> 10:27.600]  So I'll cover that more tomorrow once Luke is out of jail on the weekday show from 11 to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[10:27.600 --> 10:35.600]  And while Webster is visiting us from Washington, D.C. and Maryland where he's based, he's also going to be with me for the first hour on the show tomorrow.
[10:35.600 --> 10:42.600]  And then he's going to drive the airport and leave back home doing several other interviews the next few weeks on the new Obama film.
[10:42.600 --> 10:46.600]  I'm making because the crimes of this administration are accelerating so fast.
[10:46.600 --> 10:52.600]  You know, we talk about forced compulsory national service in the film from his chief of staff's book.
[10:52.600 --> 10:55.600]  He wrote speeches Obama and Rahm Emanuel gave.
[10:55.600 --> 11:00.600]  Now they have introduced a host of bills up until Thursday.
[11:00.600 --> 11:11.600]  It still had the provisions in several of the bills, 1388 and others for forced national compulsory, quasi-domestic military service, senior corps,
[11:11.600 --> 11:20.600]  secure corps, military training, Stalinist or Leninist or Hitler, Eugen, a literal type move.
[11:20.600 --> 11:21.600]  And those got pulled out.
[11:21.600 --> 11:25.600]  But now a new bill, and it's up on infowars.com. Curtin, I wrote a story about it.
[11:25.600 --> 11:27.600]  It's also in the Associated Press.
[11:27.600 --> 11:31.600]  A new bill has been introduced to do just that.
[11:31.600 --> 11:36.600]  And I'll also be telling you about that later in the radio show today.
[11:36.600 --> 11:41.600]  Now there are hundreds of versions of the Obama deception that has been uploaded for free to the Web.
[11:41.600 --> 11:46.600]  You know, we posted it first two weeks ago at prisonplanet.tv.
[11:46.600 --> 11:55.600]  Our members' website where it's in near DVD quality, all of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book in an e-format, my weekly TV shows.
[11:55.600 --> 12:03.600]  We simulcast the weekday radio show on the Internet for folks visually with a radio show.
[12:03.600 --> 12:04.600]  It isn't just a video cam.
[12:04.600 --> 12:07.600]  We have video feeds, high quality cameras.
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.600]  You know, it's a full news production.
[12:09.600 --> 12:12.600]  And so that's there for prisonplanet.tv members as well.
[12:12.600 --> 12:16.600]  And now we're adding more shows to my studios in Austin.
[12:16.600 --> 12:20.600]  We have Jason Bermas there also doing a show and the Somal Casting with the Genesis Network Nine to Midnight.
[12:20.600 --> 12:24.600]  So all of that's going on for prisonplanet.tv members.
[12:24.600 --> 12:27.600]  But folks went and grabbed it as we asked them to do.
[12:27.600 --> 12:34.600]  And then uploaded hundreds of copies, every file sharing network, YouTube, Google, BlipTV, LiveLeak, all of them.
[12:34.600 --> 12:40.600]  But a lot of them, people were so hasty to upload them that it wasn't uploaded in the highest quality for free for everybody.
[12:40.600 --> 12:44.600]  But we found a great encode of the Obama Deception for free on YouTube.
[12:44.600 --> 12:47.600]  And the guy has a director's channel, so it's not in ten minute blocks.
[12:47.600 --> 12:53.600]  It's the full close to two hour film there, absolutely free for everybody.
[12:53.600 --> 12:56.600]  And so you just Google the Obama Deception.
[12:56.600 --> 12:58.600]  You just Google the Obama Deception.
[12:58.600 --> 13:00.600]  And it's the first to second to third link.
[13:00.600 --> 13:02.600]  It's always changing every day.
[13:02.600 --> 13:05.600]  It's the one that says Obama Deception in high quality, full film.
[13:05.600 --> 13:09.600]  And that one has over 800,000 views as of today.
[13:09.600 --> 13:18.600]  If you count up the hundreds of other versions that we've gone and looked at on the web, it's now over 15 million views in only two weeks for free.
[13:18.600 --> 13:22.600]  And so I want to thank all of you that are spreading the word about the Obama Deception.
[13:22.600 --> 13:34.600]  If you want to support myself, the filmmaker, and these films that cost an excess of $100,000 a piece to make, please buy the high quality DVD of the Obama Deception at infowars.com.
[13:34.600 --> 13:39.600]  And of course, it has the extras on it as well, or watch it in super high quality.
[13:39.600 --> 13:43.600]  You can burn it to DIVX, which plays on most DVD players just by pointing and clicking.
[13:43.600 --> 13:47.600]  And people are out there already spreading thousands of these out across the country.
[13:47.600 --> 13:59.600]  I know many people are already with 500 to 1,000 copies because you can burn the DIVX version in high quality to a regular computer CD and it plays in almost all the new DVD players.
[13:59.600 --> 14:01.600]  I think it's Mike's on.
[14:01.600 --> 14:06.600]  But all of that is, all of that is going on.
[14:06.600 --> 14:10.600]  And so again, it's very, very exciting to have that happening.
[14:10.600 --> 14:16.600]  UsePrisonPlanet.tv to go in there 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[14:16.600 --> 14:28.600]  You know, that just pays for our high quality servers to put it out in super high quality and then get regular CDs, pop them in and then point and click burning it to DIVX onto the CD or DVD.
[14:28.600 --> 14:31.600]  And it is just ultra massive what's happening.
[14:31.600 --> 14:36.600]  We're not just spreading this virally with over 14 to 15 million views on the web in two weeks.
[14:36.600 --> 14:42.600]  The number one viral video on the web on its way to topping even loose change that I was involved in executive producing the final cut.
[14:42.600 --> 14:46.600]  People are actually getting the physical copies and getting them out to everybody.
[14:46.600 --> 14:57.600]  But the way you really support us is with the PrisonPlanet.tv membership or you can make more films or by buying the high quality DVD at infowars.com or by calling toll free 888.
[14:57.600 --> 15:01.600]  253-3139.
[15:01.600 --> 15:10.600]  And you can also write to me, Alex Jones at 3001, South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[15:10.600 --> 15:18.600]  But again, when we come back from this quick break, you're not going to hear a lot from me in the first 45 minutes or so because I'm going to sit back and ask Webster Tarboly, a true expert.
[15:18.600 --> 15:23.600]  I mean, a year and a half ago, Saul Obama coming, he said, this is the anointed one.
[15:23.600 --> 15:25.600]  He's going to expand the wars.
[15:25.600 --> 15:27.600]  He is going to hire nothing but lobbyists.
[15:27.600 --> 15:29.600]  He is going to bring nothing but Wall Street in to loot everybody.
[15:29.600 --> 15:31.600]  And he said they're going to implode the economy.
[15:31.600 --> 15:32.600]  Watch this.
[15:32.600 --> 15:35.600]  And then sure enough, he was right about all of it.
[15:35.600 --> 15:47.600]  The youth brigades, the force compulsory service, really a scholarly analysis of the entire Barack Obama phenomenon who's there with left covered and neutralized the Democrats of the country.
[15:47.600 --> 15:53.600]  I saw seeing in poll Friday 65% of Democrats think the war is going well and Obama's doing a good job.
[15:53.600 --> 15:58.600]  That goes from 80% of Democrats against the war under Bush to now 65% for it.
[15:58.600 --> 16:11.600]  That is a truly sickening example of mind control and of disgraceful psychological mindset because it's their guy who they feel like represents them and they feel like they won by getting them in the White House.
[16:11.600 --> 16:24.600]  They suddenly love secret arrest, renditions, no rights for detainees, warrantless NSA taps on people's phones, just absolute trillions to the banks, this AIG distraction of 165 million.
[16:24.600 --> 16:42.600]  Barack Obama, the worst president ever, dwarfing George Bush, Webster Tarfley straight ahead.
[16:54.600 --> 17:01.600]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out. What then? Then?
[17:25.600 --> 17:40.600]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts. That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[18:44.600 --> 18:53.600]  Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the world and that having a clogged colon is good for you. That being overweight is absolutely healthy.
[18:53.600 --> 19:00.600]  That there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air. And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you.

[20:44.600 --> 21:06.600]  That's right. We are shouting right back at the International Bankers. The devil is in the details. Thank you so much for joining us on this 29th day of March, 2009.
[21:06.600 --> 21:16.600]  And we have with us in studio historian, author, economist, Webster Griffin Tarpley who wrote the unauthorized biography of George Herbert Walker Bush.
[21:16.600 --> 21:27.600]  He's written an unauthorized biography on Barack Obama and another book detailing Obama and the people that are really behind him. The thugs, the globalists, the international financiers imploding the world economy.
[21:27.600 --> 21:46.600]  And we've got the big G20 meeting coming up this week. If you watch the European Parliament, as I do online, they're openly announcing a world government, a global Europe, a world currency, the end of national sovereignty and these private banks ruling through NATO and the United States military force, the planet.
[21:46.600 --> 22:03.600]  But you won't really hear that on US news or they're starting to admit global currency and the end of the dollar and all of this. So Webster, out of the gates, let's get into who these people really are, what we're facing, and what's going to happen at this big G20 meeting that's coming up later this week.
[22:03.600 --> 22:20.600]  Let me start, Alex, by congratulating you for the Obama deception. I think it's the best political documentary in many decades. It's a masterpiece in a genre and I think it's destined to bring home some rewards from international film festivals that you and your fine team have put together.
[22:20.600 --> 22:37.600]  I recommend everybody get it because it's indispensable and I hope it's going to contribute to turning the tide. In other words, going towards a situation where Obama is not going to be the Messiah but where he's going to essentially deal with the collapse of his poll numbers to basically checkmate him, like to stop him from doing all these things that he wants to do.
[22:37.600 --> 22:44.600]  Well, as you said, let's cover polls first then. He's dropped from 85% to 55 to 60 in a month and a half. Go ahead.
[22:44.600 --> 22:53.600]  Right. Not only has he fallen in the polls but the negatives have gone way up and the negatives are always the key thing to watch because once the negatives go up, it's very hard to get them down again.
[22:53.600 --> 23:13.600]  So once people have caught on to who Obama is, then it's difficult for him to continue to hoodwink them. And of course there's a lot of crazy propaganda that Obama is some kind of a friend of the masses or friend of the poor that he's distributing wealth into the pockets of poor people or anything of the sort.
[23:13.600 --> 23:24.600]  It's a little crazy. Obama has delivered $10 trillion, maybe more, maybe $11 trillion, maybe $12 trillion. Hard to say. Federal Reserve is very secret about what they do.
[23:24.600 --> 23:39.600]  But he's delivering upwards of $10 trillion to bankers and if you look through all of his programs compared to that, the amount of spending that actually would help anybody in terms of food stamps, unemployment benefits, infrastructure building to create some jobs,
[23:39.600 --> 23:56.600]  it's maybe a third of a trillion. So it's about a 30 to 1 ratio. The bankers get 30 for every dollar that the rest of us get. So the bankers get the lion's share, the Wall Street characters, the derivatives merchants, and the crumbs is what falls on the floor.
[23:56.600 --> 24:11.600]  And then we, the productive middle class, we get to pay for all of this and then the bankers sit around with their neocon mouthpieces talking about how bad welfare is when it's $1 out of every 30. 30 goes in corporate banker welfare, $1 to the people.
[24:11.600 --> 24:26.600]  The middle class fits the bill, but the media has craftily maneuvered the middle class, some of them, to believe that they're actually with Obama against the lazy people that got bad mortgages when the Treasury Secretaries, Geithner, and the last one, Paulson admit it has nothing to do with that.
[24:26.600 --> 24:28.600]  And that's why they didn't use the tart money on that.
[24:28.600 --> 24:42.600]  The idea, if you listen to Rush Limbaugh or these other essentially pro-Wall Street characters, is they'll tell you that Obama is helping the deadbeats and the losers and the welshers of society, and he's robbing the achievers.
[24:42.600 --> 24:54.600]  Well, the deadbeats turn out to be those derivatives bankers. Now, you ask, who are they? We had an extraordinary event on Friday afternoon, which maybe can be the starting point for our conversation today.
[24:54.600 --> 25:06.600]  At the White House, Obama had a special meeting with about 15 representatives of what's today called the banking industry. It's really not an industry, it's really banking.
[25:06.600 --> 25:14.600]  But they were there, and you got to think of this as Obama's the President of the United States, but he's meeting with the Board of Directors.
[25:14.600 --> 25:25.600]  The idea is that the United States is being made into a corporate state, in some ways similar to the Mussolini fascist corporate state of Italy in the 1920s, 1930s.
[25:25.600 --> 25:34.600]  And the Board of Directors comes to hear a report from the President, and they know they made him, they can unmake him.
[25:34.600 --> 25:43.600]  These are the people who put Obama into office. Goldman Sachs gave Obama more money than any other single source, Citibank and others, not far behind.
[25:43.600 --> 25:45.600]  That's total four times what McCain got.
[25:45.600 --> 25:53.600]  Let me just go through this list, and you'll hear the people who made Obama great, and again, once they're fed up with them, they can also get rid of him.
[25:53.600 --> 26:07.600]  Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase, that is one of the biggest zombie banks. It's a derivatives monster with hundreds of billions and actually trillions of derivatives, just by itself.
[26:07.600 --> 26:15.600]  So, Diamond of J.P. Morgan Chase. We've got Ken Lewis of Bank of America. Now, this guy is an aggressive spokesman.
[26:15.600 --> 26:23.600]  He says, yeah, we're the bankers, we get the bonuses, and you're going to sit there and like it, and by the way, I want another 500 billion or whatever it is.
[26:23.600 --> 26:34.600]  Vikram Pandit, known in Wall Street circles as Pandit the Bandit. This is Citigroup, and Pandit, he's basically driven the stock of that company down to about a dollar a share,
[26:34.600 --> 26:40.600]  but they have been bailed out three times by the federal government to the tune of about 50 billion dollars.
[26:40.600 --> 26:51.600]  We've got John Stumpf of Wells Fargo, Kenshan Ault of American Express. Now, Kenshan Ault can borrow money for zero interest and then lend it to you for 25% interest on your credit card,
[26:51.600 --> 26:53.600]  and every time you turn around, he's going to hit you with a new fine.
[26:53.600 --> 27:03.600]  John Koskinen of Freddie Mac. Now, that used to be a federal government agency. It was privatized, made into this tremendous cornucopia of corruption and money.
[27:03.600 --> 27:15.600]  Ronald Loog of State Street Bank. Robert Kelly of Bank of New York Mellon. Bank of New York Mellon is the back office of the tarp of the original October bailout, the 700 billion that is still being distributed.
[27:15.600 --> 27:25.600]  Rick Waddell of Northern Trust. Northern Trust is a bank that gave Obama a sweetheart mortgage for his Resco lot there in Chicago.
[27:25.600 --> 27:32.600]  James Rohr of PNC Financial Services Group. Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs.
[27:32.600 --> 27:39.600]  Now, he deserves a special mention, of course, because Goldman Sachs is really one of the beneficiaries of this entire system.
[27:39.600 --> 27:46.600]  He was joined by John Mac of Morgan Stanley. If you put together Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, Blankfein and Mac.
[27:46.600 --> 27:55.600]  You remember last summer, a year ago now, a year and a half ago, when you were paying about $450 to $5 a gallon for gas.
[27:55.600 --> 28:01.600]  My basic rough calculation is that out of the price of gasoline, Blankfein and Mac were getting about a dollar.
[28:01.600 --> 28:11.600]  Each of them was getting $0.50, maybe a little bit more for Goldman Sachs, but a total of $1 out of the price of every gallon of gas sold in the United States.
[28:11.600 --> 28:12.600]  Through their speculation.
[28:12.600 --> 28:19.600]  Yeah, through Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, because they were using derivatives on the London ICE exchange to get the price of gasoline.
[28:19.600 --> 28:22.600]  And they call this scamming free market. They're the ones giving the free market a bad name.
[28:22.600 --> 28:27.600]  The free market has not been seen on Lander's Sea for many a day, and it's not going to be seen.
[28:27.600 --> 28:31.600]  If you say the free market, you're talking about this group of people.
[28:31.600 --> 28:35.600]  Pirates just running giant policies. You're talking about Madoff running scams.
[28:35.600 --> 28:39.600]  Yeah, these are basically bigger versions of Madoff.
[28:39.600 --> 28:42.600]  Richard Davis of U.S. Bank Corp. That's another one.
[28:42.600 --> 28:49.600]  Then a couple of sort of token people, Camden Fine of the Independent Community Bankers of America, that would be small regional banks.
[28:49.600 --> 28:51.600]  And there, of course, they're the lambs for the slaughter.
[28:51.600 --> 28:59.600]  The plan is that solvent local and regional banks are going to be fed into the voracious jaws of the sharks.
[28:59.600 --> 29:03.600]  J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America and Citibank.
[29:03.600 --> 29:05.600]  Ed Yingling of the American Bankers Association.
[29:05.600 --> 29:10.600]  So I call this Obama and the 13 Zombies, because these are zombie bankers.
[29:10.600 --> 29:11.600]  Why are these zombie bankers?
[29:11.600 --> 29:14.600]  They don't do anything for society.
[29:14.600 --> 29:18.600]  They say we're lending. They haven't been lending for decades.
[29:18.600 --> 29:22.600]  Stay there. Stay there. We've got a break. We're going to come back to this big meeting.
[29:22.600 --> 29:26.600]  And then, oh, we haven't gotten to this. Before the big meeting, he's running off to meet with the queen.
[29:26.600 --> 29:29.600]  Obama's got a kneel before the first time the U.S. president's done that.
[29:29.600 --> 29:52.600]  Stay with us. We'll be right back in FullWars.com.
[29:59.600 --> 30:06.600]  We'll be right back in FullWars.
[30:30.600 --> 30:37.600]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock, and what I'm about to tell you is true.
[30:37.600 --> 30:42.600]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.

[33:32.600 --> 33:39.600]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[33:46.600 --> 33:51.600]  There's a lot of confusion. The American people are angry.
[33:51.600 --> 34:01.600]  They're saying $165 million to AIG when we gave them $200 million, one company alone of trillions and trillions.
[34:01.600 --> 34:07.600]  Imagine how mad they would be if they knew that that was all a diversion and a red herring and a distraction.
[34:07.600 --> 34:10.600]  So we're going to be talking about that as well, Webster Tarpley.
[34:10.600 --> 34:14.600]  Also, two bills last week had mandatory national service in them.
[34:14.600 --> 34:18.600]  That got stripped out. Another one's been introduced again. We're going to cover that later.
[34:18.600 --> 34:25.600]  Webster, you've gotten up to the 13 big zombie banks, that is, the dead derivatives banks running global bubbles to buy up everything.
[34:25.600 --> 34:29.600]  They create fiat, junk paper, buy real assets while it still has worth.
[34:29.600 --> 34:34.600]  The Ponzi schemes now popped. They're telling the American taxpayer, you're going to be free market.
[34:34.600 --> 34:37.600]  You're going to give trillions of dollars in tax money to us.
[34:37.600 --> 34:40.600]  We've got the Army standing by for martial law if you don't like it.
[34:40.600 --> 34:44.600]  And that's their quote, free market, is basically robbing us at gunpoint.
[34:44.600 --> 34:48.600]  So continue. They marched down to the White House ahead of the G20 coming up later this week.
[34:48.600 --> 34:57.600]  The first time a sitting president will go for an audience with the Queen of England ahead of that the day before he goes to Europe for that meeting.
[34:57.600 --> 34:59.600]  We'll get to that next. Right now, continue.
[34:59.600 --> 35:04.600]  Well, 13 zombie bankers meeting with Obama at the White House on Friday afternoon.
[35:04.600 --> 35:09.600]  And again, it's the board of directors receiving the report from the president, the guy they created.
[35:09.600 --> 35:17.600]  Again, Goldman Sachs with Blank Fine, Mac of Morgan Stanley, Pandit of Citigroup, Lewis of Bank of America,
[35:17.600 --> 35:22.600]  and of course, the dean of the bankers, Jamie Diamond of JP Morgan Chase.
[35:22.600 --> 35:31.600]  This is a discussion with Obama and it shows, I think, this momentum towards what you can only call a corporate state or indeed a fascist corporate state.
[35:31.600 --> 35:39.600]  When you have the government merging with the bankers and big business, that's not socialism, that's called fascism.
[35:39.600 --> 35:44.600]  That's what Mussolini did in Italy and that was really an imitative...
[35:44.600 --> 35:49.600]  Before you go any further, get into the fact that, and I'm not even saying we need socialism,
[35:49.600 --> 35:52.600]  but if we're going to have it, might as well give it to the people if we're paying for it.
[35:52.600 --> 35:57.600]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, Newsweek with the headline, we're all socialists now.
[35:57.600 --> 36:01.600]  This is the opposite of that, but that's their little left cover scam. Explain that.
[36:01.600 --> 36:03.600]  Yeah, Obama can't survive without left cover.
[36:03.600 --> 36:08.600]  In other words, if Bush tried to do these things or anybody else operating under this right-wing ideology,
[36:08.600 --> 36:11.600]  there would be essentially a social explosion.
[36:11.600 --> 36:18.600]  The reason that they think Obama can get away with it is, of course, he's the messiah, he's got this utopian messianic overtone going.
[36:18.600 --> 36:22.600]  But of course, he's a progressive. He's got left cover, right?
[36:22.600 --> 36:26.600]  He does this stuff for the people. He's helping out the average working stiff.
[36:26.600 --> 36:29.600]  And of course, none of that, right? He's owned by these bankers.
[36:29.600 --> 36:31.600]  Socialism would be different.
[36:31.600 --> 36:37.600]  Socialism, rigorously defined, is the ownership of means of production by the government.
[36:37.600 --> 36:42.600]  Now, problem with that in the United States is there's almost nothing left in the way of means of production.
[36:42.600 --> 36:47.600]  The automobile industry is collapsing, infrastructure collapsing, highways, railroads all collapsing.
[36:47.600 --> 36:49.600]  Hard to find anything much to own.
[36:49.600 --> 36:55.600]  The other thing is that under socialism, this is somehow supposed to be done in the interests of the working class.
[36:55.600 --> 36:58.600]  And you don't see anything of that with Obama.
[36:58.600 --> 37:00.600]  So this group of people gathers.
[37:00.600 --> 37:05.600]  Now, they're looking ahead to the group of 20, which meets in London on April 2nd, this coming week.
[37:05.600 --> 37:09.600]  But the other thing they're doing is they're looking back towards what Geithner proposed.
[37:09.600 --> 37:11.600]  Two big things from Geithner this week.
[37:11.600 --> 37:19.600]  The first from Geithner is the toxic assets and the bad bank or aggregator bank that he's talked about.
[37:19.600 --> 37:25.600]  Now, what are toxic assets? We're in a depression. What's the cause of the depression?
[37:25.600 --> 37:32.600]  Well, toxic assets. Does that mean that some penny-ante chicken feed, peanuts, subprime mortgages
[37:32.600 --> 37:36.600]  brought down the entire world banking system? The idea is crazy.
[37:36.600 --> 37:42.600]  This is a derivatives crisis. There's a 1.5 quadrillion derivatives bubble.
[37:42.600 --> 37:50.600]  1.5 or $1,500 trillion of derivatives out there in the world.
[37:50.600 --> 37:57.600]  And what they're trying to do, the whole U.S. government is now being run to prop up that bubble, to keep it inflated, right?
[37:57.600 --> 37:58.600]  To keep it going.
[37:58.600 --> 38:04.600]  Now, Geithner says that he is going to put up $6 of U.S. government money from the Treasury
[38:04.600 --> 38:08.600]  for every dollar from a hedge fund or a bank.
[38:08.600 --> 38:12.600]  So if I'm Goldman Sachs and they're likely to be the first ones on this gravy train,
[38:12.600 --> 38:16.600]  I can come with a billion dollars and I'm Goldman Sachs.
[38:16.600 --> 38:20.600]  I can say, Geithner, here's my billion. Geithner is going to put down $6 billion.
[38:20.600 --> 38:25.600]  In other words, $6 to 1 leverage with the government, Treasury, you and me providing the money.
[38:25.600 --> 38:29.600]  And then buy up some toxic derivatives and keep them.
[38:29.600 --> 38:34.600]  Now, suppose these things go to zero because that's where they're likely to go, right?
[38:34.600 --> 38:38.600]  Derivatives, not only do they have no value, they have negative value.
[38:38.600 --> 38:42.600]  They're like the Rass Bucknick in the old little Abner cartoon, right?
[38:42.600 --> 38:46.600]  It's a currency that has negative value. You've got to bring the garbage men to take it away.
[38:46.600 --> 38:49.600]  So toxic assets are of that sort.
[38:49.600 --> 38:51.600]  So if it goes to zero, who loses money?
[38:51.600 --> 38:55.600]  Well, the taxpayer loses six times the amount that Goldman Sachs will lose.
[38:55.600 --> 38:59.600]  But if there's an upside, suppose these derivatives for some reason go up.
[38:59.600 --> 39:02.600]  Who gets the upside? Goldman Sachs gets the upside.
[39:02.600 --> 39:06.600]  So this is basically putting the U.S. government into the hedge fund business
[39:06.600 --> 39:14.600]  with managers who are undoubtedly going to be Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley.
[39:14.600 --> 39:15.600]  The people that got us into this.
[39:15.600 --> 39:16.600]  Yeah, the people who created the crisis.
[39:16.600 --> 39:18.600]  AIG, don't forget them.
[39:18.600 --> 39:24.600]  The AIG financial products hedge fund of London, England created by itself.
[39:24.600 --> 39:27.600]  And one hedge fund, $3 trillion of derivatives.
[39:27.600 --> 39:29.600]  Now $3 trillion is a hefty sum.
[39:29.600 --> 39:32.600]  That's more than the gross national product of France.
[39:32.600 --> 39:34.600]  So they're up there with $3 trillion.
[39:34.600 --> 39:35.600]  That's where your money went, by the way.
[39:35.600 --> 39:43.600]  Everybody's screaming about the $165 million, million with an M, of bonuses for these hedge fund hyenas from AIG.
[39:43.600 --> 39:45.600]  And of course, you deserve to be indignant about that.
[39:45.600 --> 39:53.600]  But you've got to be more indignant about the fact that the U.S. government has given $165 billion to AIG
[39:53.600 --> 39:54.600]  to unwind those derivatives.
[39:54.600 --> 39:59.600]  Now the really interesting thing is, who got the $165 billion, right?
[39:59.600 --> 40:02.600]  For quite a while, Bernanke was saying, I won't tell you.
[40:02.600 --> 40:06.600]  Bernanke's number two guy, this guy, Cone at the Federal Reserve saying, I won't tell you.
[40:06.600 --> 40:07.600]  Kashkari wouldn't tell you.
[40:07.600 --> 40:09.600]  Kashkari, my lips are sealed.
[40:09.600 --> 40:12.600]  And he's from Goldman Sachs, of course.
[40:12.600 --> 40:13.600]  So who got the money?
[40:13.600 --> 40:14.600]  Goldman Sachs.
[40:14.600 --> 40:21.600]  In other words, Kashkari basically put his hand into the taxpayer till and transferred about $12 billion to Goldman Sachs.
[40:21.600 --> 40:28.600]  And then foreign banks, Barclays Bank of Britain, Société Générale of France and Deutsche Bank of Germany.
[40:28.600 --> 40:34.600]  Now, if those banks were so important, why didn't Gordon Brown of England, Sarkozy of France and Merkel of Germany,
[40:34.600 --> 40:36.600]  why didn't they bail out their own banks?
[40:36.600 --> 40:38.600]  Why does the U.S. taxpayer have to pay for that?
[40:38.600 --> 40:40.600]  But that's what you get with Obama.
[40:40.600 --> 40:41.600]  Now that's one side of it.
[40:41.600 --> 40:50.600]  The other side with Obama is that Geithner at the Treasury says he wants to be able to seize any bank and indeed any company.
[40:50.600 --> 40:51.600]  He wants to do that.
[40:51.600 --> 40:52.600]  Let's look what they did.
[40:52.600 --> 40:54.600]  There's this bank called Washington Mutual, WAMU.
[40:54.600 --> 40:58.600]  It was the largest savings bank in the U.S., a very large deposit base.
[40:58.600 --> 41:01.600]  As far as I can see, it was on the whole solvent.
[41:01.600 --> 41:03.600]  So they're gobbling up all the healthy regional banks.
[41:03.600 --> 41:07.600]  What they did with that was Sheila Baer, and Sheila Baer is a criminal.
[41:07.600 --> 41:11.600]  She's a class A felon at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
[41:11.600 --> 41:15.600]  She said, I'm going to take Washington Mutual and basically seize it,
[41:15.600 --> 41:23.600]  and I'm going to feed that into the jaws of J.P. Morgan Chase to prop them up for another three months or six months with all that money from depositors.
[41:23.600 --> 41:26.600]  Now they want to have a free hand to be able to do that with everything.
[41:26.600 --> 41:30.600]  So at the top, there would be basically J.P. Morgan Goldman Sachs,
[41:30.600 --> 41:33.600]  and everything else in theory could be fed into that.
[41:33.600 --> 41:38.600]  And with the link between J.P. Morgan Goldman Sachs and Geithner and Obama,
[41:38.600 --> 41:46.600]  they would have a fully developed, full-blown fascist corporate state where the government and the banks would merge and become the same thing.
[41:46.600 --> 41:48.600]  And it's all done under left cover.
[41:48.600 --> 41:52.600]  Smoke and mirrors, but Obama has left cover.
[41:52.600 --> 41:55.600]  And that, I think, suggests the way to stop this stuff.
[41:55.600 --> 41:58.600]  If you want to stop Obama, strip away the left cover.
[41:58.600 --> 42:00.600]  It means, among other things, you've got to attack him from the left.
[42:00.600 --> 42:03.600]  Don't say he's a socialist who's helping the poor.
[42:03.600 --> 42:11.600]  Say that he's a tool of Wall Street and the big banks who is basically robbing the Treasury and mobilizing the Federal Reserve
[42:11.600 --> 42:16.600]  to give that 10 or 12 trillion, or whatever it's going to be, 12, maybe 12 trillion and counting by now,
[42:16.600 --> 42:21.600]  to his friends in Wall Street who are also his contributors from AIG to Goldman Sachs and so on.
[42:21.600 --> 42:27.600]  Now, Webster, I want to move on to the G20 meeting because they're openly announcing a world government run by these private banks
[42:27.600 --> 42:33.600]  that's already issuing a secret global super currency of monetized pyramid debt
[42:33.600 --> 42:36.600]  that, again, we as taxpayers have to pay for.
[42:36.600 --> 42:37.600]  So this is open world government.
[42:37.600 --> 42:41.600]  This time magazine has said that they say it's the solution to the crisis they created
[42:41.600 --> 42:45.600]  is giving them even more power to globally regulate tax.
[42:45.600 --> 42:50.600]  Everybody at 85% through the OECD, through global regulation, through carbon taxes.
[42:50.600 --> 42:53.600]  They say in the first year that will be $750 billion.
[42:53.600 --> 42:55.600]  That's the times of London and associated press.
[42:55.600 --> 43:03.600]  So this is the entire world, the entire real economy being fed into the piratical criminal bankers' mouth.
[43:03.600 --> 43:05.600]  Yeah, and of course, global warming.
[43:05.600 --> 43:07.600]  It's ironic, right?
[43:07.600 --> 43:10.600]  There's snow in the streets of Chicago and it's the last weekend in March,
[43:10.600 --> 43:17.600]  but nevertheless, we're told that the humanity has to be crucified in order to stop global warming.
[43:17.600 --> 43:24.600]  This is the biggest fraud to come down the pike since race science or Aryan blood back in the 19th century.
[43:24.600 --> 43:26.600]  Stay there, we gotta break, we're gonna come back.
[43:26.600 --> 43:27.600]  What is the G20?
[43:27.600 --> 43:30.600]  Why are they saying this is the birth of world government oven by the bankers?
[43:30.600 --> 43:33.600]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[43:33.600 --> 43:38.600]  This year millions of people will lose electricity, ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes
[43:38.600 --> 43:41.600]  could leave you without power for days.
[43:41.600 --> 43:45.600]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[43:45.600 --> 43:47.600]  That's why you need the pack light.
[43:47.600 --> 43:52.600]  The pack light is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1200 hours.
[43:52.600 --> 43:56.600]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark,
[43:56.600 --> 43:59.600]  making it easy to find when you need it most.
[43:59.600 --> 44:01.600]  One Florida customer says,
[44:01.600 --> 44:07.600]  My pack light has lasted through four hurricanes in two years, over 30 days without electricity
[44:07.600 --> 44:09.600]  and I'm still using the same battery.
[44:09.600 --> 44:14.600]  The pack light comes with a 25-year warranty and prices started just $12.99.
[44:14.600 --> 44:17.600]  It's time for you to be prepared with a pack light.

[44:37.600 --> 44:41.600]  and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[44:41.600 --> 44:45.600]  In these troubled times one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[44:45.600 --> 44:50.600]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins and heavy metals.
[44:50.600 --> 44:52.600]  It's a documented fact.
[44:52.600 --> 44:59.600]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[44:59.600 --> 45:04.600]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely

[45:42.600 --> 45:45.600]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos and toothpaste contain chemical additives such as sodium-loral sulfate,
[45:45.600 --> 45:47.600]  the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[45:47.600 --> 45:51.600]  Did you know that many moldy vitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[45:51.600 --> 45:54.600]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[45:54.600 --> 45:56.600]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[47:46.600 --> 47:48.600]  Your calls are coming up the next hour with Webster Tarbley.
[47:48.600 --> 47:52.600]  We are live 29 today of March 2009 on the Sunday edition.
[47:52.600 --> 47:56.600]  If you appreciate the information we put out here, we post it as a podcast for every show.
[47:56.600 --> 47:58.600]  Six days a week at infowars.com.
[47:58.600 --> 48:02.600]  Absolutely free there at infowars.com and prismpana.com.
[48:02.600 --> 48:05.600]  Okay, Webster, quick answers because there's a lot to cover here.
[48:05.600 --> 48:17.600]  When they're announcing that they're going to have a new bank of the world that we pay our carbon taxes to, and I have that again here today out of Reuters,
[48:17.600 --> 48:20.600]  and they say it's a climate deal for tax.
[48:20.600 --> 48:26.600]  I have another article that I gave you where they announced that it's going to cost trillions a year to, quote, reform the new green economy.
[48:26.600 --> 48:27.600]  They laugh.
[48:27.600 --> 48:31.600]  They know it's a huge scam to literally tax the entire carbon cycle.
[48:31.600 --> 48:40.600]  So tell us what's going on at the G20, and then why is Obama, for the first president ever, stopping first for an audience being summoned by the Queen?
[48:40.600 --> 48:45.600]  Well, London is reasserting itself as the actual financial center of the world.
[48:45.600 --> 48:46.600]  New York is collapsing.
[48:46.600 --> 48:48.600]  London, they think, is going to hang on.
[48:48.600 --> 48:53.600]  They think the euro will go down, the US will go down, and the British will come out on top.
[48:53.600 --> 48:56.600]  Therefore, Obama has to kowtow to the Queen of England.
[48:56.600 --> 48:58.600]  Now you look at this group of 20.
[48:58.600 --> 49:01.600]  This is basically the old group of eight, right?
[49:01.600 --> 49:10.600]  It's Europe, Japan, the United States, Canada, but now we've got other big third world countries, China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, places like this.
[49:10.600 --> 49:16.600]  It represents about 90% of the world in terms of economic activity and a large part of the population.
[49:16.600 --> 49:26.600]  Now, the dominant personality is Gordon Brown of Great Britain, joined by Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mervyn King of the Bank of England.
[49:26.600 --> 49:39.600]  The basic idea is to assert a world currency dictatorship, a world financial dictatorship, through the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and whatever new institutions they want to group around them.
[49:39.600 --> 49:47.600]  And the idea is they want, first of all, money, right, because they want to bail out Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Iceland, places like this.
[49:47.600 --> 49:56.600]  But in the same time, the moment when you're bailed out as a country is when you go under IMF dictatorship, because your government becomes bankruptcy administrative.
[49:56.600 --> 50:02.600]  Shock therapy. There are 120 things you've got to do, which means hand over your infrastructure to them. Explain that.
[50:02.600 --> 50:14.600]  Well, what they want you to do is privatize, deregulate, bust unions, lower the standard of living, destroy your labor legislation, destroy your child labor laws, all the rest of this stuff.
[50:14.600 --> 50:23.600]  It used to be called the Washington Consensus, but now it's got to be austerity, super austerity, and naturally they want to motivate this with the polar bears, right?
[50:23.600 --> 50:30.600]  Your kid is going to starve, no health care, but you can be comforted. It's all being done to stop global warming and help the polar bears.
[50:30.600 --> 50:41.600]  Now, the leading edge is Gordon Brown, when he came here to Washington, demanded $500 billion for the IMF, and out of that $500 billion, the U.S. was supposed to cough up $100 billion.
[50:41.600 --> 50:50.600]  Think of it. Food stamps, we got 20 billion more on food stamps in the stimulus, even though one-tenth of the U.S. population is on food stamps.
[50:50.600 --> 50:57.600]  Three million people in Texas live on food stamps. One out of every eight people in Michigan lives on food stamps.
[50:57.600 --> 51:04.600]  We could manage $20 billion for that, but $100 billion from the U.S. for the International Monetary Fund.
[51:04.600 --> 51:14.600]  The other dimension that you talk about, this world currency, it is this paper derivative, because that's the only thing you can call it, special drawing rights, SDRs.
[51:14.600 --> 51:20.600]  It started back in the 1970s. It's a basket of currencies, and they want to have more of these.
[51:20.600 --> 51:29.600]  Now, the idea then is that as we get these bailouts going, the multi-trillion dollar bailouts, very likely hyperinflation in all the national currencies,
[51:29.600 --> 51:41.600]  and then on top of that, pyramid inflation and hyperinflation with the printing press at the IMF turning out more and more trillion-dollar certificates of special drawing rights.
[51:41.600 --> 51:51.600]  So with that, they think that they can control the world, essentially buy up any assets they want, feed it into these zombie banks, keep the derivatives going, and so forth.
[51:51.600 --> 51:55.600]  Let me hasten to say, though, this is crazy. This won't work.
[51:55.600 --> 52:02.600]  They're headed for the biggest panic, the biggest disintegration. This is a bottomless depression. There is no recovery.
[52:02.600 --> 52:09.600]  There's nothing automatic that's going to cause a recovery. The recovery will come when these lunatic policies are reversed.
[52:09.600 --> 52:19.600]  Now, the other things they want to do, no protectionism. That means, suppose we get a dollar panic and everybody wants to flee the dollar.
[52:19.600 --> 52:25.600]  We would then need something like exchange controls and capital controls to save the dollar. They'd say, no, you can't do that.
[52:25.600 --> 52:31.600]  How about a modest protective tariff to protect reindustrialization here in the U.S.?
[52:31.600 --> 52:36.600]  Because if we can't use the dollar to buy things automatically, we're going to have to manufacture here.
[52:36.600 --> 52:40.600]  And they'd say, no, you can't protect yourself. Everybody's got to be free to dump.
[52:40.600 --> 52:49.600]  Look at Obama with the stimulus, $787 billion, and they said, you know what? We've got to buy all the goods from China and other countries
[52:49.600 --> 52:54.600]  if we're not allowed to buy American under World Trade Organization agreements. Congress has given up its authority.
[52:54.600 --> 52:59.600]  Meanwhile, China, with its near-slave labor, that's a built-in tariff and with their low currency.
[52:59.600 --> 53:03.600]  So this is designed to deindustrialize us and feed the real economy into Wall Street.
[53:03.600 --> 53:09.600]  That was when Tony Blair, when Gordon Brown came and gave his address to the joint session of Congress, because that's what he did.
[53:09.600 --> 53:15.600]  The big thing was, no protectionism means you can't defend yourself in any way from these things that I'm doing.
[53:15.600 --> 53:21.600]  The other thing is this global regulator. The idea is they want to have a bubble economy.
[53:21.600 --> 53:24.600]  They want to have a casino economy. They want to have more derivatives.
[53:24.600 --> 53:31.600]  But they want it to be a heroin addict with no side effects, to be a drunk and never have a hangover.
[53:31.600 --> 53:41.600]  In other words, keep this paper-based, derivatives-based, hedge fund-based casino, bloated, fictitious cancerous system, but none of the defects.
[53:41.600 --> 53:43.600]  So we have to have global risk management.
[53:43.600 --> 53:51.600]  And they're saying they're going to... Wall Street Journal reported they're gutting the old IRS tax system and getting rid of the home mortgage exemption.
[53:51.600 --> 53:58.600]  So he lied when he said only people $125,000 or more. You know, that's a spin when he says $250,000.
[53:58.600 --> 54:01.600]  That's two people together in a household. So it's a lie.
[54:01.600 --> 54:06.600]  It's not just people making $125,000 a year or more. They've now analyzed it.
[54:06.600 --> 54:17.600]  It is basically a 30% tax increase on average on even the working class and the middle class to all feed all that money directly into the offshore banks.
[54:17.600 --> 54:20.600]  So this is the true looting.
[54:20.600 --> 54:24.600]  I think you have to pose the question from the point of view of class consciousness.
[54:24.600 --> 54:29.600]  In other words, an awareness of what are the groups in society. That's all it means.
[54:29.600 --> 54:34.600]  Who should pay for this depression? This depression is going to cost several quadrillion dollars. Who should pay?
[54:34.600 --> 54:37.600]  Should the American people pay through the system that you just described?
[54:37.600 --> 54:42.600]  I would propose something else. I put out a statement to the group of 20, which goes like this.
[54:42.600 --> 54:52.600]  If you want to have an economic recovery, the first thing you have to do is take that $1.5 quadrillion, that is $1,500 trillion of derivatives,
[54:52.600 --> 54:57.600]  which are toxic with negative value, wipe them out, shred them and delete them.
[54:57.600 --> 54:59.600]  The made-off money bomb.
[54:59.600 --> 55:04.600]  Yeah, the AIG bomb. They created $3 trillion out of the $1,500 trillion.
[55:04.600 --> 55:07.600]  The point is they're a criminal class of made-offs.
[55:07.600 --> 55:10.600]  Yeah, and they're creating, it's the problem of fictitious capital.
[55:10.600 --> 55:14.600]  You're creating things that are paper instruments outside of production against production.
[55:14.600 --> 55:18.600]  But they love that. That's why they wage war with their phony environmentalism against production.
[55:18.600 --> 55:27.600]  Because this is literally a group of charlatans or magicians that create Ponzi schemes and then have world armies and world laws and world regulators
[55:27.600 --> 55:34.600]  to back up their fraud as they wage war and they admit they want to post-industrial society because any real industry or jobs
[55:34.600 --> 55:41.600]  competes with them and means the people are sovereign and aren't institutionalized dependent on their world monopoly of currency and credit.
[55:41.600 --> 55:45.600]  Right, so I say wipe them out. In other words, there's only one thing to do with derivatives.
[55:45.600 --> 55:49.600]  I shred them, delete them. You can use them for wallpaper. You can use them for wrapping fish.
[55:49.600 --> 55:53.600]  You can use them for birdcage liner. Lots of good things to do with derivatives.
[55:53.600 --> 56:00.600]  Now, somebody might say, how dare you? How dare you attack the validity of contracts and the sanctity of derivatives?
[56:00.600 --> 56:03.600]  Well, take Herbert Hoover of all people, right?
[56:03.600 --> 56:07.600]  Herbert Hoover, the most hidebound, the most impotent when it came to dealing with the Depression.
[56:07.600 --> 56:13.600]  He recognized in 1931, he said, look, you know, there are these reparations payments and these war debts.
[56:13.600 --> 56:19.600]  There's this huge mass of debt sitting in the middle of the world system that's crushing production and employment.
[56:19.600 --> 56:25.600]  If we want to get out of this depression, we better at least freeze all payments on those reparations.
[56:25.600 --> 56:30.600]  And he did. That's the famous Hoover moratorium of 1931 to 1932.
[56:30.600 --> 56:32.600]  It should have been made permanent.
[56:32.600 --> 56:39.600]  But the problem was that the conference that was held at Lausanne in Switzerland in 1932 to do something about this punted.
[56:39.600 --> 56:47.600]  They did not take any effective action. And by January 1933 Hitler seizes power and you're on the skids towards World War Two.
[56:47.600 --> 56:54.600]  So think about it, you people at the G20 and make sure your congressmen and senators know that you're thinking about this too.
[56:54.600 --> 57:01.600]  The only thing that that G20 needs to do in terms of getting clearing the decks for recovery, wipe out those derivatives.
[57:01.600 --> 57:07.600]  Don't find ways to manage them, make them better, you know, neutralize them, sanitize them.
[57:07.600 --> 57:11.600]  Wipe them out. It's like a black hole, right? 1.5 quadrillion derivatives.
[57:11.600 --> 57:16.600]  It doesn't matter what you put into it. It's still a black hole. It's still going to eat the world.
[57:16.600 --> 57:18.600]  So the only thing to do is to get rid of it.
[57:18.600 --> 57:27.600]  Well, it's admitted that the big central banks and brokerage houses have been taking a lot of the bailout money and leveraging it again with naked shorts and other derivatives because they can't help it.
[57:27.600 --> 57:38.600]  They get all the money and bonuses when the Ponzi scheme still has value in people's eyes and then they hand us the Ponzi scheme once it collapses.
[57:38.600 --> 57:51.600]  So usually a Ponzi scam artist runs off of the money. Instead, they're standing up there with North Com and the military saying, we're going to do this and if you don't like it, we'll declare martial law like they told congress on October 3rd if they didn't pass that.
[57:51.600 --> 57:58.600]  Now, one of the great inventors really of the modern derivative is this guy Scholes, right? He developed the black Scholes model of valuing derivatives.
[57:58.600 --> 58:10.600]  And he said recently in the presence of Paul Volcker at a conference in New York City, he said, you know, the current existing mass of derivatives ought to be torn up, burned out, gotten rid of.
[58:10.600 --> 58:11.600]  I would agree with that.
[58:11.600 --> 58:21.600]  Senator Warner of Virginia in the Senate and hearings a couple of weeks ago asked Bernanke, don't you think there should be a bright line prohibition of credit default swaps?
[58:21.600 --> 58:23.600]  Now, those are derivatives. Let me just tell you.
[58:23.600 --> 58:44.600]  The IRS is skimming the wealth of the American people for the Wall Street bankers. Taxpayers are being raked over the coals and forced to pay for bailout after bailout. First, we went after the Fed. Now, we're going after the Internal Revenue Service.
[58:44.600 --> 59:02.600]  We, the people, grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[59:02.600 --> 59:09.600]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency, is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.

[1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:19.600]  The space shuttle Discovery landed safely at Cape Canaveral in Florida Saturday after a 13-day mission to the International Space Station.
[1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:30.600]  An earlier landing time was canceled due to thick clouds and strong winds in the area. Mission managers later said the clouds had broken up enough and winds had shifted, making it possible to safely land Discovery.

[1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:11.600]  President Obama says more needs to be done by General Motors and Chrysler to become more, quote, lean, mean and competitive.
[1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:19.600]  Speaking to CBS Face the Nation, Obama would not give specifics on what he will announce Monday concerning more government help for the automakers.
[1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:31.600]  They're not quite there yet. There's been some serious efforts to deal with a combination of long-standing problems in the auto industry and the current crisis.
[1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:37.600]  The two companies have received $17.4 billion to date and have asked for another $22 billion.
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:46.600]  Obama said what will be needed is, quote, a set of sacrifices from all parties involved, management, labor, shareholders, creditors, suppliers and dealers.
[1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:55.600]  GM and Chrysler have renegotiated contracts with the United Auto Workers Union to reduce hourly wages to bring them close to those paid by Japanese companies in the U.S.
[1:04:55.600 --> 1:05:07.600]  GM is in talks with bondholders to reduce its $27 billion in debt by two-thirds while Chrysler is trying to restructure $5 billion of the $11 billion it owes the government and banks.
[1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:19.600]  A conservative legal group is suing the giant insurance company, American International Group, to force top executives to return at least $165 million in bonuses they were recently paid.

[1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:10.600]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:16.600]  Alright, when we start the next segment, I'll go directly to your calls from around the country and the world.
[1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:20.600]  I want to make this clear to everybody out there.
[1:07:20.600 --> 1:07:25.600]  Private banks have already engaged in fractional reserve banking for hundreds of years.
[1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:31.600]  For every dollar they have, on average, they loan out $10 of fiat, imaginary debt, then they get real assets when you default.
[1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:34.600]  They want you to default. They want third world countries to default.
[1:07:34.600 --> 1:07:38.600]  They do this over and over again throughout modern history and ancient history.
[1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:42.600]  Now they've created a whole other level of fractional reserve banking.
[1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:49.600]  These derivatives, total made up crap, that they then leverage to the sun more than all the wealth in the world many times over.
[1:07:49.600 --> 1:07:54.600]  And they buy up real assets through that fiat value, through that made up Ponzi value.
[1:07:54.600 --> 1:08:03.600]  Now they are bankrupting the world by design where they'll be the only creditors of choice when they engineered the thing with this tsunami of liquid cash.
[1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:11.600]  That's what's going on right now. They're openly all over British and European news and even some U.S. news admitting what I've been telling you for 14 years on air,
[1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:13.600]  what Webster's been talking about for decades.
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:20.600]  This is it. They should all be going to jail, not opening up a world government they run.
[1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:22.600]  But this is the culmination of all their work.
[1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:27.600]  And it's only going to get worse from here until you wake up, so the Republicans aren't going to save you.
[1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:29.600]  The Democrats aren't going to save you. They own both parties.
[1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:32.600]  They play the left-right paradigm off against each other.
[1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:35.600]  Webster, I want to go to calls and then later get into solutions.
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:40.600]  But G20, what's coming up? Obama going to the queen. What's really happening?
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:51.600]  Well, it's the world financial dictatorship, 500 billion for the IMF, hyperinflation of SDRs, a world dictatorship of regulation,
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:09:01.600]  which will be how to keep derivatives going at the expense of everything else, and no protectionism, and really no national sovereignty.
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:03.600]  So it's going to be a disaster.
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:10.600]  And they've ordered hundreds of third-world countries, they've blown out by the zombie of their own documents, to do this, like Argentina and others.
[1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:16.600]  And every time they follow the orders, things only get worse and worse and worse, but the bankers consolidate the wealth.
[1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:17.600]  I mean, I want to explain that.
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:20.600]  There may well be resistance, I think realistically.
[1:09:20.600 --> 1:09:29.600]  The Obama regime thought that they could get Europe to cough up more troops and money for this adventurous lunatic war in Afghanistan
[1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:33.600]  that Obama is so devoted to that he's trying to stir up a wider war with Pakistan.
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:41.600]  Trying to bust up Pakistan, break it up into four or five countries so it can't be an energy corridor between Iran and China.
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:47.600]  So there's resistance on the Afghan war front coming from France, Germany, Italy.
[1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:52.600]  And there also may be resistance coming from, who knows who, maybe from Russia, maybe from China.
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:53.600]  And I think all of that is welcome.
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:59.600]  Anybody who stops Obama and Gordon Brown from implementing this plan, I think, is doing the rest of us a favor.
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:00.600]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:01.600]  They always make it black and white.
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:03.600]  Like America's the good guys, these are the bad guys.
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:06.600]  No, America has been seized by a group of corrupt bankers.
[1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:07.600]  Corrupt bankers?
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:08.600]  Absolutely.
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:12.600]  So the city of London in this process, they've got their operation going.
[1:10:12.600 --> 1:10:13.600]  They would like to reemerge.
[1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:19.600]  But basically, Wall Street and the city of London are trying to reassert this dollar dictatorship over the world.
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:24.600]  And I don't think it's going to work because certainly there's an absolute physical certitude.
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:28.600]  The $1.5 quadrillion dollar derivative bubble cannot be bailed out.
[1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:30.600]  There is no power in the universe.
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:33.600]  There's not enough wealth in the entire solar system, right?
[1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:41.600]  It's $1,500 trillion compared to a world-gross domestic product of about $50 trillion.
[1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:42.600]  So do the math.
[1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:43.600]  What is it?
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:45.600]  200 times whatever.
[1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:46.600]  You got your calculator?
[1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:49.600]  It's hundreds of times the world domestic product.
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:50.600]  So impossible.
[1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:51.600]  Can't be done.
[1:10:51.600 --> 1:11:01.600]  I mean, if Madoff would have just put out a check saying he had $50 trillion, $6 billion trillion,
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:06.600]  $8 trillion, would we just honor that check and then give him our houses and our children
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:10.600]  and our labor and just say, you're a banker, you made all this fiat stuff up.
[1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:11.600]  We love you.
[1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:12.600]  We worship you.
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:13.600]  It's impossible.
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:17.600]  And it's, of course, it means, among other things, the destruction of world civilization.
[1:11:17.600 --> 1:11:23.600]  But I think before we get to that, we're going to get into this phase of dollar hyperinflation.
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:26.600]  The whole system remains based on the dollar.
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:32.600]  And with the dollar being what it is, we've got this injection of $10 trillion, $12 trillion
[1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:33.600]  in the banks.
[1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:40.600]  Just about 10 days ago, Bernanke injected $1 trillion of new liquidity into the banking
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:41.600]  system in one day.
[1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:45.600]  They do this by open market operations, in other words, by buying Treasury securities.
[1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:48.600]  So the securities come in and the cash goes out.
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:54.600]  Now, that was the biggest dive by the U.S. dollar in 25 years since 1984, 1985.
[1:11:54.600 --> 1:11:58.600]  It was the biggest dive in recent history of U.S. Treasury securities.
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:04.600]  So the tremors of hyperinflation and the panic to get out of the dollar are already coming.
[1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:08.600]  Yeah, but for people that aren't a top-degree economist like yourself, top of your class,
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:12.600]  for folks that don't understand, monetizing debt, explain what that means.
[1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:17.600]  The private Federal Reserve bought from the Treasury, backed up with U.S. taxpayer money,
[1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:18.600]  its own debt.
[1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:19.600]  Yeah.
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:24.600]  Treasury securities, right, issued by the Treasury, U.S. government obligations, the Federal
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:29.600]  Reserve Open Market Committee, which is made up precisely of these unelected, unaccountable,
[1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:34.600]  illegal bankers from the regional Federal Reserve parts that have never been approved by the
[1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:35.600]  Senate.
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:37.600]  They've never gone through any kind of federal vetting.
[1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:39.600]  They're just local regional bankers.
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:44.600]  He dumps a trillion on the market in one day, but that means then that the dollar takes
[1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:45.600]  a dive.
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:49.600]  Another one, with Geithner testifying in Congress, somebody brought up this idea saying,
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:53.600]  the Chinese have talked about a new world currency, left the cat out of the bag.
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:57.600]  And Geithner said, yeah, well, if the Chinese are talking about it, we have to take it seriously.
[1:12:57.600 --> 1:12:59.600]  The dollar fell by 1% within about an hour.
[1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:04.600]  So the nightmare of Paul Adolf Volcker, you'll remember him.
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:07.600]  He ran Carter's economic policy.
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:12.600]  22% prime rate, got the interest rates on credit cards up to where they are now.
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:15.600]  His nightmare was always a mudslide of the dollar.
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:20.100]  In other words, once a dollar panic begins, how do you stop it?
[1:13:20.100 --> 1:13:21.600]  I think that's fairly close.
[1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:26.600]  I mean, one of the things that makes gold a reasonable hedge for the average person to
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:31.100]  try to protect some assets so that you won't be left with just pieces of paper that are
[1:13:31.100 --> 1:13:32.600]  completely worthless.
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:36.600]  Now, briefly, what does it mean to have Obama going to the G20, but first dropping off to
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:37.600]  see the Queen?
[1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:40.600]  It doesn't look good, does it?
[1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:46.600]  According to my friend Phil Berg there in Philadelphia, there's a very good chance that Obama is,
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:51.600]  if not a citizen of Indonesia, he may be a citizen of Kenya.
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:55.600]  And the point is that he's fully compromised with all these mafia and thugs.
[1:13:55.600 --> 1:13:58.600]  So speak what this means going to the Queen.
[1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:04.600]  Obama's grandfather was the house servant to Lord Delamere, who was the biggest British
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:07.100]  imperialist in Kenya between the World Wars.
[1:14:07.100 --> 1:14:09.600]  You remember Cecil Rhodes in South Africa.
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:12.600]  Lord Delamere was a person of similar caliber.
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:14.600]  He was a very important British operative.
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:16.600]  So Obama is in there.
[1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:21.600]  It's interesting, when Gordon Brown came to visit Obama, the right-wing talk show host,
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:26.600]  the various limbo's and Hannity's, went nuts over the idea, Obama snubbed Gordon Brown.
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:29.600]  He didn't give him the kind of heroes welcome that he deserved.
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:33.600]  Well, I think some of that was a dog and pony show because the main idea is that Gordon
[1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:36.600]  Brown is the pioneer of all the bailouts.
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:38.600]  It was Northern Rock.
[1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:43.600]  This bank in Britain and in Ireland began to blow up in October of 2007.
[1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:47.600]  That's when Gordon Brown, before any other government in the world had done it, said,
[1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:50.600]  here's several hundred billion pounds, not even dollars, but pounds.
[1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:51.600]  That's double.
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:53.600]  Yeah, well, one and a half maybe.
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:55.600]  Well, that time it was double.
[1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:56.600]  That time it was double.
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:57.600]  Here we go.
[1:14:57.600 --> 1:14:58.600]  But hold on.
[1:14:58.600 --> 1:14:59.600]  I want to back you up on this.
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:05.600]  I watched hours online from the European Union official website of the parliamentary
[1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:07.600]  meetings he had for two days earlier this week.
[1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:09.600]  We played clips on the radio during the week.
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:10.600]  Folks heard it.
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:17.600]  They openly in Europe worshipped him and said, you are the architect of the New World Order.
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:20.600]  You are running it all and we're bowing to him.
[1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:24.600]  Now I heard you months ago on my show say he was on showing it, so you were right.
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:30.600]  Yeah, I think that the conceptual leadership of the entire process, this monstrous thing
[1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:34.600]  that we've been talking about, right, between what Geithner is doing and what the G20 is
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:39.600]  going to do, the beefing up of the IMF, the currency dictatorship, the SDRs, the world
[1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:41.600]  currency, all the rest of this stuff.
[1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:43.600]  It's all nuts, of course, in the last analysis.
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:49.600]  But this is Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling at the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Office
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:51.600]  and Mervyn King of the Bank of England.
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:56.600]  And they're reasserting this idea that the real center of the financial world is London.
[1:15:56.600 --> 1:15:58.600]  New York is collapsing.
[1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:05.600]  They like to think that the bankruptcy of places like Poland, Belarus, Ukraine are going to
[1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:08.600]  pull down the banks in Austria and Germany and France.
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:11.600]  The Euro may well collapse as a result of that.
[1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:14.600]  And that would leave London sitting pretty, right?
[1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:18.600]  Dollar collapsed, Euro collapsed, London leading the world once again.
[1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:23.600]  So the empire is back with Gordon Brown and Obama is a stooge for this.
[1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:27.600]  All right, we'll be back with Webster Tarbley and your phone call straight ahead.
[1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:29.600]  Folks, what you're hearing is absolute precision.
[1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:30.600]  We know what's going on.
[1:16:30.600 --> 1:16:32.600]  We told you years before it happened.
[1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:37.600]  Travelers and your independent editors from Midas Resources, March 27, 2009.
[1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:39.600]  Goal open at $9.3490.
[1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:46.600]  An ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.6170, $6.4888 for half and $2.4044 for quarter.
[1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:58.600]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority
[1:16:58.600 --> 1:17:02.600]  to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government
[1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:03.600]  and interest.
[1:17:03.600 --> 1:17:06.600]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[1:17:06.600 --> 1:17:09.600]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:12.600]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:15.600]  Midas has the Kennedy versus Fed document.

[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:37.600]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:39.600]  problems facing the U.S. and the world.

[1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:13.600]  Other companies do not even offer a catalog.

[1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:36.600]  By Alex Jones here with a question, what does humidity mean to you?

[1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:39.600]  In fact, it's getting worse.

[1:20:46.600 --> 1:20:49.600]  Good old Aaron Nyhart.
[1:20:49.600 --> 1:20:51.600]  Aaron Dykes, Rob Jacobson.
[1:20:51.600 --> 1:20:55.600]  We're in here filming today for the next Obama film.
[1:20:55.600 --> 1:20:56.600]  It's coming out July 4.
[1:20:56.600 --> 1:20:58.600]  Tell you more about it in the name of the new film next week.
[1:20:58.600 --> 1:20:59.600]  That's right.
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:03.600]  We're hitting them hard with a jab to the nose and then a big hook.
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:04.600]  A haymaker.
[1:21:04.600 --> 1:21:06.600]  Yeah, a haymaker, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:10.600]  So let's go ahead and tell you what's coming up after we take some calls.
[1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:12.600]  Mandatory service bill lives on.
[1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:14.600]  That is coming up.
[1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:16.600]  Webster, let's go to some phone calls.
[1:21:16.600 --> 1:21:19.600]  Folks have been patiently holding them so they're all over the map.
[1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:21.600]  The phone's loaded the second we started the show.
[1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:23.600]  Let's talk to Joe in Houston.
[1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:25.600]  You're on the year worldwide, Joe.
[1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:27.600]  Gentlemen, I admire your courage.
[1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:31.600]  I want to debunk the global warming hoax.
[1:21:31.600 --> 1:21:33.600]  The cause of climate change.
[1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:37.600]  The major cause is geonuclear, which comes out of the center of the earth,
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:39.600]  has absolutely nothing to do with carbon.
[1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:43.600]  The real study shows the sun is the major climate.
[1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:47.600]  I dispute that, but I'm going to send you a scientific paper that I've prepared on this.
[1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:49.600]  I'm an engineer.
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:53.600]  I'm not debating you that geothermal has a message.
[1:21:53.600 --> 1:21:55.600]  We'll discuss that at a future time.
[1:21:55.600 --> 1:21:59.600]  What their claim is, and they're hanging their hat on,
[1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:04.600]  is that the current level of carbon dioxide, 370 parts per million,
[1:22:04.600 --> 1:22:07.600]  is going to increase by five, and that's going to be a problem.
[1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:09.600]  Let me put that in physical terms.
[1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:12.600]  It's been 14 times higher before from the ice core samples.
[1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:13.600]  Yes, sir.
[1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:19.600]  A million BBs is 20 gallons of BBs.
[1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:23.600]  These people are telling you, if you add five more BBs, you've got a huge problem.
[1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:26.600]  Carbon is absolutely necessary.
[1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:28.600]  Carbon dioxide is absolutely necessary.
[1:22:28.600 --> 1:22:30.600]  We are carbon-based life forms.
[1:22:30.600 --> 1:22:31.600]  I'm going to let you finish up.
[1:22:31.600 --> 1:22:32.600]  I'm going to let you finish up.
[1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:34.600]  I'm going to get Webster, who's an expert on this, Webster.
[1:22:34.600 --> 1:22:38.600]  I'm going to email you my scientific analysis of this thing.
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:39.600]  You'll be interested.
[1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:42.600]  I mean, to be clear, though, Caller, Joe, and I agree with you,
[1:22:42.600 --> 1:22:45.600]  they've had thousands, what, 30-something thousand scientists
[1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:48.600]  have sent letters to the UN, engineers, climatologists saying it's a fraud.
[1:22:48.600 --> 1:22:52.600]  The 2000 the UN had, most of them went back on it saying they just put our names on this.
[1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:54.600]  They know it's a scam, sir.
[1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:57.600]  They know that carbon dioxide is good and plants breathe it.
[1:22:57.600 --> 1:23:00.600]  They know that the earth heats first.
[1:23:00.600 --> 1:23:05.600]  What I've done for you, Alex, is I've put all this in a five-page coherent form
[1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:09.600]  that you can post on your website that anybody with a decent high school education
[1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:13.600]  will be able to understand and argue with anybody that's still a Kool-Aid trigger.
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:15.600]  Give me a favor, Joe, send it to Rob D.
[1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:16.600]  That's one of my producers.
[1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:17.600]  Rob D.
[1:23:17.600 --> 1:23:20.600]  Just a letter D at infowars.com.
[1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:22.600]  I don't want to hang up on you yet.
[1:23:22.600 --> 1:23:25.600]  Break down what's really happening with the global climate tax,
[1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:28.600]  taxing the very carbon cycle of terra firma.
[1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:32.600]  Well, it amounts to a tax on production.
[1:23:32.600 --> 1:23:36.600]  In other words, physical, tangible commodity production, useful goods,
[1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:42.600]  things you can eat, wear, drive, live in, use as a machine tool, anything of this sort.
[1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:44.600]  That's where the carbon tax is going to fall.
[1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:48.600]  It's designed really to crush what remains of an industrial economy,
[1:23:48.600 --> 1:23:49.600]  especially in the U.S.
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:52.600]  And the IMF and World Bank and the Club of Rome state this.
[1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:55.600]  They're waging war against any real economy.
[1:23:55.600 --> 1:24:01.600]  And at the same time, it's also designed to make these other marginal forms of energy production,
[1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:05.600]  the windmills or solar cells, which are anti-economical,
[1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:07.600]  to make them look as if they're actually economical.
[1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:12.600]  Remember, with a windmiller or solar cell, you never break even in energy terms.
[1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:16.600]  In other words, the energy you've got to put into manufacture it, you'll never get out of it.
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:21.600]  And also, in monetary terms, you won't get the money out of it that you spend for creating it.
[1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:23.600]  So, it's an entire scam.
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:29.600]  Now, what does this really express is sort of the eternal insanity of the oligarch and the banker.
[1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:32.600]  Al Gore, of course, is a crackpot and a charlatan.
[1:24:32.600 --> 1:24:38.600]  And I welcome what you're saying because it shows that indeed the debate is not over, Al Gore.
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:40.600]  There's a very lively debate going on.
[1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:41.600]  Yeah, finish up, finish up, John.
[1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:47.600]  As far as the Sun, the Earth rotates and ellipses around the Sun where 91 to 93 million miles.
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:49.600]  That's a 2% difference in distance.
[1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:52.600]  But radiation is based on a square of a distance.
[1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:54.600]  So, that's actually a 4% difference.
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:58.600]  Every year, we experienced in solar radiation without doing anything.
[1:24:58.600 --> 1:24:59.600]  And so, we can...
[1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:01.600]  And let me stop you.
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:04.600]  But solar radiation is not a constant.
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:05.600]  The Sun is heating.
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:10.600]  No, the geonuclear force is not constant either.
[1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:12.600]  We've got uranium that's down in the center of the Earth.
[1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:13.600]  It's decomposing.
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:15.600]  It's creating a lot of internal heat.
[1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:20.600]  It melts rock within just several miles of the surface of the Earth.
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:22.600]  It blows tons of atmosphere out of the way.
[1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:23.600]  It allows...
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:27.600]  When the reactions slow down, it allows the whole planet to be covered with ice.
[1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:29.600]  When it warms up, it melts that whole ice in 100...
[1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:30.600]  No, no.
[1:25:30.600 --> 1:25:31.600]  I've seen those studies...
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:33.600]  In other than 100 years.
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:35.600]  Engineer, I've seen those studies.
[1:25:35.600 --> 1:25:36.600]  I understand that.
[1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:40.600]  I've been reading what the climatologists and solar experts say.
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:45.600]  Certainly, geothermal and volcanic alone, one small part of the geothermal system,
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:47.600]  dwarfs all human activity alone.
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:49.600]  So, I agree that you're right in that.
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:53.600]  I'm saying the Sun itself is a much larger driver in whole,
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:58.600]  not just with its overall radiation, but the particular particles that come in
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:02.600]  for cloud seeding in the mid-atmosphere.
[1:26:02.600 --> 1:26:07.600]  I would also say that the solar activity is the one that I find most convincing.
[1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:12.600]  You've got to think about Eric the Red and Leif Erickson and these people coming to Newfoundland
[1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:13.600]  and calling it Vineland.
[1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:16.600]  Well, that means that we're nowhere near as warm as it was.
[1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:20.600]  Yeah, Greenland's ice today, but they called it Greenland and reported it was all green.
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:21.600]  Right.
[1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:26.600]  So, I think we're very well within the oscillation band of just historical records
[1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:28.600]  of the last 1,000 or 1,500 years.
[1:26:28.600 --> 1:26:32.600]  And the Sun just cooled two years ago from a record hot cycle,
[1:26:32.600 --> 1:26:37.600]  so now the planets like Mars that had the ice caps shrinking, the ice caps are expanding.
[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:39.600]  Yeah, so I think solar activity.
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:44.600]  But above all, there's no reason to destroy world civilization in the name of some crackpot theory
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:47.600]  promoted by Al Gore and, of course, his best friend, Prince Charles.
[1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:51.600]  And, by the way, it's come out that there's a carbon exchange in Chicago
[1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:55.600]  that Barack Obama owns part of and Al Gore literally owns the majority stock
[1:26:55.600 --> 1:26:58.600]  in the big European carbon trading.
[1:26:58.600 --> 1:27:01.600]  So, you're going to buy your carbon indulgences from Al Gore.
[1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:05.600]  What they're going to do is, once this carbon cap and trade exists, if it ever does,
[1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:08.600]  that will be a way for Goldman Sachs to come in.
[1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:10.600]  Now, Goldman Sachs has got the number two guy.
[1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:14.600]  Geithner's right-hand man is this guy, Patterson,
[1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:17.600]  who's the green economist from Goldman Sachs.
[1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:20.600]  So, once the carbon offsets exist, they can bid them up
[1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:23.600]  and that will shut down all of industrial production
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:27.600]  because the price will go up as the hedge funds move in and buy these things.
[1:27:27.600 --> 1:27:32.600]  So, a speculative market in carbon offsets leading to the end of production as we've known it.
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:33.600]  Let's take another call quickly.
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:34.600]  Barry in California.
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:35.600]  Barry, go ahead.
[1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:37.600]  How are you guys doing today?
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:40.600]  I really appreciate you having Wesley on today.
[1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:42.600]  He really hit his nail.
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:43.600]  I'll call him Wesley.
[1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:44.600]  Thank you.
[1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:45.600]  He's Leslie.
[1:27:45.600 --> 1:27:46.600]  Austin Zeichner.
[1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:48.600]  Yeah, go ahead.
[1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:50.600]  I want to tell you what I'm going to do this week.
[1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:53.600]  I'm going to make a sign and I'm going to say,
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:28:00.600]  wake up, we the people, where is the, you know, the madness of what's going on?
[1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:10.600]  Don't look at the $160 million bonus, but look at the $10 trillion biggest bankruptcy
[1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:13.600]  of the American taxpayer.
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:17.600]  And then I'm going to put, check out the number one video online,
[1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:20.600]  Obama deception on YouTube.
[1:28:20.600 --> 1:28:22.600]  And now I'm going to have info wars.com,
[1:28:22.600 --> 1:28:26.600]  repent before it's too late and repent.
[1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:28.600]  The canonical repentance is destroy all derivatives,
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:31.600]  shred them, delete them and no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:33.600]  Instead of getting the bankers in trouble, Webster,
[1:28:33.600 --> 1:28:36.600]  I will, I will buy indulgences, carbon indulgences.
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:40.600]  But I just understand what Wesley's saying.
[1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:42.600]  I understand what it's on the Obama deception.
[1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:44.600]  I've been passing out left and right.
[1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:49.600]  And I asked people to look at it objectively and with an open mind.
[1:28:49.600 --> 1:28:53.600]  And I let him know that you break up the left and the right paradigm
[1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:55.600]  and that they haven't had to understand.
[1:28:55.600 --> 1:28:57.600]  They have to educate themselves on what's going on.
[1:28:57.600 --> 1:28:59.600]  And I said, this movie will open your eyes.
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:00.600]  Good job.
[1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:01.600]  My friend, good to hear from you.
[1:29:01.600 --> 1:29:03.600]  We don't have time to take another call right now.
[1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:04.600]  We're going to come back.
[1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:05.600]  I got a race to your calls to get to everybody.

[1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:38.600]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[1:30:38.600 --> 1:30:40.600]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[1:30:40.600 --> 1:30:42.600]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[1:30:42.600 --> 1:30:45.600]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[1:30:45.600 --> 1:30:48.600]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country,
[1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:50.600]  and it's possible that could even happen again.
[1:30:50.600 --> 1:30:52.600]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[1:30:52.600 --> 1:30:55.600]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[1:30:55.600 --> 1:30:58.600]  They call it a survival seed bank,
[1:30:58.600 --> 1:31:03.600]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:04.600]  And here's the best part.
[1:31:04.600 --> 1:31:07.600]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[1:31:07.600 --> 1:31:11.600]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden.
[1:31:11.600 --> 1:31:14.600]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[1:31:14.600 --> 1:31:16.600]  That's survivalseedbank.com,
[1:31:16.600 --> 1:31:21.600]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[1:31:21.600 --> 1:31:25.600]  That's 877-327-0365.
[1:31:25.600 --> 1:31:30.600]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:33.600]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[1:32:01.600 --> 1:32:03.600]  To raise the pH to the ultimate level,
[1:32:03.600 --> 1:32:06.600]  alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste
[1:32:06.600 --> 1:32:09.600]  and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:12.600]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive
[1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:15.600]  in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[1:32:15.600 --> 1:32:18.600]  Order your bottle of Alkavision Plasma pH drops now
[1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:21.600]  by going directly to alkavision.com.
[1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:23.600]  That's alkavision.com,
[1:32:23.600 --> 1:32:28.600]  or by calling 269-216-9767.
[1:32:28.600 --> 1:32:32.600]  269-216-9767 today.
[1:32:32.600 --> 1:32:35.600]  Spring is here, growing season.
[1:32:35.600 --> 1:32:37.600]  The economy is not getting any better.
[1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:39.600]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[1:32:39.600 --> 1:32:40.600]  Think about it.
[1:32:40.600 --> 1:32:44.600]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[1:32:44.600 --> 1:32:46.600]  Maybe you've been putting things off,
[1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:48.600]  but the time to act is now.
[1:32:48.600 --> 1:32:50.600]  The country is running out of food.
[1:32:50.600 --> 1:32:53.600]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[1:32:53.600 --> 1:32:58.600]  At alkacede.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections
[1:32:58.600 --> 1:33:00.600]  of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs,
[1:33:00.600 --> 1:33:02.600]  as well as the giant vegetable seed collections
[1:33:02.600 --> 1:33:05.600]  that can feed you and your family for years.
[1:33:05.600 --> 1:33:07.600]  Grow your very own fresh vegetables,
[1:33:07.600 --> 1:33:12.600]  wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice, tea, coffee and tobacco
[1:33:12.600 --> 1:33:15.600]  with detailed growing guides available to you at no charge.
[1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:19.600]  You can maximize your harvest and investment.
[1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:20.600]  And the best part?
[1:33:20.600 --> 1:33:22.600]  All orders ship within 24 hours.
[1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:24.600]  So head over to alkacede.com.
[1:33:24.600 --> 1:33:29.600]  That's O-R-G-A-N-I-C-A seed.com.
[1:33:29.600 --> 1:33:32.600]  Alkacede.com today.
[1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:37.600]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:41.600]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:46.600]  The preacher man says it's the end of time
[1:33:46.600 --> 1:33:52.600]  and the Mississippi River, she's a gold cry.
[1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:55.600]  If we have any future,
[1:33:55.600 --> 1:33:59.600]  we're going to expose the criminal parasite bankers.
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:01.600]  As Thomas Jefferson said,
[1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:04.600]  if you were ever to stop the bankers,
[1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:06.600]  they would just, with a shrug of a pen,
[1:34:06.600 --> 1:34:09.600]  create enough money to buy out the world again overnight.
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:11.600]  To paraphrase.
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:13.600]  And this country's entire history
[1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:15.600]  has been about the struggle against the bankers.
[1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:18.600]  I want to go to the phone calls right back to the calls,
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:20.600]  but Webster Tarpoli specifically on that issue.
[1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:23.600]  I mean, the founding fathers, the people that came after it,
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:25.600]  Lincoln, so many others,
[1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:28.600]  they continually fought against offshore British bankers
[1:34:28.600 --> 1:34:30.600]  coming in and taking over this country.
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:31.600]  Can you speak to that briefly?
[1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:33.600]  Well, in economics,
[1:34:33.600 --> 1:34:36.600]  there's something called the American system of political economy,
[1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:38.600]  which is homegrown and it's the only successful one.
[1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:40.600]  All the other schools are basically British
[1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:42.600]  or some other foreign version.
[1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:45.600]  Now, it's Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts.
[1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:48.600]  It's Benjamin Franklin, the founder of the Post Office.
[1:34:48.600 --> 1:34:50.600]  Alexander Hamilton is the leading light of this
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:51.600]  and there's just no way around it.
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:53.600]  There's no way you can edit him out of the history.
[1:34:53.600 --> 1:34:56.600]  Henry Clay of Kentucky, Abraham Lincoln,
[1:34:56.600 --> 1:34:58.600]  a follower of him, but also some theoreticians.
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:01.600]  Friedrich List, who built all the railroads in Austria
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:03.600]  before coming to Redding, Pennsylvania,
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:04.600]  becoming a citizen.
[1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:06.600]  Henry Carey, the big advisor to Lincoln.
[1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:10.600]  Justin Morrill, who built the Transcontinental Railroads.
[1:35:10.600 --> 1:35:12.600]  Then you get these prairie populists
[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:14.600]  and finally you get the New Deal.
[1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:15.600]  The New Deal has a lot of this in it
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:17.600]  and the attempt to revive that under Kennedy.
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:21.600]  So you either have progress and upward mobility
[1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:23.600]  or you collapse into dark ages.
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:25.600]  Right, that's the imperative that civilization faces.
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:27.600]  Now, one of the things is you've got to gear up
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:32.600]  scientific, technological, industrial progress.
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:35.600]  There's no way you get out of this just by tinkering with money.
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:37.600]  You've got to have things like a program
[1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:40.600]  for the exploration, permanent colonization,
[1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:43.600]  and industrial production on the moon, Mars,
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:45.600]  and other nearby objects in space.
[1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:47.600]  You've got to have a program of research
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:49.600]  into high-energy physics, so you get...
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:50.600]  Here's an example of peer research.
[1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:51.600]  Look at the Internet.
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:53.600]  We would have no economy if it wasn't for that.
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:55.600]  And Rockefeller and the rest,
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:35:57.600]  Jay Rockefeller's talking about incident hearings,
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:35:59.600]  saying we're going to shut the web down.
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:00.600]  It's a terrible thing.
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:01.600]  We're going to talk more about that,
[1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:02.600]  but I've got to go to calls right now.
[1:36:02.600 --> 1:36:04.600]  Tony in North Dakota, you're on the air.
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:05.600]  Go ahead.
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:08.600]  Hello, this is Tony.
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:10.600]  I'm here at the flood,
[1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:14.600]  and the military has been dispatched,
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:17.600]  and they've been evacuating places that haven't been
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:21.600]  and been arresting random people who've been...
[1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:24.600]  going through areas that haven't been going...
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:25.600]  That's right. Any excuse now?
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:27.600]  DWI checkpoints.
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:29.600]  The mass shooting in Alabama.
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:31.600]  Troops show up as they set the precedent
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:32.600]  for this.
[1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:35.600]  I'd like to hear more from the caller.
[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:40.600]  I even have pictures of a black helicopter.
[1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:41.600]  It's in the news, Webster,
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:43.600]  that they're using troops basically for anything.
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:44.600]  Yeah, I'm sure they are,
[1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:47.600]  but so what's going on with the flood?
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:48.600]  What's the flood?
[1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:49.600]  Yeah, the flood.
[1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:51.600]  You said you're from the flood area, right?
[1:36:51.600 --> 1:36:52.600]  Yeah.
[1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:53.600]  Yeah.
[1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:58.600]  The snow, we got like a three-day blizzard end.
[1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:01.600]  We got like five feet and it melted in.
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:03.600]  Global warming's hitting you hard.
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:05.600]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:07.600]  We need a whole bunch of that right now.
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:09.600]  I would say one of the things you could do
[1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:11.600]  as a stimulus project is to rebuild
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:13.600]  the levees, dykes, and water systems
[1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:14.600]  so you wouldn't have flooding.
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:15.600]  How about that?
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:16.600]  Yeah, humans need goals.
[1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:17.600]  Thank you, caller.
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:18.600]  Sorry to hear about that.
[1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:19.600]  There's floods everywhere.
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:21.600]  Let's go ahead and talk to in this record cold weather
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:22.600]  because of global warming.
[1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:24.600]  Hamilton in Colorado, you're on the air.
[1:37:24.600 --> 1:37:25.600]  Go ahead.
[1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:30.600]  Hey, I hope that both of you celebrated Earth Hour yesterday.
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:32.600]  Yeah, they turned off lights all over the world
[1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:34.600]  teaching us lights and fire,
[1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:37.600]  and they're trying to restrict fireplaces in Europe.
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:39.600]  And again, we've got to have feudal lords
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:41.600]  that rule every facet of our lives.
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:43.600]  And if you don't do it,
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:45.600]  then it must mean you want the planet to burn up.
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:47.600]  Well, I actually set that one out,
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:49.600]  and I'm wondering whether Al Gore turned off
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:53.600]  his heated pool and his energy guzzling house
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:54.600]  that he's got down there.
[1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:55.600]  Well, he's got about five houses,
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:37:57.600]  but he does have a 9,000-square-foot one
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:37:59.600]  that uses about 10 times
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:01.600]  the energy of the average home, but that's okay.
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:02.600]  Right.
[1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:03.600]  Well, he's an oligarch.
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:05.600]  Well, I mean, he buys carbon offset credits
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:08.600]  from his own company, so it's okay.
[1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:09.600]  Right.
[1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:11.600]  And of course, carbon offsets are carbon offsets
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:12.600]  that never happened in the world.
[1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:13.600]  In other words, they say,
[1:38:13.600 --> 1:38:15.600]  yeah, we planted an acre of grass in Africa,
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:18.600]  but don't go over there because it never happened.
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:20.600]  It's a complete scam.
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:22.600]  He's basically in the same league with Madoff.
[1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:24.600]  Madoff's investments in Al Gore's carbon offsets
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:26.600]  are in the same league.
[1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:30.600]  I was looking at their website for Earth Hour,
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:32.600]  and I was looking at supporters,
[1:38:32.600 --> 1:38:34.600]  and it showed the logo of the United Nations
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:37.600]  and the WWF, and of course,
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:41.600]  WWF was the first president,
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:43.600]  I believe Prince Bernhardt,
[1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:45.600]  who also happened to be the founder
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:47.600]  of the Boulder Bird Group.
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:48.600]  Anna Nazi.
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:38:49.600]  Yeah, Anna Nazi.
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:50.600]  He was a member of the brown shirts,
[1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:53.600]  the SA, and of the black shirts, the SS.
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:55.600]  So he was a leading Nazi,
[1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:57.600]  and it was Prince Bernhardt of Holland
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:38:59.600]  who joined together with Prince Philip,
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:00.600]  who's the guy who wants to come back
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:02.600]  as a deadly virus to kill people
[1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:05.600]  and solve the problem of overpopulation.
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:06.600]  And that's right.
[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:08.600]  And when you say that to people,
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:10.600]  it's funny that he's so outrageous
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:12.600]  they immediately say you're full of it.
[1:39:12.600 --> 1:39:13.600]  Oh, well, that's Reuters,
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:14.600]  and he always says,
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:16.600]  I want to come back as a deadly virus.
[1:39:16.600 --> 1:39:17.600]  And we have, don't forget Prince Charles.
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:19.600]  He says, he talks to his plants.
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:20.600]  I guess anybody can talk to their plants,
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:22.600]  but then he says, they answer me.
[1:39:22.600 --> 1:39:24.600]  My plants answer me back.
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:26.600]  Obama will be visiting the Queen,
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:28.600]  Prince Philip, and Prince Charles
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:30.600]  this coming week.
[1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:31.600]  So we'll see what comes out of that.
[1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:32.600]  Sir, good to hear from you.
[1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:34.600]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Tampa.
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:36.600]  Florida, you're on the air, Chris.
[1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:38.600]  It was a great show on Saturday.
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:40.600]  There's no doubt there's plenty of oil,
[1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:43.600]  and I didn't know how to say biotic,
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:45.600]  but there are many university studies
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:47.600]  also showing that there's more seismic activity,
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:51.600]  including tsunami in areas of greater oil drilling.
[1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:54.600]  Now, about Obama, during his campaign,
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:39:56.600]  he tried to contrast himself from McCain
[1:39:56.600 --> 1:39:57.600]  by saying that lobbyists
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:39:59.600]  wouldn't fund his campaign
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:00.600]  or be in his White House.
[1:40:00.600 --> 1:40:02.600]  And when I called in last Sunday
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:06.600]  to my local community sponsor, Radio Station,
[1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:09.600]  they told me about politifact.com,
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:11.600]  and it just proved my point.
[1:40:11.600 --> 1:40:15.600]  They go over 500 of his campaign promises,
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:18.600]  433 of which he has not yet taken action,
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:19.600]  may thankfully so,
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:23.600]  such as forcing participation in 401k and IRAs.
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:26.600]  And he also promised to investigate
[1:40:26.600 --> 1:40:27.600]  political conflict of interest
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:29.600]  between crediting agencies
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:31.600]  and financial institutions.
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:35.600]  But, you know, regarding the lobbyists,
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:38.600]  on their whole bonneter,
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:40.600]  just like a newspaper to drop vowels,
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:44.600]  they talk about the PSYOP,
[1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:45.600]  I would call it,
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:46.600]  after he took office,
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:48.600]  he signed the executive order on the lobbyists
[1:40:48.600 --> 1:40:51.600]  allowing him, the president,
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:53.600]  to sign waivers arbitrarily
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:56.600]  and otherwise, if they didn't have a waiver,
[1:40:56.600 --> 1:40:59.600]  they would have to voluntarily recuse themselves
[1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:02.600]  from dealing in issues that are related
[1:41:02.600 --> 1:41:04.600]  to the interests of their former lobby.
[1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:06.600]  And he also promised during the campaign
[1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:08.600]  an online database of ethics
[1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:10.600]  and lobbying information
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:12.600]  which would presumably include waiver
[1:41:12.600 --> 1:41:13.600]  and recusal data.
[1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:14.600]  Well, don't hold your breath
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:15.600]  because he always does
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:17.600]  the opposite of what he says.
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:18.600]  Well, sure.
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:21.600]  I think Obama is going to rewrite his memoir there.
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:23.600]  He called it the Audacity of Hope.
[1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:27.600]  He's going to recast that as the mendacity of dope
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:30.600]  based on the fact that he welshes on all of his promises.
[1:41:30.600 --> 1:41:32.600]  Well, truth you can deceive him.
[1:41:32.600 --> 1:41:34.600]  Mark Patterson, the chief of staff
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:36.600]  to the treasury secretary,
[1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:37.600]  public records,
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:39.600]  we know that Patterson worked as a lobbyist
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:41.600]  for Goldman Sachs in 2008.
[1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:43.600]  Well, I mean, look at the chief of staff
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:44.600]  for the White House.
[1:41:44.600 --> 1:41:45.600]  He comes off Wall Street
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:47.600]  as a big getting paid 17 million a year
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:48.600]  scamming people.
[1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:50.600]  And at the same time,
[1:41:50.600 --> 1:41:53.600]  take Senator Dodd's wife at AIG
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:55.600]  getting the money that he put in there
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:41:58.600]  as a little loophole for the bonuses
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:00.600]  while he's out saying he's fighting the bonuses
[1:42:00.600 --> 1:42:01.600]  and he's the author of them.
[1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:04.600]  I mean, these people are congenital liars.
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:06.600]  And I'd recommend you link to the story
[1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:07.600]  at politifact.com.
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:09.600]  I don't see that you do right now,
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:11.600]  but it's probably campaign promise 240
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:13.600]  regarding the lobbyists.
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:16.600]  And they asked the White House press office,
[1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:18.600]  this is a web support effect
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:19.600]  is run by the same people,
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:21.600]  which I don't, I'm not particularly fond of.
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:25.600]  They're not, they're more dishonest.
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:27.600]  No, I know if you go to politifact,
[1:42:27.600 --> 1:42:29.600]  it's just he lies about everything congenitally.
[1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:30.600]  And you know, Webster,
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:31.600]  that's the point we've got to make
[1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:32.600]  when I complete the interview after the show.
[1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:34.600]  We're going to keep taping in here.
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:35.600]  But I mean, literally,
[1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:38.600]  it's like the super lobbyist administration.
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:39.600]  It's amazing.
[1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:41.600]  He said he wouldn't hire one of them though, Webster.
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:43.600]  Well, he always was taking money
[1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:45.600]  from people who were in the same law firm.
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:47.600]  And they would say if a mega law firm
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:49.600]  had one or two designated lobbyists,
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:50.600]  he wouldn't take it from them,
[1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:51.600]  but the rest of them could bundle
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:53.600]  and then take it from others.
[1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:54.600]  So it's basically word games.
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:42:56.600]  Anyway, this doesn't get us anywhere.
[1:42:56.600 --> 1:43:00.600]  The point is that this is the most controlled
[1:43:00.600 --> 1:43:02.600]  administration by Wall Street,
[1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:04.600]  I think in all of American history, by far.
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:07.600]  In other words, it's a place where there's only one interest.
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:10.600]  It's the banking financier derivatives hedge fund interest
[1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:12.600]  and people like heavy industry,
[1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:14.600]  they have to grovel, right?
[1:43:14.600 --> 1:43:15.600]  They have to show they're viable.
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:16.600]  Yeah, let's talk about,
[1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:18.600]  they have to prove that they're viable
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:20.600]  with the car companies,
[1:43:20.600 --> 1:43:21.600]  but the bankers, they get it all.
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:22.600]  Stay there.
[1:43:22.600 --> 1:43:24.600]  We'll also tell you about mandatory service bill lives on.
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:26.600]  You want a national draft for you and your family?
[1:43:26.600 --> 1:43:29.600]  Get ready, Obama is bringing slavery back in
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:31.600]  supposedly ended in the 1860s.
[1:43:31.600 --> 1:43:33.600]  It's back under hair Obama.
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:36.600]  If you owe the IRS,
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:38.600]  you can't make the problem go away
[1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:39.600]  without professional help.
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:41.600]  But with the help of Dan Pilla,
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:43.600]  you can get your problem solved.
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:44.600]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla

[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:55.600]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:43:57.600]  because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness,
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:43:59.600]  the vast majority of the time,

[1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:03.600]  so you pay no taxes on what the IRS
[1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:05.600]  will consider to be taxable income.

[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:40.600]  One thing we cannot afford

[1:47:58.600 --> 1:48:00.600]  The bankers get arrested
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:02.600]  the new order falls
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:04.600]  a new incredible age
[1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:06.600]  renaissance can begin
[1:48:06.600 --> 1:48:08.600]  or we're going into a new dark age
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:10.600]  aren't we?
[1:48:10.600 --> 1:48:12.600]  If you thought Obama was going to be the key
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:14.600]  to getting out of this
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:16.600]  it's been a terrible mistake
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:18.600]  it's been a bogus sham
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:20.600]  and a cruel hook.
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:22.600]  Obama turns out to be the deployment
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:24.600]  of the bankers to make sure there would be
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:26.600]  no solution for the crisis
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:28.600]  and the endless bailouts
[1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:30.600]  of the derivatives and endless war
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:32.600]  and imperialism around the world
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:34.600]  and endless dictatorship at home.
[1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:36.600]  Next issue we'll take a few final calls
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:38.600]  you wrote a book
[1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:40.600]  a year ago about this showing mandatory service
[1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:42.600]  from their own writings what they were planning
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:44.600]  they've passed
[1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:46.600]  the bills for national compulsory service last week
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:48.600]  we barely got stripped out
[1:48:48.600 --> 1:48:50.600]  compulsory service
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:52.600]  but now they've introduced another bill
[1:48:52.600 --> 1:48:54.600]  and everything's racing through by two-thirds majorities
[1:48:54.600 --> 1:48:56.600]  this bill lives on infowars.com
[1:48:56.600 --> 1:48:58.600]  but we linked with the Associated Press
[1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:00.600]  it seemed like a victory of sorts last week
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:02.600]  the Senate approved a bill to radically expand
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:04.600]  the AmeriCorps program
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:06.600]  the bill initially contained language
[1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:08.600]  proposed a study for mandatory service
[1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:10.600]  for all young people in the United States
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:12.600]  but the language was removed as the bill moved
[1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:14.600]  through the Senate and did not appear in the final version
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:16.600]  well it's back
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:18.600]  the language was stripped from one bill
[1:49:18.600 --> 1:49:20.600]  but it suddenly appeared in another
[1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:22.600]  it's now contained in HR1444
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:24.600]  across the House floor this week
[1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:26.600]  HR1444
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:28.600]  is sponsored by Representative Jim McDermott
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:30.600]  a Washington State Democrat
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:32.600]  and is assigned to the House Committee on Labor and Education
[1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:34.600]  and has word for word
[1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:36.600]  what was in the other bill
[1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:38.600]  the bill under Section 4B6 states
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:40.600]  mandatory
[1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:42.600]  service requirement for all
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:44.600]  able young people could be developed
[1:49:44.600 --> 1:49:46.600]  and how such a requirement can be implemented in a manner
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:48.600]  that would strengthen the social fabric
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:50.600]  of the nation overcome and then it goes through
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:52.600]  military service and all the rest of it
[1:49:52.600 --> 1:49:54.600]  so this is slavery
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:56.600]  it's you can call it slave labor
[1:49:56.600 --> 1:49:58.600]  forced labor compulsory military
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:50:00.600]  service all being bootlegged in
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:02.600]  under left cover stuff that Bush could never
[1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:04.600]  dare to even imagine
[1:50:04.600 --> 1:50:06.600]  is now being flaunted really
[1:50:06.600 --> 1:50:08.600]  by the Obama people
[1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:10.600]  let's look at it when Mussolini seized power
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:12.600]  in Italy in October 1922 one of the first
[1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:14.600]  things he did was to create the
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:16.600]  voluntary national service
[1:50:16.600 --> 1:50:18.600]  militia
[1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:20.600]  that then created a group called
[1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:22.600]  OVRA
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:24.600]  the OVRA was the voluntary
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:26.600]  anti-fascist
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:28.600]  suppression organization
[1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:30.600]  now when the Nazis came to power
[1:50:30.600 --> 1:50:32.600]  they wanted to create the Gestapo
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:34.600]  they sent Henry Himmler and others to study the OVRA
[1:50:34.600 --> 1:50:36.600]  so out of these
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:38.600]  innocent sounding voluntary militia organizations
[1:50:38.600 --> 1:50:40.600]  come some pretty horrendous
[1:50:40.600 --> 1:50:42.600]  secret police organization
[1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:44.600]  he's also using federal money to run TV ads
[1:50:44.600 --> 1:50:46.600]  to join his private group
[1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:48.600]  USAService.org
[1:50:48.600 --> 1:50:50.600]  and other groups I mean this is illegal
[1:50:50.600 --> 1:50:52.600]  anytime you get this blurring of the
[1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:54.600]  government and the private sector
[1:50:54.600 --> 1:50:56.600]  with the banks big business and government merge
[1:50:56.600 --> 1:50:58.600]  that's the fascist corporate state
[1:50:58.600 --> 1:51:00.600]  that's what we have now Obama promised
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:02.600]  a national service
[1:51:02.600 --> 1:51:04.600]  core that would be on the scale
[1:51:04.600 --> 1:51:06.600]  of the Pentagon an unbelievable statement
[1:51:06.600 --> 1:51:08.600]  but that's what he said trillion bucks a year
[1:51:08.600 --> 1:51:10.600]  huge then you've got the classroom
[1:51:10.600 --> 1:51:12.600]  core obviously scabs and
[1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:14.600]  strike breakers to break teachers unions
[1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:16.600]  in principal cities
[1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:18.600]  you got the green core
[1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:20.600]  hooligans that can be used to attack
[1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:22.600]  industrialists or anybody interested in producing
[1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:24.600]  land land grabbing cultists
[1:51:24.600 --> 1:51:26.600]  and forces right you got me a corner
[1:51:26.600 --> 1:51:28.600]  can be all the stuff and then you've got
[1:51:28.600 --> 1:51:30.600]  the senior core these would be
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:32.600]  low paid strike breakers and scabs
[1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:34.600]  that could be used to bust any union
[1:51:34.600 --> 1:51:36.600]  or any strike and then of course
[1:51:36.600 --> 1:51:38.600]  the americorps and it
[1:51:38.600 --> 1:51:40.600]  goes on and on and now he's got organized
[1:51:40.600 --> 1:51:42.600]  for america and again all of these
[1:51:42.600 --> 1:51:44.600]  are these strange hybrids right
[1:51:44.600 --> 1:51:46.600]  whenever you hear the word public-private
[1:51:46.600 --> 1:51:48.600]  partnership think fascist
[1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:50.600]  corporate state and that's what it is
[1:51:50.600 --> 1:51:52.600]  oh has said this is all illegal
[1:51:52.600 --> 1:51:54.600]  and they just don't care they just don't care
[1:51:54.600 --> 1:51:56.600]  and of course he had done in the campaign he blurred
[1:51:56.600 --> 1:51:58.600]  you know the obama transition dot gov
[1:51:58.600 --> 1:52:00.600]  when it was not the transition
[1:52:00.600 --> 1:52:02.600]  dot gov it was transition dot
[1:52:02.600 --> 1:52:04.600]  private obama and run by soros
[1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:06.600]  and david Rockefeller not gov
[1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:08.600]  so this is terrible by the way soros is in
[1:52:08.600 --> 1:52:10.600]  the times of london saying he's having
[1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:12.600]  a great crisis in the time of his life
[1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:14.600]  i'm having a great crisis as the headline
[1:52:14.600 --> 1:52:16.600]  and he says this is the culmination of my life
[1:52:16.600 --> 1:52:18.600]  raping you he just loves it it's like
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:20.600]  ramen manual saying you never let a crisis
[1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:22.600]  go unexplored it right you got to get
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:24.600]  the most you can out of it what they're
[1:52:24.600 --> 1:52:26.600]  saying is that since they've got obama
[1:52:26.600 --> 1:52:28.600]  now in the catbird seat they can dictate
[1:52:28.600 --> 1:52:30.600]  a whole series of institutional reforms
[1:52:30.600 --> 1:52:32.600]  union busting silencing
[1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:34.600]  of political opposition under the fairness
[1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:36.600]  doctrine signing according to pc world
[1:52:36.600 --> 1:52:38.600]  a secret global treaty to restrict the web

[1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:12.600]  and police departments
[1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:14.600]  this is the covert takeover

[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:18.600]  this is the bankers checkmate
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:20.600]  to make sure the american people never bring
[1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:22.600]  the bankers to justice and they prevail
[1:57:22.600 --> 1:57:24.600]  i appreciate your call in closing webster
[1:57:24.600 --> 1:57:26.600]  what do you think about the fact that the military admits
[1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:28.600]  they're now spying on me we got their own documents
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:30.600]  and in the fed protest
[1:57:30.600 --> 1:57:32.600]  with ron paul and others were just there
[1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:34.600]  protesting the private fellow reserve doing this to us
[1:57:34.600 --> 1:57:36.600]  and we're not allowed to do that as americans
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:38.600]  the documents say we may be terrorists
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:40.600]  it's uh... it's outrageous
[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:42.600]  and of course it's this neo macarthia
[1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:44.600]  hysteria you know in the old days
[1:57:44.600 --> 1:57:46.600]  we had red scares and all the rest of it
[1:57:46.600 --> 1:57:48.600]  uh... woodrow wilson was one of the worst
[1:57:48.600 --> 1:57:50.600]  right the last time we had a professor
[1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:52.600]  in the white house he was a warmonger
[1:57:52.600 --> 1:57:54.600]  and he promoted the dictatorship at home
[1:57:54.600 --> 1:57:56.600]  and i think that's uh... that's what you have with obama
[1:57:56.600 --> 1:57:58.600]  and by the way it can happen here
[1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:00.600]  99% of the time in history
[1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:02.600]  you get a tyranny you get a martial law
