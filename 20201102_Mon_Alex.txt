[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[00:18.000 --> 00:37.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:37.000 --> 00:39.000]  The wait is over.
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  You're in the final countdown.
[00:43.000 --> 00:58.000]  The last little grains of sand are rolling down the hourglass walls into history, into the future, into oblivion.
[00:58.000 --> 01:05.000]  Yes, stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive.
[01:05.000 --> 01:11.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a spectacular moment to be alive.
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  Everything I cover, I believe to be true, turns out about 95% of it's accurate.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  I wish I was wrong about it all.
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  But I don't study all the fake political systems that have been designed to distract us
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  where individuals are always setting up new political ideologies, new political systems
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  like they have new denominations of churches being started every few minutes
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  so that somebody can claim they've got the truth.
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  When it's already there, good versus evil
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.000]  and the new world order globalist system that is building a post-human world
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  and that seek all power and control.
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  What we cover on air are the real issues.
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  What we cover on air is how things actually work.
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  What we cover on air is a discussion of the real power structure
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  and the battle going on between all these different authoritarian systems for control of that.
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  We're saying we don't want any part of it.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  That is the Renaissance, that is the American system, that is Christianity, that is its true goals.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  And that's why they're so scared of this information
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  because we talk about what they actually talk about in their councils of government and corporations, academia
[02:22.000 --> 02:29.000]  and what they talk about in their even more secret councils with their God
[02:29.000 --> 02:37.000]  who has promised them eternal life through silicon if they only join him.
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  You notice the media doesn't make jokes about this when I talk about it.
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  They can try to discredit me saying something so wild but they know that's really the inner religion.
[02:45.000 --> 02:46.000]  They want to be part of it.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  They want to be good little supplicants to the globalist
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  and hope that they can get a seat at the table into this nightmare future.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  But the truth is everyone signing up for this will end up being destroyed
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.000]  and will be the focus of God's wrath
[03:01.000 --> 03:09.000]  and is cursed from the moment they sign that contract in blood.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  All right, here's what's going to happen.
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  Start your engines.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  We're going to go to break.
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  I'm going to come back and start the main transmission
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  and it is going to be one hell of a roller coaster.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  We're going to be live until nine o'clock tonight
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  and starting at 8 a.m. tomorrow with David Knight on the M4 Wars Network.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  We're going to go through the night.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  It's going to be contested.
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.000]  The Democrats are going to lose.
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  They're not going to say they lost.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  They're going to say Trump's got to stand down.
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  They're going to try to sow as much enmity and crises as possible.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  It's going to be insane.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  And remember, because the corporate media will not call them on crimes,
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  on pedophilia, on being Chinese agents and Russian agents,
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  they believe they can do anything,
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  even though they still get caught in the court of public opinion,
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  even though some video of Lady Shoots gets 5 million views
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  and CNN has 100,000 viewers,
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  they still believe they're in charge, even though they aren't.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.000]  That's very dangerous.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  Coming up, Laura Loomer is going to join us.
[04:09.000 --> 04:17.000]  She caught a fake Kamala Harris putting on a Florida event for Democrats officially.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  That's who these maniacs are.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  All of it is about magician behavior.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  All of it is about manipulation.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  All of it is about deceiving.
[04:29.000 --> 04:37.000]  Their religion is about what they can get over on you.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  So it's just so much is about to be broken down.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  This is all beyond Twilight Zone.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  On this live Monday, November 2nd, 2020,
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  Transmission, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  Strap yourselves in and get ready and spread the word about the live transmission.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  That's how we override the censors.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  That's how we crush the globalist.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  That's how we defeat Bill Gates, the New World War.
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.000]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media,
[05:01.000 --> 05:04.000]  what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  And it's the fact that Info War is more than 25 years ago doing basic research
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.000]  with what the Club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  Developed the hypothesis that the Communist China had been set up
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  to take our jobs and transfer them to China
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  Well, now China owns the debt.
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  Now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals.
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on.
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  But again, it wasn't that hard.
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing,
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  but still others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  We did.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  And you focused on it by supporting us at InfoWars.
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  So when you go to infowarstore.com and get all the great supplements,
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it,
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.000]  what's really happening.
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[05:54.000 --> 06:22.000]  I want to thank you for your support.
[06:24.000 --> 06:32.000]  Well, my friends, the moment of truth is here.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:34.000 --> 06:40.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this November 2nd,
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  live Monday broadcast.
[06:43.000 --> 06:44.000]  Wow.
[06:44.000 --> 06:51.000]  We are 20 hours from the polls opening on the East Coast.
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  You've got roughly half the public's already voted.
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.000]  The internal numbers as it's been tabulated coming out are scaring
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  with Democrats and the deep staters.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  All the internet metrics that are much more accurate than polls
[07:04.000 --> 07:12.000]  show a Trump landslide bigger than we saw in 2016 for short,
[07:12.000 --> 07:17.000]  but also incredibly agonizingly long years ago.
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  Now, normally, you'd know by 9 o'clock at night because you'd have
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  projections on the majority of votes.
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  You'd have projections with so many people already voting
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  in California, say 70%, that even though polls aren't closed,
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  you can project that the person's going to be the winner.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  This time, they're not doing that.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  And Twitter, Facebook, Google, Apple, they've all gotten together
[07:39.000 --> 07:45.000]  and they've said, we're not going to allow anybody but seven approved
[07:45.000 --> 07:50.000]  outlets that are all mainstream to even be able to basically show
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  you election numbers.
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  We'll be telling you about those seven groups.
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  And so these are seven groups that are part of the cartel.
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000]  And so if Trump comes out with projections that are real and says,
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.000]  I'm really the winner, even if you count all those ballots that
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  have been counted and given to Biden, I'm the winner,
[08:10.000 --> 08:11.000]  that's just simple math.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  They're going to say, no, we're going to wait until every single ballot
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.000]  is counted and that's why they mailed out the 80 million ballots to
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  now it's the new school children in Philadelphia and other areas
[08:23.000 --> 08:24.000]  were given ballots.
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  It's all caught on tape.
[08:26.000 --> 08:31.000]  And dead cats and dead dogs and dead people, this is all meant to
[08:31.000 --> 08:36.000]  snarl up with bailing wire, the machinery of the combine and bring
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.000]  into a screeching halt and Hillary so arrogant and John Podesta is so
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.000]  arrogant, they've all been on TV and in war games with the New York
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  Times saying, we think we're going to lose.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  So we're just going to contest it and create a huge disaster until
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.000]  the economy implodes and Trump's driven from office.
[08:55.000 --> 09:00.000]  And now there is a lot of put options going on right now.
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  There's a lot of hedging going on.
[09:03.000 --> 09:10.000]  There's a lot of people that are in the market, shorting the stock
[09:10.000 --> 09:11.000]  market right now.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  And I believe they're going to eat crow.
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  But here's the thing.
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  Trump wins.
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  He ends up still getting inaugurated.
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  But by holding it up a couple of weeks, it will kill the markets,
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.000]  not just here around the world, which again will be a consolidation.
[09:27.000 --> 09:28.000]  It'll kill Main Street.
[09:28.000 --> 09:29.000]  It'll kill the economy.
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  And then after there'll be a rebound on the stock market and the big
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  banks and the top stocks, the top 100 stocks, they'll actually make
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  more money and consolidate power.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  JPMorgan has actually come out in a prospectus.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  Zero hedge has an article about it.
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  And they admit just that scenario and they're betting on it.
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  So I hope the stock market does it plunge, even though it's fiat,
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  because it does affect a lot of the economy.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  We're in a trade war with China.
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.000]  They're propping theirs up.
[09:55.000 --> 09:56.000]  They're trying to bring ours down.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  Main Street media is talking down the stock market.
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  Their own interest, because they're not Americans.
[10:01.000 --> 10:02.000]  They're globalists.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  And they understand the stock market is a weapon they use to consolidate
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  power, not a weapon to give the general public wealth that Trump's been
[10:08.000 --> 10:09.000]  trying to use it for.
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  And that's why they're so angry.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  Now, remember what's been unfolding.
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.000]  They say, we're going to contest no matter what because we think we're
[10:19.000 --> 10:20.000]  going to lose.
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  When Trump can test the contention, he's a dictator.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  He's a criminal.
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.000]  He's bad.
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  When Trump's raising money for lawyers to fight, he's bad planning to contest.
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  When Democrats raise money and the same publication writes about it,
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  Politico or The New York Times, it's good when he does.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  It's bad when Trump does.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  I covered it last night, Politico.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  Oh, it's horrible.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  Trump's planning to not concede.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  And he's already got money being raised by lawyers.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  And he plans after election day to keep raising money for a fight when he
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  can test it and tries to steal it.
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  Meanwhile, the same publication the next day, Joe Biden's raising money for
[10:58.000 --> 10:59.000]  a contested election.
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.000]  Isn't he good?
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  That evil Trump.
[11:02.000 --> 11:11.000]  2020 watch will loser of election except the results.
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  AP, Biden camp quietly raises money for post election.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  Court brawl Politico.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  But here's Politico the day before.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  Trump may just keep campaigning after election day.
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  And CNN and Politico criticizing for it.
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.000]  Trump has a gimmick to keep raising money after the election.
[11:31.000 --> 11:32.000]  How dare him?
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.000]  Why is he doing that?
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  Says the news.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  Meanwhile, CNN reports federal authorities expected to erect non scalable
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  fence around White House.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  CNN goes on to say it's insane.
[11:46.000 --> 11:47.000]  There's no threat.
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  You've just got Soros and BLM camped outside saying they're going to burn it
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  down and say they're going to rush the fence and attack.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  So again, that's just Trump being a dictator saying that they're putting a
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.000]  big fence up around it.
[11:57.000 --> 11:58.000]  How dare him?
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  Oh, but don't go out and vote though.
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  If you're a Republican because the virus is going to get you pre-election
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  virus by creates concern for polling places.
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.000]  Trump and Biden crack schoolboy taunts after beating each other up while
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  campaigning, no, it's Biden that keeps saying he'll beat him up.
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  And then Trump just says, my God, you can hardly walk or talk.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  Coming up next hour, Laura Loomer pops in.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  Fake Kamala got loomered.
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.000]  Laura Loomer catches Kamala Harris body double at Palm Beach polling
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  place.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  And the woman doesn't deny that she's staging this.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  It's just everything about these people is dress up and theater and
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  fraud and magicianry.
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  But there's nothing there.
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  Fauci is attacking Trump and saying he's the worst person ever,
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  showing he works for Gates and works for the Clintons and works for
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.000]  Obama.
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.000]  We warned Trump about that.
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  Now Trump gets it and is really exposing it and showing how the hospitals,
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  that all this extra money to say you had COVID.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  Me, the hospitals then killed you knowingly for the money in Democrat
[13:04.000 --> 13:05.000]  controlled areas.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  That is all coming up.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  I want to open the phones up.
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  Dr. Steve Pacinic is going to be popping in today as well.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  A lot of new Hunter Biden info.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  Now ABC News confirms the laptop's real.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  And as soon as one of the seven trusted, Twitter said, the ones that will
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  oversee the election, as soon as ABC News, Friday came out and said,
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  okay, the laptop's real.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  We've talked to people that have the emails on the other side.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  It's got Bill Clinton's phone number in it.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  It's got Hillary Clinton's.
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  It's got Obama's.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  It's got world leaders.
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  It's real.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  Twitter said, oh, the New York Post isn't banned anymore.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  Oh, my goodness.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  It started by Alexander Hamilton, but all this is pepper in the U.S.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  230 years old, but you can't be trusted.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  But as soon as ABC said, okay, it's real.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  Oh, it's real now.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  Joe Biden campaign won't say if he'll cooperate with FBI probe on
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  Sun, because what we break weeks and weeks ago, there's an FBI probe.
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  They had the laptop almost a year ago, Southern District of New York,
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  criminal investigation, audio of Biden admitting it.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  And now it's all correct.
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  Oh, but I got accused of fake news.
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.000]  And the FBI has confirmed that indeed there is a child porn
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  investigator on the case and it appears to be underage girls.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  And we have Biden admitting he's with underage girls, including
[14:22.000 --> 14:23.000]  family members.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  And there's those photos.
[14:25.000 --> 14:30.000]  Oh, we broke that over two weeks ago and we're the first to do it.
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  Because that's what the sources said was there.
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  And that's what we went with because we're not going to sit here
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  and wait till ABC News tells us something.
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  We're going to look at the info, make our best judgment and put it out there.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  And with the Bidens, they're a known group of sickos that hang around the
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  pedophile cult, can't keep their hands off kids.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  I mean, is Hunter on cocaine?
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  He was kicked out of the Navy for it.
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  His lawyers in the email saying it's a real laptop three weeks ago.
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  It's all confirmed two and a half weeks ago.
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  So the wheels are coming off, ladies and gentlemen, they're so desperate.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  They've got fake Kamala Harris is out.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  Body doubles, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  We're going to cover it all.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  We come back and then some huge COVID-19 news as the global lockdown
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  expands into martial law level.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  If Europe submits next year will be even worse.
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  That's how this works.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  It's tightened down.
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  Tightened down.
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  It's made into a tradition.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  It's made into a holiday of being a slave.
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.000]  They are habituating you.
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.000]  They are brainwashing you.
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  They are conditioning you.
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  Don't forget, we've got the new site that gets past the censors for now,
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  electionnight.news.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  That's how you find band.video.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  That's how you find the live feeds of election coverage.
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  That's how you find the forbidden information.
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  And that's how you share it, Paul Revere, electionnight.news.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[15:51.000 --> 16:20.000]  We'll be right back.
[16:21.000 --> 16:47.000]  We'll be right back.
[16:47.000 --> 17:13.000]  We'll be right back.
[17:13.000 --> 17:39.000]  We'll be right back.
[17:39.000 --> 18:07.000]  We'll be right back.
[18:07.000 --> 18:36.000]  We'll be right back.
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  We'll be right back.
[18:37.000 --> 19:06.000]  We'll be right back.
[19:07.000 --> 19:29.000]  We'll be right back.
[19:29.000 --> 19:55.000]  We'll be right back.
[19:55.000 --> 20:21.000]  We'll be right back.
[20:21.000 --> 20:47.000]  We'll be right back.
[20:47.000 --> 21:13.000]  We'll be right back.
[21:13.000 --> 21:40.000]  We'll be right back.
[21:40.000 --> 22:06.000]  We'll be right back.
[22:06.000 --> 22:32.000]  We'll be right back.
[22:32.000 --> 22:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[22:58.000 --> 23:24.000]  We'll be right back.
[23:24.000 --> 23:50.000]  We'll be right back.
[23:50.000 --> 24:19.000]  We'll be right back.
[24:19.000 --> 24:45.000]  We'll be right back.
[24:45.000 --> 25:11.000]  We'll be right back.
[25:11.000 --> 25:37.000]  We'll be right back.
[25:37.000 --> 26:03.000]  We'll be right back.
[26:03.000 --> 26:29.000]  We'll be right back.
[26:29.000 --> 26:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[26:54.000 --> 27:02.000]  Info Wars has been reporting on the dark unpleasant truths of big government corruption for over two decades.
[27:02.000 --> 27:09.000]  It is why they attack us and it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[27:14.000 --> 27:22.000]  Evil has infested governments everywhere, but the evil establishment is censoring content across all media platforms.
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  They blocked you from sharing banned.video on social media.
[27:26.000 --> 27:33.000]  So go to electionnight.news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[27:33.000 --> 27:42.000]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and Big Pharma.
[27:42.000 --> 27:49.000]  Go to electionnight.news to find all the information the crooked establishment is most afraid of.
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  Go to electionnight.news and share now.
[28:19.000 --> 28:45.000]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and Big Pharma.
[28:45.000 --> 28:53.000]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and Big Pharma.
[29:15.000 --> 29:35.000]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and Big Pharma.
[29:35.000 --> 29:54.000]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and Big Pharma.
[30:06.000 --> 30:13.000]  It's Monday, November 2nd, the year is 2020.
[30:13.000 --> 30:21.000]  We are now 19 hours from the polls officially opening for the most important election in history.
[30:21.000 --> 30:29.000]  America is literally fighting for its very existence, its very sovereignty.
[30:29.000 --> 30:36.000]  If Biden wins, they plan to bring us into massive poverty and break our back the way they've done in all their blue city cesspits.
[30:36.000 --> 30:48.000]  Pray to God for a global awakening, get out there and vote, have your friends and family vote, and have your eyes peeled for what's about to happen because we are entering the danger zone big time right now.
[30:48.000 --> 30:54.000]  Now, I opened the broadcast up and I said the most important thing.
[30:54.000 --> 31:03.000]  To understand is all the internal metrics show Trump's going to win by a landslide, but the Democrats have war game this for months, longer than months.
[31:03.000 --> 31:16.000]  They've been public for months saying they're going to contest and by flooding the 80 million, most of them illegal ballots, to school children, dead cats, dead people, 80 million of them.
[31:16.000 --> 31:25.000]  And there's so many missing and so many are finding cash and warehouses and hidden in barns. Those are all meant to be brought in last minute and to be filled out.
[31:25.000 --> 31:38.000]  That's why they're finding them hidden all over the place because they didn't have names that weren't on the rolls, names on the rolls that weren't used to go fill those damn things out, you understand.
[31:38.000 --> 31:49.000]  And that's why they've said they're going to try to push it right through the 20th and under the 20th amendment, if on January 20th, Trump has not been inaugurated or Joe Biden hasn't been, it goes to House of Representatives and then to the states.
[31:49.000 --> 31:58.000]  And that is their plan. They've told us that's what they're doing. Everyone's like, Alex, it's incredible. What you said months ago is happening. How'd you know? They told us.
[31:58.000 --> 32:07.000]  That's incredibly bold. Yeah, spying on the candidates, spying on the president, persecuting his supporters.
[32:07.000 --> 32:16.000]  And these people are crazy. These are crackheads and pedophiles, man. They're rich, crazy people that would sell their country out. They have moral problems from the beginning.
[32:16.000 --> 32:25.000]  And then after decades, you can take a five-year-old group and a well-structured discipline home and you spoil their acid age five by age 10. They're going to be a horrible person.
[32:25.000 --> 32:34.000]  This is beyond spoiling, ladies and gentlemen. These people are mad dogs. Look at the Roman emperors, what they became like.
[32:34.000 --> 32:42.000]  And the early Roman Empire, if you cheated on your wife, it didn't matter if you were a senator, you'd get executed.
[32:42.000 --> 32:49.000]  And by the time Rome fell, they were screwing little kids in public. They weren't just screwing them.
[32:49.000 --> 33:09.000]  One Roman emperor I was reading about, Caligula, in front of a crowd of people, was it Caligula or was it Nero? I think it was, had a little kid chained up and then he came in dressed like a werewolf in front of everybody eating dinner and tore the child's throat out in front of them.
[33:09.000 --> 33:17.000]  I mean, that's the cop of stuff in the Roman histories, folks. So you go from cheat on your wife, you're executed. That sounds a little extreme to me, but see, they knew what would happen.
[33:17.000 --> 33:25.000]  And then by the end of it, they're tearing children's throats out 500 years later.
[33:25.000 --> 33:31.000]  So that's what these people are like. You ask why they're like this because they're crazy.
[33:31.000 --> 33:40.000]  They're psychotics that have never gotten in trouble, who were trying to get caught trying to get somebody to stop them, because that's how psychology works. Everybody knows that.
[33:40.000 --> 33:47.000]  So Trump, this is key. Trump comes out and says we need to have it be the night of the election.
[33:47.000 --> 33:56.000]  The Democrats have said they're going to contest. They've put out all these fake ballots. Clearly they know what they're doing. We need to have it be that night.
[33:56.000 --> 34:05.000]  And Hillary's like, no, look at this cryptic tweet and we'll play the Trump clip. The election will be over when all the votes are counted.
[34:05.000 --> 34:14.000]  He says, Madam President, just like Bill Gates says, you will not see anything reopen till there's my mRNA vaccine in two years.
[34:14.000 --> 34:20.000]  Now he says, you know what? Never. You're staying locked up for 10 years and he controls the big global corporations of the UN.
[34:20.000 --> 34:28.000]  He has more power than Trump unless Trump takes the power from it. And Trump is now calling out Fauci and Gates head on. Thank God it's beautiful.
[34:28.000 --> 34:37.000]  Dr. Steve Pacino is going to pop in and talk about that the third hour. So here's Hillary Clinton saying to the world, I'm in charge.
[34:37.000 --> 34:44.000]  I'm telling you what's going to happen after all her fraud, all her corruption, the Russia gate, Ukraine gate, the WikiLeaks, all of it.
[34:44.000 --> 34:54.000]  She says the election will be over when all the votes are counted. She just tweeted this an hour ago.
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.000]  Wow. And then Donald Trump's a clear and present danger to the world, they say. Sick.
[35:01.000 --> 35:08.000]  So Trump gets it, but here's Madam President, the deep state, with all her people hanging on, waiting for them to get back in power.
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.000]  They start robbing the country again and they're so angry. They're so upset.
[35:13.000 --> 35:20.000]  And now Trump's blasting Europe's draconian new lockdowns and telling it like it is and exposing how they put people that died of other things in the same column.
[35:20.000 --> 35:26.000]  Finally, he's sitting on all cylinders. Finally, he's thrown his aids to the side. Finally, he's fired his campaign head.
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  He's now going with his instincts and he's winning.
[35:30.000 --> 35:37.000]  But can his landslide overpower their fraud? They may steal it tonight, tomorrow night.
[35:37.000 --> 35:43.000]  But if they can't get to steal with the ballot stuffing and all the fake ballots, they're going to hold it up to split the country up.
[35:43.000 --> 35:48.000]  Why shouldn't they? They never get in trouble and have states secede that they take control of.
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.000]  This is treason. This is anarchy. This is sedition. This is espionage because they're working with foreign powers.
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  This is dangerous. This is outrageous.
[35:58.000 --> 36:04.000]  But the FBI, just department leadership has been selected to be political lap dogs and never stick their heads up above the grass.
[36:04.000 --> 36:12.000]  And so we're like a runaway train, ladies and gentlemen, and Trump's trying to get control and all these idiots are cheering for their own country to come down
[36:12.000 --> 36:19.000]  because they were picked and bred and trained because they were scum that hated their own country.
[36:19.000 --> 36:26.000]  So here's the president saying we need to have the election on the day of the election.
[36:26.000 --> 36:33.000]  Oh, they're going to be, they're going to be some heads that are exploding.
[36:33.000 --> 36:47.000]  It would have been nice if our Supreme Court could have ruled that everything has to be counted by the evening of our election, our great election day.
[36:47.000 --> 36:54.000]  Wouldn't that be nice? Instead of waiting around six days, eight days, nine days, giving them more time.
[36:54.000 --> 37:01.000]  If they want more time, let them put their ballots in early. They don't have to wait till the end.
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.000]  Let's give them an extra three days and let's take all the time you want.
[37:05.000 --> 37:11.000]  You know, people want to know, and you know, bad things happen in places like Pennsylvania and Nevada.
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  We love Nevada, but you have a governor there. Bad things can happen.
[37:15.000 --> 37:22.000]  That little intervening, let's take plenty of time now. That's a terrible ruling for our country.
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  I don't care. It's a terrible ruling.
[37:26.000 --> 37:32.000]  Yep, that's that Supreme Court that he thought was going to be his buddy and they just ruled against him.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  Because they know the deep state butters their bread.
[37:36.000 --> 37:44.000]  Meanwhile, we have new audio. Philly teacher reveals school lunch workers gave ballots to children as young as eight years old.
[37:44.000 --> 37:52.000]  And Democrats are saying in Chicago and LA and San Francisco and Portland that illegal aliens can vote.
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.000]  Oh, they never want illegal aliens to vote. They just have people in New York lined up around the block this year.
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.000]  Illegal aliens to get driver's license, which didn't let you vote.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  Unbelievable.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  But what did Trump really just say there?
[38:08.000 --> 38:17.000]  They said, hey, just 15 days, stay in your houses so that we're going to shut down the hospital for everybody else's heart attacks and the rest of it.
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  This COVID is so bad that if you're down in a heart attack, we're not going to take you to the hospital, literally.
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  It's like cancer surgery. It's all canceled. You're just going to die.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.000]  They admit like 10 times more died from no surgery than COVID.
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  And it was 15 days and it was two months. It was six months. It was eight months.
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  Now it's like it's two years. It's five years. It's 10 years.
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.000]  And the UN goes no gates. It's not 10 years. It's forever.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  It's a power grab.
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  And so if you actually read what Podesta and Hillary have said, they're going to push it.
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  Pelosi said to the 20th of January, how many days is that?
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  November 3rd, then December and then January 20th.
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  So that's 31 days, 20 days.
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  We're at 51 days.
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.000]  And you had all the days of November that are left, 27, 26.
[39:07.000 --> 39:12.000]  And we're talking about months of this. We're talking about 79 days of hell.
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  And that's their plan. And how do you stop them?
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  They control these blue cities and blue states and they're going to do it because they never get in trouble.
[39:19.000 --> 39:29.000]  Because the Justice Department is literally a bunch of castrated weirdos that are lawyers that, oh, mitigate threat.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  Oh, if one person had died of COVID, let's let millions starve to death.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  Oh, let's get rid of all jungle gyms. Someone might hurt themselves.
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  Oh, let's ban rock climbing all over the country. Someone might get hurt.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  Hell, don't even have kids. They might die someday.
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.000]  It's just, it's the nanny state. It's a damn present. Holy mackerel.
[39:53.000 --> 40:03.000]  Look it up for yourself. The head of the Davos Group issued a report one six months ago calling for world government to be openly established to respond to COVID-19.
[40:03.000 --> 40:08.000]  And the COVID-19 was a blessing to lower the planet's carbon footprint.
[40:08.000 --> 40:14.000]  Since then, Prince Charles and countless others have come out and said the exact same thing.
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.000]  The most ancient form of total war is called siege.
[40:19.000 --> 40:24.000]  And that's when you cut people off from their resources. That's when you lock them down.
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalist or just get rid of Donald Trump.
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.000]  That's only part of it. This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt.
[40:33.000 --> 40:41.000]  So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social credit score surveillance grid.
[40:41.000 --> 40:45.000]  You've heard the U.S. Army saying our job is to kill people and break things.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  Well, that's what the lockdown's doing. It's starving the third world. Millions and millions of debt.
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  It's breaking down the supply chain in society. It's their mission.
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.000]  It's all on record. Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford.
[40:58.000 --> 41:07.000]  They were all hired a year ago and then again six months ago to wargame how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  and how to get the public to take inoculations.
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.000]  And they talk about calling people heroes that do it. They talk about shaming those that don't.
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.000]  This has all been psychologically tested. It's all been psychologically prepared.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  And once they get you to lock down for 15 days, you notice now they say it's permanent.
[41:24.000 --> 41:31.000]  That's how it works. Oh, just put these handcuffs on. The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right.
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.000]  No. Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van.
[41:36.000 --> 41:42.000]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death. That's the allegory.
[41:42.000 --> 41:47.000]  We got to bust out of this thing now. We got to say no now. We got to make a run for it now, but we still can't.
[41:47.000 --> 41:53.000]  Once he gets us in that basement, it's going to get a lot, lot worse, folks. So stop submitting.
[41:53.000 --> 41:59.000]  Two in full wars best selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.000]  Biotree Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity of the cells in the body.
[42:05.000 --> 42:12.000]  That's every human activity. And on top of it, body's ultimate turmeric formula with 95% or synchic humanoid.
[42:12.000 --> 42:20.000]  Lady competitors have 3% to 5%. The things that turmeric does, I don't have to tell you, this is the highest quality and strongest you're going to find.
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  So both of these are amazing products and they found the Mfold War, which is a 360 win.
[42:25.000 --> 42:36.000]  On top of it, despite the factory demand they've been sold out for months, they're both 50% off, triple Patriot points and free shipping at MfoldWarStore.com.
[42:36.000 --> 42:46.000]  That's Biotree Selenium from the mustard seed. It's amazing. And on top of it, we also have body's ultimate turmeric formula at MfoldWarStore.com.
[42:46.000 --> 42:52.000]  The cell will not last long, but thank you all for your support. If you really need to try these products, people absolutely love them because they really, really work.
[42:52.000 --> 43:17.000]  MfoldWarStore.com.
[43:22.000 --> 43:32.000]  MfoldWarStore.com.
[43:52.000 --> 44:02.000]  MfoldWarStore.com.
[44:22.000 --> 44:32.000]  MfoldWarStore.com.
[44:32.000 --> 44:42.000]  MfoldWarStore.com.
[44:42.000 --> 44:57.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. I want to go to all of these calls, Cruz, Omar, John, Hanuman, David, James, William, Harry, Tony, Chris, all here in just a moment.
[44:57.000 --> 45:12.000]  But I just want to, again, boil this down. We are living in an incredible time, an insane time, and Hillary Clinton has come out and said in a tweet, the election will be over when all the votes are counted.
[45:12.000 --> 45:28.000]  They've done this impossible thing, and they've cashed votes everywhere, and they're finding them in all these corrupt blue city, blue state areas of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Iowa, Florida, cashed in Democrat strongholds.
[45:28.000 --> 45:39.000]  And this is going to be skull-duggery. This is going to be absolutely out of control, and the media is going to just say, Trump is stealing it. Trump is stealing it.
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.000]  Trump is bad. So I'm asking you guys, where do you see all of this going?
[45:44.000 --> 45:54.000]  But here is the list of approved groups that Twitter and Facebook and others are all working together that are allowed to even talk about, is it legitimate to keep the election going?
[45:54.000 --> 46:08.000]  Who's even allowed to talk about numbers and say, hey, more have voted than, statistically, there's no way that Biden could win when you get to those numbers, a few percentage points, if Trump already has such a lead.
[46:08.000 --> 46:20.000]  If you counted all the votes for Biden in Trump's the winner, you got to say, Trump, but they're saying, no, we're going to wait until all the other little blue state areas have counted every damn ballot when it's their admitted plan to hold things up.
[46:20.000 --> 46:31.000]  It's all siege, hold up the country, boycott the country. It's all a big giant corporate strike, making you wear a diaper over your face, making you not be able to go to the park, be able to go to the lake.
[46:31.000 --> 46:41.000]  All of it's about making you miserable. All these billionaires fly around their private jets above you and have huge palatial mansions. It's disgusting.
[46:41.000 --> 46:55.000]  So here's who's allowed to talk about and project who the winners are. ABC News, AP, CNN, CBS, Decision Desk HQ, Fox News, NBC.
[46:55.000 --> 47:09.000]  All have been vetted to be non-biased. You know, look for some betrayal like Fox News declaring Trump the loser. I'm telling you, man, Fox has had that dagger up for Trump for a long time.
[47:09.000 --> 47:17.000]  That's where I'll see the attack coming from because they'll go, oh, it's legitimate. Even Fox News said, watch if they try that. It's so obvious.
[47:17.000 --> 47:28.000]  The landslide is so big they may not, though. But again, they could have so many dead people voting and so much fraud that they announced that Trump loses at like 9 o'clock tomorrow night.
[47:28.000 --> 47:33.000]  And we're all thinking, oh, it's about the ballots holding it up, but they could do it the other way, which is in the cards.
[47:33.000 --> 47:40.000]  I'm telling you, this is white knuckle time, ladies and gentlemen. All right, let's go to your phone calls. I'm going to each person for about a minute.
[47:40.000 --> 47:48.000]  Get to a lot of your calls. Let's go ahead and talk to William in California. What do you see happening, William?
[47:48.000 --> 47:56.000]  Well, lately I live in Santa Cruz, California. It's a very liberal town traditionally. I've been seeing tons of Trump support.
[47:56.000 --> 48:03.000]  You know, my friends and my family are all turning over to Trump. They're seeing all the amazing work that he's done the past almost four years.
[48:03.000 --> 48:13.000]  And like you said, the metrics show that he's going to win by a landslide. And I really do have faith. I'm praying to God. I'm praying for Trump and his family.
[48:13.000 --> 48:22.000]  But, you know, I'm a little bit worried about what the left and the Democrats have up their sleeves. You know, I think we're going to see a lot of fraud in the vote.
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  And we're going to see a lot of fake news coming out. And I'm trying to remain faithful.
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.000]  You know, they say Biden has a 95% chance of winning, but they did say the same exact thing.
[48:33.000 --> 48:44.000]  Or they said 98% chance of Hillary winning in 2016. Turns out Trump won. And, you know, it's hard to trust the polls when you know that they're so fake.
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  I totally agree with you, sir. Thank you for the call.
[48:47.000 --> 48:55.000]  I got up at like 6 a.m. this morning, turned on my wife's iPad, making some coffee, and the feed is just full of Apple news.
[48:55.000 --> 49:05.000]  Trump only has 10% of winning 95% chance Biden wins just so people don't go vote. So they feel like, oh, you know, Trump lost. I'm not going to vote.
[49:05.000 --> 49:14.000]  That's what they did. Or in states like Texas, they go, oh, Trump's going to win. So Republicans don't need to vote. I was talking to a Republican neighbor.
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  And I go, are you going to vote? They go, I don't need to. We're going to take the state.
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  I'm like, okay, that's great.
[49:20.000 --> 49:25.000]  That's the type of thinking that's going to make us lose this election. And I know there's election fraud all over the place, too.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  It's why you got to have an overwhelming victory is how you defeat these people.
[49:29.000 --> 49:35.000]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Paul in California. Paul, go ahead.
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  Hello. Yes, sir.
[49:38.000 --> 49:44.000]  Trump is going to be kicked out on the 20th because of the contesting.
[49:44.000 --> 49:49.000]  Biden is going to back out the incapable of fulfilling.
[49:49.000 --> 49:56.000]  Kamala Harris is constitutionally unable to become president with the birth requirements.
[49:56.000 --> 50:02.000]  That makes Pelosi president of the United States.
[50:02.000 --> 50:09.000]  You know, it's funny that you say that because Pelosi's been saying, I've talked to COG, meaning the military, and I'm going to be president.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  Did you hear her say that two months ago?
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.000]  Well, yeah, you put it on.
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.000]  You know, I have to tell you, sir, that that is one of their plans. They've said it is. I can't because they're so bold.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  That's the thing is they get away with the COVID exaggeration and hoax.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  They get away with all the barisma scams. They get away with the pedophilia.
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.000]  They get away. So why shouldn't they keep doing this?
[50:30.000 --> 50:37.000]  The only out that I see is arrest Joe Biden.
[50:37.000 --> 50:42.000]  I mean, I hear you at some point, this ravenous group of criminals have to be stopped.
[50:42.000 --> 50:47.000]  They're mad dogs and the government's full of scared lawyers.
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  Most of them aren't even traders. The Justice Department's not.
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  They're just all scared and they just don't know what to do because no one will stand up and take these people along.
[50:55.000 --> 51:03.000]  Well, I am and President Trump is and you are all the folks standing in the cold to see Trump speak when he finished a rally in Florida at 1 a.m. last night.
[51:03.000 --> 51:10.000]  That's a champion. That's an ass kicker compared to these scumbag traders, these little sellouts to China.
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  I bless you. Since you mentioned that, sir, here is the media.
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.000]  This is a small sampling of this is saying called the Harris Biden Harris Biden.
[51:18.000 --> 51:26.000]  They're getting us ready. They're getting us ready for Harris because they don't care if she's not legitimate or there's a debate about where she was really born or whatever.
[51:26.000 --> 51:32.000]  It's Harris who literally doesn't know what planet she's on as well. Here she is.
[51:32.000 --> 51:39.000]  So honored to introduce the next president of the United States, Senator Kamala Harris.
[51:39.000 --> 51:43.000]  A Harris administration together with Joe Biden.
[51:43.000 --> 51:51.000]  Harris Biden administration is going to relaunch that effort and keep pushing further to make it.
[51:51.000 --> 51:57.000]  And I'm married to the next president of the United States.
[51:57.000 --> 52:05.000]  My name is Joe Biden. I'm Joe Biden's husband and I am Kamala's running mate.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  He doesn't know what planet he's on.
[52:09.000 --> 52:13.000]  A black man invented the light bulb. Not a white guy named Edison.
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  Okay.
[52:17.000 --> 52:25.000]  Oh, my God. The gas coming out of the sky. He said last week he's running against George W. Bush.
[52:25.000 --> 52:31.000]  There's a new one out where he says he's a grandma.
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  It's dementia. I remember my grandfather was like 82, started doing that. He had a stroke.
[52:37.000 --> 52:41.000]  It was kind of sad but, you know, he was sitting there on his easy chair watching the NFL.
[52:41.000 --> 52:46.000]  He wasn't trying to take over the most powerful country in the world with nuclear weapons. This is just ridiculous.
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  All right, we're going to break. Come back with all of these callers. Lauren, David, everybody.
[52:50.000 --> 52:56.000]  We're going to get to all of you. Laura Loomer's popping in. She caught a Kamala Harris body double that they were pushing.
[52:56.000 --> 53:01.000]  The party is, look, it's Kamala and her followers are already bonded to such lies. They're like, oh, it's Kamala.
[53:01.000 --> 53:07.000]  It didn't even look like her. I mean, they're in a cult. They're crazy.
[53:07.000 --> 53:12.000]  We're going to have 24-hour coverage. It starts tomorrow at 8 a.m. right through this contested baby.
[53:12.000 --> 53:18.000]  And it is going to be wild. And they're hoping evidence of election fraud and things around the country don't get out.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  And they've already implemented massive censorship. It's going to intensify tomorrow and on Wednesday.
[53:22.000 --> 53:28.000]  Mark my words, but we're going to try to stay on air under the hack attacks and more at election night.news.
[53:28.000 --> 53:32.000]  That's the new URL. They haven't blacklisted yet that you're able to share.

[54:32.000 --> 54:37.000]  We don't have George Soros as our sugar daddy. We have you. You have us. We are together.
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.000]  We are the people. Stay with us. Hour number two, straight ahead.
[54:42.000 --> 54:47.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.000]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition,
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.000]  buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[55:00.000 --> 55:06.000]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure,
[55:06.000 --> 55:12.000]  decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[55:16.000 --> 55:23.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[55:23.000 --> 55:28.000]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.000]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  that pertain to reality.
[55:36.000 --> 56:05.000]  Get your Ultimate Fish Oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at Infowarsstore.com.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  I'm a new World Order and I read about all their plans to lockdown civilization,
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  start of the third world, and then enslave the first world.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  So I've been really, really loud and really, really aggressive and we've had a big effect.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  But now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way
[56:23.000 --> 56:27.000]  where you get people to think for themselves before it's too late.
[56:27.000 --> 56:33.000]  The lockdown, social distancing, the mask is meant to end human civilization.
[56:33.000 --> 56:37.000]  We're under a civilization collapse weapon.
[56:37.000 --> 56:42.000]  So this is live and death. Please share Infowars.com and band our video
[56:42.000 --> 57:07.000]  to support our live election coverage.
[57:07.000 --> 57:13.000]  Okay, let's go right to your phone calls in order they are received.
[57:13.000 --> 57:19.000]  David in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[57:19.000 --> 57:22.000]  Thanks for taking my call, Alec.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  San Diego is freaking crazy, man.
[57:24.000 --> 57:29.000]  I never seen so much support for any sort of presidential candidate at all.
[57:29.000 --> 57:34.000]  And the amount of support and the amount of people that were out yesterday at the Boe Parade,
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  and everybody lined on the shore at Harbor Island, it was nuts, man.
[57:38.000 --> 57:43.000]  I'm just, I know everybody's talking about a landslide and whatnot,
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.000]  and even talking about going back red, you know, as far as California,
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.000]  but that's a long shot, but I still think we need to...
[57:52.000 --> 57:55.000]  Well, sir, it's not a long shot. When Democrats get control of a jurisdiction,
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  they always engage in crime.
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.000]  And then they indicted what three members of the House representatives
[58:00.000 --> 58:03.000]  that were going to win re-election last time.
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  I mean, they're just going to arrest everybody they can't beat.
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  Because if you're winning by like 75%, they can't steal it.
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  That's why the computers work. That's why the balance stuffing works.
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  And so California, of course, is really red.
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  But that's the thing people understand.
[58:17.000 --> 58:22.000]  Democrats, if they get control of your jurisdiction, you never have a real election again.
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.000]  That's why their party has to be politically eradicated.
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  They are a criminal group. Sorry, go ahead.
[58:28.000 --> 58:33.000]  That's the only reason why I say that is because, you know, we've got so many people that have infiltrated
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  as far as, like, Democrats.
[58:35.000 --> 58:41.000]  And I think that numbers will turn out, but we really need to play chess with this.
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  And if they're really planning on contesting...
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  I mean, didn't we take a census this year?
[58:45.000 --> 58:48.000]  Is there any way we can use those numbers as far as who's...
[58:48.000 --> 58:51.000]  Look, the Democrats have been caught everywhere in massive fraud.
[58:51.000 --> 58:54.000]  Look, California is going red.
[58:54.000 --> 58:57.000]  Everybody knows that either people are leaving or it's going red.
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  No one's buying into it.
[58:59.000 --> 59:02.000]  Sir, we have all the internal metrics. I covered them last night.
[59:02.000 --> 59:06.000]  Two to one, people are searching how to vote Republican, vote Democrat.
[59:06.000 --> 59:12.000]  The advertising clicks, the metrics, the internal numbers, and what's leaking out of the polling places
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.000]  and those processing ballots is a landslide.
[59:15.000 --> 59:18.000]  That's why they pump tens of millions of fake ones.
[59:18.000 --> 59:21.000]  They're hoarding that they're then starting to mail now
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  or their operatives are going to bring in.
[59:23.000 --> 59:27.000]  That's why Trump's demanding the names of whose transporting ballots
[59:27.000 --> 59:31.000]  and who the officers are under law, they're supposed to know who voting officers are,
[59:31.000 --> 59:35.000]  and in Michigan and in Pennsylvania and in other areas,
[59:35.000 --> 59:38.000]  the Democrats are refusing to follow the law and say who their names are
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  because I've watched past elections.
[59:40.000 --> 59:46.000]  They'll have felons, always in white collar fraud, running each of the major precincts.
[59:46.000 --> 59:51.000]  That's why Trump wants the names, because I guarantee you, you'll notice on Wednesday it's going to come out
[59:51.000 --> 59:55.000]  that a whole bunch of thousands of felons are running things with Democrats.
[59:55.000 --> 59:58.000]  They are a criminal party. It's who they are.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  They're projecting. They're projecting and their projection says that they're committing fraud.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  The projection says that they're going to do their best to do the fraud.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  You look at the fake Kamala Harris, they're projecting, man.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  Every single move, they're too stupid and they project their move up ahead of everything else.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  Yeah, because these are traders that sold out their country.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  These are CHICOM operatives. I agree.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  They're a bunch of scum with the media backing them up and the gaslight doesn't work anymore.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  Thank you, David.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  All right. Who's up next here?
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  That would be Lauren in New Mexico.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  Lauren, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Hey, Alex, man, I just got to tell you about how crazy it is here in New Mexico.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  I wish it was for the Republicans, but unfortunately, man, the Democrats are going crazy here.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  I keep on getting calls from Democrat support.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  Oh, you're for Biden, aren't you?
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  I'm like, no, please stop calling me.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Man, we're getting amber alerts to stay home.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  We're getting signs on the highways that we are in a red, red, red.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  Oh, yeah, they're just terrorizing everyone that these are terrorists.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  I'm hearing people badly here in New Mexico, man, and I'm a new listener.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  My husband's a new listener.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  We've been ordering, we got t-shirts, and I'm so thankful that you're out here spreading the truth.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  And I really hope that I get to see you as president one day.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  Well, New Mexico is a gorgeous state, great people.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  But again, Democrats got control of your state.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  We love you and we appreciate you.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  Laura, anything else you want to add?
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  Nope, I am full, full, full, full Trump.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  And Alex Jones, the president, 2024, there we go.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  All right, thank you. You're awesome. Say hi to your husband for me.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  We're going to come back in 60 seconds and I'm going to write back bam, bam, bam.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  Hanuman, John, Omar, Cruz, Harry, Tony, Christopher, Anthony, James.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshiped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  But with modern science, we know my turmeric is so popular.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  It's antioxidant effect. It's anti-inflammatory effect.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  Everything it does is simply amazing.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  They're 3 to 5% curcuminoid.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  But we have bodies ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid level.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  And we have other organic products in there that accelerate it and bring it into the cells of the body.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  It's been sold out for months. It's back in stock.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  And despite that, bodies ultimate turmeric formula at mfolwarstore.com is 50% off with free shipping and triple patriot points at mfolwarstore.com.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  It's bodies ultimate turmeric formula.

[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  If it keeps on raining, love is gonna break.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  Going down, going down, down to Chicago.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  Here's what's going down.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  Alex Jones here back live, taking your phone calls on the eve of the election.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Thanks for keeping me here. Thanks for putting me here.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  I salute you and thank you.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  Don't thank me. I'm thanking you.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  You're the ones that did this.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Everything you're seeing, America fighting for its life, said it's just laying there and taking it.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  And gaining background, that's you.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  It's not about kissing your ass. It's about recognizing what you've done spreading the word, what you've done supporting us.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  We are the tip of the spear and you are the literal metal alloy in that spear.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  And you are the will of that spear and the spirit of that spear.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  And I just love you.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  Now, here's what I have in my gut.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  And the gut is your subconscious brain that's 100 times more powerful or more than your conscious brain
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  that knows all the data, knows all the info.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  But if you consciously tried to hold it all at once, you'd go crazy.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  The cerebral cortex is your limited focus.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  So my instincts, my gut, my genetics and then my spirit tell me, you've really woken up.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  I've woken up the world's waking up.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  Bolsonaro, what's happening with Brexit, what's happening in Europe, Eastern Europe.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  Japan's super capitalist, anti-globalist now.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  Africa's rebelling against the globalist.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  Beautiful things are happening.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  And so the spirit, I feel good.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  God really cares about, we're all in touch with God if we open up that channel.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  And God is pleased that we're waking up and saying no and recognizing good and evil.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  But just because we're awake to it and just because Trump's really going to win in the landslide,
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  doesn't mean he's going to win.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  A lot of times when you're number one, you get destroyed.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  Because we're not supposed to have what we want.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  The devil is going to force, feed us what he wants us to have.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  He's going to push back demonic demons like Kamala Harris and Biden.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  Those are slaves of evil. Look at them.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  The wages of sin are death.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  Their minds are already dead.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  It doesn't mean Trump's perfect, but he's not against you.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  He's not out to get you.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  He doesn't love destruction and poverty and wars and evil.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  He likes life.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  And so they don't like him because he's not part of their club.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  He didn't get his money from them.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  It's what they call an interloper, an outsider, somebody that jumped the fence,
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  somebody that shouldn't have gotten in with them, all these inbred, trashy, nobody people.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  So-called elitists, but they're the opposite.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  And so just because your gut tells you and all the internal metrics and internal polls and web data
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  show massive interest, you have five times the interest in Trump is what the metrics show.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  Hell, look at the big rallies for Trump. No one shows up for Biden.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  But they've got the money, and they've got the fraud, and they've got the devil that runs this planet,
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  and they've got the 80 million fake ballots.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  And so they've been saying they're going to hold the election up,
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  and they've been saying they're going to do that to keep Trump's eye on that.
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  And I agree. That's their sure thing that they'll default to.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  But they're intended to steal this bigger than Dallas tomorrow.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  And that's why they're, oh, we aren't going to let Trump announce.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  And if Trump says, if these trusted news organizations, they're not even American-owned,
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  if they say Trump lost, he did.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  And if he says he contested, we won't even let him contest,
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  and we're going to shut his Twitter down and shut him up.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  Good luck. You're going to fail.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  But they've got all the big tech and all the media together to silence and gag our president.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  And Congress will probably put up with that if it happens. Hell, the president probably will.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  Because these people have had us under their control so long,
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  bitch slapping us up and down the street, pimping us out that they think they can pull this off.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  Now, here's the good news.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  I don't want Trump to lose, but if they throw us in that briar patch and steal this,
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  they really cook their goose.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  I mean, we're going to have a speck.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  You think people are awake now and pissed off?
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  They kill Trump? Or they steal this election from him?
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  They'd be smart to let him get in and try to sabotage and just do what they've been doing.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  They're not like that, though.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  They want power and they want it now because the Chinese are popping that whip saying,
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  you don't do it, we're told, we'll release the dirt on you.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  And so much dirt's come out and so much eagles come out that there are cornered rats now,
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  and that makes them even more dangerous. They're going to make their move.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  So just know this, if you've ever been bored in your life and you're only excited when the NFL playoffs come up,
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  this is a trillion times more important than that and literally,
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  and it's insane and dangerous and crazy with Democrats running around like chickens with their heads cut off,
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  trying to crash the stock market.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  So we're at the edge of a cliff here, folks.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  So I mean, I've been, I normally pray sitting in a chair or laying in bed.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  I've been getting on my knees every day for the last few months.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  And sometimes I feel like I need to get on my knees and I get on my knees.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  But I mean, I've been getting on my knees in my face on the ground for the last few months
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  because I want to be in direct, absolute, total focus on God
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  because this is so damn dangerous, okay?
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  So I'm just telling everybody, this is it, okay?
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  This is the big, fat enchilada, like breaking the balls in the start of a pool game.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  This is going to decide the whole next generation, the whole next phase, the whole new system.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  Whether the New Age, they talk about some nightmare of devil worship and world collapse at Antichrist
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  or a system where we go through an Antichrist system quickly and it's over fast.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  This is God's giving us a choice whether we want to have a controlled crash landing
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  or an absolute devastating burn the whole damn planet down.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Because God gives us choices.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  God sets the destiny, studied this, but then we have a way to maneuver in our choices how that unfolds.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  And so we're being given free will, predestination, but free will within that.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  So there are different timelines that are set and we're deciding the damn timelines right now.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  Let's go to a phone call here. Who's been holding the longest here?
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  I guess that'd be Hanuman in Oregon. Thank you for holding. Welcome.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  Hi, Alex.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  Welcome.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Hi. So God bless you.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  I'm glad I stocked up on silver gargles before it all went out.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  I've been using that. It's great. Thanks so much.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  And I think in terms of President Trump, what powers does he have?
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  I mean, in the extreme, we see the insurrection, we see the sedition,
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  the infringements on the 14th Amendment, all these states.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  I live in Oregon. It's a blue state.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  And the extreme, what powers can he take to just overthrow and cut the heads of the hydro?
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  Well, he has the Insurrection Act. We're dealing with China.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  The Democrats admit China's running them.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  Pelosi knows it's coming out. She's like, yeah, we work for China. Big deal.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  So she's normalizing that, inoculating us psychologically.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  And so he has the power of the Insurrection Act.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  He has all sorts of powers. Here's the problem.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  He's got the rank-and-file police and military are good people.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  And it's constitutional if he calls them out against the foreign takeover.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  But the leadership are a bunch of gilded lawyers.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  And so they never stick their head up. They just go with the wind.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  And so the president is up there with his voice and his will surrounded by calories, basically.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  Does he have the Marines around him? Does he have the protection?
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  He knows. He's the head of the game usually.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  So he's got to have the things in place.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  Sure. The rank-and-file secret service are great people.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  They're all great. The rank-and-file FBI is great people.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  They all hate the big state. But no, that's it.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  It's Trump at the top, and then he's got the low-level people with him,
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  almost 100 percent, and then just scum right in that management level, right up there at the top.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  Never in my 70 years, and I was talking to my mother this morning who was 90,
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  have we seen this kind of support for a president?
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  Well, America knows it's fighting for its life, brother.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  Yes. And so he has that support if he decides to go with it, take the reins,
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  cut the heads of the hydro off, do whatever it takes to stop this and save our country.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  I agree, because I'm not somebody that likes this type of stuff,
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  but they're the ones already saying they're going to set a secession in civil war.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  I mean, and the Democrats are openly killing the dollar, screw America.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  Their whole futures are gone, and that happens. They're crazy.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  We pray for them. We pray for them.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  Absolutely. God bless you. Great call.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  All right. We got Laura Limber popping in for two segments,
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  and then I'm going to go right back to all your calls.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  In the order they receive, Christopher in Alabama is up next,
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  and then Omar is up next, and then Cruz.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  And then right through everybody else, James and Jonathan,
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  I'll get to all of you, Harry. Harry, we'll get to everybody.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  Laura Loomer found the fake impersonator body double of Kamala Harris,
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  and the Democrats were there protecting her.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  They were putting her on as like, look, it's Halloween.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  Everything with these people is a scam.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Who would even think up crap like this?
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  So Laura Loomer confronted him.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  She's running for Congress in Trump's district,
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  and she is in the polls winning, even in skewed polls,
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  but we'll see what happens with the scalduggery.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  It's all coming up.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com, and electionnight.news.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  That's the uncensored link for now.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  Share electionnight.news.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  Anti-Goddy, anti-family, anti-cop, anti-constitution, anti-bill of rights,
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  anti-comincense people into martyrs.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  No offensive violence.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  No killing or shooting anybody that isn't trying to kill or shooting you.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  I have no desire for this.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  We have been talking about the Democrats calling for civil war,
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  calling for an overrun in the White House, calling for killing Trump,
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  calling for killing cops. It's all over the news.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  You see the violent attacks, and we're simply saying that if they kill Trump
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  or have a fraudulent election and throw him out of office
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  and come after us, people won't be ready to defend themselves.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Defense, not offense. Look out for false flags.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  or government that'll pay them. It's that simple.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  They'd use our open free society against us.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  The controlled media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  and obsess over it. They see he's a liar on purpose,
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  even though our success rate, our accuracy rate is way, way better than theirs.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  We try to tell the truth. They try to lie. They try to deceive.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  I'm trying to get people to realize that the globalists operate,
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  how they manipulate, how they bamboozle the public.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  I'm trying to get the public to ask questions
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  and to not believe what they're told in the face.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  I'm trying to get people to research for themselves.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  The globalists and their controlled corporate press say that researching
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  and not trusting media is evil and is a conspiracy theory.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  But again, on its face, that is a fraud.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Question everything, question info wars, add your own research to it
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  and then decide what you're going to promote to others
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  and what news sources are accurate.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  I believe info wars is the best source out there.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  I've got you with me tonight.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  Laura Loomer's done it again.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  Let's go to Loomkin Park, Texas.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  Waiting and waiting in the boards.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Bizarre.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  The successful afterlivers.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  Biden campaigns since Kamala body double to Florida.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  Big news. Laura Loomer confronted her.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  Between Hank Williams paint songs
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  and Lou Berry's train songs
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  and blue eyes crying in the rain.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  Out of looking box tax.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  Ain't nobody feeling no pain.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  Europe opposed draconian lockdowns
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  and cases were surging and deaths were surging.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  But think of it, draconian, now they have to do it all over again.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  What the hell are they doing?
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  I think I'm going to go over and explain it to them,
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  but they're locking down parts of Europe again.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  By the way, when you think about it though in all fairness,
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  look what China has done to the world.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  China's reopened.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  All right, Laura Loomer has done it again.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  She's in Florida, in her district, prompts district,
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  prompted for her last week.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  And there is this woman posing with the campaign staff
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  like she's Kamala, they're all cheering for her.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  And Laura Loomer goes over and says,
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  what in the hell is going on with you
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  acting like she's got secret service?
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  This is the level of their supporters
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  are like lobotomized children.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  We've got video coming up of a woman crying saying,
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  I just voted for Biden, even though he's a pedophile
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  and she's crying, embarrassed, she did it.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  That's coming up.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  But Laura Loomer, here's some of the video
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  of just what happened last night.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  I mean, it's her, it's Kamala, we're with her.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  Oh my God, I mean, it's all make-believe.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  They even know she's not Kamala, they don't care.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  That's not Kamala Harris.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  That's not Kamala Harris, it looks nothing like her.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  Very deceptive to the voters to send body doubles out.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  Very deceptive.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  Look at these cooks.
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  The fake Kamala Harris.
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  All right, joining us is Laura Loomer.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  Laura, a congressional candidate,
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  a head even in their skewed polls,
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  Buster's massive fraud set to win tomorrow big,
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  Hillary put a tweet out.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  She said, oh, the election is not over
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  until all the votes have been counted.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  They admit their strategy is never have all the votes counted.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  Just like Bill Gates says,
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  we'll never end the lockdown until there's not one COVID case.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  Well, it's a new virus they created.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  It's never going to go away.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  I mean, it's like saying we can never open America
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  until TB is gone.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  They didn't find the cure, never will probably.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  Laura Loomer, this is a big deal.
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  It's very emblematic of the plastic banana baloney
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  of these people.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Yeah.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  Look, like everything about the Democrat party
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  is completely fake and manufactured.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  And you're right.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  Look, this is why we need every single Republican,
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  every single free thinking American patriot,
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  regardless of your party affiliation to get out
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  and vote down ballot Republican,
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  because this is the site of our lifetime.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  Okay.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  And yesterday, just at the polls to give you an example,
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  the same polling location where I caught the Biden campaign
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  sending a fake Kamala Harris body double.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  They were actually calling the police on me and Republicans
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  and just everyday voters who didn't want to wear masks
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  at the polls.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  There was a black man who showed up in a MAGA hat
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  and he started talking about abortion
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  and how he was voting for Trump and voting Republican
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  and encouraged people to not vote for Joe Biden
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  after Kamala and Biden have locked up so many black men.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  They've locked up more black men together
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  than anybody else on this planet, right?
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  And the white liberal Biden supporters
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  were trying to call the cops on this free thinking black man.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  So, you know, they want to shut you down.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  They want to ban you for posting facts.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  They want to de-platform you.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  If you're speaking the truth,
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  they want to force you to wear a mask.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  Okay.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  We're talking about medical Sharia here.
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  I really don't see a difference between forcing somebody
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  to wear a face mask and forcing somebody to wear a face mask.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:00.000]  By the way, did you coin that?
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  This is medical Sharia.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  Yeah.
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  That's what I'm calling it.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  That is my term for it because I don't see any difference
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  between forcing people to cover up their face with a mask.
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  Okay.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:12.000]  You're silencing them.
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  You're calling the cops on them.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  You're trying to lock them up.
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:17.000]  This is what they do to women in the Middle East.
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  You know, you want to stay locked up.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  You want to be covered up for the rest of your life.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  Move to the Middle East.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  This is definitely out of Islamic playbook.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  This is definitely there.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  Laura Lummer.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  The fact is she gets out of a black SUV
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  with fake secret service.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  We've got radio listeners describe this with people.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  And they actually, she comes up and is saying,
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  I'm Kamala and they're taking photos with her.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  But this is just how dumb are these people?
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  What the hell is their problem?
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  It goes to show you how dumb the Biden campaign thinks the voters
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  are and how dumb their staffers actually are.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  Because they went as far as renting a stretch limo, Alex.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  And then they showed up.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  This is how evil these people are is they try to trick minorities.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  Right.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  So this is a predominantly black and Hispanic polling location
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  in the Lantana branch library.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  And you see, I would never think I'm going to speak to black folks
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  or Hispanics when he put on a clown outfit because they're dumb.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  Why do they think like that?
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  Why do they do this?
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  I don't know.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  But you see it.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  You can hear in the video all the black women chanting,
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  oh, it's Kamala, Kamala, Kamala.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  And then you see the Biden staffer on video taking a selfie with her.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  And I'm like, hey, dude, that's not Kamala Harris.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  You're being duped.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  Are you kidding me?
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  And then you see him kind of look nonchalantly.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  And he even really-
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  And then you cause them on the tape.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  That's correct me if I'm wrong, Laura.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  They then run away though.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  Because he was going to probably hang out for hours.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  Yeah, because I called them out.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  So then they had this stretch limo pull up around the other side
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  and then they're running.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  And then you see they're looking back at me because I caught them on camera.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  And again, these are the same people that said hospitals were all full
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  and had actors posing, going in circles.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  That's now confirmed.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  Yeah.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  And you know, I have the rest of the video hasn't even been released.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  I have the Biden staffers on video and I'll send it to InfoWars exclusively
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  if you want.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  The Biden staffers saying, who cares if it's not the real Kamala Harris?
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  It doesn't matter.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  So they even admit that they don't care if it's real or not
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  because they're trying to dupe voters.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  And you have all these voters with the polls waiting in line
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  getting excited thinking that Kamala Harris is actually campaigning,
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  taking selfies with her.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  Yeah, send it to us during the break.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  Because I want to come back.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  I want to play the clip.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  I want to play this other one.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  But this is the thing.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  It's like they say there's not two genders.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  Then they target little mentally ill boys that have autism
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  and tell them we're going to do your hair.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  You're a girl.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  Let's chop your balls off.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  And it's a Tavistock Institute plan to sterilize men.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  I mean, admittedly, we know the plan.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  I'm not against a dude that wants to grow up and say he's a woman.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  I'm a libertarian at that level.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  But I mean, the idea.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  And you know what's crazy about this is the Democrats,
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  they tried everything that they accused the Republicans of.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  They're doing themselves.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  They're classic projectors.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  How many times have we seen liberals and deranged leftists on CNN saying,
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  oh, I think President Trump and Milani are having marital problems.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  It looks like President Trump sent a body double to his rallies to represent Milania.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  Meanwhile, the Republicans aren't utilizing body doubles.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  Remember when they called me and you conspiracy theorists when Hillary was running
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  and we said she was using body doubles because she was?
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  Well, now we actually have it on video.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  The Democrats are using body doubles.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  Joe Biden doesn't have the energy.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  Kamala Harris doesn't have the energy to campaign.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  So they're shoving him in the basement.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  And then they're sending out, they're sending out body doubles with masks.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  And this is why they want people to wear masks, Alex,
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  because if you take the mask off, you're going to see it's a body double.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  If you stabilize this society, it just gets us ready for fraud.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  And stay there.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  I'm going to come back to Laura Loomer because this is so big.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  I'm remembering now videos we've seen that look like fake Kamala Harris body doubles before.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  People said, hey, that's not Kamala Harris.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  And it isn't.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  They're doing this all over the place.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  These people are crazy.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  I mean, who knows?
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  Maybe the real Kamala Harris is dead.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  Who knows?
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  It's all on record.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  And then again, six months ago to war game, how to get the public to stay locked down
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  during a pandemic and how to get the public to take inoculations.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  And they talk about calling people heroes that do it.
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  This has all been psychologically tested.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  It's all been psychologically prepared.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  Once they get locked down for 15 days, you notice now they say it's permanent.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  That's how it works.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  No.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  That's the allegory.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  We got to bust out of this thing now.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  We got to say no now.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  We got to make a run for it now, but we still can't.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  Once he gets us in that basement, it's going to get a lot, lot worse, folks.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  So stop submitting.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  What am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  And it's the fact that info wars more than 25 years ago doing basic research with what
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying developed the hypothesis
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  that the communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transform to China
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  Now China owns the debt.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  Now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  But again, it wasn't that hard.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  on that issue.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  We did.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  And you focused on it by supporting us and info wars.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  So when you go to infowarstore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts,
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  literally helped make up the world what's really happening.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  I want to thank you for your support.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  Thank you.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  Welcome back.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  On the eve of the election, we got 24 hour coverage starting tomorrow at 8am central.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  I want to thank the great crew that's here.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  We've beefed up the crew the last year ahead of this, but it's still a skeleton crew to
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  go 24 hours a day, day after day, but we're going to be doing it with your calls, your
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  analysis, videos, the stuff that's censored that big tech doesn't want you to see like
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  the laptop story.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  All that is coming out and more things even bigger election fraud.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  You name it, we're checking the emails.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  We're getting calls.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  We're taking your calls.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  We're talking to experts.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  We're going to be putting on air all the stuff they don't want you to know about starting
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  tomorrow morning.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  Hell, we're doing it right now.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  But it's not a theory and I'm not against people that have theater degrees.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  Hell, Rob Dew works here and has a theater degree and does a great job as our news director.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  So I like the theater, but liberals tend to go get theater degrees and there's not a lot
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  of Hollywood jobs now.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  And so they mainly then get into politics.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  That's a fact.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  And so I noticed with the left, it's all about show.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  It's all about theater.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  It's all about, you know, mask and social justicing and virtue signaling.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  And then Kamala Harris has a body double and now we learn more body doubles.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  And this is just, it's like all Halloween.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  It's all just show.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  Except the lockdown starved 2 million people to death already in Africa.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  It's not funny.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  It's not cute.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  But they never take responsibility for what they've done.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  So Laura Lummer caught this yesterday in Palm Beach at a mainly minority polling place.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  Them saying, it's Kamala.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  And then you want to believe Kamala came to see me and she looks a lot like her and you're
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  like, yay, Kamala.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  They're like, yeah, it's just these, you know, dumb minorities were conning.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  I mean, this is sick.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  This, if this has been a bunch of white people, it'd be the same thing too.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  But it's the staffers trying to manipulate these poor people.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  This is sick, evil deception.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  But there was Toto.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  There was the, you know, the two-year-old, they're not saying she's a two-year-old,
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  but the allegory saying the emperor is not wearing any clothes.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  Somebody's got to call BS and Laura Lummer did it.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  Go ahead and roll the video again, please.
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  And then staffers pose to prime the pump to con everyone.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  That's not Kamala Harris.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  God, these are criminals, man.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  God, these are sickos, man.
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  It looks nothing like her.
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  They fundamentally want to con.
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  The voters to send body doubles out.
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  There's a secret service.
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:01.000]  Very deceptive.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  It's a fake Kamala Harris.
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  That's a party of frauds.
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  It's who they are.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  Laura Lummer, you've knocked it out of the park.
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  Hillary says, though, they're going to just contest the election.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  What are you expecting?
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  What are the numbers you're seeing in your race?
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  They're in that key state of Florida, just in general.
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  How's the president doing?
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  It looks like he's doing from internal numbers we've seen and also the internet metrics,
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  a bigger landslide than last time.
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  What do you think?
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  From the numbers I'm seeing on the ground, President Trump is three to four points ahead
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  right now, which would indicate obviously a landslide, because as they say,
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  how goes Florida, goes the nation.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:54.000]  I'm pulling ahead of Lois Frankel, even though the media just wants to push out fake polls
[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  and fake information about my race.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:58.000]  I'm telling you, we go to the polls.
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:30:59.000]  We go anywhere.
[1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  People recognize me.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  I have Biden supporters in line who say they're not voting for Trump,
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  but they're voting for me.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  Lois Frankel is one of the most hated members of Congress, one of the laziest members of
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  Congress, and I'm confident that I'm going to make history tomorrow by becoming the
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  youngest woman ever elected to Congress, and also the first key platformed and banned candidate.
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:23.000]  Look, Kamala Harris is sending out fake body doubles to the polls, the Biden campaign,
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  and I just sent you guys another angle so you can see up close when I confronted them
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  even more.
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  She turned around and tried to pretend like she was doing something with some campaign
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  literature to not be on camera.
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  You can load that video up next.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  But President Trump was in Miami, Florida last night at 11.30 at night, okay?
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  In Miami-Dade where they have mass mandates and lockdowns still, and he was able to get
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  tons of people out there.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  It was an absolute party in Miami-Dade County for President Trump, and there's no energy
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  for Joe Biden.
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:00.000]  I mean, there's such a lack of energy that they have to have fake body doubles at the
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  polls, Alex.
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  If this is a free and fair election, Trump wins, I win, Republicans win across the board.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  But look, they're already trying to intimidate voters by scaring people saying, oh, if you
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  live in a major city, you know, you can't buy any ammo, all the guns are sold out, all
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  the ammo is sold out, we're boarding up the businesses because who's going to riot?
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  Well, it's not the Trump supporters that are rioting, it's the Antifa, okay?
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  And the fact that businesses and police officers are even encouraging businesses to board up
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  their businesses in the-
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  They're trying to get them to do it.
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  In fact, I'm glad you raised that.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  Here's Trump, his last night's Florida rally till 1 a.m. despite curfew, says Fox News.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  It's like when I was at Joe Rogan's studio, he tested everyone for COVID.
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  We were all clean.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  Then we all took a photo together, and the London Independent said they need to social
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  distance, arrest them.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  They're using this selectively to go after everybody and try to kill dissent.
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  Here it is.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  Screw that mayor's curfew that tries to violate people's free speech and a political rally
[1:32:58.000 --> 1:32:59.000]  with the president.
[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  And I'm glad that President Trump is trumping all their action and calling Fauci out and
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:06.000]  calling the European lockdowns out.
[1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  I mean, we're seeing here in the final days, full Trump.
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:10.000]  It's the best I've seen yet.
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  I am really excited, Laura.
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:16.000]  I'm excited too, and I think the people have had enough.
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:21.000]  That's why they were booing Carlos Jimenez last night, who in fact voted for Hillary Clinton
[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  in 2016 and is now coming around as a so-called Trump supporter.
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  So the people have had enough.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  I mean, these are Republicans that are Trump rally booing him.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  You know, not booing the president, but booing this rhino.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  This rhino who is trying to force people to wear masks.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  So I'm glad to see that the Republicans in the base are starting to call out a lot of
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  these rhinos who are enabling the globalists on the radical left.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  Let me show a 30-second clip of a rally in Georgia before he went to Miami last night.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  This guy's doing five, six events a day now.
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  Just a total trojan.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  An absolute barbarian.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  Here it is.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  I think Trump has handled things about as perfectly as you could.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  Pragmatically, being here seven days a week, watching every second of it.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  Laura Loomer running for Congress there.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  The president voted for you last week.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  I think the president's done a superhuman job.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  I'm just being honest.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  I'm not kissing his ass.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  I'm just being honest.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  Superhuman, Laura.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  God-given.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  What do you think of this?
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  Well, look, you've got a lot of energy, and if somebody who's running for Congress myself
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  right now, I mean, I'm at the polls all day long in the glaring heat and the sun,
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  getting sunburned, talking to voters, trying to reach people with no social media,
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  and the president gets attacked every single day,
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  and he travels across the country in those three rallies.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  I'm just going to tell you, the presidents of the United States have more stamina
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  and more energy than most people my age,
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  because sometimes I get tired just watching him at these rallies,
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  so you've got to give it to him.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  I've never seen such an energetic and enthusiastic president in my life,
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  and we're in the final stretch, less than 40 hours to go,
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  so the results come in, and the fact that the president has this much energy
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  to go to one o'clock in the morning, it's amazing.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  By the way, for folks who don't know, it means he's in his 70s.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  Exactly, 74.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  It's the weather.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  It's the helicopters.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  It's the Secret Service.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  It's the dignitaries.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  It's all the behind the scenes.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  That's what's stressful, not even the speeches.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  It's the travel.
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  This guy's all, believe me, folks, I've talked to rock stars that couldn't do this
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  in their prime.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  He is doing stuff he's God sent, and we should be thanking God for Donald Trump
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  and for Laura Loomer.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  Laura Loomer, everybody's got to get out tomorrow and vote for you, sweetheart,
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  but regardless, I think you're going to win.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  You came from behind, but regardless, you are a winner because you're a fighter
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  and you have positioned yourself regardless to get into Congress,
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  and we are so excited.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  Well, thank you, Alex, and we have a final stretch left,
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  and I still need people to support my campaign.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  We still have things we need to pay for.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  So if anybody's listening, please go to Laura Loomer for congress.com
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  and donate whatever you can, whether it's $5, 10, $20,
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  because it's not over till it's over.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  And tell me, you've got lawyers ready to contest things, right?
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  Because you know they're going to try to steal it.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  You've got lawyers ready, right?
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  We have our lawyers ready, and that's why I still need people to contribute
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  to my campaign.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  We have lawyers ready.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  No, exactly.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  No, it's this war text money.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  The end of the war takes cash, folks.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  We love you.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  Thank you, Laura.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  Look it up for yourself.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  The head of the Davos Group issued a report
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  one six months ago calling for world government
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  to be openly established to respond to COVID-19,
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  and the COVID-19 was a blessing to lower the planet's carbon footprint.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  Since then, Prince Charles and countless others have come out
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  and said the exact same thing.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  The most ancient form of total war is called siege,
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  and that's when you cut people off from their resources.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  That's when you lock them down.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalists
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  or just get rid of Donald Trump.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  That's only part of it.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  This is siege to literally train us to be poor
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  and to get us into deep debt.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  with the social credit score surveillance grid.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  So you've heard the U.S. Army saying our job is to kill people
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  and break things?
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  Well, that's what the lockdown's doing.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  It's starving the third world, millions and millions of debt.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  It's breaking down the supply chain in society.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  It's their mission.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  Infowars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  of big government corruption for over two decades.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  It is why they attack us.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  And it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  Evil has infested governments everywhere.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  But the evil establishment is censoring content across all media platforms.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  They blocked you from sharing banned.video on social media.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  So go to electionnight.news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines,
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  Bill Gates and Big Pharma.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  Go to electionnight.news to find all the information the crooked establishment
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  is most afraid of.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  Go to electionnight.news and share now.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  And why is that?
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree like bush grows from it
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  that produces more mustard seeds.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  They didn't know why.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  Well, with modern science, we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of selenium.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  We have bio-true selenium sold out for months back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  At 50% off, store-wide free shipping and triple-patriot points.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  Bio-true selenium at infowarsstore.com is an amazing product.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  And it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  It is an essential nutrient in the body that you actually have to have.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  It's back in stock, 50% off, triple-patriot points at infowarsstore.com and with free shipping.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  Remember, don't worry, be happy, everything's going to be all right.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  Over and over, you're over-told.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  Let the technocracies spy on you.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  Let big tech control what you do.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  They will never abuse their power.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  They will never hurt you.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  And just as soon as they got their global AI grid in, they used Communist China as the beta test
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  to sell the world on a dystopic martial law lockdown.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  When it all started eight, nine months ago, I told you it's never going to end.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  They're never going to turn loose this power.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  They're going to make you have internal passports on your phones to leave your house, to have a job, to travel.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  They're going to add more and more restrictions on of how you could that travel pass.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  Remember the Running Man?
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  The Schwarzenegger movie, the mid-80s, written by Stephen King about a future police state?
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Watch that movie and then compare it to today.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  We are in the absolute brand, the absolute mold of a classic authoritarian dystopic nightmare.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  We've got to reject this now before it's submitted.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  We're all living in America.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  In 2020, Donald Trump is president with a zombie as his enemy.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  Let's get right into it and back to your phone calls.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  Hillary Clinton came out three hours ago and said,
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  the election will be over when all the votes are counted.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  Because they sent out a bunch of fake ones that are sitting on top of.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  New from Biden campaign manager, Jim O'Malley,
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  Dylan, under no circumstances, under no scenario,
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  will Donald Trump be declared a victor on election night.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  Under no scenario, even if they were all counted,
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  even if the evidence shows he won by such a landslide that all other ballots would,
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  counted for Biden wouldn't add up to a Biden victory, it doesn't matter.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  No, no, no, we're not going to do it.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  We're going to break off our states and take control of them.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  We control it, we stole it, we work for the Chinese.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  Communists, you won't stop us.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  Don't worry, Twitter and Facebook and Google say there's seven trusted groups
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  that are allowed to declare the election.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  The same ones that censor everything.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  ABC, AP, CNN, CBS, the discussion desk HQ, Fox News and NBC,
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  which means MSNBC, there are two separate bills.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  So there you go, folks, it's on, it's crazy, it's insane, it's wild.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Let's jam in five calls right now in the next nine minutes.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  Who is up next? Christopher in Alabama.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  Come on down, Christopher.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  Alex, man, great to talk to you, man.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  I'm telling you now that the Haskell, Ray, a bar,
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  all these people have to be put out of commission for us to keep going to the country.
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  Not because we want them to, you know, feel bad and feel like an idiot.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  If we don't do anything to stop these people, they're going to continue to do this.
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  This is about the rest of the world, the rest of the future, the rest of the world.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  I agree, and they've committed so many crimes now and don't get in trouble
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  so the crimes get bigger and more insane.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  It's about the media, they have took over the entire country, man.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  I mean, this was 200 years ago, George Washington would have had these people on a spike,
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  they would have been hanging and swinging.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  Well, there's no doubt that Trump's right.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  The mainstream media is the enemy of the American people, brother.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  This is not fair to our future, our kids, our grandkids, our great grandkids.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  Sir, I agree, it's an attempted foreign multinational takeover.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  I mean, this is an attempted takeover of the country, you're damn right.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  But they've already took almost everything over, Alex, we have to fight back.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  And Trump's all we have, if Trump is Trump.
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  I totally agree, God bless you.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  Thanks for holding, sir.
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  All right, next up.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  John in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  Me?
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  Yes.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  Okay, I got lots of questions asked, but I'll try and keep this brief,
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  so I'm only going to ask you one question.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  This is the election.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  I'm going to be honest, I'm really scared.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  Say that again, your phone's breaking up.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  You have a question about the election, go ahead.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  Okay, well, I got lots of questions, but I'm only going to ask you one.
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  In terms of the election, I'm pretty scared that it's going to get stolen.
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  And earlier, you said California will probably flip red, but I really,
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  I want to contradict you, but I highly doubt it.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  No, no, no, I don't think it's going to vote for Trump.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  I'm saying it's really red, sir.
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  The Democrats, once they take over, engage in fraud.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  California's going to go blue.
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  I'm saying it's really red.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  Okay.
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  Well, I mean, anyway, I'm pretty scared that this election is going to get stolen,
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  and I can't speak for everyone, but it's going to spark a second silver war,
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  one way or another.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  In fact, it's going to get stolen.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  Well, yeah, that's what the chai comms want,
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  and that's what the Democrats know they're losing,
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  so their orders are break the country up,
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  and so that's going to be their move.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  So the moment of truth is here.
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  Okay.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  What I really want to ask you about.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  Sure.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  Your phone's a little weird, so just get your question real quick, brother.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  Okay.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  The Libertarian Party.
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  Joe Jorgensen.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  I don't know if you've talked about this.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  Joe Jorgensen, the Libertarian Party has been gaining a lot of speed,
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  and I don't need to diminish or patronize the Libertarian Party,
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  but if they can come in second place,
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  that'll make Biden stealing the election that much harder.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  Actually, they think most Libertarian votes take from Republicans.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  I appreciate your call.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  The Libertarian Party has a bunch of Democrats running, in my view.
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  I mean, I like some Libertarian ideas on social issues,
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  but overall, they're a joke.
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  I'm not trying to poo-poo what you're saying, sir.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  I was going to move the next caller.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  Your phone's really echoey.
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  I can barely understand it.
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  Okay.
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  Let's take another call here.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  Let's talk to Harry in Oklahoma.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  Go ahead, sir.
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  How's it going?
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  Welcome, sir.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  Go ahead.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  Thank you.
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  The amount of support we have for Trump is unparalleled.
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  It's completely obvious.
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  I think we have Biden voters trying to switch their votes for Trump.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  But my question is, I'm wondering if for the next four years,
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  whether or not Trump will be elected or Biden,
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  if Fauci will stick around with all the money and resources
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  we have invested into the vaccine, the national stockpile,
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  all the states going into lockdown and doing the testing?
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  No, I hear you.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  I didn't mean to talk over you.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  I was just telling them, get clip one ready,
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  because Trump knows how to take control from them.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  Oh, Bill Gates wants to control vaccines.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  He wants to tell you when they're coming out.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  Trump takes control of other vaccines just to kill it,
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  make it an on-issue,
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  and then we forget about it that nobody takes the vaccine.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:12.000]  I know Trump's tactic doesn't mean I totally agree with it,
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  but absolutely, he's going to fire Fauci.
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  Fauci's finally risen his ugly head.
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  Let's play a clip of Trump talking about this last night.
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  Here it is.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  Because all they want to do, you're turning the news.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  We'd like to talk about COVID, and then next time,
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  here's what happens November 4th.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  You won't hear too much about it.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  You won't hear too much about it.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  Fire Fauci!
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  Don't tell anybody,
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  but let me wait till a little bit after the election, please.
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  You know where Fauci...
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  I appreciate you.
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:07.720]  You know where fire Fauci came from fire Fauci came from us in April
[1:48:08.720 --> 1:48:12.680]  Here in Austin, Texas, so I started the chant fire Fauci and it spread across the land
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:19.320]  And I'm gonna try to take credit for it shows what grassroots activity does because it's obvious then I started saying that's not enough
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:26.440]  Arrest Fauci we have the arrest Fauci and Bill Gates t-shirt limited edition available at infowarstore.com Harry
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:28.440]  So you brought that up go ahead
[1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:30.440]  right so
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:33.880]  So all the money and the resources they have invested into all these vaccines
[1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:41.960]  Especially the the u.s. You know with with Fauci there. There's 179 vaccines. You mentioned the mRNA vaccine earlier
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:45.160]  There's not just one mRNA vaccine there. There's seven
[1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:48.520]  And so there they're all these different
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:54.760]  Vaccines and like I said the mass immunity immunization events that they have coming up
[1:48:54.760 --> 1:49:01.560]  Um, but yeah as far as yesterday when Trump said, you know after the election might fire Fauci
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:06.040]  I don't I think that's that's
[1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:12.120]  They're gonna bring that up again all the vaccine the lockdown. Well, let's be clear what the mRNA vaccine is and you're right
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:16.360]  There's more than seven. There's actually hundreds are developing but seven the gates is involved in
[1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:19.640]  Right, he says you got to take four to five a year
[1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:26.600]  To test it on you and see what works. So you're literally becoming a guinea pig or a chinchilla or a lab rat
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.800]  It's illegal. It's bs and people are rioting
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:35.320]  In a socialist controlled state of brazil where they're announcing forced inoculations next month
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:40.920]  Bolsonaro is trying to block it, but it's the socialist saying you're gonna wear a mask
[1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:46.600]  You're gonna take shots worldwide. This is their move is medical tyranny to scare us. They tried class warfare
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:51.000]  They tried race warfare. They tried calling everybody nazis that didn't work. So now
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:55.960]  We're just gonna put a mask on you. You can't leave your house. It's it's a cult takeover thinking for the call
[1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:01.720]  All right next caller cruise in maryland cruise. Thanks for holding you're on the air
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:09.480]  Hey, alex, uh, thanks for having me on the uh calling everything. Um, honestly what I think about the election is uh, well
[1:50:09.880 --> 1:50:14.040]  I live in carol county, maryland, and it's kind of a uh, it's just more of a red county
[1:50:14.040 --> 1:50:17.400]  But you know, maryland being a very blue almost every other time
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:19.640]  um
[1:50:19.640 --> 1:50:22.440]  I've just seen a flood of just trump trump trump
[1:50:22.920 --> 1:50:25.880]  support and it's just it I like to see it but um
[1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:28.040]  I just don't know
[1:50:28.040 --> 1:50:34.520]  I think that trump will end up becoming victorious and now we're gonna see uh trump come into uh his second term
[1:50:34.600 --> 1:50:41.000]  But I think they're gonna contest the election and that uh during the contesting they're gonna like you said the riots that are going to be huge
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:42.040]  um
[1:50:42.040 --> 1:50:46.040]  I just want to I don't know if I think about it. You know, that's what I'm kind of worried about but um
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:48.920]  Other than that, I mean, that's what I think about the election
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:56.120]  Brother, I agree with you. It's totally insane. What's going down and we're just trying our best to navigate through this
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:50:59.640]  And it's not that trump's perfect or you're perfect or I'm perfect. It's that we're americans
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:06.200]  We believe in our system. It's a lot better than other systems and foreign banks and foreign corporations and the chinese communist
[1:51:07.160 --> 1:51:11.000]  And that's so much power. They look at our open free society and they go those are a bunch of weaklings
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:12.360]  We can take them over
[1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:17.960]  Because they've gotten away with so much. They think we're stupid and now they're going for bro. Thank you so much for your call
[1:51:18.440 --> 1:51:20.040]  All right, i'ma start the next hour
[1:51:20.040 --> 1:51:24.520]  15 minutes of more calls and dr. Steve pacinic pops in to give us his take on what trump's doing right
[1:51:24.520 --> 1:51:30.280]  What trump's doing wrong and inside baseball from the intelligence community about what's coming next that's in the third hour
[1:51:30.680 --> 1:51:32.360]  We're going to be right back
[1:51:32.360 --> 1:51:34.360]  Spread the election site
[1:51:34.360 --> 1:51:40.840]  election 2020 is here and whether trump wins or loses
[1:51:41.640 --> 1:51:47.400]  We have all won by exposing the commons chinese by exposing the globalist by exposing the pedophile rings
[1:51:48.040 --> 1:51:52.200]  By exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil
[1:51:52.840 --> 1:51:56.920]  Now i'm personally a christian and i believe in god and i know god's real and i've experienced it in my life
[1:51:57.400 --> 1:51:59.160]  Believe you don't believe in god
[1:51:59.160 --> 1:52:02.360]  It's important to recognize that there is good in this world. There is evil
[1:52:02.360 --> 1:52:06.040]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing bad
[1:52:06.840 --> 1:52:13.000]  And what i see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally get that
[1:52:13.560 --> 1:52:16.200]  They finally understand that they're not being naive anymore
[1:52:16.840 --> 1:52:18.840]  Don't ever project your decency
[1:52:19.400 --> 1:52:24.360]  And your goodness onto other people until they've proven what they stand for and who they are
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:25.960]  Where you're going to get hurt
[1:52:25.960 --> 1:52:30.120]  But those of you out there have done your own research and discovered who's good and who is faithful
[1:52:30.120 --> 1:52:37.160]  Will then come together with those organizations and support them like info wars without your support info wars would not exist
[1:52:39.480 --> 1:52:41.080]  It's all on record
[1:52:41.080 --> 1:52:44.120]  Yale, harvard, princeton, stanford
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:46.680]  They were all hired a year ago
[1:52:47.320 --> 1:52:52.920]  And then again six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic
[1:52:53.400 --> 1:52:55.320]  And how to get the public to take
[1:52:55.320 --> 1:53:03.080]  Anoculations and they talk about calling people heroes that do it. They talk about shaming those that don't this has all been psychologically tested
[1:53:04.200 --> 1:53:09.720]  It's all been psychologically prepared and once they get you to lock down for 15 days, you notice now they say it's permanent
[1:53:10.280 --> 1:53:16.680]  That's how it works. Oh, just put these handcuffs on the serial killer says the woman and the parking lot and everything will be all right
[1:53:17.480 --> 1:53:18.440]  No
[1:53:18.440 --> 1:53:24.120]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killers fan. He's taking us to his
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:27.880]  Shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death. That's the allegory
[1:53:28.440 --> 1:53:31.160]  We got to bust out of this thing now. We got to say no now
[1:53:31.320 --> 1:53:34.680]  We got to make a run for it now and we still can't once he gets us in that base
[1:53:34.680 --> 1:53:38.280]  But it's going to get a lot a lot worse folks. So stop submitting
[1:53:41.720 --> 1:53:44.360]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:52.360]  You look like an angel
[1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:54.360]  Walk like an angel
[1:53:54.360 --> 1:53:56.360]  Walk like an angel
[1:53:56.360 --> 1:53:58.360]  Talk like an angel
[1:53:58.360 --> 1:54:00.360]  But I got a prize
[1:54:00.360 --> 1:54:02.360]  You're the devil
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:08.360]  Yeah, but the democrats don't even look like an angel. They don't talk like an angel. They walk and talk like a crib keeper
[1:54:08.360 --> 1:54:10.360]  And they lie instead
[1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:14.360]  It looks like an angel. Melania never even talks other than the Lord's prayer
[1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:20.360]  The bad enough is you're looking woman like that smart looking woman like that
[1:54:20.360 --> 1:54:22.360]  Was actually telling me lies, but she's not
[1:54:24.360 --> 1:54:28.360]  Instead it's a bunch of hunchback skexie demons telling me lies
[1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:32.360]  There's an article now on info wars.com
[1:54:32.360 --> 1:54:34.360]  There's an article now on info wars.com
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:36.360]  There's an article now on info wars.com
[1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:40.360]  There's an article now on info wars.com by Paul Joseph Watson
[1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:42.360]  It's official
[1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:44.360]  Biden campaign manager under no scenario
[1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:46.360]  Will trump be allowed to declare victory
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:48.360]  That's a quote
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:54.360]  I mean, they're not even hiding it and twitter comes out and says absolutely
[1:54:54.360 --> 1:55:00.360]  No one is allowed to challenge things of the republican only democrats have free speech only democrats
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:02.360]  Can say who they thought one
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:08.360]  Man, they'll do a few token democrats they banned, but this is the internet kill switch right on time going into place
[1:55:08.360 --> 1:55:10.360]  All right
[1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:16.360]  Let me scan through the sea of wonderful collars and who's been holding the longest and that'll be Omar in California
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:18.360]  Omar, thank you for holding go ahead
[1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:26.360]  Hey, how are you doing Alex? It's a pleasure to talk to you sir. It's a honor. I've been waiting to talk to you for 11 years
[1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:28.360]  Wow, go ahead sir
[1:55:28.360 --> 1:55:30.360]  Thank you, sir
[1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:36.360]  Me and my brothers and my family were from Yemen and it looks like it's a siege on America
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:38.360]  It looks like America is
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:40.360]  Being
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:46.360]  Under war basically, you know, like they're shutting down the factories. They're making people poor
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:52.360]  You just said it is classic siege. We're under sanctions. We're under global government sanctions
[1:55:52.360 --> 1:55:56.360]  That's all this is this is exactly what they do in our country in Yemen
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:56:00.360]  And the Middle East right before they're about to make a big move
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:08.360]  They prepare it same thing same thing and the media is going to be the main one that makes the big move the media
[1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:12.360]  You've lived in sir. You've got the floor for two and a half minutes. We love you
[1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:16.360]  Tell us what it's like to go under siege first before you get attacked
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:18.360]  Okay, checkpoints everywhere
[1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:22.360]  They were right before they threw off our president Ali Abdullah Saleh
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:26.360]  And put the country under siege. There's checkpoints everywhere
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:30.360]  You can't talk about certain people in the government
[1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:36.360]  People started people in the government that were not with the president like against them
[1:56:36.360 --> 1:56:40.360]  Sorry coming out and talking bad about him and then bam
[1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:44.360]  Just everything just starts going crazy once they make their first move
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:50.360]  It's you live through a coup against a popular president. You say you see the same thing happening
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:54.360]  Yes, sir. And I want to thank you because you had an interview with some
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:58.360]  I can't remember his name Lindsay something in 2010
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:02.360]  And he talked about how Yemen was going to go under war
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:09.360]  And we listened to that interview me and my family and we got out of Yemen right before the war started because of that interview
[1:57:09.360 --> 1:57:14.360]  So I want to thank you sir. I was able to that was Lindsay Williams who had a major
[1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:20.360]  He had a major oil company executive that he was a chaplain with yeah
[1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:24.360]  And he said keep your eyes on Yemen. Do you remember that? Yes
[1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:34.360]  And then I remember that and because of that interview that you did I was able to watch it and we left Yemen two months before the war started
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:37.360]  Wow, that's the power of the truth brother
[1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:41.360]  And we love you brother and all my family loves you. We love your product
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:46.360]  Well, we appreciate you look at Trump trying to end the wars. He wants peace from the Middle East
[1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:52.360]  He wants to build hotels and make the Middle East beautiful like it used to be and we can all be friends
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:59.360]  The New York the Yemeni they they love Trump now because of the New York is trashed
[1:57:59.360 --> 1:58:03.360]  Everybody loves them now. You know, they're like they're sick of the Democrats
[1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:09.360]  My sister she's been a Democrat all her life in New York now she's sick of them. She's voted for Trump now
[1:58:09.360 --> 1:58:12.360]  What is wrong with the Democrats? They're just devils
[1:58:12.360 --> 1:58:19.360]  You know what I think I think what Trump is trying to do he's trying to show everybody what's going on
[1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:28.360]  He's basically letting them burn themselves out, you know, because in the end we're going to make them, you know, the big decision
[1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:33.360]  But he's trying to show beautiful Omar. We love you glad you've been trying for 10 years. Good to talk to you
[1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:35.360]  Glad we helped you and your family. We're all helping each other here

[2:00:05.360 --> 2:00:14.360]  Fire Fauci
[2:00:14.360 --> 2:00:19.360]  Because all they want to do you turn in and there's COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID
[2:00:19.360 --> 2:00:22.360]  We'd like to talk about COVID and then next time
[2:00:22.360 --> 2:00:28.360]  Here's what happens November 4th. You won't hear too much about it. You won't hear too much about it
[2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:47.360]  Fire Fauci
[2:00:47.360 --> 2:00:59.360]  Don't tell anybody but let me wait till a little bit after the election. I appreciate the event. I appreciate it.
[2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:03.360]  Now he's been wrong a lot. He's a nice man though. He's been wrong a lot.
[2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:14.360]  Fire Fauci
[2:01:14.360 --> 2:01:20.360]  Well from your lips to God's ears and I mean up to God back down to Trump
[2:01:20.360 --> 2:01:25.360]  Here's the New York Times back on April 16th, Alex Jones, Owen Troyer and others
[2:01:25.360 --> 2:01:33.360]  Led an evil rally that didn't show social distancing and all and Jones even shook hands and they chanted Fire Fauci
[2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:35.360]  Arrest Bill Gates
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:45.360]  So there it is memorialized coronavirus feels protest against coronavirus lockdowns or conservatives feel protest against conservative lockdowns
[2:01:45.360 --> 2:01:54.360]  Absolutely incredible time to be alive right now and just the expectation of the last few years the buildup and now we're here
[2:01:54.360 --> 2:02:02.360]  If Trump gets reelected, he's not your normal politician. He's going after them all
[2:02:02.360 --> 2:02:09.360]  He's going to put people in that will go after him and it is going to be retribution
[2:02:09.360 --> 2:02:15.360]  Not in the name of just vengeance but to get these people off our backs and that's why they're so scared and that's why this is so dangerous
[2:02:15.360 --> 2:02:23.360]  This is real. There's not just BS in the universe. We've been living decades of BS and lawyers and politicians and we need behavior
[2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:31.360]  And now it's coming down to real stuff folks. This is very real. This ain't theater. That's why they're so scared
[2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:36.360]  This isn't Republicans and Democrats acting like they're fighting with each other and sharing power
[2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:44.360]  This is the chai comms controlling the Democrats the decision being made in government to join the people and say no to this
[2:02:44.360 --> 2:02:50.360]  And so you got a large contingent in government and corporate America who don't want to sell out the country
[2:02:50.360 --> 2:02:55.360]  And they just operate through people like Trump and myself are willing to put our necks out there
[2:02:55.360 --> 2:03:03.360]  And we're strong we're getting stronger by the minute and I told you last week the enemy began to capitulate as the Chinese agents got arrested around the country
[2:03:03.360 --> 2:03:10.360]  Almost no news coverage and that and that their whole networks were falling and the Chinese started turning money off about two weeks ago
[2:03:10.360 --> 2:03:21.360]  When this Hunter Biden thing came out and so the globalists are scared now they're in their foxholes radio and back to HQ and there ain't any transmission coming back
[2:03:21.360 --> 2:03:32.360]  Which almost makes them more dangerous but it definitely means they're losing so let's not believe we've completed this mission yet
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:41.360]  It's like you're 70 years old your kids are 4045 and you know they have good lives but you still you know not sure they ended up well
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:53.360]  They don't ever count your chickens till their hatch folks but Trump better go after him we better get moral we better go to God we better get on our knees
[2:03:53.360 --> 2:04:03.360]  We better be better people ourselves because this was if Trump gets in this is a major reprieve it's still going to be rough still trade war still globalism
[2:04:03.360 --> 2:04:14.360]  Still control blue states trying to go after your sons trying to go after your daughters and they're still there but I mean this will be a devastating victory
[2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:21.360]  The likes of which we've never experienced if Trump gets elected again and then if we see this through the next four years
[2:04:21.360 --> 2:04:30.360]  But if we squander it and sit around and just stick our thumbs in our you know what's that we deserve what happens all right who's been holding now the longest
[2:04:30.360 --> 2:04:34.360]  That would be Anthony in Florida you're on the air go ahead
[2:04:34.360 --> 2:04:36.360]  Hey Alex
[2:04:36.360 --> 2:04:38.360]  Yes sir
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:47.360]  Hey yeah I think that the president definitely has some good lawyers around him because it's going to become down to the legal aspects of it all
[2:04:47.360 --> 2:05:03.360]  And you should definitely take it before the Supreme Court because quite frankly that is that should that is the law of the land and he's got that good woman in there now and
[2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:05.360]  What do you think about that
[2:05:05.360 --> 2:05:19.360]  Well though Trump knows it's probably coming out of the Supreme Court because the Democrats the Supreme Court just ruled that two states can basically stay open for weeks that's kind of a betrayal Trump's criticized it so I hope I hope the Supreme Court follows the Constitution here because these
[2:05:19.360 --> 2:05:29.360]  ballots were unconstitutional the way they meld them out on purpose to cause this but that's why I'm saying is cross your fingers my friend I'm not sure we're out of this yet
[2:05:29.360 --> 2:05:41.360]  And I was wondering if you could focus a little bit too about some of the national races what's going on nationally as far as races are concerned
[2:05:41.360 --> 2:05:47.360]  Yeah that's a great idea and I'm going to ask Owen shroyer coming up in the war room he's good at that and I am too
[2:05:47.360 --> 2:05:55.360]  Guys give me all the printouts obviously tomorrow as they unfold we're going to be covering the Senate races the House races we're going to be covering good with it
[2:05:55.360 --> 2:06:05.360]  You know all the elections as they come in we're going to have the big board up here we're going to have all the different states will be monitoring CNN Fox News will be monitoring all of them
[2:06:05.360 --> 2:06:15.360]  I'll give you the latest okay thanks Anthony all right let's now go to Jonathan Arizona Jonathan welcome
[2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:25.360]  Hey Alex can you hear me yes sir welcome hey man I just want to do two things man if it's fine with you if I could pray with you and the listeners right now right before the
[2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:34.360]  election because I think now more than ever I think we need the hand of God here over this this country this country that we love everybody should be praying constantly go ahead
[2:06:34.360 --> 2:06:46.360]  Okay so if everybody if you're working wherever you're at if you could bow your head close your eyes real quick in the name of Jesus Father we come before you say you know what for now one of this privilege and this opportunity to come together in unity
[2:06:46.360 --> 2:06:58.360]  over this nation asking you father that you've got the hands father president Trump that you manifest your glory over this election that you give every one of us the strength of power is the wisdom the knowledge the understanding to overcome the
[2:06:58.360 --> 2:07:10.360]  enemy we know that the Bible says that in the last days good will become evil and evil will become good but we are here standing in your righteous word in the name of Jesus declaring victory before we have even entered into the
[2:07:10.360 --> 2:07:24.360]  war we leave ourselves in your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray somebody say amen wherever you're at I'll rather I hear you I can feel the Holy Spirit it's very strong can you feel how strong the spirit is right now I've never felt the
[2:07:24.360 --> 2:07:38.360]  strong definitely definitely I feel chills in my body I'm not even a pastor here in Arizona and I didn't feel it because I know that not only is our Christian nation but our our Patriots are rising up together in unity
[2:07:38.360 --> 2:08:02.360]  Alex I'm a huge fan there's one thing I want to do before I hang up I love when you yell man I love whenever you shout so if I could shout with you man or battle cry I want to do it but my voice is almost gone but I'll do it let's do it
[2:08:02.360 --> 2:08:14.360]  you want a war you got one and they better know they've seen what happened when they set that bus in we peacefully surrounded it they started trying to attack our vehicles then they went and crashed they started the fight
[2:08:14.360 --> 2:08:28.360]  if it goes to a war they're going to lose it and they need to know it they have taken our kindness for weakness and it all ends God bless you Jonathan yeah they had Democrats run folks off the road then they called the FBI they want to defund the police they hate the FBI
[2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:44.360]  they hate everything but oh oh but now it's going to save them absolutely disgusting yeah look at that Biden truck bumping into people look at it play that again it comes over out of its lane and starts bumping the vehicle
[2:08:44.360 --> 2:08:59.360]  and then it's on the news that they attacked the Democrats that guy comes all the way halfway out of his lane and then can't believe it when the Ford truck twice as big as its little vehicle and that is so archetypal
[2:08:59.360 --> 2:09:12.360]  you've got that Ford truck following the Biden vehicle doing nothing and here comes the Lib Tart attacking and now the FBI is investigating a proud boys were there first they demonize the proud boys and I was like oh the proud boys they're bad
[2:09:12.360 --> 2:09:26.360]  well they can do with the proud boys the proud boys are great and then the car couldn't believe it got rammed back that's just the beginning we should have gone out to break not your fault but let's come back in with maybe a road warrior go out the next break the road warrior
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:44.360]  alright Dr. Steve Pacinac on his take on all of this and he's very excited about what Trump's been doing about Dr. Fauci and so much more that's next segment and after he leaves this I'm going to get to J.B. Bill J. Jefferson and many others before this transmission ends before our coverage begins
[2:09:44.360 --> 2:10:10.360]  now it's easier than ever to have Band.video on your iPhone simply go to Band.video with your Safari browser then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen when the menu comes up you simply click add to home screen
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:20.360]  it will then ask you to name the app I suggest Band.video you will now have Band.video app on your home screen despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it
[2:10:20.360 --> 2:10:28.360]  the globalists think you're lazy but by taking a little bit of action you can override them have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app
[2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:44.360]  so it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email on Facebook on Twitter on YouTube however you want be sure and share Band.video
[2:10:58.360 --> 2:11:08.360]  they see he's a liar on purpose even though our success rate our accuracy rate is way way better than theirs we try to tell the truth they try to lie they try to see
[2:11:08.360 --> 2:11:20.360]  I'm trying to get people to realize that the globalists operate how they manipulate how they bamboozle the public I'm trying to get the public to ask questions and do not believe what they're told in the face
[2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:32.360]  I'm trying to get people to research for themselves the globalists and their control corporate press say that researching and not trusting media is evil and is a conspiracy theory

[2:14:56.360 --> 2:15:12.360]  vetted and everything's been right and with this election I live here in southern michigan you can drive all over the whole state and it's all trump everywhere I don't know how there's a possibility that trump doesn't take michigan
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:26.360]  well how's it how's it look at well I totally agree with you that's why I'm about to talk dr c pochette can we just got on the line by the campaign manager under no scenario will trump be allowed to declare victory under no scenario now they're saying we're
[2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:40.360]  never going to capitulate we're never going to concede and he'll never be president Pelosi said that two days ago very cryptically hillary just tweeted the election will be over when all the votes are counted that well they made it where that's impossible so I hear you brother what do you think is going to
[2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:57.360]  happen nick I think trump's going to win in an absolute way by the point where they can't even feel it I mean that's perfect for us I think there's one I mean I agree to you two to one google searches two to one google searches in the last six months how to vote republican versus democrat there's
[2:15:57.360 --> 2:16:12.360]  always other metrics much better than polls show huge victories and then exit polls show way more republicans voting in an early voting than the democrats that's backwards that's the opposite way it usually is I mean this is going to be a landslide but that's the problem they're
[2:16:12.360 --> 2:16:30.360]  just going to have the media say he didn't win it's a crazy time Nick right it's your own quick shout out to my brother in california right now I got a brother James in california the high school football coach and I got a brother Tim in Japan right now with active duty Marine Corps and they're
[2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:46.360]  listening to you right now brother and you're here I can't believe I'm coming on the same day as that kid Omar from Yemen I listened to him live on on the war room with Owen shroyer and his story proved that you are I mean the
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:17:00.360]  truth when it comes to news when it comes to everything else and I just want to think I know I hate you know you don't like saying thank you and stuff but man that that kid I appreciate your call Nick we're all in this together is all I'm saying is
[2:17:00.360 --> 2:17:14.360]  thanking me for self-preservation that's like thanking me for you know not fall off my bicycle I mean I'm just trying to have a good life with all of you here Dr. Steve Pachinic joins us former head of psychological operations at the state department ran major regime change help found Delta
[2:17:14.360 --> 2:17:33.360]  force so much more best-selling author Tom Clancy Steve Pachinic.com he joins us now for the rest of the hour doc I know and I'm glad you're on I was going to get you on last week you wanted to come on though you're very proud of Trump you think he's really doing the right thing now with Fauci and so much more I want to get into the election I want to get into what you think is going to happen how we counter this what they're
[2:17:33.360 --> 2:17:49.360]  going to do they've been very clear now that they're not going to conceive so we got three minutes to break but you go ahead and take over I'm not concerned is not about the Democrats as they think they're that powerful in other words Trump will win either way
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:18:03.360]  Trump will remain in power I can assure you that I can't speak on behalf of the intelligence community but I can say on my behalf that he will remain in position as the president of the United States.
[2:18:03.360 --> 2:18:23.360]  Whatever they might declare whatever Biden might play up but Trump has said it very clearly you have a choice it's either Biden corrupt politicians for 50 years Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters again Feinstein or you have America back again with a businessman which is then the
[2:18:23.360 --> 2:18:44.360]  ethos of this country capitalism entrepreneurship and the ability to build businesses not big tech. So what I suspect will happen is Trump will declare the victory Biden can say whatever he wants but it will be quickly nullified as well Nancy Pelosi they will
[2:18:44.360 --> 2:19:00.360]  not put up any kind of resistance they will claim they will put up as a resistance but I don't expect that resistance to last only because we have other elements on the streets we have pretty strong elements that will protect the
[2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:16.360]  republic remember this is a this is a story about the republic and not what Obama thought a democracy again this president who was a Manchurian candidate didn't even know we're still a republic and he said to all the kids I want you to vote for the
[2:19:16.360 --> 2:19:31.360]  democracy no we're a republic in that republic that military the police will stand appropriately in position to maintain the viability of that republic no matter what else happens.
[2:19:31.360 --> 2:19:46.360]  Biden will say he's gonna have to concede there's really nothing more he can do about it the corruption with Hunter Biden is so great that all I would do if I were in the justice department is whispered to Mr Biden.
[2:19:46.360 --> 2:20:04.360]  That your son will go to prison unless you stop all this nonsense and we're gonna not only take your son but we take you in as a co-conspirator for corruption treason and that is the point that Trump has said that we have never had such a corrupt
[2:20:04.360 --> 2:20:23.360]  administration as we've seen with Biden Obama the Pelosi's and all the Democrats they have to go so we're coming into a new era what I call the state of emergency which I wrote about 27 years ago where we're going back to our roots of entrepreneurship
[2:20:23.360 --> 2:20:40.360]  making America great and making us independent of really what in terms of the nation states we do not need to be part of NATO we do not need to be part of WHO we do not need to be part of anything other than our republic.
[2:20:40.360 --> 2:20:56.360]  All right stay there Dr. Steve Paceniks with us we're on top of the election straight ahead. The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites most cunning smart inventive people believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore they don't believe in being aristocrats
[2:20:56.360 --> 2:21:12.360]  turn to hold up civilization and power the people and once the establishment has that predatory idea civilization collapses very very quickly you can't treat the least of us like garbage and not treat your own family like that and so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us.
[2:21:12.360 --> 2:21:27.360]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil or spurs that commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crimes trying to get away from humanity but really they can't escape the laws of the universe they may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves
[2:21:27.360 --> 2:21:33.360]  but the repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the very structure itself.
[2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:43.360]  Wealth is created by loving God wealth is created by having connection to God God is the source of all creation all success all power we deny that you'll be destroyed.
[2:21:43.360 --> 2:22:01.360]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired even worshiped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations with modern science we know my turmeric is so popular it's antioxidant effect it's anti-inflammatory effect everything it does is simply amazing
[2:22:01.360 --> 2:22:20.360]  and most turmerics out there are simply food products they're 3-5% curcuminoid but we have bodies ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid level and we have other organic products in there that accelerated and bring into the cells of the body.
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:33.360]  It's been sold out for months it's back in stock and despite that bodies ultimate turmeric formula at infolwarstore.com is 50% off with free shipping and triple patriot points at infolwarstore.com.

[2:22:43.360 --> 2:23:01.360]  Okay my fellow patriots we are two days away from the election and the big talking point by the young turds all the communists all the socialists and AOC's people and the Democratic Party and media matters and George Soros is that we want violence and that we offensively want to go out and kill them or attack them.
[2:23:01.360 --> 2:23:14.360]  This is the last thing I ever want that would turn these dirty anti-American, anti-god, anti-family, anti-cop, anti-constitution, anti-bill of rights, anti-common sense people into martyrs.
[2:23:14.360 --> 2:23:22.360]  No offensive violence. No killing or shooting anybody that isn't trying to kill or shooting you. I have no desire for this.
[2:23:22.360 --> 2:23:39.360]  We have been talking about the Democrats calling for civil war, calling for an overrun in the White House, calling for killing Trump, calling for killing cops. It's all over the news. You see the violent attacks and we're simply saying that if they kill Trump or have a fraudulent election and throw them out of office and come after us people have to be ready to defend themselves.
[2:23:39.360 --> 2:23:54.360]  Defense, not offense. Look out for false flags.
[2:23:54.360 --> 2:24:12.360]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live and I'm not telling you this about Steve Pachennick to butter him up. He doesn't care about that.
[2:24:12.360 --> 2:24:25.360]  But I remember he was in the Council on Foreign Relations. He did write the Tom Clancy books. He did run the Camp David Accords. He did the Delta Force thing. He was involved in stuff right up in the 90s and a bunch of stuff after that.
[2:24:25.360 --> 2:24:43.360]  And then I see him doing radio interview and I see a transcript online so I call and get him on the show like in early 2002. He lays out all this stuff and I think most incredible guy, big show, he's got a lot of courage. But then he's on about 15 years ago and he's like the EU will collapse by 2025 and the East Coast and West Coast will.
[2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:56.360]  He'll be the Midwest and the South and all this other stuff and there'll be a global renaissance against it all and there'll be nationalist groups coming out and I'm thinking, okay, this guy, maybe he's bad because I'm like, he's telling us what we want to hear on the show.
[2:24:56.360 --> 2:25:07.360]  I'm like, oh yeah, right. It's all going to go so wonderful. And then now here we are 15 years ago and it's going exactly that way. How the hell did you know all that?
[2:25:07.360 --> 2:25:20.360]  Alex, let me tell you one thing I did know for sure and you're not going to like this. I knew that the Alex Jones show had more power and influence 20 years ago than the New York Times has today.
[2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:33.360]  That's what I was betting on to get the other analysis. What I heard and what I knew about you, I said, this is the man I want to work with. I've never been on other shows. I don't want to be on another show.
[2:25:33.360 --> 2:25:52.360]  So what does it mean? This is not about flattery. This means that someone like you in Austin, Texas, on your own, you're not getting subsidized by big corporations, built a business and then at the same time, begin to say to somebody else who was a black swan,
[2:25:52.360 --> 2:26:04.360]  you and I are black swan. A black swan being the individual who doesn't fit the mode. Yeah, I was working at MIT and Harvard and all that, but I was a black swan. I didn't belong there.
[2:26:04.360 --> 2:26:24.360]  Yeah, I was working in intelligence and a deputy assistant secretary, but I really didn't belong there and kind of intelligence community, including defense intelligence analysis, understood what I was about in the same way that your community of millions and somebody like me understands what you're about.
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:46.360]  It's not about self aggrandizement. It's not about, I enjoy going to a restaurant because what you're really doing in those cases, it sounds absurd and it looks ridiculous, but it's not because you're testing the limits within which our republic will tolerate this type of disturbance.
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:27:01.360]  The real issue here hasn't been whether I'm right or wrong or you're right and wrong. It's that we created or you created. I bet on America. You're saying we all bet on America. We bet on America. They've been on globalism.
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:17.360]  There has to be something more specific. So how did I know? I do it the same way I look at the black swan phenomenon. In other words, America is not about conformity. If you want socialism, you want the Bidens, you want Malta Harris, that's socialism.
[2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:31.360]  They're all the same. They're going to get paid off. They do nothing. America is about one simple concept, the ability to fail, not the ability to succeed, the ability to fail. You did it. I did it.
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:50.360]  Yeah, I was a doctor and I'm a psychiatrist. I was on council. I left the council on foreign relations. I didn't think much of the American Psychiatric Association. I attacked some of the presidents being corrupt. And so that ability to say what you want and at the same time to continue no matter what happened.
[2:27:50.360 --> 2:28:14.360]  You don't like my books? Fine. Don't buy them. You don't like Clancy? Fine. Don't buy it. I make no apologies. But part of the reason why we go ahead and why Americans go ahead is we've had our wars. They were enough. We didn't need to go to wars. The bushes, the chains, those who were the chicken hawks sent us to wars that they didn't want to attend.
[2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:25.360]  The Bidens had six wars that he was creating. No, I totally agree. When Trump came out, Trump came out and said his big accomplishment is trying to dial back these wars. There's no way you can deny that.
[2:28:25.360 --> 2:28:39.360]  So let's talk about the campaign. Let's talk about Trump. When and if he wins, and I agree he's about to have a landslide, I believe we'll block their attempt to break the country up. I agree with your analysis. We need to then make sure, though, he doesn't make the same mistakes again.
[2:28:39.360 --> 2:28:42.360]  He needs to go on the offense. What does Trump need to do?
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:59.360]  He needs to clean out his White House. I would take the gentleman Grinnell, who has been very effective at the DNI, a director of national intelligence, to bring in some of his supporters and clean out the White House and then clean out and fire Fauci.
[2:28:59.360 --> 2:29:12.360]  The reason I want Fauci fired is to show the world that you can't have a self-aggrandizing NIH bureaucrat. He's not a scientist. He and I went to medical school. We're not scientists.
[2:29:12.360 --> 2:29:28.360]  The real scientist like Dr. Lee Merritt, who gave a lecture to intelligence community, said that masks do not work. So he has to fire Fauci. He has to begin to take down all the federal bureaucracies that we don't need.
[2:29:28.360 --> 2:29:45.360]  The CIA, we've got 16 intelligence units. We've got to cut them by 50%. I've got 2.2 million soldiers. Right now, believe it or not, the Air Force, our Air Force today bought a dozen drones from China.
[2:29:45.360 --> 2:30:05.360]  From China. Now, how does that happen? That today we have a dozen drones from China. That is inexcusable. That's just not tolerated. Third, I want to make sure that the White House is slimmed down from how many hundreds of people down to a minimal number that he needs.
[2:30:05.360 --> 2:30:25.360]  In turn, he has to go out and make sure that every institution, the IRS, totally dysfunctional. Here I pay my taxes. I'm waiting months, other people are waiting months for their rebates. You can't have it. They don't know what they're doing. They don't know what the refunds are about.
[2:30:25.360 --> 2:30:41.360]  Number two, get rid of the CIA, get rid of a whole bunch of these intelligence, and then get rid of the most dysfunctional of all systems, the FBI, highly politicized, highly dysfunctional. I have no idea what to do.
[2:30:41.360 --> 2:30:49.360]  Instead, you bring in the US Marshals. You bring in other active officers within the security system and you notice where they are.
[2:30:49.360 --> 2:30:59.360]  Well, Trump is now, as you said, talking about firing Barr and Ray, who would he replace them with? Is there any way to fix these institutions or you just abolish them?
[2:30:59.360 --> 2:31:15.360]  Well, the one person I would bring in is somebody, I'll tell you a little story. 1988, I was recruited by a firm called Drexel Burnham, and they had on the cover of Time Magazine a guy by the name of Mike Milk, making 600 million.
[2:31:15.360 --> 2:31:30.360]  And the head of Drexel Burnham calls me up and I explained to him, there's no way I can go to Drexel Burnham because you've got a guy who's making 600 million, but we have a little lawyer here in the Reagan administration and he's only making 60,000.
[2:31:30.360 --> 2:31:48.360]  He said, well, no, no, we can beat that lawyer. I said, no, you can't. His name is Giuliani. He comes from New York and he will take you down. That was 1988. So I would bring Giuliani back as attorney general, as a director of the Justice Department, let him do what he does best,
[2:31:48.360 --> 2:31:52.360]  clean house, implement laws that he can enforce.
[2:31:52.360 --> 2:31:56.360]  By the way, it's funny, I heard Trump's actually looking at Giuliani to replace Barr.
[2:31:56.360 --> 2:32:12.360]  He has to. Giuliani, as long as I've known about him, he's an incredibly effective person. I don't care what Barrock does or such a comment. He's not relevant to our society. He's a joke. He's an Israeli joke.
[2:32:12.360 --> 2:32:18.360]  Well, we know the deep state's scared of Giuliani. Why is that?
[2:32:18.360 --> 2:32:28.360]  Well, because the deep state isn't, they're no longer, within that deep state, there are those of us who can really neutralize whoever else.
[2:32:28.360 --> 2:32:32.360]  Because there's a super deep state under them, isn't there, of loyal Americans?
[2:32:32.360 --> 2:32:46.360]  Well, that's correct. Let me, I can't go into the names or other than that, but you want to call it a super deep state. Yeah. There are those of us who've been in the interstices of the Republic for 40 years.
[2:32:46.360 --> 2:32:56.360]  We don't want the money. We don't want recognition. I don't want strikes. I didn't want to be promoted or re-adminable or that. And there are others like myself.
[2:32:56.360 --> 2:33:08.360]  There are men and women who work in the different groups in intelligence. We help to maintain that Republic so that we can tolerate the extreme left, socialism, whatever you want to call it.
[2:33:08.360 --> 2:33:20.360]  It's not, it's ironic because even the fascism of the left is coming out to be fascism because you're listening to a nonsensical story about coronavirus. Really?
[2:33:20.360 --> 2:33:32.360]  You're telling me that a little virus forces you to wear a mask that's not useful. And Dr. Lee Merritt, who was hired by the intelligence community, gives you an entire lecture.
[2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:43.360]  I have videos at Bandot Video briefing on how the mask are bad. I'm glad you brought that up. I have a big stack on that very subject. Let's talk about that with Dr. Steve Pacinac, the mask, the COVID weapon.
[2:33:43.360 --> 2:33:57.360]  You're only here on air facing the globalist onsite, the DMC funded lawsuits and everything that's happening because of you. We built the only truly multimedia independent radio TV print film organization in the world that promotes the truth against the globalist.
[2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:05.360]  We've had a devastating effect. We're a national treasure. You're a national treasure for supporting us. And so go get a t-shirt. Go get a historic t-shirt.
[2:34:05.360 --> 2:34:13.360]  We've got a funny one that's the Biden groping a woman. It's a woman's design shirt. My wife really likes it. She sent me this gift. It's pretty cute. Here it is.
[2:34:13.360 --> 2:34:35.360]  You know, it's a little historic thing. I think Trump's gonna win, but if Biden's able to steal it, we'll be probably shut down pretty quick. So it'll be historic thing to have. You'll only be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti, with handbills you hand out, and with non-compliance, not paying taxes, and pulling your kids out of the schools, and just making it a full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal foreign takeover of America.
[2:34:35.360 --> 2:34:43.360]  We've gotten to that point. Biden's for nursing home. I hope to retire Biden. That'd be a collector's item. Get it while you still can. We're not ordering more. infowarstore.com
[2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:58.360]  Infowars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government corruption for over two decades. It is why they attack us. And it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.

[2:35:44.360 --> 2:35:57.360]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show? And it's the fact that Infowars, more than 25 years ago, doing basic research with what the Club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying,
[2:35:57.360 --> 2:36:07.360]  developed the hypothesis that the Communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[2:36:07.360 --> 2:36:16.360]  Well, now China owns the debt, now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals. It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[2:36:16.360 --> 2:36:26.360]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus on that issue. We did. And you focused on it by supporting us at Infowars.
[2:36:26.360 --> 2:36:33.360]  So when you go to infowarsstore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it,
[2:36:33.360 --> 2:36:39.360]  you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world what's really happening. So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:37:07.360]  I want to thank you for your support.
[2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:12.360]  When it all started eight, nine months ago, I told you, it's never going to end. They're never going to turn loose this power.
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:18.360]  They're going to make you have internal passports on your phones to leave your house, to have a job, to travel.
[2:37:18.360 --> 2:37:23.360]  They're going to add more and more restrictions on how you get that travel pass.
[2:37:23.360 --> 2:37:37.360]  Remember the Running Man, Schwarzenegger movie, the mid-80s, written by Stephen King about a future police state? Watch that movie and compare it to today. We are in the absolute brand, the absolute mold,
[2:37:37.360 --> 2:37:54.360]  of a classic authoritarian, dystopic nightmare. We've got to reject this now before it's submitted.
[2:37:54.360 --> 2:38:11.360]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, we're now 18 hours out from the kickoff of the greatest election in world history.
[2:38:11.360 --> 2:38:17.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:38:17.360 --> 2:38:25.360]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:38:25.360 --> 2:38:30.360]  And Jesse James of the NRA and more will be in studio tonight with myself and Owen Shroyer, 7 to 9 p.m.
[2:38:30.360 --> 2:38:37.360]  And then at 8 a.m., David Knight, myself kick it all off. It's going to be 24 hours, 48 hours, whatever we have to.
[2:38:37.360 --> 2:38:40.360]  We're going to be here when they can test it and pull all this crap.
[2:38:40.360 --> 2:38:51.360]  We're going to be here when they can really spread the word because they are fighting big tech around the clock to keep these live feeds and these guests and Dr. Puchenek and others for being on air and all your calls and all your intel.
[2:38:51.360 --> 2:38:55.360]  But here's what Dr. Puchenek was starting to get into. Here's InfoWars.com.
[2:38:55.360 --> 2:38:59.360]  UK government justifies second national lockdown using outdated death scenarios.
[2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:04.360]  They'd be four times too high. Well, it's way more than four times too high.
[2:39:04.360 --> 2:39:13.360]  And it turns out, if you look it up, that Fauci authored a 2008 report that's also been republished in a new medical journal.
[2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:22.360]  The predominant role of bacterial pneumonia as a cause of death and pandemic influenza, they found the mask in the 1918 Spanish flu in 1919.
[2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:29.360]  We're causing the incubation of this and the damage in the lungs from the virus allowed the bacteria to kill folks all they needed with antibiotics.
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:32.360]  They didn't have antibiotics then yet.
[2:39:32.360 --> 2:39:36.360]  They were real killers in 1918 flu pandemic. NewScientist.com.
[2:39:36.360 --> 2:39:41.360]  So my point is, this is exactly what Dr. Puchenek was saying six months ago.
[2:39:41.360 --> 2:39:50.360]  And Fauci even has authored papers saying all this, which shows real, to me, medical fraud, professional fraud.
[2:39:50.360 --> 2:39:55.360]  And then I have all these graphs around the world as soon as mask wearing starts, deaths go up.
[2:39:55.360 --> 2:40:02.360]  So again, I'm not a scientist, but I can see which way the wind blows.
[2:40:02.360 --> 2:40:05.360]  Dr. Puchenek, you were getting into the mask, the fraud, the evidence.
[2:40:05.360 --> 2:40:12.360]  This psychology is a psychiatrist. What is this wearing the mask? It's like Sharia law, the six feet of distance.
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:19.360]  It's obviously all psychological. What's the end game of this and how good is it that Trump is calling it out finally?
[2:40:19.360 --> 2:40:27.360]  I was waiting for Trump to call it out, you know, six months ago when I first said, well, I received the coronavirus in January.
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:37.360]  I treated it with Zithromax, other physicians on the line, practicing physicians, not somebody like Fauci who's been at NIH for 30, 40 years,
[2:40:37.360 --> 2:40:43.360]  makes 400,000 a year, but is not a scientist, not really a practicing physician.
[2:40:43.360 --> 2:40:51.360]  We all knew you could treat it exactly by what you said, Zithromax and antibiotic, and then we could go on with our lives.
[2:40:51.360 --> 2:40:58.360]  Instead, what happened was the rise of the kind of fascist statement and a fascist notion.
[2:40:58.360 --> 2:41:02.360]  This came from the left. This was something that was really quite unusual.
[2:41:02.360 --> 2:41:07.360]  If I had to write it as a novel, I would have been thrown out of my publishing company.
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:18.360]  The reality that we could shut down a whole country because of a make-believe entity which is supposed to kill you or kill older people,
[2:41:18.360 --> 2:41:23.360]  well, that turns out that's not exactly correct, kill young kids, well, that's not exactly correct.
[2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:29.360]  Now they're coming out with a nonsense that it kills males at the middle age. That's nonsense.
[2:41:29.360 --> 2:41:37.360]  And we have the flu, but yet on the other hand, we don't talk about some kind of numbers that are being made up.
[2:41:37.360 --> 2:41:47.360]  240,000 people dead and millions were infected, but we got close to, I think, 10 million, 15 million alcoholics.
[2:41:47.360 --> 2:41:52.360]  I have millions of car accidents. I have millions of drug addicts.
[2:41:52.360 --> 2:41:58.360]  I have millions and millions of suicidal patients right now. We don't talk about that.
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:07.360]  What happened is, unfortunately, Trump took the advice of Fauci and the rest of CDC, which I would fire, including Redfield, Bricks,
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:12.360]  and a whole group of them, to say, look, this is incompetence on the major level.
[2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:17.360]  Number one, we do not have an epidemic of coronavirus or whatever you want to call it.
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:20.360]  Number two, a mass does nothing more.
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:27.360]  And every construction worker who has to deal with dust or can tell you the same thing I'm saying to you,
[2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:35.360]  unless it's an N95 or highly specialized mass, most of the time that mass does nothing to breed more bacteria
[2:42:35.360 --> 2:42:39.360]  and more problems for the person wearing the mask.
[2:42:39.360 --> 2:42:44.360]  So what it became was the shibboleth for the left-wing fascism, I call it.
[2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:46.360]  They said that the right-wing was fascist.
[2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:51.360]  No, fascism comes out from the left-wing, as it did with Benito Mussolini.
[2:42:51.360 --> 2:43:01.360]  It was national socialist under Hitler. It was social, entities of social justice so-called under the Soviets.
[2:43:01.360 --> 2:43:05.360]  It was always coming out of the left, and that's what you were seeing in the left.
[2:43:05.360 --> 2:43:14.360]  In order to facilitate that big tech, which we in the United States created through a company called INQTEL,
[2:43:14.360 --> 2:43:26.360]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, all received monies, all the fang received money from INQTEL in 1998-99 after that,
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:35.360]  because I was part of a group of angel investors that worked in Virginia, Alexandria,
[2:43:35.360 --> 2:43:42.360]  and we helped the CIA to set up an INQTEL business where they invested in turn into big tech.
[2:43:42.360 --> 2:43:46.360]  So when Trump comes in, he's got to break up big tech.
[2:43:46.360 --> 2:43:50.360]  He's got to break up Google. He's got to break up Facebook.
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:52.360]  He's going to have to break up Twitter.
[2:43:52.360 --> 2:43:58.360]  Really, Dorsey, who's absolutely obnoxious and repugnant to our country,
[2:43:58.360 --> 2:44:03.360]  and really has no idea of what he's doing and how much damage he's done.
[2:44:03.360 --> 2:44:06.360]  I totally agree with you. So let's back up from here.
[2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:15.360]  They admit in these studies that masks actually cause bacterial pneumonia and don't protect your viruses.
[2:44:15.360 --> 2:44:19.360]  This is criminal, but they just keep pushing it.
[2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:21.360]  So finally, Trump's not just eating around the edges.
[2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:25.360]  He's frontally assaulting, and I know Trump people watch the show, Dr. Pachennick.
[2:44:25.360 --> 2:44:26.360]  I know they listen to what you have to say.
[2:44:26.360 --> 2:44:30.360]  If you were Trump, I'd fire him tomorrow on election day.
[2:44:30.360 --> 2:44:33.360]  I would repudiate them all now. I wouldn't wait.
[2:44:33.360 --> 2:44:38.360]  Well, he's asked everybody to wait. He said he's a nice guy and all that.
[2:44:38.360 --> 2:44:45.360]  Well, Tony Fauci had been a nice guy, but he came such a self-aggrandizer and such a BS artist.
[2:44:45.360 --> 2:44:50.360]  I couldn't believe it, but the reality is something that I've had to say repeatedly.
[2:44:50.360 --> 2:44:53.360]  People have to go to jail.
[2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:59.360]  You cannot allow this kind of subversion, this kind of distortion, this kind of lies,
[2:44:59.360 --> 2:45:03.360]  this kind of incompetency to be the model for the future.
[2:45:03.360 --> 2:45:07.360]  And this is where Trump has to crack down on the individual.
[2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:14.360]  People go to jail if you want to indict Fauci for treason, which he's part of the public health service.
[2:45:14.360 --> 2:45:16.360]  Oh, he basically ran the Wuhan lab.
[2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:21.360]  What's crazy is the guy that's behind all this is running the response to it.
[2:45:21.360 --> 2:45:28.360]  Correct, but the answer is he's not held accountable so he can hold a patent for one thing or another.
[2:45:28.360 --> 2:45:32.360]  You've got all kinds of people involved in this, Soros and others,
[2:45:32.360 --> 2:45:39.360]  but unless you hold them accountable, including operatives from the agencies, nothing is going to happen.
[2:45:39.360 --> 2:45:41.360]  That's my next question. You're right.
[2:45:41.360 --> 2:45:46.360]  Let's start the show with this. They don't get in trouble for barisma, China, mismanagement.
[2:45:46.360 --> 2:45:50.360]  Like, I believe in nuclear power, except the companies are so corrupt, they don't run them right.
[2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:54.360]  It's like they all are just incompetent. None of them even care.
[2:45:54.360 --> 2:45:58.360]  It's like they get powerful and just wander off of no care anymore.
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:00.360]  Because they're not held accountable.
[2:46:00.360 --> 2:46:05.360]  Once you become too large, you have no sense of what you are, number one.
[2:46:05.360 --> 2:46:08.360]  Number two, I mean, look at Alphabet.
[2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:16.360]  It went from a couple of hundred bucks to a $3,000 stock and now pulled back about 1,000 points.
[2:46:16.360 --> 2:46:19.360]  And what's going to happen is repeated again.
[2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:26.360]  The stock market in America is a good reflection of what we talked about in terms of American entrepreneurism
[2:46:26.360 --> 2:46:30.360]  and the ability for Trump to come back and increase the GDP.
[2:46:30.360 --> 2:46:36.360]  If Biden comes in, I will guarantee America and I will guarantee those of you at the pension,
[2:46:36.360 --> 2:46:41.360]  we will go into a severe depression no matter what your broker is telling you.
[2:46:41.360 --> 2:46:50.360]  Trump has to come back in because the markets will screech back with the hope that we can come back and increase our GDP.
[2:46:50.360 --> 2:46:51.360]  And he will do that.
[2:46:51.360 --> 2:46:54.360]  But people have to be held accountable.
[2:46:54.360 --> 2:46:56.360]  Bill Gates will have to be held accountable.
[2:46:56.360 --> 2:46:58.360]  Fauci has to be held accountable.
[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:00.360]  Dorsey has to be held accountable.
[2:47:00.360 --> 2:47:06.360]  Zuckerberg, Comey, Ray, Biden, there's a whole group of them, but they're never held accountable.
[2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:12.360]  And instead they go on CNN or whatever you want, Zucker's disaster there.
[2:47:12.360 --> 2:47:16.360]  And basically they can get away for doing nothing.
[2:47:16.360 --> 2:47:22.360]  Yet unfortunately minority groups, Hispanics and Black, for less than that, we go to prison.
[2:47:22.360 --> 2:47:30.360]  I've had the FBI knock on my door because I said comments about Obama being an operative and never having told the truth.
[2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:33.360]  I get two FBI agents knocking on my door for that.
[2:47:33.360 --> 2:47:36.360]  The answer is that's not acceptable.
[2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:38.360]  Obama has been a mentoring candidate.
[2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:40.360]  He's been a pathological liar.
[2:47:40.360 --> 2:47:41.360]  That's the good news.
[2:47:41.360 --> 2:47:43.360]  I don't need to be a psychiatrist to see this.
[2:47:43.360 --> 2:47:44.360]  He used to be arrogant.
[2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:47.360]  He looks really deflated and freaked out now.
[2:47:47.360 --> 2:47:51.360]  Well, you know, a man like that shouldn't have any prominence at all.
[2:47:51.360 --> 2:47:55.360]  There isn't one word of truth in anything he says.
[2:47:55.360 --> 2:47:57.360]  You know, his mother was an operative.
[2:47:57.360 --> 2:48:02.360]  His maternal parents, grandparents were operatives working at the East West Center.
[2:48:02.360 --> 2:48:03.360]  He's a liar.
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:05.360]  He's a pathological liar.
[2:48:05.360 --> 2:48:09.360]  And so, you know, the people around them, but they're not held accountable.
[2:48:09.360 --> 2:48:14.360]  So this is where Alex Jones has to come back and hit again and again and again.
[2:48:14.360 --> 2:48:18.360]  If Steve Pachennick has to come out to repeat it, I'll do it.
[2:48:18.360 --> 2:48:20.360]  StevePachennick, StevePachennick.com.
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:23.360]  Join us again during the 24-48 hour.
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:25.360]  We're going to keep going live as long as it's contested.
[2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:29.360]  I think it's going to be contested for a while, but I think it will get shut down quickly, as you said.
[2:48:29.360 --> 2:48:30.360]  Thank you so much.
[2:48:30.360 --> 2:48:32.360]  Stay with us.
[2:48:32.360 --> 2:48:34.360]  Look it up for yourself.
[2:48:34.360 --> 2:48:43.360]  The head of the Davos Group issued a report more than six months ago calling for world government to be openly established to respond to COVID-19.
[2:48:43.360 --> 2:48:48.360]  The COVID-19 was a blessing to lower the planet's carbon footprint.
[2:48:48.360 --> 2:48:53.360]  Since then, Prince Charles and countless others have come out and said the exact same thing.
[2:48:53.360 --> 2:48:58.360]  The most ancient form of total war is called siege.
[2:48:58.360 --> 2:49:02.360]  And that's when you cut people off from their resources.
[2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:04.360]  That's when you lock them down.
[2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:08.360]  And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalists or just get rid of Donald Trump.
[2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:09.360]  That's only part of it.
[2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:13.360]  This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt.
[2:49:13.360 --> 2:49:21.360]  So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social credit score surveillance grip.
[2:49:21.360 --> 2:49:25.360]  So you've heard the U.S. Army saying our job is to kill people and break things.
[2:49:25.360 --> 2:49:27.360]  Well, that's what the lockdown's doing.
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:31.360]  Starving the third world, millions and millions of debt is breaking down the supply chain in society.
[2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:34.360]  It's their mission.
[2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:36.360]  It's all on record.
[2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:48.360]  Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago and then again six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic
[2:49:48.360 --> 2:49:51.360]  and how to get the public to take inoculations.
[2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:53.360]  And they talk about calling people heroes that do it.
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:55.360]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:49:59.360]  This has all been psychologically tested.
[2:49:59.360 --> 2:50:01.360]  It's all been psychologically prepared.
[2:50:01.360 --> 2:50:05.360]  And once they get it locked down for 15 days, you notice now they say it's permanent.
[2:50:05.360 --> 2:50:06.360]  That's how it works.
[2:50:06.360 --> 2:50:08.360]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:12.360]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right.
[2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:13.360]  No.
[2:50:13.360 --> 2:50:17.360]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van.
[2:50:17.360 --> 2:50:22.360]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death.
[2:50:22.360 --> 2:50:23.360]  That's the allegory.
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:25.360]  We've got to bust out of this thing now.
[2:50:25.360 --> 2:50:26.360]  We've got to say no now.
[2:50:26.360 --> 2:50:28.360]  We've got to make a run for it now and we still can't.
[2:50:28.360 --> 2:50:32.360]  Once he gets us in that basement, it's going to get a lot, lot worse, folks.
[2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:34.360]  So stop submitting.
[2:50:36.360 --> 2:50:40.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:43.360 --> 2:50:45.360]  Big John.
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:47.360]  Big John.
[2:50:47.360 --> 2:50:49.360]  Every morning.
[2:50:49.360 --> 2:50:53.360]  Every morning at the mine, you can see him arrive.
[2:50:53.360 --> 2:50:57.360]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245 kind of broad at his shoulder and narrowed the hip.
[2:50:57.360 --> 2:50:59.360]  And everybody knew you didn't give him the word.
[2:50:59.360 --> 2:51:03.360]  I would say the globalization is inevitable unless someone really moves in to stop it.
[2:51:06.360 --> 2:51:11.360]  We have all agreed to pursue the sustainable development goals to 2030.
[2:51:11.360 --> 2:51:16.360]  The fourth industrial revolution, particularly digital technology,
[2:51:16.360 --> 2:51:20.360]  has fundamentally changed the global economic landscape.
[2:51:20.360 --> 2:51:25.360]  Globalization is an inevitable and irreversible trend.
[2:51:33.360 --> 2:51:37.360]  We should not avoid the challenges brought by the economic globalization.
[2:51:37.360 --> 2:51:43.360]  Instead, we should look directly at the gap of wealth and of development.
[2:51:43.360 --> 2:51:50.360]  Well, the foundation can't achieve ambitious goals in global health
[2:51:50.360 --> 2:51:57.360]  without deep partnerships with the rich countries that provide most of the aid.
[2:51:57.360 --> 2:52:02.360]  Everything that is broken today can be fixed
[2:52:02.360 --> 2:52:10.360]  and every failure can be turned into a truly great success.
[2:52:10.360 --> 2:52:14.360]  We must replace the present policy of globalism,
[2:52:14.360 --> 2:52:19.360]  which has just taken so many jobs out of our communities
[2:52:19.360 --> 2:52:22.360]  and so much wealth out of our country,
[2:52:22.360 --> 2:52:28.360]  and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.
[2:52:32.360 --> 2:52:34.360]  America first.
[2:52:34.360 --> 2:52:36.360]  Remember that.
[2:52:36.360 --> 2:52:40.360]  Now the world is awakening to globalism,
[2:52:40.360 --> 2:52:46.360]  and the forces of globalism are striking back in incredibly vicious ways.
[2:52:54.360 --> 2:53:00.360]  And then there's the 79 days of hell that I've been talking about
[2:53:00.360 --> 2:53:02.360]  that start the day of the election.
[2:53:02.360 --> 2:53:06.360]  Democrats have openly said, first in internal statements,
[2:53:06.360 --> 2:53:08.360]  then in white papers, then in war-gamed operations,
[2:53:08.360 --> 2:53:10.360]  then in Democrat think-tank statements,
[2:53:10.360 --> 2:53:12.360]  then in the New York Times three months ago,
[2:53:12.360 --> 2:53:14.360]  that they are going to contest,
[2:53:14.360 --> 2:53:16.360]  they know Trump's going to win,
[2:53:16.360 --> 2:53:19.360]  and that they're going to have western states split off,
[2:53:19.360 --> 2:53:21.360]  tank the dollar in the stock market,
[2:53:21.360 --> 2:53:23.360]  have race riots nationwide as the cover,
[2:53:23.360 --> 2:53:26.360]  and try to drive President Trump from office.
[2:53:26.360 --> 2:53:30.360]  The big corporations, the banks, Hollywood,
[2:53:30.360 --> 2:53:32.360]  the chai comms, the Democrats,
[2:53:32.360 --> 2:53:36.360]  all of these systems along with radical Islam
[2:53:36.360 --> 2:53:41.360]  and Communist China are allied against us right now.
[2:53:41.360 --> 2:53:44.360]  We told you when they were in the secret phases that this was happening,
[2:53:44.360 --> 2:53:46.360]  but now they've prepared themselves,
[2:53:46.360 --> 2:53:48.360]  they've prepared the public.
[2:53:48.360 --> 2:53:50.360]  That's why they flooded us with the 80 million ballots.
[2:53:50.360 --> 2:53:52.360]  A lot of people got three or four ballots,
[2:53:52.360 --> 2:53:54.360]  dead cats, dead dogs, dead people got them,
[2:53:54.360 --> 2:53:58.360]  so that even if Trump is winning by three, four points in battleground states
[2:53:58.360 --> 2:54:00.360]  and statistically has a majority,
[2:54:00.360 --> 2:54:03.360]  and you can see that there's a bunch of votes that haven't been cast,
[2:54:03.360 --> 2:54:05.360]  but still he'd win if all of those went Democrat,
[2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:08.360]  they're going to say, we don't care, they're all going to be counted.
[2:54:08.360 --> 2:54:10.360]  And they put out so many millions of fake ones
[2:54:10.360 --> 2:54:12.360]  that he may never be able to get to that number
[2:54:12.360 --> 2:54:15.360]  because they'll never be able to count enough of the ballots
[2:54:15.360 --> 2:54:17.360]  to give him that clear victory.
[2:54:17.360 --> 2:54:19.360]  But the easiest thing for him to do
[2:54:19.360 --> 2:54:21.360]  is to stand up like a man
[2:54:21.360 --> 2:54:25.360]  and accept the results of an election of the American people.
[2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:31.360]  For him to make these kinds of statements shows his lack of patriotism.
[2:54:31.360 --> 2:54:36.360]  I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday,
[2:54:36.360 --> 2:54:40.360]  whatever the end count is,
[2:54:40.360 --> 2:54:43.360]  but on the election that occurs on Tuesday,
[2:54:43.360 --> 2:54:45.360]  he will be elected on January 20th,
[2:54:45.360 --> 2:54:49.360]  he will be inaugurated president of the United States.
[2:54:49.360 --> 2:54:51.360]  Now notice, that's not a slip,
[2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:53.360]  that's what she's been saying for months,
[2:54:53.360 --> 2:54:55.360]  that it doesn't matter what the election says,
[2:54:55.360 --> 2:54:57.360]  we're not going to accept it,
[2:54:57.360 --> 2:54:59.360]  and then we're going to have states secede,
[2:54:59.360 --> 2:55:03.360]  and then we will seat him geographically
[2:55:03.360 --> 2:55:05.360]  from another location,
[2:55:05.360 --> 2:55:07.360]  and that geography doesn't matter,
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:09.360]  the White House doesn't matter,
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:11.360]  it matters who they say the president is.
[2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:16.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:21.360]  the fabled Leanne McEvoy is in studio.
[2:55:21.360 --> 2:55:24.360]  And she's survived so much to say how that went.
[2:55:24.360 --> 2:55:26.360]  When we come back,
[2:55:26.360 --> 2:55:28.360]  and we're going to be live from 9 o'clock tonight,
[2:55:28.360 --> 2:55:31.360]  the tomorrow 24 hour coverage starts with Leanne McAdoo,
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:34.360]  at electionnight.news,
[2:55:34.360 --> 2:55:37.360]  electionnight.news, electionnight.news,
[2:55:37.360 --> 2:55:39.360]  Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos,
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:42.360]  hope you don't share that link, electionnight.news.
[2:55:42.360 --> 2:55:46.360]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed,
[2:55:46.360 --> 2:55:48.360]  and why is that?
[2:55:48.360 --> 2:55:51.360]  The tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush
[2:55:51.360 --> 2:55:55.360]  grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[2:55:55.360 --> 2:55:58.360]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world
[2:55:58.360 --> 2:56:00.360]  to have amazing health effects.
[2:56:00.360 --> 2:56:01.360]  They didn't know why.
[2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:03.360]  Well, with modern science, we know,
[2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:07.360]  it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of selenium.
[2:56:07.360 --> 2:56:10.360]  We have bio-true selenium sold out for months
[2:56:10.360 --> 2:56:14.360]  back in stock at infowarsstore.com,
[2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:17.360]  at 50% off, store-wide free shipping,
[2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:19.360]  and triple-patriot points.
[2:56:19.360 --> 2:56:23.360]  Bio-true selenium at infowarsstore.com
[2:56:23.360 --> 2:56:25.360]  is an amazing product,
[2:56:25.360 --> 2:56:28.360]  and it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[2:56:28.360 --> 2:56:31.360]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[2:56:31.360 --> 2:56:33.360]  It is an essential nutrient in the body
[2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:35.360]  that you actually have to have.
[2:56:35.360 --> 2:56:38.360]  It's back in stock, 50% off, triple-patriot points
[2:56:38.360 --> 2:56:48.360]  at infowarsstore.com and with free shipping.
[2:57:08.360 --> 2:57:10.360]  I just called her a few days ago,
[2:57:10.360 --> 2:57:12.360]  and I said, we've got to get the old team back together.
[2:57:12.360 --> 2:57:14.360]  She wouldn't take care of her mom and grandma
[2:57:14.360 --> 2:57:16.360]  and family a few years ago if we get it.
[2:57:16.360 --> 2:57:17.360]  Never came back.
[2:57:17.360 --> 2:57:19.360]  I'm happy to do the same thing.
[2:57:19.360 --> 2:57:21.360]  But she flew in from Florida.
[2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:23.360]  We appreciate her being here for the next two days
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:24.360]  during the election.
[2:57:24.360 --> 2:57:26.360]  She's going to be with us tomorrow
[2:57:26.360 --> 2:57:27.360]  on the big 24-hour broadcast.
[2:57:27.360 --> 2:57:29.360]  Lee Ann only got one segment with you here.
[2:57:29.360 --> 2:57:31.360]  We'll be back on the War Room later,
[2:57:31.360 --> 2:57:34.360]  back with Jesse James and myself tonight, 7 to 9.
[2:57:34.360 --> 2:57:36.360]  But you've got the floor.
[2:57:36.360 --> 2:57:38.360]  Your view on the world, what you've been through,
[2:57:38.360 --> 2:57:40.360]  what you think is going to happen with Trump.
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:41.360]  Lee Ann, great to have you.
[2:57:41.360 --> 2:57:43.360]  Well, I mean, I guess it really depends on where you're at.
[2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:45.360]  The atmosphere is a little bit different.
[2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:48.360]  In Florida, where I'm at, it is clearly Trump all the way.
[2:57:48.360 --> 2:57:50.360]  I could not even tell you,
[2:57:50.360 --> 2:57:53.360]  before they started really showing you all the boat parades,
[2:57:53.360 --> 2:57:55.360]  I was seeing that going,
[2:57:55.360 --> 2:57:57.360]  wow, like nobody put signs out in their yard.
[2:57:57.360 --> 2:58:00.360]  They're just all over the waterway.
[2:58:00.360 --> 2:58:03.360]  And so you're just seeing these massive parades.
[2:58:03.360 --> 2:58:05.360]  And then, of course, now they're doing the Trump parades
[2:58:05.360 --> 2:58:06.360]  with the cars.
[2:58:06.360 --> 2:58:09.360]  And you don't have to worry about having a Trump sticker on your car.
[2:58:09.360 --> 2:58:11.360]  No one's going to break your car windows out
[2:58:11.360 --> 2:58:13.360]  or set your house on fire.
[2:58:13.360 --> 2:58:14.360]  It's just a safe place.
[2:58:14.360 --> 2:58:17.360]  So it's kind of interesting coming back to Austin, Texas,
[2:58:17.360 --> 2:58:21.360]  where my Uber driver was telling me how he was really meekly
[2:58:21.360 --> 2:58:24.360]  kind of letting me know that he was for Trump
[2:58:24.360 --> 2:58:26.360]  and that he and his wife were so afraid they wouldn't put
[2:58:26.360 --> 2:58:29.360]  signs out in the yard because they didn't want the neighbors
[2:58:29.360 --> 2:58:30.360]  to get upset.
[2:58:30.360 --> 2:58:32.360]  And it's just incredible.
[2:58:32.360 --> 2:58:35.360]  Even Joe Rogan's like, you know, I support Trump now, is that OK?
[2:58:35.360 --> 2:58:36.360]  Everyone's so scared.
[2:58:36.360 --> 2:58:37.360]  Yeah, they're so afraid.
[2:58:37.360 --> 2:58:38.360]  You're the biggest podcast in the world.
[2:58:38.360 --> 2:58:39.360]  They'd be proud of what you stand for.
[2:58:39.360 --> 2:58:40.360]  Right.
[2:58:40.360 --> 2:58:41.360]  I mean, what are they going to do?
[2:58:41.360 --> 2:58:42.360]  Silence you?
[2:58:42.360 --> 2:58:44.360]  And if they do, then what?
[2:58:44.360 --> 2:58:46.360]  I mean, what is it going to take?
[2:58:46.360 --> 2:58:48.360]  When are people going to actually see that this is a slippery slope?
[2:58:48.360 --> 2:58:51.360]  But if he had an electoral landslide last time,
[2:58:51.360 --> 2:58:53.360]  not a popular vote last time,
[2:58:53.360 --> 2:58:55.360]  this seems much bigger this time,
[2:58:55.360 --> 2:58:56.360]  unless there's total fraud.
[2:58:56.360 --> 2:58:57.360]  I don't see how he loses.
[2:58:57.360 --> 2:58:58.360]  Exactly.
[2:58:58.360 --> 2:59:00.360]  And that's really, I think that's the only way that they're going
[2:59:00.360 --> 2:59:04.360]  to be able to shut it down on election night.
[2:59:04.360 --> 2:59:06.360]  Otherwise, they're going to keep dragging this out.
[2:59:06.360 --> 2:59:09.360]  They're going to set out their little anti-fum minions to go
[2:59:09.360 --> 2:59:11.360]  and terrorize the neighborhoods.
[2:59:11.360 --> 2:59:13.360]  But I think what's different this time around than 2016,
[2:59:13.360 --> 2:59:15.360]  because in both instances,
[2:59:15.360 --> 2:59:18.360]  we didn't really know what the outcome was going to be.
[2:59:18.360 --> 2:59:22.360]  But the Democrats didn't think they needed to steal that election.
[2:59:22.360 --> 2:59:25.360]  And Hillary Clinton didn't even go around to some of the pivotal states.
[2:59:25.360 --> 2:59:26.360]  Exactly.
[2:59:26.360 --> 2:59:28.360]  We sucker punched him this time.
[2:59:28.360 --> 2:59:29.360]  They're actively trying to steal it.
[2:59:29.360 --> 2:59:34.360]  They've done so many different things to make people doubt the results
[2:59:34.360 --> 2:59:35.360]  of the election, to say,
[2:59:35.360 --> 2:59:37.360]  we got to wait for all these mail-in ballots,
[2:59:37.360 --> 2:59:39.360]  to send out fraudulent mail-in ballots,
[2:59:39.360 --> 2:59:43.360]  10, 20 copies to deceased people who no longer live there.
[2:59:43.360 --> 2:59:47.360]  I'm talking personal friends whose mothers and everybody in the nursing home
[2:59:47.360 --> 2:59:48.360]  has two or three ballots.
[2:59:48.360 --> 2:59:49.360]  Right.
[2:59:49.360 --> 2:59:50.360]  I mean, this is big.
[2:59:50.360 --> 2:59:51.360]  Yeah.
[2:59:51.360 --> 2:59:53.360]  I mean, except for when it started to see that there was a big rush
[2:59:53.360 --> 2:59:56.360]  on the mail-in ballots for President Trump,
[2:59:56.360 --> 2:59:58.360]  then they stopped really pushing that.
[2:59:58.360 --> 2:59:59.360]  Exactly.
[2:59:59.360 --> 3:00:00.360]  It's like everything they do backfires.
[3:00:00.360 --> 3:00:01.360]  Right.
[3:00:01.360 --> 3:00:02.360]  Yeah.
[3:00:02.360 --> 3:00:03.360]  They were like,
[3:00:03.360 --> 3:00:04.360]  the polls aren't looking good for us on that.
[3:00:04.360 --> 3:00:05.360]  So let's just stop.
[3:00:05.360 --> 3:00:08.360]  But another thing that people kind of bring up
[3:00:08.360 --> 3:00:10.360]  is that they really were pushing to get out the vote early.
[3:00:10.360 --> 3:00:13.360]  And I think that's because of this stuff that dropped on Hunter Biden
[3:00:13.360 --> 3:00:16.360]  and how that wasn't going to look good for Joe Biden.
[3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:19.360]  They wanted people to make, you know, cast their ballot
[3:00:19.360 --> 3:00:21.360]  before all of that stuff came out.
[3:00:21.360 --> 3:00:24.360]  So they couldn't resend their vote or change their vote.
[3:00:24.360 --> 3:00:25.360]  I totally agree.
[3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:29.360]  And now how devastating, as soon as ABC News admitted the laptop
[3:00:29.360 --> 3:00:33.360]  was real Friday, suddenly they put the New York Post back up.
[3:00:33.360 --> 3:00:34.360]  Right.
[3:00:34.360 --> 3:00:35.360]  On Twitter.
[3:00:35.360 --> 3:00:37.360]  Oh, their fact checkers got around to it.
[3:00:37.360 --> 3:00:42.360]  I mean, how can you just silence big breaking news on,
[3:00:42.360 --> 3:00:47.360]  this is a, he was a former vice president selling out our country.
[3:00:47.360 --> 3:00:49.360]  I mean, how are people so...
[3:00:49.360 --> 3:00:51.360]  Have you seen the Hunter Biden audio where he's like,
[3:00:51.360 --> 3:00:55.360]  my dad, I worked for the Chinese spy chief and he's worth all these billions.
[3:00:55.360 --> 3:00:57.360]  And now he's disappeared.
[3:00:57.360 --> 3:00:58.360]  Yeah.
[3:00:58.360 --> 3:01:00.360]  I mean, they've sold out our country.
[3:01:00.360 --> 3:01:02.360]  And we know Hillary Clinton was in on it too.
[3:01:02.360 --> 3:01:06.360]  And I think this whole COVID rollout was in the works.
[3:01:06.360 --> 3:01:08.360]  It's just they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to be the president.
[3:01:08.360 --> 3:01:09.360]  Exactly.
[3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:10.360]  They were going to pull it with Hillary.
[3:01:10.360 --> 3:01:11.360]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:01:11.360 --> 3:01:14.360]  I just love how he talks about these traders are disappearing.
[3:01:14.360 --> 3:01:16.360]  Well, I mean, this is a war.
[3:01:16.360 --> 3:01:18.360]  I love how he's scared because people are disappearing.
[3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:19.360]  Yeah.
[3:01:19.360 --> 3:01:20.360]  Right.
[3:01:20.360 --> 3:01:21.360]  Well, it's the kids.
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:22.360]  It's them.
[3:01:22.360 --> 3:01:23.360]  They're disappearing.
[3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:24.360]  Right.
[3:01:24.360 --> 3:01:27.360]  Well, and that's why, you know, if, if let's just say Trump, it is contested.
[3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:28.360]  He doesn't win.
[3:01:28.360 --> 3:01:33.360]  He'll have 60 little over 60 days to make some moves and actually follow through on draining
[3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:39.360]  the swamp or serving some justice to these people who deserve it.
[3:01:39.360 --> 3:01:40.360]  How epic is it?
[3:01:40.360 --> 3:01:42.360]  You started working here eight, nine years ago.
[3:01:42.360 --> 3:01:43.360]  Yeah.
[3:01:43.360 --> 3:01:44.360]  Yeah.
[3:01:44.360 --> 3:01:45.360]  Yeah.
[3:01:45.360 --> 3:01:46.360]  Seven, seven years.
[3:01:46.360 --> 3:01:47.360]  And you took a few, hi.
[3:01:47.360 --> 3:01:48.360]  This is, we love you.
[3:01:48.360 --> 3:01:49.360]  You're awesome.
[3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:50.360]  And here you are.
[3:01:50.360 --> 3:01:54.360]  How crazy is it to see the world of info wars has become mainstream now?
[3:01:54.360 --> 3:01:55.360]  I mean, it's like,
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:01:56.360]  Oh yeah.
[3:01:56.360 --> 3:02:02.360]  Even, even by de-platforming you and unpersoning you and sending you off down the memory hole,
[3:02:02.360 --> 3:02:04.360]  it's still, it's like, you're not, you're not going anywhere.
[3:02:04.360 --> 3:02:05.360]  Well, yeah.
[3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:07.360]  But, but the info wars is you.
[3:02:07.360 --> 3:02:08.360]  You went through a lot of hell.
[3:02:08.360 --> 3:02:09.360]  You got persecuted.
[3:02:09.360 --> 3:02:10.360]  I mean, you're just as important.
[3:02:10.360 --> 3:02:11.360]  I'm not just saying this.
[3:02:11.360 --> 3:02:13.360]  The listeners are just as important as all of us.
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:14.360]  You've been info wars.
[3:02:14.360 --> 3:02:15.360]  What does it like to be through that process?
[3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:17.360]  You went through some major persecution.
[3:02:17.360 --> 3:02:19.360]  You've been vindicated.
[3:02:19.360 --> 3:02:20.360]  Yeah.
[3:02:20.360 --> 3:02:25.360]  Well, for me, I really lost the ability to fight with people who are just so wrapped up
[3:02:25.360 --> 3:02:26.360]  in their cognitive dissonance.
[3:02:26.360 --> 3:02:30.360]  I mean, even though it's such an important time for us to be shaking these people, but
[3:02:30.360 --> 3:02:35.360]  I feel like if, if at this point you still do not get it and you're still like fighting,
[3:02:35.360 --> 3:02:36.360]  he's great.
[3:02:36.360 --> 3:02:41.360]  I know he sold us out to the communist Chinese and, and he wants to lock down our country.
[3:02:41.360 --> 3:02:42.360]  That's his big plan.
[3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:45.360]  He's running on locking down our country and mandatory masks.
[3:02:45.360 --> 3:02:46.360]  That's your plan.
[3:02:46.360 --> 3:02:49.360]  That's, I mean, he's running on martial law.
[3:02:49.360 --> 3:02:50.360]  Yeah.
[3:02:50.360 --> 3:02:52.360]  He's running on fear and a lot of older people.
[3:02:52.360 --> 3:02:56.360]  I live in a state where there's plenty of old people and there, a lot of them are living
[3:02:56.360 --> 3:03:01.360]  in total fear of this because they watch CNN and they're buying into it.
[3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:03.360]  You know, and so that's, this is elder abuse.
[3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:05.360]  It's a little, they're praying on one group.
[3:03:05.360 --> 3:03:06.360]  Right.
[3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:10.360]  And these people, they're, they're afraid and they're allowing their, their last years
[3:03:10.360 --> 3:03:14.360]  of their life to be locked down.
[3:03:14.360 --> 3:03:16.360]  You know, it's like, you want to be free.
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:18.360]  You want to be able to see your grandkids.
[3:03:18.360 --> 3:03:21.360]  You want to be able to go travel and do things, but instead you're going to allow yourself
[3:03:21.360 --> 3:03:22.360]  and notice how to scare us more.
[3:03:22.360 --> 3:03:27.360]  That was a joke photo we just showed, but Biden wears two masks and now Don Lemon on
[3:03:27.360 --> 3:03:29.360]  TV in a studio wears mask.
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:31.360]  I mean, this is logical.
[3:03:31.360 --> 3:03:34.360]  I mean, it's, and that's the thing I'm really noticing.
[3:03:34.360 --> 3:03:37.360]  Like you see, and you can tell they're like the liberal cause they got the haircut and
[3:03:37.360 --> 3:03:40.360]  like the, you know, the funky colors and they're like jogging in their masks.
[3:03:40.360 --> 3:03:42.360]  And like now it's a political statement.
[3:03:42.360 --> 3:03:45.360]  It's not because, oh, I'm scared of COVID.
[3:03:45.360 --> 3:03:50.360]  It's like, I'm wearing this mask, even on the flight over here, the pilot or the, I'm
[3:03:50.360 --> 3:03:54.360]  sorry, the flight attendant kept saying, wear your mask, do the right thing.
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:03:58.360]  You do the right thing and make everyone feel better when they're flying on the plane with
[3:03:58.360 --> 3:03:59.360]  you.
[3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:05.360]  It's just like, it's the right thing to do, you know, just like massaging that even though
[3:04:05.360 --> 3:04:08.360]  the only time I ever feel sick is when I have to wear that mask.
[3:04:08.360 --> 3:04:09.360]  It gives me the same.
[3:04:09.360 --> 3:04:11.360]  Oh, it makes your carbon dioxide go way up.
[3:04:11.360 --> 3:04:14.360]  It just makes me feel like I'm getting the flu.
[3:04:14.360 --> 3:04:18.360]  I mean, it's, did you see where Fauci wrote a paper 12 years ago saying that most
[3:04:18.360 --> 3:04:20.360]  Hispanic flu death was, was from the mask?
[3:04:20.360 --> 3:04:21.360]  Right.
[3:04:21.360 --> 3:04:25.360]  And I believe it because when I put that mask, I, okay, yes, I think you mentioned this
[3:04:25.360 --> 3:04:27.360]  or I got the coronavirus.
[3:04:27.360 --> 3:04:33.360]  I got it back in September and I only went to go get a test because I said, oh, my bones
[3:04:33.360 --> 3:04:35.360]  are aching a little bit.
[3:04:35.360 --> 3:04:37.360]  So whenever I get sick, my bones ache.
[3:04:37.360 --> 3:04:40.360]  So I knew something was going on and I got the test.
[3:04:40.360 --> 3:04:45.360]  I was, came back positive, but really I had one day of just kind of having like achy bones.
[3:04:45.360 --> 3:04:46.360]  I was a little tired.
[3:04:46.360 --> 3:04:47.360]  That's cause you're healthy.
[3:04:47.360 --> 3:04:48.360]  You take a lot of vitamins.
[3:04:48.360 --> 3:04:49.360]  I do.
[3:04:49.360 --> 3:04:50.360]  And I, I was sleeping.
[3:04:50.360 --> 3:04:51.360]  I wasn't drinking anything.
[3:04:51.360 --> 3:04:53.360]  I was doing a detox that month.
[3:04:53.360 --> 3:04:54.360]  And so I was really healthy.
[3:04:54.360 --> 3:04:56.360]  And so I think that definitely helps a lot.
[3:04:56.360 --> 3:05:02.360]  I'm a healthy person, but I mean, other people that I know they've gotten it and it's, for
[3:05:02.360 --> 3:05:04.360]  them, it was a mild cold.
[3:05:04.360 --> 3:05:06.360]  Not saying that it's going to be like that for everyone.
[3:05:06.360 --> 3:05:07.360]  I get it.
[3:05:07.360 --> 3:05:09.360]  Some people, they have preexisting conditions and there's other factors.
[3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:14.360]  But for the majority of people, you do not need to lock down this country.
[3:05:14.360 --> 3:05:15.360]  You just don't.
[3:05:15.360 --> 3:05:17.360]  It's, it's overkill.
[3:05:17.360 --> 3:05:18.360]  I'm just excited.
[3:05:18.360 --> 3:05:26.360]  I'm excited to be back only in this building though, because if, if I got to be out in the
[3:05:26.360 --> 3:05:28.360]  streets of Austin, Texas, by the way, you're like a real liberal.
[3:05:28.360 --> 3:05:29.360]  You're not a right winger.
[3:05:29.360 --> 3:05:31.360]  These, these liberals are not liberals.
[3:05:31.360 --> 3:05:32.360]  They're leftist devils, aren't they?
[3:05:32.360 --> 3:05:33.360]  Yeah.
[3:05:33.360 --> 3:05:34.360]  They're tyrannical.
[3:05:34.360 --> 3:05:35.360]  They're fascists.
[3:05:35.360 --> 3:05:38.360]  You know, they want to control and run people's lives.
[3:05:38.360 --> 3:05:42.360]  They have, I feel like they have brain damage because when you're.
[3:05:42.360 --> 3:05:43.360]  Yeah, you can't get through to them.
[3:05:43.360 --> 3:05:44.360]  No.
[3:05:44.360 --> 3:05:47.860]  When you're living with, with the news and everyone telling you an alternative version
[3:05:47.860 --> 3:05:52.360]  of reality, even though when your eyes are seeing the Hunter Biden tapes, for instance,
[3:05:52.360 --> 3:05:54.160]  no, that's not news.
[3:05:54.160 --> 3:05:55.160]  Look over here.
[3:05:55.160 --> 3:05:57.480]  And so they're, it's like psychological damage.
[3:05:57.480 --> 3:06:00.400]  A lot of people are living with this cognitive dissonance.
[3:06:00.400 --> 3:06:02.400]  It truly is a mental.
[3:06:02.400 --> 3:06:05.360]  We're going to come back and play this lady voting again.
[3:06:05.360 --> 3:06:08.360]  We're going to come back and finish up with Lee and play this.
[3:06:08.360 --> 3:06:10.360]  And then yeah, you're going to come on with us tonight.
[3:06:10.360 --> 3:06:11.360]  Oh yeah.
[3:06:11.360 --> 3:06:12.360]  I'm here for the long haul.
[3:06:12.360 --> 3:06:14.360]  Oh God, it might go for weeks.
[3:06:14.360 --> 3:06:15.360]  So this is terrible.
[3:06:15.360 --> 3:06:16.360]  Well, we love Lee and Magadu.
[3:06:16.360 --> 3:06:17.360]  We love Gerald Salante.
[3:06:17.360 --> 3:06:18.360]  We love you all.
[3:06:18.360 --> 3:06:19.360]  This is so exciting.
[3:06:19.360 --> 3:06:22.360]  Four years ago, she was here with Trump one.
[3:06:22.360 --> 3:06:24.360]  So she's like, she's like our mascot.
[3:06:24.360 --> 3:06:26.360]  She's like, she's like our mascot.
[3:06:26.360 --> 3:06:27.360]  She's like our mascot.
[3:06:27.360 --> 3:06:28.360]  She's like our mascot.
[3:06:28.360 --> 3:06:29.360]  She's like our mascot.
[3:06:29.360 --> 3:06:30.360]  She's like our mascot.
[3:06:30.360 --> 3:06:31.360]  She's like our mascot.
[3:06:31.360 --> 3:06:32.360]  She's like our mascot.
[3:06:32.360 --> 3:06:33.360]  She's like our mascot.
[3:06:33.360 --> 3:06:35.360]  She's like our mascot.
[3:06:35.360 --> 3:06:37.360]  Lee and Magadu are here to make sure Trump wins.
[3:06:37.360 --> 3:06:38.360]  You can believe it then.
[3:06:38.360 --> 3:06:39.360]  All right.
[3:06:39.360 --> 3:07:05.360]  Thank you, Gerald Salante.
[3:07:05.360 --> 3:07:34.360]  Thank you, Gerald Salante.
[3:07:35.360 --> 3:07:37.360]  Thank you.
[3:08:05.360 --> 3:08:07.360]  Thank you.
[3:08:35.360 --> 3:08:43.360]  Well, for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:08:43.360 --> 3:08:54.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:08:54.360 --> 3:09:05.360]  Lee and Magadu is in the house.
[3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:10.360]  That means Trump victory.
[3:09:10.360 --> 3:09:16.360]  Lee and you're going to be on with myself and Jesse James and Owen Troyer tonight.
[3:09:16.360 --> 3:09:17.360]  Seven to nine.
[3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:18.360]  Amazing.
[3:09:18.360 --> 3:09:21.360]  And with us the next two days, we are so excited to have Lee and Magadu here.
[3:09:21.360 --> 3:09:24.360]  It's just amazing.
[3:09:24.360 --> 3:09:30.360]  But since you mentioned it, you were getting into what it's like just briefly to be on
[3:09:30.360 --> 3:09:34.360]  the outside of Infowars now and to see how much it's been proven right.
[3:09:34.360 --> 3:09:35.360]  Because it is crazy.
[3:09:35.360 --> 3:09:36.360]  Yeah.
[3:09:36.360 --> 3:09:39.360]  I mean, everything that you've been saying for what, 20 plus years, and then, and I was
[3:09:39.360 --> 3:09:40.360]  a huge part of that.
[3:09:40.360 --> 3:09:42.360]  And, you know, I'm really proud of that.
[3:09:42.360 --> 3:09:46.360]  Like we really did play a major role in a lot of what's going on now.
[3:09:46.360 --> 3:09:47.360]  In the future.
[3:09:47.360 --> 3:09:48.360]  In the whole.
[3:09:48.360 --> 3:09:54.360]  Yeah, and then they're trying to shut you down so that people can't access that information
[3:09:54.360 --> 3:09:56.360]  to find out what's coming.
[3:09:56.360 --> 3:09:58.360]  And it's rolling out really fast right now.
[3:09:58.360 --> 3:10:04.360]  And for me, it's just, it's hard to watch because it's almost like there really isn't
[3:10:04.360 --> 3:10:08.360]  a voice at the moment that people can access or that can be easily spread on Facebook.
[3:10:08.360 --> 3:10:12.360]  Like we were dominating there when people were able to share the links.
[3:10:12.360 --> 3:10:15.360]  And they, they, they knew.
[3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:20.360]  So when we, when we, when we were at the young Turks, when that whole thing went down at
[3:10:20.360 --> 3:10:25.360]  the RNC, I feel like that was the moment YouTube was like, we got to take them out.
[3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:27.360]  That was such a huge story.
[3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:28.360]  That went global.
[3:10:28.360 --> 3:10:34.360]  A guy I knew in Belgium was like, I saw you on the news, like that over the globe.
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:37.360]  That was when YouTube, you remember, they shut your channel down for the first time
[3:10:37.360 --> 3:10:39.360]  and made it so that all of the.
[3:10:39.360 --> 3:10:40.360]  That was the good news.
[3:10:40.360 --> 3:10:41.360]  Back then they were still airing it.
[3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:43.360]  They didn't know that we'd already woke everybody up.
[3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:46.360]  They didn't know how powerful and then the impact that we were having.
[3:10:46.360 --> 3:10:51.360]  And that was kind of the beginning of the end or the beginning of the beginning of this
[3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:56.360]  new, you know, paradigm of how we're going to be able to access information and wake
[3:10:56.360 --> 3:10:57.360]  people up.
[3:10:57.360 --> 3:11:01.360]  We're going to have to go back to the magazine, you know, back to people signing up to get
[3:11:01.360 --> 3:11:02.360]  actual.
[3:11:02.360 --> 3:11:03.360]  It's incredible.
[3:11:03.360 --> 3:11:05.360]  Well, you're going to be here with us for the 24 hours of live coverage.
[3:11:05.360 --> 3:11:06.360]  It's going to be contested.
[3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:07.360]  We're going to be here with Lee and Magadu.
[3:11:07.360 --> 3:11:09.360]  How do folks follow you on Twitter?
[3:11:09.360 --> 3:11:11.360]  Lee and Magadu at Lee and Magadu.
[3:11:11.360 --> 3:11:12.360]  All right.
[3:11:12.360 --> 3:11:13.360]  We're going to be here.
[3:11:13.360 --> 3:11:14.360]  We're very excited.
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:15.360]  We love Lee and we love all of you.
[3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:21.360]  But here is a Fox News reporter catching a woman on tape who voted for Biden, but is
[3:11:21.360 --> 3:11:23.360]  depressed and crying because he's quote a pedophile.
[3:11:23.360 --> 3:11:27.360]  And then we will hand the baton to Gerald Solente after this lamb.
[3:11:27.360 --> 3:11:28.360]  We'll see you tonight.
[3:11:28.360 --> 3:11:29.360]  Here's the clip.
[3:11:29.360 --> 3:11:30.360]  And then Gerald Solente takes over.
[3:11:30.360 --> 3:11:42.360]  Have you voted already?
[3:11:42.360 --> 3:11:43.360]  Yes.
[3:11:43.360 --> 3:11:44.360]  Yeah.
[3:11:44.360 --> 3:11:54.360]  And, you know, what policies of his do you really resonate with?
[3:11:54.360 --> 3:12:03.360]  I resonate with the one that I can't, but it's just I am tired.
[3:12:03.360 --> 3:12:07.360]  I'm tired of the meaning of 19.
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:12.360]  I want this to say I am tired of all these races.
[3:12:12.360 --> 3:12:19.360]  I am not with Biden either because I have seen videos of him saying that he's a pedophile.
[3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:24.360]  So it's very conflicting, but from the two we have to make the better one.
[3:12:24.360 --> 3:12:27.360]  And that's why I'm with Biden.
[3:12:27.360 --> 3:12:28.360]  Thank you.
[3:12:28.360 --> 3:12:29.360]  Thank you, ma'am.
[3:12:29.360 --> 3:12:30.360]  Have a great day.
[3:12:30.360 --> 3:12:31.360]  Appreciate it.
[3:12:31.360 --> 3:12:32.360]  So the pedophiles are good.
[3:12:32.360 --> 3:12:33.360]  Trump is bad.
[3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:34.360]  Gerald Solente taking over.
[3:12:34.360 --> 3:12:35.360]  Hey, Alex.
[3:12:35.360 --> 3:12:36.360]  Hello, Lee Ann.
[3:12:36.360 --> 3:12:43.520]  So listen, I have my mask on because I want to be stupid like the rest of the prostitutes
[3:12:43.520 --> 3:12:44.520]  out there.
[3:12:44.520 --> 3:12:47.840]  Can you imagine these stupid morons?
[3:12:47.840 --> 3:12:54.120]  These little fear-mongering hysteria-selling freaks with the microphone in front of their
[3:12:54.120 --> 3:12:59.960]  face with nobody around them talking with a mask on so that they could brainwash you.
[3:12:59.960 --> 3:13:04.960]  So I'm really doing this to protect everybody out there because I don't want my breath
[3:13:04.960 --> 3:13:07.840]  going into the camera and then affecting everybody.
[3:13:07.840 --> 3:13:14.840]  Oh, and by the way, these masks, they're totally useless so you could take the mask that everybody
[3:13:14.840 --> 3:13:18.440]  is wearing and shove it up, you know what?
[3:13:18.440 --> 3:13:24.960]  Because all you have to do, if you're not that woman that was just on the air over there
[3:13:24.960 --> 3:13:32.280]  and capable of thinking for yourself and being able to read, you can read right at the top
[3:13:32.280 --> 3:13:43.080]  of the box that it says, these masks help protect against certain particular contaminants
[3:13:43.080 --> 3:13:53.040]  but do not eliminate exposure to the risk of any disease or infection.
[3:13:53.040 --> 3:13:59.240]  These are the stupid little things that everybody's wearing.
[3:13:59.240 --> 3:14:02.280]  They lose our identity.
[3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:07.520]  You don't know what anybody looks like when they're like this and that's what they want
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:12.760]  to do to us and that's what they're doing.
[3:14:12.760 --> 3:14:18.640]  So going into the election, it's going to be as we had in our, there you got it, right
[3:14:18.640 --> 3:14:21.920]  there, it's in black and white.
[3:14:21.920 --> 3:14:22.920]  I got to be equal.
[3:14:22.920 --> 3:14:27.880]  I got to say black and white because if I just said it's in white, then I'd be called
[3:14:27.880 --> 3:14:28.880]  a racist.
[3:14:28.880 --> 3:14:33.960]  So I got to say it's in black and white, even though it's blue and white, I'll say black
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:34.960]  and white.
[3:14:34.960 --> 3:14:38.000]  And again, I want to make this clear to everybody.
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:46.280]  Black is not a racist nation, America elected the clown that's going out campaigning for
[3:14:46.280 --> 3:14:54.560]  Biden, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama, the little lying SOB that told
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:15:00.440]  everybody he was a peace candidate, yeah, a piece of crap candidate, yeah, and what
[3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:07.840]  color was he, a couple of shades darker than me, oh yeah, Condoleezza rice, what was it,
[3:15:07.840 --> 3:15:13.380]  what was that other murderer, a, a Colin Powell that sold us the Iraq war with that
[3:15:13.380 --> 3:15:21.000]  tube of Colin crap in front of the UN, black, white, America doesn't elect a black president
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:24.960]  if it's a racist nation, so save it.
[3:15:24.960 --> 3:15:28.240]  I don't want to hear it.
[3:15:28.240 --> 3:15:33.760]  So anyway, going back to the election.
[3:15:33.760 --> 3:15:39.400]  My forecast is toss up what Trump victory.
[3:15:39.400 --> 3:15:41.760]  And I'll tell you why.
[3:15:41.760 --> 3:15:46.480]  A lot of people are afraid to say they're going to vote for Trump.
[3:15:46.480 --> 3:15:49.080]  A lot of them.
[3:15:49.080 --> 3:15:56.840]  You already have some 90 watt million people, nine and a half, 90.6 million people or some
[3:15:56.840 --> 3:16:07.600]  900, excuse me, 90.6 million people have voted in the last election, 139 or something like
[3:16:07.600 --> 3:16:08.600]  that million voted.
[3:16:08.600 --> 3:16:16.800]  So you have two thirds of the people already voted in the last election, 100 million people
[3:16:16.800 --> 3:16:20.280]  that are registered voters didn't vote.
[3:16:20.280 --> 3:16:28.200]  And I believe this is going to be a huge turnout and I believe the rural districts are going
[3:16:28.200 --> 3:16:31.560]  to come out very heavily for Trump.
[3:16:31.560 --> 3:16:41.480]  And he has, and when you look at Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, these are blue
[3:16:41.480 --> 3:16:49.720]  color states and the blue color doesn't relate to the demo craps anymore because they sold
[3:16:49.720 --> 3:16:57.840]  us out with Bill Clinton sending our jobs overseas, NAFTA, World Trade Organization
[3:16:57.840 --> 3:17:00.320]  bringing China in.
[3:17:00.320 --> 3:17:04.520]  So my forecast and I could look, you know, it's only life, you know, you're right and
[3:17:04.520 --> 3:17:05.520]  you're wrong.
[3:17:05.520 --> 3:17:10.160]  But I'm going with Trump 2020 as my top trend forecast for this year, which came out in
[3:17:10.160 --> 3:17:17.360]  December 2019 and I'm sticking with it and was trumped by default, the fault of the Democrats.
[3:17:17.360 --> 3:17:22.960]  Look at the jerk they got running and dead Joe Biden.
[3:17:22.960 --> 3:17:27.800]  So I don't see a lot of young people in the rural areas running out in the swing states
[3:17:27.800 --> 3:17:34.600]  to go vote for him, but he'll get him in the New York in California.
[3:17:34.600 --> 3:17:36.160]  We'll be right back in a little bit.
[3:17:36.160 --> 3:18:06.120]  Stay tuned.
[3:18:06.120 --> 3:18:27.840]  It's

[3:19:49.680 --> 3:19:54.200]  George Soros is that we want violence and we offensively want to go out and

[3:20:14.680 --> 3:20:18.600]  have no desire for this we have been talking about the Democrats calling for
[3:20:18.600 --> 3:20:22.020]  civil war calling for an overrun in the White House calling for killing Trump
[3:20:22.020 --> 3:20:25.640]  calling for killing cops it's all over the news you see the violent attacks and
[3:20:25.640 --> 3:20:29.200]  we're simply saying that if they kill Trump or have a fraudulent election in
[3:20:29.200 --> 3:20:32.520]  throwing him out of office and come after us people have to be ready to
[3:20:32.520 --> 3:20:38.640]  defend themselves defense not offense look out for false flags
[3:20:38.640 --> 3:20:59.680]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:59.680 --> 3:21:09.820]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show with
[3:21:09.820 --> 3:21:16.220]  Gerald Salente
[3:21:16.860 --> 3:21:24.940]  you know Alex Jones show yeah there's that too miss ask me and it's like the
[3:21:24.940 --> 3:21:30.380]  rest of the prostitutes he symbolizes them perfectly if this is the front page
[3:21:30.380 --> 3:21:37.540]  of the business section of the toilet paper records today the New York Times
[3:21:37.540 --> 3:21:42.460]  they call this a business section they said first of all it's a joke look at
[3:21:42.460 --> 3:21:46.860]  all the pictures here it's just that that just kills space I mean it says
[3:21:46.860 --> 3:21:57.060]  nothing and then you open it up all the all the photos and it's just a tiny
[3:21:57.060 --> 3:22:02.940]  little thing of absolute and then there's a whole and on one page nothing on
[3:22:02.940 --> 3:22:11.900]  the back page another ad so you have one you got why eight pages four of them
[3:22:11.900 --> 3:22:19.380]  when you add it up nothing but pitches they're the size of these things I'm
[3:22:19.380 --> 3:22:22.140]  making this up
[3:22:24.700 --> 3:22:28.500]  they look business you're not getting anything out of this but the what I
[3:22:28.500 --> 3:22:38.740]  wanted to refer to retailers brace mayhem with plywood and security in
[3:22:38.740 --> 3:22:46.460]  anticipation of what's gonna happen tomorrow night here's my forecast if
[3:22:46.460 --> 3:22:51.740]  Trump wins which I think he will or at least it'll be a toss-up when we won't
[3:22:51.740 --> 3:23:00.020]  know there's gonna be riots in the street if Biden wins clearly the BLM and
[3:23:00.020 --> 3:23:07.220]  the Antifa won't come out that's my that's my hunch so I don't know the
[3:23:07.220 --> 3:23:15.380]  violence is going to continue and for many other reasons and the big reason
[3:23:15.380 --> 3:23:23.420]  is a bunch of slimy people called politicians have locked down the
[3:23:23.420 --> 3:23:29.740]  economy here in New York you got the little dictator over here went on third
[3:23:29.740 --> 3:23:34.580]  base and thought he had a homerun Andy Cuomo now saying that if you come from
[3:23:34.580 --> 3:23:39.540]  another state or you're traveling out of another state except for the three
[3:23:39.540 --> 3:23:46.540]  around us over here Pennsylvania New Jersey and Connecticut you have to get
[3:23:46.540 --> 3:23:57.140]  tested the COVID I came back from Florida last Sunday not this Sunday but a
[3:23:57.140 --> 3:24:06.380]  week ago and they didn't you know flew down they didn't bother me but now it's
[3:24:06.380 --> 3:24:12.820]  going to be more of that and the Blasio urges New Yorkers not to travel for
[3:24:12.820 --> 3:24:22.660]  holidays and you have one after another of what they're doing here they're gonna
[3:24:22.660 --> 3:24:29.700]  kid they've killed business are ready we're in the greatest depression the
[3:24:29.700 --> 3:24:34.500]  likes of which we're seeing are unprecedented in modern human history
[3:24:34.500 --> 3:24:40.540]  and it's not only the United States you got that other clown over there in the
[3:24:40.540 --> 3:24:47.020]  UK and they got an F and a C probably thrown into it what they're doing to
[3:24:47.020 --> 3:24:54.140]  the people and they locked down the joint there you go time squared no time
[3:24:54.140 --> 3:25:00.100]  and time square it's dead all over midtown Manhattan by the way is dead
[3:25:00.100 --> 3:25:06.460]  dead because there's no tourists no theater or the ballet say may come back
[3:25:06.460 --> 3:25:15.180]  next spring and anyway going back to the UK they're locked down too and then
[3:25:15.180 --> 3:25:22.100]  Germany's locking down more and then you have Italy and Spain
[3:25:22.100 --> 3:25:33.220]  Czech Republic Holland Belgium France one after another locking down destroying
[3:25:33.220 --> 3:25:41.340]  the lives of tens of millions of people and the anti-lockdown protests erupt
[3:25:41.340 --> 3:25:53.460]  across Spain also in Italy and Torino and Napoli Naples in Rome and you're
[3:25:53.460 --> 3:26:00.740]  gonna see them erupting more and more and more and more business is going to
[3:26:00.740 --> 3:26:10.380]  die in the winter the restaurants were allowed in the east coast in some places
[3:26:10.380 --> 3:26:18.700]  many places you could soy people outside but you can't let them eat inside they
[3:26:18.700 --> 3:26:27.260]  have a 25% capacity rate that's no capacity at all now it's cold outside
[3:26:27.260 --> 3:26:37.180]  you say I got a turtle neck sweater and it's cashing it because it's cold here so
[3:26:37.180 --> 3:26:42.140]  all the places around that had those heat lamps and people sitting on I ain't
[3:26:42.140 --> 3:26:47.900]  gonna be outside anymore and you only allow in New York City and a lot of
[3:26:47.900 --> 3:26:56.100]  cities 25% capacity and like in Michigan in New York you have to give your name
[3:26:56.100 --> 3:26:59.380]  your telephone number gave you temperature taking oh yes fun I'm gonna
[3:26:59.380 --> 3:27:06.140]  go out here shove it goes back to why I think Trump is going to win it's gonna
[3:27:06.140 --> 3:27:13.460]  be locked down versus no lockdown it's the economy stupid that was the cover
[3:27:13.460 --> 3:27:23.100]  of our trends journal on the 20th of October people are sick of this you're
[3:27:23.100 --> 3:27:29.700]  gonna see protests and riots and then you put on top of this and it's already
[3:27:29.700 --> 3:27:36.300]  happening and again we forecast it back in February that there'd be rises in
[3:27:36.300 --> 3:27:42.500]  violence and now you're seeing it homicide rates going up all over not
[3:27:42.500 --> 3:27:46.740]  only the United States around the world you know what I say when people lose
[3:27:46.740 --> 3:27:53.380]  everything and I'm nothing left to lose they lose it if Trump weighed one
[3:27:53.380 --> 3:27:57.980]  mistake and he's made a number of them I disagree with a number of his policies
[3:27:57.980 --> 3:28:02.980]  particularly with Venezuela and Iran and given all that dough those tax breaks
[3:28:02.980 --> 3:28:08.980]  that are rich cats but the big mistake he made to me on the campaign trail was
[3:28:08.980 --> 3:28:19.460]  not focusing 100% unlocking down verse opening up and the other thing to the
[3:28:19.460 --> 3:28:24.660]  hunter-biden issue and I watched those debate they're not debates that's a
[3:28:24.660 --> 3:28:29.700]  little game show you got two minutes to answer dirty shit response and I watched
[3:28:29.700 --> 3:28:34.660]  that last one where the woman gave Biden the last voice over and over again
[3:28:34.660 --> 3:28:40.780]  because they're the prostitutes in that court Trump only has the Fox
[3:28:40.780 --> 3:28:45.140]  prostitutes and he had that little jerk another daddy's boy born on third base
[3:28:45.140 --> 3:28:49.820]  another little nobody of nothing that Chris Wallace you think Chris would have
[3:28:49.820 --> 3:28:56.380]  been there daddy wasn't Mike save it man like a little boy Chris Cuomo save it
[3:28:56.380 --> 3:29:05.020]  Jack like a little boy Anderson Cooper yeah mommy was Gloria Vanda built yeah
[3:29:05.020 --> 3:29:08.100]  you think the money got him there
[3:29:08.100 --> 3:29:17.500]  these aren't debates these are little freak shows put on by freaks so going
[3:29:17.500 --> 3:29:24.940]  back to the whole scene here there he is oh remember when he got hurt over there
[3:29:24.940 --> 3:29:32.700]  in Egypt when the Arab Spring oh when he ran home crying yeah tough guy huh they're
[3:29:32.700 --> 3:29:41.860]  all tough but they're separated between a camera and you man-to-man death
[3:29:41.860 --> 3:29:50.340]  Cajones the size of a hey maybe to bin yeah you got that guy too been the CNN
[3:29:50.340 --> 3:29:58.580]  guy yeah he likes to play it out on zoom shows you who they are and that's what
[3:29:58.580 --> 3:30:03.820]  they're doing right now they're jerking us around and that's why you need to
[3:30:03.820 --> 3:30:10.780]  support info wars that's why you need to keep the truth alive they banned our
[3:30:10.780 --> 3:30:15.980]  cover one of our covers on LinkedIn with the ones showing crap going down
[3:30:15.980 --> 3:30:24.220]  people's heads to the media but do you have to put money where your heart and
[3:30:24.220 --> 3:30:27.580]  mind are because this is really an urgent time we're in that's the cover
[3:30:27.580 --> 3:30:36.980]  they've been could you imagine that support info war you right back the
[3:30:36.980 --> 3:30:41.380]  control corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation or government
[3:30:41.380 --> 3:30:45.780]  that'll pay them it's that simple they've used our open free society against us
[3:30:45.780 --> 3:30:49.620]  the control media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years and
[3:30:49.620 --> 3:30:53.900]  obsess over it they see he's a liar on purpose even though our success rate our
[3:30:53.900 --> 3:30:58.500]  accuracy rate is way way better than theirs we try to tell the truth they
[3:30:58.500 --> 3:31:02.540]  tried a lot they tried to see I'm trying to get people to realize that the
[3:31:02.540 --> 3:31:07.540]  globalist operate how they manipulate how they bamboozle the public I'm
[3:31:07.540 --> 3:31:11.180]  trying to get the public to ask questions and do not believe what they're
[3:31:11.180 --> 3:31:17.180]  told in the face I'm trying to get people to research for themselves the
[3:31:17.180 --> 3:31:20.940]  globalist and their control corporate press say that researching and not
[3:31:20.940 --> 3:31:25.140]  trusting media is evil and as a conspiracy theory well again on its face
[3:31:25.140 --> 3:31:30.060]  that is a fraud question everything question info wars add your own
[3:31:30.060 --> 3:31:33.300]  research to it and decide what you're going to promote to others and what
[3:31:33.300 --> 3:31:37.900]  new sources are accurate I believe info wars is the best source out there it's
[3:31:37.900 --> 3:31:44.780]  all on record Yale Harvard Princeton Stanford they were all hired a year ago
[3:31:44.780 --> 3:31:49.900]  and then again six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked
[3:31:49.900 --> 3:31:54.620]  down during a pandemic and how to get the public to take inoculations and they
[3:31:54.620 --> 3:31:58.340]  talk about calling people heroes that do it they talk about shaming those that
[3:31:58.340 --> 3:32:03.620]  don't this is all been psychologically tested it's all been psychologically
[3:32:03.620 --> 3:32:07.300]  prepared and once they get you to lock down for 15 days you notice now they
[3:32:07.300 --> 3:32:11.740]  say it's permanent that's how it works oh just put these handcuffs on the
[3:32:11.740 --> 3:32:14.700]  serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all
[3:32:14.700 --> 3:32:19.900]  right no now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial

[3:37:12.180 --> 3:37:16.340]  in the trends journal as I mentioned I got censored for putting up a cover on
[3:37:16.340 --> 3:37:21.620]  LinkedIn I also got censored on LinkedIn for saying that we have liars cowards
[3:37:21.620 --> 3:37:26.300]  freaks and fools telling us what to do we shouldn't suck up and bow down to
[3:37:26.300 --> 3:37:31.420]  them that's a fact so we should that that's called harassment and bullying
[3:37:31.420 --> 3:37:39.380]  brainwashed by crap Facebook BBC CNN Fox News and Time magazine brainwashed by
[3:37:39.380 --> 3:37:44.140]  crap you're not allowed to say that and by the way that's a work by Anthony
[3:37:44.140 --> 3:37:49.020]  Frieden Stephen Green who collaborated on that and that's exactly what's going
[3:37:49.020 --> 3:37:53.220]  on and the people are buying the crap the masses are buying it crap heads
[3:37:53.220 --> 3:38:00.420]  every way you look facts don't matter so I want to make very clear we're going
[3:38:00.420 --> 3:38:05.260]  into the greatest depression this is like nothing we've ever seen before in
[3:38:05.260 --> 3:38:09.180]  history yeah the equity markets are going up because they're artificially
[3:38:09.180 --> 3:38:13.500]  being propped up Gregory Matarito writes about it now trends journal we've
[3:38:13.500 --> 3:38:17.780]  been writing about it for years he's backing it up very other important very
[3:38:17.780 --> 3:38:23.580]  important in the trends journal we have great articles by Bradley Steiner on
[3:38:23.580 --> 3:38:29.940]  post-combat better learn how to protect yourself because things are going to be
[3:38:29.940 --> 3:38:34.780]  very violent Bradley Steiner is one of the top guys around he was the teacher
[3:38:34.780 --> 3:38:41.420]  of my teacher John Perkins no not that John Perkins that not that guy the John
[3:38:41.420 --> 3:38:46.060]  Perkins of attack proof dot com there he goes there's that there's the one by
[3:38:46.060 --> 3:38:49.940]  Brad Steiner with showing the fingers in the eyes but it's not like that when
[3:38:49.940 --> 3:38:56.620]  you do it not even close to that and all this information of course to prepare

[3:39:09.700 --> 3:39:16.580]  I'm telling you now learn self-defense learn again close combat is the one for
[3:39:16.580 --> 3:39:20.020]  me again it's not like eyes like that like in the little picture over there
[3:39:20.020 --> 3:39:24.420]  it's Jack you're dead man right through your eyes and through your brain a
[3:39:24.420 --> 3:39:28.820]  little shield over there you're ripping out that carotid artery with your teeth
[3:39:28.820 --> 3:39:34.620]  and pushing that nose through the brain I mean that's the real fight and you

[3:39:38.860 --> 3:39:42.820]  somebody the right posture to have the right way to hold your hands the right
[3:39:42.820 --> 3:39:48.020]  way to be ready to go you're looking at violent crime rising all across the
[3:39:48.020 --> 3:39:53.500]  nation and again we'd forecast this back in the end of February and our trends
[3:39:53.500 --> 3:39:57.700]  journal we also forecast that people will be leaving densely populated areas
[3:39:57.700 --> 3:40:02.460]  for suburban and ex-urban areas long before anybody else did they didn't start
[3:40:02.460 --> 3:40:09.500]  talking about it till June anyway moving on to some other trends very important
[3:40:09.500 --> 3:40:17.180]  today's financial times front-page story you got it
[3:40:18.020 --> 3:40:25.980]  Eurozone growth outlook darkens after lockdowns fuel downgrades
[3:40:25.980 --> 3:40:40.100]  eurozone growth growth outlook darkens hey it was dark already oh by the way I
[3:40:40.100 --> 3:40:47.300]  find that word dark and I find that racial let's be stupid okay anyway this
[3:40:47.300 --> 3:40:54.300]  thing was going down before the eurozone was going into recession in 2019 it
[3:40:54.300 --> 3:41:02.780]  barely missed it it was no tourism this year places like Italy Spain Portugal
[3:41:02.780 --> 3:41:07.940]  France all those Chinese tourists they weren't allowed to leave they stayed
[3:41:07.940 --> 3:41:13.140]  there oh but the Chinese economy is going up it's gonna be the only major
[3:41:13.140 --> 3:41:19.980]  economy going up and you could thank Biden and Clinton and all the demo
[3:41:19.980 --> 3:41:29.020]  craps and repulsive guns for doing it that's right by bringing China into the
[3:41:29.020 --> 3:41:33.620]  world trade organization you look at China's gross domestic product before
[3:41:33.620 --> 3:41:42.260]  they got in they got in 2001 two weeks after 9-11 was nobody was watching the
[3:41:42.260 --> 3:41:46.940]  Clinton administration pushed it through murder a little Georgie Bush another
[3:41:46.940 --> 3:41:51.100]  little boy born on third base and 30 at a home run a little nobody would be no
[3:41:51.100 --> 3:41:55.620]  way if daddy wasn't the bush before him and the bush before that one press Scott
[3:41:55.620 --> 3:42:05.300]  and on and on that follow that line he signed them in Chinese GDP was like this
[3:42:05.300 --> 3:42:12.700]  and around 2001 it goes like that they're the only ones going up they're
[3:42:12.700 --> 3:42:17.180]  going up as everybody else is going down
[3:42:17.180 --> 3:42:25.700]  Europe's a mess there are protests everywhere except in the United States
