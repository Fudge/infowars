[00:00.000 --> 00:11.320]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[00:11.320 --> 00:20.440]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.440 --> 00:24.680]  well for the next hour ladies and gentlemen then we're gonna get back
[00:24.680 --> 00:30.160]  into the kamikaze attack in Austin and what's really going on there but for the
[00:30.160 --> 00:37.240]  next hour former congressman traffic ant is our guest James traffic ant we're
[00:37.240 --> 00:45.160]  very honored to have him with us he of course ran in 1984 as a low-budget
[00:45.160 --> 00:48.720]  grassroots campaign for Congress despite being outspent seven to one by an
[00:48.720 --> 00:53.000]  incumbent Republican traffic ant one handily by 18,000 votes he'd been
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.960]  re-elected seven times in 2002 they set him up it's completely transparent just
[00:58.960 --> 01:03.080]  like with the governor of Alabama that's now admitted they had to release him
[01:03.080 --> 01:07.680]  from prison it came out it was a complete fraud a setup they threatened to
[01:07.680 --> 01:11.680]  put somebody in prison that worked for him if they didn't lie same thing with
[01:11.680 --> 01:15.560]  James traffic ant mr. traffic ant great to have you here with us well I've
[01:15.560 --> 01:19.280]  got you on your show Alex has got a great show I'm sorry I haven't been there so
[01:19.280 --> 01:26.440]  far but you really educated the American people for sure well you've
[01:26.440 --> 01:30.200]  been in solitary confinement and in the and in the concentration camp so you
[01:30.200 --> 01:34.800]  couldn't come on but it's great to have you here sir break down what really
[01:34.800 --> 01:38.240]  happened to you for some out there that may not know and why it's so important
[01:38.240 --> 01:42.840]  well I think what's amazing about the whole ordeal was it was a 15 million
[01:42.840 --> 01:50.080]  dollar investigation over a span of six years over 258 all honor about the time
[01:50.080 --> 01:55.880]  that the Trade Center and the Pentagon were being attacked the bottom line is
[01:55.880 --> 02:00.200]  the government and this is the issue now Alex that will be coming to bear the
[02:00.200 --> 02:04.320]  government admitted a trial voluntarily that they made no audio or
[02:04.320 --> 02:08.880]  videotapes on me in six years and the reason they did that it's evident is
[02:08.880 --> 02:13.520]  because they had no evidence of any crimes whatsoever they had no evidence
[02:13.520 --> 02:18.200]  physical evidence they had seven people who were pressured to lie three of them
[02:18.200 --> 02:21.920]  four of them already recanted that they were pressured to lie and there's a
[02:21.920 --> 02:26.680]  young man in Nigeria smitten after David to the Nigerian government as life was
[02:26.680 --> 02:31.080]  ruined because he wouldn't purge himself and the trafficking case against
[02:31.080 --> 02:35.080]  trafficking for the government so this thing is going to blow up I think before
[02:35.080 --> 02:38.520]  it's over I'm gonna get some money out of this and they're gonna pay dearly I've
[02:38.520 --> 02:43.960]  had it and I think everybody in Austin is familiar with the term I've had it by
[02:43.960 --> 02:50.160]  now well since you brought that subject up to me when we went to break what's
[02:50.160 --> 02:54.520]  your bottom line on the attack on the IRS building well you know the IRS has
[02:54.520 --> 02:59.800]  become such an agency where they actually have testified Alex before
[02:59.800 --> 03:07.520]  Congress that fear fear is what produces compliance voluntary compliance by the
[03:07.520 --> 03:13.640]  American people and without fear there can be no no collection of taxes now to
[03:13.640 --> 03:19.040]  me this is an absolute oxymoron in a free republic to hear a statement like
[03:19.040 --> 03:24.000]  that coming from an institution such as internal revenue service you know I my
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.240]  my particular case is quite documented I am the congressman that did change the
[03:29.240 --> 03:34.760]  burden of proof of civil tax case before 1998 the taxpayer was guilty and had
[03:34.760 --> 03:39.000]  to prove himself innocent I was able to change that the 98 tax bill with the
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.520]  help of a Texan by the name of Bill Archer the chairman of the Republican
[03:44.520 --> 03:48.000]  chairman of House Ways and Means Committee and Bill Archer put my
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.480]  language in in the conference committee because the IRS has threatened a veto by
[03:52.480 --> 03:55.560]  President Clinton if it had the trafficking language so I want to give
[03:55.560 --> 04:00.560]  tremendous credit in the state of Texas to that little man I think if George W.
[04:00.560 --> 04:03.960]  Bush would have made Bill Archer his secretary the Treasury this country
[04:03.960 --> 04:08.000]  wouldn't be in the fix it then but having said that Alex the results were
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.840]  dramatic they did a study one year before the bill and one year after and all of
[04:12.840 --> 04:16.360]  the variables dealt basically with the traffic and burden of proof language
[04:16.360 --> 04:22.440]  wage garnishment is dropped from 3.1 million to 560,000 property lease
[04:22.440 --> 04:28.920]  dropped from 670,000 to 160,000 an individual family owned the homes seized
[04:28.920 --> 04:37.240]  by the IRS drop from 10,070 to 57 homes Alex 57 and 50 states we do we've got an
[04:37.240 --> 04:42.480]  agency that's out of control one of my last bill was in tandem with two
[04:42.480 --> 04:47.880]  republicans one from Louisiana Billy Tozan and one from Colorado congressman
[04:47.880 --> 04:50.840]  James traffic and I hate to interrupt you we've got to go to break sir I am
[04:50.840 --> 04:54.720]  gonna skip the next break coming up so we have more time continue from there
[04:54.720 --> 05:01.560]  after this quick break stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good
[05:01.560 --> 05:05.560]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[05:05.560 --> 05:09.360]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[05:09.360 --> 05:13.440]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[05:13.440 --> 05:17.680]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[05:17.680 --> 05:21.960]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[05:21.960 --> 05:25.920]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[05:25.920 --> 05:30.320]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[05:30.320 --> 05:34.040]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[05:34.040 --> 05:38.160]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[05:38.160 --> 05:42.000]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar

[06:05.880 --> 06:10.480]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[06:10.480 --> 06:15.160]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home tremendous
[06:15.160 --> 06:20.200]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[06:20.200 --> 06:25.280]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[06:25.280 --> 06:29.280]  full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[06:29.280 --> 06:33.960]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[06:38.000 --> 06:41.680]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[06:41.680 --> 06:46.760]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[08:01.240 --> 08:06.400]  communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because
[08:06.400 --> 08:16.960]  there's a war on for your mind I have studied Governor Siegelman's case when
[08:16.960 --> 08:21.680]  it first happened and he's been vindicated it was a total set up I have
[08:21.680 --> 08:28.440]  studied James Traficant's case absolutely set up when they can
[08:28.440 --> 08:33.960]  persecute governors and congressmen and put them in prison for no reason and
[08:33.960 --> 08:39.680]  ruin them financially when they could persecute a sitting governor or a
[08:39.680 --> 08:43.760]  sitting congressman none of us are safe like they tortured Congressman Hanson
[08:43.760 --> 08:48.800]  we of course came to his aid this they desoldered until his feet exploded
[08:48.800 --> 08:53.720]  driving him around for weeks chained up this is the type of Hanoi Hilton stuff
[08:53.720 --> 08:57.320]  that's going on when to talk about what happened to Traficant in prison why it
[08:57.320 --> 09:02.360]  was persecuted the IRS what he thinks of the event in Austin what he's told me
[09:02.360 --> 09:06.680]  off air if he wants to say that on air then we'll talk about who targeted him
[09:06.680 --> 09:11.960]  for persecution and why and how he's going to be the comeback kid and
[09:11.960 --> 09:14.760]  hopefully our listeners will support him we're gonna give you an address he
[09:14.760 --> 09:19.360]  didn't ask for this I did I just got his address for people to send him not
[09:19.360 --> 09:22.760]  campaign money he's gonna run again as an independent but to get him back on his
[09:22.760 --> 09:27.920]  feet so he can because they've ruined him and sucked his treasure out of him so
[09:27.920 --> 09:31.160]  he can't defend himself if this ever happens to me and unfortunately there's
[09:31.160 --> 09:35.320]  a good chance it will when I get out of prison I want people to support me I'm
[09:35.320 --> 09:40.520]  ready I understand what happens okay going back to James Traficant James you
[09:40.520 --> 09:44.640]  got cut off by the break about how you were the number one true defender against
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.800]  the criminal IRS go ahead well at least first I want to say I know you you said
[09:49.800 --> 09:53.200]  that maybe one day when you're off the air maybe you might have similar type of
[09:53.200 --> 09:57.480]  problems and I want to say this this may be maybe one of the best compliment you
[09:57.480 --> 10:01.200]  ever get I think you would have deserved that because you would have drawn the
[10:01.200 --> 10:05.600]  ire of a government that is completely out of control and I believe your voice
[10:05.600 --> 10:09.400]  is becoming that strong that quite frankly I'm gonna give you a little bit of
[10:09.400 --> 10:13.440]  advice now be very careful and watch yourself because you are having that kind
[10:13.440 --> 10:17.000]  of an effect and when people start and begin to have an effect if it's not
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.200]  singing to the choir it's a real problem but having said that we were talking
[10:21.200 --> 10:25.240]  before about the Internal Revenue Service and we're done you know I'm like
[10:25.240 --> 10:29.960]  everybody else in the country is seeing the headline news and the fiasco and the
[10:29.960 --> 10:35.440]  tragedy that struck Austin but you know when you look at the Internal Revenue
[10:35.440 --> 10:40.960]  Service they have evoked over the years fear fear and abuse in fact they've
[10:40.960 --> 10:44.800]  testified Alex before the Congress United States that without fear they
[10:44.800 --> 10:49.160]  wouldn't have their voluntary quote unquote voluntary compliant let me tell
[10:49.160 --> 10:53.760]  you something fear has no place in the Constitution United States or in the
[10:53.760 --> 10:59.680]  fabric of American government and we've got a real problem now in 1998 I was the
[10:59.680 --> 11:04.560]  individual responsible for changing the burden of proof in the civil tax case as
[11:04.560 --> 11:11.200]  I said earlier I want to tip my hat to a Texan Mr. Bill Archer Mr. Bill Archer
[11:11.200 --> 11:15.880]  was the Republican chairman of Ways and Means Committee and the trafficking
[11:15.880 --> 11:19.840]  language was not in the bill that reform bill because the IRS that threatened a
[11:19.840 --> 11:24.320]  veto to President Clinton if it contained the trafficking language well after
[11:24.320 --> 11:27.920]  the bill passed the House I got a call from the chairman Archer and he said you
[11:27.920 --> 11:31.960]  know we have so much support for your bill that he said he was going to put it
[11:31.960 --> 11:35.880]  in in the conference committee between the House and the Senate he did and I
[11:35.880 --> 11:39.040]  honestly believe this and I want the people of Texas who are listening to
[11:39.040 --> 11:44.680]  hear this that I believe if President Bush would have named Bill Archer his
[11:44.680 --> 11:48.360]  Secretary of Treasury America would not be in the fix this thing today now
[11:48.360 --> 11:52.240]  having said that what the trafficking bill basically said was this up until
[11:52.240 --> 11:58.560]  98 Alex you had an agency that says Alex you you lost $50,000 and you say my
[11:58.560 --> 12:03.080]  god how could I owe you $50,000 and they say well prove you don't Alex the
[12:03.080 --> 12:06.280]  burden of proof you see was on a taxpayer the trafficking language
[12:06.280 --> 12:11.800]  changed that and in 98 when it bill passed they did a study one year after
[12:11.800 --> 12:16.240]  the passage of the bill Alex and they compared one year before the passage to
[12:16.240 --> 12:21.400]  one year after the passage and there were three salient points of concern
[12:21.400 --> 12:25.720]  that were covered by their study the person was wage garnishment when the
[12:25.720 --> 12:30.480]  burden of proof was on the taxpayer there were 3.1 million Americans whose
[12:30.480 --> 12:33.800]  wages were garnished the following year with the burden of proof on the
[12:33.800 --> 12:40.400]  internal revenue service that dropped to 561,000 three million less that like the
[12:40.400 --> 12:48.240]  second category was property lien there were 670,000 a year before 161,000 a
[12:48.240 --> 12:52.640]  year after in the final category was individual family owned homes that were
[12:52.640 --> 12:57.720]  seized taken by the IRS the year before when the taxpayer had the burden of
[12:57.720 --> 13:05.680]  proof it was 10,073 the year after it was 57 Alex one per state when they had
[13:05.680 --> 13:10.400]  to prove it you see one of the last measures that I had and it really was
[13:10.400 --> 13:16.080]  upsetting and chairman Archer said he liked the bill well I teamed up with two
[13:16.080 --> 13:22.360]  republicans Billy Tozan of Louisiana and Dan Schaffer of Colorado and it was
[13:22.360 --> 13:28.800]  the flat tax the fair tax a straight consumption tax and let me tell you
[13:28.800 --> 13:34.120]  something it repeals the 16th amendment and throws out the IRS it
[13:34.120 --> 13:39.520]  abolishes all withholding all debt taxes all capital gains taxes corporate
[13:39.520 --> 13:46.360]  taxes individual tax on expenses for education investment tax and it's
[13:46.360 --> 13:50.320]  about time Alex and what everybody's saying while you're going to put a 25
[13:50.320 --> 13:54.440]  percent consumption tax on us trafficking and you're going to bankrupt
[13:54.440 --> 13:58.520]  everybody with these cost increases listen to the study that was performed in
[13:58.520 --> 14:02.520]  Harvard they said when you throw out this burdensome tax code that has
[14:02.520 --> 14:06.480]  destroyed companies and destroyed our competitiveness they said they will have
[14:06.480 --> 14:10.760]  downward movement to gain market share sounds like capitalism all over again and
[14:10.760 --> 14:16.160]  they predict that the prices would hardly raise if at all and you'll have
[14:16.160 --> 14:20.320]  Social Security fully funded Medicare fully funded and you'll have the same
[14:20.320 --> 14:25.400]  neutral if not more revenue stream than we have now but the bottom line is you
[14:25.400 --> 14:30.640]  see Alex it's time to reward work our tax code is basically a progressive
[14:30.640 --> 14:35.960]  communist tax code that was founded by Karl Marx and here's how it works the
[14:35.960 --> 14:39.480]  harder you work the more you pay the harder you work you get hit over the
[14:39.480 --> 14:46.120]  head we subsidize illegitimacy we reward dependency we kill investment we
[14:46.120 --> 14:50.440]  chase companies overseas these companies they say they're not patriots
[14:50.440 --> 14:53.600]  because they left America the reason they left is the tax code is made
[14:53.600 --> 14:58.360]  impossible to make a profit in America we've got to change it scrap it throw the
[14:58.360 --> 15:02.880]  internal revenue service out the polish the withholding absolutely and that's
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.520]  where we got to go Alex and let me say this briefly about this man in Texas
[15:07.520 --> 15:12.760]  from what I understand he was not a wacko he had it and there's so many people
[15:12.760 --> 15:17.600]  that had it it's not unusual to see him fencing at the internal revenue service
[15:17.600 --> 15:22.480]  my God Congress United States is derelict in their duties to not repeal the
[15:22.480 --> 15:28.040]  16th Amendment throw out individual personal tax reward a man for his labor
[15:28.040 --> 15:31.760]  not punish him and that's where we got to go Alex that's exactly where we got
[15:31.760 --> 15:36.080]  to go well look at Geithner and most of the White House don't pay their taxes
[15:36.080 --> 15:42.760]  but in the news is saying look at this tax cheat Joe Stack he's scum but then
[15:42.760 --> 15:47.000]  but then the big boys they don't even have to pay the tax this is one of the
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  problems you have selective enforcement in all areas first of all we need a whole
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.320]  address to our central government this is the United States of America not the
[15:57.320 --> 16:02.080]  central government of America and states quite frankly Alex to become background
[16:02.080 --> 16:06.560]  music in a doctor's office and I think one of the biggest mistakes ever made
[16:06.560 --> 16:12.160]  was the amendment to the Constitution that provided for popular votes for this
[16:12.160 --> 16:16.200]  for the U.S. Senate I know this might sound different off the people you know
[16:16.200 --> 16:19.960]  we need the 17th Amendment back here's what I'm saying when you get rid of it
[16:19.960 --> 16:24.680]  in the old days those two U.S. senators were beholding to the state
[16:24.680 --> 16:28.320]  legislature in the respective states if they didn't do what the states wanted
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.280]  they replaced them now you've got these senators that are basically senators for
[16:32.280 --> 16:37.680]  America we've lost states rights we've taken away we've developed this big
[16:37.680 --> 16:42.520]  central powerful government this molded us my god we got a tax code has become a
[16:42.520 --> 16:47.520]  behavior modification for economic activity this is crazy Alex and I think
[16:47.520 --> 16:51.960]  it's not rocket science there can be tremendous changes here and it's not
[16:51.960 --> 16:57.200]  change that's needed it's replacement and I think I will make this statement on
[16:57.200 --> 17:02.520]  your show if the United States does not throw out the progressive income tax
[17:02.520 --> 17:09.000]  and replace it with a fair tax America will implode similar to the Soviet Union
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.840]  it's just a matter of time with that debt approaching 14 trillion we can't
[17:13.840 --> 17:18.880]  satisfy we're nothing more than a managed debt economy nation Congress James
[17:18.880 --> 17:24.000]  traffic and congressman James traffic and I this is powerful information but I
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.720]  also want to get into your persecution why you were persecuted who was behind
[17:27.720 --> 17:31.720]  it was it the Israeli lobby was at the IRS was it a combination we're gonna
[17:31.720 --> 17:36.120]  break that down and how if you can be persecuted like a heretic this can
[17:36.120 --> 17:40.640]  happen to anybody but finishing up with the whole income tax they're raising all
[17:40.640 --> 17:45.240]  these other state taxes local taxes federal taxes everything starting to go
[17:45.240 --> 17:51.800]  bankrupt foreign banks are openly looting us they pulsing and can give
[17:51.800 --> 17:57.360]  $200 million of bailout money to himself and give himself a waiver and then
[17:57.360 --> 18:02.160]  nobody even knows why James traffic and went to jail completely made up same
[18:02.160 --> 18:08.720]  thing with governor in Alabama I mean this is amazing but specifically looking
[18:08.720 --> 18:14.120]  at this how long do you think America has till it completely collapses if this
[18:14.120 --> 18:19.480]  out-of-control government continues I think I would say this I would say we
[18:19.480 --> 18:25.160]  I can't predict the exact time but I will say that I think it is inevitable and I
[18:25.160 --> 18:29.480]  think it will be within the next generation the next 20 25 years where
[18:29.480 --> 18:33.640]  America will implode certain states will move towards saving their own revenue
[18:33.640 --> 18:38.400]  and moving off on their own maybe a compacted state I could see a state like
[18:38.400 --> 18:42.360]  Alaska with their own revenue stream bigger than most of the countries in
[18:42.360 --> 18:46.800]  landbaths over in Europe saying hey we're on our own guys and I could see
[18:46.800 --> 18:51.080]  this starting to happen I think Georgia legislature is advanced in initiative
[18:51.080 --> 18:54.320]  stating that they'll collect the federal tax but they won't send it to
[18:54.320 --> 19:00.200]  Washington yes sir let me just add to Congressman Travacant that that 30 plus
[19:00.200 --> 19:05.120]  states are moving to declare 9th and 10th Amendment powers as you know and the
[19:05.120 --> 19:09.000]  federal government itself has been hijacked by offshore banks and I think
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.480]  it's gonna happen a lot sooner than just 20 years and so Northcom and Homeland
[19:13.480 --> 19:17.000]  Security we got their internal Homeland Security documents a year ago we broke
[19:17.000 --> 19:20.960]  this we got it from law enforcement where Homeland Security internally they
[19:20.960 --> 19:25.040]  train the police this is really to suppress the American people this is
[19:25.040 --> 19:30.400]  not about fighting Arabs and caves no doubt there's a you once I think they
[19:30.400 --> 19:35.880]  headlined it all Americans may expect I hope it doesn't happen but God forbid it
[19:35.880 --> 19:39.520]  does they'll wake up one morning and they'll hear conversation on on your
[19:39.520 --> 19:44.600]  show Alex about the dollar crashing and when that dollar crashes you will see
[19:44.600 --> 19:49.200]  an implosion in America you'll see civil uprisings you will see a massive
[19:49.200 --> 19:53.440]  hemorrhage of the institutions of the United States of America see nobody
[19:53.440 --> 19:57.360]  believes this can happen everybody believes this America this is not going
[19:57.360 --> 20:02.080]  to happen what people are failing to see is a tremendous lose one with the
[20:02.080 --> 20:06.320]  federal government not basically meeting the needs of the American people and
[20:06.320 --> 20:10.880]  having said that you asked me earlier you know what really happened to me you
[20:10.880 --> 20:15.080]  know in 1983 I was the only American in history to defeat the Justice Department
[20:15.080 --> 20:21.200]  a Rico trial pro se without being an attorney I was targeted ever since in
[20:21.200 --> 20:27.200]  the late 80s I was instrumental in bringing back John Demony from Israel
[20:27.200 --> 20:31.240]  who was on trial he was already convicted and sent to be executed no one
[20:31.240 --> 20:36.160]  would look into this man's case I looked into his case and I discovered and I
[20:36.160 --> 20:40.000]  was able to get documents from the Justice Department that not only prove
[20:40.000 --> 20:46.080]  he was innocent Alex but who Ivan the terrible really was it was so blatant
[20:46.080 --> 20:50.480]  in America the pressure that Israel and through their lobby had put on me and
[20:50.480 --> 20:54.120]  put on our government that Congress wouldn't hold a hearing on my evidence
[20:54.120 --> 20:58.000]  and the Sixth Circuit Court in Cincinnati wouldn't accept the trafficking evidence
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.360]  I send it over to the Israeli Supreme Court I did a live interview with Brian
[21:02.360 --> 21:06.920]  Gumbel on today's show by satellite from Jerusalem and I basically said they
[21:06.920 --> 21:11.360]  put this innocent man to death Israel's gonna lose upwards of $20 billion a
[21:11.360 --> 21:14.840]  year for the American taxpayers and Brian Gumbel jumped in he says well what
[21:14.840 --> 21:18.160]  do you mean they only get three billion I said Brian that's only four and eight
[21:18.160 --> 21:22.200]  no one's looking at loans loans converted to grants grants economic
[21:22.200 --> 21:26.880]  assistance military assistance and I am telling you that the American tax
[21:26.880 --> 21:32.200]  payers shipping over $25,000 for every man woman and child in Israel every
[21:32.200 --> 21:36.720]  year well I got a call the following night from the Supreme Court of Israel
[21:36.720 --> 21:40.640]  and they said he'll be in Tel Aviv tomorrow night take him home here's the
[21:40.640 --> 21:45.040]  man on death row Alex but when that happened I had a bullseye on my back
[21:45.040 --> 21:49.720]  like you couldn't believe I had the IRS and the Justice Department already after
[21:49.720 --> 21:54.320]  me and had the most powerful lobby in America a lobby that controls much of
[21:54.320 --> 21:58.800]  the foreign policy United States now I'm being branded a bigot an anti-Semite
[21:58.800 --> 22:02.840]  for saying it but let me tell you something there's only one entity that
[22:02.840 --> 22:06.800]  should control the Congress United States and that's the American people and
[22:06.800 --> 22:11.240]  people won't even whisper the truth about what's going on behind the scenes
[22:11.240 --> 22:16.120]  in Washington the country's in a free fall Alex we're in trouble well I want
[22:16.120 --> 22:20.480]  to continue down this line because you had never been an enemy of Israel you
[22:20.480 --> 22:24.120]  simply defended an innocent man and even the Supreme Court looked at the
[22:24.120 --> 22:29.520]  evidence and let him go and now they've grabbed him again and hold him away I
[22:29.520 --> 22:35.520]  mean it's just a complete and total witch hunt and now you've all these top
[22:35.520 --> 22:39.040]  professors coming out and pointing out that the Israeli lobby and Israeli
[22:39.040 --> 22:43.800]  newspapers brag that they control a lot of Congress and you have Rahm Emanuel
[22:43.800 --> 22:48.160]  in the White House who's an Israeli government agent was in their military
[22:48.160 --> 22:55.000]  in the Gulf War I mean you're only saying what much of the evidence shows and
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.280]  I've always read and experts of history has shown that when you do beat the
[23:00.280 --> 23:04.400]  Justice Department and they win what over 90% of their cases they always come
[23:04.400 --> 23:10.120]  back back back back back back so was it the IRS that you exposed that got them
[23:10.120 --> 23:14.760]  first coming after you and then the icing on the cake was then getting a
[23:14.760 --> 23:18.840]  innocent man freed I think it was a combination of all three but just
[23:18.840 --> 23:23.280]  remember this I was one of the most bitter enemies of the Justice Department
[23:23.280 --> 23:27.440]  the Internal Revenue Service and there's no no kidding about that and I had a
[23:27.440 --> 23:30.600]  struggle it took me 12 years and let me say this I've been a Democrat all my
[23:30.600 --> 23:34.440]  life the Democrats almost had a fist fight with Ross and Towsky Chairman Ross
[23:34.440 --> 23:38.720]  Towsky wouldn't even hold a hearing on my burden of proof legislation we
[23:38.720 --> 23:43.880]  Republican did come in I'll give credit to Bill Archer again there's a man that
[23:43.880 --> 23:47.480]  looked at the American taxpayer and he did something very significant and I
[23:47.480 --> 23:50.360]  want to thank him behalf all Americans I don't even know what happens the old
[23:50.360 --> 23:54.600]  chairman I hope he's still alive down here in Texas he's a great man but
[23:54.600 --> 23:59.160]  Alex I had a bullseye put on my back but quite frankly Scarlett I don't give a
[23:59.160 --> 24:04.040]  damn if you're afraid to speak out about your own country what has happened
[24:04.040 --> 24:08.120]  our Constitution our bill of rights why is everybody afraid to whisper what's
[24:08.120 --> 24:12.640]  going on listen to the strong statement I use on your show even though it is
[24:12.640 --> 24:17.160]  labeled me and hurt me politically Israel has a strangleholding United States
[24:17.160 --> 24:21.040]  of America they have us in foreign wars we shouldn't be involved with that
[24:21.040 --> 24:25.640]  bankrupted us and they've gone so far as having Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
[24:25.640 --> 24:32.480]  Sharon making a statement on Israeli radio October 3 2001 the following we
[24:32.480 --> 24:37.680]  comma the Jewish people comma control America and the Americans know it and
[24:37.680 --> 24:42.960]  never had that in a newspaper in this country no one knows about it so maybe
[24:42.960 --> 24:46.920]  Jim Travken is going to be labeled but I think if we've got a problem let's
[24:46.920 --> 24:50.480]  straighten our country out we don't have to hurt Israel they are a friend
[24:50.480 --> 24:54.840]  they're a democracy within a cluster of monarchs and dictators but we don't
[24:54.840 --> 24:58.560]  have to prosecute their expansion plans we don't have to get involved and be
[24:58.560 --> 25:02.920]  pushed into wars by Israel manipulated by Israel and we shouldn't answer to
[25:02.920 --> 25:08.120]  nobody but the American people well look at Ron Paul I mean he says cut off
[25:08.120 --> 25:11.720]  foreign aid to everybody we are going bankrupt and they call him an anti-
[25:11.720 --> 25:16.000]  semi though he wants to cut it off to Africa he wants to cut it off to Egypt
[25:16.000 --> 25:22.280]  he wants to cut it off to Iraq we can't pay this bill anymore and the fact that
[25:22.280 --> 25:27.120]  whenever somebody says look we need to stop being involved in all these wars
[25:27.120 --> 25:31.560]  we need to stop doing this and the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center come out
[25:31.560 --> 25:35.880]  and attack me when I am am mild on this because I'm just trying to bring
[25:35.880 --> 25:39.440]  everybody together to audit the Fed to get the fellow reserve out of here to
[25:39.440 --> 25:43.760]  get the 17th Amendment overturned to get rid of the income tax there's no doubt
[25:43.760 --> 25:49.760]  you get savaged when you even mildly criticize so I can't imagine what it's
[25:49.760 --> 25:52.280]  been like for you let's let's briefly is we're going to break her in about four
[25:52.280 --> 25:57.240]  minutes talk about what happened to you in prison because I mean you're a tough
[25:57.240 --> 26:01.400]  guy you're not whining about it on air now but they treated you like hell I saw
[26:01.400 --> 26:06.480]  on the news Alex the first place I went was 50% illegal immigrants and keep this
[26:06.480 --> 26:10.080]  in mind for the people of Texas specifically Jim Travagan was a
[26:10.080 --> 26:14.960]  congressman who passed on the House floor utilizing our soldiers on our
[26:14.960 --> 26:19.240]  border you know regarding the borders in the Middle East regarding borders all
[26:19.240 --> 26:23.120]  over the world our troops are going for lunch over in Italy and going for the
[26:23.120 --> 26:27.280]  theater in Germany and our borders are wide open the I'm very I was labeled a
[26:27.280 --> 26:31.440]  bigot because here's my position on immigration Alex number one let's put
[26:31.440 --> 26:34.720]  our troops on the border it's a national security check line and if you're in
[26:34.720 --> 26:38.680]  America illegally should be thrown the hell out not given health care and given
[26:38.680 --> 26:42.800]  a false well that's what Mexico does to us Mexico treats American citizens like
[26:42.800 --> 26:47.200]  trash and shakes them down hey listen I'm here's why I feel if you're an American
[26:47.200 --> 26:50.480]  citizen I don't care what ethnic group you are you're one of us but if you're
[26:50.480 --> 26:54.000]  not you got to be thrown the hell out of here now both these parties are
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.840]  catering to a growing minority Hispanic vote is getting larger in America is
[26:58.840 --> 27:02.360]  larger than the black vote and both these parties are giving them everything
[27:02.360 --> 27:06.000]  they want meanwhile you got a health care system out of control you got
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.960]  approximately 15 million troops being only illegal immigrants consuming
[27:09.960 --> 27:14.880]  welfare and different programs in this country with falsified documents and no
[27:14.880 --> 27:18.320]  one's neither party's dealing with it congressman let me stop you I got a guy
[27:18.320 --> 27:21.720]  that worked at Austin Energy here and I already knew this it's 800 plus
[27:21.720 --> 27:25.960]  sanctuary cities but the illegals get a fake consulate matricula they pay a
[27:25.960 --> 27:31.640]  $200 down payment or 250 depending on the size of the contract to to get their
[27:31.640 --> 27:35.440]  power and light turned on then they never pay the bill he said over 90% of
[27:35.440 --> 27:38.840]  the time and then a new matricula comes up in six months when they turn the power
[27:38.840 --> 27:44.880]  off and they were told in Austin Energy meetings let them not pay and it's the
[27:44.880 --> 27:49.720]  same thing drunk drivers they get let go everything but citizens are scum and
[27:49.720 --> 27:54.040]  trash and so the average illegals on three or four different welfare lines
[27:54.040 --> 27:58.520]  Alex it's so out of hand that it's a joke and it takes me to the national
[27:58.520 --> 28:02.400]  health care bill my god the American needs a health care bill but there's
[28:02.400 --> 28:06.160]  there's deserving people need some assistance but you've got about 15
[28:06.160 --> 28:08.880]  million illegal immigrants are going to be involved in this thing and American
[28:08.880 --> 28:12.400]  people are bankrupted we've already destroyed companies and thrown them out
[28:12.400 --> 28:16.480]  it's driven them away we're gonna destroy more I don't think there's any
[28:16.480 --> 28:21.560]  common sense right now in Washington and I think Washington is manipulated and
[28:21.560 --> 28:25.960]  Washington is obstructed by outside forces and being very much manipulated
[28:25.960 --> 28:29.360]  but having said that let me get back to the prison the first place I went to
[28:29.360 --> 28:33.200]  Alex at 50% illegal immigrants and they knew that I was a guy that said throw
[28:33.200 --> 28:37.760]  them the hell out I slept with one eye open the next thing you know I'm at a
[28:37.760 --> 28:41.880]  medium-high which was known as gladiator school up in Raybrook people getting
[28:41.880 --> 28:46.680]  cut and hurt every particular day there was a counselor in the system I won't
[28:46.680 --> 28:50.520]  say where they told me when I first went in he said listen my mother's your
[28:50.520 --> 28:54.360]  biggest fan be careful they want you to get hurt the next thing you know I'm at
[28:54.360 --> 28:58.440]  a medium-high and the truth be known one more little infraction I'd be in a
[28:58.440 --> 29:03.960]  penitentiary a penitentiary and the reason I end up in Rochester they told
[29:03.960 --> 29:09.360]  me that I had a corkscrew aorta and they told me had his corkscrew aorta and I
[29:09.360 --> 29:13.600]  would not take medication Alex because I didn't trust them and I end up in
[29:13.600 --> 29:19.640]  Rochester and then they said I didn't have a corkscrew aorta just let me tell
[29:19.640 --> 29:23.040]  you something I believe that our government was hoping I would have died
[29:23.040 --> 29:29.520]  in prison and would not have come out okay we got a break come back right

[34:37.920 --> 34:47.360]  Poland like the country 429 North Main Street Poland Ohio 44514 so here's the
[34:47.360 --> 34:56.000]  address again 429 North Main Street Poland Ohio 44514 and I've studied his
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.880]  case I've also studied Governor Don Siegelman's case and back of the time
[35:00.880 --> 35:04.360]  when I railroaded him we looked at him so this is completely staged turned out the
[35:04.360 --> 35:08.600]  US prosecutors at work for Carl Rove he ordered it they've testified to this now
[35:08.600 --> 35:12.880]  get him they they kept coming after him investigation after investigation all
[35:12.880 --> 35:17.600]  made up lying then they threatened to indict one of his employees for
[35:17.600 --> 35:21.080]  something totally separate outside the Capitol and said lie about him we won't
[35:21.080 --> 35:26.240]  send you to prison basically same thing happened to Mr. traffic ant Don Siegelman
[35:26.240 --> 35:29.160]  now he got out after nine months and has been vindicated and it's admitted it was
[35:29.160 --> 35:33.760]  a fraud he was going to serve a decade not with traffic ant he was there seven
[35:33.760 --> 35:37.000]  and a half years and they told him and he'll talk about this in a moment any
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.480]  time you say you're guilty we'll let you go now so first they try to pull some
[35:42.480 --> 35:47.320]  medical scams on him they put him in with the illegal aliens they put him in
[35:47.320 --> 35:52.120]  to gladiator school medium maximum security high security continue
[35:52.120 --> 35:56.360]  congressman traffic ant with what happened to you in prison well at some
[35:56.360 --> 35:59.960]  particular point you know you made the statement that you have to stand on your
[35:59.960 --> 36:04.480]  own two feet you have to be prepared for almost anything and I had an awful lot
[36:04.480 --> 36:10.520]  of enemies in the prison system and I didn't know exactly who or how someone
[36:10.520 --> 36:14.360]  might come at you so you're you sleep with one eye open helix but the bottom
[36:14.360 --> 36:19.520]  line was that I not only did that that I I developed what I consider to be a
[36:19.520 --> 36:22.880]  firm resolve and one thing Nelson Mandela said you never really know a
[36:22.880 --> 36:26.440]  country unless you go through their prison system and that's one thing he was
[36:26.440 --> 36:29.920]  exactly right about you see the other side of the United States of America
[36:29.920 --> 36:35.320]  we've got such crippling problems but I survived I was not afraid to survive I
[36:35.320 --> 36:39.400]  told them where they could shove that pardon because I certainly wasn't
[36:39.400 --> 36:43.120]  going to admit to something that I didn't do but but very few people know is
[36:43.120 --> 36:48.960]  that the before that trial the northern district court federal court system of
[36:48.960 --> 36:53.160]  Ohio passed a rule if you got a judge from a particular area you got a jury
[36:53.160 --> 36:57.560]  from that area and it would become the trafficking rule because basically
[36:57.560 --> 37:02.000]  nobody in my congressional district was eligible to serve on my jury second of
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.920]  all the judge made my witnesses testify in open court under the threat of
[37:07.920 --> 37:13.880]  perjury to her outside the presence of a jury and they told her the truth no one
[37:13.880 --> 37:18.760]  was charged for perjury but she did not allow them to testify to the jury and
[37:18.760 --> 37:22.680]  four of those people said that of the seven people who testified against me
[37:22.680 --> 37:27.680]  they had admitted to somebody close or whomever who had kind of confided in me
[37:27.680 --> 37:31.560]  that they lied so they wouldn't go to prison himself or have their wife
[37:31.560 --> 37:37.160]  indicted or their kids indicted or their company taken away etc etc four of
[37:37.160 --> 37:41.760]  the seven she didn't allow it to go to the jury now we find out after the trial
[37:41.760 --> 37:46.160]  was over and one of the key witnesses against me who was perjured himself in
[37:46.160 --> 37:50.440]  my trial because he was caught perjuring himself in a previous trial that the
[37:50.440 --> 37:55.280]  judge's husband had a relationship business-wise with that family I mean
[37:55.280 --> 38:00.360]  this thing it was so abusive that it speaks up but when you're the number
[38:00.360 --> 38:04.200]  one target of the Justice Department the number one target of the American
[38:04.200 --> 38:08.560]  Israeli Public Affairs Committee Alex you have nowhere to turn you've got to
[38:08.560 --> 38:13.040]  stand on your own two feet and hopefully outlive it and come back and try and do
[38:13.040 --> 38:17.560]  what you can about it now congressman let's break this down though the type of
[38:17.560 --> 38:22.120]  threats you got when you were in Congress but but and how you got set up
[38:22.120 --> 38:27.720]  there's this crisis of confidence now because police all over the country in
[38:27.720 --> 38:32.280]  every major city of Texas just as an example have been caught planting drugs
[38:32.280 --> 38:36.560]  on people to take their property it's now standard procedure they admit they
[38:36.560 --> 38:41.640]  have been formats lie on the stand about political enemies they have I mean they
[38:41.640 --> 38:46.800]  can put anybody they want in prison but the public now knows it's a fraud it's
[38:46.800 --> 38:50.760]  like the death penalty I'm for the death penalty at a grassroots level if they
[38:50.760 --> 38:54.400]  catch somebody who's murdered a kid the problem is more than a third of those on
[38:54.400 --> 38:58.760]  death row has been proven with DNA or totally innocent we know that the system
[38:58.760 --> 39:04.320]  is so corrupt you can't trust anything they say or do so but briefly because I
[39:04.320 --> 39:08.400]  remember seeing it in the news the hell in the seven and a half years I know as
[39:08.400 --> 39:11.080]  a man you don't like to talk about what happened to you you just want to be tough
[39:11.080 --> 39:15.680]  and ignore it but people need to know the type of persecution I mean tell us more
[39:15.680 --> 39:20.640]  what happened in prison well you you're under a constant threat with me I did
[39:20.640 --> 39:26.760]  the months and months after end in the hole in isolation because they said my
[39:26.760 --> 39:31.280]  attitude but basically they were trying to break me and I survived all that time
[39:31.280 --> 39:35.360]  in prison I never even acknowledged the presence of any of the wardens I couldn't
[39:35.360 --> 39:40.120]  tell you their names I just kept them I let's go back over this so explain it
[39:40.120 --> 39:44.920]  they said some little punk jail guard some sadist has this congressman this
[39:44.920 --> 39:48.760]  icon and and and they're telling you I don't like your attitude boy you're
[39:48.760 --> 39:53.000]  gonna spend how long in the hole well they find out they find out or you use
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.400]  little little maneuvers that they have but I believe I spent close to seven
[39:57.400 --> 40:02.480]  months in the hole over a period of time and that's in the hole means that you
[40:02.480 --> 40:07.080]  get it get a shower every second day three times a week you get to go out one
[40:07.080 --> 40:10.920]  day or one hour a day and I tell you truth Alex I never left the place I
[40:10.920 --> 40:15.120]  you I would I became very hard and I think that they looked at me and they
[40:15.120 --> 40:19.080]  said this guy is very hard because I didn't give a damn about anything I
[40:19.080 --> 40:24.000]  forfeit my life if I survived I'd do what I had to do but I wasn't going to
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.840]  buckle down I wasn't going to be intimidated stood my ground did what I
[40:27.840 --> 40:32.080]  had to do but like I said I could have had a part but there's no way I was
[40:32.080 --> 40:35.040]  going to make admissions is something that I did to do and I want all your
[40:35.040 --> 40:38.880]  listeners to listen to this very carefully six year investigation 15
[40:38.880 --> 40:45.240]  million dollars over 250 agents and they said they didn't make any tapes on Jim
[40:45.240 --> 40:49.480]  Trafficking didn't bug my telephone now a secret service agent has come out
[40:49.480 --> 40:53.400]  retired Mike Robertson and made the following statement he said Trafficking
[40:53.400 --> 40:56.840]  was certainly railroaded he said they had no physical evidence he said they
[40:56.840 --> 41:00.440]  bugged that guy to death they had people go to him with body Mike he said
[41:00.440 --> 41:03.720]  anybody in their right mind knows that he said the reason the government
[41:03.720 --> 41:07.320]  voluntarily made that admission in court is because Trafficking could have
[41:07.320 --> 41:13.160]  subpoenaed all of their tapes and said where's the crime I want your listeners
[41:13.160 --> 41:18.240]  to remember this they said they made no tapes didn't bug my telephone or
[41:18.240 --> 41:22.640]  anything for six years now if you believe that I got some property down in
[41:22.640 --> 41:26.320]  Florida I think somebody wants to tell you well sir you've been vindicated and
[41:26.320 --> 41:29.480]  that's all over the press I mean you have officially been vindicated like
[41:29.480 --> 41:33.160]  governor Siegelman but he only got nine months you got seven and a half years
[41:33.160 --> 41:37.720]  and got financially ruined how are you gonna come back at them I mean are you
[41:37.720 --> 41:40.920]  now have the secret service agent you have all these other witnesses against
[41:40.920 --> 41:45.120]  you recanting that it was done under pressure you've got to get on the attack
[41:45.120 --> 41:50.000]  in in in my estimation or correct me if I'm wrong or they're gonna try to set you
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.000]  up again here's where we are Alex right now there's a man in Washington DC that
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.180]  was pressured to lie against me he's a brilliant man Richard Detour he could
[41:59.180 --> 42:03.080]  fly any aircraft and he's a brilliant engineer and the government wanted him
[42:03.080 --> 42:06.720]  to be a witness against me because he was very intelligent very credible and
[42:06.720 --> 42:10.800]  they wanted him to say that he saw a business man give me an envelope with
[42:10.800 --> 42:15.640]  money thousand dollars in my office and he basically said I won't do that I know
[42:15.640 --> 42:19.440]  Jim if he's done something wrong go after him but I'm not gonna lie they come
[42:19.440 --> 42:22.800]  back to him later and they pressured him to say that he was standing outside the
[42:22.800 --> 42:27.320]  door and he heard the transaction he said I just won't do it now his attorney
[42:27.320 --> 42:30.840]  that he had was a former US attorney who was pressuring him along with the
[42:30.840 --> 42:35.080]  government so he fired that attorney and they indicted him to keep him out of my
[42:35.080 --> 42:40.920]  case the bottom line is here's how here's how egregious it was when they
[42:40.920 --> 42:45.800]  brought the witness to testify against me in trial he stated that he gave me the
[42:45.800 --> 42:51.280]  money in an automobile in Youngstown Ohio but the government it clearly on record
[42:51.280 --> 42:56.240]  now clearly on record is trying to pressure Richard Detour to say that he
[42:56.240 --> 43:00.320]  saw the transaction in my office and it was the prosecutor who was doing this by
[43:00.320 --> 43:04.080]  the way the prosecutor is now working for some insurance company in Columbus
[43:04.080 --> 43:08.760]  Ohio and everybody's scared to death of what happened because they know I'm not
[43:08.760 --> 43:12.280]  as afraid to speak my mind well let's stop there for a second former
[43:12.280 --> 43:16.320]  congressman James Travacant I'm sure you're aware of Don Siegelman's case
[43:16.320 --> 43:21.080]  it's even 60 minutes reported it was all a stage deal the majority of these
[43:21.080 --> 43:24.600]  former state attorneys US attorneys came out and said it was a fraud a bunch of
[43:24.600 --> 43:28.480]  Republicans came to his aid even though he's a Democrat they it's now admitted
[43:28.480 --> 43:35.280]  ordered one of his aides to lie and say he saw the check the same thing and it
[43:35.280 --> 43:40.120]  turned out that was a complete lie so this is and and it's now been confirmed
[43:40.120 --> 43:45.460]  Carl Rove ordered this I mean do you know specifically in the US attorney's
[43:45.460 --> 43:49.920]  office who gave the orders to set you up yes I do I don't know who exactly did
[43:49.920 --> 43:54.240]  it but it was supervised by Michael Chertoff who they rewarded him they
[43:54.240 --> 43:58.400]  came head of Homeland Security over and they made the prosecutor my case number
[43:58.400 --> 44:02.120]  two man in the Justice Department right underneath Gonzalez he was deputy
[44:02.120 --> 44:07.040]  Attorney General there until this thing hit with a fellow in Nigeria and now the
[44:07.040 --> 44:10.200]  fellow in Washington DC who spent a million and a half dollars he was
[44:10.200 --> 44:15.600]  acquitted in about about 45 minutes because his attorney called him and
[44:15.600 --> 44:19.960]  pressured him his own attorney trying to encourage him to lie for the US
[44:19.960 --> 44:25.000]  government against me and what he did is he had a retired Navy captain who
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.320]  worked with him listening on the other end of the phone and he did then went
[44:29.320 --> 44:32.800]  ahead and did an affidavit if you read the affidavit you'd get sick to your
[44:32.800 --> 44:37.320]  stomach Alex terms like this there's no reward for honesty Richard they're
[44:37.320 --> 44:41.400]  gonna get this guy why throw yourself in the mix you didn't do anything though I
[44:41.400 --> 44:44.440]  have to invite you or do something to you so just go ahead and tell them what
[44:44.440 --> 44:47.160]  they want to hear they're gonna get trafficking just go ahead and do what
[44:47.160 --> 44:53.280]  they want Richard this is what I'm up against now let me tell you what here's
[44:53.280 --> 44:57.520]  the difference between me and single man 60 minutes come in and did a story on
[44:57.520 --> 45:01.040]  single man I'm gonna tell it right the way it is when you're the number one
[45:01.040 --> 45:04.760]  target of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee 60 minutes don't have
[45:04.760 --> 45:09.560]  anything good to say about you now that's putting it that's putting a hey
[45:09.560 --> 45:14.040]  where the goats can reach it Alex well let's talk more about that were you
[45:14.040 --> 45:18.680]  warned when you I didn't have this powerful Jewish animus against me I
[45:18.680 --> 45:22.840]  think I'd be a very rich man for what they did but I'm still the top target of
[45:22.840 --> 45:26.400]  Israel quite frankly I think they're delaying that trial over there in
[45:26.400 --> 45:30.640]  Germany because they do not want me to testify over there in Germany they're
[45:30.640 --> 45:35.840]  hoping that old man will die in Germany well let's expand let's expand on this
[45:35.840 --> 45:41.280]  Israel situation let's go through from the start when did you first get on the
[45:41.280 --> 45:46.160]  Israeli lobbies radar were their back channel threats to you in Congress you
[45:46.160 --> 45:49.680]  know did they warn you to back off first what happened well first of all right
[45:49.680 --> 45:54.360]  when I was running they tried to get me ten thousand dollars cash and I told you
[45:54.360 --> 45:57.280]  keep your money and I'll keep my vote so I think I was targeted before I ever
[45:57.280 --> 46:01.560]  walked down there second of all I tried to cut four and eight every year for
[46:01.560 --> 46:05.280]  everybody I was asked a couple times exempt Israel and I said I wouldn't do
[46:05.280 --> 46:08.800]  that and I never could pass any cut I worked hard to try and you know we have
[46:08.800 --> 46:12.080]  people sleeping are still great and we're sending money overseas don't make
[46:12.080 --> 46:17.640]  much sense to me but finally it became that deminucate I was called a Nazi
[46:17.640 --> 46:23.520]  supporter I suffered great how did you get involved in the case they came to me
[46:23.520 --> 46:26.480]  Alex because they knew they were from Cleveland they knew the government hated
[46:26.480 --> 46:31.520]  me and they came to me last they said no one would even talk with them in fact
[46:31.520 --> 46:36.640]  that I was in my office overhearing the conversation outside and they said we
[46:36.640 --> 46:40.920]  come to Jim last because no one will talk to us and we didn't want to come to
[46:40.920 --> 46:44.280]  Jim we know the government hates them but we have no one to look into our
[46:44.280 --> 46:48.800]  plate and he says you know and I never forget the son I heard the son say look
[46:48.800 --> 46:52.480]  I never had a speeding ticket I can't talk to an elected representative my
[46:52.480 --> 46:55.840]  father's not asking to talk to him I'm asking what the hell's going on here I
[46:55.840 --> 47:02.400]  said send that young man into me when I did that Alex my staff told me almost
[47:02.400 --> 47:08.760]  verbatim if you get involved in this case you are finished as a congressman
[47:08.760 --> 47:13.560]  you're already on the hit list for your cutting foreign aid you get involved
[47:13.560 --> 47:16.880]  with this case now with the newspaper didn't print they all printed traffic
[47:16.880 --> 47:21.440]  and supports Nazi mass murderer what they didn't print was that I told the
[47:21.440 --> 47:24.880]  family when they come in I said look your father's been convicted of mass
[47:24.880 --> 47:28.880]  murder if he's guilty I could truly go over and pull the switch but I believe
[47:28.880 --> 47:33.880]  you should be able at least take your case to somebody in government and it
[47:33.880 --> 47:37.440]  should have been your own congressman your own senators they said no one would
[47:37.440 --> 47:42.000]  talk to them I got involved and what I found out Alex that he was not Ivan well
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.440]  let me stop you let me stop you think about this you're a congressman this
[47:46.440 --> 47:50.240]  guy is supposedly a kangaroo court convicted Nazi and of course the
[47:50.240 --> 47:54.880]  Supreme Court Israel said actually it's the wrong guy it agreed with you so why
[47:54.880 --> 47:57.680]  would you get into something this dangerous unless you had a sense of
[47:57.680 --> 48:02.960]  justice so you began to look at the case what was there well I started to get I
[48:02.960 --> 48:07.960]  was known in in Congress for for taking a look at things objectively and people
[48:07.960 --> 48:11.240]  were not afraid to confide in me before long I started to get whistleblower
[48:11.240 --> 48:15.160]  activity and the whistleblower type of things I got to let me to certain
[48:15.160 --> 48:19.600]  conclusions and I moved with a freedom of information act request on Dominic and
[48:19.600 --> 48:24.240]  they just kept throwing it in file 13 and saying classified classified classified
[48:24.240 --> 48:28.760]  and what they did is basically trick them Alex there was I started to look
[48:28.760 --> 48:33.320]  around and I researched was there ever anybody tried for war crimes who was
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.280]  located at that Treblinka polling concentration camp and there was a man
[48:37.280 --> 48:42.320]  from Chicago a Ukrainian who ended up coming to Chicago area by name of
[48:42.320 --> 48:47.240]  Fedor Fedorenko he was tried for war crimes in America at Treblinka and was
[48:47.240 --> 48:51.120]  acquitted in America Alex he then went to visit his family in the Ukraine
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.120]  relieved of all the pressure it was picked up by the KGB tried over there
[48:55.120 --> 48:59.440]  and executed what I did is I submitted the Freedom of Information Act request on
[48:59.440 --> 49:03.880]  Fedorenko and with that I got documents from the State Department and he looked
[49:03.880 --> 49:08.560]  just like the other guy yeah well no I got the documents I got from the State
[49:08.560 --> 49:13.280]  Department was there was in response to a request for information from one of our
[49:13.280 --> 49:19.600]  agents just part agents over in in Germany years ago maybe 25 years ago and it
[49:19.600 --> 49:23.320]  had on the bottom Alex it said they had another hundred pages in the file I
[49:23.320 --> 49:28.720]  immediately got on the phone and I called and got a Mrs. Poindexter because
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.480]  they took all my files and everything and I said this man's been dead for a
[49:32.480 --> 49:37.160]  number of years it's not classified I want those 100 pages and that woman sent
[49:37.160 --> 49:42.080]  them to me and Alex when it come over it had testimony of trials of everybody
[49:42.080 --> 49:46.920]  who identified Ivan the terrible as a man named Ivan Marchenko but the big
[49:46.920 --> 49:51.120]  thing was there was a photograph in there of two Nazis and the guy identified
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.200]  the the photograph as follows he said the small man on the right is Prakchuk
[49:55.200 --> 50:00.720]  with the pistol the tall man on the left is Ivan Grosny the man the Jewish
[50:00.720 --> 50:04.920]  prisoner's fears the most Ivan Marchenko now I had this and I went on a
[50:04.920 --> 50:10.640]  house floor and I said Ivan the terrible is a man named Ivan Marchenko and
[50:10.640 --> 50:13.360]  when you ever hear the Justice Department make a response that night they
[50:13.360 --> 50:17.640]  put out a press release his name is even Ivan and and the only thing is he
[50:17.640 --> 50:22.240]  looked a little similar to the guy living in Ohio not really you hear this
[50:22.240 --> 50:28.680]  the Justice Department when public and said there were two Ivan now you know
[50:28.680 --> 50:31.960]  what I said is that you sure it wasn't a swing ship and then I showed the
[50:31.960 --> 50:36.960]  photograph what that happened everything went underground the Justice
[50:36.960 --> 50:41.320]  Department shut up next thing you know I'm over in Israel and I think it became
[50:41.320 --> 50:44.120]  a real issue I got to give credit to Israeli Supreme Court
[50:44.120 --> 50:47.920]  Israeli Supreme Court looked at the evidence that take this man home but
[50:47.920 --> 50:52.080]  but see that's the issue is the Israeli Supreme Court says he's innocent you
[50:52.080 --> 50:56.160]  have the secret files it proves it meanwhile the American Israeli groups

[52:13.360 --> 52:17.320]  underneath the Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence on our
[52:17.320 --> 52:21.560]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[52:21.560 --> 52:26.800]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the
[52:26.800 --> 52:31.320]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[52:43.400 --> 52:48.960]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[54:22.460 --> 54:25.700]  under five minutes in the next hour and he says he wants to come back we really
[54:25.700 --> 54:29.680]  appreciate his courage I've studied him I've looked at what he's done I looked
[54:29.680 --> 54:32.280]  at why he took the case of the supposed camp guard
[54:32.280 --> 54:35.520]  turnout was just all lies and the government knows that the Israeli
[54:35.520 --> 54:41.600]  Supreme Court ruled that why did the Israelis tell the truth about this but
[54:41.600 --> 54:45.480]  then in America the Israeli lobby came after you is it two different groups or
[54:45.480 --> 54:48.720]  one different group or what I mean you were telling me during the break you
[54:48.720 --> 54:51.400]  think this is all gonna hurt Israel and that's not what you want
[54:51.400 --> 54:56.240]  no absolutely not I think I think I've been branded as anti-Semite quite
[54:56.240 --> 55:00.680]  frankly I am a sport of Israel a sport of Israel when they're doing what's
[55:00.680 --> 55:04.200]  right when they do something wrong I'm not going to be remiss here and not
[55:04.200 --> 55:08.320]  mention it I believe that they have undue control of our government but I'd like
[55:08.320 --> 55:13.640]  to say this to start with Israeli Supreme Court gave a lesson in justice
[55:13.640 --> 55:17.960]  the United States of America this is the most controversial case perhaps in
[55:17.960 --> 55:22.440]  Israeli history one of them and they looked at the evidence Alex and they
[55:22.440 --> 55:27.920]  said take him home now what everybody doesn't know Alex is that our government
[55:27.920 --> 55:33.040]  went back and wanted Israel to prosecute Dominic again on this other charge and
[55:33.040 --> 55:39.040]  the Israeli Supreme Court would not allow it so let's give kudos where it's
[55:39.040 --> 55:43.880]  due to give it to Israel and their Supreme Court okay so then so then how
[55:43.880 --> 55:47.280]  does the Supreme Court of Israel agree with you and the government files that
[55:47.280 --> 55:53.000]  prove it a hundred percent why is a pack putting you in prison well I think it's
[55:53.000 --> 55:58.480]  once you're targeted and they fired a woman in 1990 or 1991 I don't know if
[55:58.480 --> 56:02.560]  you remember this Alex a top-ranking woman
[56:05.680 --> 56:09.800]  politicians they wanted to get rid of it Jim Travlin was the number one target
[56:09.800 --> 56:14.600]  in the world and I think it was because the way I handle that case no one would
[56:14.600 --> 56:19.120]  help me and I went to the house floor and I dramatically presented the case on
[56:19.120 --> 56:24.240]  behalf of Dominic and his family and I believe that I riled up many many of
[56:24.240 --> 56:27.800]  the people whether they felt that just the fact that I looked into this case
[56:27.800 --> 56:31.280]  that no one should look into it I had to have some and I said my blood this is
[56:31.280 --> 56:35.720]  what they said and now Germany's hold this guy off is on the death's doorstep
[56:35.720 --> 56:40.600]  yeah I think they're they're holding and delaying this because I I'm firmly
[56:40.600 --> 56:45.120]  believe that they do not want me over in Germany to speak out on this issue I
[56:45.120 --> 56:48.880]  think they're holding this case up holding that the old man will die over
[56:48.880 --> 56:54.840]  there what a shame he was not guilty Alex bottom line and let me say this when
[56:54.840 --> 57:00.000]  you allow one citizens right to be trampled you endanger the rights of all
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.400]  Americans what the hell is wrong with us what have we come to what have we
[57:04.400 --> 57:08.320]  turned into here Alex well that's why I support you because I mean I looked at
[57:08.320 --> 57:12.480]  the facts and you've been persecuted a lot worse than Siegelman and he's he's
[57:12.480 --> 57:17.040]  been vindicated you've been vindicated as well but not what comes next I mean
[57:17.040 --> 57:20.680]  how do you go after these guys do you sue people do you call for new
[57:20.680 --> 57:24.440]  investigations what do you do I really don't have any strength to do that but
[57:24.440 --> 57:28.440]  this fellow in Washington DC this Richard Detour may file suit if he does I
[57:28.440 --> 57:33.080]  will then back up into that suit as well and it's going to be a long hard
[57:33.080 --> 57:37.320]  struggle but I think that there's so many revelations to do that it's going to
[57:37.320 --> 57:41.480]  surprise an awful lot of people but right now I'm looking politically I'm
[57:41.480 --> 57:44.880]  looking at politically not just for vengeance but looking politically
[57:44.880 --> 57:48.680]  because I think America needs somebody to speak out on what the hell is going
[57:48.680 --> 57:52.760]  wrong who's not afraid to speak out who's not controlled by their party I
[57:52.760 --> 57:56.120]  think too many of the politicians today have allegiance to the party
[57:56.120 --> 57:59.040]  allegiance to be should be American and so you're planning to run as an
[57:59.040 --> 58:02.520]  independent give us the battle right independent and it's the Democrat area
[58:02.520 --> 58:06.520]  my chances aren't great I'll be quite honest as an independent but I just don't
[58:06.520 --> 58:11.080]  see I can't see anybody following Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid in the battle and
[58:11.080 --> 58:18.160]  Bobby damn beam me up if I'm going to be involved in that party but but I mean
[58:18.160 --> 58:22.480]  why not use the machinery like Ron Paul does and use their machinery you would
[58:22.480 --> 58:28.200]  still be an independent it would be impossible for me to do that I would be
[58:28.200 --> 58:33.560]  so so castigated here I have to basically run as an independent the
[58:33.560 --> 58:38.680]  hypocritical for me to run now as anemic that with the position that okay we
[58:38.680 --> 58:45.680]  got a break one minute sir stay there thank you for listening to GCN be sure

[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.760]  ruin this man's life and this was a capital offense it can be put to death
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:05.520]  Alex it wasn't about how they withheld evidence about how they violated
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:10.160]  civil rights it was how did traffic and get this information imagine that folks
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.160]  I mean it's unbelievable that some of the things you hear so I just worked
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:19.480]  very hard I just put my nose to the grindstone and kept going and that's
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.200]  about it that's all you can do Alex but I'll tell you something we've got a real
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.200]  problem no one should fear our government the government if anybody
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.240]  they should be fearing that American people American people are the government
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.680]  and we've got this thing so complicated messed up it's really a crying shame and
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:42.560]  it's got to be changed we also need to thank your wife and all of this Patricia
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.440]  traffic and she stood beside you you stood beside her and for better and
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:53.000]  worse and people if they do write checks to try to get you guys back on your
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.320]  feet to the address they need to address those you were telling me to
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:05.480]  Patricia traffic can't 429 North Main Street Poland Ohio 44514
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:10.640]  congressman we've got about three minutes left and you were gonna give me a
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.560]  liner for the show about you know you know Alex I've gotten volumes of mail
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.120]  all through the seven-and-a-half years and one of the reasons I got them is
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.600]  people followed my little one-minute speeches and I just didn't do them the
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:26.200]  grandstand I made salient points during that time and dramatized things that I
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.360]  think had to be made but I became known for the for the statement being me up
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.600]  and basically I just said being me up because there's no intelligent life here
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:40.640]  is what I'd like to say to the Alex Jones show you don't need to be being
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.720]  tough Jim trafficking doesn't need to be being tough on Alex Jones show because
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.720]  there is an intelligent audience there and there is a message coming out that
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:54.800]  educating that audience and believe me when I say this if more people were
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.680]  listening to Alex and could listen to Alex I think you see a direct and
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:03.280]  intended change that somebody's misdirected policies that are coming out of
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.680]  Washington so misdirected and absurd if you threw them at the ground they
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:11.920]  probably miss so there's no need to be me up here in Austin Texas intelligent
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.840]  life in Austin Texas and before I leave again I want to say I don't know what
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.960]  happened to Chairman Archer Bill Archer but Alex I want you to run him down I
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:25.240]  want you to find him and I want you to say that Jim traffic and said thank you
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:30.040]  on behalf of the American people absolutely we've got about a minute
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.840]  left here what's the time frame for the election for people to start getting

[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:56.680]  entity of anything and it's an uphill struggle but you know what I'm I'm I've
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:02.440]  had it and maybe get back to where we started well the first thing we need

[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.520]  courage and we're all praying for you and we're glad they weren't able to kill

[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:55.200]  think they need to hear a rational voice like yours so thanks for having me Alex

[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.000]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.040]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:25.440]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.320]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.680]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:42.400]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.960]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:14.400]  are live now eight minutes into the second hour on this 25th day of
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:21.440]  February 2010 it is Thursday websites are info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:27.080]  the rest of the hour we are joined by attorney Philip J. Berg a former deputy
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.080]  attorney general of Pennsylvania former candidate for governor of the US Senate
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.720]  in Democratic primaries former chair of the Democratic Party of Montgomery
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.520]  County former member the Democratic State Committee an attorney with offices in
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:43.800]  Montgomery County PA an active practice in Philadelphia PA Phil is a paid live
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:49.800]  member of the NAACP and voluntary fire police for 27 years his website is
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:55.880]  obamacrimes.com and we've had Jerome Corsi on about this day one a year and
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.160]  a half ago two years ago now but the first person to really research this
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:04.760]  because he was concerned about it back when it was in the Democratic primaries
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.800]  I guess almost two years ago or two years ago yeah almost two years ago was
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.960]  Phil Berg and he just asked the question I mean we know this guy's name was Barry
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.480]  Sitaro we know he lived in foreign countries we know he went to madrasas
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.040]  we're not saying that's a bad thing to go to madrasas the point is the media
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:25.800]  would say it's a wild conspiracy theory his name wasn't Barry Sitaro then they
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.880]  sealed all his records know his name was Barry Sitaro that's now admitted the
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:33.920]  point is they're lying about things that are admitted then we got a certificate
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:37.720]  of a birth certificate but more and more and this is what I've always focused
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:45.800]  on it's the fake names and it's being adopted in Indonesia because there's
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:51.080]  only a few countries like England and Israel and a few others where you can
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:57.280]  have dual citizenship and still be allowed to be a US citizen much less
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:06.000]  the president and now Glenn Beck is attacking Berg every week and again I'm
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.360]  tired of going after Glenn Beck it's just he was in the news saying global
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:15.080]  warming was real in USA today Sunday on the weekend edition I've seen he put
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.920]  Phil Berg next to Van Jones and then next to Debra Medina and say all these
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:27.840]  people are bad I mean just incredible behavior so that tells me they're
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.600]  desperate if now mainline talk show host not just Beck but other big
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:38.760]  Republicans are attacking Phil Berg in my experience Phil Berg somebody who
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.800]  wants the truth yes he called for an investigation of 9-11 in the deadly dust
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.600]  just like six of the 10 commissioner members did so he gets demonized for
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:51.000]  that and they say oh well he was supporting Hillary's why he did this
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.480]  this is back no he did this because he was concerned with the Democratic Party
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:05.640]  he's a Democrat and I now from the preponderance of evidence it it's 6040
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.840]  it's leaning towards him really not being eligible and then you get into the
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:11.880]  math of it and I know there's big new developments but I want Phil for new
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.600]  listeners and people that aren't really understanding this I've just seen the
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.400]  media's kind of boil down deceptive boil down of what's happening and who
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:25.520]  birthers are to talk to the father of the birther movement and you'll wreak recap
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:29.960]  the history of this but they are acting very very suspicious now they're
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:37.040]  getting desperate Beck says 5% of conservatives are birthers I've seen
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:42.640]  polls of 57% of registered Republicans questioning his birth in fact search
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.840]  engine that for folks for the TV audience majority of conservatives
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.800]  question Obama's birth certificate I've seen that headline everywhere I mean
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:54.520]  here's one LA Times today Arizona House panel approves bill requiring
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:59.680]  presidential candidates to show birth certificates nearly half of the Arizona
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.800]  Legislature wants to force President Barack Obama to show his birth
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:07.080]  certificate to state officials if he runs for reelection a state House
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:11.640]  Committee on Tuesday approved the measure sponsored 40 of the state's 90
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.920]  legislators it would require the presidential candidates who want to
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:18.960]  appear on the ballot in Arizona to submit documents approving proving that
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.240]  they meet the requirements to be president and it goes on bill requiring
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:29.440]  citizenship proof for president contenders passes House committee and it
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:37.480]  passed in a six to one vote so six to one so it's a deception to say 5% of
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:43.240]  America are truthers and 5% are birthers and to say birthers are dangerous bad
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:48.800]  people that's a Glenn Beck quote I mean that's political suicide I think that
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:53.600]  hurt him more and why he's lost 12% of his audience according to Nielsen in the
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.440]  last three weeks then just demonizing and setting up Debra Medina in Texas I
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.320]  believe he lost a lot of his viewers over the birther issue now I'm gonna shut
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.800]  up I've kind of laid some of the background and groundwork here Phil
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.800]  Berg wants to talk about the absolute proof that he is an Indonesian citizen
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.560]  his name is Barry Sataro so his name's even fake folks that's confirmed the
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.520]  president has an alias and it's one thing if you're a talk radio host have
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.320]  an alias or a movie star or something my name's really Alex Jones but a lot of
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.120]  times when people do have aliases I know some here locally it's because they
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:31.280]  have criminal histories okay and again his records are all sealed to break it
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:35.640]  all down is attorney Phil Berg Phil thanks for being here with us Alex a
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:40.040]  pleasure to be on with you again and you have great listeners out there and I
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:45.120]  think we're really getting to Obama significant for everyone and first off
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.280]  a real quick my background lifelong Democrat candidate for governor of
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.040]  the United States Senate and the Democratic primaries in Pennsylvania and many
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.080]  others which they can find out on my website Obama crimes.com lifelong
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.960]  Democrat and also then they throw at me I'm a racist well I happen to be a
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:06.920]  pay-to-play from the NAACP so I'm not a racist I just believe we should have you
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.160]  know equal rights in this country the rights given to us to our constitution
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:15.560]  the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights and what we have here is
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.960]  real quick is everyone knows that Arnold Schwarzenegger people talk to him
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.800]  about him running for president for the last 10 or 15 years and he constantly
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.000]  says then amend the Constitution because he admits he's from Austria and he
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  admits he doesn't fulfill the requirements the requirements for
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.360]  president under our U.S. Constitution are simple number one you're 35 years of
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:39.360]  age number two you lived in this country for 14 years and number three you'll be
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:45.240]  a natural born citizen. Arnold Schwarzenegger and acknowledges he's not
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:50.040]  Obama doesn't say anything directly but by not saying it he's walking all over
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.560]  the Constitution he's saying I don't care about the Constitution as Alex you
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.880]  just said all his records are sealed we really know nothing about this
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.840]  individual it's really outrageous that here we are 13 months after he's sworn
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.600]  into office that we still don't know anything but this is significant and I
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:10.320]  think we're making a headway I'll tell you why first off Nixon went down
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:14.880]  everyone not on the water gate break in he went down on the cover-up but we now
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:20.760]  have Obama in office 13 months and it's a cover-up significant I put out a press
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:25.320]  release two weeks ago calling for a birth certificate March on Washington we
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:28.960]  don't have a date yet as soon as we set the date we'll have it on our website
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.160]  now so I'll call you so we can talk about it on air but significant was the
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:38.160]  next day was the national prayer breakfast in Washington DC at the end of
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.400]  the breakfast Obama spoke and he said and I'm paraphrasing but exact words are
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:47.160]  on my website at the end of it he said no one should question my faith and then
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:51.960]  he paused and he said or my citizenship I really think we're crashing I think
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:56.160]  we're really getting to Obama or the people around him because many times
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:00.520]  and I'm sure I said on your show before but I'll reiterate when all is said and
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:04.760]  done Barack Obama actually his real name is Barry Soutoura we'll go into that
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.000]  Michelle Obama Howard Dean the former head of the Democratic National Committee
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.160]  other officials of the Democratic National Committee senior campaign
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.880]  officials and now senior administration officials who know that he's a phony on
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.640]  a fraud should be brought into our criminal justice system and should be
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.680]  tried those convicted should go to jail and Obama should go to jail and also he
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.320]  should be deported the reason I'm mentioning that is and I'm gonna be
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:32.200]  putting out a press release shortly or this I drafted it months ago but this
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.880]  the timing is right but we need is a deep throat we need the deep throat of
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:42.440]  regarding Obama because that's what broke it with the watergate because and I
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:46.840]  think it's gonna happen because we're now with him saying don't question my
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:52.520]  citizenship and Glenn Beck now going to town I don't know about this week last
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:57.560]  week I know he spoke about me three days in my picture up on his blackboard I
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:01.800]  try to confront him this I couldn't get to him this past Saturday I was in
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:05.960]  Washington DC at the CPAC convention 210 which is basically all the
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:10.600]  conservatives in the country he was a he was a keynote speaker at the end but
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.920]  couldn't get to him I gave something to one of his days I'm sure I'm sure he
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:19.240]  won't respond I challenge him on your show right here I challenge Glenn back
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.000]  with the base any time did you see the video where he pointed at you and said
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.920]  these people hate America no I haven't seen that I have to see that because I
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:30.760]  want to see what he's saying because what he's doing is he's on the verge of
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:35.080]  getting bringing out the crazies to come after me and and I have always called
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:39.920]  for one thing he called me a obstructionist I know I have always called
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:43.600]  for a peaceful revolution I don't want anything to happen to Obama I don't want
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:47.080]  to turn him into a martyr there's some other people out there are talking about
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:51.080]  different things I want a peaceful revolution and March in Washington is
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:55.360]  going to be peaceful and then and for yeah notice Beck keeps saying that's what
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.440]  he does he puts your picture up and and Van Jones and then points in your
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.960]  direction and says these people hate America these birthers these truthers
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:08.600]  they want to hurt you president they don't let him be in your administration
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:12.520]  they'll kill you know he said that literally scores of times so he's
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.880]  invoking this idea of violence very dangerous it is dangerous and if you
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:21.120]  can get me the actual clip from that because if he said that I'm going to
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.320]  ask for a retraction and if you won't retract it I'm gonna sue him because
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.840]  that's what's dangerous right now if everyone's looked at what I've been
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.880]  doing this and now my 19th month doing this I've always called for peaceful
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.720]  revolution I've called for doing this to the legal system and since the legal
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.520]  system is so slow we're having good but I have this birth certificate March in
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:43.760]  Washington probably late May early June and we're getting a fabulous response
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.800]  all across this country because every one of your listeners can identify with a
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:51.840]  birth certificate because they must show a birth certificate between one and ten
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.760]  times in their lifetime everyone needs it for a passport everyone needs its
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.400]  register for Little League you need it for different things for marriage or you
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:03.280]  need for scholarships or college or school the best one you're down there in
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:07.080]  Texas a woman sent me an email a while back from Texas and she said I
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:10.760]  registered my nephew for school at the end of the registration my nephew said
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.720]  the principal can I ask you a question
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.400]  principal says sure he said how come I had to show my birth certificate to
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:20.400]  registered for school but Obama didn't have to show it to become president and
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:24.560]  that's as it all when a 13 year old could identify with and then they lie and say
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:28.440]  he's shown his birth certificate he hasn't well now he hasn't any good
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:32.600]  you get people who look like fools like Chris Matthews shaking a piece of paper
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.000]  saying this is his birth certificate no one has seen the birth certificate what
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.280]  people have seen is not even a for real document because at the bottom of the
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.600]  document it says that there's any alteration that's inbound what people
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:49.920]  have seen is a certification of my birth which was even for that was put on
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.640]  their campaign website stay there stay there Phil I want to come back and
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:57.800]  recap though and get into the Indonesian situation the Barry Citerro who this
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.840]  guy really is because the birth certificate is only part of it we all

[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:17.120]  you've got legislatures passing or in the process of passing laws and the states
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.720]  do run the federal government saying you want to be on the ballot here you got
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:26.200]  to show your birth certificate now let's shift gears I mean to the key here and
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:31.920]  it's the fact that he his real name is Barry Sataro he became an Indonesian
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:37.080]  citizen he got adopted by a foreign family and you talk about this and the
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.920]  mainstream media says that's a lie when that's on record Philburg.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:45.480]  Absolutely the key really you know the bloggers on the internet they try to
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:49.600]  say they saw birth certificate everything we fight back and forth but we
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:53.400]  raised the issue then we shifted it the issue really is everyone out there the
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:57.680]  fact that he was adopted or even acknowledged in Indonesia in his book
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.800]  he's sort of bound by certain things number one in one of his books he says
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:04.640]  he found his birth certificate so it's a bologna that he can't produce it the
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.000]  reason they can't produce it will show that he was born in Kenya but the second
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.960]  thing in his book he says his parents had been divorced he says my stepfather
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:15.160]  Lolo Saturo returned to Indonesia before my mother and I well that's
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.400]  significant because in the 1960s Indonesia was at war the only ones who
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.400]  could go to school there were those that were natural of Indonesia he became
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:27.000]  natural because he was adopted or acknowledged we have a school record on
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.320]  our website and school record indicate his name is Barry Saturo SOETORO his
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:37.240]  nationality is Indonesia and religion is Islam ladies and gentlemen if he
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:42.800]  hasn't legally changed his name his name is his adopted name as Barry Saturo that
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:46.000]  is his name and that's what it was in college and that's why it's all sealed
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.880]  that's right that's why he's doing well also thinking field is records because I
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:54.200]  think it was show he applied for and receive foreign aid Obama is the biggest
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:59.480]  hoax in the history of our country in 200 over 230 years he's a phony he's
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:03.080]  a fraud I'm not mentioned words here I've been saying this and I need the
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:06.760]  American support behind me you know follow me on Obama crime.com we're
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:10.640]  gonna have a March on March of Washington everyone bring a copy your birth
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:14.160]  certificate and and we're gonna demand that either he produced that he showed
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.120]  that he's constitutionally qualified or we're gonna ask him demand that he
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.720]  resigned because Congress won't do anything right now Congress should be in
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:25.440]  peace this is a disaster what they have done and allowed we're in a
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:29.400]  constitutional crisis because once we get past that who becomes president that's
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.720]  a whole new issue another whole let me just throw this in for you before we
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:37.400]  got a break in a long segment time to flesh this out he says he's gonna sign
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.160]  executive orders on the carbon taxes doesn't care what the Congress says
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:45.600]  they Stonewall climate gate said it didn't exist that blew up in their face
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.640]  I mean it shows this is the most lying administration we've ever seen worse
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:54.960]  than Nixon worse than Clinton worse than Bush he said no lobbyist all he hired
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:00.480]  was lobbyist he said not gonna expand wars expanded the wars he said no
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:04.960]  signing statements went back on that I mean this guy is continuing and
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.760]  expanding torture I mean this guy is a complete and total fraud and from your
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:16.720]  deep research lay it out looking at this what is Obama's real story
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:21.640]  he does not he's not constitutionally qualified and the fact is Alex the
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.880]  reason he's doing the legislation he's doing and the reason his cabinet thinking
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:28.600]  about it for a minute I think the higher-ups in this country the power
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:32.680]  vote there's the money people said we know Phil Bergen others are right do you
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.760]  want to be president you got to play ball our way think about the cabinet he
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.040]  has it's not the cabinet he ran on he talks about chains look about the
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:43.680]  legislation he's pushing is that the candidate of change I think he's being
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:47.480]  blackmailed eternally internal and I'm waiting to see what happens when China
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.960]  and Iran get these documents because I'm sure they're out there and we're in a
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:56.800]  really to really bad situation because of Obama he is a fraud I one of my
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.280]  lawsuits is I believe he's not only non-natural born he's on naturalized
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:04.480]  but he's an illegal alien and therefore one of my lawsuits deals with the fact
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.520]  that he should not been a US senator and therefore the salary and benefit and
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:12.800]  expenses should be returned to US Treasury of about $1 million more
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:17.360]  important though because he's a surfer or fraud all the law he's passing as far
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.840]  as I am concerned avoid avoidable I mean we're really in a constitutional mess at
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.280]  this point and you know some people saying oh nothing should happen to
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:29.640]  Obama because if he goes out of office even legally Mr. Burke will be riots in
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.800]  the streets well there shouldn't be a riots in the streets because there's one
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.440]  person of blame for this and that's Barack Obama remember he taught
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.200]  constitutional law for ten years everyone aside from the schools he maybe
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.900]  went to we don't even know he's supposed to went to Occidental and
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:46.080]  Columbia University and Harvard Law School where his head of the Harvard
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.560]  Law Review people haven't seen his writings we know nothing about this
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:54.040]  person and that's the whole point they release other presidents records they're
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:59.160]  being very secretive you know he signed a document sealing all his records I
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:03.360]  mean this is a total total disgrace and we're gonna do everything in our power
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:08.040]  to expose him and force him legally out of office nothing to happen to him but
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.160]  force him to go out let him be tried he should go to jail and he should be
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:16.440]  deported and then he's got all this family that's here illegally to and
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:20.000]  living in slums he doesn't even help them I mean he's a really trashy
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.920]  well that's his hand up in Boston who's still trying to fight immigration
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:30.320]  she's an illegal alien and he doesn't get near because he's an illegal alien
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:36.280]  an illegal alien president well we know his Barack Obama's a fake name I mean
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:41.400]  we know he was Indonesian citizen it's on his school records the records we do
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:44.320]  have they're not denying those are real they just don't want to talk about it
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:49.200]  and you're right they're blackmailing him and totally controlling him more
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:57.760]  coming up we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN

[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.320]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:14.240]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:18.440]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:22.880]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:27.600]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:31.400]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:35.040]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:51.600]  screen hot water cold water their base unit has seven filters it runs the water
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:56.160]  from the air through reverse osmosis carbon you name it they've got a whole
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:59.600]  bunch of other even bigger filter systems that can serve hundreds of people
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:03.840]  not just seven and a half gallons a day that serves a home well a colablue.com
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:14.880]  or 800-691-6043 that's a colablue.com or 800-691-6043 the best water you can get

[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:02.840]  Berg Phil I'm trying to sit down for a while and just let you roll with this
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.640]  whole saga because there's a we have a lot of new listeners a lot of people
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:09.600]  just heard the media demonize burthers again why this is so important the whole
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.800]  Indonesia situation and then we're gonna open the phones up only on the
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:25.320]  burther issue folks for Phil Berg 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 Phil Berg thank you
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:29.400]  Alan ladies and gentlemen this issue is so important because there's nothing
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:34.600]  more important than our US Constitution when I was contacted by an
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:39.560]  individual to do this I checked into it and I proceeded one thing I said from
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:44.360]  the first day I filed the first lawsuit which is August 21st 2008 which is like
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:50.240]  19 months ago I said if I am wrong Obama prove me wrong show me all these
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:55.480]  documentation certified from the source and I will withdraw my lawsuit nothing
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:36:00.000]  like that has forthcoming nothing he has produced nothing making tape referring
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.280]  to the same document that they produced as a birth certificate what they
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:10.520]  produced certificate of live birth has no significant it doesn't have what a
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:14.240]  birth certificate had it does not have the baby's weight it does not have the
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:18.880]  baby's land it does not have a hospital name it does not have the doctor's name
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:23.880]  and the doctor's signature this is what's on a long-form birth certificate
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:27.560]  which I've now received hundreds of them since we put out the announcement
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:31.920]  we're asking people to fax or email or mail them to us for our birth certificate
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.120]  March from Washington which will be in late May or June but more significant
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:39.560]  than the birth certificate issue because people keep arguing you know while
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:43.680]  Chris Massey said he saw it and Glenn or Riley said he thought that I think both
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:47.760]  of us backed off on those statements but more significant is the fact that he
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:51.840]  was adopted or acknowledged in Indonesia now I'll tell you why because I had an
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:54.920]  argument the other day with an immigration attorney I raised the
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:58.240]  question so people could identify with this I said what happens about the
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:01.760]  children that are being adopted here in the United States from Haiti and he said
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:04.520]  well they sever all the relationships with Haiti and they take the new
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:09.400]  families last name etc etc etc I said then how can you disagree with me and
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:13.880]  when Obama is adopted in Indonesia the same thing doesn't take place he lost
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:18.600]  his word he couldn't speak the fact is when Obama and it's in his book so he's
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:22.840]  like stuck on certain things his parents divorce his mother remarried he goes to
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:27.680]  Indonesia we have his school record which says his name is Barry Saturo and
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:31.800]  as Alex said a little while ago when he was first in the Occidental people knew
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:36.640]  him as Barry that's his name that's his legal name therefore unless he has
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:40.600]  legally changed his name his name is Barry Saturo you know and many of you
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:44.120]  out there have adopted children or know someone that has adopted a child they
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:47.920]  take your family last name now significant as the fact is when he came
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:54.600]  back at age 10 to live with his mother's parents his grandparents in Hawaii we
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:59.080]  believe that he did not go through immigration if he did go into immigration
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:03.160]  he would have been given a certificate of citizenship but because he became a
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:08.040]  natural of Indonesia he would have only become naturalized but we believe he
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:12.640]  didn't go through there he went back on his Indonesia passport and therefore he
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:17.880]  is an illegal alien therefore he cannot be a senator now significant with this
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.200]  only school record which is posted on our website from Indonesia his name is
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:27.240]  Barry Saturo his nationality is Indonesia his religion is Islam you know
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:32.200]  he's have you believe he was never a Muslim well Islam is Muslim and after
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:36.440]  he got sworn into office now he's like basically catering to the Muslim you
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:40.400]  know during the campaign you could not use his middle name of Hussein but he
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:45.840]  was sworn in he becomes Brock Hussein Obama then he went to Egypt then he went
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.760]  to Egypt and said I have the same religion as you and spoke Arabic from
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:58.360]  the Quran better than many people in the country they were shocked by it and just
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:02.760]  incredible and then also out if you recall he mentioned about the United
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:06.320]  States the United States he said has the largest Muslim population in the
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.240]  world I mean he and then he goes apologizing around the world for the
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:16.880]  for the United States actions in the past and then he bows down to the Saudi
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.960]  King no president I think he's ever bowed down to anyone he bows down there's a
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:25.040]  question because the rain also the Saudi King and then when he's in Japan he
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:28.720]  bowed down to the Japanese Emperor and then they lie and say he's dropping
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.960]  things but we have the video where he clearly bows to everybody and it gets
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:39.000]  worse because we know that his real name is Barry Saturo we know we have a
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.200]  president who's using an alias we know that he was adopted and the media is not
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.800]  even denying that they just they just don't even cover it I mean I mean this
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:53.360]  is this is so huge well a great point in which you brought up because and your
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:57.040]  listeners can compare it to look what they did to Sarah Palin during the last
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:01.400]  six weeks of the campaign the reporters in droves went to Alaska went under every
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:05.200]  stone behind every door asked her all kinds of questions now think back what
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:09.000]  they did with Obama they've never asked him anything if they probably vetted
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.040]  Obama he would never have been nominated let alone be elected president I mean
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:16.760]  it's really and I was interviewed by the New York Times and I said I wish I
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:19.840]  could see the national media including the New York Times for not properly
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:23.360]  vetting Obama they even had the guts up they printed that they printed even
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:27.240]  so in the New York Times because it's a disgrace but the problem is and I
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:32.960]  laughed about it two years ago when Bush questioned Russia about Putin with a
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.000]  free press we don't have a free press in this country most the president's
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.960]  country is now by owned by three or four major corporations and there was a
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:45.680]  study done at the person who was really the source of the information has not
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:49.480]  allowed her name to be released but there's supposedly an office in the
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:53.840]  White House that is keeping pressure on all these media outlets to not discuss
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:59.240]  this story but we're bypassing that the American public is waking up and and
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:02.680]  that's my goal this year that's my goal this to raise the public awareness
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:08.400]  because all of you out there must show your birth certificate now why is this
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:12.320]  important well there's nothing for his my opinion and many others there's
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:16.760]  nothing more important than the U.S. Constitution I'm doing this for about
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:21.600]  305 maybe there's 308 million people in this country that deserve to know the
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.760]  truth I'm doing this for our forefathers who wrote these fantastic
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:29.600]  document which countries around the world have tried to copy and duplicate
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:34.960]  most have not and I'm also doing this out for the 1.6 million men and women
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.280]  who have died in battle to try to defend this Constitution and another 1.6
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:44.000]  million who will have been injured or maimed fighting these wars and the
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.480]  millions of others who have served that great nation in wars in wartime and
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:52.840]  peacetime defending this Constitution and then you have Barack Obama who
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:56.480]  basically doesn't care about the Constitution and aside from the things
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:59.560]  we're talking about which is the first amendment he's talking about things on
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:02.320]  the second amendment now they're actually going on about other issues but we
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:08.040]  know let's expand let's expand on that sure for two weeks for two weeks when
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:12.320]  the climate gate emails came out the media wouldn't cover it then for another
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:16.360]  week or two they said it wasn't real then they were enforced to say okay it's
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:22.200]  real and now they admit it's all been a giant fraud basically and so we see this
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:27.600]  stonewalling by Obama also saying there's no way our healthcare can fail it
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:33.440]  will pass it's like this Borg you will be assimilated resistance is futile
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:38.520]  statement and it's the same thing on the birther issue it is hurting him I know
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:42.080]  there's a cover-up I know he hasn't released the real birth certificate I
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:46.900]  know he's blocking all the school records I know he's blocking his records
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:52.080]  when he came back to Hawaii separate from the birth certificate why would they
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:57.360]  be covering all this up if there wasn't something there it's a fact they're
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:01.440]  covering it up listeners it's a fact they haven't shown the real birth
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:07.720]  certificate only certificate alive birth it's a fact a fact a fact and it's not
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:11.440]  gonna go away and if we're 13 months into his presidency then he's got the
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:14.960]  lowest approval rating of any president one year in in history and plunging even
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:19.760]  faster and he's breaking just every record this is devastating him whether
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:23.760]  he likes it or not and stalling their entire agenda which I think is a great
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:28.720]  thing regardless but now I'm getting to the point where it really does to me look
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:34.360]  like that he's not a citizen absolutely now there's anything higher but the
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:39.400]  latest figures I had a 1.6 million people say it's 1.7 or too bad for your
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:43.920]  listeners out there Obama has spent at least 1.6 million writing my three
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:48.800]  lawsuits and the 50 other lawsuits that came about you don't spend that kind of
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.480]  money you don't spend that kind of money unless you're really hiding something
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:57.680]  and he and he's hiding I want to go to cause he's hiding because he's a
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:01.120]  phony and a fraud I really think and I don't know what your listeners I think
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:04.760]  he's being blackmailed internally and what happens when Iran gets this what
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:08.760]  happens when China gets this what happens when Cuba gets this I think he's
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:13.520]  put our country in a dangerous dangerous position not only what and on top of
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.960]  that what he's doing but you know I can go on forever what he's doing but I'm
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:20.520]  concerned with Eric Holder one of my cases the case where I say he's an
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:24.400]  illegal alien and shouldn't be a US senator we have one of the issues we
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:29.080]  just found our appeal to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals if there ever was a
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:32.360]  conflict of interest ladies and gentlemen let me set it forth real quick
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:37.800]  in those type cases are called false claims act cases it was still because of
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.720]  that not because it was something special all false claims act cases you
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:45.600]  know false claims act are usually done in Medicaid or Medicare fraud
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:49.920]  hypothetically if I believe my next door neighbor is committing fraud what I
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:53.200]  would do is I would follow this action on behalf of the United States of America
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:58.680]  and as the relator they call the person filing a relator already LAT or and then
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:03.360]  also then versus Jane and John Doe from next door or Jane and John Doe are not
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:07.520]  served the Justice Department has served the US Attorney has served and they have
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:11.840]  60 days to review the case so that's a quick that put up what I did I found this
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:16.120]  against Obama so Obama's not served but they're just let me be clear let me be
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:23.680]  clear in in in layman's terms the government is not a party to the suit
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:29.160]  they don't have standing to be heard only you the citizen does and so are you
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:32.960]  saying that the Justice Department has no right to even block you let me let me
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:36.840]  clarify one more actually what happens is you're bringing this action the
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:41.800]  government has three choices what to do number one that they can pursue the case
[01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:45.760]  against Jane or John Doe in this case against Obama number two they can give
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:49.440]  it to the relator the person bringing the action in this case me or number three
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:54.440]  they could dismiss the case in very few cases they ever dismissed the case many
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:58.160]  times they give it to the relator to produce because to proceed because they
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:01.600]  don't want to spend the time or money on the case it depends the value of the
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:04.800]  how much that etc etc I understand they're defending the cases what you're
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:07.720]  saying listen I know you're very busy but I want to be able to take a lot of
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:11.440]  calls but I want you to also have time to speak can you stay with us about 15
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:14.720]  minutes in the next hour as long as you want me I'll stay two days I'll stay a
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:18.200]  week with you you're great well we're gonna then let you finish up and then
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:20.720]  we're gonna take calls for 30 minutes into the next hour because I want to
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:25.640]  hear the different angles and points that listeners will bring up on this
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.920]  front but but shifting gears again I want to get this question out there what
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:33.560]  do you think of the Arizona House passing it out a committee six to one and
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:38.800]  now it looks like right at half of the legislature is set to vote and they're
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:44.000]  gaining votes that they may pass a law in Arizona saying if Obama runs again in
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.440]  the next two years starts his campaign up to be on the ballot there in Arizona
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:52.440]  that he's gonna have to show his real birth certificate I think it's fabulous
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:56.280]  it just shows that that the issue I started and now so I don't care who
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:59.600]  courses to finish line with it I'm glad I'm out there I'm gonna stay with this
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:02.640]  issue I think it's bad with a congressman I don't have his name from
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:07.440]  Florida introduce legislation in the House of Representatives in Washington to
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:12.240]  the same effect that adds up 2012 the any presidential candidate has to show
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:16.560]  that their constitution qualified only about seven to ten other Republicans
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:20.800]  joined in that action no Democrats now why haven't the Democrats joined because
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:25.440]  the Democrats know he's a phony but this is great to Washington's not doing
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:29.720]  Arizona that's fabulous and I hope what their states do do that and I think it's
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:34.160]  they're realizing that the Constitution I mean stop and think everyone out there
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:38.040]  we have such great things in this country and why do we have it we have it
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:42.440]  because we've fought to defend this we had a fight with England to form our
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.560]  country you know people died defending this Constitution and we have this
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:50.600]  fraud this phony of Obama coming up there the biggest hoax in our history
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:55.720]  it's wrong everyone out there let me stop you again let's say let's say he
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:48:00.320]  really was born in Hawaii why is he covering it up but let's go further he
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:05.200]  was adopted and became an Indonesian citizen that's on record right and then
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:09.400]  he tried to lie about that even though it's in his book and now I've seen him
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:12.280]  in a few speeches we played it a few months ago maybe we can pull it up in
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:16.240]  fact try to YouTube Obama refers to himself as Barry he's even joked around
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:21.080]  and called himself Barry Sataro as if he's trying to inoculate people to this
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:25.720]  fact because he knows it's coming out oh absolutely I think we're really getting
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:30.360]  to him I think it just shows I mean again why would you spend what are you
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:34.800]  doing but the significant part is he's adopted in Indonesia once he's adopted
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.560]  in Indonesia even if he was born in Hawaii he would lose his natural born
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:42.780]  status and how just to relate this I relate that story to you with the
[01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:46.440]  immigration attorney told me about people being adopted from Haiti they cut off
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:50.080]  where they came from well then Obama would have come off from from here but
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:55.240]  but I think that's all baloney because I don't think he was born in Hawaii when
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:00.800]  when Jerry Corsi went to Kenya they had him arrested they put him on house
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:04.720]  arrest right they wouldn't let him do anything they wouldn't let him go talk to
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:09.120]  the village where he were Obama was born right right and we have on our
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:14.160]  website we have the step-grandmother Sarah Obama in Swahili we have the
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:18.200]  translation stating she was in the hospital when he was born in Mombasa
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:22.800]  Kenya now at the end of the day there's some kids y'all no no Hawaii she stated
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:26.760]  definitely she was in the hospital when he was born that's more significant than
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:30.640]  anything they produce they produce one thing that document which is a phony then
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:33.880]  they keep saying well there were two newspaper articles saying he was born
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:39.000]  my children live I'm in Pennsylvania my children live in other states when my
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.520]  grandchildren were born I put an announcement in here in my local paper
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:46.640]  that I have a new grandson that doesn't mean he was born there that doesn't mean
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:50.320]  my children are born here they're not they're born elsewhere to that and that's
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:53.600]  their strongest argument well what do you think his mother planned ahead he was
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:57.000]  gonna run for president that's why she put it in the newspaper no I think the
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.680]  mother really wanted him to be a U.S. citizen but the word is he was in Kenya
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:06.400]  and she couldn't fly back because she was too pregnant well that's exactly what
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.320]  a mother would do she would come back and try to dummy it up even if she had no
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:13.520]  idea he was gonna run for president she'd want him to be a U.S. citizen
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:17.920]  correct because especially then and even now even even though right now I think
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:21.560]  we're in trouble waters because of the many things Obama is doing people fight
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:25.920]  to get to the United States because we have freedoms I mean the sad part is
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.240]  ladies and gentlemen we're listening to this we take for granted some of these
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:32.480]  freedoms you have in this country and you shouldn't I remember with being my
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:36.160]  children going through a train over in Europe a number of years ago and we were
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:39.680]  stopped because we took a train through at that time Czechoslovakia and we
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:43.680]  didn't have the correct papers for that the conductive that got hit me and my
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:47.280]  children if not they were armed guards came on that thing then checking with
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:50.960]  people to take them off you don't realize what freedoms you have here I
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:54.520]  mean what we're talking about here today Alex when your show you couldn't be

[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:24.040]  we're going to your calls for attorney Phil Burke this is the guy two years ago
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:29.240]  saw some of this documentation said I'm gonna investigate
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:33.240]  Deputy Attorney General previously in the state run for governor member of the
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:41.000]  NAACP prominent member but I believe on their board they're in that state and
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.320]  they've said every horrible thing in the world about him he's racist all this
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:55.880]  crud and even Obama being African is a fraud African as in not Arab because
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:55:07.000]  they're Arab Africans he's 6% African 6% he's 44% Arab 50% Anglo-Saxon I don't
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.680]  care what color he is the point is that's a distraction just like when you
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:14.680]  say you don't want social as health care which it wasn't even that it was a
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:19.240]  insurance company scam even Howard Dean said that now and then his percentage
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:25.200]  that's why it's dead in the water even when that came out that Chris Matthews
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:34.600]  and Carlos Watson and others said this is racism it's racism racism to say I
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:37.840]  don't want health care so they're playing the race card and it's totally
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:42.280]  blown up in their face it's not working I want to go to your phone calls and
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:47.440]  we've got to mr. Berg for another 30 minutes of the next hour so plenty of

[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:54.480]  got a lot of courage I talked to him off air they haven't killed him or set him
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:57.600]  up because that will just elevate everything he's doing we'll talk about
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:01.640]  that before he leaves but let's talk to Julio in Illinois Julio thanks for

[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:23.880]  very welcome my question is first off I took an African-American studies class
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:29.680]  two years ago or last year here in college in McComb Illinois and we saw
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:36.240]  the biography channel biography on Barry Satoro and they said growing up that
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:40.080]  they called me his nickname was Barry I do remember that and I just saw right
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:45.000]  now on TV for Comcast cable people on demand you can look that up they have
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.760]  his biography there but my question you're talking about a a march in
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:56.280]  Washington DC on tax day possibly on April 15th how does Barry Satoro go off
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.520]  paying his taxes under the under the alias Barack Obama similar to Turbo
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:07.480]  tax the rat Tim Geithner how does this sick disgusting man get away you know
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:12.360]  with his aliases and you have you know Benedict Arnold you know that's a great
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:16.600]  point much of his own cabinet has been caught in tax trouble doesn't pay their
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:19.920]  taxes it's just a lawless group of criminals and you were gonna say
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:27.120]  something about about mr. Beck yeah better than Arnold you know him you

[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:37.040]  show why the Berther issue is so important we're taking calls on the
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:40.280]  bottom of the hour when he leaves us then Lindsay Williams with more inside
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:44.640]  info directly from the highest levels of global power structure on what they're
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:47.240]  planning with the dollar and the economy
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:51.600]  Bill Berg you heard Julio's points quick comments on that before we go to more
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:56.520]  calls well I think it's discussing that back tries to associate me with each
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:00.840]  other people and tries to tie me in that I hate America I don't hate America I do
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:05.040]  this because I love America and I'm gonna I'm gonna challenge back he won't
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:09.000]  do it I'm gonna challenge him to a debate she's got the nerve to put me up
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.720]  there and talk about me I'm gonna challenge him to debate he probably won't
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:18.840]  do it and but it's wrong what he's doing and wrong making me connotations I
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:24.480]  want peace I want a peaceful revolution I want this through the court system and
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:28.600]  not to do that I'm gonna embrace the American public of a birth certificate
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:32.080]  March in Washington which will be peaceful and demand that if he can't
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:36.000]  prove that he's constantly eligible that he resigned can you see a million people
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.680]  there with a copy birth certificate and Obama like not doing the meeting would
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:42.920]  have to cover that and by the way at these town halls as you know for a year
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:48.680]  now Republican and Democrats will say no he's American citizen and literally the
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:53.680]  whole room starts screaming at him even at Democrat events people are sick of
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.520]  this and Obama crimes.com is your website I've seen it on TV I've heard it
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:02.520]  where he puts you up there next to the weathermen and others and says these
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:06.840]  people hate America they're dangerous folks send those videos because there's
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:10.360]  millions of listeners you can find them I have a small staff I've seen I don't
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:13.720]  have time to go dig it out it would take maybe 10 hours you know dig through
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:17.920]  hundreds of shows send it all the Philburg help him so he has the info
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:23.040]  but also support obama crimes.com let's go to Matt in Ohio Matt you're on the
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:25.240]  air go ahead.
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:33.920]  I'm gonna be way out left field here but what do you think the chances are that the
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:38.240]  puppet masters the people that pull Obama's strings and the higher the higher
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:45.160]  ups in government are gonna let Obama's true identity as first to getting all
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:52.040]  that out at the right time to get him impeached in order to impose more laws
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:03:00.000]  on us to be able to keep better track of us. You're saying you're saying that
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:05.280]  could be the false flag it would cause riots all sorts of problems fill your
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:08.760]  take on it. Well you know I'm gonna demand when we get him out of office
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:11.960]  that we're gonna do it we're gonna demand we'll hold a news conference I'm gonna
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:16.280]  call the top politicians in this country to religious leaders and say you plan to
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:21.160]  cause riots in the streets and damage property and injure people why the only
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:25.040]  person responsible for this is Barack Obama. Now I don't think they're gonna
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:28.720]  let it out I think what's gonna happen is the American public is gonna demand it.
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.360]  I think about 20 million people know about this help me raise the public
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:36.120]  awareness to 100 million people we will force him out of office because this is
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:40.560]  outrageous what he is doing and he's out to
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:44.520]  destruct to tear apart our country. Well it's just like Climate Gate the first
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:47.320]  month when they said it wasn't real and now it blew up in their face and they've
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:51.040]  all admitted they're liars. It's the same thing they're stonewalling the truth
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:54.120]  can't be stopped we know he's an Indonesian citizen we know his real
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:58.040]  names Barry Sitaro that's enough right there under law because he can't be a
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:02.760]  natural explain that to people Phil. Well once he's adopted there it becomes a
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:07.240]  natural of Indonesia and therefore when he came back to our immigration law he
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:10.640]  would only become naturalized but someone did what's called a FOIA request
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:14.440]  freedom of information request send me a copy to answer a copy of Obama's birth
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:17.960]  certificate it came back that he never had one now they didn't check for Barry
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:21.080]  Sitaro but I think he never had one I think he traveled on his Indonesia
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:25.240]  passport that's why at age 20 he went to he stopped in Indonesia on his way to
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:30.640]  Pakistan to renew his passport. Let's be clear let's be clear on this. His real
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:34.200]  names Barry Sitaro on record coming up we've got him calling into our radio
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:39.880]  show in DC calling himself Barry that's coming up his name is Barry Sitaro
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:44.040]  folks do you realize they're freezing all his documents all his records they're
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:48.600]  covering something up that's even worse than him really being an Indonesian
[02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:53.600]  citizen we have an Indonesian citizen as our president and once you even if he
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:57.840]  had been in a US citizen before he'd have to waive that citizenship to become a
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:02.440]  citizen of Indonesia I mean if I wanted to go wave myself. One major world crisis
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:07.840]  away from having a totalitarian type of system. The main event is the wholesale
[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:12.360]  destruction of the world to push for every nation on the globe to identify and

[02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:07.720]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:12.040]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:15.840]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:19.480]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:24.040]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:28.080]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only

[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:45.680]  obama he's just on record his real names Barry Citaro a citizen of indonesia
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:50.440]  that's the only record we can get he admits that but says it's no big deal
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:55.160]  and the media never covers that they just say we've shown the birth certificate
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:59.840]  these people are lying why is obama sealed all of his school record because
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:04.680]  the real names Barry Citaro and a lot of people are coming forward saying he was
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:10.240]  called Barry Citaro then and that he was getting foreign aid now we're gonna go
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:14.360]  back to your calls david john nick ronald nother's questions for philberg
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:21.600]  only on the subject of the birther issue and where his court cases are going but
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:26.600]  here's the associated phil go ahead i was gonna that's right i just want to
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:29.840]  say something because many people say well our parent can't be now you know
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:34.560]  give up their children's rights well that's true to a point but if obama
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:39.320]  wanted to do that between the ages of 18 and 21 he would have had to renounce
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:44.280]  his indonesia citizenship and reaffirm any citizenship that he did have the
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:47.960]  i'd say that there's no evidence he did that either he sealed all those records
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:51.800]  the college everything let's play this clip just like everybody else buried
[02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:56.360]  from dc called virginia governor uh... tim canes radio show to complain about
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:10:01.000]  traffic but buried from dc was really president barack obama the surprise came
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.240]  with a prank call just like everybody else buried from dc now here is obama
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:10.840]  this is associated press but a couple months ago this is december 22
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:12.860]  two thousand nine last year
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:16.300]  calling and using his real name here it is
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:19.920]  governor let's get back to the phones and i let this in cars we have a very
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:22.180]  from dc is called go ahead very
[02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:23.320]  well uh...
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:24.880]  governor came to the
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:28.840]  actually president united states call
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:32.960]  now i i i i i i don't know my guess about the
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:35.900]  about traffic
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:44.380]  Oh, but rather than go there, I just wanted to say how proud we are of your service as
[02:10:44.380 --> 02:10:51.900]  governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia and just wish you and the family all the best.
[02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:59.260]  Okay, Christmas season. And it goes on. That's AP news right there. AP video. So it's a big
[02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:03.900]  joke to him to use his real name, isn't it, Phil? Yeah, it really is. But when he does it,
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:08.780]  acknowledge it, it just reinforces the words I've been using that he's a fraud and he's a phony.
[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:11.980]  You notice the secret services are coming after me because I'm talking the truth.
[02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:17.020]  That he's a fraud, he's a phony. The biggest hoax in the history of our country, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:23.340]  we must stop it. Well, it gets worse. I could play video from Vermont and from Missouri,
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:29.180]  where they had police go on the news and say, if you criticize Obama and say he's not a Christian
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:34.780]  or say he wasn't born here, we're going to arrest you. Did you ever see that video? No, I heard about
[02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:39.100]  it. So send it to me. I'd like to see that one. In fact, as Aaron, the headline, I think it's
[02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:45.820]  something like thought police in Missouri. But the point is, no, that was on TV. I mean,
[02:11:45.820 --> 02:11:51.180]  they were on TV saying we will arrest you. So that shows the mindset and it turned out the Obama
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:58.380]  campaign was having local Democrat police and sheriffs and prosecutors come out and threaten
[02:11:58.380 --> 02:12:03.500]  people. I mean, this is, look, Jerome, of course, he got the documents, the emails from Obama when
[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:11.500]  he was in the Senate to his cousin, Odinga, threatening to and saying, cause riots. So
[02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:15.820]  you lost the election, cause riots, and they'll give you a position in the government. And they
[02:12:15.820 --> 02:12:20.860]  did what they created. Not only causing riots, what they did is they caused riots. They set
[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:25.340]  fire to churches with people alive. They burned down churches. They burned people alive. I mean,
[02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:30.060]  it's a bad point. And then Odinga- And Obama told them to do it. Right. And then Odinga-
[02:12:30.060 --> 02:12:35.100]  Obama raised a million dollars for him during that time. And then by doing all that, they forced
[02:12:35.100 --> 02:12:39.820]  it. Odinga was given a position in the government over there. Yeah. Before they just had president,
[02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:44.620]  what they made a prime minister ship for him. Yep. I mean, because they were burning everything
[02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:50.380]  down and Obama told him in the email, burn it. I mean, this guy's a terrorist. There's no doubt
[02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:55.260]  about it. Let's take another call here. David Main, you're on the air, David. Yes, gentlemen.
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:13:01.580]  I have a comment and a question. Good job, Phil. Thank you, David. I will refer to our president
[02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:07.820]  from here on as President Satoro. And I recommend anybody else do the same. And when people ask
[02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:11.740]  you, what are you, you know, what is that all about? Then explain to them everything that you've
[02:13:11.740 --> 02:13:17.820]  laid out. Now, my question is a constitutional crisis question. If it's found out, if we can prove
[02:13:17.820 --> 02:13:24.140]  that he's illegitimate, I believe he is, then every executive order, every bill he signed,
[02:13:24.140 --> 02:13:30.780]  every treaty, every foreign agreement is invalid. What happens then if it's, say,
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:37.180]  three years into the presidency and this all comes out and he has to leave. It's no doubt about it.
[02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:43.020]  It's pointless to argue. Everything he's done is bad, so that sounds great.
[02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:46.780]  Yeah. David, that's why I don't want to wait three years. I want to get it this year.
[02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:50.460]  That's why I want the people to join with me. We'll only have to get down to March
[02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:55.660]  because he is a phony. Everything he has done is void or avoidable. It's really
[02:13:55.660 --> 02:13:59.660]  a disgrace. And we are in a constitutional crisis because, and it would take another whole
[02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:03.500]  show, it can't go in the whole thing, about two would become president. He used to vote,
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:06.780]  I don't know, the amendment, he used to vote separate for president, vice president.
[02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:10.860]  He voted now jointly for them. So therefore, I don't believe Biden would become because it was
[02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:16.140]  a fraudulent ticket. Does it go back to January 8th, the joint session of Congress with Congress,
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:20.220]  violated their duty because they were only going to vote for, their duty was to vote for
[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:24.940]  cap the votes, electoral college votes for a qualified person. So does it go back there
[02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:29.660]  because if one member of the House, one member of the Senate had given a written objection,
[02:14:29.660 --> 02:14:33.500]  they would have gone to the separate House and Senate to discuss the issue. And if they didn't
[02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:37.900]  agree, they would have nominated whoever they wanted for president, vice president. But because
[02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:42.300]  they didn't do their job, does it go back to December 15th, when all the electors met in the
[02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:46.540]  state capitals of the various states, and they voted but improperly because they were always
[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:51.020]  supposed to vote for a constitutionally qualified candidate. Or does it go back to November 8th,
[02:14:51.020 --> 02:14:56.380]  election day? We have a real mess on our hands, but I believe that mess has to be dealt with
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:00.300]  more so than keeping Obama afloat. Hi, Harry. We got to move quick. David,
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:05.740]  I appreciate your call. Speaking about threats, it came out in major newspapers last year that
[02:15:05.740 --> 02:15:11.900]  there's 25 people on Obama's hit list. And of course, I'm number 24 on there. And it said
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:17.340]  that Barther groups and yourself are also on the list. And there is no doubt that they've got an
[02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:22.940]  enemy's list. People need to be praying for all of us. Okay. Yeah, please pray for me, everyone out
[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:29.020]  there. Absolutely. And also spread the word. So you don't know when the march is going to be yet?
[02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:32.780]  Well, no, we're working on that. To have the date, I'll call you back and then we'll have it up on
[02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:38.380]  our website and we'll tell you if we get on your show and spread the word. But the initial reaction
[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:42.300]  response from people is phenomenal. People will want to do something because it's something they
[02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:46.860]  can do. And every one of your listeners can identify with a birth certificate issue. One other thing,
[02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:52.540]  the people that Obama associated with heirs and the Reverend Wright and all those people, etc, etc.
[02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:57.340]  You know, he couldn't even get a job as a Chicago police officer with who he dealt with. He couldn't
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:02.060]  get a job as an FBI agent or a secret service agent because of, but yet the secret service is
[02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:06.540]  protecting him. Well, about it doesn't even make sense. I'm not saying this is a good thing,
[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:11.740]  but I understand why it's been done in the old days. If you weren't three, four or fifth generation,
[02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:17.180]  you couldn't be FBI or secret service because it was important that, that, that you not be a spy
[02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:20.620]  because when the constitution was ratified for those that don't know,
[02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:27.660]  they had cases of Austria sending its people, members of its government, its ruling class and
[02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:34.780]  royalty in to Poland and other countries to try to get elected and take over those nations.
[02:16:34.780 --> 02:16:39.820]  And so this has always been an old problem. And if this guy, I mean, his real names,
[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:45.100]  Barry Zittaro, how is he our president? As you say, the Indonesia thing is bona fide 100%
[02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:49.180]  that right there disqualifies him. Forget the birth certificate.
[02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:54.620]  All right. Yep, absolutely. And we're running an ad on that the next week at the paper, Washington
[02:16:54.620 --> 02:16:58.940]  Times and we'll be doing another ad to course the country. If we do more money, we raise,
[02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:02.940]  we'll spread the word. We must spread the word around the country. And we want to have a march
[02:17:02.940 --> 02:17:07.100]  from Washington like we never saw. All right, let's talk to John and Maine. John, you're on the
[02:17:07.100 --> 02:17:16.060]  year. Go ahead. Hi, please tell how his collegiate records are being sealed or were sealed,
[02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:19.740]  his adult records. How does that operate so I can show mom?
[02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:25.100]  Well, the reason that I moved to first when it came out, I believe his college records are
[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:29.660]  sealed for one reason. It's a show he applied for and received baronade either. No, no,
[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:34.060]  he's asking how were they sealed? How were they sealed? He had executive order. He signed the
[02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:40.620]  day of, uh, that he was born into office. So the first thing on his mind when he got sworn in
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:46.220]  and had that executive power was to keep his record secret. Absolutely. Absolutely. Because
[02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:50.940]  he doesn't want to think about it. We know nothing about him. We haven't seen one thing from him.
[02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:55.740]  John, does that answer your question? Yes. Do you know the number of that executive order?
[02:17:55.740 --> 02:18:00.220]  No, I don't. So I can show my mom. Hey guys, search engine Obama signs executive order
[02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:04.940]  sealing records. I remember that in the news on January 22nd. Obama signs executive order
[02:18:04.940 --> 02:18:09.100]  sealing records. Thanks for the call, John. Let's talk to Nick and Colorado. Nick, you're on the
[02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:15.340]  year. Go. Hey, um, I just was wondering, um, if we, um, if, since we know that the shadow government
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:22.140]  basically put Obama into his position, my question is, um, why do you think that, um, they didn't
[02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:26.220]  put somebody in there that could produce the documents or just, you know, produce documents
[02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:31.020]  for him since they have that. I'll answer the question. They knew he was slick and a darling.
[02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:35.820]  They could blackmail him, uh, and controlling with the information, with it being compromised.
[02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:41.020]  And they love to violate our constitution and sovereignty. Like Obama became the first,
[02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:44.460]  I'm going to play this later. Do you guys cue it up? In fall of the republic, we have him
[02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:50.700]  becoming the first U S president to coach, to chair the UN security council that violates
[02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:56.060]  the constitution. Phil Burke. Yes, it does violate the constitution. And, uh, I think they put him
[02:18:56.060 --> 02:18:59.580]  up because when I get the phone call, you got to think about this, ladies and gentlemen. The phone
[02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:03.340]  call I got was, they said, Phil, you're the only attorney in the country we know with breasts.
[02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:07.900]  You know what? They would sue Obama. And, and, and that was an honor I took here, but since then
[02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:11.500]  other attorneys have joined suit, but it's very rare. You're going to find someone that wants to
[02:19:11.500 --> 02:19:15.100]  challenge the president or someone of that statute. And I did it because I think there's
[02:19:15.100 --> 02:19:19.020]  nothing more important than our constitution. And there's very few of us that would do something
[02:19:19.020 --> 02:19:25.500]  like that. Absolutely. Uh, and again, I meant to have it queued up from fall of the republic.
[02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:28.780]  We did like five minutes in the film and I'll play it before the show ends today after you
[02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:34.300]  leave us specifically on him and CNN said he's now president of the world. He has to swear
[02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:38.380]  the UN oath and we give the subsection of the constitution where it says you can't do that.
[02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:44.380]  I mean, this is outrageous. Uh, anything he does, the national media is not anything detrimental,
[02:19:44.380 --> 02:19:50.140]  but actually does not cover it. We're going to jam in Nick, Ronald, Bob and John's quick

[02:21:11.980 --> 02:21:16.860]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. We have tremendous influence
[02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:22.860]  on our president and Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:28.860]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. All of the republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:35.180]  nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructed
[02:21:35.180 --> 02:21:39.180]  by the acting world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[02:21:39.180 --> 02:21:43.820]  more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody

[02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:08.620]  not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in
[02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:13.500]  these changing economic times. With our national debt currently exceeding 12.5 trillion dollars
[02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:18.140]  and our unfunded liabilities towing over 107 trillion dollars, the value of the U.S. dollar
[02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:22.300]  continues its slide into oblivion. There's still time to ensure your financial security with

[02:24:17.420 --> 02:24:21.260]  Lindsey Williams is coming up. When we start the next segment, I'm going to play about four
[02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:25.820]  minutes from fall of the Republic, where I break down Obama becoming the head of the U.N.
[02:24:25.820 --> 02:24:29.820]  And I'll give you the chapter and verse, the Constitution, where it's treason.
[02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:35.340]  Ronald in New Jersey. You're on the air with Phil Burr. Go ahead.
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:43.020]  Yes, sir. Mr. Burr, Alex. Thank you very much. Just to be quick, I have a question that I've been
[02:24:43.020 --> 02:24:48.540]  trying to get a good answer to for about a year. I agree with everything you said. I think that
[02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:53.900]  there's ample evidence that there is no bar certificate. But even if there was, even if Obama
[02:24:53.900 --> 02:25:00.460]  was born in Hawaii, just by virtue of the fact that his father was never an American and had
[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:07.740]  he lived, could very well be ruling Kenya, doesn't that in itself contradict what was
[02:25:07.740 --> 02:25:11.740]  intended by the founders and according to the term natural born citizen?
[02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:17.660]  I don't believe so. And that's an argument other attorneys have come forth with. I don't believe
[02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:23.820]  so because we keep changing the definition of natural born for this reason. If husband
[02:25:23.820 --> 02:25:27.180]  and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend are traveling any place in the world and a child is born,
[02:25:27.180 --> 02:25:30.700]  if both are U.S. citizens, their child, when it comes back through immigration,
[02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:35.660]  and gets a passport, is considered natural born. The statute here, which was changed
[02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:40.540]  when Obama was supposedly born on August 4, 1961, the American citizen, in this case,
[02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:45.500]  the mother, had to convey natural born status, had to live in this country for 10 years,
[02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:51.020]  and five of his years had to be after the age of 14. Fourteen at five is 19. She was only 18.
[02:25:51.020 --> 02:25:54.940]  So she couldn't convey natural born. So we've got them right there. I mean,
[02:25:56.060 --> 02:26:00.300]  we have all over the place. The guys are fraud. The guys are phony.
[02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:04.620]  His real name's Barry Sataro. Bob in Texas. Bob, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:13.420]  Yeah, I have two quick comments. The comment for Mr. Berg was that back before the election,
[02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:20.060]  I actually thought I was able to get through and talk to John Moody, the vice president of Fox News
[02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:24.620]  and his excuse for them not covering it, is that it's quote unquote, not their job,
[02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:26.860]  and that people shouldn't be lazy and do the work themselves.
[02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:31.260]  Which I found pretty funny. Your phone's really mad. Do you have a question?
[02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:38.780]  No, just just comment. Thank you. That's an interesting comment because Fox is not their job.
[02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:43.180]  A fox, a very strange, they came out of New York about an hour and a half driving down here,
[02:26:43.180 --> 02:26:47.020]  filming for an hour and a half, went back to New York, never aired one minute of it.
[02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:52.220]  But then if it's not their job, then how come all the media, including Fox, ripped apart,
[02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:55.340]  and maybe Fox didn't do it, but all the other media ripped apart Sarah Palin.
[02:26:56.380 --> 02:27:02.940]  Well, now Fox is going after you great guns with the Berther thing. I mean, it's incredible, folks.
[02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:08.300]  I mean, that is wrong. Phil Berg, even if he was wrong, has a right to ask these questions.
[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:11.980]  This is outrageous that Glenbeck's doing that. And I don't want to attack Glenbeck,
[02:27:11.980 --> 02:27:15.660]  but I'm sick of him. Okay, let's talk to John in Wisconsin.
[02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:17.340]  John, you're on the air with Phil Berg. Go ahead.
[02:27:18.140 --> 02:27:21.740]  It's Mr. Berg. Are you still looking for someone with a common ancestor?
[02:27:21.740 --> 02:27:24.860]  And that would convey a material interest in the birth certificate.
[02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:27.580]  Sure. Sure. Are you with anyone?
[02:27:27.580 --> 02:27:31.340]  Yeah, I have a common ancestor. Disadvantages of being a Mayflower family.
[02:27:31.340 --> 02:27:32.860]  There are only so many ways you want to contact them.
[02:27:32.860 --> 02:27:34.940]  Well, that may have to do with it. We'll see what we can do with it.
[02:27:34.940 --> 02:27:37.900]  They're probably, they're probably won't come up with some excuse, but...
[02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:41.420]  Yeah, that's too far back. I mean, if he's related to the Mayflower,
[02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:43.900]  then I'm related to Obama on both sides of my family.
[02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:47.100]  Yeah, that's true too. They're probably too far back, but contact me.
[02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:48.300]  We'll see what we can do. Thank you.
[02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:51.500]  All right, sir. Thanks for the call. Let's talk to George in Connecticut.
[02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:53.020]  You're on the air with Phil Berg. Go ahead.
[02:27:53.660 --> 02:27:59.100]  Hey, Alex. I know you're a hard man to get through too far at four times, but anyway,
[02:27:59.100 --> 02:28:02.780]  the main point is both you guys should try to sue through the English court,
[02:28:02.780 --> 02:28:06.940]  through them trying to slander you, whatever, especially for you with the financial times,
[02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:10.540]  because you don't even have to prove that they slandered you.
[02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:14.860]  They have to prove that they innocently, or they were innocent of not slandering you.
[02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:20.620]  And then being they do Murdoch papers and magazines and institutions,
[02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:24.140]  guaranteed their rebroadcast there. You can sue their pants off and own them,
[02:28:24.140 --> 02:28:27.500]  and then use their own money to kick their ass all over the world.
[02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:31.660]  George, it's a good point. You have been slandered by the Murdoch papers in England.
[02:28:31.660 --> 02:28:34.860]  I've seen it, and I have as well. What about that?
[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:38.380]  Interesting point. I'm swamped right with the Obama thing,
[02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:41.820]  but we'll have to consider that for you and me, Alex.
[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:43.580]  I would do something to get the money out of these people,
[02:28:43.580 --> 02:28:48.780]  but I'm more concerned right now with using my efforts to out Obama or Barrister Toro,
[02:28:48.780 --> 02:28:50.300]  and we'll worry about you.
[02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:52.780]  Yeah, that's the big fish. That's the big fish we've got to fry.
[02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:56.300]  Jamming in, one more call. Chris and Marilyn, you're on the air.
[02:28:57.820 --> 02:29:02.460]  You guys. Hey, fellas, it's my understanding. Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong,
[02:29:02.460 --> 02:29:07.340]  but I had a discussion with my dad, but the real issue isn't your hand at ease in your Glenn Beck.
[02:29:07.340 --> 02:29:10.780]  Isn't the real problem the progressives that are taking over our nation?
[02:29:11.500 --> 02:29:14.780]  Absolutely, but the problem is Beck supported the banker bailout.
[02:29:14.780 --> 02:29:19.180]  Beck says global warming is real now. We've discredited the fake liberals.
[02:29:19.180 --> 02:29:24.780]  I'm attacking anybody who's unconstitutional, and what's your point there?
[02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:30.460]  The point is that the progressives, and I believe maybe a hundred percent of the Democrats
[02:29:30.460 --> 02:29:35.500]  and the majority of the Republicans together are all progressive in destroying the Constitution.
[02:29:35.500 --> 02:29:37.980]  They're after the Constitution. All right, listen, I got to let you go,
[02:29:37.980 --> 02:29:40.300]  because that's not really a question on this issue.
[02:29:40.300 --> 02:29:44.220]  Phil Bird, we got Lindsey Williams coming up, and I'm going to get him to hold a few minutes.
[02:29:44.220 --> 02:29:46.860]  I'm sure he's fine, because we've got an hour and a half with him coming up.
[02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:50.540]  I want to come back and take some calls. One guy disagrees. Ted, North Carolina.
[02:29:51.660 --> 02:29:54.700]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.500 --> 02:29:58.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.380 --> 02:30:05.820]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food. Well, here's an unbelievable chance

[02:32:05.740 --> 02:32:10.540]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:32:10.540 --> 02:32:16.220]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. We've turned a tremendous influence
[02:32:16.220 --> 02:32:21.980]  on our president and Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon
[02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:28.060]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of
[02:32:28.060 --> 02:32:34.060]  our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:32:34.060 --> 02:32:38.540]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[02:32:38.540 --> 02:32:43.180]  more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody
[02:32:43.180 --> 02:32:50.060]  does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy

[02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:18.620]  infowars.com. These are awesome jeans. I got several pairs. I'm going to start wearing these
[02:33:18.620 --> 02:33:24.300]  exclusively. They fit just like Levi's. Last longer and they're made in America. So check out
[02:33:24.300 --> 02:33:35.420]  their website up at infowars.com or just Google Gusset Jeans. Okay. I saw this late last week
[02:33:36.860 --> 02:33:42.700]  and it really upset me because sure, they look like real guns. You can buy an M16. You can buy
[02:33:42.700 --> 02:33:48.380]  something that looks like an AK-47. You can buy stuff that looks like a Beretta handgun.
[02:33:48.380 --> 02:33:55.180]  They shoot little plastic pellets. So they're not even BB guns. It's a little bit bigger pellet
[02:33:55.180 --> 02:34:01.020]  than a BB about three times the size. I bought quite a few of these guns to train my five-year-old
[02:34:01.020 --> 02:34:09.820]  daughter and seven-year-old son on marksmanship in the backyard. And the ATF in Cornelius, Oregon
[02:34:10.540 --> 02:34:18.140]  went in to one of the local dealers of Airsoft plastic pellet guns that they have no statutory
[02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:26.700]  authority, nothing. Went in, took the guns from Customs. It turns out Customs called them
[02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:33.260]  the toy guns and are now claiming that they can just basically outside of law
[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:41.020]  rule what is a firearm. And we see cases where somebody's got an AR-15 that they bought legal.
[02:34:41.020 --> 02:34:46.060]  It has a malfunction. Fires two or three rounds. The shooting range calls the police on them.
[02:34:46.060 --> 02:34:51.980]  And in federal court, they say it doesn't matter. Even if you knew, you know, didn't know and it was
[02:34:51.980 --> 02:34:59.660]  a legal gun, you're going to prison. So the ATF is harassing lawful gun owners. Now they're
[02:34:59.660 --> 02:35:03.180]  raiding people every day. I see in the news neighbors will see somebody with a rifle put
[02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:08.220]  in their car at their house. The police come, they find five guns, a thousand rounds of ammo.
[02:35:08.220 --> 02:35:12.940]  There's no law against an arsenal. They call an arsenal. They take your guns, arrest you.
[02:35:12.940 --> 02:35:22.780]  Without a law. And so we're joined by Brad Martin of Airsoft. And we'll give you his
[02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:29.740]  website here specifically from Oregon. But he and his son run this toy store. And these are
[02:35:29.740 --> 02:35:35.500]  sold in Walmart. These are sold in Academy. These are sold most hardware stores, hunting supply
[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:41.420]  stores. I mean, this is ridiculous. And for them to say you can cartridge and could build
[02:35:41.420 --> 02:35:46.460]  a real gun out of this because it looks like a gun. I mean, it's asinine. I mean, yeah,
[02:35:46.460 --> 02:35:50.460]  if you spent two or three times the money it takes to make it, I mean, to buy a real gun,
[02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:55.260]  maybe you couldn't blow up in your face. So he joins us to talk about all the different facets
[02:35:55.900 --> 02:36:02.700]  and angles of this and how this is just being selectively enforced. And even the selective
[02:36:02.700 --> 02:36:10.220]  enforcement is just made up. And if this is allowed to stand, it sets an incredibly dangerous
[02:36:10.220 --> 02:36:16.460]  precedent. Because if they can ban BB guns that shoot plastic BBs, what's going to happen to
[02:36:16.460 --> 02:36:22.060]  the deadly red rider? Will it be banned as an assault weapon? So we now speak to our guest,
[02:36:22.060 --> 02:36:25.980]  Brad Martin. Brad, break down exactly what happened in all the latest developments for us.
[02:36:26.540 --> 02:36:34.220]  Well, hi there, Mr. Jones. Yeah, this started back in October of 09. We import airsoft
[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:41.980]  toy guns and airsoft equipment to go along with those. And over the last five or six years,
[02:36:41.980 --> 02:36:47.340]  we've had several interventions from customs where they've taken in the vicinity of about
[02:36:47.340 --> 02:36:54.300]  $17,000 worth of product from us. And, you know, I haven't really made a big issue out of it,
[02:36:54.300 --> 02:37:03.420]  we just took our mix and kept on keeping on sort of. But bottom line is this most recent
[02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:16.300]  seizure in October was of 30 gas-powered M4 lookalikes. And these pieces are 100% legitimate
[02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:23.100]  that they're designed to fire these quarter-inch plastic BBs, as you described, and that's their
[02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:31.580]  function. Well, when customs received these, one or two of their agents looked at them and decided
[02:37:31.580 --> 02:37:37.580]  that it was above their pay grade to make a call on these things. So they called in the ATF to
[02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:44.140]  look at them. So ATF took one or more of these things back to their laboratory in Maryland,
[02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:49.020]  or wherever this thing is, held them for five months. And then in early February,
[02:37:50.380 --> 02:37:56.140]  after I had mailed some protest letters to the ATF and customs, I finally got a response back
[02:37:56.140 --> 02:38:02.780]  saying that I was not going to get these toy guns back. And they quoted a code,
[02:38:05.020 --> 02:38:11.980]  there's code number 922. And it seems that the thing that they're seizing upon is that
[02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:18.860]  these toy guns are easily convertible to real steel firearms. So in other words, you're saying
[02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:25.980]  anybody with a little bit of effort can take these guns, these toys and turn them into real guns.
[02:38:25.980 --> 02:38:28.380]  And from our perspective, this is just totally absurd.
[02:38:31.980 --> 02:38:35.020]  Because they look like real guns.
[02:38:36.380 --> 02:38:43.980]  Yeah. Yeah. The other day, the port director from customs in Seattle called all the local TV
[02:38:43.980 --> 02:38:54.060]  affiliates in and gave this news conference on air holding one of our guns and saying that this
[02:38:54.060 --> 02:38:59.420]  is a threat to the safety of America. And these are, he labeled them as machine guns. And while
[02:38:59.420 --> 02:39:04.460]  he was talking and handling this gun of ours, his toy of ours, he was trying to stick the
[02:39:04.460 --> 02:39:10.940]  magazine into the magwell. And he had the, he had the magazine turned around backwards. He
[02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:16.220]  didn't even know which way the bloody magwell. We're going to play a clip of this coming up.
[02:39:16.220 --> 02:39:20.460]  We're going to play a clip of this coming up. You've got the ATF agent putting on this big
[02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:29.100]  hullabaloo trying to scare everybody to set the precedent to ban something that isn't even a BB
[02:39:29.100 --> 02:39:34.700]  gun because it looks scary to them. My God, if this is allowed to stand, this is an incredible
[02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:41.100]  new precedent. Well, it is. It is scary. You know, and this is a David and Goliath scenario where,
[02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:46.220]  you know, I could bankrupt myself, fight in the federal government, still end up a loser here.
[02:39:46.220 --> 02:39:51.020]  But, you know, it's time for us to stir up the pod a little bit and kind of try to put the brakes
[02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:59.660]  on this behavior. We're going to play this video that's up on your website for the
[02:39:59.660 --> 02:40:04.780]  prisonplanet.tv viewers and radio listeners. Give us your web address for folks that want to follow
[02:40:04.780 --> 02:40:17.900]  this case. Okay, sure. The web address is airsoftoutletnw.com. So airsoftoutletnorthwest.com,
[02:40:17.900 --> 02:40:24.940]  just N-W. Yeah, just N-W, not the Northwest. Just N-W. All right. We're going to play one of the
[02:40:24.940 --> 02:40:33.260]  myriad of newscasts trying to create a panic over the devilish plastic BB gun that is so
[02:40:33.260 --> 02:40:39.420]  scary looking. Here it is. And welcome, everyone, and good evening. I'm Jeff Giannola. And I'm Kelly
[02:40:39.420 --> 02:40:45.260]  Day. Federal agents seize a ship of toy guns, they say in the wrong hands, they could have actually
[02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:49.820]  been deadly. In this coin local six exclusive, our reporter, Alexis Delcitte, talked to the
[02:40:49.820 --> 02:40:54.300]  local businessman who ordered these toy guns. And I see you have one there, huh, Alexis? Jeff,
[02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:59.100]  this is an example of one of the toy guns seized. And besides the orange chip, it looks pretty real.
[02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:04.620]  But this is an airsoft toy. It shoots plastic BBs. And the man who ordered these says anyone
[02:41:04.620 --> 02:41:13.420]  with any knowledge of weapons should be able to figure that out. No bullets, just plastic BBs,
[02:41:13.420 --> 02:41:18.300]  not a battlefield, just a wooded area made to look like one. It's another version of paintball.
[02:41:18.300 --> 02:41:22.780]  For the past seven years, Brad Martin and his son, Ben, say their family business in Cornelius
[02:41:22.780 --> 02:41:28.620]  has steadily grown as simulated combat gaming grows in popularity across the country.
[02:41:28.620 --> 02:41:33.980]  This is the contemporary version of civil war reenacting. While they aim for authenticity
[02:41:33.980 --> 02:41:39.500]  in every piece of gear, the Martin's didn't anticipate a seizure by customs and ATF agents
[02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:46.700]  in Tacoma as their latest shipment of toy guns arrived from Taiwan. Any kid, any parent, any adult
[02:41:47.260 --> 02:41:54.380]  going out of the house with this needs to be ready for trouble. ATF special agent,
[02:41:54.380 --> 02:41:59.980]  Kelvin Crenshaw says not only is the shipment missing the orange tips required on all imported
[02:41:59.980 --> 02:42:08.380]  toy guns. With minimal work, it could be converted to a machine gun. To say these are readily convertible
[02:42:08.380 --> 02:42:12.620]  to machine guns is absolutely posturous. The round wouldn't go into the barrel for one and two if
[02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:16.780]  the firing pin did strike the primer, the gun would basically blow up in your face. Also,
[02:42:16.780 --> 02:42:21.980]  the Martin's say there are tens of thousands of replicas just like these sold in America already.
[02:42:21.980 --> 02:42:26.300]  The only reason they buy from Taiwan is because it's cheaper. Until now.
[02:42:26.300 --> 02:42:35.180]  He spent all this manpower, tax dollars, and time and wasted my time, my money, my profitability
[02:42:35.980 --> 02:42:42.380]  to seize 30 toy guns. That's what he's done. And he's portrayed himself as a great hero.
[02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:48.540]  But ATF insists that it did the testing and determined that yes, these can be converted
[02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:52.700]  into military-grade weapons. The Martin's requested to see the documentation of that,
[02:42:52.700 --> 02:42:57.180]  and they were told that they'd have to file a freedom of information request with ATF.
[02:42:57.180 --> 02:43:01.580]  Now, as for the orange tips, this one has one of the ones that came in from Taiwan,
[02:43:01.580 --> 02:43:04.780]  didn't, but the Martin's say that's happened before with their shipments from Taiwan,
[02:43:04.780 --> 02:43:09.420]  and they just had to go up to Tacoma and paint the tips orange themselves. So they wonder
[02:43:09.420 --> 02:43:13.740]  why this is being made into an issue now. Alexis Del Cid, Coin Local 6.
[02:43:13.740 --> 02:43:20.780]  Okay. And we have Brad Martin online with us. So you've got an ATF officer in a fancy suit who
[02:43:20.780 --> 02:43:26.860]  can't even put the cartridge in it. He can't put the magazine in. It shoots little bitty, round,
[02:43:26.860 --> 02:43:32.700]  plastic BBs that look like they're even smaller than 22 caliber. There's no room for a cartridge
[02:43:32.700 --> 02:43:39.180]  to go in. There's no room for propellant. He uses air to shoot plastic BBs. And what's really
[02:43:39.180 --> 02:43:43.020]  happening, I saw this five years ago or so in England, where they're trying to ban these over
[02:43:43.020 --> 02:43:48.860]  there, they don't like the gun culture growing because this is a gateway to real firearms.
[02:43:48.860 --> 02:43:54.540]  People are finding out how much fun it is to target shoot or to dress up in gear and go to
[02:43:54.540 --> 02:44:01.900]  the equivalent of paintball ranges. I run around with my children in the backyard and shoot targets
[02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:07.100]  and shoot 10 cans. And you learn how to be a good marksman, then they graduate to BB guns,
[02:44:07.100 --> 02:44:13.420]  and they graduate to real firearms. And this is incredible. This is lawlessness. And you told
[02:44:13.420 --> 02:44:17.820]  me off air that you've talked to other ATF branches and they're like, we can't believe this happened.
[02:44:18.460 --> 02:44:24.540]  These aren't real firearms. We don't have a statutory authority, but it doesn't matter
[02:44:24.540 --> 02:44:29.820]  there in your area. They're just going to do whatever they want. And I guess if they don't
[02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:34.860]  have a law, they don't care because he says, you go outside with this, you're looking for trouble.
[02:44:34.860 --> 02:44:39.900]  He feels like you shouldn't have this as a slave. And so he's going to take them.
[02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:43.420]  That's the end of it. It doesn't matter if it's $30,000 shipment. It doesn't matter
[02:44:43.420 --> 02:44:50.780]  because they run this country now. Yep, that's exactly right. After about three months of this
[02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:57.260]  senior going on, I started writing letters and calling people. I talked to an agent back in
[02:44:57.260 --> 02:45:06.140]  Maryland, I believe it was, who was in the ATF division of firearms importations. And I explained
[02:45:06.140 --> 02:45:12.940]  the situation to her and she said, well, why did ATF take Airsoft? And I said, well, I guess because
[02:45:12.940 --> 02:45:19.820]  they can. And she said, well, ATF has no jurisdiction over, over Airsoft. And if you would like to,
[02:45:19.820 --> 02:45:26.140]  if you would give my telephone number, meaning her telephone number to the local ATF people
[02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:32.140]  and tell them to call her, she would inform them that they have no jurisdiction over Airsoft.
[02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:37.420]  Now again, I didn't dissuade them. We're going to, oh, that didn't dissuade them. So, so, no, no.
[02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:44.940]  So, so, so explain who you separately talked to at ATF, who was, what her position is and then
[02:45:44.940 --> 02:45:49.900]  what they said because we want to write an article about this. Yeah, well, exactly. And I can provide
[02:45:49.900 --> 02:45:55.980]  you with a phone number at some future. I don't have it with me right here. But as I mentioned, after
[02:45:55.980 --> 02:46:02.940]  going through, after calling the ATF back east and explaining my situation to about four or five
[02:46:02.940 --> 02:46:10.300]  people, I finally got to this agent in, as I mentioned, the division of firearms importation.
[02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:18.300]  And I explained it to her and she said, we have no, we have no jurisdiction over Airsoft.
[02:46:18.300 --> 02:46:24.380]  So, well, sir, the ATF controls by, by ruling. That's, that's what they do. They, they see
[02:46:24.380 --> 02:46:29.980]  something. They don't need a law about it. They just make a ruling. Yeah, let me, let me expand
[02:46:29.980 --> 02:46:36.460]  on that. Let me expand on that. Yeah, this is a commerce issue. You've been robbed when an officer,
[02:46:36.460 --> 02:46:42.620]  federal or state operates clearly outside their jurisdiction consciously through color of law.
[02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:48.300]  You have been physically robbed. And so you file a criminal police report that you've been robbed.
[02:46:49.420 --> 02:46:54.860]  Well, in essence, I wrote to, I wrote to them and I said, you know, what's happening with this
[02:46:54.860 --> 02:46:59.740]  shipment? Why am I getting no information about this? Because they're included. They're incredibly
[02:46:59.740 --> 02:47:04.780]  secretive. They don't, they don't give you any information. No judge, no jury, no indictment,
[02:47:04.780 --> 02:47:11.980]  no interview, no arrest, no paperwork, just your 30,000 of toy guns is gone, pal. We don't need
[02:47:11.980 --> 02:47:17.980]  no stinking warrants or paperwork. We rule America. You don't sell toy guns around here, boy.
[02:47:19.100 --> 02:47:23.980]  Absolutely. That's right. And I figured that if they really thought my guns were machine guns,
[02:47:23.980 --> 02:47:29.500]  like they said they were, I'd be in handcuffs by now, but they're not down here arresting me.
[02:47:31.020 --> 02:47:37.660]  And they're not in other vendors stores. This is sold at Walmart Academy,
[02:47:37.660 --> 02:47:44.300]  everywhere, the exact same fake M16 plastic toy guns. People are running around with these,
[02:47:44.300 --> 02:47:50.940]  having a great time and it's buoying the gun culture. And I think this is an ATF case on purpose
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:56.460]  from the Obama administration. We confirmed in Austin, they shut down a gun show with no law
[02:47:56.460 --> 02:48:01.740]  to set a national precedent. And I believe they picked you as a small independent dealer
[02:48:01.740 --> 02:48:08.140]  to set the precedent. It wouldn't surprise me at all. Yes, sir. I agree with you. Well,
[02:48:09.580 --> 02:48:13.900]  give out your website again for legal eagles, lawyers on the West Coast,
[02:48:13.900 --> 02:48:19.980]  other people that want to bring civil rights suits, commerce suits, robbery suits, criminal charges.
[02:48:19.980 --> 02:48:24.620]  Because we have a lot of experts out there that are listening that would want to email you advice.
[02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:33.500]  Yeah, nothing would please me more. My website is www.airsoftoutletnw.com.
[02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:39.340]  Now, tell people, Brad Martin, when this first happened and any new developments because,
[02:48:39.340 --> 02:48:44.300]  you know, we're quite a few days into this. And I guess they say, look, talk to the hand.
[02:48:44.300 --> 02:48:47.820]  You don't get paperwork. You don't get anything. We just rob you.
[02:48:47.820 --> 02:48:54.220]  Well, that's, you know, that's basically it. Now, I spoke to an ATF agent up in Tacoma
[02:48:54.780 --> 02:49:00.860]  all week or 10 days ago. And this guy, this guy had his head screwed on straight. I think
[02:49:00.860 --> 02:49:09.100]  there are some really good agents in the company, basically. But the anti-gun
[02:49:09.100 --> 02:49:15.420]  influence is so strong that I think these sensible guys just shouted down that I was talking to him.
[02:49:15.420 --> 02:49:22.060]  And he said that he said that basically Customs has me on a hit list now that any time one of my
[02:49:22.060 --> 02:49:27.260]  orders hits port, they're going to flag my order. They're going to take it for intensive
[02:49:27.260 --> 02:49:33.180]  examination. And right now they have two more of my orders backed up in port for intensive
[02:49:33.180 --> 02:49:38.300]  examination. Whoa, they're going to put you out of business. They got a $30,000 order and just
[02:49:38.300 --> 02:49:44.540]  grabbed it with the ATF. What have they gotten now? Oh, they've got about another 20,000 in there now.
[02:49:44.540 --> 02:49:50.780]  Yeah, another 20,000. Unbelievable. Well, people need to all over the country order the guns you've
[02:49:50.780 --> 02:49:55.980]  got and stock the plastic toy pellet guns just to keep you afloat because that's one thing I
[02:49:55.980 --> 02:50:00.860]  noticed the feds will do. They'll just ruin you to set the precedent, pick a little guy,
[02:50:00.860 --> 02:50:05.660]  and then hope you just go away. Yeah, well, we're not going to go away. You know, you piss off a
[02:50:05.660 --> 02:50:10.300]  Scotsman and they're going to fight back. So I'm kind of fed up with their behavior.
[02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:16.460]  I don't know if I can generate enough income to take the feds to court or not, but I'm going to
[02:50:16.460 --> 02:50:24.140]  look at that. And I don't know if the NRA or other gun groups could take up interest in this
[02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:29.340]  and have talked. We've got Larry Pratt on what is it is Pratt on Thursday,
[02:50:30.140 --> 02:50:33.740]  head of gun owners of America. We're going to get, believe me,
[02:50:33.740 --> 02:50:39.740]  Jews for preservation of firearms or the gunners of America is going to want to help you. We've got
[02:50:39.740 --> 02:50:46.140]  the ATF red handed here in lawlessness, color of law, shanghai, free booting.
[02:50:47.740 --> 02:50:50.940]  This is the same as just robbing a stagecoach. I mean, they are bandits
[02:50:51.500 --> 02:50:55.740]  here and if the precedent gets set by customs and these guys, we're all in deep trouble. We've
[02:50:55.740 --> 02:51:00.140]  got to hang together or we'll surely hang separate. One more segment, sir. Stay right there.

[02:52:17.020 --> 02:52:23.020]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[02:52:23.020 --> 02:52:29.020]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. For all the republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:52:29.020 --> 02:52:35.500]  nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[02:52:35.500 --> 02:52:40.460]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the
[02:52:40.460 --> 02:52:45.180]  Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right

[02:55:14.140 --> 02:55:19.740]  I mean, this is like more than Orwellian. It's surreal, like a comedy. The news, holding up a
[02:55:19.740 --> 02:55:25.740]  gun with a red tip, a little toy, toy plastic machine gun saying, oh my gosh, it's so scary.
[02:55:25.740 --> 02:55:31.260]  And an ATF guy will put his picture up there looking like he's in deep fear over all this.
[02:55:31.260 --> 02:55:33.980]  I mean, if they can get toy guns, nothing safe.
[02:55:35.740 --> 02:55:40.780]  It's true, the truth. You know, I was talking, I went over to the local coffee shop for a cup this
[02:55:40.780 --> 02:55:50.140]  morning and the police chief from our town was in there and off the record, not as police chief,
[02:55:50.140 --> 02:55:57.260]  but he's 100% behind us on this. And he and I were talking and he was saying that Americans
[02:55:57.260 --> 02:56:03.340]  are afraid of everything. And the government wants to protect us from everything that's even
[02:56:03.340 --> 02:56:08.860]  a little bit scary. And basically, that's what's happening here. You know, this creeping totalitarianism
[02:56:08.860 --> 02:56:14.700]  of the government wanting to have their fingers and control everything. And it's just, it's just
[02:56:14.700 --> 02:56:18.220]  got to stop somewhere. I don't know where it stops, but we got to do stuff about it. Well,
[02:56:18.220 --> 02:56:24.700]  look at this ATF officer. What is his name? Clevin throwing back up on screen. Clevin Crenshaw.
[02:56:24.700 --> 02:56:28.860]  I mean, he's in what looks like a $2,000 suit taxpayer paid for.
[02:56:30.140 --> 02:56:32.220]  That's a beautiful suit he's wearing. I gotta say that.
[02:56:33.020 --> 02:56:38.460]  I mean, this is a stunt for him, a stunt from the ATF guaranteed Obama's pushing this.
[02:56:39.020 --> 02:56:46.700]  And he's here trampling on your right to commerce. They've now got $50,000 of your toy guns.
[02:56:46.700 --> 02:56:52.300]  And they just think you're not even human. I mean, taking, doing this to you, it's like you
[02:56:52.300 --> 02:56:59.900]  don't even exist. That's so true. You know, it's like since when does it, is it a crime against
[02:56:59.900 --> 02:57:07.580]  a vendor who brings in a legal product and somebody somewhere, some wacko decides that
[02:57:07.580 --> 02:57:13.420]  he's going to convert that legal product into something illegal. Why does that make it the
[02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:20.940]  vendors crime that he's brought in a legal product? And by the way, I own some of these.
[02:57:20.940 --> 02:57:26.460]  I mean, it converts something that's air powered and it doesn't even have the mechanism to, you
[02:57:26.460 --> 02:57:31.500]  know, put in a cartridge that has powder that projects it. I mean, this is asinine. I mean,
[02:57:32.220 --> 02:57:36.620]  I mean, sure, if you went to a top machinist, maybe they could build something that would chamber
[02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:42.540]  around, but then this is 10 metal, it would blow up. Well, that's, that's our point too.
[02:57:42.540 --> 02:57:52.540]  And, and if, if a guy wanted an AR-15 or an M4, he could go to his local gun store and pay a
[02:57:52.540 --> 02:57:59.100]  thousand bucks and get a dependable platform. Instead of going to an airsoft store and paying
[02:57:59.100 --> 02:58:05.660]  probably around $500 for this product, spending all kinds of time and energy trying to convert
[02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:10.860]  this into a gun that's going to blow it up into his face. It's totally illogical. This is
[02:58:10.860 --> 02:58:15.580]  you agree with me though, that they've been trying to kill the gun culture and that airsoft
[02:58:15.580 --> 02:58:21.340]  is literally one of the, and I noticed this years ago, one of the key things getting people into
[02:58:21.340 --> 02:58:26.220]  the gun culture. I think you're right. I think they're scared. I think they're scared of an
[02:58:26.220 --> 02:58:30.940]  armed electorate is what they're scared of. I tell you what, I know you've got to go,
[02:58:30.940 --> 02:58:35.180]  but we're going to break for one minute. Let's do five more so we can talk about this creeping
[02:58:35.180 --> 02:58:41.660]  totalitarianism with you. Then it's open phones and news blitz for the rest of the final hour.
[02:58:52.700 --> 02:58:56.700]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:58:56.700 --> 02:59:01.660]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[02:59:01.660 --> 02:59:07.100]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first
[02:59:07.100 --> 02:59:12.220]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses
[02:59:12.220 --> 02:59:18.140]  the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the
[02:59:18.140 --> 02:59:23.980]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the sale
[02:59:23.980 --> 02:59:29.500]  of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the
[02:59:29.500 --> 02:59:34.460]  Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided,
[02:59:34.460 --> 02:59:40.940]  making production fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn
[02:59:40.940 --> 03:00:00.220]  more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:00:11.340 --> 03:00:19.820]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas,
[03:00:20.540 --> 03:00:30.700]  Alex Jones. We are live, ladies and gentlemen, one hour into this Wednesday, 17th day of February
[03:00:30.700 --> 03:00:36.700]  2010 worldwide broadcast on the AMFM Global Shortwave Satellite number one show on the
[03:00:36.700 --> 03:00:43.260]  internet, according to Alexis, Shoutcast and other gauges. Thank you for joining us for the next hour.
[03:00:43.260 --> 03:00:51.820]  Lord Christopher Moncton, the third Viscount of Moncton and Brinchley, a journalist, a researcher,
[03:00:51.820 --> 03:00:57.180]  a scientist, a consultant, one of the top advisors to Margaret Thatcher. We're very honored to have
[03:00:57.180 --> 03:01:02.140]  him. He just got back from a whirlwind tour of Australia with devastating effect on the fraud
[03:01:02.140 --> 03:01:10.220]  there. Rudd collapsing as the global warming fraud continues to fall in on itself. Huge
[03:01:10.220 --> 03:01:16.460]  developments. We're going to cover more than 30 climate-gate-level scandals that have come out,
[03:01:16.460 --> 03:01:21.820]  each overshadowing the next or the last. We're also going to cover their counter-strike plans.
[03:01:21.820 --> 03:01:25.100]  As Schwarzenegger and others said at Copenhagen, when it was clear it was dead,
[03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:30.140]  they're going to take over the cities and states. Austin faces $2.6 billion in the next three years
[03:01:30.140 --> 03:01:34.860]  in taxes on energy alone, according to Austin Energy and the mayor. They're set later this
[03:01:34.860 --> 03:01:39.980]  month or early next month to vote it through. The UN is involved here locally. So we're going to
[03:01:39.980 --> 03:01:46.140]  look at it all today, also criminal prosecutions of these frauds. Phil Jones, one of the head
[03:01:46.140 --> 03:01:52.460]  masters at collating the fraudulent data, admitting now that Lord Moncton is right since 1995, no
[03:01:52.460 --> 03:01:57.580]  warming. So we're going to go to break here in a moment. But for the next hour, Lord Christopher
[03:01:57.580 --> 03:02:05.580]  Moncton to chronicle and break down, as no one else can, the leading expert in my educated opinion
[03:02:05.580 --> 03:02:12.300]  on the full scope of this attempted revolution to bring society under neo-futilistic serfdom. Sir,
[03:02:12.300 --> 03:02:16.700]  thank you for joining us. Well, Alex, what a wonderful introduction. I just can't wait to hear
[03:02:16.700 --> 03:02:23.260]  what I'm going to say. We've got about two and a half minutes before we go to break. Just give us
[03:02:23.260 --> 03:02:27.500]  a brief overview of what you're going to be covering. Well, I think the first thing we've got to do is to
[03:02:27.500 --> 03:02:33.180]  say that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that the UN climate panel, which produced
[03:02:33.180 --> 03:02:39.900]  four major reports on the climate thing we're all doomed, is now effectively dead. There have been
[03:02:39.900 --> 03:02:47.820]  so many revelations over recent weeks of its failure to do the science properly, of it deliberately
[03:02:47.820 --> 03:02:54.780]  including false and alarming data with the intention, as a declared intention of influencing
[03:02:54.780 --> 03:03:01.660]  government, is all over for the IPCC. Nobody is going to take it seriously ever again. I think
[03:03:01.660 --> 03:03:06.540]  that's the main point. But then you're quite right. As you said in your introduction, the problem we've
[03:03:06.540 --> 03:03:13.260]  now got is that even though national governments are now beginning to realize they can't go on
[03:03:13.260 --> 03:03:21.180]  getting away with this because it isn't a vote winner, local administrations still bullied by
[03:03:21.180 --> 03:03:27.900]  the hugely well-funded environmental lobby groups like Greenpeace, which as far as I know has a fleet
[03:03:27.900 --> 03:03:31.900]  of ships larger than the British Navy. Goodness knows where it gets the money from to run them,
[03:03:31.900 --> 03:03:37.820]  but I thought one of their huge ships parked up in Copenhagen with propaganda slogans painted
[03:03:37.820 --> 03:03:44.220]  all over it. These organizations are very active at local and state level and what we're going to
[03:03:44.220 --> 03:03:51.020]  need to do eventually is at government level simply ban any spending on global warming-related
[03:03:51.020 --> 03:04:00.540]  matters because this care is now officially dead. I want you again today to address the criminal
[03:04:00.540 --> 03:04:06.140]  activities, criminal investigations, your continued challenge for Al Gore to debate you.
[03:04:06.140 --> 03:04:11.420]  Thank you. I have it out of the Dallas Morning News today. The state of Texas is moving to block
[03:04:11.420 --> 03:04:18.380]  Austin and other cities that have literally been paid off by these organizations to seize
[03:04:18.380 --> 03:04:25.260]  the infrastructure and levy taxes. I mean, the 2.6 billion and that's Austin Energy is bigger
[03:04:25.820 --> 03:04:32.220]  per year over the three years in the entire current taxing system. I mean, talk about a power grab.
[03:04:32.220 --> 03:04:38.460]  That's right. It is outrageous what's going on and the only way to do that is to stop it
[03:04:38.460 --> 03:04:45.420]  from the top down so that eventually everybody realizes that this money-making game at the
[03:04:45.420 --> 03:04:51.980]  expense chiefly of the working taxpayer is your blue collar guy, the guy on whose back, on whose
[03:04:51.980 --> 03:04:56.140]  sweater is browsed, the rest of us live so comfortably. It's he who is going to get
[03:04:56.140 --> 03:05:02.620]  marmalade and club it. Stay there, Lord Moncton. Got a break. This is Alex Jones with five good
[03:05:02.620 --> 03:05:07.660]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation
[03:05:07.660 --> 03:05:12.700]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control
[03:05:12.700 --> 03:05:17.740]  how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of
[03:05:17.740 --> 03:05:22.940]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the
[03:05:22.940 --> 03:05:28.300]  country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only
[03:05:28.300 --> 03:05:33.340]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every
[03:05:33.340 --> 03:05:38.300]  year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power
[03:05:38.300 --> 03:05:43.020]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[03:05:43.020 --> 03:05:48.060]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors. You can get more information
[03:05:48.060 --> 03:05:54.940]  at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,

They'll take orders from now until March 22nd. The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program. Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see. Another example, buy nine months worth of food and get three months free. You've got to go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[03:08:01.540 --> 03:08:13.540]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[03:08:13.540 --> 03:08:23.540]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:23.540 --> 03:08:27.540]  We are live. Lord Christopher Moncton is our guest.
[03:08:27.540 --> 03:08:32.540]  We'll put his website that is invaluable research, understand this criminal group internationally,
[03:08:32.540 --> 03:08:41.540]  seeking to really bring in a form of slavery, scienceandpublicpolicy.org, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:41.540 --> 03:08:52.540]  We're going to cover a whole host of issues as Lord Moncton briefs us on the open collapse of the carbon tax area of the fake green movement.
[03:08:52.540 --> 03:08:59.540]  But first, sir, and of course, they're regrouping. We'll talk about that. Tell us about the success of your trip in Australia.
[03:08:59.540 --> 03:09:11.540]  I, every day, tuned into video clips of you on radio and TV, in debates, packed houses everywhere, hands down, trouncing the opposition.
[03:09:11.540 --> 03:09:21.540]  And you could see in their eyes no longer that arrogant, false aplomb that Hootspa, now they look like beaten men.
[03:09:21.540 --> 03:09:26.540]  They are in galloping retreat. It was very interesting. I mean, I arrived in Australia.
[03:09:26.540 --> 03:09:31.540]  Nobody there had heard of me, but there was a really good PR guy who came to see me the day I landed.
[03:09:31.540 --> 03:09:35.540]  He said, right, we've laid on a program for you to start going into studios.
[03:09:35.540 --> 03:09:42.540]  The moment that began, then I was rushing from studio to studio, got massive coverage on all the major channels,
[03:09:42.540 --> 03:09:47.540]  all the major newspapers, even the left-wing ones couldn't resist having a go at me, as it were.
[03:09:47.540 --> 03:09:55.540]  Then, on our first speaker meeting, which was in the largest ballroom in Sydney, which seats a thousand people,
[03:09:55.540 --> 03:10:04.540]  we were absolutely full. People had began queuing at 10 in the morning for a meeting that began at 5.30 in the afternoon.
[03:10:04.540 --> 03:10:10.540]  And they were queuing down three floors of the hotel, right around the Grand Staircase, and out into the street outside.
[03:10:10.540 --> 03:10:16.540]  We had to turn several hundred people away, unfortunately. Absolutely extraordinary interest.
[03:10:16.540 --> 03:10:23.540]  And this happened all over Australia. We went to the working-class district of Newcastle in the Hunter Valley,
[03:10:23.540 --> 03:10:27.540]  which is the coal mining area, and we had a small room booked in the town hall.
[03:10:27.540 --> 03:10:32.540]  We had to abandon that and go into the main town hall building itself, which seats a thousand.
[03:10:32.540 --> 03:10:37.540]  Then we had to open the gallery, which seats another few hundred, and even then we had to turn people away.
[03:10:37.540 --> 03:10:42.540]  Same thing happened in Brisbane. We had a debate there, which I think is the other side,
[03:10:42.540 --> 03:10:46.540]  I reckon we won it by a country mile. Then we had a meeting at the Irish Club there.
[03:10:46.540 --> 03:10:52.540]  They had never seen so many people in that club as they saw that day. Seven hundred of them jammed into the room.
[03:10:52.540 --> 03:10:58.540]  Then we went up to Noosa, where the deputy leader of the opposition in Parliament turned up to hear me,
[03:10:58.540 --> 03:11:04.540]  and he ended up outside not being able to get in, along with 250 people, because that too was packed out.
[03:11:04.540 --> 03:11:08.540]  So I had an impromptu meeting in the car park to cope with them.
[03:11:08.540 --> 03:11:12.540]  Then we went down to Melbourne. Same thing, absolutely packed out.
[03:11:12.540 --> 03:11:17.540]  A ballroom seating a thousand, absolutely full. Then we went up to Canberra,
[03:11:17.540 --> 03:11:21.540]  and the press club could only seat 300, and we turned at least as many as that away.
[03:11:21.540 --> 03:11:26.540]  Then we went down to Adelaide. Same thing happened there. We had an overflow room.
[03:11:26.540 --> 03:11:29.540]  That was full of well. We had to go speak in both rooms.
[03:11:29.540 --> 03:11:35.540]  Then we went up to Perth, where they had to lay on not only an overflow room,
[03:11:35.540 --> 03:11:40.540]  but an overflow meeting the following day, because 2,000 people wanted to hear me speak.
[03:11:40.540 --> 03:11:45.540]  And as we went around Australia, the crowds got bigger and also got younger.
[03:11:45.540 --> 03:11:49.540]  More and more younger people beginning to come to hear the truth about the climate.
[03:11:49.540 --> 03:11:55.540]  So a quite extraordinary overwhelming response, as a result of which I got to meet the leader of the opposition,
[03:11:55.540 --> 03:12:00.540]  Tony Abbott, who, if you remember, won office as leader of the opposition,
[03:12:00.540 --> 03:12:05.540]  over Malcolm Turnbull, his rival, who had previously supported Australia's attempt
[03:12:05.540 --> 03:12:11.540]  to have a carbon trading full of cap and tax scheme, like that which the Democrats in America want.
[03:12:11.540 --> 03:12:18.540]  And Turnbull was defeated by his own party, and Tony Abbott, who is skeptical about climate change,
[03:12:18.540 --> 03:12:23.540]  has taken over the first politician to win office because he doesn't believe this, not.
[03:12:23.540 --> 03:12:30.540]  So it was a very good time we had in Australia. Very, very receptive audiences.
[03:12:30.540 --> 03:12:35.540]  500 mentions of the tour in the media, both print and electronic.
[03:12:35.540 --> 03:12:42.540]  And according to the people who invited me there, two retired engineers from Newso who organized the whole thing
[03:12:42.540 --> 03:12:45.540]  and paid for it out of their own pockets, fortunately.
[03:12:45.540 --> 03:12:50.540]  We made the money back by the huge crowds that turned up all paying their $20 to hear me talk.
[03:12:50.540 --> 03:12:57.540]  But it was an astonishing event. They said that this has actually changed the opinion in Australia.
[03:12:57.540 --> 03:13:05.540]  Now, why has it done that? Not because I'm a brilliant speaker, but because people were absolutely desperate
[03:13:05.540 --> 03:13:10.540]  to hear the other side of the story which they couldn't get in the mainstream news media,
[03:13:10.540 --> 03:13:13.540]  because the mainstream news media won't even give you the fact.
[03:13:13.540 --> 03:13:23.540]  They won't even tell you that global warming over the last 15 years hasn't been happening in any statistically significant sense.
[03:13:23.540 --> 03:13:31.540]  That has now at last been publicly admitted by Phil Jones, who's the head of the now deposed and disgraced
[03:13:31.540 --> 03:13:35.540]  head of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.
[03:13:35.540 --> 03:13:40.540]  He's been chucked out because he was caught trying to suppress and tamper with and hide
[03:13:40.540 --> 03:13:47.540]  and even destroy scientific data. The climate data emails that got released by a whistleblower
[03:13:47.540 --> 03:13:53.540]  that had been all around the web did for him, but he was then interviewed by a sympathetic BBC interviewer
[03:13:53.540 --> 03:13:58.540]  who nevertheless got in touch with me first and said, what questions should I ask?
[03:13:58.540 --> 03:14:03.540]  I said, one thing you could ask is asking whether there has been any statistically significant global warming
[03:14:03.540 --> 03:14:10.540]  for the last 15 years and Phil Jones, albeit through pretty teeth, had to admit what he had never before,
[03:14:10.540 --> 03:14:17.540]  ever publicly said, that yes, I've been right all along, there hasn't been any significant global warming
[03:14:17.540 --> 03:14:24.540]  for 15 long years, a decade and a half. I mean, that is the most extraordinary admission
[03:14:24.540 --> 03:14:29.540]  by somebody who had been pushing out the official line at the rest of his recent decade,
[03:14:29.540 --> 03:14:36.540]  has been the warmest on the record, yes it has, but we still haven't had any significant warming for 15 years.
[03:14:36.540 --> 03:14:43.540]  Now they're beginning to have to tell us the truth and the media are beginning to have to print the truth,
[03:14:43.540 --> 03:14:50.540]  having concealed it from their own readers for a long time, and I think that's the value of the Australian tour,
[03:14:50.540 --> 03:14:57.540]  but it has made the Australian media and many others around the world realize that by deliberately suppressing
[03:14:57.540 --> 03:15:04.540]  the facts that don't happen to fit their chosen storyline about the alarming, dreadful, supposed global warming problem,
[03:15:04.540 --> 03:15:10.540]  they are not doing their readers any favor. They've now got to start at least giving the fact, whatever the opinions they may like to have,
[03:15:10.540 --> 03:15:17.540]  is another matter, but they must now do their job and give us the proper, unbiased, scientific fact.
[03:15:17.540 --> 03:15:22.540]  Because if they don't, then as I said many times, because everywhere I went I was asked this question,
[03:15:22.540 --> 03:15:28.540]  what about the mainstream media? I said it's quite simple. If they go on refusing to give you the fact,
[03:15:28.540 --> 03:15:36.540]  and you have to turn to Alex Jones and the electronic, you know, the radio shock jock and the internet
[03:15:36.540 --> 03:15:41.540]  to get your news, because the mainstream television and newspapers won't give you the fact,
[03:15:41.540 --> 03:15:48.540]  then the mainstream television and newspapers will lose audiences and they will go bust one by one and deserve it.
[03:15:48.540 --> 03:15:58.540]  And they are going bust. And they are going bust. I mean, the points you make raise so many other issues,
[03:15:58.540 --> 03:16:04.540]  but the bottom line is you are a brilliant speaker because you've done the research you've been right for 20 years.
[03:16:04.540 --> 03:16:12.540]  You recognize more than 20 years ago the danger of this criminal enterprise, this criminal cult.
[03:16:12.540 --> 03:16:18.540]  You know, we have the head climatologist for NASA saying destroy industrialized society. We have Maurice Strong saying
[03:16:18.540 --> 03:16:25.540]  destroy industrialized society. And just like in Russia or in Nazi Germany, when you suppress the truth,
[03:16:25.540 --> 03:16:36.540]  it explodes with even more force. But expanding on that, we see the global battle against this fraud.
[03:16:36.540 --> 03:16:43.540]  Every time we do stand up and take action, we have success and nothing succeeds like success.
[03:16:43.540 --> 03:16:52.540]  And so now that we have lost this feeling of helplessness and we now have the true spirit of empowerment,
[03:16:52.540 --> 03:17:00.540]  the route is intensifying and they've recognized that their bald face denying and stonewalling and ignoring
[03:17:00.540 --> 03:17:06.540]  Climategate for two weeks entirely and Newsweek saying it's a conspiracy theory, Climategate didn't even happen.
[03:17:06.540 --> 03:17:14.540]  This is only further destroying them, Lord Monkton, as you know. So how do you see this shaking out now?
[03:17:14.540 --> 03:17:20.540]  How do you see them counter-striking? They haven't spent, as you know, hundreds of billions of dollars
[03:17:20.540 --> 03:17:25.540]  financing this takeover to go quietly into the night.
[03:17:25.540 --> 03:17:31.540]  No, I think that's very well put. They're going to want to make sure that having invested all this time
[03:17:31.540 --> 03:17:35.540]  and effort, and of course it's not their money they've spent, it's your money they've spent.
[03:17:35.540 --> 03:17:39.540]  It's the taxpayer's money they've spent on furthering this scare.
[03:17:39.540 --> 03:17:45.540]  Of course they're going to want to get their dividend in the way of closing down the Western economies,
[03:17:45.540 --> 03:17:51.540]  but I don't think that's now going to happen. I think that financial recession hasn't helped them.
[03:17:51.540 --> 03:17:56.540]  It began, really, the rot when the financial recession set in and people began thinking,
[03:17:56.540 --> 03:18:01.540]  you know, do we really believe this climate stuff? But it's going to be very expensive if we do.
[03:18:01.540 --> 03:18:06.540]  And then came, Climategate then came the cold, northern hemisphere winter.
[03:18:06.540 --> 03:18:16.540]  In fact, interestingly, the January temperatures worldwide were the highest since satellite records began 32 years ago
[03:18:16.540 --> 03:18:21.540]  because there's an El Nino going on. So sea temperatures are very much higher than they would normally be.
[03:18:21.540 --> 03:18:27.540]  And interestingly, we think that that may be caused by undersea volcanic activity in the East Pacific,
[03:18:27.540 --> 03:18:31.540]  nothing whatever to do with global warming caused by us.
[03:18:31.540 --> 03:18:37.540]  So gradually all these facts about how the climate really works are beginning to come out
[03:18:37.540 --> 03:18:40.540]  and the media can no longer suppress them.
[03:18:40.540 --> 03:18:49.540]  And so what I think the usual suspects are going to do now is they're going to realize that trying to maintain
[03:18:49.540 --> 03:18:56.540]  these endless scare stories about the climate, when the climate simply isn't warming as they have predicted that it would,
[03:18:56.540 --> 03:19:04.540]  is not going to work. So what they're going to do instead, I think, is to go quiet for a bit
[03:19:04.540 --> 03:19:12.540]  and they'll be aware at local level rather than at national level because at national level we are watching
[03:19:12.540 --> 03:19:16.540]  and we will stop them. You've got wonderful organizations like Fox News.
[03:19:16.540 --> 03:19:22.540]  How has that done so well? It's done well because it does give you on this and on so many other subjects
[03:19:22.540 --> 03:19:28.540]  the fact that the mainstream news media otherwise wouldn't give because they've become so politicized.
[03:19:28.540 --> 03:19:33.540]  They're all effectively Marxist or totalitarian anyway in the way they look at things.
[03:19:33.540 --> 03:19:36.540]  And Fox News is simply saying, well, we will give the fact.
[03:19:36.540 --> 03:19:42.540]  And so half, or just about half now of the entire television news audience, what is Fox News?
[03:19:42.540 --> 03:19:45.540]  Because otherwise it won't get the fact.
[03:19:45.540 --> 03:19:46.540]  And so...
[03:19:46.540 --> 03:19:48.540]  And Lord Mongeon?
[03:19:48.540 --> 03:19:54.540]  They've just been reading, for instance, a remarkable, stupid piece in the Salt Lake tribute,
[03:19:54.540 --> 03:19:59.540]  which is an extreme left-wing paper, which absolutely hates...
[03:19:59.540 --> 03:20:05.540]  Administration there, which has, as you may know, passed a resolution saying global warming is nonsense.
[03:20:05.540 --> 03:20:07.540]  I'm not going to spend any more money on it.
[03:20:07.540 --> 03:20:14.540]  That's the Utah State Legislature has been the first to break ranks and say we're not having any more of it.
[03:20:14.540 --> 03:20:17.540]  And the local newspaper is absolutely furious.
[03:20:17.540 --> 03:20:24.540]  And so it rang up a scientist and got a quote, every single point of which was a lie.
[03:20:24.540 --> 03:20:28.540]  So I wrote to the reporter and said, what on earth do you think you're doing?
[03:20:28.540 --> 03:20:34.540]  Why don't you ask this so-called scientist whether he has qualifications in climatology,
[03:20:34.540 --> 03:20:41.540]  paleo-climatology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and various other subjects,
[03:20:41.540 --> 03:20:44.540]  on which he was claiming to be an authority because of the statement he made,
[03:20:44.540 --> 03:20:46.540]  every single one of which was wrong.
[03:20:46.540 --> 03:20:49.540]  It turned out he wasn't any kind of climate scientist at all.
[03:20:49.540 --> 03:20:51.540]  And this is the trouble.
[03:20:51.540 --> 03:20:55.540]  They just go to the people they know will sing the song they want to hear,
[03:20:55.540 --> 03:20:58.540]  rather than going to the people who actually know what the truth is.
[03:20:58.540 --> 03:21:04.540]  And these local news media and these local administrations are definitely a pain
[03:21:04.540 --> 03:21:07.540]  and they're going to have to be dealt with and dealt with very firmly.
[03:21:07.540 --> 03:21:10.540]  The way we've done this in the past in the United Kingdom,
[03:21:10.540 --> 03:21:14.540]  where you get a tough-minded, conservatively-minded government in office,
[03:21:14.540 --> 03:21:22.540]  is actually to circumscribe their powers so that they are forbidden to spend money on things like global warming.
[03:21:22.540 --> 03:21:25.540]  They just tell them that is out with their powers to do that.
[03:21:25.540 --> 03:21:30.540]  And if you do that, I know it's harder in the States to do that than it is in the UK,
[03:21:30.540 --> 03:21:34.540]  but you can nevertheless constrain quite a bit what they spend the money on.
[03:21:34.540 --> 03:21:41.540]  And the other thing is that now that the people are beginning to realize what rubbish this all is
[03:21:41.540 --> 03:21:46.540]  and how much it's going to cost them, and in particular that it's going to cost working people
[03:21:46.540 --> 03:21:51.540]  because they spend a bigger proportion on electricity and gasoline than everybody else,
[03:21:51.540 --> 03:21:54.540]  they are the ones that are going to get hurt by this.
[03:21:54.540 --> 03:21:59.540]  It doesn't matter what Henry Waxman or Ed Markey say about how they're going to compensate them.
[03:21:59.540 --> 03:22:04.540]  The fact is, if they compensate them, then their bill won't make any difference to carbon emissions.
[03:22:04.540 --> 03:22:08.540]  If they don't compensate them, then it's their own voters that are going to lose.
[03:22:08.540 --> 03:22:11.540]  Either way, an ETS is just madness.
[03:22:11.540 --> 03:22:15.540]  Any kind of emissions trading scheme, camp and trade, call it what you like, is now doomed.
[03:22:15.540 --> 03:22:18.540]  And I think there's no way they'll get that through the Senate.
[03:22:18.540 --> 03:22:22.540]  And I don't think the likes of Schwarzenegger and all those characters in California
[03:22:22.540 --> 03:22:25.540]  are going to get away with doing what they're doing.
[03:22:25.540 --> 03:22:31.540]  Say we're going to impose at state level taxes that are no longer going to be imposed at federal level.
[03:22:31.540 --> 03:22:34.540]  If they try that, then people will leave.
[03:22:34.540 --> 03:22:40.540]  And already there's a kind of wagon train no longer heading west, heading east, back out of California
[03:22:40.540 --> 03:22:46.540]  with businesses getting out of California because California hates business.
[03:22:46.540 --> 03:22:50.540]  And in the end, the governor is going to run out of money
[03:22:50.540 --> 03:22:52.540]  because he's driven all the businesses away.
[03:22:52.540 --> 03:22:55.540]  They used to pay the taxes that kept him in clover.
[03:22:55.540 --> 03:22:58.540]  They will learn in the end that they can't get away with this,
[03:22:58.540 --> 03:23:04.540]  that the people will vote with their feet and get out of local administration or state administration
[03:23:04.540 --> 03:23:07.540]  that try to impose extra global warming taxes.
[03:23:07.540 --> 03:23:12.540]  Now that we know that global warming, as Henry Ford might have put it, is bunk.
[03:23:12.540 --> 03:23:21.540]  Yes, and continuing along that line and understanding that they're going to come back at us,
[03:23:21.540 --> 03:23:26.540]  the state of Texas has announced they are moving to pass laws against cities
[03:23:26.540 --> 03:23:29.540]  because you can't have cities operating outside state laws.
[03:23:29.540 --> 03:23:36.540]  The cities and counties are chartered by the state and under its constitution.
[03:23:36.540 --> 03:23:42.540]  And we have everybody literally millions moving every few years out of California, mainly to Texas.
[03:23:42.540 --> 03:23:47.540]  That's why the UN lobbyists are here in Austin.
[03:23:47.540 --> 03:23:49.540]  This is the big battleground.
[03:23:49.540 --> 03:23:51.540]  They're trying to hurry and pass it this month or next month.
[03:23:51.540 --> 03:23:53.540]  They were going to pass it in about six months.
[03:23:53.540 --> 03:23:56.540]  They're in a hurry and I agree with you.
[03:23:56.540 --> 03:23:58.540]  They're now saying, okay, you win.
[03:23:58.540 --> 03:23:59.540]  It's not real.
[03:23:59.540 --> 03:24:00.540]  Go back to sleep.
[03:24:00.540 --> 03:24:06.540]  You won because they know now that when they give us a fight back that we know we're winning.
[03:24:06.540 --> 03:24:09.540]  So that only energizes the people to take action.
[03:24:09.540 --> 03:24:13.540]  So they're going to play possum and they're going to call it green jobs.
[03:24:13.540 --> 03:24:19.540]  Now they've always done that to a certain extent, but they now have almost 100% shifted out of saying global warming.
[03:24:19.540 --> 03:24:20.540]  We've got to save you.
[03:24:20.540 --> 03:24:21.540]  Sky is falling too.
[03:24:21.540 --> 03:24:24.540]  The economy is dead.
[03:24:24.540 --> 03:24:26.540]  Only a green job will save you.
[03:24:26.540 --> 03:24:34.540]  But in Australia, in Canada, in Spain, as you know, police are, I'd like you to break it down and give people the actual numbers.
[03:24:34.540 --> 03:24:38.540]  Green jobs cost on average two jobs for every job you create.
[03:24:38.540 --> 03:24:42.540]  It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund each low paying green job.
[03:24:42.540 --> 03:24:43.540]  And it doesn't work.
[03:24:43.540 --> 03:24:55.540]  It's a boondoggle to their friends and Al Gore and others that own large stakes in the select green companies that the county cities and states are forced
[03:24:55.540 --> 03:24:58.540]  with the federal money to purchase these systems from.
[03:24:58.540 --> 03:24:59.540]  That's exactly right.
[03:24:59.540 --> 03:25:04.540]  And of course, what you're talking about there, that two jobs destroyed for everyone created.
[03:25:04.540 --> 03:25:06.540]  That's what's known as the Friedman factor.
[03:25:06.540 --> 03:25:15.540]  He won the Nobel Prize for economics for pointing out that if the state, the taxpayer is made to pay to create a job,
[03:25:15.540 --> 03:25:19.540]  every job that's created will destroy two jobs in the private sector.
[03:25:19.540 --> 03:25:22.540]  And that's why you have to keep the public sector small.
[03:25:22.540 --> 03:25:33.540]  And of course, the green jobs argument is just another socialistic or communist or totalitarian way of expanding the state funded,
[03:25:33.540 --> 03:25:39.540]  publicly funded job and destroying the private sector as they go.
[03:25:39.540 --> 03:25:47.540]  And of course, Democrats are always willing to do that because they know that most corporations don't vote Democrat.
[03:25:47.540 --> 03:25:49.540]  They don't like to contribute to the Democrat.
[03:25:49.540 --> 03:25:57.540]  And therefore, they would rather shut down corporate America because they think they will gain political advantage by doing it.
[03:25:57.540 --> 03:26:00.540]  They don't care if they drive your nation's background.
[03:26:00.540 --> 03:26:06.540]  And of course, green jobs, as I said in front of the Energy and Commerce Committee of Congress and the Ways and Means Committee,
[03:26:06.540 --> 03:26:07.540]  I said the same to both of us.
[03:26:07.540 --> 03:26:10.540]  Green jobs are the new unemployment.
[03:26:10.540 --> 03:26:17.540]  If you want to create unemployment, the fastest way to do it is the taxpayers will be made to subsidize the boondoggles
[03:26:17.540 --> 03:26:19.540]  as you have so rightly called them.
[03:26:19.540 --> 03:26:24.540]  There is no economic basis for wind farm.
[03:26:24.540 --> 03:26:25.540]  Nor is there an environment.
[03:26:25.540 --> 03:26:31.540]  But it gives incredible power to the government to give their friends and families and others the money.
[03:26:31.540 --> 03:26:32.540]  And we have Obama.
[03:26:32.540 --> 03:26:42.540]  We have Pichari for those that don't know that former or current head of the IPCC and others all openly making Al Gore masses of money off of this.
[03:26:42.540 --> 03:26:50.540]  And specifically, not only that Nobel Prize winning paper on the fact that government destroys jobs for every job it creates,
[03:26:50.540 --> 03:26:52.540]  it kills at least two.
[03:26:52.540 --> 03:27:03.540]  We know in Spain, this is in Bloomberg, their own government admits every green job destroyed two jobs and cost additional money on top of that.
[03:27:03.540 --> 03:27:11.540]  And we have England shutting down its steelworks, paying to move it to Pichari's own steelworks that he owns.
[03:27:11.540 --> 03:27:14.540]  I mean, this is criminal on its face.
[03:27:14.540 --> 03:27:21.540]  This is as criminal as a mugger bashing an old woman's head in with a hammer and robbing her.
[03:27:21.540 --> 03:27:25.540]  This is as illegal as a serial killer kidnapping children.
[03:27:25.540 --> 03:27:42.540]  If you take that red car steelworks that thing, there was a report about that at last on BBC television today. They've been almost violently silent about it.
[03:27:42.540 --> 03:27:55.540]  And India doesn't. And that's why the Indian steelworks that owns the red car steelworks is moving it to India and that Indian steelworks is the one that employs Pichari.
[03:27:55.540 --> 03:27:57.540]  None of that was made plain.
[03:27:57.540 --> 03:28:03.540]  They just said it was world economic factor that were causing, you know, world economic loadup was causing that steelworks to shut.
[03:28:03.540 --> 03:28:16.540]  It wasn't. It was that we've got cap and trade and India hasn't. And our jobs are being exported to India where precisely the same steelworks is going to be built, employing precisely the same number of people.
[03:28:16.540 --> 03:28:26.540]  So there will be absolutely no benefit to the planet whatsoever, but quite unnecessarily we will have destroyed 1,700 British jobs.
[03:28:26.540 --> 03:28:37.540]  And none of the major political parties has said sorry to these hardworking steelworkers in red car who have lost their job, not one.
[03:28:37.540 --> 03:28:47.540]  They have spat on their hands and said nothing as these people have thrown out of work.
[03:28:47.540 --> 03:28:56.540]  But the good news is all over the country, people are recognizing what this is. Of course, the provision they've now passed in Utah.
[03:28:56.540 --> 03:29:04.540]  We have him coming up in the next hour, the state rep that actually introduced the bill. And he has rightfully said this is a eugenics operation.
[03:29:04.540 --> 03:29:12.540]  This is a population reduction move. This is a plan to deindustrialize the West.
[03:29:12.540 --> 03:29:18.540]  All he's doing is quoting from the UN, quoting from the very people that set this up.
[03:29:18.540 --> 03:29:29.540]  Quoting from Maurice Strong, who said 25 years ago that he was setting up the intergovernmental panel on climate change as an intergovernmental rather than a scientific panel,
[03:29:29.540 --> 03:29:44.540]  precisely so that it could be transmogrified into a world government one day. That's what he said. Jack Shearac said some years ago that he wanted the world government to come out of the U.S.
[03:29:44.540 --> 03:30:00.540]  Lord Monkton, stay there. We got a break. Let's come back and cover world government and all the other scandals with climate change.
[03:30:00.540 --> 03:30:06.540]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[03:30:06.540 --> 03:30:14.540]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world. The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[03:30:14.540 --> 03:30:21.540]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com. We also have some specials when you get some of our other films.
[03:30:21.540 --> 03:30:35.540]  Half price when you order Shadow Government. A new level in production quality and information. It exposes how a casual society surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[03:30:35.540 --> 03:30:44.540]  This film needs to be seen. Everybody needs to get it. So order yours today. Show it to your friends, your family, your church, your neighbors, your boss, your employees.
[03:30:44.540 --> 03:30:52.540]  Shadow Government, ladies and gentlemen, get your copy at infowars.com today. Shadow Government. It gives big brother a black eye.

[03:31:02.540 --> 03:31:10.540]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.540 --> 03:31:15.540]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:15.540 --> 03:31:21.540]  I've turned the members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.540 --> 03:31:26.540]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.540 --> 03:31:36.540]  The fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.540 --> 03:31:42.540]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[03:31:42.540 --> 03:31:49.540]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:49.540 --> 03:32:00.540]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[03:32:19.540 --> 03:32:27.540]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free. That's buy three, get one free.
[03:32:27.540 --> 03:32:38.540]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd. The following week they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[03:32:38.540 --> 03:32:41.540]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[03:32:41.540 --> 03:32:46.540]  Another example, buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[03:32:46.540 --> 03:32:54.540]  You've got to go to infuzedirect.com slash alex for the food buy of a lifetime or call 800-409-5633.
[03:32:54.540 --> 03:33:18.540]  Go to infuzedirect.com slash alex or 800-409-5633.
[03:33:24.540 --> 03:33:31.540]  White House officials how they want to destroy our industrial base. I think we eat too much. We have swimming pools, too many cars, too many children.
[03:33:31.540 --> 03:33:45.540]  These are control freaks. Lord Moncton is a champion of freedom who's been fighting these people for more than two decades and now it is paying off big time because of his steadfastness, his dogged determination and many others.
[03:33:45.540 --> 03:34:00.540]  Now, sir, you got cut off by the break. You were getting into all these world leaders calling for global governance and saying the keystone, the cornerstone of this is the phony environmental movement.
[03:34:00.540 --> 03:34:15.540]  Yes, that's right. These people have been using the environmental movement as a way of advancing political objectives that have nothing whatsoever to do with the environment.
[03:34:15.540 --> 03:34:30.540]  We're dealing with a Marxist who piled out of the Berlin Wall and into the environmental movement and a very great friend of ours, Eric Ellington, who was one of the founders of Greenpeace who sadly died just two days ago.
[03:34:30.540 --> 03:34:43.540]  He left Greenpeace shortly after he founded it because so many of these people had come in and taken the organization over for purposes that had nothing whatever to do with protecting the environment.
[03:34:43.540 --> 03:34:53.540]  And were all about achieving political objectives that were bitterly and wickedly hostile to the interests of the West.
[03:34:53.540 --> 03:35:09.540]  So this has really been a very, very sad business that the genuine environmental movement has been almost entirely captured now by people who hate the West and who hate success, who hate industry,
[03:35:09.540 --> 03:35:19.540]  who hate humanity, who rightly said before the break, they are there to try to get humanity to be killed in its millions.
[03:35:19.540 --> 03:35:25.540]  They would like to reduce the population, some of them have said, to just one billion until the seven billion is coming up at the moment.
[03:35:25.540 --> 03:35:29.540]  They say there are only more than that and we're encroaching too much on the planet.
[03:35:29.540 --> 03:35:41.540]  And they're prepared to use the most draconian methods, including starvation, to achieve their end and that, of course, is what has happened as a direct result of the global warming scare
[03:35:41.540 --> 03:35:55.540]  because there are millions starving in the third world now. Millions more than would otherwise have been starving because the biofuel scan into which all the foolish governments of the world galloped to the name of saving the planet
[03:35:55.540 --> 03:36:09.540]  has taken millions of acres of agricultural land out of growing food for people who needed it and now it's growing biofuels for clunkers that dent, making Al Gore and various absolute bankers very, very rich
[03:36:09.540 --> 03:36:17.540]  and making the rest of us very poor and, more importantly, putting food prices up by double in the last couple years.
[03:36:17.540 --> 03:36:27.540]  This is not rhetoric. I mean, these are admitted facts. They want to starve people. They want to control the wealth. They want to set up a planetary tyranny.
[03:36:27.540 --> 03:36:37.540]  Expanding on that, you, of course, have called out Al Gore many times. I would like to do that again today. You've called for criminal investigations.
[03:36:37.540 --> 03:36:48.540]  These guys years ago in major papers called for your arrest, called for the death penalty for people that are climate deniers, cast Sunstein at the White House, says he wants to make it illegal.
[03:36:48.540 --> 03:36:57.540]  I don't know if you've seen that paper. It only came out in the last month that he wrote a year and a half ago for the Chicago Law School.
[03:36:57.540 --> 03:37:17.540]  I mean, they have truly committed the crimes to carry out this fraud, so can you speak to that area and then, secondarily, giant events have taken place each one bearer than the last of new frauds, new cooking the books and the thermostat records.
[03:37:17.540 --> 03:37:28.540]  I know you know about that, but can you chronicle some of the glacier gates and other things that are coming out now on a daily basis? The Met Office?
[03:37:28.540 --> 03:37:48.540]  That's a very, very story what we're getting. And let's just look at the latest of them, which you probably haven't even heard of yourself because it's so new. The UN's climate panel has underestimated the growth in Antarctic sea ice over the last 30 years by 50%.
[03:37:48.540 --> 03:38:00.540]  I've been concentrating on saying, oh, but look how the Arctic sea ice has been diminishing. Well, it has, but the Antarctic sea ice has been increasing almost as much, and yet you'd never know it.
[03:38:00.540 --> 03:38:09.540]  Hold on, hold on, hold your horses. I don't mean to interrupt. This is new. The police are telling us where we find this, the admission. This is huge.
[03:38:09.540 --> 03:38:21.540]  Yes, I mean, this is yet another error that's been found, and you'll find a very good detailed explanation of this at whatsupwiththat.com, which I expect you to know quite well.
[03:38:21.540 --> 03:38:36.540]  It's a very good website by Anthony Watt. W-A-T-T-S, up with that, or one word, dot com. And his lead story at the moment is on what he calls IPCC gate du jour Antarctic sea ice increase underestimated by 50%.
[03:38:36.540 --> 03:38:50.540]  He's got the graph. He's shown you how they've bent it. He's got a detailed description of what they did and how they went about it and how dishonest it is, because, of course, as Arctic sea ice extent has declined, Antarctic sea ice has increased to match it.
[03:38:50.540 --> 03:39:00.540]  And so global sea ice extent hasn't changed at all. You'd not know that if you read the media, but let's just go through some of the other errors that have come to light.
[03:39:00.540 --> 03:39:12.540]  We'll start with the one that I spotted when the 2007 fourth assessment report of the UN climate panel, the IPCC, came out. Now, they've done four of these big assessment reports. That's the most recent one.
[03:39:12.540 --> 03:39:23.540]  On the day it came out, I saw that the bureaucrats had put in a graph, a table of figures, rather, that hadn't been in the original document.
[03:39:23.540 --> 03:39:32.540]  And so I protested and said, by the way, it doesn't need an adapter within a factor of two of the total you've put at the bottom of this new table.
[03:39:32.540 --> 03:39:43.540]  And also, you've multiplied by 10 the observed contributions to sea level rise of not only the Greenland, but also the Antarctic land-based ice sheet.
[03:39:43.540 --> 03:39:52.540]  And I said that outrageous. You have no basis putting in as bureaucrats tables of figures like this, which the scientists haven't signed off on.
[03:39:52.540 --> 03:39:55.540]  And on the piece of paper, it's all wrong.
[03:39:55.540 --> 03:40:01.540]  And on the piece of paper, it's all wrong. A 10-year-old in math class could tell it was a fraud.
[03:40:01.540 --> 03:40:16.540]  I mean, they're so shoddy. I mean, take Glacier Gate from the Himalayas, where they used a mountaineering student's photos and a cell phone call saying, looks like the ice is disappearing as their scientific proof.
[03:40:16.540 --> 03:40:24.540]  That's right. And they didn't bother to talk to Professor Pat of the Indian Geological Survey, who's kept me briefed on the Himalayan glaciers for years.
[03:40:24.540 --> 03:40:31.540]  And he has said all along, and he's now been proven right, that there's absolutely no basis for the idea that all that ice would be gone in 25 years.
[03:40:31.540 --> 03:40:43.540]  He says there's no danger of it going anywhere. And we also know that the lead author of the chapter of the IPCC's report that said this was going to disappear in 25 years, is the Himalayan ice.
[03:40:43.540 --> 03:40:50.540]  He said that he knew that figure was wrong, but he left it in there because he wanted to influence government.
[03:40:50.540 --> 03:40:58.540]  In other words, it's yet another deliberate lie. It's like Al Gore saying sea level is going to rise imminently by 20 feet.
[03:40:58.540 --> 03:41:08.540]  And we know he knows that's a lie because he buys himself a condo, feet from the ocean at Fisherman's Wharf, the same year he's making the film in which he tells the lie.
[03:41:08.540 --> 03:41:23.540]  And that kind of thing, where we're now catching them out, not only telling the lies, but pretty much admitting that they're lying deliberately for the sake of exerting a political influence on government, rather than just reporting the science correctly.
[03:41:23.540 --> 03:41:24.540]  And that's key.
[03:41:24.540 --> 03:41:38.540]  And that's not all. I mean, if you look at the other ones, we've had African agriculture was going to be destroyed by climate change. They've now had to admit that, in fact, even two or three Celsius of warming, which we aren't going to see.
[03:41:38.540 --> 03:41:43.540]  But even if we did, it would be highly beneficial to African agriculture. It would lead to a further increase.
[03:41:43.540 --> 03:41:52.540]  Schwarzenegger says they're going to lose all the grapes for wine in California, just asinine lies.
[03:41:52.540 --> 03:41:58.540]  Well, actually, they are because they've lost them to frost a couple of years running. They've had exceptional frost in California.
[03:41:58.540 --> 03:42:04.540]  It's been very bad for all the grapes and the fruit crops generally down there. The orange crops have been damaged as well.
[03:42:04.540 --> 03:42:10.540]  The citrus crops had a hard time there. But that's because of global cooling, not because of global warming.
[03:42:10.540 --> 03:42:28.540]  Then we had the story about the Amazon rainforest. Forty percent, they said, were going to disappear because of global warming. That turned out to be made up by a campaigner for the Worldwide Fund for Nature, another of the retid environmental groups run by communists, funded by communist governments over the seas.
[03:42:28.540 --> 03:42:42.540]  They have sovereign wealth, the like of which you and I will never see. Then we had them saying that 66% of Holland would be under water, when in fact only 26% of it is below sea level.
[03:42:42.540 --> 03:42:49.540]  Then they said that there was going to be damage from extreme weather events. Now they've had to admit that there's no basis for that whatsoever.
[03:42:49.540 --> 03:42:59.540]  Then they said that there were going to be more hurricanes because of global warming, and they were warned by the resignation of one of the lead authors of that chapter that they mustn't go on saying that.
[03:42:59.540 --> 03:43:08.540]  They went on saying it anyway. Now that's been turned out to have been written by a journalist who remarks his newspaper in Britain, not by a scientist.
[03:43:08.540 --> 03:43:21.540]  And day after day, new revelations come out. I confronted Pecari with another one of these in Copenhagen because the headline graph in the entire 2007 assessment report of the U.S.
[03:43:21.540 --> 03:43:36.540]  was a graph showing that the rate of increase in temperatures has itself been accelerating over the last 150 years, with the implication stated in the report in three different places that it was we who had caused this acceleration in warming.
[03:43:36.540 --> 03:43:48.540]  In fact, there hasn't been an acceleration at the warming rate. That whole thing is entirely bogus. They used a statistical technique that I was taught not to use in Statistics 101.
[03:43:48.540 --> 03:43:57.540]  They had no basis for using this cheap trick, which conceals the fact that there's been no significant increase in temperature whatsoever,
[03:43:57.540 --> 03:44:06.540]  but the rate of warming that we saw over the last 30 years is exactly consistent with rates of warming we've seen between 1860 and 1880 and again between 1910.
[03:44:06.540 --> 03:44:08.540]  So we know it's a natural cycle.
[03:44:08.540 --> 03:44:21.540]  We couldn't have had any effect on temperature. I confronted Pecari with this, and I gave him today to withdraw that graph, apologize, use it in his own lectures, get it taken out of the IPCC's document.
[03:44:21.540 --> 03:44:28.540]  Otherwise, I said I would report it for fraud. He didn't get in touch. I reported him for fraud. He is now being investigated.
[03:44:28.540 --> 03:44:40.540]  All right, now that brings me to my next question. The fraud goes on forever, and the U.N., the media, the spammers that come on our websites, they repeat the same thing.
[03:44:40.540 --> 03:44:57.540]  You are liars. We have thousands of peer-reviewed studies, but then all those studies are based on U.N. collected and private environmental group collected data that every time you spot check it is a premeditated fraud, not an error.
[03:44:57.540 --> 03:45:13.540]  And they've spent hundreds of billions globally, as you know, pushing this Lord Mockden. And so my question to you is, doesn't there need to be criminal charges on thousands of people and hundreds of organizations if we're truly going to route these people?
[03:45:13.540 --> 03:45:28.540]  Justice be done. May the heavens fall.
[03:45:28.540 --> 03:45:45.540]  Quite rightly, a very high standard of proof. You have to be able to prove that a person committing the fraud was either grossly negligent and therefore looked the other way when he was cheating people, or was deliberately cheating them.
[03:45:45.540 --> 03:45:58.540]  Unless you can prove one of those two things, and prove that what he did involves other people in losses, and prove that what he did involves him in gaining at their expense. If you can't prove all that, you can't prove a fraud.
[03:45:58.540 --> 03:46:14.540]  What I would do is, I would pick out, for instance, Pateri. Let's take him as an example. Now, he is a trustee of a charity in the United Kingdom called TERI, I foot Europe. That's the TATAR Industries Energy Research Institute for Europe.
[03:46:14.540 --> 03:46:29.540]  TATAR Industries, just to get this clear, they are the people who closed down the steelworks at Red Car, costing 1,700 of our workers their jobs over the next three months. That's who TATAR Industries are.
[03:46:29.540 --> 03:46:40.540]  They have a charity in the United Kingdom called TERI, I foot Europe. It is registered with our charity commission, which requires it to file accurate accounts every year.
[03:46:40.540 --> 03:46:52.540]  Now, for the last three years, it hasn't filed any accounts, because it has made declarations to the charity commission that it received in each of those years less than 10,000 sterling in income.
[03:46:52.540 --> 03:47:10.540]  However, I found on a government website a statement saying that that particular charity had been paid 30,000 pounds in just one of those three years in income to do a particular job for the government, and that income was not declared to the charity commission.
[03:47:10.540 --> 03:47:23.540]  And on further investigation, it turns out that several hundred thousand pounds of income each year has not been declared, and they've therefore got away with hiding from the charity commission where it is that they're getting their money from.
[03:47:23.540 --> 03:47:27.540]  They're getting it in fact largely from British government taxpayer sources.
[03:47:27.540 --> 03:47:35.540]  So, sir, you're saying then it's like getting Al Capone on tax evasion. Let me throw out a few other names then.
[03:47:35.540 --> 03:47:51.540]  First of all, that means Pechari, whose job as a trustee is to file accurate account, is now going to face criminal prosecution in the United Kingdom for false accounting, which is a serious, imprisonable criminal offense.
[03:47:51.540 --> 03:48:09.540]  He has been dodging his obligation as a trustee, and two English trustees have now got themselves reclassified as not being trustees, so as to leave him alone in the fray. And the police are now going to go after them, too, for trying to get themselves reclassified as not being trustees.
[03:48:09.540 --> 03:48:24.540]  It's a very, very murky business. And what we're now doing is we're looking at the financial vested interest of several of the scientists and Al Gore types and businessmen and politicians who are advocating this stuff.
[03:48:24.540 --> 03:48:40.540]  They're finding wherever we look that they have financial links with organized crime, financial links with huge corporations that are making money out of carbon trading and banks and so forth. Al Gore was on the board of Lehman Brothers.
[03:48:40.540 --> 03:48:48.540]  They were trying to corner the market in carbon trading. They were so busy doing that they didn't look to their main business and they deservedly went bust.
[03:48:48.540 --> 03:48:57.540]  But these people, there are links everywhere to huge financial vested interests and a great deal of criminal activity.
[03:48:57.540 --> 03:49:13.540]  If you look, for instance, at the European carbon trading deal that's been running for several years, a recent report by the European Court of Auditors shows that 90% of all transactions on the European carbon market are fraudulent transactions.
[03:49:13.540 --> 03:49:31.540]  Now, I knew this would happen because it's blindingly obvious if you set up a carbon trading scheme, then not only both parties do any carbon trading transaction, but also the regulators have a joint vested interest in exaggerating the scale and quantity of the transaction.
[03:49:31.540 --> 03:49:33.540]  Incredible. So you have the people...
[03:49:33.540 --> 03:49:38.540]  The whole thing from top to bottom is a serious financial fraud.
[03:49:38.540 --> 03:49:51.540]  Okay, so we go after Bachari, we go after Gore. What about somebody like Phil Jones, who gets all these millions of dollars or pounds in research funding, the head facility, and we have the emails where he's hiding the decline?
[03:49:51.540 --> 03:49:52.540]  I mean, that's...
[03:49:52.540 --> 03:49:59.540]  The first thing that happened there is that the Information Commissioner's office, which I asked to look into, gained in activity.
[03:49:59.540 --> 03:50:05.540]  First of all, failed to reply to my letter at all. I'm going to have to sue them to make them do their job and answer my letter.
[03:50:05.540 --> 03:50:17.540]  But they then issued a public statement saying that the law prevented them from prosecuting Jones because he would have had to have been done within six months of the offense first being drawn to their attention.
[03:50:17.540 --> 03:50:22.540]  Well, in fact, they got the law wrong, but they still decided they're not going to do anything about it.
[03:50:22.540 --> 03:50:36.540]  And I think what we're going to find is that the prosecuting authorities, which are, of course, directed by exactly the same government that are themselves profiting by this fraud, are going to be towed by those governments to look the other way.
[03:50:36.540 --> 03:50:46.540]  However, in England and Wales, and I think in some states of the U.S. too, the individual citizen has the right to prosecute if the state fails to do so.
[03:50:46.540 --> 03:50:47.540]  Incredible.
[03:50:47.540 --> 03:50:54.540]  I think that what's now going to happen is that some of these crooks are going to be prosecuted by individuals where the state won't do its job.
[03:50:54.540 --> 03:51:01.540]  Okay, Lord Moncton, we've got one more quick segment. An hour goes by so fast with you, I've got a bunch of other key questions.
[03:51:01.540 --> 03:51:17.540]  Afraid to answer it? Afraid to answer your door? Did you know that debt settlement bankruptcy and attorneys will cost you about 10 times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[03:51:17.540 --> 03:51:21.540]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt. They are expensive payment plans.
[03:51:21.540 --> 03:51:31.540]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment plan? Zero debt in 90 days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed.

[03:52:02.540 --> 03:52:09.540]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:09.540 --> 03:52:15.540]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.540 --> 03:52:21.540]  I've turned the members' influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.540 --> 03:52:26.540]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.540 --> 03:52:36.540]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.540 --> 03:52:42.540]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists are asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:42.540 --> 03:52:49.540]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:54:01.540 --> 03:54:14.540]  Well, it's our final segment with Lord Christopher Monkton. We have a state representative who just got a law rammed through saying no to the global warming takeover.
[03:54:14.540 --> 03:54:17.540]  Texas is doing the same thing. That's all coming up.
[03:54:17.540 --> 03:54:22.540]  Lord Monkton, let's talk about how this is going to end, how this plays out.
[03:54:22.540 --> 03:54:29.540]  But first, I want to throw the caveat out. I know a lot of your Tories in England are still going along with the environmental fraud.
[03:54:29.540 --> 03:54:33.540]  The NFL is pushing in here in the U.S. We see Newt Gennrich doing it.
[03:54:33.540 --> 03:54:42.540]  Rupert Murdoch, other than Fox, on his entertainment shows, brags that they implant messages about the green economy and global warming being real.
[03:54:42.540 --> 03:54:46.540]  So you say that we're winning this and I agree with you.
[03:54:46.540 --> 03:54:55.540]  My problem is if we don't keep the battle hot and real and focused, it'll just kind of fade away and they'll just regroup and come back.
[03:54:55.540 --> 03:54:58.540]  But how do you see this successfully ending?
[03:54:58.540 --> 03:55:09.540]  There's always a danger of that, but I think we can now hope that because their activities have actually been criminal, we can just land one or two prosecutions.
[03:55:09.540 --> 03:55:16.540]  Pachelre, for instance, is going to be prosecuted because the accounts were plainly not correctly filed.
[03:55:16.540 --> 03:55:22.540]  He plainly knew as a trustee that he had a job to make sure the accounts were right. He didn't do that job.
[03:55:22.540 --> 03:55:33.540]  He was at best negligent at worst, deliberately fraudulent. Either way, it's a serious imprisonment for criminal offense and he is going to be prosecuted even if I have to prosecute him myself.
[03:55:33.540 --> 03:55:43.540]  And I know the public authorities here, because there's so much in the pockets of the governing class, won't lift a finger against any of these people, however much they commit fraud.
[03:55:43.540 --> 03:55:45.540]  But I am not going to tolerate it.
[03:55:45.540 --> 03:56:02.540]  There are many others here who are not going to tolerate it, so whether they like it or not, these people who have lauded it over and have corruptly taken money from the pockets of the poor to pay for their own $1,000 suits, which is what Pachelre usually wears,
[03:56:02.540 --> 03:56:21.540]  and their lavish lifestyles in the smartest suburb of Delhi, that is now going to come to an end and the lifestyle of Pachelre is going to be for a very long time behind bars in a smelly Indian jail for the fraud in three successive years
[03:56:21.540 --> 03:56:35.540]  or deliberately filing false accounts in his charity in the U.K. so that we couldn't tell just how much money the British taxpayer was paying to keep him and his cronies in clothing.
[03:56:35.540 --> 03:56:42.540]  And to interrupt everything you predicted has come true so far. I mean, I really hope this is going to happen. How do we make sure this happens?
[03:56:42.540 --> 03:56:53.540]  We make sure it happens by looking out for any other activities that are fraudulent by environmental groups telling lies about the climate and profiting by doing so.
[03:56:53.540 --> 03:57:05.540]  All of that is fraudulent. All of that is prosecutable. Indeed, under the Rico Statute of the United States, some of these environmental groups could be shut down because they've been lying systematically for years and years and years.
[03:57:05.540 --> 03:57:07.540]  And destroying people's businesses.
[03:57:07.540 --> 03:57:11.540]  They've been hurting people too.
[03:57:11.540 --> 03:57:25.540]  They have indeed, and they've been endangering people by stopping new co-fired power stations from being built, by stopping new nuclear power stations from being built, by protesting every time people wanted a new power station, jobs already being lost.
[03:57:25.540 --> 03:57:31.540]  They're a mafia you've got to buy protection from. They also get to choose who they're going to mess with, who they're not.
[03:57:31.540 --> 03:57:46.540]  Exactly. And I think just one or two of those people taken to court and prosecuted for criminal fraud by workers who've lost their jobs in that aluminum smelter that closed down recently in the States because it could no longer buy electricity because the grid is running out.
[03:57:46.540 --> 03:58:04.540]  Those people have a good case to take these greenies to court, and all you've got to do is land a couple of them in prison, and the rest will run for cover. And more importantly, the people who are now credulously paying the money will stop paying the money because they are just fraudulent.
[03:58:04.540 --> 03:58:18.540]  So you're saying Lord Monkton, we haven't even begun to see the routing of these people because they were so bold, they've committed so many crimes that this could discredit collectivism even worse than it did in the Soviet Union.
[03:58:18.540 --> 03:58:34.540]  I think that's exactly what's going to happen. I think the left, by nailing their colors to the master of this particular rapidly thinking ship, are going to find themselves very, they're not going to find it easy to free themselves from their entanglement with the top hamper of this thinking ship.
[03:58:34.540 --> 03:58:37.540]  Lord Monkton, we're out of time. We're out of time.
[03:58:37.540 --> 03:58:50.540]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCN Live.com today.
[03:59:08.540 --> 03:59:19.540]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:19.540 --> 03:59:26.540]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[03:59:26.540 --> 03:59:36.540]  Number five, a solar-powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
