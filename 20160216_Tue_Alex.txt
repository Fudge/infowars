[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:39.760]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:39.760 --> 00:46.920]  well it is another information overload transmission for you today thank you so
[00:46.920 --> 00:50.240]  much for joining us I am your host Alex Jones we're going to be here for the
[00:50.240 --> 00:55.800]  next four hours and we've got our reporters David Knight Joe Biggs and a
[00:55.800 --> 01:02.080]  camera crew as well now down at the scene of where Scalia reportedly died of
[01:02.080 --> 01:07.480]  natural causes an anonymous phone call said and there'll be no investigation by
[01:07.480 --> 01:10.760]  any of the media or the government and there'll be no autopsy they made sure to
[01:10.760 --> 01:14.800]  announce the next day because there's a nothing to see here just go to sleep go
[01:14.800 --> 01:22.000]  away but since then we have leftist journalists and social media users
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.400]  spewing a torrent of hate and and and after the death of Scalia and calling
[01:28.400 --> 01:34.240]  and praying for and hoping for the death of of course Clarence Thomas and Paul
[01:34.240 --> 01:37.840]  Watson and Steve Watson have both written articles on this chronicling and
[01:37.840 --> 01:43.040]  just linking through all these different examples of the vitriol so they
[01:43.040 --> 01:48.400]  they hope everyone dies but if you go to WorldNet daily they have a really
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.560]  really important story that photos of poindexter that own the ranch and ate
[01:53.560 --> 01:57.920]  dinner right next to Scalia that night and saw him go to bed and then came and
[01:57.920 --> 02:01.880]  found his body with the pillow over the face this black ops commander from
[02:01.880 --> 02:09.640]  Vietnam buddies with with Obama and giving him so many contributions that
[02:09.640 --> 02:15.560]  Obama made up an award just basically for him and then presented it to him so
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.040]  those articles are up on info wars.com and WorldNet daily will Texas
[02:20.040 --> 02:29.200]  governor call for investigation into Scalia's death and that's another
[02:29.200 --> 02:35.640]  report from info wars.com and on Salazar it's up on drudgereport.com
[02:37.640 --> 02:42.000]  now continuing we're gonna be going over all of this today here's the
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.400]  particular article so I can show it to viewers and mention it to radio listeners
[02:45.400 --> 02:50.920]  you can find it for yourself Obama poindexter picks fuel Scalia suspicions
[02:50.920 --> 02:57.360]  and then you can go through and see the two embracing and poindexter getting his
[02:57.360 --> 03:00.840]  loving award with his good little buddy that he's given so much money to Obama
[03:00.840 --> 03:05.600]  and then Scalia doesn't bring a security detail and goes to the ranch and well
[03:05.600 --> 03:13.400]  now sleeps with the fishes or sleeps with a pillow over over his face now
[03:13.400 --> 03:19.600]  continuing here we're also going to be getting into the situation with first
[03:19.600 --> 03:23.560]  amendment critic the attorney general that says you can ban free speech we've
[03:23.560 --> 03:27.520]  played that clip and that there's no protection on offensive speech that
[03:27.520 --> 03:32.520]  hurts people's feelings they're talking about removing her impeaching her a few
[03:32.520 --> 03:36.920]  months ago in Congress when she said that and then she reversed herself first
[03:36.920 --> 03:42.640]  amendment critic may get the nomination for the Supreme Court justice that's a
[03:42.640 --> 03:47.240]  curtain in the article attorney general Loretta Lynch of course they're banning
[03:47.240 --> 03:50.320]  buildings named Lynch because it hurts people's feelings will she change her
[03:50.320 --> 03:54.360]  name because it was associated with lynching of course it's not associated
[03:54.360 --> 03:58.560]  with lynching it's an Irish name but who cares attorney general Loretta Lynch
[03:58.560 --> 04:04.480]  or attorney general Loretta racist name hang black people hurt my feelings
[04:04.480 --> 04:09.960]  Lynch that's what they say the this name means attorney general Loretta Lynch has
[04:09.960 --> 04:15.360]  publicly expressed enmity towards first amendment so another very important
[04:15.360 --> 04:18.560]  story that we're going to be going over today and then another flashback of
[04:18.560 --> 04:24.200]  another tyrant justice Kennedy said constitution is a flawed document and
[04:24.200 --> 04:29.160]  needs to be rewritten we have another article up on info wars.com former
[04:29.160 --> 04:34.640]  intel officer suspects foul play in death of Anthony Scalia and then the big
[04:34.640 --> 04:40.160]  news Russia bans all US corn and soy imports to the GMO contamination Pope
[04:40.160 --> 04:43.960]  Francis calls migration the challenge of our age of course met for the first time
[04:43.960 --> 04:48.200]  in their history with the Orthodox Church you can argue which one's older
[04:48.200 --> 04:52.120]  but the two have been at loggerheads for over a thousand years big things are
[04:52.120 --> 04:56.720]  happening planets are politically aligning we've got huge news on China's
[04:56.720 --> 05:03.360]  economy and more we have previously seen 3d printing technology bring us
[05:03.360 --> 05:08.000]  things like simple household items more advanced components of firearms and now
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.040]  it's being reported that they can even produce body parts a team at Wake Forest
[05:13.040 --> 05:17.920]  University has used a combination of living cells and a special gel to print
[05:17.920 --> 05:23.680]  out human body parts including ears muscles and jaw bones reports NBC News
[05:23.680 --> 05:28.000]  it's an advance on previous attempts which either involved making a plastic
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.040]  scaffold and then trying to get cells to grow in and on it or that printed out
[05:32.040 --> 05:36.680]  organ shapes that ended up being too floppy and dying the new approach mixes
[05:36.680 --> 05:41.200]  live cells with the gel that starts out as a liquid but quickly hardens to the
[05:41.200 --> 05:45.200]  consistency of living tissue the challenge of making living tissue is
[05:45.200 --> 05:49.880]  complicated even a simple structure like an ear as several types of cells and
[05:49.880 --> 05:54.440]  they must all be fed by tiny capillaries you can find more reports on

[07:07.000 --> 07:12.160]  warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense sixty years
[07:12.160 --> 07:17.360]  ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had
[07:17.360 --> 07:22.840]  drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent
[07:22.840 --> 07:27.800]  weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of

[08:19.240 --> 08:26.680]  ladies and gentlemen it is already Tuesday the 16th day of February 2016
[08:26.680 --> 08:32.440]  I'm your host Alex Jones we're gonna be here for the next four hours our
[08:32.440 --> 08:40.080]  reporters have already interviewed multiple public officials down in
[08:40.080 --> 08:49.520]  southwest Texas they are traveling to Marfa to talk to judge Cinderella
[08:49.520 --> 08:54.440]  Guevara right now who did everything by phone and said that she decided he died
[08:54.440 --> 08:59.280]  for natural causes though she never saw the body but she's not a doctor but hey
[08:59.280 --> 09:05.080]  who needs to you know actually do that when you die natural causes I mean
[09:05.080 --> 09:09.960]  Kennedy did as well and in 63 in Dallas also they've already talked to judge
[09:09.960 --> 09:15.760]  Juanita Bishop who was the first one who made the phone call reportedly
[09:15.760 --> 09:20.880]  announcing it was natural causes so just who needs an autopsy who needs any
[09:20.880 --> 09:24.840]  public investigation just just wave your hand and say that you know everything's
[09:24.840 --> 09:28.600]  completely normal here he died of heart attack and then later say he did not die
[09:28.600 --> 09:32.320]  of heart attack even though you don't know why he died but but but he had a
[09:32.320 --> 09:36.480]  pillow over his face and then of course they're gonna be headed out to the ranch
[09:36.480 --> 09:43.840]  itself we'll have that intel by enforce nightly news tonight at 7 o'clock
[09:43.840 --> 09:50.880]  central time so that is coming up they will be joining us in the third hour
[09:50.880 --> 09:56.640]  Larry Nichols who's fighting for his life via cancer and of course the big
[09:56.640 --> 10:01.520]  Clinton insider will be joining us to give us his intel on Scalia's death and
[10:01.520 --> 10:05.440]  what's happening in the world at the start of the next hour and then info
[10:05.440 --> 10:09.960]  wars nightly news political correspondent Richard Reeves will be
[10:09.960 --> 10:15.160]  joining us from South Carolina as he's been doing from the other key battle
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.200]  ground primary states like Iowa and of course New Hampshire covering both the
[10:19.200 --> 10:23.720]  Democrat and Republican race that is taking place there and then Rob do runs
[10:23.720 --> 10:27.560]  the fourth hour will have whatever latest breaking news and Intel then the
[10:27.560 --> 10:31.120]  fourth hour special because people can reset research right at the moment of
[10:31.120 --> 10:34.640]  going on air they're gonna have that special news hour then where you have a
[10:34.640 --> 10:39.240]  lot of guest and reports I mean the fourth hour a lot of days is even better
[10:39.240 --> 10:43.240]  than some of the other hours of the transmission hosted by our great crew
[10:43.240 --> 10:47.680]  like Lee and Macadooj, Kari Jackson, Rob do and so many others like Paul Watson
[10:47.680 --> 10:54.840]  Anthony Gutiarty as we continue to build and expand a truly independent
[10:54.840 --> 11:02.960]  liberty-based libertarian-based pro-human pro-life-based operation to take on the
[11:02.960 --> 11:07.120]  dying establishment globalist media that we are taking it on very very
[11:07.120 --> 11:11.880]  effectively it's my job to take the heat and just to tell you what my gut and
[11:11.880 --> 11:18.120]  what the evidence shows and to not play games and not be a coward that's why I
[11:18.120 --> 11:21.320]  came out Saturday hours after it was announced he was dead did my research
[11:21.320 --> 11:25.480]  and said the fact that they instantly announced that he died of natural
[11:25.480 --> 11:29.680]  causes with a quote anonymous phone call the fact that it's in the middle of
[11:29.680 --> 11:34.320]  nowhere and this this owner of the ranch is a high-level Democratic donor the
[11:34.320 --> 11:40.040]  fact that they are instantly saying no foul play there'll be no investigation I
[11:40.040 --> 11:45.080]  said watch if there's no autopsy and we hear that quickly we know there's major
[11:45.080 --> 11:49.000]  alarms going off and of course the next morning the judge came in on a Sunday and
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.920]  said there will be no autopsy but don't worry he died of a heart attack because
[11:54.920 --> 11:59.360]  I talked to people on the phone who weren't doctors either and a doctor
[11:59.360 --> 12:04.120]  wouldn't say looking at somebody what it was again it's the jumping the gun that
[12:04.120 --> 12:11.040]  lets you know it's like building seven I question building seven because I heard
[12:11.040 --> 12:18.240]  it on CBS news radio that was still around I've been on air all day since
[12:18.240 --> 12:23.240]  that had happened that day I'd ribbon from the studio to get a pizza and to
[12:23.240 --> 12:28.960]  bring pizza back to the crew I had a two people at that time and at 420
[12:28.960 --> 12:32.520]  something they said they're going to blow up the Solomon Brothers building
[12:32.520 --> 12:38.760]  building seven to protect the other buildings and then they blew it up and I
[12:38.760 --> 12:41.280]  went on air and said they said they blew it up and people said called in and say
[12:41.280 --> 12:47.440]  yeah I heard that too and then we found the tapes of NPR and Fox and CNN and BBC
[12:47.440 --> 12:53.560]  two different channels and they said how dare you you liar there's no tapes of
[12:53.560 --> 12:58.720]  anyone saying that and we had all the anchors on TV like seven or eight videos
[12:58.720 --> 13:03.160]  they would have national stories saying Jones is lying and the BBC actually came
[13:03.160 --> 13:07.920]  out and said it's a fake video then they came out of your letter and said no it
[13:07.920 --> 13:12.800]  was actually us and it was a Reuters feed said the building had fallen pancake
[13:12.800 --> 13:20.200]  style completely I don't know what happened on 9-11 I'm not saying our
[13:20.200 --> 13:24.040]  military did it I'm not saying they always phrase it like you say the
[13:24.040 --> 13:28.360]  firefighters blew it up or you say the police did it no I'm saying they said
[13:28.360 --> 13:32.000]  they blew up the building before it even fell and then it blew up and fell
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.920]  there should be an investigation
[13:35.920 --> 13:43.280]  and it's the same thing here when this evidence mounts you've got to have an
[13:43.280 --> 13:47.160]  investigation and when they say how dare you conspiracy theorists even question
[13:47.160 --> 13:51.240]  us when we have known liars running this whole system they have put it in
[13:51.240 --> 13:55.840]  federal law they can kill any US citizen anywhere in the world anytime they
[13:55.840 --> 14:01.640]  want secretly and never tell you including Supreme Court justices and
[14:01.640 --> 14:06.200]  now they're trying to pass the defense authorization act the the the the the
[14:06.200 --> 14:11.120]  war authorization act that will rewrite the war powers and give the president
[14:11.120 --> 14:17.240]  quote worldwide global martial law power that's not Alex Jones that's the
[14:17.240 --> 14:23.480]  senator from Connecticut the Democrat pull it up you can play the clip right
[14:23.480 --> 14:29.280]  now I played it like ten times when we played again that let's let's cue up
[14:29.280 --> 14:34.200]  the senator and I'm gonna play that just because we have new losers all the
[14:34.200 --> 14:37.360]  time and they'll write a news article saying I'm lying and that doesn't exist
[14:37.360 --> 14:41.800]  because this is what they're doing this is the season of takeover this is when
[14:41.800 --> 14:46.400]  you expect stuff like this to happen and the key guy when he doesn't have a
[14:46.400 --> 14:51.080]  security detail drops dead and we're not supposed to question that well you know
[14:51.080 --> 14:56.840]  what Donald Trump and they figured it out I have to give him credit when
[14:56.840 --> 15:03.320]  Donald Trump came on this show they knew that they would attack Trump and call
[15:03.320 --> 15:10.120]  him a 9-11 truther and then what would happen is they would go look at
[15:10.120 --> 15:14.920]  everything I'd said and put it next to Trump and then Trump would basically just
[15:14.920 --> 15:20.680]  say all I'm saying is I was in New York and and Bush says he saved us he let
[15:20.680 --> 15:26.280]  this happen and then it brings out 9-11 truth and absolutely trumps them and I
[15:26.280 --> 15:29.800]  was watching Cheney this morning and we're rearing interview that he had
[15:29.800 --> 15:33.120]  last night on Fox and he was saying Trump wants to say we let it happen or
[15:33.120 --> 15:39.960]  maybe you are even behind it and Cheney looks scared because the truth is folks
[15:39.960 --> 15:43.720]  they bare minimum stood down and bare minimum let Saudi Arabia attack us and
[15:43.720 --> 15:47.560]  there was an Orad stand down that's been declassified and six of the ten
[15:47.560 --> 15:52.480]  commissioners said there was a cover-up and that the 28 pages should be
[15:52.480 --> 15:58.280]  released and that it has the orders for the attacks to not be stopped Cheney
[15:58.280 --> 16:01.920]  Trump way off base with 9-11 claims doesn't know the facts and then he goes
[16:01.920 --> 16:05.320]  on to say oh it was Clinton's fault and Clinton admits it oh give me a break of
[16:05.320 --> 16:09.760]  course Clinton was protecting bin Laden they're all owned by Saudi Arabia and I
[16:09.760 --> 16:12.480]  want to be clear about something it really hit me this morning on the
[16:12.480 --> 16:17.720]  elliptical watching Fox News and I've articulated this but I haven't done it
[16:17.720 --> 16:21.920]  properly and just crisply I was going on rabbit trails you know documenting when
[16:21.920 --> 16:27.840]  I'm saying we've already done that let me just lay it out the CIA director is a
[16:27.840 --> 16:34.160]  known operative Saudi Arabia he's always seen in the in the Wahhabist garb
[16:34.160 --> 16:38.840]  there's a clear intel he's been in mainstream news that he's reportedly
[16:38.840 --> 16:44.520]  privately converted to radical Islam whether that's a double agent deal or
[16:44.520 --> 16:48.280]  whatever it really is and you know Bandar Bush is his nickname one of the top
[16:48.280 --> 16:51.640]  princes always staying with the bushes and saying how much they love each other
[16:51.640 --> 16:55.440]  in Bandar Bush goes on Larry King live two weeks after 9-11 and says don't
[16:55.440 --> 17:02.600]  talk about bin Laden he's a very honorable man and then Bandar Bush
[17:02.600 --> 17:06.960]  threatens to attack the Russian Olympics a couple years ago so this is the
[17:06.960 --> 17:11.480]  type of stuff going on and you've got them bringing them in to Syria bringing
[17:11.480 --> 17:14.840]  them into Libya bringing them into all his other countries like Egypt
[17:14.840 --> 17:19.480]  overthrowing then bringing them into Europe so that when they attack and now
[17:19.480 --> 17:25.200]  the CIA director says it's inevitable that there will be an attack and then
[17:25.200 --> 17:29.720]  when there is an attack logic has been suspended they won't get in trouble just
[17:29.720 --> 17:35.120]  like Merkel or Hollande or anybody else or Bush George W after 9-11 they will be
[17:35.120 --> 17:39.440]  promoted and called heroes if they hijack jets and fly them into buildings

[18:15.040 --> 18:21.080]  isn't even the country that attacked us it's Saudi Arabia no you didn't protect

[24:42.640 --> 24:47.320]  News you name it they are now basically coming out other talk show hosts and
[24:47.320 --> 24:52.040]  saying oh my gosh he's an evil 9-11 truther talk shows Mark Levin has
[24:52.040 --> 24:57.760]  labeled Trump a radical kook you know Levin says a lot of good things and I
[24:57.760 --> 25:00.560]  don't want to sit around be enemies with with mainline conservatives because
[25:00.560 --> 25:04.120]  they're a million light years better than Bernie Sanders who it's now emerged
[25:04.120 --> 25:12.160]  never had a job till he was 40 I mean I'm 42 I had a job when I was 12 and I
[25:12.160 --> 25:17.240]  remember saying there are child labor laws dad you know I need to go get a job
[25:17.240 --> 25:21.680]  there in the summer I already mows some yards and stuff and he said he goes
[25:21.680 --> 25:25.840]  that's a bunch of baloney you go down to the local marina which was a mile from
[25:25.840 --> 25:29.080]  our house we live in a lake and you go ask those old guys in there and tell
[25:29.080 --> 25:32.080]  them you want a job you'll work for whatever they give you if you actually
[25:32.080 --> 25:35.280]  do the job you'll get a raise and if you actually keep doing it you'll have a
[25:35.280 --> 25:39.440]  job there years later don't be a manager and by the time you know two years had
[25:39.440 --> 25:42.000]  passed and I'd worked at the marina they're in the summers they were actually
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.160]  trying to hire me to be a manager at the marina when I was like 14 a manager some
[25:46.160 --> 25:50.480]  of the boat stalls and stuff keeping them clean so like 15 bucks an hour they
[25:50.480 --> 26:00.200]  offered me and I said no it's just crazy I can't imagine I mean by the time I was
[26:00.200 --> 26:05.200]  16 I had big rolls of you know $20 bills in my pocket was buying my
[26:05.200 --> 26:12.960]  unclothes driving a nice used truck taking girls out to movies two to two
[26:12.960 --> 26:20.080]  three nights a week out to restaurants and I just loved having a job I love
[26:20.080 --> 26:27.160]  leaving school and going to work for four or five hours what a warped country
[26:27.160 --> 26:30.640]  where we're gonna have a guy the president of articles on forex.com
[26:30.640 --> 26:35.680]  where he admits and you look at what a hippy freak he was not having a job till
[26:35.680 --> 26:42.520]  he was 40 years old these people live on another planet man I'm so sick of it
[26:42.520 --> 26:51.680]  excuse me point is I don't want to sit here and attack people like Martin
[26:51.680 --> 26:55.400]  Levin but this new talking point is all over Fox News in fact I saw it this
[26:55.400 --> 27:05.520]  morning three times they said that he was basically a 9-11 truth or bordering on
[27:05.520 --> 27:08.520]  a 9-11 truth or as if that's the worst thing in the world and then they
[27:08.520 --> 27:14.160]  misrepresent when 9-11 truth arrest to someone that believes that the NYPD blew
[27:14.160 --> 27:16.840]  up the buildings because that's what they always say to make it sound like
[27:16.840 --> 27:21.560]  you're saying that they built a straw man just like they say Donald Trump
[27:21.560 --> 27:25.400]  wanted five million dollars for himself to be in a debate when he wanted five
[27:25.400 --> 27:30.200]  million dollars given to the wounded warrior program he gave millions
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.640]  himself that turns into he wants to steal veterans money well you have a
[27:35.640 --> 27:39.920]  problem six of the 10 commissioners say we've been lied to the smoking on
[27:39.920 --> 27:44.680]  evidence there was a stand down I've had congressmen and senators on the show
[27:44.680 --> 27:49.920]  former and current that have read it Saudi Arabia ran the attacks the FBI and
[27:49.920 --> 27:55.040]  NORAD were ordered to stand down it will bring these governments down that's why
[27:55.040 --> 27:58.120]  when Jeff bus was asked about it by Richard Reeves last week in New Hampshire
[27:58.120 --> 28:03.040]  he just his back went up straight he got the really aggressive gangster mode not
[28:03.040 --> 28:06.800]  the friendly hey getting my yellow Volkswagen Ted Bundy you know friendly
[28:06.800 --> 28:11.200]  con harness serial killer mode he switched into his real mode oh really
[28:11.200 --> 28:15.560]  yeah I do want to see that got him like to see him that got right Richard's face
[28:15.560 --> 28:22.280]  got him like to see him you see it from the back the Richard was there and said
[28:22.280 --> 28:25.600]  he got right in his face got it turned his back to the camera and looked at him
[28:25.600 --> 28:31.760]  with hate and goes like to see it oh I bet you do see it I bet you know all
[28:31.760 --> 28:36.640]  about it when you vacation to bin Laden family home in Riyadh or when your
[28:36.640 --> 28:39.640]  father vacations with them here in the United States or when your brother
[28:39.640 --> 28:42.880]  ordered that they be allowed to fly out of the country over the week that air
[28:42.880 --> 28:47.920]  traffic was grounded I would cover local CVS pieces out of Miami where they had
[28:47.920 --> 28:51.720]  flight loads flying out and they would get on the news and say Alex Jones is
[28:51.720 --> 28:58.400]  lying and saying the bin Laden's were flown out it was in the Miami Herald but
[28:58.400 --> 29:02.800]  they would say I was a liar I'm gonna come back and play some of these clips
[29:02.800 --> 29:05.400]  and finish up with this to get to the Trump clip the Cheney clip and the rest
[29:05.400 --> 29:10.160]  of it but this is such a big deal folks that all Trump says is you're saying I
[29:10.160 --> 29:13.520]  won't protect you from another 9-11 I'm trying to close the borders and kick
[29:13.520 --> 29:20.360]  the radical Muslims out it was on Bush's watch that we got attacked why is he a
[29:20.360 --> 29:24.640]  hero when they let the attack happen in business if you screw up you get fired
[29:24.640 --> 29:30.440]  and they spend that that he's a mainline 9-11 truth as if that hurts him
[29:30.440 --> 29:34.720]  Trump wants them to go into that briar patch and they're finally doing it so
[29:34.720 --> 29:40.680]  just come on in just come on in Grendel sneak on into the hall we're

[34:19.500 --> 34:24.200]  is it one world the central bank is in charge but aren't we all just living and
[34:24.200 --> 34:31.620]  dying from what the central banks do. And for me give me liberty or give me death.
[34:31.620 --> 34:38.900]  Live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones and we're live on this
[34:38.900 --> 34:43.140]  Tuesday worldwide transmission our reporters are in southwest Texas an
[34:43.140 --> 34:45.700]  incredible job driving down there last night they've already interviewed one
[34:45.700 --> 34:49.020]  of the judges that was involved they're interviewing the other judge as we speak
[34:49.020 --> 34:52.620]  and they're gonna go out of that ranch and get some answers something mainstream
[34:52.620 --> 34:55.860]  media won't do. I'll tell you what leadership is I hit the barbed wire
[34:55.860 --> 35:00.660]  Saturday and as usual people are asking me are you sure about doing this and
[35:00.660 --> 35:04.020]  coming out and saying we should look into this as being a murder and I said
[35:04.020 --> 35:09.180]  yes under jurisprudence under common law under history and under state and
[35:09.180 --> 35:14.020]  federal laws the default has always been have an autopsy the more powerful a
[35:14.020 --> 35:19.180]  person is it is unheard of to not do that when he didn't have a security detail
[35:19.180 --> 35:24.740]  it is unheard of when they keep changing the story it is unheard of when you have
[35:24.740 --> 35:29.380]  judges making medical examiner announcements and then changing I mean
[35:29.380 --> 35:36.780]  this thing is so ridiculous I don't just default come out on air and say that
[35:36.780 --> 35:44.140]  something stinks you think I'm happy that that's about a 98% chance they
[35:44.140 --> 35:47.980]  killed Scalia you think I want to be the one that breaks it you think I want to
[35:47.980 --> 35:52.820]  be the one that runs over the top the first one to go up against the machine
[35:52.820 --> 35:56.340]  gun nest but I will do it and I'm telling you this in case something does
[35:56.340 --> 36:02.660]  happen to me I know the people to step up it's only way to save your family now
[36:02.660 --> 36:06.420]  we have the Associated Press we have the New York Post we have so many
[36:06.420 --> 36:11.660]  publications today it took two and a half days to break down their Berlin wall
[36:11.660 --> 36:15.940]  they wouldn't even mention an autopsy they wouldn't even mention foul play by
[36:15.940 --> 36:20.740]  Sunday they started mentioning why no autopsy then the pillow over the face
[36:20.740 --> 36:26.780]  and now we're gonna cover this after I cover this other news detectives question
[36:26.780 --> 36:33.020]  lack of autopsy in Scalia death New York Post the head of the New York homicide
[36:33.020 --> 36:40.980]  squad says every default position was ignored the story got changed a bunch
[36:40.980 --> 36:49.780]  this is insane oh I'm a cook but the New York detective head of homicide says
[36:49.780 --> 36:54.620]  this is insane they've got former Intel operatives they've got former it's all
[36:54.620 --> 36:59.380]  over the place Michael Savage says looks like he was murdered oh what does Michael
[36:59.380 --> 37:04.140]  Savage know you know he's just made billions of dollars in real estate
[37:04.140 --> 37:06.820]  nutraceuticals and is the all-time best-selling author and pretty much
[37:06.820 --> 37:11.340]  launched the entire organic food movement under another name another
[37:11.340 --> 37:16.020]  gnome to plume what is a guy with probably a 200 IQ no let's not listen to
[37:16.020 --> 37:21.300]  him let's not listen to Alex Jones the cook let's not listen to police detective
[37:21.300 --> 37:25.620]  head let's just listen to CNN because they just said he's dead that's it
[37:25.620 --> 37:29.780]  forget about it move on well you know what we're not moving on because you
[37:29.780 --> 37:38.820]  said so we're not moving on because you say you're God
[37:38.820 --> 37:46.420]  we're not moving on because you call us names when CBS and the Sydney Morning
[37:46.420 --> 37:50.860]  Herald call me a cook and a nut and hall he's do you have contacts that eat
[37:50.860 --> 37:53.700]  dinner with the Supreme Court justices and that say that total tyranny is
[37:53.700 --> 37:58.540]  coming in 2016 and watch out they're coming after everyone oh no you don't
[37:58.540 --> 38:02.700]  have those contacts do you talk to three former heads of army special forces
[38:02.700 --> 38:07.060]  and people above that do you have the former head of psychological warfare
[38:07.060 --> 38:11.220]  for the State Department on it over through seven countries do you live in
[38:11.220 --> 38:16.660]  the real world do you have green beret commanders Delta Force people in studio
[38:16.660 --> 38:21.420]  on air that admire your work no you don't you don't have anything but
[38:21.420 --> 38:27.140]  dishonor and the fact that you're flat jaw scum that sit there and repeat the
[38:27.140 --> 38:31.460]  same garbage that you're given in talking points over and over again so get
[38:31.460 --> 38:37.780]  this through your heads okay scum you don't control the narrative anymore and
[38:37.780 --> 38:41.340]  you're gonna be brought to justice when we take this country back for aiding
[38:41.340 --> 38:45.140]  and abetting a foreign takeover and this is a foreign takeover and you will
[38:45.140 --> 38:50.260]  fail just get that through your heads
[38:50.260 --> 39:01.420]  Donald Trump represents factions in the government and in corporate America that
[39:01.420 --> 39:04.580]  don't want to bring the country down and don't want to enslave us and don't
[39:04.580 --> 39:10.620]  want to bankrupt us with clout and pivot I can tell you that that's been
[39:10.620 --> 39:17.940]  signaled from high levels before we were ever contacted by the Trump people and
[39:17.940 --> 39:22.180]  Donald Trump knows exactly what's going on didn't know just five years ago looks
[39:22.180 --> 39:25.820]  completely different is totally freaked out and basically sees himself on a
[39:25.820 --> 39:30.620]  suicide mission if you really want to get into inside baseball Donald Trump is
[39:30.620 --> 39:35.740]  ready he is full bore and just committed and sure you call him an
[39:35.740 --> 39:39.180]  egomaniac and the people that have assessed him say he's a good egomaniac
[39:39.180 --> 39:46.780]  and he's the type we need and they just admire him so much and these are high
[39:46.780 --> 39:53.100]  level government people you can put two together CIA you name it and I mean the
[39:53.100 --> 39:57.100]  last generation that actually overthrew governments actually did stuff on the
[39:57.100 --> 40:02.980]  ground didn't just play around with a bunch of NSA spy gear they understand
[40:02.980 --> 40:05.900]  the takedown of the country is happening right now and they're not perfect but
[40:05.900 --> 40:09.060]  they don't want to kill the United States of America they don't have a score
[40:09.060 --> 40:12.940]  to settle like Loretta Lynch and Obama and Hillary who want to mount the
[40:12.940 --> 40:16.780]  country's head on a wall and fully bankrupt us and in the country and then
[40:16.780 --> 40:22.460]  have a war against everybody they don't control the Democrats broke some big
[40:22.460 --> 40:26.100]  rules what they did is they tried to basically merge both parties and
[40:26.100 --> 40:29.740]  inserted blackmailing everybody and said we're not going to work together as
[40:29.740 --> 40:33.460]  parties anymore of corruption we're going to consolidate power which always
[40:33.460 --> 40:38.500]  happens in the tyranny it always degenerates to this point and now that
[40:38.500 --> 40:45.820]  point has been reached and all hell is breaking loose you don't just think
[40:45.820 --> 40:50.540]  Scalia just died and that that's an isolated incident do you
[40:52.540 --> 40:56.700]  there is a war for this country going on at every level of government corporate
[40:56.700 --> 41:02.100]  America right now why do you think the big mercenary outfits have left the US I
[41:02.100 --> 41:08.380]  mean the cloak and dagger level of what's going on is so seismic I can hardly
[41:08.380 --> 41:13.260]  even broadcast I'm so blown away I it's not even freaked out I'm just a
[41:13.260 --> 41:22.460]  marveling the headline is Pope Patriarch meeting Cuba nearly 1,000 years
[41:22.460 --> 41:38.340]  after the split this was yesterday we talked about a few days ago and it
[41:38.340 --> 41:45.860]  didn't hardly get any coverage no actually they've never met both churches
[41:45.860 --> 41:50.860]  officially started showing up about a hundred years after the death of Christ
[41:50.860 --> 41:59.860]  and the resurrection and they've been at each other's throats the entire time
[41:59.860 --> 42:08.260]  and the fact that they're meeting lets you know folks that major earth-shaking
[42:08.260 --> 42:14.460]  events are about to happen that is just one more indicator and it's happening
[42:14.460 --> 42:19.420]  everywhere the signs the signs the signs Saudi Arabia announcing they've already
[42:19.420 --> 42:23.020]  begun invading Syria to fight up against Russian troops and the word is they're
[42:23.020 --> 42:26.820]  using jihadis in Ukraine now against the Russians with our government
[42:26.820 --> 42:32.740]  financing it I mean this is war crimes that make the head spin and when all
[42:32.740 --> 42:36.460]  this comes out that our illegitimate government did this it will destroy our
[42:36.460 --> 42:41.740]  name forever that's why the Pentagon it came out under General Dempsey we told
[42:41.740 --> 42:47.460]  us for it was in the news that's our sources General Dempsey went to the
[42:47.460 --> 42:52.100]  White House when they were about to air bombard and take over Syria two years
[42:52.100 --> 42:56.140]  ago and said the military is going to revolt including top generals we are not
[42:56.140 --> 42:59.860]  gonna back al-Qaeda we are not gonna exterminate the Christians we are giving
[42:59.860 --> 43:03.180]  intel to the Russians to and we're already on the ground to fight them you're
[43:03.180 --> 43:07.580]  not doing this and they let Dempsey sit there for a year and a half before they
[43:07.580 --> 43:13.180]  put his replacement in but they did a purge of the top brass to try to make
[43:13.180 --> 43:18.980]  sure they could carry out the next phase and now they're doing it so that's
[43:18.980 --> 43:25.700]  what's going on boys and girls that's what's happening but you notice our
[43:25.700 --> 43:30.540]  victory there should be an investigation and autopsy of someone that's
[43:30.540 --> 43:34.420]  prominent when it just comes in on a phone call that natural causes now go
[43:34.420 --> 43:39.740]  to sleep and they act they try to act like I was a nut Saturday and Sunday and
[43:39.740 --> 43:43.540]  attacked me all over the place and then notice he gave everybody else the cover
[43:43.540 --> 43:48.060]  police detectives former intelligence operatives other talk show hosts and
[43:48.060 --> 43:51.740]  people to come out and go well there was a pillow over his face well they did
[43:51.740 --> 43:54.620]  change the story over and over again well the Democrats are celebrating his
[43:54.620 --> 44:02.220]  death why shouldn't we look into this you see and I'm not up here bragging about
[44:02.220 --> 44:08.980]  what I did I'm giving you other talk show hosts other media people just a
[44:08.980 --> 44:13.540]  lesson in leadership you cannot when you know you're doing the right thing sit
[44:13.540 --> 44:17.740]  around and wait for other people to get behind you before you step out first
[44:17.740 --> 44:22.820]  you've got to be the person that sticks their head up first you've got to be the
[44:22.820 --> 44:25.260]  person that leads the charge you understand that that's what we're
[44:25.260 --> 44:30.380]  looking for here is leadership the only reason I'm so prominent the only reason
[44:30.380 --> 44:34.100]  I get so many of the leaks and so much of the Intel the good Intel is because
[44:34.100 --> 44:38.380]  people know I've been around 20 plus years they know where I came from they
[44:38.380 --> 44:43.540]  know who I am they know who my family is that we're as American as it gets
[44:43.540 --> 44:48.500]  continually committed to this country and we will never sell out anybody we
[44:48.500 --> 44:52.740]  will never screw over little people we will never oppress people we will fight
[44:52.740 --> 44:59.180]  for freedom until the death and that's it now who else is gonna join us in this
[44:59.180 --> 45:04.420]  fight that's what I'm asking you right now because this isn't a game we have
[45:04.420 --> 45:08.980]  succeeded in waking up a lot of people but we've not yet removed the globalist
[45:08.980 --> 45:19.260]  and we're far from it and this is a serious battle I want to get into the
[45:19.260 --> 45:22.260]  rest of 9-11 news and back in the school I haven't even got into it yet but
[45:22.260 --> 45:30.020]  before I go any further funder operation right now I'm not gonna belabor this
[45:30.020 --> 45:35.100]  because of the seriousness of where the world is right now I'm just gonna say
[45:35.100 --> 45:38.980]  that we sell what we believe are the best Liberty based t-shirts to spread the
[45:38.980 --> 45:42.540]  word and awaken folks and to meet like-minded people in your area and it

[48:55.380 --> 49:03.340]  essential now I'm gonna settle down and just finish up with the 9-11 information
[49:03.340 --> 49:07.900]  then I'm gonna get into Scalia and then of course a bunch of guests coming on
[49:07.900 --> 49:12.060]  today as well but as we prepare to go out to break I mentioned this yesterday
[49:12.060 --> 49:17.180]  but we played a different clip this is the CIA director Brennan who lives in
[49:17.180 --> 49:20.740]  Saudi Arabia for much of his life and runs around in the hobbyist outfits and
[49:20.740 --> 49:24.500]  does everything he can to empower Al Qaeda and give him weapons but claims he's
[49:24.500 --> 49:28.780]  got to take our rights away because it's imminent and then it's a near
[49:28.780 --> 49:34.900]  certainty what's the exact word he uses exact word is well let's go ahead and
[49:34.900 --> 49:40.180]  play the clip and hear what he had to say is ISIS coming here I think ISIL does
[49:40.180 --> 49:45.460]  want to eventually find its its mark here you're expecting an attack in the
[49:45.460 --> 49:51.660]  United States I'm expecting them to try to put in place the operatives the
[49:51.660 --> 49:56.540]  material or whatever else that they need to do or to incite people to carry out
[49:56.540 --> 50:01.940]  these attacks clearly so I believe that their attempts are inevitable I don't
[50:01.940 --> 50:05.540]  think their successes necessarily are okay so it's inevitable they're gonna try
[50:05.540 --> 50:08.580]  to attack like San Bernardino or all these other attacks you guys say aren't
[50:08.580 --> 50:13.420]  terrorism and he's sitting there with his stuff so shirt with his fake report
[50:13.420 --> 50:18.340]  of things those of the ISIS will try to attack us this is our government hijacked
[50:18.340 --> 50:22.980]  government arming them defending them and blaming Assad for chemical attacks
[50:22.980 --> 50:27.540]  they've launched now Brennan admits no actually they launched a chemical attack

[54:17.740 --> 54:25.580]  Sider knows a lot of the top folks in Washington on record and the Clintons
[54:25.580 --> 54:29.220]  have said even the New York Times are scared of Larry Nichols I figured I
[54:29.220 --> 54:34.940]  needed to talk to him to see what he knew about Scalia's death and I don't know
[54:34.940 --> 54:38.980]  if he's gonna get into this on air yet but it's just over the top stuff and I
[54:38.980 --> 54:44.620]  just I wish I didn't even have to know all this and I wish the general public
[54:44.620 --> 54:48.500]  not you the listeners folks that are looking for the truth are informed in
[54:48.500 --> 54:52.420]  many cases more than I am but I just wish the general public you go look at
[54:52.420 --> 54:56.180]  young people nowadays there's a lot of great smart young people of every race
[54:56.180 --> 55:02.100]  color and creed but you look at them they look so sheep like people look so
[55:02.100 --> 55:08.300]  weak and then I see the guys that think they're tough but you talk to them and
[55:08.300 --> 55:12.980]  they have no intellectual information they have no rudder they have no place
[55:12.980 --> 55:17.940]  they came from so I used to bash guys that tried to act tough and that ride
[55:17.940 --> 55:21.180]  around on motorcycles and everything and you know the thing they were like the
[55:21.180 --> 55:26.500]  phony you know the phony tough but I realized they're you know they are
[55:26.500 --> 55:30.020]  probably tough and they just don't have any background and they're trying to
[55:30.020 --> 55:33.660]  look for something to be a man well if you want to be a man now's the time and
[55:33.660 --> 55:37.460]  it means getting in front of people it means going to the city council and
[55:37.460 --> 55:44.900]  speaking out I mean look I didn't have any skills when I was 19 and started
[55:44.900 --> 55:47.940]  going and speaking to city council and county commissures all I knew is they
[55:47.940 --> 55:51.460]  were trying to pass stuff and do things at the city and state level that was
[55:51.460 --> 55:56.620]  violating the Constitution and my rights and I felt threatened by it I was a
[55:56.620 --> 56:02.820]  fighter all my life before that I didn't realize what it was all meant for but I
[56:02.820 --> 56:05.980]  wasn't going to roll over and it wasn't because I was looking for a fighter had
[56:05.980 --> 56:12.380]  something to prove I knew instinctively I had to stand up or I'd be a slave and I
[56:12.380 --> 56:17.820]  just asked where is that basic instinct in people where is this idea that you
[56:17.820 --> 56:21.460]  lay down and then you get away with stuff and then nothing ever happens to
[56:21.460 --> 56:26.460]  you a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves coming up the next hour just a
[56:26.460 --> 56:30.180]  few minutes away Larry Nichols and Richard Reeves from South Carolina our
[56:30.180 --> 56:34.900]  political correspondent so much more than our reporters from the ground in
[56:34.900 --> 56:39.700]  Southwest Texas on a dangerous mission to go down there and investigate the
[56:39.700 --> 56:46.220]  death of Scalia I've talked to some of the establishment folks and that is
[56:46.220 --> 56:51.300]  people big in the media who were at the establishment level and they are
[56:51.300 --> 56:57.660]  concerned obviously and you know folks see this for what it is it's about a
[56:57.660 --> 57:04.980]  98% chance 97% chance it was he was killed but we're going out to break here
[57:04.980 --> 57:09.820]  since I mentioned 9-11 I thought I'd mentioned the senator senator Murphy
[57:09.820 --> 57:13.100]  from Connecticut because I mentioned this 30 months ago saying they're trying
[57:13.100 --> 57:16.700]  to pass worldwide martial law powers for the president in the military
[57:16.700 --> 57:22.620]  authorization legislation and so I wanted to play that clip here just is
[57:22.620 --> 57:27.740]  working madam president today I want to come down to the floor to speak very
[57:27.740 --> 57:32.220]  briefly about a resolution that the majority leader introduced I believe
[57:32.220 --> 57:38.460]  earlier today this is an authorization for military force resolution that
[57:38.460 --> 57:41.900]  apparently purports to give the president legal authority to conduct
[57:41.900 --> 57:47.060]  military operations against ISIS before we break for the weekend madam president
[57:47.060 --> 57:51.820]  I thought it was important come to the floor to explain why very briefly to my
[57:51.820 --> 58:01.500]  colleagues excuse me to explain what this resolution really is this resolution
[58:01.500 --> 58:08.540]  is a total rewrite of the war powers clause of the United States Constitution
[58:08.540 --> 58:13.940]  let's be clear about that it is essentially a declaration of international
[58:13.940 --> 58:20.740]  martial law a sweeping transfer of military power to the president that
[58:20.740 --> 58:26.940]  will allow him or her to send US troops almost anywhere in the world for almost
[58:26.940 --> 58:33.740]  any reason with absolutely no limitations all right that is US
[58:33.740 --> 58:37.780]  senator Christopher Murphy they'll be back with the second hour stay with us
[58:37.780 --> 58:41.540]  that's just the climate we're in folks that's just like that happens it's not

[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:43.140]  investigative journalist I'm so proud of somebody like that on the payroll here
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.460]  because he's worked with some of the biggest newspapers in the country a real
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.980]  bona fide investigative journalist he is on the ground has already talked to the
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.620]  embalmer of Scalia and more so now we're gonna learn some stuff we never
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:58.460]  told what happened once he got to El Paso then he was calling out to
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:03.220]  Virginia we're gonna have info for you Michael Savage said yesterday we had him
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.740]  on back during the office I said let's see what Savage is doing turn it on this
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:09.780]  looks like a murder to me the cowardly media won't investigate the police won't
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:13.420]  investigate where are the journalists and then we emailed him and he's invited
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.180]  me on many times and we said hey you want to have David Nodder Joe Biggs on
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:21.300]  your show today you can say Michael Savage reporters we don't even care about
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:25.100]  the credit we just want to get the in his courses nice and give us credit but
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:28.340]  we just don't care about the credit neither does he Michael Savage doesn't
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.860]  need money being a radio host he's a very successful entrepreneur in his own
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:36.140]  right and he's doing this because he cares about the country and he's not
[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:40.140]  perfect I'm not perfect it's not about that the point is is that he's saying
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.660]  yeah where's the media where's the coverage where's the investigation 20
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:47.500]  years ago you'd had a hundred news trucks down there a day later you'd have
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:51.300]  folks talking about what you saw what went on why isn't there an autopsy now
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:57.100]  they say it's bad to even ask for an autopsy you see because we have a judge
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:02.460]  say that she says he died naturally because she heard it over a telephone
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:05.260]  maybe she can tell us what the weather is gonna be next week because she's a
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:14.460]  meteorologist now without reading the newspaper so we've got him and Wayne
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:19.540]  Madsen in El Paso he's gonna be popping in in the third hour and then we also
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:24.580]  have Joe Biggs David Knight Josh Owens who are are have already interviewed one
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.900]  of the judges now they're interviewing the second judge and then they're gonna
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:32.620]  be talking to folks the ranch very very soon I'll just leave it to you at that
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:36.460]  in fact I'm almost tempted to not have them hang out and wait to be on the show
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.260]  and just get the mission on down the road but I want them to also be able to
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:44.660]  report so I'll just get to them quick and then and then go on here's the
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.980]  problem you get to some of the so-called larger towns and they barely have
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:53.660]  internet where this ranch is there is no internet there's barely cell phone I've
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:57.260]  been out in the general area I've been a few miles from this ranch and I've been
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:00.460]  all over that area since I was you know three years old that's where we go
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:06.460]  vacation since I was a kid so I know it well and it's built up a lot to what it
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:12.820]  was 35 years ago 37 years ago 40 years ago when I was down there and of course
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:19.300]  I was just down there last year twice but it's creepy when you're out in the
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.660]  middle of a mountainous desert and your cell phone won't work for a hundred
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:27.660]  miles in all directions you just get it you know used to having that cell phone
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:31.660]  and then when you don't have it it's like being back in the 1980s or 70s where
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:35.100]  you know all you got to CB and it doesn't work either it is it is creepy and
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:40.780]  poor old Scalia in my view we need to investigate it walked into a very
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:46.140]  mysterious set of circumstances and it's only got more mysterious and more
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:52.900]  Agatha Christie since then and that's why you got the headlines now oh I'm a
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:57.660]  kook I'm a crazy guy Saturday saying they came out too quick with the info they
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:00.340]  better have an autopsy oh of course there's on an autopsy oh there's a pillow
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:04.420]  over his face they're changing the stories wasn't a heart attack but they're
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:09.700]  not gonna tell us why this is like catching a guy in a black mask in your
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:13.140]  bedroom robbing your wife's jewelry and you say hey buddy what are you doing he
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:16.860]  goes nothing but you're wearing a black mask these aren't your wife's jewels you
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:21.060]  go those aren't my wife's jewels these aren't the droids you're looking for move
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.500]  along move along and they try that with people and it just doesn't work with me
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.340]  if they'd have said we don't know we're having autopsy blah blah blah and say
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:33.940]  well he might have died naturally but not the way they acted we're gonna go to
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:38.820]  break here in about 20 seconds detectives question lack of autopsy in
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:44.620]  Scalia death oh that's the New York Post oh the Daily Mail the Associated Press
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:50.900]  the head of the homicide investigations group in Washington DC has come out I
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:55.220]  saw another one where it was in New York questioning it so so that's that's to I
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:05:00.060]  was conflating the two but oh these are evil detectives though we have
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:04.540]  previously seen 3d printing technology bring us things like simple household
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:08.900]  items more advanced components of firearms and now it's being reported that
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:14.420]  they can even produce body parts a team at Wake Forest University has used a
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:19.020]  combination of living cells in a special gel to print out human body parts
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:24.980]  including ears muscles and jaw bones reports NBC News it's an advance on
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:28.740]  previous attempts which either involved making a plastic scaffold and then
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:32.860]  trying to get cells to grow in and on it or that printed out organ shapes that
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:37.540]  ended up being too floppy and dying the new approach mixes live cells with the
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:41.900]  gel that starts out as liquid but quickly hardens to the consistency of
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:46.340]  living tissue the challenge of making living tissue is complicated even a

[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:29.420]  a girlfriend defense of human liberty Alex Jones
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:41.740]  amorello's on my mind all right it's George straight bringing us in with an
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:49.540]  old but a good amorello by morning up from San Antonio and we are joined for
[01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:55.020]  the next 30 minutes by Larry Nichols former special operations Green Beret
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:09:02.660]  and clandestine operations recruited into governmental operations in Arkansas
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:07.380]  which are actually national operations for the Dixie Mafia run out of
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:10.860]  Arkansas and that's a government integrated group just so you know for
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:13.820]  the folks that aren't in on that information I can tell you that personally
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:17.940]  from what I know about Austin Texas and the history here and so he got into the
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:22.180]  inside of it he was the guy behind the Clinton Chronicles he's the person in
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:25.980]  the New York Times that the Clintons say they fear the most and we should pray
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:30.100]  for him he's battling cancer right now he's a tough old egg and he joins us on
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:37.420]  Clarence Thomas you know is he in danger and I'm just gonna leave it at that see
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:44.940]  what he has to say about it and how that ties into the Scalia situation we
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:50.540]  have at least Scalia dying and obviously very suspicious circumstances and first
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:56.340]  I want to get Larry Nichols take on that what is inside and tell us if any and
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:10:02.220]  then we're going to get into the election as well and what this signifies
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:07.140]  if this is a hit now the good news is since I came out first Saturday and
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:11.540]  said them announcing when he died right away of natural causes with no proof
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:15.620]  with an anonymous phone call is over the top suspicious and if they say no
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:21.260]  autopsy quickly you know that it's a 90-something percent chance that they
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:25.660]  killed well the next morning the judge comes in and says there's gonna be no
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:31.100]  autopsy I mean they are acting as guilty as you catching your kid up on the
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:34.060]  counter with their hand in the cookie jar okay are you walking on your wife
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:37.300]  you know in bed and her legs behind her ears I mean this is I don't mean to talk
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:42.220]  like that folks this is bad okay and they look up at you and they say there's
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:46.780]  nothing going on here now that might work in movies like Star Wars or Obi-Wan
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:50.780]  Kenobi says these aren't the droids you're looking for but this is the most
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:54.580]  over-the-top ridiculousness I've seen since family Malik the Arkansas
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.460]  medical examiner you'd find people with their arms and legs cut off in trash
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:01.860]  bags and he'd rule it suicide folks you can't chop your arms and legs off put
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:08.380]  yourself in trash can okay so I want to believe he died of natural causes but
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:13.100]  he's the one key guy holding it all back but now former New York top homicide
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:20.180]  squad detectives gone public and the top detectives currently former and current
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:23.860]  it's a whole groups are coming out saying the defaults are being ignored in
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:28.940]  DC saying that and the police I know are saying absolutely I mean I talked to a
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:33.340]  police officer this morning that I ran into that I know that's with his brother
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:36.940]  and he said oh my gosh everybody sees right through this I mean this is
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:41.580]  ridiculous now I'm gonna get Nichols view I haven't talked to him since this
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:44.980]  happened I couldn't get a hold of him yesterday he said it could come on today
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:49.900]  he joins us to go over this and I appreciate him coming on we've got
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:53.740]  former intel officers CIA people coming out saying it stinks to high heaven
[01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:57.780]  Michael Savage saying it so they've tried to shut down any discussion of this
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:03.060]  or even a discussion of why isn't there an autopsy but it's not working they've
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:07.380]  now changed the story more than 10 times so Larry Nichols God bless you my
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:12.180]  friend thank you so much for coming on with us you bet Alex thanks for having
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:18.180]  me buddy I see you got a tracheotomy there brother boy tell your tougher
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:24.300]  nails people come on the air with us well I'll be here I'll be here till the
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:28.980]  match between me and Hillary I'll be around until that one I promise you that
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:34.100]  we're praying for brother thank you you know this time yesterday Alex I had not
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:40.860]  talked to anyone and I was cautioning everyone everyone be careful you know
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:45.020]  true definition of a patriot I believe Alex is one that seeks out the truth
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:51.660]  and I wanted to be certain of the truth before I did the program with you or
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:59.500]  anybody else about Scalia unfortunately just about an hour ago some
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:04.140]  of the information I'm getting I mean I'm gonna be honest guys this thing
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:09.060]  starting to wreak I have it now I'm not saying Alex I have any proof I hope
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:14.340]  everyone hears me I'm not saying I have proof that there was anything evil
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:21.300]  sinister done to him but some of the stuff that I'm getting now is showing
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:26.220]  signs very reminiscent of the old Clinton days around here you know like
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:30.100]  you said the family Malik days people don't remember that I do I have to
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:36.980]  remember it very well and we're in a situation with Scalia to where this
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:42.100]  thing's burning out of control now who did it why did they do it if it was
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:48.660]  done all I can tell you Alex is usually when it walks like a duck quacks like a
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:54.820]  duck it's gonna be a duck and I'm afraid that's where we're headed but let's not
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:14:00.180]  forget one thing there are two important things that are going to affect the
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:05.580]  career the future of this nation forever this election for the presidency and
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:14.220]  now the appointment of the Supreme Court justice so you tell me what does it
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:19.100]  look like to you what does it look like now election wise we've got to stay
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:23.860]  focused but who remember what we used to do Alex with the old Clinton days with
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:27.940]  the Arkinsides as we called them in the day there was one thing you always did
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:31.420]  you had to commit a suicide that was impossible or died death it was
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:36.900]  virtually impossible but at the same time who was the only person that
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:44.700]  benefited keep on him now look at this case who are the only people that
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:51.740]  benefit from Scalia died at this opportune moment who and I'm telling you
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:57.580]  it's starting to look bad starting to look bad for the long team but we'll no
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.620]  more you know now I mean of course you knew this ever because you were there
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:07.180]  running the governor's office but Hillary gives orders directly to the
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:11.580]  entire press exactly how to write articles or they're kicked out and and so
[01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:15.580]  what I saw was the media instantly get in line with the fit with the story not
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:20.580]  ask questions not go down there and just shut up it was clear the order was
[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:26.580]  there to shut it down it was like when Donald Trump came on there were 2,500
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:33.260]  something articles in the first six hours and then the next day none I mean
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:37.700]  almost none and that's because the order went down shut up about that interview
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.620]  because they didn't want what was in an interview to be heard trumpet be
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:43.900]  expected to blow up expected to be attacked for being on the show that
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:49.020]  was his plan they were sophisticated enough to drop it only after six hours
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:53.180]  realizing it was a time bomb and so I mean that's how sophisticated they are so
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:58.220]  I see the media control in the first hours of this and then the and then the
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:01.020]  judges saying we're not going to do an autopsy and all the rest of it and then
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.500]  the pillows on the face is that a message to everybody though that is
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:11.180]  awake I think I think they're trying to let us know I think they're kind of let
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:16.860]  someone know Alex and I'm afraid that someone may be Donald Trump that
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:26.820]  someone may be the other judges on the court judges you talk to yes that you
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:31.580]  know we can get to anybody wouldn't it be a hell of a message we can get to
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:38.900]  me you can't get any higher than Chief Justice Scalia you just can't do it I
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:43.060]  mean there's obviously a war in the establishment right there's a war in the
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:47.620]  establishment you were on here two weeks ago and you said if they go after
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:50.860]  Hillary anymore people are gonna start dying we ought to pull that up the
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:53.900]  blackmail is gonna begin there's gonna be a war like a mafia war that's what it
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:17:00.780]  is right and so who does really benefit from his mysterious death well that
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:04.740]  that's that's the key thing that I'm trying to that's the thing I'm trying
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:10.540]  to figure out and I'll tell you this and guys get ready every time the Clintons
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:17.900]  getting their power people are gonna die people are gonna die this is not the
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:23.980]  first and this won't be the last you notice Alex back here behind me buddy I
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:29.740]  got old Betsy my little 18 inch buoy that I keep with me even here at the
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:34.660]  house because I'm telling you these people play rough am I saying Hillary
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:40.100]  ordered them dead no am I saying somebody actually whacked him no but from
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:48.140]  everything I see somebody sent in somebody a message and I think it's a
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:52.740]  pretty vivid message that this is big league ball Alex do you understand this
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:58.340]  is for the power of the most powerful nation in the world I know I mean let me
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:04.020]  tell you I people envy the position I'm in it is not fun entering into the
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:08.420]  absolute big leagues of not just the US but the world and knowing these killers
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:13.380]  are killers and knowing that the other Supreme Court people and other prominent
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:17.180]  media folks are actually barricaded up right now I mean you know behind the
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:23.020]  scenes we don't say everything we know obviously I mean this I just I just wish
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:29.060]  the public would wake up to this you know Alex if you tell me that a Chief
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:35.860]  Justice could die like Scalia in the industry just die I mean just pure the
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:42.660]  old guy and the media would shut it down like they have I would say you're
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:49.220]  crazy but you see here we go here we go with the Clinton nieces all over again
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:55.820]  I'm telling you this something connected to all of this and the message is
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:19:02.180]  being sent out and I guarantee you this the biggest decision we've got in this
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:06.060]  nation as I said it's who's gonna be our next president now dear God hope it's
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:11.900]  Trump but he better be careful and then the next decision is who goes on the
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:17.260]  Supreme Court because the next Supreme Court justice that gets picked
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:22.460]  determines whether that court goes completely to the left or still has some
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:29.300]  semblance of going to the middle we're gonna get into that it's so incredibly
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.380]  important and I'm not doing this anymore today that I'm skipping this network
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:33.660]  break as we have limited time with you and this is this is for the whole future
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:38.180]  the country even WorldNet daily has the article that the public is questioning
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:43.020]  the fact that John Poindexter had a special ops command background like you
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:47.660]  in Vietnam that's who these people recruit is Army Green Berets is like
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:52.180]  the favorite generally into these special governmental positions this guy was
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:56.500]  involved over key hedge funds highly CIA connected he worked in World Trade
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:00.460]  Center 7 I mean I just go on and on and then John Poindexter was given a
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:05.460]  special award by Obama made for him just a few years ago for his secret
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:10.140]  operations in Vietnam this is the guy that Scalia eats dinner with who says
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:13.780]  everything about him that night he goes to bed he's not out two hours at the
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:17.700]  breakfast he goes in says he felt something might be bad and finds him
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:21.180]  with a pillow over his head now I'm sure mr. Poindexter is a really sweet
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:26.780]  commando like yourself just a little lovey creature but what do you think
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:30.300]  about all this I mean you just add that in there and he didn't bring his security
[01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:34.980]  detail his son didn't go at the last minute I mean this is this is just over

[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:41.780]  they're all just repeating whenever the national media says we've got a team of
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:46.860]  five people two different teams on the ground in El Paso and also out in El
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:51.740]  Pine and out at that ranch and they're coming up and and this is real media I
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:56.420]  mean this is what it's all about police detectives all over the country
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:22:00.460]  prominent ones that headed whole divisions are saying there's a cover-up
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:05.460]  going on we're not seeing anybody did anything go ahead go for you that I go

[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:23.700]  they pull back in then I walk back out and they back up and I take it out and
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:27.300]  we've been to your house we've been to your house I mean it's a it's a rural
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:34.140]  area that's right so you know was it something Alex I don't know well buddy I
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:40.700]  know you got more than booing I know you got more yeah booing I'm sure if I have
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:45.200]  to but I just like Jim boo he was sick on his back at the Alamo probably killed
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:51.660]  20 people himself so you just lay back you know right there look I don't know
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:23:00.060]  what's going on Alex I don't you and I've been a part of it before and it's
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:03.500]  coming again I don't want to see it come again but it's coming again I have a
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:08.340]  sick feeling I have a sick feeling you know and I don't know what more I can
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:14.660]  do than to say hey Hillary's gonna be the Democratic nominee for president hang
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:20.900]  on and watch be Trump is the only hope we have with the RNC short of Trump's
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:26.500]  gonna be Bush and if it's Bush against Hillary we've got no chance and then it
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:33.260]  gets down to me and Hillary and the question is can I stop Hillary with the
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:37.580]  information and evidence and the things that I have and let's be clear let's be
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:42.100]  clear the stuff you told me over the years continues to come out to be
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:46.060]  accurate I haven't been given any info yet that no one else knows cuz I don't
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:49.420]  want the SUV coming and it's not that we were scared of that in a way but I'm
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:52.420]  not gonna get killed cuz they're so scared of the info I got until I get
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:55.220]  info then I'll get the info out and then they can do whatever they want I want
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.020]  to make sure the mission is complete you know here before something like that
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:04.220]  happens but I mean I mean specifically though we know Supreme Court
[01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:11.660]  justices are scared I can promise you that from when I've talked to yes but I
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:17.620]  will tell you this you know Alex just think about you I think about me all
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:22.660]  the time because who I am and who I'm in the way of getting what she wants just
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:28.180]  think about you now think about the fact that you might because of your program
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:34.780]  because of the strength of your audience think about how you're in between
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:41.020]  something don't know what it is but you're in the way now that's right cuz
[01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:45.660]  the media knows it's mafia the media knows they follow orders the entire
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:55.380]  media to just shut up and so now you're sitting here you and a handful of other
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:25:02.700]  conservative reasonably conservative not talking about you but others and you're
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:07.460]  in the way of something big you're in the way of something awfully awfully big
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:10.540]  I can feel the danger let me tell you Saturday morning and I've only done this
[01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:14.460]  like four other times I called up do and my key managers and I said get to the

[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:21.580]  hours and the last two it had already broken we didn't even know cuz I was in
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:25.180]  my conference room and I was actually live streaming saying something big
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:30.060]  is about to happen I don't even know this had happened yet is the SUV back
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:36.140]  yeah that's right there let them sit there I mean long as you're sitting there
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:41.060]  and I'm sitting here I'm not that worried can you turn your computer maybe
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:45.300]  take it over the door I tried I tried I can't I was going through but I can't
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:52.100]  let me up when I see they're backing up so I think they're listening to us

[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:21.740]  now I mean I would if I could I just can't I just can't because it was no I
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:28.260]  get it but now we know in case they kill you right now I get it and it's big
[01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:35.740]  that's all I can tell you folks it's big I mean and you didn't even bother no
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:39.740]  man you're talking to Supreme Court Justice right they didn't even bother
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:46.540]  to cover this up in any reasonable manner I mean don't you see that folks
[01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:53.420]  they they didn't even bother to hide it I mean this is in your face Alex this is
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:58.540]  in your face this is saying it's like kind of a John F Kennedy you know if we
[01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:02.060]  can kill the president of the United States right in front of the American
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:07.340]  people everybody see it nobody can do anything about it get real get real and
[01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:10.900]  then they killed hundreds of people to cover that up and this gets about as
[01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:17.460]  real as it gets just about as real as it gets now maybe maybe we're gonna find
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:23.220]  out in the rest of the day we're gonna find out somebody just died of old age
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:31.660]  I doubt it I doubt it now and I doubt they're here to wish me related happy

[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:30.980]  things he's been up up to look Donald Trump I'm afraid is starting to succumb
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:36.860]  to the trickery of the of the RNC you know when he started yesterday kind of
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:40.300]  waving up that contract saying that you know the Republicans violating their
[01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:46.700]  agreement you know to treat him fairly Donald Trump if he is listening if he
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:52.100]  will stay in the Republican Party he'll win that primary Alex because of the
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:57.100]  landslide they can't still landslide they can't stop it now if he breaks out

[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:56.540]  folks and he doesn't obviously because he doesn't want them to kill him and then
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:00.540]  it looked like it was the cancer so he doesn't want folks knowing that but they
[01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:06.500]  know and so the point is is that he's not he's done the not he don't resuscitate
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:11.100]  forms now and everything and he's got a he's got a tracheotomy right now in his
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:15.820]  neck if you're a radio listener and he's a tough old bird but he is fighting for
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:19.220]  his life right now so pray for him by the way they've tried to bankrupt and
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:24.700]  destroy him that's why he's got $20 cell phone a Nichols live at AOL.com if you

[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:13.420]  they think we're they think we're cowards like they are who is it what
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:20.540]  it's just all about you know here again they're sending a message to somebody
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:26.580]  who knows Alex maybe you have you looked outside your building oh we're not
[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:33.060]  really worried about it you know we're just doing our duty here that's why I'm
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:37.420]  not afraid no I mean I'm so sick of having to fight these people I mean I
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:41.020]  have a duty I don't want to die and I want to be here for my children but the
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:48.140]  final equation play your hand like you know like John Wayne says in true grit
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:58.300]  just feeling I am yeah like that it's a and I don't know what to say it's not
[01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:06.820]  our country anymore it's not the country we know it's not and I guess that's why
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:11.860]  we've got to fight folks this is not the country we were brought up in this is
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:17.540]  not the kind of stuff you're supposed to have happened simply by speaking the
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:22.140]  truth simply by simply by putting out the truth I don't know that anybody on
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:25.780]  this program Alex I certainly haven't I know you haven't since I've been here
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:31.500]  and always put anything out that's detrimental to anybody's investigation or
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:35.540]  causing any problems hell as far as I know there is no investigation no there
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:39.300]  is no investigation we were told when it was announced that he was dead there
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:42.660]  being no investigation the most suspicious thing ever and then they said
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:46.580]  by the way there was a pillow on his head and he just a mess with us so that
[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:49.860]  those of us in the know would freak out and then the general public would just
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:58.100]  believe it well just stay focused folks please remember don't let this be a
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:06.020]  distraction no don't don't let them don't let them distract us from the
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:09.500]  mission at hand I'm telling you this this election will be the last
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:15.700]  presidential election we'll get to be a part of Alex it is I'm sorry it is and
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:20.660]  I'm going to tell you something folks we've never had more power than we have
[01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:24.580]  right now because every one of the politicians that are running for office
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:28.660]  member third of the Senate's having to run every member of Congress is having
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:32.980]  to run and they know this country's about to come down they know it's about
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:38.500]  to come down and they want to be there Alex when this country falls they want
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:45.140]  to be a part of the centrist government that's left over and they know if
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:52.340]  they're defeated this election they're out forever forever and then they they
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:58.460]  then they can be prosecuted so they're cornered rats that's right and that's
[01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:03.460]  another thing that you have to realize about Hillary Hillary is a cornered
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:11.900]  rat now maybe not from the email scandal that everybody thinks is so bad but
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:16.380]  Alex she's a cornered rat with the stuff I had well I'll tell you those those
[01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:21.180]  Navy SEALs up there the survivors of Benghazi and say they were all on the
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:24.260]  sat phone getting orders directly from the State Department that they've been
[01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:27.380]  ordered to stand down they were security for the State Department and they got
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:32.340]  direct orders to stand down from their bosses and then Hillary's a big fat
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:37.180]  liar you know saying that she didn't do that was obviously a stand down well I
[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:44.220]  promise you this there it's winter lose for Hillary and when I say winter lose
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:49.300]  you understand Alex this winter lose for her either she gets to be what she's
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:54.380]  wanted to be since she was four years old the first female president of the
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:59.380]  United States of America and then the most powerful couple in the history of
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:05.780]  the world either they get that or she goes to jail it's not a joke it's not a
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:12.620]  game and I think if you look at some of the decisions being looked at by the
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:20.420]  Supreme Court I think you see who benefits by Scalia dying and I think
[01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:23.940]  that's where you need to start start looking at what decisions and remember
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:30.460]  this Alex in 1970 I believe it was Congress passed a law saying no president
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:39.500]  in his last year of office can appoint an interim Supreme Court justice unless
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:45.420]  one thing exists and that's a crisis in the court and that's the nuclear option
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:51.260]  and since we are at a four four tie therefore the court can't really go
[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:56.300]  forward notice he was the key guy the key guy at the key time and Obama says
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:43:00.380]  he's gonna operate under emergency rule with open borders everything else I
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:05.460]  mean this is and then one of his top donors and he gives personal awards made
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:11.420]  up just for him oh my gosh I mean they really think we're stupid and then
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:15.540]  there's something that people don't know about Alex I didn't know about that
[01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:20.820]  this until this weekend did y'all know that since 2012 Obama signed a
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:26.420]  presidential special order in a hundred miles on either side of our border to the
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:32.340]  north to Canada a hundred miles either side south to Mexico east to the Atlantic
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:38.100]  Ocean west of the Pacific a hundred miles inland is considered or called
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:42.780]  what's called a no constitution zone that's official actually calling it
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:48.000]  absolutely and guys that means if you live within a hundred miles of the
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.420]  border of Mexico Canada the Pacific Ocean or the Atlantic Ocean you don't have a
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:58.100]  constitution to protect you it was done away with well I mean look at the NDA a
[01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:00.740]  look at look at how they're trying to give Obama martial law powers in
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:04.220]  Congress the Republicans they are really positioning and now they're trying to
[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:10.460]  start a war with Russia Larry Nichols I want you to stay keep your skypond we're
[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:13.980]  gonna go to Richard Reeves here in just a moment we're putting that constitution
[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:19.620]  free zone up on the screen for TV viewers from ACLU this is not a joke 100
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:23.060]  miles zone and now they're just practicing it there most the population lives
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:28.100]  within you know a hundred miles of the border or the Atlantic or the Pacific
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:32.140]  truly unprecedented my friend but God bless you we're gonna talk to you again
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:38.780]  tomorrow obviously or tonight we do not want to wait any on the news that you
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:45.580]  gave us and again you didn't give me the details you but I think it's safe just
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:50.780]  isn't it safe to tell folks at least what you told Nico and I so that so so at
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:55.780]  least that's out or you can't even tell us just know that years ago and Alex you
[01:44:55.780 --> 01:45:00.380]  remember this I worked very closely with a Supreme Court justice that happened
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:05.860]  to be in a bind getting confirmed and because of that I have a relationship
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:11.980]  now it's a personal relationship it's not an official but it does create a bit
[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:19.940]  of a problem legally but just know this that I'm not making stuff up and I have
[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:26.100]  no power to get data or get information but a certain person does and I'll have
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:31.100]  it that I assure you and well some people say why are they talking about it on
[01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:36.380]  air they'll know now his phones are listened to our car okay we have few
[01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:41.660]  not just computers we have people listening 24 hours a day and so we're
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:46.220]  putting light on this so good people in agencies but can blow this operation
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:49.340]  whatever's going on that's why we always announce where we're going and what
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:53.100]  we're doing because that puts eyes on us with the good guys and that's what
[01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:56.140]  really threatens them now Larry is it back when you were first exposed to
[01:45:56.140 --> 01:46:00.340]  stuff 20 something years ago we didn't have all the people in government
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:03.500]  convinced like we do now and there's so many good people just like you were a
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:07.580]  green beret in the system but you wouldn't kill kids that was you're like
[01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:11.100]  Tony Montana you said that's it I'm not killing little kids I'm not killing you
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:14.300]  know you I'm gonna expose you know that that's a whole other show with you and
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:18.140]  it was all proven what you said it all came out the drug dealing me know all
[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:21.620]  of it because you know you said you hit your knees you cried you said Christ I
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:25.060]  you know can't you know you know be part of this you hit rock bottom and you know
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:27.980]  just like you're on the cross beside Christ he said that tonight will be in
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:31.580]  paradise my brother and that's why these guys have to worry that are cowards and
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:36.100]  serve the system but more and more I don't know special ops people that aren't
[01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:40.180]  awake a lot of the feds are evil or they're leftists and they get off on it
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:43.500]  they hate the patriot movement and they're into power because they have been
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:47.340]  able to find the mentally ill military folks to kind of fill their ranks but
[01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:51.900]  that's a very small group of trash and not even all the feds are like that
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:55.620]  either so they've got to be looking over their shoulder and we're not afraid to
[01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:59.580]  die that's the difference between us and I know I'm not speaking for you but I
[01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:03.020]  mean I just know that's how you feel Larry because you couldn't do what you do
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:10.460]  if you were a coward I'm probably a coward but you know you're not a coward
[01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:14.940]  that's ridiculous why would you say that well you just know where to run
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:20.180]  there's nowhere to hide this is my country it's my grandbabies I mean I ask
[01:47:20.180 --> 01:47:23.260]  everybody listening us right now there's got to look around there's got to be
[01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:29.580]  something or someone you love so much that you would give everything to protect
[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:34.900]  that's what this is about this is about the great lady our nation that's what
[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:39.060]  this is I mean we're talking about something right out in my front yard

[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:37.620]  Trump this whole battle but I tell you Richard if you're able to hear what
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:42.340]  Nichols is talking about this is just chilling stuff and you can see the SUV
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:45.740]  that's there that drives off as soon as he comes out you know with the guys in
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:48.540]  suits clearly trying to intimidate him we've experienced that at Bilderberg
[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:52.020]  you've experienced we got video of that

[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:05.300]  warriors say prayers for Larry Nichols right now I know if all the info warriors
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:08.900]  take action with prayer that there's no way these guys in the SUV are gonna touch
[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:13.260]  Larry Nichols and they will immediately flee because that's what evil people do
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:16.580]  when the light shines upon them so let's just say our prayers that Larry
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:21.460]  Nichols is protected and is able to get out and defeat Hillary ultimately all of
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:26.620]  us need to on that it's just amazing how I guess it's divine timing that it seems

[01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:20.460]  Southwest Texas they've been talking to the judges the embalmers something no
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:26.040]  one else is doing we were already sending them down there yesterday but I
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:29.020]  heard Michael Savage saying where is the media where are the reporters where
[01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:34.020]  are the people that aren't cowards I'm not up for saying I'm Mr. Tough Guy when
[01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:38.220]  you think about these globalists want to keep babies alive and harvest their
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:46.300]  organs they're evil and and good people have to stand up against them folks go
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:50.340]  but they kill people they're gonna kill everybody if we don't stand up against
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:55.820]  them back to Richard Reeves in South Carolina Richard Key Intel Trump is
[01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:59.980]  surging after he came out and said that Bush wasn't a hero he let us get attacked
[01:54:59.980 --> 01:55:03.300]  by 9-11 bare minimum that's revolutionary chain he's crawled out from
[01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:09.420]  under a rock they're panicking right now boy I tell you Trump is the real deal
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:13.060]  Richard I gotta tell you he is he is the number one target to I'm really worried
[01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:17.340]  about him absolutely he's the number one target and Alex I'll tell you what the
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:22.020]  RNC did such a big mistake another big mistake this past Saturday when they
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:25.660]  stacked that audience it was a little over a week ago that I came on live and
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:28.780]  popped in with David Knight that we talked about how the audience was stacked
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:32.380]  up in New Hampshire for the Saturday night debate and how that was a big
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:35.500]  mistake and how Donald Trump when he really won that debate was when he
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:38.580]  called out that audience and said that's the donor class that's up there that's
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:42.420]  the lobbyist up there in the crowd I think that was a winning moment then
[01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:47.340]  fast forward to last Saturday in South Carolina here at Charles or Greenville
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:52.540]  South Carolina and the RNC made that huge mistake I'll tell you what the meme
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:57.900]  and the theme here in South Carolina is no more Bush's no more Clintons and so
[01:55:57.900 --> 01:56:01.900]  that's that this this battle is going on within the Republican Party for the
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:07.500]  primary for the nomination is going and flooding the Democrat race to with that
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:11.020]  meme of no more Bush is no more Clinton so that that's another reason why
[01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:15.060]  Hillary is in trouble you know because she's got this Republican race that's
[01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:18.300]  impacting her that I think they never answered right and you were here months
[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:22.660]  ago obsessing over it you were right and you had stolen and everything saying
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:25.940]  they're gonna try to steal the super delegates but because the public's
[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:30.260]  educated about it now they dare not do that to Trump they dare not do it to
[01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:33.900]  Hillary as they keep stealing from Sanders when he wins by 20 points in
[01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:37.780]  New Hampshire they're now admitting in the news she can't even do that again it
[01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:41.620]  will cause a revolution they're doing the same old tricks they did decades ago
[01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:47.620]  in an awake public it's not gonna work Richard no exactly and that's just it
[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:52.100]  picture this the way I one scenario I see is that they do steal the nomination
[01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:56.020]  for Hillary they give it to her by a handful of delegates the Bernie Sanders
[01:56:56.020 --> 01:57:00.980]  people will be so upset so angry they either go home and don't show up on
[01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:06.020]  general election day or crossover and vote for Trump so you know what at this
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:09.620]  point if Hillary gets nomination or Sanders gets nomination I'm kind of
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:14.620]  flip a coin hey flip a coin six times right so it doesn't really matter because
[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:19.860]  the Democrats are just such in deep trouble with what's going on but talking
[01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:23.300]  about what went on here last night changes subject a little bit with George
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:28.020]  W. Bush you know I've been to a lot of events I've been to you know Texas State
[01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:34.580]  conventions I watched the RNC on TV you could really feel the bad the negative
[01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:40.020]  vibe in this room right behind me where George W. Bush spoke and Jeb Bush spoke
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:45.060]  afterwards they just don't have it the RNC the Republican National Establishment
[01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:47.900]  the Republican National Committee establishment they're on their last
[01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:52.300]  layer they're a bunch of doddering degenerate mafia scum we're sick of them
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:57.660]  and they got Saudi Arabia's hand up their rear puppeteering them yes
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:01.060]  unfortunately the people around the United States and especially here in
[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:04.780]  South Carolina where you know you've talked about how that you never expected
[01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:08.820]  to be speaking to the warrior class and that's exactly what we've had to have
[01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:13.580]  here in South Carolina we have tons of warrior class we have active duty we
[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:19.340]  have retired folks we have you know the veterans we have the families here and
[01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:24.140]  then the we have also the donor class though when it comes to the you know the
[01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:26.820]  big budget guys the ones that are benefiting from all this military
[01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:30.620]  spending they're here as well but I'll tell you what the majority of folks that
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:34.900]  are got the feet on the street are gonna be voting to oust the establishment
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:38.420]  that's right stay there Richard back in 70 seconds with hour number three then

[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:49.660]  you've got to admit it's imminent to stop it from happening we've got the
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:52.700]  White House funded groups trying to start a race war in this country new
[02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:56.140]  developments there we've got just a bunch of news I'm going to get to in the
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:01:01.300]  next segment and then we've got a reporters coming on from two different
[02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:06.780]  cities we've got two different teams investigating the Scalia death and again
[02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:11.220]  folks I'm a media person I've been doing this 21 years it's unprecedented to have
[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:15.740]  crickets out there on no autopsy and the story changing then all the weirdness
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:21.340]  and it being a commando black ops guy donor that Obama made a special award
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:25.140]  for who tells us the whole story of house khalia died with a pillow over his
[02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:29.380]  head I mean maybe he did die natural causes and this script was written to
[02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:33.540]  make us think they killed him because I'm sorry Richard I'm ranting I want you
[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:38.580]  to come back on if you can in the fourth hour when Rob do's on because you got so
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:40.980]  much good stuff to say and so much has happened but the few minutes we've got
[02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:44.820]  left what else do you have to add Richard there in South Carolina well
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:49.420]  regret with regard to the end in Scalia situation the Supreme Court justice that
[02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:53.820]  passed away that or probably met an untimely death by who knows what means
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:02:01.180]  you know it was just pure irony that on any other given day Barack Obama probably
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:06.940]  has a role of constitutional toilet paper that he picks up his dogs poop out
[02:02:06.940 --> 02:02:11.940]  of the White House lawn you know he's got two dogs named bow and sunny and then
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:15.740]  on this given day though the judge passes away the justice passes away and
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:19.740]  he's out there citing his constitutional duty and responsibility just
[02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:24.700]  unbelievable hypocrisy that on any other given day it's just like this is the
[02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:29.260]  you know the Constitutionist toilet paper so it's amazing to see how the these
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:33.340]  it is just not Obama you know we hear this from Republican House members
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:36.500]  Democrat House members on we're hearing from both sides of the aisle they'll
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:40.100]  come out and actually cite the Constitution on the rare occasions that
[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:43.540]  they think it benefits them it's just disgusting to see and hear that and
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:47.100]  that's why we're hoping to see a lot of establishment characters get flushed
[02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:51.340]  down the primary I'm sorry to interrupt you with the break earlier you were
[02:02:51.340 --> 02:02:57.180]  gonna finish up to with the bushes last night yes yes you know I've been to
[02:02:57.180 --> 02:03:01.500]  nothing these events I could kind of feel the pulse waning from the Republican
[02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:04.580]  establishment now that doesn't mean they're gonna go away they're not going
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:08.940]  away Alex they deal they do still have a delegate strategy you know because the
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:12.900]  New World Order will demand that and the NWO has an electoral college strategy
[02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:17.300]  beyond when the nominees are selected we can talk about that in upcoming shows
[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:21.260]  but for now we'll talk about they do they still have a delegate strategy we
[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:24.460]  see how they can turn out an audience they've proved it twice that they
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:28.220]  proved it more than twice I've seen it before but in New Hampshire they proved
[02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:32.460]  how they can turn out their establishment audience they proved this last week
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:38.020]  it's like the movie Gladiator with Maximus where they just keep piling more
[02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:40.900]  and more people and trying to kill him and they can't do it and they're
[02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:45.620]  turning him into a hero it's totally obvious that it's rigged no and you know
[02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:49.080]  it really worked out in so many ways of because I think that really did get
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:53.700]  Donald Trump upset and that's why he started breaking out with some 9-11
[02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:58.340]  truth they have no idea they have no idea I had it telegraphed I'm just gonna
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:03.260]  say that well three months ago when you brought the Trump folks in here it was
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:06.540]  telegraph but them bringing in that audience to really kind of like the
[02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:10.780]  fuse to Donald Trump that's what really just no no I agree I'm saying the
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:13.980]  establishment that's why they're so scared of me no Trump actually knows
[02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:17.740]  what's going on right Richard I want to come back actually is the delegate
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:20.900]  process you're an expert on this you know you've been a delegate you're
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:25.260]  involved precinct chair all that stuff you have been obsessing on this for the
[02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:28.700]  14 years I've known you or not I've known you like you've been working for us
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:32.500]  often on 14 years but I've known you longer than that but you've been
[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:36.020]  obsessing on it for 14 years come back spend five minutes on the delegate
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:40.700]  process how that finally woke folks up when when Hillary lost by 20 points but
[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:43.780]  still got more delegates in New Hampshire then I'm gonna hit all the news I
[02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:48.180]  haven't gotten to yet Richard Reeves from South Carolina I'm Alex Jones I
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:51.460]  think it's pretty clear now if you're a new viewer or listener we're doing
[02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:54.940]  pretty important stuff here the enemy doesn't want this stuff get now please
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:05:00.700]  help us spread the video and audio links in our articles we have previously
[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:05.420]  seen 3d printing technology bring us things like simple household items more
[02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:09.700]  advanced components of firearms and now it's being reported that they can even
[02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:15.300]  produce body parts a team at Wake Forest University has used a combination of
[02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:20.020]  living cells and a special gel to print out human body parts including ears
[02:05:20.020 --> 02:05:25.900]  muscles and jaw bones reports NBC News it's an advance on previous attempts
[02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:29.740]  which either involved making a plastic scaffold and then trying to get cells to
[02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:33.900]  grow in and on it or that printed out organ shapes that ended up being too
[02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:38.980]  floppy and dying the new approach mixes live cells with a gel that starts out as
[02:05:38.980 --> 02:05:43.060]  liquid but quickly hardens to the consistency of living tissue the
[02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:47.460]  challenge of making living tissue is complicated even a simple structure like
[02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:52.100]  an ear as several types of cells and they must all be fed by tiny capillaries

[02:07:58.820 --> 02:08:14.340]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:33.980]  people like Barry Goldwater and countless others 40 50 years ago wrote books they
[02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:40.420]  gave speeches they warned us about everything happening then the CIA run
[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:46.780]  by British intelligence and others was able to take over the Republican
[02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:51.980]  party through national review and other movements they double-cross Richard
[02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:55.500]  Nixon because he didn't want to shut the country down kicked him out for minor
[02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:59.660]  crimes compared to what they planned this is all come out Kissinger set him
[02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:07.260]  up and now they intend to basically finish the country off they've already
[02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:12.820]  moved their industries overseas and to make the country a minor power everything
[02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:19.180]  they've done is to destroy the nation but there was a generation of libertarian
[02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:23.820]  conservatives and just patriots that heard Barry Goldwater who was in the
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:27.300]  Senate intelligence meetings and I was told all this stuff we're gonna merge
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:30.300]  world government we're gonna take rights away we're gonna end the family and he
[02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:37.900]  said you're crazy he went out and told everybody and it was others as well not
[02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:42.500]  just him but the John Burgers and others were just a hundred percent that on I
[02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:45.500]  mean just absolutely they had it boom because they had all these insiders and
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:49.100]  government that weren't traders giving them the actual battle plants it's
[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:56.220]  literally they had the battle plants and so the media then demonized for
[02:09:56.220 --> 02:10:00.100]  decades that group people that were like but they knew they they'd seen the
[02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:03.420]  documents they and then they and then oh now you see everything they warned
[02:10:03.420 --> 02:10:06.660]  about coming to fruition and the globalists had met there about 15 years
[02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:14.500]  behind because of those movements in the 50s and 60s and now look how they were
[02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:19.980]  a good-sized wave but nothing compared to the waves that came and and now
[02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:22.220]  they're not gonna just have super delegates and steal elections and you
[02:10:22.220 --> 02:10:28.300]  say conspiracy theory on the news and then steal the nomination now there's
[02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:31.260]  gonna be a debate about how the delegates work there's gonna be a debate
[02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:35.820]  about how the parties in 1972 the Democrats changed the rules where the
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:40.860]  party decides with the super delegates the public's going what you mean it's
[02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:46.700]  rigged yeah see now we can have these debates now we can expose what's
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:51.220]  happening because of the countless people that wrote books and had radio
[02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:55.940]  shows and called into radio shows and called into c-spanning got made fun of
[02:10:55.940 --> 02:11:02.180]  everything you look at the culture now we've taken over so they go no one will
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:06.180]  question Scalia's death it was natural no autopsy an anonymous phone call
[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:09.900]  nothing to see here move along we went hey that looks pretty suspicious shut up
[02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:14.060]  kook and then now detectives all over the country head detectives in New York and
[02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:18.500]  DC are coming out and this is outrageous this this is totally stinks to high
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:23.620]  heaven oh you weren't able to shut us down and here's the deal put a bullet in
[02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:26.980]  my head set me up put me in prison they got lots of stuff you know they've been
[02:11:26.980 --> 02:11:31.700]  trying to cook the problem is they their own system won't do it and their own
[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:34.940]  system knows we're good and there's people in there exposing the criminal
[02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:39.420]  elements so they more and more actually on their heels they're not just flat
[02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:42.300]  footed they're in trouble that's why they're doing bold moves and letting
[02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:46.700]  everybody know they killed Scalia or if they didn't they came up with a work
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:50.020]  they're smart with a report that makes it look like they did you understand how
[02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:58.620]  key that is there was a pillow on his face too I'm at the line I was getting
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:12:02.700]  special awards for myself I mean you'd have to be a moron not to see this
[02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:08.780]  message just like the Godfather they're getting attacked they're getting taken
[02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:13.220]  out by another family all of a sudden there's a this just got delivered open
[02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:17.940]  it up it's brown paper with a bulletproof vest with fish in it they go
[02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:22.100]  watch this it's a Sicilian message it means Luca brought see sleeps with the
[02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:27.580]  fishes you think it's just the Italian mafia that sends messages that's the
[02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:32.660]  oldest thing in the world the Romans you know it's salt the earth you know the
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:37.340]  British put your heads on pikes by the impeller put people on spikes some
[02:12:37.340 --> 02:12:42.140]  message I'm surprised I didn't have a severed head of a horse in the bed
[02:12:42.140 --> 02:12:46.820]  withing dead or maybe cut his head off like Arkansas and say it was that
[02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:50.540]  Richard just encapsulate the delegate process why it's so important and it's
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:54.180]  got to excite you to see it one of the biggest stories now when Hillary
[02:12:54.180 --> 02:12:57.780]  arrogantly steals an election in New Hampshire and you know steals it in
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:01.060]  Iowa people aren't buying it anymore I mean the veils really coming back
[02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:06.260]  because they're having to exert all their fraud now to stay in control that's
[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:09.820]  right Alex and ultimately what it is is when you've got these state primaries
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:14.180]  and state caucuses picture them more like just beauty contest these are beauty
[02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:18.220]  contest that lead up to the big conventions and it's those delegates
[02:13:18.220 --> 02:13:22.700]  those delegates on the convention floor that ultimately make the decision who
[02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:26.060]  their nominee is going to be on the Democrat side Republican side now
[02:13:26.060 --> 02:13:31.020]  traditionally for the last however many decades for decades literally the
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:35.500]  establishment Democrats have controlled their delegations in the Democrat
[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:39.780]  nomination commission convention and all the same thing on the Republican side
[02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:42.980]  we've seen that they've just taken it for granted that they're large and in
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:47.660]  charge that they cannot be overthrown but the good news is is that infall
[02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:51.780]  warriors patriots and revolutionaries on both sides left and right whether
[02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:56.300]  they're wrong or incorrect they are infiltrating these operations the
[02:13:56.300 --> 02:14:00.940]  question will be is will they infiltrate the operations in big enough numbers to
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:05.540]  make the difference I think absolutely it's got to happen this cycle on the
[02:14:05.540 --> 02:14:10.740]  Republican side and fortunately we've had warm-ups to this we had the 2008
[02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:15.380]  warm-up with Ron Paul we had the 2012 warm-up with Ron Paul once again and
[02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:18.100]  Alex that's another thing that needs to happen is there needs to be a
[02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:22.820]  conversation with Rand Paul here because potentially the Rand Paul faction in my
[02:14:22.820 --> 02:14:27.420]  book would have probably represented about 20 to 30 percent of the delegates
[02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:32.500]  showing up to Cleveland so Ron Rand Paul dropping out that could be a big loss to
[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:37.220]  our cause if those folks stay home if they don't act that could be very
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:43.060]  detrimental because it's going to be those patriots those Liberty seekers and
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:47.540]  info warriors that get up to Cleveland that are gonna actually agree with you
[02:14:47.540 --> 02:14:52.460]  and you know I obviously might want to call Rand Paul up but I think it needs to
[02:14:52.460 --> 02:14:55.740]  happen I'm gonna reach out I'm gonna reach out to him I'm gonna reach out to
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:59.900]  come on as a guest on the show I'll have to go through back channels around his
[02:14:59.900 --> 02:15:02.900]  would be handler some of the staff some of them are good some of them are just
[02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:06.540]  atrocious and I'm just honest about that because I respect Rand Paul he's a great
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:12.420]  man I wish he would become president and I know that he's good I trust him you
[02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:18.780]  know but but but here's the deal we know Bernie Sanders and Hillary are
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:24.940]  pure evil we know the whole power structures against Trump Trump is now
[02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:29.740]  getting more Rand Paulish exposing the stand down on 9-11 exposing these wars
[02:15:29.740 --> 02:15:34.540]  are wrong and so you know maybe if he came out and said I'd like to meet with
[02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:39.940]  Trump I know we've disagreed a lot I've said some bad things but maybe you know
[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:43.300]  maybe he'll actually listen to me a little bit and like when we used to
[02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:46.860]  play golf maybe I could get behind him because you know he just said some
[02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:51.820]  things that rub in the wrong way haven't all a branch do that because the way his
[02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:56.380]  polls have also fallen in Kentucky precipitously since he came out against
[02:15:56.380 --> 02:16:01.500]  Trump eight months ago is attacking Trump Trump represents populism Rand I
[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:06.620]  know your politicos don't tell you this but but you're a smart guy dr. Paul he
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:11.580]  represents populism and it doesn't mean you have to fully endorse him but just
[02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:16.980]  like Lou Rockwell who helped get your dad elected said here just last week
[02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:20.820]  Donald Trump's the best of what we got and you can't go against him because
[02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:26.060]  he represents populism that will hurt you you will probably lose the Senate if
[02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:31.460]  you don't go anti-establishment and just come out and just endorse Trump okay
[02:16:31.460 --> 02:16:36.740]  I mean you need to do it and it needs to happen and and because I want you to stay
[02:16:36.740 --> 02:16:40.380]  in the Senate and then and then down the road you're so young end up being
[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:44.140]  president man come on use your brain and I don't like to sit around lecture
[02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:48.220]  people but I know what I'm doing from 21 years old building one of the biggest
[02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:52.020]  independent media operations that reaches 28 million people a week
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:56.500]  conservatively and it's changing you know the world with our our empowered
[02:16:56.500 --> 02:17:00.060]  listeners that that believe me I don't know how you could see that any
[02:17:00.060 --> 02:17:05.100]  different okay I'm sorry Richard I've got news to cover and I'm ranting it's
[02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:09.340]  just that I'll tell you what Alex what you just covered is so important I don't
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:12.340]  even know if you realize how important it is I'm telling you the Rand Paul
[02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:18.380]  faction they can send 20 or 30 percent of the of the co-hold delegation that
[02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:22.140]  shows up in Cleveland 20 or 30 percent that could be made up of Rand Paul
[02:17:22.140 --> 02:17:27.820]  folks alone that's a big chip in in Rand Paul's corner and they could deliver a
[02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:31.380]  Donald Trump nomination so it's super important they get there as a matter of
[02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:35.980]  fact my thing is if those folks don't go up there then the RNC could very well
[02:17:35.980 --> 02:17:40.500]  have the same operation that they did here this past Saturday in Greenville the
[02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:44.420]  same operation they did in New Hampshire two Saturdays ago they could just have a
[02:17:44.420 --> 02:17:49.460]  total repeat of what what went on with the stacking absolutely I mean Rand Paul
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:55.500]  is a great guy and he shouldn't make it a a contest you know over egos but I
[02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:58.780]  would say the same thing you know the Trump people so when you talk to our
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:02.340]  countries at stake Alex our country the Trump people need to behind the scenes
[02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:07.740]  do an olive branch to Rand Paul it needs to be a two-way street you know what
[02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:10.900]  whoever does it let's just get it done because it's got to happen it's got to
[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:13.740]  happen what about Ted Cruz you know I love the stuff he does against the
[02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:17.340]  Federal Reserve I love how he exposes al Qaeda being globalist run I love I see
[02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:22.540]  ends of the Second Amendment I just love so much of what he's been doing and then
[02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:26.900]  to see him pull really nasty tricks I mean other people could have pulled those
[02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:31.460]  tricks those are standard tricks and then he just man there's just something so
[02:18:31.460 --> 02:18:37.140]  you talk about robotic Rubio's like the dumb robot and and then and then Cruz is
[02:18:37.140 --> 02:18:40.860]  like a super robot because he always knows what to say and always what to do
[02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:45.940]  but then but then behind the scenes leaves a trail of really nastiness
[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:49.900]  Alex that is very interesting to find out what's going on and he doesn't
[02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:53.260]  necessarily the only thing he's ever you know kind of taking the responsibility
[02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:57.340]  for is what happened with Carson up in Iowa but you do have to wonder if
[02:18:57.340 --> 02:19:01.740]  there's not other dirty tricks by other enemies doing some of these shenanigans
[02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:05.140]  we never had confirmation one way or the other about you know Donald Trump said
[02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:08.980]  there was some really nasty robocalls going out that are implemented by the
[02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:13.020]  Cruz campaign I haven't been able to confirm that one way or the other and
[02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:16.100]  so it's just interesting to see what is your bottom line what is your bottom line
[02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:19.780]  on Cruz well the bottom line is this Alex you and I talked about it several
[02:19:19.780 --> 02:19:23.740]  years back when Cruz was running for Senate I like what Cruz had to say if
[02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:27.540]  nothing else he's waking people up if nothing else he's bringing home the
[02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:31.540]  Liberty message basically almost a hundred percent almost in full warrior
[02:19:31.540 --> 02:19:35.460]  message so Ted Cruz keeps saying what you're saying keep bringing people into
[02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:39.100]  this revolution of taking our country back absolutely you know what if you
[02:19:39.100 --> 02:19:43.060]  betray us in the long run at least you walk people up that's a good point I mean
[02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:46.500]  Bernie Sanders is an avowed communist who openly never worked until he was 40
[02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:49.940]  until he got a government job wants to put us basically enforced labor camps I
[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:53.620]  mean that's what socialism and communism is and Hillary's just a flaming crazy
[02:19:53.620 --> 02:20:00.180]  tyrant just a bloodthirsty bloodbath demon

[02:24:10.100 --> 02:24:16.260]  info wars dot com and Wayne Madsen report dot com on the ground in El Paso
[02:24:16.260 --> 02:24:19.540]  Texas where Scalia's body was taken and there's been no investigation by the
[02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:22.340]  media of what was done with it or trying to actually talk to the folks the
[02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:26.900]  funeral home he's successfully done it he's got big news here for us in a
[02:24:26.900 --> 02:24:31.340]  moment we've also interviewed now I'm told what I think both the judges that
[02:24:31.340 --> 02:24:35.140]  were just announcing he was dead and all the rest of this and our crew is on its
[02:24:35.140 --> 02:24:41.700]  way to the ranch as we speak two different crews five people total right
[02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:46.660]  now they're on the ground in southwest Texas Madsen's by himself will be
[02:24:46.660 --> 02:24:50.100]  linking up with the team tomorrow that's why he joins us via telephone but look
[02:24:50.100 --> 02:24:55.020]  at this article out of the New York Post detectives question lack of autopsy
[02:24:55.020 --> 02:25:00.300]  in Scalia's death Bill Richie a retired deputy chief and former head of criminal
[02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:05.020]  investigations for the DC police said he was dumbstruck when he learned that no
[02:25:05.020 --> 02:25:09.260]  autopsy would be performed oh then we've got another head detective and then
[02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:14.140]  another head detective and we've got the New York top retired I mean I've
[02:25:14.140 --> 02:25:19.740]  already gone over all this but the point is dumbstruck see I said I'm dumbstruck
[02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:23.620]  by them instantly announcing no foul play go to sleep nothing happened an
[02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:30.820]  anonymous call said I mean that just is it insane and then I said Saturday night
[02:25:30.820 --> 02:25:35.860]  I said if they claim no autopsy real fast get ready and then the rest of the
[02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:43.900]  story started changing I mean ladies and gentlemen this is ridiculous and then
[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:50.020]  they go on to point the pillow over the head why would you tell us there was a
[02:25:50.020 --> 02:25:56.820]  pillow over there I mean this is just unbelievable joining us is Wayne Madsen
[02:25:56.820 --> 02:26:00.900]  Wayne great job getting out there so quick so I gotta take a few flights from
[02:26:00.900 --> 02:26:05.620]  where you read on the east coast to get to El Paso and our teams a few hundred
[02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:08.500]  miles away from me in this giant state you're gonna be meeting up with them
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:13.420]  soon actually out there at the ranch itself but Wayne tell us exactly what
[02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:18.500]  you've discovered since you got on the ground well I dropped by the funeral home
[02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:26.620]  where they actually took Leah's body from the ranch to Bollock Creek Ranch
[02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:34.300]  which is it's three and a half hours drive from El Paso and it's a very
[02:26:34.300 --> 02:26:42.620]  remote area but they what happens what happened with the body is the closest
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:49.300]  funeral home to the ranch Alpine funeral home in Alpine Texas which is
[02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:54.740]  probably about a 20 minute drive from the ranch sent a Cadillac curse to pick
[02:26:54.740 --> 02:26:59.180]  up the body but you know I mean what's odd is they could have there's an
[02:26:59.180 --> 02:27:04.860]  airstrip over there near the ranch they could have flown the body to El Paso
[02:27:04.860 --> 02:27:11.420]  but it's that you know they chose this sort of motorcade of a of a Cadillac
[02:27:11.420 --> 02:27:17.660]  curse and a and an accompanying white SUV that drove three and a half hours to
[02:27:17.660 --> 02:27:23.380]  get to El Paso where of course there was no autopsy performed now I just stopped
[02:27:23.380 --> 02:27:30.180]  by the funeral home where he was taken from that funeral home and I actually
[02:27:30.180 --> 02:27:37.020]  spoke to the guy who embalmed just as fully as body and well good job nobody
[02:27:37.020 --> 02:27:42.180]  else has done that that I know of good job Wayne well I mean it's even more
[02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:46.740]  interesting I on the outside chances and of course I have to practice this by
[02:27:46.740 --> 02:27:52.220]  saying that funeral home is preparing an official public release the statement
[02:27:52.220 --> 02:27:57.820]  both you know to protect the privacy honor the privacy of the family I was
[02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:05.860]  not given any detail per se but I did ask about what is the normal procedure to
[02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:09.780]  get rid of the bodily fluids after an embalming that would be you know the
[02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:17.260]  blood and other fluid strain from the body well I'm I said to my chagrin I
[02:28:17.260 --> 02:28:23.100]  discovered that the bodily fluids were basically flushed into the El Paso
[02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:29.940]  municipal fluid system so you know no special precautions taken and not they
[02:28:29.940 --> 02:28:35.780]  weren't healed for possible future analysis but I mean even even though an
[02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:41.940]  autopsy wasn't performed I understand that the blood in urine could feel some
[02:28:41.940 --> 02:28:48.260]  toxicology results well obviously that's a huge deal headline funeral home
[02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:54.100]  Scalia's bodily fluids dump down the drain basically down the drain yeah and
[02:28:54.100 --> 02:29:00.580]  and that is texas wall there's no as far as biohazards or any of that I mean
[02:29:00.580 --> 02:29:05.060]  that's another interesting fight side part of this we're about to go to break
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:08.580]  come back and tell us more of what you discovered but just briefly how big a
[02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:13.020]  deal is it the detectives all over the country senior detectives you know over
[02:29:13.020 --> 02:29:17.580]  homicide investigations are saying this is just dumb founding what's happening
[02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:23.500]  well I hope to get that mr. Richie these retired homicide detective in DC
[02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:28.260]  helped try to contact him at some point because he certainly dealt with enough
[02:29:28.260 --> 02:29:33.500]  of these high-disability deaths in the district of Columbia for a number of
[02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:37.180]  years I didn't think of that angle stay there let's talk about that straight
[02:29:37.180 --> 02:29:42.220]  ahead absolutely he's an expert he ran the division so think about that and he
[02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:45.900]  saying this this totally sinks to high heaven and he deals with all the murders
[02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:54.220]  in DC we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:29:54.220 --> 02:29:56.620]  network
[02:29:58.500 --> 02:30:03.260]  Russian warplanes are being blamed for carrying out what is being described as
[02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:07.620]  a deliberate attack on two makeshift hospitals in the school in northern Syria
[02:30:07.620 --> 02:30:11.540]  Monday that killed nearly 50 people according to the United Nations
[02:30:11.540 --> 02:30:17.500]  reports Fox News doctors without borders said that the hospital was hit four

[02:37:28.940 --> 02:37:31.460]  he's going to be linking up with our crew soon writing articles from four
[02:37:31.460 --> 02:37:37.540]  wars calm is obviously big news on the whole situation with the with the funeral
[02:37:37.540 --> 02:37:42.740]  home Wayne other points that I'm going to shift here's today at night and crew
[02:37:42.740 --> 02:37:47.860]  yeah I had one other thing I noticed about the funeral home that they took
[02:37:47.860 --> 02:37:54.060]  Scalia it has a side what they call it like if anyone's seen VIPs when they
[02:37:54.060 --> 02:37:58.580]  come into a hotel they usually erect a tent where they go through a tunnel so
[02:37:58.580 --> 02:38:03.220]  you can't really see the person leaves the car or enter the car well this
[02:38:03.220 --> 02:38:08.820]  particular funeral home which was basically recommended by an unnamed
[02:38:08.820 --> 02:38:12.780]  friend of Scalia a close friend of Scalia I don't know if it's the other
[02:38:12.780 --> 02:38:17.700]  unnamed the same unnamed friend who traveled with him from Washington to
[02:38:17.700 --> 02:38:23.700]  the ranch but so the the hearse would have pulled in there was media all over
[02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:29.060]  the area but no you would not have been able to see either the casket being
[02:38:29.060 --> 02:38:32.860]  removed from the herds and taken into the funeral home nor would you have seen
[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:39.540]  who accompanied in the hearse and the SUV Scalia's body that might have yielded
[02:38:39.540 --> 02:38:45.620]  some information of course about the identities of who was with him and who
[02:38:45.620 --> 02:38:50.340]  maybe this unnamed friend of of his was who came down from Washington now I
[02:38:50.340 --> 02:38:55.700]  think it's important to note that in the past Scalia has often traveled to Texas
[02:38:55.700 --> 02:39:00.580]  to go quail hunting and dove hunting and his hunting partner who is a very
[02:39:00.580 --> 02:39:06.700]  close neighbor lives very close to McLean Virginia's Dick Cheney now Scalia was
[02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:12.980]  not as far as I know at that ranch where Cheney shot the the old lawyer Harry
[02:39:12.980 --> 02:39:20.460]  Whittington who's still alive at the ripe old age of 88 but I understand it
[02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:24.340]  when Cheney was asked what he thought about the death of his friend Scalia his
[02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:31.820]  answer was not really what you would consider a eulogy said no comment which
[02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:39.100]  again is unusual what do you make out of all this Wayne I'm wondering right now I
[02:39:39.100 --> 02:39:43.900]  think we also have to focus on this John Pointexter not a felon from Iran
[02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:50.020]  contra different one not the retired Navy Adron but we should focus on him and
[02:39:50.020 --> 02:39:56.820]  just what was going on you know here Scalia a long three-day weekend close
[02:39:56.820 --> 02:40:01.980]  at a president's day holiday Monday but it was Valentine's a day on Sunday and
[02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:05.860]  he decides to come down for this like the boys are gonna get together and go
[02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:10.460]  quail hunting and leaves his wife up in Washington the last time I ran into
[02:40:10.460 --> 02:40:15.940]  somebody who was not with his wife on Valentine's Day was with the with the
[02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:21.580]  boys so to speak it was back in oh six Valentine's Day February oh six and it
[02:40:21.580 --> 02:40:26.740]  was Dennis Hastert who chose not to be with his wife who stayed at a hotel in
[02:40:26.740 --> 02:40:34.060]  Washington after flying into DC from from Chicago she said I'm staying staying
[02:40:34.060 --> 02:40:40.180]  alone tonight in a hotel so very very interesting now standing on this you're
[02:40:40.180 --> 02:40:44.460]  gonna be following up some other leads linking up with the team and continue to
[02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:48.060]  report over the next few days for us so we'll look for that report at info wars
[02:40:48.060 --> 02:40:52.540]  calm on the bodily fluids of the Supreme Court Justice dumped down the drain
[02:40:52.540 --> 02:40:58.340]  basically into the river there in El Paso Texas Wayne Madsen thank you so
[02:40:58.340 --> 02:41:03.620]  much for getting down there so quickly okay you bet Alex thank you and again if
[02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:07.140]  Wayne has more to add he can pop in in the next hour with do as well I know he's
[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:10.460]  got a lot of stuff developing and the same thing for Richard Reeves because
[02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:14.300]  there's so much unfolding now we go to Marfa it's a lot closer to the ranch
[02:41:14.300 --> 02:41:17.140]  and then obviously they're gonna be going towards the ranch but once you're
[02:41:17.140 --> 02:41:20.900]  there there's no internet so what happens there obviously be hard to get out
[02:41:20.900 --> 02:41:26.540]  until they get back to a town that has some basic internet but we have again a
[02:41:26.540 --> 02:41:31.220]  Skype fee for radio listeners you can go to info wars comm port slash show actually
[02:41:31.220 --> 02:41:35.060]  see David Knight David Knight is in Marfa with Joe Biggs and of course Josh
[02:41:35.060 --> 02:41:38.660]  Owens and we appreciate you guys going down there no other media is willing to
[02:41:38.660 --> 02:41:42.740]  do it I know Savage was saying he'd like to see somebody go down there so you
[02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:47.980]  guys maybe popping in with him today but you just heard what Wayne Madsen had to
[02:41:47.980 --> 02:41:51.420]  say I know that you also have gotten an interview with at least one of the judges
[02:41:51.420 --> 02:41:56.460]  so thank you so much for joining us David Knight. David Knight info wars comm we're
[02:41:56.460 --> 02:42:00.380]  here in Marfa Texas behind me the pink building that you see there is the
[02:42:00.380 --> 02:42:04.980]  county building we tried to talk to the judge there that pronounced Scalia dead
[02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:09.220]  without seeing him but earlier in the day we went down to the judge that was
[02:42:09.220 --> 02:42:14.820]  called first Juanita Bishop we talked to her and asked her why didn't you do it
[02:42:14.820 --> 02:42:18.340]  over the phone in other words you know the the obvious thing here Alex that
[02:42:18.340 --> 02:42:22.300]  everybody is talking about is she said well she made a comment I would have
[02:42:22.300 --> 02:42:26.460]  had a an autopsy done I would have looked at that but of course she also would
[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:31.300]  have gone she got the call first and she said she was too far away so she called
[02:42:31.300 --> 02:42:36.020]  another judge who is David Beebe he was also too far away so then they called
[02:42:36.020 --> 02:42:43.180]  this third judge Cinderella Guavara whose offices are behind us and she did it
[02:42:43.180 --> 02:42:46.380]  all over the phone so why wouldn't these other two not do it over the phone and
[02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:51.420]  of course the answer to that is that they would be more careful about what
[02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:55.220]  they're doing Alex we have the presumption of innocence for individuals
[02:42:55.220 --> 02:42:58.340]  you're presumed innocent until you're proven guilty of course we've lost that
[02:42:58.340 --> 02:43:02.100]  now in America we've turned everything upside down all individuals are
[02:43:02.100 --> 02:43:05.980]  suspect by our government but our government is never suspected of anything
[02:43:05.980 --> 02:43:09.180]  and that's what these people who are looking at it these retired police
[02:43:09.180 --> 02:43:14.460]  officers are saying you don't let this go you assume that it is a homicide until
[02:43:14.460 --> 02:43:18.100]  proven otherwise and that's the real issue here that's right and these these
[02:43:18.100 --> 02:43:22.820]  top police detectives around the country including DC detectives you name it who
[02:43:22.820 --> 02:43:28.180]  are over in some cases the entire squads the entire group are saying you never do
[02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:31.900]  this because we don't even have names it's a phone call at first the story
[02:43:31.900 --> 02:43:35.660]  changes there's a pillow on the head and the fact that they act like it's weird
[02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:39.500]  that we asked these questions is suspicious and the police go on to say
[02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:44.740]  and what's weirder is the media is not asking questions I mean this thing
[02:43:44.740 --> 02:43:48.580]  stinks to hi heaven David Knight well there's a lot of issues here Alex so
[02:43:48.580 --> 02:43:52.060]  we're trying to get answers to for example these calls that started going you
[02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:55.980]  know first to Juanita Bishop she got the call around one o'clock and then they
[02:43:55.980 --> 02:44:00.700]  talked to the other judges so from one o'clock until 3 a.m. the next morning
[02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:06.340]  which is 14 hours they had that amount of time by that time they knew who they
[02:44:06.340 --> 02:44:10.420]  were dealing with somebody made the decision that even though a Supreme
[02:44:10.420 --> 02:44:14.540]  Court justice died alone they were not going to do an investigation they were
[02:44:14.540 --> 02:44:17.620]  not going to do an autopsy we want to know who did that who was making that
[02:44:17.620 --> 02:44:21.500]  decision you've got four different individuals there's no investigation the
[02:44:21.500 --> 02:44:27.420]  media the local police won't do it in that area control of the Democrats and
[02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:31.460]  we've got the photos of this point extra character in Levy you know Squeezie's
[02:44:31.460 --> 02:44:36.100]  with Obama and Obama made a special award you know just for him and
[02:44:36.100 --> 02:44:41.940]  presented to him this guy's a huge donor what are you doing on here well the
[02:44:41.940 --> 02:44:45.460]  interesting thing is is a point extra the counts that we have seen that have
[02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:49.820]  been by mainstream media have said that he contacted the federal agencies said
[02:44:49.820 --> 02:44:53.500]  he had a lot of trouble getting hold of people and federal agencies because it
[02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:57.020]  was a Saturday but eventually he did get a hold of people he said the feds flew
[02:44:57.020 --> 02:45:01.500]  in with a helicopter so forth and so on and yet we're being told that the
[02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:06.380]  decisions about phoning in this death certificate and all the assumptions that
[02:45:06.380 --> 02:45:10.020]  were made about this body without ever having seen it were on the basis of a
[02:45:10.020 --> 02:45:15.380]  sheriff's deputy talking to Cinderella Guavara so we want to know what's going
[02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:19.340]  on you've got the Cinderella Guavara you've got the sheriff you've got the
[02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:23.340]  US Marshals and then of course you have the family which is also involved in
[02:45:23.340 --> 02:45:28.100]  this who made the decision that there wasn't going to be an autopsy when was
[02:45:28.100 --> 02:45:32.140]  that decision made they had 14 hours from the time that the they started
[02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:36.900]  calling the judges until it the body arrived in El Paso and that was a point
[02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:42.300]  at which the body was involved and there wasn't even a discussion ever about
[02:45:42.300 --> 02:45:46.300]  having an autopsy normally that'd be all over the news yes but they act weird if
[02:45:46.300 --> 02:45:50.660]  you even asked for that well you know the amazing thing is it's always
[02:45:50.660 --> 02:45:56.780]  suspicious when a judge at any level gets killed because judges set in a
[02:45:56.780 --> 02:46:01.700]  position where they make decisions that can destroy people's lives and so they
[02:46:01.700 --> 02:46:04.940]  make a lot of enemies in the course of their work but when you got a Supreme
[02:46:04.940 --> 02:46:09.740]  Court justice this Supreme Court justice is deciding the life and death of
[02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:14.340]  entire industries he's deciding the life and death country of global agendas
[02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:18.660]  exactly and as a matter of fact he just had a decision like that a few days and
[02:46:18.660 --> 02:46:22.700]  he said no we're not shutting down all the carbon plants no yeah we're gonna
[02:46:22.700 --> 02:46:25.620]  defend the second amendment no we're gonna control the border no we're not
[02:46:25.620 --> 02:46:29.060]  gonna let the TPP run everything and they went oh really you're dead yeah
[02:46:29.060 --> 02:46:33.220]  yeah exactly that is what is very suspicious because you've got him being
[02:46:33.220 --> 02:46:36.580]  involved in something that is not only shutting the coal industry down but that
[02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:41.900]  decision that they made to put a stay on Obama's EPA orders to take down the
[02:46:41.900 --> 02:46:46.460]  coal industry also had massive impacts on their whole climate change agenda so
[02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:50.340]  that decision wasn't just of national importance it was of international
[02:46:50.340 --> 02:46:53.300]  globalist according to the Financial Times of London have spent more than
[02:46:53.300 --> 02:46:58.460]  60 billion the last 20 years pushing the global warming carbon tax bull and he
[02:46:58.460 --> 02:47:02.460]  just shot it down and so maybe it's just a message to the rest of the court you
[02:47:02.460 --> 02:47:06.460]  do what you're told or you're gonna end up with a pillow over your head all of
[02:47:06.460 --> 02:47:10.820]  that is a factor and that is all those are reasons why we shouldn't just wave
[02:47:10.820 --> 02:47:14.900]  our hands and say move along there's nothing to see here I'm sure this is all
[02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:19.660]  innocent yeah he went to a doctor the doctor did a MRI because he was
[02:47:19.660 --> 02:47:23.580]  complaining about a shoulder pain that and the fact that he's 79 years old
[02:47:23.580 --> 02:47:27.380]  doesn't mean that it is necessarily natural causes that's what we want to
[02:47:27.380 --> 02:47:31.100]  ask them what made you think it was natural causes why would you dismiss
[02:47:31.100 --> 02:47:34.220]  I went to the doctor a few months ago for my shoulders does that mean I'm gonna
[02:47:34.220 --> 02:47:38.500]  drop dead and of course he wasn't feeling bad enough that he wouldn't make the
[02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:42.540]  trip all the way out here to this remote area to go quail honey so he obviously
[02:47:42.540 --> 02:47:48.100]  was not in that bad a condition look I don't want to just sit here and say it
[02:47:48.100 --> 02:47:51.340]  looked like they're killing but I mean the way it just instantly came out
[02:47:51.340 --> 02:47:54.940]  nothing happened go to sleep though you know and then there'll be no autopsy and
[02:47:54.940 --> 02:47:57.660]  then the story changed he had a heart attack didn't have a heart attack
[02:47:57.660 --> 02:48:01.300]  somebody called me on the phone and said it was a heart attack then it wasn't a
[02:48:01.300 --> 02:48:06.100]  heart attack I mean I mean can this judge can she like fix airplane
[02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:10.020]  equipment without a degree can she be a rocket scientist a doctor I mean we're
[02:48:10.020 --> 02:48:14.060]  gonna have her run nuclear reactors now I mean what if she's a judge she's not a
[02:48:14.060 --> 02:48:17.940]  doctor that's right and that's why there should have been a case that's why
[02:48:17.940 --> 02:48:23.300]  you've got people who are retired from the District of Columbia as well as from
[02:48:23.300 --> 02:48:27.700]  New York City who were head of criminal divisions saying this is absolutely
[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:32.340]  outrageous that a person of this stature would not have a full investigation
[02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:35.580]  you don't come in and say there's a pronouncement of innocence here I'm
[02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:40.620]  sure there's nothing going on here that is absolutely beyond naivety flag it's
[02:48:40.620 --> 02:48:44.300]  saying don't look here everything it's like a cop pulls you over and you say
[02:48:44.300 --> 02:48:48.740]  I'm not drinking or there's not marijuana in here or I promise I wasn't part of
[02:48:48.740 --> 02:48:51.540]  the bank robbery they're like get out of the car get out of the car I mean it's
[02:48:51.540 --> 02:48:55.620]  ridiculously obvious it's like you know throwing something in a trunk and
[02:48:55.620 --> 02:48:59.660]  slamming it we see the cops are running and racing away I mean it is just so
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:05.260]  suspicious the whole way I mean man and then this guy was in like secret black
[02:49:05.260 --> 02:49:10.260]  ops in Vietnam and is involved in all these big CIA connected brokerage firms
[02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:16.140]  I mean key ones key key grids and getting awards from Obama I mean who
[02:49:16.140 --> 02:49:21.020]  boy I tell you this is a this is a very elite ranch obviously that's why
[02:49:21.020 --> 02:49:25.380]  schooly and other celebrities are there 30,000 acres he has here so yeah he's
[02:49:25.380 --> 02:49:29.820]  got a lot of a lot of connections a lot of a lot of money involved there but the
[02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:33.620]  thing that we all need to look at and we all need to ask questions about how did
[02:49:33.620 --> 02:49:37.180]  this happen how could something like this happen the federal agents were
[02:49:37.180 --> 02:49:41.900]  involved long before the decision was made not to do an autopsy even if you've
[02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:45.460]  got gross and confident they were involved it's federal jurisdiction because
[02:49:45.460 --> 02:49:50.420]  he's a federal officer and my missus ridiculous that's right the federal
[02:49:50.420 --> 02:49:55.940]  agency had 14 hours before he even got to El Paso where they eventually did an
[02:49:55.940 --> 02:50:00.660]  embalming there and Obama knew within two hours of his body being found but
[02:50:00.660 --> 02:50:05.460]  but the whole country didn't know so way later I mean come on yeah it doesn't
[02:50:05.460 --> 02:50:08.580]  make any sense and so you can look at this and you can say okay there's
[02:50:08.580 --> 02:50:13.100]  there's been issues with this judge in the past shutting down but people thought
[02:50:13.100 --> 02:50:16.220]  might have been a murder investigation the same move along there's nothing here
[02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:20.980]  you could talk about local incompetence but the federal agents knew who they were
[02:50:20.980 --> 02:50:24.060]  dealing with sure they should have shut this thing down let me say something
[02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:27.100]  about that area okay I mean it is wall wall West folks you want to see what the
[02:50:27.100 --> 02:50:31.060]  West look like get down to those areas I mean it's real there's a lot of folks
[02:50:31.060 --> 02:50:34.340]  down there want to be left alone the drugs coming across the border is
[02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:38.660]  sensational and I'm gonna just take a point blank if you ask me who are the
[02:50:38.660 --> 02:50:43.900]  most corrupt judiciary in Texas I would say Southwest Texas on the border okay
[02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:47.300]  some of the best folks are out West but down down there I don't care if they're
[02:50:47.300 --> 02:50:51.900]  white Hispanic whatever it runs across the board it is it is super corrupt
[02:50:51.900 --> 02:50:56.060]  tombstone Arizona style and it's just a perfect place to have a 30,000 acre

[02:55:10.940 --> 02:55:14.420]  hour away from the ranch where they're going next and again pray for them
[02:55:14.420 --> 02:55:20.020]  folks because who knows what Hanky Panky will take place with local police in
[02:55:20.020 --> 02:55:23.900]  the situation if you leave Marfa and start getting in the other area I was
[02:55:23.900 --> 02:55:27.460]  just talking to Nico's got family down there he won't even go down there I mean
[02:55:27.460 --> 02:55:33.420]  it is it is it is creepy down there and very dangerous I mean this is one of
[02:55:33.420 --> 02:55:36.460]  those dangerous areas of the Mexico border where this ranch is on the other
[02:55:36.460 --> 02:55:43.140]  side voodoo sanería you know crazy stuff but but I'm telling you it's not
[02:55:43.140 --> 02:55:49.220]  just the the Hispanic culture down there that's particularly dangerous it's the
[02:55:49.220 --> 02:55:51.860]  white people that are around there too you don't see any black people down there
[02:55:51.860 --> 02:55:56.060]  and it is like in the middle I mean I like to go down by Big Ben because it's
[02:55:56.060 --> 02:55:59.820]  so beautiful and terralingua because it's so old-fashioned western but it's
[02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:03.380]  even a little scary and seedy but you start going over a little bit it is it
[02:56:03.380 --> 02:56:07.820]  is crazy so they are pretty close to the ranch now joining us is Kit Daniels
[02:56:07.820 --> 02:56:11.420]  and Joe Biggs is coming up the next segment Kit Daniels what are your
[02:56:11.420 --> 02:56:16.180]  observations yeah me and David Knight we talked to be just as a piece wanting to
[02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:20.540]  bishop and one of the things I asked her was do you normally perform autopsy in
[02:56:20.540 --> 02:56:24.620]  this county when someone you find a dead body and what she said I'm paraphrasing
[02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:29.340]  here they usually they usually we usually request an autopsy to protect the
[02:56:29.340 --> 02:56:32.820]  county especially if the deceased was not with the physician or under medical
[02:56:32.820 --> 02:56:36.140]  care because they don't know the cause of death for sure that's right I mean the
[02:56:36.140 --> 02:56:38.820]  doctor says we think the person died of this they may not do an autopsy but you're
[02:56:38.820 --> 02:56:41.500]  found out at your house they almost always do especially if it's a public
[02:56:41.500 --> 02:56:46.620]  figure and in my view he wasn't under the medical care because yes he had a
[02:56:46.620 --> 02:56:53.660]  doctor that's claimed told the judge Gabbara that he had been sick for the
[02:56:53.660 --> 02:56:56.540]  past couple days but yet all of a sudden he clears him to go on this hunting
[02:56:56.540 --> 02:57:01.300]  trip you know out of the well then here's the key we need to get this out the
[02:57:01.300 --> 02:57:05.460]  point that the original judge said they would normally do an autopsy in this
[02:57:05.460 --> 02:57:08.740]  case and I know you guys haven't had time to upload that yet but we do have that
[02:57:08.740 --> 02:57:13.860]  on video I got it on audio so we got a good audio on that well good job I know
[02:57:13.860 --> 02:57:16.140]  it's hard to get into the courthouse and talk to a judge so I'm impressed you
[02:57:16.140 --> 02:57:21.620]  guys got that yeah and continuing she said that they normally request an
[02:57:21.620 --> 02:57:26.500]  autopsy if they don't know the cause of death and Bishop she told me personally
[02:57:26.500 --> 02:57:32.980]  that she usually goes out to see the body because quote it's my job so she
[02:57:32.980 --> 02:57:36.540]  didn't do her job this time well she said she told us she was out of town or
[02:57:36.540 --> 02:57:40.420]  she's on a work related event or something like that so she called the
[02:57:40.420 --> 02:57:43.780]  other I believe the other justice of the piece and for some reason he couldn't
[02:57:43.780 --> 02:57:48.820]  show up either so they end up calling the county judge Gabbara and she's a
[02:57:48.820 --> 02:57:53.060]  and she ended up being the one that phoned it in but according to the Texas
[02:57:53.060 --> 02:57:59.260]  Code article 4904 deaths requiring an inquest the justice of the piece shall
[02:57:59.260 --> 02:58:02.900]  conduct an inquest into the death of a person who dies in the county served by
[02:58:02.900 --> 02:58:08.300]  the justice if it has multiple lion items one of them is the person dies in
[02:58:08.300 --> 02:58:12.740]  unnatural death from a cause other than a legal execution the body or a body
[02:58:12.740 --> 02:58:16.380]  part of a person is found the cause of circumstances of death or unknown there
[02:58:16.380 --> 02:58:22.660]  it is yeah Texas code was violated headline yeah yeah the person was it
[02:58:22.660 --> 02:58:26.980]  goes on the person even if the person was identified or unidentified you know
[02:58:26.980 --> 02:58:31.380]  the same thing applies this is big I want to get you and Beggs on camera right
[02:58:31.380 --> 02:58:34.220]  now together I want you to finish then get some comments from Beggs but I think

[03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:50.380]  gonna grow old
[03:00:52.580 --> 03:00:58.220]  the globalists hope there aren't any men left in the world they hope for a bunch
[03:00:58.220 --> 03:01:05.420]  of children they can direct around well they're gonna find out just like every
[03:01:05.420 --> 03:01:10.380]  other group of tyrants in history they're gonna burn now Kit Daniels is
[03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:13.620]  gonna be with us I want to get Joe Biggs's take and David night to take
[03:01:13.620 --> 03:01:17.580]  again in the next two segments then then do has got a big broadcast lined up with
[03:01:17.580 --> 03:01:23.900]  a ton of other news but I tell you this is just crazy absolutely crazy right now
[03:01:23.900 --> 03:01:27.380]  and I want Kit Daniels to come back after the next segment repeat what he just
[03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:30.980]  said and then have David come back and then and then and then Joe Biggs if
[03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:35.100]  fact Joe Biggs next and then David but but I gotta tell you a great job kit as
[03:01:35.100 --> 03:01:38.380]  an investigative journalist doing what nobody else does showing how they
[03:01:38.380 --> 03:01:42.980]  violated the code David showing how the feds were really in control but claim it
[03:01:42.980 --> 03:01:48.380]  was locals and all this confusion it's either the biggest lazy group of people
[03:01:48.380 --> 03:01:53.300]  across the board or foul play and then they said there's a pillow over his face
[03:01:53.300 --> 03:01:57.980]  and it's the whole thing breaks down so so give me your take on what you thought
[03:01:57.980 --> 03:02:01.060]  when you first saw it versus now that you're close to it and have talked to
[03:02:01.060 --> 03:02:05.060]  the judge and more and where you think this is going kid Daniels well Alex I
[03:02:05.060 --> 03:02:08.300]  haven't told you the bombshell yet as far as the penal code it goes further
[03:02:08.300 --> 03:02:15.980]  quote on number four if the circumstances of the debt indicate that the debt may
[03:02:15.980 --> 03:02:19.980]  have been caused by unlawful means ie you find a dead body with a pillow over
[03:02:19.980 --> 03:02:24.180]  its head then yes you according to Texas law the justice of peace shall or
[03:02:24.180 --> 03:02:31.060]  require an autopsy and if the person dies while while attended by a
[03:02:31.060 --> 03:02:33.900]  physician who's under the able to certify the cause of death or request
[03:02:33.900 --> 03:02:36.940]  the justice of the peace conducting quest it goes on further than that that's
[03:02:36.940 --> 03:02:41.220]  right that's right it's got to be the doctor on call at the hospital with the
[03:02:41.220 --> 03:02:46.820]  charts who will certify it because I've seen family died it was in a hospital for
[03:02:46.820 --> 03:02:49.860]  a month and they know why and they don't have to do an autopsy and they ask the
[03:02:49.860 --> 03:02:53.060]  family and they say yeah we don't want one they say good I certified as well
[03:02:53.060 --> 03:02:57.380]  but you don't have the Supreme Court justice the key one dead with a bunch
[03:02:57.380 --> 03:03:01.420]  of conflicting stories and then they don't at least investigate an autopsy
[03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:07.260]  I'm sorry this is crazy they did not want an autopsy brother yeah I mean go back
[03:03:07.260 --> 03:03:10.700]  to your question before about what my views is now compared to the when the
[03:03:10.700 --> 03:03:15.380]  story broke I mean this is at very bare minimum this is gross negligence and
[03:03:15.380 --> 03:03:19.820]  incompetence by these local officials I mean you have a county judge it's all
[03:03:19.820 --> 03:03:24.580]  the sudden now a medical doctor apparently you know causing a buy over
[03:03:24.580 --> 03:03:29.140]  the phone I guess telepathically that she can decide how this person died that
[03:03:29.140 --> 03:03:33.740]  she had ease to I don't even think she knew where the body was or anything she
[03:03:33.740 --> 03:03:36.620]  might have this one of the questions we wanted to ask her but of course she
[03:03:36.620 --> 03:03:41.260]  doesn't take questions right now you've got top deputies you've got top heads of
[03:03:41.260 --> 03:03:47.660]  homicide quote quote saying I almost fell out of my chair another one says I was
[03:03:47.660 --> 03:03:51.740]  dumbfounded another one says I was completely shocked I mean how obvious
[03:03:51.740 --> 03:03:58.340]  does this have to get I fell out of my chair too yeah it's I mean if this would
[03:03:58.340 --> 03:04:03.740]  like I said on the show the other day if if he was targeted for assassination
[03:04:03.740 --> 03:04:06.980]  this would be the county to do it in this would be the exact circumstance that
[03:04:06.980 --> 03:04:11.300]  they would need to pull out but no it's not only a successful assassination but
[03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:16.700]  a successful cover-up well I'd rather die than submit to this scum I've had
[03:04:16.700 --> 03:04:21.300]  enough of their crap what about you kid yeah me too well I want to reset because
[03:04:21.300 --> 03:04:25.580]  I was hyperventilating I want to come back Rob do give you the floor and I
[03:04:25.580 --> 03:04:30.020]  want you to go back over that penal code again for folks talk about it what the
[03:04:30.020 --> 03:04:33.780]  judges said I want to hand the baton to Joe bags and then back for a comment with
[03:04:33.780 --> 03:04:38.700]  night with Rob do quarterbacking this thing straight ahead I'm gonna punch out
[03:04:38.700 --> 03:04:42.740]  and take care of business operations defending us from enemy operations
[03:04:42.740 --> 03:04:46.380]  literally I'm gonna deal with that as usual believe me they don't just leave us
[03:04:46.380 --> 03:04:49.740]  alone here while we're doing this so stay with us it's all coming up and
[03:04:49.740 --> 03:04:54.620]  support us spread the word by the products and pray for us but spread the
[03:04:54.620 --> 03:05:01.380]  word folks you are the key you are the resistance we have previously seen 3d
[03:05:01.380 --> 03:05:05.700]  printing technology bring us things like simple household items more advanced
[03:05:05.700 --> 03:05:09.900]  components of firearms and now it's being reported that they can even produce
[03:05:09.900 --> 03:05:15.140]  body parts a team at Wake Forest University has used a combination of
[03:05:15.140 --> 03:05:19.900]  living cells and a special gel to print out human body parts including ears
[03:05:19.900 --> 03:05:25.740]  muscles and jaw bones reports NBC News it's an advance on previous attempts
[03:05:25.740 --> 03:05:29.580]  which either involved making a plastic scaffold and then trying to get cells to
[03:05:29.580 --> 03:05:33.740]  grow in and on it or that printed out organ shapes that ended up being too
[03:05:33.740 --> 03:05:38.820]  floppy and dying the new approach mixes live cells with a gel that starts out as
[03:05:38.820 --> 03:05:42.900]  liquid but quickly hardens to the consistency of living tissue the
[03:05:42.900 --> 03:05:47.300]  challenge of making living tissue is complicated even a simple structure like
[03:05:47.300 --> 03:05:51.900]  an ear as several types of cells and they must all be fed by tiny capillaries
[03:05:51.900 --> 03:05:58.220]  you can find more reports on info wars.com
[03:05:59.220 --> 03:06:04.620]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would
[03:06:04.620 --> 03:06:09.100]  hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize
[03:06:09.100 --> 03:06:15.300]  and prepare a defense sixty years ago when foreign air forces were approaching
[03:06:15.300 --> 03:06:20.260]  filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the
[03:06:20.260 --> 03:06:24.100]  21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[03:06:24.100 --> 03:06:28.860]  pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy
[03:06:28.860 --> 03:06:33.980]  our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death I
[03:06:33.980 --> 03:06:39.620]  personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with

[03:10:15.020 --> 03:10:20.220]  swirl will lie and repose at Supreme Court death boost legal chances for
[03:10:20.220 --> 03:10:26.540]  Obama's climate scheme also there's some abortion cases that he was actively
[03:10:26.540 --> 03:10:31.060]  working on and that were upcoming which are now going to be it looks like a
[03:10:31.060 --> 03:10:36.980]  4-4 tie in Supreme Court Scalia was usually the fifth man who would who was
[03:10:36.980 --> 03:10:40.660]  a conservative so without further ado let's go back to get Daniels in Martha
[03:10:40.660 --> 03:10:44.100]  Texas kit read off that penal code again for those who are just tuning in
[03:10:44.100 --> 03:10:49.460]  so to what law the judge was looks like officially breaking at this point yes
[03:10:49.460 --> 03:10:56.100]  is that Texas a code article 49.04 deaths requiring an inquest a just a
[03:10:56.100 --> 03:10:59.940]  justice of the peace shall conduct an inquest into the death of a person who
[03:10:59.940 --> 03:11:04.180]  dies in the county served by the justice if goes through line items one of which
[03:11:04.180 --> 03:11:09.020]  is the body or a body part of a person has found the cause of circumstances of
[03:11:09.020 --> 03:11:13.580]  death or unknown regardless of whether the person was identified or not
[03:11:13.580 --> 03:11:18.340]  identified the circumstances of the death indicated that the death may have
[03:11:18.340 --> 03:11:22.180]  been caused by unlawful means you know like I told Alex before the break you
[03:11:22.180 --> 03:11:25.740]  know if you find a dead body with a pillow over its head I would suggest that
[03:11:25.740 --> 03:11:32.100]  yes that's probably a likely aim on the natural death to put it mildly the
[03:11:32.100 --> 03:11:36.460]  person dies without having attended by a physician as far as I know Scalia he
[03:11:36.460 --> 03:11:40.580]  did not have a physician present with him at the ranch and the person dies
[03:11:40.580 --> 03:11:43.820]  while tinned by a physician who's unable to survive blah blah blah I don't think
[03:11:43.820 --> 03:11:49.580]  that really applies in this case but there's at least say one two three line
[03:11:49.580 --> 03:11:54.700]  items in this code that I think would call for the justice of the peace to
[03:11:54.700 --> 03:11:58.460]  require autopsy especially for Supreme Court justice that served our nation for
[03:11:58.460 --> 03:12:05.860]  over 30 years yeah exactly and so she made the call not to do an autopsy and
[03:12:05.860 --> 03:12:10.740]  then who made the call do we know who made the call to immediately bomb the
[03:12:10.740 --> 03:12:14.820]  justice the one we talked to in the morning was Juanita Bishop she was the
[03:12:14.820 --> 03:12:17.980]  justice of the peace precinct to she was the one I think she wrote the article
[03:12:17.980 --> 03:12:21.540]  saying that I would have called an autopsy if it was me so we went to her
[03:12:21.540 --> 03:12:25.460]  office and we're like well why didn't you what what happened and apparently she
[03:12:25.460 --> 03:12:28.420]  said she was out of town on some work related event or something like that you
[03:12:28.420 --> 03:12:31.820]  know who knows it's president's day everybody's got the week a long weekend
[03:12:31.820 --> 03:12:36.700]  right so those who sponge off the government so she called the I believe
[03:12:36.700 --> 03:12:39.540]  she called the second justice of the peace and for some reason he also
[03:12:39.540 --> 03:12:43.740]  couldn't show up to it so they called the county judge and the county judge
[03:12:43.740 --> 03:12:48.740]  does even bother with the inquest code apparently and she just calls it in
[03:12:48.740 --> 03:12:52.180]  saying hey this is a dead body you know it died of natural causes about ever
[03:12:52.180 --> 03:12:57.140]  haven't seen the body and to me it's really weird because the ranch you know
[03:12:57.140 --> 03:13:01.900]  you had Mick Mick Jagger Julia Roberts all these celebrities that visited this
[03:13:01.900 --> 03:13:07.420]  ranch so it wasn't like an illegal alien that was found dead in a pasture that
[03:13:07.420 --> 03:13:12.660]  was mangled up you know he wasn't much left this was somebody who was like
[03:13:12.660 --> 03:13:17.180]  more than likely of predominance because he was at the ranch that is
[03:13:17.180 --> 03:13:21.780]  frequented by celebrities and it's a well-known fact here in Marfa yeah and
[03:13:21.780 --> 03:13:25.660]  I'm I'm showing right now on the overhead cam Obama poindexter picks fuel
[03:13:25.660 --> 03:13:29.580]  Scalia's suspicions this is out of world net daily we have it posted at info
[03:13:29.580 --> 03:13:33.340]  wars.com a couple of photographs of President Obama shaking hands with a
[03:13:33.340 --> 03:13:36.580]  wealthy Democrat party donor named John poindexter who also owns the ranch
[03:13:36.580 --> 03:13:41.660]  resort where he found Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia dead also with a
[03:13:41.660 --> 03:13:45.380]  pillow over his head they don't they don't mention that but Michael Savitch's
[03:13:45.380 --> 03:13:50.980]  gave wings with the blunt broadcast question was he murdered as Savitch
[03:13:50.980 --> 03:13:56.140]  would say and so there you go that this guy is obviously got ties to Obama right
[03:13:56.140 --> 03:14:02.060]  here a Democratic donor he was getting I think he was getting awards from Obama
[03:14:02.060 --> 03:14:07.540]  for a Vietnam military service and it really really suspicious I guess you
[03:14:07.540 --> 03:14:10.260]  guys are gonna be looking to get an interview with John poindexter and I
[03:14:10.260 --> 03:14:13.820]  tell you if he doesn't agree to an interview and on-camera interview then
[03:14:13.820 --> 03:14:17.180]  there's something really fishy because if they have nothing to hide then they
[03:14:17.180 --> 03:14:20.260]  should just be all out in the open and it should be easy hey whatever questions
[03:14:20.260 --> 03:14:24.140]  you want to ask we'll answer them don't you agree absolutely and I mean at the
[03:14:24.140 --> 03:14:28.300]  very least we know we do know right now the county officials are acting very
[03:14:28.300 --> 03:14:31.580]  unusual about this whole case and they're going out of their norms not to
[03:14:31.580 --> 03:14:35.020]  call for an autopsy I mean it's just like what Bishop told me it's like they
[03:14:35.020 --> 03:14:39.420]  normally call it autopsy to cover the counties but so it's but in the case of
[03:14:39.420 --> 03:14:43.280]  us a Supreme Court Justice we just don't do it you know we have a report John
[03:14:43.280 --> 03:14:46.860]  bounds digging it up tonight Darren McBreen reminded me of this that they
[03:14:46.860 --> 03:14:51.020]  were talking about furious and every time they find a dead illegal alien on
[03:14:51.020 --> 03:14:55.700]  that they do an autopsy it's just yeah it's just normal yeah I remember I me I
[03:14:55.700 --> 03:14:59.100]  worked on a with bound on that I think I did the article he did the video when
[03:14:59.100 --> 03:15:01.900]  he went down the interview to that judge in power furious I told McBreen
[03:15:01.900 --> 03:15:06.220]  about that is I remember that the judge the county was going bankrupt because
[03:15:06.220 --> 03:15:09.700]  they were having to all these autopsies around the county for all these
[03:15:09.700 --> 03:15:13.540]  illegals they were founding and pastors that were dead so you're telling me that
[03:15:13.540 --> 03:15:17.660]  you can call for an autopsy at taxpayers expense for an illegal alien but you
[03:15:17.660 --> 03:15:22.140]  can't call for an autopsy on a Supreme Court Justice just as a precaution you
[03:15:22.140 --> 03:15:24.980]  know and who knows what he was found I had some conversations with Wayne
[03:15:24.980 --> 03:15:28.940]  Matts and about what what he was speculating but he's doing some more
[03:15:28.940 --> 03:15:33.380]  digging into this point extra fellow and you know but he said there's some big
[03:15:33.380 --> 03:15:37.260]  parties out there big-time parties Tommy Lee Jones Mick Jagger you name it
[03:15:37.260 --> 03:15:41.460]  people are out there having a good time and yeah you know rock stars know how to
[03:15:41.460 --> 03:15:45.820]  party I'll tell you that rock stars and actors definitely know how to party yeah
[03:15:45.820 --> 03:15:50.740]  at the very least that would be a huge red flag for any justice of a P of the
[03:15:50.740 --> 03:15:56.140]  piece to call in an autopsy when you have you know potential drug overdose or
[03:15:56.140 --> 03:15:59.100]  what have you you know just like you said all these celebrities party all
[03:15:59.100 --> 03:16:03.500]  hard yeah I totally agree hey let's get Joe Biggs on right now and actually at
[03:16:03.500 --> 03:16:06.660]  the bottom of the arm also gonna have John Rappaport on he's written articles
[03:16:06.660 --> 03:16:11.540]  too talking about how just mysterious this death is and it's not a conspiracy
[03:16:11.540 --> 03:16:15.580]  theory that people are saying it's it's a murder if you look at the facts and
[03:16:15.580 --> 03:16:19.980]  that's you know anytime we look at the facts anytime we put that out there you
[03:16:19.980 --> 03:16:23.140]  immediately have the leftist liberals jump in it's hell here's just the
[03:16:23.140 --> 03:16:28.340]  conspiracy theorists there's nothing to see move along he was old he smoked he
[03:16:28.340 --> 03:16:33.100]  was overweight it was natural causes get over it and I've seen tweets or people
[03:16:33.100 --> 03:16:35.500]  are saying the only thing that would have made this better would have been a
[03:16:35.500 --> 03:16:40.740]  Clarence Thomas Anton Scalia murder suicide so really vile vicious stuff
[03:16:40.740 --> 03:16:47.740]  going on out there I don't wish death on anyone at this point but we definitely
[03:16:47.740 --> 03:16:51.660]  have to look at this I mean just blanket no investigation nothing to see pillow
[03:16:51.660 --> 03:16:55.860]  on top of the face Joe Biggs what is your take on the event so far well what's
[03:16:55.860 --> 03:16:58.820]  interesting is the fact that both justice of the piece that should have been
[03:16:58.820 --> 03:17:02.660]  there to answer that call like it said we're not available that day for some
[03:17:02.660 --> 03:17:05.660]  reason when they heard the name they could not take the time out of their
[03:17:05.660 --> 03:17:10.060]  day from 120 miles away to come out here now we do know that feds flew in via
[03:17:10.060 --> 03:17:13.780]  helicopter to the ranch you mean to tell me these federal agents could not have
[03:17:13.780 --> 03:17:17.740]  flown picked one of these people up brought them in to do this properly no
[03:17:17.740 --> 03:17:22.940]  instead what happened was this was passed on to county judge Cinderella
[03:17:22.940 --> 03:17:28.500]  Guerrera who is known to already in the past have some botched cases back in
[03:17:28.500 --> 03:17:34.140]  2013 and Big Ben this county judge there was a case where a train ran over a
[03:17:34.140 --> 03:17:39.540]  woman who was souped over and the train hit her sliced her into pieces the train
[03:17:39.540 --> 03:17:42.660]  company came out they did their own investigation figured that they said
[03:17:42.660 --> 03:17:45.340]  that there should be an investigation the family came out said there should be
[03:17:45.340 --> 03:17:50.740]  an investigation and this judge behind us here said over the phone again nah so
[03:17:50.740 --> 03:17:55.020]  this was leads us to believe if this is the kind of person who was known to make
[03:17:55.020 --> 03:17:59.740]  that kind of decision was it purposely handed off to her to deal with this it's
[03:17:59.740 --> 03:18:05.060]  something shady going on was he murdered was this not just natural causes so this
[03:18:05.060 --> 03:18:08.900]  is what we're trying to find out here in Marfa and at the ranch over the next
[03:18:08.900 --> 03:18:12.260]  couple days to find out what's going on with this chain of custody this is a
[03:18:12.260 --> 03:18:15.140]  case that people should have dropped what they were doing and headed out here
[03:18:15.140 --> 03:18:19.820]  immediately and made every effort to find out what was going on a man of the
[03:18:19.820 --> 03:18:25.180]  stature should not just be rushed away unless there's something to hide exactly
[03:18:25.180 --> 03:18:28.340]  and they drove him three and a half hours up to El Paso at someone's
[03:18:28.340 --> 03:18:32.620]  request Wayne Madsen was there talk to the exactly they drove they drove the
[03:18:32.620 --> 03:18:36.220]  body three hours they had what I had to have gone through Fort Stockton where
[03:18:36.220 --> 03:18:40.540]  Juanita Bishop was they could have stopped by let her do her job and do it
[03:18:40.540 --> 03:18:44.180]  the right way and call it instead they went past the town where she was they
[03:18:44.180 --> 03:18:49.220]  go into El Paso and they go to another place yeah this is got shady written all
[03:18:49.220 --> 03:18:53.860]  over people in America should be pissed off and one of your friends was
[03:18:53.860 --> 03:18:58.300]  Shadily murdered as well I mean I'll say he was murdered I don't believe his his
[03:18:58.300 --> 03:19:02.900]  well remember they came out car hit the tree and ejected the motor and I'm
[03:19:02.900 --> 03:19:05.820]  talking about Michael Hastings for those of you who don't remember yeah they came
[03:19:05.820 --> 03:19:08.460]  out very quickly and said all you know that you know this guy's got a drug
[03:19:08.460 --> 03:19:12.700]  problem you know it's normal for a car to drive down the road and speed and blow
[03:19:12.700 --> 03:19:16.540]  up and then blow up again and then swerve to the left and the engine fly
[03:19:16.540 --> 03:19:21.100]  out and go in the path of travel that he was driving originally ejection
[03:19:21.100 --> 03:19:24.060]  motors we don't have ejection since anymore we have ejection motors he was
[03:19:24.060 --> 03:19:29.340]  driving a Mercedes or a BMW right yeah a Mercedes yeah so when something like
[03:19:29.340 --> 03:19:33.340]  this happens it is reasonable for us to question now think about this if we had
[03:19:33.340 --> 03:19:37.900]  a Republican president we had a ranch owned by someone who was a Republican
[03:19:37.900 --> 03:19:43.780]  donor and a liberal judge died the whole left would be up in arms screaming
[03:19:43.780 --> 03:19:47.500]  crying asking for an investigation George Bush was in office and this was Ruth
[03:19:47.500 --> 03:19:51.100]  Bader Ginsburg it would have been oh my god he did it he did it he did it we got
[03:19:51.100 --> 03:19:54.740]  to have an investigation but when we call for an investigation no nothing we'll

[03:24:08.020 --> 03:24:13.540]  we are live in the fourth hour this is Rob do hosting the Alex Jones show and I
[03:24:13.540 --> 03:24:17.260]  got a tweet from Will Morgan who said I'm thinking a solid angle on Scalia's
[03:24:17.260 --> 03:24:20.900]  death is pinning down who at the Justice Department or I would just say the feds
[03:24:20.900 --> 03:24:24.940]  in general ordered the deviation from investigative SOP which stands for
[03:24:24.940 --> 03:24:29.380]  standard operating procedure so that is a big question I think should be asked
[03:24:29.380 --> 03:24:34.300]  who at the Justice Department or who at the federal marshals made the call that
[03:24:34.300 --> 03:24:38.420]  we're not going to do any investigation everybody stand down everybody turn away
[03:24:38.420 --> 03:24:42.260]  let's remove the pillow off his head pretend it wasn't there and let's
[03:24:42.260 --> 03:24:46.900]  whisk the body away three and a half hours to El Paso to be involved so we
[03:24:46.900 --> 03:24:51.380]  have David Knight on the line now with his final thoughts in this short segment
[03:24:51.380 --> 03:24:55.180]  and then coming back coming after the break we're gonna have John Rappaport
[03:24:55.180 --> 03:24:59.300]  here talking about Scalia's death and also Zika everybody said the Zika virus
[03:24:59.300 --> 03:25:03.740]  was caused for microcephaly where the babies have really small heads they're
[03:25:03.740 --> 03:25:06.780]  saying that was caused for the birth defect well now it turns out that they're
[03:25:06.780 --> 03:25:10.580]  saying oh wait it was pesticide use we had John Rappaport back here in January
[03:25:10.580 --> 03:25:14.780]  saying it was pesticides okay we have people on this show who know what they're
[03:25:14.780 --> 03:25:17.340]  talking about they don't just guess they don't just speculate they don't read
[03:25:17.340 --> 03:25:20.900]  off talking point memos from the White House so let's go to David Knight now
[03:25:20.900 --> 03:25:25.580]  with his thoughts on what he's seen so far David David Knight info wars.com
[03:25:25.580 --> 03:25:29.740]  we're here in Marfa Texas and of course the big pink palace behind us is where
[03:25:29.740 --> 03:25:34.660]  Cinderella is Cinderella Guevara this she's the judge who did everything over
[03:25:34.660 --> 03:25:37.860]  the phone and of course earlier today we went to the other judge who first got
[03:25:37.860 --> 03:25:41.940]  the call because it was in her area she said well I can't go that's the operative
[03:25:41.940 --> 03:25:47.420]  word here go so she calls somebody else David Bebe who said I can't go and so
[03:25:47.420 --> 03:25:50.740]  then they call this judge who doesn't even bother to go she just does
[03:25:50.740 --> 03:25:54.580]  everything over the phone so what we're trying to find out here Rob here in this
[03:25:54.580 --> 03:25:59.460]  area and of course the sheriff who was also in contact with him what we're
[03:25:59.460 --> 03:26:03.060]  trying to find out is who made these decisions how were the US Marshals
[03:26:03.060 --> 03:26:07.260]  involved we're told by point extra that they got involved they flew in with a
[03:26:07.260 --> 03:26:12.140]  helicopter and there were 14 hours that lapsed from the time they started
[03:26:12.140 --> 03:26:15.940]  calling judges until the time the body was delivered to El Paso and then
[03:26:15.940 --> 03:26:20.820]  sometime after that they did the embalming which essentially destroyed
[03:26:20.820 --> 03:26:25.460]  potential evidence so they can't do a complete autopsy at this point so that's
[03:26:25.460 --> 03:26:28.300]  what we're concerned about who made that decision as you were saying just as
[03:26:28.300 --> 03:26:31.980]  we're coming to break that is the crucial point who made this decision this is
[03:26:31.980 --> 03:26:36.460]  one of the most powerful men in the world he was arguably the person who was
[03:26:36.460 --> 03:26:41.220]  the biggest obstacle in front of not only Obama but in front of the globalist
[03:26:41.220 --> 03:26:45.140]  agenda to control our economy members it's open borders where we destroy the
[03:26:45.140 --> 03:26:49.780]  national borders it's also the aspect we have managed economies managed by an
[03:26:49.780 --> 03:26:54.100]  international commission as part of the Trans Pacific transatlantic partnerships
[03:26:54.100 --> 03:26:57.860]  as they call them the treaties and then the other part of that is to set up a
[03:26:57.860 --> 03:27:04.100]  global taxation regime and that is was affected directly by what the Supreme
[03:27:04.100 --> 03:27:09.180]  Court decided with a 5 to 4 majority he's not only just a fifth vote he was
[03:27:09.180 --> 03:27:13.220]  really kind of the intellectual center of the opposition as well he was like
[03:27:13.220 --> 03:27:16.620]  one of the cement blocks I saw when I was in Switzerland they kept the tanks
[03:27:16.620 --> 03:27:19.900]  from rolling down the street essentially yeah just right in their way wasn't
[03:27:19.900 --> 03:27:24.260]  gonna move and you can't move these guys until they die that's why you're gonna
[03:27:24.260 --> 03:27:29.220]  get rid of them so whenever you got a judge as I said before with Alex
[03:27:29.220 --> 03:27:33.980]  whenever you got a judge who dies it's always suspicious because there are
[03:27:33.980 --> 03:27:37.100]  always things that are coming up of great importance before them there's
[03:27:37.100 --> 03:27:40.780]  also decisions that they have decided of great importance that that affect or
[03:27:40.780 --> 03:27:45.140]  destroy people's lives so yes you should have a an investigation should treat it
[03:27:45.140 --> 03:27:49.540]  like a homicide until proven otherwise you don't don't just say well this guy
[03:27:49.540 --> 03:27:54.140]  was 79 he had some chronic ailments he had seen a doctor before he left but it
[03:27:54.140 --> 03:27:58.140]  was for his shoulder pain and he came down here to go hunting and being 79
[03:27:58.140 --> 03:28:01.460]  years old doesn't mean that somebody can't kill you I mean at what point do
[03:28:01.460 --> 03:28:05.780]  we stop at what age do we stop investigating potential homicides for
[03:28:05.780 --> 03:28:09.860]  people is it 79 is it 75 is it 70 years old and we just write people off and
[03:28:09.860 --> 03:28:13.100]  say hey you fell over dead so let's just forget about it I mean if Bernie Sanders
[03:28:13.100 --> 03:28:17.500]  who's gonna be 75 by the time he takes office if he just dies suddenly somewhere
[03:28:17.500 --> 03:28:23.780]  no investigation doesn't see anything exactly him immediately so what we're
[03:28:23.780 --> 03:28:27.140]  seeing here Rob it is the same sort of thing we're seeing with Hillary Clinton
[03:28:27.140 --> 03:28:31.380]  the hypocrisy and just look the other way especially if it's a very important
[03:28:31.380 --> 03:28:34.580]  person look the other way don't do any investigation I mean we have this
[03:28:34.580 --> 03:28:37.380]  national security state where they're constantly sending people to jail
[03:28:37.380 --> 03:28:41.580]  accusing them of security violations and yet when you've got one of the highest
[03:28:41.580 --> 03:28:46.340]  ranking people operating with contempt for the national security regulations
[03:28:46.340 --> 03:28:49.740]  without her own private server that she's created which is to look the other
[03:28:49.740 --> 03:28:52.740]  way the same thing now happens with this death of the Supreme Court just as it
[03:28:52.740 --> 03:28:56.740]  doesn't make any sense yeah and one of the cases he was looking at with with
[03:28:56.740 --> 03:29:00.260]  the rest of the justices was they have a law in Texas where you have to have
[03:29:00.260 --> 03:29:03.460]  certain standards before you can perform abortions and this was closing down a
[03:29:03.460 --> 03:29:06.620]  lot of clinics so this was obviously getting pushed back from the left and
[03:29:06.620 --> 03:29:10.500]  they were in the midst of that case and another one was the Affordable Care Act
[03:29:10.500 --> 03:29:14.420]  mandate on covering birth control for female employees so those are well now
[03:29:14.420 --> 03:29:18.020]  the one the one that you're talking about with abortion actually his death is
[03:29:18.020 --> 03:29:21.620]  not going to affect that case because what will happen is a lower court
[03:29:21.620 --> 03:29:27.420]  decision will stand if they get tied in a 4-4 major deadlock there so if that
[03:29:27.420 --> 03:29:30.660]  were to happen which is what most people expect is going to happen there would be
[03:29:30.660 --> 03:29:35.020]  a no effect on that however because when they had they when they have a tie a
[03:29:35.020 --> 03:29:39.140]  4-4 tie decisions that were made it a little bit over about to go to break
[03:29:39.140 --> 03:29:41.940]  we'll be right back after this the David Knife Henderson then with John
[03:29:41.940 --> 03:29:58.300]  Rappaport we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[03:29:58.300 --> 03:30:03.220]  Russian warplanes are being blamed for carrying out what is being described as
[03:30:03.220 --> 03:30:07.580]  a deliberate attack on two makeshift hospitals and a school in northern Syria
[03:30:07.580 --> 03:30:12.300]  Monday that killed nearly 50 people according to the United Nations reports
[03:30:12.300 --> 03:30:18.020]  Fox News doctors with our borders said that the hospital was hit four times in
[03:30:18.020 --> 03:30:23.020]  at least two attacks that were minutes apart a third air raid hit a school in a
[03:30:23.020 --> 03:30:27.660]  nearby village killing seven and wounding others the Russian Prime Minister
[03:30:27.660 --> 03:30:32.260]  issued a blanket denial over the weekend that Moscow was targeting civilians
[03:30:32.260 --> 03:30:37.260]  and civilian facilities in Syria reports the Guardian US military Colonel Steve
[03:30:37.260 --> 03:30:41.740]  Warren on Twitter said the destruction of the doctors without border hospital was
[03:30:41.740 --> 03:30:46.660]  quote terrible news but last year the US itself hit a doctors without borders
[03:30:46.660 --> 03:30:51.300]  facility in Afghanistan killing 30 people it was chalked up to a quote human

[03:34:18.500 --> 03:34:23.580]  influenced by by politics by threats from from anybody did you view that as a
[03:34:23.580 --> 03:34:29.780]  threat I didn't view it as that I'm not even sure I heard it well you heard it I
[03:34:29.780 --> 03:34:34.940]  please you brought it to my attention and now you come on there it is what can
[03:34:34.940 --> 03:34:38.700]  you do to me we got lifetime appointment well we could kill you you know

[03:34:45.980 --> 03:34:49.420]  finish up what you were saying and then I got to get to John Rappaport real
[03:34:49.420 --> 03:34:53.500]  quickly Robert I was gonna say is this case that they put a stay on it's going
[03:34:53.500 --> 03:34:58.620]  to come before a very liberal district court appeals court and DC in June now
[03:34:58.620 --> 03:35:03.940]  if they decide in favor of Obama's EPA shutdown of the coal industry it's not
[03:35:03.940 --> 03:35:06.740]  clear to me what happens at that point will the Supreme Court will be delayed
[03:35:06.740 --> 03:35:10.700]  will they wait until there's a ninth judge who will appoint that judge so
[03:35:10.700 --> 03:35:14.820]  this is all back in play again that very important decision but real quickly I
[03:35:14.820 --> 03:35:18.540]  just want to say one other thing while we've been here we've had more than
[03:35:18.540 --> 03:35:23.220]  once locals come up and talk to us and say this isn't the first time something
[03:35:23.220 --> 03:35:26.380]  really strange has happened here and of course that case that Joe Biggs was
[03:35:26.380 --> 03:35:32.020]  talking about 2013 a newlywed who was on the train tracks unconscious as the
[03:35:32.020 --> 03:35:36.020]  train investigator said it looked as if she had been placed on the train tracks
[03:35:36.020 --> 03:35:41.420]  was unconscious Cinderella Guevara at the time said no it's a suicide they
[03:35:41.420 --> 03:35:45.220]  cremated her body before they did any kind of autopsy before the family really
[03:35:45.220 --> 03:35:49.980]  even knew about it and they had the basis of it being a suicide was that she
[03:35:49.980 --> 03:35:53.940]  had recently resigned from her job she'd just recently been married they
[03:35:53.940 --> 03:35:57.820]  didn't do a rape kit they didn't do any kind of blood test and her personal
[03:35:57.820 --> 03:36:00.820]  effects are quite some distance from the railroad tracks so there's a lot of
[03:36:00.820 --> 03:36:05.540]  things there that indicated that this particular judge would just kind of do a
[03:36:05.540 --> 03:36:10.380]  hand waving and let things go along and that we've seen that in the past year as
[03:36:10.380 --> 03:36:13.780]  well justice via telephone well you guys are going to be on the case can't
[03:36:13.780 --> 03:36:17.740]  wait to see your reports get to that ranch and talk to that owner if he
[03:36:17.740 --> 03:36:20.220]  doesn't want to talk to you there's something really suspicious about that
[03:36:20.220 --> 03:36:23.540]  and find out who else was there who else was at the ranch I know they're not
[03:36:23.540 --> 03:36:26.540]  going to want to say it he's got an unknown friend who may or may not have
[03:36:26.540 --> 03:36:30.660]  been there who mentioned go take him to El Paso who knows there's a lot of
[03:36:30.660 --> 03:36:33.860]  questions to be answered and nobody else is doing the investigation so that's
[03:36:33.860 --> 03:36:37.500]  what we have our m4s.com reporters on the ground there thank you very much
[03:36:37.500 --> 03:36:41.940]  David Knight now my next guest from no more fake news.com is John Ramp report
[03:36:41.940 --> 03:36:45.180]  has been a freelance investigative reporter for over 30 years author of
[03:36:45.180 --> 03:36:49.940]  many books and he really came out on the forefront when we had him on at the end
[03:36:49.940 --> 03:36:53.180]  of January talking about the Zika virus he said you know what I think this is
[03:36:53.180 --> 03:36:56.860]  going to be pesticide related or related to the vaccine I don't think there's
[03:36:56.860 --> 03:36:59.900]  anything to do with the Zika virus but this is what we always see and I got a
[03:36:59.900 --> 03:37:04.220]  clip we may come to later but John you've definitely been vindicated on this
[03:37:04.220 --> 03:37:08.300]  and you've also come out and talked about Scalia you had a article yesterday
[03:37:08.300 --> 03:37:11.780]  what do you want to go with first well let's take Scalia because that's what
[03:37:11.780 --> 03:37:18.740]  we're talking about it's hot I tell you this is hot Melanie Parker 2013 dead on
[03:37:18.740 --> 03:37:23.900]  the railroad tracks I just posted an article about that the same you know
[03:37:23.900 --> 03:37:30.820]  Tin Horn judge Rivera did in fact rule that it was a suicide based on nothing
[03:37:30.820 --> 03:37:38.980]  based on really no coroners reported all much less an autopsy no autopsy done
[03:37:38.980 --> 03:37:45.580]  case closed no problem same thing here with Scalia so you know people are
[03:37:45.580 --> 03:37:51.100]  asking well is the Texas governor going to order an investigation what are you
[03:37:51.100 --> 03:37:57.300]  talking about what about the federal government you know are you saying that
[03:37:57.300 --> 03:38:02.660]  this is not a federal case if a US Supreme Court justice dies under strange
[03:38:02.660 --> 03:38:07.180]  circumstances we're hearing nothing about an FBI investigation being opened
[03:38:07.180 --> 03:38:12.580]  nothing from the Attorney General nothing from politicians in Washington who
[03:38:12.580 --> 03:38:17.540]  should be screaming their heads off that a Supreme Court justice of the United
[03:38:17.540 --> 03:38:24.940]  States dies and no autopsy is done and a ruling is made off the cuff like that
[03:38:24.940 --> 03:38:31.300]  from a judge who's shown to be completely incompetent a total goofball at
[03:38:31.300 --> 03:38:36.300]  the best and there is nothing going on in Washington except though we're very
[03:38:36.300 --> 03:38:42.260]  sad to say that Supreme Court justice you know passed away no task force did
[03:38:42.260 --> 03:38:48.100]  Cheney his buddy said no comment nothing just like yeah no comment yeah it's as
[03:38:48.100 --> 03:38:53.020]  if they're saying well look we know the public is completely asleep yeah they've
[03:38:53.020 --> 03:38:58.100]  been hypnotized successfully so there's not going to be any outcry on that level
[03:38:58.100 --> 03:39:03.980]  so why should we care you know so in case in fact we did kill him there's just
[03:39:03.980 --> 03:39:07.580]  not going to be any push for an investigation that's completely absurd
[03:39:07.580 --> 03:39:12.500]  I mean I assume that there's a whole lot of people out there in the United
[03:39:12.500 --> 03:39:18.020]  States by now who don't even know what the US Supreme Court is and they've
[03:39:18.020 --> 03:39:23.660]  never heard of Scalia and so they're just totally asleep at the wheel but you
[03:39:23.660 --> 03:39:29.420]  know the US Supreme Court in case anybody's in the dark about this is the
[03:39:29.420 --> 03:39:35.740]  highest judicial authority in the land and so the unexplained death of a
[03:39:35.740 --> 03:39:43.420]  Supreme Court justice would be on the same level as the death of a president
[03:39:43.420 --> 03:39:51.020]  or vice president or speaker of the house or anything of that level at least
[03:39:51.020 --> 03:39:58.100]  at least and yet nothing absolutely nothing I mean reporters and mainstream
[03:39:58.100 --> 03:40:04.580]  reporters don't find it curious that the FBI is not opening investigation into
[03:40:04.580 --> 03:40:09.420]  this death that they're saying nothing that nothing is happening at all I mean
[03:40:09.420 --> 03:40:13.460]  who are these frigging people anyway exactly and then you have in your in
[03:40:13.460 --> 03:40:16.500]  your article that you wrote was Justice Scalia murdered forget conspiracy
[03:40:16.500 --> 03:40:20.460]  theory this is real you have a quote from William O. Ritchie former head of
[03:40:20.460 --> 03:40:23.980]  criminal investigation for DC police you have a Supreme Court justice who died
[03:40:23.980 --> 03:40:27.100]  not in attendance of a physician you have a non-home-assigned trained US
[03:40:27.100 --> 03:40:30.300]  marshal to the justice of the piece that no foul play was deserved you have the
[03:40:30.300 --> 03:40:33.340]  justice of Pernese pronounced the death while not being on the scene without any
[03:40:33.340 --> 03:40:37.660]  medical training appending that he died of a heart attack what medical proof
[03:40:37.660 --> 03:40:42.660]  exists there is none and now it's all been flushed down the drain by the
[03:40:42.660 --> 03:40:46.940]  embalmer and now the last of that right by the embalmer and now the last thing
[03:40:46.940 --> 03:40:51.660]  that we're hearing is well yes he did have a heart condition so therefore we
[03:40:51.660 --> 03:40:56.940]  can just automatically assume without any medical examination whatsoever that a
[03:40:56.940 --> 03:41:01.860]  US Supreme Court justice died of a heart attack in his sleep and the pillow was
[03:41:01.860 --> 03:41:05.980]  just on his face and that's the end of that story and we don't need to worry
[03:41:05.980 --> 03:41:10.900]  about who else was at the ranch or the fact that point Dexter was a you know
[03:41:10.900 --> 03:41:15.460]  contributor to the Democratic Party or a Democratic supporter or that he received
[03:41:15.460 --> 03:41:21.260]  an award from Obama I mean nothing of this could possibly be relevant so we
[03:41:21.260 --> 03:41:25.780]  can just excuse all of that and then we'll have a funeral and his body will
[03:41:25.780 --> 03:41:30.420]  lie in state in Washington for a few days or a week we don't care about the
[03:41:30.420 --> 03:41:34.780]  family we don't care that the family is completely silent that they have nothing
[03:41:34.780 --> 03:41:39.060]  to say or at least as far as we know they have nothing to say because nothing
[03:41:39.060 --> 03:41:45.620]  is being reported I mean the scandal here is just enormous regardless of the
[03:41:45.620 --> 03:41:50.700]  factor whether or not he was in fact murdered the fact that there is no
[03:41:50.700 --> 03:41:55.260]  federal investigation that has been opened into this I mean that's called a
[03:41:55.260 --> 03:42:00.500]  clue folks that is a clue it's called a cover-up that's I'll say it it's a
[03:42:00.500 --> 03:42:05.580]  cover-up they're covered something up it's just
[03:42:05.580 --> 03:42:13.060]  unconscionable unbelievable that this is going on and of course the docile press
[03:42:13.060 --> 03:42:18.500]  just follows in line tragic death statements from people well we didn't
[03:42:18.500 --> 03:42:23.020]  agree with his policy but you know he's an extraordinary man years of service
[03:42:23.020 --> 03:42:27.360]  blah blah blah etc etc and then we've of course got people on the left who
[03:42:27.360 --> 03:42:31.860]  probably say well we shouldn't investigate Scalia because you know it's
[03:42:31.860 --> 03:42:36.060]  better that he's dead so let's just leave it at that that's their version of you
[03:42:36.060 --> 03:42:42.260]  know logic and constitutionality so it doesn't matter what side he was on what
[03:42:42.260 --> 03:42:49.220]  judgments he made etc etc the fact is the position he held the position he
[03:42:49.220 --> 03:42:55.580]  held how many other people in the federal government in important positions
[03:42:55.580 --> 03:43:03.740]  could die in unknown circumstances without any sort of FBI investigation I
[03:43:03.740 --> 03:43:08.460]  mean you would be having investigations all over the place if a senator
[03:43:08.460 --> 03:43:16.380]  suddenly died in circumstances like that I mean the degree of mind control here is
[03:43:16.380 --> 03:43:21.000]  absolutely extraordinary yeah and it kind of reminds me of Breitbart
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:25.740]  Breitbart's walking down the road all sudden falls down grabbing his chest they
[03:43:25.740 --> 03:43:30.180]  go immediately hard-tech 43 years old and dies just like that right after he
[03:43:30.180 --> 03:43:33.780]  says he's got some big video coming out that's gonna submarine Obama and then
[03:43:33.780 --> 03:43:37.420]  suddenly the video that came out didn't seem that that big so it makes you
[03:43:37.420 --> 03:43:42.060]  wonder if they really put out the video that Breitbart was gonna put out yeah
[03:43:42.060 --> 03:43:47.060]  there's many other cases like this but none involving the US Supreme Court
[03:43:47.060 --> 03:43:50.820]  Justice exactly yeah I mean this is unprecedented you know yeah it's
[03:43:50.820 --> 03:43:54.780]  completely unprecedented and so when Michael Savage said you know we need a
[03:43:54.780 --> 03:43:57.620]  warrant commission for this and a lot of people would say what are you talking
[03:43:57.620 --> 03:44:02.660]  about no he's absolutely right that's the level on which this death occurred
[03:44:02.660 --> 03:44:10.060]  that's the level on which it occurred and so it just shows that people have
[03:44:10.060 --> 03:44:16.240]  fallen into such a state of total ignorance about you know branches of
[03:44:16.240 --> 03:44:21.340]  government what it means what the Constitution says forget whether or not
[03:44:21.340 --> 03:44:25.540]  the Supreme Court actually has been reflecting the Constitution they're
[03:44:25.540 --> 03:44:31.820]  supposed to so you may as well say well since we don't care that Scalia died
[03:44:31.820 --> 03:44:38.140]  under unknown circumstances with very strange you know surroundings and that
[03:44:38.140 --> 03:44:42.620]  there was no autopsy since we don't care about that let's just eliminate the
[03:44:42.620 --> 03:44:46.420]  entire Supreme Court since we pay so little attention to this guy's death
[03:44:46.420 --> 03:44:51.160]  and let's just transfer everything over to the executive branch because it's a
[03:44:51.160 --> 03:44:55.540]  lot faster it's a lot simpler and I'm sure that if you know some of these
[03:44:55.540 --> 03:44:59.340]  folks went out there with surveys and started talking to people on the street
[03:44:59.340 --> 03:45:03.860]  you would get at least 60 70% people agreeing yeah we we don't need this
[03:45:03.860 --> 03:45:06.980]  thing we don't even know what the Supreme Court is let's just let the
[03:45:06.980 --> 03:45:10.860]  president decide all these things mark dice I hope you heard that get out there
[03:45:10.860 --> 03:45:15.740]  and talk to the zombies you kind of live in that area too with these these
[03:45:15.740 --> 03:45:20.060]  zombified people who don't believe in anything but what they see on TV and
[03:45:20.060 --> 03:45:25.020]  you know changing subjects real quick because we got limited time got about
[03:45:25.020 --> 03:45:28.260]  15 minutes till the end of the show I want to get into Zika because you came
[03:45:28.260 --> 03:45:32.500]  out immediately and said it looks like either pesticide or probable adverse
[03:45:32.500 --> 03:45:36.940]  reactions to vaccinations because they were now I forget which one it was but
[03:45:36.940 --> 03:45:44.460]  I think it was the the TD AP TD AP that's right the TDAP and now I did a
[03:45:44.460 --> 03:45:51.160]  report yesterday on a tech crunch article are yeah Larva side manufactured by
[03:45:51.160 --> 03:45:56.100]  cemento not Zika virus true cause of Brazil's microcephaly outbreak say
[03:45:56.100 --> 03:46:00.740]  doctors this is a group of Argentinian doctors that was looking at this Larva
[03:46:00.740 --> 03:46:07.380]  side which the see if I can pronounce this right pyro proxy fan pyroproxy
[03:46:07.380 --> 03:46:12.820]  fan exactly I've been rehearsing that for a long time yeah pyroproxy fan is it
[03:46:12.820 --> 03:46:16.380]  turns out they were dumping that in the drinking water in this state in Brazil
[03:46:16.380 --> 03:46:22.060]  and then 12 months later eight months later nine months later these women are
[03:46:22.060 --> 03:46:25.500]  having microcephaly outbreaks while they're drinking pesticide you're not
[03:46:25.500 --> 03:46:29.500]  supposed to pour it in the drinking water than anything I mean this just see
[03:46:29.500 --> 03:46:32.860]  and this looks like a big cover-up because they come out and say it's Zika
[03:46:32.860 --> 03:46:37.500]  it's Zika Zika we get this big push to you know have guerrilla warfare and
[03:46:37.500 --> 03:46:43.100]  states of emergencies in in Hawaii over Zika virus we're gonna fight Zika it
[03:46:43.100 --> 03:46:47.100]  seems like the same thing they were doing with Ebola just these fake medical
[03:46:47.100 --> 03:46:50.060]  emergencies when it's well they're actually just dumping pesticides in the
[03:46:50.060 --> 03:46:57.540]  water supply Ebola swine flu bird flu SARS West Nile go all the way back it's
[03:46:57.540 --> 03:47:02.140]  the same story I've been covering these epidemics for a long time now and here's
[03:47:02.140 --> 03:47:06.620]  the thing that people don't realize first of all it's not just pyroxy
[03:47:06.620 --> 03:47:14.340]  pyroproxy I will begin pyro pyroproxy fan yeah it's not just that it's the
[03:47:14.340 --> 03:47:17.900]  fact that you've got all kinds of other pesticides in Brazil because they're the
[03:47:17.900 --> 03:47:22.300]  biggest users of pesticides in the world and they're using pesticides that are
[03:47:22.300 --> 03:47:27.500]  banned in 22 other countries because they're too toxic so those corporate
[03:47:27.500 --> 03:47:32.140]  predators that use and sell and make those vaccines make those pesticides
[03:47:32.140 --> 03:47:37.020]  they have to be protected you see oh we need a cover story because we're talking
[03:47:37.020 --> 03:47:40.980]  about ongoing death and destruction in Brazil from pesticides and we're
[03:47:40.980 --> 03:47:46.100]  talking about areas of the country where people intentionally are maintained in
[03:47:46.100 --> 03:47:52.220]  a state of poverty severe malnutrition lack of basic sanitation overcrowding
[03:47:52.220 --> 03:47:58.700]  etc etc failed vaccine campaigns that are toxic and so on and so on this is the
[03:47:58.700 --> 03:48:04.660]  steady state condition of these people some of whom work on these massive
[03:48:04.660 --> 03:48:09.980]  corporate agri-plantations and so on and around these pesticides all the time so
[03:48:09.980 --> 03:48:16.460]  let's choose this virus called Zika which was discovered 1947 never shown to be
[03:48:16.460 --> 03:48:22.180]  toxic whatsoever mild transient illness goes away in a few days etc etc
[03:48:22.180 --> 03:48:27.940]  and we'll blame it on this virus and then now we have the Brazilian researchers
[03:48:27.940 --> 03:48:32.500]  coming back with a second look at all of this saying guess what we can only
[03:48:32.500 --> 03:48:41.260]  confirm any trace of this virus Zika in 17 cases of microcephaly in the whole
[03:48:41.260 --> 03:48:46.900]  country of Brazil okay so folks that's called the clue as well that's the clue
[03:48:46.900 --> 03:48:52.700]  that Zika is not the cause of anything but the World Health Organization you see
[03:48:52.700 --> 03:48:57.820]  can make tremendous hay out of that because they know that this virus
[03:48:57.820 --> 03:49:02.580]  probably been on the planet for what a hundred thousand years been around and
[03:49:02.580 --> 03:49:07.300]  around the planet over and over again causes nothing they can now say well we
[03:49:07.300 --> 03:49:11.780]  found a case in Texas we found three in Alaska we found two in Indonesia we found
[03:49:11.780 --> 03:49:16.100]  some in France oh my goodness and one in New York well sure it's been there
[03:49:16.100 --> 03:49:21.300]  forever it's like HPV everybody has got HPV or not got you know everybody gets
[03:49:21.300 --> 03:49:25.900]  in there like well this would be where wherever you look yeah I used them the
[03:49:25.900 --> 03:49:30.500]  analogy of Volkswagen's you know researchers have discovered that people
[03:49:30.500 --> 03:49:34.820]  are driving Volkswagen's in Brazil so let's start looking for Volkswagen
[03:49:34.820 --> 03:49:38.780]  somewhere else what we found them in Germany and France they're spreading to
[03:49:38.780 --> 03:49:44.020]  the United States no they've been there all along but now the World Health
[03:49:44.020 --> 03:49:49.980]  Organization can use Zika as the infecting spreading virus that's causing
[03:49:49.980 --> 03:49:55.900]  microcephaly when in fact it's clear and any doctor worth his salt who knows
[03:49:55.900 --> 03:50:03.300]  the literature will tell you any insult to the fetal brain during pregnancy can
[03:50:03.300 --> 03:50:08.260]  cause microcephaly woman is punched in the stomach woman falls downstairs

[03:54:30.740 --> 03:54:34.660]  second but first I want to tell you about brain force it's how we make
[03:54:34.660 --> 03:54:38.140]  everything possible is people going to info store.com and getting the products
[03:54:38.140 --> 03:54:41.260]  becoming members of personplanet.tv it's how we got our reporters out in West
[03:54:41.260 --> 03:54:45.740]  Texas right now brain force is one of the products we sell and we have an ad
[03:54:45.740 --> 03:54:50.460]  going around right now talking about how when I was cutting the Lewis Farrakhan
[03:54:50.460 --> 03:54:54.820]  the two-hour version of the interview Josh Owens did the 50-minute boil down
[03:54:54.820 --> 03:54:58.940]  version and I was cutting the whole interview together and I hadn't had much
[03:54:58.940 --> 03:55:02.220]  time in the week to work on it because when you're sitting down editing it
[03:55:02.220 --> 03:55:05.780]  just it takes a lot of concentration and you can't it's hard when you get
[03:55:05.780 --> 03:55:09.020]  bothered so I was coming in at night working on it and we were going to put
[03:55:09.020 --> 03:55:13.140]  this out on Wednesday Tuesday night I get in to the office about 8 30 and I'm
[03:55:13.140 --> 03:55:18.380]  feeling run down to brain force I was going strong to about 4 a.m. that started
[03:55:18.380 --> 03:55:22.580]  getting a little tired finished up at 6 30 went home slept for three hours woke
[03:55:22.580 --> 03:55:27.260]  up the next morning took two more brain force came to the office felt great the
[03:55:27.260 --> 03:55:32.540]  rest of the day I mean this product really does work of all the ones that
[03:55:32.540 --> 03:55:39.660]  I've taken here at info wars.com just being here brain force definitely is the
[03:55:39.660 --> 03:55:42.740]  one that you will feel immediately when you take it especially you get up in
[03:55:42.740 --> 03:55:48.260]  the morning try it just get one bottle go out party in a hard day or whatever
[03:55:48.260 --> 03:55:52.180]  you do stay up late get up in the morning early and take couple these your
[03:55:52.180 --> 03:55:57.100]  brain will instantly for me it does is and instantly clears the fog the fog of
[03:55:57.100 --> 03:56:00.620]  of what I say life the fog of life getting in the way now going back to John
[03:56:00.620 --> 03:56:04.300]  Rappaport finish up on Zika and tell people where they could get more
[03:56:04.300 --> 03:56:07.700]  information on your news that you write because you're coming out with great
[03:56:07.700 --> 03:56:12.060]  articles all the time yes I think I've written probably a dozen articles about
[03:56:12.060 --> 03:56:20.740]  Zika and no more fake news.com is where they can get that material so to sum up
[03:56:20.740 --> 03:56:25.820]  what I was getting to before we took the break there are many different factors
[03:56:25.820 --> 03:56:30.380]  here that are suppressing the immune systems and destroying the lives of
[03:56:30.380 --> 03:56:35.340]  people in places like Brazil like northeastern Brazil and we should
[03:56:35.340 --> 03:56:40.420]  definitely mention the Tdap vaccine tetanus diphtheria pertussis because it
[03:56:40.420 --> 03:56:45.700]  has aluminum compounds in it that are neurotoxic they cross the blood brain
[03:56:45.700 --> 03:56:51.740]  barrier in 2014 in Brazil health authority recommended suddenly that
[03:56:51.740 --> 03:56:57.620]  vaccine for pregnant women in Brazil that's a major factor here we're not
[03:56:57.620 --> 03:57:02.940]  looking to find you know the one thing that has to be the only one thing there
[03:57:02.940 --> 03:57:06.780]  are a lot of things as we described for example the pesticides that are
[03:57:06.780 --> 03:57:13.220]  operating there and all of this needs to be covered up by the people who are in
[03:57:13.220 --> 03:57:18.380]  charge and we're talking about Brazil we're not talking about the United States
[03:57:18.380 --> 03:57:23.940]  there's a lot more protests a lot more boiling under the surface and out in the
[03:57:23.940 --> 03:57:28.300]  streets there there are doctors there who have blown the whistle on this
[03:57:28.300 --> 03:57:34.260]  particular Larva side not just Argentine doctors but Brazil doctors as well all
[03:57:34.260 --> 03:57:39.380]  of this goes on all the time in Brazil and so the government and their allies
[03:57:39.380 --> 03:57:45.460]  in a corporate you know huge predators they have to put the lid on this they
[03:57:45.460 --> 03:57:50.260]  always need to come up once in a while with a tall tale a horror movie that's
[03:57:50.260 --> 03:57:54.580]  going to scare people and divert their attention just like the old shell game
[03:57:54.580 --> 03:57:58.660]  and in this case it's the harmless Zika virus and the world health
[03:57:58.660 --> 03:58:04.660]  organization is the PR agency that steps in right at the beginning with their
[03:58:04.660 --> 03:58:10.700]  virus hunters and claims up we found it when they haven't found anything exactly
[03:58:10.700 --> 03:58:14.220]  they haven't found anything and they want to use that to cover up I was just
[03:58:14.220 --> 03:58:19.460]  pointing out the MSDS a pyroproxifen they say a chronic exposure includes
[03:58:19.460 --> 03:58:22.940]  changes in the liver kidney and red blood cells but it didn't produce cancer so
[03:58:22.940 --> 03:58:26.700]  it's okay and like you said it's not just that it's other things the TDAB
[03:58:26.700 --> 03:58:30.580]  vaccine by the way after you get that fourth booster shot it's only after four
[03:58:30.580 --> 03:58:34.100]  years after you get that booster it's only 9% effective and that's what
[03:58:34.100 --> 03:58:37.900]  they're saying so we'll have more stay tuned in for us icon for more reports
[03:58:37.900 --> 03:58:44.420]  I'm Rob Dew reporting
