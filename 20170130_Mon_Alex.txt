[00:00.000 --> 00:11.880]  It's Monday, the final day of January 2017 is here in front of us for only nine days
[00:11.880 --> 00:14.040]  into the new Trump administration.
[00:14.040 --> 00:18.320]  It is just historic time to be alive, but the Democratic Party and others are openly
[00:18.320 --> 00:24.320]  trying to start a civil war and lying about President Trump's travel ban.
[00:24.320 --> 00:27.840]  This is going to be another incredibly important transmission straight ahead, and we're going
[00:27.840 --> 00:31.920]  to kick it off with a report from John Bowne.
[00:31.920 --> 00:36.600]  My dream was to go to America because it's the strongest country in the world.
[00:36.600 --> 00:42.280]  We feel that it's safe, it's the safest country, it has the strongest human rights.
[00:42.280 --> 00:46.520]  But with one signature, that vision of America shattered.
[00:46.520 --> 00:52.360]  I suppose it's what has explained so much of Donald Trump's political career, the exploitation
[00:52.360 --> 00:53.960]  of fear.
[00:53.960 --> 00:59.720]  From the Bertha campaign to the talk of Mexican racism, Trump has always trafficked in fear
[00:59.720 --> 01:00.720]  mongering.
[01:00.720 --> 01:05.560]  Let the left-wing Marxist media's disinformation campaign begin.
[01:05.560 --> 01:11.400]  Prepare to be bombarded with the talking point that Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Pakistan
[01:11.400 --> 01:17.000]  were left out of the seven countries banned from entering the U.S. because of supposed
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.320]  favoritism by President Trump.
[01:19.320 --> 01:27.020]  Truth be told, President Trump is merely enforcing former President Obama's 2015 law, restricting
[01:27.020 --> 01:33.640]  visas from those seven countries of concern, already passed by Congress two years ago.
[01:33.640 --> 01:37.560]  Will the conniving globalist media set the record straight?
[01:37.560 --> 01:45.320]  Why was Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan and Egypt not included on this list if you
[01:45.320 --> 01:47.960]  are so concerned about this issue?
[01:47.960 --> 01:53.320]  We are concerned about the issue, Chuck, and that's why we put these seven countries initially
[01:53.320 --> 01:58.440]  into the executive order that were identified previously by Congress, by both the House
[01:58.440 --> 02:04.080]  and the Senate, and the Obama administration as being the seven most watched countries
[02:04.080 --> 02:05.740]  in regard to harboring terrorists.
[02:05.740 --> 02:07.460]  But you bring up a good point.
[02:07.460 --> 02:11.520]  Perhaps other countries needed to be added to an executive order going forward.
[02:11.520 --> 02:16.440]  A federal judge is putting a temporary stop to some of the most important parts of President
[02:16.440 --> 02:21.120]  Donald Trump's executive order banning citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from
[02:21.120 --> 02:22.120]  entering the U.S.
[02:22.120 --> 02:26.680]  This after a federal judge in New York grants an emergency stay halting deportations of
[02:26.680 --> 02:31.720]  people with valid visas who were caught in the confusion of the President's immigration
[02:31.720 --> 02:32.720]  order.
[02:32.720 --> 02:35.760]  Well, one of the things in the order apparently is to include green card holders.
[02:35.760 --> 02:39.200]  As far as green card holders moving forward, it doesn't affect them.
[02:39.200 --> 02:44.520]  What Donald Trump wants to do, what Homeland Security wants to do under him, is focus on
[02:44.520 --> 02:48.880]  the criminal illegal aliens and get them out of the United States.
[02:48.880 --> 02:51.960]  Who possibly could object to that?
[02:51.960 --> 02:57.600]  Another falsehood talking point is that the ban is targeting Muslims exclusively as the
[02:57.600 --> 03:01.200]  left's fear campaign continues unabated.
[03:01.200 --> 03:07.240]  There is an exception made, a potential for the exception made for anyone who is not Muslim.
[03:07.240 --> 03:10.520]  There are no exceptions allowed for someone who is Muslim.
[03:10.520 --> 03:14.720]  Moving on a second, the order also says persecuted Muslims have priority as well.
[03:14.720 --> 03:19.680]  So, I mean, that's a piece that's just getting totally, un-either whatever you want to call
[03:19.680 --> 03:22.360]  it, misreported or not fully reported.
[03:22.360 --> 03:27.120]  It doesn't just say Christians, it also says persecuted Muslims get priority as well.
[03:27.120 --> 03:29.880]  So this is not a Muslim ban, John.
[03:29.880 --> 03:34.400]  This is, all this is, is identifying the seven countries and the reason we chose those seven
[03:34.400 --> 03:40.120]  countries was those were the seven countries that both the Congress and the Obama administration
[03:40.120 --> 03:47.800]  identified as being the seven countries that were most identifiable with dangerous terrorism
[03:47.800 --> 03:49.360]  taking place in their country.
[03:49.360 --> 03:56.080]  The executive order signed by President Trump is discriminatory, discriminatory on religion
[03:56.080 --> 03:58.400]  and frankly quite disgusting.
[03:58.400 --> 04:06.520]  It's not based on religion, it's based on places where there are substantial evidence
[04:06.520 --> 04:11.000]  that people are sending terrorists into our country.
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.440]  It is the left that is setting itself up for a seditious fall into the abyss of American
[04:17.440 --> 04:18.440]  history.
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.200]  The left simply still assuming that they are in charge.
[04:22.200 --> 04:27.280]  Do you think the president should be banned from coming to the United Kingdom?
[04:27.280 --> 04:32.360]  I think a state visit when there is this sort of ban in place is wrong.
[04:32.360 --> 04:37.360]  I don't want us to run out of the red carpet for a president who has a shameful ban like
[04:37.360 --> 04:38.360]  he has.
[04:38.360 --> 04:42.360]  So he should be banned from coming to the UK?
[04:42.360 --> 04:46.920]  I don't think this should be a state visit while this ban is in place.
[04:46.920 --> 04:53.360]  But this is a brand new day and the constitution in our immigration laws will no longer be
[04:53.360 --> 04:54.360]  ignored.
[04:54.360 --> 05:01.920]  John Bound for Infowars.com.
[05:01.920 --> 05:04.200]  Boy did the travel ban get him going or what?
[05:04.200 --> 05:06.640]  Perhaps we really will see four years of Trump protests.
[05:06.640 --> 05:08.120]  But why are they really protesting?
[05:08.120 --> 05:12.760]  They never protested when Obama made similar actions in 2011 against Iraq refugees or in
[05:12.760 --> 05:17.200]  2015 when he signed the visa waiver program and terrorist travel prevention act as part
[05:17.200 --> 05:22.000]  of his 2015 Christmas gift omnibus spending bill which also created the list of countries
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.280]  that Donald Trump chose.
[05:23.280 --> 05:26.440]  So why no protests then over Obama but now over Trump?
[05:26.440 --> 05:27.760]  Coverage and transparency.
[05:27.760 --> 05:30.920]  See Trump is transparent with the moves he is making and the media is always in attack
[05:30.920 --> 05:31.920]  mode against him.
[05:31.920 --> 05:35.880]  While Obama made his moves over holidays and the media ignored them, the CNNs of the world
[05:35.880 --> 05:39.280]  over the weekend could be heard using this radical leftist double think.
[05:39.280 --> 05:43.320]  Trump's travel ban is Islamophobic and Trump's travel ban will increase the risk of Islamic
[05:43.320 --> 05:44.320]  terror.
[05:44.320 --> 05:48.240]  Yes I am sure Trump's non-fatal travel ban angered more people in that region than Obama's
[05:48.240 --> 05:49.920]  fatal drones and bombs.
[05:49.920 --> 05:52.720]  Which if we get to the bottom of that would clear a lot of this up.
[05:52.720 --> 05:55.920]  But the Trump protesters made new signs and took to the streets again.
[05:55.920 --> 05:56.920]  Why?
[05:56.920 --> 05:57.920]  Coverage and transparency.
[05:57.920 --> 06:02.240]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[06:02.240 --> 06:03.600]  This is Alex Jones.
[06:03.600 --> 06:07.960]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off the grid
[06:07.960 --> 06:12.080]  products of 2017 and seriously I really think everyone should have one of these.
[06:12.080 --> 06:15.760]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from
[06:15.760 --> 06:18.000]  Science one of our oldest sponsors.
[06:18.000 --> 06:22.440]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket but so powerful you can run some one
[06:22.440 --> 06:27.000]  ten appliances at your house like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.360]  plus you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment,
[06:31.360 --> 06:32.360]  even airplanes.
[06:32.360 --> 06:36.320]  The system provides an endless supply of off the grid electricity allowing you to create
[06:36.320 --> 06:39.720]  your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[06:39.720 --> 06:44.520]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.

[07:58.520 --> 08:23.520]  are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[08:23.520 --> 08:31.360]  So we gambled on Donald Trump didn't we or at least we thought we did two years ago and
[08:31.360 --> 08:40.120]  he came up royal flush with another handful of spades in his other fists.
[08:40.120 --> 08:48.320]  Over delivery, shocking, truthfulness, unbelievable.
[08:48.320 --> 08:52.720]  Donald Trump the real deal, the return of the republic.
[08:52.720 --> 08:58.040]  He's even now reversed himself on torture which was the only thing that he was promoting
[08:58.040 --> 09:02.720]  that I thought was wrong but he's being honest about it, the fact that our enemies use it
[09:02.720 --> 09:08.520]  against us and the fact that it does sometimes get good information, still we can't lower
[09:08.520 --> 09:14.040]  ourselves to their level but he's now come out and said he will follow what the secretary
[09:14.040 --> 09:19.800]  of defense says Mattis and Mattis is against torture so he is now against torture.
[09:19.800 --> 09:31.480]  Boom not a flip flop but a change of course from almost perfect to basically perfect.
[09:31.480 --> 09:36.880]  The enemy is going to continue to misrepresent who Trump is and who we are and what we're
[09:36.880 --> 09:43.680]  standing for and what we're doing here but it hit me like a thunderbolt this morning
[09:43.680 --> 09:52.600]  but I need to muster every bit of my focus, my will, my oratory skills to simply and succinctly
[09:52.600 --> 10:03.240]  boil it down and encapsulate it to the listeners and viewers of this transmission.
[10:03.240 --> 10:09.080]  We say it a lot but I want it to sink into your bones real good.
[10:09.080 --> 10:13.240]  This country is in a fight for its life.
[10:13.240 --> 10:18.840]  This planet is in a fight for its life against the technocrats that are a very wicked, evil
[10:18.840 --> 10:25.480]  group of mad scientist basically, you're living in a science fiction movie and Donald Trump
[10:25.480 --> 10:33.840]  is the instinctive ancestral archetype of a man not caring what the enemy thinks, not
[10:33.840 --> 10:39.840]  caring about PR, not caring about propaganda but knowing the truth and risking his life,
[10:39.840 --> 10:47.000]  his name, his treasure along with all the rest of us on the front line to try to truly
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.360]  save humanity's future from a very, very wicked group of people.
[10:52.360 --> 10:57.760]  Make no mistake, everybody, I don't care what color you are, I don't care where you
[10:57.760 --> 11:04.680]  came from, I don't care whether you're a man or a woman.
[11:04.680 --> 11:10.640]  If you're fighting the globalists, you're on the front lines in defense of this species
[11:10.640 --> 11:22.360]  against a very alien satanic evil and I want to just shoot the viewer straight right now.
[11:22.360 --> 11:28.200]  I mean every single word of what I say on this broadcast, in fact, we're facing a situation
[11:28.200 --> 11:34.480]  far worse than I can even articulate here but if we face the enemy and if we admit
[11:34.480 --> 11:42.560]  how serious the stakes are, we have the will, the history, the destiny to defeat this enemy
[11:42.560 --> 11:50.400]  and through this great trial, come out on the other side at the next level for our species.
[11:50.400 --> 11:57.160]  This is the great test we're now entering into, this is the great battle, this is the
[11:57.160 --> 12:04.080]  war and make no mistake, Donald Trump is delivering with a great group of men and women around
[12:04.080 --> 12:10.000]  him and the supporters of this broadcast and others in a true attempt to defeat the globalist
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.880]  program.
[12:11.880 --> 12:17.800]  He is delivering on every front with military precision and speed.
[12:17.800 --> 12:27.840]  He understands that he is in an incredibly epic historical moment and that is why the
[12:27.840 --> 12:32.640]  enemy is pulling out every stop they've got because they're losing and they're desperate
[12:32.640 --> 12:38.200]  and they're scared, in nine days he did more for this country and its sovereignty than
[12:38.200 --> 12:41.280]  Ronald Reagan ever did.
[12:41.280 --> 12:45.720]  It's a false statement when people say oh he's done more in a week than Obama did in
[12:45.720 --> 12:51.080]  eight years, Obama was trying to hurt the country, Obama was trying to impoverish the
[12:51.080 --> 12:56.320]  population, Obama was trying to break our will in his own public statements and in their
[12:56.320 --> 13:02.680]  own white papers and books, but not just America, the world, telling Latin Americans communism
[13:02.680 --> 13:11.800]  is good, telling Cubans that Fidel Castro was great, telling Africans they can't have
[13:11.800 --> 13:14.320]  cars or air conditioning.
[13:14.320 --> 13:22.280]  These are selfish, arrogant, monstrous, spiritually blind people that we're up against who have
[13:22.280 --> 13:26.440]  turned themselves over to an interdimensional sickness.
[13:26.440 --> 13:29.040]  This is a spiritual battle.
[13:29.040 --> 13:35.840]  President Trump knows that and has invoked the true God of the universe, the true God
[13:35.840 --> 13:46.120]  of creation, the God of life, the true all powerful in our quest to be free and our long
[13:46.120 --> 13:49.760]  march into the heavens.
[13:49.760 --> 13:57.520]  And that's why all of us have to rededicate ourselves even stronger and work harder and
[13:57.520 --> 14:01.080]  we have to be focused and we have to realize that that's our destiny and that it's not
[14:01.080 --> 14:06.040]  tiring or exhausting but that it's fulfilling.
[14:06.040 --> 14:13.320]  And that's why we have to be very serious and very focused because the stakes are so
[14:13.320 --> 14:20.800]  high and we're not being given the short reprieve just out of the blue.
[14:20.800 --> 14:25.280]  This is because of prayer and action and people being persecuted and working hard so we have
[14:25.280 --> 14:27.640]  a basic platform to fight the enemy.
[14:27.640 --> 14:33.800]  But if we squander this platform, if we squander this chance, humanity is going to go into
[14:33.800 --> 14:44.640]  long, long, long hundreds of years in my gut analysis of serious, serious hardcore dehumanization
[14:44.640 --> 14:49.760]  and enslavement that is unimaginable.
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.680]  We're already going to go through some incredible tribulations in the future.
[14:53.680 --> 15:03.560]  The AI wars, bio attacks, system breakdowns, we're already facing a lot even if we have
[15:03.560 --> 15:05.520]  good leaders.
[15:05.520 --> 15:17.440]  With evil leaders we are insured, horrific humiliation and bondage.
[15:17.440 --> 15:22.360]  So at an animal level I disdain our enemies and their minions but their minions are soul
[15:22.360 --> 15:28.080]  sucked victims and zombies who we should cry for not hate.
[15:28.080 --> 15:36.480]  The upside down world of DC and Austin, Texas and Berlin, Germany with women with their
[15:36.480 --> 15:45.360]  tops off screaming a la Akbar and calling for open borders for Islamists that will literally
[15:45.360 --> 15:47.480]  put them in slave pits.
[15:47.480 --> 15:56.400]  That is desperate, hysterical, self hate and loathing and projecting on to all of us
[15:56.400 --> 15:59.440]  that want to save them and empower them.
[15:59.440 --> 16:09.960]  They're projecting on to us their own hatred for themselves.
[16:09.960 --> 16:13.080]  And we just have to figure out ways to reach out to these people.
[16:13.080 --> 16:14.640]  That's just one example.
[16:14.640 --> 16:20.040]  And we have to remember that if you go to Iran they've got big studies out, polls upwards
[16:20.040 --> 16:23.840]  of 80% of the population doesn't want to be under the Mullahs but they are under a spiritual
[16:23.840 --> 16:28.920]  dictatorship in Saudi Arabia, the vast majority of the people don't like what they're under.
[16:28.920 --> 16:32.880]  So if you understand I didn't want these wars with the Muslims because most of them actually
[16:32.880 --> 16:34.880]  don't want to be part of it.
[16:34.880 --> 16:38.880]  I didn't want to start the whole trigger that would destabilize the Middle East and cause
[16:38.880 --> 16:40.440]  this flood into Europe.
[16:40.440 --> 16:47.920]  But now that we're at that point it is anti-war what Donald Trump is doing, trying to stem
[16:47.920 --> 16:55.000]  the tide of ISIS and al-Qaeda and trying to block those borders into historical Istanbul,
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.400]  formerly Constantinople.
[16:58.400 --> 17:02.120]  So of course Islamic State supporters react annually to Trump's temporary refugee halt
[17:02.120 --> 17:12.160]  which of course is a carbon copy of the law passed in 2013 by President Obama.
[17:12.160 --> 17:18.840]  The UN vets the refugees and certifies them with fake passports and fake visas and ships
[17:18.840 --> 17:22.840]  them in and we see weekly attacks in Europe and in North America.
[17:22.840 --> 17:27.840]  We saw another attack that killed six people and injured dozens in Canada.
[17:27.840 --> 17:33.360]  The men screaming Allah Akbar, one Islamic sect attacking the other and the headline
[17:33.360 --> 17:39.800]  was oh a terror attack on the poor Muslims.
[17:39.800 --> 17:44.040]  They were attacking because they thought that the Muslims in the mosque were heretical,
[17:44.040 --> 17:46.000]  a liberal mosque.
[17:46.000 --> 17:55.240]  They're not going to put up with that but only in this upside down 1984 world.
[17:55.240 --> 18:01.600]  Because you have ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC saying look I saw this morning right after the Muslim
[18:01.600 --> 18:09.800]  ban which isn't a ban, 87% can still come in, a mosque got hit by terror.
[18:09.800 --> 18:12.440]  What type of craziness is this?
[18:12.440 --> 18:17.320]  Canadian Prime Minister says mosque shooting a terror attack on Muslims, Reuters.
[18:17.320 --> 18:20.240]  Yes, by Islam.
[18:20.240 --> 18:26.520]  The biggest victims of Islam are those living under Islam.
[18:26.520 --> 18:30.960]  The more extreme the country, the more debt, the more carnage, there is no peace within
[18:30.960 --> 18:33.960]  the house of Islam or without the house of Islam.
[18:33.960 --> 18:38.920]  And the house of Islam is everything Islam dominates and everything outside the house
[18:38.920 --> 18:43.960]  of Islam translates to the house of war.
[18:43.960 --> 18:53.440]  Truly, in modern times, undebatably, a satanic religion that enslaves women, that pulls
[18:53.440 --> 19:01.640]  down art, that destroys open free societies and is worshipped by the twisted, manless,
[19:01.640 --> 19:06.360]  hateful women who let all these marches, the men brag, we have it on video, I walk behind
[19:06.360 --> 19:07.360]  my wife.
[19:07.360 --> 19:13.600]  Really, how about right beside them or in front of them to open the door, oh no, don't patronize
[19:13.600 --> 19:16.440]  me, that's right, make me a slave.
[19:16.440 --> 19:23.480]  These women are crazed demons, Jezebel's spirits turned over to the enemy.
[19:23.480 --> 19:28.600]  It's a wavelength, a spirit, they're crazed, they're in charge, they feel the satanic power
[19:28.600 --> 19:35.600]  of orthodox Islam behind them, the gates of hell opening to vomit out the jihad.
[19:35.600 --> 19:41.640]  And they lust to have their jaws broken and their noses broken and their genitals cut off
[19:41.640 --> 19:45.640]  and to be kept in closets and slave pens.
[19:45.640 --> 19:52.160]  They hate their father, they hate Christ, they hate the West, and so hell will be there
[19:52.160 --> 19:56.280]  abode and their homeland, but they are not with us.
[19:56.280 --> 20:01.880]  Let them go forth from here into their hell prepared for them by their father.

[23:03.520 --> 23:07.680]  The active ingredient in turmeric known as curcumin is poorly absorbed into the cells

[24:24.840 --> 24:33.360]  But what's happening with Trump is that he used cult of personality to a certain extent
[24:33.360 --> 24:40.320]  with some of the uninformed voters but he simply saw the global movement against globalism
[24:40.320 --> 24:44.160]  taking place and saw that the nation states were awakening something he'd been promoting
[24:44.160 --> 24:49.760]  for 40 years in words and in deeds and in money he spent and he rode that wave to victory
[24:49.760 --> 24:54.080]  and he seized the historic time we're in and seeks to actually create so much wealth and
[24:54.080 --> 25:01.280]  so much prosperity and so much innovation and so much equal distribution of opportunity,
[25:01.280 --> 25:04.760]  not redistribution of wealth forcibly.
[25:04.760 --> 25:07.640]  He sees that opportunity and he is taking it.
[25:07.640 --> 25:14.880]  It's in the famous play written by William Shakespeare titled William Shakespeare's Julius
[25:14.880 --> 25:23.680]  Caesar where he codified from historical writings a bit of a verbal or literary flourish
[25:23.680 --> 25:34.480]  when he said there is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to
[25:34.480 --> 25:43.240]  fortune and fortune passes before us every day so sees the day.
[25:43.240 --> 25:47.240]  I would add to that quote but what is our fortune?
[25:47.240 --> 25:52.080]  Brutus, there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to
[25:52.080 --> 26:00.320]  fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in the miseries on
[26:00.320 --> 26:06.080]  such a full sea are we now afloat.
[26:06.080 --> 26:12.200]  The magic time, the electric time, the time of destiny, the time of decision, the great
[26:12.200 --> 26:19.160]  crossroad fulcrums that run down to the ages, this the biggest, the greatest, the largest,
[26:19.160 --> 26:25.880]  the most magic, the deepest, the widest, the greatest sea of opportunity and destiny that
[26:25.880 --> 26:32.040]  our species has ever floated upon or dive deep into the mysteries.
[26:32.040 --> 26:44.680]  We cross this sea and on the other side is the promise of the republic.
[26:44.680 --> 26:51.040]  God states in the destiny of the world in our hands the enemy believed to steal it and
[26:51.040 --> 26:59.840]  to pull us down and still may succeed because in the affairs of men God gives us free will.
[26:59.840 --> 27:05.000]  Free creatures we are, the enemy tells us all day long that we don't have free will
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.120]  and we can be programmed and we can be controlled and we're just like a clock because they know
[27:11.120 --> 27:12.280]  that's not the truth.
[27:12.280 --> 27:18.160]  We can choose to be unconscious, we can choose under free will to turn over our will.
[27:18.160 --> 27:24.400]  It's called being suggestible and most people I know are unconscious.
[27:24.400 --> 27:25.400]  They are suggestible.
[27:25.400 --> 27:30.400]  They are in a trance state, a twilight between consciousness and unconsciousness.
[27:30.400 --> 27:35.800]  I seek to awaken the sleeper.
[27:35.800 --> 27:42.360]  We must break the public out of the trance and not just debate them on the false facts
[27:42.360 --> 27:48.640]  they've been fed but with the energy of the secret place of the most high that Psalms
[27:48.640 --> 27:57.000]  talks about, transcend their petty brainwashing, circumvent it and somehow unlock their minds
[27:57.000 --> 28:06.760]  to see that they are indeed in Plato's allegory of the cave.
[28:06.760 --> 28:11.080]  It's in those concepts that we're going to break the chains.
[28:11.080 --> 28:15.680]  More and more I realize that not debating them on their fake facts not not going okay
[28:15.680 --> 28:19.160]  yes the whole Pennsylvania Avenue was empty.
[28:19.160 --> 28:25.880]  No one was there even though we have all the photos and videos and I was there and it was
[28:25.880 --> 28:30.480]  totally jam packed and record view and you know everywhere and then we debate them and
[28:30.480 --> 28:35.600]  stoop down to their level when we know they're a pack of liars and we shouldn't laugh at
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.680]  someone that says ah ha Trump didn't have an audience just say oh you poor thing and
[28:40.680 --> 28:45.480]  I mean that gosh you really believe that and is that was that why you got elected or what
[28:45.480 --> 28:52.320]  are you so scared of you know I'm against the establishment and they were all against
[28:52.320 --> 28:53.320]  Trump.
[28:53.320 --> 28:59.400]  Oh yeah he put in Goldman Sachs people who have a history of fighting globalism and who
[28:59.400 --> 29:05.120]  have been on the inside and who are fighting it because they've been on the inside.
[29:05.120 --> 29:09.080]  Everybody wants to sit here like losers and believe that we have a destiny to fail and
[29:09.080 --> 29:12.840]  that we can't ever effect change or that we couldn't take over.
[29:12.840 --> 29:15.920]  That's what's happening right now.
[29:15.920 --> 29:22.400]  We're taking over the government and we've got an idea that's a trillion times more superior
[29:22.400 --> 29:23.400]  to their ideas.
[29:23.400 --> 29:29.320]  We have a culture superior to what they're pushing and we're going to crush them and
[29:29.320 --> 29:33.960]  not out of some pleasure to crush them they need to be crushed as an example and they
[29:33.960 --> 29:41.600]  will be crushed because they're not going to get out of our way so lace up your boots
[29:41.600 --> 29:45.400]  because we're going to have to run these people down and they're going to attack us and they're
[29:45.400 --> 29:51.320]  going to get physical and whoever fires first loses but when they start pulling the trigger.
[29:51.320 --> 30:01.840]  Here on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.840 --> 30:07.120]  New video on info wars dot com leftist mob chases down Trump supporters beat and taunt
[30:07.120 --> 30:11.600]  them inside of Portland international airport again the anti-Trump people are proven to
[30:11.600 --> 30:14.520]  be the most wicked and violent citizens in our country.
[30:14.520 --> 30:18.560]  I went to the women's march in DC wearing my make America great again gear and I was
[30:18.560 --> 30:23.840]  assaulted spit on yelled at cursed that had my family insulted dry humped in the street
[30:23.840 --> 30:27.880]  and overall viewed as a foul person whose opinion should be silent and when I asked
[30:27.880 --> 30:32.160]  for their opinions or why they were protesting I got nothing productive I went to the March
[30:32.160 --> 30:37.400]  for life in Austin wearing my make America great again gear and I experienced zero negativity
[30:37.400 --> 30:41.400]  for what I was wearing or my identity as a white male when I put the marchers and their
[30:41.400 --> 30:45.600]  signs on camera they spoke eloquently and had no issue sharing their opinions without
[30:45.600 --> 30:47.920]  insulting me or using foul language.
[30:47.920 --> 30:52.280]  For those that think Trump supporters are the intolerant ones I challenge you to take
[30:52.280 --> 30:56.520]  to the streets with make America great again gear on you will experience more hate than
[30:56.520 --> 31:01.520]  you ever have in your life this is Owen shroyer for info wars dot com.

[33:19.440 --> 33:27.840]  network we are in quite the paradox right now the corporate controlled globalist media
[33:29.760 --> 33:34.880]  is running around twisting and lying and spinning at levels never foreseen they've
[33:34.880 --> 33:42.240]  sunk to new lows if that's possible president trump is overperforming in my view
[33:42.240 --> 33:49.440]  him i came out friday and i came out sunday and i said trump's got a back off this torture thing
[33:49.440 --> 33:54.160]  it's the only thing messing up his perfect record came out today and said that uh he's not for torture
[33:54.160 --> 33:58.880]  now and i'm not taking the credit for that i'd give the british prime minister credit for that and
[33:58.880 --> 34:04.480]  the american people and all of his credit that's the thing he listens and he does the right thing
[34:04.480 --> 34:16.400]  and he just gets better with time this broadcast is not a donald trump butt kissing event but let

[34:28.400 --> 34:32.240]  it's because we're having a big effect and we should be very very thankful to god that this
[34:32.240 --> 34:38.080]  has even happened i want to run through literally dozens of articles right now that are super important
[34:38.080 --> 34:48.480]  first off how many days has it been he's been in office nine days nine days we're in day number nine
[34:50.800 --> 34:52.720]  if you count even that half day on that friday
[34:54.880 --> 35:01.120]  and already he's signed an executive order that for every new regulation that's created
[35:01.120 --> 35:06.880]  two have to be removed people always said there ought to be a law for every new regulation you
[35:06.880 --> 35:12.880]  got to get rid of one well see everything you always heard granddaddy say is now happening isn't it
[35:13.920 --> 35:23.600]  oh and the real estate industry they had all sorts of incentives and and and sweetheart deals
[35:23.600 --> 35:30.560]  where they would get money that that that smaller investors wouldn't get he's getting rid of that
[35:31.280 --> 35:34.000]  what's the right word because not even incentives incentives are fine
[35:35.200 --> 35:40.400]  if it's not even perks it's it's it's just deals where they get paid taxpayer money
[35:40.400 --> 35:45.280]  trump's been getting rid of that i mean it's just everything is about a level playing field
[35:45.280 --> 35:48.320]  a level playing field a level playing field
[35:48.320 --> 35:57.920]  it's amazing and then he signs the executive order trump signs executive order to slash
[35:57.920 --> 36:03.040]  regulations reuters president donald trump signed an order on monday that will seek to drastically
[36:03.040 --> 36:08.400]  pair back federal regulations by requiring agencies to cut two existing regulations for every new
[36:08.400 --> 36:18.080]  rule introduced here's the president in terms of regulation these folks are small business owners
[36:19.040 --> 36:24.640]  and the great people they've been representative of the community of the small business community
[36:25.760 --> 36:32.320]  if you have a regulation you want number one you're not going to approve it because it's already
[36:32.320 --> 36:37.920]  been approved probably in 17 different forms but if we do the only way you have a chance is we have to
[36:37.920 --> 36:44.160]  knock out two regulations for every new regulation so there's a new regulation they have to knock out
[36:44.160 --> 36:50.160]  true but it goes far beyond that we're cutting regulations massively for small business and
[36:50.160 --> 36:55.520]  for us this is but they're different but for small business and that's what this is about today
[36:56.480 --> 37:02.720]  and this will be the biggest such act that our country has ever seen there will be regulation
[37:02.720 --> 37:08.240]  there will be control but it will be a normalized control where you can open your business and
[37:08.240 --> 37:13.920]  expand your business very easily and that's what our country has been all about that's what our
[37:13.920 --> 37:20.880]  country has been all about now let's see the response of small business owners to what the
[37:20.880 --> 37:29.360]  president is now doing mere fact that he um cares about what our challenges are and what we deal
[37:29.360 --> 37:35.840]  with on a on a regular basis on a daily basis trying to grow our small businesses is really
[37:35.840 --> 37:42.240]  extraordinary he really cares about what our problems are and how to come up with some solutions
[37:43.280 --> 37:53.600]  to rectify those issues yes joy weather up anthus upstate new york ermah aguirre restaurant
[37:53.600 --> 37:58.640]  owner from las vegas nevada hit pause for a minute i think how beautiful this is it goes on and on
[37:58.640 --> 38:03.120]  the clips up on him for us dot com he just brings real small businesses the white house and puts them
[38:03.120 --> 38:08.400]  on the podium to say whatever they want it's about you it's about the people it's about devolving
[38:08.400 --> 38:14.960]  power back to the people back to the states he didn't take over tpp as some giant carrot he could
[38:14.960 --> 38:18.800]  hold over the elites and make them do what he wanted to if he wanted power or wanted money he
[38:18.800 --> 38:23.360]  could have made hundreds of billions out of that the way the laws are written the president can do it
[38:23.360 --> 38:29.760]  but no he just said nope the whole thing's crap it's gone back to congress back to the people bye
[38:29.760 --> 38:34.000]  bye tpp that big nightmare the global is trying to ram through for 10 years let's go back to the small
[38:34.000 --> 38:44.720]  business owners i'd like to add that the president has been our president for the past week and
[38:44.720 --> 38:51.040]  starting on his second week and what he's doing is a terrific job in trying to listen to all walks
[38:51.040 --> 38:58.000]  of life listening not just to large businesses but small businesses like us and really being resilient
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.880]  in the things that he wants to do to move business forward not just large businesses but also small
[39:02.880 --> 39:10.800]  businesses and that gives me a lot of hope so my name is natalia louise and i'm a chairman
[39:10.800 --> 39:18.080]  ceo of m louise construction m louise products we manufacture asphalt material recycle material
[39:18.080 --> 39:27.040]  and perform construction services for the public sector i am i am grateful today for the opportunity
[39:27.040 --> 39:33.040]  to have a candid conversation on some of the over regulation that impedes our ability to be
[39:33.040 --> 39:38.560]  efficient and as effective as we can be i think this is a huge step forward and we're looking
[39:38.560 --> 39:44.640]  forward to more to come thank you all right again these are all really important but i need to
[39:44.640 --> 39:49.600]  move on to the whole muslim man that never was that the media is basically deceiving on
[39:49.600 --> 39:53.280]  here in just a second because here he is trying to jumpstart the economy and then of course he's
[39:53.280 --> 39:58.080]  got to secure the borders you understand that out of the 180 plus countries out there the united
[39:58.080 --> 40:04.720]  states is about depending on what show do you look at the third easiest to come to and i have another
[40:04.720 --> 40:09.840]  clip in fact it's in my stack but i can't find it will you give me that clip again matt or the
[40:09.840 --> 40:16.160]  actual news article from the federal government where they admit that we get globally two-thirds
[40:16.160 --> 40:22.880]  of the refugees in the program in years past they were about to flood us with even more islamicist
[40:23.440 --> 40:30.160]  and and that the un actually runs the program and you know i knew that but to actually see the
[40:30.160 --> 40:37.840]  video clips and actually see it on the federal government's own website admitting that the
[40:37.840 --> 40:43.520]  un is who decides who can come here and then we just accept it is absolutely incredible
[40:44.800 --> 40:50.160]  and to see the latest terror attack that killed at least six people injured dozens at a mosque
[40:50.160 --> 40:54.640]  where one group of islamicists come in and kill the other islamicists rest their soul
[40:56.320 --> 41:00.640]  one group of muslims come attack the other group of muslims this is what goes on in the middle east
[41:00.640 --> 41:05.600]  but the media prays on the public's ignorance and goes there was a terror attack on the poor
[41:05.600 --> 41:13.200]  muslims see all this muslim bashing yeah by guys that are admitted as islamicists
[41:14.880 --> 41:17.440]  that's the level of upside down
[41:19.280 --> 41:24.560]  bizarro world deception we're dealing with but before i get to all of that and set the record
[41:24.560 --> 41:29.200]  straight with the facts that are incontrovertible we're ending a special that we started running
[41:29.200 --> 41:36.560]  on friday i can only run it through the end of the week because of contractual reasons

[46:54.320 --> 46:59.680]  bone and joint formula support it's all there now
[47:04.480 --> 47:08.480]  here it is u.s department of state diplomacy inaction
[47:08.480 --> 47:13.520]  and if you read here we put it on screen and highlight it for tv viewers
[47:15.440 --> 47:22.400]  they say that 70 plus percent of worldwide refugees through the un are resettled here
[47:23.040 --> 47:27.760]  the change was they've now flooded europe with muslims more than they have here but but but we
[47:27.760 --> 47:32.320]  get 70 plus percent and the united nations if you go read this page this fax page
[47:32.320 --> 47:39.520]  are the ones that vet it and set it all up go read u.s department of state refugee admissions
[47:39.520 --> 47:44.160]  and you scroll down and it says right there that the united nations is in charge of it
[47:44.160 --> 47:49.040]  and tells us what to do and who's in charge of that peter southerland who created the euro
[47:50.080 --> 47:53.520]  and who openly says we're going to get rid of the united states in europe by flooding them
[47:53.520 --> 47:59.360]  with people that aren't compatible like muslims although un hcr reports that less than one percent
[47:59.360 --> 48:04.560]  of all refugees are eventually resettled in third countries the united states welcome almost two-thirds
[48:05.920 --> 48:10.960]  remember i have a 75 of these refugees more than all other resettlement countries combined
[48:12.160 --> 48:17.200]  i saw a number of 75 but that's that's close to it the point is no teleprompter here folks so
[48:17.200 --> 48:21.760]  he just got me in an exaggeration it's usually the other way around but almost two-thirds so
[48:21.760 --> 48:27.120]  the lion's share it's like we pay for half the un and then we get lectured all day and all trump's
[48:27.120 --> 48:32.560]  doing when he says what for this new legislation to begin pulling us out of the un is negotiation
[48:32.560 --> 48:39.600]  power you're not going to have saudi arabia and cutter heading up the human rights commission
[48:39.600 --> 48:46.320]  and the human rights board again this is a joke women are the property of their husbands
[48:47.040 --> 48:54.400]  in saudi arabia and they treat them like dogs worse than dogs and so again the weirdo crazy
[48:54.400 --> 49:01.680]  feminists run around worshiping them and then likes actually a lot of liberal women i know
[49:01.680 --> 49:06.080]  actually go out and marry some his llamas this little boss around and slap him upside the head
[49:06.080 --> 49:10.000]  i guess there's are so pissed that you know uh western men won't treat him but
[49:12.160 --> 49:17.840]  so i've just personally had enough and he signed these three executive orders
[49:17.840 --> 49:28.800]  that only enforce what obama passed in 2013 obama bombed five of seven countries trumped
[49:28.800 --> 49:35.440]  banned media doesn't care that's up on info wars dot com with all the graphs and all the facts
[49:35.440 --> 49:44.160]  surprise surprise soros funded group behind effort to stop trumps border plan oh of course
[49:44.160 --> 49:51.760]  that's that's really hard to believe isn't it canadian terrorists shout a lot bar can
[49:51.760 --> 49:56.320]  we cue the feminist up when we come back jamming on a lot bar with their breast hanging out
[49:57.040 --> 50:01.280]  try that in saudi arabia sweetheart i love that the feminist always say it's not about
[50:01.280 --> 50:06.960]  an objectification and you go to one of their rallies it's like triple x man women with their
[50:06.960 --> 50:12.640]  naked hanging out screaming yelling screaming you know the name of their genitals uh and it's like

[55:53.680 --> 55:58.880]  salivate mike pearl does and talking about normalizing the overthrow of trump they got all
[55:58.880 --> 56:03.520]  these tv shows about him getting assassinated and how they're going to take over and oh boy

[56:45.200 --> 56:51.520]  hanging how they're going to do some murdering and that ties into trump joining with russia
[56:51.520 --> 56:57.200]  to start bombing hundreds of targets all over well i guess that hadn't been announced the hundreds
[56:57.200 --> 57:02.000]  of targets that have been hit but hundreds have been hit all over syria command and control bases
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  that were being run by john mccain and lindsey grandwell they went over there and met with them
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.240]  they were running them and that's why they're suddenly totally pissed and that will hobbyist

[1:00:01.920 --> 1:00:11.920]  you
[1:00:11.920 --> 1:00:31.920]  you
[1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:39.440]  it really is crazy
[1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:45.520]  to see how they take everything trump does and lie about it there was this article maybe you guys
[1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:53.120]  can pull it up i forgot to tell you from salon attacking us truly today and it says jones hates a
[1:00:53.120 --> 1:01:00.800]  police state but he loves it when trump has one and they point out that i wrote a book about the
[1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:04.880]  police state and i'm one of the leading experts on it they don't deny that and i've gotten all
[1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:10.320]  sorts of you know awards from the left about it but it wasn't because i hated the police i didn't
[1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:16.880]  want an authoritarian government in control of an oppressive police force the left thinks like
[1:01:16.880 --> 1:01:21.760]  disarmed police and stuff like that i never supported that i don't like the direction they're
[1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:25.040]  going and just revenue generation and then protecting all these other criminal classes
[1:01:25.600 --> 1:01:30.720]  trump is actually saying oh guess what drunk drivers whether they're illegal or legal in austin
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:37.040]  texas he actually uses this example shows the governor that's up on drudge too will be arrested
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:42.000]  you're not about the law anymore yeah so scroll down for tv viewers it's got my mouth inside of
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.600]  trump's mouth my head inside his mouth like they're really trying to sell the idea because they know
[1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:51.360]  trump psychology that he gets everything from me because they cannot stand his policies so they
[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:56.240]  think they can manipulate him into trump thinking that people think that he gets all his info from
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:04.800]  info wars he gets it from americana in common sense you can't go into these six countries
[1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:08.640]  those six muslim countries don't let most people in if you have an israeli passport
[1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:14.560]  in almost all those countries they arrest you on the spot if you are wearing christian paraphernalia
[1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:20.240]  they they kick you out canada almost didn't let me in famously to go cover bill berg saying i
[1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:24.240]  didn't have political speech free speech but the canadian prime minister says oh refugees all come
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:29.600]  here when i know for a fact i've seen in the news canada bars people who aren't vetted from those
[1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:39.440]  countries your folks sudan sumalia aren't even countries they are veritable hellholes in sudan
[1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:44.560]  there's a civil war going on for 20 years 20 plus years and they killed hundreds of thousands of
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:50.800]  christians the christians didn't start any of it and they've got bombers modern bombers strafing
[1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:58.640]  and bombing villages every day but oh sudana the north's got an airport let's just take people
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:09.840]  unvetted from the literal islamic hellhole do you understand that if you land in sudan at an airport
[1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:14.480]  and you don't have an islamic back last name and they come up to you and they'll tell you
[1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:18.560]  with the border checkpoint this is on record they will say quote to me this from the caran they'll
[1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:24.720]  give you a random uh verse and if you don't know what they go blah and they send you over to another
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:29.360]  area where you get interrogated and they're like we ought to be nice to these poor people
[1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:39.760]  look at what trumps do me there's a civil war in sudan and somalia and you can't just go to the
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:48.800]  airport these places barely have airports their military airports in sudan somalia doesn't even
[1:03:48.800 --> 1:03:55.120]  have them to speak of their bombed out cratered landing fields but in sudan it's military bases
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:04:01.760]  you land at a military base with hundreds of planes lined up some of world war two vintage
[1:04:01.760 --> 1:04:10.640]  that they used to bomb the unarmed defenseless christians and obama's been aiding sudan and
[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:16.000]  what they've been doing has been helping sudan invade kenya and murder christians in mass you
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:21.760]  know at their shopping malls you cannot make this up millions of christians are being killed
[1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:25.200]  every few years that you and admits it now by muslims and it's like if they it's like we don't
[1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:33.760]  exist it's like we don't exist and it's okay to do this to us no it's not and they've just got
[1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:38.800]  hundreds of aircrafts just strafing and murdering and killing just ongoing year after year decade
[1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:45.600]  after decade oh yeah let's have people with their little fake passports to show up who was saying
[1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:51.440]  and who are you i'm hobbie pockman okay let me let you ride in and a week later he gets a truck
[1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:56.320]  and runs over 100 people and the media goes one person in the crowd was muslim it was an attack
[1:04:56.320 --> 1:05:03.600]  on muslims a poor mosque got attacked last night by boy did the travel ban get him going or what
[1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:07.760]  perhaps we really will see four years of trump protests but why are they really protesting
[1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:13.360]  they never protested when obama made similar actions in 2011 against iraq refugees or in 2015
[1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:17.200]  when he signed the visa waiver program and terrorist travel prevention act as part of his
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:22.240]  2015 christmas gift omnibus spending bill which also created the list of countries that donald
[1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:27.600]  trump chose so why no protests then over obama but now over trump coverage and transparency see
[1:05:27.600 --> 1:05:31.440]  trump is transparent with the moves he is making and the media is always in attack mode against him
[1:05:31.440 --> 1:05:36.000]  while obama made his moves over holidays and the media ignored them the cnn's of the world over the
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:40.880]  weekend could be heard using this radical leftist double thing trumps travel ban is islamophobic
[1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:46.000]  and trumps travel ban will increase risk of islamic terror yes i am sure trumps non-fatal travel ban
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:50.400]  angered more people in that region than obama's fatal drones and bombs which if we get to the
[1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:54.720]  bottom of that would clear a lot of this up but the trump protesters made new signs and took to
[1:05:54.720 --> 1:06:00.160]  the streets again why coverage and transparency this is oan schreuer for info wars dot com
[1:06:01.200 --> 1:06:05.520]  ladies and gentlemen i was shown here on the road with a very important announcement

[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:19.920]  it was about four months ago that best-selling author researcher former navy seal counterterrorism
[1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:25.120]  expert matt racken said that the media has gone full soviet from the old soviet era pure lies
[1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:33.840]  now they've gone into every day from the new york times to vice which is hbo to you name it
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:40.000]  abc with plots about killing the president and coups and coups really aren't a big deal and
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:44.240]  coups aren't a problem we should have civil unrest and george soros a known globalist
[1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:50.720]  doubling the amount of money he gave in the year previous right after the election of donald trump
[1:08:50.720 --> 1:08:56.800]  and the fortune 100 lining up to give the lowest gifts for 2 million up to 50 million apiece
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:01.520]  kelogs famously gave 3 million you know pull their advertising off a bright part well good
[1:09:01.520 --> 1:09:09.840]  i don't buy kelogs this is an economic war this is a culture war and when trump enforces a law that
[1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:16.960]  obama signed in 2013 the media lies and says it's a muslim ban 87 percent can still come in these
[1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:22.160]  are countries like sudan again that only have military airports that are watching wars in the
[1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:27.600]  south killing christians how would anybody take unvetted people with their fake passports from
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:32.560]  sudan you can't go to sudan i mean you've got a good chance of being kidnapped and killed you
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:37.200]  definitely can't go to somalia i know high-level journalists that say it's basically a death wish
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:43.200]  no one gets in now no one no one you've got to have armored vehicles helicopter support to go into
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:52.480]  there oh let's just let someone fly here from somalia so again they take a normal response
[1:09:52.480 --> 1:09:56.640]  because the last three years obama ordered the borders open ordered basically no vetting the
[1:09:56.640 --> 1:10:03.680]  board patrols on ragger people have tb people have leprosy and they let them in i remember i
[1:10:03.680 --> 1:10:07.600]  was told three years ago about board patrol we're being told let leprosy and it's now in texas and
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:12.720]  florida i said no it's my dad's like that's incredible he made some calls to medical folks
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:17.280]  they go yeah how do you know that it's under homeland security we've got patients in dallas
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:22.080]  we got patients in miami we got patients uh in la with leprosy then they put them in school with
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:28.160]  kids and spread all over la kids will have leprosy for life untreatable folks you cannot make up the
[1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:33.520]  magnitude and trump goes whoa we're gonna have borders this is what globalism is pushing is
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:37.280]  the end of our borders and they freak out then there's an islamic attack killing six people
[1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:43.040]  and the prime minister comes out and says we want more refugees this was an attack on muslims by
[1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:48.400]  terrorist it was one sect attacking another sect the biggest victim of islam are muslims
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:53.200]  so here's paul watchen's report on what really happened with this and we're going to get matt
[1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:58.080]  bracken's breakdown on this but i now have no doubt they're not going to capitulate to the
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:01.920]  bill of rights the constitution the electoral process our elected president they're not going
[1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:05.040]  to give in to somebody that wants to cut their taxes and make the country great again and bring
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:09.840]  us together they're going to go into high gear now as you saw that women's march was about a million
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:15.680]  they're going to lie on every front to make the debate about their lies so we could get our agenda
[1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:20.160]  done so how do you balance exposing their lies while moving forward with our agenda you hit them
[1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:24.080]  you expose their lies you move on because they're already discredited i kept wondering why do they
[1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:29.440]  keep getting more discredited is all they can do is pick an argument to divert us as a smoke screen
[1:11:29.440 --> 1:11:35.360]  but again how do you balance that because new listeners and people don't know about the lies
[1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:39.040]  that he didn't people still say he threw martin leader king's bust in the trash camp
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:44.480]  and trump couldn't even believe they lie that bad he called it he said who did that when he was out
[1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:50.240]  at you know at an event they said sir we didn't it's right here and they went back to the actual
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:55.200]  videos of when they said it and there it was it was never taken out but see trump even got hit
[1:11:55.200 --> 1:12:01.680]  with by the lie and bought it where is the bust sure it's right here again normal people don't lie
[1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:06.960]  like this you see they lie even when it would serve them better not to because they know they
[1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:10.560]  have no credibility we'll talk to matt bracken in a moment but here's paul watson's report it's
[1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:15.840]  important it's on info wars dot com please get it out to everyone you know it's the truth about
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:22.480]  trump's muslim ban donald trump in doing what he said he would do shocker that all lies massacre
[1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:26.960]  real quite today on the muslim ban here are the top five countries with the largest muslim
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:32.800]  population you'll notice that not a single muslim from these countries is banned from entering the
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:39.280]  united states because it's not a muslim ban it's a ban based on a list of terror linked countries
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:45.840]  that was created by the obama administration oh you didn't know that you just swallowed the frothing
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:51.760]  hysteria generated by the mainstream media yet again where were the protests where was the
[1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:58.800]  outrage when obama banned all iraqi refugees from entering the us for six months back in 2011
[1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:04.400]  twice the amount of time they're banned for under this trump executive order six times obama banned
[1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:10.160]  migrants from mostly muslim countries and you were completely silent obama spent eight years
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:16.160]  dropping tens of thousands of bombs on muslim countries and you said absolutely nothing he
[1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:21.840]  armed the jihadists who were responsible for creating the civil war in syria that led to the
[1:13:21.840 --> 1:13:28.000]  refugee crisis and most of you supported that but trump stops a handful of them from entering the
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:33.120]  us and he's the dangerous racist islamophobe despite the fact that refugee admissions under
[1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:39.760]  trump over the course of 2017 around 50 000 will be in line with those admitted under previous
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:46.880]  administrations you said nothing about obama arming Saudi Arabia to slaughter yemenis yet now
[1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:53.520]  you're suddenly all concerned over yemeni refugees give me a break but chuck schumer's crying over
[1:13:53.520 --> 1:14:08.240]  muslim migrants this executive order was mean spirited and un-american mommy supported the
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:14.320]  attack on libya that led directly to the deaths of thousands of muslim migrants and how many of
[1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:21.200]  you virtue signaling celebrity twats have actually read the executive order president donald trump
[1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:27.120]  seems to have made me an alien no the executive order contains an exemption for individuals like
[1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:32.400]  you athletes or politicians for example to be allowed to enter the country again read the
[1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:39.200]  frigging text before amplifying the hysterical backlash that is based on media manipulation
[1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:45.120]  and total delusion statistics just two americans killed annually by islamic jihadist immigrants
[1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:53.120]  okay so one you've conveniently only included up until 2014 leaving out the 2015 san bernadino attack
[1:14:53.120 --> 1:15:00.080]  where 14 americans were killed by tash fin malik an islamic jihadist immigrant and here's another
[1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:06.560]  20 vetted refugees who turn to terrorism after being allowed to enter america and two the reason
[1:15:06.560 --> 1:15:12.720]  why less americans than europeans have been killed by islamic jihadist immigrants is because unlike
[1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:18.640]  europe america hasn't welcomed in millions of potential islamic jihadist immigrants president
[1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:22.880]  trump bannon refugees and immigrants from certain countries is shameful and cruel yeah you're the guy
[1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:28.240]  who shared a stage with an icis supporter nine times and said that people in the west will have to
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:33.680]  live with terrorism go screw yourself to those fleeing persecution terror and war canadians will
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:38.880]  welcome you regardless of your faith diversity is our strength unless you're a single male in which
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:43.600]  case you're not welcome how to make terrorists one ban everybody from a certain group from entering
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:49.520]  the country to wait so you're saying that muslims will become terrorists because trump offended them
[1:15:49.520 --> 1:15:54.640]  wait i thought that terrorism had nothing to do with islam yeah that sounds pretty islamophobic if
[1:15:54.640 --> 1:16:00.400]  you ask me and why would it be a good idea anyway to let in so many people who so easily resort to
[1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:07.120]  terrorism as you admitted in your tweet you are tomorrow this group of people will turn crazy
[1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:13.040]  violent if they don't get what they want so you should let them in the assassination is taking
[1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:19.520]  such a long time right so trump's the bigger because he's persecuting refugees under the
[1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:25.120]  false pretext of preventing terrorism and yet you want him to be assassinated by a terrorist there
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:28.880]  are a billion and a half muslims in the world if we were all dangerous you wouldn't be around to
[1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:34.000]  sign a muslim ban is trump supposed to be thankful to you for not assassinating him trump order
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:37.840]  begins by invoking nine eleven three times nine eleven hijackers were from egypt sardar arabia
[1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:42.800]  ua e eleven or none of those countries banned well a they're considering adding more countries to
[1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:48.320]  the list and b you're saying that trump's an unhinged dictator for banning muslims then asking
[1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:53.680]  him why he hasn't banned a hundred million more muslims many people negatively affected by this
[1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:57.600]  policy is strong supporters of the us they've done right not wrong and don't deserve to be rejected
[1:16:57.600 --> 1:17:04.240]  yeah and 21 percent of syrian refugees support isis but let's just let them all in because a few
[1:17:04.240 --> 1:17:12.320]  iraqi translators got held up at the airport but despite everything i've said i agree banning people
[1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:18.720]  from countries because of their religion is horrible right i mean who would do such a thing
[1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:24.560]  oh i don't know how about the 16 islamic countries that ban israelis because of their religion and
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:31.600]  where was the outcry when one of those countries south arabia left 300 000 air conditioned tents
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:38.160]  that could house three million refugees sitting empty this is what it comes down to the left
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:44.720]  and the mainstream media would rather see innocent americans die at the hands of islamic terrorists
[1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:51.040]  than allow trump to be successful the regressive left is a thousand times more outraged about this
[1:17:51.040 --> 1:17:57.040]  temporary travel ban created by the obama administration in the first place and they are
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:03.520]  about actual islamic terror attacks and they are about the mangled bodies of dead children on the
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:09.280]  streets be they westerners or muslims they're more outraged at this than all the muslim acid attacks
[1:18:09.280 --> 1:18:15.520]  honor killings throwing gaze off buildings stoning female rape victims to death put together and
[1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:20.400]  they're all posing again pretending to have the moral high ground because there were some protests
[1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:25.520]  protests that were bankrolled once again by george soros the guy who helped turn in jewish
[1:18:25.520 --> 1:18:31.680]  refugees to the nazis yeah there's your moral frigging high ground and that's the truth about
[1:18:31.680 --> 1:18:39.120]  the muslim ban there isn't a muslim ban that reports on info wars dot com and endless and
[1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:43.440]  his reports are getting three four five million views a piece let's make them 10 15 20 million
[1:18:43.440 --> 1:18:47.920]  views i mean this is really important understand one of his videos on average is bigger than bill
[1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:54.640]  o'reilly show that's why i keep pointing out that trump still hasn't completely gotten the
[1:18:54.640 --> 1:18:59.760]  fact that the dinosaur media is over unless he just wants to sit there and obsess over
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:04.400]  the elderly viewers at nursing homes watching fox news i just want to throw out i'm not attacking
[1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:10.480]  fox news it's just that they're attacking trump so much underhandedly that it makes me sick they go
[1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:17.280]  oh trump's lying about this and that he's a liar he's a liar about three million illegals voting
[1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:22.080]  and then the so-called republican goes no he's just mistaken let's not call him a liar when it's
[1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:27.920]  way more than three million and we've gone over all that so let's play this clip and go to our
[1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:34.320]  guest this is uh the the german feminist march a weekend and a half ago the day after the inauguration
[1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:38.480]  and we have similar things that i witnessed in videotape we're going to put a larger video together
[1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:43.440]  soon of just them handing out american flag hajibs that when we're putting on in solidarity
[1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:48.720]  with weird islamic men handing it out really getting off on it i mean this is the craziest crap
[1:19:48.720 --> 1:19:54.720]  but it's a definite alliance between the sorrows controlled left uh and the islamists and it's just
[1:19:54.720 --> 1:20:00.400]  despicable and their attack on reality is even more despicable when all trump's doing is signing
[1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:06.240]  executive orders to implement the law that obama signed in to law three years ago uh but let's go
[1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:18.160]  ahead and go to the a la aghbar they don't even let women do call the prayer in the islamic countries
[1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:25.120]  it's just a total cultural mutants let's go back to these women i'm not trying to be mean to these
[1:20:25.120 --> 1:20:29.840]  women but notice they're all the women they're in charge they all got short hair they look like men
[1:20:30.400 --> 1:20:34.800]  so they see an islam that men are in charge so you've got the butch women that are in charge
[1:20:34.800 --> 1:20:39.040]  in the little lipstick pretty girls they're down below looking at their man up on the stage and
[1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:45.040]  again i've been at i mean i've been at a pool hall slash bowling alley with one of my friends who's
[1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:49.280]  a super good-looking wife she's a beauty queen and we literally had women with cigarettes rolled up
[1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:54.960]  like james dean wearing white t-shirts walk over with duck's ass haircuts literally like they were
[1:20:54.960 --> 1:21:00.480]  in a fifties movie and try to muscle in on his woman she was laughing at them i mean it's like
[1:21:00.480 --> 1:21:05.280]  they walked up to i mean i mean this guy is my buddy and he can he can bench press 400 pounds
[1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:13.040]  like something like 30 times in a row okay okay but imagine literal like 120 pound women like
[1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:18.320]  muscling in like their james dean with little skinny arms with tattoos with with a cigarette
[1:21:18.320 --> 1:21:24.160]  pack it's like is this a freaking joke drinking beer and like mick cussing at us and making comments
[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:30.240]  it was like super entertainment these are crazy people folks and now they don't just roll cigarettes
[1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:38.240]  up another arm like their greasers from the fifties now they are going to become jihadis i mean these
[1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:42.800]  are the most leaderless idiotic people in the galaxy he'll be with us the rest of the hour matt
[1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:48.080]  bracken is our guest and again he's the best-selling author we'll tell you his website here in a moment
[1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:52.400]  but you've heard me the last 15 minutes enemiesfarneddomestic.com you've heard me here kind
[1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:58.880]  of breaking down the current insanity you cannot make this up they're so crazy i know soros is
[1:21:58.880 --> 1:22:05.520]  funding them but this is over the top and now we have every day the new york times writer today
[1:22:05.520 --> 1:22:11.120]  uh vice magazine saying what a coup looks like time to coup trump time to kill trump and the
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:15.120]  nothing's being done i think they're really organizing and still planning so you haven't been on
[1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:20.000]  since the uh since he was inaugurated your predictions have pretty much come true so far
[1:22:21.040 --> 1:22:26.000]  now that we're post uh you know trump being in nine days he's totally delivering what do you expect
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:32.640]  next from the enemy well they're they're totally the media and their fellow travelers are completely
[1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:39.280]  in the blogosphere are 100% virtue signaling for the assassination of trump that's what it's about
[1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:45.200]  that's what madonna said that's what ashley jud basically that's what they're all saying you know
[1:22:45.200 --> 1:22:50.480]  why hasn't he been assassinated yet so they're they're sending the message out you know they're
[1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:57.440]  sending the frequency out to the uh the you know emotionally unstable that they can be a hero to
[1:22:57.440 --> 1:23:02.560]  the left if they just go ahead and kill trump like we've said before like like fire answer honeybees the
[1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:08.400]  pheromones being released by by madonna blow up the white house already right and even during the
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:15.200]  campaign i mean it just as a wild example an english person of brit traveled all the way to i believe
[1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:21.360]  california tried to jump the uh uh the barricade it was not a yeah yeah he came to kill trump he
[1:23:21.360 --> 1:23:27.840]  said he was coming to killing but he was somebody who was you know you they the uh psychologists
[1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:35.280]  tend to uh separate killers into the organized and disorganized you have to be somewhat organized
[1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:40.080]  to get yourself organized all the way from the uk to a trump rally it's not like he's you know
[1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:45.920]  slobbering idiot but um imagine how many people a little bit more organized than that are ready to
[1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:53.680]  go off and with the uh you know i think that the the what i'm calling for next what i'm i call this
[1:23:53.680 --> 1:24:01.280]  the uh sbs to weather underground movement just like in 1968 i agree this is weather underground
[1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:09.600]  part two right when that when when it looked like hubert humphrey might uh come after lindon
[1:24:09.600 --> 1:24:15.120]  baines johnson this meant that the democrats would still be in charge of the federal government
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:21.440]  that's when bill ares was a leader of the students for the democratic society but when nixon came in
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:27.680]  and you know the state department and other federal agencies were revamped by republicans
[1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:32.960]  they they went paranoid they went underground they split into into cells and what happens when
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:37.600]  these guys split into these into cells and go underground because they're afraid that you know
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:43.200]  jeff sessions is going to have them all rounded up when they go underground they can become paranoid
[1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:47.360]  you know they're looking out through the blinds uh you know for by the way i mean they should be
[1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:52.720]  paranoid but right now they're really arrogant openly calling for murder in a crazed mode and we
[1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:58.720]  can see what happened when with the uh so-called and i'm using the mainstream media uh hysteria
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:06.000]  that the so-called muslim ban they can get thousands of people out to airports immediately i mean
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:10.640]  like within hours so they've got a list of over 20 million people sorrows has a database of 20
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:14.800]  millions removed on and they hit the button now and what i've noticed all these demonstrations is
[1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:20.560]  they're led by muslims muslims are leading in this country an insurrection it's incredible
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:26.160]  right now i saw in uh i forget if it was in it might have been in dallas dallas wortworth but
[1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:31.600]  they were doing the uh called a prayer you know the um lined up like magnetic filings
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:38.000]  you know towards their uh their cult object over there in mecca you know with the butts in the air
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:43.680]  right in american airports so at any point they could shut airports down i mean and that so if
[1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:49.360]  there's something bigger and which is where i'd like to i'd like to kind of talk about quebec
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:53.600]  because i think people are are not seeing you mean the attack on the on the muslims they've
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:57.680]  spun this that this is a terror attack on muslims some outlets are even saying because of trump no
[1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:02.560]  it's jihadis killing other muslims break it down right but there's another layer to this now the
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:07.920]  daily beast you can see what the frequency they're on is you know they're totally on receive mode
[1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:13.600]  the daily beast actually ran a fake news story showing you know two white guys like at a rifle
[1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:19.760]  range with their names as the shooters they had to take it down after a couple of hours so some
[1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:26.240]  fake news site puts up you know two french white got french canadian white guys with guns daily
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:31.840]  beast has got it running immediately soros could have activated had a millions of people on the
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:38.800]  street the burn down the city's begins i think that what happened in quebec was an abortive
[1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:48.480]  false in in quebec city was in a was a fubar false flag operation typically suicide jihadists
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:55.040]  don't do these kind of things like a commando um omar matine didn't wear a black mask and have a
[1:26:55.040 --> 1:27:01.120]  getaway plan uh the san bernadino killers didn't wear black masks and have a getaway plan no i get
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:05.040]  it if you're going to run a false flag against muslims you obviously have muslims do it but
[1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:09.200]  then they get caught i noticed they were in tactical gear and covered and ran they usually
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:12.800]  kill themselves when it's a real islamic attack well you're on to something big here break this
[1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:19.440]  down start over take your time to break this down yeah the some of the um initial reports
[1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:26.160]  were that they were using ak-47s yet there are only uh i believe six killed eight wounded something
[1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:32.880]  like that might be my my numbers might be changing as people die in the hospital an ak-47 loaded with
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:38.080]  30 rounds fired into a crowd of people is going to kill an injured a lot more people than that
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:45.920]  i put this down to reporters uh it reflexively calling any kind of a semi-automatic rifle an ak-47
[1:27:46.560 --> 1:27:51.200]  i'm i saw somewhere i couldn't find it again i should have been taking notes this morning
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:56.800]  it might have been actually um an sks or a pair of sks rifles they were using
[1:27:56.800 --> 1:28:02.640]  which are loaded from a stripper clip with 10 rounds a piece several of the reports that i read
[1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:09.680]  said that the the shooters had to stop and reload frequently one of the reports that i read said that
[1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:15.760]  one of the uh uh mosque congregants uh tried to you know assault the ambush counterattack
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:22.320]  during a reload and got shot for it and no matter what your religion is if you attack a shooter like
[1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:29.440]  that you are a hero in my book period um so they're planned for a mass attack like on the level of
[1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:35.840]  san bernadino or orlando might have gone off the rails due to their lack of familiarity with the
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:42.000]  weapons inability to reload correctly their reports they went in and out trying to reload
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:47.920]  finally they fled uh the the alexander bison at the blue eyed uh french canadian
[1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:55.120]  possible convert to islam i'm thinking that that uh the other the other guy uh mohammed kadir the
[1:28:55.120 --> 1:29:00.960]  moroccan he might have been planning to use this little uh kind of like do we be looking uh the
[1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:05.600]  guy with the the chess club looking dude you know it was facebook picture with the chess pieces
[1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:12.160]  he might have been planned to be the uh patsy you know the the white guy uh found at the scene
[1:29:12.160 --> 1:29:18.080]  not sure if he's you know already on the radar as a convert or not so he might have been a secret
[1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:24.720]  convert that mohammed kadir was going to use as the patsy you know the the white french canadian
[1:29:25.200 --> 1:29:29.920]  uh then they get away well it certainly fits in goes crazy we gotta go to break man right and
[1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:33.600]  we're gonna come back and talk more about this straight ahead then we're gonna look at uh more
[1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:39.840]  of this articles coming out saying kill trump we need a uh you know major event uh we've gotta
[1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:45.680]  take action you know now we need to have a coup uh what are they gonna do next because clearly
[1:29:45.680 --> 1:29:50.240]  they're arrogant look at how brennan outgoing attacked trump they're very arrogant they're

[1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:14.480]  error is to believe that as they collapse humanity they end up on top the truth is humanity is coming
[1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:30.400]  down fast but we're miles above them on our journey to hell you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:52.480]  i've got to say it to see the throngs of human trash the globalists have organized into these
[1:33:52.480 --> 1:33:59.520]  mobs of weird feminists with the men all walking behind them and they announce i walk behind my
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:04.880]  woman it's the opposite of equality and then the women take their orders from weird islamist men
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:10.320]  of the most radical wahabi is sex and i saw it on the ground in in dc when i was there
[1:34:10.320 --> 1:34:14.880]  not the saturday but last saturday nine days ago eight days ago i'm assuming a lot of facebook
[1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:18.000]  mentions and i'm like these people are walking by saying f u white male they're almost all white
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:23.840]  women they're putting on hajjibs they have hajjib signs saying solidarity uh you know with islam
[1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:28.800]  and the men are all walking behind the women very proud of it and then we caught it on video
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:37.520]  it's just it's it's so crazy and i said it's like muslims are running and then it turns out
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:43.280]  the main organizers is a woman who supports sharia law and calls that the empowerment for
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:48.800]  women and the other main organizers a guy who's tied into hamas and all this stuff and you're like
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:56.880]  really who in what alternate dimension do spoiled rotten western women bitch about the cradle of
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:05.680]  them being spoiled and then want to not join islam but like bringing in because it's anti america
[1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:11.680]  or it's anti-western i mean it is just mind blowing again if you're a radio listener you
[1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:18.800]  hear me saying all this if you go to info wars dot com you can see the live video fees we're
[1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:22.320]  actually showing you all of this and you look at the women kind of have two cast i've noticed
[1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:27.680]  you're bracket's expert on islam i just noticed it as a layperson what studies this most women are
[1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:31.200]  like total slaves there's always kind of like a house slave woman who's kind of the boss
[1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:38.880]  you'll even see them kind of commanding commanding other women around when i was there in dc i saw
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:43.760]  this lady at the airport commanding a bunch of men let's put her back on screen it's funny the
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:48.560]  daily caller talks about how she runs the whole show i saw her ordering people around and man she
[1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:54.880]  looks she looks evil it's like there's a commitment to domination and enslavement it's it's just so
[1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:59.920]  creepy it's it's like watching those that husband and wife in syria getting their little seven-year-old
[1:35:59.920 --> 1:36:05.040]  ready to blow herself up she looks so sad to make her do it i mean it's just my gut says i want to
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:15.680]  fight that lady my gut says that's an enemy right there and it's just so twisted it's so twisted
[1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:20.480]  and they bully they got studies and i ran 80 percent people don't want to be under it most
[1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:24.640]  muslims actually don't want to be under the radical islam or orthodox islam but the point is they're
[1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:30.720]  run by really bad people so islam itself from the head towards the tail just gets more rotten
[1:36:31.840 --> 1:36:36.400]  as you get towards the head now i'm going to go back to mr bracken here in a moment be sure to

[1:39:57.520 --> 1:40:04.240]  month now i'm just gonna let you know that point blank i'm going to create a larger bureau here in
[1:40:04.240 --> 1:40:11.120]  austin one in london because history is happening and we're so effective i meant to just wake people
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:14.800]  up and see other people pop up that would be more effective than us i don't like having to organize
[1:40:14.800 --> 1:40:19.760]  stuff i don't like having to do all this but i'm not complaining at the same time i just know it's
[1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:25.040]  my destiny i'm doing it i'm gonna all out we quite frankly don't have the money to launch all these
[1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:29.920]  expansions but every time i expand on faith and i don't mean to be cheesy it's true my gut knows
[1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:35.040]  we're going to build it it's going to be successful and i'm going to pour our reserves our backups
[1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:41.680]  if i have to i'll sell my house okay i'm going to do this because people give their lives for the
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:46.880]  basic freedoms we're now facing a naked enemy that openly admits it wants to enslave us and kill
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:51.280]  our president they tried to kill nizel for us three times folks that's why he got out of politics
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:55.520]  and i don't let me at least got out of you're about to take over europe i mean three times they tried
[1:40:55.520 --> 1:40:59.200]  to kill him and that's kind of off the record but he's talked about it some now so i can talk about
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:03.200]  it but i know the details he's been told you shut up you're dead well he's come back from retireme he's
[1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:06.880]  not shutting up and his family's like please we need you we haven't had you in 20 years and i'm not
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:11.520]  complaining here just folks understand this is a war they're not in the new york times the washington
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:18.800]  post and in uh today uh in vice magazine saying what would happen within minutes and hours of
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:23.440]  ecu in america and and all these jezebel's calling for trump's death they wouldn't be doing this if
[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:28.080]  they hadn't been given a green light you wouldn't have uh people like mccain calling for trump's
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:32.640]  removal and the former ci director saying he's despicable remove him but they didn't have some
[1:41:32.640 --> 1:41:37.520]  powerful people behind them they've gotten in some rooms they're all hyped up the words gone out
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:41.920]  we're taking over we're gonna kill and and you know what i'm not looking for trouble but here's
[1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:46.320]  the deal i'm a hundred percent committed and we're doing everything we can to affect the
[1:41:46.320 --> 1:41:52.640]  battle space and informational but the problem is i know we're gonna wipe these people out of a
[1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:57.360]  shooting war starts i just they're such crap it's not even worth losing our patriots in a fight you
[1:41:57.360 --> 1:42:01.760]  know what that's what waters the tree so i don't sit up here and shoot my mouth off about violence all
[1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:06.160]  day like you people do but just understand people are making a list or marketing twice i'm not the
[1:42:06.160 --> 1:42:12.400]  guys that know how to do it are and all of you are in for a big surprise within hours of you
[1:42:12.400 --> 1:42:17.360]  killing trump or pulling something you just signed your own you know what warren matt bracken take
[1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:21.360]  over for the rest of the hour i've said my pieces but i want you to talk about that and and just all
[1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:28.800]  these other angles go ahead yeah i was um going back to to uh quiback city i think it's really
[1:42:28.800 --> 1:42:32.880]  important for people to understand something because we just dodged the bullet up there because
[1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:38.320]  i'm convinced this was meant to be a major major false flag operation while they had their people
[1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:43.680]  in the streets while they were activating them yeah i i need to use an analogy and i'm not i don't
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:49.040]  mean to use this analogy for anything to do with explosives it's just um to understand how this works
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:55.520]  if you're setting off a fertilizer bomb which is you know a ammonium nitrate and fuel oil
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:01.760]  and foe you can't throw a match in it the match will go out you can't even throw a blasting cap
[1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:06.560]  in it the blasting cap will just blow some and foe around you need to have a good amount of
[1:43:06.560 --> 1:43:12.160]  foe around you need to have a progression the match lights the blast the fuse lights the
[1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:18.880]  blasting cap lights a stick of dynamite that is enough to kick off the anphone make the big explosion
[1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:27.520]  what we saw in in quiback city the way i look at it it was intended to be of that one of those
[1:43:27.520 --> 1:43:35.520]  booster charges you need to accelerate the hysteria the panic it was a misfire if yeah it was a
[1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:41.440]  misfire exactly that's why they went from daily beast at the crack of dawn this morning showing
[1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:47.760]  two white french guys with rifles to having to retract it they were already prime right they
[1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:52.640]  were primed and the people were already at the airports imagine how easy it would be to shut
[1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:57.680]  this country down with people just acting a little bit more hysterical at the airports the country
[1:43:57.680 --> 1:44:03.200]  would come to a halt so if imagine and this is what we have to the reason i'm talking about this is
[1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:08.960]  is next hour or next week this can happen and we need people to be tuned in for the likelihood
[1:44:08.960 --> 1:44:16.000]  that this will be a false flag operation and unlike quiback city it might be a very successful
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:22.480]  false flag operation where there's a white patsy you know with the smoking ak-47 uh dead outside
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:27.280]  the mosque by the way you were saying this i from memory we got to find the tape six months ago
[1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:32.880]  months ago yeah it's it's going to happen where it'll be a you know somebody shooting it from an
[1:44:32.880 --> 1:44:37.280]  over you're right you're right their only move is to make themselves the victim you're absolutely
[1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:42.560]  right matt it's not a question of input when well they're already on in the streets because then
[1:44:42.560 --> 1:44:49.920]  it'll go from in the streets to doing something that is extremely disruptive such as uh uh you
[1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:56.240]  know storming through airport turns the airport security which would absolutely just stop air
[1:44:56.240 --> 1:45:00.880]  traffic around which they mean to punch the stock market with soros made moves against the stock
[1:45:00.880 --> 1:45:05.520]  market today uh in conjunction with demonizing trump so they're already trying that in fact it
[1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:10.560]  appears they had it all set with this false flag you're probably right and and and the riots they
[1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:16.960]  already had primed for a stock market plunge to blame trump but it failed right and and the moment
[1:45:16.960 --> 1:45:24.160]  is lost because the you know gradually the new media gets the word out that the that these uh six
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:30.080]  um countries were just obamas terror failed terror states these are nations like libya and
[1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:36.960]  sudan and yemen that we don't or somalia nobody that's useful to our country comes out of there
[1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:41.520]  well they don't even really have real airports right i mean places like somalia you can't go
[1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:46.240]  there and stay alive if you're a you know white christian you'd be dead or kidnapped in a week
[1:45:46.240 --> 1:45:55.520]  but if if this attack in quebec city had worked god help us right now the country would be in a
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:46:02.560]  if let's say 50 muslims had been killed and there is a blue eyed kebek qua outside dead
[1:46:02.560 --> 1:46:07.120]  which i think is one of the ways that this scenario was intended to play out you know i
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:12.560]  i think that mohammed kadir he's not i don't think i don't see him as the mastermind it's possible
[1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:18.960]  i see him as you know patty one and patty two this and that and kadir but somebody there's
[1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:25.040]  some dr rowell x out there you know that's that's organizing these and it won't be the last believe
[1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:30.560]  me this is this will not i'm so glad i got you on because i did something was fishy but no you
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:34.400]  had how they tried to plunge the stock market this morning how they put out the fake news
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:40.560]  and the site you mentioned is is is synced with soros uh yeah they oh they got caught in dry run
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:46.880]  or or it misfired i think it was a misfire and the left will try to just bury the story i mean
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:51.680]  it's it's amazing at at ten o'clock i was just right at the top of the hour ten o'clock this
[1:46:51.680 --> 1:46:56.160]  morning eastern i was flipping between that's your other big tell the fact that they jump on
[1:46:56.160 --> 1:47:00.800]  it immediately and it evaporates show it didn't go where they wanted it just didn't it's like an
[1:47:00.800 --> 1:47:07.920]  unstory a non-story if this had been a white guy with an ak-47 dead outside of a mosque with 50
[1:47:07.920 --> 1:47:13.120]  dead muslims inside the the people that are at the airports now would be would be shutting
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:18.160]  the airports down and it would legitimize all them out there oh look trump supporter goes and
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:24.640]  does this but he lived the dumb mind control or easily influenced idiot lived and so now it's not
[1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:29.360]  you can see it now like matt you're absolutely right they absolutely had the whole thing set up
[1:47:29.360 --> 1:47:34.400]  a lot of times these guys go off at the wrong time going back to the weather underground you
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:39.760]  know the the bomb meant for the fort dicks officers club dance goes off in the townhouse
[1:47:40.720 --> 1:47:47.200]  in this case i'm not sure because there are the reports of the ala akbar i'm not sure if
[1:47:47.200 --> 1:47:52.800]  mohammed kadir had one idea and the bison had another about how it was going to play out but
[1:47:52.800 --> 1:48:00.720]  if you go on gates of vienna or vlad tepe s blog rebel media which is a canadian youtube channel
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:05.520]  i'm sure will be all over this we need to look carefully into the canadian connections there
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:12.320]  were apparently two competing mosques up there there's a more radical mosque and a more moderate
[1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:17.680]  mosque the moderate mosque is the one that was attacked sure that's the way it always is profile
[1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:23.120]  this is a classic profile of a false flag you know that the bolsheviks set off a bomb at the
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:28.160]  mensheviks and blame it on the russian cadets you know what i'm saying you don't sure they ran
[1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:32.960]  false flags against the white russians right you don't run a false flag against your own mosque
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:39.600]  you you run a false flag against the moderate yeah you kill two birds along stone right you kill
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:44.400]  two birds with one plus it makes a more sympathetic than it's a liberal mosque and you and you were
[1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:50.080]  right and you wear a mask because they might have recognized you at that mosque you know survivors
[1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:55.040]  might have recognized you so on the bottom line we better trump doesn't do the stuff like i'm able
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:59.600]  to scare people we should be on maximum terror alert right now but watching for false flags
[1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:07.600]  yes and and any knuckleheads on our sides please don't do anything stupid if it's a false flag
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:12.400]  that's one thing we'll get to the bottom of it i'm guessing just like within our own fbi
[1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:19.040]  regarding uh hillary emails and all of that up right now in the canadian royal mounted police
[1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:24.880]  that there is probably a lot of pressure to bury this thing if it looks like it was a
[1:49:24.880 --> 1:49:31.120]  false flag and there will be honest investigators and detectives uh interrogating this i i think
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:36.640]  it's the bisonet who was uh that called himself in that oh yeah wait it's going to come out he's
[1:49:36.640 --> 1:49:41.120]  being handled by trudeau uh you know and the federal police it's going to come out he's
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:46.480]  being handled by some foundation group bet money we'll hear by tomorrow it was known a year ago
[1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:51.840]  that he was in whatever radical group but nothing was done or if he was not in a radical group if
[1:49:51.840 --> 1:49:58.640]  he was secretly radicalized so that he could be used as a throwaway patsy if he was not a
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:03.200]  mosque goer but he just came under the orbit say of mohammed qadir well that's the problem with a
[1:50:03.200 --> 1:50:09.440]  pure false flag like this is the wind up toys lose faith they get cold feet or things don't go as
[1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:14.320]  well because you know these patsies are not the sharpest knives right and the patsy might have
[1:50:14.320 --> 1:50:20.320]  even been told we're just going to go into the backsliding moderate mosque that the you know the
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:25.520]  apostate mosque and we're just going to shoot some guns and scare them he might not have even been
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:32.000]  prepared to see people killed but in any in any event i would be looking for him to commit suicide
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:38.080]  in jail i look for him to to hang himself from the vent duck because if he's got uh a lot of
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:44.400]  knowledge about um you know the handle his handlers or any knowledge about handlers above mohammed
[1:50:44.400 --> 1:50:51.120]  qadir i would look for him to have a very short life in captivity and he's got that delicate genius
[1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:55.040]  look where they think they're so smart it looks like a classic idiot patsy to me why they don't
[1:50:55.040 --> 1:51:02.880]  look the same they got that dumbass look we'll be right back with mad braggant taking turmeric is

[1:54:42.320 --> 1:54:59.520]  rock and roll right there you know the incredible stuff going on is so bizarre and so amazing and
[1:54:59.520 --> 1:55:04.080]  everything trump is doing is just delivering delivering on everything he said he do really
[1:55:04.080 --> 1:55:09.200]  trying to restore the republic and just to be coming out of all this premeditated political
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:16.160]  evil and scheming and machiavellian crap and just his straight shooting with mccain others
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:20.720]  want to start a war with russia he goes let's worry about islamic terror and china and other
[1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:27.040]  stuff not your obsession with world war three it's so refreshing how real trump is and i'm a
[1:55:27.040 --> 1:55:34.080]  pessimist folks but i gotta tell you trump's a treasure but i'm very very sad the radicalization
[1:55:34.080 --> 1:55:39.920]  of the general public against him maybe 30 percent of the public that 25 percent that is frothing
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:47.040]  is really ready to go to war and then i look at the people they've got it's it's it's a pathetic
[1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:50.880]  crew matt you've gotten into this whole false flag and where this is going i mean i agree
[1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:56.080]  with you it's called the telltale signs doesn't make any sense they had their stories all prime
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:56:00.160]  now it's gone away uh you could see that what they're trying to stock market with all the
[1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:06.480]  demonstrations going on this is clearly a move uh to you know to to try to tug on heart strings i
[1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:10.960]  don't see anything they can do succeeding if they don't kill trump he's got good generals around him
[1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:16.240]  i know they know what they're up to they're ready for a coup they're ready for paramilitary action
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:20.960]  against them i'll just obviously leave it at that the enemy knows that uh but trump's got plans
[1:56:21.920 --> 1:56:26.800]  boy they should have got him before he got in but at the same time i don't want the president going
[1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:31.680]  to a fortress mentality uh but this next few months is critical what do you think president
[1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:36.720]  trump should do because as you said they're putting out the narrative uh the cause celeb that
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:42.080]  trump needs to be killed uh that way it's plausibly deniable but i just want people to know everybody
[1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:46.720]  that's been calling for his death we're going to hold you responsible not a vengeful person but
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:51.680]  it's not fair in the universe that all these chicken necks and cowards and scum run around calling
[1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:55.760]  for violence all day and they're not being on the receiving end of it if they start it so
[1:56:55.760 --> 1:56:59.680]  so that's all i'm saying is is that people are going to get their necks broken here if they pull
[1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:04.720]  so yeah when i when i when you look at the uh so-called women's march on washington um and
[1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:10.560]  do you see the uh you know the timid little men gynas that are you know basically going along
[1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:17.680]  i'm i just think brainwashing really works you can brainwash people into hating their european
[1:57:17.680 --> 1:57:23.600]  ancestry like that lady from Idaho at the democratic retreat that was you know saying i'm here to
[1:57:23.600 --> 1:57:30.400]  shut other white people down you can brainwash men into hating their masculinity and you can
[1:57:30.400 --> 1:57:37.120]  brainwash women into calling themselves a feminist but putting on a hijab in solidarity with people
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:43.040]  that would sell them in a slave market if they were in charge the brainwashing really works
[1:57:43.040 --> 1:57:49.440]  and when you have a a vertical stovepipe information delivery system even in a free society
[1:57:49.440 --> 1:57:56.320]  you can get a really insulated mindset where you where even though it might be a feedback
[1:57:56.320 --> 1:58:01.280]  loop it's a feedback loop and they're all being fed this foundation garbage so they're the susceptible
[1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:05.520]  ones we should feel sorry for them like they're the ones that were susceptible to the spanish flu
[1:58:05.520 --> 1:58:11.760]  but then what do we do then to counteract the brainwashing well the problem the our advantage
[1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:17.440]  is that our advantage is that we see their propaganda we read their organs you know we
[1:58:17.440 --> 1:58:25.360]  can't help it it's the mainstream media so the more that we can get out the new media uh the videos

[2:00:15.920 --> 2:00:24.240]  i was always brought up you didn't brag but an information war people need to know we're winning
[2:00:24.960 --> 2:00:32.400]  they need to know that we're hitting 41 million people on average that's our new low we had about
[2:00:32.400 --> 2:00:36.320]  60 million the week of the inauguration it looks like it's gonna be 50 plus million this week
[2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:41.920]  our graph is just going straight up that's why the enemy is attacking us daily that's why they're
[2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:46.800]  doing a lot of other things behind the scenes and i really am not a liberty to get into but it
[2:00:46.800 --> 2:00:51.520]  doesn't scare me to live in a james bond movie i'll put it to you that way and there's a lot of
[2:00:51.520 --> 2:00:56.160]  friends of freedom as well there's not just evil in this world and i will tell the enemies of freedom
[2:00:56.160 --> 2:01:01.280]  something metaphysically you've released your titans our doors are opening and our titans are
[2:01:01.280 --> 2:01:06.240]  coming out as well a lot of people that have been waiting now knows the time to move so this
[2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:10.720]  isn't a threat it's a warning to people that want to stage false flags or kill trump or
[2:01:10.720 --> 2:01:17.200]  come after us i'm not a wishful thinker i'm i'm i'm i'm a pessimist but let me tell you
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:21.200]  we're pretty much assured of victory if you go into a physical conflict we've got four minutes
[2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:26.560]  left matt brackenman of enemies far and domestic dot com uh you're a great political brain uh the
[2:01:26.560 --> 2:01:30.960]  salivating the calls for killing trump putting it out into the pheromone aether killing killing
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:35.520]  killing blow up the white house it's getting into a frenzy and it's only intensifying uh
[2:01:36.560 --> 2:01:39.520]  these just look like people that want to get knocked down and hurt real bad
[2:01:39.520 --> 2:01:46.000]  yeah sometimes sometimes these communist revolutions lose big time uh it happened in
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:53.600]  finland it's happened in other places in indonesia and you you need to the people that think that
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:01:59.280]  the government is the solution and that the federal law enforcement agents are their hammer and their
[2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:05.200]  fist well that's over now the trump is in and people that think that dressing up like a vagina
[2:02:05.200 --> 2:02:12.000]  uh you know is is a way to uh secure political victory they need to consider how many people
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:17.760]  go out in the uh woods you know with high powered rifles and their hobby is shooting 200 pound mammals
[2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:23.920]  and skinning them uh you know they mistake what what what's happening is the left mistakes
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:30.080]  are forbearance and our tolerance a very deep abiding for they take our kindness for weakness
[2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:34.240]  and i never know why we people i never know why we people take your kindness for weakness they
[2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:40.400]  just they don't get it they don't get it and they don't get that you know going out in freezing cold
[2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:46.560]  weather and you know sitting up in a tree for uh half the night waiting for a 200 pound mammal
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:52.560]  to walk walk along so you can shoot it turn it into meat and stick it in the in the freezer
[2:02:52.560 --> 2:02:59.360]  this these are not the kind of people you want to absolutely have lose it and if trump was assassinated
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:05.360]  you know millions of people like i just described would absolutely lose it and you know there's
[2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:11.280]  the old uh you know there's the old adage you know think globally act locally you know within
[2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:16.880]  your own they start a civil war you know people are going to be acting locally really bad right
[2:03:16.880 --> 2:03:23.760]  and there's and we know from the last 10 or 15 years that there's nobody on earth that can stop
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:29.920]  lone actors there used to be an arm away within 48 hours all the police are going to evacuate
[2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:34.240]  and not support these globalists they should know that especially if the if the people that
[2:03:34.240 --> 2:03:40.880]  are pulling triggers they don't even tell their families or anybody they just go out i i have
[2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:46.320]  this kind of scenario in my first novel enemies foreign and domestic if you've just got a target
[2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:52.480]  list that if that if this ever happened this is what i would do and the next thing you know uh
[2:03:52.480 --> 2:03:56.880]  people are starting to get shot i would i hope that this doesn't happen i mean it's unfortunate
[2:03:56.880 --> 2:04:01.120]  but if they want to have a george soros take over and lock us up and tell us and stuff and they
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:06.160]  ask for it i mean they just don't know it's people ready for 20 years i mean right we're hoping
[2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:10.560]  for peace we we elected trump we want to fix things but i mean you know and i'm not planning
[2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:15.280]  myself i just know what's going on i really sorry for him quite frankly they can control
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:21.680]  they can shut down traffic in cities they can they can blockade a highway uh they can cause mayhem
[2:04:21.680 --> 2:04:29.680]  at airports uh maybe they can crash the stock market but in the end it's the red county states
[2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:34.400]  where the food comes from it's where the we've already occupied and conquered the country
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:40.320]  we've already occupied i i often say you know to liberals how much food do they grow inside
[2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:46.480]  the beltway because if that food conveyor is ever shut off it'll be hard times for everybody
[2:04:46.480 --> 2:04:50.240]  matt i want to get you back this week to talk about the worst case scenarios maybe friday for
[2:04:50.240 --> 2:04:54.640]  two hours if they do pull a coup and try to come arrest the patriots as they had planned
[2:04:54.640 --> 2:05:21.840]  under obama's mentor what do people do we've got to talk about emergency plans thank you sir
[2:05:21.840 --> 2:05:27.440]  donald trump chose so why no protests then over obama but now over trump coverage and transparency
[2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:30.960]  see trump is transparent with the moves he is making and the media is always in attack mode
[2:05:30.960 --> 2:05:35.280]  against him while obama made his moves over holidays and the media ignored them the cnns
[2:05:35.280 --> 2:05:39.200]  of the world over the weekend could be heard using this radical leftist double think trumps
[2:05:39.200 --> 2:05:44.080]  travel ban is islamic phobic and trumps travel ban will increase risk of islamic terror yes i'm
[2:05:44.080 --> 2:05:48.960]  sure trumps non-fatal travel ban angered more people in that region than obama's fatal drones
[2:05:48.960 --> 2:05:53.520]  and bombs which if we get to the bottom of that would clear a lot of this up but the trump protesters
[2:05:53.520 --> 2:05:59.040]  made new signs and took to the streets again why coverage and transparency this is oan shroyer for

[2:10:15.840 --> 2:10:22.240]  and trump is basically over delivering he is doing so much executive orders for every regulation
[2:10:22.240 --> 2:10:28.880]  that they passed to have to be rescinded defending our borders enforcing the law obama passed with
[2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:33.600]  failed countries like samalia didn't even have an airport of course we have people
[2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:40.240]  conflying in and vetted from samalia i mean it's just crazy to watch the media in in all of this
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:46.160]  deception and i've been wanting to get her on for a while because i've read articles about her book

[2:10:57.440 --> 2:11:02.080]  you saw obama get elected i'm a paraphrasing from an article i read she went independent because
[2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:05.680]  she could just see by who he was appointing what he was going to do i want to get her take on
[2:11:06.720 --> 2:11:10.160]  trump and what she thinks he's going to do i'm going to go over her whole
[2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:16.720]  bio but she's got a phd emba earned a doctorate in applied mathematics from harvard university

[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:19.840]  main street bailout dot com is the main site but she joins us now to just look at the world we're
[2:12:19.840 --> 2:12:26.160]  in i mean it's like we're living in a comic book with classic villains and classic tyrants but
[2:12:26.160 --> 2:12:31.040]  different sides see villains and tyrants in different shapes all i see trump doing is
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:37.600]  finally doing what a statesman or politician says they do and trying to deliver on free market
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:43.280]  capitalism and what made this country great i i've been such a pessimist so long that my head
[2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:47.680]  spinning and then i'm somebody used to support the democrats on many issues i was independent
[2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:51.440]  i was never a democrat i've been more quote conservatives have been pro god and pro life but
[2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:55.280]  i hate the republican party established but they're terrible look what they've done to trump but
[2:12:55.280 --> 2:13:00.800]  the democrats now they have just gone insane and i don't even know what to say at this point
[2:13:00.800 --> 2:13:06.080]  i used to laugh at him it's i'm more i cry for him now i mean i'm scared i got i got three kids
[2:13:06.080 --> 2:13:11.120]  i'm kind of ranting here to dr mack but i mean where should we start well first of all elix thanks
[2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:16.000]  for having me on thank you listen to you for years and it was nice to finally talk to you in person
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:19.840]  well not in person but well we're talking in person right now with the phone so thank you for joining
[2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:25.280]  us you're welcome so where do we start wherever you'd like i mean you're the you're the expert on so
[2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:30.560]  much well as i was telling eco i mean there's been so much going on and only the first week
[2:13:31.360 --> 2:13:37.040]  that is actually pretty amazing to me i've been following politics and financial markets for a
[2:13:37.040 --> 2:13:43.440]  while and i've never seen a president move fast and so decisively and i think even more importantly
[2:13:43.440 --> 2:13:49.200]  he's doing what he said he was going to do i i i i actually just may have made my friends
[2:13:49.200 --> 2:13:54.880]  but listen to most of trump brally's speeches and he's literally doing what he said he was going to do
[2:13:54.880 --> 2:13:59.760]  which is i think shocking to a lot of people well the elite knew that that's why they were so scared
[2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:05.440]  that trump is i don't want to say ocd but the thing is he's so straight shooting that's why in
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:10.240]  negotiations they say he's rude and mean he's just straight shoots so i'd like to say texas has a
[2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:14.640]  monopoly on that but looks like new york just brought it back big time well i lived in both new
[2:14:14.640 --> 2:14:21.200]  york and texas and i think they both were straight shooters but in slightly different styles wow well
[2:14:21.200 --> 2:14:25.520]  we'll just break down your book and and trump and just your whole world view and where you think
[2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:31.600]  things are going okay well for as trump goes i've been following trump for years i you know even
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:38.160]  before i knew about him as a reality tv show store or whatever because i used to read his books
[2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:43.760]  i mean i read the order of the deal and when i did my mba we had a few case studies that you know
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:49.040]  his name came up so i thought when he first said he was going to run that was the best thing that we
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:53.920]  could have but when i mentioned it to some of my friends i mean i lost a few of them along the way
[2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:58.960]  sure me too and even some of my family members now they're coming around because they see
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:07.120]  he's you know he's a man of action and so i mean if we can get through some of the hysteria
[2:15:07.120 --> 2:15:12.880]  that we've seen over the past week or so hopefully if things can settle down people can appreciate
[2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:18.320]  some of the things he's trying to do i know he's not as you say you know it's a it's a little bit
[2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:23.280]  maybe rough around the edges sometimes but i'm kind of like that too i i i'm from new Orleans and we
[2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:29.440]  we're pretty straight shooters down here as well um so i have high hopes for what he's going to do but
[2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:34.640]  i i can see that it's not going to be easy i have friends even from europe and asia
[2:15:35.360 --> 2:15:39.120]  partly because of what they're hearing in the mainstream media as you call it fake news
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:43.280]  they're calling me and asking me what's going on are you scared or what are you guys doing
[2:15:43.280 --> 2:15:47.200]  over there and i said come on you know they were referring to the muslim band and i pointed out to
[2:15:47.200 --> 2:15:52.080]  them look this was done by obama administration trump didn't even list the names of the companies
[2:15:52.080 --> 2:15:55.920]  in his executive order i mean it's amazing to me you have to tell us the people because it's right
[2:15:55.920 --> 2:16:02.160]  down the internet that's what's crazy he literally just just he just copied obama's law knowing he'd
[2:16:02.160 --> 2:16:07.120]  be attacked and it's crazy and then have you i'm sure you see they're everywhere saying kill him
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:11.840]  in the newspapers listen i never said kill hillary or obama because i don't turn him into martyrs but
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:17.280]  if i talk like that dr mack i'd be arrested very quickly and i should be madonna says blow up the
[2:16:17.280 --> 2:16:22.640]  white house she's got a powerful voice yeah you would be have a system to form fdi agent and you
[2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:29.440]  would you would be in jail you know pretty quickly so yeah in terms of trump i think you know he's
[2:16:30.720 --> 2:16:34.480]  he's capable of you know getting a lot done if he doesn't have too many roadblocks put in the way
[2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:37.920]  so we'll see it's only been one week but i'm impressed with the first week
[2:16:38.560 --> 2:16:42.160]  sure the reason i say that is i've read a synopsis of your book and i'm and i'm
[2:16:42.160 --> 2:16:47.040]  i'm attentive you know how it is you get busy and older and kids i i'm gonna read it some weekend
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:51.920]  but but i mean i love your idea about we need to bail out for for for for main street like we've
[2:16:51.920 --> 2:16:56.240]  done for these big foreign mega banks if we do that it will build an economy that'll help empower
[2:16:56.240 --> 2:17:01.920]  the world so i've read the synopsis of your book but i mean let's get into your plan and then how
[2:17:01.920 --> 2:17:07.520]  you tie it into trump's plan okay well my plan is basically been my plan way before i knew trump
[2:17:07.520 --> 2:17:10.560]  i mean i grew sure i mean that's why i think it's interesting because i've read the synopsis
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:14.080]  it sounds like what trump's saying but it's just common sense people think that's why
[2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:18.160]  i think i was always attracted to what he had to say because i grew up in a housing project
[2:17:18.160 --> 2:17:23.440]  new olien so we had to have common sense my parents didn't play with you know anything else so i've
[2:17:23.440 --> 2:17:28.560]  always been the kind of person look yeah you get mad for a minute but as ross burrow used to say get
[2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:33.200]  even so when i show people in the book i mean i walked through some of the standard things
[2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:39.040]  about how the derivatives markets work and how big it is 1.6 quadrillion i walked through how the
[2:17:39.040 --> 2:17:43.920]  federal reserve system works and i explained how the federal reserve gave backdoor bailouts a tune
[2:17:43.920 --> 2:17:50.480]  of 16 trading to the banks international and domestic but i said fine okay but i'm a mathematician
[2:17:50.480 --> 2:17:54.960]  too we don't just there's a lot of my economists friends do and we always debate this they like
[2:17:54.960 --> 2:17:59.760]  to talk about the problem of mathematicians we like to solve problems so i literally show people
[2:17:59.760 --> 2:18:05.760]  we walk through step by step with trading illustrations trading screenshots taking
[2:18:05.760 --> 2:18:10.960]  download calculators and checklists we show them how to make a profit from wall street
[2:18:10.960 --> 2:18:16.000]  by doing what's called a cover call option and all it is is you're renting your stock back to
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:21.360]  exchange and you collect money i mean when i show that to my family and friends or my students
[2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:26.560]  the first reaction is like you'll get the blank out of here you know exactly all the tricks the
[2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:31.920]  big guys use locals aren't using them when they're so easy and that's why i'm asking you about trump
[2:18:31.920 --> 2:18:35.600]  because so many of the common sense things you talk about the things he talks about as a business
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:40.400]  person yeah because what trump is thought of like i mean i'm not to the same level but
[2:18:41.120 --> 2:18:46.640]  he was an insider now he's showing you what's going on and as one of my brothers said he used to work
[2:18:46.640 --> 2:18:51.440]  for a major oil company he has a lot more money in his stock portfolio than i do and when he came
[2:18:51.440 --> 2:18:56.800]  to visit me he said look my broker never told me this and i before i got into explaining to them
[2:18:56.800 --> 2:19:02.480]  what i do in the book i said go to my bookshelves and pull off the books that say options or derivatives
[2:19:02.480 --> 2:19:07.360]  that open it up and he would open up and he goes this is like greek i say well that's all i'm doing
[2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:12.480]  i'm translating the greek to the people on the street because all you do when you do certain
[2:19:12.480 --> 2:19:17.840]  derivatives deals even though it has a lot of fancy math a lot of fancy financial market you know
[2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:24.640]  terminology but i break it down to somebody basically you know on a street corner i say look
[2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:30.000]  when we do a cover call option trade where you have a stock and then a wall street terminology
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:36.320]  which you do is you own the stock you short a call option i want to cut this off dr iris max stay
[2:19:36.320 --> 2:19:41.280]  right there main street bailout.com i want to come back and start over so we have some time getting
[2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:46.480]  into like learning what the establishment what the elites do to get rich themselves
[2:19:46.480 --> 2:19:50.800]  then what the public to know about it i want to ask you as a mathematician looking at trump's
[2:19:50.800 --> 2:19:55.520]  economic plans do you think they're viable i mean obviously growth's the answer but how big
[2:19:55.520 --> 2:19:59.680]  do the cuts need to be to get out of this hole or do we just bubble our way out of it we'll talk

[2:24:13.520 --> 2:24:19.280]  dr iris max book the whole street bailout for main street gets into the tricks the big wigs
[2:24:19.280 --> 2:24:25.120]  use dominate the markets that the general public including people like her brother who's successful
[2:24:25.120 --> 2:24:29.440]  in business didn't know about so we're talking about some of these tricks and then we're gonna
[2:24:29.440 --> 2:24:34.080]  also the next time we get a little bit into her view on the economy and what she thinks
[2:24:34.080 --> 2:24:39.360]  should be done but but but first off what do you make of trump saying for every new regulation
[2:24:39.360 --> 2:24:44.960]  you've got to repeal to well i think that's a good idea because i also have a small business and i
[2:24:44.960 --> 2:24:52.160]  went and i had it for over 10 years and you can see over the period of that time how paperwork
[2:24:52.160 --> 2:24:58.880]  for things that you think just shouldn't even be never fair or just it's ridiculous and you
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:03.920]  can't compete like that if you're small compared to say i'd be on my google or whatever so even
[2:25:03.920 --> 2:25:08.080]  i've been in academia i've always because a kid wanted to be an entrepreneur so i understand
[2:25:08.080 --> 2:25:12.880]  exactly what he's saying i think that's the problem a lot of people as i jokely tell my friends
[2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:17.280]  sometimes you know they have pretty good jobs and i say look i think there should be a law
[2:25:17.280 --> 2:25:23.680]  that says everybody should be an entrepreneur for at least six months and then people will appreciate
[2:25:23.680 --> 2:25:27.600]  stuff because they go to work they collect the check they don't know where it comes the money
[2:25:27.600 --> 2:25:33.120]  comes from they don't care so i agree with trump exactly i mean some of the zoners and government
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:37.920]  people here in austin i know texas supposedly is free state it's not many areas they're like if
[2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:43.760]  you've got an operation or a business you're hiring people you're somehow a criminal i mean
[2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:48.800]  they are on your butt uh now now doc let's start getting into the key though your book what it breaks
[2:25:48.800 --> 2:25:53.920]  down let's talk about some of these tricks okay let me give you a simple analogy if you on a house
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:59.440]  or an apartment and you're not living in it what do you normally do with it rent it yeah so what i
[2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:05.360]  tell people is if you on stop most time people buy stock they put it in their portfolio and they hope
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:10.080]  and pray to god it's going to go up but while you're praying you could rent it back to exchange
[2:26:10.080 --> 2:26:14.320]  that's what it is that's all i'm doing but i you have to learn learn a technique technical
[2:26:14.320 --> 2:26:21.680]  terminology for it but basically when you own stock you can buy a call sell a call option on the
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:26.960]  stock that's basically legal contract that allows you to turn around and rent that stock back to
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:32.240]  exchange and they pay you right away i mean i show my brothers and friends in a kind of house
[2:26:32.240 --> 2:26:36.480]  because i have a trading platform set up at home and they can see the credit it goes right into your
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:42.880]  account you collect money that's how rich people get richer and sometimes they can i mean how many
[2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:49.920]  times do they leverage leverage the derivatives well this is a this this is a derivative so i do
[2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:57.200]  explain in the book look we have a 1.5 1.6 how much derivative quadrillion derivative market
[2:26:57.200 --> 2:27:02.320]  and i explain it in detail it should approve how it's comparing to the global GDP it's gonna blow
[2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:08.320]  up eventually no no i get it the elita created it to consolidate power and to shave money off the top
[2:27:08.320 --> 2:27:12.240]  why shouldn't we do it i mean i totally get what you're saying i agree with you that's what i said
[2:27:12.240 --> 2:27:16.800]  legal so while the market is still you know a lot sure i'm saying how many times can you keep
[2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:23.360]  leveraging derivatives you've got can you can do it forever because basically if i own the stock
[2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:29.760]  and i write i sell a call option on it i can choose the parameters of the contract and that's what
[2:27:29.760 --> 2:27:33.600]  explained to people in the book with a lot of illustrations because you have a lot of things
[2:27:33.600 --> 2:27:37.600]  that influence the derivatives contract not like a stock you have the interest rate you have the
[2:27:37.600 --> 2:27:43.120]  volatility you have the price of the stock you have a few other things so i show you how to
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:49.440]  predict you have the date of expiration so you can rent your stock weekly monthly quarterly whatever
[2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:54.800]  and and again the elites are doing this themselves but don't want us to know about it yeah what
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:27:59.760]  big is that as i told my brother when he was kind of mad because he has a lot more stock and money
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:05.840]  than i do and he saw my books all over my you know apartment and he i say well just pull off the
[2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:10.800]  books i say options and derivatives and open them up and it's everyone he goes this looks like
[2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:15.600]  green this looks like green sure so i mean ballpark here let's say somebody's got a million dollars
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:21.920]  in stocks you could be collecting tens of thousands of dollars a month easily wow and i've shown people
[2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:25.920]  like there's a lot of stocks don't grow that much but if you're renting them out then you would make
[2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:30.880]  money that's crazy really you wouldn't if you put that in the bank would you get half a six percent
[2:28:30.880 --> 2:28:36.720]  interest no i'm talking about collecting you know thousands of dollars that's what's crazy they've
[2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:40.880]  gotten rid of was zero percent interest regular folks are getting interest so the general public
[2:28:40.880 --> 2:28:44.960]  doesn't know what to do but of course the elite created something for themselves and that's what
[2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:50.080]  you've basically exposed and covered it i mean i knew about this but i'm i'm glad you wrote a book
[2:28:50.080 --> 2:28:54.400]  about it i'm glad you exposed it it's amazing there's only one type what a reason why it's not i wouldn't
[2:28:54.400 --> 2:29:01.440]  say it's not exposed but most of these books were written for people or by people like me phd's and
[2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:07.040]  mathematics and we do know i got it you take it and put it into plain english yeah i got from the hood
[2:29:07.040 --> 2:29:11.520]  so i'm explaining to people i hear you i'm just so busy fighting the new world order that i haven't
[2:29:11.520 --> 2:29:16.080]  had time to go out and get any stock or do that to try to fund the operation but i i sure wish i had
[2:29:16.080 --> 2:29:19.840]  because i tell you with what you're doing that's amazing because there's nowhere you get real returns
[2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:24.960]  anymore except for select stocks but if you rent the stocks it's a whole other thing that's crazy
[2:29:24.960 --> 2:29:34.320]  yeah i mean you if you rent say on your shares of um olibaba or maybe 500 shares of ibm you can
[2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:39.360]  actually if you understand as i walk through through the book if i to choose the four or five
[2:29:39.360 --> 2:29:43.280]  parameters you need to choose production contract which is not that hard but you have to understand
[2:29:43.280 --> 2:29:47.920]  the terminology and we explain that now that it's all language and then poor people wonder why they're
[2:29:47.920 --> 2:29:52.080]  not successful because they don't know these these tricks and there's so many in life we'll be back
[2:29:52.080 --> 2:30:03.680]  stay with us on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network new video on info wars dot com

[2:30:34.800 --> 2:30:40.080]  gear and i experienced zero negativity for what i was wearing or my identity as a white male when

[2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:33.440]  to dr iris mac main street bailout dot com is her website her book a wall street bailout for
[2:33:33.440 --> 2:33:39.200]  main street against quantify that for folks are you saying main street the average person can
[2:33:39.200 --> 2:33:44.080]  basically use these tricks that the insiders use to like believe the their financial standing
[2:33:44.960 --> 2:33:49.440]  yeah it's not a trick it's basically a legal contract that you can enter into with the new
[2:33:49.440 --> 2:33:57.600]  york stock exchange or tasdaq whatever where if you own stock you can rent the stock back to
[2:33:57.600 --> 2:34:03.200]  exchange and they pay you money wow rent the apartment it's not a trick it's illegal it's
[2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:07.200]  legal no i know i mean i've seen it in the newspapers i've seen it talked about mentioned
[2:34:07.200 --> 2:34:12.160]  do you have any statistics on how many people actually use this well i do i break something
[2:34:12.160 --> 2:34:17.440]  down in the book but if you go to amazon you'll see tons of books on options and derivatives
[2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:21.920]  only thing is they're not written for the main for the personal main street because i have a lot
[2:34:21.920 --> 2:34:26.720]  of those books on my bookshelves i've used them and when i worked in different financial energy
[2:34:26.720 --> 2:34:32.400]  firms or when i was a grad student or now that i teach there are a lot of books out there i'm
[2:34:32.400 --> 2:34:39.200]  saying it's not like i'm doing something new i just break it down wow what do you make just about
[2:34:39.200 --> 2:34:44.160]  the whole state of the country right now the atmosphere dr mac well i try to avoid having
[2:34:44.160 --> 2:34:47.920]  a lot of conversations with people i don't really know because people look like they're on edge on
[2:34:47.920 --> 2:34:52.400]  the edge and i'm like i got things to do first of all and second of all i don't want to get hurt
[2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:56.400]  i don't want to get hurt no i hear what you're saying i've never seen any election like this
[2:34:56.400 --> 2:35:00.400]  usually people decide who they're going to vote for and they do it and that's the end of it but
[2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:05.440]  now you can't even talk about who you voted for or what you think i've never seen this before
[2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:10.320]  and i've noticed that you know getting worse over the years and i've lived in different
[2:35:10.320 --> 2:35:15.360]  countries and every time i come back i see it look like it's gotten worse no i agree we've got a
[2:35:15.360 --> 2:35:20.160]  story up on drugsreport.com dealing with the fact that the united states is basically on the verge
[2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:26.160]  of civil war with the usual suspects like george soros trying to finance it i just wonder why
[2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:30.480]  are these people above the law as we said earlier if you or i were doing things like this would be
[2:35:30.480 --> 2:35:37.440]  arrested we should i'm not an authoritarian but they're not trying to yell fire in the theater
[2:35:37.440 --> 2:35:42.720]  they're trying to burn down the theater and i see all this with trump really trying to bring
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:47.520]  americans together it's just very very sad well dr iris mack we forward to speaking to you again
[2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:51.920]  in the future main street bailout.com folks can find your book there thank you so much
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:58.160]  well thank you elix yeah i mean i know about derivatives and if you if you just tuned in
[2:35:58.160 --> 2:36:01.200]  we've shown some mainstream news articles talking about what she's talking about but she
[2:36:01.200 --> 2:36:05.040]  she codifies it in the book she's not a sponsor i'm not plugging her book you know
[2:36:05.040 --> 2:36:10.720]  i'm just to make money i'm not selling the book but i think it's important for people to think about
[2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:16.160]  the systems the globalists are using to consolidate control and have power if we learn about those
[2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:21.760]  systems and use it for ourselves they'll generally end up shutting it down because they don't want
[2:36:21.760 --> 2:36:26.480]  us having access to it and if we're going to have all this fiat system and all these derivatives
[2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:31.520]  and all these extra trillions of dollars it should actually go to the people and not do a
[2:36:31.520 --> 2:36:37.040]  bunch of elites and that's what trump's been doing is he's been trying to create a level playing
[2:36:37.040 --> 2:36:42.400]  field for the people and delivering on everything he said he would do and even if i disagree with
[2:36:42.400 --> 2:36:48.640]  some of what trump's doing and i disagree with very little it's so refreshing it's almost cliche
[2:36:48.640 --> 2:36:53.920]  to say boy i wish a politician would do what they said they do in fact i never thought in my life
[2:36:53.920 --> 2:36:59.120]  i'd see something like this i thought he'd have to play politics with some people and water some
[2:36:59.120 --> 2:37:05.280]  stuff down no because he's got the trifecta of the legislative the executive and the judicial
[2:37:06.240 --> 2:37:10.880]  he's running over him now you've got the opposition party as spicer has properly said
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:16.960]  that is msm that's the opposition msm and big mega banks and big corporations that don't
[2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:21.600]  want prosperity they want a monopoly because something weird happened on the way to success
[2:37:21.600 --> 2:37:26.400]  the last 50 60 years all these rich bankers all these rich guys that made all this money off our
[2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:33.680]  free system they don't like lines they don't like traffic they like their golf courses and their
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:44.000]  and their you know hawaiian uh botanical garden retreats and they're really upset about civilization
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:51.920]  and other people doing well okay so the population's a plague kill yourselves first don't live like
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:58.480]  kings with a huge footprint and then tell us we can't exist and so this is the giant massive
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:03.600]  humanity saying we want prosperity and we're not going to be lectured by people that have 15
[2:38:03.600 --> 2:38:10.400]  mistresses and jumbo jets and and 20 mansions apiece and who are all obsessed with their
[2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:16.880]  privacy but we can't have privacy because you say we're not human but you are zuckerberg you made
[2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:22.240]  money off a human system humans are what empowers you dumbass you're not going to just take all this
[2:38:22.240 --> 2:38:27.600]  energy and stuff and then leave and set up your own thing in kawaii if there ever is a new world
[2:38:27.600 --> 2:38:33.920]  order and extermination of the people you're not going to be safe anywhere boy i don't say that
[2:38:33.920 --> 2:38:38.880]  threatening you i know you're a spook i know you're a frontman for a larger operation the point is
[2:38:38.880 --> 2:38:43.760]  you're threatening my life and my family's life and as your own admissions now have come out the
[2:38:43.760 --> 2:38:48.080]  globalists admit they're in a death battle well i knew this was a death battle a long time ago
[2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:52.080]  because i get threats sometimes from people and i make a joke back out of them i say
[2:38:52.800 --> 2:38:57.920]  you you don't think i hadn't been threatened before what i don't want to be around is dishonor
[2:38:58.640 --> 2:39:03.840]  what i don't want to be around is snakes and infiltrators i fear that more than death itself
[2:39:03.840 --> 2:39:11.280]  because i'm sick of scum i'm sick of cowards and i'm sick of people that curl up like snakes
[2:39:11.280 --> 2:39:19.520]  snakes next to the power structure and think because they've sold out to evil somehow they're
[2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:27.840]  winners it's a delusion it's like imagining your captain america when you're not and we're just not
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:33.520]  going to build a good world with people like this at the helm so i'm just here to put my energy
[2:39:33.520 --> 2:39:41.680]  into defeating these people i personally am so self-centered that i'm not self-centered there
[2:39:41.680 --> 2:39:46.480]  stand i'm so committed to the individual that i'm willing to give my life for the individual
[2:39:47.840 --> 2:39:53.440]  i'm so committed to the species because i'm part of it and i love it so much that it's not even a
[2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:59.200]  discussion of fear of being killed or demonized or attacked or lied about people all the time
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:04.720]  i get calls every day like from cousins and family and neighbors and god i saw you get attacked on
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:08.720]  two different news channels tonight local and national they were saying horrible things about
[2:40:08.720 --> 2:40:14.800]  you this morning on the local radio how are you doing how you well i don't judge myself off somebody
[2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:20.480]  else i judge myself off what i'm doing and that's why i've changed the world what other people say
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:26.160]  to me when i know it's a template a bs means nothing now people i trust and love and care about
[2:40:26.160 --> 2:40:30.560]  what they say means a lot to me the people i know are scum
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:42.000]  i basically soar like a condor on the winds on their attacks because that's what guides me towards
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:47.200]  my target now i've got probably they probably bought in 30 articles since i've been on there i
[2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:51.120]  probably got 200 articles here in front of me and i've got 20 minutes left before david night takes
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:55.040]  over i want to just read headlines some of this i've already covered some of this i haven't
[2:40:57.440 --> 2:41:04.080]  but but let me just start just randomly wherever flashback anti trump dims opposed the vietnamese
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:09.520]  refugees cliford cunningham in full wars dot com and of course they tried to block vietnamese
[2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:15.440]  because they were anti-communist just like trump is is battling people that are incompatible well
[2:41:15.440 --> 2:41:20.960]  that's because he's a patriot he don't want to bring his lamas is ten well biden doesn't want vietnamese
[2:41:20.960 --> 2:41:26.320]  refugees they were anti-communist they fought his loving vietnam and obama doesn't want cubans in
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:31.680]  because they're anti-communist see how all the other refugees are great as long as they're not
[2:41:31.680 --> 2:41:36.240]  compatible but if they are compatible with the free society they don't want them in that's one
[2:41:36.240 --> 2:41:42.400]  article i just spent two minutes on it but there's hundreds doctors told not to say expected mothers
[2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:51.360]  to avoid offending trainees because if you're at an o gbyn facility don't say to a pregnant woman hey
[2:41:51.360 --> 2:41:56.800]  you expected mothers that might hurt a tranny that's in the birthing facility see the whole world
[2:41:56.800 --> 2:42:01.840]  has to be about not offending some group this is just sabotage of civilization it has nothing to
[2:42:01.840 --> 2:42:08.400]  do with trainees that's like some type of grand faloon kurt vonnegut novel from 50 years ago about
[2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:19.440]  an insane society pregnant people is the preferred nomenclature because you can't have women and men
[2:42:19.440 --> 2:42:25.920]  because that's sexist to have sexes that's all in full words dot com from science executive order
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:31.520]  to slash regulations by two thirds i ran test ballistic missile and defiance of un resolution
[2:42:31.520 --> 2:42:37.600]  u.s official say why hollywood as we know it is already over that's right very fair and that's

[2:42:43.040 --> 2:42:48.160]  say with a turn towards the right no it'll be the glenn beck model where you say you're a conservative
[2:42:48.160 --> 2:42:53.280]  even you attack it all day like megan kelly and him so nbc wants to be the judas goat of
[2:42:53.280 --> 2:42:57.680]  conservatives because they can trick you better if they give you a few conservative stories
[2:42:57.680 --> 2:43:04.000]  with them manipulate you that's the new york post translation by alec shones with the old uh seahag

[2:44:03.040 --> 2:44:06.400]  not yeah it looks like a false flag done it we'll research it more
[2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:14.160]  freed pakistani bloggers go abroad for safety oh because you don't even have free speech at

[3:01:01.120 --> 3:01:04.400]  I want to host a little bit of the second the next with David and I'm going to get out of here but
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:08.960]  David um tell us what you got coming up in a minute but first David and I don't want to ask you this
[3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:14.720]  question man they really are all over the news calling for Trump to die and like salivating and
[3:01:14.720 --> 3:01:21.120]  having orgasms and dreams about how a coup is totally normal and really cool and and I look
[3:01:21.120 --> 3:01:26.320]  like this army of like really weak chicken-necked people who never actually even studied war calling
[3:01:26.320 --> 3:01:31.600]  for it but they're got sorrows backing it I mean I'm not somebody that's calling for them to all
[3:01:31.600 --> 3:01:35.360]  be arrested but if we were all organizing insurrection and overthrow and killing I mean we
[3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:39.040]  should be I mean I don't want to have a fight with these people I don't want to touch them
[3:01:39.040 --> 3:01:45.840]  but at the same time I mean they really are pushing for criminal activity and I don't get
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:50.880]  there I don't get their sense of confidence yeah alex you know it's like the difference
[3:01:50.880 --> 3:01:55.600]  between protests and riots and we have to draw that distinction and there was a back and forth
[3:01:55.600 --> 3:02:01.040]  going last week with Sean Spicer saying don't call the people with the pro-life march don't
[3:02:01.040 --> 3:02:04.560]  call them demonstrators well it's okay to call them demonstrators I mean that that's they call
[3:02:04.560 --> 3:02:09.280]  themselves demonstrators the problem is is when we call rioters demonstrators and they always
[3:02:09.280 --> 3:02:13.840]  play with the language that way so when you go out and you start criticizing somebody
[3:02:13.840 --> 3:02:18.880]  it's never been accepted to call for their murder and we're very careful not to do that
[3:02:18.880 --> 3:02:22.960]  when we disagree with people if the liberals would look at this they would understand that
[3:02:22.960 --> 3:02:28.400]  they've already gotten more from Barack from Donald Trump than we got from Barack Obama in
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:36.160]  eight years they want misery they want absolutely absolutely they don't want free market to deliver
[3:02:36.160 --> 3:02:40.960]  because they're just all they have this weird reflected glory off a big government they they
[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:46.400]  even though they're losers and don't get any of it they get off on it well it's simply partisan
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:50.000]  politics it's simply trying to make Trump look bad so they can make themselves look good look
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:54.480]  they don't want the TPP one of the first things he did was to to take down the TPP
[3:02:54.480 --> 3:02:59.840]  Barack Obama never did anything I agreed with in eight years and these people will not work with
[3:02:59.840 --> 3:03:05.920]  him on the issues like taking down NAFTA taking down TPP that they say that they want to deliver
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:10.160]  day nine now what do you make of Trump I mean he's just doing everything he said it's pretty
[3:03:10.160 --> 3:03:15.600]  amazing Alex because you know he's coming through with this stuff so quickly that it's difficult
[3:03:15.600 --> 3:03:19.840]  for both the people who support him and the people who oppose him to get down to all the details of
[3:03:19.840 --> 3:03:23.760]  what he's done we're gonna try to do a little bit more of that in this next hour but it is
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:27.920]  absolutely amazing the rapid pace that he's doing to the extent that some people have said
[3:03:27.920 --> 3:03:32.320]  maybe this is a tactic maybe he's doing this so quickly that they can't really hit him on one thing
[3:03:32.320 --> 3:03:36.320]  before he goes to another but I mean he's doing things really smart yeah like you know they've
[3:03:36.320 --> 3:03:44.560]  been pre-planning like oh Obama passed the law in 2013 had another order in 2010 doing exactly this
[3:03:44.560 --> 3:03:49.920]  so knowing he's only doing what's already been done I mean it's just really smart I'm impressed
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:54.960]  well also when we look at some of the other issues as this is starting to break over the
[3:03:54.960 --> 3:04:00.080]  weekend I think you talked to somebody they said hey what he needs to do is do something about this
[3:04:00.080 --> 3:04:05.920]  H1B visa program and really cut the legs out from underneath some of these people who are opposing him
[3:04:06.480 --> 3:04:10.160]  and of course that's one of the next things that he's going to be doing I mean he knows that he
[3:04:10.160 --> 3:04:15.040]  knows what he's doing we don't necessarily have to tell him what to do I mean it's great for everybody
[3:04:15.040 --> 3:04:22.400]  to get together yeah we're calling for stuff and then Trump does it it's we're on the same page
[3:04:22.400 --> 3:04:27.760]  yeah so Trump gets it he's that's why they're they're really freaked out absolutely yeah
[3:04:27.760 --> 3:04:32.400]  it's good to have a big grassroots push to support him and he has the capability and
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:35.840]  he's using capability to talk directly to the public instead of going through the media and
[3:04:35.840 --> 3:04:40.000]  having them filter it and so that that's been a great thing this last week but let's talk about
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:45.760]  when we come back how they're going to counter strike because they've seen crazed and they've
[3:04:45.760 --> 3:04:50.640]  got the weird confidence in their eyes they're planning some really crazy bad stuff and you
[3:04:50.640 --> 3:04:56.160]  know I just hope they don't push it too far and start a shooting war because I've never seen such
[3:04:56.160 --> 3:05:04.640]  giant sacks of weak pus boy did the travel ban get him going or what perhaps we really will see
[3:05:04.640 --> 3:05:08.720]  four years of Trump protests but why are they really protesting they never protested when
[3:05:08.720 --> 3:05:14.080]  obama made similar actions in 2011 against iraq refugees or in 2015 when he signed the visa
[3:05:14.080 --> 3:05:19.360]  waiver program and terrorist travel prevention act as part of his 2015 christmas gift omnibus
[3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:23.280]  spending bill which also created the list of countries that donald trump chose so why no
[3:05:23.280 --> 3:05:28.240]  protests then over obama but now over trump coverage and transparency see trump is transparent
[3:05:28.240 --> 3:05:31.920]  with the moves he is making and the media is always in attack mode against him while obama
[3:05:31.920 --> 3:05:36.160]  made his moves over holidays and the media ignored them the cnn's of the world over the weekend
[3:05:36.160 --> 3:05:40.800]  could be heard using this radical leftist double think trumps travel ban is islamic phobic and
[3:05:40.800 --> 3:05:45.840]  trumps travel ban will increase risk of islamic terror yes i am sure trumps non-fatal travel ban
[3:05:45.840 --> 3:05:50.160]  angered more people in that region than obama's fatal drones and bombs which if we get to the
[3:05:50.160 --> 3:05:54.560]  bottom of that would clear a lot of this up but the trump protesters made new signs and took to
[3:05:54.560 --> 3:06:00.000]  the streets again why coverage and transparency this is owens shroyer for info wars dot com

[3:08:34.400 --> 3:08:41.680]  you know it's really become a joke that they want to have open airplane flights from sudan
[3:08:42.720 --> 3:08:48.480]  and from samalia when within hours of people are being on the ground in those countries
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:52.800]  especially uh samalia you get kidnapped even if you're a white muslim
[3:08:55.600 --> 3:08:59.680]  and obama already had these in place he just wasn't enforcing them which is insane
[3:08:59.680 --> 3:09:05.680]  which is why we keep having samali stab people shoot people run them over and then the media just
[3:09:05.680 --> 3:09:11.040]  has this big giant pity party acting like trump's done all this horrible crap i mean it's crazy and
[3:09:11.040 --> 3:09:17.760]  then can we show it let's cue it up chuckie schumer crying chuck schumer supports israel
[3:09:17.760 --> 3:09:23.760]  having a big wall and he supported israeli's being armed which is fine with me but israel
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:29.520]  has all sorts of travel restrictions and so do most other countries again they play on americans
[3:09:29.520 --> 3:09:37.520]  ignorance and schumer starts crying i mean this has got to be the most pathetic clip of all time
[3:09:38.080 --> 3:09:45.520]  the guy is a horrible person involved covering up the clinton's crimes involved in globalism
[3:09:45.520 --> 3:09:51.840]  he wants your guns he wants obama care he's such a horrible person and trump has come out and said
[3:09:51.840 --> 3:09:57.840]  that you know he he needs a better acting coach that it's totally fake yeah let's let's go ahead
[3:09:57.840 --> 3:10:04.160]  and show first schumer and then let's show trump here it is this executive order
[3:10:04.160 --> 3:10:12.960]  was mean spirited
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:20.720]  on america now this is really bad acting it was implemented in a way that created chaos and
[3:10:20.720 --> 3:10:28.160]  confusion across the country and it will only serve to embolden and inspire those around the globe
[3:10:28.160 --> 3:10:34.960]  who will do us harm it might be reversed immediately so so they hold us hostage just
[3:10:34.960 --> 3:10:39.040]  like con's dad went on seeing this week and i shot a video and he goes you will close the
[3:10:39.040 --> 3:10:45.680]  tax you have done it you do not uh totally intolerant totally out of control threatening us
[3:10:46.240 --> 3:10:51.040]  so what do whatever you're gonna do feel your damn hand i am sick of being threatened by people
[3:10:51.040 --> 3:10:55.440]  watch your freaking mouth though because you shoot your mouth off and threaten people bad
[3:10:55.440 --> 3:11:00.960]  stuff's gonna happen i mean really i don't think you really it's realized the situation you're in
[3:11:01.920 --> 3:11:07.360]  you take our kindness for weakness you have no idea what you're messing around with let me just
[3:11:07.360 --> 3:11:13.040]  look at the west look at everything we've done we're ready to go crazy i've tried to oppose all
[3:11:13.040 --> 3:11:16.800]  these wars because they were setting this up now you think islam's gonna have its way with me and
[3:11:16.800 --> 3:11:25.120]  my family never never out live with that creature george soros now here's trump responding to schumer
[3:11:25.120 --> 3:11:30.560]  i mean schumer is a freaking joke why is trump even nice to him when schumer says he's not a
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:37.280]  real president all this crap here it is chuck schumer yesterday with fake tears i'm gonna ask him
[3:11:37.280 --> 3:11:44.880]  who is his acting coach because i know him very well i don't see him as a crier if he is he's
[3:11:44.880 --> 3:11:49.280]  a different man there's about a five percent chance that it was real but i think they were fake tears
[3:11:50.480 --> 3:11:53.840]  let me ask you this night i got a few other stories i swore to get to that's why i'm cutting
[3:11:53.840 --> 3:11:59.520]  into your time here uh this is surreal i keep using the word surreal twilight zone
[3:12:00.080 --> 3:12:04.000]  altered dimension matrix i mean the great things that are happening next to the bad things
[3:12:04.880 --> 3:12:11.200]  women with their tops off going a la oct bar i mean it's just i guess it's just mental illness
[3:12:11.200 --> 3:12:17.760]  it's people that have had freedom so long that in some type of mass stock home syndrome like a
[3:12:17.760 --> 3:12:23.760]  toddler throwing a fit they're begging for an alpha female or male to put them in their place
[3:12:23.760 --> 3:12:29.120]  yeah you know alex i i tweeted about uh chuckie schumer crying and when i started typing it on my
[3:12:29.120 --> 3:12:33.920]  phone it came up instead of chuckie came up tricky and i thought well that fits i left that there and
[3:12:33.920 --> 3:12:38.800]  i said keep on crying and then you really need to show us how sensitive you are and make keith
[3:12:38.800 --> 3:12:43.360]  ellison the new head of the dnc the guy who was the congressman who refused to take the oath to
[3:12:43.360 --> 3:12:48.560]  office on a bible said i'm going to only do it on the caran he is a radical islamist and go ahead
[3:12:48.560 --> 3:12:53.840]  and do that and we'll watch you lose another 1 000 seats in just the next four years instead of the
[3:12:53.840 --> 3:12:59.440]  last eight years and i hope they keep going down this path alex but it's like a mental illness yeah
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:03.760]  they lost almost a thousand seats in legislatures a little over yeah which is the really almost a
[3:13:03.760 --> 3:13:08.320]  thousand which was over a thousand nine hundred something and whatever it is that's great so in
[3:13:08.320 --> 3:13:13.360]  fact i hope that you're usually right guys google how many house seats or how many legislative seats
[3:13:13.360 --> 3:13:18.800]  were lost i think it was like a thousand thirty including gubernatorial uh seats and that sort
[3:13:18.800 --> 3:13:23.680]  of thing oh sure sure yeah i'm talking about legislator seats right and then yeah they lost like
[3:13:24.800 --> 3:13:28.960]  14 governors and a bunch of senate seats and a bunch of house seats you're right it's over a thousand
[3:13:28.960 --> 3:13:34.160]  total and the governors are way bigger than losing some house seats that's they they are just on the
[3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:39.280]  ropes they've never had uh less of a presence than they do now and it's going to continue to go down
[3:13:39.280 --> 3:13:42.880]  that road because you see what they're doing totally bet on race-based politics absolutely but what's
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:49.520]  killing them is minorities that want prosperity who fled tyranny are going no i'm not buying this
[3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:54.160]  it's blacks and hispanics voting and record numbers that trumped all this that's why we've
[3:13:54.160 --> 3:13:59.040]  got to deliver and anybody qualified's got to be hired we've got to just go out and get dinner
[3:13:59.040 --> 3:14:02.880]  together we've got to go you know go play basketball together we got to go hiking together
[3:14:02.880 --> 3:14:07.120]  we got to just really come together like martin Luther king said and reject all this race-based
[3:14:07.120 --> 3:14:13.040]  garbage david well you know alex a good example of this of course is starbucks the ceo has come
[3:14:13.040 --> 3:14:17.760]  out now said i'm gonna i'm gonna react against this unprecedented move and of course they've been
[3:14:17.760 --> 3:14:23.360]  saying all day today this is not unprecedented jimmy carter did it we had obama do it we had
[3:14:23.360 --> 3:14:30.320]  jimmy carter did a total ban that's right let me add this what about how biden wanted vietnamese
[3:14:30.320 --> 3:14:35.120]  ban because they were conservatives that's right that's an info war yeah and then now the the cubans
[3:14:35.120 --> 3:14:39.760]  have been totally banned by obama so they're having to go to mexico who deport some see i don't care
[3:14:39.760 --> 3:14:44.480]  what color somebody is a right wing vietnamese is super hard working statistically great person
[3:14:44.480 --> 3:14:48.720]  you can trust same thing with a right wing cuban it's not about skin color is it david it's about
[3:14:48.720 --> 3:14:53.360]  their ideology it is ideological alex and as i was pointing out on friday when i talked about
[3:14:53.360 --> 3:14:58.800]  these mexican government officials last tuesday before any of this back and forth happened between
[3:14:58.800 --> 3:15:03.920]  the mexican president and donald trump uh they were talking about this is a former ambassador to
[3:15:03.920 --> 3:15:09.120]  united states a foreign former minister of mexico they were saying hey uh we're gonna see if that
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:14.080]  wall that uh donald trump puts up keeps out the terrorists and the drug cartels because we won't
[3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:18.880]  and they said we you know quoting ron emmanuel say we're not going to let a crisis go to waste
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:22.720]  the title of the article from the new york times because they were working with these globalists
[3:15:22.720 --> 3:15:28.320]  that's the issue there it's not uh americans versus mexicans or anglos versus mexicans it's a
[3:15:28.320 --> 3:15:33.920]  globalist versus a nationalist and that's what these mexican officials are and they were saying
[3:15:33.920 --> 3:15:39.200]  what weapons can we use against donald trump if he goes to war with us over nafta so if you
[3:15:39.200 --> 3:15:44.320]  get out of this globalist uh structure here we're going to use weapons like sending terrorists
[3:15:44.320 --> 3:15:47.600]  across the border we're going to aid them and of course they are doing that already
[3:15:47.600 --> 3:15:51.040]  they're doing that already with the immigrants who are coming in with uh no they are i mean i don't

[3:24:16.960 --> 3:24:20.720]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night and we're going to talk a little bit about the
[3:24:20.720 --> 3:24:25.760]  hypocrisy that we see of these silicon valley billionaires and others and i would include
[3:24:25.760 --> 3:24:32.000]  starbucks as part of that because they really do uh market towards uh they're not silicon valley but
[3:24:32.880 --> 3:24:39.040]  the same type of mindset that we see from these multinational corporations and remember that
[3:24:39.040 --> 3:24:44.480]  it was angela merkel who this last weekend called out starbucks over their unfair practices
[3:24:44.480 --> 3:24:50.000]  she said unfair tax advantages for multinational corporations uh or thanks she was talking to
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:54.160]  the german people about and she singled out starbucks as the example she said many companies
[3:24:54.160 --> 3:24:59.760]  have managed to pay taxes nowhere in the world she said coffee house operators from germany
[3:24:59.760 --> 3:25:04.320]  have to pay their taxes while it's not at all clear with starbucks whether they pay taxes
[3:25:04.880 --> 3:25:11.280]  anywhere anywhere see it's a shell game that's what they do that's what these multinational
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:16.560]  corporations do that's why include them in with silicon valley and yet at the same time we have
[3:25:16.560 --> 3:25:22.560]  the ceo of starbucks howard schultz sending a letter to his employees and say i write to you
[3:25:22.560 --> 3:25:27.440]  today with deep concern with a heavy heart with a resolute promise let me begin with the news that
[3:25:27.440 --> 3:25:31.280]  is immediately in front of us we've all been witness to the confusion the surprise and the
[3:25:31.280 --> 3:25:36.240]  opposition to the executive order from president trump and so forth okay and he says we're living
[3:25:36.240 --> 3:25:40.880]  in an unprecedented time where we're witness to the conscience of our country and the promise
[3:25:40.880 --> 3:25:48.320]  of the american dream being called into question we know what people like starbucks ceo have been
[3:25:48.320 --> 3:25:52.560]  calling into question the american dream for a long time and let me tell you that part of the
[3:25:52.560 --> 3:25:57.600]  american dream has always been what owning your own home that was the core part of the american dream
[3:25:58.560 --> 3:26:03.440]  owning your own home starting your own business but washington has regulated the starting your own
[3:26:03.440 --> 3:26:08.320]  business aspect of it pretty much to death and that's what donald trump pushed back against
[3:26:08.320 --> 3:26:11.600]  today we're going to talk about that a little bit but i want to talk about the american dream of
[3:26:11.600 --> 3:26:18.640]  owning a home if people can come here at will from anywhere in the world and we have to educate
[3:26:18.640 --> 3:26:24.960]  their children for free at our expense paid for by our property taxes and the language of their
[3:26:24.960 --> 3:26:29.680]  choice do you think you can own your home do you think that you're going to lose that american
[3:26:29.680 --> 3:26:35.760]  dream because of dreamers coming here demanding benefits from you and of course there's a back
[3:26:35.760 --> 3:26:40.160]  and forth so there's a vision going on right now a debate within the trump administration
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:45.520]  there's an article from reuters saying trump aides are divided over the policies of shielding dreamer
[3:26:46.160 --> 3:26:51.360]  immigrants and i have to say i hope that the people who are saying we're not going to
[3:26:51.360 --> 3:26:57.200]  shield them went out because i'm quite frankly sick and tired of seeing the american dream
[3:26:57.200 --> 3:27:01.840]  only being a dream that people who are foreign citizens in other countries who decide that
[3:27:01.840 --> 3:27:07.280]  they would rather live in our country that's the only dream that matters people who live here people
[3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:13.040]  whose uh families have created this country people who have paid taxes all their life our
[3:27:13.040 --> 3:27:18.320]  dreams don't matter we need to take a back seat and the bus to these people that they're bringing
[3:27:18.320 --> 3:27:25.040]  in here you understand what this is this is a people replacement program it is ideologically
[3:27:25.040 --> 3:27:30.080]  based and uh we understand exactly what this is and we ought to shut this down these people who
[3:27:30.080 --> 3:27:37.040]  are dreamers of course that are getting preferred treatment that's up to the age of 31 31 so let's
[3:27:37.040 --> 3:27:42.240]  understand what's going to happen with that so uh you got this guy who pays taxes nowhere and now he
[3:27:42.240 --> 3:27:47.280]  says he's going to bring in uh and hire 10 000 refugees for starbucks over the next five years
[3:27:47.280 --> 3:27:51.200]  you know what i'm done i'm not going to buy anything from starbucks not even the little
[3:27:51.200 --> 3:27:54.960]  stuff that they saw in the grocery store that's been my only involvement with them for quite
[3:27:54.960 --> 3:27:59.440]  some time because of other things that corporation has done i'm i just like when i saw this article
[3:27:59.440 --> 3:28:04.880]  i called my wife and i said don't ever buy that stuff from the grocery store again uh we're not
[3:28:04.880 --> 3:28:10.640]  going to send a penny to starbucks and i think people need to start supporting local businesses
[3:28:10.640 --> 3:28:14.240]  you know what we don't need multinational corporations and we don't need multinational
[3:28:14.240 --> 3:28:20.080]  workforces either shove down our throats we can do just fine here in america one of the things that
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:25.280]  donald trump did today of course was he saved announced the savings of 600 million dollars
[3:28:25.280 --> 3:28:32.640]  from the f-35 program that's over the next lot of 90 joint strike fighter planes
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:36.960]  see that's the kind of stuff that you ought to see the democrats applauding him for right
[3:28:37.520 --> 3:28:42.800]  look at this he saved some money on these pentagon programs that they're always complaining about
[3:28:42.800 --> 3:28:47.280]  and they should but they don't give him credit just like they don't give him credit for shutting
[3:28:47.280 --> 3:28:53.600]  down after for shutting down the tpp even though their base wants that and of course that's all
[3:28:53.600 --> 3:28:58.560]  politics they don't want to lose their base to donald trump but guess what they've already lost
[3:28:58.560 --> 3:29:03.440]  their base to donald trump and they're going further into it they absolutely have nothing but
[3:29:03.440 --> 3:29:08.720]  contempt for the working class americans and you can see it in west virginia it's interesting to
[3:29:08.720 --> 3:29:14.640]  watch on cnn how joe manchin the senator from west virginia dances around when he gets on cnn
[3:29:14.640 --> 3:29:20.560]  they try to get him to criticize donald trump and he walks on eggshells why because the west
[3:29:20.560 --> 3:29:26.160]  virginians have been at the forefront of the globalist shills like hillary clinton and barack
[3:29:26.160 --> 3:29:31.040]  obama promising to bankrupt them promising to take their jobs and making good on that promise
[3:29:31.040 --> 3:29:36.240]  that's one promise that they did make good on but donald trump is making a good on a lot of promises
[3:29:36.240 --> 3:29:42.000]  we're going to take a look at bill clinton and his speech saying that he was going to do exactly
[3:29:42.000 --> 3:29:46.320]  what donald trump did this last week they won't talk about this being unprecedented no it's not
[3:29:46.320 --> 3:29:50.640]  and we're also going to talk about what's coming up tomorrow it's going to be a supreme court pick
[3:29:50.640 --> 3:29:57.520]  from donald trump the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:01.520 --> 3:30:07.520]  new video on info wars dot com leftist mob chases down trump supporters beat and taunt them inside
[3:30:07.520 --> 3:30:12.240]  of portland international airport again the anti-trump people are proven to be the most wicked

[3:30:22.720 --> 3:30:27.360]  humped in the street and overall viewed as a foul person whose opinion should be silent and when i
[3:30:27.360 --> 3:30:32.240]  asked for their opinions or why they were protesting i got nothing productive i went to the march for
[3:30:32.240 --> 3:30:37.680]  life in austin wearing my make america great again gear and i experienced zero negativity for what i
[3:30:37.680 --> 3:30:42.240]  was wearing or my identity as a white male when i put the marchers and their signs on camera they
[3:30:42.240 --> 3:30:47.520]  spoke eloquently and had no issue sharing their opinions without insulting me or using foul language
[3:30:47.520 --> 3:30:52.240]  for those that think trump supporters are the intolerant ones i challenge you to take to the
[3:30:52.240 --> 3:30:57.120]  streets with make america great again gear on you will experience more hate than you ever have in

[3:31:30.080 --> 3:31:35.840]  your air the elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[3:31:35.840 --> 3:31:42.080]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves the general public doesn't the elects of pure breeze
[3:31:42.080 --> 3:31:46.320]  would be a steal at three hundred four hundred five hundred dollars one of these systems can keep
[3:31:46.320 --> 3:31:50.480]  eight hundred square feet incredibly clean this is a system i'm personally putting in throughout
[3:31:50.480 --> 3:31:56.000]  my house replacing older more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this
[3:31:56.000 --> 3:32:04.400]  system is so revolutionary today info wars store dot com national defense labs and citizen armor
[3:32:04.400 --> 3:32:11.440]  has given info wars the exclusive on distributing to the american people the true next generation
[3:32:11.440 --> 3:32:18.240]  in body armor basically what we're bringing to the info wars team is a new line of dynamic
[3:32:18.240 --> 3:32:24.240]  lightweight body armor it is lighter more flexible easier to wear more comfortable and
[3:32:24.240 --> 3:32:27.840]  stronger than anything else on the market you said when you talk to people that have been
[3:32:27.840 --> 3:32:31.600]  using this actually testing for years people that currently attested for us they didn't just say
[3:32:31.600 --> 3:32:35.680]  outstanding what they really say about them they want to know how do they get it where do they find
[3:32:35.680 --> 3:32:41.360]  it a lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing the backpack body armor

[3:32:57.200 --> 3:33:08.480]  go check out all their different products the forester dot com it's amazing
[3:33:08.480 --> 3:33:22.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover up you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[3:33:23.200 --> 3:33:27.920]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[3:33:30.560 --> 3:33:34.320]  welcome i do the alex jones show i'm david night we're gonna take a look at something that's really
[3:33:34.320 --> 3:33:39.440]  going to get the left and silicon valley upset that's coming up that's going to be trump's move
[3:33:39.440 --> 3:33:46.320]  against the h1b visa program the abuses within that look we understand that we need to have people like
[3:33:47.440 --> 3:33:51.680]  einstein be able to come into the country we need people like albert einstein but you know what
[3:33:51.680 --> 3:33:56.320]  there's not that many albert einstein's need to come into the country and of course you remember
[3:33:56.320 --> 3:34:03.280]  how the h1b visa program has been abused or programs like it there's a slightly slight variation on
[3:34:03.280 --> 3:34:08.160]  that for the service industry and we've all seen that story about what Walt disney world did to the
[3:34:08.720 --> 3:34:13.760]  information workers they are telling them that they're going to have to train their replacements
[3:34:13.760 --> 3:34:17.920]  who are coming in from india we're going to work at a fraction of the price and then they're going
[3:34:17.920 --> 3:34:24.000]  to be let go that needs to stop that really needs to stop and i have to say that even when it comes
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:31.680]  to engineering when it comes to stem you don't have to have as many people as we've got coming in
[3:34:31.680 --> 3:34:34.560]  there's people in this country that can do it especially if you want to get more american
[3:34:34.560 --> 3:34:40.800]  engineers get rid of common core in the school how about that that's the thing that's turning
[3:34:40.800 --> 3:34:45.360]  people off from math you know almost didn't get into engineering myself because i hated the new
[3:34:45.360 --> 3:34:51.120]  math and it wasn't nearly as bad as common core is today it's designed to make people
[3:34:51.120 --> 3:34:55.920]  blithering idiots not only in illiterate but enumerate as well that's what common core is
[3:34:55.920 --> 3:35:00.720]  designed to do you know the way i got through engineering when i didn't i didn't take these
[3:35:00.720 --> 3:35:11.360]  classes early on i found a trig book from the naval academy in the 1950s and it was loaded with very
[3:35:11.360 --> 3:35:16.480]  interesting problems to solve and using real trigonometry spherical trigonometry that's how
[3:35:16.480 --> 3:35:21.920]  i got through that got that got me started on a calculus everything when i i was absolutely
[3:35:21.920 --> 3:35:27.760]  did not want to go near a math book until i found that and so parents if you're teaching your kids
[3:35:27.760 --> 3:35:34.240]  pay attention to their curriculum get some stuff that's real for them that makes it all real that
[3:35:34.240 --> 3:35:39.360]  brings it to home that's the key thing we don't need to bring people in from other countries
[3:35:39.360 --> 3:35:45.760]  if we don't turn them off from education in our own country remember that education is not filling
[3:35:45.760 --> 3:35:49.440]  a bucket but it's lighting a fire and the way that you do that is to make this stuff relevant to
[3:35:49.440 --> 3:35:54.640]  people and that's the biggest problem that we've got here but of course we've seen a lot of abuses
[3:35:54.640 --> 3:36:01.520]  with h1b visas and trump is going to be moving on that they've already drafted an executive order
[3:36:01.520 --> 3:36:07.120]  aimed at overhauling the work visa program and of course they come in and say as part of this
[3:36:07.120 --> 3:36:12.480]  article from bloomberg they say the top recipients of the h1b visas are outsourcers primarily from
[3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:16.560]  india who run the technology department's the large corporations with largely imported staff
[3:36:17.200 --> 3:36:21.760]  and we've seen how that works at disney haven't we so we don't need to have more of that we don't
[3:36:21.760 --> 3:36:26.960]  need to have 10 000 refugees hired by starbucks in the next five years there's plenty of people
[3:36:26.960 --> 3:36:31.840]  who would be working willing to work who are americans who would work at starbucks who would
[3:36:31.840 --> 3:36:38.560]  work at disney it isn't like americans don't want jobs we've seen that our our younger generation
[3:36:38.560 --> 3:36:44.960]  the millennials have gone through a situation where they don't know what it's like to have
[3:36:44.960 --> 3:36:50.720]  early work experience there's a lot to be learned from menial jobs you weren't meant to stay in low
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:55.200]  wage jobs all your life so i don't want to be labor that i want to get to uh the clinton

[3:38:14.160 --> 3:38:23.040]  carter banning iranians freezing their assets let's play this clip from bill clinton uh talking
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:30.320]  about his plan to deport illegals here's bill clinton all americans not only in the states most
[3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:34.720]  heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large
[3:38:34.720 --> 3:38:41.280]  numbers of illegal aliens entering our country the jobs they hold might otherwise be held by
[3:38:41.280 --> 3:38:45.600]  citizens or legal immigrants what would you say public service they use imposed burdens on our
[3:38:45.600 --> 3:38:51.280]  taxpayers yeah that's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more
[3:38:51.280 --> 3:38:56.320]  by hiring a record number of new border guards by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever
[3:38:56.320 --> 3:39:03.040]  before by cracking down on illegal hiring by borrowing welfare benefits to illegal aliens
[3:39:03.040 --> 3:39:08.160]  in the budget i will present to you we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal
[3:39:08.160 --> 3:39:13.280]  aliens who are arrested for crimes to better identify illegal aliens in the work face as
[3:39:13.280 --> 3:39:18.960]  recommended by the commission headed by former congresswoman barba jordan we are a nation of
[3:39:18.960 --> 3:39:25.440]  immigrants but we are also a nation of laws it is wrong and ultimately self-defeating
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:30.080]  for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws
[3:39:30.080 --> 3:39:38.080]  we have seen in recent years and we must do more to stop it and the democrats will applaud
[3:39:39.120 --> 3:39:44.080]  because he's a democrat because it's who said that did you hear that he said we have
[3:39:44.080 --> 3:39:48.560]  a nation of law they they can't even bring themselves to call foreign citizens who are
[3:39:48.560 --> 3:39:53.280]  here in defiance of our laws they can't even bring themselves to say that they're here illegally
[3:39:53.280 --> 3:39:57.440]  anymore they're just simply undocumented and we're going to work on those documentations
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:40:02.000]  and make sure that they're going to stay that was bill clinton and of course we've played
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:08.240]  jimmy carter and of course we've talked today about how barack obama in december 2015 signed
[3:40:08.240 --> 3:40:15.040]  the visa waiver program improvement and terrorist travel prevention act the terrorist travel
[3:40:15.040 --> 3:40:23.280]  prevention act you see if you bring in if you bring in a million immigrants from an area where
[3:40:23.280 --> 3:40:29.680]  there is a lot of terrorist activity samalia is a good example we bring in those people and what
[3:40:29.680 --> 3:40:35.600]  if you got 99 percent of them well that's 10 000 terrorists that would come in with that one percent
[3:40:35.600 --> 3:40:39.680]  so let's say 99 percent of them are just fine but one percent of them are terrorists you just
[3:40:39.680 --> 3:40:46.160]  brought in 10 000 terrorists what if 99.9 percent of them are okay well you just brought in a thousand
[3:40:46.160 --> 3:40:52.400]  terrorists and so forth okay how many do you need to have a terrorist event you know one of the things
[3:40:52.400 --> 3:40:58.160]  that i tweeted out over the weekend when this was going on but i said oh okay seven nations is
[3:40:58.160 --> 3:41:04.160]  equivalent to a muslim ban no not at all but let's let's point out uh let's take a look at a few
[3:41:04.160 --> 3:41:10.880]  cities here okay let's look at seven cities in just the last year in just europe predominantly
[3:41:10.880 --> 3:41:19.680]  germany and france you had a brussels bombing you had a truck attack and niece you had a stabbing
[3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:25.040]  in munich you had another truck attack in berlin the christmas market you had another bombing in
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:29.840]  ansbach you had another stabbing in normandy and that's not even counting the two big shootings
[3:41:29.840 --> 3:41:36.480]  in paris that happened a little over a year ago we can't take a look at that so they talk about
[3:41:36.480 --> 3:41:43.360]  this is i i've heard this liberal meme how many people if this is statistically insignificant
[3:41:43.360 --> 3:41:52.560]  well it is not insignificant if you're one of the 80 some odd people who's run down by a truck
[3:41:52.560 --> 3:41:58.080]  and niece or if you're their family it is not stings statistically so insignificant for those
[3:41:58.080 --> 3:42:04.720]  families for those victims of those terrorist attacks and what are we doing to vet it as i
[3:42:04.720 --> 3:42:09.760]  pointed out on friday as alex pointed out earlier today we the united nations is doing the vetting
[3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:14.880]  and sending these people in on friday i talked about the fact that there was uh just under two
[3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:20.320]  thousand people had been sent in by the united nations they declared that they were refugees
[3:42:20.320 --> 3:42:24.880]  and they sent them into our country they determined who was going to come into our country during the
[3:42:24.880 --> 3:42:30.640]  one week that donald trump had been president just under two thousand came in before he
[3:42:31.440 --> 3:42:37.360]  enacted this order people were saying we've got to stop this right why doesn't he do something
[3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:41.920]  and he did something about that later that day later on friday and then of course they freak out
[3:42:41.920 --> 3:42:46.080]  as if this is something that had never happened before the story that we have on info wars dot
[3:42:46.080 --> 3:42:50.160]  com where they talk about the south vietnamese refugees that were pushed back that were opposed
[3:42:50.160 --> 3:42:55.600]  by joe biden they were opposed by jerry brown and of course what jerry brown said at the time he said
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:43:02.240]  there's something strange about saying let's bring in 500 000 when we can't take care of one million
[3:43:02.240 --> 3:43:10.240]  unemployed in california that's what jerry brown said at the time but if we say that we're racist
[3:43:10.240 --> 3:43:17.200]  we're xenophobic but he can say that and they oppose it at the time and again as alex pointed
[3:43:17.200 --> 3:43:22.320]  out it is largely political they don't want the conservative vietnamese coming in they don't want
[3:43:22.320 --> 3:43:27.280]  the conservative cubans coming in they want people that are going to come in that are going to be
[3:43:27.280 --> 3:43:32.800]  democrat voters and so that's a big part of it but remember that it was not once but twice that
[3:43:32.800 --> 3:43:39.840]  obama did this he signed the terrorist travel prevention act in december of 2015 he restricted
[3:43:39.840 --> 3:43:48.720]  access to citizens from 38 countries and then they also enacted restrictions on iran syria
[3:43:48.720 --> 3:43:55.280]  sudan iraq then in february of 2016 not even a year ago what a short memory these people have
[3:43:55.280 --> 3:44:00.080]  the obama administration added libya samalia and yemen to the list of countries one could
[3:44:00.080 --> 3:44:05.200]  not have visited but still allowed dual citizens of those countries to come in but dual citizens
[3:44:05.200 --> 3:44:12.400]  of syria sudan iraq iran were still ineligible trump was barring immigration from that same
[3:44:12.400 --> 3:44:19.440]  list of countries and then in a separate incident obama and the clinton state department took a
[3:44:19.440 --> 3:44:27.440]  six-month hiatus from processing iraqi refugees in 2011 so you understand that twice from obama
[3:44:27.440 --> 3:44:35.280]  december of 2015 then he increased the list in february of 2016 and then obama and hillary
[3:44:35.280 --> 3:44:42.560]  back in 2011 blocked people coming in from iraqi did anybody uh say that uh they were racist
[3:44:42.560 --> 3:44:48.560]  xenophobic that it was a muslim ban no they didn't do that and i gotta say when we talk about
[3:44:48.560 --> 3:44:55.360]  samalia i have a personal anecdote here of a missionary that i i knew uh who had told me
[3:44:55.360 --> 3:44:59.760]  at the time that he was in samalia just before the events that are recorded in blackhawk down
[3:45:00.320 --> 3:45:07.520]  and he said it was unbelievably violent he said even as a missionary you never went anywhere
[3:45:07.520 --> 3:45:15.440]  without an ak-47 and uh he was not there to wage war on anybody he was there to try to protect
[3:45:15.440 --> 3:45:20.160]  other people and of course protect himself so he could protect other people but you didn't go
[3:45:20.160 --> 3:45:25.440]  anywhere in that country without an ak-47 so what do we do we bring in people from the most
[3:45:25.440 --> 3:45:31.920]  violent areas i just and again before i get off of this and get onto some other news when i look
[3:45:31.920 --> 3:45:39.680]  at this and we have these nations that barack obama is bombing but then he wants to bring the
[3:45:39.680 --> 3:45:47.040]  people in at the same time and so you have to say well if these nations have so many bad people
[3:45:47.040 --> 3:45:54.480]  in them that we need to bomb them why are we bringing the people in do you see that conflict
[3:45:54.480 --> 3:46:01.200]  that cognitive dissonance there that at the same time we're supposed to embrace all these people
[3:46:01.200 --> 3:46:06.560]  and bring as many of them in as wish to come and we have no way to vet them uh they're dangerous
[3:46:06.560 --> 3:46:10.800]  enough that we need to bomb them and i have to say that you need to stop one or the other maybe
[3:46:10.800 --> 3:46:15.760]  we should stop both of them maybe we stop the bombing and we let the people live their lives
[3:46:15.760 --> 3:46:20.960]  in their countries and send them some aid to help them for what we did i think we bear some
[3:46:20.960 --> 3:46:26.080]  responsibility for that i'm not in general uh supportive of foreign aid because i believe
[3:46:26.080 --> 3:46:31.280]  that it makes dependence uh it makes people dependent upon us just like i don't support a
[3:46:31.280 --> 3:46:37.120]  universal basic income from americans i don't support that type of welfare always destroys people
[3:46:37.120 --> 3:46:43.200]  but in a situation where you go in and you because you wanted regime change start bombing and
[3:46:43.200 --> 3:46:50.000]  destroying people's lives and unleashing drone attacks on them creating a civil war using isis
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:46:54.880]  and al-qaeda as your surrogates i think that you do owe something to those people the first thing you
[3:46:54.880 --> 3:47:02.400]  owe them is to stop doing it why don't the liberals focus on that why don't the people who are screaming
[3:47:02.400 --> 3:47:08.960]  about donald trump not bringing in refugees from the places that were why don't they focus on stopping
[3:47:08.960 --> 3:47:16.320]  the war what does it matter with you people it used to be the left and like war now they embrace it
[3:47:16.320 --> 3:47:22.560]  now they cheer it now they want a cold war with russia now they want regime change in syria now
[3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:27.280]  they criticize people like tulsi gabard who goes to syria and meets with the other side
[3:47:28.320 --> 3:47:32.720]  she goes back and she says there's no moderate rebels over there absolutely she's telling the
[3:47:32.720 --> 3:47:39.600]  truth and the liberals are furious at her don't say that we want a war and of course if you don't
[3:47:39.600 --> 3:47:46.720]  want a war you're a russian agent this is the insanity that has become the left the very first
[3:47:46.720 --> 3:47:51.680]  thing that all of these liberals ought to be talking about is stopping the war stopping the
[3:47:51.680 --> 3:47:58.160]  killing i am so sick and tired of liberals posting the picture of the aleppo boy you realize
[3:47:59.040 --> 3:48:04.400]  who started the war it's us why don't you focus on stopping the war instead of bringing all of
[3:48:04.400 --> 3:48:09.600]  these surviving children into the united states when did you just stop it it's absolutely amazing
[3:48:09.600 --> 3:48:14.480]  and when alex said uh you know what what is what is going to come with this uh what what is the real
[3:48:14.480 --> 3:48:19.440]  concern of course the real concern and donald trump said it that really outraged them he said i think
[3:48:19.440 --> 3:48:23.680]  john mccain and lizzie graham are trying to start world war three yes of course they are
[3:48:24.560 --> 3:48:29.520]  we've been telling you that for a long time we've been telling you that they are aiding a betting
[3:48:29.520 --> 3:48:36.400]  creating funding training everything else isis and al-qaeda uh they called them the mujahideen
[3:48:36.400 --> 3:48:41.120]  back when it was done by ronald reagan we understand what this has been going on for decades it's not
[3:48:41.120 --> 3:48:45.920]  anything new they were trying to get us to act as al-qaeda's air force in syria and we wouldn't
[3:48:45.920 --> 3:48:51.680]  have it we stopped that and for wars is a big part of that and so when we look at what they're
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:56.880]  trying to do even michael gorbachev has said it looks like we're gearing up for world war
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:02.880]  of course his solution was to have the united nations come in and impose a peace on people
[3:49:02.880 --> 3:49:07.520]  no that's not the solution and of course he's a big government status but he doesn't want to
[3:49:07.520 --> 3:49:13.200]  see this happen because it's the russian people who know what it's like to be at war more so than
[3:49:13.200 --> 3:49:18.720]  american people american people have become very soft very distant they haven't had a war
[3:49:18.720 --> 3:49:26.880]  on their soil for a very long time we fortunately did not have during world war two much bloodshed
[3:49:26.880 --> 3:49:33.840]  on american soil outside of pearl harbor but the russians had it in spades that's why they are so
[3:49:33.840 --> 3:49:40.080]  excited about the fact that we can have a de-escalation of tensions and i just quite frankly don't
[3:49:40.080 --> 3:49:47.280]  understand why the liberals and it just goes to show how dishonest they are and how controlled
[3:49:47.280 --> 3:49:54.800]  they are by george soros that's the that's the true issue here they become mindless puppets of
[3:49:54.800 --> 3:50:01.600]  george soros who wants to set the world on fire so it doesn't even occur to them to try to stop the
[3:50:01.600 --> 3:50:06.880]  wars no we just need to keep bombing them and bringing the refugees into america how do you
[3:50:06.880 --> 3:50:12.400]  how do you get past that meanwhile in more hypocrisy we see this story it just keeps escalating
[3:50:12.400 --> 3:50:18.960]  with mark zuckerberg and the hawaiians he goes and he buys spends a hundred million dollars to get
[3:50:18.960 --> 3:50:24.880]  700 acres of beachfront land in hawaii and then he decides that he's going to lock out the hawaiians
[3:50:24.880 --> 3:50:33.040]  who have a legacy of these of land there they have an act going back to 1850 which allows native
[3:50:33.040 --> 3:50:38.880]  people to own the land they once lived on and so they've got not only a wall but he's using
[3:50:38.880 --> 3:50:44.880]  his armed guards and security people to intimidate them they said they told me i was on private
[3:50:44.880 --> 3:50:48.160]  property threatening to take my picture they were threatening to arrest me they were aggressive
[3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:54.160]  they were rude they were disrespectful these are the multinational globalists who want to own
[3:50:54.160 --> 3:50:58.880]  everything just like he wants to own all the hawaiian beaches stay with us we'll be right back

[3:54:25.760 --> 3:54:29.840]  first 10 days of donald trump we're also going to take a look at some of the actions that are
[3:54:29.840 --> 3:54:32.800]  going to be coming up in the next couple of days of course tomorrow we're going to find out
[3:54:33.600 --> 3:54:38.560]  trump's supreme court nominee and the democrats have already announced that they're going to oppose
[3:54:38.560 --> 3:54:43.840]  whoever it is regardless uh they don't even know who it is but they're just going to oppose them
[3:54:43.840 --> 3:54:48.080]  because just as we've seen them oppose donald trump even though he does exactly what they
[3:54:48.080 --> 3:54:54.560]  would like to have happen on tpp on reducing pentagon spending and so forth now today what he
[3:54:54.560 --> 3:54:58.960]  did was he came out and he did announced regulatory cuts and this is something that he had said he
[3:54:58.960 --> 3:55:06.240]  was going to do but he signed it uh into law here today with executive order he has uh put restrictions
[3:55:06.240 --> 3:55:10.560]  on the amount of new regulations it's one of the first things that he did but uh today he said
[3:55:11.360 --> 3:55:16.960]  he's going to continue to try to cut the regulations by 75 he said the american dream is back this
[3:55:16.960 --> 3:55:22.160]  isn't a knock on president obama this is a knock on many presidents proceeding me he said regulation
[3:55:22.160 --> 3:55:27.920]  has been horrible for big business but it has been worse for small business is especially been
[3:55:27.920 --> 3:55:32.720]  critical of the dod frank wall street reform law calling it a disaster he said we're going to be
[3:55:32.720 --> 3:55:40.160]  doing a big number on dod frank and of course it is dod frank is very it's a good example of a lot
[3:55:40.160 --> 3:55:45.120]  of this regulation it's very cumbersome very expensive to comply with nobody can really afford
[3:55:45.120 --> 3:55:49.760]  to comply with it except the largest companies and even for them it's a big hit on their bottom line
[3:55:50.400 --> 3:55:55.360]  but they're willing to take it and in most cases they're the ones who are pushing for it it's big
[3:55:55.360 --> 3:56:01.440]  business who pushes for these regulations because what dod frank does is it drives small and medium
[3:56:01.440 --> 3:56:09.280]  sized banks out of certain markets causes in many cases causes them to shut down so the big business
[3:56:09.280 --> 3:56:14.480]  can take the hit on the regulations for a while until their competition is driven out of business
[3:56:14.480 --> 3:56:20.400]  and then they move in and then they get the the congress to take those regulations off of them
[3:56:20.400 --> 3:56:27.040]  that has been a recurring mo of these usual suspects we see this happening all the time
[3:56:27.040 --> 3:56:30.720]  donald trump is on to that game he's seen it played i mean you don't have to be a big business
[3:56:30.720 --> 3:56:34.880]  man to see that and these small business man can see that quite frankly when you look at the way
[3:56:34.880 --> 3:56:39.200]  these regulations are set up it's not just banks they do the same thing with restaurants they do
[3:56:39.200 --> 3:56:45.200]  the same thing with pretty much every business you have the large players come in put in onerous
[3:56:45.200 --> 3:56:49.600]  regulations saying we want to protect the market we want to make sure that we don't have people coming
[3:56:49.600 --> 3:56:54.720]  in and destroying this market because they don't do a good job of regulating themselves when really
[3:56:54.720 --> 3:57:01.440]  what they're doing is just so sewing off the bottom rungs of the ladder but of course one of
[3:57:01.440 --> 3:57:07.520]  the big organizations that is on the chopping block is the epa as i mentioned on friday
[3:57:08.160 --> 3:57:14.480]  trump wants to slash the epa is eight billion dollar budget and it's 15 000 strong workforce
[3:57:14.480 --> 3:57:19.760]  one of the people who is in charge of the transition force for donald trump said that he
[3:57:19.760 --> 3:57:25.360]  would like to see this cut in half and you know when we look at this what it reminds me of is the
[3:57:25.360 --> 3:57:31.280]  declaration of independence written by thomas jefferson where he said the king had created swarms
[3:57:31.280 --> 3:57:36.640]  of officers to harass our people and to eat out their substance and that is what this bureaucracy
[3:57:36.640 --> 3:57:42.480]  is and the epa is a perfect example of an organization that went way beyond their brief
[3:57:43.120 --> 3:57:49.120]  and has become nothing but an empire builder and so you see democrats coming out people
[3:57:49.120 --> 3:57:54.240]  like bernie sanders and love and others saying there is a culture of fear being created in the
[3:57:54.240 --> 3:58:00.960]  washington dc bureaucracy to which i say great great because when the people fear the government
[3:58:00.960 --> 3:58:06.000]  there's tyranny when the government fears the people there is freedom there's liberty and of
[3:58:06.000 --> 3:58:10.480]  course it goes back to what donald trump said on the very first day their victories their successes
[3:58:10.480 --> 3:58:16.080]  have not been yours and we've had a predatory bureaucracy that has fed off of us long enough
[3:58:16.080 --> 3:58:20.400]  and now we're seeing massive moves made in that direction by donald trump we're going to talk more
[3:58:20.400 --> 3:58:24.880]  about this tonight we're also going to talk about something else we haven't talked about and that is
[3:58:24.880 --> 3:58:31.040]  the spy act what is that about join us tonight for the info wars nightly news seven central eight
[3:58:31.040 --> 3:58:46.960]  p.m. eastern
