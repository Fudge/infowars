[09:51.800 --> 09:57.800]  television in front of everyone on record Afghanistan 10 years ago went from

[10:27.800 --> 10:33.880]  true but they must be shown it in their face again so when the troops start
[10:33.880 --> 10:37.000]  complaining and Pat Tillman starts complaining they had to greasing and
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.520]  that of course came out because the army coroner wouldn't lie and said it was a

[11:11.880 --> 11:18.640]  production in Afghanistan or or or 92% boom MSNBC associated press blow it up
[11:18.640 --> 11:24.120]  for people watching boom opium cultivation out of control UN says really
[11:24.120 --> 11:28.480]  being loaded on all those UN aircraft Afghan crop total 92% of world supply
[11:28.480 --> 11:33.120]  exceeded global consumption they got so much of it they can't even sell all of
[11:33.120 --> 11:40.400]  it and it was right at 10% why am I getting into this now when all this came
[11:40.400 --> 11:43.560]  out they had to kill a bunch of troops and military investigators whole bunch
[11:43.560 --> 11:48.080]  of and and then the containment didn't work so they just came out and said yeah
[11:48.080 --> 11:52.280]  we grow it we loaded on aircraft but it's for America and there's no discussion
[11:52.280 --> 11:57.040]  about well then why have they catch you with heroin do you go to jail well that's
[11:57.040 --> 12:05.600]  because they got to keep the price up now that said yesterday I'm shooting the
[12:05.600 --> 12:12.360]  nightly news right before it airs and one of my IT people one of my six IT
[12:12.360 --> 12:21.880]  people comes in and says the FBI wants to meet with me tomorrow and I said what
[12:21.880 --> 12:25.400]  about me said well you know before I worked here a year ago you know because
[12:25.400 --> 12:29.560]  I did did the interviews I was doing because we hired somebody who already
[12:29.560 --> 12:33.480]  had a job because we're paying more who builds websites for the biggest bar
[12:33.480 --> 12:38.440]  owners in Austin and he does great work so I said yeah build websites do code
[12:38.440 --> 12:45.160]  for us I hire him he comes in and I said okay well you can either get a lawyer
[12:45.160 --> 12:50.320]  and refuse to go or you can go and just see but I'm gonna imagine it's gonna
[12:50.320 --> 12:57.280]  turn into alex jones discussion not bars and people I've never met and I said at
[12:57.280 --> 13:00.520]  that point if they start telling you you're a criminal with something made
[13:00.520 --> 13:08.600]  up I said the issue is anything you say that's even halfway wrong they've got
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.960]  unconstitutional laws where they say oh lying to the FBI kind of like filming
[13:12.960 --> 13:16.480]  police they put you in prison for life now in Illinois the law doesn't even
[13:16.480 --> 13:21.520]  say that they got juries that'll do it I mean half the country zombies so I
[13:21.520 --> 13:25.560]  explained to him I said you do what you want but when I come into the
[13:25.560 --> 13:33.040]  conversation it's gonna be a news item I said don't bring me up you may get FBI
[13:33.040 --> 13:37.080]  people that aren't criminals because they got compartmentalized ones that do
[13:37.080 --> 13:44.280]  you know the local drug stuff the local bank robberies kidnapping stuff like
[13:44.280 --> 13:52.600]  that but I said if if I come up obviously I'm gonna talk about it well he
[13:52.600 --> 13:56.920]  met with him this morning and about a third of the discussion is about Alex
[13:56.920 --> 14:05.080]  Jones and how they listen every day and want me to know they listen oh gee you
[14:05.080 --> 14:10.440]  didn't think I didn't know you listen like I don't know what I'm dealing with

[14:15.720 --> 14:20.480]  to blame it on me in Florida like I haven't had probably 30 times police try
[14:20.480 --> 14:25.920]  to get me to talk about attacking other police so you can put me in prison like
[14:25.920 --> 14:30.680]  I haven't had Marine Corps officers in plain clothes try to get me to attack
[14:30.680 --> 14:35.280]  the State Department with them when I'm covering Bilderberg get this through

[24:29.960 --> 24:34.680]  want to find some drugs find all that cheap heroin
[24:34.680 --> 24:37.720]  flooding out on our streets that the government grows publicly loads on
[24:37.720 --> 24:42.520]  aircraft and flies here publicly i mean the russian consulates have
[24:42.520 --> 24:47.160]  publicly complained and said please stop shipping it into russia
[24:47.160 --> 24:50.360]  i'm so sick of it and i'm calling the whole thing for what it is
[24:50.360 --> 24:54.520]  a sick joke but i know it's all funny i've seen government reports that have
[24:54.520 --> 24:57.160]  come out where people that know they're being
[24:57.160 --> 25:00.840]  their phones are being tapped are still schizophrenic
[25:00.840 --> 25:08.520]  that happened to um well a famous uh writer i'm i'm having one of those uh
[25:08.520 --> 25:12.120]  moments where i can't pull up the name even though i've uh
[25:12.120 --> 25:18.040]  read so many of his books the old man in the sea
[25:18.040 --> 25:21.800]  one of the one about the spanish uh civil war
[25:21.800 --> 25:26.440]  it's gonna uh earn his timmingway and it turned out they were harassing him
[25:26.440 --> 25:29.320]  dirty tricks breaking in his house listening to his phones
[25:29.320 --> 25:33.000]  and he talked about it and they grabbed him and gave him electroshock therapy
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.800]  the fbi did until they fried his brain that's jager hoover for you
[25:37.800 --> 25:41.160]  because jager hoover loved destroying hollywood people artist
[25:41.160 --> 25:44.440]  because it was part of his power trip while he dressed around in women's
[25:44.440 --> 25:48.280]  clothes as you know pranced around at home with his boyfriend
[25:48.280 --> 25:51.720]  they hate stars they hate powerful people they hate good people
[25:51.720 --> 25:56.520]  because that's what it attracts that's the type of people on average that want
[25:56.520 --> 26:01.080]  to go around and and be the good guys but are really the bad guys
[26:01.080 --> 26:05.160]  and then they've always got the idiot core of the fbi who are actually
[26:05.160 --> 26:08.840]  are so dumb they don't know there's a bunch of narcotics trafficking child
[26:08.840 --> 26:12.440]  kidnapping money laundering killers above them
[26:12.440 --> 26:16.680]  i mean this justice department that wants me to know they listen every day
[26:16.680 --> 26:21.160]  gee fbi agents locally i'm on the white house enemies list that's been in the
[26:21.160 --> 26:23.640]  newspaper the white house has responded to me
[26:23.640 --> 26:27.480]  they have media matters attacking me every week who infiltrates groups from
[26:27.480 --> 26:32.280]  within and destroys them gee i get spies and generals calling
[26:32.280 --> 26:36.360]  me up at midnight i i talk to 15 million people every
[26:36.360 --> 26:39.720]  week do you think i don't know the government's
[26:39.720 --> 26:43.240]  listening to my radio show
[26:44.920 --> 26:49.720]  and maybe maybe five five percent chance out of a hundred these are nice
[26:49.720 --> 26:53.160]  fbi agents who were just like no talk bad about us
[26:53.160 --> 26:57.400]  we're not bad we hear alex say bad things about us all the time
[26:57.400 --> 27:01.720]  well if you're gee gemini crickets that type of guy
[27:01.720 --> 27:08.360]  let me tell you something buddy you need to stop being naive like gomer pile
[27:08.360 --> 27:11.560]  gee sarge
[27:18.680 --> 27:22.040]  i was a selfish person i would get out of this country so fast it would make
[27:22.040 --> 27:25.800]  your head spin but i have said i'm staying
[27:25.800 --> 27:30.520]  here and i'm not selling out and i'm not going to give in to fear i'm
[27:30.520 --> 27:36.200]  going to go with it and love it that's why i'm so alive
[27:36.200 --> 27:42.200]  it's just it's just so idiotic
[27:43.560 --> 27:47.000]  those fbi people and they were here like why are there posters of obama on the
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.440]  walls and i'm like this is a media operation that's my last film
[27:52.440 --> 27:56.760]  and you see it's a film and then and what i'm like yeah i know i've seen it
[27:56.760 --> 28:01.160]  oh but you're asking me what it is you are the one that has something wrong
[28:01.160 --> 28:04.120]  with him you're the one under suspicion
[28:04.120 --> 28:06.760]  i immediately when those people showed up or when i'm just bowed up to him
[28:06.760 --> 28:09.800]  immediately because just like i walk outside there's
[28:09.800 --> 28:15.640]  a rabid dog with its hair falling out and and foam coming out its mouth
[28:15.640 --> 28:20.280]  just like i walk up you know changing a tire on i-35 and there's cars flying by
[28:20.280 --> 28:28.200]  me i'm concerned about that that that that danger going by me
[28:28.200 --> 28:33.160]  and i've experienced it you know i grew up
[28:33.160 --> 28:39.800]  watching the police deal drugs to kids and i watched them leave the mid-level
[28:39.800 --> 28:44.120]  local drug dealers alone and bust the people they sold to
[28:44.120 --> 28:46.520]  and
[28:47.800 --> 28:55.320]  i'm tired of it i'm sick of it and i know that most of the detectives in this
[28:55.320 --> 29:00.040]  country and most the high-level police fbi you name it are so criminal
[29:00.040 --> 29:03.880]  it'll make your head spin i exposed like why are you having
[29:03.880 --> 29:08.920]  drug dogs and search and lockers and all this stuff up here
[29:10.200 --> 29:13.720]  why are you trying to force the football team to drug test you guys are selling
[29:13.720 --> 29:16.840]  the drugs oh we're gonna slam your head into the
[29:16.840 --> 29:22.200]  office desk and threaten you and and say that we're going to set you up for
[29:22.200 --> 29:25.800]  stealing stereo equipment and then the police started running around saying
[29:25.800 --> 29:29.640]  that i was on drugs and then they had to the grapevine my
[29:29.640 --> 29:32.760]  our lawyer told he called my dad and said
[29:32.760 --> 29:36.360]  they're gonna arrest your son and hang him in the jail cell
[29:36.360 --> 29:39.720]  and by the way they've done it to a bunch of people in rock wall
[29:39.720 --> 29:43.000]  show you you better move and i had to move to austin
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.720]  because the police were threatening to hang a 16 year old because i knew they
[29:47.720 --> 29:53.720]  were narcotics traffickers we're on the march the empires on the run

[35:50.280 --> 35:54.520]  kill babies after birth in china this is the shocking face of china's brutal
[35:54.520 --> 35:59.000]  one-shot policy which many academics and pressure groups are now calling
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.920]  to be imposed in the west the image shows a nine-month-old baby
[36:02.920 --> 36:08.120]  lying dead in a bucket forcibly aborted by chinese family planning authorities
[36:08.120 --> 36:12.600]  in the town of moshan she was just a few weeks away they injected the baby still
[36:12.600 --> 36:15.000]  lived bagged was crying they put it in a bucket of
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.880]  water because the parents of the baby already had a
[36:17.880 --> 36:21.560]  child they were hunted down this is what they're calling for here in the u.s
[36:21.560 --> 36:25.240]  to comply with china's draconian one-shot policy the mother was injected with a
[36:25.240 --> 36:28.680]  poison that induced an abortion but after the baby was pulled out
[36:28.680 --> 36:32.840]  inhumanely like a piece of meat that's from this is a u.s exclusive english
[36:32.840 --> 36:35.560]  language exclusive it was still alive she

[36:43.480 --> 36:45.960]  bucket left to die they well that's how they do it the parts about the
[36:45.960 --> 36:48.040]  abortion mills is throwing a bucket to die
[36:48.040 --> 36:51.000]  where so in china it's come out they save the babies too for medical
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.640]  experiments living but again they're not human according to our
[36:53.640 --> 36:57.640]  media you're a conspiracy theorist if you say it's a life
[36:57.640 --> 37:02.280]  see the sickness torture is good secret arrest is good
[37:02.280 --> 37:06.600]  john corzine can still billions it's good cancer viruses and the vaccines
[37:06.600 --> 37:10.200]  and the public those that aren't awake will not awaken because they'd have to
[37:10.200 --> 37:14.440]  admit everything they were told was a lie
[37:14.440 --> 37:17.480]  the timestamp of the image tells us the baby was killed monday the image began
[37:17.480 --> 37:21.080]  circulating today on webio china's version of twitter which is around
[37:21.080 --> 37:24.360]  260 million members the story was attracted widespread
[37:24.360 --> 37:27.480]  revulsion directed against the family planning authorities responsible for
[37:27.480 --> 37:31.160]  the murder of the baby i have u.s family planning videos and we're going to our
[37:31.160 --> 37:35.080]  guest that we've shown where the our government admits they funded these
[37:35.080 --> 37:38.200]  policies in china set it up the agreement was they'd make
[37:38.200 --> 37:41.960]  them the new power base because they'll leverage out the rest of
[37:41.960 --> 37:44.360]  the world industrially and then force that model everywhere
[37:44.360 --> 37:48.600]  see but the lowest common denominator forces that model everywhere else
[37:48.600 --> 37:52.760]  and where they talk about how great it is they kill the babies
[37:52.760 --> 37:59.240]  and how great it is this is from the 60s before it was even law in the 70s
[37:59.240 --> 38:05.160]  and they haunt you down the un does it in africa and i see bbc articles the
[38:05.160 --> 38:08.280]  ignorant africans run when the un comes to give them vaccines
[38:08.280 --> 38:11.560]  and it's all the women crying all our babies in the village over a hundred
[38:11.560 --> 38:14.760]  women were you know over a hundred women were pregnant some
[38:14.760 --> 38:20.280]  only about to give birth in days all the babies died some of the women died
[38:20.280 --> 38:23.960]  women have been known in africa when they're hunted down in the jungle and
[38:23.960 --> 38:27.000]  given the shots they will then run and chop their arm off as quick as they can
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.280]  with a machete of course then it came out the un was doing that
[38:32.280 --> 38:38.360]  this is your murdering government your global corporate murder system
[38:38.360 --> 38:41.320]  and all of you that think you're going to serve the system and be part of the
[38:41.320 --> 38:44.520]  power structure when they release that mega bio weapon

[40:02.120 --> 40:05.560]  corezine well you know it's true but i mean
[40:05.560 --> 40:10.600]  all the same thing is happening now in yesterday by the way in ventura county
[40:10.600 --> 40:13.960]  with uh if anybody goes online and reads david gunford's
[40:13.960 --> 40:18.920]  uh blog and uh and mike adams is uh comment last night
[40:18.920 --> 40:23.080]  it seems as if uh you can't even you know the fda two years ago just so
[40:23.080 --> 40:26.600]  everybody understands what's going on they have decided
[40:26.600 --> 40:31.960]  uh and it's on record in a court case uh that you and i have no right to make
[40:31.960 --> 40:36.280]  any decision what we want to put into our body or our children's bodies that the
[40:36.280 --> 40:41.000]  fda has the ultimate authority and that's where all this is coming from
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.280]  along with pharmaceutical industry and whoever else
[40:44.280 --> 40:47.080]  you'll never get to the bottom it because they want to agree with what what
[40:47.080 --> 40:51.560]  or let you know what the real truth is but i love your passion alex and it is
[40:51.560 --> 40:56.280]  true um in august of third of last year uh after being
[40:56.280 --> 41:02.600]  rated the year before um they came the year before in 2010 they came in with
[41:02.600 --> 41:06.200]  dozens and dozens of agents took over the place
[41:06.200 --> 41:10.200]  uh that's the famous video with the guns drawn and you didn't shut down
[41:10.200 --> 41:13.640]  so now they're going to try to make you an example putting you under the jail
[41:13.640 --> 41:17.720]  right well a year later after that guns drawn raid they came in
[41:17.720 --> 41:23.400]  and arrested me on 13 uh charges and uh those charges stemmed basically from
[41:23.400 --> 41:29.080]  raw dairy products you are correct and uh i got out three days later and uh
[41:29.080 --> 41:33.960]  basically they took uh a 24 foot steak side truck and there are videos on
[41:33.960 --> 41:37.480]  youtube uh uh testing to this because people were
[41:37.480 --> 41:41.480]  all the members of rossum were there uh looking over the fences with their
[41:41.480 --> 41:46.440]  cell phones and video cameras and whatnot they loaded up this truck with
[41:46.440 --> 41:50.520]  almost every food product that was at rossum and took it to a dump in the
[41:50.520 --> 41:53.960]  valley and got rid of it although next door to us
[41:53.960 --> 41:58.520]  is a place called bread and roses which is a place that feeds the homeless
[41:58.520 --> 42:01.960]  so instead of taking the hundred thousand dollars worth of food they stole
[42:01.960 --> 42:04.920]  and dumped they could have fed the homeless next door
[42:04.920 --> 42:09.080]  meanwhile the food was gone and uh now
[42:09.080 --> 42:13.880]  let's see i went to five uh uh five court appearances
[42:13.880 --> 42:19.800]  on the fifth appearance which was uh January was it March the March the
[42:19.800 --> 42:23.640]  second while we were scheduling another date
[42:23.640 --> 42:27.640]  two sheriffs jumped over the bar and arrested Sharon Palmer and myself
[42:27.640 --> 42:34.840]  in this show of grand force and uh you know and it just was this scene
[42:34.840 --> 42:40.760]  so um we then were put downstairs and i was put in jail for a week and a day
[42:40.760 --> 42:44.680]  and Sharon didn't get out for three weeks on charges
[42:44.680 --> 42:50.920]  that now there's uh a conspiracy to commit money laundering and uh grand
[42:50.920 --> 42:54.680]  theft and you name it million dollar bills on me and what they do is they go
[42:54.680 --> 42:57.960]  to your employees and and say we're going to put you in prison
[42:57.960 --> 43:00.840]  for made-up crimes if you don't lie about your boss
[43:00.840 --> 43:04.040]  and and they can connect it to people that aren't even involved they'll just go
[43:04.040 --> 43:05.800]  tell a neighbor we're going to put you in jail
[43:05.800 --> 43:09.320]  if you don't say this it looks like i have the FBI trying to do that to me
[43:09.320 --> 43:13.160]  right now out of something that i'm not even connected to
[43:13.160 --> 43:16.280]  that's how they work they just go down the line
[43:16.280 --> 43:19.480]  this is this is who runs our government just absolute evil
[43:19.480 --> 43:23.240]  well you know Mike Adams and i've been talking a lot recently and
[43:23.240 --> 43:27.160]  you know it's an interesting question Alex why people are not aware of what's
[43:27.160 --> 43:29.880]  going on back in the 60s and 70s when it didn't
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.040]  take much time to figure out how to demonstrate for let's say a war in
[43:34.040 --> 43:38.440]  vietnam and get that shut down i believe people are in fear
[43:38.440 --> 43:43.160]  harassed intimidated uh living in their comfort little lifestyles and they
[43:43.160 --> 43:46.280]  don't understand that it's coming to them real soon
[43:46.280 --> 43:50.200]  and when you see what's really going on it's not just me you're right it's the
[43:50.200 --> 43:53.480]  Amish farmers it's uh uh let me give you the other
[43:53.480 --> 43:57.720]  little example of what happened you heard about farm to fork right in Nevada
[43:57.720 --> 44:01.560]  last year yes okay so it doesn't matter people try to
[44:01.560 --> 44:04.440]  have a party and bring their organic food like the
[44:04.440 --> 44:07.400]  old-fashioned country cookouts we still have those in these
[44:07.400 --> 44:10.280]  texas for everybody you know at the end of the summer
[44:10.280 --> 44:15.000]  uh brings meat brings food and and now they have this global this is what
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.560]  Stalin did in in Ukraine and other areas
[44:17.560 --> 44:21.400]  and China the UN has said use food as a weapon for those that don't know
[44:21.400 --> 44:25.160]  they actually come and raid people and dump their potatoes
[44:25.160 --> 44:31.080]  rutabagas uh everything in the trash acting like it's toxic waste
[44:31.080 --> 44:36.520]  on private property they they do this on private property
[44:36.520 --> 44:40.440]  if you don't believe you're protected if you're on your own farm or your own
[44:40.440 --> 44:43.800]  house or your own land no no no that's the rule
[44:43.800 --> 44:47.640]  of that new rule commission uh that obama set up
[44:47.640 --> 44:51.960]  uh where he admits the homeland security in the pentagon is over all farms
[44:51.960 --> 44:55.960]  you know i listened to sheriff richard mac last night on a uh
[44:55.960 --> 45:00.200]  half hour show that was on mike adams's uh maybe it was on your show i don't
[45:00.200 --> 45:02.920]  remember and here's a man that's talking about
[45:02.920 --> 45:06.920]  you know sovereignty and and all the other stuff i have to let everybody
[45:06.920 --> 45:10.520]  know that when i was taken this time on march the
[45:10.520 --> 45:15.240]  second and incarcerated for eight days i never
[45:15.240 --> 45:18.440]  mentioned the word sovereignty but let me tell you what happened
[45:18.440 --> 45:22.200]  not only downstairs in the uh the holding tank
[45:22.200 --> 45:26.040]  they started accusing me of being a sovereign which is now
[45:26.040 --> 45:31.000]  a terrorist word okay so what they do immediately is
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.480]  they put you with a different kind of armband you're a danger to the community
[45:35.480 --> 45:39.560]  even the community inside the jail system
[45:39.560 --> 45:45.400]  so they put me in holding cells for minimum three four five six hours with
[45:45.400 --> 45:49.880]  basically no warmth to they can learn how to torture you these days without
[45:49.880 --> 45:53.160]  actually physically touching you and that's what they're planning to do
[45:53.160 --> 45:58.360]  and they did it to me uh i i do have to admit when i was transferred to
[45:58.360 --> 46:01.800]  ventura that that was better treated up there
[46:01.800 --> 46:05.960]  but still the whole entire system is now as you know and i love your passion
[46:05.960 --> 46:12.120]  about it alex is on the verge of as uh i guess as many people
[46:12.120 --> 46:17.240]  two hundred years ago said how about ben franklin
[46:17.240 --> 46:22.600]  i give you a republic if you can keep it
[46:22.600 --> 46:26.040]  what me people need to do is stand up right now they're not standing up and i
[46:26.040 --> 46:29.880]  don't understand why and i and it's too obvious by
[46:29.880 --> 46:33.800]  listening to people like you and myself and what not what's going on
[46:33.800 --> 46:36.920]  if you those that sweep on their rights don't have any
[46:36.920 --> 46:40.600]  and if we don't stand up as a complete group of people
[46:40.600 --> 46:43.160]  we have to stop the infighting that's going on
[46:43.160 --> 46:47.240]  involved ourselves in our own alternative
[46:47.240 --> 46:50.520]  industry people are fighting amongst themselves
[46:50.520 --> 46:54.680]  division is what keeps them uh uh from winning
[46:54.680 --> 47:00.920]  so we all have to join forces with each other i agree with you alex
[47:00.920 --> 47:05.240]  well you're right and again it's the obama administration establishment of
[47:05.240 --> 47:08.200]  white house rural council to strengthen rural communities
[47:08.200 --> 47:11.640]  and it says in the press release at whitehouse.gov
[47:11.640 --> 47:16.840]  homeland security department of defense rural spies commasars
[47:16.840 --> 47:20.760]  and it's it's now happening they're arming all the little agencies
[47:20.760 --> 47:24.280]  we are the enemy uh we don't even really
[47:24.280 --> 47:27.880]  deer hunt but we have a small area that we you know leased out of our
[47:27.880 --> 47:33.320]  old ranch slash farm in east texas and now
[47:33.320 --> 47:36.920]  they have federally controlled game wardens who just show up and treat you
[47:36.920 --> 47:40.440]  like a criminal and demand to come in your cookhouse
[47:40.440 --> 47:44.200]  and uh getting everybody's face and it's just it's just government wants you to
[47:44.200 --> 47:49.800]  know we own you got it now the way i heard
[47:49.800 --> 47:53.240]  mike adams described this is they kept you in freezing conditions sewage
[47:53.240 --> 47:56.840]  running in uh all of this and and this is what they did
[47:56.840 --> 47:59.000]  bradley manning which has been admitted to be torture
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.240]  they call it paying compliance they break arms and call it playing
[48:03.240 --> 48:07.720]  paying compliance i have video of this this is what america is
[48:07.720 --> 48:11.560]  yeah i did see some brutality inside there i was not actually treated
[48:11.560 --> 48:15.960]  brutally as far as being kicked or in some way shape or form
[48:15.960 --> 48:20.680]  horribly attacked physically but they believe also learned how to do that in
[48:20.680 --> 48:24.520]  ways in which you're isolated for six hours in a cold cell at
[48:24.520 --> 48:29.880]  50 degrees with nothing warm to keep you warm so you're freezing with hypothermia
[48:29.880 --> 48:33.640]  yeah they they then overflowed the toilets in the area of the jail that i
[48:33.640 --> 48:36.440]  was in where there were two to three inches of
[48:36.440 --> 48:40.280]  i'm not joking shit and p floating all the way into the bottom of my cell so
[48:40.280 --> 48:43.720]  all i could do is stay on the bed the smell was insane
[48:43.720 --> 48:48.360]  and they didn't come for four hours to clean it up okay
[48:48.360 --> 48:51.160]  and then when they do clean it up they give you the same mop that they're
[48:51.160 --> 48:55.000]  mopping up the shit with to mop up your cell and that's supposed to keep you
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.240]  nice and sanitary and clean at this point obviously it's a complete joke
[48:59.240 --> 49:03.400]  inside there there is brutality inside there as well i did see some
[49:03.400 --> 49:07.160]  guys heads being smashed up in the walls and whatnot but and let's be clear
[49:07.160 --> 49:10.520]  these are colleges that create more criminals we have the biggest
[49:10.520 --> 49:13.400]  crime wave in the world we have the biggest prison population the
[49:13.400 --> 49:17.640]  government and bank ship and the drugs publicly wells fargo and others
[49:17.640 --> 49:20.920]  launder it don't get in trouble this is this is all in our
[49:20.920 --> 49:25.480]  face and and and you're selling milk and papayas
[49:25.480 --> 49:28.840]  and things there they've they're charging you for all of that papayas
[49:28.840 --> 49:32.280]  everything is evil they're rating other people now
[49:32.280 --> 49:36.440]  what are you facing because you're facing i mean tell folks about the bail the
[49:36.440 --> 49:39.480]  million dollars the what's happening to you they
[49:39.480 --> 49:43.240]  want everybody to know you're going to eat gmo and you're going to die of
[49:43.240 --> 49:47.400]  cancer and you're going to love it that's exactly right um yeah they
[49:47.400 --> 49:51.880]  this whole grandstanding event that went on and then the bails were set at
[49:51.880 --> 49:57.160]  they're just insane the uh the idea that uh that i should be a million
[49:57.160 --> 50:01.880]  dollars bail but they trumped up 37 felony counts
[50:01.880 --> 50:05.880]  all and that's why they can justify it but let me ask you a question did john
[50:05.880 --> 50:09.800]  chorus i don't have any bail did the peanut company that sick and seven
[50:09.800 --> 50:12.680]  hundred people and killed nine and of course now they're going to go after
[50:12.680 --> 50:16.280]  you after hours of interrogation they'll claim you lie about something
[50:16.280 --> 50:19.240]  that they'll just twist or they'll have one of their
[50:19.240 --> 50:24.040]  drughead informants lie about you and say you're you know murdering babies
[50:24.040 --> 50:27.160]  uh that that is very true and that's what they do
[50:27.160 --> 50:31.080]  so you you are correct when people listen to you they have to understand on the
[50:31.080 --> 50:35.640]  show that you're not exaggerating anymore this is not exaggeration folks
[50:35.640 --> 50:40.520]  out there this is what's really going on now and people you know i i'm hoping
[50:40.520 --> 50:43.400]  people aren't doing this is just entertainment this is going to come to
[50:43.400 --> 50:46.520]  you soon as well people need to stand up and do something

[54:57.080 --> 55:00.680]  joke they thought the big journals medical journals coming out and seeing
[55:00.680 --> 55:03.880]  killed children up to age three even when they're healthy if the parents or
[55:03.880 --> 55:06.360]  state want to people are like this isn't real

[55:11.800 --> 55:15.560]  information it's isn't a joke and if america would just wake up
[55:15.560 --> 55:18.920]  the criminals in government and corporations who work together couldn't
[55:18.920 --> 55:23.080]  get away with this and i've seen all the videos i've
[55:23.080 --> 55:27.560]  read the affidavits they're all online i i mean this was a mainline place i know
[55:27.560 --> 55:31.480]  people in la who drove there and bought stuff
[55:31.480 --> 55:37.000]  vegetables milk all of it i mean this is this is an above board it's like the
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.360]  amish guys selling to people they call it an undercover year-long
[55:40.360 --> 55:44.280]  operation where the guy's selling to people with undercover folks acting
[55:44.280 --> 55:47.800]  like they're their neighbors selling a milk
[55:47.800 --> 55:50.680]  and that guys we bring me a jug of milk and a glass out of the refrigerator i'm
[55:50.680 --> 55:54.760]  going to drink some here on air i gave some of the austin police chief
[55:54.760 --> 55:58.600]  didn't didn't didn't the austin police chief drink some
[55:58.600 --> 56:02.200]  yeah when i had art ace of eight in here my memory fails
[56:02.200 --> 56:04.440]  didn't that happen when i had ace of eight in here i was like here's raw milk
[56:04.440 --> 56:07.400]  you gonna arrest me and he thought i was joking and i said he's gonna have
[56:07.400 --> 56:10.520]  troops on the streets art's of eight and he said the sky
[56:10.520 --> 56:14.920]  would literally have to fall for that to happen
[56:14.920 --> 56:18.120]  and now we have troops at the kite festival let's go back to our guests in
[56:18.120 --> 56:22.680]  one more segment with him uh james what can we do what are you
[56:22.680 --> 56:25.000]  facing where is this going how can we help you
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.200]  against the food police well you know first of all you know
[56:28.200 --> 56:31.880]  i don't understand why there's no pro bono attorneys that like you know and i
[56:31.880 --> 56:34.920]  won't mention names that are not trying to
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.480]  come to the aid of whoever out there myself or anybody else because
[56:39.480 --> 56:42.520]  it's necessary at this point that the masses stand up
[56:42.520 --> 56:46.520]  and take their power back they never really lost it in the first place
[56:46.520 --> 56:51.160]  but people are it seems to me afraid to actually stand up and that's why we have
[56:51.160 --> 56:55.080]  the issue in the problem that we have alex people are not willing to stand
[56:55.080 --> 56:58.360]  up and i don't mean just regular people i mean anybody
[56:58.360 --> 57:02.040]  including the attorneys everybody needs to get involved in this
[57:02.040 --> 57:06.440]  and start making sure that it doesn't happen put a lot of effort into
[57:06.440 --> 57:10.280]  defending these people whoever they are myself or anybody else for that
[57:10.280 --> 57:13.160]  matter you know i don't feel like i'm the isolated
[57:13.160 --> 57:17.160]  person out here i see all the stories all the time that are going on
[57:17.160 --> 57:21.240]  you know i'm not going to stop and you know that's just my personality
[57:21.240 --> 57:24.920]  i feel the only way to change things is to put something into action and that's
[57:24.920 --> 57:28.360]  what rossum was about rossum was putting it into action
[57:28.360 --> 57:32.840]  other people intellectualize what they they know is going on that they forget
[57:32.840 --> 57:37.400]  or they're afraid to put something into action to do something about it
[57:37.400 --> 57:40.840]  well they've shut you down now they're trying to put you under the jail tell
[57:40.840 --> 57:44.280]  folks what you're facing websites where people can support you
[57:44.280 --> 57:48.360]  um the uh the charges in both cases now
[57:48.360 --> 57:51.960]  inventor in la add up to probably 40 years in jail
[57:51.960 --> 57:55.160]  which have doubt seriously but at the same point you know that's what they
[57:55.160 --> 57:58.360]  could they got juries that would send babies to a gas chamber
[57:58.360 --> 58:02.200]  yeah i know um it well i don't understand that either by the way how
[58:02.200 --> 58:05.560]  can juries be that you know uh it's gladiatorial even though
[58:05.560 --> 58:09.560]  they're going to be destroyed by it next week they enjoy burning people it's a
[58:09.560 --> 58:12.840]  demonic nation it is crazy my friends no um
[58:12.840 --> 58:16.520]  they can uh get in touch with mike adams at natural news
[58:16.520 --> 58:21.400]  if they want to help donate their time their financial you know the financial
[58:21.400 --> 58:24.680]  situation mike adams would take care of it for us

[58:27.320 --> 58:30.120]  other points you want james i know you haven't done any interviews and i know

[58:43.240 --> 58:50.440]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[58:50.440 --> 58:53.640]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[58:53.640 --> 58:57.720]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[58:57.720 --> 59:01.640]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[59:01.640 --> 59:05.080]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[59:05.080 --> 59:09.320]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[59:09.320 --> 59:13.720]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[59:13.720 --> 59:17.400]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[59:17.400 --> 59:21.320]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[59:21.320 --> 59:24.440]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[59:24.440 --> 59:28.360]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[59:28.360 --> 59:32.120]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe

[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.640]  right now we're talking to james stewart of rossom foods there in southern
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.440]  california you saw the images of the oranges of
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:49.000]  the papayas the mangos the milk the chicken being thrown in the back of
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.320]  the truck to be taken to the landfill because they dare sell organic
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:58.600]  food that people grew on their own farms and brought in as a collective
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:02.920]  to then sell because the government has to be over that the same
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.200]  fda that raised the level of radiation and said it was safe just like the
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.640]  epa did oh radiation level goes up from fukushima
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.400]  it's safe we just said so do you safe but for heaven
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.520]  forbid you drink raw milk the thing is this is totally legal
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:21.800]  they're now trying to get them on money laundering and stuff or lying to
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.160]  federal agents is always the same like when i had the fbi here one time and
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.760]  they were bringing up other subjects i said i can't even talk to you you'll
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.040]  just say i lied to you
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.600]  so i just started telling them about their crimes till they left
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.360]  um james what's the outpouring been like because your story has been on the
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.640]  drudge report it's been on the news i mean it's been all over i think it's
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:47.160]  really woken people up well i hope so you know i wasn't
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.520]  my intention to do that to wake people up it was just
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:55.560]  you know a food club that wanted to provide high quality food as you mentioned
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.800]  earlier by the way alex the entire rossum club was
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.040]  basically a membership only private membership only club
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.400]  you know and so therefore you know the public couldn't come in
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.080]  i mean swingers can go to a private club and have sex with each other
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.360]  but you can't sell in a private club potatoes
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.160]  uh exactly or anything else especially
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.520]  especially surrounding raw dairy really that's the
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.640]  the crux of it now but eventually it'll be something that
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:28.680]  is a non gmo product you know you gotta you gotta consume just gmo and that's
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:33.800]  it rossum always looked into what the problem with the food was
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.840]  you know by the way let me show you briefly so most people don't understand
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.240]  this words and terms are misleading the word raw is
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.160]  misleading the word cold press is misleading why is it misleading
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.480]  because nobody has legally defined these terms so when you go by what you
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:53.000]  think is a raw product or cold pressed oil it's not
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.840]  and that's the problem the problem is anything under pasteurized temperatures
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:01.000]  is fair game to be called those things and it's dead food and yet well that's
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.360]  like calling total gmo natural correct and so what rossum was doing was
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.040]  looking into the source of everything and bringing that
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:13.240]  information forward and trying to find the highest quality products
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:17.320]  for everybody and you were getting popular and so they said just like the
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.280]  liberty dollar which even the wall street journal said it was totally
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.440]  legal to have the liberty dollar it wasn't masquerading as a us currency
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.800]  and that guy's you know gonna be sent soon and sent off down the river
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.960]  i mean they're going after everybody yeah popular is for is correct we were
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:35.880]  becoming very popular and after the rate of 2010
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:39.400]  which is an obvious fact we came even more popular because
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:43.480]  they shoot themselves in the foot by attacking everybody because then people
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:47.560]  wake up and realize what's going on only got a minute left i want to have you
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:51.400]  back up for the full hour soon because you're a really smart guy
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.880]  and i just want to hear your view on other things hopefully before they send
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.600]  you off for 40 years we got to pay for in prison
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.280]  because you sell milk never was never a victim they're not even say anybody's
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.360]  hurt final statement here james stewart
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:08.280]  alex i heard you in the beginning of the show talk about food and what's missing
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.400]  in our food everybody needs to understand
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.760]  you can eat 75 less food if it's high density quality food
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:21.800]  and minerals is the main key all i really ever wanted to do was provide
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.640]  information for people about what the highest quality food is
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.600]  ask yourself the question what's the purpose of eating or drinking anything
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:32.200]  other than the taste of smell the ambiance the fun of eating it it's getting
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.480]  nutrients and nutrition out of the food this is food
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:39.560]  why are they after people who are providing high quality food
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.400]  because they don't want you to be well

[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:57.320]  american free press mark anderson who did an
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.320]  incredible job last year in switzerland covering
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.000]  bill deberg 2011 in june it's normally in
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  early june sometimes in late may coming up to about 25 minutes he's gonna write
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.840]  shotgun with us jim tucker is going to be popping in
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:18.280]  and joining us jim tucker author of the bill deberg diary and of course uh
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.920]  one of the editors there at american free press
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:26.360]  and we're going to be breaking all of that down uh mark anderson
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:30.040]  again uh has just done an exemplary job
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:34.280]  when it comes to exposing bill deberg as well and more and more as jim gets older
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:40.840]  now the torch is getting passed to mark anderson and this is important because
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:49.080]  jim tucker has been shot at uh covering bill deberg in
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:55.000]  europe in portugal he's been arrested you name it i've been detained arrested
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.400]  threatened uh have people try to set us up trying to cover it
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.680]  this is a big deal and he's the only person who has
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:07.160]  real bill deberg group contacts he's able over and over to tell you what's
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:11.240]  going to be announced months or years before with exact precision
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.160]  and i know mark more and more is uh is uh shagwaying
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:19.640]  taking the baton from jim jim still charging out an amazing person
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:24.920]  um but mark anderson joins us to give us any intel on new developments
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:28.840]  uh there's always the rumors that the globalist will rent a hotel they're
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.960]  not really going to use in another country then they'll get another one to
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.480]  divert people in the city in the country they're going to be at
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:39.400]  so here to break it down is mark anderson mark thank you for coming on
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.440]  with us from american free press dot net
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.560]  uh thank you alex thanks for having me on it uh
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:50.040]  it's been a busy 24 hours i've been poking around over in chicago
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.720]  about the current thing and that's of course the upcoming nato meeting
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.640]  which very well could tie into this as jim will tell you later
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.560]  bill deberg tends to operate in the shadows of other meetings because
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:04.920]  even these wealthy billionaires try to economize and have their
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.680]  have their bill deberg meeting not too far away from where they have their
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:11.640]  other confats so there's a lot of activity in the
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.920]  midwest with uh the nato summit upcoming in may but they're having
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:19.000]  prelims right now the chicago consul on global affairs met last
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.040]  night and uh nicolas burns a former u.s representative
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:29.000]  to nato spelled out some of the nato agenda although in very general broad
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.920]  terms for public consumption and they're even having a mini nato summit
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.000]  as we speak at chicago water tower place right now
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.040]  but they might also have it in virginia because they moved the g8 they were
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:44.680]  going to have uh with the nato summit out of chicago
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.240]  but but every four years it's generally in north america
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:51.960]  you're saying your intel is leaning towards the united states not canada
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.600]  uh yeah at canada's a possibility they're having the the codex meeting up there in
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:00.200]  may but that seems less likely now jim and i just
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.720]  discussed this uh you know it's kind of drawcard
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:07.400]  discard drawcard discard as you say they kind of make dummy
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:11.320]  dummy announcements to try and people throw people off the trail we've heard
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.640]  heifer israel in recent times but they might hold it there
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.680]  which is a little disturbing no reporter likes to
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.960]  go there too too much is that we don't know how good the
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.720]  uh security would be we don't know how safe a reporter would be there uh in
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:30.040]  such turbulent times with the situation with iran and all that but
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:35.400]  i think that um uh virginia as you say they moved g8 i thought i had heard
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:39.880]  camp david on g8 uh is that right camp david marilin
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.880]  is that what you heard alec yes sir yeah and so
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.000]  that kind of splits things a little because they were going to have the g8
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  in chicago as you know with the nato summit the first ever nato summit in
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.680]  the wendy city um with ronnie manuel there i'm not too
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.120]  surprised though he's sort of a a regional global
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:02.440]  administrator for a business outfit called world business chicago
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:05.720]  which is a bunch bunch of wealthy you know elites and
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:11.240]  a well-connected people that is a semi-official body of the city of chicago
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.320]  you know a typical mingling of public and private which is what these globalists
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:19.160]  do and so the the chest manner being moved around the
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.440]  board uh nato is becoming more proactive they're calling
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:25.560]  themselves the first responders of the world now
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:30.600]  obviously departing from their traditional defensive posture as jim said
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.640]  they would do a decade ago that they were going to have that be the world
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:37.240]  army nato and folks are like yeah north atlantic treaty organization is going
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.000]  to be the world police they now say we are the world police
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.360]  yeah first responders that means you know when something goes wrong they're
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.640]  the ones on the scene but i have a feeling it wouldn't be with ambulances
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:51.160]  now that's when they fund alcada to attack your country they come in and bomb
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.440]  your country to back up al-qaeda publicly
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.840]  yeah who knows what insanity lurks in the hearts of men but
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:03.640]  anyway the yeah long story short it uh jim can give you a little bit more in
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:07.880]  the follow-up to what i'm saying now but i'm watching the midwest especially
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:12.280]  nato having a preliminary meeting right now at chicago water tower place
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:17.800]  have they ever met in chicago before no not the nato ministers not a full-blown
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:21.560]  nato meeting this is the first time ever ever ever ever
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.120]  has bill berg ever met in chicago not to my knowledge
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:30.360]  ask jim that one you know there's lots of resorts in and around chicago
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.040]  big country clubs that have big gates around them
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:38.040]  you know there's a lot of posh little areas as you head up yeah they made a
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.640]  mistake with chantele because we could get up within a hundred yards of the
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:45.000]  meeting area and bullhorn them and world leaders were coming out and giving
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.360]  me a look if it looks could kill i'd be lying on the floor
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:55.960]  exactly so uh you know to hit a golf ball in there in their beer order to drop
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:01.880]  to drop uh you know uh to drop whatever you want in their in their
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.960]  champagne we have to find out what they're where they're doing these things
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.000]  but as i say i'll be following the midwest thing
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.080]  jim's going to be looking at canada a bit uh as you say every four years they
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:17.240]  have a tendency to be in north america well i know he looks but a lot of years
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:21.080]  his source finally just tells him where it is bill berg internally as you know
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:25.640]  just stating what's for the audience they hold it from even the mid-level
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:31.240]  people till right before uh yeah that that's true uh and
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.240]  the way it went in switzerland last year where everything from
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:40.280]  foggy alpine mountains to especially high media coverage and agitation from
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:44.200]  protesters when that really drove them out of their fast they got there late
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:47.720]  due to the fog as it was and then they left early
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.000]  and then dominique they take that's what's legislator was demanding to get
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.920]  in you remember all that and they were really you know they really got
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:58.680]  rushed out of there in a hop and you know they're you know who knows they're
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.800]  probably as i've said before they're probably considering breaking this thing
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.640]  down into smaller meetings and you know we know that's already been going on if
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.600]  they were smart that there's resorts that are on
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.280]  multi-thousand-acre areas where they could just drive through and be left
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:15.880]  alone they're idiots yeah and next thing you know they'll stay at a
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.360]  super egg you know i don't know what they're doing it
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:21.960]  it's strange in that sense that they don't just go to a Rothschild estate
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:26.200]  or the an e-tenner or or Rockefeller's pecan to go hills you know up along the
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.080]  Hudson valley why don't they just go there i don't know
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:32.040]  you know that well they like the golf course is why they'd always like to
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.400]  have a golf course i guess so you know i
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:41.160]  uh soil brethren that they are at any at any rate well it's got to be an open
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.240]  resort they can bring hookers in too as well

[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:57.240]  got three and a half million views in two days the youtube got another two
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:00.040]  million i mean that's not the radio show
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.080]  that's just in tv that we only use when we're on the road
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.000]  because we can't handle the you know the the cost on our own servers
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.440]  three and a half well more like almost four million i mean
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.640]  whoa and we're gonna have reporters there this year if it's in europe if it's
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:17.400]  in the u.s you better believe i'm going to be there
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.960]  i'm not looking forward to the feds though always trying to set me up and
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:24.920]  breaking in my hotel room and stuff and david rockefeller calling me up
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:29.400]  people wouldn't like i didn't even say that it i won't even say stuff one
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:33.000]  error it's so bizarre i tell you a lot of circuses isn't it there
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.200]  when you cover bill deberg mr anderson in the four minutes we've got left with
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.240]  you other points you think are important to make about bill deberg
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:44.280]  point 12 well they're at a very pivotal point with nato
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.760]  i think the fact that nato's uh having a major crisis thing going on
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:54.040]  nato keeps saying uh what is our future will will we just uh you know go the
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.560]  way of the edsle or the way of the stew to baker or will we have our mission
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:00.760]  redefined they're constantly looking in the mirror and putting
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:05.160]  lipstick on and saying what is nato what is our mission now that the big bad
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:09.160]  russians aren't the main thing and so i think a major thing is going to be
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:15.480]  uh to nail down nato and get it the way they want it i think they
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:19.960]  showed a lot of their arbitrary and brutal force in the attack on libya
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:26.360]  and showed a what is what did hg wells call it the shape of things to come
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:31.080]  um and i think that that's going to be a huge thing uh jim will probably
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:35.080]  elaborate on them wanting to create a world treasury department you know
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:38.840]  that's one of their broad long range goals and they're openly announcing
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.400]  bank of the world right now i mean that's what they want
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:46.200]  i mean you're totally vindicated and so is jim jim 35 36 years covering this
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:49.560]  when they said it didn't exist it's all out in the open now
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.680]  what have you found on that front uh with the fact that everything you've
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:58.120]  talked about is now admitted well uh it one of the things that i think
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:01.240]  you're going to see more american coverage because of it
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:06.200]  um i haven't found a great deal on that uh i think a lot of that's going to
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:10.920]  become clearer uh this year uh and in terms of this being a
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:14.440]  more open thing of course i think european news sources will continue to
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:18.120]  give it more coverage even though that coverage is not always favorable
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:22.120]  sometimes the coverage is yes there's bill deberg but the people protesting
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:26.360]  about the problem not the bill deberg himself that came up in the swiss and
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:33.080]  german press last year a little bit and um uh but nato's restructuring uh nato
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:38.040]  wants germany to pay much more of the bill um they say germany has the biggest
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:42.360]  economy and and a lot of the real powerhouse of europe
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:46.200]  and yet they're saying germany isn't spending enough on its military and
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:51.080]  needs to put more of a footprint monetarily and militarily in the nato
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:55.160]  so in other words nato's dictating to what we think should be sovereign
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.840]  nations how big their military should be how much money they should spend i mean
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:04.040]  the bankers are installing presidents in greece in italy now and and acting like
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:09.640]  germany's taking over germany's being sucked dry to fund the creation of the
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:14.680]  global government that they admit publicly is going to be the euro
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:18.200]  yeah they've been trying to suck germany dry bailing out greece and
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:21.800]  yeah you know all these things are the chestmen that the bill deberg has helped
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:24.840]  move around the chess board that is their world
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:27.800]  from their point let me ask you this question they've got to be mad about
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:32.760]  last year i mean you guys and my crew blew them wide open last year
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:36.360]  yeah you can still hear the voices echoing through the alps including
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:41.480]  singing david rockefeller a you know 150 000th birthday or however old he is
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.520]  now and uh those voices are still probably echoing
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.920]  through the alps i remember that as the protesters came down the hill uh
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:53.640]  from the randelins a hostel there to the hotels of rata carrying torches that
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.760]  looked like something out of a frankenstein movie it was just
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:01.000]  absolutely surreal and saying david rockefeller a happy birthday to get to
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.040]  kind of give us a humorous note yeah it's got the double on tonder of the
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:07.720]  double meaning like it's friendly but it's it's not
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.240]  yeah yeah haven't you been here long enough no offense but you know it's time
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:14.600]  for you to leave now it was sort of the you know the under under I think it
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.960]  speaks well for the swiss that they gave the biggest response to bill deberg
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:21.880]  ever the of anybody else it does it does you know it was
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:25.640]  awkward to have a group like that in a in a country known for its
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:29.320]  storied independence and that's what dominique basic was trying to say

[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:27.320]  and i look at every piece of work i've been out years and all the news cover
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:31.880]  candidness and every piece of it and not being aware of bill
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:36.600]  de berg so i came to work for liberty lobby the
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:40.360]  ancestor of america free press in 1975
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:44.520]  i was asked what i thought about bill de berg and i thought he thought that
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:49.320]  the bird cheese ha ha jim jim let me interrupt you which i'm famous for
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:52.600]  you're a little too close to your phone can you back it off from your mouth a
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:56.040]  bit it's a little distorted is this better that's better go ahead sir
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:03.720]  all right so uh i was going to file um uh the very sketchy file at that time
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:08.200]  um bill de berg where uh great great westwood
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:13.320]  tagler had written two columns of bill de berg although he did not know the
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:18.120]  columns of bill de berg 1957 of jack lennon
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.720]  north carolina he got some telephone tips

[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:29.000]  limit scenes and helicopters landing helicopters with
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.280]  brand new things and uh people give you a big black limousine
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:38.200]  and going into this uh building that's started by
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:45.800]  uniformed cops uh and armed plain clothes type of
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:55.080]  cops and not being like uh westwood tagler uh
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:38:03.000]  i mean not being like uh west uh jim peterson jim pearson jim pearson
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  westwood tagler actually threw down there to check out the story
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.240]  and he got his binoculars and being uh it's time to call three
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:14.920]  the world travel he could identify large numbers
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:20.440]  of international senate figures uh heads of state from europe high
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:24.280]  officials our state department department of dc
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:29.240]  uh uh figure from the fight has always been there

[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:43.160]  of the uh press so uh you know two heavy
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:47.880]  conscious raises the questions are are these uh
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:52.280]  distinguished people uh meeting in private
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.920]  why is there a secret why do they make this very meeting itself
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:01.160]  uh secret if i got through westwood tagler
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.680]  i was not raised i could be in the business for 30 years
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:08.600]  and not know who bill bergess and now you forced him to cover it uh let's
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:12.360]  shift gears here this is an election year that's when they were last here four
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:15.880]  years ago what is your latest intel because i know
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:19.400]  even for mid-level members they're not told until a few weeks before so you
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:23.320]  generally don't learn from your source until two weeks before so
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:27.400]  what is the intel you're getting so far if any jim on where the
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:33.240]  vaunted meeting is going to take place
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:37.400]  we'll put on our facebook page uh
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:43.160]  not wait for the newspaper uh just uh go to facebook page and get it the same
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:48.440]  day as we do so far uh it's extremely difficult the
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:53.000]  sources this is reliable for uh
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:00.280]  the last uh 15 to 20 years and being able to nail them because he is
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:03.560]  a bill berg policy he's a new national president here
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:07.400]  uh and he's talking to these people

[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:30.520]  and uh people still call these never been given the number

[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:42.280]  been shot at that was portugal when they shot at you correct
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:48.040]  yeah uh oh yeah in fact i remember i was checking
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:54.040]  into uh a little town with the birds being about 40 miles from
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.160]  Atlanta and of course always take the cheapest room
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:04.040]  possible it's always a smoking room uh
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:08.520]  save the company money and our adults settled in
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:13.160]  i get ready to settle in pulling my other pair of socks down the
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:18.440]  door then uh they came down to me said oh we put
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:23.720]  you in the wrong room your room is 135 not 125 or whatever
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:29.640]  so i got down there and uh
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:38.840]  and uh about an hour so uh two newspapers uh rolled back
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:45.560]  and a message is called uh somebody but to use a public phone not not them
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:52.360]  so i call this guy who's been a with the cia for a lot of years and was now a
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:58.840]  good friend and champion of exposing billaberg called you said uh
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:02.200]  your phone is by tap
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:08.760]  so uh so is your chair you pulled the uh microphones out of your chair
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:12.680]  but leaves them on the phone itself so they'll take it that you're completely
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:18.040]  booked but always remember when you're on that phone uh somebody's
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:21.640]  listening incredible now we've got uh mark
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:25.480]  anderson riding shotgun popping anytime mark you've got points you want to make
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:30.040]  so you have no intel right now on where it's going to be is what you're
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:33.800]  saying uh jim yes and as soon as we do we'll tell you
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:37.160]  well what do you think of them saying it's going to be
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:41.240]  hypha over in israel because i mean isn't it always every four years in
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:44.360]  north america or do they ever break with that sometimes
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:49.320]  not that he's looking for anything about this is real thing uh i kind of doubt it
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:53.720]  but i'm still trying to check it out uh
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.880]  what does your gut tell you i mean if they're going to be having uh the uh
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:02.600]  g8 summon at camp david and they're going to be having nato in chicago i mean
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:07.720]  don't they like to be in the u.s when there's a big election every four years
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:11.960]  well they don't tell it to elections because
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:17.000]  uh their orders are carried out anyway they own both horses of two horse
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.920]  race every since uh until
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:25.240]  it was since then after richard nixon their present
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.760]  after richard nixon's been a member of the trilateral commission of junior
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:35.880]  varsity before becoming president or vice president so in both parties
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:41.720]  so uh they always own as i said those horses of two
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:45.320]  horse race sure let me raise this point mark
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:50.280]  anderson are you still there yeah i i can chime in anytime i i do
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:53.640]  think that the every four years presidential race
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:58.280]  is a pretty good barometer and i think that uh despite all their pseudo
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:01.240]  sophistication these people are somewhat predictable
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:04.920]  i'd say it's a high likelihood it'll be in north america this year although not
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:09.080]  guaranteed um they trotted out barack obama
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:12.600]  n o8 and you know got there in primature on him
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:17.080]  i believe back in the early 90s they also trotted out the obscure arkansas
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:20.920]  governor bill clinton said will he do can we put him in the white house
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:25.640]  and everybody nodded and said sure uh a little gamey but we'll go with him
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:31.400]  and all that and so uh you know they do have to get somebody uh lined up for
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:34.680]  president that will get the nod at these chess players
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:38.440]  just like gordon brownard or or or tony blair or any of them or
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:43.320]  von rumpi of the e you what about this jim what about this point
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:47.000]  uh that a lot of times you know about trilateral commission meetings what
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.640]  have happened or bill berg steering uh do you have any intel on the last
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:55.160]  steering meeting and what is front and center
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:58.520]  on their agenda right now last time you got a snapshot
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:02.760]  uh can you give us that data point what's on their agenda
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:08.280]  i'll see you ask uh you jim okay uh
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:14.120]  their agenda remains uh a war with disrael
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:19.640]  uh with uh spending uh mostly american money
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:23.720]  and uh the military mostly american blood
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:29.400]  and uh backup type of things so uh
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:32.840]  uh good uh
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:38.920]  date this uh the ron leader is a
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:42.760]  is a bloody handed uh threat so we can
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:46.040]  guess the war but the country is this they are
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:49.080]  failing this way as they have the last several years
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.840]  they they didn't are trying to get this work going out far
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:58.200]  we're off this last bill berg meeting and they're failing this
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:05.240]  because there's uh uh growing public awareness i've said before
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:11.640]  last year in uh switzerland we had 1200 people there 200 of them were
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:15.480]  reporters either broadcast reporters or news paper reporters
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:26.120]  and uh uh chosen chosen loud and because the american patriots
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:31.320]  are uh very good about calling and writing their senators and congressmen
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:35.160]  now no senator congressman dares go for politically
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:40.840]  uh he won't say well oh he'll tell tell frankly he'll tell his
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:45.480]  bill berg but it's why he can't go but uh
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:06.840]  are really waking up jim how long do you think you're going to
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:09.560]  continue to be able to you know cover bill
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:12.760]  berger's you've done such an incredible job over the years i mean you've said
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:15.480]  in the past you'll never stop and i was talking to mark
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:19.560]  he said that you're healthier and got more energy than ever
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:23.080]  well i'm doing uh fine i just carry this cane
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:26.680]  long because i'm going to be that long and nice man
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:31.000]  so you're carrying a cane now huh well for the last two years
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.240]  in fact you have a lot of friends benefits
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:39.800]  when you go in the airport uh in the section where they
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:45.080]  uh invite couples in a very short line called their couples
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:48.200]  they give you a bill chair they push you around you tell them where your
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:51.560]  cane is they know exactly where it's going you don't have to
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:56.680]  float escalators do you like the tsa groping
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:00.920]  what's that you know how the tsa now likes to stick their hands down people's
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:04.840]  pants what do you think of that uh
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:11.320]  the outside was not bad so you don't like it yeah because
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:14.920]  uh what expense we should undertake is to get some toilet
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:21.560]  trained litter uh guards the airport the uh
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:25.480]  the day eight dollars an hour now which is uh
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:28.920]  below the minimum wage in those states so they get
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:34.040]  uh these illiterate donkeys and illiterate donkeys are more likely to
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:38.200]  try to uh couple uh
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:43.080]  to touch a woman's ear simply than uh the normal people well it's all part of
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:46.120]  teaching us you know the tsa's caught running sex
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:49.640]  rings pedophile rings i mean what do you expect uh
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:52.920]  jim anything else you think that we should know that's really important
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:56.120]  coming up anything you want to impart to the audience and the same thing to
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:00.440]  mr anderson well uh serve as i would say do not
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:04.520]  let up we have been winning we should celebrate our pictures
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:09.320]  uh did not be so overconfident this picture turns into
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.560]  defeat that's never stopped telling the uh
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:18.360]  our american politicians and state department people
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:22.360]  and other major departments like uh defense and treasury
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:25.880]  is always there well yeah because exposure is only one part of the equation
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:29.000]  we've got to keep exposing and then demand justice what do you think a core
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.240]  design stealing millions and getting away with it publicly
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:38.280]  um uh very unimpressed
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:42.200]  i think you can be uh uh smart but you also be
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:45.800]  uh couldn't be smart now both of you are going to be there this year regardless
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:49.720]  if it's in europe or if it's in timbuktu or if it's in the united states or

[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:57.880]  yes it would seem so uh you know of course that's always predicated on uh

[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:05.400]  like any other news organization things are kind of lean

[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:14.760]  nicholas burns told a uh the chicago counseling global affairs audience

[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:07.240]  we've got something to hide i mean here is another article about the tsa
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:12.120]  running giant prostitution rings you don't have to be a criminal sexual
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:16.520]  deviant to work for the tsa but it helps
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:22.600]  steve watson info wars dot com prostitution rings child pornography
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:26.920]  trashing hotel rooms and drunkenly firing guns
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:30.920]  a week in the life of tsa agents
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:36.360]  now i've watched this in russia linen and stalin did it hitler did it in
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:39.320]  germany mal did it they hire people right out of the
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:42.760]  prisons or street thugs because you can't go to the old military or regular
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:47.320]  spritakora the police and get them to just go into houses and shoot whole
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:51.240]  families you always create kind of a street
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:55.880]  security thug that's federal and then as the attacks expand
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:59.080]  then you start recruiting open criminals in
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:03.320]  i mean who else wants to rip colostomy bags off people and take baby diapers
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:06.600]  off and scream at people and again either folks that really need a job and
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:09.640]  that's some of them it's always like a nice tsa guy
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:12.840]  listen i don't really want to do this groping uh just can't you go on the
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:18.280]  scanner no all right let me call bob over bob comes over
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:22.040]  that's the person that so so the guy's like i'm sorry he just wants a job
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:25.080]  but then there's always the supervisor that's
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:30.360]  i got kids chained up the basement at home get ready for a proctology exam i
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:36.360]  mean that's basically what it is and i mean it's like every
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:40.360]  day there's like 20 crimes they're committing showing that the police and
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.600]  fbi aren't totally corrupt because they are at least busting them
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:48.280]  i mean the most criminal group in law enforcement
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:52.200]  because they're not even law enforcement they're not even sworn is the tsa
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:57:00.520]  then it's truancy officers you learn the crime statistics and then it's the atf
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:04.360]  and then it's big city chicago new york police
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:10.360]  miami police i'm going on the list here detroit police
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:14.040]  dallas police are pretty darn corrupt at the higher levels i mean look at crime
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:17.960]  statistics and then you get into the fbi and other people
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:21.400]  like that and it is it is creepy to know they're
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:24.840]  this criminal i mean chances are that person wants to
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:27.640]  grope your daughter and see i i can't fly with my children
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:31.000]  i cannot watch my four-year-old and seven-year-old daughters

[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:40.680]  there was one incident i'm not even getting into where it was tsa style
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:45.160]  checkpoints on the ground and uh nothing ended up happening so i don't
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:46.920]  even get into it because they could have really
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:49.480]  you know i could end up in some trouble over what i because i just couldn't
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:52.440]  handle it and they were so blown away by
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:57.000]  you know the king kong behavior that uh that they were just they were just like
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.640]  is shocked but i mean i just listen this is not an act way i act on air this is

[01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:37.160]  but uh when they start bringing me up you know i i'm gonna have to talk about it
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:41.480]  sure enough that's all that went on

[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:54.040]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:58.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:02.040]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:05.400]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:08.360]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:11.880]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:15.480]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:19.400]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:22.920]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:26.040]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:29.080]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:32.920]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar

[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:10.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:17.800]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:29.240]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:40.680]  alex jones
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:49.640]  ah man sick of it i'm gonna try to settle down in this hour
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:53.480]  after all the news i've read some of it i've covered on air the guests i've had
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:57.720]  on i just wish people had their basic human
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:01.000]  instinct to know when everybody's in danger
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.160]  and to know everybody's under attack you know the reason i more and more get
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:09.000]  into health and vitamin issues and mineral issues and wellness issues is
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.920]  because i've realized myself that that's one of the few
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:19.240]  areas where we can at least partially take charge
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:25.960]  that's one of the few areas where we can actually do something we can filter our
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:30.120]  water we can stop eating gmo at least reduce it
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:35.880]  a lot to harbour near on the road we can stop watching as much television and
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:40.920]  unplug from the matrix more and we can buy firearms to protect
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:44.360]  ourselves and we can meet like-minded people to develop
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:48.440]  groups of mutual aid i don't even call it a militia we
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:53.400]  everybody needs mutual aid alliances yet everybody needs a posse
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:58.840]  a civil defense the globalists don't want you to be self-sufficient
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:04.680]  and we need to defend the first amendment and defend liberty but on the
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:09.480]  subject of health i had raw some foods owner
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:14.440]  no criminal record million dollar bail for selling raw milk and papayas
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:18.280]  at a co-op that was a private club and i pointed it out
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:22.200]  people go to private clubs and drive nails into each other's bodies
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:25.240]  people under private agreement can chop each other's arms and legs off i don't
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:28.840]  want to get into gross stuff so you have a family audience and
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:31.960]  people don't really know about this but it's amputation is a very popular
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:35.960]  trendy thing to do uh that that all goes on
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:39.480]  under free association they got swingers clubs
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:44.200]  they got everything but you can't have places where you go
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:47.960]  buy people's potatoes they grew in their garden
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:54.120]  that the the soviets and the communists in china are the ones that do that
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:59.000]  i mean we're under agenda 21 here
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.440]  and i wanted to get dr cori gold on because i've had him on a couple times
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:05.800]  and have been impressed with his research impressed
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:10.920]  with his work and we're going to really introduce him after the
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.360]  break because some stations don't carry the short segment most of them do xm
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:18.600]  does or i think xm does i know they carry the show but
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:22.520]  i never have time to list them on show because it's live kind of be hard to do
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:25.720]  uh but um
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:28.200]  i've got all these things we could talk about him today we only got about a
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:30.840]  minute and a half we're going to break but what are some of the topics dr
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:33.720]  gold you want to bring up today i know i've got a laundry list
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:36.840]  well hey alex good to talk to you i mean right along with what you were talking
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:41.400]  about uh we have a story out of england where a think tank
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:45.560]  has come up with a conclusion that not only is abortion a great thing but
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:48.760]  people once are born three months four months five months six
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:51.320]  months old three years they don't have a right to life
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:53.880]  they don't have a right to life that just because you're born doesn't even
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:57.240]  title you to keep living and it's done out in the open
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:03:59.560]  oh no they're they're publishing their paper they're proud of it it's
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:02.680]  intellectual thought the brightest minds are back to our nazi
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:06.440]  germany was that just because you're born just because you're six months old
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:08.920]  you still don't have a right to life even though you've been born in our
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:12.520]  breathing and by the way that is how it started in nazi germany was medical
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:16.520]  tyranny for those that don't know no you're right and
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:19.400]  now they're talking more about what things you can and can't put into your
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:22.680]  body pharmaceuticals are terrific but hey wait a second
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:26.920]  you know you don't get to know what's gmo it's why why would they not tell us
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:30.280]  what foods contain gmo isn't in our best interest to know and yeah let's talk
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:32.520]  about that because for those that don't know
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:36.120]  they're moving to where you can't know if it's gmo and they want to restrict

[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:23.000]  one of the areas where we can actually take control of our lives to a great
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.760]  extent there's the aluminum to oxide kim trailing and barium and
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:32.760]  all that there's the electromagnetic stuff they're doing to us and
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:35.720]  every week somebody's girlfriend in the office
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:40.600]  or one of their friends there's like 35 25 40 gets cancer i mean i look at the
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:44.760]  numbers 2000 plus percent for adults increase on average
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:49.480]  the last 40 50 years and look at the numbers and some child cancers are up
[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:53.640]  over 10 000 percentage points i mean it's a devastation
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:56.840]  and they're doing it to us i got all the rocker feller foundation documents
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:00.200]  every day we're posting more articles with just all the admissions how they're
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:05.160]  doing it to us i mean just total evil out in the open jacking the food to water
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:08.680]  they're now in prestigious medical journals saying kill babies up to age
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:13.400]  three bill gates comes out and says kill grandma
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:17.560]  he says don't get grandma care we can hire 10 teachers the teachers clap
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:20.280]  he says death panels i've played the clip like 50 times
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:23.720]  you're a new listener don't say oh that's not true
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:27.080]  just like a month ago paul watson first saw the big prestigious
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:29.960]  you know journal of bioethics they don't have the epocratic oath anymore
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:33.560]  they just the bioethicists say what we do
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:36.280]  and i've had wall street journal writers on where for decades they've already
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:38.680]  been killing people who are wards of the state who are healthy
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:43.480]  they just chain you down and kill you this is already going on as the point
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:47.080]  but people emailed me and said this isn't true the watson had links to it
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:49.960]  they're not saying kill babies just gotta be a joke and then once it was in the
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:53.560]  mainstream news picked up from us it was like wow that's
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:57.640]  well maybe it maybe it's needed first it's oh kill them up to the birth
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:00.760]  well china kills the match they're born maybe that's reasonable how about to age
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:04.360]  three so you were getting into that in the short little segment dr gold
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:08.440]  and then i want to get into how they don't want us to know if stuff's gmo
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:15.000]  the attacks on the amish i mean this is crazy even for me they're moving fast
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.600]  and if they're moving this fast what are they getting us ready for
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:22.600]  dr corrigold break it down it seems like everything's turning into a cost
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:27.240]  benefit analysis as opposed to do no harm it's well who's got value
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:30.520]  and they're putting value on human life we've seen this happen before in nazi
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:33.160]  germany when they said oh gypsies don't have value
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:36.600]  homosexuals don't have values jews don't have values therefore they don't have
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:39.480]  right to life in fact it'd be better for society if they just were
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:43.080]  disappearing and you know just pretend those places don't exist we're
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:47.400]  making the world a better place we got away from that and here we are again
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:52.040]  where first we got into abortion being considered to be a healthy thing and a
[02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:55.320]  societal positive thing they tell you that you are narrow minded and don't
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:59.640]  like society if you think abortions bad now these great think tanks of these
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:02.440]  people who consider themselves to be quite elite
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:05.880]  are telling us that well newborns do they really have a right to life does
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:09.320]  someone get born with a right to life and if they're so young and they can't
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:13.400]  take care of themselves would it be okay and moral uh to kill them and then
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:17.480]  it's a very small leap to well old people can they take care of themselves is
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:21.000]  there a cost benefit of what are they providing are they still
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.080]  providing positive things for society does somebody actually have a heart and
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:29.320]  soul in this whole matter the answers no it's it's it's turn into an elitist
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:35.880]  who has a right who has value continue and and you can take this a lot
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:39.960]  farther because eventually if a lie is told long enough eventually becomes
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:42.040]  true they've heard this over and over again
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:46.440]  so we people in china accept one child policy is a
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:50.600]  is a normal societal thing and if you are a loyal member of the
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:54.040]  communist party in china you don't question what you're hearing in china
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:58.120]  that one child is the right way to go we've had politicians here even uh was
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:01.080]  it joe biden i believe i could be wrong but i think it's joe biden who said
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:04.360]  well the one child policy it's right for china it's not a bad thing he didn't
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:07.240]  criticize it you know that's what i would do was like what are you kidding me
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:10.200]  you're going to tell people they can only have one child you're going to
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:13.240]  you know make infants side okay well it's okay for them
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:18.440]  how is murder okay for a huge and so now that we accept that okay we're going to
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:22.280]  kill your babies here in fact it's admitted i mean i remember 10 years ago
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:24.920]  talking about china selling political dissidents organs
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:31.480]  it was admitted china advertised it it was in european news the mobile
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:35.960]  execution vans and naive americans living in their bubble would call me and say i
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:39.800]  was a liar because the internet wasn't as ubiquitous so most of them wouldn't go
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:45.320]  check it now it's known dr. gold as you are pointing out
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:51.640]  and china admits they go and find people hiding already born babies and put them
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:55.640]  in a bucket of water and and plant parenthood supporters are
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:59.400]  defending that and there's the there's the tapes where you can call it plant
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:02.840]  parenthood and say i want to give money to kill black babies i might give us the
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:05.720]  money i got margaret singer photos with the clan
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:09.880]  saying kill blacks but she's held by liberals these high-level liberals are
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:14.520]  not liberals they are eugenicist the real racist
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:18.920]  do not the real evil control freaks it's it's beyond racism
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:23.320]  don't come out and wear a clan uniform they pose as a liberal can you speak to
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:27.240]  that well yeah in fact i have a couple people who i considered to be friends
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:31.640]  they went to the best schools and if you talk about value of human life
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:34.680]  they look at you like you're crazy because where they went to school they
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:37.800]  were taught to think that first off if you believe in god you've got to be a
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:41.480]  crazy person to believe of a a smiling face in the sky who knows what you
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:43.720]  think and you're not you're nice it's a fairy tale
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:47.000]  so those people who put trust into god and think of themselves as being god
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.120]  fearing and whatever religion they follow they think of those people as
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:54.520]  being feeble minded and that it is really people who put value on
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:57.560]  things and we as a society should decide what has value
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:01.160]  and not have value and no one has any innate
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:04.360]  human rights to to life liberty or the things that
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:09.000]  were the founding values of our country and yet they'll look at you and say
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.640]  no poor cori he's just so naive to think that
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:15.720]  there's a god and to think that he has you know value before god and to think
[02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:20.200]  that people have a right to life you know that's such a naive old
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:23.720]  you know kind of like you know thinking of like mayan temple way of thinking
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:26.840]  you're still in the old thought and they think that people who might have a gun
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:29.640]  of course you also you must be a mass murderer and
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:34.120]  if somebody has a bible they must be narrow minded and must be very
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:38.760]  not too smart because in their world if you have those belief systems of being
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:43.560]  independent of being self determining of taking care of you and your family
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:47.400]  of you know being entrepreneurial you're not a collectivist you're a threat
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:50.200]  you're not a team player you're not a team player a team player says what's
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:52.760]  best for the collective not what is right
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:56.600]  well expanding on that reading into deeper globalist documents
[02:15:56.600 --> 02:16:01.240]  they are are spiritual at the top they believe they're basically god
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:04.600]  and they want to control this planet and they don't want other people
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:08.360]  saying no i have a right to determine my own future so i want to say something
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:10.680]  to atheist if you want to be an atheist or
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:13.800]  diagnostic that's your issue i get it that
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:17.240]  mainline religions a joke glitter bugs on tv begging for money
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:20.280]  i get all that but what i'm saying to them is
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:25.000]  the the collectivist globalist advertise themselves as humanists but
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.240]  they're not really trying to empower humanity
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:30.600]  through the eugenics they're actually going after
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:33.880]  people that they see as the uncontrolled mavericks
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:38.920]  and they want the state to be god and that's why they don't want you
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:41.960]  individually to be able to determine what you believe
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:47.080]  and what's valuable to you they want you to say do what we say so it's not even
[02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:50.440]  the community is going to determine you know what we say is valuable
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:53.640]  they're going to say it well they've already said we're crud
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:57.800]  well i'm here to tell them i'm not crud and somebody that doesn't appreciate
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:01.000]  life and somebody that doesn't understand you've got to protect the week
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.880]  and somebody that doesn't have those instincts they're the ones that are
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:07.640]  screwed up and i declare war on them doctor
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:10.280]  well and you think about it you know now we're talking i was listening to the
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:14.200]  supreme court arguments for the health mandate that the government can
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:17.880]  mandate you to buy something and i heard justice glia say well what's next
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:22.040]  they're going to mandate you buy broccoli and you know people laughed
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:25.160]  and i heard commentators going well why couldn't the government mandate you by
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:29.880]  broccoli it's good for you so in that vein if this goes through
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:33.320]  what can't the government tell you to do if they think it's good for you can
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:37.240]  they tell you where to live can they say i just saw him during a break we have
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:41.400]  it on back there was saying yeah we do need the government to
[02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:45.160]  tell us what to do right you know we can tell you what job you
[02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:48.200]  be best at we can tell you where you might want to live
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:50.920]  right now the government's you know giving most people loans they give most
[02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:54.600]  people health they give most people you know
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:57.560]  education they give most people food when the government when you're beholden
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:01.800]  to the government for food housing education your job
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:06.280]  are you really free and even if you're quote independent and have your own
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:08.840]  farm if you don't pay that property tax they're going to take it
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:13.000]  you're paying a rent we didn't have property tax until 60 years ago
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:17.080]  again we had real freedom before you know they've gotten rid of some injustices
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:21.080]  but brought in a whole another set of them yeah and they assume if you're not
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:23.800]  for universal health care that you want people to die in the streets but just
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:26.920]  the opposite people weren't dying on the streets i mean there were
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:30.520]  religious run hospitals there were charitable foundations taking care of
[02:18:30.520 --> 02:18:33.720]  people in the local community people were being taken care of by people in
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:36.200]  their own area when you were in dental school they told
[02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:39.800]  you you had to do what 30% of your stuff for free my dad was taught the same
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:42.600]  thing that's why he does it now others don't do it
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:47.160]  so he gets a line around the block of folks it's incredible go ahead
[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:50.600]  well most people want to help other people if they're able to and that
[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:54.440]  includes doctors and dentists and you know people who own restaurants and
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:58.120]  most people do the right things most people have a conscious and try to do
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:00.840]  the right things within the best of their ability but when the government
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:04.920]  takes on all the roles is telling you you know Cory Alex you don't have to be
[02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:07.720]  that guy to help other people you don't even have to be the person to take care
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:10.280]  of yourself or your children the government will take care of all those

[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:04.440]  dr. corey gold is our guest i want to get back into health issues in ways we
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:07.720]  can from your research i mean you're a triathlete
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:11.160]  whole nine yards you've seen amazing things as a dentist
[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:14.920]  that the medical system won't tell the people that they know
[02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:18.040]  most doctors are ignorant but the the higher ups know
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:22.520]  but the whole india thing i mean i see americans buying five million guns a
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:25.640]  month the previous record was something like a million and a half
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:28.760]  in questionnaires they say they think the government's evil
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:32.200]  and that there's going to be a collapse and i don't like go who they're buying
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:35.320]  guns wonderful we'll have some big war it'll be like a movie
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:40.280]  no no the globalists actually may want this civil war but
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:45.400]  i'm not having anybody take my kids anywhere i'm not taking inoculations
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:49.480]  i'd per and again i'm somebody on the air to 15 million people
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:54.520]  making real statements here and it's sick that i've had to get to the point
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:58.040]  where everything i thought that was going to happen has been confirmed in
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:01.160]  spades and it's it's one thing to know it
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:04.520]  intellectually now it's manifesting you talk about
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:08.680]  nazi germany or soviet russia i mean we're following exactly
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:13.880]  and it's so creepy uh dr gold i mean what do you do whenever you see them
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:17.400]  saying shut down vitamin mineral companies arrest people disappear people
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:20.840]  and using the drug war apparatus and racketeering
[02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:24.840]  against vitamin and mineral people and arresting amish and you know trying to
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:28.920]  put them in jail for 40 years i mean this is savage criminals
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:31.960]  yeah it was interesting last night i was watching the supreme court
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:35.800]  testimony yet again and one of the justices says doesn't say
[02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:40.040]  that act of discretion of the secretary that they could do all these horrible
[02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:42.120]  things and then the other guy said yeah but that
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:46.040]  discretion we're not really going to do it but they have the ability to do it
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:49.080]  it's written into the laws they have the ability at their discretion is that on
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:52.840]  the patriot act obama says india a i won't do it now they're
[02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:56.440]  starting right and then so the other justice as well if they do it then of
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:00.280]  course you can re-litigate it meanwhile what's happened in between and you know
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:03.800]  so now we have to re-litigate so they they write in powers into laws that of
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:07.160]  course will never use these powers so one of the other justice says well why
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:10.040]  don't you just remove it he said well i don't want to say we'll never use it
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:13.000]  oh so they so oh there you go so if you have
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:16.040]  something in your bill it says at your discretion you can do horrible things
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:18.280]  they're snakes there's a reason it's there
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:21.240]  there's a reason it's there and now you're talking about people disappearing
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:25.240]  because for your good alex and my good certain people
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:28.840]  might be horrible they haven't been charged with being horrible
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:32.120]  and all of a sudden they disappear and there's no time frame for them to have
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:34.760]  to be charged let's use some number and i want your
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:38.280]  take on this but i've studied world war two in depth i kind of got into it when
[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:41.560]  i was a teenager and then in college probably read over a hundred books just
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:44.920]  on the european theater and the ss and the rest of it because it was so
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:48.360]  interesting historically i read the declassified british wartime
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:52.680]  reports the mind of atall fitler all of it when i read mine comp i really wanted
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:56.040]  to understand it and then moved on i was always been a big history person
[02:27:56.040 --> 02:28:01.800]  i want people to know around 15 percent or so of the gestapo they'd send out
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:04.680]  to grab people even though europeans were pretty submissive compared to
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:08.600]  americans on average never came back okay and this is not going to be like
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:12.680]  russia where you know almost no one resisted the
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:17.560]  nkvd do they think they're going to start all this
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:20.920]  and not end up like swiss cheese i mean i mean do they really think they're just
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:23.560]  going to start arresting people and disappearing them
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:27.320]  and then the next person is going to know that they i mean that's going to
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:30.920]  create an escalation with law enforcement
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:35.160]  that is going to be horrific i mean i mean
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:38.360]  does the system realize what they're being put into dr gold
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:42.280]  i don't think the system does and a lot of its incrementalism which is
[02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:45.560]  okay well we got away with this so we'll do a little bit more but we'll do it in
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:48.440]  extreme case we go well that was a really bad guy
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:52.200]  there therefore i can understand why you grabbed that really bad guy
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:55.800]  well we can kill americans who are in other countries without
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:59.320]  even search warrants or giving them any you know papers or anything
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:02.040]  because they were real bad guys they were terrorists we sent drones over to kill
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:04.600]  them they asked they asked the government could
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:07.960]  we do that in america we thought we had a real bad guy in america could we just
[02:29:07.960 --> 02:29:11.080]  often without think well yeah it's possible we could do that here in america
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:14.200]  but only with really really really bad terrible people
[02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:16.840]  well now we've incrementalism now the government can kill somebody without
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:20.440]  warrant here in the united states what comes next everything's incrementalism
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:26.120]  well you accept that what's next look i mean they're open in pandora's box and
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:29.480]  the bankers are going to sit offshore and laugh at all this
[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:33.880]  i mean i mean i everybody's having to think now
[02:29:33.880 --> 02:29:39.000]  okay they'll say they'll disappear us and the guns are all being sold off the
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:42.360]  shelves i mean look new world order you're not
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:45.720]  doing this in the dark everybody knows what you're doing
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:48.600]  and if you strike me down everybody knows what you're doing
[02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:51.880]  well they're right back with dr. gold stay with us we're on the march
[02:29:51.880 --> 02:30:01.160]  the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:05.480]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why
[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:08.680]  even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving and my
[02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:13.080]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:16.360]  crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized world
[02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:20.040]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[02:30:20.040 --> 02:30:24.360]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves

[02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:28.600]  by the way as i tell you many times every month
[02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:32.120]  don't take the internet and the freedom that's left there for granted
[02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:36.760]  use it or lose it you keep it free by using it but you also use it like
[02:33:36.760 --> 02:33:39.720]  you're not going to have it in the future you got that
[02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:43.080]  it's kind of like mama spent two hours making you
[02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:49.480]  the best biscuits and dumplings it takes hours to make you better eat it
[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:53.800]  when it comes out hot because it dumplings aren't that good warm
[02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:58.120]  back up later not good ones same thing with fried
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:00.520]  chicken
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:05.960]  and to use the food analogy here i just
[02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:09.560]  it's a nightmare and you know my wife sits there and says to me she says
[02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:12.840]  you know people were the same way in germany and the same way in russia
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:16.680]  they kept saying oh we'll beat it and you know everything our families here and
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:19.960]  everything's here and she's like i'm not saying we should leave but we should
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:23.400]  look at it and i've actually said well whatever
[02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:27.720]  happens we're just staying here because i just can't give in to the fear
[02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:33.960]  but i understand her as a woman in a way you do win if you get away
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:37.240]  i mean i just can't believe the american people
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:39.880]  sure if they're buying five million guns a month and saying it's for the
[02:34:39.880 --> 02:34:44.440]  government but i mean why why do we have to
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:47.560]  have the government say they're gonna because that's government back bioethics
[02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:49.720]  group they're gonna kill three-year-olds that are even
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:52.600]  healthy they've skipped oh let's just kill people that aren't
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:55.960]  healthier we're gonna kill babies
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:35:00.440]  and i get the the government training manuals and it's all about how
[02:35:00.440 --> 02:35:04.360]  they're calling sovereign citizens people that have gardens now
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:07.800]  and people that are into minerals and vitamins that's an extremist group now
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:11.000]  that's what they were telling the rossom foods guy like your anti-government
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.880]  you're and he's like well i'm kind of like a liberal i'm not in it i just
[02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:18.920]  want to have a food co-op million dollar bail
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:24.920]  it's good people are the enemy have you figured that out yet
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:28.040]  i want to get into some solutions because one area we can fight back is
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:31.960]  taking care of our bodies and there are powerful tools out there while
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:35.320]  you can still use them dr corrigold from your deep
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:39.720]  research the amazing results you've gotten
[02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:43.480]  and all the products you developed run down the main things people can do
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:47.240]  immediately whether it's moderate exercise deep
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:51.080]  breathing of vitamin c what can cleanse you i mean
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:55.000]  you know the top 10 things you've got the floor
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:59.240]  it will go ahead and you mentioned a few go ahead but you okay we're back i
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:02.360]  think well you mentioned a few right there first off you you talked about
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:06.040]  water earlier in the show the more what you know a lot of
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:08.840]  the things that people point their body even if they taste good or bad for them
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:11.960]  so i i i you have a colon now and then but the
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:15.160]  more clean pure water you can drink the better
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:18.120]  and people have been told they don't need to drink much actually they need to
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:22.440]  drink quite a bit so a lot of water in your body flush toxins out how much give
[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:27.320]  me a number give me a number oh my gosh i would take four to five
[02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:30.600]  water bottles eight eight eight ounce water balls a day at least 40 ounces of
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:33.640]  water a day if not more and it sounds like a lot for people who've
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:36.360]  never done it but it's just replacing those things
[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:39.240]  since i started taking your advice to you because it's so important
[02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:42.840]  i drink like two or three glasses and i guess once you're dehydrated your body
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:45.400]  isn't thirsty once you start drinking water
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:49.160]  it was like being a kid again in football practice when i really enjoyed it
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:53.240]  now i'm just guzzling it and want more more
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:56.840]  well what happens is is that when your body doesn't have water it tends to
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:36:59.880]  retain the water but your body your water's got to flush through your system
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:03.400]  it's designed to move things through your system so if you're not giving your
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:06.520]  body enough water it it retains it in a certain way it
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:10.280]  doesn't go through a normal journals so you need to actually have more water
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:13.960]  lots of water be pure water don't you know i'm not a big fan of tap water so i
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:17.080]  have your water purified get all the toxins out some
[02:37:17.080 --> 02:37:20.840]  water districts put things into the water for whatever reason they say it's good
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:24.200]  for you i'm a believer that if i wanted my body i'll add it myself
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:28.440]  so i like pure clean water and i like lots of it and once your body gets used
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:32.200]  to it you're right it craves it it doesn't crave it now because it's taking
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:34.680]  colas and other things that are replacements of
[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:38.360]  that your body thinks are better than it's not water's far better and the more
[02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:41.960]  you have the more you'll want it another thing your body can do
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:47.800]  is have organic you know clean raw vegetables and closer grown to you the
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:50.440]  better so you talk about people growing their own vegetables
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:53.240]  that that's the best you know you're you're picking it you're eating it right
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:55.800]  away you know it's been taken care of correctly
[02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:59.720]  it's it hasn't lost all its minerals most of the food that you're getting in
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:02.360]  the stores has been shipped in from sometimes
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:06.040]  thousands of miles away sometimes boated over from south america
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:09.560]  a lot of hormones and other things have been put in fluoride's been sprayed on
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:13.160]  it as a pesticide the list goes on and on it's been
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:17.000]  radiated in many cases in a lot of cases it's by the time it
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:20.120]  gets you just doesn't have it may have the right color and sometimes it's even
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:22.600]  put under colored light so it looks better in the store
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:25.640]  but when you get at home you're just eating kind of empty calories and
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:29.240]  you're wondering why am i so hungry a lot of people in united states are obese
[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:32.200]  but they're eating an awful lot and one of the reasons they're eating an awful
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:35.080]  lot is they're still starving so they're heavy people
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:39.160]  who are starving for nutrition because the food they're eating
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:43.080]  is devoid of nutrition and if you think of these dollar menus and i'm
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:46.200]  you know it's not that i've never gone through one i have but the things they
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:49.240]  put in the dollar menus because people don't have a lot of money
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:53.160]  are things basically devoid of nutrition but having a lot of calories
[02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:56.440]  so they're eating all these starches and they're gaining all this weight
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:38:59.800]  they're putting on adipose and fat but they're not gaining nutrition
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:03.480]  so they're becoming osteoporitic they're having trouble thinking you know
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:07.480]  they're not have they can't have energy they're becoming lethargic they want
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:10.600]  to become couch potatoes because the food they're eating
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:14.280]  so you've got to be eating high nutrient foods
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:18.360]  and you've got to be getting rid of all those just no fake carbohydrates that
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:21.480]  people are eating so those are two or three of the things you can do
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:25.240]  i'm a big believer in supplementation and i believe that
[02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:28.040]  we're not getting all the foods from our diets even if we're doing our very
[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:31.400]  best so i take a broad spectrum of nutrition
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:35.320]  that's why we put together the alex pack is one of the things we present on
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:38.440]  infowarsteam.com because it has the vitamins it
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:42.200]  has the trace minerals it has the omega oils it has the calcium
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:45.640]  magnesium it has the whole host of things that people need
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:49.240]  because your body just doesn't need two or three nutrients because some
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:52.680]  you know you get things that says this has extra calcium extra calcium is
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:55.640]  great but without magnesium it's not going to work very well
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:59.240]  and with vitamin d it even works better the whole body works better when it's
[02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:03.240]  getting a complete spectrum of trace minerals your body wasn't designed just
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:06.280]  to run on one or two nutrients it was designed to have a whole
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:10.840]  chemistry set put in each day. Now expanding on that it's
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:15.240]  i always like some vegetables that were cooked i like salads things like that
[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:19.000]  but now not that i'm in great shape but i've lost right at 40 pounds now
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:22.840]  and just the last four or five months now that
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:26.840]  i started making myself eat big salads and making myself
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:31.160]  just eat you know a whole raw um green pepper
[02:40:31.160 --> 02:40:35.240]  now that i make myself get into eating carrots and things now i'm getting to
[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:38.680]  crave it so back when i you know was eating mainline
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:42.440]  cruddy food and and like 10 years ago even fast food and stuff
[02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:46.760]  uh i would i would want that because it had chemicals and things into it that
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:49.880]  my brain was tuned to but now that i'm slowly
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:53.800]  segwayed away from all that it's accelerating
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:57.160]  so people think oh i'm in such horrible shape oh it's so bad
[02:40:57.160 --> 02:41:01.160]  i'll never dig out of this hole that's not what i'm finding
[02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:04.840]  it's like once you train yourself back to what's good
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:09.400]  and it's a battle uh but but it gets easier the more you do so
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:13.480]  how do you recommend people start that that journey
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:16.600]  well it's first off they i don't expect people to make
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:20.360]  huge changes all at once i expect people to make segmented changes
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:26.200]  um bite size steps i add add drink more water is a great first step carry a
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:29.560]  water bottle water with you everywhere you go and every time you have an urge
[02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:32.600]  to drink a soda or something that's carbonated or something
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:36.280]  that's you know looks like it's sweet and just drink water instead your body
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:39.400]  will start loving water you started talking about eating salads
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:43.000]  if you start chew your food more it'll actually taste
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.880]  better those those those vegetables have
[02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:49.080]  my dad always told me that he'd say chew your food
[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:52.840]  chew that green beans you know chew that squash
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:56.520]  that's when the like i've always want sugar on my cereal
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:00.520]  and as a child he'd make me chew it and we get sweet and i was like oh
[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:04.760]  and now i've shown my kids that but it just we're never taught any of this
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:08.120]  common sense right and for people most people
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:12.840]  are deficient in omega oils are called efa's essential fatty acids the vast
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:15.240]  majority of people are deficient in efa's
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:18.760]  so their body seeks french fries their body seeks pizza
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:23.000]  their body seeks um other things that have that oils in them that have been
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.360]  fried because it needs the oils it needs the efa's
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:29.960]  it's seeking the wrong thing so if you get your body some efa's
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:34.200]  it will not want those things anymore in fact sometimes now i look at
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:38.120]  commercials for fast food and i actually go oh i can tell you when i was 20 i go
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:41.240]  wow look at that that those nachos look fantastic nowadays i'm going oh that
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:44.280]  makes me sick to even look at them because my body's getting the omega
[02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:47.240]  oil so it's not looking for that and that's one of the reasons that's part
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:51.560]  of the alex pack is we put the omega oils in and what's funny is that people
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:54.840]  don't understand they're things called trace minerals they come from plants
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:58.360]  and your body was designed to get all these trace minerals
[02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:00.840]  but now in most of the foods you're eating or a lot of the foods you're
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:03.640]  eating they're not there anymore because the soils are just so
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:06.920]  denuded they've been so hate these were but raped
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:10.200]  over they haven't been good soil management and there's been pesticides
[02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:13.320]  sprayed into everything they're not fallow they put the pesticide that kills
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:16.920]  the microbes this is mainline science they've known this for 50 years and
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:19.560]  really been worried about it so then they use chemicals and
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:24.360]  fertilizers that are designed to grow in dead soils so it's not even what the
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:27.160]  plants are really supposed to even look like or
[02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:31.240]  taste like it's a specially engineered garbage
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:35.480]  well when you think the concept of gmo's genetically modified organisms
[02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:39.320]  um they're designed to be immune to all these things that
[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:43.080]  you have to have something crazy going on to be immune from bugs eating them or
[02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:45.800]  bugs dying when they eat them so i'm kind of concerned
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:49.160]  personally about putting gmo's into my system and i'm pretty upset with my
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:53.560]  government for making it unavailable for me to know what foods have gmo's
[02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:56.760]  you know i tell folks about that and we've had lawsuits
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:01.560]  were big organic milk companies i mean the ones that are homogenizing and
[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:03.320]  boiling it and all that you know in the grocery store
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:07.480]  they've been sued by monsanto and others because they don't want them putting
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:11.160]  a sign on it saying we don't have hormone or gmo
[02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:15.160]  i mean they're suing not just government but private groups don't
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:19.240]  want you to know what you're getting and you have to ask why
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:23.240]  because you figure if somebody just says without gmo's
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:25.640]  what harm would that be somebody could go into the store and say oh that
[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:29.080]  doesn't have gmo's that does have gmo's this one's not even saying
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:31.880]  it's bad for you it's just saying it doesn't have it and they're they don't
[02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:35.560]  want you to know that because innately you would say genetically modified i
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:38.600]  i'd rather have the non genetically modified thing please
[02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:42.120]  so how can they sell you something if you would prefer the other
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:46.600]  it's cheaper for them to make it gmo and they can call patents on
[02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:50.440]  the things that we eat every day will now be patented is that a patented potato
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:54.040]  is that a patented strawberry did you pay your toll tax on that patented thing
[02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:57.000]  it's amazing to think that they want to patent what we're currently eating and
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:00.280]  people were eating you know five you know two thousand three thousand years ago
[02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:03.000]  they're not going to patent them because they somehow genetically modified that
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.840]  and that's the same and then they infect your stuff as they've done with canola
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:11.160]  and then sue you and admit in court they infected you but it's still a patent
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:14.280]  infringement that one percent of the genetics of your canola
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:17.960]  or your soybean is theirs and then that's the same thing with vitamins doctor
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:22.200]  tell them how they're openly now patenting a manipulated vitamin c or
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:26.600]  a manipulated fish oil then trying to block you getting the $5 bottle
[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:30.920]  and trying to make you buy a $200 bottle well it's a old saying called follow the
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:33.960]  money there are now these prescription omega oils
[02:45:33.960 --> 02:45:36.920]  you know i remember my my father would tell me his mother would give him cod
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:40.440]  liver oil or give him like anchovies and i go oh how gross
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:43.080]  she was giving him omega oils that's where they come from that's omega
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:46.760]  threes that's where they come from so nowadays we have omega oil
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:50.520]  you know capsules they're terrific they're molecularly screened to have bad
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:53.560]  things out of them you're just getting the the omega threes
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:56.600]  and people can take them without having to have the fish taste
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:45:58.920]  and now they're saying wait a second we're not sure you should have those
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:03.720]  we now have a pharmaceutical version that costs you know 50 $100 a month
[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:07.240]  when there's a $10 $20 version that really works really well and
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:12.520]  has never hurt anybody to my knowledge and it gives great service to people
[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:16.120]  so follow the money trails when the farmers companies get involved exactly
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:19.480]  and if they can ban raw milk and papayas
[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:23.880]  they can ban anything i mean even forbs ask why is there a war against lemonade
[02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:26.840]  stands because they don't want any mom and pops it's
[02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:31.480]  that simple this is a corporatocracy global government
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:34.840]  yeah and you know so i i'm a big believer in getting what i can
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:38.680]  into my body to help my body work my body was created
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:42.840]  and it has a wonderful self-correction mechanism that i don't understand and
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:46.280]  doctors are just basically just scratching the surface of understanding
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:49.320]  but when it's given the right nutrition you can do pretty marvelous things to
[02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:52.040]  fix itself it's not it's not it's not
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:55.560]  completely perfect but it can do amazing things so you want to feed it and give
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:59.160]  it the ingredients it needs to do its job the right way
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:02.200]  and those are the vitamins and the minerals and the
[02:47:02.200 --> 02:47:06.280]  omega oils and the basic things that come from plant derived sources
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:09.800]  like we put into the alex pack that we put it all together like a bowl around
[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:14.840]  at the basic unique basic starting points
[02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:19.000]  i'm i'm just here marveling at what you're saying doc
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:23.400]  uh expanding on all of this this is a win-win-win
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:27.880]  um i have shown people they've seen me lose right at 40 pounds
[02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:31.320]  they've seen Aaron lose almost 90 he kept saying 80 and i said how much is it
[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:33.720]  really he goes well it's embarrassing but a couple
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:38.520]  pounds short of 90 he's a new person uh and he was
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:42.040]  literally leaving work every day i told him if you wanted to go ahead i was
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:45.080]  for his health he was going to personal trainers he was
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:49.320]  trying to walk and jog he was torturing himself not eating
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:52.760]  and then ted anderson got on young jevity
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:57.640]  i got some he started taking in he heard ben fuchs now he you know it hurts you
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:00.440]  he got into it he did it he's like this is like magic
[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:03.480]  and he and he really has done it more than i have i mean i've just started
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:06.120]  taking the tangent hingerine a little bit of the efa's
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:09.640]  stuff like rebound pollen burst but he went whole hog
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:14.520]  on young jevity and and i'm about to do it it's just i'm so untrained to be doing
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:18.680]  this i'm used to just eating eating but i do eat about half of what i ate
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:21.800]  he's i've lost 40 pounds he's lost almost 90
[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:26.040]  and it's like magic and yeah it's a business we support ourselves
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:28.840]  i'm risking my life here to bring in this information i want to build a news
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:32.200]  organization so yeah i'm selling vitamins and minerals but i went out
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:36.680]  and found stuff that is the best out there info wars team
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:40.520]  dot com you can also sign up for 10 bucks and get discounts and become a
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:43.720]  distributor again info wars team dot com there's a there's a phone number
[02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:47.000]  there there's weekly training uh phone calls it's all there but
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:50.680]  bottom line just try the tangent hingerine just try
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:54.760]  things like that because it's amazing how depleted we are and these synthetic
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:58.680]  minerals that just go through us this is the real natural minerals
[02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:03.000]  info wars team dot com but it isn't hype i mean my mother
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:07.320]  has lost a ton of weight it's not even advertises weight loss she's a triathlete
[02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:10.120]  she says my gosh i was already taking vitamins and stuff
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:13.400]  why is this she's asking why is tangy tangerine
[02:49:13.400 --> 02:49:16.520]  just the one thing she's taking that and now essential fatty acids
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:20.760]  why is that having such an incredible uh effect on her whether running or
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:24.200]  swimming all of it well she's already in great
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:26.920]  shape so she's already done a lot of good things and this
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:30.120]  her body can quickly respond and get better
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:33.400]  think of your body as a chemistry set if you're missing a couple test tubes it
[02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:37.240]  can only do so much you give a couple of things that your body's been deficient
[02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:40.200]  in and all of a sudden it starts popping on all cylinders it's like fine
[02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:42.200]  tuning a car so all of a sudden your mom who's
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:45.480]  been doing a lot of good things now gets those few things she's been missing
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:47.640]  and boom she's like firing on all pistons in
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:51.400]  way she goes a guy like erin dykes once his system starts
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:54.840]  working the way it used to work remember how we used to feel when we were 13
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:57.800]  14 15 i would run around the yard like all day long
[02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:01.080]  and come in like only when it got dark i would never get tired we just run around
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:04.680]  play all day exactly from sun up to sundown like crazed
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:07.400]  heathen yeah it's like and it's like i would just go
[02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:10.440]  on the front yard and play we had we didn't have you know set rules we just
[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:13.880]  ran around and played because our bodies just had all those natural chemicals
[02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:16.440]  running in them that let us go play and have fun
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:20.040]  and also our parents you know they gave us good food our food was grown locally
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:23.960]  that grandmother made them take the cod liver the spoon full you got it
[02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:28.680]  mama knew best they did a lot of this wisdom that we got from our
[02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:32.680]  ancestors was not silly a lot of the things that we now look back at and
[02:50:32.680 --> 02:50:34.760]  saying where'd that come from it comes from good
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:38.840]  good sound advice eating your cod liver oil we eat EFA's instead but it's the
[02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:42.760]  right thing to do amazing info wars team.com is also
[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:45.320]  a phone number on there but i guess people that aren't online that doesn't
[02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:48.280]  help them i'll always forget the number we'll look it up and have it for you

[02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:07.720]  amount of food i was eating i was lifting weights and jogging but nothing
[02:51:07.720 --> 02:51:10.760]  was working my body was literally starving for
[02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:15.080]  minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as i had that
[02:51:15.080 --> 02:51:18.840]  i immediately could eat half of what i was eating previously
[02:51:18.840 --> 02:51:21.960]  and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great products

[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:21.880]  they're going to hire a male reporter and a female reporter the contest
[02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:25.080]  is $5,000 for the two winners and then that puts you in the running to be a
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:28.840]  reporter obviously i just we got to negotiate if you can move
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:31.720]  here if you how much you want to be paid all that kind of stuff
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:35.800]  we probably had like 50 or 60 entries some of them are pretty good but
[02:55:35.800 --> 02:55:38.840]  there's only four rules and people aren't following those
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:42.200]  and then people are complaining well i don't want to upload to youtube i'll do
[02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:45.320]  it to my server so i get the traffic okay well you don't want to be a
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:48.120]  reporter here you don't want to win $5,000
[02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:54.040]  i mean it is just it is crazy it's simple contest rules
[02:55:54.040 --> 02:55:57.160]  like why is it only youtube because we can't post 10 videos on the same page
[02:55:57.160 --> 02:56:01.160]  if it's different sites it just doesn't work or
[02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:04.680]  i'm really tired of it folks and we want your video to go viral
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:09.160]  on info wars.com and on youtube the whole point of the contest isn't just to
[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:12.040]  find great reporters it's also to see all the great reporting you're
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:15.560]  going to do to wake people up about the new world order and there's
[02:56:15.560 --> 02:56:20.040]  stuff like have info wars in the report so people do reports about their news
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:26.360]  thing you don't want to work here you don't want to win
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:28.920]  that's right the one when they don't do what i tell them around here it's called
[02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:31.560]  a joke that the staff's having victories over me
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:35.160]  you don't get to ignore everything i say until you work here
[02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:41.560]  that's when you get to do that okay that's
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:45.640]  all right anyways info wars team dot com

[02:57:36.440 --> 02:57:40.520]  first thing is you know don't abrogate your responsibility for your own health
[02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:43.960]  you know i know people who take better care of their car they know when to
[02:57:43.960 --> 02:57:47.000]  change their oil they know when to do maintenance on their car rotate their
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.800]  tires but they don't know a thing about their body and how
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:52.840]  and how it works they know more about how to reboot their computer than they do
[02:57:52.840 --> 02:57:55.400]  about their body i mean your body is your most important thing and
[02:57:55.400 --> 02:57:58.920]  god bless if you have children take care of them as well depend upon you
