[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:31.000 --> 00:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are, a momentous day.
[00:37.000 --> 00:51.000]  Wednesday, the fourth day of May 2016, Donald Trump has dominated with a 20-plus point lead in the victory in the Indiana primary over Ted Cruz.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  Ted Cruz has dropped out. The word is John Kasich.
[00:54.000 --> 01:10.000]  He's being pressured to drop out because all the confidence games, the smiling, the going, there was never voting in primaries by George Will and the rest of the neocon bunch is not selling and is blowing up in their face big time.
[01:10.000 --> 01:34.000]  Now, they may still try to cook something up, obviously, in Cleveland in July and consummate Trump insider and the head of the stop steel move will be joining us coming up later in the broadcast today to give us the latest developments on the Trump campaign and how he expects the empire of the globalists to strike back.
[01:34.000 --> 01:52.000]  Roger Stone joins us for 30 minutes in the next hour. Wayne Madsen, who's the center of a lot of big reports, because his article first connected, reportedly, Ted Cruz's father to the investigation of Jim Garrison into the JFK assassination.
[01:52.000 --> 02:06.000]  Well, that is all over the news today because Donald Trump has been talking about it the last few days in response to Ted Cruz's father attacking Trump for the last year incessantly and basically saying he's satanic.
[02:06.000 --> 02:22.000]  So if you're going to say Trump is satanic, he can say you're connected to the JFK assassination if there's some evidence pointing that direction. I'm not saying that's the case. But but no one ever points out that his father is running around foaming at the mouth like an attack dog.
[02:22.000 --> 02:40.000]  It's like all Trump's being mean to his pop up for no reason being mean to his old retired daddy who came here with not a dollar in his pocket and underwear to quote Ted. No, your father's been running around like a pit bull locked on to Donald Trump's leg.
[02:40.000 --> 02:55.000]  And so now Trump is trying to gouge your is his political eyeballs out. I'm just so sick of sometimes I go out and I cover leftist and they'll come over and hit you or slap you. And if you even push them back, they start screaming.
[02:55.000 --> 03:12.000]  I'm going, he just hit me. Well, absolutely. If you punch me, I'm going to knock you upside the head. When I defend myself, that's not a bad thing. They'll also come and try to shut down your free speech. When you try to speak out, they say, hey, he's censoring me. I'm here to disrupt your speech.
[03:12.000 --> 03:34.000]  Now, how about left right paradigm? The establishment controls the establishment left the establishment right. And so they create a false left right paradigm of choice in the establishment. But with this populist movement happening and Donald Trump is the head of it, the figurehead of it, the veneers peeling away and we have a real chance of taking back either one of these parties or both.
[03:34.000 --> 03:51.000]  And so a lot of the establishment media people are saying this heralds the end of the Republican Party. What's happening with Donald Trump? Yeah, bringing two and a half million new voters, even more than Reagan did in having huge numbers with the blacks and others Hispanics.
[03:51.000 --> 04:06.000]  Oh, yes, it's the big temp approach. They're so afraid of with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is on the verge of being indicted or the Republican Party leaking information or that is the FBI to the Republican Party that could bring her down.
[04:06.000 --> 04:17.000]  But they don't even want that to happen at the top of the Republican Party because they're all part of the same club. And as George Carlin famously said, we ain't in it. So that's all coming up.
[04:17.000 --> 04:33.000]  But you know why he went from 10 points ahead in the last week in Indiana and other areas to 20 plus points ahead. And it was the image of illegal aliens with Mexican flags running around screaming racist epithets and claiming that Donald Trump had done all these horrible things to him.
[04:33.000 --> 04:48.000]  That image of the American people really resonated with what Donald Trump's been warning about. We're going to talk about this on the other side. We're also going to break down the next attacks that I think that are going to be leveled and that are going to be coming.
[04:48.000 --> 04:59.000]  But separately, I met the show a few weeks ago and it's somewhere around here. My daughter made a Donald Trump card, my eight year old. I want to show that on air. We could find it because a lot of little people are counting on Trump.
[04:59.000 --> 05:08.000]  During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, a Hillary Clinton supporter stood up and urged Hillary to take on the NRA.
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.000]  They need you to be able to use your executive powers to legislate that you can't carry guns in cars.
[05:14.000 --> 05:30.000]  In Hillary's response to using executive orders to take our guns. Meanwhile, Chelsea Clinton says that gun control can finally be implemented now that Justice Scalia is dead.
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  They believe the next time the court rules on gun control will make a definitive ruling.
[05:35.000 --> 05:49.000]  Well, here's a news flash for the Clintons. America doesn't have a gun problem. America has a gang problem. And in gun free zones like Chicago, there's already been over a thousand shootings this year.
[05:49.000 --> 05:59.000]  And guess what? Not one of the shooters was a member of the NRA. Come and take it. And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[05:59.000 --> 06:09.000]  For a limited time, info wars select storeable foods that are the highest quality, longest lasting produced right here in the U.S. foods are 30 to 40% off retail.
[06:09.000 --> 06:19.000]  Now, let me tell you why that's so important. We only do this special twice a year. And we are contractually allowed to offer prices even lower than the prices that my patron supply offers.
[06:19.000 --> 06:26.000]  And that's what produces this food. They're our sponsor. We sell their food infowarstore.com. It's incredibly good deal.
[06:26.000 --> 06:36.000]  But right next to it is our food, the same food, private labeled. And it's a contract loophole where we can offer it lower than anyone else, including their other distributors.
[06:36.000 --> 06:49.000]  I did this because of info wars power in the market to leverage in free market to bring you the very best deals. And quite frankly, that helps us then sell even more food and help fund this operation.
[06:49.000 --> 06:59.000]  So for a limited time, 40 to 30% off all the info wars select storeable food at infowarstore.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[07:20.000 --> 07:34.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war. Pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[07:34.000 --> 07:49.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[07:49.000 --> 07:59.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[07:59.000 --> 08:25.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[08:25.000 --> 08:54.000]  Well, Donald Trump and his populist nationalist supporters defied the entire combined mainstream media, the Republican establishment, the Democratic establishment, as well as foreign governments, religious leaders and others piling on to demonize Donald Trump with a lot of unfair smears and attacks and misrepresentations.
[08:54.000 --> 09:02.000]  Roger Stone joins us in the next hour to break down what he expects to be the next flotella of attacks on Donald Trump and more.
[09:02.000 --> 09:23.000]  Wayne Madsen with the JFK connection to the father of Ted Cruz is popping on and investigative journalist John Rappaport on the latest on TPP and other international treaties that are openly destroying not just our sovereignty, but hundreds of other nations sovereignty being swallowed up by the secretive multinational combines.
[09:23.000 --> 09:34.000]  So we're going to be walking through the latest developments campaign 2016, the latest developments in the economy, the latest developments in media demonization of true new media, a lot of science and tech news as well.
[09:34.000 --> 09:42.000]  We have Donald Trump saying the Muslim migration is destroying Europe. I'm not going to let that happen here. We have Ted Cruz dropping out.
[09:42.000 --> 09:59.000]  We have Trump is quote pivoting into Alex Jones presidency with his conspiracy theories Fox News. We have so much more to break down today. But before we go any further, I want to be very, very clear about something.
[09:59.000 --> 10:17.000]  The main reason I have supported Donald Trump is because the globalist have been so panicked by him for real. And I've stated it very, very closely. This was not some shell operation where they came out and acted like
[10:17.000 --> 10:40.000]  they hated me or hated Donald Trump or hated someone else so that they could then try to position a political idea. You see, what I'm getting at is this. The establishment, the social engineers know that they're hated.
[10:40.000 --> 10:53.000]  They know that the mainstream media has a 6% believability and trust rating. They know Congress has an 8% to 9% trust and approval rating. They're fully aware of all of that.
[10:53.000 --> 11:16.000]  And so it would be a sophisticated move for them to sometimes act like they are against a position or a topic or an individual when they're really for it if they want to get that policy into place.
[11:16.000 --> 11:30.000]  Now, studying these people and watching how they operate, it is their arrogance that undermines them. They're not sophisticated enough to do that.
[11:30.000 --> 11:49.000]  The private run-for-profit Federal Reserve in the three years leading up to 1913 when they got the income tax passed, when they had the U.S. senators removed from the states and taken to the federal level, when they basically engaged in their first level coup d'etat over the
[11:49.000 --> 12:05.000]  Republic. They've been expanding that beachhead ever since then. They were sophisticated enough to pay for op-ed pieces all over the country, paid for by the big banking associations, critical of the Federal Reserve.
[12:05.000 --> 12:25.000]  And that's because they were going up against a very savvy, informed, educated public whose national sport was politics and being informed and not letting the establishment screw you. It had been that way before the Revolutionary War, 240 years ago, before that even started.
[12:25.000 --> 12:46.000]  So I have seen historical examples of where different robber baron groups will act like they are against someone, knowing that they're so loathed that they might be able to trick the populist into supporting their agenda.
[12:46.000 --> 12:58.000]  But nowadays the elites are so decadent, so arrogant on such power trips, and even their minions in the media are and so delusional. They don't care if they have a 6% trustability rate.
[12:58.000 --> 13:12.000]  They don't care if their ratings continue to implode into almost invisible numbers. They don't care because they believe in the teleprompters. They believe in the big lights. They believe in the New York houses and the New York condos and the New York penthouses.
[13:12.000 --> 13:32.000]  And they still just want that vestigial ceremonial power trip for themselves. You watch the pathetic mummies and skexie-like crones at the National Press Club event, National Press Dinner, that Obama presided over.
[13:32.000 --> 13:43.000]  It was like a funeral or a wake or something. So they know they're discredited. They know they're a joke, but they're still holding on to the facade because it's all they've got.
[13:43.000 --> 13:50.000]  And people are probably tuning in saying, okay, we won't know about the election results. We won't know about what's coming next. We want to celebrate the victory of Trump.
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  We want to talk about how much the illegals hate even where all that's going. I'm going to cover all that because I want to cover it too.
[13:56.000 --> 14:03.000]  My broadcast is simply where I'm at mentally and what I'm thinking and what you're thinking and what our guests are thinking.
[14:03.000 --> 14:16.000]  And so I am sitting here looking at this going to the next phase as Obama prepares to leave office as, hopefully, as Hillary tries to get into office.
[14:16.000 --> 14:27.000]  And as Donald Trump appears to be clenching the nomination because the establishment tried to sell the idea that the vote didn't count, but that backfired.
[14:27.000 --> 14:36.000]  They tried to also sell the idea he was racist and evil and horrible and that no one would ever support him, but because they're so discredited that blew up in their face.
[14:36.000 --> 14:50.000]  So I'm thinking, are they going to pull a stunt at Cleveland in July and still try to steal the election or the nomination? Or are they going to move on to plan B and try to assassinate Trump?
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  That's another question. Or will they try to now meet with him and co-opt him and get him to sell out to him?
[14:57.000 --> 15:09.000]  There are a lot of different pieces on the table here and I'm going to open the phones up later in the hour and into the second hour and third hour and fourth hour today to get your view and your perspective on this because
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.000]  I'm normally very, very decisive once I see the angle and once I know the enemy's moving in a certain direction.
[15:15.000 --> 15:26.000]  I can look at what they're doing and I can tell you they've got a lot of different battle plans, a lot of different programs, but everything they've done has turned into garbage, not gold.
[15:26.000 --> 15:36.000]  They have the opposite of the minus touch. And so they're undecided in my view, in my studied research, in my studied gauging of them.
[15:36.000 --> 15:44.000]  They're in disarray right now. They don't know what they're going to do. So I can't tell you what I think they're going to do at this point because they don't know.
[15:44.000 --> 15:57.000]  But I do know what their different options are historically and from their pathology, from their criminology, from their psychology, from their sociopathy.
[15:57.000 --> 16:06.000]  So we're going to be discussing this and wargaming it today throughout the broadcast to really try to get a gauge on what the next shoe to drop is.
[16:06.000 --> 16:15.000]  And of course, Roger Stone, big Trump insider, veteran of nine Republican campaigns, head of StopTheSteel.org, who the White House is now officially demonizing.
[16:15.000 --> 16:26.000]  And Shane, I'm the head evil ringleader. 9-11 conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is chief promoter for Roger Stone's pro-Trump Stop the Steel rally.
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  That's media matters openly run by the White House.
[16:29.000 --> 16:41.000]  What's funny, I saw a bunch of articles this weekend and throughout the week saying Donald Trump's discredited. He's a conspiracy theorist talking about the JFK assassination and Saudi Arabia and 9-11.
[16:41.000 --> 16:50.000]  It's admitted that Saudi Arabia was involved in 9-11 and our government knew in order to stand down and order the FBI to stop tracking the individuals.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  That's open and shut.
[16:52.000 --> 16:59.000]  So Donald Trump has credibility. I have credibility for saying that, but they try to spend it and say there is no credibility.
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.000]  So here's what we're looking at in my view. I'm going to get your take on it.
[17:03.000 --> 17:09.000]  Your two cents, I'm sure, will be very valuable to the overall brainstorm that we're having here publicly. That's all this is.
[17:09.000 --> 17:19.000]  Is an emergency council of the people and an attempt to raise the alarm about known globalist operations and to put our heads together.
[17:19.000 --> 17:27.000]  So I'll just say it. I know they've been panicked by Trump. I know they've thrown everything they can and it's failed.
[17:27.000 --> 17:41.000]  So what will they do next? I'd say, B, will they still try to steal it? Will they assassinate him? That's the subsections of that. Or will they try to co-opt him?
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  I don't think Donald Trump is a bad person.
[17:45.000 --> 17:53.000]  And I think overall he's a nationalist and his history shows that. And he does want to be the guy that's the turnaround guy that saves America and becomes the next George Washington.
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.000]  If he understands destiny and doing the right thing, he should go for that.
[17:58.000 --> 18:04.000]  But the globalists have a way of wearing you down, coming after you, intimidating you and getting you to slowly sell out by increments.
[18:04.000 --> 18:10.000]  And I think you're going to see that be the main system overall that is going to be used.
[18:10.000 --> 18:23.000]  And they're going to send Republican insiders now to Trump to see if he can be basically brought to heel, domesticated to a certain extent, and to see if they can co-opt him.
[18:23.000 --> 18:34.000]  And he knows the art of the deal. So Trump, at a certain respect, this is the greatest danger point, he doesn't sell out, he doesn't take their money, he does it his way, he wins.
[18:34.000 --> 18:46.000]  They know he'll destroy Hillary, the real numbers show that. She's in political trouble, criminal trouble. He then starts accelerating towards the election and then gets them to capitulate to a lot of the things he wants.
[18:46.000 --> 18:58.000]  But also he starts making deals with them. And that's where the people come in, keeping Trump honest, keeping his nose to the grindstone, and that's why this is such an important fight.
[18:58.000 --> 19:07.000]  Now, again, the biggest sign that Trump's the real deal is that the system had a heart attack and a conniption fit and a stroke over it.
[19:07.000 --> 19:25.000]  But a lot of that is because he didn't ever confer with them, he didn't work with the lobbyist, he didn't work with the K Street Boys, he didn't work with the media, he didn't buy advertising, he didn't buy the political consultants, he didn't spend the billion dollars that somebody like Hillary Clinton has already spent in this campaign.
[19:25.000 --> 19:34.000]  So they're mad about that, that he just kind of bulled his way to the head of the line and took over their system. That's why they're really mad at him, folks.
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.000]  Now, if they think he's really going to fight the new old order, they're going to put a bullet in him. So I'm just telling you, that's the epic moment we're at.
[19:40.000 --> 19:52.000]  I had to supporting just to throw stuff into a disarray and create chaos in the enemy's operation and reveal the enemies and have them throw out all the stops to try to steal the election to stop Trump.
[19:52.000 --> 19:59.000]  Now that he's moving into the prime position, the real next level chess game starts.
[20:22.000 --> 20:37.000]  You've woke up to the deception. You understand how big government and corporations are controlling you. Guess what? The trail goes even deeper.

[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  Right. Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.

[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  I loved my dad.
[22:36.000 --> 22:37.000]  But boy was he stubborn.
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.000]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.000]  His excuse?
[22:41.000 --> 22:42.000]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[22:44.000 --> 22:50.000]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  944 G-O-L-D.
[24:26.000 --> 24:41.000]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  So I got a move that tells me what to do.
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  Now I got a move that tells me what to do.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  Sometimes I feel so nice.
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  I want to try myself with you.
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  You got to be there and know what he's talking about, don't you?
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's get into the serious news here.
[25:00.000 --> 25:06.000]  Let me try to condense that 12 minutes of analysis down because I know you get this,
[25:06.000 --> 25:09.000]  but we need to get this out to the public right now.
[25:09.000 --> 25:16.000]  We can't turn Donald Trump into a Messiah figure into a man on a white horse.
[25:16.000 --> 25:25.000]  Donald Trump has done things his own way. He has himself gone out like the globalists do and worked the system to his benefit.
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.000]  He's exposing fundamental pillars of the New World Order, as David Knight points out.
[25:31.000 --> 25:39.000]  The open borders, the globalism, the one-sided trade deals, national sovereignty being transferred to unelected groups.
[25:39.000 --> 25:48.000]  He is doing things that the mere discussion of it forms the shape of the populist movement to be anti-New World Order.
[25:48.000 --> 25:57.000]  I'm getting chills. The fruits of Donald Trump right now are the most delicious, wholesome, good things for the people of the world.
[25:57.000 --> 26:05.000]  To the globalists, they are big, giant, long, black coffin nails about eight inches long and scare the daylights out of them.
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  I mean, Donald Trump is a big, fire-breathing dragon to them, okay?
[26:11.000 --> 26:17.000]  That said, I've been back in him, but let me tell you.
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  They don't know if he's going to sell out to them. They don't know.
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  All they know is he came and got at the head of the line in front of them and took over something they'd hijacked and they run,
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  and arrogant people who for decades have been sitting up there like George Will,
[26:30.000 --> 26:36.000]  the establishment lackey fake conservatives that are there as Judas Goats to sell out real conservatives,
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.000]  showed their hand and came out and said, we don't go with the plurality of the people's vote.
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.000]  We the sovereign party decide.
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  He actually said that.
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.000]  I've got, got at the stack. I'll read it again. It's so profound.
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  It's even crazier than Carl Rove going, we control reality, and no matter what we say, a new reality comes out of it,
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.000]  as if I'm God, and, and I say, let there be light.
[27:00.000 --> 27:06.000]  I mean, these people are out of their minds. Listen, George Will, just because for 30-something years you've been wearing fancy suits
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  and sitting there on national TV, everyone tells you what an intellectual you are.
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  You're not an intellectual. You're a fake.
[27:13.000 --> 27:20.000]  I could sit there and act just like you and act like a stuff suit and act all conservative and freaked out by things
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.000]  and act like Judge Schmales from Caddyshack, but I'm not going to do it.
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  And see, they don't like Donald Trump either because he doesn't do that as well.
[27:29.000 --> 27:36.000]  He's more like the Rodney Dangerfield character that goes, what, be a member of Bushwood?
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  I'm going to buy it, tear it down and put condos on it.
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  He goes, you, you own Bushwood?
[27:43.000 --> 27:49.000]  It's literally Judge Schmales versus Rodney Dangerfield.
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  There's the real billionaire guy that's actually doing stuff and is having a great time buying everybody dinner.
[27:54.000 --> 28:00.000]  And then you've got the so-called wannabe elitist, Judge Schmales, who they see has a certain zest for life.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  And let's just say we're not going to discuss what happened with her.
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  I won't judge. Oh, thank you.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  You're uptight, scared of what people know about them, leading fake lives.
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  That's who these people are, little scared minions.
[28:14.000 --> 28:21.000]  The Weinstein brothers and Al Gore and Hillary Clinton and all these people want to run our lives
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  because they can't even run their own. They're little cowards.
[28:26.000 --> 28:33.000]  Criminals nonetheless, like George Soros, but still, jokes, that's why they crave power.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  And what Donald Trump has done has devastated them.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  Us backing him has devastated them. We've overridden the horror media.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  We've blown out their defenses. We've discredited them.
[28:42.000 --> 28:48.000]  They threw everything they had at us, including all the fake voodoo Christians, who discredit real Christians,
[28:48.000 --> 28:55.000]  running around howling, saying Satan has risen, with Glenn Beck running around acting like a complete lunatic.
[28:55.000 --> 29:04.000]  And all of it blew up in their face at the end, including armies of troll-like illegals hopping around, waving Mexican flags.
[29:04.000 --> 29:09.000]  All of it, we engage the globalist. We force them to show their arrogant hand.
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  It blew up in their face. That's why I say resistance is victory when you have right on your side.
[29:14.000 --> 29:22.000]  But if you don't resist, then it just rolls over. Everybody feels like they're alone, and the next wave goes into place.
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  But when I come back, I'm going to go over the news, the election, play the clips, talk about it all,
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  but get into the next phase of the situation.
[29:29.000 --> 29:33.000]  Where they're going next, and how we keep Donald Trump honest.
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  And what I know is really going on with Donald Trump, and what we can expect the enemy to do.
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  I'm Alex Jones. This is the InfoWars.com.

[30:02.000 --> 30:08.000]  Report authorities buying more riot control gear over fear of civil unrest sweeping America.
[30:08.000 --> 30:13.000]  A report published by Sandler Research says that the demand for surveillance drones is driving growth
[30:13.000 --> 30:19.000]  with new systems that deploy water cannons that handle large crowds and demonstrations also proving popular.
[30:19.000 --> 30:26.000]  Riot control systems are expected to generate revenues of over 3.5 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 2020,
[30:26.000 --> 30:31.000]  with North America being one of the primary growth areas for upgraded weapons due to militarization
[30:31.000 --> 30:37.000]  of the Deplace Department and other law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the 2014 riots in Ferguson, Missouri.
[30:37.000 --> 30:42.000]  As of long-range acoustic devices, whips, batons, and armored vehicles that will be used to disperse control
[30:42.000 --> 30:46.000]  and arrest people involved in riots and protests are also on the rise.
[30:46.000 --> 30:52.000]  In Cleveland, they are ramping up their riot gear as well in the aftermath of what they think will be
[30:52.000 --> 30:57.000]  an extremely volatile situation at Fish Year's Republican National Convention.
[30:57.000 --> 31:07.000]  Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[31:32.000 --> 31:38.000]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[31:38.000 --> 31:45.000]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[31:45.000 --> 31:50.000]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[33:27.000 --> 33:31.000]  We're taking your calls. First-time callers in this hour.
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.000]  What's your view on the giant Trump victory, devastating establishment in Indiana?
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  Also, Bernie Sanders won, handily. Democrats are in total disarray.
[33:40.000 --> 33:49.000]  They've been robbing his delegates after he went state after state to create the perception that Hillary could be the only one to win.
[33:49.000 --> 33:59.000]  But then Sanders started going after his own delegates to get them back and the mainstream media, the New York Times, had the headline that Bernie Sanders was trying to steal delegates.
[33:59.000 --> 34:07.000]  It's like if somebody runs up and steals your wife's purse and you run and tackle them and the cops arrest you saying you stole the purse from the mugger.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  Even though your wife's bill folds in it. It just doesn't fly.
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.000]  Again, this is a total failure of the fraud system. That's number one.
[34:14.000 --> 34:20.000]  Trying to sell that there was never any voting for primaries. They never counted super delegates. They invented in the 70s.
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.000]  Magically could, you know, just end all that if they wanted to.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  That's like saying that referees can just make up new rules in a football game anytime they want.
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.000]  Or that maybe referees win the trophy. Maybe we pay the players money, the referees.
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.000]  Maybe referees in boxing matches. Maybe they start doing the fighting.
[34:39.000 --> 34:45.000]  This is so backwards. This is so over the top that they sat there with a straight face.
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  The last four months going, it's completely normal. It's the rules.
[34:49.000 --> 34:59.000]  And I'm like, no, you have public elections. No, you use public money. No, you hold out that it's one person, one vote, one woman, one vote, one man, one vote.
[34:59.000 --> 35:05.000]  And now you see, ladies and gentlemen, that none of it worked.
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  And Ted Cruz has been destroyed. Even mainstream media now says, I've got articles right here.
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.000]  Okay, saying that the popular vote didn't count blew up in the Republicans' faces.
[35:15.000 --> 35:22.000]  And now it's blowing up in Hillary's face. And by the way, Hillary, the FBI is saying it anytime.
[35:22.000 --> 35:30.000]  In fact, they're leaning towards leaking the info because the Justice Department won't indict themselves on Hillary Gate.
[35:30.000 --> 35:36.000]  Or IRS Gate or any of it. But she's known under three different criminal investigations.
[35:36.000 --> 35:42.000]  They're finding El Chapo with the weapons from Fast and Furious, 50 Cal's. Our government gave them.
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.000]  Of course, El Chapo's CIA. That's come out in federal court.
[35:46.000 --> 35:53.000]  That's why it's wrong to put him in jail unless you put his bosses in Lainley, Virginia, in prison as well.
[35:53.000 --> 36:00.000]  Even the movie Socarro came out with a lot of good actors in it. Josh Brolin does a good job. It's very accurate.
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.000]  And at the end they go, look, the CIA is cutting back the other cartels. We run three big ones.
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  And that's how we like it. We run the drugs. And the guys like, and the lady from the FBI is like,
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  you mean the government runs the drugs? They go, huh, we sure do.
[36:12.000 --> 36:17.000]  There's a cartel that's not working. Well, this we're going to kill their family.
[36:17.000 --> 36:24.000]  That is actually how it works, ladies and gentlemen. It's been declassified. It came out in the 80s and the 70s
[36:24.000 --> 36:31.000]  and came out in the 60s before that with Vietnam. But people don't watch congressional hearings on C-SPAN.
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.000]  The big banks launder the money. The low level guys that Hollywood turns into movie stars have to do all the killing.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  El Chapo has to battle all the other gangs and me and hundreds of machine gun fights.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  And if you want to say it, even though he's a brutal murderer, he's the man.
[36:45.000 --> 36:51.000]  He actually does the dirty work, just like Tony Montana says in his car face, which was written by one of the greatest screenwriters out there.
[36:51.000 --> 36:59.000]  That's really what he is. He's not a director, but a screenwriter. He is Oliver Stone. He wrote that for De Palma.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  And he says, it's the big banks. They run all the drugs. They've done it for thousands of years.
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.000]  They make it illegal so that we go out and do all the work and so they don't have to follow any of the rules.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  And then we go to jail so everybody can point their finger at us and say, there's the bad man.
[37:11.000 --> 37:19.000]  And that's exactly how it works. Exactly. It's a joke.
[37:19.000 --> 37:27.000]  So you'll put El Chapo in jail and call him a monster on CNN and Fox News and I'm just rolling my eyes.
[37:27.000 --> 37:35.000]  Rolling my eyes. It's all complete. Fairy tale, fantasy land, garbage.
[37:35.000 --> 37:43.000]  But then you get the mafia culture that's in all different racial groups, all merging together with Hollywood and MTV selling it,
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  where the young kids get involved in all this and they're not for decriminalization.
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  They're not for stopping the drug war. No, they like the drug war. They like the illegal money.
[37:51.000 --> 37:59.000]  They like all the glitz and the so-called glamour and all it does is conduit you straight into a prison.
[37:59.000 --> 38:08.000]  And so there are all these new groups. The stories are up on infowars.com saying that they're going to riot.
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.000]  They're going to burn stuff down if Trump gets the nomination.
[38:12.000 --> 38:18.000]  What are you going to do? Burn down your own neighborhood and then maybe shoot some firefighters and get put in prison
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  and then wonder why no one puts businesses in your neighborhood.
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.000]  Oh, that'll really show everyone and then that'll create massive racial and cultural division in America,
[38:27.000 --> 38:33.000]  which the globalists, the same ones that run the media, the same ones that put Beyonce on during the Super Bowl,
[38:33.000 --> 38:39.000]  saying attack the police and saying hate your boyfriend or your husband and beat cars with baseball bats.
[38:39.000 --> 38:45.000]  They're teaching all this fake rebellion. So you'll go out and rebel against the cops or against your husband
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  or against the gringo or against the whatever the case is thinking you're doing something
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  when all you're doing is dividing and conquering the country.
[38:53.000 --> 38:59.000]  Just how the British Empire and the Roman Empire and every other empire always controlled its vassals.
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  You know what a vassal is? It's a slave.
[39:07.000 --> 39:15.000]  Totally ridiculous to see what the public schools and the universities and MTV and the NFL
[39:15.000 --> 39:24.000]  and every other mainstream cultural avenue pushes race based hate filled black and Hispanic and Asian groups
[39:24.000 --> 39:31.000]  to run around vitriolically saying white people are the progenitors of all forms of evil on the globe
[39:31.000 --> 39:37.000]  so that classically liberal white people will circle the wagons, self-segregate
[39:37.000 --> 39:45.000]  and be the management class in the collapsing West over all the other groups.
[39:45.000 --> 39:52.000]  So they're actually bringing back classical racism but through the left and the people caught up at it
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.000]  have no idea how sophisticated the operation is.
[39:57.000 --> 40:08.000]  But it's amazing as the Gateway Punnett reports anti-Trump groups big Republican donors like the Koch brothers spent $75.7 million
[40:08.000 --> 40:14.000]  on 64,000 negative ads mainly in just the last month.
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.000]  It's got to be 200 million in the last six months to bring down Trump and it wasn't enough.
[40:19.000 --> 40:24.000]  In fact, suddenly they were starting to drive down his numbers a little bit
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  but it flipped and they started going way back up and why is that?
[40:27.000 --> 40:34.000]  Because the establishment left all over the country came out following the mainstream media directive
[40:34.000 --> 40:41.000]  and beat up the evil crackers, beat up the evil gringos, the trendy white justice warrior white knights
[40:41.000 --> 40:49.000]  spit on and attacked the other evil Trump supporters, beat up the Hispanic Trump supporters, beat up the black Trump supporters
[40:49.000 --> 40:56.000]  spit on everyone and the mainstream media didn't really cover it starting in Chicago and other areas
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  they lied and said it was all Trump's fault and Ted Cruz said it was all Trump's fault
[40:59.000 --> 41:05.000]  but the internet and infowars.com more than anybody
[41:05.000 --> 41:12.000]  our reporters, Rob Dujášo and others on the ground showing everybody how it's done
[41:12.000 --> 41:18.000]  went to town after town after town, Joe Biggs and the rest of the crew just always going out
[41:18.000 --> 41:25.000]  to town at town at town and city and showing the vile anti free speech foaming at the mouth
[41:25.000 --> 41:33.000]  frothing hordes and it educated everyone very, very quickly.
[41:33.000 --> 41:41.000]  I mean, conservatively, just our videos every week showing people knocking out windows,
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  attacking cars, beating people up, screaming Viva La Raza for those inside the race, everything
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.000]  for those outside the race, nothing, I mean that is a literal Nazi slogan if whites were using it
[41:51.000 --> 41:59.000]  that is literal Adolf Hitler talk but being spewed by university brainwashed Hispanics
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  and it blew up with their face.
[42:02.000 --> 42:09.000]  10 million views every week separate from all our other views and listeners, 10 million
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.000]  and by the way, that's just on our channels on Facebook and our YouTube channels
[42:13.000 --> 42:18.000]  not even counting what we showed to millions on radio and TV and not counting everybody else's sites
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.000]  I don't have time to go look, I went and looked at one video Rob Dujášo in California
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.000]  that had 3.4 million views on one of our channels, half a million on the other channel
[42:27.000 --> 42:32.000]  and then I found another channel with 2 million views, another channel with 4 million views
[42:32.000 --> 42:38.000]  I mean that's like 10 million views one video, so when I say 10 million that is a giant understatement
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  because I don't have time to go track it all because I'm too busy moving on to the next globalist target
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  that is devastation
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  and of course Trump is a dinosaur but at least he is a patriot and a nationalist
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  he appears, he still goes on the little fox in France
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.000]  and he still goes on the O'Reilly with the 3 million viewers and he still does all that judiciously
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  we're not here clamoring like baby birds, please come on Trump, please come on Trump
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  we just want the insides of the campaign
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  we don't care if a, you know, senator or somebody comes on, people tune out for that
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  folks like Trump coming on but not as much as just having some listener call in with a great point
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  because it's about the people
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  but see info wars and you the listeners are leading the charge every day, every week, every month
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  you see us punching through the Berlin Wall of disinformation
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  changing the narrative, our terms being used all over the world
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.000]  you know who listens more than anybody, the militaries, not just ours, the militaries
[43:35.000 --> 43:41.000]  and you know who else listens number two, the police, you know who's responded all over the country, the police
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  you know who got it, the police
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  are there some bad cops, globalist control, absolutely
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  but why would we be idiots and make them our enemies, why would we make Hispanics our enemies
[43:50.000 --> 43:56.000]  just because the Ford Foundation spent 27 million dollars itself on this project in the last 50 years
[43:56.000 --> 44:03.000]  it's over 20 billion, just on this, just on this, just on Mecheloraza
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  Henry Ford, of course, a Hitler lover
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.000]  but I actually did some good things too for business and things but I don't support his political views
[44:10.000 --> 44:16.000]  what I'm getting at here is that this is out of control sophisticated new world order garbage
[44:16.000 --> 44:20.000]  but once you see it and once you know what it's doing, it's game over
[44:20.000 --> 44:23.000]  so our big danger is them assassinating Trump
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  trying to steal it again at the convention
[44:26.000 --> 44:31.000]  we've got this intimidation going by a bunch of gang members and brainwashed university students
[44:31.000 --> 44:35.000]  and people saying we're going to burn stuff down if you nominate Trump
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  the American people, the sleeping giant of every race, color and creed
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  doesn't wake up and take action until they get threatened like that
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  you have just guaranteed that if Trump focuses on these thugs
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  and focuses on the intimidation and focuses on the social justice warriors
[44:50.000 --> 44:56.000]  and talks about their intimidation of free speech, it is game over
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.000]  I've told the Trump campaign you need to put your own people in disguise
[45:01.000 --> 45:08.000]  inside these leftist operations to show what they're really saying and you will bring them down
[45:08.000 --> 45:13.000]  but I'm not going to wait for Trump to do it, we're going to go undercover now
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  that's what it takes ladies and gentlemen
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  see we're not going to sit around and wait for somebody else to do it
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  we're going to lead and we are leading
[45:19.000 --> 45:25.000]  and that's what you get with info wars is absolute 21st century warfare against the new world order with truth
[45:25.000 --> 45:29.000]  that sword cuts through their lies like nothing
[45:29.000 --> 45:34.000]  they've got these big water hoses that spray stinking horse manure at the public
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  that's not our weapon to just splatter everything with stench
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  so everybody just gets confused and the smoke
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.000]  we just cut right through with a flaming hot sword that just goes right through the hardest lies
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  slicing right through them
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.000]  we are devastating the enemy because we have the spirit of liberty
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  the spirit of the will to take action
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  when you get that will folks and you get that focus it's game over
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  when you get the confidence and the historical understanding
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  and know how the enemy operates
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  nothing on earth can stop you folks
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.000]  unless they start a giant depression or start world war 3
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  and even if they pull that
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.000]  folks are aware of what's going on and understand the establishment is behind it all
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  pulling the tricks the false flags you name it
[46:17.000 --> 46:22.000]  I want to go to Alex, Robert, Mike, Phoenix, Robert and others
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  but it is just such an exciting time to be alive right now
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000]  and it is such a badge of courage such a certification
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.000]  when they have Fox News, CNN, MSNBC almost every day
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  lying about my broadcast and demonizing yours truly
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.000]  these are people with shrinking ratings shrinking audiences
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  sitting around their fancy studios
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.000]  literally believing they've arrived because they're part of the establishment
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  I would never want to be part of the establishment
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.000]  do you know how I would destroy myself if I took the Fox TV shows
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  you've heard ManCal on the show let the cattle in the bag
[46:59.000 --> 47:02.000]  yeah you know that Fox show you were going to do with me
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  but I didn't show up I didn't sign the contract
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  nothing against ManCal, ask him
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  and other contracts they offered me
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  he came and he goes I met with the head people
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.000]  you've been offered four TV shows and contracts and money and didn't take them
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  I said yeah
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.000]  and then Fox News had the nerve to go to the New York Daily News
[47:19.000 --> 47:22.000]  a few years ago and go Alex Jones wanted a job with us
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  we refused him he wants show biz but show biz doesn't want him
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  I was told that before when I was like 20 years old
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.000]  no no no no I don't want show biz jackass
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.000]  I want freedom and space exploration and the next renaissance
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.000]  and I don't care if nobody even knows my name in the future
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  because my genetics are going to be carried on forever
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  that's living forever that's victory
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  and I want your genetics to go on forever all of us together
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  of every race color and creed as one humanity
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  I believe in humanity I'm a fan of humanity
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  I want to win I want prosperity and I want to smash the skulls
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.000]  of bullies and murderers and child molesters wide open
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  I want to see their teeth all over the ground
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  I got an instinct to win an instinct to thrive
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  an instinct to understand things
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  I'm a pioneer I'm an explorer
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  I'm a human and I'm coming
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  I'm animated I'm alive my heart's big
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.000]  it's got hot blood going through it fast
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  I like to fight too
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  I like to eat I like to have children
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  I'm here I got a life force this is a human
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  this is what we look like this is what we act like
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  this is what everybody was like before us
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  this is what I am I'm a throwback I'm here
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  I've got the fire of human liberty
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  I'm setting fires everywhere
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  and humans are turning on everywhere
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  and we're going to get our metaphysical hands around
[48:47.000 --> 48:50.000]  your stinking necks make no mistake parasites
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.000]  there's an attack on the species by a guild of psychopaths
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  and they must be defeated
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  I'm going to settle down excuse me
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  I'm going to come back to the next seven sticker calls excuse me
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  the epicness of the energy in the world right now
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.000]  humanity struggling to go into the future
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  putting consciousness suppressing chemicals in the food and water
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  the fact that they're coming out with vaccines
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  that have viruses that eat part of your brain
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  to make you more docile that was in the news 15 years ago
[49:17.000 --> 49:20.000]  look it up brain-eating vaccines is what I called them
[49:20.000 --> 49:23.000]  as a pop term to get folks to go look at these
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  behavior vaccines or calming vaccines
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.000]  or anti-drug vaccines
[49:29.000 --> 49:35.000]  they're coming after our will it's the only card they've got left
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  and they're going to be caught doing this
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.000]  outside of their authorized trials with people
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  and the folks that I'm the one I'm not even bragging
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  this is what you can do
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  I was told in 1996 by a head nurse in San Antonio
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  there was a secret army and UN database
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  of everybody's blood at birth being put in
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  and they were claiming they owned everyone's blood
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  and DNA type preparing it to claim they own your DNA in the future
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  years later sort of coming out in the news after I talked about it
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  family started asking family sued in Austin
[50:03.000 --> 50:06.000]  and in Minneapolis St. Paul and found out it was all true
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.000]  and the whole program came out just like that
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  a nurse tells me shows me the documents
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  I talk about it it takes five years for it to finally crest and break
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  and now that whole program has been exposed worldwide
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  I'm gonna skip this break it's too important
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  that is how epic all of this is
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  you can do that on any subject you want
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  I've been trying to push the chimeras out and make sure that breaks
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  right till there's a national discussion
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  and all the folks that are obsessed on animal testing
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  you'll hear a word from PETA because they're anti-human
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  and controlled by the globalist
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  oh boy I know the inside on that
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  anyways the point is that
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  imagine if people are mad that they test shampoo on bunnies
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  where's the concern about human testing that's going on
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  or the chimera testing
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  yes they're growing humanoids inside pigs, sheep and cows
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.000]  that are part human so are the pigs and cows so they don't reject them
[51:09.000 --> 51:12.000]  I'm showing MIT on screen human animal chimeras gestating
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  on research farms across the US
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  and it's not a radical new approach it's going on for 50 stinking years
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  they're just getting ready to roll it out but they're rolling it out
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  their way how cute and fun it is see
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  and they can have folks at Fox News make fun of me
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  and they go back in a confidence game like they're at the frat back in college
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.000]  when the new guy walks in all that confidence goes
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.000]  Alex Jones claims there's chimeras
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  you're sitting there with almost no audience
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  and those that do watch you don't trust you you're a joke
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  what you got a bunch of, I love old people but
[51:51.000 --> 51:54.000]  you got a bunch of, look at the ads, catheter ads and all the rest
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.000]  you got a bunch of 85 people, 85 year olds on average
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.440]  who aren't even there because they think the girls are pretty.
[52:03.400 --> 52:07.720]  You're all typecast to make 85-year-olds think you're cool. I mean, you're really cool.
[52:07.720 --> 52:09.320]  You're really trailblazing the future.
[52:12.280 --> 52:17.480]  You know, Info Wars just in one area every week for the last year dominates global memes
[52:17.480 --> 52:22.120]  that hundreds of millions of people look at. We're the meme factory, not even trying. The people
[52:22.120 --> 52:27.400]  that create all the memes decide to come to Info Wars to choose them and to launch them as a form
[52:27.400 --> 52:33.800]  of hat tipping. See, we, we are the future. See, the X-Files is based on us now and the movies
[52:33.800 --> 52:39.080]  and the literature and the culture. You are with the people who are preparing to be put in coffins.
[52:39.080 --> 52:41.000]  You're dead Fox News.
[52:45.720 --> 52:51.800]  You're dead Glenback. You chose the Lord of this world, he who loves death. That's what you do.
[52:51.800 --> 52:55.160]  And I'm not, again, I love old people. They're wonderful people. I say, take care of them.
[52:55.160 --> 52:57.720]  Don't kill them. You know, a lot of them are great patrons. They have great knowledge of
[52:57.720 --> 53:03.720]  their wake, but the ones watching CNN and Fox News and MSNBC literally don't know in some cases
[53:03.720 --> 53:07.240]  what planet they're on. A lot of them are really informed people. I watch Fox News. My son watches
[53:07.240 --> 53:11.800]  it. There's some good stuff on there, but the, the establishment people they've got on there,
[53:11.800 --> 53:16.520]  making fun of us about the 28 pages and making fun of us about other issues, they're a joke
[53:16.520 --> 53:24.280]  and they don't control the narrative anymore. Now briefly here, let me go to your phone calls,
[53:25.640 --> 53:32.120]  specials that we have running right now. We have a mega food sale that I have gotten authorization.
[53:32.120 --> 53:35.080]  You notice I didn't say yesterday. Hey, this is the last day because I got authorization
[53:35.080 --> 53:39.400]  to run it through at least next Monday, but then that is it. He said, look, Monday or Tuesday,
[53:39.400 --> 53:43.400]  it's got to stop because, you know, just because they are going to run down on stores. They like
[53:43.400 --> 53:46.520]  to ship food within one week. They can still do that until next week. And then there's going to
[53:46.520 --> 53:51.000]  start being a little bit of a wait, maybe of a week or two, but the food is there, just packaged,
[53:51.000 --> 53:55.880]  totally fresh, super high quality, powered by my Patriot. We have the full my Patriot supply
[53:55.880 --> 54:00.840]  spectrum and m4store.com. It's dropped shipped by those great folks out in Utah. When you order
[54:00.840 --> 54:07.000]  at m4store.com or m4select.com, but m4select is their entire spectrum of food, private labeled
[54:07.000 --> 54:11.480]  with our label to contractually get around the already lowest prices in the industry they have
[54:11.480 --> 54:16.440]  when you get 10% off. We normally offer that. It's already some of the lowest prices in m4store.com.
[54:17.880 --> 54:21.640]  30 to 40% off. And folks are really taking advantage of this because they've done their
[54:21.640 --> 54:24.920]  shopping. They know it's high quality food. They know it last 25 years. It's packaged,
[54:24.920 --> 54:29.240]  it's insurance you can eat, all the crazy stuff going on in the world, all the globalist programs
[54:29.240 --> 54:34.280]  for destabilization, trying to start wars, the open borders, all of it. You're crazy if you don't
[54:34.280 --> 54:41.960]  have storeable food in my humble summation in my humble view m4store.com m4select.com takes you
[54:41.960 --> 54:46.840]  right to the storeable foods. We also have 10% off all other preparedness and survival items from
[54:46.840 --> 54:52.680]  non GMO heirloom seeds, huge selection very low prices already 10% off shortwave radios,

[55:08.600 --> 55:15.480]  all 10% off. That's DNA force, survival shield, supermail vitality sold out. Anthroplex is very
[55:15.480 --> 55:20.520]  similar, very good formula. And it's less as well. It's available in full wars, life.com,
[55:20.520 --> 55:26.600]  m4store.com. Take advantage. Okay, I'm going to settle down here. This is just such an epic time
[55:26.600 --> 55:31.160]  to be alive. But I'm going to show one more thing before I go to a call. And that's this,
[55:31.160 --> 55:35.400]  my youngest daughter made this a few weeks ago. I wanted me to show it on air and I never got
[55:35.400 --> 55:38.840]  around to it because I was so busy. You're a TV viewer. You can see it. I'll describe it for
[55:38.840 --> 55:47.480]  radio listeners. And it says vote for Trump with a heart that is an American flag. And
[55:48.760 --> 55:54.280]  she made a bunch of these was handing them out to visitors that came over for a barbecue at my
[55:54.280 --> 55:59.640]  house. I'm going to tell Trump something right now. I like you. I think I've assessed you correctly.
[55:59.640 --> 56:03.560]  You're trying to force the globalist to capitulate to you. That's why they don't like you.
[56:03.560 --> 56:07.960]  You're showing how weak they are. You're a man of destiny. A lot of respect for you. And I know
[56:07.960 --> 56:12.760]  you understand building something for humanity is the ultimate strength, not being a parasite.
[56:12.760 --> 56:16.280]  So I believe you're a builder and an empower. You're not perfect. Nobody is.
[56:17.560 --> 56:22.200]  But if you go sideways on us and if you betray my daughter or anybody else, I want Donald Trump
[56:22.200 --> 56:26.440]  to know something. I'm going to do everything I can to politically come after you. And it's not
[56:26.440 --> 56:30.520]  going to be a bunch of idiots burning American flags, screaming Viva La Raza. Okay. Thought about
[56:30.520 --> 56:35.480]  the Ford Foundation. I want Donald Trump to know it's not a threat. I'm just saying you hurt us.
[56:35.480 --> 56:39.560]  You betray us. You betray my daughter. That doesn't mean you don't make some compromises.
[56:39.560 --> 56:43.080]  It doesn't mean you're going to be perfect. Nobody can be. They're going to misrepresent and claim
[56:43.080 --> 56:48.200]  he sold out. But I'm telling you, take on the globalist. You got our full backing. But I don't
[56:48.200 --> 56:52.360]  really get behind candidates a lot, but I could tell the system was scared. They know you would
[56:52.360 --> 56:56.840]  leecher for real trying to take over from them. And that scares them enough. Now you better be
[56:56.840 --> 57:00.680]  trying to take the Republic back for the people and you say you are and you say you're committed and
[57:00.680 --> 57:04.440]  you, you seem to be a very humble person at the end of the day and down to earth. And I don't want
[57:04.440 --> 57:08.120]  to folks that know you behind the scenes and they say you're totally aware of the new world order
[57:08.120 --> 57:12.600]  before I was even born that you're basically like a Patriot sleeper cell really planning to go after
[57:12.600 --> 57:18.600]  them. And so I believe that, but I've looked at all the angles, Trump. And I'm just saying,
[57:18.600 --> 57:22.280]  I'd like to say, believe me, I say that too.
[57:24.920 --> 57:30.040]  The people in this country are sick of being betrayed and we want to see aggressive moves
[57:30.040 --> 57:34.440]  against the new world order. And we will back you all the way and we want to see these, these
[57:34.440 --> 57:40.840]  comebacks destroyed politically. And we want to see you with American people's backing run over
[57:40.840 --> 57:45.720]  the traders and to bring them to justice and to prosecute Hillary and so much more. So you've got
[57:45.720 --> 57:52.600]  my backing and you've got my commitment and you've got my support and you know it. You got a lot of
[57:52.600 --> 57:56.520]  the people support. You got my eight year old support and my son's support and my daughter's
[57:56.520 --> 58:01.080]  support. My son liked you, you know, before I was even on board when I was studying you.
[58:01.720 --> 58:05.240]  And I talked about that when you were on air and Trump, I know you watch the show. So I'm just
[58:05.240 --> 58:09.960]  telling you right now, you cannot betray this right here and be like the, the entire criminal
[58:09.960 --> 58:14.920]  class that loves betraying people and loves selling folks out. I know you believe in the big idea of
[58:14.920 --> 58:21.000]  humanity versus the new world order and prosperity and sovereignty. So we're supporting you, but do
[58:21.000 --> 58:26.520]  not let my eight year old daughter down or I'll take it very, very personal. It's not a threat.
[58:27.320 --> 58:30.680]  I don't like committing to somebody and supporting them and then having the fear they're going to
[58:30.680 --> 58:35.640]  stab me in the back. I'm just telling you that I think you understand you've hit the zeitgeist here
[58:35.640 --> 58:40.040]  and this isn't a game. It's not a joke. We'll be back with your call. Stay with us. Phoenix and
[58:40.040 --> 58:46.600]  FEMA nine, Robert Malabama and others. Visit GCN live.com today.
[58:50.600 --> 58:56.280]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums
[58:56.280 --> 59:03.480]  of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense. 60 years ago,
[59:03.480 --> 59:09.320]  when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own,
[59:09.320 --> 59:15.000]  air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[59:15.000 --> 59:19.800]  Pathogens added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[59:19.800 --> 59:26.040]  vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter
[59:26.040 --> 59:33.480]  this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs
[59:33.480 --> 59:39.400]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[59:39.400 --> 59:44.360]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back
[59:44.360 --> 59:48.440]  in our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[59:48.440 --> 01:00:13.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.040]  Trump is only a manifestation of populism across the world rising. The third world is collapsing.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:32.280]  The globalists have engineered this by design to consolidate control. They intend to ride this
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:39.240]  dragon, to ride the tiger and gain full control. But as it leads to throughout history, as Hitler
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:44.360]  turned east towards Russia, all they do is sow the seeds of their own destruction and I hope not
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:50.120]  our seeds with it. Let's go to Phoenix and FEMA region 9. This Trump will not go global.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:55.480]  And he goes on. Robert says, Army vet Trump on Indiana. Hillary indicted question mark.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.360]  Alex wants to talk about Trump and the scenarios to play out next. Robert South Carolina comment
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.120]  on the elite and Trump. Mike wants to talk about America and the globalists. We'll get
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:08.360]  there everybody. Thank you for holding Phoenix in FEMA region 9. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:16.040]  Hi Alex and thanks so much for everything you do. I just want to say that I don't think that
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:23.160]  Trump is going to give in to these globalists. I think he's a man of the people and I don't think
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:27.800]  he's going to back down. And I think the most important thing he's going to have to do is pick
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:35.080]  a really good cabinet to keep him safe. Yeah, he met with Haas to have the CFR and then Haas came
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.440]  out and attacked him a week later saying he was horrible. And I've talked to folks that were there
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.360]  at the meeting. They said, Trump totally disagree with him and said, that's a load of baloney and,
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:47.160]  you know, we're getting screwed over. America pays for the globalist and their empire. See,
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:53.000]  we pay for the empire. Our names on it. We die for it. We get the bad name for it. We don't even
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.880]  get the booty. I'd be against having an empire robbing stuff and hauling it back here to us.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:02.600]  That's immoral. But we're not even doing that. We have the worst type of empire we could have.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:08.760]  I hear you. I think Trump's for real overall. And he likes prosperity. He doesn't like screwing
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.120]  people over. I mean, he might go out for somebody because they try to, you know, hold something
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.840]  over his head for a golf course and he's already got the deal going. He's not perfect. But at the
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.320]  same time, he's an alpha male that is successfully defeating the globalist with the people's help.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:26.200]  And that alone, he gets high, high marks for me. Thank you, Phoenix. Robert in Alabama,
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:33.160]  you're on the air worldwide. Yeah, Alex. How are you doing? I consider you a true patriot.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:39.000]  Well, God bless you, brother. You know, I'm a, I'm a veteran. I serve free tours in Iraq and
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:48.040]  and even in the person golf war, you know, and I'm really sick and tired of the way media
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:55.960]  portrays all this, you know, I'll go to like Hillary. I'm glad for one thing that Trump
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:02.520]  did get Indiana. And I want to say that America must indict Hillary Clinton along my time in
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:11.160]  the military. She mishandled government information. It's classified thousands of times what
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:19.640]  Petraeus did and she's not in trouble. I know. And on her own personal server, you know, that in
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:25.640]  itself is a, as a class one felony and could be in some cases result in life in prison.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:31.800]  Open and shut. It's, it's, it's 10 year felony. If you didn't even know that you were doing it.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.160]  And if you did it knowingly, it's espionage. You can be executed actually.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:43.240]  And then if President Obama were to pardon Hillary for a compromise of the magnitude,
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.760]  he would render himself in a historical record as enemy of the state and he could face criminal
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.640]  prosecution. Absolutely. What's your gut on Trump? I mean, is he for real? Because he's
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.320]  absolutely dominating. He's got the people behind him. He better be for real.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:06.200]  Well, I agree with you, Alex. I think I feel that there's some patriotism in him. And I'm
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:14.440]  definitely, I'm glad that he beat Cruz because I think Cruz would have been that trickster to
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.200]  really sell us out to us. Well, yeah, I mean, look how Cruz claimed that Trump was causing
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.720]  the violence when he never had anything to do with it. And then people with Mexican flags
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:26.280]  screaming Villarraza, Black Lives Matter, social justice warriors, and Cruz is saying it's Trump's
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:31.240]  fault when they're knocking people's teeth out and turning over police cars. That's all you
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:37.080]  need to know about Cruz. And that's why Cruz bit off more than he could chew. Now I want to move
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.160]  on now to Hillary. How does he defeat Hillary? Roger Stone's coming up. You want to hear the
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.840]  inside scoop on where the campaign goes from here? You're about to hear it all. And don't
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:49.880]  worry, we're going to go to Robert and Alex and Mike and everybody else. Thank you, Robert.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:57.160]  Great points. I'm Alex Jones. infowars.com is where the defense of human liberty begins.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:06.120]  During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, a Hillary Clinton supporters stood up and urged Hillary
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:12.040]  to take on the NRA. We need you to be able to use your executive powers, the legislate,
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:17.800]  that you can't carry guns in cars. In Hillary's response to using executive orders to take our
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:25.640]  guns, amen. Let the congregation say amen. Meanwhile, Chelsea Clinton says that gun control
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:31.880]  can finally be implemented now that Justice Scalia is dead. They believe the next time the court rules
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:38.360]  on gun control will make a definitive ruling. Well, here's a news flash for the Clintons. America
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:46.120]  doesn't have a gun problem. America has a gang problem. And in gun free zones like Chicago,
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:51.800]  there's already been over a thousand shootings this year. And guess what? Not one of the shooters
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:58.520]  was a member of the NRA. Come and take it. And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.200]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say, Secret 12. That's two super male brainwars,
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:09.240]  prostagart, silver bullet. I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work by involved.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.880]  Thank you, brother. Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:17.720]  I am a relatively short time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.560]  Welcome to the info war. It's so easy to get these incredible
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:26.600]  nutraceuticals that support your health and the info war at the same time. I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:31.160]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, uh, Nathan Ida. Why, God, let me ask you a question.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:35.000]  Have they worked for you? They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.320]  What products are you taking? Are you taking? Everything from, uh, super male to, uh,
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:45.800]  brain force to winter sun, uh, X2, even got a little, uh, DNA force. So when I just re-upped
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:51.080]  everything and I just went to auto-fil. Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and

[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:03.000]  Brain force, it's completely different. Try a bottle of it. Rob do,
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.040]  joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brain force get.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:13.400]  I'd been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 830.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:17.160]  I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.840]  wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:25.800]  two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:30.840]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third party
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:35.640]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:39.800]  based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:44.120]  while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force. I went home about 645 this
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:49.320]  morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in. You will find
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:57.400]  brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:06.680]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:15.720]  a war on for your mind. This will be a day long remember. You have seen the entire media
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:20.760]  establishment combined foreign governments, the communist Chinese mass murders, the pope,
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:27.160]  the Mexican government, Saudi Arabian crazies. Everybody come out and say you cannot have
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:32.680]  Donald Trump. They have misrepresented everything he said, twisted it. They have financed all
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:37.160]  sorts of internal and foreign groups, people running around with Mexican flags, knocking
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:41.800]  people's teeth out, blood everywhere, foaming at the mouth, people threatening to riot if we
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  have the gall to actually nominate him. The republicans coming out saying we don't have
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.280]  elections. George will coming out saying come on, we don't go with the people's will. We have a
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:58.760]  sovereignty of the party. He actually says the sovereignty. Next, I guess the party members
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:03.560]  will wear a crowns or something. This is epic what's happening. Roger Stone joins us at the
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:09.720]  bottom of the hour, stonesone.com. The mainstream media now really hates him and basically says
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.160]  he's the secret campaign head. No, he's one of the advisors, one of the friends of Trump,
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:19.240]  but Trump is his own advisor. Epic history happening now. So my questions are what happened
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:24.440]  behind the scenes? K6 supposedly about to drop out. Where does this go? What's the real numbers on
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:29.400]  Hillary? Will they still try to steal it in Cleveland? Do they have tricks up their sleeves?
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:34.840]  Does the bear live in the woods? And what will happen in the general election?
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.080]  Well, you know Trump's going to go after and call for her indictment. You know he's going to take
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:43.800]  the gloves off. So the question is, will they try to assassinate him? Will they try to co-opt him?
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:48.280]  Will they try to steal the election? Will they start a war and plow the dollar? I mean, the elite
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:52.840]  are scared. But now you've got the Chinese government saying, okay, let's try to reconcile.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.880]  Cameron says, okay, let's be nice to Trump. I'm going to apologize. The Republican Party says,
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:03.000]  maybe we should go ahead and go with Trump. This is an epic historical moment. And the question is,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.840]  he's known him 40 years. My first question, I hope this isn't the art of the deal, though,
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:12.840]  where Trump's just bringing them to heel, crushing the establishment, riding away of
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:19.720]  populism, and then he makes a deal with them, I guess, to make him emperor or something. Who knows?
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:24.120]  But the word is, he's a patriot and does want to make America great again. I think we've heard
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:28.200]  that before. So Roger Stone, I tell you, this is an epic moment. Thank you for joining us.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:33.080]  Great to be here, Alex. It just shows you how quickly politics can change.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:39.560]  My original plan, as you know, is to come on this show and reveal Ted Cruz's plan
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:45.960]  to steal the Republican Convention. I actually have a draft of the rules change that they were
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:53.240]  circulating. I had a list of billionaires they were soliciting for a bribe fund. And I was
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:59.080]  prepared to lay this out for the American people right here on infowars.com. Overnight,
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:04.200]  things have changed. Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:11.080]  It is, for me, a great day, because it's the culmination of a quest that I began in 1988,
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:17.880]  when I realized that Trump had the size and the stature and the toughness to be president,
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.720]  and that he wasn't beholden to the two-party duopoly and the political establishment that's
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:32.680]  run this country into the gutter. The Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama policies, which are identical,
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:38.200]  that have brought us to the brink of disaster. I don't think you have to have any concerns
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:45.880]  about Donald Trump. No one owns him. He is not a globalist. That foreign policy speech just days
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:54.760]  ago needs to be re-read, because that is the blueprint for Trumpism, a new, proud supporter
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:12:01.960]  of American sovereignty, someone who wants to restore both American economic policy and military
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:08.040]  strength, or should say economic strength and military strength. That is the real Donald Trump.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:14.200]  You don't have to worry about him betraying us. He knows exactly who opposes us, the Chinese
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:22.120]  government, the Mexican government, the pope. The list goes on and on. A man is defined by
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:31.000]  his enemies. Now, I did an interview on BBC this morning. Alex, it was brutal, just brutal. The
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.120]  world establishment is apoplectic about the rise of Trump. But this is a force of nature. He is
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:45.400]  not going to be stopped. He is Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare. Let's talk about where you
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:51.320]  expect this to go. A, will they still try to steal it, or has that whole hoax of claiming there's no
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:56.680]  popular vote? The party can do whatever it wants. Has that now imploded? I think it has imploded
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:05.720]  with the folding of John Kasich today on top of the fact that Ted Cruz threw in the towel last night.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:11.240]  Opposition now in the Republican Party, I think, evaporates. Alex, I have to pay some tribute
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:17.960]  to you because I think you played an important role in informing liberty voters and those who
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:23.400]  were prepared to take on the world new order that Ted Cruz was not the real deal, that he was a push
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:30.600]  family retainer posing as a constitutionalist, but that Donald Trump is the only candidate,
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.240]  not beholden to the special interests, not beholden to the political establishment,
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:41.560]  and a real nationalist. For the first time, we have an American nationalist. He's got the
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:46.280]  resoluteness, the toughness to take on Hillary. He's not going to have the kind of arrangement
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.280]  that Jeb had with him. You see, there was an arrangement. Jeb wouldn't bring up her worst
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:56.600]  sins. She wouldn't bring up Jeb's worst sins. Jeb would lose gracefully and go on to make millions
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:01.320]  of dollars out of his association with the Clinton administration. Those kind of backroom
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:08.440]  deals are off. Donald Trump is very definitely the real deal, but I'll tell you my most immediate
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:15.320]  concern. A group called USA Priorities, or I think it's Priorities USA, announced that they will
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:23.560]  unleash a $20 million media blitz immediately after the California primary June 7. This is right
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:29.240]  out of the Clinton playbook. It's precisely what the Clintons did to Bob Dole, a former boss of mine,
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:36.200]  in 1996, where they go to a period in which the Republican candidate has no funding.
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:41.960]  They use their funding from George Soros and other criminals to define him. So this is our
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:48.040]  immediate goal. Now, Trump's opposition to super PACs is well known. There is a group out there
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:56.200]  that I need to alert you about. It's called Great America PAC. It's a scam, a fraud. If people get
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:01.160]  solicitations, they should know that this group claimed that they spent a million dollars in
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:09.960]  Wisconsin to support Trump on television. They spent zero headed by N. Rollins, a longtime critic of
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:16.680]  Donald Trump, and Jesse Benton, the guy who ran Rand Paul's campaign into the ditch. This is not in
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:21.320]  any way an authorized... Oh, well, Jesse Benton's involved running around acting like he's with
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.720]  Trump. Wow. I saw articles where they had the Trump lawyers telling that group to stop last week,
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:29.880]  and then basically Trump people saying, you're the only real group out there. That's not even a
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:36.520]  PAC. You're just promoting free speech. Well, look, there has to be some mechanism to fill this gap.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:43.160]  I'm aware of the fact that Donald Trump is, I think, constitutionally and philosophically opposed
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:50.120]  to super PACs, but that's because of the corrosive influence of lobbyists and special interest money
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:58.040]  that floods those PACs. On the other hand, Trump cannot be naked in this period while the Clintons
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:02.440]  move quickly to try to define him. Well, I've got to stop you. Let's just go back and look,
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:05.080]  and this isn't bragging about Roger Stomer to skip this break. It's a limited time,
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.960]  and I wish it could stay longer, sir. This is so important when we're talking about here,
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:11.800]  but people understand you foresaw when you first came on 10 months ago, they'd try to
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:16.840]  steal it with Richard Reeves. You came to visit me here in Austin, so gracious to come here and
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:21.400]  warn me. You let it all out. Your organization, my audience, and others at the core, but let's
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.640]  really give you credit, but the audience deserves most of it, took action, got involved. The media
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:31.080]  said, stop claiming we'll steal it. Your conspiracy theorists, stop claiming we won't honor the voters.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:35.160]  Then they went from saying that to going, yeah, we're going to steal it. We're allowed to. They
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:39.800]  tried to sell that. We forced them to sell it early. It blew up in their face because you were
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:45.000]  exposing it early. They were forced to try to sell it. It blew up, I think, brought down Cruz,
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:51.320]  Kasich, and the Republican establishment, and accelerated catapulting him as the true populace,
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.080]  and my reporters, again, I don't know why we're in the zeitgeist, all over the country caught the
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:01.160]  Mexican flags, the beating people up, the George Soros funded people. That has accelerated Trump.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:07.400]  I just hope the Trump campaign knows, because I'm proud of my crew. It's not me. My crew,
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:11.640]  I'm telling you, is good for two or three points he's got nationally. InfoWars is
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:17.240]  devastating the Trumpian opposition. Well, in fact, Donald Trump himself told me that
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:22.360]  he has seen so many of your supporters and listeners at his rallies. He loves the Hillary
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:27.800]  for Prison t-shirts, and he knows exactly where they came from. So, Alex, I'm certain that he is
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:33.640]  grateful for your support and support of other patriots who have stepped forward here to try to
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:39.560]  clear the mainstream media myths about Donald Trump. I was about to say, just interrupt again.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.800]  It's not about even credit. I want listeners and viewers to know you're having an effect. Stone's
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:49.320]  having an effect. I am our crew. This is history. We're in an epic fight, and we are beating the
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.720]  living, you know what, out of the enemy. I'm sorry, Roger. You got the floor. Tell us what's
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:57.880]  coming next, how we defeat Clintons, how we keep this guy alive, and what we do in Cleveland.
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:02.280]  Well, look, we all know what Hillary Clinton's greatest single vulnerability is.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:09.240]  She claims to be an advocate for women. In fact, her husband is a serial sexual predator.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:15.160]  Whatever you try to say that on CNN, they literally unplug your microphone. They did it to my friend
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:21.640]  Steve Malzburg. They did it to my friend Kirk Schleister. They've done it to me. Don Lemon
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:28.680]  is delusional. He's in denial about the facts. So, I have no doubt that the women themselves,
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:37.160]  brave women, Juanita Broderick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones, and Sally Miller,
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:43.400]  and others will come forward and tell in detail of their abuse at the hands of Bill Clinton
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:50.600]  and their abuse at the hands of Hillary. So, we can get rid of the myth of Hillary as women's
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.080]  enemies. This won't be a Republican establishment where they wear gloves and it's already predetermined
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:59.480]  like a Don King boxing match. This is going to be Donald Trump savaging that witch.
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:05.080]  He has no choice. Look, we both remember when John McCain traveled up and down the country
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:10.840]  talking about what a great U.S. Senator and a great American Barack Obama was. That is not
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:17.960]  the way to win this fight. And Donald Trump is above all a scrapper. He's a fighter. He's a brawler.
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:22.600]  He knows how tough this will be. He knows that organizationally, we're behind the eight ball.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:29.080]  But we're in catch-up mode. This is going to be the most exciting political contest in my lifetime.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:33.400]  I haven't been this excited since Ronald Reagan defeated the Republican establishment
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:38.680]  or not to become president. It's sad that his administration was co-opted by George
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:45.960]  Herbert Walker Bush, who essentially ended Reaganism with his tax increases in his international
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:51.960]  trade deals. If you noticed last night in his remarks, he focused right on NAFTA and the way
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:57.720]  it has sucked the jobs out of America. He knows who the enemy is. He will give no quarter. Get
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:02.600]  ready for President Donald J. Trump. Well, I mean, I know Trump's very, very private and even his
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.120]  buddy when he's divorced or his wingman, that's well known, one of his best friends out there.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:10.120]  But I've talked to a lot of prominent people even before Trump was running and then when he was,
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:14.600]  people would say, what do you think of Trump? And I'd say, yeah, I mean, I know he's a good guy
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:19.080]  over all and some things and he kind of, you know, just a businessman. They'd say, no, you know,
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:22.680]  no, he knows about what's going on. He's a patriot. And later I found out for 30 years,
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:26.360]  he gave money to try to stop NAFTA and GATT and other globalist operations. This has been a big
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.040]  cricket of it. But now I've talked to other prominent people like Dr. Corsi this morning, 40 years
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.640]  in business and others. And they say, no, no, no, Trump knows everything we know and more.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:39.800]  He's basically a sleeper cell for patriots. He knows all about the New World Order,
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.880]  Federal Reserve, everything. And since then he's talked some about it. He just puts it in popular
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:49.560]  terms. Is that accurate that that's why they're so scared of him as they know he really is probably
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:55.400]  beyond Reagan? Yeah, he's got their number and they know it. You can't put anything over on Donald
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:01.800]  Trump. He's both tough and wise. And what they really, I think, fear is his combative nature.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:06.200]  Let me address this question of the two Trumps because there's only one Donald Trump.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:12.600]  He's a guy who marches to his own drummer. He is a guy who is his own idea man, his own speech
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:19.000]  writer. So unlike most of these politicians, Alex, he's not operating off of polls or focus groups
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  or reading some speech written by a 25 year old. He's his own man. And he has a vision for this
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.840]  country. It's a vision of American strength and American sovereignty. And this is why he scares
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:37.320]  the bejesus out of the political establishment. I'm looking forward for an epic battle. And yeah,
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:42.200]  we're playing catch up ball. No question about it. But we'll get there. He will be fully competitive.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:46.520]  Now Hillary Clinton is going to have a billion dollars. And the truth is Donald Trump has been
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:52.760]  so busy fending off 16 rivals for the Republican nomination. He has not yet turned to the question
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:58.760]  of financing the general election. We've got a lot of work to do. And we are behind. But by the end
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:04.520]  of this convention, we will be battle ready. Incredible. I don't put it past them. You're
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:08.680]  the expert still trying some hanky-panky in California or other areas and then claiming, oh,
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:12.840]  we thought he was presumptive, but this happened. But I mean, I kind of overall agree with you,
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:18.600]  though. It seems like the resolve of the Republican rhinos and others has totally collapsed. They are
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:23.480]  so discredited. And you know, people are saying, oh, this hurts the Republican party. The Democrats
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:28.280]  are saying that no, he's brought more people in than Reagan did. And it seems like they're upside
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:34.440]  down bizarro world is being completely reversed right now. I expect to see surging numbers now
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:39.400]  for Trump. Well, first of all, I point out that he's already brought the deficit between Hillary,
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:47.000]  he and Hillary Clinton down to single digits. And her unfavorable is 55. Is this 65? That's a 10
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:53.320]  point gap. Now, in all honesty, we can refire her unfavorable ratings just by taking on her record.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:58.280]  I like a lot of the things that Bernie Sanders says, particularly on trade and war, but frankly,
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:03.960]  he hasn't gone at her at her greatest areas of vulnerability, her abuse of women, her disastrous
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:10.680]  tenure as Secretary of State, and then of course, the massive corruption of the Clinton Foundation,
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:16.200]  which isn't a charitable organization. It's a slush fund for grifters. It's a vehicle for
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:21.480]  facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes. I've sent it here before, and I'll say it again,
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:28.200]  remember, Donald Trump was conducted giving $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. He thought he was
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:33.720]  helping children through a charitable foundation. He didn't know it was a fraud. This gives him
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:40.680]  standing to bring a federal lawsuit for fraud and open up their entire phony deal to the scrutiny
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:45.480]  of the American people. All right, Roger Stone, I want to in the six, seven minutes we have left,
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:48.920]  get into some of the other things they're up to. Media Matters, as you know, is openly run by the
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:53.880]  White House, and they said a bunch of articles yesterday. Fox host Trump is pivoting into the
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:59.080]  Alan Jones presidency with his conspiracy theories. Well, I mean, I'm glad that, you know,
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:04.520]  you've got Ted Cruz, it's old news now, but it's an example. His dad attacking Trump saying he's
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:09.320]  basically Satan incarnate. And so he just points to a Wayne Madsen report from m4s.com. It was
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:14.600]  also in the inquirer later, looking at some of the CIA possible backgrounds of his father,
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:21.800]  but then he acts like Trump mugged his father. He was just fighting back when he's being attacked.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:26.360]  You know, if Cruz's father says Trump is the devil, then he can say, hey, it's
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:31.240]  being reported in the news. This guy's got CIA connections, possibly, but that just shows how
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:36.920]  desperate they are. And I think Trump should get more, you know, more quote conspiratorial,
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.840]  because we know there's corruption. We know there's stuff going on. I think you should get into
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:46.280]  fashion furious more about how he'll call for the indictment of Hillary, more about how he'll go
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:51.160]  after these criminals. I think that's the key. Well, as you know, Alex, anytime someone goes
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:56.040]  out there and blurts out the truth, the response of the mainstream media is to try to discredit
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:02.040]  them with that with that title conspiracy theorist. Even though I think it's somewhat extraneous,
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:08.040]  let's address this. I had an email last night from Judith Berry Baker. She's a friend. She's also
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:16.600]  indisputably was Lee Harvey Oswald's girlfriend from 1961 to 1963. She knew Raphael Cruz well.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:23.720]  She confirms that he was part of Lee Harvey Oswald's crew. Wow. So also, if one will simply do
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:31.160]  a computer analysis of the facial aspects in the photo, which yes, appeared in the National Inquirer,
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:37.160]  but was released by the Warren Commission with a current photo of Raphael Cruz,
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.480]  it's a perfect match. By the way, we know the Bushes, it was later declassified. Herbert Walker
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:46.440]  was heavily involved, quarterbacking the operations in New Orleans. Garrison others looked at that.
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:50.840]  And so of course, he comes out of the Bushes because he's always been there. This all points
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:55.320]  towards that. Kit Daniels wrote about it. And so that just shows folks when you mess with Trump,
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:00.680]  he takes the gloves off. Well, he's fearless. And that is the point. So some people say,
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:06.360]  well, why did he even raise this? You're exactly exactly right, Alex. Raphael Cruz attacked him.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:12.120]  Donald Trump, if you attack Trump, get ready to get smashed back in the teeth. That's the way he
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:19.000]  fights. He's a brawler. So this is not a guy who turns the other cheek. And what was it that
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.160]  Ted Cruz called him yesterday? A kook, a philanderer, some glasshouse stuff there, if you ask me.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:33.320]  A logical liar. A logical liar. Let me get this straight. The guy who claimed that his wife
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:39.400]  cashed in her retirement, Goldman Sachs, to finance his Senate campaign. And it later turns
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:45.480]  out that none of that happened. In fact, they took a million dollar secret sweetheart loan from
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:50.120]  Goldman Sachs. He's calling Trump a pathological liar. Absolutely. Let's stop right there. We've
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:54.840]  got a few minutes left. Other key tidbits, Roger Stone, consummate Trump insider. What do we do
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.880]  to help Trump, to help the American people? What's the next shooting drop? What are you
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:04.680]  worried about? I mean, first off, what would you call last night? How epic a victory is that? It
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:09.400]  seems like a total collapse of the establishment. Now they're going to activate the Ford Foundation,
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:15.000]  Soros, Black Lives Matter, foreign nationals say they're going to burn stuff down in riot.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.560]  That sounds like a way to get Trump elected. These people are so delusional. Don't they get it? We
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:25.480]  have decided to finally fight back. The political correctness is over. The mind control is over.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:31.320]  The sleeping giant is rising. Is that accurate? I absolutely think so. So look, I have no question
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:37.880]  that the Black Lives Matter folks and the move on folks will be there in Cleveland. As you know,
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:43.800]  we were working together to form a massive outdoor march and rally to stop the steal.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:49.960]  I'm going to be conferring with all the groups, citizens for Trump, bikers for Trump, women for
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:55.640]  Trump, dentists for Trump this afternoon to figure out how we're going to move forward. We're now
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:01.880]  thinking of changing that to a unity rally because I can tell you, Donald Trump has been actively
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:08.280]  reaching out to some of his former opponents. They're very productive conversations coming
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:14.520]  together. I see a united Republican party. There's a fringe out there, the never Trump people.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:19.080]  I agree, but we should have it as a unity rally, but in reserve in case they try to steal again
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:24.840]  and have it be a pro America unity rally. Absolutely. That's very exciting. Yeah. On the other hand,
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:29.880]  if you've already made plans to come to Cleveland, don't cancel your plans. Everybody's got to come
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:34.840]  there. We've got to be ready for any eventuality. Oh, look, this is history. I mean, we've got to
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.960]  be there to outnumber the Soros people 10 to one and the police are on the side of free speech,
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:43.240]  and they hate the, you know, the commie groups. So we're going to be great. Everybody's be there.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:50.280]  Well, unlike the Black Lives Matter and the other far left demonstrators, we've applied for a permit
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.760]  with the city of Cleveland. We're cooperating with the Cleveland police department. They have helped
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:29:01.160]  map out our march route. They've helped us select our rally location. We stand with those men and
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:06.600]  women in law enforcement. As you know, Alex, the Black Lives Matter folks, the move on folks,
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:12.520]  they don't, they don't apply for permits. They just show up. And let's be very clear about what
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:20.520]  their goal is. It is to provoke violence. It is to incite. And we stand against it and we videotape
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:25.560]  it nationwide peacefully with our brave reporters and are exposing it. And it's incredible. Stop
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.560]  the steal. More and more is still important. But what's the best site for everything that's
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:34.440]  happening with Trump, Roger Stone? Well, I think you stay tuned right now to stop the steal. There'll
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:40.440]  be new information there. Stop the steal.org to bring you up to date on what our plans are for
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:47.880]  Cleveland. But above all, we cannot be provoked or incited to violence because the mainstream media
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:55.240]  will then absolutely hold on one second. The empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:05.080]  Joe Bix here with info wars.com report authorities buying more riot control gear over fear of
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:10.200]  civil unrest sweeping America. The report published by Sandler research says that the demand for
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:14.760]  surveillance drones is driving growth with new systems that deploy water cannons to handle
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:19.880]  large crowds and demonstrations also proving popular. Riot control systems are expected to
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:26.280]  generate revenues of over 3.5 billion US dollars by the end of 2020 with North America being one
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:31.240]  of the primary growth areas for upgraded weapons due to militarization of the police department and
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:36.840]  other law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the 2014 riots in Ferguson, Missouri. Purchases
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:41.480]  of long range acoustic devices, whips, batons and armored vehicles that will be used to disperse
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:46.760]  control and arrest people involved in riots and protests are also on the rise. In Cleveland,
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:51.480]  they are ramping up their right gear as well in the aftermath of what they think will be
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:56.680]  an extremely volatile situation at this year's Republican National Convention. This has been

[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:32.520]  All the Republican establishment hacks are out there trying to tell us that we don't have free
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:39.240]  elections. They tried to sell that con artist fraud and desperate bid that was just beyond
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:44.200]  anything I've ever seen. It was like the emperor's new clothes pair to book, written large in the
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:54.520]  21st century. But it all blew up with their stinking faces. Quite frankly, I have not done this
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:59.480]  since six years ago when the Copenhagen secret world government document got leaked during the
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:06.600]  big UN summit and it had the Russians hacked the computers as well and got the documents that the
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:12.920]  entire carbon footprint deal and the carbon tax and global warming was a fraud. The big universities
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:17.080]  knew it was all a fraud. They knew it was all a lie. They were directing the other universities to
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:26.440]  hide the decline. I had the crew go get a bottle of champagne and I think, we'll also get some great
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:30.840]  juice, kid champagne for folks that don't want any of that. But I think at the end of the show
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:37.000]  today, I'm going to have some champagne here. Just a little glass for everybody in the office
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.080]  that would like to take just one little taste because I haven't done this in six years.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:46.840]  Even if Trump loses, even if they assassinate him, we've won devastating victories exposing
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:52.760]  globalism, rekindling nationalism, showing how hoax media works, discrediting the scum,
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:58.360]  watching trusted media drop the last year from 14 points to six points in the AP poll, the lowest
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:05.880]  ever. This is a Death Star destruction event. I need to saber this more. I'm always so on
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:13.000]  attacking the enemy, moving to the next fight, but we really should take some time out to celebrate
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.280]  what's happened. I'm not a big drinker, but I forget what it is. My mom gets it on holidays
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:23.080]  sometimes on weddings and things. It's the French champagne that has the orange label
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:28.840]  with a little butterfly, 45 bucks. It's a good, good to champagne. I mean, $100 bottles aren't
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.520]  as good. I forget the name of it. It's one of the tops. Just type in top sellers and show like
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:37.400]  three different types of champagne. And let's get some bottles of that here for the end of the show.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:41.080]  I want to get the reporters and people, anybody else wants to celebrate in here with some little
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:45.400]  plastic champagne glasses, maybe go to specs for some big place that will have it all.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:51.960]  And let's get some more derbs and some other drinks and stuff, non-alcoholic beverages,
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:58.120]  and let's kind of just lay out a buffet here. Nothing fancy, just some more derbs and stuff.
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:02.520]  And by fancy, I mean, I don't want to have a huge layout that takes over, but let's, let's lay it out
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:07.640]  here for the last segment in, into the fourth hour and just to have some champagne together.
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:12.440]  I'm only down this once on air. I probably won't even do it if Trump gets elected because then
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:16.680]  they might have a big depression and blaming on him. And there's some major angles there. If he
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:20.280]  turns out to be for real and we have victory against the globalist, I'll, I'll, you know,
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:26.680]  have three weeks of celebration, but I tell you, we can defeat evil. And they try to train us that
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:33.000]  you can't win and only evil has power and there's no such thing as good. That's all a fraud in
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.360]  history. I've studied history. Evil is weak, but it convinces good men and women. They have no power.
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:43.240]  The quote, Thomas Jefferson, all the evil men in tyranny, the flourish is that good men do nothing.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:50.040]  We are creating the narrative. We are putting out the issues. We are turning the tide. We're
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:59.960]  telling the truth and previous and curly and Cruz and all the King's horses and all the King's men
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:07.960]  could not sell that it doesn't matter if he wins. We get all the delegates and Cruz has been forced
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:12.120]  to now claim, Oh, I don't get to just take these delegates and he used to, he goes steal Trump
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:17.320]  delegates when he won States. He's just quit and he quit because everybody hates him now. He has
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:22.360]  crowds of like a hundred people coming out and Trump has 50,000. Even though the Soros group
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:27.800]  shows up, tries to block the entrance so he can't get a crowd and kills his photo up. They've got
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:41.400]  the touch of death, not the touch of Midas, but they've got the touch of living death. They've
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:49.160]  got the touch of losers of con men of dishonorable filth bags. And by the way, when George will
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:53.000]  have never really even attacked fake milk toast conservative to kind of steer and control, I
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  never really attacked towards will. He's pathetic. He's there to keep people that watch mainstream
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.120]  TV in a coma. But when he came out and said, look, we don't go with the popular vote, the
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:08.120]  plurality of the people, we have a sovereign system. He said, I am royalty. You are trash.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:13.400]  No, you're a stuff suit, fake intellectual. And I viciously attacked him.
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.760]  You know, instead of trying to blow the republic's brains out, I made the point that, you know,
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:22.120]  I don't want anything that bad happened to him. But I mean, you know, he wants to kill the country.
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:26.840]  How about he just leaves the country? Nobody goes and jumps off, you know, in a lake or something
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:33.640]  or flies a kite with a copper string during a thunderstorm. I mean, just get out of our way,
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:40.200]  man. But this whole fleet of pundits all over TV, all over radio. But you know what? A few people,
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:44.440]  as slimy as Bill O'Reilly is and stuff, he wouldn't come out against the popular vote.
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:50.600]  Neither would rush Limbaugh completely. Neither would Sean Hannity. You know why? It's not that
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:57.480]  there aren't establishment types overall, but they don't hate the country deep down in their gut.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:05.000]  Bill O'Reilly, it's a little different. That guy's a pretty bad niche. But they knew their audience
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:13.640]  would not go with it. They would destroy themselves. They would dishonor themselves,
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:17.320]  shelling that, oh, you don't have votes. That's what Hannity would say to me. Say, listen,
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:20.280]  you're one of my best buddies. I have you on more than anybody. I pushed your campaign, but
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:25.880]  you got to have popular vote in this. And people are mad. They're, oh, listen, I won the popular
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:34.760]  vote. I had a landslide. He goes, no, you didn't. Stop it. And he told him stop it because he knew
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:39.000]  no one was buying it. See, you hit that moment where even the people in the establishment that
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.360]  don't care about the truth, they care about themselves, don't they? The New World Order is
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:49.080]  not good for business. The New World Order is not good for prosperity. These people want to tell
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:56.120]  us father and mother's hateful or he or she is hateful. That's a fricking loan cult that two
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:02.280]  plus two equals five and raising the debt doesn't raise the debt. And all the rest of their, and
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:06.840]  they're not coming after our guns. And he never said boots on the ground in Syria. You said it
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:11.560]  16 times. We're done. And you can have, and I'm going to go to your calls right now. You can have
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:20.680]  Gutfield or whatever his name is, you know, the trendy ironic guy, Alex says, man, I ought to
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.400]  pay that guy to make fun of me and say how horrible I am to have a discredited, bloated
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:30.360]  group that sells diapers and catheters. That's half their ads.
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:39.160]  All he catheters off, you know, the country's essence, making fun of me with the Bush hack
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:45.880]  they've got on there. And then Juan Williams. I mean, a collection of pseudo-intellectual traders.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:56.680]  But see, they know I see through it all. They're trying to target their audience.
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:04.280]  And Fox News admits they've lost massive ratings. In fact, in one of their key demographics,
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:09.960]  they've lost half their viewers. About 20% overall have left them. And they ain't coming back, Jack.
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:14.600]  By the way, when there's other hosts that are eloquent and pro-liberty and get it and aren't
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:23.160]  backstabbing, weird, mentally ill, hyper-aggressive, beta, false, dominant, false alphas, our problem
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:28.040]  in society is not real alpha males. Real alpha males want to empower humanity. Alpha females do.
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:31.320]  They just don't want to be run over. They're loving. They're helpful. They've got courage.
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:37.320]  It's all these fake alphas that are really mentally ill betas that are running around trying to
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:41.240]  dominate anybody else that wants to build something. But I have everybody else on that
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:45.000]  isn't mentally ill. I have all the other talk show hosts on, other websites. I love it.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.040]  I push everybody. I can care less. I want more people that are prominent. If I find somebody
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:54.840]  better than I am, and boy, there should be out there, shouldn't they? I would put my energy
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:02.680]  behind them. I would right now because look, I got courage folks, but I'm not looking to get
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:06.600]  a bullet in my head. I'm not looking to get put in a gulag. I mean, if we lose this thing,
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:10.520]  I'm gambling here, but there's no gamble at the end of the day, even if I get destroyed,
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:15.320]  because selling out the tyranny is the ultimate death and I'm not doing it. Coward dies a thousand
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:24.600]  deaths. A man dies a single death. And I'm not going to have a living death where I sell out
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:31.400]  and want to be in New York and LA with all these desperate, scared, neurotic, mentally ill
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:39.000]  anchors and fruit bags. That's why I don't get selling out.
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:43.400]  Why would you sell out to?
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:49.800]  It'd be like if you were in space and there was a ghost at the portal, when they come out here,
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:54.360]  it's fine. I love you, trendy. And you went, sure, to open the hot bay door and you're sucked out in
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:43:02.680]  space and die. You sell out to that. But I get it. People feel down. They don't have status or money
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:06.840]  and the big fancy people with the teleprompters up on TV. They're so powerful. I'm going to your
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:12.600]  calls, but let's play this clip. Fox host, Trump is pivoting into the Alex Jones presidency with
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:18.840]  his conspiracy theories. And now we have the lady that worked at the big lab and was tied into
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:25.400]  Oswald and knew him on record. That's documented. Oh yeah, she knew Cruz's daddy. Pretty big news
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:31.640]  that just broke. A lot of evidence pointing at that. I mean, Cruz is a CIA globalist red diaper
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:35.480]  doper baby. I would call him a red diaper baby. What do you call a CIA baby? A globalist foundation
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:40.680]  baby. A Goldman Sachs diaper baby. But let's go ahead and play that clip. Here it is.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:46.600]  Now we go in depth. Serious. I think we're missing the biggest story of the day.
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:53.800]  Oh no. Imagine if Hillary Clinton claimed that Bernie Sanders had a role in the killing of Bobby
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:44:00.520]  Kennedy. We would be going crazy right now. Yes. We'd be going wall to wall. But no,
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:08.920]  are we about to achieve a historical first in electing the first conspiracy freak president?
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:12.760]  I mean, is this the pivot we've been talking about? He's not pivoting from presidential.
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:17.240]  He's pivoting to Alex Jones. He's pivoting to crazy. And why isn't it news?
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:26.120]  It's unusual that somehow it's not news when Trump does it. It's kind of funny. Wait, wait,
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:30.600]  will you tell the people what you're talking about? What about the national, the national
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:38.040]  choir reading the story saying that Ted Cruz's father was present with Lee Harvey Oswald Oswald
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:43.800]  just days before the assassination of JFK? And now Trump has repeated the story.
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:49.960]  Oh my gosh. I mean, the inquirer is not news of the world that has bat boy. The inquirer,
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:55.640]  only a few times has been proven wrong. They've broken almost every scandal that's ever happened
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:02.120]  and been proven right. I mean, I remember talking to Wayne Madsen who broke this months ago
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:07.160]  on our show, our reporter, and he wasn't sure he was just investigating it, but he said it
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:12.680]  pointed towards it. And he's so smart, folks. He went to that place where Scalia died in southwest
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:17.320]  Texas with my other reporters and said, yeah, this is like Bohemian Grove. It's really creepy.
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:22.600]  I sense Dick Cheney, the books, the publications. I think this is Bohemian Grove. It came out a
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:27.320]  month later in the Washington Post. It was set up by Bohemian Grove as a spinoff secret society.
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:37.800]  That's how smart my reporters are. Almost like psychic. But, you know, whatever Madsen thinks
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:41.880]  that that's where it goes and his dad lived there, fits all into it, looks in the photos,
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:47.160]  connection to the bushes. I mean, it stinks. I haven't lied and said he was in Cuba under
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:52.120]  Fidel. He wasn't. He came here before that. So I don't know what the truth is, but his dad attacked
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:56.360]  first. So Trump can point out what's in the news. Now, let's stop right there. I want to go to your
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:01.720]  phone calls briefly. We've extended the special, but it is now only running till through Sunday.

[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:46.280]  going to go to Mike, then we're going to go to Lynn and Lee before our next guest comes on.
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:52.280]  Speak of the devil, Wayne Madsen. That means the devil. You know what's he saying? Speak of
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:58.680]  the guy and he'll appear. He's coming on about the situation with Cruz and his CIA daddy connection
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:04.360]  to the bushes, which the entire bush operation is CIA. I mean, it was so big
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:09.400]  that it's even connected as people that were in my family. I mean, it's like a giant
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:15.400]  combine operation. Uh, just over the top and the stuff it's involved in and people like,
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:18.760]  Oh, what did you say? I've said that before folks and I don't want to know the details
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:23.000]  that come kill me. Uh, but the point is, is that this, the shadow government is out of control
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:27.800]  and it comes out of Texas and New York and there's a few other places just so you know.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:33.320]  All right, let's go ahead and take a call. Let's talk to Robert in South Carolina. Robert,
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:38.520]  you're on the air. Welcome. Hey, thanks. I appreciate you taking the call. Yes, sir. Um,
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:43.240]  um, just with regard to what you've been talking about is to the options the elite have for trying
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:47.640]  to deal with Trump. I think there are three, there's three possibilities that occurred to me
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.560]  and they vary in orders of plausibility just depending, but especially if you bear in mind
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:58.680]  that the goal is to preserve the agenda and not necessarily for the Republican party to win in
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:05.000]  November. Uh, the most plausible one to me right off is the independent third party run that they've
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.760]  been threatening for so long. Only they can't do it. I don't think they can anyway. They can't do
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:16.840]  it with a Kasek or with a Paul Ryan or with a Mitt Romney, because that would just exacerbate
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:21.240]  the grassroots rebellion that they're already seeing. It's already promoted Trump to where he
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:27.480]  is now. I think they would almost have to do it around Ted Cruz. He is the one who has,
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:32.920]  he's gone the distance, you know, most comparatively, uh, next to Trump and he has an,
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:36.200]  I'm an evangelical Christian and I can tell you my evangelical friends,
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:41.880]  so many of them are just fanatically devoted to careers. There's a fanaticism that surrounds him.
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:46.920]  Well, that's because they said he is the Christ, basically. Glenn Beck said he is the Christ.
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:51.400]  And so you get to believe you're in the Christ fighting the devil. It's just total manipulation.
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:57.160]  Right. And it's, I mean, there's no easier basis to use to manipulate people than if they think
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:00.680]  that they're fighting the devil himself. Oh, they come out and say that myself and Drudger
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:05.560]  being anti-Christian because we're saying they're operating like a cult. I'm a Christian. Uh, Drudge
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:10.520]  defends Christians constantly being murdered around the world. We're saying don't claim you speak for
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:16.680]  God and say that Donald Trump is the devil and the risen serpent. That is a load of malarkey.
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:22.840]  Oh yeah, it definitely is, but there's so much group think among evangelicals. There's so much
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:27.320]  cult of personalities. So many of them are used to being told what to think as opposed to how.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:31.640]  Oh yeah, they get, they get hin-pecked if they don't do what they're told. Yeah. Oh yeah. And I
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:36.600]  believe they get shamed into, into blind obedience and that sort of thing. Yeah. I mean, when you
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:39.240]  get into the Christian church, whatever it's Catholic, evangelical, whatever, there's a lot
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:42.920]  of great people, a lot of bad people, but some of these churches are cults. They want your money.
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:47.080]  They want to break up families. They want to get your cash. They want to get your house when you
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:52.920]  die. And the preachers are these demonic, swollen little corporate pimps. I grew up around them
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:58.040]  in Dallas with the biggest names, having sex with hookers every night snorting cocaine.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:02.440]  They are devil worshipers. Are you prepared to bug out infidel body armor and an army ranger

[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:30.760]  I'll be gone like I said, sweetheart. She's lay there in your bed.
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:36.280]  You would say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:41.480]  Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:45.160]  You think Johnny Cash wrote that one? He had a little experience with women?
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:50.920]  I love women. But when they get mad, they lay there in their bed out.
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:55:00.040]  All right, let's go right back to your phone calls. I want to go to John in Australia as soon as
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:05.320]  we can, but Alex has been holding in Colorado and a lot of other great patriots like Mike and
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:10.280]  others. Alex, thank you for calling in. I said this earlier if you're a new listener.
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:15.160]  What are the scenarios? They're still coming after Trump. They're going to try to manufacture
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:20.040]  stuff. They're going to try to kill him. We're going to try to co-opt him. This is an epic
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:23.960]  time to be alive, folks. This is incredible. Trump wins in a landslide yesterday,
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:31.400]  and the Bush minion has resigned, but I don't trust he's gone forever. Alex, what do you think?
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:37.000]  I had a crack at beer with my wife last night, and I'm glad you guys are doing it up there,
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.760]  because I think that this is a time to celebrate, and I think we have won a great victory.
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:47.080]  We could make it fun to fight even if we don't win this war. We're not going to stop.
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:51.640]  Go ahead. You better believe it. Absolutely. They're just like you said. You want to fight,
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:57.880]  you've got one. As a Christian and a veteran, I kind of go along with the last caller, but I
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:04.840]  also want to say that God puts people in power, and he's put Obama in power to wake us up. As a
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:09.640]  form of judgment on this country, he's put God in power, and you've seen it's divided people,
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:14.040]  and we've seen the real sickos on one side, and then we've seen patriots on the other.
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:17.880]  And a lot of people lost for Cruz are kind of like the baby boomer generation that grew up
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:22.360]  with the TV. They believe Fox News never lies or still good people, and I know a lot of them,
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:27.000]  and they're going to vote for Trump now that Cruz is out. He is going to win in a landslide,
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.240]  and I want to tell you, from my spiritual discernment, just how I know that you're real,
[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:37.640]  I know Trump is real too. Yes, he's carnal. Yes, he's a man of the flesh, and I get that.
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.680]  We're all sinners. We're all men of the flesh, but he will not compromise. I see three scenarios.
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:46.280]  One, they're going to run the third party on them. They're going to try to kill them,
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:53.160]  or they're going to try and put someone in his VP and then try it later on. Or they're going to try
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:59.720]  and pull a Matt Bracken type of scenario where right before the presidency, they're going to pull
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:04.840]  some big old scenario. Oh, I agree. They could plunge the economy. They can barely hold it back
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:09.160]  now. Start a huge war. I'm telling you, folks, you can feel it. This is an epic time to be alive,
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:17.160]  though, isn't it? It's amazing. Have you ever had William Portion on the writer of The One Second
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:22.920]  After? And he's also wrote a new book about ISIS attacking. It's called Day of Wrath,
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:27.560]  a great book. I've heard of it. I want to get him on. Absolutely. And then what is the elite going
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:32.760]  to do when they brought the ISIS people in clearly out of Syria? This is ISIS, a large percentage.
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:35.800]  What are they going to do when they attack? I mean, we're going to hold these people
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:41.080]  accountable. And you know, they're scared. If Trump gets in, the ISIS groups hit, he's going to
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:46.680]  arrest the people that let him in. I mean, you just know that. My spirit says, get prepared.
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:52.840]  Get ready. Get your soul right. Get your heart right. But crazy times coming up. But God bless
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:58.520]  you. Absolutely. And God bless you, my friend. We go to Brighton. Come back with John in Australia
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:02.760]  and then Mike and then Lynn and Liam. Get to everybody. We got two other guys coming up,
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:08.360]  but I'll get to everybody. I don't sit up here on a high horse, but I don't cheat people. I don't
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:14.200]  screw people over. I help folks. I'm a loving person. I'm a good father. I see these Pharisees
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:18.440]  all day that go, I never looked at a Playboy magazine or whatever, and they're just hypocrites.
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:23.640]  Well, okay, fine. Did you ever go protest for undead children or unborn children? They're about
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:27.160]  to be dead. Undead children. I mean, did you ever go protest kids? They're about to kill?
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:31.480]  I mean, did you ever go stand up for anything? That's all I'm saying is I'm just sick of all
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:35.880]  these milk toast Christians all day telling everybody how to live. That'll be just perfect
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:39.720]  when they're not out there fighting tyranny. That's what I'm saying is your heart like King
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:43.960]  David wasn't perfect, but he had an evil. He stood up and he had courage. I want good to win.
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:50.520]  I want to, I want to stand up to evil. I can't help myself. Hey, how you doing? Good brother.
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:54.360]  Just recently started using your products. Everything you said about him is correct. Me
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:58.360]  and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here. Well,
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:02.120]  thank you, brother. It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to

[01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:24.840]  they've got a ton of money there. Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:31.560]  planet and then concentrated or maximum potency. They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:35.160]  and stuff, just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out. In my experience,
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:39.800]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source. So it's pretty
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:45.480]  exciting and I love it. Visit infowarsalife.com today to secure your super male vitality and

[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:53.080]  our dollars, praying, taking action, resisting, having courage, waking up, getting aggressive,
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:59.560]  realizing this fight is meant to make us. It is the animating contest. The journey is the
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:03.880]  destination. I want to go to John in Australia, but I want to play this clip. This is Obama at
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:07.960]  the Correspondence Dinner making jokes about the end of the republic. Here it is. Good evening,
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:18.120]  everybody. It is an honor to be here at my last, and perhaps the last, White House Correspondence
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:28.520]  Dinner. I got something big for you. You all look great. Fill them on your six. The end of the
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:33.320]  republic has never looked better. Man, they're bringing us into world government right now.
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:41.400]  Look at that. Oh my, oh, it's so, that is the most cryptic. I'm getting like
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:46.360]  hot flashes beyond chills. Just my body is just looking at the evil in his eyes. We're watching
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:52.520]  on TV. Excuse me. But the good news is Australia fought back and repealed their carbon taxes,
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:57.480]  but more of a conservative end. Austria just did it. Other countries are doing it. We're
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:04.040]  getting ready to do it. We're taking action. John in Australia, thanks for calling. What's your
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:11.160]  view on the Trump phenomenon from 18,000 miles away? Good day, Alex. I'm a Trump supporter.
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:18.920]  I think that this war is going to go to the next level. And I actually think that you've
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:26.680]  done a terrific job, but you don't realize how much power you have in this war. And I think
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:33.560]  you can actually go to the next level. And I've got a couple ideas on what info wars could do
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:41.640]  to take the fight to the globalist. I'll give you an example. If the info warriors, and I know
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:45.720]  you've got millions... Yeah, let's say it. It's the audience that has the power. Yes. Go ahead.
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:54.760]  Exactly. There's 7,500 state politicians in America in all 50 states. So all you need to do
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:03:00.360]  is win half of that to take over every state. And I'm sure there's hundreds of thousands of info
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:06.680]  warriors who would be suited to do that job. Now, to take over the Republican Party, all you would
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:13.480]  need is about 100,000 people. I think you've got that 100,000 people in your audience. Well,
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:17.400]  we got behind Ron Paul's campaign for liberty that blew the breach and opened the door for
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:21.720]  libertarians and patriots to get in. And we're deep into that phase. So I'm just one part of it.
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:25.720]  But I mean, I think it's happening. And I think opening up the Republican Party for a Trump to
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:31.720]  come in is just phase one. He is riding that wave like on a surfboard. He saw it coming in and jumped
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:41.080]  on it. Absolutely. Second idea is how about the, how about info wars create a poster declaration
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:46.360]  of independence 2.0 against the globalist or against the new world order, and you would sell
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:51.800]  it to your listeners and your listeners would put it up in their homes and the whole family would
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:58.360]  sign the poster just like the founding fathers did in 1776. And you would list all the grievances of
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:02.760]  the globalist. And by the way, as you know, there's almost this, there is a spiritual element to
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:07.560]  signing and committing. And that solidarity creates incredible unity. That is a great idea.
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:13.720]  And that would bring commitment and it would be a daily reminder to them and their family and
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:20.440]  their children that they're in a war basically to the death. Well, we need you to do a show,
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:24.120]  John, do you got a show or something in Australia? We need all this natural smart talent to take
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:27.800]  action. You sound like a pretty smart guy. I mean, are you involved in the media?
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:35.320]  No, I'm not involved in the media. I'm an entrepreneur. Let me get your number or your email
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:39.800]  and let's have Rob do or somebody interview you for the nightly news and then I'll play a
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:43.640]  segment of it on the show or come on my show as a guest. Because I want to point out the human,
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:48.600]  the human talent is out there. And what John said is just a snapshot. All of it devastatingly
[02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:52.280]  good ideas. Great idea. John, I'm putting you on hold. You want to give us your contact info
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:56.360]  like to have you on as a guest. But regardless, we need to get that Declaration of Independence 2.0
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:02.200]  out. Absolutely fabulous idea. More calls coming up during a campaign stop in Philadelphia. A
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:09.160]  Hillary Clinton supporters stood up and urged Hillary to take on the NRA. We need you to be able
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:15.240]  to use your executive powers, the legislative, you can't carry guns in cars and Hillary's response
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:22.920]  to using executive orders to take our guns. Amen. Let the congregation say amen. Meanwhile,
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:29.400]  Chelsea Clinton says that gun control can finally be implemented now that Justice Scalia is dead.
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:35.240]  They believe the next time the court rules on gun control will make a definitive ruling. Well,
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:42.680]  here's a news flash for the Clintons. America doesn't have a gun problem. America has a gang
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:48.760]  problem. And in gun free zones like Chicago, there's already been over a thousand shootings this
[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:55.640]  year. And guess what? Not one of the shooters was a member of the NRA. Come and take it. And you can
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:06:01.480]  learn more right now at infowars.com. Hey, everyone. Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright

[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:20.600]  autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health
[02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:25.240]  challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you are dealing

[02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:22.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:39.080]  I think we're missing the biggest story of the day. I imagine if Hillary Clinton claimed
[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:46.280]  that Bernie Sanders had a role in the killing of Bobby Kennedy, we would be going crazy right now.
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:54.280]  We'd be going wall to wall. But no, are we about to achieve a historical first
[02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:59.800]  in electing the first conspiracy freak president? I mean, is this the pivot we've been talking about?
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:04.760]  He's not pivoting from presidential. He's pivoting to Alex Jones. He's pivoting to crazy.
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:13.480]  And why isn't it news? It's unusual that somehow it's not news when Trump does it.
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:20.120]  It's kind of funny. What are you talking about? What about the national require
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:27.400]  reading the story saying that Ted Cruz's father was present with Lee Harvey Oswald just days
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:33.960]  before the assassination of JFK. And now Trump has repeated the story. Now we go in-depth.
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:40.440]  Serious. We're missing the biggest story. Now continuing here, folks, that is a clip
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:45.080]  that media matters openly run by the White House. It's important to know that is the mouth of the
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:50.840]  White House saying that, you know, Trump is going full Alex Jones. Yes, one of our investigative
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:56.280]  journalists a few weeks ago broke it. Wayne Madsen. So many times he breaks something here
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:01.720]  and the inquirer has it two weeks a month later and he talks the inquirer. He's on the articles.
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:09.080]  And it is true that Cruz lived in New Orleans. Now, Roger Stone has talked to people that have been
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:14.680]  in and around the JFK case and who knew Lee Harvey Oswald. And they are saying that, yes, indeed,
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:23.320]  they knew Mr. Cruz's father and that indeed he was in and around Oswald. But the biggest
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:30.600]  connection is the Bushes, Herbert Walker Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush, ran the CIA in the
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:35.560]  mid 1970s from nowhere. Just suddenly he's the director and said he never been in the CIA.
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:41.880]  But later it was partially declassified that indeed he was in the CIA and was in Texas and
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:48.680]  Louisiana, New Orleans with the family oil company being used as a front for the Bay of Pigs.
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:54.200]  You name it. And who were they using as their manpower? Lee Harvey Oswald and a bunch of Cuba
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:59.320]  Nationals. And we have this photo from the Warren Commission. And we have Jim Garrison
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:04.040]  investigating and we have right when the investigation starts, the father of Ted Cruz
[02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:08.440]  running away and leaving New Orleans. So investigative journalist Wayne Madsen,
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:16.680]  the guy who went down with my crew the day after Scalia died and to the ranch that no other media
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:21.880]  would go to when they said no autopsy, no nothing, but Prince gets one and Merle Hager gets one.
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:27.160]  And he says, I believe this is connected to Bohemian Grove and Dick Cheney from what I've seen
[02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:30.760]  on the bookshelves, the way it's set up, everything and who's involved. A month later,
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:35.640]  the Washington Post comes out and says, Scalia died in secret society founded by Bohemian Grove.
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:40.840]  I mean, wow, the guys got a nose. Just for a TV viewer, let's just look at Wayne Madsen and just
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:45.800]  admire a true journalist right there. And we don't give out fake awards. We don't like the
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:49.560]  mainstream media and correspondent centers. He could go to those. This guy in the NSA,
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:55.560]  Andy Submarine warfare before that, decades as a journalist, every time I'm watching some
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:59.240]  C-SPAN hearing on 9-11 or something, they're in the backgrounds, Wayne Madsen, you know,
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:03.160]  they're at the National Press Club, you name it, a true patriot. He's only on for one segment
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.960]  with us popping in. He's on for 45 minutes tomorrow. Coming up, we have another investigative
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:13.080]  journalist, Mr. Rappaport on a ton of subjects joining us and your phone calls will continue,
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:22.360]  I promise, but to watch them freak out and to watch them come out and make front of Trump
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:29.880]  when he's being attacked by Cruz's father, who's saying he's the devil. And so you've got to vote
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:35.000]  for his son, the Christ, and you have the prophet, the false prophet, Glenn Beck over there,
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.080]  fooling all these good Christian people. That's fair. If you're saying I'm the devil
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:44.520]  and there's press reports connecting you to JFK and it's in the inquire that is one of the most
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:49.160]  accurate publications out there. This is not news of the world, folks. The inquire breaks most of
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:58.040]  the big scandals. But who broke it back on April 15th? Who broke it 17, 18, 19 days ago?
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:03.880]  Was Cruz's father linked to JFK assassination? Cuban hired by Lee Harvey Oswald bears striking
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:12.120]  resilience to Cruz. Wayne Madsen, April 15th, 2016. That is 19 days ago. So joining us is the
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:15.400]  investigative journalist. Just to spend a few minutes on this tomorrow, we'll talk about the
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:20.600]  campaign. You're going to be in Cleveland myself. We're going to see the DNC as well. Grab our full
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:25.240]  force. They're covering this, the big landslide that just happened, where all this is going,
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:30.520]  and so much more tomorrow. But today, your story going nationwide, international,
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:34.440]  and Fox News making jokes about it. What do you say, Wayne Madsen?
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:40.760]  Well, I really, I don't believe that comedians, especially failed comedians like
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:48.840]  Greg Gutfeld, belong on any news program. I mean, I don't know what journalism has come to
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:56.280]  when this guy gets more airtime than some journalists were covering important stories
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:04.840]  with the mainstream media. So I discount anything Gutfeld says. He's obviously a hack.
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:15.480]  That program with those other Juan Williams, and I think I saw Carl Cameron there. Carl Cameron
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:20.120]  deserves a lot of credit himself. I don't know why he, I noticed he didn't have much to say in that
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:28.600]  clip. But Carl Cameron was a guy who uncovered the story about the Israelis being arrested before
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:36.840]  9 11 and a four part series on Fox News. I wish they would stick to that kind of hard journalism
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:42.760]  and not the people like a, you know, some stand up comic that obviously can't get booked at any
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:48.040]  comedy club. So he's on Fox News. I was about to say he's like a jester in a little salacious
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:52.840]  crumb outfit hopping up and down, like, yeah, conspiracy theory. As you know, that he classified
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:57.960]  the sixties and again in the eighties, the CIA developed that term when anybody was on to something
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:03.080]  to just try to discredit it. Oh, gutter field or whatever his name is, you know, salacious crumb.
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:08.920]  He can say conspiracy theory. Boy, he's an intellectual. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know,
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:14.040]  that's true. They did develop it to hit people who were questioning the, the Warren report. But,
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:19.080]  you know, I never thought I would actually support something in the Warren report. The
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:27.400]  photograph of Mr. X, who many people now and believe is Raphael Cruz Sr. was an exhibit in
[02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:33.560]  the Warren report. Now there's a bunch of JFK researchers and I kind of liken some of them to
[02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:41.160]  Trekkies, people that will, you know, argue over some character in Star Trek and say, no, no,
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:49.240]  Spock didn't die in episode 4080. No, the Farringhi males can mate. Yeah, right. And they're just,
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:53.560]  you know, they're just like that. Some of these JFK researchers are just like Trekkies. You know,
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:59.240]  people are saying, well, the picture of Cruz, by the way, that picture purported to be Cruz's father
[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:03.960]  was never identified. No, no one with the Warren report could identify him,
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:09.320]  nor could Robert Blakey, who was the counsel for the House Select Committee on assassinations
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:15.400]  in 78, which by the way, he lived there. He was an anti Castro guy and his son comes out of nowhere
[02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:20.440]  to be the top Bush minion. Yeah. Even if you discount the photograph, you got to look at the
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:28.280]  fact that Raphael Cruz was associated with the oil services company, Schlumberger, and the owner of
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:34.920]  Schlumberger, the heir to Schlumberger was Jean de Menil, who married Schlumberger's daughter.
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:40.920]  Jean de Menil was on the board of directors of Permindex, the company, the CIA front that was
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:48.280]  operated by Clay Shaw, who Jim Garrison, the DA in New Orleans, indicted. And these are the guys
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:52.840]  that were servicing the oil rigs that were the fronts for the invasion's drug running, you name
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:57.560]  it. This guy's got the pedigree on every angle. Right. And provided the weapons for the pay of pigs
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:04.280]  invasion. And so, so we, even if you discount the photo, you got to look at the interlocking
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:11.880]  relationship between Raphael Cruz and Clay Shaw indicted by Jim Garrison. You know, they really
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:17.720]  went after Garrison, who was a DA. They tried to call it, they said he was crazy, had been seeing a
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:24.840]  psychiatrist. They tried to say he was a child molester. The typical things you hear when, you
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:32.280]  know, somebody stands up against covert America. And it's always been these covert operations
[02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:39.480]  run by the CIA. And I was told by a Republican insider, you know, Ted Cruz said he was going to
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:45.320]  take this thing all the way to Cleveland and the convention. And he abruptly drops out last night.
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:51.960]  I've been told that the reason there were two reasons behind that. When Trump said he was going
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:57.960]  to spill the beans on Heidi Cruz, it really wasn't Heidi Cruz. He sort of misspoke. It was on Ted Cruz's
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:04.600]  extramarital affairs. And the second reason was that the CIA is very unhappy. They thought they
[02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:10.760]  had the JFK thing put the bed 53 years later, and this was resurrecting interest in that.
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:15.560]  By the way, I've known you for like 20 years. You never exaggerate or make stuff up. You are
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:21.000]  very of great integrity. You're saying a good source inside what general area is telling you this?
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:25.480]  Inside the Republican party, inside the hierarchy of the party.
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:29.320]  Well, they suddenly got real scared. He said even if he lost Indiana, he was going to go on for
[02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:34.520]  a while. They started changing his tune on that. That's right. And you know, and so he was obviously
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:39.720]  tapped on the shoulder because Ted, what I was told is Ted Cruz knows his father worked for the
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:45.080]  CIA. And there was, there were more skeletons that were going to parade be paraded out of that
[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:51.560]  party had he not dropped out. So he, you know, he was basically told it's time for you to leave the
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:56.280]  campaign. Wow. You're coming on to Mar to talk about the campaign, the world. What are some of
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:19:00.040]  the stories we're going to cover when you're on for 45 minutes or an hour tomorrow, Wayne Manson?
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:09.080]  Well, this one with the Rafael Cruz story, there's so much more information coming out about that.
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:18.360]  And I think we're going to, you know, in a way, the way Donald Trump worded his comment on Fox and
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:24.920]  Friends is that can you believe that he said, can you believe that Cruz's father was with Oswald
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:31.160]  before Oswald was shot? He didn't say anything about Oswald being the assassin. And I just wonder
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:39.480]  if, if we have a Trump presidency, we'll, we'll see a, you know, maybe the government. Well,
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:44.120]  I told you, I've talked to high level insiders even before this happened. They were reaching out to me.
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:49.080]  I mean, Stone just showed up here going, Hey, you know, Trump's into you, you know, Trump's away.
[02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:52.520]  We got a, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And it looks like he may be like Fox says,
[02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:55.880]  the ultimate conspiracy theorist president. We'll talk to you, Wayne. You're awesome.

[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:55.480]  great books there on philosophy uh history uh research the media a very very thought-provoking
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:24:59.960]  fellow i wanted to get him on about the general state of the world also an article he wrote about
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:06.120]  where tpp and the globalist takeover uh is going right now and just cover a smattering of the water
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:12.520]  front uh and of course take your calls but john wow what do you make of trump i mean i don't know
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:18.520]  what your answer is going to be but clearly regardless of who he is we're seeing a collapse
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:24.520]  of the credibility of the system uh way beyond what you wrote about with my pierce morgan
[02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:29.960]  appearance this just seems to be cascading where does it go from here and what are the elite gonna
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:36.600]  do to try to maintain control or do you disagree there hasn't been a collapse no there's a collapse
[02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:43.560]  alright alex because of what he's saying you know it's really simple you can hate him you can say
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:48.760]  he's a fake he's a phony he's this or that and so forth but when the guy gets up and gives a foreign
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:56.760]  policy speech and says uh we need to end globalism for example we need to cancel these trade
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:26:03.720]  treaties these giant treaties that are sucking life and money and jobs out of america uh he's
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:13.480]  talking common sense that the media have refused to discuss for 20 30 years or more and now there it
[02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:20.120]  is so if you don't like the guy if you hate him look at the words forget who's saying them look
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:25.000]  at the other side of the coin i mean really the other side of the coin who's the other guy who's
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:29.720]  talking about these trade deals and globalism all throughout the campaign bernie sanders
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:38.280]  put together the voting block of sanders plus trump because a lot of that voting
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:45.480]  block has to do with defeating globalism and canceling these trade treaties look at the size
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:52.280]  of that voting block versus the witch who's writing down the center stripe on her blood soaked hands
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:58.920]  hillary clinton who is a globalist to the core and you realize the divide and conquer strategy here
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:05.000]  i mean it's unbelievable let's take uh the people in the united states all of whom know
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:12.760]  that this is a complete farce a crime a tragedy uh the destruction of the country as we move into
[02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:20.920]  the globalist framework for the world order of the future let's let's just forget all about that
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:25.800]  but let's divide and conquer these people let's put them on opposite sides where they're screaming
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:32.920]  at each other over the fence so that hillary just rides down the middle and wins well that's
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:37.560]  what's happening that's a great point do you think trump understands that at your gut level do you
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:44.600]  think the fix is in no i think he understands this very well the question is does bernie sanders
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:50.120]  understand it and i think in his heart of hearts alone at night he does he's looking at trump and
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:56.120]  scratching his head and saying i hate this guy he's everything that i don't want to be he's everything
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:28:02.120]  that shouldn't happen to america but you know i have to admit on the issue of the trade treaties
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:08.360]  and globalism i mean we both know pretty much the same data and we're on the same side yeah if
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:13.080]  sanders has credibility he's got to go with trump but he's not he says he'll pledge to hillary who's
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:20.360]  got more corrupt wall street money more dirty crony capitalist war money than anybody ever in history
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:26.280]  i mean she is disgusting but but how epic is it as you just said john rapaport of no more fake news
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:33.320]  dot com that trump's saying cancel globalism up with sovereignty up with basic things that is so
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:38.440]  anathema to the enemy there's no way they can be behind him because he's bringing back nationalism
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:43.400]  and framing the debate england's trying to get out of the eu the narrative changing world
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:49.560]  government's in trouble the plan isn't going according to plan they're in trouble big trouble
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:56.440]  you know obama has to go over there to england and say to the england to the you know britain uk
[02:28:57.240 --> 02:29:05.000]  to the leaders to the people if you don't stay in the european union meaning globalism because
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:12.040]  that's what it's all about if you get out you have to go to the back of the line to negotiate a
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:18.360]  separate trade treaty with the united states well you know that tells you who obama is
[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:22.680]  and the uk should call that blood for the minute just like we should when the communist
[02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:28.440]  chinese tell us what to do exactly you know say well what what are you talking about you're talking
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:34.360]  about defeating everything that needs to be defeating and you're saying no we should join
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:40.680]  up with the insanity so please leave get out you have such a way of crystallizing the battlefront
[02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:44.120]  and what we're really seeing john rapaport say that let's come back and go to calls cover other
[02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:53.000]  key news with john rapaport stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:30:03.880]  the gcn radio network jovix here with info wars dot com report authorities buying more riot control
[02:30:03.880 --> 02:30:09.400]  gear over fear of civil unrest sweeping america the report published by sandler research says that
[02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:14.280]  the demand for surveillance drones is driving growth with new systems that deploy water cannons
[02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:19.560]  that handle large crowds and demonstrations also proving popular riot control systems are expected
[02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:25.800]  to generate revenues of over 3.5 billion u.s. dollars by the end of 2020 with north america
[02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:30.600]  being one of the primary growth areas for upgraded weapons due to militarization of the de police

[02:32:21.160 --> 02:32:27.480]  can't even keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine we drill down more than 7 000 feet
[02:32:27.480 --> 02:32:32.840]  to gather these purple blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine on top of that we also

[02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:54.040]  unable to come up with anything even close to what we have it is exclusive to info wars life

[02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:45.720]  media pushed this why did my college teach me it was good why did george soros the
[02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:52.040]  nazi collaborator teach me to go out and shoot cops in the head because it'll make you the villain
[02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:57.320]  and then the heroes so total tyranny can be brought in not that the cops themselves are bad either but
[02:33:57.320 --> 02:34:07.800]  it's part of a dialectic it's part of a clash of civilizations part of a formula a program an

[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:34.840]  john rubbport what is it you think is most important to cover today well what we're covering here is
[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:41.400]  the march of globalism these impending trade treaties that empower mega corporations that
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:49.480]  are colluding with governments to steal and rob and uh put people into poverty all over the world
[02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:54.680]  to lower energy production that's one of their main goals that's a mass calling that's how you
[02:36:54.680 --> 02:37:00.760]  create poverty that's right so that to me is the big one and you've got an article that's excellent
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:05.000]  bricks and the bricks at countries secrets of the crypt we're gonna cover that up for a few calls
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:09.400]  but folks when they double our power prices the last eight years on average shutting down over
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:15.000]  a thousand plants that is devastating a poor person now loses maybe 20 percent more of their paycheck
[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:22.040]  this is how you do it places like africa it causes a revolution when food prices go up to 50 percent
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:27.960]  of your your your paycheck this is how they foment this by design uh thank you for holding
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:32.920]  let's go ahead now and let's go to mic in illinois you're on the air with john rapaport go ahead
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:40.680]  so this is mike and ellen i i i just want to say in a couple months i'll be 65 getting heading
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:46.440]  into the last part of my life but i want to just turn the clock back a little bit 46 years to 1970
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:52.680]  at that time i was a 19 year old college student and i used to listen to a radio host called
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:38:00.440]  german skolnik and he talked about a book called farewell america and at that time i had to mail
[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:05.000]  away for that book because that was not allowed to be published in the united states of america
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:10.040]  i probably had german skolnik on 50 times died four or five years ago great guy incredible
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:14.280]  anti-corruption researcher he would say stuff i couldn't believe i had him on 20 years ago
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:20.120]  he'd go most the media is paid they pay for the news stories you see big corporations and i knew
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:25.400]  they put their people in but then later it came out a really smart guy very smart guy and lo and
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:32.440]  behold but we're talking about today globalist 45 years ago another word for it was a commission
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:41.800]  and who was the commission cia fbi big oil at the time british secret service corporations
[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:46.440]  and mafia and what worries me about this is that who was the man in office at the time
[02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:52.040]  they played ball with them you got it jfk and what happened to him he double crossed them
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:57.240]  and what happened to him he got eliminated yeah he wanted to keep cutting taxes and he decided to
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:39:02.520]  end the vietnam war he said but cutting taxes gives me more money it makes people wealthy
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:07.160]  more money comes in they said look just shut up and die how's that uh amazing points anything else
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:14.280]  mike after that their man got in lbj the great society to me was the great flop and they ended
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:18.600]  the family they started ending the family great point john how profound is that they're so arrogant
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:23.800]  now they tell us the tpp's written it merges all these unions together it's it's above the law we
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:32.760]  get copies finally they pass it just totally draconian but still nothing is is is really being
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:38.760]  said about it maitre media but meanwhile they get arrogant and say hey we don't even have to
[02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:44.680]  have elections anymore those never counted we just appoint the people now but that backfired that
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:50.200]  didn't work it shows they can only go through so far and i think they tried to go too far and it's
[02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:54.600]  really backfiring now your comment on what he was saying and on that uh police must report
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:40:02.040]  absolutely as he says it's been going on for a very long time the first great trade treaty
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:10.360]  gap after the second world war they started negotiating that 1945 so this goes back a long way
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:19.400]  the plan and the plan is to empower these mega corporations to decide the law for whatever country
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:24.280]  they're in i mean people have to understand it these trade treaties as they're called tpp
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:33.000]  ttip this is all about saying look the judicial system of countries is extinct we don't need this
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:38.840]  anymore what we're going to have instead is corporate tribunals and this is all about a
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:43.720]  corporation saying look we've got all this stuff that we want to sell all over the world
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:50.440]  and we don't care whether you think it's toxic destructive you know pesticides and toxic medical
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:58.520]  drugs gmo's uh tainted food etc etc we're going to sell it and if any country refuses it then we're
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:04.120]  going to sue that that's right government in a corporate tribunal the judicial system of that
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:10.520]  country will have nothing to say about it and hey listen there's an interesting story today the nfl
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:18.520]  has told their players not to eat meat from mexico but citizens can they're shipping in
[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:23.160]  record numbers full of steroids and drugs that that's a powerful article that's in the la times
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:29.560]  and others talk about it yeah because the players could test positive for steroid use and be suspended
[02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:33.720]  so it's like saying well we don't know what's in the food but we know that some of the food coming
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:40.600]  from mexico has got this stuff in it and if you an nfl star eat this meat then you could test positive
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:45.960]  for steroids but it's okay for your kids it's okay for kids kids everybody else it's fine whatever
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:53.080]  and the reason i bring this up is because in these trade deals what's happening is people
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:58.920]  will not be able to know what country their food is coming just like they can't know gmo labeling
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:03.880]  here and let's expand that's one small part of it but t they're also diplomatically and corporately
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:10.680]  immune and they can also use the regulations to shut down domestic operators it's a monopoly
[02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:17.800]  takeover system absolutely they can say this is the food for planet earth deal with it you
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:24.600]  can't resist it because we have these tribunals that will overcome any system you now have so it
[02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:29.640]  turns to the people to revolt against this completely just the way they're now revolting
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:34.360]  against the political system and i was going to say it's a microcosm as above so below
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:38.120]  that they would try to go hey we have super delegates at the side now that's the way it is
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:42.840]  go and shut people said wait we vote you're you uh so see it's backfiring that's the good news
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:48.360]  as long as we resist look at the Brexit how exciting is that for you fantastic you know
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:55.560]  the people nobody in england who isn't a globalist wants to stay in the european union the whole
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:43:02.440]  idea is england would leave the european union and say gee guess what uh we're a country we forgot
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:07.160]  about that we're our own country we can protect ourselves we don't need the bureaucrats to make
[02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:13.560]  91 of our laws and open our borders and and and tell us we can't fly the the stars and and bars
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:19.320]  because it's racist or stars and stripes or i mean it's just crazy completely crazy so i'm just
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:24.360]  hoping that this movement gains a lot more steam because there are a lot of people in the u.s i
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:31.640]  can tell your listeners in in england who are rooting for you to get out of the european union
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:38.200]  completely because this will start a domino effect absolutely they're saying that it's already
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:41.800]  happening and here's the good news thomas ever since said the level of tyranny you will live
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:46.520]  under is the exact amount you put up with it's equilibrium folks it's it's if you put up with
[02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:51.320]  tyranny it'll just push and push and push till the execs are in your house saying you know let me
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:56.440]  have sex with your wife like like rollerball you know we own you you've got to stand up for yourself
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:02.440]  a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves john i want to go back to calls but i'm getting more into
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:07.240]  this article i don't want to be too positive about this but it's a paradox there's like all these
[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:11.960]  brain dead zombies on the left and right and all these foreign funded groups that are here and all
[02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:17.000]  this vulcanization getting dumber and dumber but there is a large group of people of every race
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:21.480]  color and creed getting more and more enlightened it it seems like a paradox what would you call
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:27.960]  this or do you agree or disagree i agree and and just as you indicated there with the twist
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:32.200]  you know some people are falling further asleep but a lot more people are waking up
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:37.960]  they're just sick and tired of all the lies from every direction you know and people are
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:43.400]  beginning to connect the dots on these lies and realize we just had a study that was uh
[02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:54.440]  published out of johns hopkins washington post uh today yesterday 250 000 deaths a year in the us
[02:44:54.440 --> 02:45:01.240]  caused by medical errors third leading cause of death in the us 10 of all people who die in the
[02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:10.200]  us are dying from medical errors and here's these prop job phony experts medical experts
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:16.520]  representing that system saying vaccines are completely safe and effective and anyone who
[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:22.120]  tells you any different is a lunatic that's the foundation these criminals are standing on
[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:26.440]  some people are waking up from that direction other people are waking up to the whole super
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:32.200]  delegate insanity and the theft of government other people are waking up to brexit other people
[02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:38.040]  are waking up to uh you know we want to take everybody's guns especially the people who
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:43.320]  don't shoot other people you know so from all directions people are waking up and they are
[02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:48.200]  resisting meanwhile though the tyranny is intensifying colorado especially a beautiful
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:52.920]  state great people but it's this fake liberal tyranny gets such cover a woman i was in the
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:58.200]  local news we had an article talked about kim trails and geoengineering which is partially
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:03.480]  declassified it's all over tv and movies it's super hot topic prince was talking about it
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:08.600]  everybody uh murl haggard uh chuck norris came out and exposed it and linked all of it world
[02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:15.720]  net daily she had her child taken and the judge said because she believes in a dangerous fringe
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:22.840]  subculture endangered her daughter close quote i mean even if she was wrong she should be allowed
[02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:26.520]  to believe something's going on if she's not hurting her daughter but believing it her daughter's
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:31.960]  been taken and now colorado wants to start basically forced inoculations yeah they want
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:36.760]  to register everybody who's not vaccinated in that state complete insanity and they're
[02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:41.240]  going to have a major revolt on their hands i can tell you that and this story about the mother
[02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:47.080]  and her child is spreading like wildfire because people are seeing the complete insanity of it
[02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:54.280]  but the government stay out it's not your business what i tell my child they admit there's a secret
[02:46:54.280 --> 02:47:00.920]  program spraying if it's on the discovery channel right but as you say regardless of whether it's
[02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:07.320]  true or not here's a mother saying xyz to her child and suddenly government agents show up
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:14.120]  because um parent says something to her child there are millions of people waking up on that
[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:19.400]  score in this country because as we've all been documenting you know people grow vegetables in
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:25.160]  their yard and suddenly they can't have a garden they fly a flag that's not okay a kid comes to
[02:47:25.160 --> 02:47:31.480]  school with a screensaver with a gun on it and all of a sudden he's a criminal this is the government
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:35.960]  just saying we're taking over that's it we have the bureaucrats we're going to do whatever we want
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:39.880]  people are not going to stand for it they also another paradigm i've noticed the military and
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:43.400]  the police they're really some bad cops out there and bullies obviously is from the general public
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:47.560]  but i'm not lionizing i was found the military and police are some of the most awake groups now
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:53.320]  and they're saying stop the people above us we don't like this yeah you bet now that's going to
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:47:59.400]  cause some major disruptions believe me because after all the government relies on force that's
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:04.520]  what it is that's what george washington basically said central government is core it's not elegant
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:12.840]  it's it's force is gackley so who who are these government leaders depending upon force cops soldiers
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:20.680]  if cops and soldiers are waking up and saying no no we're not going to do this this is not our job
[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:27.000]  this is the government pretending that they have this power that they don't have the whole thing
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:32.680]  is going to change and collapse so bottom line we're entering a time of total change of total
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:37.640]  upheaval for good and bad and i think we've just entered the edge of an accelerated time correct me
[02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:42.120]  think i'm wrong and then be how long do you think this time of change is going to be i see it now
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:46.040]  in human development basically never stopping i think we're hitting the beginning of the human
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:51.080]  species i mean i think of course we began before that but i mean i think we're about to enter an
[02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:58.280]  entire new paradigm absolutely we're just at the beginning and there's no end to it there it's not
[02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:03.480]  like okay well in 10 years the whole thing is going to be walked back and and we're all going to
[02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:10.280]  conform no it's never going to happen this is just going to spread and spread and that's why the
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:13.880]  elite and their own writings are freaking out they want to control the destiny of the species and
[02:49:13.880 --> 02:49:19.800]  steal it and there is a race consciousness to all humans it's really a group collective mind
[02:49:19.800 --> 02:49:24.200]  it's been proven scientifically and it wants to thrive and go to the stars and it's saying no
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:30.040]  and i think the elite should just get out of the way well that's the lesson they're going to make
[02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:35.720]  their decision but regardless of what they say they're going to be swept aside that's it
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:42.440]  i love it you're absolutely right god i love humanity let's go ahead genre reports our guest
[02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:49.720]  let's talk to a lee in california or lennon california go ahead hi alex i wanted to talk
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:54.840]  real quick about donald trump they mentioned today that he was going to do a vice presidential
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:50:02.760]  selection and i was just going to basically advise that donald trump not select any vice
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:13.160]  presidential candidate who is from the establishment or current politician uh back when jfk was a
[02:50:13.160 --> 02:50:20.360]  president uh they popped him and killed him because they had their establishment candidate
[02:50:21.240 --> 02:50:31.480]  lbj and the wings lbj escalated the war in vietnam as 58 000 men died through the bulk the
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:39.000]  Gulf of Tonkin lies uh i i'm really concerned that he needs to be very careful about his
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:45.320]  selection of a vice presidential candidate and don't defer that off to some politicians that
[02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:50.840]  ran against him or something uh bobby kennedy they turned right around and killed him immediately
[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:57.880]  after they killed gel bj because i mean jfk because they knew what he was up to because he'd been
[02:50:57.880 --> 02:51:04.680]  side by he told people they killed my brother and i'm gonna get him you bet you bet so what what we
[02:51:04.680 --> 02:51:10.920]  they'll tolerate trump though if they don't have a back door they've been working for 100 years to
[02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:16.600]  get here just like mal said three steps forward two steps back they'll take a couple of steps back
[02:51:16.600 --> 02:51:23.560]  for a few years to renew their efforts against america so we need to be aware of that and trump
[02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:28.840]  needs to be especially aware of who he selects as a vice presidential candidate i agree and stay
[02:51:28.840 --> 02:51:32.440]  there lino you've been holding on and i want you to be able to add some more points but
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:37.320]  how do you think they'll come at trump rapaport because i want your deep perspective on this
[02:51:37.320 --> 02:51:41.160]  they'll try to co-opt obviously we already met with haas and haas attacked him afterwards because
[02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:46.520]  trump rebuffed him uh continuing he he said we got nuclear weapons we don't have to be on the
[02:51:46.520 --> 02:51:51.640]  korean peninsula i mean south korea all nukem they got nukes too i mean trump really he's got a lot
[02:51:51.640 --> 02:51:55.480]  of good old generals that are advising him that just explain this is all a big boondoggle to rip
[02:51:55.480 --> 02:51:59.960]  us off and he's smart enough to say hey big military so the public then still feels secure
[02:51:59.960 --> 02:52:04.040]  and everything but the truth is we have mutually assured destruction he wants to actually control
[02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:09.240]  our borders and things but they're gonna try to co-opt him try to demonize him try to dig up made
[02:52:09.240 --> 02:52:14.120]  up scandals or whatever try to steal the election but i really think the momentum is behind him when
[02:52:14.120 --> 02:52:18.200]  he goes after hillary and she's a witch who's got people behind her that he used to power
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:22.280]  rapport i'm worried they really might try to kill him i think we should be talking about
[02:52:22.280 --> 02:52:29.400]  what happens if they do kill trump no question about it you know that's the quote final solution
[02:52:29.400 --> 02:52:34.840]  if they can't do it any other way i completely agree with the caller by the way on vice presidential
[02:52:34.840 --> 02:52:43.080]  selection don't pick a politician do not do that you can surround yourself with all the advisors
[02:52:43.080 --> 02:52:49.800]  you want who know about the senate and the house and this and that and all of the you know corruption
[02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:57.480]  basically the way things are but don't put somebody on the ticket who is just another politician
[02:52:58.520 --> 02:53:03.800]  do the same thing that you've been doing in other words you're taking a radical stance will pick
[02:53:03.800 --> 02:53:11.560]  somebody who is in line with that that's going to be just as much of an energizing force as you are
[02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:17.080]  or don't go to the senate don't go to the house don't go to the governors forget all that and by
[02:53:17.080 --> 02:53:21.080]  the way you're absolutely right on insiders that are into corruption always go he won't know how to
[02:53:21.080 --> 02:53:25.800]  run it you guys have been running into the ground he does know how it's run he used to buy and sell
[02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:29.880]  you legally he says it's a bad system i don't like it i want to fix it and he's not going to fix it
[02:53:29.880 --> 02:53:35.240]  overnight he wants to just dial it back make some better deals bring in good immigrants we need
[02:53:35.240 --> 02:53:40.280]  not bring in criminals and child molesters and do a few things like that but see you guys want to
[02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:44.280]  shut the republic down because we've already built your world government trump knows we've
[02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:50.600]  reached that final phase of betraying america he's swooping in like the duke the the the du-sex
[02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:59.080]  at the end to grab victory from the jaws of defeat in my view but all i know is he's not our only hope
[02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:04.200]  we're taking action populism is the answer awakening is the answer lin other points
[02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:11.160]  yes well i was going to say that i think that if we should all be concerned trump is one man
[02:54:11.720 --> 02:54:17.000]  he will have the legal position to do a lot of things but we had five and a half million people
[02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:23.480]  disenfranchised in colorado and little or no complaint by the people two and a half million
[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:28.760]  of those people participated in the legality of marijuana this doesn't speak very well for our
[02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:35.960]  republic at this point trump cannot do it all alone we will have to be there to help him
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:41.320]  we'll have to be involved and we will have to enable things you know i almost want to take
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:46.760]  some of these callers get their name and have like days where they come on as guests each hour
[02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:51.240]  like a few times a week like lin and the guy from australia there's so much better to listen
[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:56.840]  to than i am and so much better at crystallizing what they've said in fact lin sent us your email
[02:54:56.840 --> 02:55:03.560]  to rob do rob d at info wars dot com just rob in the letter d uh as a a guest idea kind of the
[02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:09.320]  knowledge of the people the knowledge of the crowd i want to start a segment every week at least for
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:13.960]  an hour to have four or five of these men and women on lin from california the other fellow from
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:19.880]  australia because i tell you the knowledge of the average people out there completely trumps the
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:27.960]  establishment john absolutely and to take this point further let's assume okay people think
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:34.840]  trump is crazy he's not real or ever but imagine that he might be let's say he is and let's say by
[02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:41.800]  some circumstance he's in the white house what does that mean i'll tell you what it means because
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:47.640]  of the way things work because of the corruption every time that he or somebody like him would try
[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:54.520]  to make a move to solve a problem for real there's going to be such tremendous force
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:56:02.120]  arrayed against him and insanity that he has only one option to go back to the people immediately
[02:56:02.120 --> 02:56:08.280]  this is what populism 21st century style is going to be like on networks on the web however he has
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:14.200]  to do it and say to the people my fellow americans here's what i tried to do today that's right that's

[03:00:28.360 --> 03:00:32.360]  want to pop champagne bottles for the victory of people waking up only done this six years ago once
[03:00:32.360 --> 03:00:36.440]  when the whole world government coban hanging treaty came out the secret emails how it's all
[03:00:36.440 --> 03:00:43.400]  a fraud now it's meant to depopulate us came out that devastated them this is bigger all of the world
[03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:47.480]  there's a populist awakening and people say what are we going to do if trump ends up to be a fraud
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:52.680]  but i don't think he is or gets outmaneuvered it's the resistance and the awakening that's
[03:00:52.680 --> 03:00:58.520]  unstoppable if we're aware of this anti-human movement and we start resisting it and voting
[03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:05.640]  with our dollars and our actions and as the culture grows of resistance it's over john yeah i mean
[03:01:05.640 --> 03:01:11.880]  okay let's suppose trump gets in the white house and he's a total fake total fake never meant anything
[03:01:11.880 --> 03:01:17.960]  he said at all destroy him you bet now that's a lesson to be learned as well what do you think is
[03:01:17.960 --> 03:01:23.640]  going to happen when politicians realize gee these people weren't just worshiping donald trump
[03:01:23.640 --> 03:01:29.320]  they wanted these ideas to come true and if he's not going to do it they're going to hold his feet
[03:01:29.320 --> 03:01:36.360]  to the fire and destroy him wow that means that they're actually awake it's like people in data
[03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:43.000]  when he says listen yeah you may have got my flesh and blood but ideas are bulletproof baby i win exactly
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:47.160]  exactly right exactly they think they're going to sit there and they think they're going to play
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:51.880]  games john and they think that it's all about trump no it's about nationalism common sense
[03:01:51.880 --> 03:01:58.040]  the human family and what works great point let's go ahead take another call here now let's talk to
[03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:02.680]  mike in texas you're on the air with john rapaport go ahead yeah first of all i'm
[03:02:02.680 --> 03:02:10.120]  i'm giving a standing ovation here at my office i to you to the callers today to every guest you
[03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:17.720]  have i am so energized it's it's unbelievable and it seems like everything is just razor sharp
[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:24.520]  and focused and just searing that's the first thing i'm a trump supporter but like you cautiously
[03:02:24.520 --> 03:02:29.560]  and i was applauding when i heard your opening statement kind of to donald trump today saying
[03:02:29.560 --> 03:02:36.840]  listen this is why we're behind you don't let us down etc and to everyone that's standing up and
[03:02:36.840 --> 03:02:45.160]  getting awake in and donald trump has basically provided the cover for people who like myself have
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:49.640]  been preaching the truth and have that said it's only a focal point like ron paul used to say about
[03:02:49.640 --> 03:02:56.280]  himself but but this is 50 times bigger i agree it's not the cult of personality because that's
[03:02:56.280 --> 03:03:03.240]  what we've been trained to follow and this is bigger than that and you're seeing it manifest and grow
[03:03:03.240 --> 03:03:08.840]  and grow and get more and more steam because people are more acute and on point with what
[03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:15.560]  they're saying he's awakened those who needed the cover who were beaten down i was beaten down i could
[03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:21.720]  i was exhausted i couldn't get through to anybody and almost basically gave up so now
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:28.360]  we have to say to donald trump look you've awakened the true freedom lovers the true people with
[03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:33.720]  integrity the true people that love their family love freedom want property rights want freedom
[03:03:33.720 --> 03:03:40.920]  for everyone not this fake victimization crap sorry that's that's going on yeah the west is
[03:03:40.920 --> 03:03:45.720]  liberal we're the people women power and everybody getting power and freedom and money and and and
[03:03:45.720 --> 03:03:51.560]  your own choice to do what you want don't tell us we're attacking people 100 percent agree
[03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:58.760]  so to donald trump and to everybody out there do not give up pop the champagne have a beer
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:04:05.000]  hug your kids we've just begun i am so unbelievably energized but we have to take these little
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:11.640]  celebrations to keep the momentum going and to donald trump like rapaport just said and you just
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:18.680]  said you know now that you've awakened the people that know the truth and we're amassing now and
[03:04:18.680 --> 03:04:24.040]  we're being diligent and diplomatic and proceeding and if you betray us you'll be like juda suscaria

[03:10:56.760 --> 03:11:02.920]  overriding the mainstream media and their fraud collapsing absolutely i tell you all the arrogant
[03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:06.360]  we should we played a clip we played a clip last night at the end of the nightly news see if y'all
[03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:11.720]  can cue that up it's called uh donald cucks wolf he's on the wolf blitzer show and wolf asked him
[03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:16.200]  about a month and a half ago why he keeps attacking megan kelly and he has this epic response it's
[03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:22.120]  epic like it's 22 seconds long it's epic if you guys can pull it up just run it it's huge i'll tell
[03:11:22.120 --> 03:11:27.160]  you uh folks what else do you make of this because these arrogant people get on tv democrats and
[03:11:27.160 --> 03:11:31.480]  republicans and go look we never count your votes your conspiracy theorist but now they're having
[03:11:31.480 --> 03:11:38.040]  to back off it just shows these con men can only go so far that's right and i think this election
[03:11:38.040 --> 03:11:42.600]  is gonna surprise a lot of people because i don't think hillary clinton stands a chance in uh in
[03:11:42.600 --> 03:11:47.720]  hell at this point she's gonna be done the scandals are coming out and it's just a matter of time go
[03:11:47.720 --> 03:11:53.320]  ahead get yeah i think what this election really reveals is the fact a lot of big government uh
[03:11:53.320 --> 03:11:58.280]  liberals are kind of breaking away from globalists what we had like uh last year you saw all the
[03:11:58.280 --> 03:12:03.240]  liberals kind of speaking out against the tpp which of course was a globalist program but now
[03:12:03.240 --> 03:12:07.800]  you see a lot of liberals that are kind of warming up to trump and now the biggest opposition to
[03:12:07.800 --> 03:12:12.680]  trump is just these cult-like social justice warriors and then you saw with the colorado
[03:12:12.680 --> 03:12:18.600]  if people are upset about the uh voter voterless election and then then you see you know with the
[03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:23.080]  whole bernie sanders crowd that are flocking to bernie instead of clinton and the fact that
[03:12:23.080 --> 03:12:28.840]  clinton's completely uh unpopular on college campuses now well it's really all just populism
[03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:33.160]  and he doesn't want that new york times thing released whether he was manipulating them or us
[03:12:33.160 --> 03:12:36.600]  or whatever he's like don't worry i'm just saying all this border stuff to get the right
[03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:41.080]  wing crazies to love me now i don't know if he actually said that or not but that would be hurtful
[03:12:41.080 --> 03:12:45.080]  if he did but he seems like a straight shooter out in the open the point is it's not crazy to
[03:12:45.080 --> 03:12:49.160]  have a border everybody else does border patrol union endorsed him so they obviously don't think
[03:12:49.160 --> 03:12:53.560]  it's just uh well all i know is if he was really a shill they'd be going for him they're scared of
[03:12:53.560 --> 03:12:57.240]  him somebody asked this question i think they're legitimately scared so hey are they legitimately
[03:12:57.240 --> 03:13:02.520]  scared of him hey and if that's true b why are they so scared of trump because he can't be bought
[03:13:02.520 --> 03:13:07.080]  he he's not in the back pocket of these people and that's what scares him the most and i don't even
[03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:11.560]  think it's him as a person they're just scared that they don't have control over him and they like
[03:13:11.560 --> 03:13:17.240]  having control i like donald trump because he is a ridiculous goofball and and and by the way i am
[03:13:17.240 --> 03:13:21.080]  too i'm not sitting there on a look he's a goofball he's really a character um and ring what do you
[03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:25.160]  think of this whole situation well another thing about trump you got to think about the issues i
[03:13:25.160 --> 03:13:29.240]  think they're afraid of the issues he's going to release the 28 pages he's going to audit the fed
[03:13:29.240 --> 03:13:33.160]  he wants to arrest hillary he wants to arrest hillary it's great to have a candidate saying i
[03:13:33.160 --> 03:13:37.160]  want to arrest my competition all right jesse i have that clip ready throw to that clip oh you got
[03:13:37.160 --> 03:13:42.920]  a here here he is on meghan kelly with the uh wolf blitzer epic epic why do you keep attacking
[03:13:42.920 --> 03:13:50.120]  meghan kelly of fox because every night on her show she does negative hits on me every single night
[03:13:50.120 --> 03:13:54.520]  and frankly if she didn't her ratings would drop down far lower than yours
[03:13:54.520 --> 03:14:08.680]  i mean one of the interesting one of the interesting things of the time is a fact that
[03:14:08.680 --> 03:14:12.520]  you see all these polls where they say everyone hates trump but why is it that almost everyone
[03:14:12.520 --> 03:14:17.640]  is showing up to his events and mass numbers there's more people that's why cruise really gave up
[03:14:17.640 --> 03:14:21.720]  but because no one was showing up to his things what about glenn beck what a weirdo but look at
[03:14:21.720 --> 03:14:26.680]  these polls though i was getting on rasmussen you got to pay a monthly subscription to even do
[03:14:26.680 --> 03:14:30.760]  the poll so who's actually going to these sites paying for that subscription to go take these
[03:14:30.760 --> 03:14:35.640]  polls i it's few far and beyond people they're actually i mean i mean bernie gets 50 000 hillary
[03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:41.560]  gets a 500 it's all bs man it's a carry's take on this jacari loves reporting on trump he asked
[03:14:41.560 --> 03:14:49.240]  him full time on trump yeah working here at uh i'm in sarcastic trough nightly news um well like
[03:14:49.240 --> 03:14:53.880]  you said earlier i think it is a victory for people to see that the mainstream media does not control
[03:14:53.880 --> 03:14:58.760]  the narrative as we saw going back further in the election cycle when you had guys like trump and
[03:14:58.760 --> 03:15:03.720]  rand paul step off the debate stage hold their own debates their own press conferences and all the
[03:15:03.720 --> 03:15:08.760]  good publicity they got from that so i think just going forward if nothing else this is a victory
[03:15:08.760 --> 03:15:13.000]  for people to see that alternative means can work and you don't have to be a slave to the mainstream
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:16.680]  media i agree to me it's like a thermometer that's stuck in a turkey that's what i mean that's what
[03:15:16.680 --> 03:15:21.000]  trump is he's just a gauge that they threw everything they got at him and it backfires
[03:15:21.560 --> 03:15:24.920]  jacari what does that say to you about the future of the media i mean if mainstream media has a six
[03:15:24.920 --> 03:15:29.560]  percent pressability rating when the associated press that's a real national poll that there's
[03:15:29.560 --> 03:15:34.040]  not much further to fall there i mean you know well they have the big bucks that they can keep
[03:15:34.040 --> 03:15:39.080]  pumping into the system to get people to believe it but you know as the uh millennial generation
[03:15:39.080 --> 03:15:42.840]  the younger people come up uh less and less they're going to these mainstream news sites they get
[03:15:42.840 --> 03:15:48.200]  their news from twitter and facebook and all these other sources the memes you know that brings a lot
[03:15:48.200 --> 03:15:53.240]  of information into it i'll say that who's grabbing the mike alive a lot of a few more mics we did
[03:15:53.240 --> 03:15:58.680]  a lot of the people at that protest in socal knew who info wars was even the protesters they
[03:15:58.680 --> 03:16:03.480]  the oh info wars is here awesome they knew who we were i don't know if they don't normally say
[03:16:03.480 --> 03:16:08.600]  they know who info wars was you're eating while you're on there right that's true i'm just joking
[03:16:08.600 --> 03:16:13.080]  but but that's how that's how big though that far reaching we are and then what do we have
[03:16:13.080 --> 03:16:17.000]  we have the mainstream media grabbing our clips playing them on their shows the next day which
[03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:21.080]  by the way all of our reporters and crew are awesome but our news director rob do and folks you
[03:16:21.080 --> 03:16:25.080]  have been out there your watch been so nice you've been gone almost every week for months you're the
[03:16:25.080 --> 03:16:30.360]  you're the folks that have been out there uh getting the amazing amazing footage of the social
[03:16:30.360 --> 03:16:34.440]  justice warriors i mean how would you describe it i don't care what color they are where they're from
[03:16:34.440 --> 03:16:38.120]  east coast west coast these people look like they've been put the microwave oven i mean they
[03:16:38.120 --> 03:16:43.000]  seem like idiots they they repeat the same talking points over and over again they've been conditioned
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:48.280]  to uh say i think what they're saying by whatever media outlet they're following whether it's you
[03:16:48.280 --> 03:16:53.640]  know huffington post or you know rachel maddow or salon dot com those places that hate trump they
[03:16:53.640 --> 03:16:58.440]  can't stand him so they're looking for any reason to attack him and so they just say well he's a
[03:16:58.440 --> 03:17:05.000]  racist and that talking point is just memed through these people right exactly yeah yeah same thing
[03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:08.920]  yeah i mean we've traveled you know east coast west coast it's the same the people that don't
[03:17:08.920 --> 03:17:12.600]  like trump but the people that do like trump like him for a variety of reasons well mainly
[03:17:12.600 --> 03:17:17.720]  and mainly those people are business people who own small businesses are working and pay taxes
[03:17:17.720 --> 03:17:21.640]  and they understand how the system works right but this is a referendum on the system for exactly
[03:17:21.640 --> 03:17:26.440]  yeah uh marley you want to make some points i think it is interesting that people are always
[03:17:26.440 --> 03:17:30.920]  looking for easily digestible tidbits especially when it comes to the media and it doesn't help
[03:17:30.920 --> 03:17:35.160]  that that's what we're given day in and day out so it just it makes people's minds just kind of
[03:17:35.160 --> 03:17:38.200]  shrink and shrink where they just don't know how to think for themselves anymore so it's nice to
[03:17:38.200 --> 03:17:42.600]  have someone who is confident and is not afraid to back down when they're question about things
[03:17:42.600 --> 03:17:47.080]  you know pushing that forward out in the media that's right 1415 months ago when he first announced
[03:17:47.080 --> 03:17:51.080]  all the so-called liberals which are just fake pseudo-intellectuals a lot of conservatives are
[03:17:51.080 --> 03:17:56.440]  like that too we're just laughing oh they're destroyed it's so goofy oh they're not laughing now
[03:17:56.440 --> 03:18:02.440]  now and and then hillary stealing this from bernie sanders i wonder how they feel about this now
[03:18:03.080 --> 03:18:08.520]  you know jones we talked about this last night how um bernie is going to have less delegates
[03:18:08.520 --> 03:18:13.000]  than hillary after winning the state of indiana because of the super delegates and so we talked
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:16.200]  about that last night that's how it's going to happen now it looks like she's only like seven
[03:18:16.200 --> 03:18:19.720]  down but with nine super delegates she could actually take the leading delegates even though
[03:18:19.720 --> 03:18:24.680]  she lost the state well that's how it works you lose it you win what you're i think the big
[03:18:24.680 --> 03:18:29.320]  difference with her this is for the past 6000 years the world's elites have been using various
[03:18:29.320 --> 03:18:35.240]  strategies to control the population and now we see trump that's kind of breaking up these strategies
[03:18:35.240 --> 03:18:38.920]  kind of letting the genie out of the bottle and letting us know what the power structure really
[03:18:38.920 --> 03:18:44.840]  does to control us and so now i mean trump's not a libertarian but he's at least paving the door
[03:18:44.840 --> 03:18:50.440]  paving the way i mean for more libertarian candidates to rise up so maybe a hundred years
[03:18:50.440 --> 03:18:54.840]  from now we'll have a very libertarian president in the white house if we even still have a white
[03:18:54.840 --> 03:18:59.880]  house a lot of libertarians are supporting them myself included and uh you know they say the
[03:18:59.880 --> 03:19:05.080]  illiterate in the 21st century aren't going to be people who cannot read or write they're going to be
[03:19:05.080 --> 03:19:10.360]  people who cannot unlearn all the lies they've been told all these years that's a great point that is
[03:19:10.360 --> 03:19:13.720]  yeah well i'll tell you it is an amazing time i'm going to skip this network break i've just been
[03:19:13.720 --> 03:19:18.600]  doing this uh this isn't so much fun to do i want to bring david night in here for a moment david
[03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:22.360]  night is in the situation room we're in the war room and we're going to keep going on the bottom
[03:19:22.360 --> 03:19:27.160]  of the hour because i kept calling it studio b last night we need to come with is it the 80s
[03:19:27.160 --> 03:19:31.960]  disco room or what are we going to call let's be serious this is the war room that's the situation
[03:19:31.960 --> 03:19:41.240]  room you know i think we should just say let's we should call this the td studio that should
[03:19:41.240 --> 03:19:46.200]  be the radio booth but but it's still tv right and then that should be the newsroom the newsroom
[03:19:46.200 --> 03:19:49.960]  or set it up in here is a newsroom we got all these crew in here and have a camera there
[03:19:49.960 --> 03:19:54.360]  was somebody stands up right at desk i mean we'll come up with that a lot of stuff going on the
[03:19:54.360 --> 03:19:59.880]  point is we have three working studios now and we could do we could literally go 24 hours a day
[03:19:59.880 --> 03:20:03.720]  with rotating people with just the people we have now i mean we don't want to do that every day but
[03:20:03.720 --> 03:20:08.360]  we could if something if something happens we could do that we could go live if we drink 20
[03:20:08.360 --> 03:20:12.920]  die cokes a day until we die yeah no but we got to get some more folks trading hobby absolutely

[03:21:02.360 --> 03:21:06.600]  this is the biggest thing they go you guys aren't concentrating on the protesters you're talking to
[03:21:06.600 --> 03:21:10.920]  us and that's what they really like that we were just asking you know this this trump mask all the
[03:21:10.920 --> 03:21:14.760]  ones i've seen are real stupid to make you look dumb but that was just kind of like evil chip
[03:21:14.760 --> 03:21:18.840]  monk or something he's got the mouth open definitely and we bought that from a zombie approach

[03:21:46.680 --> 03:21:51.640]  i'm doing wake up america coffee good at a four store that's right seriously though dad what do
[03:21:51.640 --> 03:21:56.440]  you make of our uh points in here well you know alex i was listening to you talk to john rapapour
[03:21:56.440 --> 03:22:02.200]  and we've got a four step process here and john was talking about how uh you know once we get that
[03:22:02.200 --> 03:22:06.440]  we've gotten the first step here we've gotten uh trump nominated we need to get him elected
[03:22:06.440 --> 03:22:10.120]  then we need to be his accountability partner as some of the callers were saying we need to
[03:22:10.120 --> 03:22:15.160]  support him and hold him accountable on this and as john rapapour was saying when you were talking
[03:22:15.160 --> 03:22:21.320]  to him we've seen that the g.o.p. has gone off the rails we've elected them to take care of very
[03:22:21.320 --> 03:22:27.400]  specific problems that say popular vote doesn't count with straight face smiling like you know
[03:22:27.400 --> 03:22:33.000]  eating cats that's right so so we have to uh we have to get them to understand that just as
[03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:36.760]  where we've rejected them and i hope trump understands this we're going to hold him
[03:22:36.760 --> 03:22:41.240]  accountable we'll support him and the things that we want him to do that he's campaigned on and that's
[03:22:41.240 --> 03:22:47.720]  these globalist issues here but and if he does that i think that's going to create a template
[03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:54.040]  that will turn into a movement well one exactly and we're already seeing they just had details leaked
[03:22:54.040 --> 03:23:00.200]  alex of the ttip the transatlantic partnership that just had details leaked the last couple of days
[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:05.400]  people in europe are furious about the betrayal because it is not simply about trade they're
[03:23:05.400 --> 03:23:10.280]  understanding that this is about their internet privacy it's about a host of things as well as

[03:23:40.440 --> 03:23:44.520]  there's some kind of free trade and they're not there's something completely different
[03:23:44.520 --> 03:23:48.360]  and it's something we need to address at the national level you know we look at all these
[03:23:48.360 --> 03:23:51.800]  different issues and we don't agree with donald trump on everything we don't agree with anybody
[03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:55.880]  on everything if you agree with everybody on everything you're not a cult you're part of a
[03:23:55.880 --> 03:24:00.040]  cult exactly and so there are certain problems you need to understand what they are gloat you
[03:24:00.040 --> 03:24:04.600]  need to think globally understand these people are planning globally and then you need to oppose them

[03:24:52.040 --> 03:24:56.760]  back tonight seven o'clock central info wars nightly news info wars news dot com prison planet
[03:24:56.760 --> 03:25:03.880]  dot tv donald trump is somebody who senses destiny he doesn't hate america he likes prosperity
[03:25:03.880 --> 03:25:09.000]  he isn't a globalist he's so arrogant and on such a power trip which is good at a certain level
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:13.880]  as a confident person is an alpha male they call that narcissism it's not it's called confidence
[03:25:13.880 --> 03:25:17.480]  he believes these globalists are a bunch of crooks that have stolen control and he's bare
[03:25:17.480 --> 03:25:21.320]  minimum shoving them out of the way to run the show and i think he doesn't want to run the ship
[03:25:21.320 --> 03:25:26.440]  on the rocks i think he likes america i don't really trust him i think he could be manipulated
[03:25:26.440 --> 03:25:31.080]  we're gonna keep on a very short leash he hadn't won the election yet but this is only a sign of
[03:25:31.080 --> 03:25:37.160]  victories to come and you keep your friends close and people you're not sure about even closer
[03:25:37.160 --> 03:25:42.760]  and so bottom line we're making history together i'm very excited and this is a victory for the
[03:25:42.760 --> 03:25:48.280]  people donald trump is only a symbol rob do donald trump you can comment as well sir i've never
[03:25:48.280 --> 03:25:54.200]  voted republican in an election i voted in the primaries from ron paul but this is probably the
[03:25:54.200 --> 03:26:00.120]  first election that i will vote republican usually i vote libertarian and um i you know
[03:26:00.120 --> 03:26:05.080]  donald trump has come to chew bubblegum and make america great again and he's all out of bubblegum
[03:26:05.080 --> 03:26:09.880]  that's all i gotta say i think he's great i think you know a lot of the stuff he's saying is
[03:26:09.880 --> 03:26:15.560]  you know no other candidates are saying it and if he lets people down they're gonna hold him to it
[03:26:15.560 --> 03:26:19.800]  i agree we gotta hold him we we have to hold him accountable if he doesn't do what he says he's
[03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:26.840]  gonna do exactly it is time you know once he's he's gonna be the if he's the president he becomes
[03:26:26.840 --> 03:26:31.400]  president we gotta hold his feet to the fire and that's that's our job and that's what we gotta
[03:26:31.400 --> 03:26:35.080]  they're all bought and paid for before the fact is who wouldn't want to make the country great and
[03:26:35.080 --> 03:26:39.480]  be the superstar yeah i mean because we got traders fighting us they're building a global
[03:26:39.480 --> 03:26:44.040]  government they're gonna go run that they hate us and taxes for the air we breathe essentially
[03:26:44.040 --> 03:26:49.160]  yes screw them and he is really an anti-establishment candidate that's why the entire establishment
[03:26:49.160 --> 03:26:53.880]  can't stand the guy and that of course includes the mainstream media there are a bunch of arrogant
[03:26:53.880 --> 03:26:58.920]  people like george will that gets in in the washington post and says we are sovereigns you
[03:26:58.920 --> 03:27:05.400]  don't get to vote i mean he said we are royalty i mean what an arrogant fruit bag he's a man's man
[03:27:05.400 --> 03:27:10.520]  he pisses off a lot of people that's what i like to do i like the fact that he he he makes
[03:27:10.520 --> 03:27:15.960]  these uh social justice warriors cry and cringe and go to their safe places and hide in their mom
[03:27:15.960 --> 03:27:20.520]  their mommy's basement and shove their faces in cheetos like glenn beck did who else has ever done
[03:27:20.520 --> 03:27:25.480]  that to glenn beck donald trump did he's got my vote that's awesome all these people are weak
[03:27:25.480 --> 03:27:31.800]  he's what we need to be strong again make america great again hell yeah oh my gosh yeah i used to i
[03:27:31.800 --> 03:27:36.520]  i would notice that i'd get uh as enthusiastic about donald trump in his speeches like i did
[03:27:36.520 --> 03:27:41.960]  about ron paul a couple years ago and i would wonder why because he's not quite a libertarian
[03:27:41.960 --> 03:27:46.920]  like ron paul obviously you know he's there's some things i disagree with him about but it's
[03:27:46.920 --> 03:27:51.640]  kind of like restoring america is like restoring a hot rod that you're not going to have a show car
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:55.960]  like immediately after one week and worth work you've got to do it in phases you maybe put the car
[03:27:55.960 --> 03:28:01.160]  in primer and then show you gotta decide you don't want to jump the car exactly and what people like
[03:28:01.160 --> 03:28:05.480]  that's are skeptical about a world government all they got to do is look at the holy roman empire
[03:28:05.480 --> 03:28:09.560]  like it was a hundreds of principalities that over several centuries that give up their
[03:28:09.560 --> 03:28:12.680]  sovereignty and became a unified state and that's what they're trying to do right with this right
[03:28:12.680 --> 03:28:18.440]  now so donald trump he's he's not the perfect but he's the least a nationalist and that's what
[03:28:18.440 --> 03:28:25.160]  we need not only in america but across the world well said get daniel's i don't like donald trump
[03:28:25.160 --> 03:28:29.080]  but i could say that for the majority of the people in this race at the end of the day i am
[03:28:29.080 --> 03:28:33.560]  glad to see somebody beat the establishment with all that they threw at him which is say i'm not
[03:28:33.560 --> 03:28:39.160]  going for bernie hillary anybody else uh but at the end of the day he did what he went out there
[03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:43.240]  to do and i was just to bring attention to some issues that really needed to be out there regardless
[03:28:43.240 --> 03:28:47.560]  of whether whatever you believe with him uh i'm not a fan of the walls and the other things that he
[03:28:47.560 --> 03:28:51.800]  says but uh he did get down some basic issues especially with the concerns foreign policy
[03:28:51.800 --> 03:28:57.240]  that need to be addressed macphie 2016 all right you'll get back on hey hey real quick run over

[03:29:01.320 --> 03:29:05.160]  everyone else says i'm just excited to see what he does excited to see if he makes any changes because
[03:29:05.160 --> 03:29:09.160]  words it's exciting that's why he's not a puppet and words are easy to say words are powerful but

[03:30:04.440 --> 03:30:09.480]  fear of civil unrest sweeping america the report published by sandler research says that the

[03:30:14.360 --> 03:30:19.720]  hit a large crowds and demonstrations also proving popular riot control systems are expected to
[03:30:19.720 --> 03:30:26.200]  generate revenues of over 3.5 billion u.s. dollars by the end of 2020 with north america being one of
[03:30:26.200 --> 03:30:31.080]  the primary growth areas for upgraded weapons due to militarization of the de police department and
[03:30:31.080 --> 03:30:36.680]  other law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the 2014 riots in furgus in missouri purchases
[03:30:36.680 --> 03:30:41.320]  of long-range acoustic devices whips batons and armored vehicles that will be used to disperse
[03:30:41.320 --> 03:30:46.600]  control and arrest people involved in riots and protests are also on the rise in cleveland

[03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:47.080]  step and taking back our national sovereignty you know when people talk about this i would say that
[03:33:47.080 --> 03:33:53.000]  trump has the opportunity to be the tip of the spear in reviving a new national sovereignty
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:58.760]  because that's what's being destroyed here he also has the capability to crush the tyranny
[03:33:58.760 --> 03:34:04.280]  of political correctness that has been attacking our free speech those are key issues those are
[03:34:04.280 --> 03:34:08.600]  reasons to vote for him and as i pointed out before you know we're never going to agree with
[03:34:08.600 --> 03:34:14.840]  anybody on every issue and it's going to be a continual thing but we can work with somebody
[03:34:14.840 --> 03:34:19.560]  if he wants to uh be a president of the people and go over the heads of the congress we can get
[03:34:19.560 --> 03:34:25.000]  this done and he can be remembered in a couple of decades as one of the great presidents people

[03:35:39.160 --> 03:35:45.000]  waited for quite a while thank you for waiting go ahead hi david thank you for taking my call
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:51.000]  sure um my my concern about trump is that he's he's done a lot of things in the past and said a
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:56.280]  lot of things that are concerning for example he supported an assault weapon ban before now
[03:35:56.280 --> 03:36:01.480]  recently he said he's pro second amendment but he did support an assault weapon ban he's also
[03:36:01.480 --> 03:36:07.880]  supported more recently allowing um men who identify as women to use the ladies room he's
[03:36:07.880 --> 03:36:12.600]  supported in the past allowing thousands of syrian refugees to come into the country saying it's the
[03:36:12.600 --> 03:36:18.760]  right thing to do but then well i would i would agree with those other two characterizations but
[03:36:18.760 --> 03:36:24.040]  i i don't think that when he was talking about uh it's the right thing to do i think he i i think
[03:36:24.040 --> 03:36:27.640]  that's a mischaracterization of where he is on the immigration issue and on the refugee issue but
[03:36:27.640 --> 03:36:34.040]  yeah go ahead continue now it is but but it wasn't at the time he said that but you know he's flip
[03:36:34.040 --> 03:36:40.280]  flopped on a lot of important issues and things like allowing transgender men in the ladies room
[03:36:40.280 --> 03:36:44.600]  you know if i asked you about that what would your answer be yes or no should that be okay well
[03:36:44.600 --> 03:36:48.680]  i've already done a report on that i think that that is a wrong issue but there are the there
[03:36:48.680 --> 03:36:52.280]  are the right places to attack this and there's the wrong places to attack and i think what
[03:36:52.280 --> 03:36:57.800]  north carolina has done is the right way to do it i think that they need to respect private property
[03:36:57.800 --> 03:37:03.960]  i think the answer from any presidential candidate ought to be why are you asking me i'm just running
[03:37:03.960 --> 03:37:09.800]  for president i'm not here to micromanage every aspect of your life we have a tenth amendment
[03:37:09.800 --> 03:37:14.600]  we need to respect that if people want a boycott north carolina that's fine if people want a boycott
[03:37:14.600 --> 03:37:20.040]  target that's fine we can work out these things we don't need to have these top-down solutions
[03:37:20.040 --> 03:37:25.400]  you need to understand as i said before we've got another tranny problem we got the transatlantic
[03:37:25.400 --> 03:37:30.520]  and the trans specific problems these are cross dressing treaties that are going to destroy our
[03:37:30.520 --> 03:37:35.400]  country that are going to manage our economy abroad they're going to set up a globalist
[03:37:35.400 --> 03:37:41.560]  multinational crony capitalism a globalism so we need to oppose these types of things and we need
[03:37:41.560 --> 03:37:46.840]  to understand the president cannot and should not do some things the president cannot and
[03:37:46.840 --> 03:37:52.120]  should not be involved in some aspects and so i don't look to a president to solve every problem
[03:37:52.120 --> 03:37:58.200]  and when you talk about things like his passport for the assault weapon ban we had people saying
[03:37:58.200 --> 03:38:02.280]  the same things about ronald reagan you remember when he ran remember everybody said hey this is
[03:38:02.280 --> 03:38:07.560]  a guy is a democrat he was the president of a union he's not authentic on conservative issues
[03:38:07.560 --> 03:38:12.840]  now ronald reagan is the template for conservatism and everybody said he used to be a democrat he
[03:38:12.840 --> 03:38:19.320]  used to be a union president he was against uh uh firearms he was pro-choice okay he was all of
[03:38:19.320 --> 03:38:24.360]  those things ronald reagan changed on all of those things so people can grow they can change
[03:38:24.360 --> 03:38:29.960]  and we also heard that ronald reagan could never beat the incumbent president he was 15 points behind
[03:38:30.520 --> 03:38:36.040]  and now we've got donald trump who is doing the same sort of things he's pulling in blue collar
[03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:40.760]  workers just like ronald reagan did so i think there's an opportunity here i think we need to
[03:38:40.760 --> 03:38:45.240]  give him a chance you know what you don't have another choice here in this fight quite frankly
[03:38:45.240 --> 03:38:51.960]  and donald trump has been authentic on the issues of trade and borders he's been talking about that
[03:38:51.960 --> 03:38:57.640]  for 30 35 years he's going back so when i realized he was authentic when i saw that he's being advised
[03:38:57.640 --> 03:39:02.680]  by pete sessions and if you're concerned about the weapon stuff think about the fact that our old
[03:39:02.680 --> 03:39:09.160]  friend pierce morgan has been pretty friendly to donald trump but he says i wouldn't vote for him
[03:39:09.160 --> 03:39:14.360]  because of his position on guns okay he likes him because he knew him personally because he was on
[03:39:14.360 --> 03:39:19.080]  his show he won the apprentice uh when he was in that contest with him so he's written some good
[03:39:19.080 --> 03:39:23.480]  things about donald trump but he still says i wouldn't vote for him because we have a fundamental
[03:39:23.480 --> 03:39:29.000]  disagreement on guns so i don't think i'm not concerned about the gun issue i'm not concerned
[03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:33.080]  about the supreme court issue and look there are things that we can and should and will do
[03:39:33.080 --> 03:39:39.160]  do at the state level i've got a stack of articles here about what one state tennessee has done on
[03:39:39.160 --> 03:39:43.080]  a number of issues they're going to nullify executive orders and supreme court decisions
[03:39:43.080 --> 03:39:48.680]  there's legislation uh to do that that hasn't been passed but they have passed legislation
[03:39:49.640 --> 03:39:55.880]  to block uh the enforcement of the un arms trade treaty they did that in tennessee using the tenth
[03:39:55.880 --> 03:40:00.120]  amendment and saying we have sovereignty here we have a tenth amendment and there are certain
[03:40:00.120 --> 03:40:04.440]  things that you're not going to take that are hands off and they've also sued the federal government
[03:40:04.440 --> 03:40:09.000]  over refugee resettlement they said you don't have the right to do that and they did that under
[03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:13.880]  the tenth amendment we need to start nullifying things at the state level we need to start nullifying
[03:40:13.880 --> 03:40:20.360]  things at the individual jury level and we can't get everything done as at the presidency what what
[03:40:20.360 --> 03:40:26.120]  do you think about that dave well first of all i think you have the right idea that we need to
[03:40:26.120 --> 03:40:30.760]  think about nullifying things at the state level that's a good idea but my point is that
[03:40:30.760 --> 03:40:35.640]  i'm pretty concerned that he could go off the rails when he gets in office and if he supports an
[03:40:35.640 --> 03:40:40.680]  assault weapon ban what are you going to do about that or if he supports legislation which is currently
[03:40:40.680 --> 03:40:46.120]  in the house of representatives to allow transgenders to use whatever restrooms they identify with
[03:40:46.120 --> 03:40:51.240]  or locker rooms he could do all of that and even though you and i both agree is not right
[03:40:51.240 --> 03:40:56.680]  he could do it and we should have plans to there are other and there are other things that he could
[03:40:56.680 --> 03:41:01.720]  do as well i think one of the reasons why liberals are so freaked out about a president trump is
[03:41:01.720 --> 03:41:08.600]  because they have advocated for the idea that the president should be an executive tyrant that he
[03:41:08.600 --> 03:41:13.320]  should be able to issue these edicts and whether or not the the congress is involved whether or
[03:41:13.320 --> 03:41:17.320]  not the states are on board that he's going to issue these edicts and he's going to get it done
[03:41:17.320 --> 03:41:22.120]  with his bureaucracy and i gotta say that if donald trump starts to do this stuff i think
[03:41:22.120 --> 03:41:27.480]  we all need to left and right it's going to be a lesson for everybody to say look we have a process
[03:41:27.480 --> 03:41:32.600]  here and you're going to have to get this through with the permission of the people the states and
[03:41:32.600 --> 03:41:37.160]  our elected representatives we're not going to allow you to operate as a tyrant there are checks
[03:41:37.160 --> 03:41:42.600]  and balances and if he goes off the rails it's going to be a good opportunity for us because
[03:41:42.600 --> 03:41:48.920]  we can then go back to these people who were advocating for obama to go off the rails as he
[03:41:48.920 --> 03:41:53.400]  has and we can say let's join together and there's going to be some honest people on both the left
[03:41:53.400 --> 03:41:59.560]  and right saying you know what we don't want to just have a dictator elected once every four years
[03:41:59.560 --> 03:42:03.720]  we want to go back to a divided government we want to go back to representative government
[03:42:03.720 --> 03:42:06.680]  and we don't want to have dictators i think that would be a very healthy thing
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:16.120]  your thoughts okay let's uh let's go on to uh dustin in florida dustin go ahead thanks
[03:42:16.120 --> 03:42:21.880]  david uh yes david um well let's talk about wrong issues like the last caller we're focused on
[03:42:21.880 --> 03:42:25.880]  something in a president it he's not even a president he's he's and he's not even in the
[03:42:25.880 --> 03:42:31.960]  general election yet yet uh president obama if you listen to his commencement speech it sounds
[03:42:31.960 --> 03:42:40.120]  like this twisted comedian that is you know uh gladly uh bowing down and getting out um
[03:42:40.920 --> 03:42:47.720]  but more importantly um i'd like to get your take on geoengineering and cern and the magnetic
[03:42:47.720 --> 03:42:52.680]  shield collapse and the radiation the chemtrails that we're experiencing right now that are creating
[03:42:52.680 --> 03:43:00.280]  this mass super hot summer and agitation with uh the american people and the diversion tactics
[03:43:00.280 --> 03:43:06.760]  that donald trump is uh a conspiring with right now because let's let's let's remember he's a reality
[03:43:06.760 --> 03:43:13.640]  tv um actor you know how is he conspiring to cover up the ideas of of chemtrails i don't
[03:43:13.640 --> 03:43:18.920]  understand and i and i don't uh mean it that way per se i mean that he's not conspiring but he's
[03:43:18.920 --> 03:43:24.520]  like the knight that showed up to slay the dragon and the dragon wasn't home you know like it's a
[03:43:24.520 --> 03:43:33.560]  it's a uh this is a uh media frenzy meanwhile you know brah kusan obama is sending 250 has
[03:43:33.560 --> 03:43:40.280]  sent 250 more troops to uh the middle east which is over four five thousand we have navy seals which
[03:43:40.280 --> 03:43:45.640]  i was communications and intelligence in iraq for the us army for infantry and i've been there done
[03:43:45.640 --> 03:43:50.280]  that and we have people dying over there for these things that are happening right now meanwhile
[03:43:50.280 --> 03:43:54.760]  trump is never going to make it into the presidency if he is he's going to be assassinated just like
[03:43:54.760 --> 03:43:59.720]  uh jfk and just like abraham lincoln they were populist they wanted to do the right things and
[03:43:59.720 --> 03:44:07.720]  jfk was a real patriot okay he wasn't this this talk show reality person jfk was a real patriot and
[03:44:07.720 --> 03:44:12.920]  that's what happens to real patriots and as far as uh you know if trump wasn't make it just to be
[03:44:12.920 --> 03:44:18.360]  light here it would be chuck norris for his vice president yeah well you know what i i'm not going
[03:44:18.360 --> 03:44:21.640]  to say that uh he can't win i'm not going to say they're going to kill him we don't know what's
[03:44:21.640 --> 03:44:24.520]  going to happen they're going to oppose him in a number of ways they're going to try to co-op him
[03:44:24.520 --> 03:44:29.640]  i think he's his own man i think he has been very frank and candid about different issues he's
[03:44:29.640 --> 03:44:34.680]  spoken out on vaccines i mean had ben karsten coming out and saying uh that he thought that
[03:44:34.680 --> 03:44:40.760]  everybody ought to get vaccines and uh he said hey i know employees who have had children who've
[03:44:40.760 --> 03:44:45.640]  gotten autism from vaccines and donald trump has spoken out very frankly about what he believes
[03:44:45.640 --> 03:44:50.760]  same thing that we do that there is a connection between autism and vaccines he's spoken out frankly
[03:44:50.760 --> 03:44:56.520]  on the 28 pages and he was ridiculed as being an alex jones caller and that was a national review
[03:44:56.520 --> 03:45:03.000]  about a month before it came out and was was legitimized by 60 minutes he's going to be frank
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:07.000]  about the things that he believes in he's not going to believe everything that i believe he's not
[03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:11.240]  going to believe everything that you believe but i think that he is a more honest person
[03:45:11.240 --> 03:45:16.440]  and i think he is approachable i think you can reason with him and i think that he is going to be
[03:45:17.640 --> 03:45:22.680]  open to ideas that the establishment is not going to be open to the establishment politicians
[03:45:22.680 --> 03:45:28.040]  and we're going to play a clip here in a moment from a guy who worked for mccain just to show you
[03:45:28.040 --> 03:45:33.320]  the contempt that the establishment has for us look we're looking at kim trails and you brought
[03:45:33.320 --> 03:45:37.160]  that up we had the story that came out yesterday about the judge ordering a mother's child to be
[03:45:37.160 --> 03:45:42.120]  snatched because she believes in kim trails and and just how outrageous that was regardless of
[03:45:42.120 --> 03:45:46.440]  what you think about that issue that is absolutely outrageous now today we've got a story that's up
[03:45:46.440 --> 03:45:52.680]  on the drudge report the set of the mirror in uk and it's a mystery aircraft they say a mystery
[03:45:52.680 --> 03:45:59.320]  aircraft stuns onlookers after bizarre vapor trail leaves people stumped over what it was
[03:45:59.320 --> 03:46:03.080]  i read this article and it's like oh and what kind of a plane was this there's nothing at all about
[03:46:03.080 --> 03:46:07.800]  the plane quite frankly what they're concerned about is the fact that it's going overhead and
[03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:13.080]  leaving these persistent vapor trails and just going back and forth and back and forth and circling
[03:46:13.080 --> 03:46:17.560]  the area and as they go through this they say bizarre streams of vapor trails are pictured
[03:46:17.560 --> 03:46:23.880]  scattered across the skies as baffled motorists drove along the a 55 they say some suggests the
[03:46:23.880 --> 03:46:28.680]  aircraft could be a commercial flight circling the sky they say but a search of two real time
[03:46:28.680 --> 03:46:34.360]  flight information websites found no sign of any aircraft flying over north wales and then they go
[03:46:34.360 --> 03:46:38.440]  on to say well maybe it's military and they say well there were three hawk aircraft airborne
[03:46:38.440 --> 03:46:43.400]  from raf valley this morning but their flight paths were further south mostly overland no one
[03:46:43.400 --> 03:46:47.880]  was seen flying north toward the isle of man so we look at this or look at this and say you know
[03:46:47.880 --> 03:46:53.240]  why is this why is this this is kind of interesting it's a interesting question and we've had uh the
[03:46:53.240 --> 03:46:56.520]  app that i talked about last night we talked about this case this lady with the kim trails
[03:46:56.520 --> 03:47:02.360]  people looking and crowdsourcing research about kim trails and when they see persistent
[03:47:02.360 --> 03:47:06.920]  contrails up there they're not going away done in a cross heavy cross hatching pattern that
[03:47:06.920 --> 03:47:12.680]  gradually spreads out into a vast haze they take pictures of it as they're laying down that pattern
[03:47:12.680 --> 03:47:17.480]  and they send that in and they started looking at all the people that were reporting these areas
[03:47:17.480 --> 03:47:21.560]  and they could correlate that with an increase in surface temperature so yeah there's a lot of
[03:47:21.560 --> 03:47:26.120]  things that they're doing they say that they're going to increase the albion the reflectance of
[03:47:26.120 --> 03:47:30.200]  the earth by putting these chemicals up there but we can also measure the fact that we've got
[03:47:30.760 --> 03:47:37.640]  precipitation of aluminum barium other elements that are coming out of these clouds that are there
[03:47:37.640 --> 03:47:42.920]  so people are beginning to wake up to what's going on and donald trump will come out and talk about
[03:47:42.920 --> 03:47:48.040]  that there's no other politician we've had in our lifetime that even venture to go there because they
[03:47:48.040 --> 03:47:53.000]  would they would be afraid that they would be ridiculed that they would be called a conspiracy
[03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:56.920]  theorist donald trump is going to come out with whatever he thinks is true if he thinks that
[03:47:56.920 --> 03:48:03.800]  hillary clinton is a criminal and she is he will say so he will expose the frauds and the crimes of
[03:48:03.800 --> 03:48:09.560]  hillary clinton he's not afraid to say that and he's not afraid to say a lot of these things that's
[03:48:09.560 --> 03:48:17.640]  one of the key things opposing this self censorship that these politicians who so desperately want to
[03:48:17.640 --> 03:48:24.280]  be approved of impose upon themselves he rejects that and so it's that candor that opposition of
[03:48:24.280 --> 03:48:29.320]  the accepted political correctness that he will stand against that i think it is so important
[03:48:29.320 --> 03:48:33.320]  i need to move on to these other callers thank you dustin for your call let's go to mike in
[03:48:33.320 --> 03:48:40.280]  colorado mike uh yes david thank you so much for taking my call um a couple quick things real um
[03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:44.920]  that i wanted to mention number one uh with your food special um i think it's ridiculous to miss out
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:51.560]  on it i get the math and it's like four dollars um per meal yeah it's amazing so 30 40 off i mean
[03:48:51.560 --> 03:48:56.920]  that's almost like i that's you know that's almost as much as as carly took off of the
[03:48:56.920 --> 03:49:02.920]  hula packard stock prices uh so it's an amazing discount it's an amazing discount and you really
[03:49:02.920 --> 03:49:07.560]  should stock up on it this is something that lasts forever so yeah i agree i'm i'm stocking up on it
[03:49:07.560 --> 03:49:12.280]  myself right i mean and the uh you know it's something that the wise thing you can get into
[03:49:12.280 --> 03:49:15.800]  because you can rotate it you can use for campaign it's not you're not losing and it's not like
[03:49:15.800 --> 03:49:19.960]  something that's going to sit there for a while that's right that's something that can be actually
[03:49:19.960 --> 03:49:25.560]  used uh right now that's right it's great stuff and i so i i mean i think that's like that's
[03:49:25.560 --> 03:49:29.800]  important to do that tonight you know i the interviews with matt bracken recently that alex has
[03:49:29.800 --> 03:49:35.560]  had it and uh has been first shaking and i you know my my gut is actually telling me with uh
[03:49:35.560 --> 03:49:39.560]  with donald trump's reason why maybe cruz has gotten out there and it looks like he threw it at the
[03:49:39.560 --> 03:49:43.480]  end i don't you know cruz is actually a pretty good operator but i don't you know it looks like he
[03:49:43.480 --> 03:49:47.320]  threw the uh the indian election at there with that especially you know that the plants that
[03:49:47.320 --> 03:49:51.480]  went over there he went to talk with the trump supporters but either way um it just seems like
[03:49:51.480 --> 03:49:56.920]  they maybe have something in in mind for trump um but but on that line is what i'm thinking with
[03:49:56.920 --> 03:50:02.920]  trump if he really wants to um you know to make america great again protect themselves and connect
[03:50:02.920 --> 03:50:07.160]  protect communities he has to also talk locally he doesn't have to like you know concentrated on it
[03:50:07.160 --> 03:50:11.400]  you know a lot you know 24-7 but you shouldn't mention things about hey we need to get back to
[03:50:11.400 --> 03:50:15.640]  our roots the way we are i mean i live in an area where i mean i've been in the same house now for
[03:50:15.640 --> 03:50:19.800]  about um about three and a half years i got out of the military so i don't have you know a lot of
[03:50:19.800 --> 03:50:25.080]  people around me um that i know you know people you know move they pcf they go to other stations
[03:50:25.080 --> 03:50:29.320]  or whatever so i don't know that many people around me i know a couple of my neighbors but uh
[03:50:29.320 --> 03:50:34.920]  got about 30 seconds got less than 30 seconds hey he said he needs to be mentioned you look you
[03:50:34.920 --> 03:50:39.080]  got it you got to get together with your neighbors you got to uh you shouldn't be a government
[03:50:39.080 --> 03:50:43.800]  program but he says he should encourage people to you know intermingle amongst themselves

[03:52:19.240 --> 03:52:24.920]  information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine
[03:52:24.920 --> 03:52:31.000]  we drill down more than 7 000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to extract the ultra pure
[03:52:31.000 --> 03:52:36.600]  iodine on top of that we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling it is the purest
[03:52:36.600 --> 03:52:41.640]  cleanest strongest out there quite frankly i'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield

[03:54:51.160 --> 03:54:55.880]  would end his campaign oh i'm sorry that's the old news that's two days ago uh we've got another
[03:54:55.880 --> 03:55:01.480]  winner i hope this one comes true though uh breaking craze k6 says he's going to exit the race you
[03:55:01.480 --> 03:55:08.840]  know he's in danger of becoming a verb you know like captain boycott who became a verb it could be
[03:55:08.840 --> 03:55:14.680]  i guess somebody who uh says on your couch and eats food and refuses to leave uh we hear that he's
[03:55:14.680 --> 03:55:19.240]  going to leave today and as people are saying who's going to be the vp i hear that carly fiorina is
[03:55:19.240 --> 03:55:23.640]  available uh for trump but i don't think you'd be wise to take her let's look at what happened
[03:55:23.640 --> 03:55:31.080]  we're on the democrat side here we've got bernie sanders winning indiana or did he okay he beat
[03:55:31.080 --> 03:55:38.200]  hillary clinton in the vote 53 to 47 but right now they still got three delegates to allocate he's
[03:55:38.200 --> 03:55:44.600]  only six delegates ahead of her there are nine super delegates they reserved 10 of the delegates
[03:55:44.600 --> 03:55:50.040]  coming out of indiana the democrat party did they reserved 10 of the delegates as super delegates
[03:55:50.040 --> 03:55:55.320]  and guess what he didn't beat her by more than 10 and these super delegates when they started
[03:55:55.320 --> 03:55:59.320]  talking to them back in november back in february the bernie sanders people were very upset they
[03:55:59.320 --> 03:56:05.000]  said look you know we've got nine delegates uh we contacted all of them ap did they said well five
[03:56:05.000 --> 03:56:10.360]  of them got back to us four said they're definitely for i'm sorry six got back to us five were definitely
[03:56:10.360 --> 03:56:15.160]  for hillary clinton uh one said they're sitting on the fence and the other three wouldn't even
[03:56:15.160 --> 03:56:19.720]  talk to us about it so look folks this is the way they've set it up they've got a proportional
[03:56:20.280 --> 03:56:25.320]  election on all of these uh democrat races from the top to the bottom there's no winner take
[03:56:25.320 --> 03:56:28.840]  all pretty much on the democrat side i think they're almost all of them are proportional
[03:56:29.560 --> 03:56:34.840]  that means that in all these cases he's going to have to beat her by more than 10 or the
[03:56:34.840 --> 03:56:40.200]  establishment wins you see how clever that is that's how they rig these elections and the people
[03:56:40.200 --> 03:56:44.840]  on the democrat side need to understand what's going on with this now on the republican side
[03:56:44.840 --> 03:56:49.800]  they're screaming bloody murder they didn't do their math right or something went wrong what happened
[03:56:49.800 --> 03:56:55.320]  what happened well we've got a guy who's a former mccain aide steve schmitt and he said this
[03:56:57.720 --> 03:57:01.640]  commentators say they scratched their chins and say my god the tone of this election
[03:57:01.640 --> 03:57:07.160]  have they not listened to talk radio for five minutes in this country that reaches 50 million
[03:57:07.160 --> 03:57:14.600]  people a day for a moment in the last 10 years and the tone is disgusting around our political
[03:57:14.600 --> 03:57:21.000]  discourse and trump has been a reflection of that tone in this field cage match republican primary
[03:57:21.000 --> 03:57:26.680]  you look at the intellectual collapse of the conservative movement the fading of giants like
[03:57:26.680 --> 03:57:31.560]  william f buckley okay hold it right there hold it right there okay we've got a couple of things there
[03:57:31.560 --> 03:57:36.120]  this steel cage match and trump has been a part of it you know what they can't stand the republicans
[03:57:36.120 --> 03:57:42.120]  can't stand it's the bare knuckled truth and he wants to talk about giants like william f buckley
[03:57:42.120 --> 03:57:48.680]  no you know william f buckley pushed the idea of globalism of these neocon wars and it was
[03:57:48.680 --> 03:57:54.680]  national review that went all out to stop trump nobody did it more than national review they have
[03:57:54.680 --> 03:58:01.640]  lost all of their credibility folks they've lost all of their influence and they're not free traders
[03:58:01.640 --> 03:58:09.160]  they're free traders with a t r a i t o r s they've betrayed this country with their open borders
[03:58:09.160 --> 03:58:14.680]  with their globalist trade treaties and they are unrepentant they have absolutely nothing
[03:58:14.680 --> 03:58:19.800]  but contempt for the working man they talk about how we are nothing but cannon fodder for their wars
[03:58:19.800 --> 03:58:23.880]  i've got a clip i didn't even get to that this guy robert cohen we talked about it last night
[03:58:23.880 --> 03:58:28.120]  the nightly news these people are cannon fodder they say well we'll find out who's the cannon
