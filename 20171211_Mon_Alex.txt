[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  It's the most wonderful time of the year.
[00:11.600 --> 00:16.600]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic fear.
[00:16.600 --> 00:20.600]  And everyone telling you be a good cheer.
[00:20.600 --> 00:27.600]  It's the most wonderful time of the year.
[00:27.600 --> 00:34.600]  It's the half-happiest season of all.
[00:34.600 --> 00:41.600]  With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings when friends come to call.
[00:41.600 --> 00:45.600]  It's the half-happiest season of all.
[00:45.600 --> 00:50.600]  Trump has caused international outrage by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
[00:50.600 --> 00:51.600]  Who would do such a thing?
[00:51.600 --> 00:57.600]  Jerusalem is still the capital of Israel and must remain an undivided city accessible to all.
[00:57.600 --> 01:05.600]  As soon as I take office, I will begin the process of moving the United States ambassador to the city of Israel as chosen as its captain.
[01:05.600 --> 01:12.600]  I continue to say that Jerusalem will be the capital of Israel. And I have said that before and I will say it again.
[01:12.600 --> 01:15.600]  And Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel.
[01:15.600 --> 01:23.600]  Oh, but why is Trump doing this now? Why is he inflaming the Middle East and provoking an explosion of violence?
[01:23.600 --> 01:26.600]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why would Muslims resort to violence?
[01:26.600 --> 01:32.600]  As we all know by now, Islam is a religion of peace. I mean, it's impossible. I don't understand.
[01:32.600 --> 01:38.600]  You're saying Muslims have so little control over their actions, they're just gonna flip out like animals.
[01:38.600 --> 01:40.600]  Sounds pretty Islamophobic to me.
[01:40.600 --> 01:45.600]  I mean, it's not as if they're setting fire to their own neighborhoods and violently attacking Jewish restaurants.
[01:53.600 --> 01:55.600]  And firing rockets into Israel.
[01:55.600 --> 02:00.600]  It's not like the leader of Hamas called for peace to be abandoned and for Palestinians to launch an uprising.
[02:00.600 --> 02:04.600]  It's not like the head of Hamas and Gaza literally called for terrorism.
[02:04.600 --> 02:08.600]  Islam's a religion of peace. That's impossible. It's not happening.
[02:08.600 --> 02:15.600]  These are reasonable people. It's not like they were massacring Jews in Jerusalem 20 years before Israel even existed.
[02:15.600 --> 02:21.600]  It's not like they've repeatedly called for Israel to be wiped from the pages of history. That's never happened.
[02:21.600 --> 02:27.600]  It's not like the Palestinian Authority still refuses to acknowledge Israel's right to even exist.
[02:27.600 --> 02:33.600]  It's not like Muslims have launched violence against Jews for the sin of visiting Jewish holy sites for decades.
[02:33.600 --> 02:38.600]  It's not like Muslims used gravestones from Jewish cemeteries to pave their roads.
[02:38.600 --> 02:41.600]  None of that happened. These are reasonable people.
[02:41.600 --> 02:47.600]  There's no history whatsoever of them turning violent and if they ever did, it could only be Donald Trump's fault.
[02:47.600 --> 02:51.600]  Not because they're anti-Semites who just hate Jewish people. They're reasonable.
[02:51.600 --> 02:58.600]  Also, Trump recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is so reckless, it's unprecedented.
[02:58.600 --> 03:05.600]  It's not like Congress passed a law 22 years ago called the Jerusalem Embassy Act which described Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
[03:05.600 --> 03:13.600]  Oh, it did. It's not like the U.S. Senate voted 90 to 0 that Jerusalem should remain the undivided capital of Israel just six months ago.
[03:13.600 --> 03:19.600]  Oh, it did. It's not like Bill Clinton came into office supporting the declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
[03:19.600 --> 03:24.600]  Oh, he did. Yeah, but it's not like George W. Bush promised to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.
[03:24.600 --> 03:31.600]  Oh, he did. But Trump's bad anyway because he's following through on his promise. That's bad.
[03:31.600 --> 03:36.600]  I mean, CNN literally says he's bad for keeping his promises, so I guess it must be true.
[03:36.600 --> 03:41.600]  Also, doesn't this just prove everyone right who said that Trump was a Nazi and literally Hitler?
[03:41.600 --> 03:49.600]  It is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
[03:49.600 --> 03:54.600]  Trump's bending over backwards to please Zionists and Jews just like Hitler did.
[03:54.600 --> 04:01.600]  What? Yeah, anyway, here's a list of groups and people furious at Trump's decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem.
[04:01.600 --> 04:07.600]  Turkey's Islamist President Erdogan, Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz, ISIS, Hamas,
[04:07.600 --> 04:12.600]  globalist political leaders, virtually the entire political left, the mainstream media.
[04:12.600 --> 04:14.600]  Totally erratic decision by this president.
[04:14.600 --> 04:20.600]  Even Muslims in general, hashtag not all Muslims, what an upstanding alliance. I'm so proud to be a part of it.
[04:20.600 --> 04:24.600]  Erdogan was right when he accused Trump of throwing the region into a ring of fire.
[04:24.600 --> 04:32.600]  And he'd know all about that, having covertly provided direct military, financial and logistical support to ISIS for years.
[04:32.600 --> 04:36.600]  But what Trump's done is beyond insane. He's playing with fire.
[04:36.600 --> 04:41.600]  Hamas has threatened to open the gates of hell because they've never done that before.
[04:41.600 --> 04:48.600]  But aside from all that, how stupid, how stupid is it that Jerusalem could be considered the capital of Israel?
[04:48.600 --> 04:51.600]  It's not like Israel won a war or something to secure.
[04:51.600 --> 04:53.600]  All right, folks, the broadcast starts.
[04:53.600 --> 04:56.600]  Here in just a few minutes. Stay with us.
[04:58.600 --> 05:04.600]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States with the latest cutting edge science,
[05:04.600 --> 05:09.600]  we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[05:09.600 --> 05:17.600]  One of them is a powerful, pro-digestive enzyme, carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[05:17.600 --> 05:27.600]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in fluorolive advanced restoration.
[05:27.600 --> 05:32.600]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable fluorolive everyday maintenance.
[05:32.600 --> 05:42.600]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[05:42.600 --> 05:48.600]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[05:48.600 --> 06:10.600]  When you purchase it at m4store.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[06:10.600 --> 06:19.600]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[06:19.600 --> 06:25.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live broadcasting worldwide. Another week spans out before us.
[06:25.600 --> 06:31.600]  It is the 11th day of December, 2017. We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[06:31.600 --> 06:41.600]  Well, another day, another Christmas holiday season and more Islamic terror attacks.
[06:41.600 --> 06:52.600]  And right on time, Google is a story up on m4store.com with the screenshots is censoring and sending threatening notices to major libertarian and conservative news outlets saying,
[06:52.600 --> 07:01.600]  Don't say this is Islamic or will shut you down. That's right. And Facebook called us up just last week and said,
[07:01.600 --> 07:08.600]  You don't criticize transsexualism being taught to elementary school students or will shut you down.
[07:08.600 --> 07:15.600]  They actually call us now. That's the new face. They send you notices. They call you Google, Twitter, Facebook.
[07:15.600 --> 07:21.600]  They always work together in concert to censor. We get to always enjoy the new level of it.
[07:21.600 --> 07:25.600]  Remember three weeks ago, they had congressional hearings and they said,
[07:25.600 --> 07:31.600]  Don't worry. We censored info wars at lunch. Google, Facebook, Twitter executives.
[07:31.600 --> 07:37.600]  They had Congressman Wiggly out of Illinois, not making that name up.
[07:37.600 --> 07:44.600]  Piggly Wiggly. And he said, Listen, I saw their story about the truck attack was number one.
[07:44.600 --> 07:49.600]  And it was terrible, fake news. They said, We know, sir, we took it down over lunch.
[07:49.600 --> 07:53.600]  There's the headline. We'll see the video. Twitter, Google admits deliberately censoring info wars.
[07:53.600 --> 07:59.600]  And again, this is bigger than info wars. They're now sending notices to the Daily Caller,
[07:59.600 --> 08:05.600]  CNS News, a bunch of other people saying you better watch what you say.
[08:05.600 --> 08:12.600]  Here's our terms of services. You don't say this is an Islamic attack in Sweden, in Germany.
[08:12.600 --> 08:17.600]  You name it, they will send actual police to your house, but he gets better.
[08:17.600 --> 08:23.600]  Guess who Facebook hired two years ago to oversee all this and to implement it?
[08:23.600 --> 08:28.600]  Guess who? The former high level Stasi operatives.
[08:28.600 --> 08:36.600]  So Imam Warren de Blasio about New York City terror. He was too busy bashing Trump.
[08:36.600 --> 08:43.600]  He did nothing. And the ISIS folks have been saying they're going to strike New York with trucks and with bombs and the rest of it.
[08:43.600 --> 08:47.600]  The Blasio says, Oh, we want more unvetted people in here. Trump is bad.
[08:47.600 --> 08:52.600]  Come here. We'll be a sanctuary city for unvetted military aged men from the Middle East.
[08:52.600 --> 08:58.600]  You've got an Imam that's all over Fox News, all over the place coming out and saying,
[08:58.600 --> 09:04.600]  I've been in these mosques. They're preparing attacks a month before this happened a couple months ago.
[09:04.600 --> 09:12.600]  And they say that's fake news. You know why it's fake because it's number one and it's the truth and they don't like it.
[09:12.600 --> 09:18.600]  So every time we're number one, they just knock us down where nobody can read it. Nobody can see it.
[09:18.600 --> 09:26.600]  But that's on their platforms. They can't stop you from spreading the articles on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[09:26.600 --> 09:35.600]  and giving it to friends and family and showing it to coworkers and showing it to your church or showing it to your pastors.
[09:35.600 --> 09:43.600]  And you can see the warnings in 2016 from the particular Imam that we just put on screen who's very well known.
[09:43.600 --> 09:52.600]  Again, they said that was fake. I don't want to make it about us. It's about there's an Islamic attack by a guy with a suicide vest.
[09:52.600 --> 09:59.600]  It looks like only the detonator went off hurt him and three other people. Thank God didn't hurt more people.
[09:59.600 --> 10:08.600]  And of course, he's pledging allegiance to ISIS. Of course, it's the same story. Akkadula.
[10:08.600 --> 10:18.600]  So it just goes on and on. Flashback. ISIS threatened New York City Christmas bombing just weeks ago.
[10:18.600 --> 10:35.600]  Jihadist warned of attacks across West during Christian holidays. That's on news wars.com. We have where they warned. But again, if we say they're warning of attacks and if we break down news and places where people warned that the attacks were coming because it's so on target,
[10:35.600 --> 10:44.600]  it shows that people warned, it shows that people predicted, it shows that people were accurate. That's the kind of news they call fake because it's so real.
[10:44.600 --> 10:50.600]  It's so bonafide. It's so confirmed. It's so accurate.
[10:50.600 --> 11:00.600]  That's what they ban. Like Trump's going to win. They're giving Hillary 15 more points in the polls. Boom. He won. It's a credibility issue.
[11:00.600 --> 11:15.600]  They want to shut us down because we are credible, because we point out their lies. Just look at the last few weeks. We were the first in every case to go. That WikiLeaks info was out months before.
[11:15.600 --> 11:29.600]  And that is fake. And everybody was given the key. Boom. Hours later, they admit it's fake. We were the first to sit there and break down the fact that Flynn was only contacting the Russians after the president was president-elect.
[11:29.600 --> 11:39.600]  Boom. That was all confirmed. Same week. We were there saying, Deutsche Bank has said that we've not received any information. That was day one. I said, sounds fake again.
[11:39.600 --> 11:49.600]  Because you learn how they operate just like three months ago. And I'm not bragging. I'm explaining why they hate us because we've got the research we're focused.
[11:49.600 --> 12:00.600]  Remember, I said they're burning Weinstein and they're burning all these other Hollywood folks because A, in one case, the Weinstein company and his brother want to get rid of him.
[12:00.600 --> 12:18.600]  All these other shoes are about to drop. The cover-ups aren't working. They want to create this sacrificial lamb atmosphere where they are able to create the illusion that the Democrats have done the right thing,
[12:18.600 --> 12:31.600]  getting rid of their bad people, and that the Republicans haven't, and create the perception that Trump should step down, too, if everybody else steps down for mere allegations.
[12:31.600 --> 12:39.600]  You see, it's the Democratic Party throwing some of their people under the bus that really didn't do anything. Many of them did.
[12:39.600 --> 12:49.600]  That then tries to create that perception so that everyone basically then goes along with it. And now, what is CNN saying? What is Fox saying? What is MSNBC saying?
[12:49.600 --> 12:58.600]  What are the Democrat strategists on CNN admitting? They're going, actually, we're doing this, doing credibility with the voters back, and it's the right thing to do.
[12:58.600 --> 13:05.600]  And so we can create the perception that Trump needs to step down. That's all this is. And what do we say day one?
[13:05.600 --> 13:17.600]  Whatever the Democrats are doing in bed with Russia, selling us out to globalists, illegal servers, robbing tax-free foundation funds, that's what they say Trump's done.
[13:17.600 --> 13:33.600]  They knew Jerry Epstein and the Lolita Express and Bill Clinton and Hillary on board the aircraft used to transport kidnapped children, flying to known Sheik's palaces in the Middle East that publicly have sex with children, some of those kingdoms that it's legal.
[13:33.600 --> 13:46.600]  And they knew that was their super weak spot. So now it's breaking that the head of Fusion GPS was behind the attempt to tie Trump to Clinton's pedophile friend Epstein when there were no connections.
[13:46.600 --> 13:54.600]  Trump's a celebrity, a few big public parties or events. The two have been photographed together, but never on the airplane, never at his house, never doing all this stuff.
[13:54.600 --> 14:04.600]  But they knew that was the main weakness for the Clintons, so they then, just like they said, oh, Trump's a Russian agent, oh, he is involved with Epstein.
[14:04.600 --> 14:23.600]  Then have Jane Doze, who didn't even show up in court, fake names, gnome diplomas, file reports that Epstein and Trump, whenever Trump, 25 years ago, supposedly having sex with 15-year-old girls, isn't that just incredible?
[14:23.600 --> 14:31.600]  Bill Clinton ditched Secret Service on multiple Alita Express flights report. There's the Washington Times. So that's all confirmed.
[14:31.600 --> 14:39.600]  And Mr. Bongino and other senior Secret Service agents that have gotten out because of the corruption have said that Clintons are so evil, it's worse than I say.
[14:39.600 --> 14:53.600]  Worse than Alex Jones says, worse than Info Wars. And now Bongino says, you better watch out to the Democrats in tweets because Secret Service knows what went on on the Alita Express with Jerry Epstein and Bill Clinton.
[14:53.600 --> 15:00.600]  And don't you know that all the Blackberries didn't get erased? And so the Secret Service knows what was really going on.
[15:00.600 --> 15:10.600]  So you better shut your mouth calling me a liar. And you better shut your mouth saying Bill Clinton didn't abuse women. You understand, little man? You actually said that.
[15:10.600 --> 15:25.600]  You know what? The guy shut his mouth. So I say, release everything. Release it all. Release the hounds. Let's go thermal nuclear. Release all the Clinton pedophile garbage.
[15:25.600 --> 15:32.600]  We know their eyeballs in it. They love torturing people. They love hurting children. God, they're demons from hell.
[15:32.600 --> 15:42.600]  Hillary's first job was supporting vicious child rapists. That these rape women break their jaws, just rape them till their insides come out.
[15:42.600 --> 15:50.600]  Animals. That's who they are. They're demon animals that are totally selfish. All about them and all about how they're going to hurt you.
[15:50.600 --> 15:56.600]  That's why they love radical Islam and have visited another attack on us for Christmas as usual.
[16:20.600 --> 16:38.600]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance. Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[20:27.600 --> 20:42.600]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, why is it so important that months ago I laid out specifically and exactly how they would build this momentum by denouncing their own people,
[20:42.600 --> 20:51.600]  throwing them out of the bus, making mere allegations like Judge Jury and Executioner, and get rid of their own people. What were they doing it for?
[20:51.600 --> 21:04.600]  Well, they knew that folks like John Conyers and Al Franken and Harvey Weinstein, they were all dead weight. They all had enemies in the power structure that wanted to get rid of them.
[21:04.600 --> 21:15.600]  Kevin Spacey, they believed his career had basically peaked. Everybody knew, and now it was time to start burning them, have the media give it attention,
[21:15.600 --> 21:26.600]  instead of covering it up to create the atmosphere where then people could say, well, this is hypocritical, Trump needs to go because there have been allegations.
[21:26.600 --> 21:35.600]  They've already tried race war, they've already tried culture war, they've already tried all these other hoaxes, derail the economy to derail what we're doing.
[21:35.600 --> 21:48.600]  So they're having people fall on their swords in highly Democrat districts where Al Franken won by a million and a half votes, where John Conyers wins by something like 25%.
[21:48.600 --> 22:02.600]  All of these are key areas where they just get rid of some dead wood in a safe district and then bring their people into the next election and then look like they're strong, look like they're good, look like they're doing the right thing.
[22:02.600 --> 22:14.600]  And that is exactly what they're doing. And remember, here's the key. Here's the big enchilada for the whole thing that should outrage anybody that's a thinking person.
[22:14.600 --> 22:23.600]  They covered up Weinstein for 25 years. They covered up Spacey. They covered up Conyers. They covered up Franken.
[22:23.600 --> 22:33.600]  They covered up with the big slush fund that they say now is 90% Democrat in Congress paying out not 18 million like they first said.
[22:33.600 --> 22:42.600]  Now they're reporting it's hundreds of millions because there's multiple slush funds from every Congress every two years.
[22:42.600 --> 23:04.600]  So there's a bunch of payouts, a bunch of slush funds, a bunch of hush money, and it's mainly Democrats. And you got Bill Clinton and all his rapes he settled and all the other reports and flying around on Alita Express with Harvey Weinstein, with Kevin Spacey, with all of these individuals.
[23:04.600 --> 23:14.600]  Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and it's all coming out just like Russia was going to come out, just like the pedophilia was going to come out.
[23:14.600 --> 23:24.600]  And they know Trump's making his big run to go after the pedophile networks. They've been using the blackmail and control the Democrats and Republicans.
[23:24.600 --> 23:38.600]  And so that's why they had five lawsuits filed by fake people that never showed up, that didn't exist, that Donald Trump raped little girls with Mr. Epstein.
[23:38.600 --> 23:54.600]  Because you got Bill Clinton on the plane going dozens of times to the island and going to Sheik's Islands on the plane with 10-year-old girls, folks, 10-year-old girls as young as 10, most of them about 14.
[23:54.600 --> 24:11.600]  And they posed with photos with them, Bill Clinton, Epstein, all of them with little girls. And you've got Spacey on board and you know what they got for him, just like they get Sprite and Coca-Cola and pizzas or whatever is in the refrigerator.
[24:11.600 --> 24:27.600]  Hey, there's little kids because we're the elite and we get the caviar we want. New York Post, the slave scandal that exposed pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, the slave scandal, the sex slave scandal, sex slave, sex slave.
[24:27.600 --> 24:47.600]  And now you've got all these big Soros hedge fund managers busted running sex slavery of women and little girls. Dungeons, dungeons. This is who's been running our country.
[24:47.600 --> 24:54.600]  Trump's coming after them. What are they going to do? What are they going to do?
[24:54.600 --> 25:10.600]  Trump, his whole life has been about playing it safe, being straight edge so that he can win. And he's a moral guy. He's very fastidious and he's a germaphobe. And I've talked to people who have known him 50 years, not just 40, something like Roger.
[25:10.600 --> 25:28.600]  One woman man, germaphobe, courts women, gives them all this stuff in between marriages. We're not saying that's perfect. And then when he finally wants a woman, then he agonizes it over it and even would talk to his sons when they were young adults about, well, do you like this woman and stuff?
[25:28.600 --> 25:40.600]  I mean, women, I'm just going to tell you right now, because I got this intel two years ago, because I'm checking things. Let's just say this. Donald Trump doesn't have sex on the first date or the 30th date.
[25:40.600 --> 25:51.600]  He is looking for the very best. And you can see with his wife right now, he's got it. That's about as good as it gets right there in my view. Strong, focused, powerful.
[25:51.600 --> 26:00.600]  I've met her and I've been in her presence a few times. I mean, it's just in her presence in person. It's like, that's a goddess right there. Just the energy is radiant.
[26:00.600 --> 26:13.600]  Donald Trump's not in hotel rooms with hookers urinating on him. He'd know the Russians were watching it. Plus, he's a germaphobe.
[26:13.600 --> 26:23.600]  He's told people privately, he goes, one of the biggest things he got over was shaking people's hands. The guy's a germaphobe.
[26:23.600 --> 26:38.600]  And it's all completely made up, but they're building this giant wall that Donald Trump, that Donald Trump has done all these things and none of it's true.
[26:38.600 --> 26:47.600]  None of it. None of it. If it was true, if I looked into these lawsuits two years ago and there was something real there, then I would be concerned.
[26:47.600 --> 27:01.600]  Nothing. Nothing. There's nothing. It's all lies. And then you look at Bill Clinton and Hillary and Epstein and Weinstein and Hollywood and Hillary and it's just and de Blasio's office.
[27:01.600 --> 27:10.600]  All the pedophilia bust in there. I mean, Trump is whoring in on these people. He's got them in target sites. They are scared.
[27:10.600 --> 27:17.600]  And so they start trying to conflate it. They water it down. What do you do when there's something so bombshell? It'll bring them down. You water it down.
[27:17.600 --> 27:25.600]  Like you water down liquor. You water it down. You water it down with, oh, this guy raped. Oh, this guy asked a girl out.
[27:25.600 --> 27:32.600]  This guy, everybody says, Frank's is like the most conservative to the neurotic point. You know, the extreme end of conservatism.
[27:32.600 --> 27:42.600]  His wife and they already had one child through surrogacy. He's going around handing out contracts saying, look over this, I'd pay as much as $5 million.
[27:42.600 --> 27:50.600]  You go, an egg, a sperm are put together in a Petri dish implanted, nothing sex between you and Frank's not there.
[27:50.600 --> 28:03.600]  He steps down over these women that had taken the deal would have been winning the lottery from a self-made oil man who was homeless when he was a kid for a while and took care of his younger siblings.
[28:03.600 --> 28:15.600]  I mean, I've looked into Frank, the American success story, cleft lip, hold nine yards, ends up, you know, homeless, ends up being successful.
[28:15.600 --> 28:23.600]  But again, again, the women said, well, maybe they did do what surrogacy meant. They thought maybe he wanted to have sex with them like Handmaiden's tale.
[28:23.600 --> 28:26.600]  No, it was, hey, you're healthy. Come from a good family.
[28:26.600 --> 28:35.600]  You know, but it's not even their genetics. It's his wife and him because his wife can't have the baby. She's got eggs.
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.600]  She just, she just can't have a baby in her uterus and they turn into that.
[28:40.600 --> 28:54.600]  Meanwhile, you've got airplanes with kidnap kids on them confirmed with Bill Clinton and all these people and they compare that, ladies and gentlemen, to somebody asking their secretary out two or three times, which is not good, but it's not the same thing.
[28:54.600 --> 29:17.600]  Where's how many secretaries end up getting married to their rich boss?

[29:27.600 --> 29:31.600]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead. That's true.

[32:47.600 --> 32:57.600]  and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[33:17.600 --> 33:22.600]  It's Christmas time in the city.
[33:22.600 --> 33:24.600]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:24.600 --> 33:26.600]  It's already Monday.
[33:26.600 --> 33:27.600]  Hard to believe.
[33:27.600 --> 33:30.600]  The 11th of December, 2017.
[33:30.600 --> 33:32.600]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[33:32.600 --> 33:37.600]  The big takeaway right now is this.
[33:37.600 --> 33:45.600]  I know a PR rollout when I see one from the Democratic Party, from the deep state, from the globalist.
[33:45.600 --> 33:49.600]  And that's how info wars was first months ago.
[33:49.600 --> 33:52.600]  We can put the videos and articles on screen right now.
[33:52.600 --> 34:05.600]  Was the first to predict that this whole Weinstein takedown, Hollywood takedown, Me Too movement, was being hijacked by the Democratic deep state operatives
[34:05.600 --> 34:14.600]  to create the perception that mere allegations mean a man needs to step down to conflate that and then target Donald Trump.
[34:14.600 --> 34:21.600]  And I now have CNN clips, you name it, with their own operatives admitting that that is indeed their plan,
[34:21.600 --> 34:32.600]  that they were just getting rid of dead weight in areas of the country where they already have pretty much guaranteed wins in blue state areas.
[34:32.600 --> 34:42.600]  So I've got that clip coming up later, several clips from CNN, you name it, where they admit all this, and it's so cold-blooded.
[34:42.600 --> 34:46.600]  But these politicos like to talk about how smart they are.
[34:46.600 --> 34:49.600]  So they couch it like, it's the right thing to do.
[34:49.600 --> 34:53.600]  Plus by doing this, we can now get rid of Trump.
[34:53.600 --> 35:03.600]  And then you find out GPS fusion behind attempt to tie Trump to Clinton, pedophile friend Epstein.
[35:03.600 --> 35:13.600]  Man behind the debunked dossier, it's beyond debunked, it's total fiction, pushed the myth of a close relationship with Trump and Epstein.
[35:13.600 --> 35:34.600]  Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm behind this credited Trump dossier used a bias for the government's investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged collusion where the Russia sought to tie Trump to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, a good friend of former President Bill Clinton and many of the so-called global elite.
[35:34.600 --> 35:42.600]  And then it goes through all the admissions here and now how it's been reported even in major papers that they basically cooked the whole thing up.
[35:42.600 --> 35:50.600]  And they admit here that Trump's ties were mild compared to Bill Clinton's.
[35:50.600 --> 35:54.600]  And it says, strictly social at big public events and dinners.
[35:54.600 --> 36:02.600]  And in his Marlago estate, that's private, but you know, big public gathering for members.
[36:02.600 --> 36:12.600]  While he only served 13 months in prison, it has been alleged that Epstein traffic girls as young as 12 is actually 10 to his private island to engage in sex acts with his rich friends.
[36:12.600 --> 36:21.600]  Well, it's actually come out. He's just so quote powerful and had so many rich friends like the president tied into it that the investigation stopped at that point.
[36:21.600 --> 36:24.600]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:24.600 --> 36:39.600]  George Royer is going to be in studio with us coming up the next segment before he gets in his car and drives down to the Austin Police Department to file a complaint calling for criminal investigation of Antifa.
[36:39.600 --> 36:51.600]  Here in Austin over the weekend, there was a rally, a vigil for Kate Stanley, the woman killed by illegal alien who the San Francisco jury just released saying that, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, we were politically correct.
[36:51.600 --> 36:55.600]  They just shoot a woman in the back and have her died, not even get a manslaughter charge.
[36:55.600 --> 37:03.600]  Well, the antifa was out there with their guns bumping in and hitting Owen and wouldn't let him wouldn't let him get to the rally.
[37:03.600 --> 37:18.600]  So they're violating civil rights, brandishing a literal mass group of thugs with a weapon with weapons and actually assaulting him with the clubs, hitting him in the elbows, running into him, coming up behind the camera.
[37:18.600 --> 37:21.600]  That's what they do, bumping into him on camera.
[37:21.600 --> 37:33.600]  Just straight up assault with slimy, scuzzy, smiling weirdos, the few that didn't have masks on, looking like, you know what, from central casting.
[37:33.600 --> 37:35.600]  The guy's got his finger right there by the trigger.
[37:35.600 --> 37:40.600]  He's in an aggressive stance, brandishing, ticking his finger by the trigger.
[37:40.600 --> 37:43.600]  And they tell Owen, you're scared, aren't you?
[37:43.600 --> 37:44.600]  You're shaking.
[37:44.600 --> 37:45.600]  We got guns.
[37:45.600 --> 37:46.600]  We got clubs.
[37:46.600 --> 37:49.600]  I mean, that's the definition of menacing.
[37:49.600 --> 37:55.600]  So the fact that they're menacing with a firearm while wearing masks makes it an aggravated felony.
[37:55.600 --> 38:03.600]  And vice versa, the assaulting him and blocking his entry to a public park for a rally is a civil rights violation.
[38:03.600 --> 38:10.600]  And then doing it with guns and masks is a double aggravated, double aggravated.
[38:10.600 --> 38:11.600]  Let me tell you something.
[38:11.600 --> 38:16.600]  You go in a store, you steal a case of beer, just run out the door.
[38:16.600 --> 38:18.600]  You might get six months in jail.
[38:18.600 --> 38:21.600]  You go in there with a gun, you might get 20.
[38:21.600 --> 38:24.600]  You shoot somebody, you might get life.
[38:24.600 --> 38:27.600]  It's called aggravated.
[38:27.600 --> 38:36.600]  You're wearing masks with guns, threatening people, aggravated civil rights violations, racketeering.
[38:36.600 --> 38:43.600]  They arrest people for blocking abortion clinic entrances and charging with felonies.
[38:43.600 --> 38:49.600]  Now, Clare of the Law says, you know, blocking somebody's entrance to services, commerce, whatever, that's the law.
[38:49.600 --> 38:55.600]  Well, these people have guns hitting him with clubs, surrounding him.
[38:55.600 --> 38:56.600]  And let me tell you something.
[38:56.600 --> 39:04.600]  I got so angry about this Saturday that I had trouble sleeping Saturday night.
[39:04.600 --> 39:09.600]  And I cannot get around these handy for people.
[39:09.600 --> 39:10.600]  I absolutely can't.
[39:10.600 --> 39:11.600]  It was bizarre.
[39:11.600 --> 39:15.600]  I was almost like I was like psychically led down there because I didn't know this was going on.
[39:15.600 --> 39:16.600]  Owen didn't call me.
[39:16.600 --> 39:19.600]  And I just called up Harrison, one of the camera guys that works on the weekend.
[39:19.600 --> 39:20.600]  He's on call.
[39:20.600 --> 39:26.600]  And I said, I want to go shoot somebody else from the Capitol on all this fake news that the media has been caught in.
[39:26.600 --> 39:27.600]  And he said, okay.
[39:27.600 --> 39:28.600]  And I was about 15 minutes late.
[39:28.600 --> 39:36.600]  They had just marched by through the Capitol and had just broken up and then chased the families, men, women and children that were going back to their cars.
[39:36.600 --> 39:37.600]  It was at a park by the Capitol.
[39:37.600 --> 39:43.600]  They, the police had to protect them because the Antifa chases them down like planted of the apes or something.
[39:43.600 --> 39:50.600]  You know, when they're chasing the people, they're chasing them and going to their cars.
[39:50.600 --> 39:54.600]  Millie, when they were in Berkeley, they had their car windows knocked out.
[39:54.600 --> 39:57.600]  They got robbed because they followed them to their car and followed where they went.
[39:57.600 --> 39:59.600]  And then attacked the vehicle.
[39:59.600 --> 40:11.600]  I mean, this is literally criminal games of arrested development beta cocks who have been larping, playing video games, but also live action play.
[40:11.600 --> 40:21.600]  And they are out there literally glow in the dark scum of the earth with communist flags, communist bandanas.
[40:21.600 --> 40:28.600]  Following Owen for a good 20 minutes of the hour and seven minute live feed he did till his phone cut out.
[40:28.600 --> 40:30.600]  And they are going, you're scared, aren't you?
[40:30.600 --> 40:31.600]  You're scared.
[40:31.600 --> 40:33.600]  Let me tell you, somebody's bumping me with sticks.
[40:33.600 --> 40:35.600]  And by the way, Owen's a tough guy.
[40:35.600 --> 40:36.600]  He's a real sports guy.
[40:36.600 --> 40:37.600]  And I tried to punch this with him.
[40:37.600 --> 40:38.600]  He hits really hard.
[40:38.600 --> 40:39.600]  Owen's a tough guy.
[40:39.600 --> 40:41.600]  So I'm saying it's good that he controlled himself.
[40:41.600 --> 40:43.600]  I can't get in the situation.
[40:43.600 --> 40:44.600]  One of those guys hits me one of those sticks.
[40:44.600 --> 40:46.600]  I'm going to clock him right in her little nose.
[40:46.600 --> 40:55.600]  And then I guess that you're going to try to pull their guns on us then, I mean, and by the way, they look like 120 pound methods.
[40:55.600 --> 40:58.600]  A few of them and I'm not saying they're on meth.
[40:58.600 --> 41:00.600]  I'm saying they look like Gollum.
[41:00.600 --> 41:10.600]  One of these guys, in fact, one of them that had his mask off, who was like the leader of the group, he wouldn't need makeup to play Gollum in the new Lord of the Rings.
[41:10.600 --> 41:12.600]  That's coming out to Netflix.
[41:12.600 --> 41:16.600]  I'm not Netflix. Amazon's going to put out. Yeah, let's show a side shot of this guy.
[41:16.600 --> 41:23.600]  I mean, imagine these people are out here with clubs and guns and they're trying to keep it from getting to your event.
[41:23.600 --> 41:27.600]  By the way, let me just add something to this.
[41:27.600 --> 41:30.600]  The left is going, oh Alex, I thought you like guns.
[41:30.600 --> 41:37.600]  Yeah, we have open carry rallies with them on our backs unloaded to illustrate we have a right to keep their arms, not to have a problem.
[41:37.600 --> 41:39.600]  We never have problems.
[41:39.600 --> 41:43.600]  They're not slung over our front with our hand on it under Texas law.
[41:43.600 --> 41:45.600]  That's brandishing if someone feels threatened.
[41:45.600 --> 41:49.600]  Well, Owen Schreuer felt extremely threatened.
[41:49.600 --> 41:54.600]  And I love the fact that Owen, when they said you're shaking, he said, yeah, man, you're surrounding me.
[41:54.600 --> 41:57.600]  You're hitting me with clubs and you got guns.
[41:57.600 --> 41:58.600]  And Owen's a manly guy.
[41:58.600 --> 42:00.600]  So he don't want to make a big deal about it on tape.
[42:00.600 --> 42:08.600]  When I look at you guys acting like kindergarten, Owen said, and I've had him do it to me before at other events before they even knew the name was Antifa.
[42:08.600 --> 42:14.600]  They come up behind you and hit you with their elbows or they shove you or they bump into you and they go, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[42:14.600 --> 42:17.600]  Try to act like you're going to attack them so they can all gang up on you.
[42:17.600 --> 42:20.600]  And they always pick an old man in a wheelchair or a woman.
[42:20.600 --> 42:23.600]  They beat up a Hispanic lady real bad.
[42:23.600 --> 42:29.600]  I mean, they particularly target minorities who are in these tea party events.
[42:29.600 --> 42:32.600]  And when we come up, Owen's going to be here.
[42:32.600 --> 42:38.600]  And you know, the terror attack injured the bomber injured three other people.
[42:38.600 --> 42:42.600]  Looks like the detonator went off, but didn't detonate the larger explosive.
[42:42.600 --> 42:52.600]  And of course, it's an Islamist and Google, Facebook and Twitter are now joining trying to block that saying it's fake news that has nothing to do with Islam because they said so.
[42:52.600 --> 42:54.600]  And they're the ones running the invasion.
[42:54.600 --> 42:58.600]  So they ought to know we'll be back.
[42:58.600 --> 43:09.600]  I'm so excited. The new product at infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two months servings filled to the brim filled to the absolute top, the real red bill.
[43:09.600 --> 43:14.600]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic, but doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[43:14.600 --> 43:17.600]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[43:17.600 --> 43:25.600]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing their patients, but it wasn't prescription.
[43:25.600 --> 43:29.600]  But they were charging people a hundred, two hundred dollars for the formulae.
[43:29.600 --> 43:38.600]  And I came up with our own formula working with scientists and developers non GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[43:38.600 --> 43:47.600]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglonone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[43:47.600 --> 43:50.600]  It is amazing.
[43:50.600 --> 43:57.600]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com and your purchase of the operation.
[44:21.600 --> 44:28.600]  Brain Force Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and new tropics.

[45:16.600 --> 45:20.600]  you are funding the revolution. I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[46:59.600 --> 47:09.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:09.600 --> 47:23.600]  Have yourself a merry little Christmas. Let your heart be light.
[47:23.600 --> 47:30.600]  Next year our troubles will be out of sight.
[47:30.600 --> 47:35.600]  Again, politically incorrect to say Christmas, we're going to do it.
[47:35.600 --> 47:40.600]  It will say, oh, you're so powerful you're going to do it. No, we know it's not powerful.
[47:40.600 --> 47:44.600]  We know it's pathetic that we've gotten to the point where the left is saying you can't say family.
[47:44.600 --> 47:46.600]  You can't say father. You can't say mother.
[47:46.600 --> 47:49.600]  Just seeing what we'll capitulate to, what we'll give in to.
[47:49.600 --> 47:54.600]  Owen Schreuer is going to be with us about 30 minutes to the next hour with a former NSA FBI whistleblower,
[47:54.600 --> 48:08.600]  so Belle Edmonds is going to be in studio with us and then you're going to be going down to file charges or file for a criminal investigation of your civil rights being violated by Antifa at gunpoint.
[48:08.600 --> 48:10.600]  We're going to go to you, Owen, here in just a moment.
[48:10.600 --> 48:15.600]  You're making some really big points about Fusion GPS that we'll talk about next hour.
[48:15.600 --> 48:24.600]  The high level Justice Department official who had to step down was the man between Obama, Fusion GPS, having White House meetings,
[48:24.600 --> 48:27.600]  and now it's tied into this Habib Powell lady.
[48:27.600 --> 48:30.600]  Talk about a nest of vipers still in the White House.
[48:30.600 --> 48:33.600]  These people are incredible.
[48:33.600 --> 48:39.600]  So the whole house of cards, the whole house of fraud is coming down just briefly.
[48:39.600 --> 48:48.600]  I guess a decade ago, so they started having Green Monday on the 11th of December saying, hey, don't drive in your cars.
[48:48.600 --> 48:49.600]  Don't go out.
[48:49.600 --> 48:50.600]  Don't fight the traffic.
[48:50.600 --> 48:51.600]  Shop online.
[48:51.600 --> 48:52.600]  It's easier, which is true.
[48:52.600 --> 48:54.600]  But the big thing is, don't fight the crowds.
[48:54.600 --> 48:55.600]  Don't fight the traffic.
[48:55.600 --> 48:56.600]  Get great products.
[48:56.600 --> 48:57.600]  Support the Info War.
[48:57.600 --> 48:59.600]  Support yourself at the same time.
[48:59.600 --> 49:00.600]  And we make it easy.
[49:00.600 --> 49:03.600]  So we're announcing Christmas Monday.
[49:03.600 --> 49:04.600]  How about that?
[49:04.600 --> 49:09.600]  You can say Info War started Christmas Monday, and I hope other people adopt this next year.
[49:09.600 --> 49:13.600]  And we're going to extend it throughout the week to be Christmas week.
[49:13.600 --> 49:18.600]  And ladies and gentlemen, this will be the biggest sales of the year all combined.
[49:18.600 --> 49:19.600]  Free shipping stored wide.
[49:19.600 --> 49:25.600]  We're bringing that back, but not just 50% off on 10 items like we had a few weeks ago.
[49:25.600 --> 49:34.600]  We've got more than 60 items at 50% off at infowarstore.com, including our new mega product, Alpha Power.
[49:34.600 --> 49:37.600]  It is super, super strong for stamina, libido, energy.
[49:37.600 --> 49:40.600]  Men, women can all take it, but it's powerful.
[49:40.600 --> 49:41.600]  Look out.
[49:41.600 --> 49:42.600]  50% off.
[49:42.600 --> 49:46.600]  The real red pill that ties into all of that as well and works great with brain force.
[49:46.600 --> 49:54.600]  It doesn't have stimulants, but it's got all the vitamins, all the minerals, the amino acids, and then it's got the key precursor to all the hormones you've got to have in your body.
[49:54.600 --> 49:55.600]  That is extremely powerful.
[49:55.600 --> 49:57.600]  So the real red pill.
[49:57.600 --> 49:58.600]  50% off.

[50:08.600 --> 50:09.600]  50% off.
[50:09.600 --> 50:10.600]  That is huge.
[50:10.600 --> 50:16.600]  Plus much more infowarstore.com to make a perfect Christmas for your friends and your family.
[50:16.600 --> 50:21.600]  We're bringing back one of our most popular sales of the year, but expanding it so you can save big times.
[50:21.600 --> 50:28.600]  Items like brain force and others that we just mentioned, squoidal silver, 67% off, silver bullet.
[50:28.600 --> 50:34.600]  We've dropped our entire line of super blue fluoride products, 50%, and so much more.
[50:34.600 --> 50:36.600]  I mean, again, I cannot list it all.
[50:36.600 --> 50:38.600]  We have a lot of new items in there.
[50:38.600 --> 50:40.600]  Thank you for supporting the broadcast.
[50:40.600 --> 50:43.600]  We're all doing this symbiotically.
[50:43.600 --> 50:45.600]  It really is an amazing time to be alive.
[50:45.600 --> 50:52.600]  But whatever you do, if you haven't tried the real red pill yet, takes about four or five days to kick in, alpha power kicks in in about an hour.
[50:52.600 --> 50:54.600]  And I'm just saying, look out, folks.
[50:54.600 --> 50:57.600]  I would take a half dose your first time.
[50:57.600 --> 50:59.600]  Quite frankly, I've already got so much energy and stuff.
[50:59.600 --> 51:00.600]  I don't take it all the time.
[51:00.600 --> 51:03.600]  I don't take brain force for all this stuff all the time because it's so powerful.
[51:03.600 --> 51:06.600]  I mean, like six, seven at night, if I got to work overnight, then I take it.
[51:06.600 --> 51:11.600]  But I'm already bouncing off the walls like the Tasmanian Devil from cartoons.
[51:11.600 --> 51:16.600]  But a lot of other folks just find these to be the most powerful products they've ever used.
[51:16.600 --> 51:17.600]  Find out it's a win-win.
[51:17.600 --> 51:22.600]  You can't lose because you're supporting the transmission and what we're doing fearlessly here.
[51:22.600 --> 51:27.600]  And this great crew back here that puts up with me and, of course, all of you out there symbiotically.
[51:27.600 --> 51:29.600]  Speaking of great crew, Owen.
[51:29.600 --> 51:30.600]  Merry Christmas, Alex.
[51:30.600 --> 51:34.600]  I mean, I was sensing Lord Vader was in danger.
[51:34.600 --> 51:42.600]  I went down to the Capitol and didn't even know you were going to be there.
[51:42.600 --> 51:44.600]  I didn't even know that Antifa would be there.
[51:44.600 --> 51:46.600]  I was 15 minutes late, so they just left.
[51:46.600 --> 51:48.600]  This is horrific.
[51:48.600 --> 51:49.600]  This is horrible.
[51:49.600 --> 51:53.600]  And you were manly about it when they had guns and were hitting you and all surrounding.
[51:53.600 --> 51:56.600]  But this was a group of armed, masked, communist thugs.
[51:56.600 --> 51:57.600]  That's a mouthful.
[51:57.600 --> 52:02.600]  Literally blocking your civil rights and saying, oh, you're scared, aren't you, boy?
[52:02.600 --> 52:03.600]  You're scared.
[52:03.600 --> 52:09.600]  Any jury will convict them of brandishing, of menacing, of violating your civil rights.
[52:09.600 --> 52:13.600]  I mean, this is classic, like in the Western, when six guys with guns and clubs,
[52:13.600 --> 52:16.600]  I guess it was nine or 10 of them, and go, you scared, boy?
[52:16.600 --> 52:17.600]  Do something.
[52:17.600 --> 52:19.600]  We're going to get you and start bumping.
[52:19.600 --> 52:21.600]  I mean, this was like right out of High Plains Drifter or something.
[52:21.600 --> 52:22.600]  Well, I didn't even realize it.
[52:22.600 --> 52:26.600]  But actually, if the crew goes back and rewinds that exact clip they just showed,
[52:26.600 --> 52:29.600]  the guy's actually taking the finger on and off the trigger.
[52:29.600 --> 52:30.600]  I've never even known it.
[52:30.600 --> 52:31.600]  He's ticking it.
[52:31.600 --> 52:32.600]  I didn't even know that.
[52:32.600 --> 52:35.600]  I have images, because when I go down to APD, I'm going to show them these images.
[52:35.600 --> 52:39.600]  I do believe there's multiple times where if they would have fired their weapon,
[52:39.600 --> 52:40.600]  it would have hit me.
[52:40.600 --> 52:41.600]  Now, right?
[52:41.600 --> 52:42.600]  He's aiming.
[52:42.600 --> 52:43.600]  It would have bounced up.
[52:43.600 --> 52:44.600]  He's aiming at your feet.
[52:44.600 --> 52:45.600]  Yeah.
[52:45.600 --> 52:46.600]  And there's another guy who also comes along.
[52:46.600 --> 52:47.600]  He's brandishing.
[52:47.600 --> 52:48.600]  You felt threatened.
[52:48.600 --> 52:49.600]  It was brandishing.
[52:49.600 --> 52:50.600]  They're wearing masks.
[52:50.600 --> 52:51.600]  It's aggravated.
[52:51.600 --> 52:53.600]  And Alex, I don't know.
[52:53.600 --> 52:54.600]  And they're blocking you.
[52:54.600 --> 52:56.600]  Do you know how many charges that is?
[52:56.600 --> 52:59.600]  Look, you could go to jail if you blocked the little black girl from going into school
[52:59.600 --> 53:05.600]  in 1960, President Eisenhower, just physically blocking you went to jail for five years.
[53:05.600 --> 53:06.600]  This is with guns.
[53:06.600 --> 53:08.600]  Imagine guns, little black girl.
[53:08.600 --> 53:09.600]  You're not going in.
[53:09.600 --> 53:11.600]  Well, imagine if the police did this.
[53:11.600 --> 53:14.600]  If that was the police doing it, it would all go to jail.
[53:14.600 --> 53:15.600]  Violation.
[53:15.600 --> 53:16.600]  Exactly.
[53:16.600 --> 53:21.600]  But Alex, the craziest thing is that I don't know why the cops have to stand down.
[53:21.600 --> 53:23.600]  I don't know why they're allowed to do this with mask faces.
[53:23.600 --> 53:24.600]  So that's why we're...
[53:24.600 --> 53:25.600]  It's Austin.
[53:25.600 --> 53:27.600]  That's why I'm going down to APD.
[53:27.600 --> 53:29.600]  I'm going to file charges.
[53:29.600 --> 53:34.600]  I'm going to want an investigation because we need to have a public pressure on our police
[53:34.600 --> 53:35.600]  force to do something about this.
[53:35.600 --> 53:39.600]  And as he tries to say, he's like, oh, you don't like the Second Amendment now?
[53:39.600 --> 53:41.600]  No, I never said I don't like the Second Amendment.
[53:41.600 --> 53:43.600]  I don't like you trying to intimidate me with a gun out here.
[53:43.600 --> 53:44.600]  And by the way...
[53:44.600 --> 53:47.600]  It's like saying if somebody runs over to you with a car, you go, whoa, what?
[53:47.600 --> 53:48.600]  You don't like F-150s?
[53:48.600 --> 53:49.600]  No.
[53:49.600 --> 53:54.600]  You're there blocking his access with clubs and a gun threatening him saying, ooh, you're
[53:54.600 --> 53:55.600]  scared, aren't you, boy?
[53:55.600 --> 53:56.600]  That will send them to prison.
[53:56.600 --> 53:57.600]  And I don't even...
[53:57.600 --> 54:02.600]  That comment right there shows the whole plan, the admission, the confession.
[54:02.600 --> 54:04.600]  Alex, I don't even have a free hand at this deal.
[54:04.600 --> 54:08.600]  I have one hand holding a microphone and one hand holding a camera.
[54:08.600 --> 54:09.600]  So I'm just...
[54:09.600 --> 54:11.600]  God, those guys are like textbook slimy, man.
[54:11.600 --> 54:12.600]  Oh my God.
[54:12.600 --> 54:14.600]  But you know, it's just like...
[54:14.600 --> 54:19.600]  I'm sorry that they didn't get raised right or they never got taught discipline or they
[54:19.600 --> 54:20.600]  never grew up.
[54:20.600 --> 54:23.600]  I don't know what their deal is or they're just fluoride heads that eat McDonald's.
[54:23.600 --> 54:24.600]  I don't understand...
[54:24.600 --> 54:25.600]  Look at this guy.
[54:25.600 --> 54:26.600]  Yeah.
[54:26.600 --> 54:27.600]  And then there's this guy.
[54:27.600 --> 54:28.600]  All right.
[54:28.600 --> 54:32.600]  So here's this guy, Joshua Pineda of Safe Streets Projects.
[54:32.600 --> 54:33.600]  Okay?
[54:33.600 --> 54:37.600]  He tells me, yeah, they have their faces covered so they can beat you up.
[54:37.600 --> 54:39.600]  This guy runs the Safe Streets Project.
[54:39.600 --> 54:41.600]  It's an anti-cop group.
[54:41.600 --> 54:43.600]  And he's okay with them beating me up.
[54:43.600 --> 54:44.600]  I mean, so much for Safe Streets.
[54:44.600 --> 54:46.600]  You've got armed gangs with guns.
[54:46.600 --> 54:51.600]  I mean, in the third world, you hear armed men, intimidated reporters in Venezuela.
[54:51.600 --> 54:53.600]  Or you hear, you know...
[54:53.600 --> 54:56.600]  You had armed men follow you for at least 20 minutes.
[54:56.600 --> 54:59.600]  But following me around, shoving me with clubs.
[54:59.600 --> 55:02.600]  They have these little plastic shields that they like to bring out too.
[55:02.600 --> 55:03.600]  You can see them in this video.
[55:03.600 --> 55:05.600]  They spray paint and they decorate them with all their stuff.
[55:05.600 --> 55:06.600]  Look at this guy.
[55:06.600 --> 55:08.600]  I mean, they're all wearing masks.
[55:08.600 --> 55:09.600]  They're all wearing sunglasses.
[55:09.600 --> 55:10.600]  They all have hoods over their heads.
[55:10.600 --> 55:11.600]  It was a warm day out.
[55:11.600 --> 55:14.600]  They didn't need that because they're cowards.
[55:14.600 --> 55:16.600]  That's why they bring the firearms so they can beat you up.
[55:16.600 --> 55:17.600]  There he is.
[55:17.600 --> 55:20.600]  And then if you try them, they just, you know, take you out.
[55:20.600 --> 55:23.600]  I mean, and by the way, that guy, Joshua Pineda, who runs Safe Streets projects,
[55:23.600 --> 55:27.600]  he admitted to Millie Weaver that he does good fellatio.
[55:27.600 --> 55:28.600]  He said that on camera.
[55:28.600 --> 55:29.600]  So this is the type of people.
[55:29.600 --> 55:31.600]  I mean, these people are mentally deranged.
[55:31.600 --> 55:32.600]  They're sick.
[55:32.600 --> 55:36.600]  But it's okay if a leftist makes a hateful, verbal thing on a woman.
[55:36.600 --> 55:38.600]  No, he meant on a man.
[55:38.600 --> 55:39.600]  Oh.
[55:39.600 --> 55:41.600]  Yeah, he's of that type.
[55:41.600 --> 55:43.600]  I don't want to misgender him, but...
[55:43.600 --> 55:45.600]  So the point is he's just running around.
[55:45.600 --> 55:46.600]  They're just crazy.
[55:46.600 --> 55:47.600]  These people are out of control.
[55:47.600 --> 55:51.600]  They're mental. They need some serious, serious help.
[55:51.600 --> 55:54.600]  And we don't really have the mental institution.
[55:54.600 --> 55:56.600]  Why would you tell Millie Weaver that?
[55:56.600 --> 55:58.600]  He doesn't like women.
[55:58.600 --> 56:04.600]  No, he was bragging on camera that he does good male fallatio.
[56:04.600 --> 56:06.600]  That's how sick and twisted these people are.
[56:06.600 --> 56:07.600]  I don't even care.
[56:07.600 --> 56:08.600]  That's your thing, whatever.
[56:08.600 --> 56:13.600]  But now you got guns keeping people from going to a rally of a woman kill body legal alien
[56:13.600 --> 56:15.600]  that an activist jury released.
[56:15.600 --> 56:19.600]  It's like if you shoot this girl, she dies in her dad's arms and the media goes,
[56:19.600 --> 56:21.600]  well, we don't want to give Trump a win.
[56:21.600 --> 56:24.600]  We're going to let him go, which only made Trump stronger.
[56:24.600 --> 56:25.600]  That's nothing.
[56:25.600 --> 56:26.600]  The Democrats are crazy.
[56:26.600 --> 56:30.600]  It's like the white guy that got tortured who was autistic by the six racist blacks.
[56:30.600 --> 56:31.600]  She walks.
[56:31.600 --> 56:33.600]  And they cut chunks out of his head.
[56:33.600 --> 56:34.600]  He's totally...
[56:34.600 --> 56:35.600]  That was obviously always real.
[56:35.600 --> 56:36.600]  Well, it was real.
[56:36.600 --> 56:37.600]  There were arrests made.
[56:37.600 --> 56:39.600]  And then the media said, oh, that's fake info.
[56:39.600 --> 56:40.600]  What's about this fake video?
[56:40.600 --> 56:41.600]  It's obviously not real.
[56:41.600 --> 56:46.600]  The judge released him on probation, kidnapping and torturing and saying,
[56:46.600 --> 56:48.600]  we're going to kill you.
[56:48.600 --> 56:53.600]  They did a live leak for hours talking about how we're going to gash in the back of a truck.
[56:53.600 --> 56:54.600]  We're going to throw you in the water.
[56:54.600 --> 56:56.600]  We're going to slit your throat.
[56:56.600 --> 56:57.600]  You crack your head.
[56:57.600 --> 56:58.600]  A total hate crime.
[56:58.600 --> 57:01.600]  And then the judge just says, we're letting him go.
[57:01.600 --> 57:03.600]  Well, look, you had the video surface.
[57:03.600 --> 57:04.600]  There was a case.
[57:04.600 --> 57:08.600]  I forget where it was, but there's a case where there's a guy with his hands over his
[57:08.600 --> 57:11.600]  head and the police executes him from behind.
[57:11.600 --> 57:14.600]  Now, this is a white male, so the media doesn't cover it.
[57:14.600 --> 57:19.600]  If that was a minority that got shot, the CNN would be covering all day.
[57:19.600 --> 57:20.600]  This is case closed.
[57:20.600 --> 57:22.600]  The officer was out of line and he walked.
[57:22.600 --> 57:25.600]  But they don't cover it on mainstream news because they can't race bait over it.
[57:25.600 --> 57:27.600]  They can't incite racial hatred over it.
[57:27.600 --> 57:28.600]  And it shows everything.
[57:28.600 --> 57:30.600]  It shows the double standard right there.
[57:30.600 --> 57:33.600]  When we come back, we're going to play some of this video, some of this audio.
[57:33.600 --> 57:35.600]  We've had to bleep it because these folks are hardly talked.
[57:35.600 --> 57:38.600]  Every other word is a cuss word.
[57:38.600 --> 57:39.600]  Where they go, you scared?
[57:39.600 --> 57:40.600]  You scared?
[57:40.600 --> 57:44.600]  I mean, they just have no idea that they're the archetypal group of little wimpy, demonic,
[57:44.600 --> 57:47.600]  thug, snake-like bullies.
[57:47.600 --> 57:54.600]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense,
[57:54.600 --> 57:55.600]  probiotic.
[57:55.600 --> 58:02.600]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[58:02.600 --> 58:09.600]  proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[58:09.600 --> 58:16.600]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different
[58:16.600 --> 58:21.600]  probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[58:21.600 --> 58:26.600]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[58:26.600 --> 58:28.600]  probiotic on the market.
[58:28.600 --> 58:40.600]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first round of the
[58:40.600 --> 58:45.600]  public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the info
[58:45.600 --> 58:46.600]  war.
[58:46.600 --> 58:51.600]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air.
[58:51.600 --> 58:52.600]  Matt, go ahead.
[58:52.600 --> 58:57.600]  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of info wars, and
[58:57.600 --> 59:02.600]  I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic,
[59:02.600 --> 59:06.600]  and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the info war.
[59:06.600 --> 59:12.600]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up
[59:12.600 --> 59:14.600]  right now are absolutely amazing.
[59:14.600 --> 59:15.600]  Well, thank you.
[59:15.600 --> 59:20.600]  My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me, and
[59:20.600 --> 59:24.600]  it's a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, infowars.com,
[59:24.600 --> 59:25.600]  on the right arm.
[59:25.600 --> 59:31.600]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people, and spread the word, and also exercise
[59:31.600 --> 59:32.600]  free speech.
[59:32.600 --> 59:35.600]  And the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt.
[59:35.600 --> 59:41.600]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and an infowars.com
[59:41.600 --> 59:42.600]  on the back.
[59:42.600 --> 01:00:10.600]  This is the new shirt of the mind, available exclusively at infowars.com.
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:29.600]  So Belle Edmonds is coming up with us for the next hour and a half or so.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:35.600]  She'll be here breaking down everything that's unfolding, because she's a former FBI translator
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:42.600]  of NSA transcripts, just key critical analysis on everything that's happening with Fuse and
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.600]  GPS, the Russiagate thing, the pedophile networks, everything.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.400]  You're going to be in here with us a little bit at first, but then you're going down to
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:55.240]  the police station to file a police report for criminal investigation of an armed group
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:01.400]  of masked men wearing communist bandanas and flags with assault rifles and clubs physically
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.560]  attacking you and saying, we're here to intimidate you and scare you and violate your civil
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.560]  rights.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.160]  I mean, open and shut case, it's incredible.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.360]  And the police saw the whole thing too, so they know that this happened, so I'm not
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.400]  just going to be doing them an eyewitness account that they aren't already aware of,
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.400]  so they know about that.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.720]  And you don't want to bash the police, but during the break, you asked for help, they
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.720]  stood there and watched it.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:24.720]  Yeah.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.720]  Well, I mean, I just don't understand, because clearly this is an organized group.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.160]  I mean, these guys are organized- Hey, officers, I'm trying to walk in that park and men with
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.320]  guns and masks are bumping into me- For 20 minutes!
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.880]  And the cops are like, sorry, bro!
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:41.920]  Okay, so then, and if you watch the full video, you can hear, I say, so do I have to walk
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.000]  into this crowd and have them assault me and get arrested?
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  Is that what has to happen?
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.600]  Because, I mean, essentially, that's what would have happened if I just didn't decide
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600]  to run around them.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.440]  I mean, you know, but is that what the cops wanted?
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.800]  So I said that and they still didn't do anything.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.720]  But we've got an open and shut case, we've got it all on video.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:02.680]  I do believe, again, we have it on video, the guy is like ticking his trigger with his
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.680]  finger.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.320]  They're saying, you're scared, aren't you?
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.120]  Yeah, so he's like, oh, you're scared, I'm like, well, aren't you trying to scare me?
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.120]  Yeah, there it is right there.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120]  There, he's taking his trigger finger.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.640]  I'm like, well, aren't you trying to scare me?
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.320]  You're out here with your faces covered, you're pointing guns in my direction, you're not
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.400]  letting me in the park, you're clearly violating my life.
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.280]  And all these guys look like soy boys.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.120]  I mean, you could, you know, stack up 20, 30 of them and just get a nice melee gun and
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.040]  probably get a nice workout in.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.680]  But they don't want to fight you one-on-one.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.640]  That's the thing, they want to come out here with their faces covered, with their weapons,
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.960]  and gang up on you and ambush you.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.960]  There's no way any one of those guys would have gone one-on-one with me.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.440]  There's no way.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.640]  But a lot of tyrants are cowards and they get together in big groups and take over countries.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.080]  That's, well, that's the overall doctrine.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.720]  I mean, that's what these people are following.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.720]  That's what they don't understand.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.720]  Let's play.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.720]  The history of coming.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.720]  Let's, I mean, let's play part of this video.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.720]  It's posted on infowars.com.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.720]  It's posted on our Facebook and Twitter.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.000]  And of course, you're going to retweet it, I guess, so people can find it on your Twitter.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.520]  Tell folks how they follow you on Twitter.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:04.840]  And all I do is Owen will tweet that out, shocking Antifa invades a dead woman's memorial.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.120]  That is the highlight clip.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.600]  And then the full video is also on the YouTube channel.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.320]  The whole video is an hour and seven minutes.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.320]  Let's go ahead and roll just part of the intimidation right here.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.320]  I'm scared.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.320]  Yeah, because your arm is shaking.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320]  My arm is shaking.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.320]  Yes, your left arm is shaking.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.320]  What do you think's wrong with them?
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.320]  Am I like, am I scared of you?
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.800]  I think you're absolutely terrified.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:30.080]  Well, I mean, you guys are out here with guns, so, you know, and it's not like wearing a
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.440]  Trump hat is a safe thing to do against the Second Amendment.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.440]  When did I say that?
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.040]  Well, you're the one that's saying we're out here with guns.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.540]  Is that not true?
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:39.560]  What did he just whisper in your ear?
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.800]  Are you guys planning on trying to assault me here?
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:47.200]  So, so I'm literally surrounded by a bunch of guys that have their faces covered and shields
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.320]  and bats and guns.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.360]  And he's trying to say, oh my gosh, look at this guy, he's scared.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.520]  Are you not trying to intimidate me?
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.360]  Is that not your purpose out here?
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.080]  So all I'm trying to do is to get to the Kate Steinle march because Kate Steinle was killed
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.280]  and we're trying to honor dead people.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.480]  And this is what I get.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.000]  What is wrong with you guys?
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  Seriously?
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.200]  Again, if you're a radio listener, they follow him and not letting him into the bar.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.200]  Are you guys on some sort of like pharmaceutical drugs?
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.200]  Like what is the deal with you?
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.600]  This is not normal behavior.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600]  Do you know that?
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:17.600]  You all are adults.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.320]  You're behaving like children.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.320]  You know that?
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.320]  You're behaving like children.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.320]  We're going to go to Breit.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]  We're going to go to Breit.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.320]  Right.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.320]  Atrazine.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.320]  Why don't you read a study before you come out here and cover your face?
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.320]  What are you doing?
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.000]  We're going to go to Breit and come back and I'm going to bring Sabelle Edmonds in here.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  You're going to ride shotgun with us.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  Get in the bottom of the hour.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.520]  Then I'm going to be with her for an hour and also take some calls because again, she's
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:45.480]  a perfect guest to have in studio right now to just go over the big picture from an insider
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.320]  to understand geopolitically what's happening, what's happening in the government, General
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.320]  Flynn and so much more.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.320]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.320]  Please spread the live links in fourwars.com for our show.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:03.680]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:09.040]  water supply that are making us fat, sick and stupid.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.360]  So what do we do about it?
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.840]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:20.560]  Fight back with the all new supercharged Brain Force Plus and feel the rush without
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.560]  the crash.

[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:08.680]  Hi, this is Spiro with a very important update on Newsbud's upcoming trip to Austin, Texas
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:13.040]  where Newsbud's founder Sebel Edmonds and the Newsbud crew will be joined by Mark S.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.520]  Hall to take on the guland network.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:19.680]  Now we are calling on everyone who can make it to these events to show up and take nonviolent
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:24.880]  action against this criminal network who has been able to establish over 160 charter schools
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.800]  across this country with the help of pocketed politicians loyal to the guland network which
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:34.320]  has infiltrated all branches of government and is more powerful and influential than
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.240]  the infamous George Soros.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.800]  But not many people are even aware of its existence and that's why Newsbud is taking
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.760]  action to help inform the parents who are unknowingly sending their children to these
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.080]  charter schools which have engaged in criminal activity.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:51.200]  Sebel Edmonds and the Newsbud crew will be in Austin, Texas in front of the Harmony Science
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:57.320]  Academy in Cedar Park on Tuesday December 12th from 7.45 to 9.00 a.m. where we'll be
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:01.960]  handing out flyers to parents to help them become aware of exactly who is running these
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.240]  schools and what they are engaged in.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:09.320]  Now the second event which we encourage everyone to attend will take place about an hour later
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:14.920]  in front of the Capitol building downtown Austin on Tuesday December 12th at 10 a.m.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:19.360]  Where FBI whistleblower, Newsbud founder and chief editor Sebel Edmonds will be joined
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:23.640]  by Mark S. Hall the award winning director and producer of the documentary film Killing
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.360]  Ed which focuses in detail on the guland charter schools.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.920]  They will both be speaking live in front of the Capitol.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.960]  Again, Sebel Edmonds and Mark Hall will be live speaking in front of the Texas State
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.280]  Capitol on Tuesday December 12th.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.880]  Be there at 10 a.m.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.400]  For more information about this event make your way to newsbud.com.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:45.480]  We have all of the information there, the date, the times and the locations as well
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:49.200]  as a printable version of the flyer we'll be handing out to the parents.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.800]  If you're unable to make it to Austin for this event be sure to support Newsbud's fundraiser
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.040]  so we can continue to do these events and travel across the country and keep the doors
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.440]  open here at Newsbud.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:03.800]  We're currently running a fundraiser as Newsbud is 100% independent people funded media and
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.880]  none of this is possible without your support.
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.200]  Thank you for your support and we will see you in Texas.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:42.920]  If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.040]  that's menacing me will strike in you.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.040]  The function of all life is survival.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.040]  Sleep, sleep, sleep.
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:56.040]  Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.040]  Lock the door, lock the door.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:02.040]  They're coming, they're coming, help, help, they're coming, they're coming.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.040]  Listen to me, listen to me.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:08.040]  Help me, do it next, please, please, do it next, we're in danger.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.040]  Please, listen to me, it's something terrible.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:14.040]  Please, do it next, here they are, they're already here.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:18.040]  Help, do it next, they're coming, they're coming.
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.040]  Sleep, the seed is planted.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:25.040]  Sleep, sleep, terror grows.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:29.040]  Elizabeth, wake up, get you when you sleep, sit up.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.040]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.040]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.040]  Is it contagious?
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.040]  It's from Riala homies.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.040]  It looked right at me, you need to get out.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:45.040]  You're looking at it as if it was human or not human.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.040]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.040]  We're being cornered.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.040]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.040]  Barricaded in the street.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:00.040]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.040]  The land of the walking dead.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:26.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.040]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.040]  Right, and if you're on a radio station tuning in,
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:36.040]  you heard of a promo piece for a tour that Sebel Edmonds is on,
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:39.040]  our next guest here in studio with us.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.040]  I want to keep on with Troyer and one of our reporters
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.040]  because he's been reading into her reports
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.040]  and reading her articles from newsbud.com.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:54.040]  Dealing with all this and expanding on that.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:59.040]  We've got just this incredible political backdrop
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:03.040]  that's unfolding right now here in the United States.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.040]  That's why it's good to have Sebel Edmonds here with us
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.040]  because she can get into the whole police state
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.040]  and the whole surveillance grid
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:15.040]  because she worked inside the FBI.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.040]  I think that's the best way to introduce this.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.040]  Just talk about yourself a little bit, Sebel,
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.040]  and your story because it's really kind of like a skeleton key
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:27.040]  into all these other big issues.
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:30.040]  My activism in the United States actually started
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:37.040]  with my one-year work with the FBI right after 9-11.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.040]  I became a whistleblower.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:42.040]  At the time, I didn't even know what whistleblowing was.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.040]  It's just that I saw, I got to see
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:50.040]  some incredibly high-level criminal operations
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:55.040]  and cover-up by entities within our government,
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.040]  and I didn't go and leak everything to the media.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.040]  I went to the appropriate channels.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:03.040]  I went to the Congress, the appropriate committee,
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.040]  and nothing happened.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.040]  I went to the IG, and nothing happened.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.040]  I went to the court.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.040]  I was blocked all the way.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.040]  I went up to the Supreme Court,
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:16.040]  and they said everything about what I was blowing the whistle on,
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:21.040]  reporting they were all classified at highest level.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.040]  Again, they scaled up right after 9-11,
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.040]  so you're there literally weeks after?
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.040]  Three days after.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.040]  Most of it's classified,
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.040]  but the stuff you were hearing,
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.040]  you've testified to Congress in secret,
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.040]  and you've broken some of the gag orders very valiantly
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.040]  and talked about just the incredible things you were hearing.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040]  Absolutely.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.040]  I had to go inside skiffs.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.040]  These are the secure compartmentalized facilities
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.040]  where nobody can eavesdrop.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.040]  That's where you can talk and discuss these issues
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.040]  with people who have security clearance.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.040]  And I have to say this, Alex.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.040]  Many of these issues,
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.040]  they shouldn't even have been classified.
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:03.040]  So when you have a government with unchecked power
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:06.040]  to classify and make anything they want secret,
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.040]  what you're going to get?
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.040]  You're going to get abuse of that power,
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.040]  which is exactly what they have been doing.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.040]  Non-stop.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.040]  They don't want the public to know,
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.040]  so what do they do?
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.040]  They classify it.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.040]  They say, no, you, the people,
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.040]  you don't have the right to know.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.040]  And believe me or not,
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:25.040]  FBI was being infiltrated by so many different foreign groups.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.040]  They had our so-called secrets.
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.040]  Our government had its own secrets,
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.040]  secrets that they wanted to keep from the public about themselves.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.040]  The only people, really,
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.040]  who couldn't see this information,
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.040]  happened to be the people here in the United States.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.040]  That is so powerful.
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.040]  Using the secrecy to take our liberties and take our freedoms
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.040]  and take over the culture.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.040]  But then every other government,
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.040]  all these corporations,
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.040]  they've got access to it.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:54.040]  As a new superclass, it's amazing.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.040]  Oh, it is.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:58.040]  It was, it was, it was my awakening.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.040]  Because look, I have degrees in criminal justice,
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.040]  in criminal psychology.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:05.040]  I have a master's degree in public policy.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.040]  And nothing in the government works the way they teach you.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.040]  In universities, I have a master's degree,
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:13.040]  4.0 GPA, okay?
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:18.040]  My, my, my entire education in the United States
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.040]  had to do with fantasies.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.040]  They tell you in the books
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:25.040]  how the government in the United States is supposed to work, right?
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.040]  When you go inside the government,
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.040]  you see that, in fact,
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.040]  either it works the opposite way,
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.040]  it has nothing to do with what we are teaching our kids in a school
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.040]  about this, you know, system of checks and balances,
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:41.040]  separation of powers, BS.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.040]  None of those are taking place.
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.040]  It should.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:47.040]  The reason is not because we have these people, representatives
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.040]  who have advocated their responsibility.
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.040]  What do they do?
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:55.040]  They are not out there representing the people's interests.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.040]  That includes the national security.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:02.040]  They are there to represent a very few's interest
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.040]  and their own interest.
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.040]  And this is exactly why we are in Texas.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.040]  This is why I'm in Austin today.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:13.040]  It's because I just have to tell you this, I was shocked.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.040]  When I found out about Guland Charter School,
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:22.040]  and this is the fanatic, radical, most wanted cleric, right,
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:26.040]  has the largest number of his schools here in the state of Texas.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:30.040]  He has 180 schools he operates in the United States.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:34.040]  Over 60 of them are here in the state of Texas.
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.040]  Sybil Evans, stay right there, the magnitude of the takeover,
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.040]  the infiltration, by globalists working with certain Islamic groups
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.040]  worldwide, it's so staggering, it makes the head spin.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.040]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.040]  Sybil Evans is with us.

[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.040]  So we've seen a misguided near-duel
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.040]  in New York reportedly detonate a bomb,
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.040]  but it looks like only the detonator went off
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.040]  and the major explosive didn't,
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.040]  wounding himself and three other people.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.040]  And then you've got the whole UN program
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:41.040]  running the Islamic refugees coming in from all these war zones.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.040]  You've got the EU going in and bombing Libya,
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.040]  attacking all these areas,
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.040]  engaging in all this activity.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:52.040]  And then, at the same time,
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.040]  flooding Europe with all these refugees.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:56.040]  I mean, that all fits into this,
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.040]  the whole Russiagate thing.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.040]  What you said was so powerful last segment
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.040]  in Japanese time, Owen.
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.040]  Shorter is riding shotgun with us.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:06.040]  But you said it's so powerful because it crystallizes it all.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.040]  There's this political, global, corporate super state
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.040]  that has access to all the intel,
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.040]  but nobody else does.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.040]  And the governments use it to control their people,
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.040]  and now we've seen the deep state,
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.040]  fusion GPS, the just department people,
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.040]  and the FBI using illegal warrants
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.040]  that they obtained with lies
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:28.040]  to then spy on candidate Trump,
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:30.040]  President-elect Trump, and now President Trump,
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.040]  and they can't even find anything.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.040]  No, absolutely.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.040]  There is one more element in there.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.040]  That deep state that you're referring to,
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.040]  we are all talking about,
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:44.040]  they also have this 100% control of the media,
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.040]  the mainstream media,
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.040]  because without having the mainstream media,
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.040]  they can't have this control.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.040]  And you were talking about that during the break to Owen,
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.040]  because I walked back in and overheard it now,
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.040]  there's only a few places that will cover this.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:00.040]  Yes, for example, we are talking about this mullah,
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:04.040]  this imam, this radical terrorist,
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.040]  Fethulak Yulit, okay?
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.040]  He is one...
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.040]  They believe he's a Mahdi, like a Christ.
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.040]  But do you know how the mainstream media
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:14.040]  in the United States is representing this guy?
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:19.040]  They are referring to him as the moderate Islamist scholar.
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:22.040]  First of all, Fethulak Yulit went to
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.040]  three years of primary school in Turkey, okay?
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:27.040]  That is his scholarly background.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:30.040]  He doesn't even have a high school diploma.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.040]  So he went to the third grade.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.040]  That's right.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:36.040]  And he's wanted, not only in Turkey,
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.040]  but in other countries, okay?
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.040]  He has these types of charter schools
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.040]  in other parts of the world,
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.040]  but he calls them madrasas.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.040]  These are not regular schools, they are madrasas.
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:49.040]  So Russia kicked him out years ago,
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.040]  and they banned him, okay?
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:52.040]  He's wanted in Russia.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:56.040]  He can't operate and have these madrasas in Russia.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:59.040]  But do you know how extremist this guy is?
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.040]  Think about it this way, Alex.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:04.040]  Pakistan with large number of madrasas, right?
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:07.040]  Pakistan, the government in Pakistan,
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:11.040]  considers this guy such a radical extremist
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:15.040]  that they banned his madrasas schools in Pakistan.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:20.040]  So you tell me, how can a most wanted terrorist, okay,
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:24.040]  this Imam come to the United States in 1998
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:27.040]  and become the largest operation
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:30.040]  for U.S. charter schools' education system?
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.040]  You are looking at Muslim country,
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.040]  Pakistan calling this guy a radical extremist, right?
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.040]  Kicking him out.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:43.040]  He's getting $850 million U.S. taxpayers' money.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.040]  And you know what he does with this money?
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.040]  Do you think this money is going to the teachers
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.040]  who are working there?
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:52.040]  This has been exposed, but you will not read this
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.040]  on any mainstream media outlet.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:56.040]  Well, I remember about five years ago hearing people go,
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.040]  there's this big Islamist,
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:00.040]  and he's the biggest owner of charter schools,
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.040]  and he first met with Bill Clinton,
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:04.040]  and this is a big scam to their foundation.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:07.040]  And I remember hearing that on Mainline Talk Radio thing,
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.040]  and these right-wingers are full of baloney,
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.040]  some more of libertarian.
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:13.040]  I couldn't believe that the biggest charter schools
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.040]  in the country that kind of slipped in their propaganda
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.040]  as well was this guy.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.040]  And then we finally covered it about a year and a half ago,
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:22.040]  all hell broke loose, hack attacks, threats.
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:25.040]  We've never had stuff like when we just reported on it
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.040]  and actually went and just showed some of the schools
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.040]  right here in Austin for folks that don't know,
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:35.040]  explain about, they believe he is this messianic person
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.040]  who's going to bring this final giant war,
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:40.040]  so they believe he's like a god,
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.040]  I mean, I guess like a cult leader, Kim Jong-un.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.040]  How did he get so powerful and so rich?
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.040]  Tell us about it.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.040]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.040]  He's richer than George Soros.
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:51.040]  His network in the United States for his operations,
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:54.040]  and these are front companies, front NGOs,
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.040]  front foundations, and the charter schools tax,
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.040]  thanks to the U.S. taxpayers,
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.040]  is 50 plus billion dollars.
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:04.040]  That puts him...
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.040]  Globally, it's over 100 billion.
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.040]  Oh, yes, absolutely.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.040]  He has...
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.040]  Well, clearly he was set up with the Clintons as a front,
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040]  so who is he?
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.040]  Oh, he was brought into the United States by the Clinton.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:18.040]  In 1998, per directive by Bill Clinton,
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.040]  he was placed on this Gulfstream, CIA Gulfstream,
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:25.040]  and while he was most wanted by Turkey,
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.040]  and this is NATO ally,
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.040]  he was brought into the United States.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.040]  Initially, he lived in Langley area,
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.040]  next to CIA's headquarters.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:37.040]  Then he settled with his big castle compound in Pennsylvania,
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:40.040]  and he has been protected, and guess what?
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.040]  Some documents released by WikiLeaks about a year or two ago
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.040]  expose how many million dollars
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.040]  his network has been giving to Clinton Foundation.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.040]  Okay?
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.040]  Now, as I said...
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.040]  So that's how they work.
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.040]  They let him come in, they let him do things.
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.040]  Nobody else was allowed to do it.
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.040]  They let him be tax exempt.
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.040]  They move the money around,
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.040]  and then a bunch of it goes back to the Clintons,
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.040]  and then they use it as schools, as networks globally,
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.040]  for their brand of Islamic takeover.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.040]  Right.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.040]  Chicham, terrorism, al-Nusra.
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.040]  There are so many different factions across the world
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:12.040]  that is being supported by his heroin money,
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.040]  by his money laundering.
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:16.040]  Let me just quickly recap how he launders
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:18.040]  taxpayers' money in the United States.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.040]  So, $850 million he gets.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:23.040]  What he does, he brings in teachers from other countries,
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.040]  Saudi Arabia, Turkey.
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.040]  We don't have teachers in this country.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.040]  So, we have to bring, and there is, you know,
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:32.040]  there is, there are no unemployed teachers,
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.040]  qualified teachers who need jobs.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.040]  So, we bring these teachers, he brings them
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.040]  into the United States.
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.040]  He says, okay, I'm going to give you $3,000 per month,
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.040]  or $4,000.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:44.040]  50% of this, you're going to write a check
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:47.040]  from your checkbook and donate to this organization
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.040]  I have.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.040]  It's maximum tax-free.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.040]  That's right.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.040]  So, those teachers are victims too,
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:55.040]  because he blackmailed them.
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.040]  But because of the Clintons, nothing's ever done.
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.040]  Anybody else did that, they would be arrested.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.040]  But no...
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:04.040]  It actually continued even during Bush administration.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:05.040]  Sure.
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.040]  Because Mueller, Mueller and FBI,
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.040]  every time the FBI agents,
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.040]  they would gather so much evidence against this guy.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:13.040]  They wanted to go to court.
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.040]  Sure, just like Uranium One.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:17.040]  That's absolutely right.
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.040]  So, he was a gatekeeper for eight years.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.040]  Oh, and how powerful is this?
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:23.040]  It ties into everything.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:25.040]  Well, there's so many different angles we can go down.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.040]  And I actually want to go back to what you said
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:28.040]  in the first segment you were on,
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:30.040]  how you've got all of these different countries
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:33.040]  with operatives inside the United States government
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:36.040]  that have access to all of this classified,
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.040]  highly sensitive material
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.040]  that would be considering,
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:43.040]  that's compromising national security, right?
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.040]  But here we are,
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.040]  freaking out about some Trump-Russia collusion
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.040]  that never existed, never happened.
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:49.040]  There's nothing there.
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.040]  They've been searching for a year.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.040]  They spent over $7 million investigating this.
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:56.040]  Yet, there's this entire apparatus
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:59.040]  of sensitive information that dozens, if not,
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.040]  perhaps every country on Earth
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.040]  could infiltrate and have access to.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.040]  No investigation there.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:07.040]  No security council, no private investigation,
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.040]  no team, nothing.
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:10.040]  It's all Trump-Russia that doesn't exist.
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:12.040]  I mean, that's like the most frustrating thing.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.040]  I mean, other than a terrorist network infiltrating,
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.040]  you know, the U.S. military.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.040]  And let's not just forget the seven-plus million
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:21.040]  for the fake Mueller investigation in the last 11 months.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.040]  You have the 13 million for the Piscay
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:26.040]  and the same guy made up the stuff about Trump and Epstein
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.040]  because it's the Clintons on the pervert plane.
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.040]  Yep.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.040]  No, absolutely.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:32.040]  In fact, oh, and you and I were talking about,
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:35.040]  because here I have a list of Texan politicians,
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.040]  elected officials, okay?
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.040]  These are in Congress, okay?
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.040]  These are the state representatives in Texas
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:45.040]  who have been getting tens of thousands of dollars
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:49.040]  from this criminal radical terrorist network.
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.040]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:29:19.040]  Stay right there.
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:48.040]  Thank you.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:53.040]  Thank you.
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:44.040]  Thank you.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:54.040]  Thank you.

[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:06.040]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.

[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:14.040]  over-the-top stamina, libido, workout brain formula

[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:20.040]  and from seeing my friends and family use it

[01:32:51.040 --> 01:33:18.040]  Yeah!
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:34.040]  So, Bill Edmonds is our guest.
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:36.040]  I want to show you a great InfoWars.com reporter
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.040]  riding shotgun with us
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.040]  and all of these subjects he's covering
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:43.040]  tie in to the shadow state,
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.040]  the whole surveillance grid,
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:48.040]  all the rest of these systems.
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:52.040]  But if we expand on this,
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.040]  we have to ask ourselves,
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:56.040]  why has this network been allowed to operate this long?
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.040]  We're going to get back to that here in just a moment.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:02.040]  But first off, we are listener-supported.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.040]  It's how we fund this operation,
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:07.040]  and we sell really high-quality products
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.040]  to be able to do it.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:12.040]  And I just want to encourage the listeners to know
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.040]  that since they're demonizing anything traditional
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.040]  or demonizing anything that has any connotations
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:21.040]  of the Western world or whatever,
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:24.040]  why not have Christmas week?
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.040]  Plus it's politically incorrect.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.040]  It has some of the biggest sales of the year,
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:30.040]  the week before the final week comes up
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.040]  for the stretch into Christmas.
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:34.040]  So, I guess it was 10 years ago or so,
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:37.040]  eBay came up with not Cyber Monday,
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.040]  but Green Monday saying,
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.040]  don't drive around your cars,
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.040]  don't fight the traffic,
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.040]  don't stand in lines,
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.040]  why not just order stuff online,
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.040]  which is a pretty smart thing to do,
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:49.040]  but what about just saving your time and your energy
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:52.040]  and not wasting money on buying all that gas?
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:54.040]  It's certainly true.
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:56.040]  So, we're going to extend this throughout the week.
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:58.040]  It started today.
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.040]  I'm announcing it.
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.040]  It's called Christmas Week,
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:03.040]  massive Christmas savings at infowarstore.com,
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.040]  plus site-wide free shipping.
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.040]  We have a new alpha power.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.040]  It's designed for men,
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:10.040]  but it's great for women as well.
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:13.040]  Libido, Energy, Stamina, you name it, 50% off.
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.040]  The Real Red Pill, 50% off.
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.040]  DNA Force, 33% off.
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.040]  Survival Shields, 50% off.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.040]  Knockout, 50% off.
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:22.040]  Prostigar, 50% off.
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:24.040]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 50% off.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.040]  InfoWars Life, select survival food,
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:28.040]  and it's not just select ones.
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:29.040]  It's called InfoWars Select.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.040]  It's powered by my page with supplies.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.040]  They're full catalog.
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:34.040]  50% off, plus much more
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:37.040]  at infowarstore.com,
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.040]  or you can also call toll free,
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.040]  triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:44.040]  And we don't make huge profit on each item
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.040]  because we sell it so low,
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.040]  but that's great because we end up selling more
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.040]  in the aggregate to help fund the operation.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:50.040]  But whether it's fluoride free,
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.040]  colloidal silver, and iodine,
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.040]  empowered and fortified, high quality toothpaste,
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.040]  or whether it's the supplements,
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.040]  or books, or videos, or t-shirts,
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:02.040]  they're all available at infowarstore.com,
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:05.040]  or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:09.040]  So, again, those are there on the site right now.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:10.040]  So many specials.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.040]  I can't list them all,
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.040]  but really check out the Real Red Pill,
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.040]  the new product,
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:18.040]  along with the new product, Alpha Power.
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.040]  We're gonna call it Alpha Male,
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.040]  but I thought, you know,
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:22.040]  when they really call this Alpha Power,
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.040]  because the formulators say it's great for women as well.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.040]  It is the strongest supplement of its type out there
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.040]  from our research.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:33.040]  It increases physical and mental focus,
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:34.040]  boosts sports performance,
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:36.040]  and we can actually say all these things.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:38.040]  Okay, again, just riveting info,
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:42.040]  and Shabelle, I only say this because I know
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:44.040]  you're an FBI translator,
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:46.040]  heard all the secret NSA stuff that happened
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.040]  around for 9-11,
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.040]  we're a key witness in Congress,
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:50.040]  just across the board,
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:52.040]  and I know that Goulon,
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:54.040]  these things you've said have been said in the news.
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:55.040]  I know he's been in,
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:57.040]  dited in a bunch of foreign countries.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.040]  I know that it's reported that they're just amassing
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.040]  these hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:03.040]  that these schools are the most dominant in the U.S.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.040]  out of nowhere,
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.040]  they fly us around on CIA aircraft,
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:10.040]  but when you say heroin money or opium money,
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.040]  because again, I haven't seen that,
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.040]  and I'm not challenging you,
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:15.040]  but I am just saying,
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.040]  what's the proof of that?
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.040]  Because I mean,
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:20.040]  we know Turkey's a big gateway for all of that,
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:22.040]  but what else?
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:25.040]  Turkey used to be a major gateway for all that,
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.040]  but things started changing after 2000,
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:33.040]  and many of these labs and hubs for the heroin
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:36.040]  that is driven from the opium,
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:39.040]  from the poppies in Afghanistan,
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:43.040]  they relocated to Central Asia and Caucasus nations,
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:45.040]  for example, Azerbaijan,
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:50.040]  which is one of the largest hub for fetulaculans network,
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.040]  and what happens is that's where it's being processed,
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.040]  and then we do use,
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.040]  and I have to say this,
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.040]  both NATO transportation means,
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.040]  such as even NATO planes,
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.040]  to move this heroin,
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:06.040]  they're ready to be consumed heroin,
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.040]  into Europe,
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:10.040]  and one of the largest hubs,
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:12.040]  actually two of them is Belgium,
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.040]  the second one is in Netherlands,
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:16.040]  and from there,
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:19.040]  the artery takes all this heroin across the...
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:21.040]  And by the way,
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:24.040]  that's what you testified to in Congress,
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:26.040]  is that the type of intercepts you were hearing,
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:29.040]  so are you saying you have evidence of this from intercepts
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.040]  you listened to in the FBI?
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:33.040]  FBI, it was not only me,
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:36.040]  the whole department dealing with the counterintelligence,
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:39.040]  dealing with Central Asia, Caucasus, Turkey,
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.040]  they already knew about it.
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:42.040]  Had you heard of Gulan then?
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:43.040]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.040]  See, I was the first person coming out publicly,
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:50.040]  naming this guy in 2006, 2007.
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:53.040]  At that time, this profile was not out there,
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.040]  by the Ministry of Media, this scholar.
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.040]  Every time I brought up Gulan,
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:58.040]  people would say,
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:38:59.040]  what are you talking about?
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.040]  Who is this Gulan guy?
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:04.040]  But that brings me to why I'm in Texas.
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:06.040]  Look, you mentioned Christmas,
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.040]  it's supposed to be politically incorrect,
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.040]  because I'm going to be one too.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:11.040]  I don't travel usually during the Christmas season.
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.040]  I want to spend that time with my family,
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.040]  with my nine-year-old daughter.
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:20.040]  I'm in Texas because I want to not only
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:23.040]  challenge Gulan's network,
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.040]  which is deepest in two states,
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.040]  Illinois, Obama's state,
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:32.040]  and Texas, the two largest hubs in the United States.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.040]  And there are people,
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:38.040]  there are American U.S. representatives
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:41.040]  who have been elected by the Texans,
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:45.040]  placed in office to represent the interest,
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:49.040]  the best interest of the Americans,
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:50.040]  their constituents.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:52.040]  But these people have been pocketed,
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:54.040]  and the reports are out.
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:57.040]  Even the left website,
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.040]  Center for Public Integrity,
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.040]  a year ago,
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:02.040]  put out how many hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:04.040]  each one of these representatives
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:05.040]  have been getting...
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.040]  That's bipartisan, isn't it?
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.040]  Well, I thought so.
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.040]  It is to a large degree, absolutely.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:14.040]  But for some reason, when it comes to Texas,
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.040]  I have a printout here.
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:18.040]  These are the representatives
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:21.040]  who have gone to lavish trips to Turkey,
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:23.040]  and they're all Democrats.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:26.040]  In Texas, especially in Texas.
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.040]  And I tried to find one or two representatives
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.040]  who are on our side, and they are looking at...
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.040]  Yeah, I was trying to be fair,
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:34.040]  because I didn't own research like I said a year and a half ago.
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:36.040]  We did a bunch of reports, David Knight did.
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:38.040]  And I mean, they really, stuff went crazy
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.040]  when we started covering it.
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.040]  And here we are again.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.040]  But I noticed it was mainly Democrats,
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:46.040]  because the Clintons had brought them in,
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:47.040]  and I...
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:50.040]  So, I guess then they give money into this,
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:51.040]  what do they get?
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:53.040]  I guess money back.
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.040]  Well, not only that they get campaign money,
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:58.040]  go on these very luxury trips,
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:59.040]  first-class tickets.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:01.040]  They take their spouses and their kids.
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:02.040]  They go to Turkey.
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.040]  These are the Texas...
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:04.040]  And then who knows what else,
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:05.040]  because the Gula Network...
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.040]  Lots of gifts, okay?
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:07.040]  Tens of thousands of dollars...
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.040]  It's like the second most...
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:11.040]  It's like the second most powerful group in Turkey, right?
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:13.040]  I would say first.
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.040]  I mean, it depends on who you're asking.
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:18.040]  But I tried to find, in Texas, representatives
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.040]  who have stood up for the people,
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.040]  and the interests of the Texans here,
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.040]  especially with the...
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.040]  How did Gula get so powerful?
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.040]  I mean, before he came here,
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.040]  and the Clintons set him up,
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:30.040]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.040]  Because everything that they needed
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:34.040]  to set up this whole presence
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.040]  was given to them by the CIA.
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.040]  Their front NGOs, their...
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:42.040]  The guy is not even US citizen, okay?
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.040]  His green card...
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.040]  Let's list some of these Democrats in Texas.
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:46.040]  Okay.
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:49.040]  Well, before, let me mention someone who's good, okay?
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:52.040]  Let's give credit to someone who has been doing a good job.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:55.040]  Here is a congressman, Texan, okay?
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:56.040]  His name is...
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:57.040]  Here it is.
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.040]  The only one we have found in Texas.
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:02.040]  Republican congressman, Dan Flynn.
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:03.040]  He's the...
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.040]  And he's the chair of the House Pension Committee
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.040]  and sits on the Defense and Veterans Committee.
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:10.040]  He's the only one with guts
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.040]  who have stood up for the security,
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:15.040]  for the welfare of the Texans, okay?
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.040]  He actually said this.
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.040]  This is a quote I'm gonna read
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:22.040]  from congressman Dan Flynn.
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:23.040]  He said,
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:26.040]  Texas taxpayers are in fact in danger
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:28.040]  and our education system,
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:31.040]  not to mention the safety of our citizens,
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.040]  seems to be in peril.
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:35.040]  This is on Gulan Network.
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:37.040]  He's the only congressman,
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:39.040]  and we really have to give him the credit.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:42.040]  And now let's read these towers, okay?
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.040]  Because they have been under investigation.
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:46.040]  Incredible. Stay there.
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:48.040]  And I was sure I want you to jump in because
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:49.040]  I know a lot about this as well.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:50.040]  It's why I kept you in here.

[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:12.040]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:13.040]  of the Augusting Worldwide.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.040]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.040]  I'm Troyers riding shotgun with us.
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:18.040]  He's about to get in his car in about 10 minutes
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:21.040]  and drive down with a crew to the
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.040]  awesome police department because Antifa
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:27.040]  with guns wearing mask yesterday
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:31.040]  kept him from being able to
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:34.040]  go to a park for a vigil for a woman
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:36.040]  slain-binding legal alien.
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:39.040]  So that's just some of the news that we've got
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:42.040]  on that front and that ties into Antifa
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:44.040]  because we were talking about Antifa during the break
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:46.040]  and how it ties into the CIA, the Clintons,
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:48.040]  the Goulang network and all the rest of it
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.040]  because it's Antifa that's been coming after
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:53.040]  Sebel and threatening her online
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.040]  and things because they're funded by Soros.
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.040]  It's the same giant rogue group
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:59.040]  in our intelligence agency.
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:01.040]  Owen, I know you've got some points.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:02.040]  I want you to jump in here.
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:04.040]  I couldn't believe it when you were talking about
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:07.040]  your plan tomorrow to go to these offices
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:09.040]  and to raise awareness about the Goulang
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.040]  charter school network and you were saying
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:13.040]  how you're expecting Antifa to show up.
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.040]  I couldn't even believe that.
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:16.040]  I mean, why would Antifa show up
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:19.040]  for you trying to redress
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.040]  your grievances with government here,
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:23.040]  but more specifically you're saying
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:26.040]  they're showing up and they're targeting
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:28.040]  your reports and your coverage
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:30.040]  because they say you're anti-Islam.
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:33.040]  So it just makes no sense to me.
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:35.040]  What do they think happened in New York today?
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.040]  I actually, I want to go,
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:39.040]  if they're going to be there, I want to be there too
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.040]  because I'm sick of these people.
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:44.040]  I'm ready to meet them again and they need to know
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:46.040]  that we're not going to be standing down
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:47.040]  to their bullying.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.040]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:51.040]  See, because if they're going to stop you
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:54.040]  from talking to our actual representation
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:56.040]  and they're going to stop me from going
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:59.040]  to a political event, I mean, this is open shut case.
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:01.040]  This is a denial of civil rights
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:03.040]  and it's time to start putting these people behind bars
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:05.040]  and I'm telling you, I'm telling you,
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:07.040]  as soon as they start getting arrested,
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:09.040]  they're not going to show up anymore.
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:11.040]  They will be gone and they'll be done with it.
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:14.040]  It's Democrat cities are letting them do this.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.040]  Absolutely shocked because yesterday I got these texts
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:20.040]  from our community members,
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:22.040]  from our Newsbot community members saying,
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:23.040]  don't go to Austin.
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:26.040]  It's too dangerous and they cited your case
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:28.040]  and they said most, you know, the police,
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:29.040]  they stood there.
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.040]  They didn't do really anything about this.
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:33.040]  We're going to apply pressure today.
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:35.040]  I would like, I would like, I would like
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.040]  for us to come and capture that as well
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:39.040]  because, you know, it's one thing
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:42.040]  if something like this happens in one of the,
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:44.040]  not that I have anything against vegetarians,
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:47.040]  but vegetarian states in New England, okay?
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.040]  Where you have these people all gathering,
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.040]  but happening in Texas, I have to say,
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.040]  I was flabbergasted.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.040]  This is happening in Texas.
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:00.040]  Armed groups, 30, 40 men in masks with guns
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.040]  saying you're not going on the Capitol grounds
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:05.040]  and just ramming you and saying, are you scared?
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:06.040]  Are you scared?
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:09.040]  You know why I'm really angry about this?
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:12.040]  Because I moved to Oregon five years ago, Alex,
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:15.040]  and we covered Malhoor protests, okay?
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:16.040]  With the militia.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:20.040]  And these people were peace-loving family people.
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:23.040]  They had zero incidents of violence,
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:26.040]  except the one that was perpetuated by our government,
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:29.040]  killing an unarmed, innocent man
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:31.040]  that I went to his funeral, okay?
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:34.040]  And this is Levoie Finnecombe, okay?
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:37.040]  And day in, day out, every single day,
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.040]  mainstream media portrayed them as what?
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:43.040]  As violent, skinhead, look, they are carrying guns.
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.040]  Yet, I couldn't find this incident with Owen
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:47.040]  on any of the mainstream media.
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:48.040]  But you know what?
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:52.040]  This is Texas, and what I'm surprised are Texans.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:55.040]  I mean, what happened to the Texans mentality?
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:57.040]  Well, people expect the cops to do something
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:58.040]  and the police are ordered to stand down.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:00.040]  Well, by the way, the antifa,
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:02.040]  support the cop killing groups.
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:05.040]  The police literally bow down to the people that kill them.
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.040]  Well, here's what, here's the strange dynamic,
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:09.040]  because obviously I've become familiar
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:11.040]  with a lot of these police officers in Austin,
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:12.040]  and most of them are good people,
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:14.040]  and we'll have conversations, and we'll talk,
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.040]  and we'll try to work things out.
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:16.040]  So it's obvious-
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:18.040]  We're not saying they're individually bad.
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:21.040]  No, no, no, it's obvious to me that there is some sort of order.
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:22.040]  They're under some sort of order.
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:24.040]  They're under some sort of directive
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:26.040]  to not deal with these people,
[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:28.040]  to let them do whatever it is.
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:30.040]  And part of me can understand it's like,
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:32.040]  okay, they are a group of crazed individuals,
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:34.040]  and maybe they'll eventually go away,
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:35.040]  but they're not.
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:36.040]  They're getting more violent.
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:38.040]  They're getting more vitriolic.
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:39.040]  They're bringing more guns.
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.040]  They're masking themselves.
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:41.040]  They're intimidating women.
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.040]  I mean, it has to stop.
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:45.040]  So that's why we're going to go apply public pressure.
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:46.040]  I'm going to state my cases.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.040]  They've got multiple charges that we don't want to win.
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:51.040]  You were there, you shot an hour and seven minute live video.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:53.040]  We have videos of women being beaten up.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:54.040]  I know.
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.040]  Oh, yeah, Millie deals with it too.
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:57.040]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:59.040]  I couldn't believe that they're going to show up to protest her.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:02.040]  I'm shocked that they even have the wherewithal to follow news.
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:05.040]  By the way, she's a famous lady that exposed 9-11.
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:06.040]  Exposed Bush.
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:07.040]  I don't understand why.
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:08.040]  Exposed the whole thing.
[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:09.040]  And not the only dad, Alan.
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:10.040]  And drug dealing and child kid.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:12.040]  Remember, you were the first to say
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:15.040]  these international rings are trafficking in children.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:17.040]  And now it's all coming out.
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:18.040]  You know what?
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:19.040]  I know it's classified,
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.040]  but what did you hear in the FBI situation?
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:23.040]  Alex, Alex, what is ironic?
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:26.040]  I come from Turkey, Muslim country, right?
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:31.040]  They are calling me anti-Islam xenophobic racist sexist.
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:33.040]  I mean, how could that be?
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:34.040]  I'm from Turkey.
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:36.040]  My grandparents are Muslims, right?
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:39.040]  And they're saying I'm going after this terrorist,
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:42.040]  this radical has nothing to do with Islam.
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:44.040]  But see, you're a smart, successful woman with degrees.
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:47.040]  It's been a whistleblower and you're good looking.
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:49.040]  They want you to just shut up.
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:53.040]  Women, the controlled left just wants women to sit down
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:56.040]  and shut up and then claim that they represent you.
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:58.040]  That's why, because you're effective, they're scared.
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:01.040]  And this big Clinton Foundation network is Goulon.
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.040]  It's clear.
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:03.040]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:04.040]  It's the Clintons.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:05.040]  Are you kidding me?
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:06.040]  Absolutely.
[01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:07.040]  But look.
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:09.040]  Yeah, we don't just blame Soros.
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.040]  It's because he's behind everything.
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:11.040]  Oh, he is?
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.040]  It's like door number one, Soros.
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:13.040]  Door number 10, Soros.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:14.040]  Door number five, Soros.
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:16.040]  Door number 70, Soros.
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:19.040]  I mean, literally, I expect he appears in a poof of smoke
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:20.040]  like the devil.
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:22.040]  Door number 80, Clinton holding Soros' hand.
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:24.040]  Yeah, it's always the same thing.
[01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:27.040]  Well, tomorrow we're going to be in front of the Capitol building.
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:28.040]  What time is that?
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:30.040]  10 o'clock in the morning, OK?
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:33.040]  I traveled all the way from Oregon to be here.
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:34.040]  I'm joining you.
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:35.040]  I'm joining you.
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:36.040]  If Antifa's going to be there, I'm going to be there too.
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:37.040]  OK.
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:38.040]  This is ridiculous.
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:41.040]  So I'm asking the like-minded that the real Texas is full of.
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:43.040]  I feel like I'm sending everybody off to war.
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:44.040]  No, this is getting crazy.
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:45.040]  Because they need to.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:46.040]  I mean, we got to do something.
[01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:50.040]  Oh, and Texans need to show that we have spined here.
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:51.040]  OK.
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:54.040]  Yeah, communist communists wearing guns and clubs.
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:55.040]  I know.
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:56.040]  I can't believe it.
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:57.040]  I have lived all over the world.
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:58.040]  OK.
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:00.040]  And I have been in some of these countries.
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:05.040]  And I tell you, these people, they are the American jihadis.
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:09.040]  The Antifa people, they are the American jihadis.
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:12.040]  And they look, whether they're black or white, they're mainly white.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:17.040]  They have that same zombie look that jihadis have, where they look like their brain got sucked out.
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:18.040]  I'm not just saying it.
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:20.040]  They all look like zombies.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:21.040]  What's wrong with them?
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:26.040]  But doesn't it show you how much they lack intelligence and education, where they're
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:29.040]  coming after you saying you're anti-Islam, anti-Xenophobic or whatever.
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:31.040]  They don't know your history.
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:34.040]  Or they come out here and they say that they're anti-fascist.
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:36.040]  Well, that's just their cover to be vicious to her.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:40.040]  And then the modern left goes, oh, if they're saying that she's a conservative killer.
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:43.040]  Because it's a dehumanization like Hitler and the Jews.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:45.040]  They just demonize the group.
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:47.040]  And then once they've demonized it, they can do whatever they want.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:51.040]  And they don't understand anything about fascism, where if they lived in a fascist country,
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:53.040]  they'd all be in jail.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:54.040]  They'd all be in jail.
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:55.040]  But it's beyond that.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:56.040]  It's beyond that.
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:57.040]  They want power.
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:59.040]  They're all beta male, soy boy cucks.
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:03.040]  And they want to use the systems protecting them to go out and be thugs.
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:06.040]  So we need to bring down those systems if they're built to protect them,
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:09.040]  because they're supposed to protect the people and the republic,
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:11.040]  not violent offenders.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:17.040]  Well, I hope that I'm going to see many Texans in Austin joining us tomorrow morning,
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:18.040]  10 o'clock in the morning.
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:20.040]  You know, it's early for them.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.040]  Antifa, that's a little early for them.
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:22.040]  They like to sleep in.
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:23.040]  I believe that.
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:25.040]  But I have a list of names here.
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:28.040]  There are four traders here.
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:30.040]  These are the Democrats in Texas.
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:32.040]  And I had no idea that they were all going to be Democrats.
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:37.040]  I didn't know until I started printing out the names for the Texan elected politicians.
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:39.040]  And you know what?
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:44.040]  The whole thing is, you can go and vote for a president and say, drain the swamp.
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.040]  We got to drain it local.
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:47.040]  We have to drain the swamp ourselves.
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:49.040]  So let's read the people that are on the Goulon payroll.
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:52.040]  These are the swamp people we need to get rid of.
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:53.040]  We want to break in about a minute.
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:59.040]  So we have Congresswoman Donna Howard, OK, District 48.
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:03.040]  We have Congressman Eddie Lucio, District 38.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:08.040]  We have Congresswoman Alma Allen, District 131.
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:14.040]  And we have Congresswoman Sanfronia Thompson, District 141.
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:20.040]  These people have pocketed tens of thousands of dollars from these radical terror organizations.
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:25.040]  They have gone on the trips, luxury trips to Turkey, five-star resorts.
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:28.040]  Some of them have taken their spouses with them.
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:34.040]  And they are allowing these charter schools to operate without any scrutiny.
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:41.040]  So many people have filed for investigation because even people from the left, NWACP, they are not doing it.
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:42.040]  They have been pocketed.
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:43.040]  This is the swamp.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:48.040]  This is not something that you can expect from one president to go and drain.
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:53.040]  Every one of these people living in these districts have the obligation.
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:54.040]  It's incumbent.
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:56.040]  You know, we have to do this.
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:58.040]  We have to drain the swamp ourselves.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:02.040]  Don't sit and say why somebody is not doing something about this.
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:03.040]  Do it.
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:04.040]  There are elections coming up.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:05.040]  Do it.
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:06.040]  And we have the names.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:07.040]  We're going to publish it on our website.
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.040]  Sure.
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:09.040]  We're about to go to Breit.
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:12.040]  It shows how arrogant the globalists were in Hillary.
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:16.040]  She thought she was going to get back into office, use the whole Russian narrative on Trump.
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:18.040]  Owen's going to leave us when we come back.
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:20.040]  I want to follow this, Owen.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:21.040]  Can I give a final statement?
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:25.040]  It was a peaceful streets project, not safe streets project.
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:27.040]  It was a peaceful streets project.
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:28.040]  That's Joshua Pineda.
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:29.040]  I just wanted to correct that.
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:32.040]  Oh, let's do five more minutes and then I'm going to come back after that and get into
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:36.040]  not just Gulan, but the Clinton Foundation with the top expert on all this.
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:38.040]  Sabelle Edmond straight ahead.
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:43.040]  Third hour, please spread the word.

[02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:16.040]  Oh and I wanted to hold you over.
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:21.040]  Sebel Edmonds, a consummate whistleblower, great patriot, a former FBI translator with the NSA,
[02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:25.040]  transcripts exposing what really happened on 9-11, just a key person.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:29.040]  And we're going to cover a more big picture, your take on the foundation and stuff next segment.
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:34.040]  And then also open the phones up, toll free number if you'd like to be able to talk to Sebel.
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:40.040]  It's 877-789-ALOX, that's 877-789-2539.
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:44.040]  Owen will be gone when he's specifically talking about the foundations, the NSA,
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:49.040]  the funding of radical Islam by the globalist arm that the Clinton Foundation is a big part of
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:52.040]  and where these networks are today and how we stopped them.
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:55.040]  Again, I didn't even know what Goulon Networks were.
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:58.040]  I'd heard about it like 10 years ago, 5 years ago, knew about it.
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:02.040]  But thought, oh, just some peaceful little thing and then I learned about the Clintons, all of it.
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:06.040]  Sebel's a really well researched person and a lot of what she talked about I've seen in the news.
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.040]  Some of it I haven't.
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:10.040]  Except all of you out there to go research this information for yourself.
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:15.040]  But what we do know is they were brought in by the Clintons as part of this larger network that needs to be looked at.
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:21.040]  But you were raising points about Fusion GPS, Owen, and the same guy that's involved in that.
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:28.040]  So we're starting to connect some of the dots and find the web here of connections
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:33.040]  between the Obama administration, the Clintons, and the deep state.
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:36.040]  And Bruce Orr's, well, he was demoted.
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:38.040]  He technically wasn't fired from the DOJ.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.040]  He was demoted.
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:44.040]  He was on an extreme amount of these different boards or committees or what have you.
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:46.040]  But regardless, he gets demoted.
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:55.040]  Now, what's key about Bruce Orr is that Bruce Orr is an individual from the DOJ who met with Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS.
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:03.040]  And he also met with Christopher Steele who doctored or made up the Russian Trump dossier.
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:07.040]  The fake news that got spread that only Buzzfeed would pick up after everyone.
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:12.040]  I mean, this is so sensational how staged all this is and how they've been caught.
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:14.040]  So here's the connection that Bruce Orr has, though.
[02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:18.040]  So not only was Bruce Orr meeting with those two people, maybe that's okay.
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:19.040]  Maybe it's not.
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:20.040]  We don't really know.
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:24.040]  But he was also meeting with Barack Obama in the White House regularly.
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:30.040]  So again, is this just regular activity that Bruce Orr is doing or is there something else?
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:33.040]  I mean, we have all of these investigations into collusion, right?
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:35.040]  Okay, well, how about some collusion there?
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:36.040]  I mean, we've got the names.
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:37.040]  We know what they did.
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:39.040]  The dossier is fake.
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:41.040]  So there's some collusion right there.
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:43.040]  So is that why Bruce Orr was demoted?
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:45.040]  Well, of course it was.
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:48.040]  And that's why all the rest of these people, they've been caught.
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:54.040]  This is such a giant scandal where they've been caught accusing Trump and all of us for what they...
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:57.040]  I mean, they call me a Russian agent, Rand Paul a Russian agent.
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:58.040]  Tucker Carlson.
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:00.040]  This is ridiculous.
[02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:03.040]  Yeah, Trump has sanctions on Russia right now.
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:06.040]  By the way, I mean, you were there, you talked about narcotics trafficking,
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:11.040]  trafficking in children, all this classified stuff you're not supposed to get into that you told Congress that you were hearing.
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:15.040]  I know the Russians were one of the first to help us up in 9-11 with air bases and all the rest of it.
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:19.040]  From your research, what was the Russian dirt, if any?
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:23.040]  For what, while I was working for the FBI?
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:33.040]  No, actually, the FBI's largest translation division used to be Russian language during the whole Soviet Union.
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:37.040]  But afterwards, I have to tell you this, there was basically nothing.
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:42.040]  I mean, they had to let a lot of people go because there was not much happening.
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:47.040]  What was happening was mostly from our sides because we were engaged in this competition
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:52.040]  of who was going to get the control of the resources in Central Asia caucuses.
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:55.040]  You know, with Saudi Arabia oil has a deadline of what?
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:58.040]  Another 15, 20 years, there won't be any oil there.
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:03:59.040]  So the attention...
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:03.040]  Sure, and Russia appeared to back the U.S. in that energy grab.
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:06.040]  So how have they been rewarded now? It's crazy.
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:09.040]  Well, it was crazy back then.
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:12.040]  I mean, was it Putin at that time trying to work with Bush?
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:14.040]  Well, what happened was this, though.
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:21.040]  We had the deep state here who were organizing, arming, training these terror cells.
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.040]  So then attack the Russian crescent.
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:26.040]  And that, again, started during Bill Clinton's administration.
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:30.040]  Well, let's come back. I was going to leave you to follow that criminal report on Antifa.
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:32.040]  But let's talk big picture. You're a genius at this.
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:34.040]  But I mean, I study what the Russians have done.
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:38.040]  I mean, literally, they tried to come into the West and just go, let's do business.
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:41.040]  And they said, no, here's a bunch of terrorists going to blow you up. How's that sound?
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:44.040]  That's exactly what we did. In the 1990s, that's what we did.
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:48.040]  And then they blamed the Russians for all this. It's just unbelievable.
[02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:51.040]  I mean, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:54.040]  Mike and Arizona are on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:57.040]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[02:04:57.040 --> 02:05:01.040]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:07.040]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:12.040]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force,
[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:16.040]  AnthroPlex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:17.040]  Thank you.
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:22.040]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the SuperBlue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:27.040]  The SuperBlue is awesome. And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars life products.
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:30.040]  They are quality. I can't wait to get some more.
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:33.040]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:34.040]  Absolutely.
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:39.040]  And we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women,
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:41.040]  understand that there's bigger problems going on.
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:45.040]  And if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves,
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:06:13.040]  we can take our country back.
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:17.040]  The first three theories were first spread by Radio Talk Show host Alex Jones.
[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:22.040]  But to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it,
[02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:25.040]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:27.040]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:29.040]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:31.040]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:33.040]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:35.040]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:37.040]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:39.040]  Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:44.040]  He's a leader of a team of news organizations.
[02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:47.040]  And at that point, somebody decides to win a scroll past that and go find Alex Jones.
[02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:49.040]  So they were looking for him to be with anyone.
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:51.040]  That man is a threat to this country.
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:53.040]  There's a guy on the radio.
[02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:54.040]  His name is Alex Jones.
[02:06:54.040 --> 02:06:55.040]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:59.040]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:01.040]  Time to stop submitting in this charity.
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:03.040]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved.
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:05.040]  I heard that on Alex Jones.
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:07.040]  InfoWars went even further.
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:09.040]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:11.040]  We are in an information war.
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.040]  And we are losing that war.
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:15.040]  Nobody can dispute the fact.
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:17.040]  At your own risk.
[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:20.040]  InfoWars.com.
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:21.040]  InfoWars comes tomorrow.
[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:22.040]  InfoWars.
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.040]  InfoWars.
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:25.040]  Right now, the war is the InfoWars.
[02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:26.040]  You watch InfoWars?
[02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:28.040]  InfoWars.com.
[02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:30.040]  InfoWars.com.
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:31.040]  I got a chair going.
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:35.040]  Looking at widely reported information from InfoWars.
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:36.040]  InfoWars.
[02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:37.040]  InfoWars.
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:38.040]  InfoWars.com.
[02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:39.040]  I want freedom.
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:40.040]  That's what I want.
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:42.040]  And that's what you should want.
[02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:45.040]  Hello, this is Hank Hill.
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:47.040]  And I'm telling you what.
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:49.040]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:51.040]  If you are receiving this transmission.
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:53.040]  You are the resistance.
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:06.040]  On her way to work one morning.
[02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:09.040]  Down the path along the lake.
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:11.040]  A tenderhearted woman.
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:15.040]  Saw a poor half frozen snake.
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:17.040]  His pretty colored skin.
[02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:20.040]  Had been all frosted with a dew.
[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:22.040]  Oh well, she cried.
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:23.040]  I'll take you in.
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:25.040]  And I'll take care of you.
[02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:28.040]  Take me in, otender woman.
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:30.040]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:32.040]  Take me in, otender woman.
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:34.040]  Side.
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:36.040]  The vicious snake.
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:42.040]  This could be the great Trojan horse of all time.
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:44.040]  Because you look at the migration.
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:45.040]  Study it.
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:46.040]  Look at it.
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:49.040]  Now they'll start infiltrating with women and children.
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:52.040]  Take me in, otender woman.
[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:54.040]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:56.040]  Take me in, otender woman.
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:58.040]  Side.
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:00.040]  The vicious snake.
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:03.040]  Now she clutched him to her bosom.
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:06.040]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:08.040]  But if I hadn't brought you in.
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:11.040]  By now, you might have died.
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:14.040]  She stroked his pretty skin.
[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:17.040]  And then she kissed and held him tight.
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:21.040]  But instead of saying thank you.
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:25.040]  That snake gave her a vicious bite.
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:28.040]  I saved you, cried the woman.
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:30.040]  And you've bit me.
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:32.040]  Heaven's wide.
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:34.040]  You know your bite is poisonous.
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:37.040]  And now I'm going to die.
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:40.040]  Oh shut up, silly woman.
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:42.040]  Said the reptile with a grin.
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:46.040]  You knew damn well I was a snake.
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:51.040]  Before you took me in.
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:58.040]  I don't want to just sit here and go along with the neocon clash of civilizations.
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:01.040]  Where they fund radical Islam that he stabilized the area.
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:03.040]  And then they use that as a pretext for us to be in the area.
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:06.040]  But then also flood Europe with the radical Islamists to use that
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:09.040]  to bring in a police state on top of it.
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:12.040]  And then you went to the top of the HEBONs.
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:15.040]  One of the top whistleblowers ever from the FBI.
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:17.040]  And of course with NSA intercepts.
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:19.040]  Testified secretly to Congress.
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:22.040]  Broke gag orders later to expose.
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:24.040]  So much of now that's all been confirmed.
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:27.040]  She's here in town and we'll speak tomorrow about the Goulon network.
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:29.040]  This is a short segment time we have left.
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:31.040]  Long segment coming up.
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:33.040]  Takes some of your phone calls.
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:34.040]  Next segment.
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:38.040]  But just about you were getting into the whole geopolitical about Russia as a
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:40.840]  And you were saying, no, and that's just a fact.
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:43.520]  And then why did Russia come to our aid after 9-11?
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:45.720]  Like, hey, okay, come take the resources in the area.
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:47.600]  And then it seemed like they were just trying to work
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:49.440]  with the US over and over again,
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:51.880]  but being double-crossed with the globalists and Serbia
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:54.480]  and other areas using the very radical Islamists
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:56.920]  that they were backing through these networks
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:59.320]  from the Clinton Foundation to attack and destabilize.
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:00.160]  It's so clear.
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:03.800]  And it looks like Trump is now ending that double deal
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:05.760]  and is trying to roll up a lot of these groups
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:07.240]  at least to a certain extent.
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:11.520]  Can you give your expert geopolitical analysis of that?
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:12.360]  Absolutely.
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:16.120]  I really hope what you're predicting is accurate.
[02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:19.760]  That would be if the CIA is truly on board
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:22.880]  of not pursuing these terror policies
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:25.720]  all over the former Soviet Union states,
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:28.600]  such as those in Central Asia and Caucasus,
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:30.760]  because that's exactly what we did.
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:34.960]  In 1990s, we created, and this was United States
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:37.960]  together with some European nations and NATO.
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:41.800]  We said what we want to do is we want to break up
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:43.200]  Russia further.
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:47.480]  So we started funding, training, okay,
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:51.680]  arming various minority factions
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:53.600]  within even Russia's own mainland.
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:57.640]  For example, the regions of Dagestan, Chechnya,
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:11:59.960]  and believe me or not, in 1990s,
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:03.120]  the headquarter for this training used to be in Turkey.
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:06.480]  In fact, the Chechen leader's office headquarters
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:08.200]  was in Ankara, and this was official,
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:10.200]  not like a secret office.
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:12.640]  That's where they received all the funding
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:15.200]  from the United States, from NATO,
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:17.840]  and they armed these Chechen groups to go
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:20.520]  and blow up schools, little babies,
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:22.880]  little children in Russia, okay?
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:27.880]  And to basically do all the things that we are accusing
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:31.520]  ISIS be doing or al-Qaeda, we were training them.
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:33.960]  But it backfired, it only made a strong leader
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:36.920]  come to the fore and finally unified the Russians.
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:39.080]  Well, to a certain degree, it did.
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:42.000]  And then some other countries, for example,
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:46.040]  Azerbaijan, their candidacy for NATO membership
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:47.440]  was approved, okay?
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:49.840]  So it was, who was gonna get aligned
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:52.920]  with who kind of dynamics we got to see
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:56.600]  in late 1990s, in early 2000s?
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:00.520]  But you are right, it is falling apart.
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:02.520]  That whole plan is falling apart.
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:05.160]  You even have some Eastern European countries
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:08.080]  who are saying, we have had it.
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:09.960]  We don't wanna be on this camp.
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:11.320]  And guess what?
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:14.120]  One of our newest addition to our team at Newsbot
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:16.400]  is William Engel, okay?
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:20.200]  He exposed Soros network, okay, in Hungary.
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:22.440]  And you know what happened in Hungary?
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:25.400]  They banned all Soros organizations,
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:27.400]  offices, networks, complete.
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:28.640]  I was about to say, they're not being driven
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:30.520]  by the hands of Russia either.
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:32.400]  They're becoming their own sovereign countries
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:33.800]  with the libertarian reboot.
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:35.880]  I've got to brag, a lot of our information
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:38.680]  is at the presidential level there.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:40.840]  And shows like this are helping everybody
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:42.400]  become decompartmentalized.
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:44.600]  Absolutely right, it's having a domino effect.
[02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:47.360]  For example, with this attempted coup in Turkey,
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:48.960]  one of the first things they did,
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:51.960]  the Turkish government, they shut down Soros foundations.
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:53.960]  You know how many organizational offices
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:58.720]  France Soros has in Turkey with supporting Q-Land's network?
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:01.360]  So Turkey said, we're not gonna do this,
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:03.000]  if we are seeing it happening.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.480]  But you know what they are doing?
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:07.360]  The mainstream media here and in Europe, right?
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:08.960]  They are doing the same thing.
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:12.440]  Anybody who is nationalistic, they want their own sovereignty
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:16.360]  is being accused of being neo-Nazi fascist.
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:19.000]  And what we've got is, what we've got is multinational
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.840]  networks using Western intelligence agencies
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:23.080]  to carry out their own operations.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:25.400]  Removing this is our patriotic duty.
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:28.480]  And you notice, all these states aren't going Russian
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:31.480]  or they're going Americana libertarian.
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:32.880]  They like Ron Paul.
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:33.880]  They like Donald Trump.
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:35.520]  They like Alex Jones.
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:37.280]  They like Putin as they see him as a nationalist
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:38.120]  and a Christian.
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:40.640]  And that's all this is, is the return of the nation state
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:41.800]  and we should celebrate it.
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:44.800]  Look, you popularize a term, New World Order, right?
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:46.640]  Then nobody was talking about it.
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:50.400]  Well, it was there was this awakening for them.
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:52.720]  I was talking to this reporter in Greece
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:54.920]  and he said, we are trying to get rid
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:57.440]  of Soros foundations over here as well.
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:14:58.600]  We want to be Greece.
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:02.280]  We don't want to be some kind of a dot within the EU map.
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:04.640]  We don't want to be part of this global corporate
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:07.160]  domination that isn't American run.
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:08.320]  We just pay for it.
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:09.640]  That's what Trump understands.
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:12.840]  But Alex, the deep state is not going to sit idle.
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:15.280]  What do you think is happening with this hoax
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:16.960]  called Russia gate?
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:20.120]  Because they are not sitting idle and I'm afraid,
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:23.120]  there are still so many people within the CIA
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:28.120]  and the FBI, SES level people who are not supporting.
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:30.760]  They, they are doing the opposite.
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:33.240]  So, you know, like Turkish president Erdogan,
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:36.240]  I know he's being accused of being dictatorial.
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:37.080]  Hold on, finish.
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:38.040]  We got to go to break when come back.
[02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:38.880]  Let's get that.
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:40.920]  I promise a bunch of collars straight ahead.
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:41.760]  She's on fire.
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:42.600]  It's about Edmunds.

[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:07.760]  and that really is a great way to deal

[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:11.640]  It might seem like a simple thing,
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:14.160]  but they're particularly these slogan t-shirts
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:17.480]  that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:18.320]  Well, thank you.

[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:23.200]  but said it says won't tread on me
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:25.800]  and it's a big Daeglo snake, Gadsden snake,
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:27.160]  and then it's got the American flag,
[02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:29.080]  infowars.com on the right arm.

[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:25.880]  in the heart of the resistance,
[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:27.800]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:32.240]  See, Bill Evans is with us for only one more segment.
[02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:35.000]  She's speaking to Mara, you can find out at newsbud.com
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.240]  right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:37.560]  Auntie Fuzz has been threatening her,
[02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:38.760]  telling her not to come, not to speak,
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:40.400]  but she's gonna do it.
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:42.480]  Just, we've got Nick, Mark, and a bunch of other colleagues
[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:43.720]  I'm gonna try to go to in just a moment.
[02:20:43.720 --> 02:20:44.800]  But you were saying you had one other point
[02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:45.880]  you wanted to make.
[02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:48.280]  Yes, it's very interesting.
[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:50.360]  And in a way, it is disheartening
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:53.040]  how polarized our country has become.
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:56.560]  And I know mainstream media has played a major role
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:58.480]  because it's by design.
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:01.160]  It is this divide and conquerors by design.
[02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:04.400]  I mean, we just talked about the new American jihadis,
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:05.720]  the Antifa group.
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:07.880]  But do you see mainstream media covering them?
[02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:09.280]  No.
[02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:12.360]  I have had people actually issuing threats
[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:16.160]  because I came on your show, it was a couple of weeks ago.
[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:19.720]  Emails, actually, I had some members of our community,
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:23.600]  subscribers who said, you are going on info wars.
[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:26.080]  That means you have become, this is me, okay?
[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:30.000]  You have become the neo-Nazi skinhead, right wing.
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.040]  I mean, they called all sorts of names,
[02:21:32.040 --> 02:21:35.360]  but you know what, for every 20 I lost, I gained 40.
[02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:38.040]  It's not about that, but I would like to go on record.
[02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:39.920]  Well, you said it's a new climate of intimidation.
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:43.280]  We have been, you have had me the first time,
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:45.040]  it was 2005, 2006.
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:47.400]  And this was when I had the gag orders,
[02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:51.160]  nobody in mainstream media, nobody was willing to touch.
[02:21:51.160 --> 02:21:53.200]  Nobody was willing to touch me.
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:54.440]  Okay, guess what?
[02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:57.200]  My case was covered through your channel.
[02:21:57.200 --> 02:21:59.200]  And I greatly appreciated that, okay?
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:00.800]  And it helps it break out and get really big.
[02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:02.800]  But you know what I appreciated the most?
[02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:05.640]  There were some so-called media outlets
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:08.080]  during Bush administration, and they were liberal,
[02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:11.360]  and just to get back at Republicans they had me on.
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:13.880]  The moment Obama administration came on,
[02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:17.000]  and I started independently criticizing Obama,
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.520]  I was a whistleblower during Bush administration,
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:22.600]  I started criticizing Obama administration, okay?
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:24.320]  The man who broke so many laws,
[02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:27.720]  but he got Nobel Peace Prize, transparency award,
[02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:30.560]  the only president who jailed whistleblowers.
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:33.240]  But what I'm saying is you covered our whistleblowers
[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:36.640]  because my organization has 150 national security
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:39.360]  whistleblowers, NSA, FBI, DEA,
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:41.960]  you always provided platform for them,
[02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:44.040]  saying, yes, I'll have you on my guest,
[02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:46.200]  whether it was during the Obama administration
[02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:47.840]  or Bush administration,
[02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:51.040]  or right now during Trump administration.
[02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:55.080]  This is unheard of because what you get is,
[02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:57.680]  people like Amy Goodman, democracy now,
[02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:00.000]  they had me on their show during Bush administration,
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:03.280]  I became caca, I became the real pariah
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:05.440]  when it came to Obama administration,
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:09.600]  I was officially banned from outlets like
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:13.760]  democracy now, because this is what they do,
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:16.480]  is divide and conquer, but I have to say,
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:18.920]  I do appreciate the job you're doing here,
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:22.040]  your great team is doing here with Infowars,
[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:24.080]  because no matter who the administration,
[02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:26.440]  no matter which party the majority,
[02:23:26.440 --> 02:23:29.360]  you have given us the whistleblowers, a platform.
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:30.680]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:23:30.680 --> 02:23:32.240]  And that includes David as well,
[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:33.200]  I have to give a shout.
[02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:34.160]  David Knight's awesome.
[02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:36.000]  David Knight has been making it.
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:36.840]  You know what I really think?
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:39.080]  It's the listeners, and it's the folks that support us,
[02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:40.880]  and the affiliates, the people that have gone through this
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:42.480]  with us, because here's the thing,
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:43.880]  we're really seeking the truth,
[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:46.480]  and I know before we go after Gulon like this,
[02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:48.480]  that they're dangerous, they're powerful,
[02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:50.160]  it's a Clinton Foundation cut out,
[02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:52.040]  I understand, in fact, that's why it's so serious
[02:23:52.040 --> 02:23:53.080]  here at the office behind the scenes,
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:55.360]  this is not, when we do this, when I had you on,
[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:57.080]  was a gag order, and they were saying they were gonna
[02:23:57.080 --> 02:23:58.960]  arrest people that interviewed you and arrest you,
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:00.520]  we did it, because I'm ready to go to prison
[02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:03.080]  for the truth, to expose, I mean, as you said,
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:06.160]  child kidnapping, trafficking, and I know we got callers,
[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:07.120]  I'm at the hold show for longer,
[02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:08.120]  I know you wanna go eat barbecue,
[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:09.120]  and I got another guest coming on,
[02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:10.680]  but I'll get to these callers,
[02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:13.280]  but they said they'll arrest you,
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:14.560]  we talk about the classified stuff,
[02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:15.560]  but so much has come out,
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:17.800]  but when we talk about international groups,
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:19.280]  rich guys on airplanes,
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:21.560]  trafficking mainly in little girls,
[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:25.000]  and young women, I mean, you confirmed to Congress
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.960]  in classified briefings that you're sitting there
[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:28.640]  at the FBI listening to this,
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:30.080]  I mean, I'm not putting your words in your mouth,
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:31.600]  I remember when you first were able to come on my show
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:32.440]  and talk about it.
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:35.240]  Yeah, I talked about, look, a Republican,
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:37.440]  Dennis Haster, the Speaker of the House,
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:40.880]  the fact that he was involved with these,
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.960]  you know, he was molesting little boys,
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:45.720]  those boys were given to him during his foreign trips
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:48.160]  as gifts, nine years, 10 years old,
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:50.320]  so it cuts across, you know, to a point.
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:52.640]  Exactly, no, no, and we were exposing it, then it's,
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:54.800]  That's what I'm saying, there is none part of this.
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:57.440]  I mean, you've got degrees in law enforcement, all of it.
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:00.320]  That's how they use this to compromise people.
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:03.000]  Oh, absolutely, oh, absolutely.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.720]  God, they can never compromise me with, I mean, with kids,
[02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:09.280]  a lot of, kids aren't good for sex, I mean, it's just,
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:10.520]  it's insane.
[02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:12.960]  It is insane, and believe me or not,
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:15.640]  there is this thing called, and I have to say this,
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:17.920]  even when during the Bush administration,
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:20.480]  I blew the whistle, I came on your show,
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:24.040]  I didn't get attacks from the right,
[02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:26.920]  even though it was a Republican president.
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:27.920]  The left are making their move,
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:28.760]  they're making their takeover move.
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:30.240]  No, no, it's like rabies.
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:32.200]  I have never seen anything like this
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:33.400]  during this Obama administration.
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:36.040]  They don't put coffee on me in the street.
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:38.200]  That's what I'm saying, it's the opposite.
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:40.280]  And they run up to, they run up to Owen and go,
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:42.920]  Nazi scum when he's never said a racist thing in his life,
[02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:44.400]  but that's their way to dehumanize you.
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:46.280]  They just want to be hateful trash,
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:47.120]  but explain to people.
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:49.560]  That's why I call them the American jihadists,
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:51.680]  that's what they have morphed into,
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:54.440]  and this is why a majority of our whistleblowers,
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:57.400]  even those people who were leaning that way,
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:25:59.280]  now they're considering themselves like me,
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:01.720]  more libertarian, you know, lower case L.
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:04.040]  I'm not a Republican, I'm not a Democrat,
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:05.120]  I am a libertarian.
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:06.720]  You're saying all the high level CIA
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:08.960]  and NSA whistleblowers, you've got highly decorated.
[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:10.800]  The legit ones, because you've got.
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:12.120]  They've gone from being,
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:14.920]  they've gone from being mainly a little more liberal
[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:16.200]  to being, hey, libertarian,
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:18.040]  the left's insanity has driven them to that.
[02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:19.240]  I'll give you an example.
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:21.520]  Okay, you have John Criacca, right?
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:25.720]  He went to jail under Obama administration, okay?
[02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:28.640]  The man who won the Transparency Award, okay?
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:30.440]  The Nobel Peace Prize winner,
[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:33.720]  he's the one who's for the first time jailed.
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:35.320]  How did they get the main line left,
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:36.960]  who used to be good about,
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:38.920]  used to be good about not wanting to have spying
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:40.480]  and not wanting to have torture.
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:42.040]  How did they become the ones that promoted?
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:44.320]  They'll go, oh look, Trump's just being honest
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:45.160]  that it's going on.
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:46.480]  I'm not saying I agree with that, I disagree,
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:47.320]  at least he's honest.
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:48.960]  He's being open, he's being open about it.
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:51.320]  It's not coming from both sides of his mouth,
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:52.880]  which you got from Obama.
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:56.040]  And to me, it still is the mind-boggling thing.
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:26:58.640]  That man gets to have Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:00.960]  That man gets to have Transparency Award.
[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:03.000]  I don't like the fact that Trump supports torture,
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.600]  but then it's like sickeningly refreshing
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:05.800]  that he just says it.
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:07.120]  He's not even hiding anything.
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:07.960]  That's right.
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:09.280]  Let's not hide it, let's have it.
[02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:11.680]  That's when we can have dialogue about it.
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:14.680]  The reason Trump says that is it's still going on.
[02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:15.640]  No, absolutely.
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:18.760]  So I really want to really express my appreciation
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:19.920]  for this great team.
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:23.480]  And on behalf of my whistleblowers, legit whistleblowers,
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:26.200]  yes, once in a while, sometimes you get some people
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:28.120]  who use the name whistleblowers,
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:30.520]  but they are propped by the deep state
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:33.440]  to give legitimacy to whatever it is they are promoting.
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:38.000]  So that's my appreciation of what Infowars has done
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:39.720]  and has done it consistently.
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:43.360]  As I said, three administrations and over how long
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:44.200]  has it been?
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:45.960]  I feel old now talking about it, Alex.
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:47.000]  Well, you're still very lovely.
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.240]  I'm not, I've gotten ugly.
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:49.560]  It's been 13, 14 years.
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:50.800]  Have it on there, 22 years.
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:53.000]  I've been interviewing you for a long, long time
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:54.880]  and you're doing a great job.
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:57.560]  And of course you're on, you write and run several sites.
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:27:58.400]  Which one's the best one?
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:27:59.240]  Newsbud?
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:00.080]  Newsbud.com.
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:04.080]  This is our own small alternative independent media.
[02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:07.440]  We don't get a single dollar from Soros
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:10.600]  or any foundations, the deep state foundations.
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:12.680]  By the way, you're not 501c3, are you?
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:13.520]  No.
[02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:14.360]  I love you.
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:15.640]  I'm sorry, I had to say that.
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:17.920]  See, if you want to have a soup house,
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:21.280]  you know, do some humanitarian stuff, do 501c3.
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:24.480]  But if you do it for a news organization
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:27.320]  who's a government watchdog, and if you're 501c3,
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:29.960]  BS, because that doesn't work.
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:31.480]  Because in order.
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:32.440]  By the way, I didn't get to the call
[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:33.280]  because you're so on fire.
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:35.560]  We have another guest to do a little bit more with us.
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:36.560]  So we get to these calls.
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:38.400]  It's a very important issue, Alex.
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:39.240]  Yes, it is.
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:42.240]  Because we are the so-called 501c3 news
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:43.080]  organization's government.
[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.120]  And they won't report the news.
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:45.080]  Of course they are not.
[02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:45.840]  Because they're government.
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:48.240]  Their factory status is tied up.
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:50.400]  Say it right there, we gotta go to break.
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:54.040]  Have you ever lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:55.560]  to get the lights back on?
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:58.680]  If so, pay close attention because huge discounts
[02:28:58.680 --> 02:29:01.000]  are now available in solar generators.
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:04.000]  Perfect for backup power outages and emergencies.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.840]  Portable solar generators provide life-saving electrical power
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:09.400]  when you need it most.
[02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:13.680]  And unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly,
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:16.400]  emits no dangerous fumes, and produces
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:19.240]  an endless supply of electricity from the sun.
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:22.240]  It's like having an electric power plant running secretly

[02:33:18.440 --> 02:33:25.440]  MUSIC
[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:30.440]  From the front lines of the Information War is Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:59.440]  MUSIC
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:02.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:04.440]  I am your host, Alex Jones,
[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:08.440]  and Aaron Klein, Breitbart.com Jerusalem editor,
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:11.440]  is joining us here in just a moment
[02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:13.440]  to not just talk about Trump basically
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:16.440]  officially recognizing Israel as a state.
[02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:18.440]  I mean, that's what this really is.
[02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:20.440]  This is just about the embassy,
[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:23.440]  and then we're also going to get into the Roy Moore situation.
[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:26.440]  He is right there just a few days off in the election,
[02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:29.440]  that special election, this big bellwether right there
[02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:31.440]  in Alabama tracking all of this.
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:35.440]  As you know, we were the first to predict here,
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:38.440]  ladies and gentlemen, that they were burning Weinstein
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:41.440]  and burning Kevin Spacey and all these people
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:44.440]  to build a wave to make it look like
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:46.440]  it's legitimate for Trump to stand down
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:48.440]  when there's no evidence.
[02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:50.440]  There is tons of evidence with the other men.
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:52.440]  Now, Democratic Party operatives have been admitting that.
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:54.440]  I have clips on CNN, MSNBC,
[02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:56.440]  we haven't even gotten to yet,
[02:34:56.440 --> 02:34:58.440]  but that ties into all of this.
[02:34:58.440 --> 02:35:02.440]  But before I go any further here today,
[02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:05.440]  I wanted to just briefly remind you
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:07.440]  that we're launching something called Christmas Week.
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:09.440]  Instead of having Green Monday,
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:11.440]  that they launch to be environmental, don't drive,
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:14.440]  don't fight the, you know, the mall crowds,
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:16.440]  which is a great idea, shop online.
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:18.440]  We'll shop online with patriots that are fighting
[02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:21.440]  to restore this republic and empower our economy
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:24.440]  and who promote freedom. And we have supplements,
[02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:26.440]  books, films, t-shirts,
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:29.440]  water filtration systems, so many incredible things
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:32.440]  available at infowarstore.com.

[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:55.440]  And many of these, like DNA Force, 33% off,

[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:00.440]  as well on the amazing properties they have.
[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:03.440]  You see how good our research is on politics in the world,
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:05.440]  how game-changing it is.

[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:23.440]  Infowarstore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:26.440]  And since the globalists hate anything traditionalist,
[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:27.440]  and want to get rid of everybody's cultures
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:29.440]  and just say the holidays, they don't want to hear Hanukkah,
[02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:30.440]  they don't want to hear Christmas,
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:32.440]  they don't want to hear any other thing either.
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:34.440]  It's just get rid of any culture.
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:36.440]  We're calling it Christmas week.
[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:38.440]  Huge sales are going to run throughout this week
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:40.440]  so you can be sure and order anytime up until the 19th
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:43.440]  and get delivered anywhere in the United States
[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:45.440]  before Christmas.
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:48.440]  That means places like Hawaii, you name it.
[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:51.440]  So again, joining us, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:55.440]  right now is the Breitbart.com Jerusalem editor,
[02:36:55.440 --> 02:36:58.440]  Aaron Klein, best-selling author, researcher.
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:00.440]  I'm not going to go over his whole lengthy bio.
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:02.440]  He's been with us before.
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:04.440]  Where do you want to begin?
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:07.440]  The situation in the Middle East, the latest terror attack today
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:09.440]  that Google's now censoring people,
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:11.440]  they're saying don't say it's Islamic,
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:14.440]  or do you want to get into the Roy Moore situation first?
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:16.440]  First of all, thanks for having me.
[02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:19.440]  Sure, we can talk about whatever you want.
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:22.440]  When it comes to Jerusalem, though, I'll tell you,
[02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:26.440]  I don't see why the Palestinian Authority
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:30.440]  and the Arab world seems to be going so crazy about this
[02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:34.440]  because it's not a game-changing development.
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:37.440]  What Donald Trump did was recognize reality,
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:40.440]  which is that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:44.440]  And then what you had were the usual who's-who-the-witches
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:49.440]  brew of jihadist organizations and then countries
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:52.440]  and Middle East leaders that use any excuse to incite
[02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:54.440]  against the United States and Israel,
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:57.440]  and they've been threatening basically Holy War,
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:37:58.440]  days of rage.
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:01.440]  Well, we haven't seen that much come out of it.
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:05.440]  The first day there were thousands of Palestinians on the street,
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:08.440]  second day hundreds of Palestinians on the street.
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:11.440]  Today, I think the numbers are a lot smaller.
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:16.440]  So it's not exactly the end of the world as the Palestinian Authority
[02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:18.440]  and the Muslim country is predicted.
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:23.440]  And also, by the way, it doesn't change that much on the ground.
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:26.440]  If the United States moves its embassy,
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:28.440]  and by the way, maybe in a year,
[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:32.440]  maybe four years depending on how long it takes to build an embassy,
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:36.440]  that doesn't preclude the Palestinians getting in the future,
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:40.440]  and I don't think they should, but getting some sort of entity
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:43.440]  or capital in Jerusalem as well.
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:49.440]  And also, by the way, I don't get why-how it is that
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:52.440]  Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president,
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:56.440]  can get away with saying that this is the United States
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:38:59.440]  withdrawing from the so-called peace process,
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:02.440]  because I'm sorry, but I know history
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:04.440]  and what I've seen time and again
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:08.440]  is actually the Palestinians being offered, I think, a state
[02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:12.440]  six times, seven times, in 2000, 2001, 2008.
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:14.440]  Well, I was about to say, you know,
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:17.440]  I've been criticized for not being pro-Israel enough,
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:21.440]  and I've been criticized for being a supposedly agent by the left,
[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:23.440]  but now they just say you're a Nazi.
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:25.440]  Now they say Trump's a Nazi, Nanyahu's a Nazi.
[02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:30.440]  Of course, the images don't really work with it being a Jewish country.
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:34.440]  And this just goes on and on and on.
[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:36.440]  And exactly the more you appease the Palestinians,
[02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:39.440]  the more they attack, and Saudi Arabia won't take them,
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:41.440]  Jordan won't take them, Egypt won't take them,
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:44.440]  and then you've got all these people running around like
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:46.440]  Linda Sorcerer, everybody else who just says,
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:49.440]  push Israel into the ocean, and then Trump just says,
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:51.440]  we're already having our meetings in Jerusalem.
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:53.440]  We passed the law decades ago saying we're going to do it,
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:54.440]  we're going to do it.
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:55.440]  It's reality.
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:56.440]  You're already blowing us up.
[02:39:56.440 --> 02:39:58.440]  You know, the terror group said, we're going to blow you up
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:01.440]  if you move your embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:04.440]  and they said, but we're going to blow you up if you don't.
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:06.440]  So I just say, you know, it's reality.
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:07.440]  Here's the gauntlet.
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:09.440]  Kissing your butts hasn't worked,
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:11.440]  and you need to now come to the table and be realistic.
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:14.440]  Just like you said, I know the word is Trump behind the scenes.
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:15.440]  You probably have intel on this.
[02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:17.440]  It's actually working on a pretty good deal,
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:19.440]  trying to work with Israel and work with the Palestinians
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:21.440]  if they would just be realistic.
[02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:24.440]  I'm being told there's some pretty big concessions behind the scenes
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:27.440]  that Netanyahu and others have been talking about doing.
[02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:30.440]  If the Palestinians are realistic and stop saying,
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:32.440]  we're going to push Israel into the ocean.
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:33.440]  They have to stop doing it.
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:36.440]  They have to say Israel has a right to be there in those areas
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:40.440]  and then share power if people are reasonable.
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:44.440]  Well, you know, we've tried the same exact formula for decades,
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:46.440]  which is the two-state solution.
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:48.440]  Which, by the way, I just don't like these terms.
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:51.440]  Like, two-state solution almost sounds like the final solution.
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:55.440]  But, you know, two-state solution would be stated for Israel
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:57.440]  on the one hand, which is a democracy,
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:40:59.440]  and then a state for the Palestinians on the other hand,
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:05.440]  while they support terror and refuse to recognize the existence of Israel.
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:08.440]  So, we've tried it, though, for decades.
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:11.440]  And what has happened is that every single time,
[02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:14.440]  this is, it's an exact mathematical equation.
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:18.440]  100% of the time that the Palestinians have been offered a state,
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:21.440]  including on everything they ever said they wanted,
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:25.440]  Gaza Strip, West Bank, Eastern sections of Jerusalem,
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:30.440]  100% of the time they not only rejected the state with no counteroffers,
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:33.440]  but instead they launched violence, they launched into photos.
[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:38.440]  And so now, Abbas right now is in a unity deal with Hamas.
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:42.440]  In other words, the Palestinian government is a terrorist government outright.
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:44.440]  They're in a partnership with Hamas.
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:48.440]  So, that kind of outs the Palestinian Authority for what they are.
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:51.440]  That being said, first of all, because of Iran,
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:57.440]  because of the rise of the Iranian CIA access throughout the Middle East,
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:01.440]  what you have now are the Sunnis, meaning, especially Saudi Arabia,
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:04.440]  and Qatar, and Kuwait, and the UAE,
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:06.440]  and those who have the Sunni Arab world.
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:11.440]  They hate Iran so much, and they are so threatened by Iran
[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:15.440]  and by Barack Obama's nuclear deal with the Iranians
[02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:20.440]  that they now understand that they need to create a coalition, an alliance,
[02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:23.440]  and then at the center of that coalition is Israel,
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:25.440]  the mightiest military in the Middle East.
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:29.440]  And so actually there happens to be a pretty unique opportunity,
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:35.440]  I think even historic, because the tectonic plates have shifted so dramatically
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:39.440]  in the last few years with Iran taking over in Syria and other places,
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:42.440]  that actually the Saudis won.
[02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:45.440]  I wouldn't say they want peace with Israel, but they understand.
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:47.440]  Stay there, Aaron Klein. This is riveting.
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:43:16.440]  We'll be right back and we'll talk more.
[02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:39.440]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:55.440]  I'm so excited. The new product at InfoWarsLife.com, in a glass bottle,
[02:43:55.440 --> 02:44:01.440]  two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:05.440]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic,
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:07.440]  but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:10.440]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:16.440]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[02:44:16.440 --> 02:44:22.440]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:26.440]  And I came up with our own formulae working with scientists and developers.
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:31.440]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:34.440]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:38.440]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:40.440]  to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:43.440]  It is amazing.
[02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:48.440]  Red pill now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase of the operation.

[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:24.440]  That's been Crosby. Every time I play this song, I'm going to tell you, five years ago,
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:28.440]  I first heard they wanted to ban it. They have banned it on most college campuses.
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:33.440]  They've banned a bunch of others. This is the total mind control going on.
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:38.440]  And again, I just remember the years, because I didn't want to get in the middle of the Israel-Palestinian thing.
[02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:42.440]  To me, that's overseas. It's kind of like a Ron Paul guy. I just say, stay out of this.
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:48.440]  Oh, I don't hate the Muslims. Don't hate Israel. And then I would just get bullied online.
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:53.440]  And by leftist publications going, Jones hates Muslims. Jones is a racist.
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:56.440]  Jones is probably on the payroll of Israel. Never been to Israel.
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:02.440]  And it was actually their bullying trying to make me be anti-Israel.
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:05.440]  They made me study it more and become pro-Israel.
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:09.440]  So good luck with all of that bullying that's going on.
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:16.440]  And now it's just fever, crazy town level, and how dare Israel even exist.
[02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:22.440]  Oh, my gosh. And on and on and on. The media, oh, Israel ever shoots back and kills somebody.
[02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:28.440]  Oh, they're murderers. But then when I watched the Islamic Spring and all this stuff, the Arab Spring,
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:33.440]  murdering over a million people, killing Christians, blowing up over a thousand churches in four countries,
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:36.440]  selling women to sex slavery, the media would have Anderson Cooper going,
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:40.440]  look, they're liberating Egypt. They're liberating Libya. They're liberating Syria.
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:44.440]  But thank God our military, the Russians, Trump, everybody else said,
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:50.440]  we're not going to be part of this anymore. And so as the editor for Breitbart Jerusalem,
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:54.440]  Aaron Klein, best-selling author, talk show host, you name it, was just saying, we just tuned in.
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:49:00.440]  Now finally, because of Trump and the leadership and how out of control Iran's gotten,
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:04.440]  Saudi Arabia and others are going, OK, we're going to stop funding both sides.
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:07.440]  We want to fix this and have a peace deal. So Aaron, you got caught up with the break.
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:13.440]  You said the planets have aligned, basically, or the tectonic plates have aligned finally for some big deal.
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:17.440]  What's the word? Is anything leaking out of the Knesset?
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:19.440]  Because Trump says he wants this big deal in Israel.
[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:25.440]  And my sources say Trump is working Kushner and others on some really big deal that if the Palestinians,
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:30.440]  you'll just accept it, they're going to really get a place at the table, industry, jobs, infrastructure,
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:33.440]  but they can't have terrorists as their leaders.
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:40.440]  You know, to me, what I'm hearing is that the big deal, quote unquote, is more Israel and the Arab world.
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:45.440]  Because, as I said before the break, because the Arab world now is so aligned against Iran,
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:49.440]  they're actually willing to come to an accommodation. In fact, they want it.
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:55.440]  They also want it for their economy because Israel is the high-tech leader of the world.
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:49:59.440]  In fact, a lot of the major high-tech firms are based not just in Silicon Valley.
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:01.440]  They have a satellite office in Israel.
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:06.440]  But because of Iran, basically, the deal that I'm hearing is something larger.
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:08.440]  Israel, the Saudis, the UAE.
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:15.440]  And so you have the larger Arab countries that are now trying to pressure the Palestinian Authority,
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:20.440]  which has rejected every deal until now and is in a unity deal with Hamas, to accept something.
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:26.440]  And, you know, what you were just saying before about the left in America attacking you and the issue of Israel,
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:30.440]  it's actually connected in many ways to what's going on here in Alabama,
[02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:37.440]  because it's the same mentality and certainly what's going on with all the sex assault accusations around the country.
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:45.440]  And that is, we're supposed to believe suddenly, after decades of the media, of the Democrat Party,
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:52.440]  and sometimes the establishment Republicans, not just defending a rapist president,
[02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:59.440]  but covering up for him and then actively smearing the very credible accusers of Bill Clinton,
[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:03.440]  like Juanita Broderick, who I have interviewed several times.
[02:51:03.440 --> 02:51:08.440]  I interviewed, by the way, the nurse who found her immediately after she says Bill Clinton.
[02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:10.440]  Absolutely happened. He settled a bunch of them.
[02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:17.440]  You got Fusion GPS caught with the Epstein made up stuff, Bill Clinton, so they could try to blame Trump,
[02:51:17.440 --> 02:51:19.440]  but they'll cover up for him exactly.
[02:51:19.440 --> 02:51:24.440]  They clearly are getting rid of Deadwood, people they knew they couldn't cover up for anymore,
[02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:32.440]  and due to build this whole momentum as if, well, now, Trump's got to step down when there's no evidence of it.
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:37.440]  It's completely transparent. So what do you think's about to happen with more in this special election, Aaron Klein?
[02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:42.440]  Yes, so for his total Democrat hypocrisy, clearly what's going on here,
[02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:49.440]  covering up for Bill all these years, and now we're supposed to believe that they have a major issue with sex assault,
[02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:52.440]  and they're supporters of women, right?
[02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:57.440]  And actually the left in America kind of does the same thing, by the way, with Israel,
[02:51:57.440 --> 02:52:02.440]  where they claim they stand for women's rights, gay rights, and yet the one and only country in the entire Middle East
[02:52:02.440 --> 02:52:08.440]  that actually has women as equal citizens and Jews and Christians and Muslims,
[02:52:08.440 --> 02:52:11.440]  and everyone of every sexuality, that's the country they're attacking.
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:17.440]  But here in Alabama, I've been here for over a month, actually,
[02:52:17.440 --> 02:52:20.440]  way before almost any other member of the national news media.
[02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:22.440]  In fact, I think that was the first.
[02:52:22.440 --> 02:52:28.440]  I was about to say, I remember reading, I mean, you got there almost before the scandal even broke.
[02:52:28.440 --> 02:52:31.440]  Yeah, by the way, separately, I wasn't even here for this scandal.
[02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:38.440]  I came to just investigate Doug Jones and his radical left ties that I started to document, and then the scandal broke out.
[02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:45.440]  So I've been looking into, has somebody who vetted Bill Clinton's sexual assault accusers,
[02:52:45.440 --> 02:52:49.440]  if indeed there was something to these accusers, if they were credible,
[02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:53.440]  then I would be one of their greatest champions, I would be their defenders.
[02:52:53.440 --> 02:52:57.440]  I stand with sexual assault accusers if they're credible.
[02:52:57.440 --> 02:53:03.440]  But what I've been doing is just investigating the story, instead of what the media has been doing,
[02:53:03.440 --> 02:53:08.440]  which is ignoring major bomb shells about these women, and I'm finding that they're not credible.
[02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:11.440]  I was about to say, I should have said this up front.
[02:53:11.440 --> 02:53:16.440]  I know I read reports of yours and others at Breitbart first that that signature and stuff was fake.
[02:53:16.440 --> 02:53:20.440]  They said that you were all crazy. Now they have to admit it. How big is that?
[02:53:20.440 --> 02:53:25.440]  Yeah, by the way, that's just a total, an example of total journalistic malpractice.
[02:53:25.440 --> 02:53:30.440]  So she gets up there, we're talking about Beverly Nelson Young Nelson.
[02:53:30.440 --> 02:53:36.440]  She says that she was almost sexually assaulted. Roy Moore tried to sexually assault her in a car.
[02:53:36.440 --> 02:53:38.440]  She was 16 years old, 1977.
[02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:45.440]  And then her, she's up there with Gloria Allred, which are all the way, already should tell you, you know, something about her credibility.
[02:53:45.440 --> 02:53:54.440]  She shows a photo copy of a yearbook, not the original, but a photo copy of an inscription that she says that Roy Moore wrote.
[02:53:54.440 --> 02:53:58.440]  And then she read the whole thing and she said, outright, he wrote it.
[02:53:58.440 --> 02:54:08.440]  She didn't tell us, first of all, the media failed after this came out, the even report, that in 1999, Roy Moore assigned her a divorce document,
[02:54:08.440 --> 02:54:15.440]  actually stamped a divorce document. And then what happens is you would stamp it, a clerk would stamp it.
[02:54:15.440 --> 02:54:18.440]  After the signature, the clerk would then write her initials.
[02:54:18.440 --> 02:54:25.440]  And the initials of Roy Moore's clerk in the 1990s was D.A. Gilbert Adams.
[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:32.440]  Well, first, why didn't a young Nelson tell us that Roy Moore signed her divorce document? Pretty big.
[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:41.440]  But second, go back to the yearbook. You see, he's signing his name allegedly. And then right after the name are the initials D.A.
[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:46.440]  So, he claimed to us, well, he signed the initials D.A. because he was the district attorney.
[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:48.440]  He wasn't. He was the assistant D.A.
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:54.440]  And by the way, you said all this and you guys reported on it exclusively, basically, got attacked everywhere.
[02:54:54.440 --> 02:54:58.440]  You can see it's fake. You can see it's different cobbled together.
[02:54:58.440 --> 02:55:02.440]  It's a lifted signature put on there. And now she has to admit she wrote it.
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:06.440]  I mean, you can't listen to anything comes out of her mouth now.
[02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:15.440]  You can see if she wrote it. And by the way, just why would the initials clerks, clerks initials from two decades later.
[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:19.440]  Sure. So, it's not just her lying and signing his name. It's fraud then.
[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:24.440]  But if you actually lift government documents and then it's a forgery under law.
[02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:30.440]  Well, so we don't know what she wrote and what she didn't because she's just saying, well, she made notes after.
[02:55:30.440 --> 02:55:35.440]  Sure. Exactly. What I'm saying is if she lifted a government document, I don't know about Alabama law, but I know Texas law,
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:41.440]  if you get a public document and you use that to then forge something about somebody else for business or whatever,
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:46.440]  then it's fraud. It's bigger than just writing some BS in a book and saying, look, they did it.
[02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:51.440]  If you get somebody's documents and do it and use it against them, it really ups it.
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:55.440]  Listen, this is huge. I mean, first of all, there goes her credibility.
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:56:01.440]  Second, I interviewed her son, actually, her stepson, who says she's a liar.
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:08.440]  I interviewed her boyfriend at the time, who by the way, is now a minister who ministers also to sexual assault accusers.
[02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:11.440]  He says she's a liar, but she's just one. There's another one.
[02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:21.440]  She's a six-year-old. Her name's Tina Johnson. She claims, Tina, that when she was 26 in the 1990s, Roy Moore groped her.
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:29.440]  Well, I looked into Tina Johnson and the media didn't tell us, first of all, that she was in Roy Moore's office that day
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:35.440]  because she was being represented, sorry, her mother was being represented by Roy Moore,
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:42.440]  and the mother took Tina Johnson's child away from her, and it was a very nasty custody battle,
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:50.440]  one in which Roy Moore signed papers and filed papers calling Tina Johnson psychiatrically unstable,
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:53.440]  as saying that she's physically alive.
[02:56:53.440 --> 02:56:55.440]  I didn't even know this, and I've been reading a lot of your reports.
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:57:03.440]  Wow, so they had a direct beef with him for what he did as the DA to get back at him. Wow.
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:07.440]  He was, at the time, a private lawyer, and he represented her mother.
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:12.440]  She was in there that day to have her child taken away from her by Roy Moore's client.
[02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:14.440]  So huge. Why didn't the media tell us that?
[02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:19.440]  Sure, sure. I'm just thinking about, as a lawyer and a DA and a judge, how many enemies this guy's got to have.
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:24.440]  Like, I'm a public figure, and imagine if this was happening to me, people would just line up around the block to make it up.
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:29.440]  I know you got to go, but we're back in 70 seconds. Let's do five more minutes with Aaron Klein because, man,
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:35.440]  I mean, I knew there was a lot of scams and a lot of weird stuff going on, but I know it was this crazy.
[02:57:35.440 --> 02:58:00.440]  Wow. Judge Roy Moore, is he going to win?
[02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:17.440]  Yeah, you like the sound of that?

[02:58:44.440 --> 02:58:54.440]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of infores, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic,
[02:58:54.440 --> 02:59:06.440]  and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the infore. It might seem like a simple thing, but they particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[02:59:06.440 --> 02:59:17.440]  Well, thank you. My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me, and it's a big Daeglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, infores.com on the right arm.
[02:59:17.440 --> 02:59:24.440]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[02:59:24.440 --> 02:59:39.440]  And the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt, trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and an infores.com on the back. That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at inforesstore.com.
[02:59:54.440 --> 03:00:05.440]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear. He is Alex Jones.
[03:00:05.440 --> 03:00:28.440]  Man, I gotta tell you, I follow a lot of the Breitbart articles. We link to a lot of them at infores.com and newswords.com, and I just haven't had the time to read all of Aaron Klein's articles or so many.
[03:00:28.440 --> 03:00:39.440]  And I feel ashamed that I didn't even know a lot of these bombshells. I knew some of them. I knew he was the guy first they're reporting on the fact that Moore was saying that he didn't sign that and it's fake and all the rest of it.
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:50.440]  That's all been vindicated. And now he's hounding around finding all this out. You got the Democrats knowing the Clintons are dead weight with all their sex problems. You got all these other Hollywood people doing it.
[03:00:50.440 --> 03:01:00.440]  So they decided to go ahead and burn some of their own to have this moral superiority to then say, oh, Trump or other people are perverts like they are.
[03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:07.440]  I don't see it flying. They've had a lot of fake polls out just like they had against Trump over sampling Democrats and things, but you're there on the ground.
[03:01:07.440 --> 03:01:15.440]  Aaron Klein, do you think Roy Moore is going to get elected in the senatorial special elections to replace Senator Jeff Sessions?
[03:01:15.440 --> 03:01:25.440]  Well, you know, there's this Fox News shock poll that came out today claiming that he is only like 10 points behind. That's not what I'm feeling or hearing here.
[03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:35.440]  I mean, I've been here, like I said, for over a month, actually, and I make it a point wherever I go, gas stations, grocery stores, shopping malls, movie theaters.
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:41.440]  If I go into a bar, I talk to the bouncer. I talk to the bar, people inside the bar just to get a feel.
[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:43.440]  You've been canvassing Alabama.
[03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:49.440]  Oh, yeah, big time. And by the way, in different cities also because I've been all over the place here.
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:58.440]  And I'm finding the exact opposite of what this Fox News poll is alleging, and that is like overwhelming support for Roy Moore.
[03:01:58.440 --> 03:02:11.440]  In fact, because of the accusations, or at least because of the establishment war against him, the one thing that Alabamians here hate more than anything else is being told what to do.
[03:02:11.440 --> 03:02:19.440]  And they feel that Mitch McConnell, okay, 45 minutes after the Washington Post story comes out, suddenly Mitch McConnell calling for him to resign.
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:27.440]  The whole Republican establishment abandoning him, Democrat establishment, of course, pouring millions upon millions into this race.
[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:31.440]  So they kind of, they feel like they're being told what to do.
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:47.440]  And of course, when this election is about policy, it's about, at the end of the day, will the Trump agenda, which will touch every single American on all issues, immigration reform, economy, building the wall,
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:55.440]  maybe Obamacare repeal on their place, on and on it goes, that it's critical to have every single vote in the Senate, as we saw.
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:03:12.440]  Well, sure, also, most of this is 35, 40 years old. That's my issue is if there's never one bit of smoke before, like Bill Clinton, there's smoke, fire, explosions, flamethrowers, you know, burning hillsides like California when it comes to women being abused and girls and the rest of it.
[03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:22.440]  With Moore, there's nothing until now, even though he's been in office, a DA, a judge. I mean, this to me is now phony. We've had time to look at it. We've had time to vet it.
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:31.440]  And so, again, it goes back to fake polls. They were sampling nine to 15 to 20 points more for Democrats in all these fake polls saying Trump was going to lose.
[03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:38.440]  And it's the same story. I think most folks, you're going to answer the phone with some pollster calling Alabama saying, who are you going to vote for them?
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:44.440]  They've got picked Democrat households. They know they're calling for these fake polls. That's what I think.
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:55.440]  Well, you know, if this were anything but a media campaign, that they would tell us the truth. They would tell us what I reported, first of all, that one of the accusers at our child taken away from her by William Orr's client.
[03:03:55.440 --> 03:04:12.440]  They would tell us that that accuser, by the way, here's another one they ignored, was convicted. She is a felon for felony fraud against her own family to the point where actually her family member turned her in and she went to jail.
[03:04:12.440 --> 03:04:26.440]  Not exactly credible and a lot of issues with the other accusers. So it's clear there's something else going on because I've seen the way that the news media has ignored, has minimized these major stories.
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:36.440]  Erin Klein, amazing. Please join us soon in the aftermath of a special election that we're here. It's now. It's happening very, very soon and we'll be covering it all tomorrow, obviously.
[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:38.440]  Erin Klein, thank you so much.
[03:04:38.440 --> 03:04:43.440]  Thank you. We'll be back with Matt Dubio. I'm Ryton Shotgun. I'm Alex Jones.

[03:06:12.440 --> 03:06:20.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got to tell you, I love having Christmas trees in the studio and to me it's just pretty, you know, lights in the dark of the winter.
[03:06:20.440 --> 03:06:28.440]  That's why the ancient druids and Germanic tribes would bring evergreen trees in during the freezing winter because they believed it was powerful.
[03:06:28.440 --> 03:06:39.440]  Look, it lived in the subzero temperatures that killed them. It always stayed green. They liked the smell of it and they would put little lights and candles on it, literally praying to the sun god to bring the sun back.
[03:06:39.440 --> 03:06:54.440]  So I love how the atheists and occultists and I always see druids and wikens protesting Christmas and I'm just like, you know, and I don't think Jesus gets mad at us as Christians that we think tan and bombs are pretty.
[03:06:54.440 --> 03:06:58.440]  But I mean, if you want to get down to brass tacks, these are big old giant occult symbols in here.
[03:06:58.440 --> 03:07:08.440]  But you know, people say a rising sun behind the planets is symbol of the Illuminati or they say a star on the flag is, no, every symbol has been taken over by occultists.
[03:07:08.440 --> 03:07:19.440]  I like the symbol of a sun rising behind the planet. It's pretty. I, you know, I like Christmas trees. I like, you know, all of it, all of it has, you know, some type of cultural thing.
[03:07:19.440 --> 03:07:29.440]  It's not evil to culturally, you know, sit there and get a piece of mistletoe and have it be an excuse at a party drinking eggnog, you know, lace with rum or whatever.
[03:07:29.440 --> 03:07:39.440]  You know, like that girl and say, oh, everybody has to kiss under the mistletoe. And then it gives the girl, if she likes it, not harassment, the excuse to go under the mistletoe.
[03:07:39.440 --> 03:07:52.440]  You know, these are all rituals, you know, going on that people came up with. And again, the mistletoe was seen as an aphrodisiac and hallucinogen, a lot of other things by the druids and by those tribes.
[03:07:52.440 --> 03:08:04.440]  It just shows how the less trying to get rid of all this and when all it is is a mixture of, you know, Western European winter ritual with Christianity.
[03:08:04.440 --> 03:08:10.440]  People say, well, that's blasphemy. You're going to hell for that. God judges the heart. A pretty tree with lights on it.
[03:08:10.440 --> 03:08:18.440]  Now it's a Christian symbol. The leftists have really made it a Christian symbol because they've said it's Christian.
[03:08:18.440 --> 03:08:26.440]  And again, they're so politically wicked, they just want to dominate all symbols and say we want what you really like Christmas trees.
[03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:31.440]  You remember Grandma with Grandma put up a Christmas tree because she was a devil worshiper.
[03:08:31.440 --> 03:08:36.440]  She was putting up a Christmas tree because it was pretty. So that's what this comes down to.
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:55.440]  Matt Dubio. I like that studio with 1530 WCKG our big flagship there in Illinois. The next few weeks kind of a big announcement. It's not just not just the good old 1530, but also the 102.3 that covers much of the city, but it's about to cover it all.
[03:08:55.440 --> 03:09:02.440]  I'm going to leave it at that about fantastic radio station picking up Owen Shore in the war room, David Knight in the real news and so much more.
[03:09:02.440 --> 03:09:05.440]  So tell us my friend what you've got coming up today.
[03:09:05.440 --> 03:09:13.440]  Well, Alex, you know, they were afraid of mistletoe because when you have Joe Biden in the White House for eight years, you get really skittish around the mistletoe.
[03:09:13.440 --> 03:09:16.440]  It's a creepy Uncle Joe gets near the mistletoe.
[03:09:16.440 --> 03:09:18.440]  He's going to rape you under the mistletoe. Yeah.
[03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:19.440]  Watch out.
[03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:29.440]  Coming up, what do what is Chelsea Handler, Keith Oberman and Joy Behar all have in common with Buzz Aldrin.
[03:09:29.440 --> 03:09:48.440]  That's that's one of the things I'm excited to talk about. And as you know, the social media channels are a buzz today with anti bullying cries for a young guy in and the heels of a verdict in Chicago where somebody actually physically harm the human being in a hate crime,
[03:09:48.440 --> 03:09:54.440]  pled guilty and wasn't convicted and or was convicted, but wasn't punished at all.
[03:09:54.440 --> 03:10:00.440]  And so we have that footage of relation. We have that footage believed out. I meant to leave the show with that, but there was another Islamic terror attack.
[03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:11.440]  They said we were liars last year when this happened. You reported on it here. They said it's fake. They're not torturing that white guy cutting part of a scalp out saying we're going to kill you as the mind of a four year old autistic man.
[03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:12.440]  And of course they did.
[03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:19.440]  And the judge said, Hey, they're black. He's white. I'm letting you go just like, Hey, you shoot a white woman, Kate Stanley in the back.
[03:10:19.440 --> 03:10:28.440]  I'm not just going to not send you to jail or give you a give you a manslaughter for this. If you try to have a march for her, we're going to have anti from come out and physically attack you.
[03:10:28.440 --> 03:10:36.440]  I can't even I can't even watch that video, even just you showing me the clip of the video just now. It's it's it's one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen.
[03:10:36.440 --> 03:10:48.440]  And and what I I see are people hurting people. I don't even I didn't even really go to when exactly if I saw six white people with a with a black guy tied up beating him up.
[03:10:48.440 --> 03:10:55.440]  Pissed and I'd be ashamed. But what makes it worse is imagine it was a mentally retarded black man or white guy. Exactly.
[03:10:55.440 --> 03:11:02.440]  I don't see what color they are. What I see is a bunch of crazy racist nuts wound up by the media because they're going screw you, Trump.
[03:11:02.440 --> 03:11:07.440]  You still because it's all about Trump. He's some clean cut mentally retarded guy.
[03:11:07.440 --> 03:11:15.440]  But because he's clean cut because mommy dressing that way, they think they're getting back at whitey when it's somebody that doesn't have half of what they got.
[03:11:15.440 --> 03:11:22.440]  This poor this poor little boy was tortured by other people. I don't know how other people can do that to people.
[03:11:22.440 --> 03:11:31.440]  And and and when that happens, and when judges see that, I tweeted out the judge's name, not for retribution or anything, but people need to know.
[03:11:31.440 --> 03:11:33.440]  Yeah, we've got an article on info wars dot com.
[03:11:33.440 --> 03:11:42.440]  And one of you guys print that or ladies print that for me just so we have that next time because I want to read the judge said, I don't think sending you people you folks to jail.
[03:11:42.440 --> 03:11:48.440]  I mean, that's the quote for doing this. It will help you. So I'm just going to let you go, you know, probation.
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:56.440]  And they banned her and the others from social media. That's by the way, that's not a punishment that is actually a service.
[03:11:56.440 --> 03:12:02.440]  It's a gift. Exactly. That is a gift. It's not a punishment that those people need to be punished.
[03:12:02.440 --> 03:12:09.440]  How can because this is kidnapping. They had the guy for much of a day tortured him kept saying we're going to kill you.
[03:12:09.440 --> 03:12:15.440]  I mean, let's just show the video for TV viewers just his face because remember when they said it was fake. Remember?
[03:12:15.440 --> 03:12:22.440]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look at this. How was he?
[03:12:22.440 --> 03:12:30.440]  He was a teenager. I don't think they gave his age. I just I suspect under 18. And it's horrible. I mean, it's just the most.
[03:12:30.440 --> 03:12:40.440]  And the young racist black crazy people don't even know that. Why are you doing it live on the Internet, idiots?
[03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:47.440]  You've got a retarded white kid torturing the hell out of him. And then you you you're putting it out on the Internet.
[03:12:47.440 --> 03:12:55.440]  There's a real problem with what people are and aren't doing on the Internet. And the opposite, the polar opposite of this to me is this recent,
[03:12:55.440 --> 03:13:02.440]  this flurry on Twitter with this young guy Keaton who was bullied. And I saw that video to his mother put up a video for people who haven't seen it.
[03:13:02.440 --> 03:13:08.440]  His mother put up a video. There's some kids that have been teasing him. He's got maybe a speech impediment or something going on.
[03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:13.440]  He's got a cleft lip and you know, and I'm sad for him. But I don't wonder if daddy's around because he needs to learn how to.
[03:13:13.440 --> 03:13:15.440]  I mean, I guess you go to jail now if you fight back.
[03:13:15.440 --> 03:13:21.440]  Exactly. So so in my life, in my family, in the world that I'm growing up in or that I grew up in,
[03:13:21.440 --> 03:13:29.440]  you don't air your grievances on social media first to get the world to rally around you in this victim mentality.
[03:13:29.440 --> 03:13:34.440]  You need to teach that young man how to defend himself, how to protect himself, how not to be a victim.
[03:13:34.440 --> 03:13:38.440]  And that seems to be lost in this world today. They don't teach you that.
[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:40.440]  Because they want victims and it's the number one story in the world.
[03:13:40.440 --> 03:13:43.440]  And I should have led the show. That's why I got a real talk shows like you here, Matt.
[03:13:43.440 --> 03:13:46.440]  By the way, that we got to figure out a home for you every day here.
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:51.440]  So I want to launch more shows. And I think, you know, teaming you up with one of the other guys,
[03:13:51.440 --> 03:13:53.440]  it would do you a disjustice because they're great. You're great.
[03:13:53.440 --> 03:13:57.440]  I think you're kind of a one man show and have any guests you went on.
[03:13:57.440 --> 03:13:58.440]  You need to pick your slot with us.
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:00.440]  No, I've known you like eight years. I've been carrying the show.
[03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:03.440]  You've come out and visited me. We've been out to dinner, you know, met some of your family.
[03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:07.440]  But you need, you need to start hosting here. You need to come on every day.
[03:14:07.440 --> 03:14:10.440]  No, I'm sick of it. When I listen to you, you do better talk radio than I do.
[03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:14.440]  You always cover the biggest stories, but always tie it in to stuff that's important.
[03:14:14.440 --> 03:14:18.440]  You hijack the big story and then use it to wake people up about bigger issues.
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:19.440]  I mean, you're the man.
[03:14:19.440 --> 03:14:24.440]  Oh, it's nice of you. You know what happens is, is you guys are so on the front line every day.
[03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:28.440]  There's so much stuff to cover. As you know, there's so many things going on.
[03:14:28.440 --> 03:14:34.440]  It's tough. And what happens is, is I'm, I'm frankly not as busy as you guys are.
[03:14:34.440 --> 03:14:39.440]  So I end up seeing things and I see these reactions from parents in the pickup line at school
[03:14:39.440 --> 03:14:44.440]  and the way people are reacting and it's, it's mind boggling. And so it's just a little bit of a,
[03:14:44.440 --> 03:14:48.440]  and then it teaches kids to be whiny babies, but, but again, it's not their fault.
[03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:50.440]  They don't let them fight back. They take dads out of the home.
[03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:55.440]  The guys should have a big brother or a cousin. And if somebody really did do that,
[03:14:55.440 --> 03:15:00.440]  you don't beat up the kids that are beating him up. You go find their brother and beat them up.
[03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:04.440]  Exactly. Well, that's one of the things I hear these celebrities saying is on Twitter.
[03:15:04.440 --> 03:15:07.440]  They're, they're, they're saying, well, we should go get these bullies. Okay.
[03:15:07.440 --> 03:15:11.440]  Wait a minute. So your answer to the bullying is to go bully more bullies.
[03:15:11.440 --> 03:15:13.440]  That doesn't make any sense. The answer is,
[03:15:13.440 --> 03:15:16.440]  no, their dads need to be beating their asses. Yes.
[03:15:16.440 --> 03:15:19.440]  And by that, I'm making them run around the block.
[03:15:19.440 --> 03:15:23.440]  They throw up, putting them on, you know, the grounding them, whatever.
[03:15:23.440 --> 03:15:29.440]  Yeah. Matt DeBiel from the WCKG 15 30 a.m.

[03:19:38.440 --> 03:19:41.440]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.

[03:20:12.440 --> 03:20:19.440]  On the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:27.440]  I'm coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, the ATX, and we've got Matt Vubiel here from Chicago.
[03:20:27.440 --> 03:20:31.440]  We're trying to recapture these Democrat, globalist-held cities.
[03:20:31.440 --> 03:20:37.440]  We do that first by removing the Republican establishment to restore Americana, restore the engine of success.
[03:20:37.440 --> 03:20:43.440]  And here's the article I was mentioning earlier, we just tuned in. Torture of disabled white teens released on probation.
[03:20:43.440 --> 03:20:46.440]  Don't mess this up, says the judge.
[03:20:46.440 --> 03:20:53.440]  And then you see the folks that kidnapped the mentally retarded guy, tortured him, cut part of his scalp off, kept telling him,
[03:20:53.440 --> 03:21:02.440]  we're going to kill you. I mean, this is kidnapping, aggravated with weapons, torturing him, bodily harm, menacing.
[03:21:02.440 --> 03:21:06.440]  And you know what? No jail time, baby.
[03:21:06.440 --> 03:21:11.440]  I mean, it just goes on for hour after hour. We're going to kill you, you white piece of garbage.
[03:21:11.440 --> 03:21:15.440]  And I'm not blaming all black people for this. But where is the media decrying it?
[03:21:15.440 --> 03:21:18.440]  They won't cover it except to say it was fake last year.
[03:21:18.440 --> 03:21:20.440]  That's why Matt Vubiel brought that up.
[03:21:20.440 --> 03:21:24.440]  You see, Kate Stanley shot in the back by an illegal alien who'd been deported five times.
[03:21:24.440 --> 03:21:29.440]  Most of the crime against Hispanics is usually by illegal aliens that come into their own neighborhoods.
[03:21:29.440 --> 03:21:31.440]  So it's hurting Hispanics more than anybody.
[03:21:31.440 --> 03:21:35.440]  But this lady, white lady, got shot in the back, and the jury could not convict him.
[03:21:35.440 --> 03:21:38.440]  Couldn't even give him manslaughter, which just means you did it accidentally.
[03:21:38.440 --> 03:21:45.440]  It's a, you know, license to kill. This guy is 007 because they thought it would hand Trump a victory,
[03:21:45.440 --> 03:21:51.440]  which shows how the left is like a cult that empowered everybody to get Kate's law and all this.
[03:21:51.440 --> 03:21:57.440]  And it creates a backlash on Hispanic Americans that aren't connected to all these illegals and criminals
[03:21:57.440 --> 03:21:59.440]  and mental patients that are coming over the border.
[03:21:59.440 --> 03:22:04.440]  I mean, you can't go to Mexico and just stay there or be a criminal and do whatever you want.
[03:22:04.440 --> 03:22:06.440]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[03:22:06.440 --> 03:22:11.440]  Even though that's where people used to run, but, you know, you see, you had to hide out and not get in trouble and use a fake name.
[03:22:11.440 --> 03:22:15.440]  You didn't get deported. You know, some people like 40 times I've seen.
[03:22:15.440 --> 03:22:19.440]  Matt Vubiel's taken over about one minute just first off because I didn't plug very much stand.
[03:22:19.440 --> 03:22:21.440]  It's just the holiday season. It's Christmas.
[03:22:21.440 --> 03:22:26.440]  It's when we do a lot of our funding to see how we're going to hopefully stay the same size or expand.
[03:22:26.440 --> 03:22:31.440]  Next year, and I've been so focused on news, most people are plugging every segment on talk radio.
[03:22:31.440 --> 03:22:36.440]  There should be. I've been plugging once an hour. So please listen to the deals we've got.
[03:22:36.440 --> 03:22:42.440]  They're great and take action. We're calling this not just Christmas Monday because they have that thing called Green Monday to be environmental.
[03:22:42.440 --> 03:22:45.440]  I say, yeah, don't fight the cars. Don't fight the traffic. Don't fight the lines.
[03:22:45.440 --> 03:22:52.440]  Don't do all that crazy stuff. Buy online or go to mom and pop shops, whatever you do, not the big corporate stores.
[03:22:52.440 --> 03:22:56.440]  But Christmas week, we're launching massive Christmas savings all week long.
[03:22:56.440 --> 03:23:04.440]  And info or store.com plus statewide free shipping and a bunch of the sales we had were extending on the colloidal silver.
[03:23:04.440 --> 03:23:09.440]  67% off and a super male vitality, 50% off and on brain force, 50% off.
[03:23:09.440 --> 03:23:14.440]  Even though a lot of those are closest selling out and on alpha power, the new introductory super products.
[03:23:14.440 --> 03:23:18.440]  Just learn about that folks. Incredible. You want yourself to get this 50% off.
[03:23:18.440 --> 03:23:21.440]  The real red pill brand new 50% off DNA for 33% off.
[03:23:21.440 --> 03:23:26.440]  Well, that's about to sell out survival shield. 50% off knockout. 50% off prospect 50% off out of mineral fusion.
[03:23:26.440 --> 03:23:33.440]  50% off in four selects high quality, swirable food. 50% off plus much more books, T shirts, films.
[03:23:33.440 --> 03:23:37.440]  I've got shirts that say it's okay to be white. It's okay to be black. It's okay to be brown.
[03:23:37.440 --> 03:23:42.440]  It's okay to be red. It's okay to be pink. It's okay.
[03:23:42.440 --> 03:23:46.440]  But at the bottom, it says it's great to be human.
[03:23:46.440 --> 03:23:51.440]  We've got triggering shirts. All lives matter. Oh, those are beautiful.
[03:23:51.440 --> 03:23:55.440]  And there are great ways to just reach out and be called a Nazi for saying that.
[03:23:55.440 --> 03:24:01.440]  But that's only in university areas. A few left to cities and in certain enclaves.
[03:24:01.440 --> 03:24:04.440]  Most places you'll get, you know, Jenner bought for you. Seriously, meet like minded people.
[03:24:04.440 --> 03:24:12.440]  But we've got shirts that aren't as radical either at infowarstore.com. Whatever you do, please commit today to check out the products.

[03:24:36.440 --> 03:24:43.440]  Now back to Matt Dubiel and 1315 30 we have telepathy free 1530 WCKG.
[03:24:43.440 --> 03:24:52.440]  And of course, it's also got the FM affiliate as well, 102.3 WCKG back to Matt Dubiel.
[03:24:52.440 --> 03:24:59.440]  Alex, it's dangerous in Chicago, brother. It's 11 out of 11 homicides in the month of December.
[03:24:59.440 --> 03:25:04.440]  And today is what the 10th is today the 10th, the 11th.
[03:25:04.440 --> 03:25:12.440]  So we're one for one every day, which is sad and disgusting for the month of November 39 deaths in Chicago.
[03:25:12.440 --> 03:25:18.440]  And what people don't realize what the media doesn't tell you just like the story about those people that kidnapped somebody.
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:32.440]  Could you imagine if you kidnapped, if you went to let's say Singapore or another country in the UK or anywhere abroad and you committed a crime like shoplifting.
[03:25:32.440 --> 03:25:37.440]  Or back in the day, I remember there were kids that spray painted and I think it was in Singapore.
[03:25:37.440 --> 03:25:40.440]  And they ended up, yeah, they ended up getting caned.
[03:25:40.440 --> 03:25:51.440]  And there was this big international to do about these kids because they, I don't know, spray painted something and then they were getting caned or they were going to get caned.
[03:25:51.440 --> 03:25:56.440]  And then, you know, there was, there was diplomatic efforts that had to be taken into account.
[03:25:56.440 --> 03:26:02.440]  In the United States of America, we have citizens kidnapping other citizens.
[03:26:02.440 --> 03:26:14.440]  And, and in what is defined as a hate crime, and the judge in the hate crime, after the person please guilty says, you know what, we're putting people in jail for not paying their child support.
[03:26:14.440 --> 03:26:18.440]  We're putting people in jail for smoking pot when they're dying of cancer.
[03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:28.440]  We're putting people in jail for in debtor's prisons for other white collar crimes, but you committed the act of kidnapping somebody.
[03:26:28.440 --> 03:26:32.440]  You abused the person, you videotaped it and showed it to people.
[03:26:32.440 --> 03:26:34.440]  I'm just going to ban you from social media.
[03:26:34.440 --> 03:26:38.440]  That's all we're going to cut a piece of their scalp out and you tell them you're going to kill them.
[03:26:38.440 --> 03:26:40.440]  This guy thought for hours he was about to die.
[03:26:40.440 --> 03:26:42.440]  You see the sorrow.
[03:26:42.440 --> 03:26:48.440]  It was a disgusting, disgusting display and abuse and torture.
[03:26:48.440 --> 03:26:50.440]  This should never happen, you know.
[03:26:50.440 --> 03:26:57.440]  And by the way, in the meantime, we debate whether we should do stuff similar to this at like Guantanamo for people that are terrorists.
[03:26:57.440 --> 03:27:05.440]  And everybody gets involved and says, oh no, we, we shouldn't, we shouldn't waterboard terrorists to find out when they're going to kill the next 50,000.
[03:27:05.440 --> 03:27:16.440]  Look in that kid's eyes where he, he's like totally confused, he's mentally retarded, and he's just like begging like, why, why, they just keep torturing him.
[03:27:16.440 --> 03:27:19.440]  It's just that's mainstream media created that.
[03:27:19.440 --> 03:27:29.440]  Yeah, you know, I remember right after the election, the internet and Facebook and social media was swelling with the, with the BS storyline of, what am I going to tell my kids?
[03:27:29.440 --> 03:27:32.440]  What am I going to tell my daughter about Hillary not winning?
[03:27:32.440 --> 03:27:34.440]  What am I going to tell my kids about Trump?
[03:27:34.440 --> 03:27:39.440]  What do you tell your kids about this world where this can happen to an innocent child?
[03:27:39.440 --> 03:27:44.440]  And by the way, I think both of us would be saying the same thing if that was a black kid.
[03:27:44.440 --> 03:27:51.440]  Absolutely. Listen, I'm ashamed, even though I'm not at fault, some other white person does nothing, I would be ashamed.
[03:27:51.440 --> 03:27:54.440]  I'm ashamed as a human watching these black people act like this.
[03:27:54.440 --> 03:28:00.440]  I'd feel a lot better if I saw black leaders saying, hey, those kids ought to get thrown in prison for five years, man.
[03:28:00.440 --> 03:28:06.440]  You kidnap somebody, you say you're going to kill them, you torture them. And on top of it, it's a mentally retarded person.
[03:28:06.440 --> 03:28:09.440]  I mean, what's that? That is just, it's crazy.
[03:28:09.440 --> 03:28:21.440]  If Al Sharpton was worth assault, if Reverend, the Reverend Jesse Jackson was worth assault, they would be on television right now saying, you know what, this was a miscarriage of justice and we should be doing better.
[03:28:21.440 --> 03:28:24.440]  These children that did these crimes should be punished.
[03:28:24.440 --> 03:28:27.440]  They don't represent us. They don't represent the black community.
[03:28:27.440 --> 03:28:32.440]  Mothers and grandmothers and fathers in this community should be doing better and this is not us.
[03:28:32.440 --> 03:28:37.440]  Well, that's the excuse is these teenagers are like 15, 16, 19.
[03:28:37.440 --> 03:28:42.440]  I mean, I mean, Brittany Covington, the one that just let off, she's 19, the ring later.
[03:28:42.440 --> 03:28:47.440]  I mean, when do women commit crimes like this? We have women in America now torturing people?
[03:28:47.440 --> 03:28:53.440]  Guys, wouldn't your wife or girlfriend love it if you treated her to the very best this Christmas?

[03:30:00.440 --> 03:30:02.440]  So what do we do about it?
[03:30:02.440 --> 03:30:05.440]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.

[03:31:40.440 --> 03:31:59.440]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.

[03:32:32.440 --> 03:32:47.440]  That is my goal here is to bring you the very best at the lowest price. When you purchase it at infowarstore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[03:33:02.440 --> 03:33:19.440]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.440 --> 03:33:44.440]  It's Matt Dubio filling in for Alex Jones from Chicago. I sort of felt like Dave Ramsey there for a second. That's one of the songs Dave Ramsey, I think it's Baker Street. It's one of the songs Dave Ramsey uses in his radio network where he focuses on telling you to not get into debt, pay off your house and be scared all the time pretty much.
[03:33:44.440 --> 03:34:00.440]  Some of his advice is good, but some of it is pretty out there. News today from Chicago. Chicago you may have heard is a dangerous place, not everywhere, but there's certain areas specifically where the former president claims to be from.
[03:34:00.440 --> 03:34:18.440]  There's an area where there's a lot of gunshots, a lot of death, a lot of gang activity, and unfortunately to date in 2017, we have 643 murders in Chicago. 643 murders total in Chicago homicides.
[03:34:18.440 --> 03:34:31.440]  494 of those people were shot and killed. 594. So just when you kind of do the math, you can figure out you divide that by 12, as I've said before, and I'm going to keep saying it until it stops.
[03:34:31.440 --> 03:34:49.440]  It's Las Vegas every month in slow motion in Chicago. It's Las Vegas every month in slow motion in Chicago. Nobody cares, nobody cares, nobody cares. Why doesn't anybody care? Well, because mostly it's black people shooting each other and the news doesn't care about that.
[03:34:49.440 --> 03:35:02.440]  The mayor of Chicago doesn't care about that. The governor of Chicago doesn't care about that. And sadly, neither does, by the way, the mayor is a Democrat. The governor is a Republican.
[03:35:02.440 --> 03:35:14.440]  Mayor is a Democrat. Governor is a Republican. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter what party they're a part of. They're both a part of the parties that do nothing. They're both a part of the swamp.
[03:35:14.440 --> 03:35:26.440]  Okay, the swamp needs to be drained. That's the whole motif behind this movement that started to swell up a couple of years ago. It's not just about Trump, really. In fact, it's not about Trump at all.
[03:35:26.440 --> 03:35:35.440]  It's about you. It's about me. It's about us paying attention and waking up and going like, oh, I've been sleeping for all this time.
[03:35:35.440 --> 03:35:46.440]  It's time for me to wake up and participate in my life. It's time for me to wake up and participate in this experiment we call the United States of America.
[03:35:46.440 --> 03:36:00.440]  It's an experiment and it's working as long as people wake up and pay attention. That means that you can't just elect people and hope that they're gonna be superheroes and just save you and be like, all right, we took care of that.
[03:36:00.440 --> 03:36:15.440]  We elected Rahm Emanuel. We took care of it. We elected Bruce Rauner. We took care of it. We elected Donald Trump. Guess what? He needs your help. They all need your help. The Americans need your help.
[03:36:15.440 --> 03:36:22.440]  Why? Because what happens when these guys get into office? Not hopefully our president, but we gotta keep an eye on him and make sure.
[03:36:22.440 --> 03:36:32.440]  But for example, we got a congressman in the Fifth District of Illinois, Congressman Mike Quigley. He's responsible for the Fifth District.
[03:36:32.440 --> 03:36:48.440]  Now, he is not the chancellor of the Fifth District. He is not the knight of the Fifth District. He is supposed to be the representative of the Fifth District representing the people of the Fifth District.
[03:36:48.440 --> 03:37:01.440]  Instead of fixing the murder problem, instead of being actively involved in fixing the homicide problem in his backyard, he's focused on what?
[03:37:01.440 --> 03:37:10.440]  Twitter. Infowars. Alex Jones bad. Twitter bad. Fake news bad.
[03:37:10.440 --> 03:37:23.440]  He's in front of Intelli, he's part of the House Intelligence Committee, and he's out there propagating this Russian nonsense and propagating the fake news against the people.
[03:37:23.440 --> 03:37:35.440]  Not the fake news outlets like CNN, but those outlets that are actually working to thwart the fake news outlets, saying that they're pushing forward stories that aren't true.
[03:37:35.440 --> 03:37:44.440]  Mike Quigley. Mike Quigley. Congressman Mike Quigley. Guess what? He's gonna need to be reelected at some point.
[03:37:44.440 --> 03:37:55.440]  Rahm Emanuel is gonna need to be reelected at some point. Bruce Rauner right now is going up against a bunch of other billionaires in Illinois to try and be reelected at some point.
[03:37:55.440 --> 03:38:02.440]  What are you gonna do about it? And if you're not in Chicago, why do you care? If you're not in Illinois, why do you care? Why should you care?
[03:38:02.440 --> 03:38:10.440]  I'm gonna say this, and I'm gonna say it again. It's coming to a theater near you, my friend. Why do you think this Kate Stein stuff happened?
[03:38:10.440 --> 03:38:18.440]  Why do you think the judicial system failed us on the West Coast? It's coming to a theater near you. How do you know?
[03:38:18.440 --> 03:38:27.440]  I'll give you an example. Last week, last week in Chicago, there was a meeting, and it wasn't a secret. It wasn't a secret society meeting.
[03:38:27.440 --> 03:38:37.440]  It was out in the open, and it was mayors from all over the world. Mayors from all over the world came to Chicago. The mayor of Austin, Texas was there.
[03:38:37.440 --> 03:38:51.440]  The mayor of San Francisco was there. The mayor of San Diego, I think, was there also. Many, many mayors, all the mayors, some of the best mayors, some of them probably not so good, all got together in Chicago.
[03:38:51.440 --> 03:39:00.440]  What do you think they got together to talk about? What do you think was the topic? I just hazard a guess right now. What do you think they came to Chicago?
[03:39:00.440 --> 03:39:08.440]  Somehow, Rahm Emanuel and whoever put this together got all these mayors to fly in in their busy schedules. They all got a bunch of stuff going on.
[03:39:08.440 --> 03:39:16.440]  They have things to do. They have cities to run. They came into Chicago. I thought maybe they were being trained on how to run their city into the ground,
[03:39:16.440 --> 03:39:25.440]  because if there's something that Rahm Emanuel is qualified to do, he can teach them all how to turn their cities into a rotting cesspool.
[03:39:25.440 --> 03:39:34.440]  Learn how to turn your city into a rotting cesspool. Tickets are only $9.97. You can be in VIP seating. You can be in the VIP area.
[03:39:34.440 --> 03:39:46.440]  Join us for a three-day conference on how to turn your city into a rotting cesspool. Join Rahm Emanuel and other keynote speakers like Khan from London.
[03:39:46.440 --> 03:39:53.440]  Who else can we get to show people how to turn their city into a rotting cesspool? Actually, that wasn't what the meeting was about.
[03:39:53.440 --> 03:40:10.440]  The meeting was about climate change, climate change. It was about the weather. These gemokes got together, mayors, some of the most important leaders in some of the biggest cities in the country and the world.
[03:40:10.440 --> 03:40:15.440]  Listen to me. Listen to me very carefully. Think about this for a minute.
[03:40:15.440 --> 03:40:29.440]  The mayors of the biggest cities on planet Earth, the mayors of the biggest cities in Canada and Europe and the United States all over the world,
[03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:41.440]  convened in Chicago the murder capital of the United States of America, where it's Las Vegas every day, Las Vegas every month in slow motion.
[03:40:41.440 --> 03:40:49.440]  They all flew in. They all canceled their appointments, very busy people, and they all got together in a room.
[03:40:49.440 --> 03:40:56.440]  They sat and chit-chatted about the weather. Let that sink in. The most powerful leaders in the biggest cities.
[03:40:56.440 --> 03:41:05.440]  Now, these cities are warding national efforts and very important missions from the United States of America.
[03:41:05.440 --> 03:41:12.440]  They're thumbing their nose at the United States government, the president of the United States at nearly every turn.
[03:41:12.440 --> 03:41:22.440]  Now, we're going to be a sanctuary city. Screw what the president says. We're going to let just a bunch of anybody come into the city, and we're going to stand up as a sanctuary city.
[03:41:22.440 --> 03:41:31.440]  We're going to stand up for that. These are the same cities that won't stand up for the people getting shot and murdered on their south side.
[03:41:31.440 --> 03:41:42.440]  These are the same cities that their roads are like the surface of the moon. Speaking of the moon, the president has announced, and we're going to talk about this in the next segment.
[03:41:42.440 --> 03:41:50.440]  The president, Donald Trump has announced, he's going to sign a directive to send Americans back to the moon and eventually to Mars.
[03:41:50.440 --> 03:41:58.440]  And this is very exciting. President Trump is signing a directive to send Americans back to the moon and eventually to Mars.
[03:41:58.440 --> 03:42:06.440]  I have a short list of people I'd like him to send first. Some of you might be too young to remember the honeymooners, but was it Ralph?
[03:42:06.440 --> 03:42:09.440]  To the moon, Alice! To the moon!
[03:42:09.440 --> 03:42:17.440]  There's some people that we should be sending to the moon. I've compiled a short list. I would like you to participate and let me know who you'd like to send to the moon.
[03:42:17.440 --> 03:42:23.440]  First on my list might be Chelsea Handler. Hey, if you have any ideas, you can tweet them to me at Mad on Air.
[03:42:23.440 --> 03:42:33.440]  We'll talk about who the president should send to the moon. Coming up, it's Infowars Live from Chicago. My name is Matt Dubial from AM 1530 WCKG.
[03:42:33.440 --> 03:42:54.440]  It's dangerous here in Chicago. Who should be sent to the moon? We'll talk about that next on Infowars.com.
[03:43:03.440 --> 03:43:12.440]  And as a long-time Infowars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome Brainforce Anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too.
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:13.440]  Thank you.

[03:43:28.440 --> 03:43:29.440]  Absolutely.
[03:43:29.440 --> 03:43:37.440]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on.
[03:43:37.440 --> 03:43:48.440]  And if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.

[03:47:14.440 --> 03:47:19.440]  If you're getting this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:19.440 --> 03:47:29.440]  Hey, how you doing? It's Matt Dubiel from Chicago broadcasting from the AM 1530 WCKG Remote Dubiel Bunker Studios.
[03:47:29.440 --> 03:47:31.440]  Filling in for Alex Jones and I love doing it.
[03:47:31.440 --> 03:47:33.440]  What a great call on a Monday to get.
[03:47:33.440 --> 03:47:39.440]  Hey, do you want to come in? Do you want to come on and talk a little bit about what's going on in Chicago?
[03:47:39.440 --> 03:47:45.440]  Talk about what's going on in the world and in the country and chit chat with Alex Jones for a little bit.
[03:47:45.440 --> 03:47:47.440]  The answer is almost always going to be yes.
[03:47:47.440 --> 03:47:58.440]  My radio station's website is WCKG.com and the page they were just showing you if you're watching this at Infowars.com forward slash show is a support page.
[03:47:58.440 --> 03:48:04.440]  For the radio station, Alex mentioned he hinted that we're building a bigger station and that is absolutely true.
[03:48:04.440 --> 03:48:13.440]  I can't talk about all the details yet because there's a lot of moving parts, but we're building something very big, something very tremendous.
[03:48:13.440 --> 03:48:17.440]  Many people are going to like it. Many people are saying it's going to be very great.
[03:48:17.440 --> 03:48:24.440]  We're building it on a building that has a very popular word on the front of it and we would love to have you help and participate.
[03:48:24.440 --> 03:48:35.440]  That's what that page is for WCKG.com slash support. Anybody that supports us, I will mail you personally. I hope to build a 102.3 sticker.
[03:48:35.440 --> 03:48:40.440]  If you pick any of those monthly deals, I will send you a Q101 t-shirt.
[03:48:40.440 --> 03:48:42.440]  Why in the world would you want anything like that?
[03:48:42.440 --> 03:48:47.440]  As Alex said, when you have this stuff on, it inspires conversation.
[03:48:47.440 --> 03:48:53.440]  Somebody might say, well, what do you have a bumper sticker for that says that you helped build some radio station in Chicago?
[03:48:53.440 --> 03:48:57.440]  You're here in Omaha. What are you wearing some shirt about some station in Chicago?
[03:48:57.440 --> 03:49:00.440]  You're here in Alabama. You're here in Texas.
[03:49:00.440 --> 03:49:03.440]  That's a great opportunity to say, well, listen, here's the deal.
[03:49:03.440 --> 03:49:07.440]  It's the biggest radio station that is carrying Alex's show.
[03:49:07.440 --> 03:49:13.440]  And if we can make it work in Chicago and if we can get this message out over and over again in Chicago,
[03:49:13.440 --> 03:49:16.440]  then we can show other areas that we can make it work there.
[03:49:16.440 --> 03:49:23.440]  See, there's same strategies and tactics this coming to a theater near you business. It can work in our favor too.
[03:49:23.440 --> 03:49:27.440]  You just got to pick an area, go all in and then expand from there.
[03:49:27.440 --> 03:49:29.440]  So there's some news today.
[03:49:29.440 --> 03:49:40.440]  President Donald Trump is going to be signing a directive to send Americans back to the moon and eventually to Mars.
[03:49:40.440 --> 03:49:47.440]  This is very exciting because I have a list of people that I would like to nominate for President Trump to send to the moon.
[03:49:47.440 --> 03:49:53.440]  First person on that list, as one of the producers there at info were suggested and pointed out,
[03:49:53.440 --> 03:49:58.440]  there's a whole list of people that said they were going to leave the country if President Trump was elected.
[03:49:58.440 --> 03:50:02.440]  I'd just like to start with some of the jerks that are in the country right now,
[03:50:02.440 --> 03:50:09.440]  that say some of the most ridiculous things and do some of the most ridiculous things under the auspices of being caring
[03:50:09.440 --> 03:50:11.440]  and being liberal and being kind.
[03:50:11.440 --> 03:50:15.440]  And the first person that comes to mind for me is Chelsea Handler.
[03:50:15.440 --> 03:50:23.440]  Chelsea Handler is very unusual to me because there was a time when she was on this e-television network
[03:50:23.440 --> 03:50:28.440]  and there was all these rumors about how she got the television show and what she had to do to get the TV show.
[03:50:28.440 --> 03:50:31.440]  I don't know if any of those are true or not. She joked about them.
[03:50:31.440 --> 03:50:37.440]  But there's sometimes where she looks kind of nice and then the rest of the time she looks absolutely hideous.
[03:50:37.440 --> 03:50:43.440]  And really if you read what she writes and what she types and what she tweets, it's very ugly.
[03:50:43.440 --> 03:50:47.440]  It's a very ugly persona that she's adopted.
[03:50:47.440 --> 03:50:49.440]  And I'm not going to make excuses for her.
[03:50:49.440 --> 03:50:51.440]  Maybe she's been through some things that are rough.
[03:50:51.440 --> 03:50:59.440]  But it's interesting in a world where we're constantly opining and giving our thoughts and opinions about the bullying of others.
[03:50:59.440 --> 03:51:05.440]  And she's one of those people that will talk about bullying and talk about women's rights.
[03:51:05.440 --> 03:51:09.440]  She's out there tweeting about what feminism is and what feminism isn't.
[03:51:09.440 --> 03:51:14.440]  She's injected herself into this Roy Moore, Alabama stuff, which by the way, I stay out of.
[03:51:14.440 --> 03:51:17.440]  I don't live in Alabama. I'm not an Alabama voter.
[03:51:17.440 --> 03:51:22.440]  I'm going to let the people in Alabama figure out what they have to do and what's right for them.
[03:51:22.440 --> 03:51:24.440]  That's how this thing is set up.
[03:51:24.440 --> 03:51:29.440]  I focus on the things in my backyard and I get to know what's going on in my backyard.
[03:51:29.440 --> 03:51:33.440]  If I'm paying so much attention to what's happening over the fence,
[03:51:33.440 --> 03:51:36.440]  I'm not watching what's happening in my yard.
[03:51:36.440 --> 03:51:41.440]  And I got to pay attention to what's in my yard because if I don't, there's going to be some foxes in the henhouse.
[03:51:41.440 --> 03:51:43.440]  And I don't want that happening in my yard.
[03:51:43.440 --> 03:51:45.440]  So I will focus on my backyard.
[03:51:45.440 --> 03:51:48.440]  I will let the Alabama people focus on their backyard.
[03:51:48.440 --> 03:51:51.440]  And I trust that they're smart enough and stog on it.
[03:51:51.440 --> 03:51:54.440]  People like them, they're going to figure it out on their own.
[03:51:54.440 --> 03:51:56.440]  So back to Chelsea Handler.
[03:51:56.440 --> 03:52:03.440]  Chelsea has chimed in about the Roy Moore saga and about what feminism is and look at her.
[03:52:03.440 --> 03:52:05.440]  She's just an interesting person.
[03:52:05.440 --> 03:52:10.440]  She's chimed in on about what feminism is and what feminism isn't.
[03:52:10.440 --> 03:52:17.440]  And I want President Trump to send her to the moon first because after she goes on this tirade about feminism,
[03:52:17.440 --> 03:52:18.440]  what does she do?
[03:52:18.440 --> 03:52:22.440]  Well, she naturally begins to attack Sarah Huckabee Sanders,
[03:52:22.440 --> 03:52:27.440]  who is the press secretary for the Trump administration.
[03:52:27.440 --> 03:52:34.440]  And she fat-shames Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who by the way, Sarah Huckabee Sanders is not fat, number one.
[03:52:34.440 --> 03:52:36.440]  She's a very well-spoken.
[03:52:36.440 --> 03:52:38.440]  She's got her act together.
[03:52:38.440 --> 03:52:41.440]  She might be one of the best press secretaries we've ever had.
[03:52:41.440 --> 03:52:48.440]  And she does a very good job handling the jackals in the press pit.
[03:52:48.440 --> 03:52:52.440]  She might be the best one there's ever been.
[03:52:52.440 --> 03:52:54.440]  And what does Chelsea Handler do?
[03:52:54.440 --> 03:53:00.440]  She begins to attack her, not just for her job or what she does or how she does her job.
[03:53:00.440 --> 03:53:07.440]  Chelsea Handler attacks another woman for her looks and her body type.
[03:53:07.440 --> 03:53:10.440]  Sounds an awful lot like bullying to me.
[03:53:10.440 --> 03:53:13.440]  So let's send Chelsea Handler to the moon first.
[03:53:13.440 --> 03:53:15.440]  She's number one on my list.
[03:53:15.440 --> 03:53:16.440]  I mean, this could be very easy.
[03:53:16.440 --> 03:53:19.440]  We could say that we should send Hillary Clinton to the moon.
[03:53:19.440 --> 03:53:23.440]  But I think there's other plans for Hillary.
[03:53:23.440 --> 03:53:25.440]  And I like the other places they might send her better.
[03:53:25.440 --> 03:53:28.440]  The moon is where I want to send Chelsea Handler.
[03:53:28.440 --> 03:53:36.440]  It's been announced if you're just joining us that Donald Trump is going to be signing a directive to send Americans back to the moon eventually to Mars.
[03:53:36.440 --> 03:53:40.440]  A lot of us are old enough to remember the honeymooners.
[03:53:40.440 --> 03:53:46.440]  And one of the famous quotes from Ralph Cramden was to the moon Alice to the moon.
[03:53:46.440 --> 03:53:49.440]  That's what he said he was going to do when she got on his nerves.
[03:53:49.440 --> 03:53:51.440]  He was going to send her to the moon.
[03:53:51.440 --> 03:53:55.440]  Same thing with Ralph or with Norton to the moon Norton to the moon.
[03:53:55.440 --> 03:53:56.440]  He didn't have any kids.
[03:53:56.440 --> 03:53:58.440]  Believe me if I don't think so.
[03:53:58.440 --> 03:54:02.440]  And maybe I didn't watch the episodes late enough to realize if he ever had kids or not.
[03:54:02.440 --> 03:54:05.440]  But the Cramdons never threatened to send the kids to the moon.
[03:54:05.440 --> 03:54:07.440]  So I would like to send Chelsea Handler to the moon.
[03:54:07.440 --> 03:54:09.440]  Who would you like to send to the moon?
[03:54:09.440 --> 03:54:14.440]  Please tweet me at Met On Air with your suggestions for who Donald Trump should send to the moon first.
[03:54:14.440 --> 03:54:18.440]  Donald Trump to sign a directive to send Americans back to the moon and eventually to Mars.
[03:54:18.440 --> 03:54:20.440]  Maybe you have a preference.
[03:54:20.440 --> 03:54:25.440]  Maybe you want to send Chelsea to the moon and Keith Oberman maybe he goes to Mars.
[03:54:25.440 --> 03:54:31.440]  Because he would eventually get asphyxiated because of the atmosphere in Mars and it's further away.
[03:54:31.440 --> 03:54:34.440]  Keith Oberman is probably second on my list.
[03:54:34.440 --> 03:54:41.440]  Although it's kind of like he was on Mars because he was doing a web series for a magazine that's failing.
[03:54:41.440 --> 03:54:43.440]  So that's a lot like being on Mars.
[03:54:43.440 --> 03:54:48.440]  And if you ever watched it and I only watched little clips of it that were just weird to me.
[03:54:48.440 --> 03:54:49.440]  I don't know.
[03:54:49.440 --> 03:54:51.440]  Is he trying to perpetrate that he's in France?
[03:54:51.440 --> 03:54:53.440]  Is that what that background is about?
[03:54:53.440 --> 03:55:01.440]  If you listen to the audio of the Keith Oberman Mars report, it always sounds to me like he's in his mother's basement
[03:55:01.440 --> 03:55:04.440]  and maybe in the bathroom in his mother's basement.
[03:55:04.440 --> 03:55:11.440]  I wish one of the Garrison cartoonists would draw a cartoon of Keith Oberman and where you could see the panned out view
[03:55:11.440 --> 03:55:15.440]  and he's actually sitting on the toilet because that's what it sounds like.
[03:55:15.440 --> 03:55:16.440]  It's very echoey.
[03:55:16.440 --> 03:55:19.440]  I don't know if they can't afford good audio equipment over there at GQ.
[03:55:19.440 --> 03:55:21.440]  Maybe the cutbacks.
[03:55:21.440 --> 03:55:23.440]  Keith Oberman is number two on my list.
[03:55:23.440 --> 03:55:28.440]  I'm not doing this Letterman style because I'm actually going not in reverse.
[03:55:28.440 --> 03:55:32.440]  I'm just going to name the people that I think and I would love to hear who you think.
[03:55:32.440 --> 03:55:36.440]  And I would definitely love to look at that list of the people that said they were going to leave the country.
[03:55:36.440 --> 03:55:37.440]  Of course, none of them did.
[03:55:37.440 --> 03:55:46.440]  Number three on my list, perhaps one of the most vile reporters in the business is Jim Acosta at CNN.
[03:55:46.440 --> 03:55:53.440]  I met Jim like we didn't shake hands and have a conversation together, but I heard him saying terrible things about you and I.
[03:55:53.440 --> 03:56:00.440]  I heard him saying terrible things about Americans that were at the Trump rally in Chicago, calling them stupid.
[03:56:00.440 --> 03:56:07.440]  And just the things that he said and the disdain he had for everyday American people, I found tremendously disgusting.
[03:56:07.440 --> 03:56:16.440]  And I would think that he would be a great candidate to send to the moon as President Trump is signing a directive to send Americans back to the moon eventually to Mars.
[03:56:16.440 --> 03:56:26.440]  Now, I'm sure this will be twisted by weird sources to say that some idiot on Info Wars thinks that Trump is actually sending citizens to the moon.
[03:56:26.440 --> 03:56:35.440]  I know full well what he's talking about is rebuilding our space program and making us great again intergalactically, which is tremendous.
[03:56:35.440 --> 03:56:38.440]  Number four for me is Joy Behar.
[03:56:38.440 --> 03:56:40.440]  She belongs maybe on Mars.
[03:56:40.440 --> 03:56:42.440]  Maybe the moon is a little bit too close.
[03:56:42.440 --> 03:56:48.440]  Perhaps the dark side of the moon would be best for Joy because her her idiocy.
[03:56:48.440 --> 03:56:50.440]  It really transcends.
[03:56:50.440 --> 03:57:08.440]  I think if you put Joy Behar on the other side of the moon, her her lunacy and her idiocy maybe would would somehow stay out there because her being allowed to broadcast that just her complete lack of common sense on a major network to me is very scary.
[03:57:08.440 --> 03:57:13.440]  I would love to know who you think should be sent to the moon and perhaps who should be sent to Mars.
[03:57:13.440 --> 03:57:19.440]  President Trump to sign a directive to send Americans back to the moon eventually to Mars.
[03:57:19.440 --> 03:57:22.440]  Who should stay and who should go share it with me.
[03:57:22.440 --> 03:57:27.440]  It's always a pleasure to hang out with Info Wars and the war room is next.
[03:57:27.440 --> 03:57:38.440]  Owen Schreuer, make sure you've got it on infowars.com forward slash show from Chicago. It's Matt Dubio for infowars.com.
