[00:00.000 --> 00:07.240]  media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:07.240 --> 00:17.400]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome
[00:17.400 --> 00:21.560]  ladies and gentlemen welcome I am not Alex Jones I am Jason Bermas I'm subbing
[00:21.560 --> 00:28.000]  in for Alex one more day before am I excited I came in today to find out that
[00:28.000 --> 00:34.680]  I have a jam-packed show and on the line right now I have both Kevin Booth of
[00:34.680 --> 00:40.120]  American Drug War and the legend Tommy Chong you know from such movies as you
[00:40.120 --> 00:43.320]  know the Cheech and Chong films next movie nice dreams even the Corsican
[00:43.320 --> 00:47.960]  brothers all all good stuff and he has a prominent role in American Drug War Tommy
[00:47.960 --> 00:52.720]  of course picked up for selling glassware on the internet after 9-11
[00:52.720 --> 00:56.480]  that's a no-no apparently and I'm not sure how many months he did I think he
[00:56.480 --> 01:00.680]  did like 8 to 12 but we'll we'll ask him Kevin Tommy are you with me yeah
[01:00.680 --> 01:05.360]  yeah excellent to have you both on I guess I want to ask Kevin first what
[01:05.360 --> 01:08.920]  really launched you into this American Drug War picture I've seen that I think
[01:08.920 --> 01:12.320]  it's excellent and you know I know it's made its rounds on showtime and we're
[01:12.320 --> 01:17.040]  selling it here but it's really getting out there well like I say in the film I
[01:17.040 --> 01:22.040]  mean my my personal motives were just the depth of several family members to
[01:22.040 --> 01:26.920]  what I call the legal drugs of alcohol tobacco and pharmaceutical drugs that
[01:26.920 --> 01:35.760]  kill at least almost a million Americans a year while all the so-called
[01:35.760 --> 01:41.000]  illegal drugs killed less than 11,000 a year and when you look at the death
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.440]  stats from marijuana it's pretty much impossible to find a classic my dogs
[01:47.440 --> 01:55.920]  are barking live radio and um that's pretty much what what got me going on
[01:55.920 --> 01:59.680]  this but I wanted to you know I also you know wanted to have Tommy on because
[01:59.680 --> 02:05.560]  they've got a new film out called aka Tommy Chong which is totally focuses on
[02:05.560 --> 02:10.560]  on Tommy's arrest Josh Gilbert filmmaker did a great job of making this film
[02:10.560 --> 02:15.000]  and that's why I thought it would be so important to have Tommy on right now
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.120]  because he's just had a story happen to him yeah absolutely all right Tommy so
[02:19.120 --> 02:22.720]  why don't you tell the listeners your story you were jailed for how long well
[02:22.720 --> 02:29.760]  I was arrested not well not really arrested I was my health was rated by
[02:29.760 --> 02:35.760]  the DEA and they came in and they they grabbed computers and cash and they were
[02:35.760 --> 02:41.560]  looking for weapons guns and I had you know some pot there they took it but
[02:41.560 --> 02:45.760]  they weren't really looking for pot they were after my they were after me
[02:45.760 --> 02:53.840]  basically and the bombs were the excuse what they did they set up a phony
[02:53.840 --> 02:58.440]  head shop in Beaver Falls Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania was one of two
[02:58.440 --> 03:04.320]  states that would would prosecute this law that little known little known law
[03:04.320 --> 03:10.000]  that that made it illegal to ship drug paraphernalia across the state line and
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.920]  so that was the little technicality they got my company on my son's company and
[03:14.920 --> 03:19.480]  I played guilty because I didn't want them going after my son or my wife
[03:19.480 --> 03:25.720]  would see threatened to do and I received nine months in federal
[03:25.720 --> 03:30.080]  penitentiary wow nine months what was it like there in federal penitentiary I've
[03:30.080 --> 03:35.000]  seen the interview that Kevin conducted with you about two or three years ago
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.600]  yeah it was it was you know it was life-changing for me you know I went
[03:40.600 --> 03:47.080]  from a you know a comedian pothead to an activist pothead now now I'm really
[03:47.080 --> 03:52.640]  they they they pissed me off you know and you know the fact that they could
[03:52.640 --> 03:56.760]  put me in and I was in there with a lot of people you know that were victims of
[03:56.760 --> 04:00.920]  the drug war and my their sentences were a lot worse than mine you know that
[04:00.920 --> 04:04.720]  they were I was in there with people that you know finishing up 20 years
[04:04.720 --> 04:10.880]  sentence for marijuana cultivation you know ridiculous ridiculous times you
[04:10.880 --> 04:15.400]  know and they were they were the most peaceful and caring people in the prison

[06:53.960 --> 06:57.920]  America there is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and
[06:57.920 --> 07:01.920]  state this confederation of evangelicals Catholics and Protestant denominations
[07:01.920 --> 07:05.960]  will form one huge political voting block their agenda is enforcement of
[07:05.960 --> 07:09.560]  religious worship and morality by legislation our forefathers wrote the
[07:09.560 --> 07:12.560]  Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom liberty of
[07:12.560 --> 07:16.240]  conscience history and the Bible proved to them that these two systems church and
[07:16.240 --> 07:20.400]  state must be kept separate it must be our love of God and of country that
[07:20.400 --> 07:24.400]  prompts or constrains us this will change the character not civil enforcement
[07:24.400 --> 07:27.880]  from history we saw that when church and state united known as papal Rome
[07:27.880 --> 07:31.840]  religious intolerance resulted this union would go directly contrary to the
[07:31.840 --> 07:35.680]  great principles of our nation America and papal Rome are uniting in this
[07:35.680 --> 07:40.240]  agenda Protestant America awake before it is too late the prophecies are fast

[07:55.160 --> 08:01.360]  political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:04.400 --> 08:10.360]  all right we are back with Tommy Chong and of course Kevin Booth the creator
[08:10.360 --> 08:15.840]  of American drug war Tommy also in a new picture Tommy why don't you tell us
[08:15.840 --> 08:19.680]  about the new project obviously we've seen you in American drug war very
[08:19.680 --> 08:23.360]  powerful in that you know along with the freeway Ricky Ross and others just an
[08:23.360 --> 08:27.000]  excellent film by Kevin Booth but what's this what's this other project well
[08:27.000 --> 08:35.520]  a key Tommy Chong is the film that was made by Josh Gilbert about me my my
[08:35.520 --> 08:41.040]  trials and tribulations going into prison it shows me before and during and
[08:41.040 --> 08:45.960]  after the the prison thing but the there was an interesting development that
[08:45.960 --> 08:50.920]  just happened two days ago the the feds the same people that put me in jail
[08:50.920 --> 08:57.080]  originally Mary Beth Buchanan or Mary Beth loose loose cannon as I call her
[08:57.080 --> 09:02.840]  she they raided the warehouse where the film is was being kept and they
[09:02.840 --> 09:10.440]  confiscated somewhere like 10,000 copies of the aka Tommy Chong and and they
[09:10.440 --> 09:15.240]  told Matt Stevens the distributor of the film that they were doing a
[09:15.240 --> 09:22.440]  preliminary seizure and and he asked well you know how long will this
[09:22.440 --> 09:26.760]  invest you know when when can we get our stuff back or what's going on and they
[09:26.760 --> 09:32.200]  said well the investigation after the investigation and they asked him how
[09:32.200 --> 09:38.720]  long would the investigation take and they said upwards to 15 years so it
[09:38.720 --> 09:41.720]  doesn't look like they're getting those 10,000 copies back today did they give
[09:41.720 --> 09:46.440]  a reason why they did that or no no because they could it's a preliminary
[09:46.440 --> 09:50.840]  seizure so they can't really tell you why they're seasoned hard our property
[09:50.840 --> 09:54.080]  well that's really nice of them I actually have Josh Gilbert and Matt
[09:54.080 --> 09:58.960]  Stevens of aka Tommy Chong on the line let's bring those guys up Josh Matt are
[09:58.960 --> 10:03.640]  you with me I'm here this is Matt okay is Josh with me too awesome so why don't
[10:03.640 --> 10:07.080]  you guys tell me what happened I hear you guys got raided and your product was
[10:07.080 --> 10:13.000]  actually taken away yeah you know we've done to give you a brief history here
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.480]  Tommy and I did a little business back together in the 90s so naturally we're
[10:18.480 --> 10:23.960]  guilty by association where he was the spokesperson for our products and then
[10:23.960 --> 10:31.800]  as you know Tommy's vaults events unfolded with the operation pipe dreams
[10:31.800 --> 10:35.600]  you know Josh made a very fine documentary on it and then brought it to
[10:35.600 --> 10:39.320]  us to say hey why don't you help us distribute this and we said sure I'd
[10:39.320 --> 10:45.200]  love to so we released the documentary eight weeks ago and there's about a
[10:45.200 --> 10:51.000]  ten minute clip in there that it focuses on Mary Beth Buchanan and some of her I
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.640]  guess we could call interesting behaviors I mean she's in the Western
[10:55.640 --> 11:00.480]  District of Pennsylvania and there's airplanes crashing in her district with
[11:00.480 --> 11:06.800]  terrorists on them and she's focusing on pornography and bongs and we're at a
[11:06.800 --> 11:11.200]  time of crisis in the country and she's looking at stuff like that so I think
[11:11.200 --> 11:15.840]  it's something that everyone would say hmm that doesn't seem right anyways to
[11:15.840 --> 11:21.400]  make a short story shorter we released the video eight weeks ago which kind of
[11:21.400 --> 11:27.680]  brings some of Mary Beth's actions into light and sure enough eight weeks after
[11:27.680 --> 11:33.760]  release the video we get rated now there is a sealed affidavit somewhere that
[11:33.760 --> 11:40.400]  says what the probable cause is for the raid however the affidavit is sealed and
[11:40.400 --> 11:46.400]  will be sealed as long as there is an investigation and there is no known
[11:46.400 --> 11:52.840]  chronology time frame or whatever to win the investigation will be terminated
[11:52.840 --> 11:56.760]  and this is really odd to me because there's a ton of different marijuana type
[11:56.760 --> 12:00.960]  film documentaries out there I think the latest is super Jaime and that's not
[12:00.960 --> 12:04.200]  getting rated that's not getting taken out it seems like when you try to take a
[12:04.200 --> 12:08.600]  political perspective and expose those that are hypocrites like you just said
[12:08.600 --> 12:12.000]  you know Mary Beth Buchanan in Pennsylvania you know where a plane went
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.680]  down suppose a terrorist took it down it seems like we've turned into the
[12:15.680 --> 12:19.440]  terrorists after 9-11 it seems like you know Patriot acts one and two and even
[12:19.440 --> 12:23.600]  the military commissions act is really there for the US citizen and not so much
[12:23.600 --> 12:28.760]  the spooky terrorist well you know this is Kevin talking you know that your
[12:28.760 --> 12:33.240]  guest on earlier was talking about how people didn't used to fear the police
[12:33.240 --> 12:39.040]  mm-hmm you know I would say that the but the last 37 or so years of the drug
[12:39.040 --> 12:45.120]  war have been a perfect way to change how everyone views police and the drug
[12:45.120 --> 12:49.640]  war is a perfect way of making everybody so we fear the police now it's it's
[12:49.640 --> 12:54.480]  really it's changed the game a while so dumbing down America and you know what
[12:54.480 --> 12:58.920]  other better boogeymen are there that can never be defeated but drugs and
[12:58.920 --> 13:03.080]  terror well how can you ever defeat drugs or terror there's no way to do
[13:03.080 --> 13:06.000]  those things so it's a perfect it's a perfect you know
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.560]  I upon us yeah it's a perfect ongoing war and a perfect way to get funding again
[13:10.560 --> 13:14.320]  and again and again and again and then I would say even even another aspect of
[13:14.320 --> 13:18.520]  this is when they jail these people for nonviolent drug crimes they're in these
[13:18.520 --> 13:21.360]  prisons working for privatized corporations at about thirty nine
[13:21.360 --> 13:25.760]  cents an hour sometimes doing telemarketing it's a perfect scam they
[13:25.760 --> 13:30.160]  they make money coming and going and every which way in between Tommy what
[13:30.160 --> 13:35.320]  what's your view on the war on terror right now and the war on terror yes well
[13:35.320 --> 13:44.680]  obviously it was manufactured you know purposely you're inadvertently by by
[13:44.680 --> 13:49.560]  this administration or by the Republican Party in order to keep in order
[13:49.560 --> 13:53.840]  first of all in order to get them elected and second of all in order to keep
[13:53.840 --> 13:57.960]  their their cronies that are making millions and billions of dollars off
[13:57.960 --> 14:04.880]  that keep the money is made with chaos whenever there's chaos or martial law
[14:04.880 --> 14:12.560]  you know declared then these huge corporations can come in and just rape
[14:12.560 --> 14:19.320]  and pillage the villages without opposition in fact they do it under the
[14:19.320 --> 14:25.640]  guise of you know being trying to create law and order you know like
[14:25.640 --> 14:33.520]  they like they try to create peace in in Iraq so it gives you an idea you know
[14:33.520 --> 14:39.040]  and then like like Matt said or the other Kevin said you know this is the
[14:39.040 --> 14:45.800]  perfect way to keep the the you know the the criminals in action you know it's
[14:45.800 --> 14:53.280]  wrapped in the pantry is what I call it you know and and so I feel you know what
[14:53.280 --> 14:59.440]  I learned it in prison is is that the universe is perfect and for every
[14:59.440 --> 15:02.920]  action there's a reaction it's called karma whatever you want to call it and
[15:02.920 --> 15:08.400]  so what we're gonna witness here what we witnessed with the George Bush you know
[15:08.400 --> 15:13.440]  time in office we saw how the universe just played with them you know with
[15:13.440 --> 15:18.120]  Katrina with the war with you know all these you know with it with Dick
[15:18.120 --> 15:22.920]  Cheney shooting his friend in the face with a shotgun all these all these
[15:22.920 --> 15:28.360]  things are the universe acting against these guys you know because that's the
[15:28.360 --> 15:31.800]  way it works so you like Kevin would probably say that you don't see any
[15:31.800 --> 15:39.040]  and insight for the war on terror or the war on drugs me yeah yeah I'm saying
[15:39.040 --> 15:42.280]  I'm saying Tommy did you see an end in that insight Kevin said he doesn't see
[15:42.280 --> 15:47.400]  an end in sight why he didn't say yeah oh yeah it's all sides it's a cycle
[15:47.400 --> 15:52.840]  absolutely absolutely I see it coming you know nothing lasts forever you know
[15:52.840 --> 15:57.280]  the peace and prosperity doesn't last forever you know Obama won't last forever
[15:57.280 --> 16:02.440]  no one lasts forever and and nor George Bush definitely you know his time is is
[16:02.440 --> 16:07.520]  not only numbered but but he you know him and his boys broke international law
[16:07.520 --> 16:11.800]  and so they won't be able to travel outside of the US with the risk of
[16:11.800 --> 16:17.680]  being arrested so so we all yeah karma is is a bitch boy and when it comes down
[16:17.680 --> 16:23.680]  on you it comes down on you and and and that's what kept me going you know while
[16:23.680 --> 16:28.480]  I was in jail I just used that time you know to to write a book and to become
[16:28.480 --> 16:33.160]  an activist and to to let you know travel around the country and to show
[16:33.160 --> 16:38.320]  people like Mary Beth Buchanan you know her actions you know I mean it's done
[16:38.320 --> 16:43.480]  secretly and but I'm going to be on every major talk show you know just
[16:43.480 --> 16:47.920]  talking about it talking about it until until you know I'm embarrassed the
[16:47.920 --> 16:51.680]  government so much that that they did they're just going to have to knuckle
[16:51.680 --> 16:58.120]  under and and and give up this stupid attitude they have well I hope you're
[16:58.120 --> 17:01.600]  correct Josh Matt where can you get the movie now that it's been rated is there
[17:01.600 --> 17:06.440]  another place that we're going to be able to get aka Tommy Chong I yeah you
[17:06.440 --> 17:15.160]  can still order the additional units that haven't been taken and that website
[17:15.160 --> 17:20.760]  is aka Tommy Chong calm and we can ship you out one excellent excellent go to
[17:20.760 --> 17:27.040]  DEA dot gov and by your copy today well Kevin I mean there's a ton of extras on
[17:27.040 --> 17:30.720]  your American drug war film one of them is a Tommy Chong extra one of them's
[17:30.720 --> 17:35.080]  and Alex Jones extra I think there's even an extra on Joe RP all the uh our
[17:35.080 --> 17:40.360]  pile the sheriff out there as well yes definitely yeah you know and I had to
[17:40.360 --> 17:43.560]  just show that a lot of people say they you know they can't stand watching them
[17:43.560 --> 17:48.880]  but I mean it's important for people to just see the the arrogance you know in
[17:48.880 --> 17:52.760]  these drug warriors and and when you go out there and when I found you know at
[17:52.760 --> 17:55.920]  the four years I spent trying to document the drug war is that most of
[17:55.920 --> 18:00.000]  these pro drug warriors kind of like uh you know like Tommy says they're like
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.600]  rats they scurry away they hide in the shadows so it's it's rare when you find
[18:04.600 --> 18:09.640]  someone who's as pro drug warrior as Joe Arpaio is who's proud to be on the
[18:09.640 --> 18:14.080]  camera and so you know that's why you know it's important for people to see
[18:14.080 --> 18:19.560]  that face and to hear him talking just the the level of self-righteousness and
[18:19.560 --> 18:25.000]  just the denial of hypocrisy just like what we're seeing right now in this
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.800]  massive San Diego bust where now something like 250 students aren't
[18:28.800 --> 18:33.080]  going to be graduating all because one girl OD on cocaine well I looked it up
[18:33.080 --> 18:36.160]  and you know the hazing death I mean you know many students die from hazing
[18:36.160 --> 18:40.720]  every year so once again it's it's okay if you die from alcohol it's okay if you
[18:40.720 --> 18:43.960]  die from cigarettes certainly okay if you die from any number of pharmaceuticals
[18:43.960 --> 18:48.000]  but when someone dies from illegal drugs like oh my god you know it's time to
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.120]  just start throwing everybody in prison yeah and throwing him in prison into
[18:51.120 --> 18:55.880]  someone like Arpaio who wants to dress them up in a pink prison jumpsuit and I
[18:55.880 --> 18:59.040]  think it says something like I was a drug addict on it put on a chain gang
[18:59.040 --> 19:03.080]  really dehumanizes his prisoners at least from what I've seen I mean that's
[19:03.080 --> 19:08.120]  all over the place they did that in the prison this time in China I was that
[19:08.120 --> 19:12.520]  you know the dehumanizing people they had a transvestite that still had her
[19:12.520 --> 19:20.520]  her penis but she had breasts and and so she was like a a nautity in in an
[19:20.520 --> 19:29.240]  ugliest sin by the way and he or she had a nautity you know she was not in the
[19:29.240 --> 19:33.360]  main prison so what they did they dressed her up in it you know in a pink
[19:33.360 --> 19:38.040]  you know that thought Tommy we're gonna come back right after this it's the

[24:29.920 --> 24:33.640]  Bermas I just want to let everybody know that they will catch a sneak peek of
[24:33.640 --> 24:38.800]  Alex's latest film the 9-11 Chronicles part one truth rising over at the Alamo
[24:38.800 --> 24:44.400]  draft house on Saturday May 17th at 4 p.m. Sunday May 18th 7 p.m. we're talking
[24:44.400 --> 24:47.600]  to Tommy Chong right now and before we get back to the prison and
[24:47.600 --> 24:51.880]  dehumanization Tommy you mentioned how these people like to create order out of
[24:51.880 --> 24:55.360]  chaos and I just have to ask you because a lot of people have talked about this
[24:55.360 --> 24:59.480]  on this program what's your view on 9-11 we've had people like Willie Nelson
[24:59.480 --> 25:03.600]  Jesse Ventura you know senators congressman come on and doubt the
[25:03.600 --> 25:06.160]  official version do you doubt the official version of 9-11
[25:06.160 --> 25:10.360]  chomp oh absolutely absolutely there there are so many horror stories about
[25:10.360 --> 25:16.680]  9-11 that have been been kept quiet that you know I mean it'll be like the
[25:16.680 --> 25:21.200]  Kennedy assassination you know years later we'll find out the truth absolutely
[25:21.200 --> 25:23.960]  well what do you think some of the biggest inconsistencies in the official
[25:23.960 --> 25:30.040]  version are well the biggest inconsistency is the fact that who was
[25:30.040 --> 25:35.560]  allowed to fly after everything was shut down it was the Ben Lodin's
[25:35.560 --> 25:39.320]  you know yeah absolutely I mean they blame this guy and then they let the
[25:39.320 --> 25:43.360]  family go yeah while everybody else is grounded yeah it would have been great to
[25:43.360 --> 25:48.360]  have them to ask them some questions or to torture them actually you know once
[25:48.360 --> 25:53.840]  once you know we got bush you know they got the torture thing under under his
[25:53.840 --> 25:57.240]  belt well what interests me is this week they actually reported that everybody
[25:57.240 --> 26:01.320]  who was involved in the USS coal bombing again it's supposedly al-Qaeda the big
[26:01.320 --> 26:05.160]  boogeyman was let go in Yemen and you would think of this terrorism threat was
[26:05.160 --> 26:09.360]  real these are the guys that would be in Abu Ghraib and Gitmo Tommy yeah yeah
[26:09.360 --> 26:13.560]  well see you see that's how it works you know and that's the way it worked in
[26:13.560 --> 26:18.240]  prison by the way it's the same same system that they have you know that's
[26:18.240 --> 26:24.320]  why you know the the powers that be here they're perverting justice and we get
[26:24.320 --> 26:28.680]  outraged you know because you know we we believe in the Constitution and and
[26:28.680 --> 26:34.640]  all that but there's even there was even reports about Pearl Harbor being a
[26:34.640 --> 26:39.160]  setup being a setup at least they knew that it was coming and they could have
[26:39.160 --> 26:44.440]  done a lot more than what they did to stop it absolutely and I mean it's
[26:44.440 --> 26:48.720]  pretty much needed they needed Pearl Harbor in order to launch you know the
[26:48.720 --> 26:53.680]  bigger war and and that was the same as 9-11 it wasn't for 9-11 we wouldn't have
[26:53.680 --> 26:57.640]  had bush in the White House well I agree with you there and then you have the
[26:57.640 --> 27:01.280]  project for a new American Century which is this neocon think tank including
[27:01.280 --> 27:05.560]  Cheney and Wolfewitz and people like Dan Quill where they actually call for this
[27:05.560 --> 27:09.320]  new new Pearl Harbor in a document called rebuilding America's defenses
[27:09.320 --> 27:13.960]  only three months before the attacks where they say they need it in order to
[27:13.960 --> 27:19.920]  transform the Middle East or Eurasia yeah yeah and it's all and it's all to
[27:19.920 --> 27:26.000]  to subvert and to to get the national you know to get the oil you know to get
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.440]  their hands on the oil not not so not because we don't have oil of our own
[27:30.440 --> 27:36.040]  no it's to control the world's supply of oil and that's basically what's what's
[27:36.040 --> 27:41.400]  happened and and this is what this is why I'm saying the universe is so perfect
[27:41.400 --> 27:47.120]  because you know the the the oil prices and that have just forced people to go
[27:47.120 --> 27:50.840]  to the electric car and now Toyota is the biggest car maker
[27:50.840 --> 27:55.840]  manufacturer in the world because they have a hybrid and we're and we have the
[27:55.840 --> 28:00.360]  technology to to have full-on electric cars and eventually we will have to
[28:00.360 --> 28:04.560]  have them because there you know we will no one will be able to afford the gas
[28:04.560 --> 28:11.280]  cars and and so see no matter what these guys do you know eventually the you
[28:11.280 --> 28:15.520]  know that it balances out well my view is this I mean the last two years the
[28:15.520 --> 28:19.560]  oil companies have posted record profits obviously there's no shortage of oil
[28:19.560 --> 28:23.920]  what they've done is they've gone in they've taken over the second richest
[28:23.920 --> 28:27.440]  oil nation in the world Iraq and because they control the supply they can
[28:27.440 --> 28:30.640]  demand as much money as they like and that's why we're seeing four dollar a
[28:30.640 --> 28:34.520]  gallon oil and soon to see five dollar gallon oil this summer absolutely and
[28:34.520 --> 28:38.600]  and but what it does it forces it's just like the food shortage you know we have
[28:38.600 --> 28:43.560]  two problems in in in America we have we're getting a food shortage and we
[28:43.560 --> 28:47.720]  have obesity problems so it's sort of even to solve out you know well those
[28:47.720 --> 28:50.960]  are two subjects we actually do talk about a lot on this show I mean food
[28:50.960 --> 28:54.040]  shortages are a lot of people don't understand that the gas also jacks up the
[28:54.040 --> 28:56.600]  price of food because this uh... the supplies are shipped throughout the
[28:56.600 --> 28:59.840]  country you know and we're just being raped over and over again
[28:59.840 --> 29:02.960]  on only the gas prices but our food prices as well
[29:02.960 --> 29:07.360]  so you see a lot of modes of control do you do you fear that they might
[29:07.360 --> 29:10.740]  uh... carry out yet another attack for more control in this country
[29:10.740 --> 29:13.560]  well it's going to be difficult for them to do that
[29:13.560 --> 29:17.440]  you know uh... you know you can't uh... you know it's like telling the same joke
[29:17.440 --> 29:20.480]  twice you know uh... people are ready
[29:20.480 --> 29:23.640]  you know and so there's going to be citizens uh... that
[29:23.640 --> 29:29.520]  you know that will blow the whistle or you know alert them like there was that
[29:29.520 --> 29:33.320]  FBI agent in in milwaukee that knew about the uh...
[29:33.320 --> 29:37.280]  uh... that one terrorist okay all right hold on one minute Tommy we'll be back

[33:27.280 --> 33:29.240]  great job i just want to make a point
[33:29.240 --> 33:32.880]  asked how much of a question and i'll throw it back to all you guys first off
[33:32.880 --> 33:34.380]  all i think how much on
[33:34.380 --> 33:37.200]  i think that i think that the other filmmakers
[33:37.200 --> 33:39.200]  for coming on i just want to say this
[33:39.200 --> 33:43.000]  silica still all the d a agent expose government drug dealing
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.480]  uh... you know in front line the rest of the also in kevin's film he was just
[33:46.480 --> 33:47.400]  rated
[33:47.400 --> 33:49.360]  tommy has now been rated
[33:49.360 --> 33:52.720]  i believe this is political punishment because this film
[33:52.720 --> 33:55.160]  as they're more than fifty times on showtime
[33:55.160 --> 33:58.120]  i'm hearing but all over the street folks you know i don't
[33:58.120 --> 33:59.720]  say i'm hearing but i'm not
[33:59.720 --> 34:01.600]  i'm hearing huge buzz
[34:01.600 --> 34:04.320]  for american drug war i think it made a mad
[34:04.320 --> 34:07.240]  that that tommy stood back up to them so they went after him
[34:07.240 --> 34:10.560]  uh... that said that mister chong do you think that they're
[34:10.560 --> 34:14.280]  targeting you or is your gut tell you they're coming after you because you
[34:14.280 --> 34:17.280]  didn't take a raping without speaking up against it
[34:17.280 --> 34:22.120]  yeah absolutely absolutely you know they they try to write out of the clause in
[34:22.120 --> 34:22.760]  my
[34:22.760 --> 34:26.840]  uh... you know punishment that i i'm not supposed to profit from uh...
[34:26.840 --> 34:29.160]  my crime in any way
[34:29.160 --> 34:32.520]  and uh... if i were to take them literally then i wouldn't be able to do
[34:32.520 --> 34:35.160]  my stand-up routine i wouldn't be able to
[34:35.160 --> 34:37.480]  work so i just i asked my lawyer
[34:37.480 --> 34:41.280]  and they said that you know they can't do anything you know they just ignore it
[34:41.280 --> 34:43.240]  so i i that's what i've been doing
[34:43.240 --> 34:45.880]  and so this is the result you know
[34:45.880 --> 34:49.520]  well that happen i'm to claim that you incredibly famous icon
[34:49.520 --> 34:51.400]  need to profit from them ruining
[34:51.400 --> 34:53.840]  you're completely legitimate family business
[34:53.840 --> 34:56.080]  but you weren't even really completely involved in
[34:56.080 --> 34:58.800]  while they ship the drugs and again it's just like terror
[34:58.800 --> 35:01.800]  they ship the majority and they only bus cartels
[35:01.800 --> 35:04.720]  they don't pay the cut into their bank just like scarface
[35:04.720 --> 35:06.920]  that's based on true story the part with the banks
[35:06.920 --> 35:09.880]  laundering the money the same thing they organize the terror
[35:09.880 --> 35:13.880]  they provocateur the terror they foster the terror they stage the terror and i
[35:13.880 --> 35:14.880]  want to say that
[35:14.880 --> 35:16.920]  i'm so honored that we've had
[35:16.920 --> 35:19.000]  congressman and charlie sheen
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.720]  and you know uh... jesse ventura and willy nelson
[35:22.720 --> 35:26.040]  and all and the german defense minister and all these people
[35:26.040 --> 35:29.120]  on the show and i don't have tommy chung come out on the show and say that
[35:29.120 --> 35:31.480]  he questions of the official story i mean
[35:31.480 --> 35:35.560]  just so your statement is clear are are are you saying you believe that they
[35:35.560 --> 35:37.440]  use it to take our liberties
[35:37.440 --> 35:41.240]  uh... or you saying that on top of it you believe that they may have
[35:41.240 --> 35:44.880]  somehow been involved i mean you know with the buildings being blown up uh...
[35:44.880 --> 35:45.480]  the
[35:45.480 --> 35:46.280]  uh... yeah
[35:46.280 --> 35:49.320]  the hijacking drill that day the government was running i mean
[35:49.320 --> 35:51.440]  bottom line what do you think about nine eleven
[35:51.440 --> 35:56.120]  well yeah you just said it right there and then thing is and you know i you could
[35:56.120 --> 35:59.760]  speculate but you don't have to speculate with fax these are cold hard
[35:59.760 --> 36:03.960]  fax the fax that the ben rodin family was allowed to escape
[36:03.960 --> 36:07.040]  uh... america i mean that's a fact
[36:07.040 --> 36:08.640]  but the fact that uh...
[36:08.640 --> 36:12.280]  that the certain people were weren't in the buildings that kind of knew the
[36:12.280 --> 36:15.080]  buildings were going to go down that's a fact
[36:15.080 --> 36:17.480]  and there's all these facts and and just like that
[36:17.480 --> 36:20.160]  there's there's a fact of of of the fireman
[36:20.160 --> 36:24.000]  you know why the firemen were were saving each other you know we have when
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.400]  they found a uh... dead fireman
[36:26.400 --> 36:30.320]  that only firemen were allowed to to uh... rescue the body
[36:30.320 --> 36:34.480]  you know and there's a book out there about that or why why that is i won't
[36:34.480 --> 36:35.080]  even
[36:35.080 --> 36:36.560]  say on the air why
[36:36.560 --> 36:39.040]  that only firemen were allowed
[36:39.040 --> 36:40.480]  because i don't want to
[36:40.480 --> 36:45.040]  i want people to read for themselves you know so so google or whatever you can
[36:45.040 --> 36:47.880]  the new york fireman that we're at the world trade center
[36:47.880 --> 36:49.800]  and there's these are fax
[36:49.800 --> 36:53.000]  and so i'd i'd i'm i'm not one for speculating
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.800]  absolutely tommy what do you think about building seven
[36:55.800 --> 36:59.840]  not hit by a plane but perfectly imploding we have video police firemen
[36:59.840 --> 37:00.920]  other saying
[37:00.920 --> 37:04.480]  the government says get back we're gonna bring it down if you've seen that
[37:04.480 --> 37:08.440]  i know i haven't seen that one but i i i can't believe that you know
[37:08.440 --> 37:11.520]  definitely well well absolutely just one more point
[37:11.520 --> 37:12.040]  bush
[37:12.040 --> 37:15.600]  finally ordered to attack afghanistan the day before nine eleven
[37:15.600 --> 37:17.280]  and had to aircraft carriers
[37:17.280 --> 37:19.480]  and forty four thousand u s troops
[37:19.480 --> 37:22.080]  master outage because they have to be a stand
[37:22.080 --> 37:24.800]  to invade afghanistan you don't set up an invasion
[37:24.800 --> 37:25.880]  in one day
[37:25.880 --> 37:27.920]  no no that takes uh...
[37:27.920 --> 37:31.320]  uh... six months at least and even more longer
[37:31.320 --> 37:34.440]  yeah that's a lot the logistics just like they say they can't
[37:34.440 --> 37:35.720]  remove the troops
[37:35.720 --> 37:36.960]  in one day
[37:36.960 --> 37:41.960]  you know it's all setting him up is is even harder you know you know absolutely
[37:41.960 --> 37:46.960]  all yeah we we we are in the midst of of a big big big uh...
[37:46.960 --> 37:51.080]  thing and and and history is going to happen you know we're we're we're lucky
[37:51.080 --> 37:54.200]  we're lucky we're living through a very exciting part of our
[37:54.200 --> 37:55.760]  uh... of our history
[37:55.760 --> 37:57.440]  we're living at a time when it's all
[37:57.440 --> 37:59.480]  coming out i mean the shooter
[37:59.480 --> 38:01.720]  the commander of killing jfk
[38:01.720 --> 38:05.280]  on his death bed admitted with a cover rolling stone that we got the video
[38:05.280 --> 38:06.440]  of his father
[38:06.440 --> 38:09.080]  uh... saint john father he ordered meeting
[38:09.080 --> 38:11.920]  what we always knew he was photographing picked up is
[38:11.920 --> 38:15.240]  one of the trap so now the jfk thing is admitted well in closing i want to
[38:15.240 --> 38:16.320]  throw you back to
[38:16.320 --> 38:19.240]  uh... kevin booth and of course it's a promise the rest of folks we could put
[38:19.240 --> 38:20.080]  major
[38:20.080 --> 38:22.800]  pressure on these guys to drop these
[38:22.800 --> 38:26.760]  uh... you know the selectively enforced charges but just in closing the war on
[38:26.760 --> 38:30.400]  drugs started in the seventies there's triple the heroin double the cocaine now
[38:30.400 --> 38:31.440]  that there was
[38:31.440 --> 38:34.320]  our police are militarized we have more people in prison
[38:34.320 --> 38:36.080]  than any other country in the world
[38:36.080 --> 38:39.000]  everybody knows they control it we've got it in this
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.360]  war on drugs now and you'll be remembered
[38:41.360 --> 38:43.920]  as really an alexander shelter needs uh...
[38:43.920 --> 38:47.320]  in the fight against this tyranny or as a nelson mandela
[38:47.320 --> 38:48.720]  uh... for the political

[39:07.400 --> 39:09.440]  thank you sir take care guys
[39:09.440 --> 39:12.840]  all right so tommy what do you think that uh... that we can do to put pressure
[39:12.840 --> 39:15.160]  on those who have taken up
[39:15.160 --> 39:19.200]  matt and josh's videos a k tommy chong what can we do to support you is there
[39:19.200 --> 39:21.840]  is there a website is there is there something we can do
[39:21.840 --> 39:27.160]  our listeners can do the best support would be to buy the the uh... dvd
[39:27.160 --> 39:28.760]  that's the best support
[39:28.760 --> 39:30.400]  because uh... you know
[39:30.400 --> 39:33.480]  but what they've done you know they've heard us financially uh... as they
[39:33.480 --> 39:34.600]  always do
[39:34.600 --> 39:36.840]  and and what they're trying to do again is
[39:36.840 --> 39:41.040]  is to get us to lawyer up so we can have that expense going
[39:41.040 --> 39:43.520]  you know so the best anybody could do
[39:43.520 --> 39:47.760]  is just what i'm doing i'm going out and i'm working on doing my gigs you know
[39:47.760 --> 39:50.440]  uh... i'll be in san francisco next weekend
[39:50.440 --> 39:57.280]  uh... i i i'm i just want everybody to be aware of a k a tommy chong dot com
[39:57.280 --> 40:03.440]  and uh... get on that website and and by by the by the the the the product that
[40:03.440 --> 40:05.000]  that's the best revenge
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.600]  yeah absolutely i mean one of the things that i've done with the american drug war
[40:08.600 --> 40:11.320]  is not only that i sit down and watch it with my girlfriend
[40:11.320 --> 40:15.080]  but i also sat down and watch it with my thirteen-year-old sister
[40:15.080 --> 40:18.280]  and i said look you know this is really how it is
[40:18.280 --> 40:21.160]  and she watched and she's just like you know that makes a lot more sense than
[40:21.160 --> 40:22.480]  what they're telling us and
[40:22.480 --> 40:26.120]  you know why is it that uh... we have you know triple the heroin double the
[40:26.120 --> 40:27.320]  cocaine on the streets
[40:27.320 --> 40:30.120]  i mean kevin your your film really lays it out
[40:30.120 --> 40:35.840]  that yet they they use dupes like ricky ross the funnel in their drugs
[40:35.840 --> 40:39.720]  absolutely but i'd like to just start by saying that that i uh... you know i had
[40:39.720 --> 40:42.880]  the pleasure of seeing the a k a tommy chong film
[40:42.880 --> 40:46.920]  uh... several months ago and it's an incredible film it uh...
[40:46.920 --> 40:48.300]  it's a much more
[40:48.300 --> 40:52.840]  personal view than my film is that i definitely recommend anybody that uh...
[40:52.840 --> 40:55.880]  gotten anything out of watching american drug war which you can get an american
[40:55.880 --> 40:57.320]  drug war dot com
[40:57.320 --> 41:01.400]  uh... i definitely definitely recommend that you go to a k a tommy chong dot
[41:01.400 --> 41:04.640]  com right now and get a copy of that dvd before the government takes the rest
[41:04.640 --> 41:06.480]  of them but uh...
[41:06.480 --> 41:09.880]  no you're right and you know making making do that of ricky ross but it's
[41:09.880 --> 41:11.640]  also important to uh...
[41:11.640 --> 41:15.080]  to factor in the whole pharmaceutical complex on this deal
[41:15.080 --> 41:16.280]  uh... sixty minutes
[41:16.280 --> 41:18.640]  ran a story about a bear drug
[41:18.640 --> 41:22.760]  that is responsible in it and the f d a has known that the dot drug called
[41:22.760 --> 41:24.720]  tyrodol teradol
[41:24.720 --> 41:28.720]  has been killing literally thousands of people a month it's a drug that they
[41:28.720 --> 41:30.720]  use during open heart surgery
[41:30.720 --> 41:32.360]  and yet they allow that
[41:32.360 --> 41:35.840]  now those people you know they're not going to get charged with domestic
[41:35.840 --> 41:38.280]  terrorism even though they're responsible for
[41:38.280 --> 41:39.440]  for more death
[41:39.440 --> 41:42.480]  per year than all illegal drugs combined
[41:42.480 --> 41:45.560]  meanwhile they're locking up people putting them in prison work camps for
[41:45.560 --> 41:47.160]  growing a plant
[41:47.160 --> 41:50.400]  the plant which by the way like you know was part of the founding of this
[41:50.400 --> 41:51.800]  country uh...
[41:51.800 --> 41:54.680]  a plant that has been used medicinally for
[41:54.680 --> 41:58.920]  and the thousands of years and and it's a very important factor of why marijuana
[41:58.920 --> 42:01.520]  is that the nexus of this whole thing
[42:01.520 --> 42:04.880]  because if they take marijuana out of the drug war equation there's just not
[42:04.880 --> 42:06.120]  enough
[42:06.120 --> 42:10.040]  of uh... you know harrowing cocaine ecstasy crystal meth and all that to
[42:10.040 --> 42:11.360]  keep this whole
[42:11.360 --> 42:13.640]  drug war prison complex
[42:13.640 --> 42:14.600]  afloat
[42:14.600 --> 42:17.880]  because eighty five percent of all illegal drug users
[42:17.880 --> 42:19.880]  only smoke marijuana
[42:19.880 --> 42:23.720]  and so that's why marijuana has to be kept schedule one and that's that's that's
[42:23.720 --> 42:27.620]  one of the biggest and that i would you know hope to be changed in my lifetime
[42:27.620 --> 42:31.320]  along with the legalization of uh... medical marijuana across the board but
[42:31.320 --> 42:34.360]  we have to get marijuana taken out of schedule one
[42:34.360 --> 42:36.520]  i'm with you there but it'll be harder
[42:36.520 --> 42:40.480]  for them to push their brave new world on the society if they do that i mean
[42:40.480 --> 42:44.360]  they've got the people so drugged up on things like prosaq and riddling
[42:44.360 --> 42:45.760]  it is almost like
[42:45.760 --> 42:49.240]  people are walking through society and like a consumerist days
[42:49.240 --> 42:52.560]  you know you wonder why you know the mall culture is so big and why people
[42:52.560 --> 42:54.760]  don't really know what's going on in this country it's because they're on
[42:54.760 --> 42:55.520]  riddling
[42:55.520 --> 42:58.920]  and i'm i'm at the point you're i'm sitting there i'm here and and and
[42:58.920 --> 43:02.840]  Beverly Hills going hey well honey look at the only four dollars and sixty

[43:08.920 --> 43:11.080]  venezuela
[43:11.080 --> 43:13.760]  you know the same with like pharmaceutical and health care in canada and
[43:13.760 --> 43:16.320]  other countries just like the michael more film
[43:16.320 --> 43:20.480]  pointed out i mean as americans were being raped in every direction now
[43:20.480 --> 43:22.600]  absolutely tommy what what's your uh...
[43:22.600 --> 43:26.040]  what's your view on the the general populace right now are they just
[43:26.040 --> 43:29.320]  totally in the days are they coming around what what do you think
[43:29.320 --> 43:33.480]  well there's always a percentage you know i i look at it like like me in the
[43:33.480 --> 43:34.880]  music world you know
[43:34.880 --> 43:38.760]  the the people that are turned on are like jazz lovers you know they're they're
[43:38.760 --> 43:40.360]  the tip of the iceberg
[43:40.360 --> 43:41.960]  and and then it goes down
[43:41.960 --> 43:46.920]  uh... during the sixties we we had uh... you know there's a massive turn on
[43:46.920 --> 43:51.400]  uh... of of people and then slowly you know that he wrote it you know went back
[43:51.400 --> 43:52.760]  to the alcohol
[43:52.760 --> 43:56.280]  fueled uh... uh... you know good old boy kind of thing
[43:56.280 --> 43:59.200]  and uh... i i i feel that uh...
[43:59.200 --> 44:03.120]  uh... you know the world you know the you know again the universe is perfect
[44:03.120 --> 44:07.200]  we're going to uh... uh... uh... uh... and then enlightenment
[44:07.200 --> 44:10.360]  you know and right now we're talking to people that are on the
[44:10.360 --> 44:13.400]  the panel right now where were were the
[44:13.400 --> 44:16.440]  you know we're ahead of everybody were the leaders and
[44:16.440 --> 44:17.520]  and but there's
[44:17.520 --> 44:20.200]  there's millions of people out there
[44:20.200 --> 44:24.280]  that are looking for the truth and and you know
[44:24.280 --> 44:28.280]  uh... they obviously can't find it with with religion you know religion is
[44:28.280 --> 44:30.320]  another controlling mind
[44:30.320 --> 44:33.580]  set you know to could use to control people to uh...
[44:33.580 --> 44:35.280]  get them to do their bidding
[44:35.280 --> 44:39.280]  that that was the thing about marijuana marijuana gives you a choice
[44:39.280 --> 44:41.920]  and i do it did do this in my show i said
[44:41.920 --> 44:43.820]  for the first time user
[44:43.820 --> 44:47.120]  that feeling you get that kind of scares you
[44:47.120 --> 44:50.440]  it's called an original thought
[44:50.440 --> 44:53.240]  you know if the thought that comes from
[44:53.240 --> 44:58.000]  within it doesn't come from television or your teacher or your parents or is
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.240]  the eight it's an original thought
[45:00.240 --> 45:02.040]  and and enough people
[45:02.040 --> 45:06.120]  uh... are coming around you know that that that has
[45:06.120 --> 45:10.040]  though those thoughts and you can tell by the consumers you can tell by how many
[45:10.040 --> 45:15.960]  people are buying priuses you know so so my my my my view was very very
[45:15.960 --> 45:20.240]  optimistic very optimistic because this again you know this is the perfect
[45:20.240 --> 45:21.520]  planet we live on
[45:21.520 --> 45:25.720]  and and do we we can't we think we can damage it but we can't
[45:25.720 --> 45:29.360]  it's it would you look at the tsunamis and you look at the cyclones
[45:29.360 --> 45:31.680]  you know nature wants to wipe us all out
[45:31.680 --> 45:33.480]  made nature will do that
[45:33.480 --> 45:37.480]  and and if it gets to that point that that's exactly what'll happen but the
[45:37.480 --> 45:40.960]  people that are left the people you know the meek she'll inherit the earth and
[45:40.960 --> 45:42.360]  that's us
[45:42.360 --> 45:43.960]  well i hope you're right i mean
[45:43.960 --> 45:47.760]  i gotta tell you the way i look at the ruling class really doesn't want informed
[45:47.760 --> 45:50.480]  populace that's what they're working against
[45:50.480 --> 45:54.160]  and uh... we don't have really uh... a massive informed populace like you said
[45:54.160 --> 45:55.120]  we are the
[45:55.120 --> 45:58.000]  we are the leaders we are the the top of the food chain right now trying to
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.920]  inform others and that's why i think
[45:59.920 --> 46:04.040]  people need to see films like a k a tommy chong american drug war you know
[46:04.040 --> 46:05.520]  alex jones is a game
[46:05.520 --> 46:09.080]  uh... my film loose change final cut because they do open your mind
[46:09.080 --> 46:11.760]  and you can share them with others and then you can create a change in this
[46:11.760 --> 46:12.440]  country
[46:12.440 --> 46:16.720]  yeah yeah and and and by the way what there would be no need
[46:16.720 --> 46:18.960]  for for our activism
[46:18.960 --> 46:20.340]  if if they never
[46:20.340 --> 46:23.060]  rated our warehouse for instance you know
[46:23.060 --> 46:27.000]  if they never rated our warehouse we we wouldn't we would be limping along
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.240]  trying to convince people that there's a boogeyman
[46:30.240 --> 46:32.280]  and and uh... but now
[46:32.280 --> 46:36.400]  that's that's how it works you know good old mary best loose cannon you know
[46:36.400 --> 46:37.520]  she come in there
[46:37.520 --> 46:40.680]  and she just keeps this uh... a k a uh...
[46:40.680 --> 46:44.360]  a film alive and and well and it's going to go
[46:44.360 --> 46:48.240]  uh... all all over the country because when you tell people they're not supposed
[46:48.240 --> 46:49.400]  to see something
[46:49.400 --> 46:51.440]  that's when they want to see it
[46:51.440 --> 46:55.040]  absolutely can i ask josh we haven't heard from josh josh can you tell us
[46:55.040 --> 46:59.640]  about mary best relationship to the drugs are john walters
[46:59.640 --> 47:00.360]  uh...
[47:00.360 --> 47:01.960]  uh... can you
[47:01.960 --> 47:05.720]  uh... well i mean it's a pretty specific but i mean she she worked
[47:05.720 --> 47:09.440]  alongside of a mommy wasn't what weren't the two of them kind of together in
[47:09.440 --> 47:12.640]  that operation pipe dreams i just think it's also interesting if you could
[47:12.640 --> 47:13.960]  comment about how
[47:13.960 --> 47:17.120]  operation pipe dreams will just sounds like the chichin chong movie that we
[47:17.120 --> 47:19.040]  ever got to see
[47:19.040 --> 47:22.720]  well what it was it was striking to me when it happened i mean i could
[47:22.720 --> 47:26.160]  coming i go go back quite a few years and what i
[47:26.160 --> 47:29.920]  when i saw the cnn crawl announcing it because i knew tommy and and and and
[47:29.920 --> 47:31.480]  cheats were reuniting
[47:31.480 --> 47:34.040]  and looking for the perfect publicity stunt
[47:34.040 --> 47:37.080]  you know when i saw the crawl i thought might you know this is gotta be a
[47:37.080 --> 47:38.640]  publicity stunt
[47:38.640 --> 47:42.320]  and and and and actually when i talk to mat the other day and you know and he
[47:42.320 --> 47:44.400]  sounded a little winded in
[47:44.400 --> 47:45.640]  sort of uh...
[47:45.640 --> 47:48.240]  you know kind of shell shocked obviously
[47:48.240 --> 47:53.480]  having had his warehouse stormtrooper you know by these swat team commandos
[47:53.480 --> 47:57.040]  i thought it and i thought this is gotta be a publicity stunt
[47:57.040 --> 48:00.240]  you know mat engineered the perfect publicity stunt so that people would
[48:00.240 --> 48:02.560]  know about a k a tommy chong
[48:02.560 --> 48:05.360]  because it's just too weird you know and and
[48:05.360 --> 48:09.320]  and eric schloser the writer of fast food nation you know says in the dock he
[48:09.320 --> 48:12.680]  says you know what happened to tommy under operation pipe dreams and even the
[48:12.680 --> 48:13.720]  name
[48:13.720 --> 48:15.840]  operation pipe dreams it's like that
[48:15.840 --> 48:20.040]  it's like the worst paranoid chichin chong fantasy come to life
[48:20.040 --> 48:24.720]  you know into and tommy's recent you know renaming of mary beth Buchanan
[48:24.720 --> 48:29.240]  mary beth loose cannon you know cast her perfectly as a chichin chong villain
[48:29.240 --> 48:30.720]  and all of this
[48:30.720 --> 48:35.440]  uh... classic and then the fact that and then very best loose cannon i mean it's
[48:35.440 --> 48:38.640]  speaking of fast food to i mean it's just it's just once again i mean more
[48:38.640 --> 48:42.160]  people died as a result of fast food every year
[48:42.160 --> 48:46.640]  far more than probably even heroin cocaine and all the terrible drugs not
[48:46.640 --> 48:48.520]  that that doesn't make those right
[48:48.520 --> 48:51.280]  but it's just the ability to make
[48:51.280 --> 48:54.720]  to turn those types of drugs into the boogie man that has made it such an
[48:54.720 --> 48:58.720]  attractive device for the globalist yeah absolutely it seems like the elitist
[48:58.720 --> 49:02.800]  want to poison us in every way shape and form they possibly can from
[49:02.800 --> 49:05.920]  you know the uh... over-the-counter drugs to the food we eat
[49:05.920 --> 49:09.320]  that are just so full of like fluoride and just
[49:09.320 --> 49:13.200]  aspertame just terrible terrible things it's so processed
[49:13.200 --> 49:17.520]  i mean fast food nation is a is a pretty uh... good flick for a uh...
[49:17.520 --> 49:19.120]  for a uh... fictional film
[49:19.120 --> 49:22.560]  to really show you what i mean as as non-fiction
[49:22.560 --> 49:26.440]  yeah that's that's true that is true i've only seen the the movie with a great
[49:26.440 --> 49:29.920]  career but yet it's it's frightening it's infighting what we put in our body
[49:29.920 --> 49:32.440]  and then you try to put something natural into your body
[49:32.440 --> 49:35.320]  like marijuana and you spend nine months in prison for it
[49:35.320 --> 49:38.280]  and then you make another movie and they take your movie from you
[49:38.280 --> 49:41.080]  uh... and then they say well we don't have to give you the back that product
[49:41.080 --> 49:43.040]  for fifteen years that's just
[49:43.040 --> 49:44.520]  unbelievable to me
[49:44.520 --> 49:46.840]  uh... you have any closing statements tommy
[49:46.840 --> 49:50.880]  well i just want everybody you know to to uh...
[49:50.880 --> 49:52.280]  you know
[49:52.280 --> 49:57.120]  uh... get the aka tommy chan you know i can talk forever but
[49:57.120 --> 50:00.120]  the film itself really uh... speaks
[50:00.120 --> 50:04.440]  volumes and volumes and volumes because it did that it's more than just
[50:04.440 --> 50:06.760]  you know how bad these people are acting
[50:06.760 --> 50:09.600]  well what what what it really shows and it's just like
[50:09.600 --> 50:12.720]  the nine eleven thing you know it shows how
[50:12.720 --> 50:14.560]  how insane
[50:14.560 --> 50:18.200]  these people are and i think they've gone insane because of the food there
[50:18.200 --> 50:19.000]  they're eating
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.760]  you know that they're there
[50:20.760 --> 50:22.480]  these are victims of their own
[50:22.480 --> 50:26.720]  uh... demise in in a sense you know and they probably the prescription drugs
[50:26.720 --> 50:30.520]  that they take yeah they the prescription drugs in the alcohol they consume
[50:30.520 --> 50:34.400]  but look at the chain he's a good example you know

[54:32.520 --> 54:34.880]  smoke pot with him but when you got picked up
[54:34.880 --> 54:37.920]  uh... he didn't want anything to do with you and he wouldn't even talk to you
[54:37.920 --> 54:40.200]  so if you could talk about that after the prison story
[54:40.200 --> 54:43.800]  no uh... uh... but arnold wouldn't take my call you know i i've known arnold
[54:43.800 --> 54:45.120]  that he got up
[54:45.120 --> 54:47.600]  you know the boat in fact we used to teach him bad
[54:47.600 --> 54:48.320]  english
[54:48.320 --> 54:51.920]  but i think i would have to pay the girls you know and then you get his face
[54:51.920 --> 54:53.200]  slapped and then
[54:53.200 --> 54:54.640]  he had to catch on
[54:54.640 --> 54:57.800]  but yeah arnold uh... i i knew
[54:57.800 --> 55:02.000]  smoke pot was good for you for a few reasons number one
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.120]  every mister universe
[55:04.120 --> 55:07.920]  uh... for the when they were natural you know before the uh...
[55:07.920 --> 55:09.880]  and before they got into steroids
[55:09.880 --> 55:12.180]  and even after you got in the steroids they all
[55:12.180 --> 55:14.720]  that was the only thing they would do they would do pot they wouldn't do
[55:14.720 --> 55:17.680]  alcohol they wouldn't do anything else but they would smoke pot
[55:17.680 --> 55:20.760]  and then uh... and the most intelligence ones you know
[55:20.760 --> 55:21.840]  there's like uh...
[55:21.840 --> 55:26.000]  i won't name them you know but uh... and i thought that meathead mentality in
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.920]  that yeah yeah i don't know these are like uh... guys with degrees you know
[55:29.920 --> 55:34.520]  these are brilliant brilliant people and and uh... and and they're they're so
[55:34.520 --> 55:38.680]  funny about their diet they were they won't eat uh... uh... chicken if it's
[55:38.680 --> 55:40.640]  got a little bit of skin on it you know
[55:40.640 --> 55:44.240]  they they're very very healthy with the drink only water you know they don't want
[55:44.240 --> 55:46.200]  to do what only pure things in their body
[55:46.200 --> 55:51.000]  and but the only uh... we have recreational uh... it relax and did they
[55:51.000 --> 55:52.680]  do is is marijuana
[55:52.680 --> 55:53.720]  and then
[55:53.720 --> 55:57.120]  uh... that i just found out this recently but the national basketball league
[55:57.120 --> 55:58.480]  the nb a
[55:58.480 --> 56:01.680]  and you know is that they did the players said you can test us for anything
[56:01.680 --> 56:04.320]  steroids alcohol anything but
[56:04.320 --> 56:08.720]  don't test us for marijuana if you do that there won't be a leak there won't
[56:08.720 --> 56:12.920]  be of the nb a because everybody in the nb a smoke spot
[56:12.920 --> 56:17.800]  that's pretty well i don't i smoke myself i smoke many times with cream

[56:25.640 --> 56:27.120]  was in such a good shape

[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:24.280]  uh... after the vietnam war
[1:02:24.280 --> 1:02:27.120]  i had uh... gone into business
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:28.200]  and uh...
[1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:29.480]  without it
[1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:32.000]  that amount of california
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  and they uh... hollywood producer
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.720]  gave me a copy of uh...
[1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:39.400]  a book
[1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:40.880]  uh...
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:42.800]  and uh... that book
[1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:44.680]  was by uh...
[1:02:44.680 --> 1:02:48.680]  w clion scowling
[1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:52.120]  and i'm trying to think what the name of that one
[1:02:52.120 --> 1:02:53.320]  it's been a long year
[1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:55.360]  i guess it's been almost thirty years
[1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:57.320]  that's the late
[1:02:57.320 --> 1:02:58.480]  sixties
[1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:00.080]  when he gave me this book
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:01.920]  uh...
[1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:05.200]  and basically was after the uh... the reading of this book that you
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:07.240]  you know you'll start to turn your head
[1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:08.880]  well yes i am
[1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:09.640]  tried to
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:10.840]  give it to some
[1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:13.320]  to very big
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:14.920]  powerful man
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:16.160]  uh... who
[1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:18.840]  ran the amway corporation
[1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:20.520]  who quoted and and
[1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:23.760]  said all the time that they were american patriots
[1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:25.320]  and so uh...
[1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:28.720]  i tried to give this book to them and they shunned me
[1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:32.040]  and they just shunned me and ran away from me and i knew them
[1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:34.160]  i knew these two guys
[1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:36.320]  uh... that ran amway corporation
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:38.440]  and then i found out that they were
[1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:40.760]  part of the globalist movement
[1:03:40.760 --> 1:03:42.400]  you know and that's why they
[1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:45.960]  they told me to take it back to the hollywood producer and give it back to
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:48.080]  him don't give it to us
[1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:49.200]  because it did it
[1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:50.760]  it laid out
[1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:54.840]  the international criminal conspiracy to put us under this anacrisis world
[1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:56.320]  government system
[1:03:56.320 --> 1:03:57.760]  and uh...
[1:03:57.760 --> 1:04:02.360]  these two amway top dogs were supposed to be christians and patriots
[1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:06.680]  and the way they treated me i was real suspicious and i looked up
[1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:10.680]  more about them and found out that they're part of the cfr and
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:15.280]  uh... other organizations setting up this anacrisis world government system
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:17.660]  so it really shocked me
[1:04:17.660 --> 1:04:20.040]  but it helped wake me up and then
[1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:26.560]  when i moved out to phoenix arizona to become a law enforcement officer
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:31.680]  and went into the police academy there at thirty-two years of age
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:34.800]  with twenty and twenty one-year-old
[1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:37.360]  i was uh... very knowledgeable
[1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:40.960]  much much more knowledgeable about life
[1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:44.240]  people some of them still live at home with their mommies and daddies
[1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:47.120]  all right jack hold that thought we're going to be back after this it is the
[1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:50.120]  alex joneshow prisonplanet dot com
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:53.840]  her beloved republic is on her knees the forces of globalism are destroying
[1:04:53.840 --> 1:04:55.760]  national sovereignty worldwide

[1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:38.680]  will be there we're talking to jack mclam and we're discussing how uh...
[1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:41.640]  at first you came across this information you tried to bring it to
[1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:43.880]  two very powerful people you thought were christians
[1:08:43.880 --> 1:08:47.920]  in fact they were part of the ruling class if you will part of the cfr
[1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:50.640]  then you moved on to the arizona police department where
[1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:54.920]  you were a little bit older than everybody else
[1:08:54.920 --> 1:08:56.440]  jacky there
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:08:57.640]  did we drop jack
[1:08:57.640 --> 1:08:59.280]  yet i'm i'm here
[1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:03.240]  yes it made a tremendous difference that i was thirty two
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:05.200]  and these twenty twenty one-year-old
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:07.360]  uh... skull full of much
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:08.920]  we're in there
[1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:11.240]  everything they were told they believe
[1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:15.920]  by our superiors but i realized that they were being lied to over and over
[1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:16.880]  again
[1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:20.720]  by the way the name of that book with the naked capitalist by w clion
[1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:22.000]  calvin
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.160]  and uh... it was uh...
[1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:28.560]  rich devos jay van and all the two top dog form damway
[1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:33.160]  that our globalist hard-core globalist and that's why i am we did so well all
[1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:34.680]  over the world
[1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:36.560]  and move so quickly
[1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:38.960]  but anyway back to the academy
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:44.200]  when i went in the police academy at thirty two years of age
[1:09:44.200 --> 1:09:47.080]  our superiors come in all the time
[1:09:47.080 --> 1:09:51.920]  and uh... once again it was important that i was in business after the vietnam
[1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:52.880]  war
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:58.080]  because i learned how to sell people you know sell people products that
[1:09:58.080 --> 1:09:59.840]  and i thought well
[1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:00.960]  uh...
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:04.160]  a good relationship with the community
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:08.880]  caring and being concerned and and being a part of the community is a
[1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:11.520]  police officer would be very important
[1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:15.280]  to law enforcement work well when i was in the police academy
[1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:18.160]  i i heard things over and over again like
[1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:22.320]  you're no longer citizens you're an entity of government promoted above the
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:26.080]  citizens to better supervise them for their own good
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:27.080]  and these young
[1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:31.200]  all full of much twenty twenty one-year-old just grand and loved it to
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:34.280]  hear that they were promoted above the citizens
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:38.280]  were given guns and uh... nightsticks and everything and
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:41.640]  they're going to be supervising the public not serving them
[1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:44.960]  and then they'd come in and say you can't trust the citizens out there to
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:46.680]  ever come to your aid
[1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:49.560]  you can only trust fellow police officers
[1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:55.000]  and over and over again every few days these superiors would come in
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.200]  and train these young people
[1:10:57.200 --> 1:10:59.160]  and what i thought happening
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:01.280]  my friend who was
[1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:06.400]  psychologically dividing the police officers from the public
[1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:08.760]  they were they were bridging
[1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:12.960]  broadening the gap between citizens and law enforcement officer
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:16.360]  and i didn't understand why until at the end of our
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:19.440]  sixteen weeks in the regional police academy
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:22.920]  they came in and said now one day you're going to be asked to do things you
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:25.640]  won't want to do and you won't like to do
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:27.800]  but if you don't do these things
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:29.720]  society will collapse
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:34.480]  and so it was at all sixteen weeks of brainwashing of these young people
[1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:37.680]  well it didn't take on me very well because
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:39.040]  i knew that
[1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:42.320]  the things many of the things we were being told were live
[1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:46.280]  because i had life experience that the young people didn't
[1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:49.480]  and so that's why they don't like old cop
[1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:52.480]  well i mean they're trying to brainwash you into thinking into separating you
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:55.120]  from civilians the same way they do in the military
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:57.920]  where they bring these guys through great basic training and they say hey
[1:11:57.920 --> 1:11:59.640]  you're part of this elite unit
[1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:01.180]  you have more power
[1:12:01.180 --> 1:12:05.120]  and yet like you said the younger minds often take to that philosophy
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:09.080]  and they really don't see other people outside of their uniform as human beings
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:10.160]  anymore
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:14.560]  no it's really a separation between the two
[1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:18.280]  now that they're militarizing the police and setting up these
[1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:20.440]  blackwater agencies
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:23.760]  even here in ita ho they're trying to set one up
[1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:28.840]  uh... to send our police officers to to learn to kill and maim and and act like
[1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:29.880]  animals
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:33.560]  i shouldn't use the term animal because animals don't even act like that but
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:35.080]  monsters
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:36.560]  and uh...
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:39.320]  very very serious today i spent
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:41.120]  twelve hours a day
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:45.320]  and much of that time of communicating on the web with police officers and
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:47.080]  soldiers and
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:51.040]  our job here is to educate our police and soldiers for the last twenty eight
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:53.240]  years of volunteers here
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:58.080]  and uh... i see the change in the attitude of the police
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:12:59.480]  and the military
[1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:01.880]  uh... towards the public today
[1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:05.240]  but one great things happening brother is that
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:08.400]  our soldiers are really getting angry
[1:13:08.400 --> 1:13:11.200]  over there in iraq in afghanistan
[1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:14.040]  as their family right to them
[1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:19.340]  as they allegedly are over there to bring democracy to those countries
[1:13:19.340 --> 1:13:22.760]  and their families telling them how many freedoms
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:26.000]  are being taken away from us here at home
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.360]  and so the the soldiers are reacting horribly
[1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:31.920]  the fact that uh...
[1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:32.960]  there's a big
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:37.560]  on job going on there they're over there bringing democracy allegedly
[1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:41.320]  uh... actually they're not they're taking over those lands
[1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:43.040]  uh... and the oil
[1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:45.900]  but uh... for the international criminal elite but they don't
[1:13:45.900 --> 1:13:49.680]  many of them don't realize that but they are very upset that
[1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:52.140]  we're losing our freedoms here at home
[1:13:52.140 --> 1:13:56.240]  as they're supposedly bringing freedom to the people in iraq in afghanistan
[1:13:56.240 --> 1:14:01.080]  well i think that's why they've set up things like blackwater and cac i forces
[1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:03.160]  is because in order to uh...
[1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:04.760]  squelch down on the public here
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:08.600]  in in america you need these privatized forces that don't have the ties at home
[1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:09.240]  whereas
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:11.920]  a u s soldier might find a problem sweeping
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:13.400]  a u s home
[1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:16.560]  uh... somebody from mexico or you know a
[1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:19.720]  a prisoner really like to recruit them to isn't going to have
[1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:21.800]  that same problem and then you have
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:22.960]  halibur in
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:26.680]  uh... a private corporation building fema camps in this country
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:30.480]  that halibur and leaves the country and goes to do by well if martial laws ever
[1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:31.840]  declared in this country
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:36.080]  halibur and simply going to use the c a c i forces these blackwater forces to
[1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:38.360]  round people up and put them in these camps
[1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:41.760]  and it's going to be awfully hard for us to rise up against halibur and if they're
[1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:43.360]  not even in the country jack
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:47.040]  that's right brother that's right and that's why the bush family bought two
[1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:49.880]  million acres down in south america
[1:14:49.880 --> 1:14:53.280]  all of these big international criminal elite
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:57.440]  are buying property out of this country so that they can get out of here when
[1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:01.080]  they put us under martial law because they don't want
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:03.720]  up to rise up and come after them
[1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:08.400]  though they're all buying outside this country right as we speak right now
[1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:09.280]  and uh...
[1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:12.960]  uh... look the same with halibur and get the heck out of here that uh... of
[1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:14.680]  course old cheney
[1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:17.120]  uh... still his business today
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:21.520]  although he lied that that's not that he's not connected to it but he is
[1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:22.560]  he makes
[1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:25.680]  multi-million a year off halibur
[1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:30.600]  and right now the carlile group cheney bush and off of some of them a lot in
[1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:33.840]  their business partners in the carlile group and
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:37.480]  they're going around buying up all the uh... american ammunition
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:41.120]  companies right now that make ammunition here for america
[1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:43.560]  to make sure that americans can't get any
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:46.520]  well i feel like the public are a little too hip to the carlile group
[1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:49.720]  because they just announced its bankruptcy about two weeks ago
[1:15:49.720 --> 1:15:52.280]  we all know what they exactly what we all know what that is
[1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:55.160]  the leaders of that of that corporation are getting out and they're putting it
[1:15:55.160 --> 1:15:56.560]  under a different name
[1:15:56.560 --> 1:15:58.960]  you know those guys are going broke let's be honest
[1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:02.040]  they're just upset that it's it's gotten as much public attention
[1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:04.960]  as it has a i think they were pretty uncomfortable when even michael more
[1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:06.080]  talked about it
[1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:07.640]  in fair height nine eleven
[1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:10.480]  i want to get into uh... some of the police state news
[1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:13.680]  uh... just just in on may second i don't know if you've heard this yet but i
[1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:17.040]  bm has now joined uh... lockheed martin's team
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:19.800]  for the fbis next generation of identification
[1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:22.960]  and it's all about biometrics and it's all about facial recognition
[1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:25.360]  capabilities and instead of uh...
[1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:29.680]  said it just thumbprints we're now going to have palm prints jack is not great
[1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:32.800]  yeah that's wonderful just wonderful
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:34.840]  well a lot of people don't know that i bm
[1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:38.720]  actually created the first tabulation machines which were the first computers
[1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:43.520]  for the nazis so that they could uh... you know do their round up in germany
[1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:47.960]  yet very true very true i mean that's how they catalog people folks they use
[1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:50.800]  tabulation machines that's how they mobilized
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:54.720]  their uh... concentration camps their work camps their death camps
[1:16:54.720 --> 1:16:57.720]  and if you don't think that's coming here why is it
[1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:03.440]  that i bm's joining lockheed martin this super military industrial complex unit
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:07.680]  in order to provide the next generation of identification
[1:17:07.680 --> 1:17:09.240]  it makes me say right
[1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:12.960]  let me tell you something that not many people know too
[1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:15.520]  that it was the
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:16.600]  secret
[1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:21.160]  super secret organization government organization
[1:17:21.160 --> 1:17:25.840]  that promoted in america this tremendous rush to go out get yourself
[1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:27.400]  tattooed
[1:17:27.400 --> 1:17:31.040]  because when i was with the phoenix police department i was the intelligence
[1:17:31.040 --> 1:17:33.700]  officer for the phoenix police department
[1:17:33.700 --> 1:17:35.240]  hi uh...
[1:17:35.240 --> 1:17:36.680]  uh...
[1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:40.280]  i realized working with the fb i and other agencies
[1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:42.000]  that we love
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:45.160]  to see people go out and get tattooed
[1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:49.000]  because every time that person stopped
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:53.400]  they the officer writes it down takes a picture of the tattoo and sends it in
[1:17:53.400 --> 1:17:55.040]  for their case file
[1:17:55.040 --> 1:17:58.940]  even if it's just a private citizen on a traffic stop
[1:17:58.940 --> 1:18:03.480]  they they love you to get tattoos and so the government secretly went out and
[1:18:03.480 --> 1:18:06.880]  start promoting all the young people getting tattoos
[1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:09.280]  and so they can record them
[1:18:09.280 --> 1:18:13.000]  and uh... it's easy to see now fingerprints take a few minutes you
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:13.680]  know
[1:18:13.680 --> 1:18:17.200]  a little while to send to the computer and so forth
[1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:19.680]  but your tattoos are really
[1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:23.560]  an identification mark for individuals that's a hundred percent true i've been
[1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:26.920]  incarcerated before i've been processed in one of the first questions they ask
[1:18:26.920 --> 1:18:27.360]  you
[1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:29.520]  is do you have any birthmarks or tattoos
[1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:31.160]  so if you don't have a birthmark
[1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:34.880]  you know i actually have one on my arm my arm that's pretty visible that
[1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:35.960]  they must love
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:38.720]  but you know then they're like well what tattoos do you have and then you you
[1:18:38.720 --> 1:18:41.320]  write down what tattoos are they searching like all you didn't put that
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:42.120]  one down
[1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:44.400]  and that is a lot easier identification
[1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:46.720]  than having to run somebody's fingerprint because
[1:18:46.720 --> 1:18:49.760]  you know obviously you have to run that through a database whereas if somebody
[1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:50.920]  gives you a name
[1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:54.600]  you can immediately pull up that name and see what tattoos they have checked
[1:18:54.600 --> 1:18:55.800]  the tattoos on them
[1:18:55.800 --> 1:18:57.760]  and it's either that person or it isn't
[1:18:57.760 --> 1:18:58.920]  that's right
[1:18:58.920 --> 1:19:02.640]  so you know they'd like you said they well they've been subversive for years
[1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:06.480]  now you know obviously they they try to promote things that are gonna help them
[1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:09.760]  in pop culture and tattoos are definitely one of them there's no
[1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:12.640]  there's no real way to get rid of an armful of tattoos i mean you can sit
[1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:16.720]  there with the laser surgery for years on end but it's still gonna have marks
[1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:18.240]  that's right that's right
[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:22.360]  yeah if you take it off then it leaves a mark
[1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:24.240]  they uh... know
[1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:26.880]  that that with the tattoo there at one time
[1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:30.560]  all right we're uh... we're gonna be back with uh... jack mclam of jack mclam

[1:26:45.920 --> 1:26:49.000]  and and so does bush actually under the cfr
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:50.880]  uh... and uh...

[1:26:54.920 --> 1:26:57.640]  and we've heard this from many many
[1:26:57.640 --> 1:26:58.840]  uh...
[1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:03.400]  great american patriotic jewish uh... brothers and sisters in the military
[1:27:03.400 --> 1:27:04.960]  that uh...
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:09.400]  the neil contratki i control the military today and we are going to war
[1:27:09.400 --> 1:27:10.800]  with iran
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:15.320]  unless god stops it because you and i can't do it weak we can't stop it
[1:27:15.320 --> 1:27:18.920]  but they're they've now sent the nuclear sub is over there u.s. nuclear
[1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:22.120]  sub just sent a third
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:23.120]  uh...
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:24.400]  uh... force
[1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:26.840]  uh... flat top over to their
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:29.040]  uh... attack force
[1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:30.160]  and uh... there
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:33.480]  they're really revenue up to go to war
[1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:37.320]  uh... with iran and the sad thing about it is
[1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:40.040]  we've heard from our intel people
[1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:46.320]  uh... here at our two police and military association that uh...
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:52.040]  pointed out ten thousand targets in iran that they're going to bomb
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:53.960]  ten thousand targets now
[1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:58.240]  the reason for doing this is that they made a mistake in iraq
[1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:02.560]  and they didn't kill enough of the citizens the citizens are rising up
[1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:06.160]  today because we've killed a million two hundred thousand
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:08.360]  men women and children over there
[1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:11.480]  and the citizens are the ones that are really the
[1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:16.120]  the uh... fighters the al-qaeda the al-qaeda right the al-qaeda insurgents
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:19.360]  yeah but everybody labeled al-qaeda whether you're just a person in a in a
[1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:21.160]  hut trying to defend your village
[1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:23.600]  or your natural terrorist your al-qaeda
[1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:27.080]  yeah but the intel people tell us that they hope to kill
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:28.400]  fifty million
[1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:29.680]  iranians
[1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:31.320]  out of the seventy two
[1:28:31.320 --> 1:28:35.440]  million iranians that are over there so that they will not have this
[1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:39.440]  citizens standing up to fight our forces in iran
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:43.480]  so fifty million is on the on the uh... target
[1:28:43.480 --> 1:28:44.440]  to kill
[1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:48.000]  with this ten thousand targets that they've designated there
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:52.360]  and these are not just nuclear reactor coming ten thousand targets
[1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:54.640]  they're going to clean out the whole country
[1:28:54.640 --> 1:28:58.120]  and that's the purpose they want to turn it over to the
[1:28:58.120 --> 1:28:59.800]  neocon trotkyite
[1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:04.180]  and make this the place where they set up their world government out of
[1:29:04.180 --> 1:29:05.600]  iraq iraq
[1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:07.180]  it really is the final on
[1:29:07.180 --> 1:29:08.520]  yeah it's the really uh...

[1:33:31.320 --> 1:33:35.080]  dot com and uh jack you were just discussing how they want iraq to be
[1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:40.200]  their new bible on and that's what it is they're building
[1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:43.960]  uh... our soldiers are telling us here at our two police and military
[1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:47.880]  associations that they're building 21 building
[1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:51.720]  they're in the green zone that they're saying is an embassy
[1:33:51.720 --> 1:33:56.440]  now i've been i live grew up in warston dc and been in a number of embassies
[1:33:56.440 --> 1:34:01.640]  it's one building and so what they're building here according to our soldiers
[1:34:01.640 --> 1:34:06.920]  is the uh... military headquarters for taking over the whole middle east and
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:09.880]  running this world government system out of
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:15.880]  babelon uh... iraq and if you read the holy scriptures it says that
[1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:20.120]  the middle east is where the world government will be operated from
[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:23.960]  and so they're setting up this antichrist system right there in
[1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:29.960]  iraq babelon uh... to control the whole middle east and to set up this uh...
[1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:34.360]  and by the way saudi arabia's next after we take over iran
[1:34:34.360 --> 1:34:39.160]  i've been told by sources that are saudi arabia's next though they think
[1:34:39.160 --> 1:34:43.320]  they're our buddies but no they're going to get bombed into the stone age
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:47.000]  you're going to uh... our military going to die over there too for these
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:50.760]  international criminals they want to take over the whole middle east well i
[1:34:50.760 --> 1:34:53.960]  always felt that that's what they were set up for uh... that's why they said
[1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:57.800]  15 of the nineteen hijackers came from saudi arabia right now we're going to
[1:34:57.800 --> 1:35:00.840]  be able to uh... fool the american people into going
[1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:04.360]  into afghanistan after all that was where bin laden was the main guy
[1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:07.240]  and they were going to be able to fool people into iraq because they had been
[1:35:07.240 --> 1:35:09.560]  demonized over the last decade or so
[1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:13.880]  uh... really two decades almost with uh... operation desert storm
[1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:17.880]  and all that in the early nineties and i always felt after we had the landmass
[1:35:17.880 --> 1:35:22.040]  of afghanistan iran and iraq we would have a landmass
[1:35:22.040 --> 1:35:25.320]  almost as large as saudi arabia and we can use that
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:28.680]  as a launching base to invade that nation as well
[1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:32.680]  sure yeah and that's what it's all about it's all happening in the middle east
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:37.560]  that's why we ought to be very concerned about especially christians out there
[1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:41.160]  funding this anachronism that's being set up
[1:35:41.160 --> 1:35:44.520]  if so many christians are saying yeah yeah go get them go get them they're a
[1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:48.120]  threat to israel go destroy all these Arab nations
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:52.840]  but really folks listen to me i'm a born again christian
[1:35:52.840 --> 1:35:56.840]  and but i've read the bible myself i haven't just listened to my government
[1:35:56.840 --> 1:35:59.480]  preacher tell me about what's in it
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:04.600]  but uh... we're helping set up the antichrist world government system by
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:07.320]  going to war and taking over these nations
[1:36:07.320 --> 1:36:10.680]  for these antichrist international criminal elite
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:14.120]  in this country so shame on you christians for
[1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:17.800]  for funding and and pushing these wars
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:21.320]  in the middle east well the majority of christians in this country still believe
[1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:25.320]  that george bush is a man of uh... jesus christ when in fact
[1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:29.000]  he goes out to the yeah when he goes to the bohemian grove uh... in sonoma
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  california for two weeks out of the year
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:34.760]  not to kick off the uh... whole ceremony with the cremation of care where
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:37.240]  they all dress up like pagans and uh...
[1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:41.480]  have little hoods and do you know Babylonian rituals really like this
[1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:45.640]  hour-long ritual of a mock sacrifice in front of an owl god named molik a
[1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:49.960]  canaanite deity where people used to sacrifice their children to very
[1:36:49.960 --> 1:36:51.320]  christian indeed jack
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:54.600]  oh yeah sure let's take some colors own
[1:36:54.600 --> 1:36:59.000]  the scullin bone society is known as the satanic organization
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:02.360]  and bush won't leave it because he's a statement
[1:37:02.360 --> 1:37:06.280]  and there's no question about that whatsoever he's also
[1:37:06.280 --> 1:37:10.120]  loves uh... handsome little boys and uh...
[1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:13.400]  in the white house there's uh... remember that uh...

[1:39:24.280 --> 1:39:27.800]  rivet the chains on the next of your fellow americans
[1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:30.840]  well the prop bottom line is that americans really have had it too good for
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:34.440]  too long on the outset they don't see this tyranny because it's not in their
[1:39:34.440 --> 1:39:37.800]  face every single day it's starting to get there i mean the four fifty a
[1:39:37.800 --> 1:39:40.360]  gallon gas the fact that we have troops over in the
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:43.960]  middle east dying all the time but it's still on such a level
[1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:48.120]  that they're they're codified into this you know mall culture where the tv is
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:51.720]  going to tell me what to do i'm going to follow the tv i'm going to go to the
[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:54.680]  mall i'm going to have my car payments i'm going to send my kids to college and
[1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:57.720]  everything's great you know the government isn't that bad
[1:39:57.720 --> 1:40:02.360]  the right yet and i think is that people also feel like they can't make a
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:04.920]  difference well joe you're one of those people out there that has made a
[1:40:04.920 --> 1:40:08.600]  difference okay well and i just you know the
[1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:11.800]  whatever difference little difference i've made it was just being on on the
[1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:15.880]  shoulders of like you know jack saying that he's been at this for 28 plus years
[1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:19.480]  and uh... you know the work that you've done jason and you know we really all
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:25.320]  just uh... kind of uh... take a little bit from those that have come before us
[1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:29.000]  and uh... continue the battle and uh... it's the people that
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:32.360]  aren't getting in there and helping to to row the boat you know we need to get
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:34.920]  them on board as well so we can uh...
[1:40:34.920 --> 1:40:39.720]  you know getting some speed i'm with you joe i thank you so much for the call
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:43.960]  uh... if you want to thank you brother you're a great american hero joe i'm
[1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:47.960]  just proud to serve with you he is a great american hero he's featured in
[1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:51.960]  america freedom to fascism one of the best tools that we have out there
[1:40:51.960 --> 1:40:55.640]  to wake people up not only to the fraud of the federal reserve system
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:40:59.080]  but the coming real idea and the uh... the shipping
[1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:03.080]  you know i mean uh... their chip is real if the size of a grain of rice
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:07.720]  it was uh... approved for humans by the fda in 2004 well tommy thompson
[1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:11.080]  was was the head of health and human services in this country he also happens
[1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:14.680]  to be on the board of their chip went on tv said he was going to take a chip
[1:41:14.680 --> 1:41:18.520]  when i confronted him last summer he said all i didn't take any chips yet but
[1:41:18.520 --> 1:41:21.720]  it's the greatest thing since ever it's the best thing since breakfast you know
[1:41:21.720 --> 1:41:24.360]  we can use it for the military for inventory
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:28.120]  is what he told me and i sat there and i'm like inventory what are you talking
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:31.800]  about if you want to put inventory on say a bomber weapon you can easily
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:35.000]  put an rfid tag on the outset something that's scannable
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:38.360]  you don't have a chip for that he's talking about soldiers jack
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:42.440]  their inventory let me tell you something brother our government is
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:47.160]  very very scared if neocontrast guide controlled government of ours are very
[1:41:47.160 --> 1:41:51.400]  scared of special forces in our military
[1:41:51.400 --> 1:41:54.920]  that's why they just passed that bill to disarm our military
[1:41:54.920 --> 1:42:01.560]  200 000 that have ptsd and everything but also they're putting
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:05.880]  these chips in our special forces out there
[1:42:05.880 --> 1:42:10.360]  and what we've heard through very deep intel sources as these
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:16.120]  chips they're putting in special forces have an explosive chip part in that
[1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:20.120]  chip that puts poison into the system and kills that
[1:42:20.120 --> 1:42:24.440]  special forces officer if he joins in with the patriots and tries to save
[1:42:24.440 --> 1:42:28.520]  america so if if any of these special forces
[1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:32.840]  guys think it's really neat to have that chip because if you get lost behind
[1:42:32.840 --> 1:42:36.920]  interlinked enemy lines they could find you easy but
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:41.400]  secretly in that chip there's an explosive device that poisons you
[1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:44.520]  and you die within just a couple minutes
[1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:48.920]  after that chip goes off and they can set off that chip by satellite
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:52.440]  so i think it's also scary that they're chipping regular citizens i mean it's
[1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:55.560]  one thing to be in the military to be in special forces
[1:42:55.560 --> 1:42:58.920]  to be kind of like called and brainwashed into taking it
[1:42:58.920 --> 1:43:03.240]  but right now they're proposing that anybody south of mexico the mexican
[1:43:03.240 --> 1:43:07.160]  government wants to do away with passports and chip people to come into
[1:43:07.160 --> 1:43:09.400]  this country and the only person that's reported on it
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:14.680]  is lewdabs on cnn for 40 seconds one night so why isn't this a huge issue
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:18.200]  this isn't a voluntary chipping this is a mobility issue if you want to
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:21.640]  leave the country you now have to get chipped and when we get into this north
[1:43:21.640 --> 1:43:24.920]  american union jack when they finally put it together with
[1:43:24.920 --> 1:43:28.520]  uh... the united states mexico and canada who's to say you're not going to
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:32.520]  have to have a chip to come into this country that's right absolutely that's
[1:43:32.520 --> 1:43:36.280]  coming brother that certainly coming well that's one of the biggest things
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:39.000]  that got me involved in this movement when i first saw
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.280]  on nine eleven the road to tyranny in two thousand and two when i was doing my
[1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:46.200]  initial research into nine eleven and i saw the jacob's family
[1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:50.440]  get on the today show and take government chips together and say
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:54.120]  how it made them feel safer from terror and they didn't mind taking it
[1:43:54.120 --> 1:43:58.600]  for this government i i literally got sick to my stomach
[1:43:58.600 --> 1:44:02.520]  yeah very true it's unbelievable all right let's jump to another phone call
[1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:06.840]  let's go to ed in utah ed are you with us
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:11.480]  hello hey how you doing ed pretty good uh... jack it's been a long time since i
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:14.920]  met you at the salt palace back in the days of the patriot preparedness
[1:44:14.920 --> 1:44:19.160]  expose that's been a while brother good to talk to you again it's good to talk
[1:44:19.160 --> 1:44:22.040]  to you i do want to address a couple of things here
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:26.520]  uh... one of your uh... fellow of patriots up in Idaho
[1:44:26.520 --> 1:44:30.680]  i think you might know mark glenn from the american free press newspaper
[1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:35.960]  yes right now mark uh... glenn uh... wrote something recently he might have
[1:44:35.960 --> 1:44:39.240]  an answer about this iranian situation
[1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:43.800]  that he wrote about in the american free press concerning russia and putin
[1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:47.480]  might be the only bull walk over there against an invasion jack what do you
[1:44:47.480 --> 1:44:51.400]  think yes yes we've heard that there are intel
[1:44:51.400 --> 1:44:56.200]  people that uh... putin is really ticked off about
[1:44:56.200 --> 1:45:01.400]  this war coming up uh... with america against iran
[1:45:01.400 --> 1:45:05.640]  and putin is deeply involved russia's deeply involved in iran
[1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:09.560]  in business dealings and so forth so there's a very
[1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:13.960]  good likelihood that we can find ourselves at war with russia
[1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:18.280]  uh... and not just a cold war either but a hot war
[1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:22.040]  with russia if we go into iran but after all
[1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:26.040]  the international criminal elite want world war three
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:29.720]  so if russia will get involved in a war
[1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:35.640]  with us and uh... over iran this helps them push for their goal for world war
[1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:40.600]  three they what they're trying to do according to our intel people
[1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:45.000]  is cause the muslims across the world one billion
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  three hundred million to stand up and go to war
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:53.240]  uh... and that's a lot of soldiers out there but
[1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:57.880]  anyway they want to stand up go to war all across the world
[1:45:57.880 --> 1:46:00.600]  so that uh... there'll be blood in the street
[1:46:00.600 --> 1:46:04.440]  all across the world and the people across the world will cry out for
[1:46:04.440 --> 1:46:07.960]  world peace and they can just uh... shuttle us
[1:46:07.960 --> 1:46:12.840]  right under the the cons of the communist controlled united
[1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:17.880]  nations system for world peace and and if you remember
[1:46:17.880 --> 1:46:22.040]  back during the time that russia was around when they would say peace peace
[1:46:22.040 --> 1:46:26.680]  peace it meant no opposition to communism that was peace
[1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:31.880]  so when when these guys say world peace it means no opposition to the antichrist
[1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:35.720]  world government system is what world peace is going to be but it's going to
[1:46:35.720 --> 1:46:41.000]  be the super rich and the super poor no middle class just like it was in russia
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:45.240]  and so uh... yeah they want world war three so if russia
[1:46:45.240 --> 1:46:49.080]  will get involved in the war when when we go into iran
[1:46:49.080 --> 1:46:52.840]  they're going to have a big smile on their face because they want to promote
[1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:57.800]  this world government system and have the people cry out for peace across the
[1:46:57.800 --> 1:47:01.720]  world after enough of their countrymen are killed
[1:47:01.720 --> 1:47:06.280]  and go into this world government system i couldn't agree with you more ed thank
[1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:10.040]  you for the call i mean i want people to understand out there too this is not
[1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:14.040]  really our term for it uh... the new world order has been professed
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:17.880]  uh... throughout centuries now i mean we have hd wells writing a book called the
[1:47:17.880 --> 1:47:21.240]  new world order where he states that a lot of good people are going to have to
[1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:24.200]  die to bring this in hitler spoke of the new world order
[1:47:24.200 --> 1:47:27.080]  george bush senior spoke of the new world order by name
[1:47:27.080 --> 1:47:30.280]  henry kissinger spoke of the new world order by name i have several
[1:47:30.280 --> 1:47:34.120]  clips of bill clinton he knows he knows damn well with the new world order is
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:36.200]  and he says he's promoting the new world order
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:38.760]  tony blair former prime minister of the u k
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:43.320]  gordon brown in front of the cbi just before he became the prime minister of
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:47.000]  the u k did like a five-minute speech just on the new world order
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:50.760]  talked about the economics of the new world order uh... you know the policies
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:53.960]  in the new world order where the u k would be in the new world order
[1:47:53.960 --> 1:47:58.040]  i mean it it was actually the front page of their papers the next day
[1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:01.560]  you know brown uh... calls for a new world order we've had the pope call for a
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:05.000]  new world order what are people going to wake up jack
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:09.320]  well we we've learned to our catholic brothers and sisters in the military
[1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:10.200]  that
[1:48:10.200 --> 1:48:11.960]  hope john the fact that hope
[1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:14.680]  john paul the fact that was the leader
[1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:19.240]  in going across the world and we have to videotape matter of fact of him talking
[1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:20.120]  to
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:23.880]  which is that they can learn telling them that
[1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:26.920]  that he wants them in his world religion
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:31.480]  so it's the roman pope each system setting up the world religion
[1:48:31.480 --> 1:48:34.680]  under the antichrist and the uh...
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:35.560]  communist
[1:48:35.560 --> 1:48:36.280]  zionist
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:37.960]  gentiles that call themselves
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:39.480]  jews in israel
[1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:43.320]  and here in america they're called neocons but they're actually gentiles that
[1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:44.960]  call themselves
[1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:47.160]  just like in revelations god said
[1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:48.920]  at this time there would be
[1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:51.960]  people calling them themselves jews that were not
[1:48:51.960 --> 1:48:55.720]  and uh... they're setting up the political world government system at the
[1:48:55.720 --> 1:48:57.400]  time the catholic
[1:48:57.400 --> 1:48:59.320]  this uh... rat slinger
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:00.600]  the new pope
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:03.440]  is is doing the same thing now that
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:06.080]  uh... john paul the second was doing it
[1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:10.040]  i have two videos up here one called is the pope catholic
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:14.160]  and the other one vatican rising that shows pope john paul the second going
[1:49:14.160 --> 1:49:16.080]  around across the world
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:20.600]  telling snake handlers and and uh... the worshippers of sheva
[1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:25.200]  taking the mark of sheva in his forehead telling them they don't need jesus christ
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:27.480]  because they have their own path to heaven
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:30.240]  and inviting them into the world religion so
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:31.920]  yes there is two
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:34.800]  things going on at once world politics
[1:49:34.800 --> 1:49:36.240]  world religion
[1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:39.200]  and world politics coming together
[1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:44.000]  to control so that the people that need that after the jack of religion
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:47.560]  will have their world religion to worship
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:51.640]  well i feel like they use three major things to divide and conquer and that is
[1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:52.760]  uh... race
[1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:54.280]  politics
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:49:55.480]  and religion
[1:49:55.480 --> 1:49:58.800]  and uh... like as you said you know when you have the pope who's supposed to be
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:02.360]  the head of the catholics going around promoting a one-world religion
[1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:03.680]  there is obviously
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:06.800]  and alter your motive
[1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:08.760]  now it's it's very scary stuff
[1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:09.480]  it is
[1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:13.240]  it's very sad too because i think the top
[1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:17.280]  people in the baptist church the lutheran church the methodist church
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:21.280]  they are global at the very top people and they're working to put it under the
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:23.240]  world religion
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:26.600]  and they're having great success at it by telling
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:27.880]  the ministers
[1:50:27.880 --> 1:50:30.880]  seminary
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:35.000]  interpretation of roman thirteen that we must obey everything government
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:38.200]  tells us to do because i want to talk roman thirteen when we come back in the
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:39.640]  final segment jack
[1:50:39.640 --> 1:50:46.640]  uh... we're going to be back after this it's the alex joneshow

[1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:31.800]  and yes folks nine eleven he doesn't buy the official story either and we need
[1:54:31.800 --> 1:54:35.440]  more and more people like this because unfortunately in this country people
[1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:39.720]  gravitate towards celebrity and not towards scientists or public officials
[1:54:39.720 --> 1:54:43.480]  so that's why it's important for people like rosie o'donnell to come out it's
[1:54:43.480 --> 1:54:46.600]  important for people like willing elson to come out and it's important for people
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:51.520]  like tommy chong to come out so please check that out on the other side jack
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:54.840]  we're talking roman's thirteen and i had a guest on discussing it yesterday and
[1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:59.360]  basically what has happened is fema has went around the country sent officials
[1:54:59.360 --> 1:55:05.720]  to these local churches talk to pastors and put them on a payroll to tell people
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:10.120]  that roman's thirteen should be followed and that indeed the government is god
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:14.800]  and if they come and they round us up we should go with them
[1:55:14.800 --> 1:55:16.640]  you with me jack
[1:55:16.640 --> 1:55:17.760]  maybe i'll let jack up
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:21.960]  almost thirty thousand now brother you're absolutely correct
[1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:25.680]  by the way you did a great job with tommy chong i enjoyed that very much
[1:55:25.680 --> 1:55:28.080]  you're looking what i think you know
[1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:29.760]  uh... but anyway yes
[1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:34.960]  over thirty thousand pastors now christian pastors signed on
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:38.240]  to convince their flock of the lie
[1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:41.960]  that uh... roman's thirteen when they went to uh...
[1:55:41.960 --> 1:55:43.200]  seminaries
[1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:43.880]  uh...
[1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:47.880]  that the nineteen hundred we've had several communists tell us that
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:51.680]  the seminaries in america were taken over by god's enemies
[1:55:51.680 --> 1:55:53.960]  in the early nineteen hundred
[1:55:53.960 --> 1:55:58.160]  and they've talked to ministers perspective ministers to come out and
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:55:59.760]  tell the people that
[1:55:59.760 --> 1:56:03.840]  all government of god so we must obey all government well
[1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:06.800]  uh... when you have a totally evil government
[1:56:06.800 --> 1:56:10.000]  it goes against on ninety four sixteen
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:14.040]  god says rise up against the evil doers and stand up against the workers of
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:15.240]  iniquity
[1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:17.400]  and when you set back and let
[1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:21.400]  state and take over our government as it has today
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:23.680]  and set back and and say what
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:26.120]  of the other lie the minister told you
[1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:30.120]  is that you're going to be raptured out of here next week so who cares
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:33.840]  just that back keep your head down don't make the government mad let look at the
[1:56:33.840 --> 1:56:35.360]  state and takeover
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:39.280]  and we're leaving here next week well billy graham's been saying that for seventy
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:41.880]  five years and we're still here
[1:56:41.880 --> 1:56:47.240]  and so if you really read the scripture to find out jesus christ himself said
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:51.280]  the ones that are going to be raptured out are the evil one
[1:56:51.280 --> 1:56:54.960]  and and i could show you where that that in the bible i can't think of the
[1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:59.120]  chapter right down versus luke somewhere in there but he tells his
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:00.360]  his uh...
[1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:04.600]  disciples that uh... the evil ones are going to be raptured out in the eagles
[1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:08.480]  are going to eat their flesh the dead bodies will be laying out there
[1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:10.640]  in the eagles are going to eat their flesh
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:11.840]  right in luke
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:15.080]  and so all the people lied to and brother
[1:57:15.080 --> 1:57:19.800]  the christians have totally withdrawn from this battle that god told us to be
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:20.720]  in
[1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:25.240]  beyond the field of battle against his enemies and occupy until his return
[1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:28.600]  well it's been said for uh... evil to succeed all that takes is good men to do
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:32.280]  nothing and that's what they're encouraging is that exactly is good
[1:57:32.280 --> 1:57:35.600]  men do nothing you said thirty thousand pastors that i really want people to
[1:57:35.600 --> 1:57:38.440]  grasp that i mean thirty thousand people
[1:57:38.440 --> 1:57:42.000]  would be enough but these pastors are in charge of flocks in the hundreds and
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:42.920]  thousands
[1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:46.960]  i mean we're talking up to maybe three four five million people
[1:57:46.960 --> 1:57:50.480]  that believe this that are just gonna go along willingly when these are people
[1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:51.640]  that should be fighting

[2:00:56.120 --> 2:00:59.280]  i'd like you to go into depth on that
[2:00:59.280 --> 2:01:03.080]  well that that my relationship uh... it goes uh...
[2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:05.320]  uh... through baltimore uh...
[2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:10.200]  uh... gene gene first had problems with the government it was as a result of a
[2:01:10.200 --> 2:01:13.400]  investigation started by the internal revenue
[2:01:13.400 --> 2:01:15.760]  uh... service office in baltimore
[2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:17.200]  but uh...
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:20.800]  uh... what was really going on in baltimore was that the u.s. attorney for
[2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:21.880]  maryland
[2:01:21.880 --> 2:01:23.760]  uh... tom debodgio
[2:01:23.760 --> 2:01:25.520]  uh... was looking into
[2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:28.760]  uh... the involvement of high-level republicans
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:31.200]  uh... in maryland and in baltimore
[2:01:31.200 --> 2:01:33.680]  uh... using public funds
[2:01:33.680 --> 2:01:36.280]  to pay for the escort to work for
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:39.160]  uh... gene palpere's panel martin associate
[2:01:39.160 --> 2:01:41.640]  uh... debodgio never targeted
[2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:45.200]  uh... palpere as a matter of fact he obviously saw her as a very
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:47.520]  uh... potentially good
[2:01:47.520 --> 2:01:49.200]  uh... witness uh...
[2:01:49.200 --> 2:01:51.300]  to prosecute uh... the people
[2:01:51.300 --> 2:01:53.000]  he was going after four
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:57.440]  uh... this uh... malfeasance uh... with uh... with public fund
[2:01:57.440 --> 2:01:59.280]  one of the guys you know what
[2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:01.120]  at norris
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:03.840]  police commissioner for baltimore
[2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:07.000]  the republican governor maryland bob erlich then made
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:09.920]  head of the maryland state police so here you have
[2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:13.280]  baltimore's top cop and then in maryland's top cop
[2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:14.800]  uh... being a customer
[2:02:14.800 --> 2:02:16.600]  of of of panel martin
[2:02:16.600 --> 2:02:19.800]  it's at that point in time when he's looking at that
[2:02:19.800 --> 2:02:23.320]  the ios begins our investigation of gene palpere
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:26.920]  and uh... also it involves the postal inspection service
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:29.000]  and that's part of the whole process
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:31.920]  uh... where uh... you know gene was the one who was being
[2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:33.880]  uh... going after but erlich

[2:07:58.600 --> 2:08:01.640]  and we know i i just discussed a little bit about porter goss and why i think
[2:08:01.640 --> 2:08:03.280]  that uh... porter goss is
[2:08:03.280 --> 2:08:08.080]  is so important is not only his ties to the initial congressional investigation
[2:08:08.080 --> 2:08:09.640]  in nine eleven not only
[2:08:09.640 --> 2:08:10.840]  his ties
[2:08:10.840 --> 2:08:13.360]  to general mahmoud and that of the i s i
[2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:16.440]  who supposedly uh... wired a hundred thousand dollars dot just before the
[2:08:16.440 --> 2:08:19.840]  attacks according to the official version that would be one-fifth
[2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:23.960]  of the funding but because he was put as the head of the cia for a very short
[2:08:23.960 --> 2:08:27.320]  time and i always wonder what he was doing there
[2:08:27.320 --> 2:08:31.280]  well he brought it he brought in his old as uh... his own cronies uh... into the
[2:08:31.280 --> 2:08:32.840]  cia porter goss
[2:08:32.840 --> 2:08:34.400]  admin a clandestine
[2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:38.080]  officer for the cia back in the sixties and for some reason he
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:41.680]  he abruptly leaves the cia resurfaces in florida
[2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:45.320]  where he starts to get active in local politics and eventually
[2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:49.600]  elected uh... as uh... as a member of the house representative
[2:08:49.600 --> 2:08:52.120]  and then becomes the chairman of the house
[2:08:52.120 --> 2:08:55.720]  uh... you know permanent select committee on intelligence the oversight
[2:08:55.720 --> 2:08:58.000]  body for the cia which you know
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:00.680]  uh... he was always interested in going
[2:09:00.680 --> 2:09:05.400]  uh... back to the cia as director and there was a very uh... unusual and
[2:09:05.400 --> 2:09:06.600]  suspicious
[2:09:06.600 --> 2:09:08.440]  suicide in in uh...
[2:09:08.440 --> 2:09:09.600]  two thousand
[2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:13.200]  uh... john millis who had been the executive director under goss
[2:09:13.200 --> 2:09:15.160]  at some sort of breaking with him
[2:09:15.160 --> 2:09:16.760]  uh... and uh... they found
[2:09:16.760 --> 2:09:19.200]  uh... gossiper we shot the death with a
[2:09:19.200 --> 2:09:22.580]  shotgun at a cd motel in fairfax virginia
[2:09:22.580 --> 2:09:26.840]  uh... that you know that was that he had another suspicious suicide so we
[2:09:26.840 --> 2:09:30.720]  not only have gene property we have many many suspicious
[2:09:30.720 --> 2:09:33.080]  quote-unquote suicide here in this one
[2:09:33.080 --> 2:09:36.160]  of course with john millis who had been a thirteen-year
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:40.000]  veteran of both the cian work for a short time at the uh... and i think the
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:41.560]  national security agency
[2:09:41.560 --> 2:09:42.800]  no it had been a
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:46.680]  uh... involved uh... it with the port of the mood jihad dean in afghanistan the
[2:09:46.680 --> 2:09:47.760]  same people
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:52.800]  were told uh... you know uh... mushroomed into and more than the al-qaeda
[2:09:52.800 --> 2:09:53.880]  later so
[2:09:53.880 --> 2:09:56.360]  uh... there's a lot of connections
[2:09:56.360 --> 2:09:59.240]  both would have never never looked at these issues
[2:09:59.240 --> 2:10:02.280]  uh... when he was conducting his investigation nine eleven
[2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:03.400]  and hopefully uh...
[2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:06.400]  uh... in a in a uh... an obama administration
[2:10:06.400 --> 2:10:09.320]  uh... he's already said obama that is first act will
[2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:14.360]  uh... be to have his new attorney general investigate the bush administration
[2:10:14.360 --> 2:10:18.520]  it any past crime and we we could only hope that they would include
[2:10:18.520 --> 2:10:22.400]  the real story about what happened on nine eleven and who the real perpetrators
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:22.960]  were
[2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:26.680]  well i'm i'm pretty skeptical about anything about my administration is
[2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:28.640]  going to do but i will say this
[2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:32.040]  as the bush administration leaves i think that we are going to see the release
[2:10:32.040 --> 2:10:34.640]  of a lot more documents i mean even uh...
[2:10:34.640 --> 2:10:36.320]  joseph biden
[2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:39.640]  who was well aware of this pakistani funding has actually talked about it on
[2:10:39.640 --> 2:10:41.560]  camera and then said it was classified
[2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:44.640]  also talked about able danger and how there'd be a lot more
[2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:47.680]  coming out about that as the administration leaves
[2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:49.280]  but i don't see it
[2:10:49.280 --> 2:10:52.160]  a huge amount of information coming out i see it
[2:10:52.160 --> 2:10:56.520]  trickling out i saw that the f f b i initial report has finally been uh...
[2:10:56.520 --> 2:10:58.520]  released the public a couple months ago
[2:10:58.520 --> 2:11:00.160]  i'm hoping that those initial
[2:11:00.160 --> 2:11:03.240]  uh... twenty seven pages that were redacted from the congressional report
[2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:04.640]  will also become public
[2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:07.320]  but i'm not that optimistic
[2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:11.200]  why do you want to talk about his his connections like who else is goss connected
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:15.080]  to that that makes him such a uh... a prominent target
[2:11:15.080 --> 2:11:18.440]  will go off course of course goes back to the sixties he was
[2:11:18.440 --> 2:11:21.280]  working at the cia station in miami
[2:11:21.280 --> 2:11:25.280]  and we now know that the cia station in miami was basically
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:27.880]  uh... you ground zero
[2:11:27.880 --> 2:11:32.860]  uh... the operations being conducted against uh... for del Castro in cuba
[2:11:32.860 --> 2:11:34.120]  it's also where
[2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:37.320]  uh... the plot to kill president kennedy was personally you know
[2:11:37.320 --> 2:11:41.600]  the kennedy was it was first going to be hit in miami and they had to change it
[2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:45.040]  uh... later to uh... to dallas because the miami
[2:11:45.040 --> 2:11:46.640]  operation uh...
[2:11:46.640 --> 2:11:49.560]  uh... wasn't going to be successful so
[2:11:49.560 --> 2:11:52.280]  but we have got his dirty fingerprints all over
[2:11:52.280 --> 2:11:54.160]  that that time period where we
[2:11:54.160 --> 2:11:55.040]  we thought
[2:11:55.040 --> 2:11:57.120]  of some of the people that came out of that
[2:11:57.120 --> 2:11:58.560]  cia operation
[2:11:58.560 --> 2:11:59.800]  also included
[2:11:59.800 --> 2:12:03.160]  uh... some people were later caught burglarizing democratic national
[2:12:03.160 --> 2:12:06.760]  headquarters at the watergate again we go back to the watergate
[2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:09.520]  bosses poker parties with the shirlington lima
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:10.720]  being bring it over
[2:12:10.720 --> 2:12:13.360]  the escorts uh... panel martin escorts
[2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:15.920]  with the watergate uh... the break in
[2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:18.600]  uh... with that the watergate uh... so here we
[2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:19.760]  you know one thing about
[2:12:19.760 --> 2:12:22.120]  these guys is that they very rarely
[2:12:22.120 --> 2:12:25.320]  uh... change the playbook the playbook remains the same
[2:12:25.320 --> 2:12:27.960]  only and sometimes the faces change button
[2:12:27.960 --> 2:12:31.800]  the case of porter goss is the same porter goss with the cia station in
[2:12:31.800 --> 2:12:32.800]  miami
[2:12:32.800 --> 2:12:36.240]  plotting to kill and uh... castro in a big cuba
[2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:38.920]  the same porter goss it may have had his fingerprints
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:40.920]  at least with people involved uh...
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:43.400]  uh... with the assassination of president kennedy
[2:12:43.400 --> 2:12:47.600]  and the same porter goss it seems that the fingerprints on nine eleven
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:50.480]  thank you so much for going over that for the listeners that really shows you
[2:12:50.480 --> 2:12:52.800]  how these intelligence spooks really keep
[2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:54.400]  keep through history
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:57.280]  and and you know they get away with it you know it looks like this guy's gonna
[2:12:57.280 --> 2:12:59.280]  get away with especially now that uh...
[2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:02.640]  palfrey is gone do you think there's a chance that her list is ever going to
[2:13:02.640 --> 2:13:03.720]  come to light
[2:13:03.720 --> 2:13:06.000]  of who her customers actually were
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:09.880]  well we've got a couple of what we have of course is the phone records which
[2:13:09.880 --> 2:13:13.320]  he made public unfortunately we only were able to call
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:17.080]  a few people off of that listing you know including louisiana
[2:13:17.080 --> 2:13:20.480]  republican senator david better than i would note that yesterday that
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:22.040]  senate ethics committee
[2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:24.960]  uh... dropped its ethics investigation of better
[2:13:24.960 --> 2:13:25.960]  the reason given
[2:13:25.960 --> 2:13:30.240]  because palfrey committed suicide well that has nothing to do with whether
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:34.640]  uh... better uh... violated senate ethics rule the mere fact that the
[2:13:34.640 --> 2:13:36.480]  them the so-called madame
[2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:40.240]  tell yourself i don't understand how the senate can drop the charges against
[2:13:40.240 --> 2:13:40.800]  better
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:42.640]  and again it seems like her
[2:13:42.640 --> 2:13:46.680]  quote unquote suicide seem to be very convenient for a lot of people
[2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:48.560]  uh... uh... including
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:52.560]  uh... people like better and others and and i've already reported chaining was
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:54.480]  also one of her clients when you
[2:13:54.480 --> 2:13:56.800]  the head of albert in ninety so
[2:13:56.800 --> 2:13:58.880]  so uh... but the but uh... you know that these
[2:13:58.880 --> 2:14:00.080]  these these uh...
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:02.680]  these people are you know in city or stuff
[2:14:02.680 --> 2:14:05.440]  uh... of the cost is just one of many uh...
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:07.440]  abramoff is another one uh...
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:10.160]  of course he's doing time in prison but uh...
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:10.920]  uh...
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:14.200]  uh... abramoff is really their sacrificial lamb is he not he's a guy
[2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:17.560]  that they can throw out into the public that people won't dig into
[2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:21.320]  too far he'll serve a few years in prison and he'll be let go
[2:14:21.320 --> 2:14:24.840]  i'm sure he's on bush high up on bush's bob bob pardon with her
[2:14:24.840 --> 2:14:26.720]  commutation with uh...
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:29.080]  uh... at the end of this term i think we'll see
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:31.160]  we'll see abramoff leave prison
[2:14:31.160 --> 2:14:34.560]  i think we'll see uh... be quite a few others probably jonathan pollard the
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:38.360]  israeli by all that's a lot of out and i think we'll see many others
[2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:40.640]  well jonathan pollard's let out i i i
[2:14:40.640 --> 2:14:43.920]  that'll be tough for me to believe but i can see i mean they've just pardon
[2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:45.640]  whoever they feel they want to
[2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:48.880]  one of uh... abramoff's ties that i found really interesting
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:51.840]  was the tie to the gambling cruise ship
[2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:55.640]  off of uh... off the coast of florida you want to talk about that a little bit
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:58.040]  well yeah abramoff purchased uh...
[2:14:58.040 --> 2:15:01.800]  uh... some cruise casino boats from in a lot of florida business man named
[2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:03.520]  dust bullet uh...
[2:15:03.520 --> 2:15:07.400]  and then bullet uh... later today with the manky panky involvement
[2:15:07.400 --> 2:15:09.520]  missed uh... dealing wanted to get it
[2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:11.560]  cruise boats back but uh...
[2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:15.420]  bullets with gun down uh... ganglion assassination style
[2:15:15.420 --> 2:15:19.160]  uh... on the street in broad daylight in fort lauderdale florida
[2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:20.800]  uh... we do know uh...
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:23.320]  uh... from uh... certain reports that
[2:15:23.320 --> 2:15:28.440]  uh... that to the nine eleven hijackers opera and possibly al shahee
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:32.120]  were spotted uh... on uh... abramoff
[2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:33.760]  uh... uh... on cruise
[2:15:33.760 --> 2:15:37.120]  uh... uh... boat that i am when abramoff uh... owned it
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:40.120]  out of madera beach park in your south of uh...
[2:15:40.120 --> 2:15:41.240]  on your tampa
[2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:43.160]  uh... and uh... that that uh...
[2:15:43.160 --> 2:15:46.640]  uh... this was just a few days before nine eleven so this notion
[2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:51.120]  that these were these uh... islamist radicals praying the hour before they
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:53.080]  hijacked plain split-throats and
[2:15:53.080 --> 2:15:56.160]  and put them in the building is nonsensical because
[2:15:56.160 --> 2:16:00.400]  i also know that the hijackers who hijacked united ninety three out of
[2:16:00.400 --> 2:16:01.960]  newark the night before
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:05.840]  or at a uh... uh... a strip club in wane new jersey
[2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:08.440]  uh... sticking dollar bills into g-string so
[2:16:08.440 --> 2:16:09.920]  so these don't sound like the
[2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:13.440]  uh... mongolams uh... at least one portrayed in the movie about united
[2:16:13.440 --> 2:16:16.720]  ninety three that we're shaving themselves their body air and praying
[2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:17.200]  that
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:20.720]  praying the hour and reading out of the coran before they hijacked the
[2:16:20.720 --> 2:16:22.160]  airplanes it's just total
[2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:23.840]  it's just more nonsense uh...
[2:16:23.840 --> 2:16:26.360]  uh... it that that it was created uh...
[2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:28.920]  uh... as almost like a hollywood type uh...
[2:16:28.920 --> 2:16:30.720]  disinformation campaign
[2:16:30.720 --> 2:16:33.880]  these these guys thought that was a known to be a drug mule
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:37.760]  uh... for people probably associated with u-s intelligence
[2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:41.760]  he'd been cited often at the uh... officers club at maxwell air force
[2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:43.200]  based in alabama
[2:16:43.200 --> 2:16:44.520]  he was uh... he was uh...
[2:16:44.520 --> 2:16:47.240]  uh... uh... an egyptian air force uh...
[2:16:47.240 --> 2:16:48.520]  uh... officer
[2:16:48.520 --> 2:16:50.800]  so uh... the mere fact that he'd
[2:16:50.800 --> 2:16:54.640]  he'd been working uh... alongside u-s intelligence that that
[2:16:54.640 --> 2:16:57.080]  for years should should have told us that
[2:16:57.080 --> 2:17:00.160]  all of us uh... that uh... what we were told about
[2:17:00.160 --> 2:17:03.520]  nine eleven and what was the actual case of nine eleven or
[2:17:03.520 --> 2:17:05.120]  two entirely different things
[2:17:05.120 --> 2:17:08.200]  well i'd also like to point out that uh... also uh... through a freedom of
[2:17:08.200 --> 2:17:12.920]  information actor quest we know that a mohammed are attended the maxwell air
[2:17:12.920 --> 2:17:16.320]  force base academy i mean that's that's admitted they don't say whether it is
[2:17:16.320 --> 2:17:16.960]  the
[2:17:16.960 --> 2:17:18.840]  mohammed are i mean gimme a break
[2:17:18.840 --> 2:17:21.800]  i mean we have all these i witness accounts that he always had money he
[2:17:21.800 --> 2:17:25.520]  always had cocaine he enjoyed the company of strippers he's on gambling
[2:17:25.520 --> 2:17:26.160]  boats
[2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:28.320]  and not only that but he was reported
[2:17:28.320 --> 2:17:30.960]  as one of these guys that was gonna hijack a plane
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:34.680]  uh... by james woods the actor and uh... another woman on the airplane
[2:17:34.680 --> 2:17:37.680]  uh... you know he went on fox news and talked about this a couple months before
[2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:39.440]  nine eleven he said he spotted out of
[2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:41.840]  and three of the other hijackers in jumpsuits
[2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:45.040]  thought they were gonna hijack the plane thought so so much that after he got
[2:17:45.040 --> 2:17:46.960]  off the plane he and a stewardess
[2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:49.080]  actually filed a report with the f a a
[2:17:49.080 --> 2:17:51.760]  but apparently was never followed up on wane
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:53.280]  of course not and we know
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:56.440]  we know all this with you know that the right of the family
[2:17:56.440 --> 2:18:00.280]  uh... calling rally wanted to get a uh... a search warrant up in minneapolis
[2:18:00.280 --> 2:18:01.400]  for computer
[2:18:01.400 --> 2:18:04.360]  it was by me by the f b i in washington
[2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:06.720]  it's quite quite clear what happened
[2:18:06.720 --> 2:18:09.480]  that uh... in the night of any of these people so well
[2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:12.400]  it was a it was part of the u s intelligence now
[2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:15.480]  there were there were there were elements of u s intelligence in u s
[2:18:15.480 --> 2:18:19.520]  law enforcement that aided and embedded in the worst crime we've seen
[2:18:19.520 --> 2:18:20.760]  in this country
[2:18:20.760 --> 2:18:21.880]  probably ever
[2:18:21.880 --> 2:18:23.440]  uh... and uh...
[2:18:23.440 --> 2:18:24.600]  and of course we're
[2:18:24.600 --> 2:18:28.000]  we're we're we're told to believe the nine eleven commission report
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:31.880]  uh... which was engineered by philrell account now we know the call wrote
[2:18:31.880 --> 2:18:36.480]  influence that report doing the original chairman was put the henry kittinger
[2:18:36.480 --> 2:18:38.440]  the biggest american war criminal
[2:18:38.440 --> 2:18:40.520]  of this and the last century
[2:18:40.520 --> 2:18:42.880]  uh... and and we're supposed to believe this
[2:18:42.880 --> 2:18:44.120]  this nonsense
[2:18:44.120 --> 2:18:46.080]  uh... philrell account by the way
[2:18:46.080 --> 2:18:49.120]  uh... comes from the miller institute out of the university virginia and the
[2:18:49.120 --> 2:18:50.520]  miller institute
[2:18:50.520 --> 2:18:52.800]  has made its name in china debunked
[2:18:52.800 --> 2:18:55.880]  anyone who would question the official version of a version of what happened
[2:18:55.880 --> 2:18:59.120]  to president kennedy and dollars they stand by the war in commission
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:03.280]  when everybody else with an outfit that he knows that the war commission
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:06.960]  uh... report just like the nine eleven commission report was it was uh... was
[2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:08.400]  near fantasy
[2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:11.320]  absolutely one of the things i like to point out is that
[2:19:11.320 --> 2:19:15.120]  although it's very hyped that able danger identified out of prior to nine
[2:19:15.120 --> 2:19:19.120]  eleven they don't talk about the other three hijackers that they also identified
[2:19:19.120 --> 2:19:22.320]  and they identified khalid al-madar and the waf alzahami
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:25.880]  well it turns out those two guys are living with and renting from
[2:19:25.880 --> 2:19:27.880]  a tested fb i inform it
[2:19:27.880 --> 2:19:30.320]  and then when it comes time for them to talk to officials
[2:19:30.320 --> 2:19:34.480]  the fb i is warning that so nobody gets to talk to this informant i want to get
[2:19:34.480 --> 2:19:36.200]  your take on that on the other side
[2:19:36.200 --> 2:19:43.200]  it's the alex jones show on jason bermas sitting in prison planet dot com
[2:19:47.600 --> 2:19:48.480]  it is a big

[2:22:51.600 --> 2:22:55.560]  disease such as cancer or diabetes acidic waste is created by the types of
[2:22:55.560 --> 2:22:59.880]  food we eat what we drink the environment and our high stress lifestyles it's
[2:22:59.880 --> 2:23:03.440]  these choices that cause decreased energy weight gain and eventually disease
[2:23:03.440 --> 2:23:07.280]  the easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking

[2:23:47.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  in 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:05.200]  Mississippi we took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the
[2:24:05.200 --> 2:24:09.520]  bloody British in a town in New Orleans we fired our guns and the British kept
[2:24:09.520 --> 2:24:14.240]  becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired once more and
[2:24:14.240 --> 2:24:19.880]  they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[2:24:19.880 --> 2:24:24.440]  we look down a river and we see the British come and they must have been a
[2:24:24.440 --> 2:24:28.640]  hundred of beaten on the drums they stepped so high and they made the bugles
[2:24:28.640 --> 2:24:33.280]  ring we stood beside our cotton veils didn't say a thing we fired our guns and
[2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:37.680]  the British kept becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired
[2:24:37.680 --> 2:24:41.840]  once more and they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of
[2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:45.800]  Mexico all right we're back it's the Alex Jones show and I want to remind folks
[2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:50.200]  that Alex is going to be screening his latest picture the 9-11 Chronicles part
[2:24:50.200 --> 2:24:56.880]  one truth rising over at the Alamo draft house off South Lamar I believe the
[2:24:56.880 --> 2:25:02.320]  screenings will be Saturday May 17th at 4 p.m. and Sunday May 18th at 7 p.m. Alex
[2:25:02.320 --> 2:25:05.760]  is going to be there and remember this film won't be released until mid-June
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:09.520]  early July so if you want to get a sneak peek the only way is the Alamo
[2:25:09.520 --> 2:25:13.240]  draft house I also want to let people know that I interviewed Tommy Chong in
[2:25:13.240 --> 2:25:17.040]  the first hour just an explosive interview about the drug war and 9-11
[2:25:17.040 --> 2:25:22.640]  and you can listen to that on the refeed over at info wars.com after the
[2:25:22.640 --> 2:25:27.320]  fourth hour we're talking to Wayne Madsen and Wayne I brought up the black ops
[2:25:27.320 --> 2:25:32.200]  program able danger how you know they were working with Centcom they identified
[2:25:32.200 --> 2:25:36.400]  for the hijackers prior to 9-11 they tried to go to the FBI over a dozen
[2:25:36.400 --> 2:25:41.480]  times they were thwarted of course the attacks of 9-11 happen then Anthony
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:45.000]  Schaefer goes and talks to Philip Zellicow prior to the 9-11 Commission
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:48.480]  report and it doesn't make the report does it well why do you think that is
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:54.680]  well I mean we do know that there were all kinds of intelligence reports prior
[2:25:54.680 --> 2:25:59.720]  to 9-11 not just from our own intelligence agencies but from a number
[2:25:59.720 --> 2:26:05.080]  of foreign intelligence agencies that all seem to have been ignored as we heard
[2:26:05.080 --> 2:26:10.240]  from probably intelligence agencies law enforcement agencies in over 30 countries
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:16.760]  that try to tell us something was up including Russia and these these were
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:21.720]  all conveniently ignored I think it's obvious but you know that what these
[2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:26.640]  foreign agencies in our own agencies found out was there was this plan afoot
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:32.600]  to create this what the neocons called a new Pearl Harbor so they could push
[2:26:32.600 --> 2:26:37.000]  their sorted agenda which will ever since 9-11 that's all we've seen we've
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:42.440]  seen the erosion of the US Constitution we've seen torture now adopted as a
[2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:51.640]  as a policy by the administration renditioning kidnapping you know political
[2:26:51.640 --> 2:26:56.720]  assassinations as a whole host of things that's really the hallmark of the
[2:26:56.720 --> 2:27:02.040]  fascist nation well one of the things that really ties it in for me is a J.
[2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:05.960]  Michael Springman's testimony he was one of the heads of the consulate in
[2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:12.240]  Jeddah back in the late 80s early 90s and when he would go through and deny
[2:27:12.240 --> 2:27:17.400]  these guys visas they would get let in through national security purposes by
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:21.360]  his supervisors now at first he thought this was just visa fraud somebody in his
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:24.680]  agency taking kickbacks when he got back to the states he said he talked to
[2:27:24.680 --> 2:27:29.360]  people within the CIA who told them this was part of an ongoing program to funnel
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:34.800]  in Islamic militants into this country for their asset Osama bin Laden and then
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:37.960]  you find out that a lot of these hijackers or the supposed hijackers
[2:27:37.960 --> 2:27:43.000]  were funneled in through the consulate at Jeddah right right and and this goes
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  back of course to the time when the US supported the Afghan Mujahideen against
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:53.040]  the Soviets and we're giving them a you know singer surface they're a portable
[2:27:53.040 --> 2:27:57.960]  missile launchers again the Saudis were given them the money that the Israelis
[2:27:57.960 --> 2:28:03.560]  and the Egyptians were giving a giving them the weaponry and again we see the
[2:28:03.560 --> 2:28:08.400]  same who do we see with their fingerprints all over 9-11 well the
[2:28:08.400 --> 2:28:13.560]  same group we see we see you know odd as an Egyptian the others are Saudis
[2:28:13.560 --> 2:28:20.080]  Saudi money and of course Israeli art students and movers and running all over
[2:28:20.080 --> 2:28:26.880]  not only the country in close proximity these Saudi hijackers but also a scene
[2:28:26.880 --> 2:28:33.000]  of seeing with a camera Liberty State Park said it with a set up on the trade
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:36.440]  center before the first plane hit so obviously they had advanced knowledge
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:39.600]  absolutely I'm actually covering that in the next film people in the trade
[2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:43.080]  center yeah absolutely and I'm actually covering that in my next film you're
[2:28:43.080 --> 2:28:47.640]  talking about urban moving systems the art ring and then obviously their
[2:28:47.640 --> 2:28:52.200]  connections to Amdok's and Converse which is really how they they accumulate
[2:28:52.200 --> 2:28:56.400]  all this intelligence and when I saw that Fox News piece which was a four-part
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:29:01.400]  series they really break it down how this firing was able to infiltrate the
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:04.800]  most upper echelons of government and there's an article out there that you
[2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:09.400]  may not be aware of it's called digital moles inside the White House and it
[2:29:09.400 --> 2:29:14.000]  really goes through how these hijackers supposedly had every security code ever
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:18.200]  for the National Security Agency the Drug Enforcement Agency the FBI the NSA
[2:29:18.200 --> 2:29:21.520]  on the morning of 9-11 and that's where these threats to Air Force one and
[2:29:21.520 --> 2:29:25.480]  others came from Wayne Matts and I thank you so much for joining us this half an

[2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:44.440]  Willie Nelson but you're gonna want to go to info wars dot com after that if you
[2:33:44.440 --> 2:33:48.160]  missed any of the first hour because I interviewed Tommy Chong not only on the
[2:33:48.160 --> 2:33:53.440]  American drug war picture and a K aka Tommy Chong which of course American
[2:33:53.440 --> 2:33:57.280]  drug war you can get over it info wars dot com but we also talked 911 truth
[2:33:57.280 --> 2:34:01.800]  and obviously Tommy himself has his questions we also talk Schwarzenegger a
[2:34:01.800 --> 2:34:05.800]  little bit at the at the tail end of that section but we have another guest on
[2:34:05.800 --> 2:34:11.520]  right now we have a mic from natural news dot com on with us how are you Mike
[2:34:11.520 --> 2:34:16.840]  hey I'm doing great thanks for having me on the show today no problem man well
[2:34:16.840 --> 2:34:19.800]  it's really nice to be here and today in Congress you know they're talking about
[2:34:19.800 --> 2:34:25.160]  this potential ban on direct-to-consumer drug advertising I know
[2:34:25.160 --> 2:34:29.720]  your listeners know very well that drug advertising is a massive marketing scam
[2:34:29.720 --> 2:34:34.840]  and maybe finally for the first time in a long time we might have a possibility
[2:34:34.840 --> 2:34:38.440]  of banning those ads are at least putting a moratorium on them for the
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:41.360]  first three years wouldn't that be interesting it would be and these are
[2:34:41.360 --> 2:34:45.760]  the ads that come up on TV and they say oh do you have trouble sleeping they
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:50.560]  list off like 47 different symptoms right about anything and then and then they
[2:34:50.560 --> 2:34:55.280]  go you need this drug yeah exactly now many people may not know that drug
[2:34:55.280 --> 2:35:01.520]  advertising was illegal in the United States until about 1997 or 98 when it
[2:35:01.520 --> 2:35:07.440]  really went into effect and since then drug companies have massively escalated
[2:35:07.440 --> 2:35:12.560]  the drug advertising over five billion dollars a year just last year and of
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:17.120]  course drug sales skyrocketed too but what happened is they're now pushing
[2:35:17.120 --> 2:35:20.720]  disease more than they're pushing medicine they want to convince everybody
[2:35:20.720 --> 2:35:24.120]  that they're sick and that's how they sell more drug and it's just become a
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:28.200]  giant car that that's where things stand today well absolutely and then you look
[2:35:28.200 --> 2:35:32.960]  at the side effects on this and it's like I you know may cause anal leakage
[2:35:32.960 --> 2:35:37.400]  or heart attacks you know and you're just like what right so what they do is
[2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:42.000]  they exaggerate the benefits and then they minimize any of the side effects
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:46.200]  and another thing they do that a lot of people don't know is that the FDA does
[2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:52.520]  not conduct any drug research at all okay the FDA doesn't test any drugs the FDA
[2:35:52.520 --> 2:35:57.360]  relies on the drug companies to do their own testing and then to submit results
[2:35:57.360 --> 2:36:02.240]  to the FDA that they want the FDA to see and guess what if you're a big greedy
[2:36:02.240 --> 2:36:06.800]  evil corporate drug company you bury the test results that you don't want the
[2:36:06.800 --> 2:36:12.240]  FDA to see so essentially the so-called scientific evidence behind this
[2:36:12.240 --> 2:36:18.480]  industry is nothing but fraud they just they basically engineer the test that
[2:36:18.480 --> 2:36:22.680]  they want they forward the results to the FDA that they want the FDA to see and
[2:36:22.680 --> 2:36:26.320]  then the FDA says yeah this is safe and effective they rubber stamp approval
[2:36:26.320 --> 2:36:30.680]  they allow doctors to prescribe it to patients and then Americans start to die
[2:36:30.680 --> 2:36:34.160]  and let's not forget that most of those people on the FDA that do approve this
[2:36:34.160 --> 2:36:38.040]  stuff have connections to a lot of these these drug companies you know they end
[2:36:38.040 --> 2:36:42.600]  up on their boards or they end up as a CEO or as an advisor to a lot of these
[2:36:42.600 --> 2:36:47.520]  guys you're exactly right in the last major drug decision about anti-inflammatory
[2:36:47.520 --> 2:36:53.640]  drugs for example the FDA expert panel that voted to keep it on the market had
[2:36:53.640 --> 2:36:58.840]  I think it was two-thirds of that panel had ties to the drug industry either
[2:36:58.840 --> 2:37:02.360]  they were on the payroll of the drug companies or they had investments in drug
[2:37:02.360 --> 2:37:06.560]  companies and the FDA by the way doesn't think that they have any obligation to
[2:37:06.560 --> 2:37:11.520]  disclose this corruption to the American public so with a big secret yeah
[2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:15.920]  absolutely it's just another example how the lobbyists really do control our
[2:37:15.920 --> 2:37:19.600]  government because again you know you're a congressman you're a senator you make
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:25.160]  something like $80,000 maybe $120,000 a year you work for say
[2:37:25.160 --> 2:37:28.720]  Pfizer and you know they're they're pumping in a couple million dollar
[2:37:28.720 --> 2:37:34.600]  paycheck a year well yeah big pharma is the second wealthiest group of
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:39.360]  corporations in the world probably number one probably is big oil and of
[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:43.160]  course the defense contractors aren't far behind but you know drug companies
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:46.600]  make billions of dollars it's really a trillion dollar industry if you add it
[2:37:46.600 --> 2:37:50.560]  all up globally that's a lot of money floating around there and you can bet
[2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:54.320]  that money finds its way into the pockets of the lawmakers it's part of
[2:37:54.320 --> 2:37:58.080]  the problem too and this is why the Alex Jones show is so important because the
[2:37:58.080 --> 2:38:03.320]  mainstream media is on the take as well so you don't get honest reporting about
[2:38:03.320 --> 2:38:07.960]  drugs about how dangerous they are or about the natural health options that
[2:38:07.960 --> 2:38:12.560]  people really should have access to but they've been denied access to but that's
[2:38:12.560 --> 2:38:16.280]  the crime that's going on here absolutely they're able to purchase as much
[2:38:16.280 --> 2:38:20.360]  time as they want for advertising and then you know I actually saw Michael
[2:38:20.360 --> 2:38:24.680]  Moore on Wolf Blitzer discussing this after the release of sicko like he's
[2:38:24.680 --> 2:38:29.000]  like well you know Dr. Sanjay Gupta isn't gonna go against your sponsors is he
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:33.480]  Wolf I mean that's that's that's a multi-million dollar industry your sponsors
[2:38:33.480 --> 2:38:38.240]  I mean you can't have a TV show without sponsor money can you Wolf no exactly
[2:38:38.240 --> 2:38:43.440]  and if you remember remember the dot-com boom and then crash the media
[2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:48.760]  suffered in a very desperate way for revenues after the dot-com crash because
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:52.280]  it was the technology companies that were propping them up well guess who's
[2:38:52.280 --> 2:38:58.320]  swept in and filled the empty space the drug companies and it was from 2001 to
[2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:02.240]  today where you really thought a ramp up in drug company advertising so the
[2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:08.520]  media has become essentially the lackeys of big pharma and that's why you see so
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:13.320]  many articles out there about oh look this this new miracle drug and gee this
[2:39:13.320 --> 2:39:17.760]  this could reduce risk of cancer by 50% when if you look at the study that's
[2:39:17.760 --> 2:39:24.080]  really maybe one woman out of 200 might be saved by it not 50% reduction
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:29.480]  something far less well I see you know the elite laughing at us because not
[2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:34.080]  only are they a zombifying the masses with things like Ritalin and Prozac but
[2:39:34.080 --> 2:39:40.200]  we're actually paying for it yeah exactly we are paying the highest prices in
[2:39:40.200 --> 2:39:44.440]  the world for pharmaceuticals we're paying ripoff prices and here's the
[2:39:44.440 --> 2:39:50.000]  kicker the FDA is enforcing a monopoly and in fact the US government is
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:54.440]  enforcing this monopoly and did you know by the way you know they say you can't
[2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:59.240]  buy drugs from Canada or Mexico because they might be tainted well we just
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:05.680]  learned last week that the drug heparin is manufactured in China and it's
[2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:09.560]  brought in from China it's imported from China by these drug companies and it
[2:40:09.560 --> 2:40:13.520]  turned out that it had painted toxic ingredients and it started killing
[2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:18.160]  people but the FDA approved that drug is safe and effective and it said if you
[2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:22.080]  buy that from the US it's going to be safe turns out it made in China with
[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:25.800]  toxic chemicals well that's just fear mongering to keep people away from
[2:40:25.800 --> 2:40:30.080]  smaller drug prices even though they're still just as toxic but they want you
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:34.360]  to pay these exorbitant prices in this country just to take down the standard
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:38.280]  of living of the average American and then they brainwash you you know on the
[2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:41.920]  TV god it's like 24 hours a day now especially if you're watching the right
[2:40:41.920 --> 2:40:45.840]  network on you need this drug you need this drug and like like I said before
[2:40:45.840 --> 2:40:50.280]  there's just a slew of symptoms that these miracle drugs supposedly help and
[2:40:50.280 --> 2:40:53.800]  then like you said before they marginalize oh yeah you might have a
[2:40:53.800 --> 2:40:58.400]  heart attack or oh it may cause kidney problems oh no big deal well it turns
[2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:01.560]  out that even when these drugs work as they're supposed to work let's say
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:07.200]  lowering a cholesterol number in a woman who is 50 years old well if you take a
[2:41:07.200 --> 2:41:11.520]  hard look at the science it turns out that changing that number has zero
[2:41:11.520 --> 2:41:15.840]  benefits to that person she has no lower risk of heart attack or stroke what
[2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:19.880]  so ever her risk of dying in fact goes up from taking the drug it doesn't go
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:24.200]  down sure the number looks better on paper but she's sicker because she's
[2:41:24.200 --> 2:41:28.560]  taking an artificial synthetic chemical so that the fact is when I say this
[2:41:28.560 --> 2:41:33.680]  industry is a scam I mean it across the board they are pushing dangerous deadly
[2:41:33.680 --> 2:41:38.080]  chemicals based on nothing but fraudulent science the government's in on it
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:42.320]  the FDA is in on it the media is in on it and people are dying and I think we've
[2:41:42.320 --> 2:41:46.320]  had enough it's time to stop this so what do we do what what's the next step
[2:41:46.320 --> 2:41:49.880]  what what should my listeners do to take action against this what they can do
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:54.400]  right now is contact their representatives in Washington and tell
[2:41:54.400 --> 2:41:59.960]  them that they support a ban of DTC advertising that means direct to consumer
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:04.960]  they support an outright ban on DTC advertising of pharmaceuticals you know
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:09.680]  it's illegal in Canada it's illegal in Japan in the UK it's illegal in every
[2:42:09.680 --> 2:42:14.760]  country in the world except New Zealand and the United States and it was
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:19.000]  illegal you know before 1997 so that's what they can do if we get enough
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  pressure on these lawmakers and expose this story shine some light on it we
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:28.200]  might be able to stop this drug advertising from continuing well the TV
[2:42:28.200 --> 2:42:32.560]  is obviously the number one brainwashing tool in America so it was vital for
[2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:37.000]  these people to get on the television and really in the last five years I've
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:41.880]  seen such an expansion of the names of these drugs the quantity of these drugs
[2:42:41.880 --> 2:42:47.400]  the quote-unquote benefits of these drugs but you rarely see especially in the
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:52.600]  mainstream media any criticism of these drugs any criticism of the vaccinations
[2:42:52.600 --> 2:42:56.320]  and then when Michael Moore puts out sicko which I don't agree with all of by
[2:42:56.320 --> 2:43:00.040]  the way I don't need a socialist or a system but it is it is a pretty good
[2:43:00.040 --> 2:43:04.800]  flick and it does shine to light some of these issues they totally marginalize
[2:43:04.800 --> 2:43:09.080]  it it was nowhere near as successful as say a Fahrenheit 9-11 or even a
[2:43:09.080 --> 2:43:14.200]  bowling for Columbine and it didn't have quite that push it really shows you how
[2:43:14.200 --> 2:43:18.240]  that the drug companies in this country seem to be on top well you get to
[2:43:18.240 --> 2:43:23.000]  realize how much of our national economy is tied up with disease the cancer
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:28.440]  industry and it is a for-profit industry employs well over a hundred thousand
[2:43:28.440 --> 2:43:33.760]  people now if we taught Americans the truth about how they can cure cancer or
[2:43:33.760 --> 2:43:37.160]  how they can prevent you know four out of five cancers can be prevented with
[2:43:37.160 --> 2:43:41.840]  vitamin D alone and you can get that for free from sunlight and if we taught
[2:43:41.840 --> 2:43:46.920]  Americans this thing the cancer industry would collapse those people would be out
[2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:52.280]  of jobs because they depend on ongoing sickness and disease in order to take
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:57.280]  home a salary and to seem important for their egos for their profits for their
[2:43:57.280 --> 2:44:01.680]  power over people they depend on sickness and that's why the cancer industry in my
[2:44:01.680 --> 2:44:06.400]  opinion has no interest whatsoever in curing cancer it only wants to maintain
[2:44:06.400 --> 2:44:10.880]  this disease and keep people trapped in a system of conventional cancer treatment
[2:44:10.880 --> 2:44:15.120]  and that all ties back into i.g. Farben who went around this country and offered
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:21.360]  funding to those who would go to the approach of radiation and chemotherapy
[2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:24.360]  and all that good stuff and most people took that funding and they changed
[2:44:24.360 --> 2:44:28.240]  their the way of thinking on cancer a world without cancer by G. Edward
[2:44:28.240 --> 2:44:32.720]  Griffin is really a great overlook of that whole situation that's a great
[2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:37.240]  book and Ed has done some fantastic work he's one of the truth tellers out
[2:44:37.240 --> 2:44:42.120]  there who really has valuable information but again you know CNN will
[2:44:42.120 --> 2:44:45.320]  never have him on Fox News wouldn't have him on either they don't want his
[2:44:45.320 --> 2:44:49.200]  information to get out to the public because then the cancer industry would
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:53.160]  just collapse and the same thing is true with the diabetes industry we could
[2:44:53.160 --> 2:44:55.960]  cure diabetes in people about two weeks
[2:44:55.960 --> 2:44:58.320]  i mean we know how to do it it's very simple
[2:44:58.320 --> 2:45:00.800]  but they don't want that information to be put out there
[2:45:00.800 --> 2:45:04.480]  yeah they'd rather hook you for the rest of your life on taking insulin and
[2:45:04.480 --> 2:45:06.760]  basically fear-mongering you and you know
[2:45:06.760 --> 2:45:10.240]  uh... you mentioned g edward griffin and and uh... how great his research is for
[2:45:10.240 --> 2:45:13.880]  all you guys out there that are prison planet dot tv subscribers alex had him
[2:45:13.880 --> 2:45:15.520]  in studio last week
[2:45:15.520 --> 2:45:17.800]  i've met him on several occasions had dinner with him
[2:45:17.800 --> 2:45:20.160]  and you can check that interview out on prison planet
[2:45:20.160 --> 2:45:23.480]  uh... dot tv just another one of the great things that we offer here
[2:45:23.480 --> 2:45:25.040]  at the info wars team
[2:45:25.040 --> 2:45:26.360]  but yet g edward griffin
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:29.360]  you know he talks about the seventeen and and that vitamin and it being
[2:45:29.360 --> 2:45:30.400]  suppressed and
[2:45:30.400 --> 2:45:33.240]  how it it has all these benefits against cancer
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:35.720]  do you think that's ever going to reach the masses
[2:45:35.720 --> 2:45:38.200]  no i mean the fb a maintain
[2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:40.960]  a deliberate campaign of censorship
[2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:44.000]  and they want to send to scientific knowledge as well
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:47.360]  i gave the example on my website about cherry
[2:45:47.360 --> 2:45:51.040]  these cherry growers were linking to scientific studies showing that cherries
[2:45:51.040 --> 2:45:54.440]  could reduce arthritis inflammation very dramatically
[2:45:54.440 --> 2:45:57.200]  the fb a threatened them threatened to put him out of business
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:00.520]  if they didn't remove the links to the scientific studies
[2:46:00.520 --> 2:46:02.840]  so we now have a government agency
[2:46:02.840 --> 2:46:05.480]  that is enforcing ignorance or
[2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:08.400]  scientific illiteracy it's enforcing it
[2:46:08.400 --> 2:46:10.720]  it wants the population to be uninformed
[2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:15.080]  to be stupid to be trapped in a system where they think they have no options
[2:46:15.080 --> 2:46:17.280]  and so far that's what's been happening
[2:46:17.280 --> 2:46:20.200]  will live in a free country as your listeners well-known
[2:46:20.200 --> 2:46:24.200]  we live in a very tightly controlled monopoly of ideas monopoly of
[2:46:24.200 --> 2:46:25.480]  commercialism
[2:46:25.480 --> 2:46:26.840]  in a monopoly of medicine
[2:46:26.840 --> 2:46:27.940]  that's what we live under
[2:46:27.940 --> 2:46:31.160]  yeah we live in a really it's it's a it's a mall culture
[2:46:31.160 --> 2:46:35.860]  where we're we're taught to idolize our sports heroes and our uh...
[2:46:35.860 --> 2:46:39.800]  television and movie stars and everything else seems to be secondary or
[2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:40.760]  come even
[2:46:40.760 --> 2:46:42.200]  even third or not at all
[2:46:42.200 --> 2:46:45.000]  and what i tell my listeners is you've got to make this type of information
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:48.160]  primary in your life you've got to share this with your friends and your
[2:46:48.160 --> 2:46:50.880]  family and you got to start practicing it
[2:46:50.880 --> 2:46:52.720]  and all that other stuff is secondary
[2:46:52.720 --> 2:46:55.360]  uh... you know the mortgage on the house is really secondary if you're not
[2:46:55.360 --> 2:46:58.160]  going to have a house to live in or if you're not going to be alive to live in
[2:46:58.160 --> 2:46:59.720]  the house is you're not healthy
[2:46:59.720 --> 2:47:01.920]  yeah exactly exactly it
[2:47:01.920 --> 2:47:05.000]  we've got a whole generation at risk right now you know the next generation
[2:47:05.000 --> 2:47:07.520]  are american children right now
[2:47:07.520 --> 2:47:10.680]  they are being attacked by what i call
[2:47:10.680 --> 2:47:12.560]  chemical weapons of mass
[2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:15.540]  neural destruction and those are of course the riddling
[2:47:15.540 --> 2:47:17.660]  drugs in the a d h d drug
[2:47:17.660 --> 2:47:21.300]  why are our children being drug with amphetamines
[2:47:21.300 --> 2:47:24.220]  i used to be called speed when it was sold on the street
[2:47:24.220 --> 2:47:27.400]  now it's being given to children who sit inside school that have signs on the
[2:47:27.400 --> 2:47:31.080]  outside that say this is a drug-free zone are you kidding me
[2:47:31.080 --> 2:47:34.000]  it's more drug in the school than there and there's more drugs in the in the
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:35.120]  nurse's office
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:39.120]  and in the school's prescription style then there is any marijuana or
[2:47:39.120 --> 2:47:41.720]  possibly cocaine or ecstasy or any of that
[2:47:41.720 --> 2:47:42.600]  yeah
[2:47:42.600 --> 2:47:44.800]  yeah for sure and i could do this
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:46.300]  i'm sure you agree with it
[2:47:46.300 --> 2:47:48.960]  this is really a crime against our children
[2:47:48.960 --> 2:47:53.120]  they don't need more drug they don't need mind-altering chemicals right
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:57.440]  but it is probably better education better parenting more time with their
[2:47:57.440 --> 2:47:58.480]  parents
[2:47:58.480 --> 2:47:59.720]  they need to be taught
[2:47:59.720 --> 2:48:02.220]  in a holistic way in a caring way
[2:48:02.220 --> 2:48:06.040]  not to be drug and told sit down shut up do your lessons pay your taxes when you
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:06.800]  get old
[2:48:06.800 --> 2:48:09.280]  you know be an american no that's not what it's about
[2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:11.040]  we need to show them something different
[2:48:11.040 --> 2:48:13.840]  how to be an american that has freedom that has choices
[2:48:13.840 --> 2:48:17.840]  that educated and knows their options and know how to take care of themselves
[2:48:17.840 --> 2:48:20.000]  that's what a true american is supposed to be
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:24.040]  well i like it to the combo pack of both brave new world and uh... nineteen
[2:48:24.040 --> 2:48:24.920]  eighty four
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:27.080]  nineteen eighty four really shows the uh...
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:30.200]  the surveillance society which is definitely coming into play i did a
[2:48:30.200 --> 2:48:32.160]  uh... report today about how uh...
[2:48:32.160 --> 2:48:36.000]  i'd be em is now working with uh... lockheed martin for the next level
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:39.960]  of biometric identification including palm prints facial recognition all that
[2:48:39.960 --> 2:48:40.640]  good stuff
[2:48:40.640 --> 2:48:42.660]  but on the brave new world and
[2:48:42.660 --> 2:48:44.600]  it's tough fetus crap
[2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:46.120]  you know basically poison
[2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:49.720]  and then to give us all these drugs that are mind-altering
[2:48:49.720 --> 2:48:51.320]  make us more passive
[2:48:51.320 --> 2:48:52.780]  make us more mindless
[2:48:52.780 --> 2:48:55.000]  uh... make us more inactive really
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:56.440]  yeah you're exactly right
[2:48:56.440 --> 2:48:59.960]  it isn't interesting how all these pharmaceuticals
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:03.120]  at the same time that they're making money for the drug companies
[2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:04.200]  they also tend to
[2:49:04.200 --> 2:49:08.600]  staff the cognitive function of the population so that people can't really
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:10.560]  think for themselves anymore
[2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:14.120]  it means that they're not able to challenge the status quo not able to
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:17.480]  rock the boat they can't even vote clearly anymore i mean
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:18.360]  how you know
[2:49:18.360 --> 2:49:22.520]  what the future of a democracy when the population is so drugged out that they
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:25.520]  can't even vote rationally anymore
[2:49:25.520 --> 2:49:26.480]  you're in trouble
[2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:28.440]  i'm with you there and uh...
[2:49:28.440 --> 2:49:32.080]  you know it also ties into me the fluoride in the water i mean
[2:49:32.080 --> 2:49:35.720]  people you people need to get hip to the fact the first time fluoride was added
[2:49:35.720 --> 2:49:40.320]  to water it was the nazi concentration camps to make the populations there
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:40.960]  more
[2:49:40.960 --> 2:49:42.000]  docile
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  now you can go anywhere without fluoride being added to the water and they
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:47.960]  want to increase the amounts
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:50.320]  yes it's just one more chemical
[2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:53.360]  that does have that effect and they know if they can keep the population
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:55.080]  about how you know
[2:49:55.080 --> 2:49:58.320]  don't question anything pay your taxes do your work
[2:49:58.320 --> 2:50:01.840]  by your consumer goods keep giving yourself cancer and make sure your

[2:54:49.280 --> 2:54:52.040]  scott in colorado scottie with us
[2:54:52.040 --> 2:54:55.600]  i'm with you jason it's good to talk to you with a great show thank you man

[2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:01.800]  that mclam and
[2:55:01.800 --> 2:55:04.760]  great show anyway i want to make a couple of points
[2:55:04.760 --> 2:55:08.320]  number one because we're talking about pharmaceutical uh... industry i would
[2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:10.280]  in that industry for a while
[2:55:10.280 --> 2:55:13.560]  uh... went from there to medical equipment but
[2:55:13.560 --> 2:55:16.280]  uh... you getting to the uh...
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:21.160]  information office i i sold out anti-neoplastic uh... drugs
[2:55:21.160 --> 2:55:22.400]  for cancer
[2:55:22.400 --> 2:55:24.600]  and what doctors can do with
[2:55:24.600 --> 2:55:26.240]  far as what the FDA
[2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:30.920]  if you make indications are approved indications for drugs and especially
[2:55:30.920 --> 2:55:32.440]  for cancer drugs
[2:55:32.440 --> 2:55:35.520]  and the cancer doctors really have a lot more latitude than than the other
[2:55:35.520 --> 2:55:37.880]  positions what they can do but they can
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:38.880]  they can use
[2:55:38.880 --> 2:55:42.880]  any of the approved cancer drugs on anything that they want to take a try
[2:55:42.880 --> 2:55:44.680]  thing they want to try
[2:55:44.680 --> 2:55:48.560]  however up a pharmaceutical representative cannot
[2:55:48.560 --> 2:55:53.080]  go in and initiate that conversation it has to be brought up by the position
[2:55:53.080 --> 2:55:54.240]  by the position
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:55:57.600]  now we would have the clandestine meetings where we would go in
[2:55:57.600 --> 2:55:59.680]  because once you have
[2:55:59.680 --> 2:56:02.920]  the population already for a specific drug
[2:56:02.920 --> 2:56:05.920]  you've got to create a new indication for it and try to get approved by the
[2:56:05.920 --> 2:56:08.960]  FDA but even though you can't get it approved not approved
[2:56:08.960 --> 2:56:11.320]  you try to engage the position in
[2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:12.560]  discussing it
[2:56:12.560 --> 2:56:15.920]  using it off-label or off-indication
[2:56:15.920 --> 2:56:20.040]  so the pharmaceutical companies encourage their people to do that however
[2:56:20.040 --> 2:56:21.140]  if one doctor
[2:56:21.140 --> 2:56:23.960]  uh... want to all they do is call one eight hundred
[2:56:23.960 --> 2:56:24.800]  uh...
[2:56:24.800 --> 2:56:29.560]  uh... call at the a in reporter and it's a ten thousand dollar fine
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:32.920]  pharmaceutical rep now i left that industry because i told them
[2:56:32.920 --> 2:56:36.560]  but i was not going to go in and promote it that way
[2:56:36.560 --> 2:56:38.440]  that uh...
[2:56:38.440 --> 2:56:42.000]  i could no longer do it because i didn't want to get that fine but they
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:43.160]  they do push
[2:56:43.160 --> 2:56:46.800]  pharmaceutical rep to do things that they are not supposed to do
[2:56:46.800 --> 2:56:48.200]  and they do it
[2:56:48.200 --> 2:56:51.720]  of course they do and then it's only a slap on the wrist when they actually do
[2:56:51.720 --> 2:56:54.520]  get caught ten thousand dollar fine that's that's almost nothing to these
[2:56:54.520 --> 2:56:56.380]  pharmaceutical companies don't know the rep
[2:56:56.380 --> 2:56:59.400]  all the rep is the one that actually has a pocket also they defer
[2:56:59.400 --> 2:57:01.720]  any kind of uh...
[2:57:01.720 --> 2:57:04.320]  any kind of negativity towards you and you have to pay the fine
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:07.200]  exactly and that's why you have a plan that meetings where you talk about
[2:57:07.200 --> 2:57:08.480]  promoting off
[2:57:08.480 --> 2:57:11.320]  label and how you're going to do it
[2:57:11.320 --> 2:57:15.400]  and and and then you you walk up to the period say you know i i really can't do
[2:57:15.400 --> 2:57:16.240]  that
[2:57:16.240 --> 2:57:20.080]  when it's unethically and i think it gets a lot of ten thousand dollars out of
[2:57:20.080 --> 2:57:21.280]  my pocket well
[2:57:21.280 --> 2:57:23.800]  they don't want you around if you don't want to follow
[2:57:23.800 --> 2:57:25.560]  you know they're uh...
[2:57:25.560 --> 2:57:28.960]  they're set protocol for for getting new indications for a product
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:30.840]  that you have to get back
[2:57:30.840 --> 2:57:33.680]  all right so i think you so much for the calm and i got a jump to the next

[3:03:34.680 --> 3:03:37.800]  we did a pretty good job of doing that i think because there's a whole lot of
[3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:41.240]  networking going on there about people talking about peace
[3:03:41.240 --> 3:03:45.240]  and then i wrote this song with my daughter amy called a

[3:08:11.160 --> 3:08:14.520]  willy nelson again thank you for being with us i wanted to throw out that
[3:08:14.520 --> 3:08:18.520]  question i mean about your life growing up what
[3:08:18.520 --> 3:08:22.840]  what made you the way you are uh why you've always stood up for the little
[3:08:22.840 --> 3:08:26.280]  guy the farmers and people in africa and
[3:08:26.280 --> 3:08:32.840]  just so many others why why why did you go in that direction in your life
[3:08:32.840 --> 3:08:36.760]  well you know i don't really know except the fact that i was uh
[3:08:36.760 --> 3:08:40.120]  i grew up in a town in abit texas was a little small
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:43.880]  community farm town and i knew everybody in town
[3:08:43.880 --> 3:08:47.720]  everybody knew me at three or four churches there four churches so
[3:08:47.720 --> 3:08:52.200]  in one way or another you went to church every day and every night of your life
[3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:57.560]  and uh... how you learn if i learned anything i learned that all those
[3:08:57.560 --> 3:09:00.840]  places uh... you know sometimes the baptist wouldn't
[3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:04.040]  talk to the method is so that you know church of christ wouldn't
[3:09:04.040 --> 3:09:08.600]  talk to the catholic but they were all trying to do the same thing and they
[3:09:08.600 --> 3:09:13.000]  were just a division even in that small town
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:16.680]  but the one thing that i did learn now that it was the golden rule you do
[3:09:16.680 --> 3:09:19.880]  under others as you would have them do unto you and that's
[3:09:19.880 --> 3:09:23.160]  uh... maybe that in amazing grace i pulled out a habit
[3:09:23.160 --> 3:09:27.240]  texas and uh... i think those two things alone have been
[3:09:27.240 --> 3:09:31.960]  really good for me when did you start your first band
[3:09:31.960 --> 3:09:38.840]  i was about ten uh... let's see what i before i got out of high school i
[3:09:38.840 --> 3:09:43.480]  started a band with me and my sister and my brother-in-law and my football coach
[3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:47.560]  and uh... he played drum ball and we had a little family band
[3:09:47.560 --> 3:09:51.960]  we played all over texas we played in uh... waco
[3:09:51.960 --> 3:09:55.560]  and west and then you know places that we could
[3:09:55.560 --> 3:10:01.080]  drive to with a trailer didn't you start out in radio by
[3:10:01.080 --> 3:10:04.280]  sixteen or seventeen you already had your own show
[3:10:04.280 --> 3:10:07.800]  i yeah i was with khbr in hilt borough and uh...
[3:10:07.800 --> 3:10:11.400]  we had our own radio show there ever saturday and
[3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:15.480]  and then after that i went to the air force and then went down to
[3:10:15.480 --> 3:10:21.000]  pleasant in texas and went to work at k o b pleasant down there and i worked
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:25.880]  several other radio stations and at the same time playing bars around trying
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:28.760]  to make it it's amazing well you certainly
[3:10:28.760 --> 3:10:31.960]  did make it a long career you've been you've been out
[3:10:31.960 --> 3:10:36.200]  what uh... on the road and and and and playing since what fifty four fifty five
[3:10:36.200 --> 3:10:39.720]  earlier yeah i read at least that uh...
[3:10:39.720 --> 3:10:43.080]  uh... forty nine uh... when i got away from high school
[3:10:43.080 --> 3:10:46.840]  wow thirty in a band then so forty nine
[3:10:46.840 --> 3:10:53.160]  uh... shifting gears again we're talking to willie nelson
[3:10:53.160 --> 3:10:56.760]  willie the war i mean you've been speaking out
[3:10:56.760 --> 3:10:59.640]  against it from the very start and if you did that at the beginning
[3:10:59.640 --> 3:11:03.160]  the media the the corporate media tried to punish people they punish the dixie
[3:11:03.160 --> 3:11:06.760]  chicks but they kind of shied away from attacking you too much
[3:11:06.760 --> 3:11:10.680]  they tried to make an example out of them but i remember hearing you on the
[3:11:10.680 --> 3:11:14.040]  radio just saying hey uh... you know i don't care
[3:11:14.040 --> 3:11:17.720]  you know what they do or uh... i don't want to paraphrase what did you do at the
[3:11:17.720 --> 3:11:20.360]  time
[3:11:20.360 --> 3:11:22.680]  well
[3:11:22.680 --> 3:11:27.560]  first of all it all happened uh... one uh... the district dixie chicks uh...
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:32.920]  was overseas when they uh... uh... said what they said that seemed to have upset
[3:11:32.920 --> 3:11:36.600]  everybody i was overseas to the press conference and
[3:11:36.600 --> 3:11:40.200]  uh... and uh... a lot of i guess uh... they had it for the padded in for the
[3:11:40.200 --> 3:11:43.320]  dixie chicks more than they did me i don't know because
[3:11:43.320 --> 3:11:46.680]  for they had every reason the world get on me also they're afraid of you they
[3:11:46.680 --> 3:11:50.040]  knew it wouldn't fly well i don't know what they said you know what about this
[3:11:50.040 --> 3:11:53.880]  crazy cowboy from texas you got running across the first of all you know a
[3:11:53.880 --> 3:11:59.240]  cowboy second of all you need from texas so uh... you know let's start there
[3:11:59.240 --> 3:12:05.800]  ha ha ha and uh... i mean i make the point that they backed off
[3:12:05.800 --> 3:12:08.520]  from you because i don't think that they could uh...
[3:12:08.520 --> 3:12:11.480]  chew up willy nelson i think they tried to pick on the dixie chicks but it seemed
[3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:13.480]  that that backfired on them
[3:12:13.480 --> 3:12:17.640]  well he did and it took a while and the chicks had to go through some uncomfortable
[3:12:17.640 --> 3:12:20.040]  times but you know they're tough and uh...
[3:12:20.040 --> 3:12:24.600]  and uh... they came out on the other side of it really looking great and uh...
[3:12:24.600 --> 3:12:27.800]  and they're more popular now than they were then and
[3:12:27.800 --> 3:12:31.640]  a lot of it's because of that so uh... you know i don't know what they'd rather
[3:12:31.640 --> 3:12:35.480]  have done that way or not but at least they said uh... what they thought and
[3:12:35.480 --> 3:12:38.600]  they stuck with it and i think their last record was it would you know we're
[3:12:38.600 --> 3:12:43.240]  not ready to make nice yet not ready to play nice not ready to go along with
[3:12:43.240 --> 3:12:47.400]  this i'm mad as hell and i'm just going to continue doing the right thing
[3:12:47.400 --> 3:12:52.360]  and and that's why they're becoming uh... even bigger icons uh... willy
[3:12:52.360 --> 3:12:55.560]  uh... your take on the war i mean you were there from day one saying it was bad
[3:12:55.560 --> 3:13:00.920]  now eighty percent of americans uh... are saying it's a bad idea we know we
[3:13:00.920 --> 3:13:05.720]  relied to about the w md's we know with the white house and downing street memo
[3:13:05.720 --> 3:13:09.400]  uh... that bush tried to manufacture getting some of our aircraft shot down
[3:13:09.400 --> 3:13:13.720]  with blare to start the war uh... where's willy nelson now
[3:13:13.720 --> 3:13:19.400]  uh... five years into this war uh... and uh...
[3:13:19.400 --> 3:13:24.360]  thousands and thousands of dead americans hundreds of thousands of dead iraqis
[3:13:24.360 --> 3:13:28.040]  i mean you've been vindicated yet again
[3:13:28.040 --> 3:13:34.600]  well it was always a bad idea you just don't start wars and uh... again it
[3:13:34.600 --> 3:13:38.920]  goes back to my uh... whatever i learned in ava texas uh...
[3:13:38.920 --> 3:13:43.000]  uh... you just don't kill people there's something in the bible that says they
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:47.000]  shall not kill and uh... and it's also a lot of things in there about
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:49.320]  peace on earth and that's why i think i grew up
[3:13:49.320 --> 3:13:52.920]  believing that way and then all of a sudden i found out there are huge
[3:13:52.920 --> 3:13:55.880]  organizations out there that are starting wars
[3:13:55.880 --> 3:13:59.560]  and selling bullets to both sides and i said what the hell is going on
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:03.960]  what happened to peace on earth well you brought up a key there can you
[3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:08.120]  elaborate on your take on uh... big organizations selling to both sides
[3:14:08.120 --> 3:14:11.800]  because that's the key here the humanity the humans the children
[3:14:11.800 --> 3:14:14.760]  the people that die that have their countries bombed out the americans that
[3:14:14.760 --> 3:14:18.120]  are taxed to pay for it all in the no bid contracts
[3:14:18.120 --> 3:14:22.600]  uh... humanity loses but these kingpins they win
[3:14:22.600 --> 3:14:27.640]  yeah and they've been winning ever since uh... you know uh...
[3:14:27.640 --> 3:14:31.800]  in the orchestra when they talk about war there always be wars and rumors of
[3:14:31.800 --> 3:14:35.160]  wars but in the new one it says let's talk about peace and then there was
[3:14:35.160 --> 3:14:38.760]  there there's going to be some peace and i believe that there's
[3:14:38.760 --> 3:14:42.680]  eventually there's going to be peace on earth and it's those other bastards
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:47.880]  that are getting in the way of it so what do we do about them alec
[3:14:47.880 --> 3:14:51.880]  well i have to say this i do interviews every day on other people's talk shows
[3:14:51.880 --> 3:14:56.200]  even uh... confrontational interviews adversarial interviews and they'll take
[3:14:56.200 --> 3:15:00.600]  ten twenty calls and a twenty calls nineteen people agree with me while the
[3:15:00.600 --> 3:15:04.600]  neocon uh... or right wing host is attacking me
[3:15:04.600 --> 3:15:07.480]  because i come from you know to it from a libertarian perspective and it just
[3:15:07.480 --> 3:15:11.800]  neutralizes them now five six years ago that wasn't happening was half and half
[3:15:11.800 --> 3:15:15.480]  and i i'm seeing a total shift personally
[3:15:15.480 --> 3:15:19.000]  but also in the polls but now both parties have circled the wagons against
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:21.160]  the people and they're saying we don't care what you want
[3:15:21.160 --> 3:15:24.280]  john mccain said this war is going to go on for a hundred years
[3:15:24.280 --> 3:15:27.880]  yeah yeah and uh...
[3:15:27.880 --> 3:15:33.400]  it can't but just can't we can't let it go on
[3:15:33.400 --> 3:15:37.160]  uh... another year i mean it has to uh...
[3:15:37.160 --> 3:15:39.560]  the other day i was getting interviewed somebody said what would you do if you
[3:15:39.560 --> 3:15:41.880]  were elected president i thought i would stop
[3:15:41.880 --> 3:15:46.840]  the damn war and uh... it's just that simple you stop that war you stop the
[3:15:46.840 --> 3:15:49.320]  other wars that were in around the country
[3:15:49.320 --> 3:15:53.400]  and you go around the country being a peacemaker and stop in wars i thought
[3:15:53.400 --> 3:15:57.640]  that's what you're supposed to do since when does america invade all these
[3:15:57.640 --> 3:16:00.280]  countries that have nothing to do with nine eleven
[3:16:00.280 --> 3:16:03.640]  yeah really and uh... and all of a sudden
[3:16:03.640 --> 3:16:06.760]  you know the way i heard it there's fifteen people from uh...
[3:16:06.760 --> 3:16:10.920]  Saudi Arabia hit us in new york and we go jump on afghanistan
[3:16:10.920 --> 3:16:15.080]  uh... i never could figure that one out in iraq well i did figure it out too but
[3:16:15.080 --> 3:16:17.960]  uh... i'm surprised more people haven't figured it out
[3:16:17.960 --> 3:16:21.720]  uh... will you brought it up you figured it out what what's your take on nine
[3:16:21.720 --> 3:16:24.440]  eleven just came out in a p today that the
[3:16:24.440 --> 3:16:28.040]  white house is running the commission we always knew that but now they admit
[3:16:28.040 --> 3:16:31.400]  but i have the headline right here i read it before you came on
[3:16:31.400 --> 3:16:36.760]  uh... where they're now admitting that it was a staged uh... staged commission
[3:16:36.760 --> 3:16:41.960]  well that ain't good news but it's not it doesn't surprise me did it you
[3:16:41.960 --> 3:16:45.480]  know it didn't i'm glad it's coming out uh... what's your take on nine eleven
[3:16:45.480 --> 3:16:50.200]  do you do you question the official story i certainly do and uh... i saw those
[3:16:50.200 --> 3:16:54.120]  towers fall and i've seen uh... an implosion in los vegas
[3:16:54.120 --> 3:16:57.160]  uh... there was too much similarities between the two
[3:16:57.160 --> 3:17:01.080]  and i saw the building fall that didn't get hit by nothing so
[3:17:01.080 --> 3:17:04.200]  you know how naive are we are you know water
[3:17:04.200 --> 3:17:08.600]  what do they think we'll go for so you are you saying you started
[3:17:08.600 --> 3:17:11.880]  having questions or a little voice in your head uh...
[3:17:11.880 --> 3:17:15.080]  i mean did you have a bad feeling the day it happened is that what you're saying
[3:17:15.080 --> 3:17:19.080]  the day it happened i saw one fall and it was just so symmetrical
[3:17:19.080 --> 3:17:21.960]  i said wait a minute i just saw that last week at the
[3:17:21.960 --> 3:17:27.800]  you know a casino over in los vegas and you see these implosions all the time
[3:17:27.800 --> 3:17:30.520]  and the next one fell and said oh there's another one
[3:17:30.520 --> 3:17:33.640]  and they're trying to tell me that an airplane did it and that's you know i
[3:17:33.640 --> 3:17:37.320]  can't go along with it and then you find out that mainstream news reported but
[3:17:37.320 --> 3:17:40.680]  it never got any attention that the supposed hijackers were given national
[3:17:40.680 --> 3:17:42.600]  security clearance and were trained at
[3:17:42.600 --> 3:17:45.880]  u.s bases and the dean of the defense language school colonel butler goes
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:49.720]  public and says we train these people the government's involved and they start
[3:17:49.720 --> 3:17:53.240]  court marshaling till he agreed to shut up
[3:17:53.240 --> 3:17:58.040]  true story i guess i hate to hear it but it's probably true
[3:17:58.040 --> 3:18:01.240]  uh... you've had a chance to see what terror storm in game some of the other
[3:18:01.240 --> 3:18:04.440]  films what's uh... willy elson's take on those films
[3:18:04.440 --> 3:18:07.720]  oh i think they're right on i think uh... you know the uh...
[3:18:07.720 --> 3:18:11.720]  the fact that there are a few elite that are running everything calling the
[3:18:11.720 --> 3:18:14.600]  shots start in the war's financing them all
[3:18:14.600 --> 3:18:20.680]  uh... i believe that and uh... what else we're doing uh... who knows but uh...
[3:18:20.680 --> 3:18:27.080]  that one thing alone is enough to for us to think about how do we stop them
[3:18:27.080 --> 3:18:30.920]  well the proof is in the pudding if you've got on every issue seventy five to
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:31.880]  eighty five
[3:18:31.880 --> 3:18:34.840]  in all the major scientific polls of the people are against everything this
[3:18:34.840 --> 3:18:35.800]  government's doing
[3:18:35.800 --> 3:18:39.240]  we send the democrats to congress in the war they increase it
[3:18:39.240 --> 3:18:41.800]  uh... and now they're saying they're gonna be there a hundred years hillary
[3:18:41.800 --> 3:18:42.760]  and mccain
[3:18:42.760 --> 3:18:45.720]  i mean that to me that is a small group running things right there in front of
[3:18:45.720 --> 3:18:46.600]  us
[3:18:46.600 --> 3:18:51.320]  absolutely and uh... force i can see all those people attended the same meetings
[3:18:51.320 --> 3:18:54.320]  that you and the guy that ended up in canada am i wrong
[3:18:54.320 --> 3:18:57.840]  i don't know that a lot of them do go to the billard bar group yes sir
[3:18:57.840 --> 3:18:59.600]  is that freedom
[3:18:59.600 --> 3:19:01.360]  i don't think so
[3:19:01.360 --> 3:19:05.240]  but not democracy either
[3:19:05.240 --> 3:19:08.160]  willy nelson you're going to go away here uh...
[3:19:08.160 --> 3:19:12.040]  when we get back i want to talk about solutions your ideas
[3:19:12.040 --> 3:19:15.040]  because the people are a way to a certain extent i just don't think that they
[3:19:15.040 --> 3:19:15.600]  have
[3:19:15.600 --> 3:19:17.800]  the specifics of what to do and i don't know about
[3:19:17.800 --> 3:19:20.040]  some of your organizations and groups and
[3:19:20.040 --> 3:19:22.480]  i agree with uh... taking
[3:19:22.480 --> 3:19:25.320]  our everyday life in our own hands like you've done
[3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:26.880]  with the biodiesel that's a
[3:19:26.880 --> 3:19:30.080]  separate thing from what they're doing with the corn and other things and
[3:19:30.080 --> 3:19:33.080]  i want to be sure and separate that out and explain that to people know what
[3:19:33.080 --> 3:19:34.180]  you've tried to do it
[3:19:34.180 --> 3:19:35.640]  all the money you put into
[3:19:35.640 --> 3:19:38.360]  uh... trying to get us into renewable resources
[3:19:38.360 --> 3:19:41.320]  and uh... things that are actually uh...
[3:19:41.320 --> 3:19:44.320]  you will allow us to not continue to destroy the earth
[3:19:44.320 --> 3:19:45.160]  we'll be right back
[3:19:45.160 --> 3:19:47.880]  all fact we're not going to go to break i forgot i told him to skip that break
[3:19:47.880 --> 3:19:50.920]  i'm so so used to going to break the twenty after not told john to
[3:19:50.920 --> 3:19:52.800]  skip that so we've got more time here
[3:19:52.800 --> 3:19:54.000]  uh...
[3:19:54.000 --> 3:19:55.120]  a little bit said
[3:19:55.120 --> 3:19:58.960]  uh... dumbstruck here talking to you willy
[3:19:58.960 --> 3:20:00.580]  solutions i mean you
[3:20:00.580 --> 3:20:03.120]  you talk about how we had to have this elite running things in the evidence
[3:20:03.120 --> 3:20:05.520]  shows that the documents have been declassified
[3:20:05.520 --> 3:20:12.320]  what are your ideas to get the people to mobilize to do something about it
[3:20:12.320 --> 3:20:18.880]  the problem i wrote call peaceful solution is uh... now they uh...
[3:20:18.880 --> 3:20:23.120]  all those people that recorded believe and so do i that there is a peaceful
[3:20:23.120 --> 3:20:24.280]  solution
[3:20:24.280 --> 3:20:29.080]  and uh... it's called a peace revolution we just take back america
[3:20:29.080 --> 3:20:30.400]  and we do it
[3:20:30.400 --> 3:20:33.800]  voted back we do it that we make sure that uh...
[3:20:33.800 --> 3:20:37.840]  crooked ballot boxes are thrown away we get a paper trail and everything and
[3:20:37.840 --> 3:20:39.280]  make sure that
[3:20:39.280 --> 3:20:42.840]  good honest people can get back in control and that's the only way we're
[3:20:42.840 --> 3:20:44.160]  going to do it is to just
[3:20:44.160 --> 3:20:46.880]  do it you know what i mean
[3:20:46.880 --> 3:20:49.160]  well i think that's happening uh...
[3:20:49.160 --> 3:20:52.760]  just in the news today we're seeing that they've recruited twenty six thousand
[3:20:52.760 --> 3:20:54.960]  preachers the white house has through fema
[3:20:54.960 --> 3:20:56.560]  to tell their flocks to
[3:20:56.560 --> 3:20:59.880]  stand down to turn in their guns to follow orders
[3:20:59.880 --> 3:21:03.760]  to do with the president says in the presidential decision director fifty one
[3:21:03.760 --> 3:21:05.800]  bush says he's above the congress
[3:21:05.800 --> 3:21:08.680]  it's no longer involved in continuity of government in the john warner defense
[3:21:08.680 --> 3:21:10.080]  authorization act
[3:21:10.080 --> 3:21:13.280]  uh... they have openly funded for insurrection and rebellion
[3:21:13.280 --> 3:21:15.000]  by the american people
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:18.160]  the the whole police state apparatus they built up after
[3:21:18.160 --> 3:21:20.480]  nine eleven and i want to get your take on this willy
[3:21:20.480 --> 3:21:21.880]  i know you're aware of it
[3:21:21.880 --> 3:21:24.360]  uh... is now being used against the people
[3:21:24.360 --> 3:21:27.880]  they're not even talking about the boogeyman of l c i a i mean al qaeda
[3:21:27.880 --> 3:21:29.520]  anymore
[3:21:29.520 --> 3:21:35.040]  no and uh... i do believe that uh... it's a long time till election day in some
[3:21:35.040 --> 3:21:38.080]  sort of national crisis could put off the elections
[3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:43.480]  and we could have george in there ten years longer
[3:21:43.480 --> 3:21:48.000]  a lot of people are saying that i was saying that many years ago and now
[3:21:48.000 --> 3:21:51.400]  bob woodward's talked about other setting up for martial law
[3:21:51.400 --> 3:21:54.920]  of all people uh... and they'll be wolf is talking about it
[3:21:54.920 --> 3:21:58.840]  i think that might save us and i'm seeing a
[3:21:58.840 --> 3:22:02.280]  lot at the end of the tunnel but i think you're right i think that's a great
[3:22:02.280 --> 3:22:03.080]  danger
[3:22:03.080 --> 3:22:06.360]  if that did happen a nuke went off a biological weapon
[3:22:06.360 --> 3:22:10.160]  was released a terrorist supposedly blow up a bunch of other buildings
[3:22:10.160 --> 3:22:13.000]  uh... what do you think the response of the population should be of the
[3:22:13.000 --> 3:22:16.640]  announced one of this new emergency or it could be an economic emergency in
[3:22:16.640 --> 3:22:20.200]  bush is going to have to stay on the status
[3:22:20.200 --> 3:22:21.360]  well
[3:22:21.360 --> 3:22:24.960]  i would hope that uh... that would be we'd be smarter than that and i would
[3:22:24.960 --> 3:22:28.480]  hope that was to know what you know we're throwing all you guys out and we're
[3:22:28.480 --> 3:22:29.880]  starting over
[3:22:29.880 --> 3:22:33.200]  uh... you know you can stop the elections if you want to but you can stop
[3:22:33.200 --> 3:22:36.800]  the people
[3:22:36.800 --> 3:22:39.320]  well ron paul has gotten more
[3:22:39.320 --> 3:22:41.280]  donations from
[3:22:41.280 --> 3:22:45.800]  troops and and people in iraq and all republicans combined
[3:22:45.800 --> 3:22:49.680]  uh... the troops in polls seventy five percent are against the war so
[3:22:49.680 --> 3:22:52.040]  the bush is planning on using these troops here it looks like he's gonna
[3:22:52.040 --> 3:22:53.960]  have a problem
[3:22:53.960 --> 3:22:57.760]  well again the troops are under orders and if they don't know what they
[3:22:57.760 --> 3:23:02.280]  you know or the orders are that they get shot so uh... that the troops have no
[3:23:02.280 --> 3:23:03.080]  choice
[3:23:03.080 --> 3:23:06.160]  there's a few of them in there that are there because they
[3:23:06.160 --> 3:23:09.120]  think it's the right thing to do there if you there because they just like to
[3:23:09.120 --> 3:23:10.000]  fight
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:12.920]  uh... but there's a lot of them they're like you say that would rather be home
[3:23:12.920 --> 3:23:14.280]  with their families and
[3:23:14.280 --> 3:23:17.560]  but save our good men and women for something that
[3:23:17.560 --> 3:23:21.280]  really matters for really something that is the defense of our country
[3:23:21.280 --> 3:23:24.240]  if we need some people down here on the borders let's take a hundred fifty
[3:23:24.240 --> 3:23:27.760]  thousand people out of iraq and put them on the borders canada in mexico
[3:23:27.760 --> 3:23:30.640]  we can secure our borders that way
[3:23:30.640 --> 3:23:34.160]  well how are we have this war on terror where there's an al-qaeda terrace under
[3:23:34.160 --> 3:23:36.080]  every bed under every table
[3:23:36.080 --> 3:23:39.120]  we gotta have checkpoints and and and kids get in thumb scan to get their
[3:23:39.120 --> 3:23:41.120]  lunches to stop al-qaeda
[3:23:41.120 --> 3:23:44.160]  but then the borders wide open that kind of make
[3:23:44.160 --> 3:23:45.280]  a fraud
[3:23:45.280 --> 3:23:48.160]  well yeah and uh... you know they're fighting over there because you've ever
[3:23:48.160 --> 3:23:51.240]  really old joke about the guy that dropped a quarter and he was looking around
[3:23:51.240 --> 3:23:54.680]  and I said where did you lose it? I said I lost it over yonder and he said
[3:23:54.680 --> 3:23:57.520]  why are you looking over here for it? I said what call the lights better
[3:23:57.520 --> 3:24:01.000]  hahahaha
[3:24:01.000 --> 3:24:04.840]  I think that's why they're over there, the lights better
[3:24:04.840 --> 3:24:07.080]  well it's a it's a black hole
[3:24:07.080 --> 3:24:12.240]  to launder money and dump trillions of dollars in no bid contracts to hallowbert
[3:24:12.240 --> 3:24:12.960]  yeah
[3:24:12.960 --> 3:24:16.120]  and uh... there's nobody stopping it
[3:24:16.120 --> 3:24:20.160]  and as long as it keeps going on and nobody stops it uh... I don't know what
[3:24:20.160 --> 3:24:25.680]  the end result will be but uh... well tyrants can be good, it can be good for us
[3:24:25.680 --> 3:24:29.240]  tyrant, well you're right, tyrants have known throughout history, they keep pushing
[3:24:29.240 --> 3:24:31.960]  they keep testing, tyranny doesn't come overnight
[3:24:31.960 --> 3:24:34.840]  and I hope a lot of people that support this war, I hope you know we have illegal
[3:24:34.840 --> 3:24:36.320]  wars not declared
[3:24:36.320 --> 3:24:38.520]  torture the rest of it
[3:24:38.520 --> 3:24:42.480]  none of us are safe here, what comes around goes around, you reap what you sow, don't you Willie?
[3:24:42.480 --> 3:24:46.680]  absolutely, ten times over I remember
[3:24:46.680 --> 3:24:51.840]  and I'm not sure I want to get treated ten times as bad as we're treating other people
[3:24:51.840 --> 3:24:56.600]  did you ever see the actual army reports MSNBC posted it but then never covered it
[3:24:56.600 --> 3:25:00.600]  with what the actual torture was not just those photos
[3:25:00.600 --> 3:25:05.080]  uh... I mean they reported they tortured people's children in front of their parents
[3:25:05.080 --> 3:25:07.000]  no I didn't hear that
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:09.720]  did you uh... see the report about them raping the women
[3:25:09.720 --> 3:25:11.280]  inside the camps
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:16.800]  well that one done surprisingly but torturing them in front of their family I didn't know
[3:25:16.800 --> 3:25:17.760]  we did that
[3:25:17.760 --> 3:25:20.360]  yeah, if you want I can email you some of the mainstream
[3:25:20.360 --> 3:25:21.640]  stories
[3:25:21.640 --> 3:25:25.920]  uh... they had a CIA section chief in the Washington Post say yeah we uh...
[3:25:25.920 --> 3:25:30.640]  we torture their children in front of the parents to get answers
[3:25:30.640 --> 3:25:32.680]  well
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:35.200]  I don't understand it
[3:25:35.200 --> 3:25:38.640]  I think the establishment is trying to seduce our troops
[3:25:38.640 --> 3:25:40.240]  into evil but I
[3:25:40.240 --> 3:25:41.880]  again I think they're
[3:25:41.880 --> 3:25:44.480]  thrown it back up at them
[3:25:44.480 --> 3:25:48.600]  well I think so you just bet this can't happen because everyone is an individual
[3:25:48.600 --> 3:25:53.000]  we all have our free will and God give us uh... you know the freedom to uh...
[3:25:53.000 --> 3:25:54.960]  uh... to use it so uh...
[3:25:54.960 --> 3:25:58.200]  no matter where we are what we're doing if we know it's wrong
[3:25:58.200 --> 3:26:00.960]  we should not do it
[3:26:00.960 --> 3:26:04.600]  well for anybody that wants to report it was a Filipino-American general two-star
[3:26:04.600 --> 3:26:07.040]  general to goomba
[3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:10.840]  was hired to run the report on thirty plus camps in iraq
[3:26:10.840 --> 3:26:13.440]  and uh... that was the findings for anybody that wants to go check that
[3:26:13.440 --> 3:26:15.400]  though those are amazing claims but they
[3:26:15.400 --> 3:26:16.560]  they are true
[3:26:16.560 --> 3:26:18.920]  uh...
[3:26:18.920 --> 3:26:23.560]  speaking of an individual like george bush and and these elitists that uh...
[3:26:23.560 --> 3:26:25.760]  are puppeteering him
[3:26:25.760 --> 3:26:29.200]  how do you think they sleep at night willy because some like you or myself you know
[3:26:29.200 --> 3:26:33.400]  we have a conscience and and i love my conscience it's my greatest possession
[3:26:33.400 --> 3:26:38.120]  uh... and i wonder about psychopaths sometimes how they just enjoy evil
[3:26:38.120 --> 3:26:39.280]  well you know
[3:26:39.280 --> 3:26:43.080]  i don't know where you grew up but i grew up with a lot of people who
[3:26:43.080 --> 3:26:46.320]  really are uh...
[3:26:46.320 --> 3:26:49.360]  that you have to doubt if they have a conscious
[3:26:49.360 --> 3:26:53.160]  and uh... i know they're all over the world so i'm not surprised that people
[3:26:53.160 --> 3:26:54.360]  you know can
[3:26:54.360 --> 3:26:58.720]  torture because uh... absolutely happen all my life and you know smaller
[3:26:58.720 --> 3:26:59.960]  degrees
[3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:04.360]  but uh... there are just some people who are that way they'd like to make the
[3:27:04.360 --> 3:27:05.400]  other person
[3:27:05.400 --> 3:27:07.720]  uncomfortable in whatever way they can
[3:27:07.720 --> 3:27:09.560]  it's a power trip isn't it
[3:27:09.560 --> 3:27:13.640]  yeah i think it is not money it's about power
[3:27:13.640 --> 3:27:18.280]  well uh... where i'm from my dad is from uh... two counties over to the east
[3:27:18.280 --> 3:27:21.200]  that's where our families been since eighteen twenty nine

[3:27:38.800 --> 3:27:42.080]  it is growing and i'm glad to see it we've got a lot of room down there you
[3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:46.920]  know so uh... if it gets too crowded in freggrichsburg will go further west
[3:27:46.920 --> 3:27:51.960]  but there's plenty of room out there so i'd tell people to come on down

[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:10.840]  it's just incredibly beautiful all over that state and i'm prejudice and i would
[3:28:10.840 --> 3:28:12.880]  be the first to admit it
[3:28:12.880 --> 3:28:16.320]  the presidential election uh... to send it just dropped out my audience and
[3:28:16.320 --> 3:28:19.400]  others help raise the money for the recount they did find evidence
[3:28:19.400 --> 3:28:22.720]  on the republican and democratic side of chicainry in new hampshire
[3:28:22.720 --> 3:28:24.800]  but the senators dropped out now
[3:28:24.800 --> 3:28:27.120]  uh... what do you think a ron paul
[3:28:27.120 --> 3:28:30.000]  i like ron paul but i think he's got the same trouble that
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:32.720]  dennis had uh... first of all
[3:28:32.720 --> 3:28:36.800]  you know there's not that much support uh... behind me is growing a little bit
[3:28:36.800 --> 3:28:38.200]  but
[3:28:38.200 --> 3:28:41.400]  uh... notices numbers and uh...
[3:28:41.400 --> 3:28:44.760]  come up and where was it made here in the last day or so that he got quite a
[3:28:44.760 --> 3:28:47.080]  good you know i like what he says
[3:28:47.080 --> 3:28:48.400]  uh...
[3:28:48.400 --> 3:28:52.360]  i'd still think when we get down to it is going to be mccain and either hillary
[3:28:52.360 --> 3:28:53.560]  or obama
[3:28:53.560 --> 3:28:56.960]  and they're all pro war
[3:28:56.960 --> 3:29:01.400]  it sounds like it i i was hoping that uh... hillary changed your mind i was
[3:29:01.400 --> 3:29:04.880]  hoping obama was all the way against the war
[3:29:04.880 --> 3:29:06.200]  uh...
[3:29:06.200 --> 3:29:10.080]  i don't know maybe public opinion can uh... keep their minds where they need

[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:33.680]  uh... i'm getting into the work
[3:33:33.680 --> 3:33:35.120]  getting into the war
[3:33:35.120 --> 3:33:38.560]  uh... and in the solution you're trying to fix this politically
[3:33:38.560 --> 3:33:42.960]  uh... magically ron paul's been getting half the votes the poll show he should
[3:33:42.960 --> 3:33:45.560]  get obama was getting fifteen more points or more
[3:33:45.560 --> 3:33:49.000]  and hillary in new hampshire she magically won by almost four points
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:51.800]  that's like a eighteen point swing that's never happened before
[3:33:51.800 --> 3:33:54.480]  ron paul really got second place in
[3:33:54.480 --> 3:33:57.560]  nevada the media just said he didn't even make place
[3:33:57.560 --> 3:34:01.480]  uh... he won first place in louisiana they lied and said he got second place
[3:34:01.480 --> 3:34:04.920]  uh... these voting machines all the corruption there but give us your view
[3:34:04.920 --> 3:34:06.400]  on that
[3:34:06.400 --> 3:34:10.160]  well you know that uh... it's a no-brainer you gotta get rid of the voting
[3:34:10.160 --> 3:34:14.360]  machines because they're crooked or they can be hacked and uh...
[3:34:14.360 --> 3:34:19.720]  uh... we can't afford to have another election stolen
[3:34:19.720 --> 3:34:23.680]  well in the past when you were growing up as a young man and then even older
[3:34:23.680 --> 3:34:26.880]  uh... i mean the voting was they put the ballot box out in the middle of the room
[3:34:26.880 --> 3:34:29.000]  they all got counted that precinct
[3:34:29.000 --> 3:34:32.000]  then announced it everybody got to watch the counting you still have a few
[3:34:32.000 --> 3:34:33.280]  problems
[3:34:33.280 --> 3:34:37.120]  uh... lbj did some stuff stuff happened with kennedy up in chicago but it it
[3:34:37.120 --> 3:34:39.320]  became news because we had a good system
[3:34:39.320 --> 3:34:40.360]  uh... now
[3:34:40.360 --> 3:34:43.200]  they have the secret boxes they've been caught hacking them they've been caught
[3:34:43.200 --> 3:34:46.000]  stealing elections people just went to prison in ohio
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:49.240]  uh... from the two thousand four election as we fingered it is fraud
[3:34:49.240 --> 3:34:52.640]  but uh... and then these five big companies all have intelligence agency
[3:34:52.640 --> 3:34:53.680]  ties i mean
[3:34:53.680 --> 3:34:56.240]  how obvious does it have to get
[3:34:56.240 --> 3:35:01.320]  yeah i've got that's my question uh... you know what what we have to see in
[3:35:01.320 --> 3:35:05.760]  order to change it because we know it's crooked
[3:35:05.760 --> 3:35:08.760]  well i guess we first have to expose it is crooked national happening what's the
[3:35:08.760 --> 3:35:11.880]  second step i mean how do you uh... the establishment knew we weren't going to
[3:35:11.880 --> 3:35:13.200]  like what they were doing
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:17.920]  and so now they've moved into block us with these machines
[3:35:17.920 --> 3:35:19.120]  well i think i know
[3:35:19.120 --> 3:35:23.000]  zero about machines uh... you know it wouldn't be that hard for them to fool me
[3:35:23.000 --> 3:35:24.840]  uh... you know and
[3:35:24.840 --> 3:35:28.360]  it's been it's done with pencil and paper i got to get full of that too but
[3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:29.800]  it's a little harder
[3:35:29.800 --> 3:35:31.640]  but she
[3:35:31.640 --> 3:35:34.800]  but you didn't get fooled on the war from day one you didn't get fooled on nine
[3:35:34.800 --> 3:35:35.920]  eleven well
[3:35:35.920 --> 3:35:38.120]  no i didn't
[3:35:38.120 --> 3:35:38.760]  still
[3:35:38.760 --> 3:35:40.880]  but you don't think i know
[3:35:40.880 --> 3:35:42.960]  what's going on there
[3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:47.320]  well now the consent is dropped out uh... i mean do you think uh... ron paul's
[3:35:47.320 --> 3:35:49.760]  the best candidate or what's your take on that
[3:35:49.760 --> 3:35:53.280]  i think he's a great candidate i think he's a great guy and uh... you know i
[3:35:53.280 --> 3:35:54.880]  wish him well and uh...
[3:35:54.880 --> 3:35:58.560]  we'll see what happens uh... i guess tomorrow that will uh... answer a lot
[3:35:58.560 --> 3:36:01.200]  of our questions
[3:36:01.200 --> 3:36:04.920]  yes super Tuesday coming up uh... tomorrow
[3:36:04.920 --> 3:36:09.000]  willy getting back into nine eleven because you brought it up and uh...
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:11.520]  uh... i was debating even bringing it up so
[3:36:11.520 --> 3:36:12.760]  controversial
[3:36:12.760 --> 3:36:14.360]  uh... but uh... you
[3:36:14.360 --> 3:36:17.800]  other questions other things that picture interest in major question
[3:36:17.800 --> 3:36:22.060]  the official story surrounding nine eleven
[3:36:22.060 --> 3:36:25.120]  well but it seems uh...
[3:36:25.120 --> 3:36:29.640]  it happened uh... in the next day i would probably somewhere doing a show and
[3:36:29.640 --> 3:36:34.000]  somebody said what do you think about i said well first of all
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:37.960]  when i get here i like to look around to see who did it before i start swinging
[3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:39.600]  at everybody in the room
[3:36:39.600 --> 3:36:41.160]  and it kind of looked at
[3:36:41.160 --> 3:36:44.600]  what we were doing uh... we get hit over here the next thing you know we're
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:46.920]  jumping on everybody in the town
[3:36:46.920 --> 3:36:48.160]  so uh...
[3:36:48.160 --> 3:36:52.160]  uh... we got hit from Saudi Arabia
[3:36:52.160 --> 3:36:53.680]  i think we have some
[3:36:53.680 --> 3:36:57.760]  questions that need to be answered from those folks
[3:36:57.760 --> 3:37:00.080]  you know that's a really good point you make uh...
[3:37:00.080 --> 3:37:03.240]  again newsweek reported a week after nine eleven that
[3:37:03.240 --> 3:37:06.880]  in the six months before they had mass carrier task forces
[3:37:06.880 --> 3:37:10.360]  forty four thousand u.s. troops eighteen thousand british troops
[3:37:10.360 --> 3:37:13.000]  into shikha stand is being stand surrounding
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:15.480]  and that bush on september tamp signed
[3:37:15.480 --> 3:37:19.240]  the order in the next week to attack afghanistan man what timing willy
[3:37:19.240 --> 3:37:22.640]  that he signed the attack order the day before
[3:37:22.640 --> 3:37:26.840]  yeah i wonder how that happened
[3:37:26.840 --> 3:37:29.800]  i mean uh... how smoking gun is that
[3:37:29.800 --> 3:37:34.080]  yeah yeah i mean what does it take for us to realize that
[3:37:34.080 --> 3:37:39.680]  you know we're having the world over our eyes one more time
[3:37:39.680 --> 3:37:43.440]  you know there's a war against the american people and that's the drug war
[3:37:43.440 --> 3:37:47.720]  back when drugs were sold on store shelves we have a lot less drug use in
[3:37:47.720 --> 3:37:48.960]  this country
[3:37:48.960 --> 3:37:52.600]  they criminalize it it corrupts the police and it puts a lot of money in
[3:37:52.600 --> 3:37:54.160]  drugs and then
[3:37:54.160 --> 3:37:56.680]  uh... the kids get involved in it and
[3:37:56.680 --> 3:37:59.720]  of course they got to go after marijuana cuz seventy plus percent of people
[3:37:59.720 --> 3:38:01.320]  don't use other drugs that
[3:38:01.320 --> 3:38:03.520]  they've they use the medicine
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:05.760]  uh... hemp and you've been a big advocate
[3:38:05.760 --> 3:38:07.360]  uh... you know exposing
[3:38:07.360 --> 3:38:09.280]  how to ponder chemical
[3:38:09.280 --> 3:38:10.960]  shut that down even the
[3:38:10.960 --> 3:38:13.600]  cannabis varieties that don't even have htc
[3:38:13.600 --> 3:38:16.080]  uh... in them
[3:38:16.080 --> 3:38:19.960]  when did you first begin to fight the drug war and to expose
[3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:22.840]  what was happening with the suppression of hemp
[3:38:22.840 --> 3:38:25.320]  well first of all i knew that
[3:38:25.320 --> 3:38:27.240]  there should be uh... that that it's
[3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:29.440]  the greatest uh...
[3:38:29.440 --> 3:38:33.960]  killer on the planet is stress and the best medicine is cannabis and that for
[3:38:33.960 --> 3:38:35.000]  some people
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:39.200]  and uh... it's a good medicine so uh... first of all there was no reason
[3:38:39.200 --> 3:38:42.720]  to make it illegal unless you had an agenda
[3:38:42.720 --> 3:38:47.640]  and the same thing with uh...
[3:38:47.640 --> 3:38:49.880]  the same thing with uh...
[3:38:49.880 --> 3:38:53.520]  with bio diesel and ethanol ethanol back in the
[3:38:53.520 --> 3:38:57.240]  the thirties it was twenty twenty five percent of the market with us was
[3:38:57.240 --> 3:39:01.600]  ethanol set the other seventy five percent was standard all
[3:39:01.600 --> 3:39:04.760]  so uh... once ethanol became a problem
[3:39:04.760 --> 3:39:07.240]  what did they do they came up with prohibition
[3:39:07.240 --> 3:39:11.040]  it did two things it stopped the farmer from growing
[3:39:11.040 --> 3:39:15.320]  and and making ethanol because he was making ethanol in the same piece of
[3:39:15.320 --> 3:39:17.640]  equipment that he made his whiskey at
[3:39:17.640 --> 3:39:18.960]  which was a steal
[3:39:18.960 --> 3:39:20.120]  so when they
[3:39:20.120 --> 3:39:23.440]  brought in prohibition and stopped the whiskey they
[3:39:23.440 --> 3:39:27.240]  also stopped the making of ethanol and they put the farmers out of business
[3:39:27.240 --> 3:39:29.400]  who were making their own fuel
[3:39:29.400 --> 3:39:31.520]  and uh... also uh...
[3:39:31.520 --> 3:39:34.760]  standard all again one the battle
[3:39:34.760 --> 3:39:37.360]  yeah my family's from my in between uh...
[3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:39.880]  fairfield and uh...
[3:39:39.880 --> 3:39:41.160]  buffalo
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:44.960]  and we've got still got over a thousand acres out there you know it
[3:39:44.960 --> 3:39:47.640]  farm and stuff so the years they would sell land off
[3:39:47.640 --> 3:39:50.800]  the original spanish land grant just to just be able to pay the taxes but the
[3:39:50.800 --> 3:39:52.200]  big drought in the fifties
[3:39:52.200 --> 3:39:53.920]  almost made them go under
[3:39:53.920 --> 3:39:58.960]  but uh... there are rotting stills back there down on some of the swamp land i
[3:39:58.960 --> 3:40:01.400]  don't know who put them there they're still regulators they might come after
[3:40:01.400 --> 3:40:04.200]  us but there's all metal remnants of stills
[3:40:04.200 --> 3:40:06.120]  and the story i got was is that
[3:40:06.120 --> 3:40:07.720]  they made them destroy them
[3:40:07.720 --> 3:40:10.640]  and went after people and they weren't even most of the time
[3:40:10.640 --> 3:40:14.120]  making moonshine with them but but but you're right that was an economic
[3:40:14.120 --> 3:40:14.960]  warfare
[3:40:14.960 --> 3:40:19.720]  against the farmers because i don't know that happened to my family the jones
[3:40:19.720 --> 3:40:23.960]  well it definitely happened to a lot of people and uh... it put the ethanol
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:27.680]  but people out of business the first time and in the second time around they
[3:40:27.680 --> 3:40:29.720]  put them out of it and now they're
[3:40:29.720 --> 3:40:35.040]  they're trying to do it again and as all goes up and up and up and up uh...
[3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:39.640]  they're also looking at us over here who are the alternative energies and i've
[3:40:39.640 --> 3:40:42.080]  heard from the all companies that i you know
[3:40:42.080 --> 3:40:45.280]  so i you guys go ahead and do what you're going to do for the next thirty six
[3:40:45.280 --> 3:40:48.520]  months or so and then we're going to come in and take it over
[3:40:48.520 --> 3:40:51.560]  and that will all be well and good except that
[3:40:51.560 --> 3:40:55.120]  when that happens i know it's not going to be good for the local
[3:40:55.120 --> 3:40:59.280]  producer and the local consumer a lot of things will be imported palm oil for
[3:40:59.280 --> 3:41:00.760]  all over the world
[3:41:00.760 --> 3:41:02.120]  and that's not good
[3:41:02.120 --> 3:41:05.200]  uh... until we can get it back to where
[3:41:05.200 --> 3:41:10.320]  uh... but your family and my family can grow their own ethanol in their own
[3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:12.000]  bio diesel
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:15.640]  uh... and then our economy is going to stay bad we have to bring it back to
[3:41:15.640 --> 3:41:17.880]  the sustainable agriculture
[3:41:17.880 --> 3:41:22.080]  locally and it's got to start local
[3:41:22.080 --> 3:41:26.680]  going back to biodiesel uh... there's a big difference between biodiesel and
[3:41:26.680 --> 3:41:28.680]  some of the things are making out of corn
[3:41:28.680 --> 3:41:32.280]  uh... because you're able to make the biodiesel you create out of
[3:41:32.280 --> 3:41:35.280]  uh... all sorts of things can you explain the difference in and and talk
[3:41:35.280 --> 3:41:38.480]  about your the program you've tried to launch nationally
[3:41:38.480 --> 3:41:41.320]  well the first diesel engine
[3:41:41.320 --> 3:41:46.440]  without diesel design his first engine to run on peanut oil
[3:41:46.440 --> 3:41:50.800]  so for all these years with that we've been using
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:53.000]  you know all and diesel and
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:56.680]  we could have been using peanut oil we could have been using all kinds of
[3:41:56.680 --> 3:41:58.880]  vegetable oil
[3:41:58.880 --> 3:42:01.840]  we didn't have to become that dependent
[3:42:01.840 --> 3:42:04.320]  so it was uh...
[3:42:04.320 --> 3:42:08.920]  again uh... it was a planned agenda to keep us away from the
[3:42:08.920 --> 3:42:12.920]  biodiesel because they wanted to sell us all at the same time the government was
[3:42:12.920 --> 3:42:14.600]  using biodiesel
[3:42:14.600 --> 3:42:17.440]  and ethanol and its equipment
[3:42:17.440 --> 3:42:19.080]  because it was
[3:42:19.080 --> 3:42:22.880]  cheaper to produce and uh... the equipment ran better on it but they
[3:42:22.880 --> 3:42:27.440]  didn't get it to the private sector because they wanted us to keep using
[3:42:27.440 --> 3:42:30.200]  oil
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:34.720]  well you talk about the monopoly and they played to do this uh... is is that
[3:42:34.720 --> 3:42:35.960]  where
[3:42:35.960 --> 3:42:39.160]  i mean is that the place you started to learn about the monopoly man in the
[3:42:39.160 --> 3:42:43.480]  larger global forces or when did you discover what for lack of a better term
[3:42:43.480 --> 3:42:47.000]  we'd call the new world order or the king pens
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:50.440]  well i don't know there's one thing and another that was part of it and you know
[3:42:50.440 --> 3:42:54.800]  when the cannabis thing in the marijuana uh... was made illegal back in those
[3:42:54.800 --> 3:42:58.720]  days i traced it back to the petrochemicals again
[3:42:58.720 --> 3:43:01.000]  everything that was made from
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:05.560]  uh... cannabis now is made from petrochemicals so uh... it's just uh...
[3:43:05.560 --> 3:43:10.200]  the oil companies again coming in and taking over and making marijuana illegal
[3:43:10.200 --> 3:43:13.880]  and uh... telling people is crazy and it'll
[3:43:13.880 --> 3:43:17.320]  uh... make you know it'll kill you and all that stuff so far i don't know
[3:43:17.320 --> 3:43:22.240]  anybody that died from marijuana unless the bail fell on them or something
[3:43:22.240 --> 3:43:25.360]  my friend kevin moose just uh... produced a film i consulted on called
[3:43:25.360 --> 3:43:28.480]  american drug war that's going to be airing on showtime
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:32.200]  uh... coming up in uh... march this next month
[3:43:32.200 --> 3:43:35.240]  and he spent four years making it and he's got the numbers from year to year
[3:43:35.240 --> 3:43:38.800]  it changes but about two hundred to three hundred thousand changes each year
[3:43:38.800 --> 3:43:39.920]  die
[3:43:39.920 --> 3:43:41.240]  from uh...
[3:43:41.240 --> 3:43:43.880]  pharmacological legal drugs
[3:43:43.880 --> 3:43:48.160]  and uh... about ten thousand die year from all the really hard to you know but
[3:43:48.160 --> 3:43:51.960]  quote bad illegal drugs which i agree are bad heroin cocaine things like that
[3:43:51.960 --> 3:43:54.520]  and then they can't even find any deaths
[3:43:54.520 --> 3:43:58.000]  from marijuana and george washington grew it on his land and smoke it for
[3:43:58.000 --> 3:43:59.440]  stomach aches
[3:43:59.440 --> 3:44:03.520]  uh... so why is marijuana illegal water they fill the presence with hundreds of
[3:44:03.520 --> 3:44:04.920]  thousands of people a year
[3:44:04.920 --> 3:44:07.080]  who are caught with it
[3:44:07.080 --> 3:44:10.760]  but it's obvious again because everything that's made from
[3:44:10.760 --> 3:44:14.600]  petrochemicals one time was made from cannabis uh...
[3:44:14.600 --> 3:44:16.680]  and uh... it's uh...
[3:44:16.680 --> 3:44:18.600]  even the uh...
[3:44:18.600 --> 3:44:22.440]  the blue jeans uh... did you ever read a book called the emperor where it has no
[3:44:22.440 --> 3:44:24.160]  clothes or jack harrow
[3:44:24.160 --> 3:44:28.280]  yes i don't like the bible yeah and it talks about the original levi's being
[3:44:28.280 --> 3:44:29.180]  made from
[3:44:29.180 --> 3:44:30.680]  cannabis and
[3:44:30.680 --> 3:44:32.760]  uh... talks about uh...
[3:44:32.760 --> 3:44:34.720]  the all the
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:39.480]  ships of the covered wagons the canvas was made from cannabis the sales the
[3:44:39.480 --> 3:44:42.480]  ropes they lasted four or five times longer
[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:46.600]  yeah and when i was in the uh... when i was in high school in the FFA uh...
[3:44:46.600 --> 3:44:47.920]  during the war
[3:44:47.920 --> 3:44:52.480]  and they had us making rope out of him they made him legal again back during
[3:44:52.480 --> 3:44:54.440]  the war because they needed it
[3:44:54.440 --> 3:44:58.240]  and we were making him ropes in the gymnasium there in abba texas
[3:44:58.240 --> 3:45:03.160]  it really is a magic uh... plant uh... i mean you can grow it anywhere and it's
[3:45:03.160 --> 3:45:04.920]  just an incredible
[3:45:04.920 --> 3:45:08.360]  uh... uh... product for industry but i guess
[3:45:08.360 --> 3:45:09.800]  it's not centralized
[3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:13.440]  like a giant chemical plant so they just can't let the farmers have that can
[3:45:13.440 --> 3:45:17.080]  that's right it's uh... they it's just too hard for them to
[3:45:17.080 --> 3:45:20.920]  compete against something that you can just throw out some seeds and uh...
[3:45:20.920 --> 3:45:24.400]  and it's you got food fuel material
[3:45:24.400 --> 3:45:27.840]  uh... everything you need and one
[3:45:27.840 --> 3:45:31.760]  and one speed and that's just too much for them to compete with

[3:45:35.080 --> 3:45:36.720]  scores of films
