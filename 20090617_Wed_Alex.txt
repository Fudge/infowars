[08:06.320 --> 08:23.840]  network i spent about five minutes on this yesterday it should have been my top story but i got
[08:23.840 --> 08:30.720]  sidetracked in the other important news north korea threatening nuclear war the rebellion
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.440]  against the mulas that's going on in iran
[08:38.560 --> 08:45.200]  and there has been new developments there so we'll be breaking that down today here during the next
[08:45.200 --> 08:54.000]  four hours but this story should be just as big as the myac report in the department of
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.320]  homeland security reports that we broke months ago that became national news
[09:01.040 --> 09:07.840]  but they're not going to be because that particular homeland security report focused on
[09:07.840 --> 09:13.680]  conservatives so the national media could cover it and make it a left right issue
[09:13.680 --> 09:19.440]  you and then most people that see themselves as identifying with the left in this country
[09:20.720 --> 09:27.040]  would then come out and defend secret police secret arrest veterans gun owners being spied on
[09:28.160 --> 09:33.440]  and then conservatives could get mad at the liberals in power instead of realizing that
[09:33.440 --> 09:39.840]  there are literally hundreds of other dhs reports out there that we've broken and covered and that
[09:39.840 --> 09:43.920]  others have broken and covered and that have never gotten attention because they will list
[09:43.920 --> 09:51.040]  conservatives and liberals libertarians land rights activist animal rights activist it doesn't
[09:51.040 --> 09:58.160]  matter see they don't want you knowing everybody's being spied on and everybody's an enemy of this
[09:58.160 --> 10:03.280]  criminal illegitimate offshore banking corporate takeover of the united states
[10:03.280 --> 10:13.520]  that's why this story that's up on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com is not getting a lot of
[10:13.520 --> 10:20.560]  attention now the aclu has written a public letter to the white house to the department of
[10:20.560 --> 10:25.520]  defense but it's not getting attention and this story is now three days old
[10:25.520 --> 10:34.800]  because you can't have the liberal you know that's his label when really he's just a front
[10:34.800 --> 10:40.800]  man for a group of pirates robbing us the latest front man the latest person is to distract and
[10:40.800 --> 10:48.960]  befuddle and bamboozle the public while that's not a good story for the new york times in the
[10:48.960 --> 10:53.520]  washington post who are there to enforce the false left right paradigm to keep us in our two
[10:53.520 --> 11:00.960]  little boxes to keep us in a limited awareness of how the world really works to keep us in a box
[11:02.720 --> 11:04.800]  that doesn't sound good to have do d
[11:06.640 --> 11:11.360]  documents saying all protest is an act of terrorism
[11:13.600 --> 11:16.640]  now this is really nothing new the deputy attorney general
[11:16.640 --> 11:27.920]  general in 2003 was in the oakland tribune his name was mr calhoun the deputy attorney general
[11:30.480 --> 11:31.840]  under mr lock here
[11:35.760 --> 11:40.960]  and the deputy general said all protest you can go pull this up off the micro fissure
[11:40.960 --> 11:48.080]  the lexus nexus of the google i made a big deal about i read it on air for weeks he said
[11:49.440 --> 11:53.280]  well the feds have advised us and we agree with them here at the state level that
[11:53.280 --> 12:02.000]  this war is fighting terrorism and so if you protest the war you're aiding al qaeda because
[12:02.000 --> 12:12.080]  saddam is al qaeda and he has wmd's too and so it's a form of sedition just like michael savage
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.080]  says put you in jail if you protest the war remember him saying that this is a this is a
[12:16.080 --> 12:21.600]  talking point a government talking point the deputy attorney general said we're going to ban
[12:21.600 --> 12:26.400]  all protest in california and not issue permits turning a right into a privilege
[12:26.400 --> 12:35.680]  because it's a act of terrorism to protest the war and we've gotten countless secret documents
[12:35.680 --> 12:41.840]  we got a secret document sent to our office a couple months ago that every in the fed
[12:41.840 --> 12:48.560]  demonstration in the country this was particularly this document was on texas this was out of camp
[12:48.560 --> 12:56.880]  mayberry yes we really have a camp mayberry and no andy griffin doesn't work there a bunch of spies
[12:56.880 --> 13:03.200]  do spying on the american people engaging in treason the real treason i'm not saying you're
[13:03.200 --> 13:07.920]  all bad at camp mayberry the point is those intelligence offices are engaging in treason
[13:07.920 --> 13:18.320]  hooked into the treasonous offices at fort blitz and fort hood and the document up on info wars
[13:18.320 --> 13:24.160]  dot com with phone numbers you can call it's a real document they get real upset when you call them
[13:25.360 --> 13:32.640]  says we're all terrorist period out protesting the private federal reserve and it says don't
[13:32.640 --> 13:39.440]  let them know playing close army intelligence that you're with army intelligence they may attack you
[13:40.000 --> 13:46.560]  oh yes those families and black people and white people and a cross section of american society
[13:46.560 --> 13:52.000]  out there protesting the private fed stealing and robbing everything
[13:55.600 --> 14:01.120]  and then we have this article do d training manual describes protesters low-level terrorism period
[14:03.040 --> 14:06.480]  pentagon training course says engaging in first amendment is terrorist activity
[14:06.480 --> 14:12.640]  it's given to everyone in the army the aclu's written the do d regarding its anti-terrorism
[14:12.640 --> 14:17.520]  and force protection annual refresher training course which advises personnel that political
[14:17.520 --> 14:24.320]  protest amounts to low-level terrorism what are the feds try to get senators state senator menace
[14:24.320 --> 14:32.160]  in that bill in 2004 to pass or that they did pass and then instantly overnight repeal in road island
[14:33.360 --> 14:41.440]  in 2004 remember it said if you criticize the government you will be arrested and put in
[14:41.440 --> 14:47.280]  prison for life both bills said it and when the states got caught road island washington state the
[14:47.280 --> 14:51.760]  two that we learned of i'm sure the rest had it as well we can't keep track all this folks
[14:55.120 --> 15:05.200]  they went in the big paper there in providence road island and they went on the providence
[15:05.200 --> 15:12.400]  nbc and they went into the uh oragonian and they said well the feds told us the past this
[15:12.400 --> 15:17.680]  homeland security you know lobbied us to pass this bill and it said download music life in a
[15:17.680 --> 15:22.720]  forced labor camp it says forced labor camp forced forest labor camp in the case of origan
[15:25.440 --> 15:30.880]  remember all the cases of teenage girls that write jokes about their principal and their
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.600]  myspace so they get sent for six months to a year to a quote forced labor camp that was in the news
[15:36.960 --> 15:42.240]  this is already going on everywhere they're just phasing it in right in front of everybody
[15:42.240 --> 15:46.400]  like it's no big deal and the sheep as long as you do you can walk up one of these sheep
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.400]  this is figurative and stab them right the throat and if the sheep didn't put out a bray of fear
[15:52.400 --> 16:00.240]  the other sheep would go on munching their grass it's only a big event or wing flapping feathers
[16:00.240 --> 16:05.760]  flying around squawking that will upset them and as long as the mainstream media doesn't squawk
[16:05.760 --> 16:15.040]  about it they don't care but you know any little petty thing they can get the public all afraid
[16:15.040 --> 16:23.200]  and their knees knocking so there you have it let me give you all the news flash i know most
[16:23.200 --> 16:27.040]  of my listeners understand this better than i but for any new listeners or people you're talking to

[16:48.160 --> 16:54.560]  going to fully bankrupt everything and bring us into hardcore third world serfdom period

[36:51.680 --> 36:58.080]  believe that we have rights and listen we are evil ladies and gentlemen to them if you could be
[36:58.080 --> 37:07.440]  teleported back 1200 years ago to the peak of the aztec empire in mexico city where mexico city is
[37:07.440 --> 37:15.760]  today and you could be there on a solar or lunar eclipse as they were sacrificing tens of thousands
[37:15.760 --> 37:23.680]  of people in a single day hundreds of altars going 24 hours a day cutting people's hearts out as
[37:23.680 --> 37:29.840]  fast as they could and individuals willingly wanting to have their hearts ripped out willingly
[37:29.840 --> 37:35.760]  under mass mind control believing they had to do it to make the universe not die to make the gods
[37:35.760 --> 37:44.240]  not wake up and this dream this matrix reality end you if you were teleported back 1200 years ago
[37:46.160 --> 37:52.320]  to any of the sacrificial cities the chitchnitsa to to loom to any of them
[37:54.240 --> 38:02.480]  you would be insane and you would be a terrorist there with the smoke filled sky and the
[38:02.480 --> 38:10.720]  priest in their headdresses holding the hearts up to the sun one after the other as fast as
[38:10.720 --> 38:14.720]  they could cutting through the rib cage with an with obsidian knives
[38:17.440 --> 38:21.760]  blasted out of their gourd on hallucinogenic mushrooms and liquors
[38:21.760 --> 38:33.920]  and dead bodies rolling down the steps and being gutted and being hung and being sold then
[38:33.920 --> 38:39.920]  in the market the main priest class funding the tax their tax was flesh talk about hellraiser
[38:39.920 --> 38:43.520]  their tax was blood and then the meat was sold in the markets
[38:43.520 --> 38:51.840]  they would kick most of the bodies down one room of steps but others were thrown down other steps
[38:51.840 --> 38:57.760]  to the poor women and children that was the welfare this is on record this is not denied
[39:00.880 --> 39:04.720]  they had one side of the pyramid would be for the welfare people and they would get a limited
[39:04.720 --> 39:14.080]  amount of succulent long ham the favorites of course were children succulent plump and delicious
[39:14.800 --> 39:24.400]  now if you were to be beamed back teleported back 1200 years ago or even 600 before cortez
[39:24.400 --> 39:32.400]  arrived and thought he'd found hell and according to the anthropologist and the archaeologist
[39:32.400 --> 39:37.680]  they think Cortez is the bad guy I'm not saying they were angels but my god compared to the Aztecs
[39:38.800 --> 39:43.280]  dominating Mayan and Mesoamerican society I'll go with Cortez
[39:51.040 --> 39:58.480]  but you teleport yourself back to that society and if you tried to walk up and speak through a
[39:58.480 --> 40:05.840]  interpreter if you tried to speak through some newfangled computer and you could
[40:05.840 --> 40:09.600]  you could speak to them with an instant translator and say you're crazy don't
[40:09.600 --> 40:16.960]  cut your children's hearts out don't eat fellow human beings the sun is a gas gaseous star that
[40:16.960 --> 40:23.360]  we orbit and it's not alive and a snake god's not eating it when there's an eclipse that's the moon
[40:23.360 --> 40:34.560]  shadow going in front of it that's the moon aligning with it don't do it they would say
[40:34.560 --> 40:41.280]  you were insane and they would grab you and to them you would be insane and they would drag you
[40:41.280 --> 40:46.800]  away to have your heart cut out and you'd be on somebody's dinner table hours later
[40:46.800 --> 40:56.800]  to the Nazis if you thought it wasn't right to grab retarded children and euthanize them and
[40:56.800 --> 41:01.600]  forced abortions of people that you thought didn't have good genetics or the murder of Jews or Gypsies
[41:01.600 --> 41:08.480]  or the forced labor camps for the Polish people if you thought it was wrong to go into Russian
[41:08.480 --> 41:12.320]  towns they'd taken the Russians at first in Blackstone they were greeting the Nazis like
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.800]  they were liberators until a few hours later when their town elders were taken and killed
[41:16.800 --> 41:22.560]  and the people were shipped off on railway lines to force labor then the news spread by the few
[41:22.560 --> 41:26.880]  survivors to the town a few miles away the Germans were coming and they were ready to join the red
[41:26.880 --> 41:35.120]  army but to the Nazis you were insane if you resisted them you know over the years i would
[41:35.120 --> 41:38.960]  criticize the Aztecs and explain these cultural differences and i would get calls from my local
[41:38.960 --> 41:44.000]  tv show and the radio as well and they'd say how dare you be a bigot and criticize the Aztecs that
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.440]  was just their culture and i said so right i am bigoted towards that culture i don't like the
[41:49.440 --> 41:55.040]  Nazi culture either are you saying theirs was just a culture and they would stutter and say well
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.760]  that's entirely different and i would say really and they'd go oh actually i get your point
[41:59.760 --> 42:11.760]  no i think the clean cut hard working decent never tell a lie strong americana that was never
[42:11.760 --> 42:18.000]  perfect but better than any other nation on earth really the flower of the puritan idea the flower
[42:21.920 --> 42:27.200]  of the people that came over in the Mayflower i mean that really was something special it wasn't
[42:27.200 --> 42:34.320]  perfect and it was wicked and worldly and fleshly but it was the best that human society ever developed
[42:34.320 --> 42:39.520]  and i call that sanity compared to the Aztecs or the Nazis or the Babylonians
[42:42.160 --> 42:51.120]  i call that sanity and i choose to make that my reality i choose to say a little baby in the womb
[42:51.120 --> 42:57.600]  has rights and i think it's precious and special i choose to think that shooting everybody else
[42:57.600 --> 43:02.320]  with forcible injections with a history of hurting people and when the government's run
[43:02.320 --> 43:07.680]  by a bunch of eugenicists on records saying they want to kill us i think it's a bad idea to take
[43:07.680 --> 43:13.600]  what they give us and to trust them call that insane if you want i believe i'm more sane than
[43:13.600 --> 43:23.440]  you i believe i have common sense i believe in the ideas of the renaissance true liberalism
[43:25.120 --> 43:28.080]  if you call tattletale squads in everybody's house
[43:30.240 --> 43:35.120]  and you call everybody being regulated and taxed and watched and controlled by a bunch of parasites
[43:35.120 --> 43:41.760]  if you call that liberal well then i'm not liberal and if you call conservative lying about the iraqi
[43:41.760 --> 43:46.960]  setting them up with weapons pulling the rug out from under them going in blowing them to kingdom
[43:46.960 --> 43:54.480]  come putting muslim extremists in power taking women's rights away if you call that conservative
[43:55.600 --> 44:00.720]  then i'm not a conservative see i'm a free human being i'm for human liberty and control of our
[44:00.720 --> 44:08.240]  own destiny i believe in the species i know my body's gonna die i know my time of consciousness
[44:08.240 --> 44:15.440]  is very short and i know i live on to the species and i love the species and i love life itself
[44:16.160 --> 44:22.560]  and what we've built and i know it's a great contest which way society's going to go
[44:25.920 --> 44:31.040]  human society's like a spoiled 14 year old teenager who's been hanging out with bad kids
[44:31.040 --> 44:39.040]  with bad 15 16 year olds and who's robbed a few houses maybe even knocked over a liquor store
[44:41.440 --> 44:45.120]  and who if we don't turn them around will be dead or in prison in six months
[44:52.880 --> 44:57.440]  but see this this bad teenager doesn't just have a chance to grow up and get a job and
[44:57.440 --> 45:02.480]  find a wonderful woman and have children and enjoy the joys of life and responsibility
[45:04.000 --> 45:11.760]  this teenager symbolizing the species has a chance to go to the stars the ear has not heard the eye
[45:11.760 --> 45:18.400]  has not seen that the the the mind has not imagined the things that god has in store for us
[45:21.040 --> 45:24.880]  and there are a bunch of selfish homo sapiens sapiens of our own species
[45:24.880 --> 45:31.280]  who have decided to wall off humanity dumb humanity down so we can be more easily managed
[45:31.280 --> 45:39.920]  and controlled so we can then be called forcibly killed so they and their progeny can control the
[45:39.920 --> 45:47.760]  future we can't let these jealous inbred wicked ruthless cold-blooded who who who intermarry
[45:47.760 --> 45:52.880]  together and i believe to a certain extent have created a new type of homo sapiens sapiens certainly
[45:52.880 --> 46:01.120]  a new breed of the super predator i believe and i know from studying sociology psychology history
[46:01.120 --> 46:06.880]  and my heart and common sense and wisdom that we must not allow this group of miscreant
[46:06.880 --> 46:13.760]  malfunctioning dangerous people to take to the stars we must not let them wall off the better
[46:14.400 --> 46:19.680]  nature of man from the future this is evil manifesting through our species
[46:19.680 --> 46:24.560]  taking control of the evolution and development of man
[46:26.240 --> 46:30.800]  and don't be so close-minded fools that listen to your government churches when i say evolution
[46:30.800 --> 46:35.680]  i mean the evolution of the helicopter the evolution of the aircraft from kitty hawk
[46:36.240 --> 46:42.640]  to the space planes of the day evolution of genetic engineering evolution of hydroelectric
[46:42.640 --> 46:52.640]  power evolution of the microchip from the primitive transistor tube from the tube to the
[46:52.640 --> 47:01.680]  transistor to the silicon chip to the nano tech that evolution that's all around you
[47:03.600 --> 47:10.320]  the elite are threatened by renaissance i am not threatened by minds burning with
[47:10.320 --> 47:18.160]  enlightenment and understanding minds exploding with a trillion ideas and dreams dreams that
[47:18.160 --> 47:25.600]  we will manifest look at everything man dreams he is able to build his nightmares and his greatest
[47:25.600 --> 47:32.160]  ecstasy i want my progeny and that is your progeny we're all interrelated
[47:32.160 --> 47:40.480]  that's why i can't hate a black man even though he hates me
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.800]  that's why i can't hate a mexican even though they hate me that's why i can't join with the white
[47:46.800 --> 47:52.640]  supreme assistant some primitive tribalism even though i know the system is attempting on record
[47:52.640 --> 47:58.400]  to annihilate what we know as is the white race because the elite openly state in their own eugenics
[47:58.400 --> 48:05.920]  manuals that they believe that's a threat to their domination true eugenics isn't just to call
[48:05.920 --> 48:10.560]  what they believe to be inferior it is to call what could challenge and rival them this is these
[48:10.560 --> 48:19.440]  are just basic facts because in any journey to kill your fellow man you end up killing yourself
[48:21.040 --> 48:25.840]  and i know the history of humanity i know i am here breathing and living today because i had
[48:25.840 --> 48:35.280]  ancestors that usurped and were usurped but in the old usurping and the old takeovers people were
[48:35.280 --> 48:45.840]  incorporated into the blood and the hybrids were born and developed not the clicking retardation
[48:45.840 --> 48:53.600]  of the inbreds who think they're the elite but the scientific dictatorship seeks to blot out what
[48:53.600 --> 49:04.400]  is intelligent and good because it competes with the elite here i am with hundreds of articles
[49:04.400 --> 49:08.400]  i want to cover and i'm off on another diatribe i'm off on another rant but it's important
[49:09.840 --> 49:15.280]  and it deals with the nature of society in our world and what the establishment what the social
[49:15.280 --> 49:20.720]  engineers what the controllers are thinking and doing and saying the information i am relaying to
[49:20.720 --> 49:26.400]  you is what they write in their most prized and important annals that are even public
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.920]  and they're on a race to dumb us down to lock us down and to kill us so they can enjoy the spoils
[49:34.640 --> 49:43.840]  of the incredibly far-reaching technological systems they've already developed that they've
[49:43.840 --> 49:50.720]  already walled off from us under the guise of national security and world security and this
[49:50.720 --> 49:58.480]  is a debate we need to have not a debate on how big your biceps are how big your breast job is or
[49:59.040 --> 50:03.520]  how cool your neighbors think you are how great your golf swing is and i'm not saying any of
[50:03.520 --> 50:10.640]  that stuff is bad i'm not judging you i'm saying i know what you're thinking about i think about it
[50:10.640 --> 50:20.480]  too and i'm telling you to look past your body to your mind and your soul and to really ask what
[50:20.480 --> 50:30.560]  matters you are only conscious on this plane for the flicker of a candle flame in a high wind

[54:53.520 --> 54:59.200]  trying to destroy everything you read the globalist weird poetry you read the stuff written by the
[54:59.200 --> 55:04.160]  suicidal nihilist the transhumanist and it's all about how they can't wait to murder everybody
[55:04.160 --> 55:08.560]  and they can't wait to merge with the machines and they can't wait to destroy the universe if they
[55:08.560 --> 55:19.360]  feel like it and it's all just frothing demonic garbage I mean what would a control freak do what's
[55:19.360 --> 55:24.400]  the what a control freak wants to make the decisions so when you really read the philosophy
[55:24.400 --> 55:30.080]  and I have some of their quotes in endgame blueprint for global enslavement they say oh yes
[55:30.080 --> 55:34.480]  we're suicidal nihilist we want to go on willing and so the only way for us to go on willing is to
[55:34.480 --> 55:40.240]  go ahead and kill ourselves and the planet at the same time oh that means we really got power if we
[55:40.240 --> 55:47.680]  control all of history and turn the planet into nothing but a slag heap I mean these are university
[55:47.680 --> 55:55.440]  heads these are top people these are billionaires this is what they're into it's very very sick
[55:56.880 --> 56:02.240]  and you're going to figure that out one way or another we've got to beat them they are right
[56:02.240 --> 56:07.440]  out of hell even if you don't believe in a hell and and and hell razor type creatures coming up out
[56:07.440 --> 56:14.320]  of the pit that is being manifest by these people's minds they are manifesting that here
[56:15.280 --> 56:20.640]  in the third dimension and it's real ladies and gentlemen wherever it comes from whatever it is
[56:20.640 --> 56:27.040]  pure evil is real and it will tell me it will tell you it will tell us oh you're not allowed to make
[56:27.040 --> 56:31.840]  a judgment of good or evil but then it will carry out the force of action it will seek to dominate
[56:31.840 --> 56:34.640]  it always tells you to hesitate and there is no right and wrong
[56:44.400 --> 56:49.040]  it will always try to set the morals for you but then tell you you have no right to make a moral
[56:49.040 --> 56:57.680]  judgment it's all a mind game I'm looking at a story right now print that for me federal program
[56:57.680 --> 57:06.160]  issues grenade launcher to police departments and tanks because they got a wage war against the people
[57:06.160 --> 57:12.640]  I got stacks on that news all protesting as terrorism but the biggest issue here is I'm
[57:12.640 --> 57:17.680]  going to cover in the next hour federal reserve to be given sweeping new powers totally lawless
[57:17.680 --> 57:22.080]  Steve Watson info wars.net with links to the Washington Times Associated Press and others
[57:22.080 --> 57:27.120]  reporting on it and then the news says oh yes this will stop the corrupt banks the federal
[57:27.120 --> 57:33.840]  reserve is the holding company for the big banks it is private and then this lie Obama to propose
[57:33.840 --> 57:40.080]  strict new regulation of financial industry la times and then you actually read it and it says
[57:40.800 --> 57:48.000]  Obama plan would cut number of us bank regulators I mean this is just incredible ladies and gentlemen
[57:49.360 --> 57:53.600]  so we'll break down what that really means you think the 14.8 trillion that's a month old
[57:53.600 --> 58:01.040]  numbers we should get new ones soon probably be 16 trillion on average that's how much it'll go up
[58:01.040 --> 58:06.320]  every few months they give us the new numbers they'll probably be let me guess I bet it's 16.3 trillion
[58:06.320 --> 58:11.280]  one of the next number comes out in the next few weeks you know it's 12 something trillion that 14.8
[58:11.280 --> 58:19.040]  trillion might be 17 trillion that's more than the whole GDP plus the north com standing by I mean
[58:19.040 --> 58:24.240]  north com is standing by if you try to stop the bankers taking everything you got by the way it's
[58:24.240 --> 58:29.680]  on cnn they're now taking people's houses that are paid for and if you don't leave the police come

[1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:42.480]  things only got worse now they're saying that the president and the congress are going to make the

[1:01:09.520 --> 1:01:13.280]  for this segment a little bit of the next i like to get him up each month and we forgot to
[1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:17.360]  have him on for two months so he's been on the last few weeks a couple times marty shactor
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:23.040]  what a character uh 1947 with his daddy he got back from world war two he was in the chemical
[1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:28.240]  core in japan and they got back and they and his dad pointed out there was no more real soap
[1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:34.000]  available made from vegetables and fruits and uh it was all detergents and chemicals and marty
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.360]  had been in the chemical weapons core and he recognized these were chemical weapons ingredients
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:42.480]  and what they do is they take the toxic waste left over from oil refining and other things
[1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:50.800]  the the distillates and i've actually got textbooks on it petroleum engineer textbooks
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:54.400]  somebody sent me years ago but the point i meant to bring that on tv and show it to folks
[1:01:54.400 --> 1:01:59.520]  but the issue is they take toxic waste it's left over and they dump it in and that's what your soap
[1:01:59.520 --> 1:02:05.040]  is and it gives most people the asthma and the rest of it marty has had organic soaps since 47
[1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:12.240]  60 plus years 62 years 63 years and they got it at 85 off supermarket prices because
[1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:15.680]  you're not paying for all the advertising you're not paying for procter and gamble
[1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:20.400]  you're not paying for the distribution it's factory direct to you and they weren't factory
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:25.040]  direct to buyers until five six years ago and jenesis got him as a sponsor so marty shactor
[1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:32.080]  joins us now for folks to save money and not get asthma and fry their mucus membranes but hey

[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:04.560]  and i mentioned this last hour let me go ahead and get into this first right now and actually
[1:14:04.560 --> 1:14:12.720]  break this down into tail there is no light at the end of the tunnel that is the proverbial
[1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:18.400]  freight train coming at you unless we arrest these bankers unless we audit these bankers
[1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:22.960]  unless we abolish these bankers this is a fraudulent offshore crime syndicate
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:29.680]  that is engaged in a hijacking a corporate takeover of our nation
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:35.120]  federal reserve to be given sweeping new powers
[1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:41.440]  steve was an article the privately owned and run federal reserve is to be handed sweeping
[1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:45.680]  new powers under obama administration proposals in an ill that will please bankers who lobbied
[1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:51.280]  for more fed oversight of their activities so this is the private banks bank of america jp morgan
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:15:00.240]  chase uh wells fargo and others that are federal reserve shareholders saying give our government
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:08.080]  front the holding company more power for us it's a complete sleight of hand i mean it's so simple
[1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:12.560]  but then almost so complex because the public just can't understand that it's like give me more
[1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:17.840]  power to regulate myself which means give me more power to do whatever i want the new rules
[1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:21.440]  will see the fed giving the authority to regulate any company whose activity
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:25.280]  it believes could threaten the economy in the markets they've already seen them seize christler
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:30.640]  and handed over to foreign corporations with taxpayer money on top as a sweetener we've already
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:36.800]  seen them seize gm and hack it up into bunch of pieces and then now it's a political tool
[1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:41.120]  domestically where you've got to give campaign money to obama or or democratic congressman
[1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:45.440]  for your dealership that's worth tens of millions in some cases to stay open or they steal it and
[1:15:45.440 --> 1:15:50.480]  give it to their friends i mean this is being admitted mainstream news this is wall to wall
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:58.160]  mafia the and folks why shouldn't they the public is on prozac and on ridland and on fluoride and
[1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:06.400]  suck in their thumbs they want more raping they're going to get it the final plan to be
[1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:13.200]  released on wednesdays today which originally aimed to streamline and consolidate banking
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:19.120]  and securities regulation in one or two agencies now is expected to sidestep most judicial disputes
[1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:24.400]  and simply impose across the board standards to be applied by all financial regulators
[1:16:24.400 --> 1:16:28.560]  according to administration industry sources reports of washington times now let me stop right there
[1:16:28.560 --> 1:16:35.360]  see first with the october third banker takeover bill known as the banker bailout
[1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:40.080]  it said unlimited money you can make out of nothing we got to pay it to you in taxes
[1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:44.720]  we then have to pay interest on money we give you taxpayer gives them the trillions and then
[1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:50.560]  we pay interest on them to the money we gave them see they can do anything they want so wouldn't
[1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:55.440]  you come up with that scam i take all your money and then you pay me interest on it yes
[1:16:55.440 --> 1:17:02.080]  yes maybe like if somebody came and knocked on your door hey mr. jones i'd like to
[1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:07.520]  have you give me your two hundred and fifty thousand dollar house
[1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:16.880]  okay and then when you give me your house you're gonna pay me interest on the house
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:20.320]  and generally interest is double what the note is so you're gonna pay me another two hundred
[1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:29.680]  thousand dollars for me taking your house for free now that makes no sense it doesn't compute
[1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:35.360]  does it well that's how this works that's how the new old order rolls and if you don't like it north
[1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:40.480]  com and paramilitary police are standing by and folks they don't know which end is up
[1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:44.080]  just like the general public all they know is they've been told they're on a power trip
[1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:51.440]  go out there and taser the slaves and squeeze money out of them all they've been told is the
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:55.440]  public are a bunch of terrorists they're going to start protesting and all protest is terrorism
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:02.800]  official pentagon are you starting to figure this out so they got that unlimited power to rape
[1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:07.440]  rob and steal no oversight no government agency no one can look into them congress passed a law
[1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:13.200]  saying that now they're about trying to get another law passed where they run everything
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:19.440]  outside of banking and they're saying your farm your ranch work brigades all the executive orders
[1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:23.760]  that we read on air where they can put you in work brigades folks i got the washington times
[1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:27.680]  coming up the next segment where they admit they're hiring criminals for the youth brigades i mean
[1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:31.920]  we already knew this but it's red level let me just get for folks that don't know history when
[1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:36.400]  the government starts hiring citizen armies domestically the police people look out that's
[1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:40.960]  just that's bad but when they start putting them in uniforms look out and then when they
[1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:44.560]  start hiring crooks boy you know you're in deep trouble
[1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:51.920]  and they're going to march them out there to boss everybody around and people are going to
[1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:56.720]  bust a cap in their butts unfortunately and then they're going to call you terrorist and then the
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:02.240]  war is on and they're going to have millions out of work dumbasses and i'm sorry to use that term
[1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:06.080]  that's what they are that they're going to turn loose on you with machine guns and it ain't going
[1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:10.000]  to be pretty because these people are going to be on power trips they're going to be led but have
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:14.560]  you noticed every major police department is doubling tripling quadrupling or more their
[1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:19.120]  SWAT teams they're training to wage war on us up one side and down the other i'm going to tell the

[1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:32.560]  government that carries out all these crimes against our nation and violates the bill of rights
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:38.400]  and constitution you make me sick how you wrap yourselves in the flag if you really in your
[1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:42.640]  mind think your pro freedom and pro liberty and you believe all this baloney about how you're
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:47.360]  taking our rights to fight al-qaeda while your own manuals say all protesting is terrorism
[1:34:47.360 --> 1:34:53.920]  and veterans and gun owners are your main target just shut up because i'm sick of it just admit
[1:34:53.920 --> 1:34:59.040]  your dirtbag criminals if you're serving this and you think it's good now if you're on our side
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:03.280]  that's fine but i i want to see more from you i want to see more leak documents i want to see
[1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:08.320]  more resistance i want to see you go public and speak out what happened to you how could americans
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:13.920]  just 50 60 years ago charge machine gun nests to their death fighting on foreign shores and
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:20.080]  fraudulent wars but then when our own republic is overrun by parasites and scum go along with it
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:27.200]  all right let me get into the news i was covering
[1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:36.160]  the lighthouses announced the new powers for the federal reserve
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:42.560]  that the federal reserve will be able to seize any company or corporation
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:48.800]  it's basically the executive orders in fact i asked you guys to dig through that giant box of
[1:35:48.800 --> 1:35:54.160]  files did you find my files on executive order i had rob digging in there an hour ago and i meant
[1:35:54.160 --> 1:36:00.880]  to have this he found it okay if you read the executive orders about brigades and forced labor
[1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:09.120]  and all of that it says it well that's basically the implementation of this through law kind of
[1:36:09.120 --> 1:36:12.880]  like they build the fema camps we describe how they're going to run how they're going to operate
[1:36:12.880 --> 1:36:17.920]  how they're going to sell them to the community as if it's a fed real community assistance program
[1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:23.120]  and then the exact bill of what i've reverse engineered and broken down on air for you
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:28.640]  it gets then proposed in a piece of legislation kind of like after they've been spying on us for
[1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:36.240]  decades without warrants they then have congress pass a law saying they can do it without warrants
[1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:42.480]  that's their in your face system and then they have all these old executive orders that they've

[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:27.200]  stack from monday and couldn't obama says cities may be destroyed bulldoze thank you
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:31.360]  i want to get to that later there's not enough to just mention and i want to give
[1:38:31.360 --> 1:38:38.000]  me exact headline 11 denial this is all being implemented in beta tested every criminal
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:45.360]  reorganization continuity of government north com takeover operation that there is
[1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:50.320]  is being implemented right now
[1:38:54.160 --> 1:38:59.120]  it's all being done right now it's all being implemented i'm gonna go over this more
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:01.760]  next hour as we got a film crew in here making a film about it
[1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:12.000]  and then meanwhile it says the federal reserve will be the one that runs this
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:18.080]  not the white house not homeland security above that now with actual governmental power not just
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:23.840]  private banking power over the money the issuance of currency and credit but now government power
[1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:30.560]  by a private offshore corporation the federal reserve i mean the height of treason the height
[1:39:30.560 --> 1:39:35.440]  of open dictatorship this isn't just the government running a dictatorship of the tyranny
[1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:45.840]  of the plutocrats this is an offshore banking consortium combine openly setting up a new
[1:39:46.480 --> 1:39:50.560]  form of government that should be the headline at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:55.360]  so i know curtain on paul watson listing i know they understand this give me articles on this in
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:39:59.520]  the written word so people can understand it with all the points i've just made this is open
[1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:09.760]  1776 against us this is a 2009 declaration of tyranny for global corporate monopoly capitalism
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:17.680]  open new form of government with the bankers above homeland security which is the forced
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:21.760]  reorganization arm just like they've done in third world countries over and over again
[1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:30.080]  and then you read the news it's old federal reserve to gain power under a plan
[1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:34.560]  and it goes on to fix the economy and then to take over companies and industries oh
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:38.960]  with the money they're going to loan the industries with strings attached and now it's
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:42.960]  been declassified that they ordered the banks to take the federal reserve money so the quote
[1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:48.160]  government so the federal reserve have government power over them here's the la times lying obama
[1:40:48.160 --> 1:40:54.720]  to propose strict new regulation of industry financial industry and you read the truth and
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:59.600]  in Reuters obama plan would cut number of us bank regulators just like they've gotten rid of most the
[1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:05.360]  irs investigators for rich people and sick them the few they're left on people making less than
[1:41:05.360 --> 1:41:10.960]  20 000 a year that is sick the obama administration plans to call because it's run by criminals
[1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:15.360]  folks the government is run by offshore criminals they don't want any regulation on themselves
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:19.120]  they're allowed to do whatever they want and when they want to every once in a while burn somebody
[1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:24.320]  that doesn't play ball with them they go burn them and then that's also a kind of a sacrificial
[1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:31.760]  judas goat for people sacrificial scapegoat sacrificial lamb the obama administration
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:36.080]  plans to call for the u.s. office of thrift supervision to close as part of its overall
[1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:40.960]  financial regulation which would also include the elimination of the federal thrift charter for banks
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:45.920]  so many rules on them for corruption the plan required large interconnected firms to draft
[1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:53.120]  a credible plan to self-regulate themselves for how they would unwind if they can if they ran into
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:58.720]  severe trouble a senior administration official told reporters on a conference call Tuesday
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:07.280]  and where's my new york times i had it here i can't keep track of this anymore
[1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:08.560]  oh here it is
[1:42:11.920 --> 1:42:15.920]  down that in the stack here we go here's a whole stack of this just on this subject
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:29.520]  okay now listen up and listen up good i'm explaining how all this works they gotta
[1:42:29.520 --> 1:42:35.040]  have enforcers for all this and they admit they got door-to-door people knocking on doors they run
[1:42:35.040 --> 1:42:44.960]  federal ads with federal money on radio tv and print acting like americorps secure core
[1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:51.760]  usaservice.org all these groups are government but but the organizations and the funding is
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:59.680]  private totally illegal and then they recruit them to private groups run by the democratic
[1:42:59.680 --> 1:43:05.360]  party and george soros and others and they have already got over a million hired with your money
[1:43:05.360 --> 1:43:11.680]  i mean they gave two and a half billion to acorn alone and they're on power trips and they think
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:17.280]  they're saving the world and they are dangerous now former americorps official says obama removed
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:24.560]  him for doing my job this is out of associated press gerald wallspin was removed from president
[1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:31.360]  obama last week as the inspector general for americorps and other service programs his decision
[1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:36.400]  followed wallpins investigation into the alleged misuse of federal grants by sacramental mayor
[1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:42.080]  kevin johnson another rising star for the globalist a former nba star and obama supporter and the
[1:43:42.080 --> 1:43:47.520]  nonprofit education groups he headed which are these youth brigades it goes on now
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:57.520]  this is the new york times listen and listen carefully new york times today new orleans program
[1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:04.960]  linked green jobs and youth development new orleans resident this is a positive article
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:09.680]  they have positive articles about seven-year-olds tattling on mommy for taking hot baths and they
[1:44:09.680 --> 1:44:16.720]  write fake tickets on their parents that are really little data reports uh that are then filed
[1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:22.160]  and the parents giggling in the article saying i love my seven-year-old writing me tickets and
[1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:26.080]  spying on me with the school i mean this is the soviet union but they're making it cute and
[1:44:26.080 --> 1:44:31.200]  funny in the new york times kind of like a month ago when they reported that the boy scouts at age
[1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:37.360]  14 are training for gun confiscation and to quote take on disgruntled vets and seek and destroy ops
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:42.480]  then it describes them with the with the homeland security swat team practicing killing veterans
[1:44:42.480 --> 1:44:50.080]  you can't make this up you can't make up department of homeland security and do d saying all protesters
[1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:59.920]  terror you can't make this up next stop the twilight zone realize what's happening the more
[1:44:59.920 --> 1:45:03.920]  you don't wake up and scream buddy murder and call the talk radio and go to city council and call
[1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:09.040]  congress the more it encourages them you're like when i'm a yuppie they'll think i'm a kook i've
[1:45:09.040 --> 1:45:13.680]  never called congress i've never gone to city council you better buddy you better get your butt
[1:45:13.680 --> 1:45:20.000]  moving you better verify the things i've said and then realize that that this is a hot tyranny
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:24.560]  this is an extermination tyranny we've seen this over and over again the attack profile they're
[1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:32.000]  launching is 100 percent a mass color they're planning to kill millions of us this is a soviet
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:39.680]  style operation the bankers funded them all over the world this is a radical reorganization
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:43.680]  gutting out and getting rid of the middle class and a lot of the middle class is going to try to
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:47.600]  serve it because all they do is social climb and they're going to lick boats and try to be part of
[1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:55.360]  it they're going to get their butts cold too in the third or fourth wave this is hardcore now listen
[1:45:55.360 --> 1:46:04.000]  to me and listen carefully phil taylor reports new york times new orleans resident jordan walters
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:09.360]  quit his sales job this year to join a youth service program that would allow him to explore a field
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:15.520]  he believes would be recession proof renewable energy you make a decent amount of money in sales
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:20.400]  but there's no longevity in a recession and walters 23 who gained experience with the
[1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:25.520]  renewable energy projects in the conservation corps of greater new orleans the group is
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:29.680]  dedicated to helping the city recover from 2005's devastating hurricane katrina see
[1:46:30.720 --> 1:46:35.360]  they give the federal money to whoever they want and then it's private groups so the private groups
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:40.560]  get the profits and fence the money back into the criminals hands that own these companies like
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:47.840]  take david gurgon he's got his hands in five different groups getting money and then the
[1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:54.080]  government can't have any oversight of regulation because they're private it's private armies it's
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:46:58.080]  mercenaries it goes on there's a lot of new construction going on here said walters his
[1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:02.480]  experience in the group earned him a full-time job with company installing solar thermal panels
[1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:07.200]  see it all sounds reasonable this is just their pr if you're going to change things new orleans
[1:47:07.200 --> 1:47:12.640]  is the place to do it and you might as well do it right with support from the core network
[1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:18.960]  the city of new orleans and a 5.8 million grant from the u.s labor department the new orleans corps
[1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:25.600]  has developed and helped put more than 800 people between the age of 1724 to work on projects
[1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:29.840]  involving environmental stewardship energy conservation and historic restoration this
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:37.200]  is the green core one division it goes on many participants come to the program from run-ins
[1:47:37.200 --> 1:47:41.840]  with the law some have spent time in jail the program requires participants to work four months
[1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:48.400]  with one of seven nonprofit groups at a hourly wage of 855 and gives americors college scholarships
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:53.360]  worth as much as a $1,250 to those who complete the program so they're hiring the criminals to
[1:47:53.360 --> 1:48:01.520]  fill their ranks and make it all sound reasonable and it plays 75 percent of the graduates with
[1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:06.480]  government employment afterwards it's the conversion from free market to parasite government
[1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:12.880]  parasite corporate government jobs owned by private interests but funded through government so they
[1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:20.080]  take from your business and give it to their environmental anti-gun cores now look i got
[1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:27.200]  another article here bloomberg obama's volunteers find health plan harder to sell than candidate
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:32.320]  and then it describes them going to door to door with gps marking whether you support obama or not
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:39.840]  in uniforms red and black uniforms knock knock knock answer my questions total intimidation
[1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:46.320]  their private army with government funding but patricia micardal volunteer for barack obama's
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:50.320]  presidential campaign her duties and goals were clear now she's devoting her time to his health care
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:54.960]  plan and says she's confused and frustrated that you're being suckered with a global corporate
[1:48:54.960 --> 1:49:01.120]  takeover obama who enlisted 13 million member grassroots army to help him win the white house
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:06.080]  is trying to remobilize these people to build support for his proposed overhaul the goal may
[1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:10.480]  prove elusive because they won't tell the idiots what they're pushing for it's just all part of
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:16.080]  intimidation to get people used to going around in uniforms to people's doors because i got
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:20.160]  video and news articles where they're trying to go after your guns folks they're just finding out
[1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:27.040]  who's mentally ill out of these groups and sifting out the demons to then be promoted the constituents
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:32.800]  the constituencies that joined forces to back obama the candidate disagreed over the scope of
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:36.640]  the health care overhaul particularly whether it should create a so-called singer payer system
[1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:41.920]  that reimburses providers through a government run fund and then it goes on to how they don't
[1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:47.200]  like knocking on doors and they aren't getting all the same love this is the government with a 13
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:54.160]  million man army they've been able to deploy a million of them and then they got the census
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:49:58.240]  coming and saying it's going to be a yearly census and a monthly census in gpsing you and
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:06.080]  ordering you to answer if you own guns on record this is what's going on this is what's happening
[1:50:06.080 --> 1:50:14.000]  this is what's developing i'm gonna say it again mainstream news is reporting total complete private
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:20.640]  corporate takeover with the federal reserve above government a new form of government

[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:52.560]  massively important issue the stratosphericly important issue it's just so huge that the
[1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:57.680]  mainstream media is announcing as i told you back in october 3rd october 4th or 5th i said they're
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:01.600]  going to bankrupt the economy rather than they're going to use the money they hoard to buy up banks
[1:57:01.600 --> 1:57:05.120]  and insurance companies and to buy off more government they're going to turn loose north
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:10.160]  com under the control of the federal reserve and a new bank of the world that will set interest rates
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:16.640]  that will set a currency rates and that will regulate taxes on a planetary scale and control
[1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:21.600]  every major corporation and business through regulations and now they've openly announced
[1:57:21.600 --> 1:57:28.320]  and it's even worse than i thought the legislation racing through right now about to pass and the
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:32.000]  white house says they don't care they're going to do it by executive order even if it doesn't
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:38.960]  says anything they want in everything just total and absolute domination of the complete society

[2:02:26.960 --> 2:02:34.000]  audio streams at shoutcast number one radio talk show and uh routinely number one total even over
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:39.680]  music and that is only a fraction of our streams that actually show up on that as well a lot of them
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:45.760]  we have flash streams and window streams and other things that don't show up at shoutcast dot com
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:51.280]  and and by being number one in the writings on flycast and on shoutcast and being very high up
[2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:57.040]  on twitter by doing all of this new people that are perusing the front pages find us see i don't
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:04.000]  care about being number one on youtube and google just so i can say i'm number one that all my films
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:08.240]  turn out to be number one for a week a month or off and on year after year they're number one
[2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:13.920]  it's important to be number one because people go and do their viewing on google video and youtube
[2:03:13.920 --> 2:03:19.280]  and other big video sites off the main page what's number one now the problem was patreon
[2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:25.200]  videos anti new world order videos were basically always number one on youtube and google so google
[2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:28.560]  has gotten rid of google video the old videos are there but they said they're about to get rid of
[2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:33.520]  those two just flush millions of them out uh but they first wouldn't let you see the numbers and
[2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:37.520]  wouldn't let you know uh what the numbers were unless you'd uploaded it yourself you know i'd
[2:03:37.520 --> 2:03:41.840]  see our video and say oh look fabled enemies five million views but the public couldn't see that
[2:03:41.840 --> 2:03:46.880]  we did screenshots of course in the control panel now they don't let us upload now they're just
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:52.880]  completely getting rid of it youtube you know 15 million views uh on youtube and other channels
[2:03:52.880 --> 2:03:58.640]  we can count up for the obama deception and i haven't counted it up in a month being number one
[2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:04.080]  means all those new people see that so what's youtube doing they're taking the number one
[2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:09.840]  videos off the front page and saying popular and what's popular atheism cps grabbing kids
[2:04:09.840 --> 2:04:13.600]  and saying it's good and if you want to be an atheist that's your issue but you shouldn't cheat
[2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:18.160]  and have youtube say you're most popular when you're not they'll put the amazing atheist up
[2:04:18.160 --> 2:04:22.640]  when he's got a hundred views and at the end of the day is 300 000 we could have five million
[2:04:22.640 --> 2:04:27.760]  views on a video they never put it on the front page and and we approached youtube about the
[2:04:27.760 --> 2:04:32.960]  partner thing to put ads on it so we could maybe funder operation and they said no we don't want
[2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:36.720]  you as a partner so see there's all this discrimination like i have to wear a big yellow
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:42.720]  star at youtube i'm evil i'm bad you know it's like i'm in a nazi germany at youtube with them
[2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:47.600]  cheating us and shutting us down and revoking us and i've got to go to federal court and file

[2:08:45.920 --> 2:08:54.400]  feeds here that i'm having trouble pulling up my call list from minnesota is it is that matt
[2:08:54.400 --> 2:09:00.160]  scott steven steven others okay great all right we're gonna go ahead and go to your calls right now
[2:09:00.160 --> 2:09:09.600]  now and then i'm going to get into the controlled economy that we are going into here in this society
[2:09:10.320 --> 2:09:16.240]  and more on the fema camps more on this whole control grid that is unfolding right now let's
[2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:22.160]  go ahead and go to your calls matt in the uk matt you're on the air welcome hi alex and greetings
[2:09:22.160 --> 2:09:27.680]  from the uk here just i'll give you listeners and yourself a bit of news in the uk uh what the
[2:09:27.680 --> 2:09:32.880]  government's proposing in this country regarding um internet too as you mentioned quite a few months
[2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:36.960]  ago what they want to do is let's say see every family with a telephone line could be hit with a
[2:09:36.960 --> 2:09:42.000]  six pound a year tax to pay for the rollout of superfast broadband the government said yesterday
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:48.800]  uh what's your take on that well i'm looking at articles from all over the country uh one state's
[2:09:48.800 --> 2:09:56.000]  proposing a 16 high con the state income tax another state 20 another state 30 other states
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:10:04.320]  are announcing doubling of different fines and fees uh so as the economy implodes we will pay
[2:10:04.320 --> 2:10:09.920]  more and more taxes because it's all going to be interest to the bankers instead of even the
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:14.320]  government services and i guess in a way that's kind of a good thing because as everything goes
[2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:19.680]  to interest to the bankers they won't have as much money for cps to kidnap kids and police to taser
[2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:25.040]  people but if you actually look at things there's they're actually increasing the funding for tasering
[2:10:25.040 --> 2:10:33.440]  and fema camps and cps grabbing kids it's just that schools and roads and uh infrastructure is
[2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:39.280]  imploding so yeah they're going to run everybody to ground they are going to bankrupt everybody
[2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:44.080]  and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze until you can't afford to pay for yourself much less
[2:10:44.080 --> 2:10:49.360]  children because the club of rome the eugenesis the un have shut on record they want to bankrupt
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:54.720]  the world economy so everybody's so poor you can't afford to have children and so the government
[2:10:54.720 --> 2:10:59.280]  can come in and get you on welfare but then dictate since you're on a government paycheck
[2:10:59.280 --> 2:11:03.360]  that you can't have children this is a key attack they're launching right now
[2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:11.680]  yeah that they're also saying um some top medical scientists said on the on the british news uh i
[2:11:11.680 --> 2:11:17.200]  think the last week said um if you do not um vaccinate your child and basically that they
[2:11:17.200 --> 2:11:21.840]  will not be allowed in the schools is that happening exactly the same thing in australia
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:25.600]  canada the u.s all the same globalist running it they're saying they're going to make a mass
[2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:31.680]  inoculation centers and force kids now to take flu shots three times a year now you can pull up
[2:11:31.680 --> 2:11:36.800]  the studies three flu shots doubles your chances of all timers just like you mentioned doubling
[2:11:36.800 --> 2:11:42.720]  cell phone taxes or 50 increase in england the same thing was announced here uh jaren in there
[2:11:42.720 --> 2:11:49.360]  pulled it up in like 10 seconds irs moles increasing cell phone taxes in us you know obama
[2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:55.840]  promised no new taxes except on people making over 125 000 a year that's per person couples
[2:11:55.840 --> 2:12:02.800]  250 and he's raising dozens of new taxes google for everybody on screen right now through uh flu
[2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:09.920]  shots three flu shots doubles all timers and the government admits it absolute fact and
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:14.640]  that's why you got 25 30 year olds getting all timers now but they take their shot every year
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:19.200]  and they they lose their mind and they forget who they are then they they quit breathing and they
[2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:24.560]  die and eugenics has served and they're good citizens and uh yes they're announcing forced
[2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:29.920]  inoculations flu shots saying martial laws good on the news they're just throwing it in the slaves
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:35.520]  face there's no end matt i appreciate your call the nightmare won't end until we wake up and say no
[2:12:35.520 --> 2:12:40.960]  scott in california scott you're on the air yeah hey alex i want to get your take on this operation
[2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:46.800]  blackjack that's been on the telegraph uh u k website yes we wrote three part series at uh
[2:12:47.440 --> 2:12:54.000]  info wars dot net by steve watson and in operation blackjack the government starts staging terror
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:59.680]  attacks and blaming it all al qaeda that leads into nuke attacks and world government and then
[2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:03.680]  in the end the world government wins for your own good and they won't even say who did it or
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:09.760]  why they wrote it and in operation blackjack on the 22nd of june terror attacks are launched
[2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:15.360]  i usually don't go off things that set dates but and then you make your point i want to
[2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:22.880]  just fill people in but remember the fox tv show lone gunman uh spin off from x files
[2:13:23.440 --> 2:13:28.560]  where six months before 9 11 they run an episode of a hijack jet being flown on the world trade
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:35.600]  center it's hijacked by remote control blamed on al qaeda in afghanistan run by a group in the
[2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:42.880]  government and they use a drill a war game drill to make norad stand down now exactly that was done
[2:13:42.880 --> 2:13:49.440]  six months later then doesn't stop there dean hagglin of the star of the show shows up at my
[2:13:49.440 --> 2:13:57.600]  door the star of the show knock knock dean hagglin is at my door and says the cia planted these
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:04.400]  stories on us what do you make of them apples well i think it's very suspicious and i think
[2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:09.040]  that those prime editions of 9 11 certainly are you know relevant here and in addition to that i
[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:13.520]  just noticed this morning on our prison planet there's a story that talks about there's a there's
[2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:18.480]  a number that's in the slideshow of operation blackjack on the id card for the north american union
[2:14:18.480 --> 2:14:22.480]  and on the story that's on prison planet someone's taken that number and put it into what's called
[2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:26.640]  a hexadecimal to string converter taking that interpreting it as a hexadecimal computer number
[2:14:26.640 --> 2:14:31.840]  and then it converted into actual words and what that translates to uh even though the site claims
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:37.520]  that this is a fictitious story uh what that translates to is this is not simply entertainment
[2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:43.040]  so that's what the numbers on there convert to you when you're saying that were you saying that
[2:14:44.080 --> 2:14:50.240]  is posted that's on prison planet that's by the author's remix world wednesday june 17th right
[2:14:50.240 --> 2:14:54.800]  was this morning just this morning okay good i missed that report that's up on prison planet
[2:14:54.800 --> 2:15:00.960]  dot com right now that's right good we have a new area for our great listeners who many of you are
[2:15:00.960 --> 2:15:07.760]  a lot smarter than i am to write articles to point out bills uh last friday i was up here doing the
[2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:11.920]  show at night and the caller called in and said if you've seen this bill where the government can
[2:15:11.920 --> 2:15:16.480]  kidnap your kids with no warrant federally there was another bill they called in and i saw the bill
[2:15:16.480 --> 2:15:21.520]  read the bill number and then lost the number and and said can somebody write an article i mean
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:26.880]  so much evil is happening we can't even keep track of it it's writers at info wars dot com
[2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:33.920]  submit articles that you want us to post and we will post them original articles analysis blurbs
[2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:39.920]  writers at info wars dot com and we will start getting those up thank you so much anything else
[2:15:39.920 --> 2:15:45.040]  sir uh well two more things just to point out in relation to this uh over the uh this weekend
[2:15:45.040 --> 2:15:51.120]  there's this uh north com ardent century oh nine happening to the north com takeover drill and
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:56.160]  homeland security admits with foreign governments aiding the united states when we're under terror
[2:15:56.160 --> 2:16:01.920]  attack so open foreign troop drill and i videotaped these in the real world this is a cyberspace
[2:16:02.560 --> 2:16:06.080]  practicing with the e you taking over the united states and that's how nice
[2:16:07.680 --> 2:16:10.880]  yeah and it's on the same date that this is supposed to you know according to the fictitious
[2:16:10.880 --> 2:16:15.520]  comic strip you know supposed to happen that along with uh last weekend in new york there was
[2:16:15.520 --> 2:16:21.440]  an operation called new york you have a problem where there were uh nypd and fbi doing drills for
[2:16:21.440 --> 2:16:26.640]  nuke uh nukes in new york and if you're one of the us you'll you'll see in the paper explosion
[2:16:26.640 --> 2:16:30.240]  we're seeing if it was terrorist and then a day later they'll say oh it was just a drill where
[2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:35.040]  they blow up a real car they're doing that to make the police feel like the terror threat's real
[2:16:35.040 --> 2:16:39.680]  and so the public sees bombs going off you know up by wake oh they did one they're doing them in
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:44.880]  san antonio chicago people are like what happened i don't know in the day or two later they mentioned
[2:16:44.880 --> 2:16:50.080]  the back of the paper oh it was a drill but then the rumors all start to terrorist are hitting
[2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:55.360]  word to word and that creates the fear so they're even giving us simulated terror attacks to make a
[2:16:55.360 --> 2:17:00.400]  submit which i guess is a lot nicer than them staging the terror attacks of 9 11 again
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:06.800]  yeah so it's your take on this that's more just like a sci-op or a uh something you never know i
[2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:15.360]  mean i mean why did governor frank keating why did his brother published a year before
[2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:23.680]  or oklahoma city bombing publish your book called american jihad and in it a tim mcvay
[2:17:23.680 --> 2:17:29.840]  bombs the alfred p murray building and then he dedicates the book to the knights of the secret
[2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:34.240]  circle do you know what the knights of the secret circle are in in in mainline research
[2:17:35.280 --> 2:17:40.320]  no i don't know that one knights of the secret circle is knights of the golden circle it's high
[2:17:40.320 --> 2:17:47.680]  level masons or kuklaks clan well so he dedicates it to the to the kuklaks clan and and then i mean
[2:17:47.680 --> 2:17:52.960]  you know you you can't make this stuff up no it just seems like there's just so much premonition
[2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:57.040]  of all these different events it's just very i mean it's very very scary it's the enjoyment
[2:17:57.040 --> 2:18:00.880]  of throwing it in our face i appreciate your call yeah i should talk more about these drills
[2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:06.480]  and talking about them can can can stop them from carrying out the next drill
[2:18:06.480 --> 2:18:14.240]  so that's always uh important and and and we have discussed that we have posted articles
[2:18:14.240 --> 2:18:19.600]  at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and they the establishment the criminals
[2:18:19.600 --> 2:18:23.840]  are going to have the stage terror attacks to get their neural water in they need to stage
[2:18:23.840 --> 2:18:28.080]  terror attacks so they can lock down the people saying they're doing it for your protection
[2:18:28.080 --> 2:18:35.440]  you guys are looking up hexadecimal mathematics did you look up flu shot all simers connection
[2:18:37.040 --> 2:18:38.800]  maybe i missed it but i'm gonna put that on screen
[2:18:41.200 --> 2:18:45.760]  study children who get flu vaccine have three times the risk of hospitalization for flu
[2:18:45.760 --> 2:18:52.880]  that was out of the mayo clinic and john hopkins no no no not how it kills the kids parents have
[2:18:52.880 --> 2:18:56.720]  got to experience that for themselves that's kind of how we get our patriot movement is the people
[2:18:56.720 --> 2:19:00.000]  the the enemies hurt i try to warn them but if they want to go ahead and hurt their kids that's
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:06.160]  their business i want to find the one about three flu shots doubles all simers flu shots three times
[2:19:06.160 --> 2:19:16.080]  we're likely to get all simers just do uh just do for people um just say flu shot all simers
[2:19:17.040 --> 2:19:22.960]  and then big reports it's an absolute fact because they put five times the mercury in
[2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:27.520]  flu shots they do in the regular shots and now they're saying they're going to make school kids
[2:19:27.520 --> 2:19:32.960]  take them three times a year i mean the kids won't be able to talk soon the portable things and
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:38.720]  if you don't do it the slot team's there i'll never forget in um maryland they had police dogs
[2:19:38.720 --> 2:19:43.440]  and thousands of kids crying going i don't want it and the judge going it's the law take it and i had
[2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:48.000]  the state attorney on who was forcing everybody he goes i don't make my kids take it for laughing

[2:26:54.480 --> 2:27:00.320]  exactly exactly and you know there's uh facts the gore i mean they you know they have it on
[2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:06.480]  their sites of buildings that literally burnt for days and uh they're still standing uh you know
[2:27:06.480 --> 2:27:10.640]  when those buildings falling you know faster than freefall i mean that should be a big red
[2:27:10.640 --> 2:27:15.840]  flag but people just don't want to hear it and then when you throw in firefighters for 911truth
[2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:20.400]  that that really grabs the attention of people i've been surprised i mean there's been people
[2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:24.000]  i've talked to in the past that just didn't want to hear about it and then i mentioned
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:29.040]  firefighters for 911truth and all of a sudden they're interested so that seems to be a good
[2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:37.200]  avenue on waking people up absolutely it certainly is anything else sir yeah uh you were talking
[2:27:37.200 --> 2:27:41.280]  about the vaccines and how they're going to make it mandatory and i tell you one interesting
[2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:47.120]  fact on the vaccine because if you look into nano technology and the uh the capabilities they have
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:55.280]  these days of uh inserting nano sized chips so that could be uh what's to come well absolutely
[2:27:55.280 --> 2:28:00.240]  i agree with you and i appreciate your call uh actually we already have nano tech
[2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:07.760]  along the lines of incredible journey where they shrink the the little submarine down to the
[2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:15.600]  you know tiny size of a grain of sand and inject it into the body no but most nano tech is going
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:21.760]  along the lines of biological now where they program biological systems i mean what are bacteria
[2:28:21.760 --> 2:28:28.720]  they start dividing they multiply that's a form of nano tech a self replicating micro machine
[2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:35.760]  it's just a biological machine so there's a whole class several classes of vaccines
[2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:41.760]  we've had medical doctors and virologists and epidemiologists don't want to talk about this
[2:28:41.760 --> 2:28:47.680]  there's whole classes of vaccines that quote cure these are the new high tech vaccines cure drug
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:55.680]  addiction and you can google a story like new vaccine to cure cocaine addiction or to cure smoking
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:29:02.400]  and what they say these do is they go in and create plaques viruses live viruses go in and
[2:29:02.400 --> 2:29:08.400]  some of these drugs and attack the brain and actually create a type of lobotomy a lobotomy is
[2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:14.800]  just doing surgery to change the makeup of the brain and they go in and they create plaques at the
[2:29:14.800 --> 2:29:23.600]  neuro receptor sites in the neurons of the brain in the electrochemical areas and then the body can't
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:30.400]  pass the drugs on the cocaine the heroin the nicotine but also your regular endorphins that
[2:29:30.400 --> 2:29:36.960]  your body creates naturally can't get there so yes they have viruses that they could program
[2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:42.400]  to go in and do whatever they want to your brain that means kill you make you a vegetable
[2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:47.680]  making blind make you not be able to enjoy a cigarette make you not be able to taste the
[2:29:47.680 --> 2:29:54.160]  taste of chocolate they can program to do whatever they want we're on the march the empires on the

[2:37:20.960 --> 2:37:26.720]  callin in texas callin you're on the air welcome thank you so much elix we love you for speaking
[2:37:26.720 --> 2:37:32.800]  the truth um the reason i'm calling is i've been a diabetic for 17 years and i now realize they're
[2:37:32.800 --> 2:37:39.280]  putting medic resol in the insulin as a preservative it's a known carcinogenic it causes renal failure
[2:37:39.920 --> 2:37:44.960]  it kills your lungs your liver texture central nervous system and it equals almost half the
[2:37:44.960 --> 2:37:50.160]  amount of the insulin who makes the product elie lily who also makes prozac and methadone
[2:37:50.720 --> 2:37:55.680]  but uh i was scared to speak out because i'm a legal immigrant to this country from canada
[2:37:55.680 --> 2:37:59.440]  and i was worried about my family and the repercussions of it but they just given all
[2:37:59.440 --> 2:38:04.640]  diabetics a death sentence with this product so what do you thought i don't know what to do well
[2:38:04.640 --> 2:38:11.040]  i don't specifically know the details of that particular additive to the drug you were talking
[2:38:11.040 --> 2:38:16.080]  about but i do know that bayer pharmaceutical knowingly shipped out over a million dosages of
[2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:23.280]  factor eight a blood drug knowing it would kill every hemophiliac uh and and person that took it
[2:38:23.280 --> 2:38:28.160]  and then that came out in court documents msnbc's reported even that they knowingly shipped it out
[2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:33.040]  knowing it would kill the people i know that murk who made vioxx they knew was going to kill people
[2:38:33.040 --> 2:38:40.160]  knew that the gartersill hpv shot for girls uh was going to kill and maim a lot of people because
[2:38:40.160 --> 2:38:44.800]  their own trial showed that and now we have the headlines out of the australian newspapers
[2:38:44.800 --> 2:38:50.880]  and the us papers murk planned to send out hit teams quote to where they live and liquidate
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:58.960]  doctors and scientists that expose them ie kill i covered that last uh last monday so uh yes big
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:05.520]  pharma is eugenicist and eugenicists are the same folks with the black men and syphilis tiskegee
[2:39:05.520 --> 2:39:11.440]  the radiation of the foster kids in the 40s and 50s and 60s that is all just intensified the un has

[2:39:21.680 --> 2:39:26.320]  that they want imf and world bank loans to have one child policies and to sterilize their women
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:31.840]  this is real and the un's been caught in africa and india adding female hormones to tetanus
[2:39:31.840 --> 2:39:36.480]  shots that cause an autoimmune response to the hormone release thus sterilizing the women violently
[2:39:37.200 --> 2:39:41.360]  that is they have miscarriages each time so it effectively is a sterilization
[2:39:41.360 --> 2:39:48.160]  uh so yes we know that through big pharma and through the water supplies that this is being
[2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:54.400]  done to us uh we know that all of this is unfolding we know all of this is happening
[2:39:55.040 --> 2:40:01.040]  and we just have to have the will to face up to what's going on uh and uh under socialized
[2:40:01.040 --> 2:40:05.680]  health care and government corporate kind of monopoly capitalism health care they're going
[2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:10.800]  to call it socialist they will force you to take the drugs and the products they want
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:15.440]  and they are going to medicalize vitamins and minerals already doing it making fish oil now

[2:43:48.800 --> 2:43:53.200]  all the glands all the organs the brain has a calming and brain damaging effect
[2:43:56.080 --> 2:44:01.040]  look i'm going for hours here with you i mean if you care about your kids quit showering and
[2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:06.800]  fluoride water quit drinking it but i know you can't you're so brain damaged by it i am too i've
[2:44:06.800 --> 2:44:11.280]  been hit and hit hard that you're almost unable to respond let me think of some other ones to
[2:44:11.280 --> 2:44:18.880]  pull up for people um vaccines linked to diabetes and you know why vaccines are linked to diabetes
[2:44:18.880 --> 2:44:23.280]  because they cause an autoimmune response that's why they cause brain damage it isn't just the
[2:44:23.280 --> 2:44:27.200]  mercury the brain swells up the baby gets bleeding on the brain sometimes they have a
[2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:30.960]  convulsion in the hospital so the parents don't get in trouble but if they have it in the car or
[2:44:30.960 --> 2:44:37.440]  normally overnight mama comes in and the 18 month old is just like a zombie now you go to the
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:41.680]  hospital and they call in the police and take you to jail for hurting the baby because the
[2:44:41.680 --> 2:44:46.240]  CAT scan shows blood on the brain now the diabolical bastards that do this the doctor doesn't know
[2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:50.080]  he's compartmentalized they know it's even better because then they get even more federal funds with
[2:44:50.080 --> 2:44:56.080]  cps grabbing a special needs brain damage kid then they run up the money drugging the kid out
[2:44:56.080 --> 2:45:00.400]  until they normally die by age 15 now they kill all the foster kids with over drugging they'll get
[2:45:00.400 --> 2:45:06.640]  them on 20 30 40 drugs sometimes oh i can show that to you right now wai investigation uh let me
[2:45:06.640 --> 2:45:13.760]  see vaccine dangers linked between diabetes that's the nccn let's go ahead and click on that there's
[2:45:13.760 --> 2:45:21.760]  web md go ahead childhood vaccinations juvenile onset and it's got all these medical doctors phd
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:26.160]  reports you can read that for yourself right there medical reports oh let me think i can just
[2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:32.400]  sit or just keep throwing it at you these this isn't done by accident this is scientific soft kill
[2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:42.640]  silent weapons for quiet wars done by design period and so that's how they operate that's
[2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:50.320]  how they do this and so we'll uh go over some more of that but but but let's continue right now with

[2:53:02.880 --> 2:53:08.400]  it's being reported that cyber spies from russia and china have now penetrated our power grid
[2:53:08.400 --> 2:53:13.040]  even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits
[2:53:13.040 --> 2:53:18.000]  of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:23.840]  push the grid over its edge creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting us all
[2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:29.280]  in the dark are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages or government created
[2:53:29.280 --> 2:53:34.400]  blackouts have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own
[2:53:34.400 --> 2:53:39.600]  private supply of electrical power if so this will be the most important information you have
[2:53:39.600 --> 2:53:45.040]  ever heard solar powered generators are finally available they have no moving parts to wear out
[2:53:45.040 --> 2:53:51.680]  or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever remember the government doesn't own the sun so
[2:53:51.680 --> 2:54:09.040]  go to my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com check out my solar backup dot com
[2:54:09.040 --> 2:54:11.040]  oh
[2:54:28.800 --> 2:54:33.280]  ah it gets distracting when you got film crews in your studio but it's always fun
[2:54:33.280 --> 2:54:43.040]  okay here's this regular physiology this is called the reptilian complex of the brain
[2:54:43.040 --> 2:54:47.920]  that's what they teach in medical school it's called the reptilian brain and you get the limbic
[2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:55.040]  system in the neocortex and then out here you got the brain stem and what what it hooks into
[2:54:55.040 --> 2:55:01.520]  and this is the area over the heart beating well i guess people can't see me on tv pointing it out
[2:55:01.520 --> 2:55:06.640]  pull me up on screen and i'll show folks see right here you got the reptilian brain limbic system
[2:55:07.280 --> 2:55:12.880]  neocortex and then down here you've got what the brain stem hooks into the lower brain and this
[2:55:12.880 --> 2:55:17.840]  is your heart rate and breathing and your blood pressure and all that type of stuff is regulated
[2:55:17.840 --> 2:55:25.040]  here and this is the primitive area of the brain which is identical in this physiology to a crocodile
[2:55:25.040 --> 2:55:30.320]  brain or an alligator brain and that was my point people thought i was endorsing what david says
[2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:35.120]  about other issues which i'm not poo pooing what he says i just don't have any proof of it don't
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:39.760]  cover it and people got confused when i was saying that but go ahead and finish up what you were
[2:55:39.760 --> 2:55:45.360]  saying caller i just see if that's uh after you were in waking life if you ever looked into lucid
[2:55:45.360 --> 2:55:50.880]  dreaming or had ever experienced it yourself it seems to me like it might be uh kind of like a
[2:55:50.880 --> 2:55:58.080]  further step in our evolution of thought as well let's just put it this way i keep my visions to
[2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:04.560]  myself how's that uh fleetwood maxon goes oh here they come again the crystal vision
[2:56:05.280 --> 2:56:10.560]  i keep my vision to myself i mean yeah i've i've obviously had a lot of wild dreams
[2:56:11.360 --> 2:56:18.080]  uh most people have when i was a kid i slept walk some and that's just between the waking and
[2:56:18.080 --> 2:56:25.360]  the sleeping uh area and i've had a lot of dreams that have come true you always know it's a dream
[2:56:25.360 --> 2:56:30.560]  that's very intense very upsetting it's like you've been somewhere else and it could be something like
[2:56:31.280 --> 2:56:35.760]  a house being built on a hill and you image the house and you have dream after dream where you're
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:41.200]  in the house and this is a dream i have and i was like nine and then years later i'd always remember
[2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:46.800]  the dream i see him building that very house on the hill and it didn't click i was like why is that
[2:56:46.800 --> 2:56:50.640]  house so interesting to me and then later that night i was in there with a girlfriend in the
[2:56:50.640 --> 2:56:55.360]  neighborhood and i'm looking out the windows that hadn't been finished yet out on to the
[2:56:56.640 --> 2:57:01.600]  you know hills and woods and have the realization wow i've had this dream so many times and then
[2:57:01.600 --> 2:57:06.240]  remembered the full dream and it wasn't deja vu it was because i'd remembered it it was like i had a
[2:57:06.240 --> 2:57:13.840]  dream one time that a guy in a green and purple shirt um came out from behind a building a cinder
[2:57:13.840 --> 2:57:18.000]  block building and attacked me and i even told people about it because it was an upsetting dream
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:25.040]  and then sure enough about a year later i'm 16 we had to drive it to Dallas to buy beer because
[2:57:25.040 --> 2:57:29.440]  the big beer stores there would sell to underage people when i pull up get out of the car my
[2:57:29.440 --> 2:57:35.120]  buddies are parked around the back of the gas station i'm walking with a case of beer and from
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:40.800]  behind it's like i went back into the dream as i was walking see the cinder block i go i've had
[2:57:40.800 --> 2:57:45.360]  i've seen this before here comes the guy in the green and purple polo shirt and tries to mug me
[2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:55.680]  and then i'll um dealt with it enjoyably of course but the issue is the issue is that uh i have had
[2:57:55.680 --> 2:57:59.360]  dreams that have come true but i don't really get into it on air and make a big issue out of it
[2:57:59.360 --> 2:58:03.680]  because you know it kind of gets off into the hinterland i have bills i have legislation for
[2:58:03.680 --> 2:58:12.320]  martial law i i know this is going on i know this is happening and so i have the black and white
[2:58:12.320 --> 2:58:18.320]  so i cover what i can prove does that answer your question yeah yeah sure good to hear from you my
[2:58:18.320 --> 2:58:25.040]  friend yes i am in the film waking life because rickland collector lives in town as a fan of the

[2:58:55.760 --> 2:59:00.400]  this summer number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:59:00.400 --> 2:59:05.680]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[2:59:05.680 --> 2:59:10.800]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:59:10.800 --> 2:59:15.680]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:59:15.680 --> 2:59:19.760]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous
[2:59:19.760 --> 2:59:23.920]  summer storm season is here again every year thousands of families lose their power from
[2:59:23.920 --> 2:59:29.040]  weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and

[3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:09.760]  good to be here okay tell me about this film life on the edge of der bubble uh this is um
[3:02:10.560 --> 3:02:14.800]  you know there's there's so many films out there on the federal reserve and on money and uh all
[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:19.040]  the various aspects of the economy we wanted to make one that was a little bit different
[3:02:19.040 --> 3:02:24.480]  we want to follow that same pattern and we wanted to show uh americans that this is really nothing
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:30.400]  new at all uh starting in um like the year after we signed the constitution we had our first bubble
[3:02:30.400 --> 3:02:42.080]  we had one in 1819 um 1837 1857 1873 1893 speculative bubbles literally almost every 20 years
[3:02:42.080 --> 3:02:47.120]  and and yeah they were all speculative bubbles based on some type of overuse of credit and i mean
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:52.560]  this is nothing new to the american economy it's just that for whatever reason the federal reserve
[3:02:52.560 --> 3:03:00.240]  when it was introduced managed to be able to allow the bubbles to grow larger and larger and larger
[3:03:00.240 --> 3:03:05.120]  instead of having a pop every 20 years and having a a small bubble pop now we've got a 75 year bubble
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:09.760]  that's popping and it's global well exactly i was going to expand it was the same money
[3:03:09.760 --> 3:03:14.080]  changers out of england and europe that ran these scams that created these fiat bubbles and the film
[3:03:14.080 --> 3:03:19.520]  covers that in an excellent fashion who now are in control of the whole planet and instead of it
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:24.720]  being limited bubbles of certain financial sectors before and we were an agrarian to society and
[3:03:24.720 --> 3:03:30.720]  people didn't care because it was so limited now these bubbles are are literally have the power
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:38.400]  of a tsunami of fiat money to destroy entire societies yeah exactly you know um i don't think
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:44.160]  many people look at it from this perspective but uh you know we we tend to want to blame the federal
[3:03:44.160 --> 3:03:49.600]  reserve and the people who issue the credit and uh you know all the people that are kind of at the
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:54.880]  top of the bubble shall we say and we kind of forget that all of us participate in some degree
[3:03:54.880 --> 3:04:00.320]  to helping build these bubbles um whether we're flipping houses and participating to that degree
[3:04:00.320 --> 3:04:04.080]  are just taking out a bank loan so that we can you know take the equity out of our home and cash it
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:08.640]  in and maybe fix up our home and all these are things that allows the bubble to grow and it
[3:04:08.640 --> 3:04:13.360]  allows us as americans to live beyond our means in other words if you only make thirty thousand
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:17.600]  dollars a year shouldn't you only spend thirty thousand dollars a year if you spend fifty thousand
[3:04:17.600 --> 3:04:22.480]  or sixty thousand a dollars a year consecutively year after year after year we're making a bubble
[3:04:22.480 --> 3:04:28.800]  so like a drug dealer they're getting us addicted and strung out uh towards we're totally under
[3:04:28.800 --> 3:04:34.880]  their control and they made the drug the credit out of nothing exactly and this is uh one of the
[3:04:34.880 --> 3:04:40.000]  issues that i'd like to cover uh and tell people uh the the federal reserve that we have now is
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:44.720]  actually the third national bank that's the third federal yeah this is an incredible history lesson

[3:08:12.560 --> 3:08:33.440]  okay life on the edge of a bubble blowing the american dream let's zoom in on this with
[3:08:33.440 --> 3:08:39.120]  alan greenspan on the cover and yes they say you can't judge a film or book by its cover
[3:08:39.120 --> 3:08:46.640]  cover well you can this one great cover great film and why don't you again start describing
[3:08:46.640 --> 3:08:55.440]  the film and we're gonna put the trailer coming up in a few minutes and then break down four people
[3:08:56.960 --> 3:09:01.840]  who are out there listening the point we're making about these different bubbles we've
[3:09:01.840 --> 3:09:06.960]  had in the past versus these new mega bubbles all right well i mean the easiest way for me
[3:09:06.960 --> 3:09:13.440]  to sum up exactly what the film is about is just to use an analogy and that is if you give a if
[3:09:13.440 --> 3:09:18.400]  you give an umpire a thousand dollars before he makes the play what do you call that you call
[3:09:18.400 --> 3:09:23.600]  that a bribe yes if you give a thousand dollars to a judge right before he renders his verdict
[3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:28.400]  what do you call that you call it a bribe not anymore they call it here in texas they openly
[3:09:28.400 --> 3:09:33.920]  take the money stolen from the people well i would call it a bribe and i think most people would
[3:09:33.920 --> 3:09:42.000]  and they call it law enforcement boy some kind of al-qaeda the point is is that my next example
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:46.720]  here is if you give a thousand dollars to a politician right before he you know votes on
[3:09:46.720 --> 3:09:50.560]  your bill what do you call that it's not called a bribe they call that a campaign contribution
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:56.880]  and i think that's what you're getting at um it's just become absolutely acceptable for the uh you
[3:09:56.880 --> 3:10:03.200]  know the the people in washington who are trying to leech off of and persuade others to vote on
[3:10:03.200 --> 3:10:07.680]  their particular legislation whoever they work for whatever the lobby is whatever the situation
[3:10:07.680 --> 3:10:11.200]  and we cover that we address that quite a bit in the documentary because you know how can you
[3:10:11.200 --> 3:10:16.880]  possibly have a representative in office who truly represents the people if his campaign cost him
[3:10:16.880 --> 3:10:21.200]  six point five million dollars on average to get reelected you didn't contribute any of that money
[3:10:21.200 --> 3:10:24.720]  to his financial campaign you can't even get in there to talk to the senator unless you've
[3:10:24.720 --> 3:10:29.200]  contributed offshore corporations did yeah exactly so you know these are the people that are
[3:10:29.200 --> 3:10:34.960]  presenting us with the problem and it's the corporations that really started out as you
[3:10:34.960 --> 3:10:40.640]  see in the beginning of the film about 200 or so years ago with alexander hamilton who was our
[3:10:40.640 --> 3:10:47.360]  first secretary of the treasury he decided that we needed to have a corporate system in the united
[3:10:47.360 --> 3:10:52.560]  states for the banking and and i forget exactly what they call it it's the you know the corporate
[3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:59.840]  uh was it called don't don't get me to like watch the movie but um the point is is that
[3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:04.320]  alexander hamilton our our secretary of the treasury the guy who appears on the ten dollar bill
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:10.560]  is responsible for setting up banking corporations in the united states for the purpose of keeping
[3:11:10.560 --> 3:11:14.640]  all of this money that is created through the generation of credit and issuance of credit
[3:11:14.640 --> 3:11:20.240]  in private hands take all that money out of private hands imagine at the peak of our bubble
[3:11:20.240 --> 3:11:25.440]  we were borrowing a billion dollars a day a billion dollars a day from foreign investors
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:34.160]  to feed our credit habit all right the money that was being made on top of the credit the
[3:11:34.720 --> 3:11:39.120]  interest that's paid back if we were to simply funnel that back into the treasury back into
[3:11:39.120 --> 3:11:43.920]  our hands the people's hands who belongs to in the first place i don't think you'd see anybody
[3:11:43.920 --> 3:11:49.680]  paying taxes you surely wouldn't see a federal deficit i mean absolutely this fiat money fractional
[3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:54.560]  reserve system a lot of economists have argued that was done right would actually empower the
[3:11:54.560 --> 3:11:58.880]  people the problem is it's always going to be abused it's always going to be used and
[3:12:00.080 --> 3:12:04.960]  the trade deficit alone is hundreds of billions of dollars a month now and that's another form
[3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:11.360]  of fractional reserve manipulation and that goes into the whole neo mercantile model but please
[3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:17.280]  continue so i think everybody gets the example there where we're talking about between a bribe
[3:12:17.280 --> 3:12:23.680]  and a financial contribution and now they've stolen trillions of dollars and they're going
[3:12:23.680 --> 3:12:29.120]  to keep doing it and the the purpose of this film is to bring all of these issues to light right
[3:12:29.120 --> 3:12:34.480]  now because it is right at this moment when people can see the mask coming off of this monster
[3:12:34.480 --> 3:12:39.040]  that they will rise up and take action it's not when they see their gun rights disappearing it's
[3:12:39.040 --> 3:12:42.640]  not when they see their first amendment rights disappearing it's when they're affected by money
[3:12:42.640 --> 3:12:47.360]  their pocketbooks all right so i think that this is a perfect opportunity for us to jump in there
[3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:51.280]  and get people motivated to take some action to make these changes that we're talking about
[3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:55.920]  well that's what ron paul keeps saying and what i keep saying is that the bankers are going to use
[3:12:56.480 --> 3:13:01.360]  the crisis they've engineered on record to bring in even more power and control for themselves
[3:13:01.360 --> 3:13:07.280]  as they're doing right now so we are forced to point out they're the architects of all of this
[3:13:07.280 --> 3:13:12.160]  and hopefully use the crisis to kick them out of power instead of them getting more power
[3:13:12.160 --> 3:13:15.920]  it's not like they're just going to get away with this they are going for broke now
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:21.040]  because they know they've committed so many crimes already uh that this has got to be the mother of
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:26.800]  all corruptions that and and so there's nothing they won't do they are committed to their cause
[3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:31.520]  they have pledged their names their honor their money their treasure their blood their sweat their
[3:13:31.520 --> 3:13:37.280]  souls on this their lack of honor absolutely and then meanwhile the public's drinking beer still
[3:13:37.280 --> 3:13:43.040]  watching the football game having no idea what we're in the clutches of and thinking politicians
[3:13:43.040 --> 3:13:50.240]  are trying to fix it marge no they're not trying to fix it they are like cockroaches when they've
[3:13:50.240 --> 3:13:55.760]  been sprayed with poison fornicating like they know their time is short they are going maximum
[3:13:55.760 --> 3:14:00.960]  corrupt right now and uh we're going to see more and more fireworks from here on out
[3:14:00.960 --> 3:14:08.400]  the I don't think people understand what they've done with these bailouts uh the $750,000 bail
[3:14:08.400 --> 3:14:14.000]  off the very first one we passed and then the second one the $850 billion uh take that money
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:18.960]  and add that up divide that by how many people in this country have a home mortgage and you could
[3:14:18.960 --> 3:14:24.080]  pay off literally 90 percent of the home mortgages in this country if they really wanted to put money
[3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:27.760]  back into the economy give people an extra thousand two thousand dollars a month they would have paid
[3:14:27.760 --> 3:14:31.680]  off their their mortgage bills not fed money into the banks that created the problem in the first
[3:14:31.680 --> 3:14:38.400]  place William I totally agree with you uh continue describing what the film goes through I mean if
[3:14:38.400 --> 3:14:43.920]  somebody gets um life on the edge of a bubble blowing the American dream I mean because it covers a
[3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:50.560]  whole bunch of different subjects really a wide spectrum analysis of how this scam works yeah
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:54.240]  well towards the end we do get into the federal reserve and we tell people how these things
[3:14:54.240 --> 3:14:58.320]  have connected but really and truly I don't want to give too much away in the film because it this
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:15:03.440]  is unlike anything I've ever done before where I typically will use horror I will typically use
[3:15:03.440 --> 3:15:07.920]  scare tactics in a documentary to try and frighten people because I like horror movies and those are
[3:15:07.920 --> 3:15:12.560]  the kind of movies I like to make all right but this is a this is kind of a uh uh you know I'm
[3:15:12.560 --> 3:15:16.880]  bowing out from that and and trying to create something a little more comical and there's
[3:15:16.880 --> 3:15:21.200]  this is this thing sets up certain situations and you think it's going in one direction and when
[3:15:21.200 --> 3:15:26.000]  we get there you realize that's not where we went now it's a great film yeah so I you know I
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:29.600]  I hesitate to give away too many of the little secrets that are in there so that people will get
[3:15:29.600 --> 3:15:36.240]  a good uh you know entertainment quality out of it when they watch it but um the the clips alone
[3:15:36.240 --> 3:15:44.720]  we researched over 750 different film reels from 1900 to now grabbing up commercials and grabbing
[3:15:44.720 --> 3:15:51.440]  up footage that applies uh you know for instance some of the uh public uh service announcements
[3:15:51.440 --> 3:15:55.680]  that were coming out in the 30s and the 40s for kids in school talking about you shouldn't steal
[3:15:55.680 --> 3:16:03.120]  or talking about um going to a party we you know the the entire documentary we refer to the bubble
[3:16:03.120 --> 3:16:07.280]  that we're talking about here as a party that's what it is everybody was invited to the party
[3:16:07.280 --> 3:16:12.400]  once everybody got there the banking corporations started spiking the punch and then everybody
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:17.120]  got really happy and crazy and thought nobody could lose money housing prices will never go down
[3:16:17.120 --> 3:16:20.000]  these are the lies that we bought into and believed and of course they were totally
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:25.120]  false if you look through history every 20 years you find out it is false and I can't believe that
[3:16:25.120 --> 3:16:30.080]  Alan Greenspan and some of these men in the positions that they're in can't look back over the last
[3:16:30.080 --> 3:16:34.400]  200 years of our country's history and figure it figure this out for themselves well they know
[3:16:34.400 --> 3:16:40.800]  what they're doing I mean it's all premeditated on record yeah well uh sometimes I wonder if
[3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:45.360]  they're in as much control as they actually think that they are I mean I know that they're out there
[3:16:45.360 --> 3:16:50.320]  manipulating and there's oftentimes that we can you know draw a direct correlation to something
[3:16:50.320 --> 3:16:54.320]  that they've done and blame them for it but I think a lot of times we get caught up in this and we
[3:16:54.320 --> 3:16:59.760]  don't realize how much of a part we play in it just by you know letting Madison Avenue talk us into
[3:16:59.760 --> 3:17:04.080]  you know through their advertising for instance you know going out and taking out an equity loan
[3:17:04.080 --> 3:17:08.960]  in our home to either fix it up or go buy another one to flip it later um and so many people that
[3:17:08.960 --> 3:17:13.360]  got this money spend it on crap at Walmart stuff that you don't even know what they bought with it
[3:17:14.400 --> 3:17:18.960]  we're all guilty I'm guilty I mean everybody's I know it's a consumer society it's like grazing
[3:17:18.960 --> 3:17:24.880]  you like that's why I probably only go to the to target or academy around here maybe once or
[3:17:24.880 --> 3:17:31.040]  twice a year because I just load up the other thing of t-shirts and fishing poles and and and
[3:17:31.040 --> 3:17:37.200]  ammo and I mean I'm like a little kid in a sport sporting goods place I'm and I'm just like snatching
[3:17:37.200 --> 3:17:42.080]  things and I and then I get it and stick it in the garage and there's like a giant pile of ammo
[3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:45.280]  and I mean I guess it's important to have but what am I going to do with all this I don't
[3:17:45.280 --> 3:17:50.960]  have time to go out and shoot it but that's less frivolous than most people I mean the stuff people
[3:17:50.960 --> 3:17:55.200]  buy and fill their houses full of yeah you don't want to turn me loose in an academy because uh
[3:17:55.200 --> 3:17:59.120]  like I said you know Coleman lanterns and and sleeping bags and all that stuff that they have
[3:17:59.120 --> 3:18:03.280]  in there it just you know fascinates me and makes me whip that credit card are you kidding
[3:18:03.280 --> 3:18:08.000]  bow and arrows BB guns I got I have a small backyard the neighbors are always looking over the fence
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:13.360]  at me BB gunning and pellet gunning and bow and arrow back there it's uh it's it's it's certainly
[3:18:13.360 --> 3:18:19.040]  a lot of fun I was just an academy of the day because we lost all the arrows my parents have
[3:18:19.040 --> 3:18:22.000]  three acres in town I go over there and shoot them under the woods and end up losing them but
[3:18:22.640 --> 3:18:27.760]  my kids are quite the little Robin Hoods yeah we were on our way in it was all I could do to not
[3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:34.960]  stop at the academy we don't have them in Missouri oh you saw Valhalla yes absolutely in fact I'll be
[3:18:34.960 --> 3:18:38.720]  visiting academy before I leave just to buy a little trinket and say I visited academy while
[3:18:38.720 --> 3:18:43.360]  I was here but the only problem with academy on the side issue is I bought one gun there
[3:18:44.480 --> 3:18:48.080]  and I go in and the manager comes down he was all a big fan I saw you on the surveillance camera
[3:18:48.640 --> 3:18:52.240]  and then he I bought the handgun bought the ammo and they said oh I'm gonna give it to you
[3:18:52.240 --> 3:18:55.280]  once you get to your car and he was I think they were kind of scared of me like I was gonna
[3:18:55.280 --> 3:18:59.280]  grab the handgun and you know started like an old western in the saloon or something
[3:18:59.280 --> 3:19:03.840]  but hell Walmart writes your name down when you buy ammo now so can't buy ammo at Walmart
[3:19:04.400 --> 3:19:08.720]  I didn't even know that yeah they don't do it at academy yet but so what do you want at academy
[3:19:09.680 --> 3:19:12.880]  I think I want a new Coleman Lantern they brought back the old-fashioned
[3:19:15.200 --> 3:19:19.840]  you know uh pewter metal cap guns they're like heavy with a holster
[3:19:20.720 --> 3:19:24.720]  with the caps and I'd say I got them for my son but you know I've been playing with it
[3:19:24.720 --> 3:19:31.440]  no we know we know that the neighbors I'm not I'm sorry I'm having a little bit of fun we need to
[3:19:31.440 --> 3:19:36.720]  get into the film we get back and take some phone calls life on the edge of a bubble blowing the
[3:19:36.720 --> 3:19:43.120]  American dream and by the way academy I just gave him one hell of an ad one hell of a plug there
[3:19:44.080 --> 3:19:46.880]  you know I actually got to stay here tonight and work all night I can't go home and get the
[3:19:46.880 --> 3:19:52.080]  bows and arrows out though that sucks it does I'd say it's enjoyable sitting in the backyard
[3:19:52.080 --> 3:19:58.080]  sit there and shoot shoot the target here we used to live out in the country we were about 25 miles

[3:24:45.600 --> 3:24:50.080]  camp film you're you're here in town to interview me for this and you're interviewing a representative
[3:24:50.080 --> 3:24:55.360]  guest and others very very exciting maybe i should i actually pulled my concentration camp
[3:24:55.360 --> 3:24:58.640]  files i'd be happy to share them with you i know you guys probably have more research than i have
[3:24:58.640 --> 3:25:03.600]  but i have extensive files you could probably go interview the state rep there's also a city
[3:25:03.600 --> 3:25:07.760]  councilman in oregon where the feds came in and showed them they were building a camp
[3:25:07.760 --> 3:25:12.720]  so and that was first in nbc locally there and then and then we contacted them on the oregon
[3:25:12.720 --> 3:25:17.440]  washington border and we interviewed that guy so so there's actually a lot of folks i can put you on
[3:25:17.440 --> 3:25:23.600]  to uh dealing with fema camps uh because we need to counter glenn beck and i saw in the trailer
[3:25:23.600 --> 3:25:27.760]  for the fema camp film that it looks like you're going to go after glenn beck oh yeah so so i want
[3:25:27.760 --> 3:25:32.000]  to respond directly to beck and and and and i guess that's why you're here do you want me to
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:35.360]  like like break that down yeah we're going to talk about all that okay well i look forward to
[3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:40.400]  doing that and give you as much time as i can uh well with the schedule but uh i'd probably give
[3:25:40.400 --> 3:25:43.840]  you guys more in an hour than what i originally said because this is important well let's right now
[3:25:43.840 --> 3:25:48.720]  talk about the film uh not the new film people can get right now but the film coming out when
[3:25:48.720 --> 3:25:54.160]  does this uh film come out we're probably be in production for about three three and a half months
[3:25:54.160 --> 3:26:00.720]  so about fall right around in there just right before christmas october november yeah as soon as
[3:26:00.720 --> 3:26:05.920]  possible uh honestly you know some of these projects take uh two two years to put together
[3:26:05.920 --> 3:26:09.920]  but no i know i meant to already have another obama film out about the whole banking agenda and i
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:16.000]  just get stuck because there's so much evidence i keep hoarding more and more mm-hmm well we're
[3:26:16.000 --> 3:26:20.480]  we're gonna sort through this information and i think this is going to be uh this is going to be
[3:26:20.480 --> 3:26:25.360]  getting back to i hate to say conspiracy but this is going to be getting back to the roots of uh
[3:26:25.360 --> 3:26:30.320]  of things that i like to cover and you know these are some things that we that you woke me up to
[3:26:30.320 --> 3:26:34.560]  you know ten years ago listening to you on the radio so these are things that i'm excited to
[3:26:34.560 --> 3:26:38.800]  actually expose to people now because we noticed you know there's really not any good documentaries
[3:26:38.800 --> 3:26:44.320]  out there on fema camps nobody's got the legislation no one's presenting uh any of any guest
[3:26:44.320 --> 3:26:49.600]  like you know of your caliber being able to cohesively talk about these issues and this is
[3:26:49.600 --> 3:26:53.920]  what we want to do is put together a documentary that explains all of this about fema camps why
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:26:58.960]  um why they're being hidden from the american people why the legislation is not out there
[3:26:58.960 --> 3:27:04.720]  in the media it's why it's not being talked about and uh see if we can't create uh some feedback
[3:27:04.720 --> 3:27:10.080]  and some um yeah hopefully take some people off so that we can go take some political action well
[3:27:10.080 --> 3:27:15.840]  i'll tell you why i love this william it's great to be able to be in your film because Aaron Russo
[3:27:15.840 --> 3:27:20.800]  called me over and over again wanting for me to be in america for him to fascism and i was busy
[3:27:20.800 --> 3:27:25.040]  doing my other stuff and told him no and i wish i'd have done it because it was such a prolific
[3:27:25.040 --> 3:27:29.440]  film and i knew erin and like him and promoted this film i was just too busy i've learned though
[3:27:29.440 --> 3:27:33.680]  it's better to be in somebody else's film because then you can do all the work and i get to see the
[3:27:33.680 --> 3:27:37.840]  great you know end result and see it wake people up so i'm very happy and i actually had them pull
[3:27:37.840 --> 3:27:45.760]  all the files i can just give you the full you know take absolutely documenting fema camps today
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:48.560]  so i'm really looking forward to that i'm looking forward to be able to offer that
[3:27:48.560 --> 3:27:53.680]  uh to the listeners so i'm honored that you wanted to include me in the film uh tell us uh
[3:27:54.560 --> 3:27:58.800]  tell us how you woke up you're saying you woke up from my show or yeah we've discussed this before
[3:27:58.800 --> 3:28:03.920]  i'd forgotten i just found an issue yeah it's it's just um i don't know 10 years ago approximately
[3:28:03.920 --> 3:28:11.040]  i was a graphic designer designing uh cd covers and you know working with uh i can tina turner and
[3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:16.480]  some of these really old blues people and during the day when i was sitting there designing the
[3:28:16.480 --> 3:28:20.640]  covers or producing or whatever year programs what i was listening to you know just pull up the
[3:28:20.640 --> 3:28:26.320]  archives and listen to them on the the computer and um i still think that that is you know a
[3:28:26.320 --> 3:28:30.800]  completely untapped resource that there could be more people out there having their own independent
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:35.600]  media uh to help get the word out but you know i don't think anybody's going to be able to compete
[3:28:35.600 --> 3:28:40.560]  with your you know oh no i want them to but but listen that's the great part about all this is
[3:28:40.560 --> 3:28:46.160]  another testament to somebody that i reached out to that we woke up and then think of the millions
[3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:53.360]  you've woken up any idea on the 567 films i forget uh beyond trees and all of it that that you
[3:28:53.360 --> 3:28:57.920]  produced or you directed how many millions you reached i mean it's it's there's no way to ever
[3:28:57.920 --> 3:29:03.760]  know that really some of your films have aired on tv all over the world yeah uh we i mean in fact
[3:29:03.760 --> 3:29:08.000]  life on the edge of a bubble you can probably watch that in about three four months on free
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:15.680]  speech tv uh we have a screening coming up tonight at brave new books do you know the address uh it's

[3:33:22.160 --> 3:33:26.960]  having great discussions during the break gary france you just told me i woke him up i didn't
[3:33:26.960 --> 3:33:31.840]  know i woke the great gary france you up as well but but but i've described to my audience and
[3:33:31.840 --> 3:33:37.040]  well actually not the audience yet the internal office i feel like i'm gizmo the good gremlin
[3:33:37.840 --> 3:33:42.800]  and the problem is they put drops of water on my back and all these other media activists pop off
[3:33:42.800 --> 3:33:47.040]  but very few of them turn out to be good and i think you guys have turned out to be good
[3:33:47.040 --> 3:33:51.040]  the problem is i don't you know these little gremlins that pop off my back anybody's seen
[3:33:51.040 --> 3:33:55.360]  gremlins they put the water on them and more of them pop off then if you feed them after midnight
[3:33:55.360 --> 3:34:01.440]  they really get bad and uh and i mean there's like probably 20 or 30 locals who move down here
[3:34:01.440 --> 3:34:05.840]  who are like bad gremlins and we have to even hide out from them they'll come over here and
[3:34:05.840 --> 3:34:10.960]  cause problems and they get in i mean literally gremlins is the way to describe them so i am
[3:34:10.960 --> 3:34:16.960]  the good gizmo and i and i france he is a good little creature and so is william louis no no i
[3:34:16.960 --> 3:34:22.320]  mean you know for me for me it is a great feeling though to know i have reached hundreds of millions
[3:34:22.320 --> 3:34:27.440]  of people hundreds of millions of people have seen my films seen my clips seen my material
[3:34:27.440 --> 3:34:32.160]  and it's all coming to an end as they openly announce i had two or three mainstream articles
[3:34:32.160 --> 3:34:36.320]  today where they said no we're going to shut down freedom on the web and so is europe and we're
[3:34:36.320 --> 3:34:40.560]  going to ban all this anti-government stuff and now they're trying to pass hate laws and trying
[3:34:40.560 --> 3:34:45.360]  to pass the cyber bullying act where if you hurt someone's feelings you're arrested in hannah montana
[3:34:45.360 --> 3:34:52.480]  the character and syris the real girl is promoting it uh and so i mean it's really happening and i
[3:34:52.480 --> 3:34:58.080]  don't think they can let us be out there very much longer that's why i'm trying to make more films
[3:34:58.080 --> 3:35:02.480]  promote more films being other people's films but i'll tell you this i've told the wall street
[3:35:02.480 --> 3:35:06.720]  journal and a bunch of other big newspapers know to interviews this last week and they freak out
[3:35:06.720 --> 3:35:10.080]  and they go don't you want to be in the wall street journal don't you want to be in time magazine
[3:35:10.080 --> 3:35:13.600]  and i'm like no i don't want to have a hit piece and have you here in my office but i do want to
[3:35:13.600 --> 3:35:17.520]  have you guys here because you are what matters it doesn't mean anything to be in some twisted
[3:35:17.520 --> 3:35:22.800]  article just have my name in it i don't care about that i care about reaching the people through
[3:35:22.800 --> 3:35:27.760]  your film but uh you were making some points as we went to break there what was the uh other point
[3:35:27.760 --> 3:35:32.880]  about the uh oh about uh the amount of change you've seen in the world the things you've done
[3:35:32.880 --> 3:35:37.200]  which is another testament to other people out there being leaders that's why the establishment
[3:35:37.200 --> 3:35:42.400]  attacks me so much and tries to discredit me or says i'm the government or i'm bad or i'm a
[3:35:42.400 --> 3:35:48.320]  knight of malta when i'm not even catholic and all this stuff is because they want to divide us all
[3:35:48.320 --> 3:35:54.160]  and make us all feel weak and then make you feel like i'm not for real so you can't believe that
[3:35:54.160 --> 3:36:00.240]  you're for real and so you can't believe that you're actually going to be able to affect change and
[3:36:00.240 --> 3:36:04.880]  go out there and do great things uh but you know i tell you very franchise for real i've seen the
[3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:09.040]  fruits of his work and i've seen the fruits of your work not out in fighting not stirring up
[3:36:09.040 --> 3:36:16.080]  trouble producing good films reaching people that is what the establishment is scared to death of
[3:36:16.080 --> 3:36:21.120]  so i uh i salute you both thank you and there's there's nothing i hate worse than politics
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:28.880]  maybe office politics but uh you know i know we had some discussions about individuals in the uh
[3:36:28.880 --> 3:36:33.360]  truth movement who may not be who they say they are but you definitely are and we're very honored
[3:36:33.360 --> 3:36:37.600]  to be here and have you in this film well and it's not even a lot of people out there government
[3:36:37.600 --> 3:36:42.720]  operatives their their society is collapsing are you notice how much cheating and lying and stealing
[3:36:42.720 --> 3:36:48.320]  and stuff is going on these days i mean society is in freefall and that's why we're here to warn
[3:36:48.320 --> 3:36:53.760]  good people to get ready and to deal with it and to and for good people not to give the scum any
[3:36:53.760 --> 3:36:58.240]  slack anymore i don't care if it's a corrupt cop or corrupt neighbor or corrupt boss or corrupt
[3:36:58.240 --> 3:37:05.200]  employee it's time to stop being wimps it's time to get tough and get serious and get focused
[3:37:05.200 --> 3:37:10.160]  because this this is a real world you know this didn't touch football we're playing out here
[3:37:10.160 --> 3:37:13.360]  and the new old order is coming in big time i want to go to calls but i wanted to bring this up to
[3:37:13.360 --> 3:37:18.480]  you and i want to make sure in the interview we cover this because amazing things are happening
[3:37:18.480 --> 3:37:25.520]  the news comes out and says the federal reserve is going to get all this new power and then you
[3:37:25.520 --> 3:37:31.040]  read the new power it says to take over any government any agency any corporation they want
[3:37:31.040 --> 3:37:35.760]  just like they grab chrysler and gm and the banks and they're going to micromanage every
[3:37:35.760 --> 3:37:40.880]  facet of our lives in the new york times report separately that they're hiring criminals to join
[3:37:40.880 --> 3:37:47.360]  the in the obama in viral brigades but the new york times says that's a good idea this is a new
[3:37:47.360 --> 3:37:54.080]  form of government is now being born we have the private federal reserve coming in and and now
[3:37:54.080 --> 3:37:58.080]  openly becoming the government they were always there manipulating it and steering it but now
[3:37:58.080 --> 3:38:03.040]  the federal reserve is a regional governorship of this new bank of the world is openly becoming the
[3:38:03.040 --> 3:38:10.080]  new public dictatorial power over everything public and private i mean this is unspeakably huge
[3:38:10.080 --> 3:38:14.560]  what's being announced and they're announcing it like it's no big deal your comments on that
[3:38:14.560 --> 3:38:21.120]  well it's because we've been acclimated we you know used to we would frown and you know immediately
[3:38:21.120 --> 3:38:25.360]  jump up out of our seats and scream bloody murder when we heard some of these things that were going
[3:38:25.360 --> 3:38:30.160]  on in our own government now it's just commonplace you can't you can't turn on the news radio or
[3:38:30.160 --> 3:38:35.760]  anything and hear anything but manipulation these days so we're acclimated to it they've got us
[3:38:35.760 --> 3:38:40.160]  exactly where they want us and that's our job to go out there and wake up to people the other 99
[3:38:40.160 --> 3:38:43.760]  percent who are out there who don't know what's going on absolutely and i want to encourage
[3:38:43.760 --> 3:38:48.720]  listeners again one more time to go to info wars dot com the secure online video books for shopping

[3:38:54.000 --> 3:39:02.160]  edge of a bubble blowing the american dream and it's just such an important film life on the edge
[3:39:02.160 --> 3:39:08.560]  of a bubble is a heart pounding amusement park rides in the never ending sequence of intoxicating
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:13.920]  mania's and inflation bubbles culminating and devastating panics and crashes since the inception
[3:39:13.920 --> 3:39:18.800]  of the american experiment although we rarely consider our financial system and experiment
[3:39:18.800 --> 3:39:24.000]  changes in the monetary games we have played undermine the integrity of the political system
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:29.200]  almost every 20 years since our nation's inception each generation finds itself living on the edge
[3:39:29.200 --> 3:39:34.240]  of a bubble rising prices of real estate stocks and bonds and commodities lure us to borrow our
[3:39:34.240 --> 3:39:40.880]  way to prosperity however our current crisis is not unique right along as we uncover the real
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:46.160]  invisible hand operating this roller coaster tempting us with hope as we climb the ladder
[3:39:46.160 --> 3:39:51.520]  of the american dream seeming place within our grasp only the plunge helpless as we watch it
[3:39:51.520 --> 3:39:57.920]  disappear beneath the tidal waves of toxic debt is there hope that we can end this perpetual
[3:39:57.920 --> 3:40:03.040]  cycle and in doing so secure the blessings of liberty and promotion of the general welfare
[3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:10.240]  for everyone and it is a credit bubble financial crisis panic bailout it goes on and on available
[3:40:10.240 --> 3:40:15.680]  at info wars dot com or by calling toll free eight eight eight two five three three one three nine
[3:40:15.680 --> 3:40:21.760]  let's go ahead and roll part of the trailer here it is ladies and gentlemen the trailer for life on
[3:40:21.760 --> 3:40:31.920]  the edge of a bubble you give a thousand dollars to an empire right before he calls the play what
[3:40:31.920 --> 3:40:39.360]  you call that a bribe you give a thousand dollars to a judge right before he renders a verdict what
[3:40:39.360 --> 3:40:47.360]  do you call that a bribe you give a thousand dollars of politician right before he votes on
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:53.440]  your bill what do you call that a campaign contribution is this the united states congress
[3:40:53.440 --> 3:41:00.080]  or the board of directors of goldman sacks the plan we have before us today the rescue plan
[3:41:00.080 --> 3:41:04.800]  is vastly different from the original one sent to us by the administration today it's about
[3:41:04.800 --> 3:41:10.400]  protecting main street not wall street they're going to pay out 18 billion dollars in bonuses
[3:41:10.400 --> 3:41:18.160]  it's about protecting the american taxpayer not ceo salaries they paid an average of 2.6 million
[3:41:18.160 --> 3:41:23.680]  dollars to every executive at the first 116 banks that got taxpayer money under tarp
[3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:38.160]  live on the edge of the bubble dot com you can also get it there or as i said at info wars
[3:41:38.160 --> 3:41:43.840]  dot com very very exciting is there a way to watch the film online yet or is it just on dvd
[3:41:43.840 --> 3:41:48.480]  nope just on dvd uh typically we don't like to stream the the movies when they first come out
[3:41:48.480 --> 3:41:52.000]  because we haven't even gotten them at the festivals yet i want to see it in the big screen
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:56.560]  no i understand yeah they won't even let you in the festivals or then on tv and things if you
[3:41:56.560 --> 3:42:01.360]  put it on the web first that's why i forego being able to put it on tv forego all that money and
[3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:04.800]  stuff which is probably stupid because i just like to release it instantly for free and hammer
[3:42:04.800 --> 3:42:09.680]  the enemy but i don't disagree with what you're doing absolutely yeah i mean we we didn't uh
[3:42:09.680 --> 3:42:15.440]  protect the the disk it's not copy protected so people when you get a copy can make their own copies
[3:42:15.440 --> 3:42:19.200]  and give them to friends and family we just don't want to selling them but still folks don't even
[3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:24.480]  appreciate that i mean we've got to make some seed money here i mean i can have 15 million views
[3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:29.680]  of the obama deception and only sell 10 000 of them i need to sell these to make the money to make
[3:42:29.680 --> 3:42:33.520]  more films oh exactly and this is the argument that we get all the time is if you know if you
[3:42:33.520 --> 3:42:36.720]  really believe in the cause or if you're really doing what you say you're doing then you're going
[3:42:36.720 --> 3:42:40.480]  to give this film away for free and it's like well the film costs me a lot of money to make how
[3:42:40.480 --> 3:42:44.080]  can i give it away for free and how can i make the next one you know i mean here's an example the
[3:42:44.080 --> 3:42:49.920]  erin russo thing listeners kept asking me to make an erin russo deal off the free video we put out
[3:42:49.920 --> 3:42:54.640]  i went interviewing put it out for free that wasn't enough uh and then we took about a week
[3:42:54.640 --> 3:42:58.320]  and a half slapped it together put it out with some updates and video clips kind of a nice
[3:42:58.320 --> 3:43:03.840]  memorial forum people are like how dare you sell it when it's all free on the web and my thing is
[3:43:03.840 --> 3:43:07.520]  we've sold so few copies the few thousand dvds i've got i'm just going to do a deal where they're
[3:43:07.520 --> 3:43:11.600]  free when you get the obama deception or something just to get it out i thought it was a nice thing
[3:43:11.600 --> 3:43:16.000]  to do uh you know but that's why we have the money bomb and people that have brains and have
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:21.120]  businesses and know how much this cost donated so i can make more films i'm gonna try to double what
[3:43:21.120 --> 3:43:25.360]  i do in the next year that means i'm not going to see my family much but we don't know of in a
[3:43:25.360 --> 3:43:28.960]  year we're going to even be allowed to be on the web anymore it might be six months i mean they're
[3:43:28.960 --> 3:43:32.400]  openly saying in the new york times they're going to restrict our free speech so people need to
[3:43:32.400 --> 3:43:36.960]  support you financially they need to support us financially and they do that by getting life on
[3:43:36.960 --> 3:43:42.240]  the edge of a bubble uh blowing the american dream but also you get a great film and you support
[3:43:42.240 --> 3:43:49.920]  alternative media you support uh independent media you grow a new voice when you just sit there and
[3:43:49.920 --> 3:43:55.760]  watch nbc or abc or fox and then buy the stuff from their sponsors you're supporting the enemy
[3:43:55.760 --> 3:43:59.920]  but see that that's a government sigh up to say no one's allowed to write a book or make a film with
[3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:06.320]  us and then most of it they use our tax payer money to do you know this is a free will thing so
[3:44:06.320 --> 3:44:11.360]  i'm not buffaloed i'm not ashamed to ask for donations at info wars moneybomb.com i'm not
[3:44:11.360 --> 3:44:16.000]  ashamed to say buy the video because you still let people buffalo me no i'm not going to be
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:19.760]  buffaloed we're going to expand what we're doing we're going to wage war against the new world order

[3:45:32.080 --> 3:45:37.040]  it full but the then i learned though the little gizmo has these things falling off of him a lot
[3:45:37.040 --> 3:45:40.960]  of times they turn back and biting but mark dies hasn't done that yet he hasn't turned into a stripe
[3:45:40.960 --> 3:45:49.440]  yet well obviously you weren't eating after midnight folks if you haven't seen gremlins you

[3:46:39.120 --> 3:46:48.160]  all green on black coming this fall campfema and then it cuts to glen back i'm doing a story tonight
[3:46:48.160 --> 3:46:54.640]  that i wanted to debunk these phila camps i'm tired of here you know about them i'm tired from the
[3:46:54.640 --> 3:46:59.680]  producer very friends from the further public dot com for the research at mag washington dot com
[3:46:59.680 --> 3:47:04.960]  i can't debunk them yeah that was him setting it did you hear me call you know what we ought to get
[3:47:04.960 --> 3:47:13.280]  we ought to get you the tv show from um march where i did a whole two hours saying this is what
[3:47:13.280 --> 3:47:16.640]  limbeck's gonna do he's gonna go show the train station that we've known has been faked since
[3:47:16.640 --> 3:47:22.080]  96 linda thompson and i laid out everything he'd do and i predicted i said you watch he's gonna
[3:47:22.080 --> 3:47:26.240]  debunk it everybody said how dare you say he's gonna debunk it he says he believes it's real
[3:47:26.240 --> 3:47:32.880]  i know he's cia and i even have sources but the issue is is that i mean did you well you're
[3:47:32.880 --> 3:47:36.400]  i saw it before i came up here in fact i've watched about nine hours of police state videos
[3:47:36.400 --> 3:47:40.480]  to research before i came to talk to you and you know i did that all in one day and it just
[3:47:40.480 --> 3:47:45.280]  brought back all these emotions that i you know i had when i saw these films no but to be specific
[3:47:45.280 --> 3:47:48.960]  no i understand but to be specific though did you know i did a whole two hour show
[3:47:48.960 --> 3:47:52.400]  exposing what i what beck was going to do and people said how do you know he's going to say
[3:47:52.400 --> 3:47:56.000]  they don't exist how do you i know his mind but go ahead yeah if you want to get us some footage
[3:47:56.000 --> 3:48:00.880]  of that we'll definitely incorporate it yeah what what date was that i i i did the fema camp
[3:48:00.880 --> 3:48:07.920]  special and it was like two hours uh on air and i know i did it live on prismplanet.tv i know it's
[3:48:07.920 --> 3:48:13.200]  on youtube but absolutely i'd be more than happy guys it'll never happen if we don't do it well
[3:48:13.200 --> 3:48:17.040]  somebody dig out that date because i know i said record it because we're gonna put it on one of
[3:48:17.040 --> 3:48:23.280]  the monthly best ofs and it's not about me up here tooting my horn if you can find the date
[3:48:23.280 --> 3:48:28.800]  for us we'll get it um it's not about me tooting my horn it's about we really know what we're
[3:48:28.800 --> 3:48:33.360]  talking about anyways what do you think of glenn beck me personally great american
[3:48:34.640 --> 3:48:41.760]  hardly uh you know i see a far doesn't exist gary oh it doesn't
[3:48:41.760 --> 3:48:48.080]  oh i i didn't i thought it did is that a conspiracy yep conspiracy theory
[3:48:50.720 --> 3:48:57.600]  yeah glenn beck is no different than anybody else out there uh he's working with two different
[3:48:57.600 --> 3:49:02.400]  motives one that he allows you to see and the other one that he doesn't and you got to see that first
[3:49:02.400 --> 3:49:06.640]  hand when he covered fema camps and you called it dead right on what he was going to say so
[3:49:06.640 --> 3:49:11.440]  um there's nothing to say about glenn beck glenn beck exposes himself for what he is
[3:49:12.640 --> 3:49:17.040]  well i just knew i knew how they operated the only thing i didn't foresee was that it'd be
[3:49:17.040 --> 3:49:22.880]  popular mechanics doing it but it's that straw man model so i thought what has been proven to
[3:49:22.880 --> 3:49:28.880]  not be camps and i said well that camp down in louisiana is really for nato troops to train for
[3:49:28.880 --> 3:49:34.720]  a camp in europe i would if i was going to debunk i'd do that and the railway and frag station
[3:49:34.720 --> 3:49:38.880]  and but but that wasn't just my prediction being right on that i said he was going to come out and
[3:49:38.880 --> 3:49:44.080]  say it wasn't real that was the big prediction everybody going up the back fox news finally
[3:49:44.080 --> 3:49:50.080]  cares uh they were doing that to get people's confidence yeah you know gary actually went
[3:49:50.080 --> 3:49:56.080]  out and shot at the beach grow facility and came back and said william it's not a fema camp i mean
[3:49:56.080 --> 3:50:00.640]  we we've known from the very beginning you know that this was definitely not what people were
[3:50:00.640 --> 3:50:04.000]  saying it was on the internet but that's the whole thing you know we've got about 150 different
[3:50:04.000 --> 3:50:08.480]  sites to go look at and try and determine which one is and which one didn't but you know what it
[3:50:08.480 --> 3:50:11.920]  doesn't really make any difference because the legislation is in place and any one of those
[3:50:11.920 --> 3:50:16.800]  facilities overnight can be turned into a fema camp well they also don't put a big fema camp sign
[3:50:17.360 --> 3:50:23.200]  they have designated facilities like where you got them dead to rights is these emergency overflow
[3:50:23.200 --> 3:50:28.240]  centers they build an old like well pure 57 that was a fema camp and the feds paid for that and
[3:50:28.240 --> 3:50:33.520]  bechtel all them were involved and and and out here at the old robert mulier airport that's the 747
[3:50:33.520 --> 3:50:38.560]  hangar with the facility in it all right we'll try to jam a few calls in here on the other side
[3:50:39.200 --> 3:50:44.320]  but but yeah no it's places with barbed wire that are designated well here's the big enchilada
[3:50:44.320 --> 3:50:48.960]  during the dark winter drills and the top off one and two they practice putting people in the sport
[3:50:48.960 --> 3:50:55.280]  stadium those are your fema camps your city paid for sport stadium is your fema camp so see they're

[3:56:25.040 --> 3:56:29.200]  sucker and suck a tash we call the professor this morning but he knew we were and didn't want to
[3:56:29.200 --> 3:56:35.680]  come on rutgers professor warns geoengineering could create disastrous global famine now they're
[3:56:35.680 --> 3:56:40.160]  already geoengineering and they say oh we've been doing tests but if we go widespread with this
[3:56:40.160 --> 3:56:44.720]  uh it could cause all sorts of disasters well of course they claim they want to spray these
[3:56:44.720 --> 3:56:49.040]  barium salts and lemon dioxide to cool the earth but all the climatologists we've talked to that
[3:56:49.040 --> 3:56:53.760]  say they knew they were doing this years ago because they're climatologists the plane i mean
[3:56:53.760 --> 3:56:58.000]  that's that's a real photo of a plane flying and spraying the artist just added skulls in the
[3:56:58.000 --> 3:57:02.880]  background i think it's a more powerful photo without the skulls but regardless it makes the point
[3:57:02.880 --> 3:57:10.080]  uh here's the wall street journal it's time to cool the planet cutting greenhouse gases is no
[3:57:10.080 --> 3:57:15.040]  longer enough to deal with global warming and it goes on he argues that we also have something
[3:57:15.040 --> 3:57:19.600]  more direct and they go into how they've got a terraform folks we've exposed they're doing this
[3:57:19.600 --> 3:57:24.080]  now they just admit they're doing it but to save us so i'll cover that first thing tomorrow on the
