[00:00.000 --> 00:14.280]  It's Thursday, November 24th, the year 2022, it is Thanksgiving, this is our special Thanksgiving
[00:14.280 --> 00:15.280]  broadcast.
[00:15.280 --> 00:19.720]  I want to thank you all for joining us today, I want to tell you what's coming up.
[00:19.720 --> 00:26.000]  I did a hour and a half interview with Dr. Sherrie Tenpenny a few weeks ago that listeners
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.560]  and viewers that saw it really gave us great reviews from, so we're going to be airing
[00:30.560 --> 00:38.640]  that Dr. Sherrie Tenpenny interview with me coming up in hour one and part of hour two.
[00:38.640 --> 00:42.520]  Then we had Vivian Kubrick and Sean Stone in studio, an amazing hour, that's going to
[00:42.520 --> 00:49.120]  be an hour three and then the super informative, amazing researcher, Daydyer is in the fourth
[00:49.120 --> 00:50.920]  hour today.
[00:50.920 --> 00:53.960]  Tomorrow on the Friday edition, we're going to have that special day, but I can interview
[00:53.960 --> 00:59.120]  George Christensen, Mike Adams and more, and I just want to wish you all an amazing Thanksgiving
[00:59.120 --> 01:02.320]  and I'm just very, very thankful for all of you and what you've done.
[01:02.320 --> 01:07.760]  I wanted to hit a story that came out a few days ago on infowords.com that I've not yet
[01:07.760 --> 01:15.100]  gotten to that's so important, high-end fashion brand ads shows young kids holding sex bondage
[01:15.100 --> 01:18.720]  teddy bears with child porn court papers in the background.
[01:18.720 --> 01:30.080]  And it's literal bondage, torture, S&M dolls with what looks like three or four-year-olds.
[01:30.080 --> 01:32.280]  There's a whole bunch of this that's really hard to look at.
[01:32.280 --> 01:38.240]  And then on the desk in front of them are court papers, one of the Supreme Court legalized
[01:38.240 --> 01:44.160]  simulated child porn and it's some kind of bizarre celebration of that and so everybody
[01:44.160 --> 01:51.800]  should be aware that this is going on and the fact that these companies are pushing
[01:51.800 --> 01:52.800]  this.
[01:52.800 --> 01:57.960]  I mean this really is their cult and as Owen Schroyer said a few days ago, you just cannot
[01:57.960 --> 02:00.080]  compromise with this level of evil.
[02:00.080 --> 02:03.880]  I only want to say the name of the company on air and give them any attention.
[02:03.880 --> 02:09.560]  It's one of the top luxury brands in the world and they sell sunglasses and shoes and bags
[02:09.560 --> 02:15.560]  and clothing and jewelry and it's just absolutely truly disgusting in the headline.
[02:15.560 --> 02:19.840]  High-end fashion brand ad shows young kids holding sex bondage teddy bears with child
[02:19.840 --> 02:23.000]  porn court papers in the background.
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.120]  This is who we're dealing with.
[02:24.120 --> 02:29.240]  This is the type of people that are waging war on our civilization and on our children
[02:29.240 --> 02:31.800]  because they know they've got to destroy the innocence of the future if they're going
[02:31.800 --> 02:32.800]  to win.
[02:32.800 --> 02:38.120]  Now here in Info Wars we are not selling stuff using child porn marketing.
[02:38.120 --> 02:42.000]  We're marketing health and immune system and the fact that when you buy products at Info
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.160]  Wars Store.com it funds the Info War and it funds freedom and it funds the human resistance
[02:46.160 --> 02:50.840]  and it funds pro-life and right now we have the biggest sale in our history.

[03:24.560 --> 03:28.400]  selected by the shopping cart computer when you do each order.
[03:28.400 --> 03:30.000]  So that's the best that we've ever offered.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.560]  It's a clearance sale to get the money in we need during this bankruptcy to make sure
[03:33.560 --> 03:37.480]  we stay on air, we're doing chapter 11, sub chapter 5 which means we will stay on air

[03:42.800 --> 03:46.080]  now and we're right where we need to be but just barely.
[03:46.080 --> 03:50.600]  So again, give yourself the gift of freedom, give yourself the gift of liberty, give yourself

[04:45.360 --> 04:46.360]  links.

[04:49.560 --> 04:52.840]  because you are the reason this operation is so powerful and I salute and thank you
[04:52.840 --> 05:00.880]  all and I'm very thankful for you on this Thanksgiving, so God bless you all.
[05:00.880 --> 05:07.600]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[05:07.600 --> 05:12.200]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[05:12.200 --> 05:16.640]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[05:16.640 --> 05:21.480]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[05:21.480 --> 05:25.080]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[05:25.080 --> 05:31.880]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3, but if you're not getting
[05:31.880 --> 05:36.960]  enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[05:36.960 --> 05:39.760]  things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[05:39.760 --> 05:43.720]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[05:43.720 --> 05:48.400]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload
[05:48.400 --> 05:54.680]  into your body for 50% off at infowarstore.com with promo code 1776.
[05:54.680 --> 06:20.280]  Support the info war and your immune system with vitamin D3 gummies at infowarstore.com.
[06:20.280 --> 06:25.880]  To introduce to you a guest that really needs no introduction, my longtime friend, colleague,
[06:25.880 --> 06:29.680]  partner in crime, partner in fighting all these terrorist sort of people that are out
[06:29.680 --> 06:33.400]  there, all of the Kabbal and the globalist, Alex Jones.
[06:33.400 --> 06:38.240]  I just can't even believe that Alex said he'd come and be on my podcast this morning.
[06:38.240 --> 06:44.200]  Alex, what a pleasure and an honor to welcome you to our podcast this week for Dr. T. this
[06:44.200 --> 06:45.200]  morning.
[06:45.200 --> 06:49.240]  It's amazing, hard to believe I've been interviewing you for 22 years and now I'm here on your
[06:49.240 --> 06:54.120]  broadcast which I know is so successful reaching people and that's why you're one of the top
[06:54.120 --> 06:57.240]  two people that big pharma in the deep states attacking.
[06:57.240 --> 06:59.280]  It's you and Dr. Peter McCullough.
[06:59.280 --> 07:02.800]  They're specifically singling out everywhere as enemies.
[07:02.800 --> 07:06.960]  So that's one of the greatest awards you can get is to have some of the most evil people
[07:06.960 --> 07:09.800]  on earth see you as their top enemies.
[07:09.800 --> 07:14.200]  So congratulations, Dr. Sherry Timbini, you are in a very elite club and folks should
[07:14.200 --> 07:17.920]  be praying for you and supporting you because you're a woman of great strength and honor
[07:17.920 --> 07:22.560]  and courage, but you are definitely under massive attack and the heart of the fight.
[07:22.560 --> 07:23.560]  So I salute you.
[07:23.560 --> 07:25.200]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[07:25.200 --> 07:30.360]  You know, I've done it between March of 2020 and December of 21.
[07:30.360 --> 07:35.720]  I did over 600 interviews and usually I do about 30 a year and people have always asked
[07:35.720 --> 07:39.600]  me when I've been on their interview, what does it feel like to be labeled as the disinformation
[07:39.600 --> 07:45.440]  dozen and to be called out by the person who calls himself president as one of the most
[07:45.440 --> 07:48.920]  dangerous people in America, I said, we're like a little batch of courage over here.
[07:48.920 --> 07:56.320]  You know, so I wanted to start out by asking you because I read something that info was
[07:56.320 --> 08:00.400]  published, I think yesterday or last night about David Ike.
[08:00.400 --> 08:03.960]  I mean, he's another one amongst us that's been doing this for decades.
[08:03.960 --> 08:09.120]  And now he's been banned from the EU and he's been labeled a level three terrorist.
[08:09.120 --> 08:13.200]  And we talked a little before we went live about what a level explained to the audience
[08:13.200 --> 08:15.560]  at level one and level two is in level three.
[08:15.560 --> 08:19.160]  And if he's a level three terrorist, what does that make us?
[08:19.160 --> 08:22.120]  They would call us level level three as well.
[08:22.120 --> 08:25.800]  What they do is they take a real terrorist planning to blow something up who's got a
[08:25.800 --> 08:28.840]  bomb or a gun and about to go do something and they call that a level one.
[08:28.840 --> 08:30.280]  That's a real terrorist.
[08:30.280 --> 08:33.840]  And then you've got level two as material support.
[08:33.840 --> 08:36.600]  And then a level three is not a terrorist.
[08:36.600 --> 08:39.760]  They say, well, even though you're not even talking about terrorism or pushing violence,
[08:39.760 --> 08:44.960]  if you criticize the government or say there's a deep state or undermine the system in any
[08:44.960 --> 08:49.040]  way by saying it's wrong, trying to reprove it, trying to change it, you know, a basic
[08:49.040 --> 08:52.880]  part of living in a free society, then we're going to call you a level three terrorist
[08:52.880 --> 08:53.880]  and restrict your movement.
[08:53.880 --> 08:55.280]  And it's the same all over the world.
[08:55.280 --> 08:59.360]  They're trying to bring in similar systems here in the U.S. and it's not just David Ike
[08:59.360 --> 09:05.600]  saying this, on infowars.com, obviously we have a transcript translated from the Dutch
[09:05.600 --> 09:12.040]  letter, but it's under EU authority and in the Dutch letter, it says that he's banned
[09:12.040 --> 09:16.040]  for two years because he speaks to crowds of 50 to 100,000.
[09:16.040 --> 09:20.160]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke into crowds of a million and they're trying to ban him right
[09:20.160 --> 09:21.680]  now as well.
[09:21.680 --> 09:26.680]  But by saying you criticize the corporations, the power structure.
[09:26.680 --> 09:27.680]  So that's terrorism.
[09:27.680 --> 09:32.280]  So your free speech is now terrorism, which is really their end game.
[09:32.280 --> 09:40.840]  And we saw in June of 2000 and 21, we saw Biden's official new Homeland Security directive
[09:40.840 --> 09:44.000]  saying white supremacism is the number one terror threat.
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.880]  They then defined in that new national policy paper directed by the president over the executive
[09:48.880 --> 09:57.680]  branch, the FBI, the CIA, DHS, that criticizing election fraud, criticizing lockdowns, forced
[09:57.680 --> 10:04.240]  injections, or open borders, and now it came out two weeks ago, the intercept, more documents,
[10:04.240 --> 10:13.120]  or criticizing manmade global warming saying it's not real, or even questioning the pull
[10:13.120 --> 10:19.200]  out a year ago out of Afghanistan that you're also a extremist and need to be censored.
[10:19.200 --> 10:24.120]  So they define you as a terrorist or a white supremacist for simply being a good citizen
[10:24.120 --> 10:27.680]  and being engaged and then saying that you're the main terror threat.
[10:27.680 --> 10:30.960]  That is official U.S. government policy now.
[10:30.960 --> 10:36.240]  Alex, you know, we went to war in World War II over this sort of censorship.
[10:36.240 --> 10:41.920]  We set up Radio Free Europe after World War II, even though we know that that was a CIA
[10:41.920 --> 10:43.200]  si-op and all these other things.
[10:43.200 --> 10:47.800]  But ostensibly, I mean, on the surface, I mean, the thing was to try to get past what
[10:47.800 --> 10:51.880]  the propaganda message was, the over and over propaganda message us.
[10:51.880 --> 10:52.880]  And here we are.
[10:52.880 --> 10:55.600]  I mean, the United States of America, did you ever think?
[10:55.600 --> 11:00.520]  I mean, well, yes, you did, because Info Wars has been around for a long time.
[11:00.520 --> 11:05.680]  And you know, I said to you back at the beginning of this, uh, pandemic thing, I said, congratulations,
[11:05.680 --> 11:06.680]  Alex.
[11:06.680 --> 11:10.440]  I mean, you've been prophetic when you said Info Wars was what was happening.
[11:10.440 --> 11:17.720]  I mean, but it's one thing to talk about it like in hush circles amongst friends and
[11:17.720 --> 11:20.280]  colleagues that are of like mind.
[11:20.280 --> 11:26.280]  Now it's so out in the open, um, you know, we used to talk about things like, um, adenochrome
[11:26.280 --> 11:31.920]  and, and human trafficking and, and pedophilia behind closed doors, you know, only with,
[11:31.920 --> 11:34.560]  with friends and family that you knew were on the same page as you.
[11:34.560 --> 11:39.640]  But now it is so obvious with the depopulation agenda of what they're doing and going forward.
[11:39.640 --> 11:42.680]  Um, what do you think is the next step?
[11:42.680 --> 11:47.080]  I mean, you've been prophetically talking about this for 30 years, you know, I've been
[11:47.080 --> 11:50.920]  like, I've been talking about vaccine issues for 22 years.
[11:50.920 --> 11:53.640]  Where do you think they are going to go next?
[11:53.640 --> 11:58.680]  Well, that's the most important question to just to be clear, I was prophetically led
[11:58.680 --> 12:02.560]  by God and the Holy spirit to look into these things.
[12:02.560 --> 12:07.640]  Uh, but really when I began to read the books by Henry Kissinger, it's a big to Brzezinski,
[12:07.640 --> 12:12.720]  David Rockefeller, I knew this was all coming when I first got on air 28 years ago.
[12:12.720 --> 12:19.560]  I was really 23 years ago, even when I was in high school, but I've been on air 28 years
[12:19.560 --> 12:22.080]  since I was 21.
[12:22.080 --> 12:26.200]  I knew this was all coming because it was in the documents, but the reason I was interested
[12:26.200 --> 12:33.600]  in the documents is my mother's brother who died a few years ago, best guy I ever knew.
[12:33.600 --> 12:37.680]  He'd been this big, you know, star youngest ever ham radio operator.
[12:37.680 --> 12:42.720]  He won national awards for being the fastest Morse code operator.
[12:42.720 --> 12:47.120]  And he was a Vietnam war hero, but none of us ever knew that until he died.
[12:47.120 --> 12:55.260]  We knew he was in Vietnam, but then he was involved in Iran contra and involved in high
[12:55.260 --> 12:58.200]  level management of a lot of really big things.
[12:58.200 --> 13:04.320]  And he saw some things in Guatemala and other areas where he was in charge of setting up
[13:04.320 --> 13:08.880]  bases and things to fight the communist that really shook him to his core.
[13:08.880 --> 13:14.120]  And it wasn't till about a year before he died that he told me what it was that made
[13:14.120 --> 13:15.600]  him get out of these projects.
[13:15.600 --> 13:19.560]  And for my own safety, he never gave me the specifics of it, but he was in army special
[13:19.560 --> 13:23.720]  operations and, you know, a high level directly communicating with the White House because
[13:23.720 --> 13:27.000]  he was the guy that did the Morse code, the fastest and you know, the rest of us, so he
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.560]  was in charge.
[13:28.560 --> 13:31.800]  And even back then they still use Morse code because nobody can basically crack the special
[13:31.800 --> 13:36.520]  codes they use and things, they still use low tech on the submarines, a lot of things.
[13:36.520 --> 13:38.320]  That's that super secret.
[13:38.320 --> 13:46.640]  But the point is, is that he told me when I was young, starting at about 13 when I would
[13:46.640 --> 13:51.320]  go down every summer from Dallas and visit them for a week or two to visit my cousin
[13:51.320 --> 13:58.120]  to San Antonio, he basically, you know, taught me how to, you know, cow ate the cabbage.
[13:58.120 --> 14:02.520]  And so I really understood a lot of things because of that.
[14:02.520 --> 14:06.280]  And my dad was also really big on history and things.
[14:06.280 --> 14:10.120]  So I would ask him about something to present ski in the new world order and things.
[14:10.120 --> 14:16.440]  And so that's really why I know that was because of William Forrest Hammond, my uncle, is really
[14:16.440 --> 14:19.120]  the main reason we have Alex today.
[14:19.120 --> 14:21.280]  And where do you think we're going to go next, Alex?
[14:21.280 --> 14:24.440]  And you know, it's interesting that you and I have sort of similar upbringings.
[14:24.440 --> 14:29.640]  My mom's younger brother was into studying all of the things about the Illuminati and
[14:29.640 --> 14:32.760]  about the Council on Four Relations and all of those things.
[14:32.760 --> 14:36.080]  So when I was a teenager, I remember sitting around the dining room table with my mom's
[14:36.080 --> 14:39.680]  younger brother and my mom and my dad talking about all these things.
[14:39.680 --> 14:42.260]  I must have been maybe in my teens.
[14:42.260 --> 14:47.920]  So you know, as this whole thing unfolded, I've got a big library upstairs of much older
[14:47.920 --> 14:51.960]  books that I don't even think they're in print anymore from listening to that growing
[14:51.960 --> 14:52.960]  up.
[14:52.960 --> 14:53.960]  So that's pretty interesting.
[14:53.960 --> 14:57.880]  We've gotten to this point kind of with that same growing up background.
[14:57.880 --> 14:59.760]  So here we are.
[14:59.760 --> 15:04.080]  And I, how do we, you know, everybody says, how do we stop them?
[15:04.080 --> 15:09.280]  I'm not sure how we stop them other than just with more information, because I think the
[15:09.280 --> 15:10.280]  train has left the tracks.
[15:10.280 --> 15:16.680]  I mean, when you looked at that world, I agree, and the forum website, what's their next move?
[15:16.680 --> 15:18.680]  What are they going to do next?
[15:18.680 --> 15:21.880]  I'm glad you went back to your actual question as I kind of digressed into the first part
[15:21.880 --> 15:24.240]  and get to the second part.
[15:24.240 --> 15:30.880]  What you said is so key because of countless people going back to Barry Goldwater and the
[15:30.880 --> 15:34.720]  John Burt's Society and all those folks that turned out were dead on, they were the ones
[15:34.720 --> 15:36.840]  that were really prophetic.
[15:36.840 --> 15:42.160]  We, a lot of people around the country, especially in the Midwest and just all over the nation,
[15:42.160 --> 16:00.560]  really were away to what was going on as they write on here, the cry, it'd be a Thanksgiving
[16:00.560 --> 16:01.760]  2022 is here.
[16:01.760 --> 16:04.480]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[16:04.480 --> 16:10.360]  Now, the news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[16:10.360 --> 16:14.640]  The bad news is by Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[16:14.640 --> 16:17.000]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.840]  So now is the time to take action to support the Info War and get the biggest sales of
[16:20.840 --> 16:21.840]  the year.
[16:21.840 --> 16:26.600]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and BioTrue Selenium and our Wake Up America award-winning
[16:26.600 --> 16:27.600]  coffee.
[16:27.600 --> 16:32.880]  And now, DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Real Fusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, so many other
[16:32.880 --> 16:38.640]  great products like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso Beats, Secret 12, they are
[16:38.640 --> 16:42.520]  all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[16:42.520 --> 16:45.280]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[16:45.280 --> 16:50.480]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at infowarstore.com, promo code 1776
[16:50.480 --> 16:55.520]  and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at infowarstore.com.
[16:55.520 --> 17:00.200]  Thank you so much for your support and God bless.
[17:00.200 --> 17:04.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals of the year starting in mid-November
[17:04.200 --> 17:05.200]  through Christmas.
[17:05.200 --> 17:10.960]  But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[17:10.960 --> 17:18.760]  Not just up to 60% off with promo code 1776, but on top of it, double Patriot points and
[17:18.760 --> 17:21.360]  what makes this the most special sale ever.
[17:21.360 --> 17:26.520]  Every order will get a free gift, no matter how small or how big, and it's all randomly
[17:26.520 --> 17:30.040]  selected by the shopping cart computer.
[17:30.040 --> 17:32.320]  So you might order a sticker pack for $5.
[17:32.320 --> 17:39.160]  You might order the blowout t-shirt sale for $495 and then get something worth $50, $60,
[17:39.160 --> 17:40.600]  $70, $80.
[17:40.600 --> 17:45.160]  So again, some of the gifts are sticker packs, some of them are Alex Jones, Halloween masks,
[17:45.160 --> 17:49.440]  some of them are books, films, Info Wars flags, American flags.
[17:49.440 --> 17:51.200]  There are hundreds of different items.
[17:51.200 --> 17:56.160]  It's all random, infowarstore.com, every order gets a free gift.
[17:56.160 --> 17:59.160]  Free gifts for every order at infowarstore.com.
[17:59.160 --> 18:02.240]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[18:02.240 --> 18:03.480]  Why is this taking so long?
[18:03.480 --> 18:07.000]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.320]  Why can't we do this here?
[18:08.320 --> 18:10.800]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[18:10.800 --> 18:15.080]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump
[18:15.080 --> 18:16.920]  or Governor DeSaint Demonius.
[18:16.920 --> 18:20.760]  They're going to deny us Michigan, they're going to deny us Pennsylvania, they're going
[18:20.760 --> 18:27.560]  to deny us Arizona, and I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[18:27.560 --> 18:33.080]  where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[18:33.080 --> 18:37.160]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[18:37.160 --> 18:40.120]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[18:40.120 --> 18:42.680]  Communications are the reason why we did well.
[18:42.680 --> 18:46.320]  That's why infowars.com is so damn important.
[18:46.320 --> 18:49.720]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[18:49.720 --> 18:51.840]  People need to get behind Info Wars.
[18:51.840 --> 18:57.040]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[18:57.040 --> 19:00.200]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[19:00.200 --> 19:04.880]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support Info Wars and
[19:04.880 --> 19:05.880]  band.video.
[19:05.880 --> 19:10.240]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you, I'm going to do that right now.
[19:10.240 --> 19:14.000]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.200]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[19:19.200 --> 19:24.200]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones,
[19:24.200 --> 19:28.400]  including myself, I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because
[19:28.400 --> 19:29.400]  of this platform.
[19:29.400 --> 19:33.480]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex
[19:33.480 --> 19:34.480]  Jones.
[19:34.480 --> 19:38.600]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super
[19:38.600 --> 19:39.600]  Tim Cass IRL.
[19:39.600 --> 19:45.600]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because you
[19:45.600 --> 19:47.800]  don't know what you have until it's gone.
[19:47.800 --> 19:50.600]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[19:50.600 --> 19:55.440]  So go check out the store, go support their store, go support Info Wars, leave a donation
[19:55.440 --> 19:56.440]  right now.
[19:56.440 --> 20:00.600]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[20:00.600 --> 20:30.560]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:30.560 --> 20:34.800]  A lot of people around the country, especially in the Midwest and just all over the nation
[20:34.800 --> 20:43.160]  really were away to what was going on in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s back when it was just embryonic
[20:43.160 --> 20:46.320]  because there were a lot of people in the system that were being inducted into this
[20:46.320 --> 20:50.720]  tyranny who didn't like it, who were whistleblowers and who came out and exposed it.
[20:50.720 --> 20:55.120]  So everything we're seeing today is what they said was coming because they were attempting
[20:55.120 --> 20:58.440]  to basically set up the programs for it back then.
[20:58.440 --> 21:04.360]  So a lot of those internal folks in government corporations, in the medical system, in the
[21:04.360 --> 21:11.920]  clergy, in the educational system held it back for decades and decades.
[21:11.920 --> 21:19.440]  And so now because there was such a backstop against it of people working for 60, 70 years
[21:19.440 --> 21:22.880]  quietly or as loud as they could, it being suppressed, it was still pretty quiet.
[21:22.880 --> 21:27.760]  As you said, you whispered here and there, pamphlets, books, a few films here and there.
[21:27.760 --> 21:30.360]  We weren't caught completely flat footed.
[21:30.360 --> 21:35.600]  And so in the last five years, the globalists have gone from denying all their programs
[21:35.600 --> 21:40.520]  to taking the mask off now and just emerging with you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing,
[21:40.520 --> 21:41.520]  you'll like it.
[21:41.520 --> 21:44.880]  You'll have a World ID card, you'll have a microchip to buy and sell, this is all being
[21:44.880 --> 21:46.720]  officially announced everywhere.
[21:46.720 --> 21:51.480]  In an attempt to where if they couldn't covertly implement it, they'll go ahead and just overtly
[21:51.480 --> 21:52.480]  implement it.
[21:52.480 --> 21:55.880]  But there was always a point where you would have emergence.
[21:55.880 --> 22:00.000]  I mean, even if you're going to have, say, an army sneak attack a position, okay, they
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.520]  sneak up, they get in position, but there finally comes the point of the attack.
[22:04.520 --> 22:09.840]  And so we're now gone from the beta testing into their operational system.
[22:09.840 --> 22:16.440]  So what comes next is more bioweapon releases from labs, which we now know COVID was, and
[22:16.440 --> 22:22.480]  now creating the backstory of at Boston University humanized mice that again, as you know, is
[22:22.480 --> 22:27.160]  going to act just like humans, basically the same death rate would be in humans, they estimate
[22:27.160 --> 22:30.440]  of 80%, a super gain of function weapon.
[22:30.440 --> 22:35.000]  They now develop similar systems in London, broke last week as well.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.280]  So they're even letting us know where the weapons are that they've indeed made them,
[22:39.280 --> 22:43.760]  and they've got a gun to our collective heads, trying to hold us hostage, threatening to
[22:43.760 --> 22:47.520]  basically release these if we don't accept their new world order.
[22:47.520 --> 22:52.280]  And so the whole COVID rollout was the segue from baited operational with the FEMA camps
[22:52.280 --> 22:57.280]  being built here, the COVID centers around the world, all UN policy directed policies
[22:57.280 --> 23:02.240]  created by the WEF itself is just a spokesperson group of the Bilderberg group, Klaus Schwab
[23:02.240 --> 23:07.480]  has been on their steering committee since the 70s, except the WEF in the 80s, WEF emerged
[23:07.480 --> 23:08.480]  in the 90s.
[23:08.480 --> 23:16.080]  And as the forward facing PR firm of global governance, corporate fascist, a controlled
[23:16.080 --> 23:17.800]  ally with communist China.
[23:17.800 --> 23:21.960]  So the next phase is they always telegraph they're going to do cyber attacks, they blame
[23:21.960 --> 23:26.080]  on the Russians or private groups to have intermittent power outages and disruptions
[23:26.080 --> 23:32.480]  to sell an internet ID and more control, the name of keeping us safe from hackers.
[23:32.480 --> 23:40.040]  More viral releases, more attempts at lockdowns, more attempts at forced injections and testing
[23:40.040 --> 23:45.240]  with these injections progressively getting more toxic, more poisonous, more dangerous
[23:45.240 --> 23:50.760]  to see if they can manage the maiming and killing of us as the ambient background noise
[23:50.760 --> 23:54.400]  of the soft kill weapons are turned up.
[23:54.400 --> 23:59.160]  That's why it's so beautiful what you and countless others, but you at the tip of the
[23:59.160 --> 24:04.400]  spear, with just a few other top people have done mobilizing against it, is they're asking
[24:04.400 --> 24:08.200]  as you know in Atlantic monthly two weeks ago, which is the globalist mouthpiece for
[24:08.200 --> 24:11.880]  an amnesty, oh, we're sorry about lockdowns, we're sorry about masks, we're sorry about
[24:11.880 --> 24:16.240]  the shot not working, as they still try to push it on school children, as they try to
[24:16.240 --> 24:20.520]  make it quote federally recommended, so they can then bully people and claim it's mandatory
[24:20.520 --> 24:22.600]  through that fraud as you know.
[24:22.600 --> 24:26.920]  And so they now want us to forget about what they just did the last three years, so that
[24:26.920 --> 24:31.880]  we have that collective amnesia so they can do it again, but on a much more deadly scale.
[24:31.880 --> 24:35.720]  What we've been through in the last three years is a drill for martial law lockdowns
[24:35.720 --> 24:40.920]  when they release the really deadly bio weapons with a cocktail of other things.
[24:40.920 --> 24:47.840]  They can hit a city with a chemical weapon that has a slow kill effect and that mimics
[24:47.840 --> 24:53.880]  viruses or bacterial infections and then claim it's that as well, so they've got a lot of
[24:53.880 --> 24:55.600]  different battle plans.
[24:55.600 --> 25:02.120]  The Sunshine Project 15 years ago out of Austin got a document that had been declassified
[25:02.120 --> 25:07.120]  by the Federation of American Scientists and in it the Marine Corps was training with
[25:07.120 --> 25:13.880]  the Army with drone helicopters to have helicopters go around and spray opiates on cities and
[25:13.880 --> 25:19.160]  quote make everybody pass out so the government can bring in martial law, the estimated that
[25:19.160 --> 25:23.960]  over 10% of the public would actually die in accidents, fires and car wrecks when they
[25:23.960 --> 25:26.760]  did spray the cities with the chemical weapons.
[25:26.760 --> 25:30.680]  So we have real things like that actually on the books.
[25:30.680 --> 25:33.920]  The shadow government is not our friend as Dr. Peter McCuller wrote a big article two
[25:33.920 --> 25:34.920]  days ago.
[25:34.920 --> 25:36.720]  I just interviewed him yesterday for two hours.
[25:36.720 --> 25:37.720]  That's it.
[25:37.720 --> 25:40.760]  Band up video and he comes out now.
[25:40.760 --> 25:43.880]  He knew this two years ago when he first came on my show but said he wasn't ready to go
[25:43.880 --> 25:46.160]  public yet like you had done.
[25:46.160 --> 25:51.480]  He took the gloves off and said no, shadow global government is in control of the Pentagon.
[25:51.480 --> 25:55.680]  The Pentagon has run the roll out of the shots through the UN through Pfizer through Moderna
[25:55.680 --> 26:01.080]  through Bill Gates and is actually attacking its own people and attacking our troops particularly.
[26:01.080 --> 26:06.840]  So it's not our military per se but it's the military complex that Eisenhower warned
[26:06.840 --> 26:13.520]  of that is actually directly working for the central banks that is carrying all this out.
[26:13.520 --> 26:14.520]  Yes, absolutely.
[26:14.520 --> 26:18.080]  There's two things that you said in there that I want to circle back to and ask you
[26:18.080 --> 26:19.080]  about.
[26:19.080 --> 26:23.960]  I mean one is when you said that this was a kind of a warm up round for what they have
[26:23.960 --> 26:29.800]  next which I've kind of said the same thing in a lot of my interviews and podcasts.
[26:29.800 --> 26:35.640]  I had been told by somebody early on like this would have been in 2020 that this and
[26:35.640 --> 26:39.960]  the first article that I wrote in March 2020 after this stuff rolled out was same playbook
[26:39.960 --> 26:40.960]  different virus.
[26:40.960 --> 26:46.400]  That was the first article that I wrote and I had been told that you know that they thought
[26:46.400 --> 26:52.000]  to the WF creatures I call them thought that this was just another trial balloon to see
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.040]  where they were on that continuum along that plan that they had because they had SARS then
[26:58.040 --> 27:04.040]  they had MERS and they had bird flu in 2005 they had H1N1 in 2009 and this was just another
[27:04.040 --> 27:08.320]  toss it out there and see where we are and that the reason that they went full court
[27:08.320 --> 27:14.760]  press was because the Americans rolled over that Americans just put on a mask, closed
[27:14.760 --> 27:20.840]  their businesses, cowered down and feared in their corner and that the Americans didn't
[27:20.840 --> 27:26.600]  say no way and I just was talking I was at one of Clay Clark's events two weeks ago and
[27:26.600 --> 27:30.520]  I talked to somebody who had spent the last five months in Europe talking to pretty high
[27:30.520 --> 27:36.520]  level people in throughout the EU and she said every single country that she went to
[27:36.520 --> 27:41.680]  and talked to high level officials she said the first thing out of their mouth was where
[27:41.680 --> 27:48.040]  the hell are the Americans you know why what where are we and you know it Alex you know
[27:48.040 --> 27:52.360]  it's true I mean everybody hears it they go yeah yeah yeah whatever I think part of it
[27:52.360 --> 27:56.280]  is because there's not enough pain here yet they tried to induce pain with the increase
[27:56.280 --> 28:01.480]  of gas prices you know people still have food they still have heat they still have their
[28:01.480 --> 28:07.240]  businesses whatever where do you think that is where the hell are the Americans in this
[28:07.240 --> 28:13.320]  battle well I want to answer that but going back to what you said about how this is the
[28:13.320 --> 28:18.840]  same playbook different virus we know from operation lockstep 2011 and the tabletop exercises
[28:18.840 --> 28:25.080]  in 2019 event 201 that they've been beta testing and drilling this if you go back to a year
[28:25.080 --> 28:29.800]  and a half before they released the virus out of Wuhan and then the more deadly shot
[28:29.800 --> 28:35.880]  remember that they were saying over the news disease X is coming and when it comes we're

[30:15.960 --> 30:22.280]  it's not election day and that's the problem and everything changed after covet nineteen they
[30:22.280 --> 30:29.000]  illegally changed state elections uh mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes
[30:29.000 --> 30:34.120]  mailing multiple ballots to people well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious
[30:34.120 --> 30:39.480]  country when we have elections that can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe

[30:45.320 --> 30:51.400]  the media and the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity and question the
[30:51.400 --> 30:57.640]  the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election

[33:45.880 --> 34:06.760]  and you look at spars 2025 2028 war game from two years before they released the virus was
[34:06.760 --> 34:13.880]  2018 if you look at that multi hundred page document it even has example tweets of what
[34:13.880 --> 34:19.720]  they would put out and it's really set in the year 2020 2023 and and how they would roll it out
[34:19.720 --> 34:23.720]  and how people would learn they were being poisoned and the tweets are basically the exact same
[34:23.720 --> 34:30.120]  tweets even the same acronyms they just switch them around and so they were using that as a battle
[34:30.120 --> 34:35.880]  plan for their whole scripted operation that way they get caught with it oh it's just a drill
[34:35.880 --> 34:41.240]  it's just a tabletop exercise they're not caught with their actual battle plan that's just set in
[34:41.240 --> 34:48.760]  2020 2023 but what was your other question um what how do we get americans more engaged in this i mean
[34:48.760 --> 34:54.680]  when we look at i mean we had the truckers going all across canada you know we had uh when you look
[34:54.680 --> 34:59.400]  at the the farmers that happened in the netherlands and what they did and they they put manure all over
[34:59.400 --> 35:03.640]  everybody i mean we have huge and i'll tell you how it happened i'll tell you how it happened
[35:03.640 --> 35:08.600]  the perfect scyop and i'm not saying trump's a bad person would take an hour to analyze why he
[35:08.600 --> 35:13.880]  did it just like he was for regeneron and just like he was for adroxychloroquine and just like he
[35:13.880 --> 35:20.360]  was for ivermectin he just trusted the doctors and said just legalize everything accelerate everything
[35:21.080 --> 35:27.560]  which they acted like was his plan but we know from a 2018 meeting the Fauci had on c-span
[35:27.560 --> 35:32.920]  they said we want to blow up the old system we want to bring in mRNA we don't want a five-year
[35:32.920 --> 35:39.080]  or ten-year test it'll probably be a virus out of china something that's respiratory that they
[35:39.080 --> 35:44.440]  were telling people what they were doing at this big consortium meeting with dhs heads and cdc heads
[35:44.440 --> 35:48.760]  and others and and and they were describing how they're going to use probably a respiratory virus
[35:48.760 --> 35:56.440]  out of china as the pretext to bring in this regime and about a week ago it broke uh that the
[35:56.440 --> 36:03.640]  national security council uh was under the cdc and others rolling out in 2000 a plan that had been
[36:03.640 --> 36:09.160]  created in the last decade before and what they believe perfected so as you said they had this
[36:09.160 --> 36:16.440]  on the shelf they were ready for this it's on record they did uh and so when trump went along
[36:16.440 --> 36:25.320]  with the initial phase of it and americans saw all the fear at first a lot of republicans went along
[36:25.320 --> 36:30.760]  with trump for the first few months then trump began to figure it out and began to say hey we
[36:30.760 --> 36:34.440]  probably don't need to keep lockdowns going hey you shouldn't have to take a shot but the shuttle
[36:34.440 --> 36:39.320]  hopefully protect you because you want to reopen things and then the democrats made it political
[36:39.320 --> 36:44.440]  oh look trump doesn't want to reopen i mean trump wants to reopen he wants to kill you they became
[36:44.440 --> 36:50.440]  the party of pushing the whole agenda which was always scripted as a galleon dialectic so
[36:50.440 --> 36:57.160]  trump got americans to stand down uh first polosi's like oh no don't lock down china town oh no
[36:57.160 --> 37:01.320]  everything's fine knowing that trump would then politically want to be the savior
[37:01.320 --> 37:06.840]  it was all psychology because they had this all wargamed they'd all profiled trump he would come
[37:06.840 --> 37:12.040]  in and support it until he figured out that it was basically a political trap and so it was donald
[37:12.040 --> 37:17.240]  trump uh that basically helped put america to sleep then they made it a political issue left
[37:17.240 --> 37:23.640]  versus right and the left used trump hate to push it as a political agenda to keep things locked down
[37:23.640 --> 37:28.440]  and so the lockdowns the deadly shots the surveillance the vaccine passports became a
[37:28.440 --> 37:33.800]  sacrament of the left now and their new religion uh and so they were already able to convert
[37:34.680 --> 37:40.920]  30 40 percent of the population into being part of the big pharma uh stockhome syndrome cult
[37:40.920 --> 37:46.600]  and that's how the psychological warfare the galleon dialectic was used very well stated alex
[37:46.600 --> 37:53.160]  that's very very well stated do you think trump will ever denounce the shots no he you know his
[37:53.160 --> 37:57.640]  strength going up against the globalist is that he's so pigheaded they couldn't make him do what
[37:57.640 --> 38:05.240]  they wanted but then he will he and he does go with his ego first and so once he committed
[38:06.360 --> 38:09.720]  and saying the shot will help you and it's great this is greatest accomplishment
[38:09.720 --> 38:19.160]  when his listeners boo him in dallas uh and in cleveland uh and in uh you know all over the places
[38:19.160 --> 38:25.480]  everywhere when they boo him in arizona he quit promoting it and said i'm not supposed to say
[38:25.480 --> 38:29.560]  the v word but i'm still really proud of it and it's great and it works even though
[38:29.560 --> 38:34.200]  the democrats in the left admit now it doesn't work in fact gets you more infected and so
[38:34.200 --> 38:39.160]  so that's how trump is and i've i've gotten messages trump's i've got videos to trump
[38:39.720 --> 38:44.440]  i've got reports right challenge even the last three months to him he called me he calls usually
[38:44.440 --> 38:50.440]  like one in the morning so i've missed a few of his calls and he told some two people that
[38:50.440 --> 38:55.800]  met with him who brought him my ultimatum my my friendly two different ultimatums one was like
[38:55.800 --> 39:01.000]  five minutes one was about eight minutes laying out the fact showing him how they manipulated
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.440]  him showing him how he's going to get saddled with this and he can be a real hero like the sanas
[39:06.440 --> 39:10.040]  who got conned at first but you know it's now come out and said you shouldn't take the shot the
[39:10.040 --> 39:14.760]  surgeon general and said it hurts children and it's all a big lie basically as long as he
[39:15.800 --> 39:21.560]  stops them trying to force it on kids now and makes that an issue we will forgive him but if he
[39:21.560 --> 39:27.160]  continues down this road it's very very hard to support him and he said i don't want to hear about
[39:27.160 --> 39:33.640]  this again and i don't and and and i don't want to basically hear from alex again until he changes
[39:33.640 --> 39:43.560]  his mind i'm right about this and i've confirmed that he now screams uh at uh don jr he screams at
[39:44.520 --> 39:49.880]  obviously trump has got a big temper uh if you bring it up to him he starts screaming
[39:49.880 --> 39:54.360]  and banging his fists on the table and so he is pigheaded and totally committed to this
[39:54.360 --> 39:59.160]  because he doesn't want to admit he got conned he doesn't want to admit he got manipulated
[39:59.160 --> 40:04.200]  and that really is why people like judge henry and palatano don't support trump anymore he he
[40:04.200 --> 40:09.800]  means well he's a good man did a lot of great stuff but he is somebody that will not admit when
[40:09.800 --> 40:15.640]  he's wrong he just cannot do it that's you know it reminds me of that expression that says it's
[40:15.640 --> 40:23.080]  easier to uh fool a man than it is to convince him that he's been fooled you know and and it would be
[40:23.080 --> 40:29.160]  such a big person thing for him to say you know what i mean fauci himself and berks have come out
[40:29.160 --> 40:33.240]  and berks are self in her book i mean what to talk about self-incriminating book i mean where's the
[40:33.240 --> 40:38.600]  doj just arresting her from her book saying yeah we lied to the president we made it out that's
[40:38.600 --> 40:43.480]  exactly what i told trump that that's what i related to him in a letter and two videos that i got
[40:44.600 --> 40:48.280]  the first time he said i want to hear about him or the second time he blew up i mean i got i've
[40:48.280 --> 40:53.320]  talked to well-known names that went in and showed him on an ipad these videos and he watched them at
[40:53.320 --> 40:59.240]  marlago uh and just blew up the second time and what you said is so key that's what i said to
[40:59.240 --> 41:04.040]  in the videos that are also public videos you know emergency messages to trump i mean there's several
[41:04.040 --> 41:08.120]  of them out there from a few months ago once from about four months ago once from about three months
[41:08.120 --> 41:11.880]  ago that kind of gave up at that point because he's still doing good getting some good republicans
[41:11.880 --> 41:15.720]  elected and things so i'm not going to war with trump it's just very very sad but what you said
[41:15.720 --> 41:20.840]  is key i said sir the head of the cdc has come out and said she was wrong fouchy said he's wrong
[41:20.840 --> 41:25.640]  they're getting ahead of it and rats leaving the sinking ship now they're asking for amnesty i mean
[41:25.640 --> 41:31.240]  that just happened but see he doesn't get it and that's exactly what i told him you know he would be
[41:31.240 --> 41:38.200]  the forever generational hero if he came out and said i listened to these people they lied to me
[41:38.200 --> 41:44.600]  and now that i know differently here's what we need to do you know and and that would change everything
[41:44.600 --> 41:49.000]  but his greatest strength is his greatest weakness when they're threatening you know to not get out
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.720]  of yanesco are they threatening to not turn on pipelines are they threatening to not control
[41:53.720 --> 41:59.480]  the border and they threaten him to not you know get rid of the uh tariffs keeping american jobs
[41:59.480 --> 42:04.680]  you know overseas uh these are internal tariffs and scams he's great there so it's his greatest
[42:04.680 --> 42:11.640]  weakness it's his greatest strength and greatest weakness yeah sadly with um very powerful people
[42:11.640 --> 42:16.600]  that's generally true speaking of powerful people i want to go back to the world economic forum for
[42:16.600 --> 42:21.880]  a minute um because there are a lot of people that you know we see on the front lines like we see
[42:21.880 --> 42:28.520]  we see fouchy we see you know bill gates we see you know claus schwaab and and um a lot of us and
[42:28.520 --> 42:33.240]  i know you feel the same way is like they're they're just like the spokespersons who are the people
[42:33.240 --> 42:38.200]  behind the scenes pulling their strings do you have any insight into that from all of your connections
[42:38.200 --> 43:06.920]  until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died in
[43:06.920 --> 43:13.320]  many cases in the winter because of something called vapors they associated these poisonous
[43:13.320 --> 43:19.720]  vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people
[43:19.720 --> 43:27.800]  what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body
[43:27.800 --> 43:33.720]  produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3
[43:33.720 --> 43:37.560]  and then it's very easy for viruses and other things you start replicating and taking your
[43:37.560 --> 43:42.200]  body over so now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality
[43:42.200 --> 43:47.400]  vitamin d3 and we have the best with our vitamin d3 gummies with calcium for better upload into
[43:47.400 --> 43:55.000]  your body for 50 off at infowarstore.com with promo code 1776 don't wait support the info war
[43:55.000 --> 44:01.240]  and your immune system with vitamin d3 gummies at infowarstore.com so when i first started taking
[44:01.240 --> 44:06.360]  survival shield basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't
[44:06.360 --> 44:11.240]  believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to
[44:11.240 --> 44:15.880]  it so the first one i got was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good
[44:15.880 --> 44:19.480]  and then shortly thereafter you came out with that stew you had you know with a deep burn
[44:19.480 --> 44:24.040]  source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and man in two weeks i went from
[44:24.040 --> 44:30.120]  brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know i could think again i could
[44:30.120 --> 44:35.480]  connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back and
[44:35.480 --> 44:39.800]  i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all absolutely amazing
[44:39.800 --> 44:44.280]  supplements the one i like recently is knockout it literally like if you want to sleep just take
[44:44.280 --> 44:49.080]  it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break
[44:49.080 --> 44:53.960]  free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own
[44:53.960 --> 45:00.840]  hair beautifully said brother i thank you so much for calling godspeed everybody that's watching this
[45:00.840 --> 45:06.840]  needs to support alex jones needs to support info wars and band dot video you know the bible says
[45:06.840 --> 45:12.680]  let another mouth praise you i'm gonna do that right now alex jones has helped so many people in
[45:12.680 --> 45:17.880]  this industry you guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like savannah
[45:17.880 --> 45:23.400]  hernandez how many people have just been put on a launch pad the outer space because of alex
[45:23.400 --> 45:28.120]  jones including myself i've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because
[45:28.120 --> 45:32.680]  of this platform and i would probably not even be half of where i am right now if it weren't
[45:32.680 --> 45:37.560]  for alex jones i mean i've been able to be on podcasts with alex and joe rogan and tim cast
[45:37.560 --> 45:44.280]  the super tim cast irl listen what i'm saying is do not take alex jones and band dot video for
[45:44.280 --> 45:49.560]  granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone we need to support free speech systems
[45:49.560 --> 45:55.080]  right now so go check out the store go support their store go support info wars leave a donation
[45:55.080 --> 46:03.960]  right now don't wait until they're gone in arizona i think we watched the election be stolen slowly
[46:03.960 --> 46:11.000]  stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our
[46:11.000 --> 46:18.120]  election seriously when we we just it's election month alex it's not election day and that's the
[46:18.120 --> 46:24.680]  problem and everything changed after covet nineteen they illegally changed state elections
[46:25.560 --> 46:31.080]  mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people
[46:31.080 --> 46:35.720]  well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country when we have elections that
[46:35.720 --> 46:41.400]  can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe the election was stolen in 2020
[46:41.400 --> 46:47.160]  and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and the democrats to attack
[46:47.160 --> 46:54.120]  us that that question our election integrity and question the the fact that elections shouldn't be
[46:54.120 --> 47:01.880]  run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election realists leading a frontal assault
[47:01.880 --> 47:20.600]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human
[47:20.600 --> 47:35.960]  liberty it's alex jones who are the people behind the scenes pulling their strings do you have any
[47:35.960 --> 47:41.640]  insight into that from all of your connections yes first and foremost this global government
[47:42.600 --> 47:47.160]  well there's three there there's there's really three power groups there's the anglo-american
[47:47.160 --> 47:53.000]  establishment nothing to it being white it's just what the british us combined empire calls itself
[47:53.560 --> 47:59.640]  others like anglo-american oil that was bp and all the rest of it and so you got that major power
[47:59.640 --> 48:06.840]  block the british empire merged the u.s empire after world war two and the u.s came in empire
[48:06.840 --> 48:12.120]  after the spanish-american war in 1898 for those that don't know historians officially see it as
[48:12.120 --> 48:16.840]  that so that's the dominant force then you've got the russians that are a wild card and you've got
[48:16.840 --> 48:21.960]  the chinese that are allied or were allied with the anglo-american establishment of their own
[48:22.840 --> 48:30.760]  predator group and when you talk about who really runs it it really is the old royalty of europe
[48:31.800 --> 48:36.360]  that is one one breed and they're not they're not even german they're mainly
[48:38.280 --> 48:45.160]  eastern european hungarian romanian because that's the folks starting like 800 years ago
[48:45.160 --> 48:49.720]  that stopped the muslims and controlled the trade coming out of the caravans into europe
[48:50.680 --> 48:57.960]  it's all the royal main lines of i'm getting too complex of europe that that actually run things
[48:57.960 --> 49:06.600]  are a mix of eastern europeans and uh william the conqueror vikings and so a fusion of vikings
[49:06.600 --> 49:12.600]  and eastern europeans uh created the main royal sacks cobert gotha hapsburgs are all the same
[49:12.600 --> 49:18.520]  people uh bloodlines and they're dominant the roth child's got involved in that but the british
[49:18.520 --> 49:24.200]  empire they intermarried are now lords so so they've actually merged into that the rockefellers
[49:24.200 --> 49:31.000]  and the carnegies and the jp morgens uh were just their front people here in the united states and
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.440]  setting up the whole anglo-american merger and alliance that by the way uh not my opinion he wrote
[49:36.440 --> 49:41.800]  three books on it winston churchill wrote the history of the english-speaking peoples and it's
[49:41.800 --> 49:45.880]  all in there by the way that none of this is even hidden at you know academic level reading i read
[49:45.880 --> 49:49.080]  through all three of those books when i was in high school they're incredible everybody in fact i
[49:49.080 --> 49:54.520]  want to reread them if i had the time uh because it's all right there Cecil Rhodes uh by 1900 already
[49:54.520 --> 49:59.400]  had a plan for a world government uh and how they were going to merge the u.s and british empire
[49:59.400 --> 50:05.000]  they set up the council on foreign relations to do that in 1921 at crowdhouse in new york and so
[50:05.000 --> 50:13.800]  yes Henry Kissinger it's a big new brzezinski uh people like uh claus Schwab they're all just front
[50:13.800 --> 50:22.200]  people and so at the top it's these all old rich powerful families who commissioned uh the british
[50:22.200 --> 50:29.480]  royal societies in the 1850s to learn how to take control of humanity and and make humans a commodity
[50:29.480 --> 50:34.760]  and then breed humans like animals even if they would and create a caste system this is all
[50:35.320 --> 50:40.200]  galton wedgewood darwin they were all hired for that it's all in record in the eugenics society
[50:40.200 --> 50:45.400]  in the founding of the modern eugenics movement and they envisioned biometrics computers finding out
[50:45.400 --> 50:51.960]  the secrets of our cells uh even before they called themselves their projects discovered dna everything
[50:53.160 --> 50:58.440]  in the next 60 70 years they were able with this giant project to do that and their main mission
[50:58.440 --> 51:03.880]  was figure out and take control of all life on earth including humans and learn how to discover
[51:03.880 --> 51:09.080]  immortality that's obviously what the ultra rich want and how to basically become gods and so out
[51:09.080 --> 51:13.400]  of the eugenics society it was embarrassed by hitler and world war two hitler and the keiserville
[51:13.400 --> 51:19.640]  home institute were spinoff of that uh they then created the transhumanist society with uh all
[51:19.640 --> 51:26.680]  this actually his brother julian huxley and then uh once they had done that uh basically everything
[51:26.680 --> 51:32.200]  you see is a projection of that how to get control of humanity how to turn us basically into these
[51:32.200 --> 51:38.840]  bots that they decided we'd survive are basically programmable so that the elites of the world that
[51:38.840 --> 51:47.480]  we hear no oh you've all harari uh revolved no harari talking about that the future is not human
[51:47.480 --> 51:54.040]  that's a quote uh by 2047 there'll be no more humans left we'll all be cyborgs this is them
[51:54.040 --> 51:59.800]  saying this we're gonna have a digital dictatorship uh we don't believe in jesus or we don't believe in
[51:59.800 --> 52:05.800]  in in in in mohammed or you know we don't believe in god it is a quote of this but we're gonna be gods
[52:06.440 --> 52:11.240]  and microsoft and apple are gonna be god and a tiny elite are gonna be god and we won't be
[52:11.240 --> 52:17.000]  needed they're gonna get rid of the rest of us and so this is externalization of that transhumanist
[52:17.000 --> 52:23.000]  program that i expose in the seminal film in game blueprint for global enslavement that
[52:23.000 --> 52:27.880]  can still be found if you search hard enough free online uh back when google video was still around
[52:27.880 --> 52:34.360]  in in 2007 when we launched the film for free it had 80 plus million views when they got rid of
[52:34.360 --> 52:39.160]  google video then it had about 40 million views on my main youtube channel they took it down
[52:39.160 --> 52:43.800]  uh but but but you can still find some out there everybody's authorized to repost it and share it
[52:43.800 --> 52:52.840]  and do whatever you want with it but if you watch that film uh from i guess now 10 17 years ago
[52:52.840 --> 52:57.960]  hard to believe it's been that long it's all basically come true well that's because it was
[52:57.960 --> 53:02.440]  their battle plan that they were going from beta to operational right at that point and so now
[53:02.440 --> 53:08.760]  they're accelerating into this operation so to sum up your all important question in the final
[53:08.760 --> 53:13.960]  equation it is an alliance of old powerful money that wants to live forever become god the garden
[53:13.960 --> 53:22.520]  of eden for real uh and then and the promise of the serpent funding unlimited scientific uh research
[53:22.520 --> 53:29.400]  in in every level there is these groups actually financed what we know of is the whole genetic
[53:29.400 --> 53:37.240]  engineering arm uh the computer arm and the electromagnetic arm and just this entire thing
[53:37.240 --> 53:45.240]  is a huge program that the manhattan project was only one one hundredth of my estimation
[53:46.200 --> 53:51.800]  that a giant secret scientific program for the elite to live forever become god and in the process
[53:52.680 --> 53:57.640]  from the beginning they said we first must follow malthus and playdough's ideas playdough
[53:57.640 --> 54:02.440]  two thousand three hundred years ago malthus three hundred years ago of exterminating the
[54:02.440 --> 54:12.280]  majority of the public as as our survival of fetus social Darwinistic uh toll that that that it is
[54:12.280 --> 54:18.360]  their main tenant that we must first be cold to five hundred million bare minimum uh before they
[54:18.360 --> 54:25.560]  can then transcend to the godhead wow yes and i agree with all of that and boy that was a great
[54:25.560 --> 54:31.880]  way to lay that out in the history pattern um alex you know this entire year i spent this
[54:31.880 --> 54:36.440]  entire year on genesis six you know on Tuesday and Thursday night i do an online bible study
[54:36.440 --> 54:42.120]  called happy hour dr t and on Tuesday night i invite authors and pastors and you know really
[54:42.120 --> 54:46.280]  people from that perspective and we talk about god and we have an online a bible study on Tuesday
[54:46.280 --> 54:52.600]  and Thursday night and we this entire year has been about genesis six and actually about genesis
[54:52.600 --> 55:01.560]  three vif genesis three verse 15 where um god cursed satan and said you in your seed satan in your
[55:01.560 --> 55:08.360]  seed will bruise his heel her his heel meaning christ's heel and christ jesus will come from
[55:08.360 --> 55:13.720]  that bloodline the pure bloodline of the woman will smash your head and i mean that is the whole
[55:13.720 --> 55:19.400]  summary of of what we've done from the beginning of our time that that verse that one verse genesis
[55:19.400 --> 55:23.080]  chapter three verse 15 and you're the doctor you're the scientist but i think you're talking about
[55:23.080 --> 55:27.640]  mitochondrial dna no matter what they try to manipulate with our dna we still will carry
[55:27.640 --> 55:34.840]  forth the real dna yes except for the messenger rna now is slicing up our dna and the and the
[55:34.840 --> 55:41.720]  sulfide bonds that across our dna spells the word yaway from the hebrew alphabet and the
[55:41.720 --> 55:46.840]  messenger rna is going in and destroying that because they want to destroy god from the inside
[55:46.840 --> 55:51.160]  out you know when this first started in march of 2020 when i did wrote that article you know same
[55:51.160 --> 55:55.880]  playbook different virus i also sort of looked up and i said wow we got to get busy here this is
[55:55.880 --> 56:01.320]  satan's last straw you know the lord's coming back sooner than we think uh just because he you
[56:01.320 --> 56:05.960]  know jesus himself said only the father in heaven knows the day that that i will come back but you
[56:05.960 --> 56:12.760]  will know by the signs of the time you will know as in the days of noah where they bred humans and
[56:12.760 --> 56:17.960]  animals and genetic modification and like you mentioned the humanized mice and and the glow in
[56:17.960 --> 56:22.520]  the dark pigs and all these different things that they're doing was what was happening as in the
[56:22.520 --> 56:27.960]  days of noah when god came on earth and said whoa i made a mistake of this free will here i repent
[56:27.960 --> 56:34.520]  that i even even created humans we need to race the death let's erase the the plan and start over
[56:34.520 --> 56:41.240]  again so all of that stuff that we're doing this is all good versus evil it is all you know we are
[56:41.240 --> 56:45.880]  fighting powers and principalities of this greater darkness you know it's not human against human
[56:45.880 --> 56:50.680]  it's like the evil that's upon this planet that we've been fighting since uh the garden of eden
[56:50.680 --> 56:55.880]  actually and we're coming up to that point of actually all these things are being exposed and
[56:55.880 --> 57:01.560]  it's becoming clearer and clearer that there's going to be less and less gray area to pick from
[57:01.560 --> 57:06.760]  it's a black or white either you're on board with god and jesus and you're on board with that or
[57:06.760 --> 57:11.240]  you're not and in there's and it's almost like you've got your foot on one foot on the deck and
[57:11.240 --> 57:15.320]  the other foot on the boat and the boat's kind of moved with this way and you've got to either get on
[57:15.320 --> 57:21.800]  the state safe over here on the dock or you're going to get on the boat and go with god because if
[57:21.800 --> 57:26.040]  you fall in the middle there's crocodiles in the middle are going to eat you alive and notice
[57:26.040 --> 57:31.880]  that the devil always creates a counterfeit of what god says the devil loves to quote scripture but

[59:47.640 --> 01:00:02.760]  your support if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance uh yovall harari came out
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:09.160]  two weeks ago and said the elites are going to get rid of humanity we don't need you
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:15.400]  and they're creating a Noah's Ark using all the science and systems for a breakaway civilization
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:21.960]  to go underground and and and off world and humanity is going to fall away like booster
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:29.160]  rockets as we go to heaven and and so again we see satan literally fulfilling prophecy
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:35.720]  but telling his followers that they're actually going to be saved when how did a book written
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:41.640]  two thousand years ago or a book written four thousand years ago how is it all coming true
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:46.520]  because it's real and if you go to the Sumerian text that are at the same time the Jews are writing
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:52.680]  what they said it's exactly the same thing and it states it and they know it and and mainline
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:59.800]  archaeologists say well that was the cosmology of the Sumerians who are right there in the Euphrates
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:05.800]  you know area there uh in what is Iraq today where those rivers come together where there's all that
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:11.640]  great farmland where they found all those ancient civilizations they say these entities came down
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:17.560]  and manipulated the genetics of humans uh and then everything got destroyed so what whatever
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:22.920]  people think it is but but the the globalists know this like take the movie Prometheus which is
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:29.720]  the uh prequel to alien and then I was reading where the director said oh this is what I really believe
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:34.440]  and then that's what most of the globalists believe they know evolution didn't happen
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.760]  they know that uh you don't you know have a bunch of sand or a bunch of salt water and
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:44.600]  suddenly you get a cell you know that has billions of working parts that's all just made up and and
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:50.680]  so they all know full well what's going on and they've got a project to become god just as the
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:57.560]  serpent said in the garden eat of the sample this knowledge and you will then try to be god and so
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:04.600]  I would call it the god project they're trying to build this into themselves being god they're
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:10.680]  in rebellion against god but we are made in the image of god little g when we follow god's plan
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:15.320]  then there's a long-term program for communion with god you know as we go to the next level
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.280]  that's in god's program but satan says no I've got a shortcut for you over here but
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.880]  well you have to kill most of the people and have pedophilia and world government create all these
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:30.680]  abominations in the process which are all affronts to god that are all meant to hurt god because god
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:36.520]  loves us all more than we love our children because we are god's children and so god gave us free will
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:41.240]  because god gave us that great gift just like a man and woman have a child even though they don't
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.320]  one day that child's gonna die or or you know that child might be in a car wreck or might get
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.960]  cancer you still love each other so much you want that child to love them you you give birth to them
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.840]  because you instinctively spiritually know it's an eternal spirit and that body is only one
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.000]  manifestation in this dimension of what's going to happen and this isn't taught in the main line
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.520]  churches but it was taught by the ancients it was taught by the Hebrews this is all there in the
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:11.160]  bible but again they in the last 200 years I had some of the globalist proto organizations
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:16.120]  go in and take control of the churches and and basically dumb it down so that people aren't
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.880]  seeing how the bible is literally an owner's manual literally a survival manual because I don't
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:28.760]  want to say god cheated but god gave us free will but also said hey don't play in the street
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:32.600]  and this is how you should operate this is how she should work and I'm here and I'm here to hold
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.440]  your hand and when the holy spirit comes that's god trying to hold your hand now if you pull away
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:41.560]  and don't want to have god direct you then that's what god god god god's very sad and that happens
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:46.440]  so that's really where we are it is an owner's manual god gave us ownership of the planet
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.840]  you know Satan's in control of it via fraud if we just reach you know into our destiny and connect
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.560]  to god we'll be given total dominion over the earth yes the devil's gonna come yes he's gonna

[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:50.760]  absolutely well with all of my deep dive guests because this is a an interview that we don't
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:56.440]  usually do very often we don't really usually pull back the curtain and find out more about
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:01.560]  who these people are like who is alex jones so let's start with where you were born and
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.480]  what was your childhood kind of like and when you went to college how did you decide to become
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:11.800]  to go into broadcasting well i mean it i could tell the whole story i've taken a long time but
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.160]  just the basics is this i was born in dallas and i grew up in a suburb outside dallas rockwall
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:25.960]  and uh i had uh my mom's brother that had worked in clandestine operations was a really great guy
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:31.000]  he died a few years ago who basically educated me early on how the world worked i had a lot of other
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.720]  family it was also very well read i was a jock but at the same time i very early on like comic books
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:43.240]  and science fiction and i was a really good reader so i was reading you know like a 12th grade level
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:50.040]  when i was uh 10 years old wow and so and so i started reading history books uh just because
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:55.000]  they were so interesting and so i read hundreds and hundreds of history books by the time i was out of
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:00.280]  out of high school and then i didn't know what i wanted to go to college for and so i thought
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:04.760]  well i'll just take some community college you take a wide range of courses and see what i like
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:09.480]  and i went to austin community college for about a year and a half and i you know had jobs and things
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:16.360]  was already doing well and like sales uh at a gym and so i was seeing how i was already making more
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:21.800]  money uh than the so-called professors they're at the school so i was that kind of woke me up when
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:27.880]  i was you know like 19 years old and then i just noticed no matter what class i was in whether it
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.520]  was texas history or us history or whether it was the math classes or whatever it was because
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:36.440]  when you first go to college to make you taste these you know these basics it was all very
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.880]  anti-american and then i went sat in on some ut classes was i was thinking about enrolling there
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:46.920]  and it was even more anti-american and i went and looked at their rtf operation because i was thinking
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:50.840]  about getting into radio television film because i wanted to talk about american freedom because
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:55.880]  the tearing i saw in the colleges and they were teaching stuff in rtf then uh that was 10 years
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:01.960]  behind wasn't anything anything about the internet nothing about all these things i knew about and so
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:09.400]  i thought you know i've got a job in sales and i'm doing better than most people college degrees
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:16.360]  and i said i think i'll just you know not go to about 20 years old then and then i began to watch
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:21.800]  access tv in austin is where access tv actually began here had very nice studios a lot of hosts
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:29.000]  a big audience and so i would see people on there playing jean bern griffin clips and
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.760]  ted gunterson clips and talking about the new world order uh and and you know things like that and
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:40.120]  the massacre at waco and i knew these people were really smart knew what they were talking about so
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:44.920]  i went and visited my uncle in san antonio and i said you know i think i'm gonna do an access tv
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.600]  show and i think i'm gonna fight the new world order he said that's a great idea so i started
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:53.400]  the access tv show uh i started going down there there's only a few classes you had to take in late
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:13:00.600]  94 in 95 sort of being a guest on some of the shows in 96 in a control room going live an hour
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:05.480]  three or four nights a week there's plenty of air time i was one man's show with a camera
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:10.120]  in there punching up the show having to go live uh and really an electronic soap box
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:16.360]  and after about a year of that a local radio station was switching over to talk radio uh
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:21.320]  from rock and roll and the the program director saw me and said hey would you like a saturday night
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:26.040]  show come in this saturday and do two hours live well they just launched the talk radio and they
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.920]  had howard sternes jordan litty a bunch of other big people but they had a few local shows during
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:35.880]  the week that they launched that weren't getting any calls well when i went on that first night
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:39.640]  they had 10 phone lines and i'd have to scream to calls myself during the break you just get
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:43.560]  their name and write it down they had a boardop running things but i was even taking my own calls
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.800]  because they wanted me to at least get their name instead of just punching them up like i did on
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.560]  access tv had calls as well just you hit the buttons and you know people were there prank
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:57.560]  callers regular callers you name it and so there i was a year after being on access tv
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:01.880]  hosting a saturday night show that went from two hours to three hours and then ratings came in
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:06.600]  in a few months it had high ratings they gave me a sunday night show too about six months later
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:12.680]  they gave me a weeknight show they got higher ratings uh than howard stern and and geord litty
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:17.320]  wow and the big and the big lineup they had and they said well she's not going to pay you
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:22.360]  kid i was doing it for free and i said well can i become a salesman uh and some of the time i was
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:28.600]  21 22 i was already one of the top salesmen at a big talk radio station and i was already uh you
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.880]  know making a couple hundred thousand dollars a year and i thought i want to make films this is

[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:18.040]  actually reached out to syndicators i met with a few big national syndicators and then they said

[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:18.440]  thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:24.280]  the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible it made any resistance to it possible
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:30.280]  was people continuing to support info wars despite the massive lawfare being waged against info
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:36.680]  wars despite the media defamatory libelist campaign against info wars the ordinary people
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:42.040]  the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier wealthier and wiser is
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:47.960]  what keeps info wars on the air and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:53.400]  era in an age of totalitarian oppression so continue to do it go to places like info wars
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:58.920]  store dot com go to the places like save info wars continue to keep info wars alive because in the
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:21.160]  process leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones info wars
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:31.800]  dot com is tomorrow's news today you're listening to the alex jones show uh then uh hired a pr firm
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:40.120]  when i was like 25 26 years old uh to call 2000 talk stations and send them a packet of
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:46.280]  information so the key was i spent the money i was making in sales and the money i made off the dvd
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:53.640]  and the vhs tapes that was then over a million dollars to hire a pr firm uh to send out packets
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:21:00.840]  to all the talk radio stations and i instantly in 1998 got over a hundred radio affiliates and uh
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:07.800]  was now doing this show out of a local station but suddenly it got national news i got a tax sum
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:13.160]  the station fired me because they got political pressure but i already figured that was coming
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:19.640]  so i already built a studio in my house and so by the year 2000 i had close to 200 radio affiliates
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:26.040]  out of a bedroom at my house i was then married my wife was pregnant with my first child and so
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:33.720]  i was not even 30 years old and it was on over 200 radio stations uh and i was on short way
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:40.600]  a lot of other stuff and so 9 11 came around and i really thought it was an inside job or the radical
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:45.320]  muslims had help we talked about the bombs the buildings so i went from hundreds of stations
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:52.200]  to about 40 stations in the space of a month but i didn't back down i didn't censor myself and then
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:56.840]  that really exploded the show in the underground uh and then over the years we built it back up to
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:04.840]  over 400 radio stations and it's just been a long you know hard battle i took almost all the money
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:11.160]  that i made on films and dbd sales and tried to build a news media infrastructure launched a
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:17.000]  nightly news program hired another talk show host uh in the last 14 years uh and then of course
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.800]  social media exploded in the last decade and we became the biggest show even bigger than Joe Rogan
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:27.480]  is today um by about six years ago so then they came in with the deep banking with the platform
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:34.520]  and try to shut us down we survived because we're on platforms like info wars dot com and uh being
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:39.640]  on on talk radio and some cable and tv stations and then over the last four years the attack we
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:45.400]  finally built back uh to about half the audience we had then uh and so it's it's it's really been a
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:51.560]  niche in attorney of that which does not kill you only makes you stronger and all glory goes to god
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:55.800]  and the holy spirit and god working through the listeners and viewers because lord knows
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:00.360]  you know some days i do six eight hours of broadcasting and sometimes it's a train wreck
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.920]  because it's it's it's teleprompter free and i'm a wild man but it's been a learning process
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:10.520]  and every mistake i made i would redo it now if i could except it was a learning process that
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:15.800]  made me who i am today so i could see god putting pressure on me god teaching me but only giving me
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:21.000]  what i could handle at the time so that i would be ready and battle harden the incredible stress
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.560]  and attacks that i've now entered which i've now learned are actually blessings and are actually
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:29.480]  enjoyable and and ten years ago i couldn't have handled this five years ago i couldn't have handled
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:35.800]  it but it was all god like taking the sword and beating it in like that's this or vulcan
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:41.480]  and you know they're under the volcano into something that can now uh isn't perfect it isn't
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:46.440]  perfect isn't even that great but has been through so many angles of attacks and and been through so
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:53.160]  many uh you know globalist operations that now instead of a sword info wars is more like a skeleton
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:58.200]  key that can open any door with our guests our researchers our callers our ability to make things
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:03.720]  go viral our ability to stay afloat despite all the attacks all of it was god's plan from the
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:11.160]  beginning none of it was me i was just willing wow that's a great story on all different levels
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:16.680]  alex i mean such a great inspirational story of entrepreneurship that i think that people really
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:23.240]  need to hear stories like that like yours you know that that of how you just moved from one thing to
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:27.160]  another and you didn't give up and you took the took advantage of opportunities that were sitting
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:31.960]  in front of you and you're absolutely right i mean god doesn't give us what we can handle
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:37.480]  he helps us handle what we've been given and i think that's a really important lesson i'll
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:43.720]  say that again dot god doesn't give us what we can handle he helps us to handle what we've been given
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:50.600]  when did your walk with the lord start you know mommy my parents went to church on
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:56.680]  wednesday nights and sundays and my parents are are you know serious christians uh but never really
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:03.800]  pushed it hard on me and then i saw a lot of occultism and corruption in dallas uh and then
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:07.720]  my dad sold some dental offices he owned and moved to austin's that'd always been the golds by moms
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:13.800]  from austin and my parents met at ut so they always wanted to get here uh and once i got here
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:22.760]  it was more new agey and weird and i i could say i fell away from god when i was in junior high
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:28.120]  and high school uh dallas when we went to school it was pretty rough compared to what things are
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:31.800]  today people did to shoot each other they got in fights so i was in a lot of fights i went to
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:36.120]  bully contrary to what cnn's gone back and made up stories about but i did get a lot of fights and
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:40.920]  i did get proud of myself so then you know everybody wants to fight together you know it's one of
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:46.680]  these fights or whatever so i got a lot of fights got arrested a few times uh and i never started
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:52.600]  the fights but i got arrested you know for putting people in the hospital and stuff and then um i moved
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:26:01.560]  to austin and i uh had quite a few girlfriends because i finished up a couple years of high school
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:09.720]  in austin and my dad when i was living at home like saw the bill in my room for an abortion
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.760]  and he said to me he said you know i don't want you to kill my grandchildren
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:21.000]  he said you you you you really shouldn't do that you know i ought to control yourself and uh later
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.280]  in life you're gonna wish you had been part of this because i'd i'd paid for some abortions uh
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:32.680]  but he just happened to see that bill and uh and i he already knew because a girlfriend was around
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:38.040]  uh about a year before and i guess she confided my mother uh that she'd had an abortion you know
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:41.640]  they'd come and want you know and you know they didn't want to tell their parents or whatever
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:46.520]  and they'd be like 16 17 year old girl and then you'll have an abortion my dad said you really
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.640]  need to stop killing my grandchildren and i still kept doing what i was doing for a while
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:57.880]  and then i really started having nightmares about it and really feeling a spirit of evil
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:02.360]  attacking me and that i had some important work obviously it was a holy spirit and that
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.080]  god wasn't gonna help me and that i wasn't gonna be happy if i didn't you know stop doing what i
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:14.600]  was doing and so for a few years i stopped dating and uh was already working out stuff
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:19.560]  i got really into shape started exercising started reading the bible more started watching
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:25.000]  c-span getting really into politics again in history and uh i remember my mother walking in
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.080]  when i was like 18 about to move out to high school and she goes i haven't seen a girl here
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:33.560]  in about a year are you gay because it went from like all the beauty queens of the house that was
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:38.440]  really good looking back then so like no no women around my mom goes what the hell's going on uh and
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:45.320]  uh so i moved out and i started dating some girls and you know kind of getting back into
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:49.000]  up do they get upset if you wouldn't go right to bed with them and so for about a year and a half
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:56.360]  i was pretty much celibate uh and uh just got back into politics and then literally it was like the
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:00.840]  holy spirit was you've got to fight the new world order you've got to engage these people you've
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:04.920]  got to go challenge these people you've got to do what your uncle talked about you've got to resist
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.920]  them and then in community college i was seeing it all and so it was like there's this mission and
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:14.120]  you've got to do this and you've got to challenge these people and so i was like 19 going to city
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:17.800]  council meetings i can't be able to find any video of it and county commissioner meetings
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:22.200]  getting in their face about taking farmers land for environmental land grabs and them trying to
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:30.120]  pass gun control and things so i was involved years before i got on air uh and then again uh i
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:34.840]  started the access tv show and about six months into it right before i got the call to be on talk radio
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.280]  i was sitting in a restaurant by myself at night i've ridden like a two-hour show on access tv
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:46.680]  with almost nobody's in the restaurant and i remember i'm sitting there drinking ice tea and
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:29:01.640]  eating chicken fried steak and it was like the whole future until about 150 years ago cultures
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:08.360]  all over the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:15.320]  something called vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:21.160]  wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:29.960]  of vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:35.320]  getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other

[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:09.720]  it was like a metaphysical moment where i was like at another level for about an hour in the back
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:14.600]  of this restaurant with sitting there and it was like you're gonna you're gonna take on the new

[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.480]  to understand you're gonna get destroyed in the end and it's gonna be very painful and it's gonna
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:33.640]  not be fun and i remember like i've never been in the presence of something like that i didn't see
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:38.040]  christ i didn't see an angel i was like like this download you know that people like david ight
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:42.280]  talk about and i was just like for like an hour and a half like this after i dinner like in the
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:48.600]  restaurant going what in the world's going on here and it was this sense of completion and absolute
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:54.920]  like knowing confidence beyond confidence and i remember just driving home and just like at
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:00.040]  like the top of my head had blown off and it was like this is a mission you're doing this and at
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:07.080]  that point i was like that was outside of me this is real and i was like commissioned at that point
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:11.960]  and in that moment it was like god was telling me and you stop killing the kids and you're not
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:16.040]  and you're not going to do that now and then right after that i met my wife started dating her
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:22.600]  got her pregnant we got married had my son rex is 20 years old now uh are more than 20 now time
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:29.320]  flies and so that's basically my experience with god but the being involved in the abortion i didn't
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:34.200]  i was lying to myself it's not a human it's just flesh just a blob of tissue i was convicted by
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:38.680]  the holy spirit about it first convicted by my dad the convicted by the holy spirit by it and then
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:44.360]  i stopped the sin and then literally that allowed the transmission and the connection to god but
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:50.280]  that had to be removed because before that was happening i was i was i was and i want to say
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:57.000]  depressed but dark forces were pushing energy at me and and and and and trying to push me off
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:02.280]  what i was supposed to do because the devil's not the omnipresent but the devil has foresight
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:08.360]  into the future and so there was definitely a a interdimensional spiritual whirlpool going on
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:14.360]  around me at that time and i needed god to actually get out of that whirlpool because you're either
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:20.520]  with god or with the devil uh and so that's basically what happened and since then i am assuming
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:25.800]  your walk with the lord was actually with jesus has gotten better yeah i mean i'll be completely
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:31.720]  honest uh i mean i go off and on i have a problem alcohol also a problem uh not with family so much
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:38.600]  but with with anger uh and if i work too much and drink too much caffeine and stuff uh i can uh
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.800]  i wouldn't call them psychotic breaks but i mean i definitely can turn into a monster uh and i've
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:49.320]  gotten really good in the last you know four or five years not doing it uh but um but that's also
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:53.640]  my walk with god is that i realized i would get mad that i couldn't meet the globalist myself and
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:57.960]  i was believing god believing jesus and had discernment in the holy spirit but i was still
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:02.440]  trying to do it myself and it's only been the last four or five years i learned to turn it loose
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.760]  and not get so mad about what they're doing i'm still mad about it but go it's up to god it's
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:11.640]  god's plan and i have to have some level of detachment or when you stare into the abyss as
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:18.600]  nichi says you become the abyss so i have to like make sure that i don't focus on the enemy too much
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:23.320]  or ever hate them because then you that hate becomes you i have to realize that they're falling
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:27.880]  their garbage they're evil and just protect the good people and just cut them off and not even
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:34.280]  think about them wow wow elix well you know you've been on this journey for a long time and you've
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:39.000]  you've done you you've got incredible research on your own you've got a great research team
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:45.720]  and you've interviewed thousands of people and you got introduced to this whole um you know new
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:52.120]  world order this whole thing very early on and in this entire journey has there been a couple of
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:56.600]  things along the way that have been really shocking or surprising to you mean things that
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:06.040]  you know you kind of went oh my i never expected that yeah i mean i grew up uh when i was like five
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:15.000]  we moved from uh dallas like central dallas on white rock lake to uh rock wall that was like
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.120]  a bedroom community then but but the richest county in texas then with a bunch of private
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:26.840]  airfields and helicopter fields and money and so it was a paradox of like you know it had the big
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:31.080]  it had the black projects in it in downtown the old town and then it had all these rich people
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:35.560]  that lived out in the country and the hills around it you know it's it's a hilly area kind of like
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:45.320]  austin most of dallas is flat and it's on lake ray hubbard and i was shocked uh that that there was
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:51.480]  a lot of satanism going on and and not just what you think of is like you know white trash their
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:57.640]  backyard sacrifice of the dog on halloween i mean real luciferian type stuff and i can tell
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:01.880]  some of those stories but just gets into how weird my lifespan now that was god preparing me
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:07.880]  uh that i never engaged in the satanism itself uh but i was i lost my virginity when i was 12 i
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:13.480]  looked like i was 16 when i was 12 and i when i was 16 was like i was 25 and so you know i'm 48 now
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:19.880]  and so i i i did to like girls that were a little bit older like 16 years old
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:25.880]  and i definitely liked it so i became very promiscuous and so then i got roped in by some of the
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:30.520]  girls that were seniors in school when i was a freshman in high school and then even college
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:38.360]  women and then other stuff and then um it became very apparent uh with with the three or four of
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:44.280]  the women uh who were in rich families that they would try to get me inducted into luciferianism
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:48.440]  and it was actually a actual cult operating out there i didn't understand that and then so that's
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:53.640]  one of the reasons why i had sold his dental offices and uh actually moved uh to to austin
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.200]  which i ran into no satanism down here was more new age stuff and hippy stuff but but that area
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:05.080]  of rock wall had a very rich powerful uh group of occultists going on similar to what's in
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:10.600]  monorio and uh the russian river of california has the same group uh there's a big one in new
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:19.080]  york uh there's a big satanic group in pennsylvania also in Omaha nebraska um san francisco uh and
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:26.120]  so that kind of primed me early on uh that you know uh you know some girl picks you up in her
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:31.000]  hundred thousand dollar mercedes and you're and you're and you're you know you're 14 years old
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.040]  and uh you know you go to her mansion you're having sex with her and then a week later
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:41.240]  you know she invites you to her house and and it's you and i mean literally one of these houses
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:46.600]  was a castle a castle out in the country an act with helicopter pads and you know airfield and
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:52.680]  everything and you know in income these rich parents and they're literally saying hey you know
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:59.000]  we want you to join this cult you know you like having sex with my daughter uh so i i got immediately
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.840]  like they tried to put me immediately into one of the higher levels of these feeders but most
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:08.920]  people get into the occult they go join a satanic church they're up for years and never make it into
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:15.560]  the inner rings of it but i i bypassed the uh the stepping stones they try to put me right into it uh
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:22.280]  and so again my big challenge was was was my big temptation was sex and i'm saying once i transcended
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:29.640]  that uh when i was about 19 that's when my main mission started wow that's that's pretty that's
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:36.280]  pretty shocking at that early age that you were not only able to not in not get involved with it
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:42.520]  but to kind of walk away from it that that was like a wall there was like a wall like at the
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:47.640]  point that that happened those times there was like a wall but because i didn't fully reject it
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:53.640]  i was still demonically influenced and and you know i mean i mean i did stuff well i mean i i mean i
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:59.240]  i mean i'd beat people to uh you know i mean i would be like people start fights me like
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:03.160]  they were obviously attracted to me because i would like beat up full grown men and stuff and
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:07.880]  it was it was not good and it was definitely satanic but the point is i got out of it i was never
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:11.640]  officially in it but i was spiritually influenced by it so let's just say this i've been very
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:16.760]  blessed to be somebody that got on satan's railroad for a while but got off the train but i i now see
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:22.120]  i now see back that was all part of god's process because if i didn't see all that early on i wouldn't
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:28.360]  be ready for it now well that's a true statement i mean you know our whole life sort of you know
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:33.240]  we were both born for a time such as this and all of our previous experiences have kind of gotten us
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:49.160]  to this place so as you move on to the end of your life alex how do you want to be remembered
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:43:06.280]  i think we watched the election be uh stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:14.120]  ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:20.360]  election month alex it's not election day and that's the problem and everything changed after
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:28.440]  covid-19 they illegally changed state elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:33.560]  mailing multiple ballots to people well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:39.000]  country when we have elections that can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:44.600]  the election was stolen in 2020 and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:49.480]  for the media and the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:55.720]  and question the the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:44:06.040]  deniers we're election realists i have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist i have come
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:12.760]  from nowhere to the very heights of politics not just in america but the world we are engaging
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:18.440]  the globalist at point blank range in the information war but i don't deserve the credit
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:23.880]  yes i've persevered but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:28.920]  you've had the success we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:36.440]  new order you've ever had we are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why

[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:37.640]  so as you move on to the end of your life alex how do you want to be remembered i didn't used to
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:41.320]  care how i was remembered but now i know how the globalist operate like they've done with the whole
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:45.160]  i want to say the name of it canada could stuff where i barely ever covered the internet questioning
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:50.600]  it literally 24 minutes in in in all those years before they sued me then six years after they sue
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:57.320]  me they now admit a top pr firm that does the pr for the un out of new york said we're going to
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:04.440]  run against trump with alex jones the last two months of the 26 campaign or the 2016 campaign
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:11.240]  and we're going to build him up as this guy that did all the stuff he didn't do because he's the
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:16.520]  art type of the populist resistance so we can capture him and not have him as an icon of populist
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:21.320]  folk hero resistance as they said it has now come out i'm gonna call myself that that's how they saw
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:25.800]  it and we can turn him into this horrible bully of children and this mean guy then we can default
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:30.840]  him then we can have a judge say i'm guilty and then we can create this false art type so it's
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:35.800]  very important that they not be able to capture the alex jones this is the sherry ten pennies
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:41.960]  of the tucker carlson's of the world with the fake creature they they create because they don't just
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:47.960]  create a straw man they make that fake straw man who you are and then don't just use that currently
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:51.880]  they then use that to rewrite history in the future that's why it's important to try to be as
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:57.400]  healthy as i can to be on air as long as i can show that as they're in live time trying to rewrite
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:00.920]  history that i'm this horrible person people understand that it's bigger than me just saying
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:06.840]  oh alex jones was right where used to i would like just didn't even want to i don't want to be arrogant
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:11.400]  it's not about me because you make it about ego it actually weakens you but now i see myself as a
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:16.600]  symbol that i need to be better on air because i make mistakes and i need to be more steadfast
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:21.400]  because i'm an example but also they've made a false example once they deplatform you on all
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:25.640]  their platforms they can create whatever they want you to be and basically steal your identity
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:30.840]  and so so so that's why how people remember is important i want to be remembered as somebody
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:36.600]  that was pro human pro god pro family uh that that stood up against evil and that had a great
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:40.600]  effect and to be an example to others in the future who are going to face their own trials
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:44.520]  and tribulations to understand that satan's in control this planet but god's in control the
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:48.600]  universe that made you and it's going to be the animating contest of liberty and this challenge
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:52.760]  that's going to really really make you who you are and so you're not going to be happy serving
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:57.080]  the system you're not going to be happy being a sellout you're going to be happy in the animating
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:01.480]  contest of liberty and you shouldn't expect to change the world overnight by yourself but just
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:05.640]  little things like being a good father a good mother being a good boss or being a good employee
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:09.960]  you know having a garden caring about your neighbors visiting old people you know with uh
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:16.360]  you know with an animal at the nursing home uh you know just just putting light into the world
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:20.760]  is the right thing to do and it's what we need to do and so many good people that love god
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:25.240]  are ashamed in god's presence in the holy spirit and know that we're sinners and they
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:28.600]  never want to do anything because we're not perfect well god knows you're not perfect i'm
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:36.760]  certainly wasn't perfect and so um but but but god has helped transform me 90 away from the
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:42.120]  point i was at and and and and so now overall i don't even you know speed anymore in my car
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:46.920]  and and and so it's all just a process of becoming better and better because we're an example to others
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:50.200]  and it's not because we're Pharisees it's not because we have all the answers but it's because
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:53.880]  people see us as leaders we need to live up to that and people also don't have to understand
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:59.480]  that when they defend info wars or defend free speech or or or defend others under persecution
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:03.640]  that that's what the enemy can't stand because they can pick off our leaders they're gonna win so
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:08.600]  i just want to be remembered as somebody that really was a straight shooter and really did uh
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:13.080]  tell the truth and and really did you know try to be as honest as i could i've made mistakes
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:18.280]  but i've never been this cunning evil manipulative mastermind they claim they project who they are
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:21.640]  under me i've actually just been trying to tell the truth that's ringing for the fences
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:26.200]  that's really good i forgot to ask you do you have any siblings
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:31.400]  my mother got sterilized by the dalcon shield ied
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:37.080]  oh wow because when my dad was uh finishing up medical school she wanted to have a bunch of
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:40.440]  kids i only throw that out there because that's the system that they knew by the way sterilized
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:43.400]  people and she actually got a settlement from that but she'd rather not have the money she'd
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:48.520]  rather have more children and so that and so my when i was 14 they adopted my sister uh from korea
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:52.520]  who was an orphan when she was about a year old and she sees my sister that you know even though
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:59.560]  she's not blood she's just as much blood as not and so i have one sister um marley jones and uh
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:04.760]  she's an awesome person and so that's uh who i have for that i have some great cousins and some
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:09.240]  great folks but yeah my mom certainly would have liked to have more children and i wish i did i have
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:14.360]  four children i have three children with my ex-wife who's a nice person but kind of got
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:20.440]  psychologically colonized by the system and i but i but i care about her and you know i hope
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:26.200]  she does well and i have three children that have lived with me uh since uh since that divorce
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:31.880]  happened eight years ago and but two of them are moved out now uh and then i have a uh five-year-old
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:39.960]  daughter uh with my uh great wonderful wife erica and and so i've got four children oh wow that's
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:45.800]  great so that's i mean that's a big that's a big span between you know what did you say he's older
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:50.920]  older than 20 into five so you know god bless you on both ends of your life you know with children
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:56.120]  that's really a great that's really good i mean i mean i look back and on on the children i killed
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:53:01.400]  not knowing it and i would i just have nightmares about my children having problems now i just every
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:05.320]  time i see my daughter get in the car and drive off of my wife i worry about traffic and wrecks
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:10.040]  and i just just literally my heart aches for my children loving them and it's just that's why
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:14.840]  they don't want you to ever have kids so you would never imagine how precious they are and the fact
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:20.280]  that i was lied to and deceived by the system you know to have paid for i don't know six seven
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:25.320]  abortions over the years but but people harden their hearts when they do that and say i love it i
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:30.840]  love abortion no soften your heart no you made a mistake you were lied to don't commit to it
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:36.040]  once you know it's murder then then then god i really think sees that as the ultimate sin
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:40.120]  and that's what the left now says of course it's a kid kill that little creature you know
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:44.200]  they've really gone from it's a blob of tissue to yeah we kill kids we love it you know that's
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:47.880]  really their mainline statement they wear shirts how many abortions they've had and i think really
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:52.840]  abortion is the heart of the undermining of our country and our world and we don't value our children
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:59.320]  then god's not going to value us and we're cheapening human life and and so i think you know
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:03.560]  with me abortion was the breaking point with the devil even though i wasn't consciously with the
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:08.040]  devil and so for so many other people who've hardened their hearts uh and i know most your
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:11.880]  audience didn't like that but for people in your families out there just talk to them and explain
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:16.280]  that that weight and that bitterness and that darkness and that disconnect from god can come
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:21.160]  with repenting uh that you've uh you've you've killed your children and i mean i have i have
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:27.720]  murdered my children i am a murderer and uh that's just a fact you know i did an interview with um
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:34.520]  the producer of a documentary called the matter of life it's about it's about it's about abortion
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:39.720]  but it's the best documentary if you haven't seen it alex i'd encourage you to engage in it it's
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:44.440]  called it's called the matter of life is the name of the documentary and it's all done from a
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:50.760]  perspective of embryology you know that these two cells and these four cells are the same person as
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:55.640]  this 150 pound person sitting here it's really really good i think it would make a good interview
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:55:00.840]  for you on your i love that bond what's the name of it it's called the matter of life is the name
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:05.480]  of the documentary and michelle can get you the the name and the contact information of the producer
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:11.960]  well just an elaboration on that when when i went when a human and and sperm come together
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:17.000]  there's that big flash of energy and you don't see that with with you know most of the creatures
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.360]  out there you see it with white holes and they're more advanced things but the point is there's
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:24.680]  this huge flash of energy you don't even know what it is this pulse when they come together i mean
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:31.400]  that's real magic i mean that is that is what god created exactly so it's like you know that's life
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:36.760]  and but michelle can get you you or your people the information because it's a wonderful documentary
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:42.200]  i listen to that i don't usually spend time to watch two our documentaries i just don't really
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:46.200]  have the time but in preparation for that interview i watched the whole thing and it's
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:50.760]  really really really good so michelle can get your people that so just as we're closing up here
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:56.360]  there's two last questions i want to ask you one is say something about your book about why you wrote
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:01.160]  it and what you know there's a lot of books out there about the new world order and the reset
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:09.320]  now what made you decide you wanted to write this book well i i'd read some other books on
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:13.640]  the great reset that were excellent and i wanted to bring a bigger perspective to it and kind of
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:17.640]  the end game of what they were planning and how they're stealing free will in the whole future
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:21.880]  now it's bigger than just a global corporate takeover so the great reset is literally the
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:27.640]  plans of the death star and the proof of their criminal conspiracy against humanity and their
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:33.000]  own admissions that they want to be god and that they want to play god uh and so i just hope people
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:39.880]  will go to infowarstore.com and get a unsigned copy or as a fundraiser we're selling a signed copy
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:44.040]  because we need the funds to stay on air we will stay on air despite all their attacks and all
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:48.680]  their fake judgments this will all be overturned on appeal but that'll take two years so regardless
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:53.320]  we'll be here for two more years if we have money for the appeals and those process and we're just
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:58.920]  you know right there in the edge of the black right now so financial support for the viewers
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:02.280]  would be great i hope people will get a copy of the great reset and the war for the world
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:08.280]  at infowarstore.com that's one of the great books and films uh there uh on the side but
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:13.000]  and i know the listeners pretty much already know all this but imagine your friends and family and
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.360]  neighbors getting a copy or get it read it donate to the library and it'll be another seed that you
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:23.240]  put out there another you know message in a bottle uh to the universe and so or try to take it to your
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:28.520]  library your school library doesn't have pedophilia in it and watch the local aisd or local independent
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:34.120]  school district try to ban it well then do a report on that and use their own censorship against them
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:37.960]  and have the book blow up even more so i want to thank everybody that has gotten the book when

[01:59:52.760 --> 02:00:01.000]  are receiving this transmission you are the resistance what words of advice would you like
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:06.040]  to leave our listeners with here today try to be as conscious as you can try to pray as much as you
[02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:16.120]  can try to really seek God's discernment and realize that you're not judged by how much money you have
[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:22.360]  you're not judged by what the world thinks you're judged by what God sees and that it's not fun to
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:27.080]  be persecuted in the flesh but the spirit it's actually the greatest high there is when you know
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:31.800]  they're coming after you're doing the right thing so just keep your faith in God and get engaged
[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:36.200]  now more than ever because the children are crying out to God to protect him but God made us with
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:42.680]  free will so God works through us to answer their prayers and so we are you know on this earth not
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:49.640]  like angels but you know if we choose to serve God as God's instruments to go out imperfectly
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:56.520]  but but to go out and and try to protect the innocent and so I do see it as you know once
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:01.800]  you're saved in Christ the blood of Jesus all is forgiven but faith without works is dead so yes
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:06.840]  grace does it and that's that's but but if you're really coming into Christ then you're going to get
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:12.040]  stronger and stronger over time with Christ and and and less and less will evil have control over
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:16.280]  you and none of us are perfect but I mean compared to how I was 10 years ago and I was a Christian a
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:22.520]  pretty good person then I'm a way better person you know and so it's a process and so God will
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:26.600]  reach out to you but you've got to reach out to God so you know God's knocking but you got to open
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:33.960]  the door and people have to realize that this is a process and so if you don't step out and start
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:39.960]  doing this uh it's the world's never going to get better and so I would encourage people to start
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:45.560]  their own podcast or start their own letter to the editor or call in to talk radio more just
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:50.120]  you don't have to change the world overnight many hands make light work just do a little
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:54.680]  something up front like I did calling to talk radio and going to city council meetings when I was
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:02:01.000]  you know 19 years old 18 years old uh and and just looking for ways to be heard I mean look at
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:06.920]  city council county commissioners school boards everywhere every day flood twitter instagram everywhere
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:10.760]  oh okay they can ban this person they can't ban everybody and then you'll see videos with hundreds
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:15.160]  of thousands millions of views dozens of them where you can't even watch them every day but
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:19.640]  everybody else is and and it's just moms and dads and brothers and sisters and grandmothers and
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:25.000]  grandpas and teachers going to the grassroots power structure and saying we're not buying it
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.680]  and that totally scared the system where they said send the FBI after them well then of course the
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:34.520]  FBI was discredited for that so so every venue you can to be heard be heard every venue you can
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:40.120]  magnify dr sherry tim pinney's information or my information do it that's great and it's true
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:48.360]  I mean you know they hire literally hire you know troops of trolls to go out for their messages
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:53.160]  and we have 10 times more people but you got to volunteer your time you know I've I've said to
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:58.040]  people sometimes um you know write down the five or six things that you're really interested in
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:04.760]  and pick one pick one and donate as much time and then decide how many hours per week of volunteer
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:09.960]  time that you can actually give is it five hours a week is it five hours a day I mean whatever it
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:14.120]  is and then commit to it like it was a dental appointment I mean you commit to it and really
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:20.440]  do because all of these all of our organizations need the boots on the ground they all need people
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:25.960]  going out and folks are gonna find folks are gonna find it's not work you'll get addicted to it and
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:30.040]  there's so many organizations that are good but they're they kind of plan all day and you know
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:35.080]  there's who's in charge of it there's battles about the organization don't do that folks just get out
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:41.640]  there just get out there and start speaking out so you know put comments on things you know support
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:46.600]  things you know if you're gonna buy something buy it from alex's store buy it from our store I mean
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:50.360]  if you're gonna buy it anyways buy it from people that you want to support and don't support the

[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:59.880]  invention the barricading street invasion of the body snatchers
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:17.640]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance it's alex johns
[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:25.880]  all right the planets have aligned shone stone was just happened to be visiting a town we talked
[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:30.520]  about on the show and vivian kubrick is here making a documentary film both you guys are
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:34.680]  filmmakers in your own right and of course you're an author shone stone as well on a tv
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:40.200]  producer and both your fathers are some of the most famous directors in history stanley kubrick
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:46.520]  and of course your dad needs no introduction oliver stone and your dad's an expert and so are you
[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:49.800]  and what's happening over in ukraine that's leading us towards world war three the whole
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:55.640]  false flag missile attack the world government castle society being announced stolen elections
[02:08:55.640 --> 02:09:00.920]  just mass psychosis they're planning for new lockdowns i mean we really are stepping into
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:05.480]  the dystopia i hate being vindicated being on air 28 years reading our own documents i wasn't
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:10.200]  predicting i knew they had power they were planning this i tried to stop it now we're in it but people
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:15.720]  are halfway awake this is how would you describe first shone stone and vivian kubrick the moment
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:22.200]  in history we're in right now it's uh it's it's like being in a dream it's like being in a dream
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:28.040]  where everyone is in a sense experiencing their own realities and it's almost difficult to get us
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:33.800]  on the same wavelength the same same page here because as you said like there are these forces
[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:38.600]  that we can identify and we can point to and obviously it's manipulating the the media the new
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:43.400]  cycle that that's put out there we we can really tell the agenda very clearly based on the new
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:50.280]  cycle but as far as our experience of it it is so different right i mean life has been broken down
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:55.240]  into that place where maybe that's the point of beauty of it is is if we can reclaim like some
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:10:01.480]  sense of how reality in los angeles is is 180 degrees different from what it is right now here
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:06.440]  in austin from what i experience and live in in florida right and maybe that's the beauty of it is
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:10.760]  getting back to the states and i think that if anything else like my only hope right now is
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:14.680]  looking at the elections going okay great they did their rigging they've prolonged you know they've
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:19.000]  drawn out these ballots for days and weeks and it's disgusting obviously what can be done now
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:25.800]  with the rigging but look at least at florida's totally red and texas obviously didn't you know
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:29.800]  they didn't get better in here they there weren't you know it wasn't like there were some major
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:35.160]  tectonic shifts that took place so if you go to the state levels there is still a fight going on
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:39.400]  and there is still resistance going on the state levels and there is still opportunity i think for
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:43.880]  people to say well i can't deal with california politics anymore i'm leaving i'm you know we've
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:46.760]  seen that obviously and i think it'll just continue and it'll continue in the coming years
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:51.560]  because the more that they force down our throats these policies the more the human spirit just
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:55.800]  rejects and says no that's not my reality anymore i'm leaving i told rigor i told my wife two days
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:59.720]  ago i said i even cut a little problem this canary next week where i give thanksgiving
[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:04.760]  i'm more thankful now than ever because good versus evil is so clear before it was under the surface
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:09.240]  now it's been forced out in the open and the forces of enslavement who are anti free will
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:14.520]  are more desperate than ever so this looks really bad uh but it's it's forcing the infection
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:19.160]  to the surface and and and as you said the paradox of being in one state like it's another country
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:23.800]  versus one that's still under the mind control is night and day and it just it shows there's a way
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:29.160]  out and as people in those more enslaved areas see those of us in less enslaved areas we become
[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:32.920]  an example to the envivian cubrick how would you describe the place we're at right now worldwide
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:39.080]  and also here in america well i feel like people are being challenged unlike any other period of
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:46.840]  history to actually interface with their true selves to not operate from being you know
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:53.320]  in inculcated with you know lies and the psyops in fact shawn and i were just talking about
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:58.840]  this before we went live on air that people need to understand how the psyops work that's
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:05.480]  going to really help them emerge as their true selves because psyops are weird they you know
[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:12.520]  they really do affect you they affect me uh and it's so um god what's the right word uh
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:18.600]  it i can't think of it it begins with i not seeing anything i can remember about it anyway um
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:25.320]  it's very surreal well it's very surreal when you actually start to see like i was saying the
[02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:33.480]  other night the mainstream media cut together all the talking heads and then this super sinister
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:40.600]  alignment of everything they're saying is the same sentence that is so terrifying to me and if
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:45.800]  only people could just see 30 seconds of those kinds of videos they're going to go wait a minute
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:50.920]  nobody's actually independently reporting the news that's right you've got abc cbs nbc all of them
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:55.160]  in the exact same script that's when you're in a tyranny i mean you're in or a tyranny trying to
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:59.560]  take over well i saw i had this conversation recently about you alex was funny i was in la and
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:04.520]  i was talking to a filmmaker there and he was basically giving me the talking points as to
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:11.400]  why you were being sued because you had incited people to digging up graves and terrorizing
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:17.240]  the sandy hook parents and i said well i'm not sure if that's true but if if that is true if he's
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:22.440]  guilty of incitement think about the consequence of that and it's like only then that actually
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:27.080]  catch him i he said like thinking about it go think about that so you you say something that
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:32.680]  incites me and i go over there and i rob someone or i kill someone and now you're responsible
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:35.960]  actually i just want to say isn't that takes everybody else's freedom is but that's the
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:39.880]  whole point we've lost responsibility if we're guilty of incitement my father got sued for this
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:45.000]  in the 90s my my i just that's what i want killers right well wait a minute i just want to say with
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:51.560]  cluckwork orange people at the time um people were raping and killing and robbing and then they
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:55.880]  were saying oh i did it because i saw cluckwork orange which i doubt was ever true but anyway
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:00.120]  margaret whitehouse i think that's her name i can't remember now anyway she was a big kind of
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:07.240]  like you know moral compass for the conservative world you know said that my father was responsible
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:13.000]  for these things and it became so bad that my father actually said right that's it i don't want
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.960]  cluckwork orange to be shown in england again as long as i live because he was being i mean it
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:21.880]  literally i couldn't and of course the film makes you not want to be violent and it's anti-violence
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:26.840]  oh well this i mean like you know what this is what we were talking about last week about the
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:32.600]  audience contributes to the film so if the audience is at a very low level consciousness what they're
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:37.000]  going to contribute and understand about the film it's going to be very different than how you and i
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.760]  would did experience it i just must tell you hilarious thing a guy big tech guy in california
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:48.280]  in los angeles hollywood um he said to me that he loved cluckwork orange because he thought alex
[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:56.200]  was living such a great life and i sort of went i sort of went what i said that's a very interesting
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:00.760]  interpretation of cluckwork orange when really the novel of your dad's film it's obvious the
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:05.800]  state's corrupt and evil and it's reflecting down to the grassroots and that's what it's saying
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:09.400]  well that was exactly the point of cluckwork orange which inspired natural born killers in
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:14.200]  some way that's why well it was involved i mean i know that my father when i was in the film natural
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:19.320]  born killers as the little brother of mallory nox right that leo louis character he had me
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:25.160]  wear the cluckwork orange makeup in homage to that film and of course it was about the violence of
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:29.560]  society right that's what natural born killers was trying to reflect was how violent my father
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:35.640]  conceived of the media portrayal of violence it's a fascination with violence just like they
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:39.320]  promote mass shootings they know it causes more well it's like they promote the mass shootings
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:44.200]  that look at netflix right now i mean most of netflix's shows are about crime serial killers dommer
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:48.920]  it's you know cannibalism it's like it's a very brutal dark perspective of reality right that's
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:53.320]  what's feet and that's what we're basically being fed and this is powerful shan ston vivian kubrick

[02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:16.520]  the new world order it's alex jones
[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:20.200]  vivian cubrick in studio here on the alex jones show so you got cut off by the break sean and
[02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:23.800]  vivian you're talking about your dad makes the film against violence your dad makes the film
[02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:29.560]  against violence it's obviously somebody that is empathetic and smart it's obviously horrible
[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:33.640]  makes you hate violence and it's obviously the state has created a process that creates these
[02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:38.600]  creatures and then hires them as their police later you know the novel is is powerful as well
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:42.040]  clockwork orange and then they turn around and say you're promoting violence when it was
[02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:46.840]  both your fathers in those films exposing that the system in studies
[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:52.280]  is actually creating the violence loop right right i mean that's well at least that was the
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:55.960]  intention of natural born killers as well as clockwork orange but with natural born killers
[02:20:55.960 --> 02:21:00.840]  you recall there was a lawsuit that was brought in the nineties against my father by grisham and
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:07.240]  company because of a person that was that was seriously crippled she was uh crippled by a
[02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:11.240]  shooter who basically said that this guy went out there and he said i saw natural born killers
[02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:16.520]  a hundred times on mushrooms or whatever and and they wanted to drill play basically and
[02:21:16.520 --> 02:21:22.280]  play mickey you know mickey and mallory and they shot people up and so the idea was that the lawsuit
[02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:28.360]  was against oliver stone and one of brothers is making a faulty product right like they inspired
[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:33.400]  these shootings and it's like but that's the problem it's you can't go down this path of
[02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:36.520]  saying well that's what i did with me they misrepresented what i said took in a context
[02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:40.840]  made it a huge issue claimed i made a big issue judge found me guilty and then now they call it
[02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:45.240]  the alexios precedent where they can claim if anybody does anything we claim encourages somebody
[02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:49.400]  else to do something then i'm at fault for someone digging up someone's grave that it turns out never
[02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:55.640]  even happened right but you know you're both talking about a key issue about us as humanity
[02:21:55.640 --> 02:22:00.760]  is that are we going to be responsible for ourselves or are we always going to have big nanny
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:06.120]  and big nanny in our head going wow i must take care of humanity and make sure that i never put
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:11.320]  anything out which might cause them to go and strangle somebody why wouldn't we expect for
[02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:17.160]  humanity to go well strangling people is bad even though it's in this film i'm not going to do it
[02:22:17.160 --> 02:22:22.680]  because it's terrible and it's just like you were saying you know earlier though uh the system knows
[02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:27.240]  full well that that's not the case they never criticize their product that's actually designed
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:32.600]  to do it they criticize those are trying to stop it you know again it's it's um it's gotten to a
[02:22:32.600 --> 02:22:37.480]  very dangerous place when you say as you say to anyone you let go of individual responsibility
[02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:40.680]  because that's what we've seen the last two years right i mean the whole thing with the the
[02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:46.120]  pandemic was like no one i've never seen this this quote recently it's like no one is safe until
[02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:51.560]  everyone is safe oh god and it's like what does that even mean you're never going to be safe i'm
[02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:55.240]  sorry and now we know it doesn't protect you and as a fraud so what did that director say
[02:22:55.240 --> 02:23:00.040]  when you pointed out you're next who's that we said you were talking to a filmmaker and you said
[02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:04.280]  once they got out of Jones now you can be blamed as well right well that's that was actually an
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:08.680]  interesting moment i think that he we did then get to a more common ground because he was so
[02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:13.160]  agitated against you personally and that's the point like which director i can't i'm not going to
[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:18.040]  sit well the point is that you know when people are so personally and they you know it's we've
[02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:22.600]  gotten to this place right where it's about you know if trump says it it doesn't matter what it
[02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:27.400]  what it is the sky's blue he's wrong you know we don't like him and we've we've turned this into
[02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:32.680]  an inability to hear what's being said because we've we saw already to attack whoever says it
[02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:36.360]  right so if the whoever if alex says it then it must be bad but if you know if i say it and all
[02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:40.840]  of a sudden it's like huh oh maybe that actually makes sense you know because maybe i'm not a
[02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:45.480]  or democrat congress members incite violence against republicans and say it's good that scully
[02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:50.840]  scott shot or good that ran paul got his ribs broken and lung pierced that's good but then they
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:56.840]  lied say i invoked violence when i didn't but that's again i mean even if even if they did say that
[02:23:56.840 --> 02:24:00.440]  was good you know what they have the right to say that i agree they did and we acknowledge that we
[02:24:00.440 --> 02:24:05.240]  acknowledge that freedom of speech and that's what just it's so difficult for us to fathom
[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:09.480]  you know again vivian you've been you know alive a little longer than i have but like just going
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:16.040]  through these decades of watching how society has has nor has tried to normalize the you know the
[02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:20.760]  idea that freedom that's free speech is not inherently free that we should be you know
[02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:27.240]  censored so vivian and sean what is the process the social engineers are in trying to restrict
[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:32.520]  the general public speech i see it as a sign of weakness oh it's without question of weakness
[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:36.840]  because they don't want to be challenged in any way but i think that that's the nature of bullies
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:42.520]  and criminals is that they only know how to crush in order to achieve their ends
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:47.400]  and i think what we have to understand is there's nothing more important than having dialogue
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:53.720]  exchanging ideas defending our position but also being willing to listen but that would be
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:25:00.680]  the mark of maturity and right now they've tried to you know create infantile populations who
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:06.200]  you know look to the government to you know be saved or look to the government for the truth
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:12.120]  and won't do anything unless they're given a go ahead it's it's terrifying absolutely agree can
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:17.160]  the general population be saved because if they do get brainwashed into an animal form now they're
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:20.440]  a howling mob that can be used against us i don't want to kill them i don't want to put everybody
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:25.320]  in prison but it's it's really an alchemy that's happening where i think globalists tell me they
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:28.520]  say look the public's a bunch of animals they're going to get everybody we got you'll be on our
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:33.320]  side soon enough that they say they're hastening the process of societal collapse because they
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:38.600]  believe it's going to collapse anyway so why not just get it over with you know i saw today's study
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:43.240]  validating with a lot of the stuff you were talking about with the drop in uh male fertility
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:48.040]  and sperm right and it's like i saw that was up down a drop in 60 percent in the last 50 years so
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:52.760]  we've gone past the 50 percent mark into the 60 plus percent mark and obviously we know that the
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:57.640]  the shots the covid shots are designed to to affect the ovaries and and they're affecting
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:03.400]  obviously female periods uh i think the 2021 was the first year i saw no one really caught that
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:07.320]  they said in america there was really no increase in population for the first time it was really
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:11.960]  interesting i mean i'm not i don't know about the immigrant or the migrant precipitous drop directly
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:16.280]  connected to german study to the shot mm-hmm but that's for sure the point being that we are now
[02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:20.760]  going to go into this this this collapse at least in the west now a lot of the east it would know
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:25.000]  we had a lot of the eastern world i mean didn't get the shots right a lot of africa a lot of
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.760]  asian countries a lot of poor countries didn't necessarily do this so the globalists say it's
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:34.120]  the first world we're using the most so they hit us first right right and this is going to be really
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:40.040]  what's so interesting to see how this plays out in this coming time period right the um the overall
[02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:46.200]  you know fourth industrial revolution right they want or they want a centralized controlled population
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:50.760]  in cities that are sort of sterilized that basically go like brave new world you want to
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:55.400]  you know have a child you go into the doctor and you basically go choose your you know your ovary
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:59.080]  i guess you choose the ovary choose the end of the spur and they're admitting that's their plan
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:02.520]  and we're just trying to have a debate about the world they're building right and then yeah so i
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:08.120]  almost just say something let's just acknowledge the fact that these people are insane they're
[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:15.080]  psychopathic they have no empathy and what they're trying to create is so diabolical that to describe
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:21.880]  it as anything like they're planning this they're planning no this is the act of kind of computing
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:27.080]  psychotics they've got the ability to be brilliant but they have no ability to be human and they're
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:32.280]  in love with this i call it the science of tyranny well actually yeah i i think i mentioned this the
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:37.800]  last time but anybody who wants to look at the most absolutely gobsmacking incredible fact
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:44.200]  our stottle 2400 years ago in his book on ethics wrote about if you want to create a tyranny this
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:49.400]  is what you do it's about two or three pages long i invite everyone to go and look at it because you
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:55.240]  will you will realize how ancient this playbook is oh a playdough is their model so i'm rid of
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:28:00.040]  oh well i suppose he was a student but yeah tell me the particular Aristotle derivatives we can
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:05.320]  look that up oh um i remember we'll try to find it during the break but yes i just look up Syracuse
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:11.160]  and uh persia if you do a word search i think it'll get you straight to it because he talks about the
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:18.200]  um these women who are spies and i think they're called the the whores of Syracuse or something
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:23.400]  who i mean but the thing is guys look up Aristotle the whores of Syracuse yes well Syracuse just as
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:29.000]  a word search um yeah anyway it's it's probably it would take about you know five minutes to read
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:35.480]  it uh it is you will be absolutely shocked to see that if you want to run a tyranny it's always been
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:40.360]  run the same way 2400 years ago they're doing exactly what they're doing now well you've cut
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:47.640]  right to the root it was playdough that wrote up these plans uh yeah well i mean they're public
[02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:53.080]  um and how he he a model he he imagined society being run in fashion but actually can i just say
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:56.040]  something good oh yeah i gotta break we were the trees were still in there's radio stations i
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:02.760]  know they're annoying we're out back until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:09.080]  that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:15.000]  they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:20.760]  weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:29.160]  d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough
[02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:34.200]  sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things
[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:38.520]  you start replicating and taking your body over so now it's more important than ever because the
[02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:43.400]  winter is here to take high quality vitamin d3 and we have the best with our vitamin d3

[02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:06.600]  thing that made any republican victories tonight possible the only thing that made any resistance
[02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:13.080]  to the war machine possible the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask
[02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:18.280]  mandates and the school shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible
[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:24.680]  made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the
[02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:30.680]  massive lawfare being waged against info wars despite the media defamatory libelist campaign
[02:30:30.680 --> 02:30:36.360]  against info wars the ordinary people the everyday people that buy products that make their own
[02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:42.200]  lives healthier wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air and what that does is keep
[02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:48.680]  the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression so continue to do it
[02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:54.360]  go to places like infowarstore.com go to the places like save info wars continue to keep info wars
[02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:59.640]  alive because in the process you're keeping american liberty alive in arizona i think we
[02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:07.320]  watched the election be stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots and
[02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:14.280]  it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's election
[02:31:14.280 --> 02:31:21.080]  month alex it's not election day and that's the problem and everything changed after covid-19
[02:31:21.080 --> 02:31:28.120]  they illegally changed state elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes
[02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:33.240]  mailing multiple ballots to people well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious
[02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:38.680]  country when we have elections that can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe
[02:31:38.680 --> 02:31:44.280]  the election was stolen in 2020 and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd
[02:31:44.280 --> 02:31:49.160]  for the media and the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity
[02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:55.320]  and question the the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election
[02:31:55.320 --> 02:32:01.880]  didiers we're election realists so when i first started taking survival shield basically i was
[02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:07.480]  275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a
[02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:11.720]  job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the
[02:32:11.720 --> 02:32:16.600]  original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came
[02:32:16.600 --> 02:32:20.200]  out with that you had you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited about
[02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:26.760]  that so i took it and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was
[02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:32.200]  enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of
[02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:36.520]  the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously took basically all of your
[02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:41.320]  supplements they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout
[02:32:41.320 --> 02:32:45.800]  it literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:50.600]  is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to
[02:32:50.600 --> 02:32:55.480]  do that is to take our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so
[02:32:55.480 --> 02:33:04.200]  much for your call and godspeed leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's
[02:33:04.200 --> 02:33:20.120]  alex jones
[02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:28.120]  lie from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[02:33:28.120 --> 02:33:36.520]  people have asked me what i think i elon musk and i i've kind of told you but it would take an hour
[02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:42.600]  or really break it down it's important he's the next level of the new world order he plays both sides
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:47.320]  he says he's pro humanity but he also goes along with her whole agenda i don't know if he's a good
[02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:51.480]  guy or a bad guy i took a treat by its fruits but i told her buddy this i'm not worried about
[02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:57.160]  getting back on twitter he's under such attack even trying to make it quasi free they're destroying
[02:33:57.160 --> 02:34:02.440]  it right now but he did respond to folks asking him today what should twitter do next and a
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:09.560]  lot of folks said bring back alex jones his response was no so that is kind of a litmus test
[02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:15.160]  because that's a bridge too far but that's part of that process now vivian kibrix here
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:19.400]  so is sean stone we've got a lot to talk about a lot of big issues but you were getting into
[02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:27.000]  philosophy and going back to the greek philosophy Aristotle and and his mentor and and and you know
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:31.640]  of course play to put out two two three sides to everything but he was the first to say that the
[02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:36.200]  plebs are crushing the breast of mother earth we need to ban poor people breeding we need to have
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:40.600]  breeding programs make better people what he talked about later got picked up by the romans then it got
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:46.680]  picked up by malthus then they got picked up by francis gallton then they got picked up by either
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:52.360]  the eugenicist in england or the nattoff hitler so when we see the transhumanists they all hail
[02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:57.560]  from that same school the discoverer of dna you know saying blacks are subhuman and all that it's
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:02.680]  it's really the same group but but now as you've talked about birch and rustle it's all wrapped in
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:07.080]  a liberal neoliberal packaging vivian police continuum well i was just saying to sean actually
[02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:11.880]  in the break uh you know you can't reinvent the wheel really and to have a tyranny you basically
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:16.920]  have to do the same thing so i just want to say if you want to read about play to really ironically
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:23.640]  written by a eugenicist and whatever uh birch and rustle if you go to the history of western
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:29.960]  philosophy chapter 14 i think it is you'll see described there basically the blueprint for the
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:36.200]  globalist and i would say that to put it in a nutshell whatever it is that determines somebody's
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:43.720]  state of consciousness what's consistent here is that they have contempt for others and it seems like
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:48.280]  what's really astonishing is they always have the same old playbook
[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:52.280]  and they total total conceit you've got a quote elsewhere it's from contempt right so this is
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:59.640]  from aristotle's ethics and this is how to have a tyranny a successful one uh as to tyrannies they
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:04.360]  are preserved in two most opposite ways one of them is the old traditional method in which most
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:11.960]  tyrants administer their government of such arts persian of sorry uh yeah period i can't read that
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:17.640]  of corinth is said to have been the great master and many similar devices may be gathered from the
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:24.040]  persians and the administration of their government they are firstly the prescriptions the prescriptions
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:31.720]  mentioned some distance back sorry this is all lead up okay uh some distance back for the preservation
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:38.920]  of a tyranny in so far as this is possible that the tyrant should lop off those who are too high
[02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:46.680]  he must put to death men of spirit he must not allow common meals clubs education and the like
[02:36:47.880 --> 02:36:53.720]  he must be upon his guard against anything which is likely to inspire either courage or
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:37:00.360]  confidence amongst amongst his subjects he must prohibit literary assemblies or other meetings for
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:06.120]  discussion and he must take every means to prevent people from knowing one another for
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:12.520]  acquaintance begets mutual confidence further he must compel all persons staying in the city
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:18.920]  to appear in public and live at his gates then he will know what they are doing if they are always
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:24.600]  kept under they will learn to be humble in short he should practice these and the like persian and
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:31.480]  barbaric arts which all have the same object a tyrant should also endeavor to know what each
[02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:38.440]  of his subjects says or does and should employ spies like the female detectives sorry not whores
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:45.800]  female detectives of syracuse and the eavesdroppers who hero was in the habit of sending to any place
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:52.440]  of resort or meeting for the fear of informers prevents people from speaking their minds and if
[02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:58.840]  they do they are more easily found out another art of the tyrant is to sow quarrels amongst the
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:04.040]  citizens friends should be embroiled with friends the people with the notables and the rich with
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:09.720]  one another also he should impoverish his subjects he thus provides against the maintenance of a
[02:38:09.720 --> 02:38:16.280]  guard by the citizen and the people having to keep hard at work are prevented from conspiring
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:23.480]  I mean it goes on but you know that's 2400 years ago interesting the you know the concept of the
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:28.760]  cancel culture I see it is very much like the old like the spy network in the old days you know and
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:35.320]  the idea of being found out for what you said and being found out for thinking in a way that could
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:40.760]  be construed as dangerous or different right and so how it's or it's now it's it's self-imposed
[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:45.960]  cancellation that occurs right you don't you don't allow yourself to say what you think you don't
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:51.000]  allow yourself to be heard saying something that can be attacked and targeted and you yourself
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:56.040]  censor that's right yeah and and and if you look at that model all of it has now been compounded
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:39:01.320]  and we see it being done today it's it's all it's all before our eyes now right and that's
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:06.520]  what's the crazy part right it's things that are in front of our faces we cannot we can't talk about
[02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:10.680]  right I mean even to the place now like the finally the congress is hopefully gonna do something with
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:18.360]  this hunter-biden story right and the the corruption of old joe but the point being that even to this
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:22.840]  day that you know if you're there being people are being accused of conspiracy theory for talking
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:27.560]  about it yeah what's with this what's with this it's a conspiracy theory can we just finally
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:34.680]  say out loud that the CIA come up with this terminology in order to they weaponize that
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:38.920]  they basically they said you have to use you have to slander the conspiracy theorists but
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:43.560]  your dad made jfk which is excellent film won't really happen but it came out the few years after
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:48.600]  that the CIA said people questioning we just call conspiracy theory so that we can ridicule those
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:52.920]  without looking at the actual evidence yeah they was very clear how they targeted anyone that questioned
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:57.320]  the war on commission but the point is that the government uses conspiracy a lot of time so I
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:02.680]  try to say to people look at recoax the government uses conspiracy when it goes after drug dealers
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:06.920]  and it goes after you know even uh you name it uh trump you know they go after these things on
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:11.800]  conspiracy right the uh january 6th i mean it's like it's all government usage of conspiracy
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:16.680]  that no one questions for why is it that if i say conspiracy you know everyone's big tobacco
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:20.360]  that was a conspiracy government after them on on conspiracy and here's the control though when you
[02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:24.120]  pull back i have articles right here where biden got questioned about the new congressional
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:28.200]  investigation to his son he said that's a conspiracy theory that's been debunked and they
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:32.040]  censored everybody two plus years ago during the campaign that tried to raise it even though they
[02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:36.120]  now admit it's real but in the audio and in the video they're taking orders from the head of
[02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:41.320]  chinese intelligence so they're making about barisma and gas companies and 10 for the big guy
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:46.920]  that's a diversion from him saying me and my dad take orders from ggping which is true
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:49.560]  that's really the big enchilada yeah that's a big quote
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:58.440]  well i'll tell you my honest opinion is that there isn't a political system there is just
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:03.240]  gangsterism that's how this planet no i agree it's a group of gangsters yeah so i mean anything
[02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:09.320]  that you've learned about the mafia just apply it to government and all of this so-called diplomatic
[02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:14.600]  um i'm sure that's another big sigh up that italians invented organized crime
[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:20.600]  they're the only ones that do this i mean it's i mean i mean the the globalist mafia it's the real
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:27.240]  mafia you know the ancient thousands of years yeah thousands of years of mafia
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:31.880]  rulership of empires and then all of a sudden it becomes you know democracy so-called you can write
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:37.960]  a book on the secret mafia the real mafia well i don't know enough of those old families i think
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:41.960]  vivian you know you don't you don't need those old families uh this is what i know is that it
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:45.320]  takes a certain kind of human being and they exist all over the place i was about to say
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:49.880]  they'll use any group or any organization it's it's a philots a cult of philosophy uh it's a
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:54.840]  cult of criminal beings it's like soros working with the nazis i mean it doesn't matter it's just
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:59.800]  it's what they do by the way if anybody hasn't seen this you need to find this george saris gave
[02:41:59.800 --> 02:42:05.320]  this interview probably about i don't know 25 years or 30 years ago where he just matter of factly
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:10.920]  which is so classic of psychopaths admits that he helped the nazis and he says i would do it again
[02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:16.920]  if i didn't do it who else someone else would yeah and it was the happiest time of my life we
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:21.000]  shaped his psychology which is what's so important to understand about soros but now you can't you
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:25.560]  know wikipedia you know is all soros agents so that's why so much is scrubbed on which soros is
[02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:30.840]  good a person right yeah exactly joking oh you know it's like it's this is the ridiculous of the
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:34.200]  time though you say something gets soros you're anti-semetic i mean it's like that has nothing to
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:39.960]  do with it too it's like it's like saying someone is being a gangster you're saying well you're
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:46.040]  anti-italian it's like just because that person's against it's a great trick that they're playing
[02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:51.240]  on people and you've got to like stop getting into this people you need to recognize that there are

[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:28.920]  we got some clockwork orange music bringing us in here vivi kubrick you got cut off of that
[02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:33.560]  break i'm sorry we'll try to take out a context go back to what you were saying and complete the
[02:47:33.560 --> 02:47:40.120]  statement all right so i'm sick of um jewish criminals christian criminals buddhist criminals
[02:47:40.120 --> 02:47:47.480]  atheist criminals whatever you are your criminal but in this whole thing the jewish issue of you
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:53.080]  know claiming people are anti-semitic if they attack a jewish criminal there are plenty of
[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:58.280]  jews there are like 15.2 million jews on this planet i don't think they want to be associated
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:02.920]  with george sorris george sorris is a criminal and a psychopath you only have to listen to his
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:07.960]  interview where he claims that it was the happiest time of his life when he was handing jews over to
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:17.000]  the nazis so he is a nut job i have no hesitation in describing him as a criminal an arch criminal
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  and he cannot hide behind anti-semitism when he claims that it's all people claim that it's
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:29.480]  anti-semitic to say that he's a horrific criminal and just as you you know there are christian
[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:34.040]  criminals if you say that none of them should be able to hide behind a religion or an essence
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:40.680]  no but these people are good at making it about that as a diversion and there are plenty of groups
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:43.640]  that are out of control that hate people because of what group they've been part of and that's
[02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:48.200]  terrible too well the actually the only group that i think the left won't criticize now as satanists
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:53.640]  i think that's the protected class i think the most protected group i think that's a good point
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:58.840]  i only think that is a terrifyingly good point no it's true yeah why do you think that is well
[02:48:58.840 --> 02:49:05.320]  because what do you think it is i mean my docu series best kept secret got into all this right
[02:49:05.320 --> 02:49:10.280]  the whole dark cabal um and how you know how this is an inversion agenda i mean if you really think
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:14.680]  about what's happened in our reality and you know left is right and up is down and black is white i
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:19.080]  mean that's all stanton levey was talking about that back in the 70s that was his quote you know
[02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:23.560]  freedom of slavery i mean there was a complete inversion of reality and to get to this place
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:29.400]  now where we are in a place where kids can't drink but they can have a sex change i mean and for the
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:35.240]  you know permanently you know castrating themselves that's normalized i mean you can have abortion
[02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:41.080]  up until birth if not after birth in california i mean things like this that just was like it was
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:46.280]  so far like so far from what this really is a satanic revolution right it's a really fascinating
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:51.240]  thing to have a great book or film the satanic revolution oh don't you'll encourage them um no
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:56.440]  i don't know we'd expose it the beautiful well i do think that this is john stone living coober
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:50:02.200]  and alex jones the new top film the satanic revolution oh they'll probably go oh this
[02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:05.880]  will be worth watching they'll think it's about them in a really nice way but explain how they're
[02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:11.480]  being set up to be alone and cut off being selfish and how you think the devil's hot cheerleaders
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:17.800]  or whatever but but it's not it's it's impoverishment it's betrayal it's death but alex this is the most
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:22.920]  key thing about understanding let's say the devil or satan let's say it's not even a question of
[02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:28.200]  there's actually being a real being that lives let's just say the outside right that what you're
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:33.160]  dealing with is half truths you the only way you can persuade people is if you actually have half of
[02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:39.320]  the truth and in that way you can enslave them because that's how you i mean con artists the
[02:50:39.320 --> 02:50:44.760]  government the cia they always try and hang on when you're catching a bass there's a real live worm
[02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:50.600]  on the hook there has to be something there that's real otherwise you're not going to capture people
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:56.040]  and then what you do is you just keep putting them off in the you just keep navigating them away from
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:01.480]  the truth and then it's only when it's too late and they're caught in a trap or they're so deluded
[02:51:01.480 --> 02:51:04.920]  that they don't i agree when i've noticed some people that buy lottery tickets or be generic
[02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:09.400]  amblers they're being abused by but they keep doubling down because they've invested so much
[02:51:09.400 --> 02:51:15.320]  right that's right well that's a real crazy part of humanity i mean humane a human the human condition
[02:51:15.320 --> 02:51:22.840]  is that the attempt to be right is so powerful that the defensiveness that comes over people when
[02:51:22.840 --> 02:51:28.520]  you even remotely go at the things that they're hanging on to is the truth i'm sorry banging my
[02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:35.400]  mic here um yeah uh is that they get very defensive that's why it's a real art to enter into a
[02:51:35.400 --> 02:51:41.480]  conversation with for instance people who have been fully sigh opt and gently you know get them
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:46.440]  back into a place where they can differentiate and the thing is i've had this conversation with
[02:51:46.440 --> 02:51:50.600]  someone who is very progressive and said oh it's not true what you're saying that they were going
[02:51:50.600 --> 02:51:55.480]  to kill babies at birth and i said look here is this woman i forget here's the legislation well
[02:51:55.480 --> 02:52:00.280]  here's the legislation i sent him that i said here's the woman speaking to the court and the judge
[02:52:00.280 --> 02:52:04.920]  says to her so you're saying that you would actually end the life of baby after it's born
[02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:10.040]  and she kept ifing and offing and then he said well yeah yeah that would be what it is and the guy
[02:52:10.040 --> 02:52:17.000]  said to me oh she's just not good at expressing herself and i went what she absolutely clearly
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:22.440]  said yes we would consider they have like a form of stock home syndrome is it even worth it to try
[02:52:22.440 --> 02:52:28.200]  to save those people instead get the people that are awake just to stop complying we have to i mean
[02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:33.400]  we have to do something here that's that that's clear right and and again i don't know that you
[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:37.800]  can do it with these with this system the way that it's rigged currently right i mean that's the
[02:52:37.800 --> 02:52:42.920]  that was the most disheartening thing of the last few weeks was just watching 2020 happen all over
[02:52:42.920 --> 02:52:48.040]  again with these drawn out mail-in ballot schemes right that's taking days and then obviously you
[02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:51.800]  know just seeing it it's inevitable right as you said you're optimistic because there's a lot of
[02:52:51.800 --> 02:52:56.440]  awakening worldwide yeah but it's paradoxicals it's also getting worse so it's extreme for every
[02:52:56.440 --> 02:53:00.680]  action there's an obvious equal reaction newtonian physics john stone how do you see this playing out
[02:53:00.680 --> 02:53:06.200]  just gut level a gestalt of the future yeah yeah no i mean there has to be a bifurcation
[02:53:06.200 --> 02:53:10.680]  coming here right i mean this is letting off of of those that want to be in the cities i mean i'm
[02:53:10.680 --> 02:53:15.800]  very concerned about things like the graphene oxide in the food also not just in shots this
[02:53:15.800 --> 02:53:18.840]  because they're bombing everything with nanoparticles right i mean it's exactly it's it's
[02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:22.840]  in the foods it's in the food supply the processed foods i mean it's just a question of
[02:53:22.840 --> 02:53:27.720]  look we've watched them for decades putting this toxicities into spraying into the air
[02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:31.000]  people can't even see anymore that country what controls are they just look at the air and just
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:35.480]  go oh yeah it's just clouds i'm like no one remembers what the heck what clouds are supposed
[02:53:35.480 --> 02:53:40.200]  to look like they just they assume that controls are normal it's a dwindling spiral the more they
[02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:45.160]  get poisoned the more they get so they're normalizing it they're normalizing the exactly the poison
[02:53:45.160 --> 02:53:48.920]  thing that's taken place of decades you know that to the place of obviously the opium epidemic i mean
[02:53:48.920 --> 02:53:53.720]  it's just it's just the suppress it's depressing and why do they want to kill us i guess it goes
[02:53:53.720 --> 02:54:00.760]  back to 2001 uh rdc clarker your dad's great film they they just feel like they have to act as god
[02:54:00.760 --> 02:54:05.880]  and they have to call us off but they're the worst of us it's it's like yeah but that's what i was
[02:54:05.880 --> 02:54:11.640]  saying before these people are insane they're psychopathic i think spiritually they are
[02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:17.640]  bankrupt and and they're projecting their will to kill themselves onto us how do we get their
[02:54:17.640 --> 02:54:21.720]  look at america's kill themselves but i don't want claus wobb to kill himself i wish we'd wake up
[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:26.680]  but obviously he's too far gone how do we get bill gates and claus wobb to say it's projection
[02:54:26.680 --> 02:54:31.160]  you need to kill yourself well actually i'd be quite satisfied if they just became
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:37.240]  ineffectual because everybody knew how evil they are my terror is that i still see people going
[02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:42.440]  bill gates is so wonderful he cares about us look at the you know ignoring the fact that 500
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:47.720]  thousand children in india were maimed and paralyzed by his polio vaccine on record yeah and
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:52.600]  those gruesome photos of him squeezing god knows what into a little black baby's mouth made me
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:56.280]  want so do you think with their whole rollout their lockdowns or poison shot they got what they
[02:54:56.280 --> 02:55:00.360]  want because i see it being rejected way worse than they thought it would i think it's been a defeat
[02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:04.440]  for them it's terrible for all the sick and dead people but i don't see it going well for them
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:09.640]  it's not going well for them at the same time it's like they what they do is they make their big push
[02:55:09.640 --> 02:55:14.440]  and then they roll it back you know to about 30 of what it was and then it's just like it's a
[02:55:14.440 --> 02:55:18.920]  gradualism right that's the whole point of progressivism it's been progressive takeover of
[02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:24.120]  humanity and so this has been a hundred-year plan as we know now that the place of digital currency
[02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:28.840]  the digital the digitization of everything so the transhuman thing is is inevitable
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:33.240]  uh that's why even you mentioned about elon musk it's like well he he gets it he's obviously doing
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:37.880]  the neuro link do i think that he's evil is he trying to put in everyone no but i think he also
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:42.040]  he's playing in a sense he's playing with it because he knows he's not bad if i'm in a car
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:45.560]  i can paralyzed i hope he invents something give me my legs back right we just don't want the
[02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:49.800]  software that controls us in it that's well that's the point exactly is that you know if it's it's
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:54.840]  it's like if you lost your legs of course you want to be able to replace it but do we want to then
[02:55:54.840 --> 02:56:00.040]  ultimately be the robots that they are envisioning of as far as the transhuman thing where oh i'm
[02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:04.440]  going to genetically splice my child and alter my child and because that's going to make a perfect
[02:56:04.440 --> 02:56:08.520]  human no this is this doesn't work which takes us back to childhood end and and are the c clark a
[02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:12.040]  top aluminist where yeah you're gonna live forever but you're gonna give your body up and we're gonna
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:15.960]  be controlled by us well it's i don't even think that they'll achieve it i think that the technology
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:20.440]  will never be perfected because it's the net you're playing with nature which is much more
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:25.640]  perfect right nature is net nature understands things that these this human alteration can't
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:30.600]  so the more that we play god as we know it upgrades it creates monstrosities right it's just it's
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:35.800]  inevitable and then the big you can't say a man can't be a woman in the future when they claim oh
[02:56:35.800 --> 02:56:40.360]  he's upload his consciousness bob still alive if you say that's not really bob the computer
[02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:44.520]  you're hurting his identity you get arrested but really bob didn't live eternally the
[02:56:44.520 --> 02:56:49.080]  corporation sold him that but it's a fraud i think it'll be a fraud i don't think that you
[02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:54.200]  can take the human spirit and transmit and put it into a robot i don't believe that well i've
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:57.960]  met with top globalists and they admit that's their end game is that we're gonna live in computers
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:02.360]  and that we have to accept that it's to me it's it won't work because the spirit is connected to
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:07.080]  the body absolutely physical natural physical experience it's an electrochemical machine that
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:12.440]  it's in right exactly all we are is really an antenna to the dimensions this is an antenna
[02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:17.320]  right so they can't make the antenna the antenna is just dialing in yeah no even with the silicon
[02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:23.560]  machine or graphene oxide or whatnot it's just it's not going to be uh connected to spirit
[02:57:23.560 --> 02:57:29.480]  using exactly this biochemistry or all the ancient dna that goes back as a continued electrical pulse
[02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:32.760]  which is i call it a time machine if we think of ourselves just being alive now but all our
[02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:37.960]  answers go back that's the genetic code time machining through space yes and it's an instant
[02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:43.320]  it's one communication right we'll be back with hour number four straight ahead two more segments
[02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:51.240]  and jay dyer takes over stay with us you know i've got until about 150 years ago cultures all over
[02:57:51.240 --> 02:57:57.720]  the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something
[02:57:57.720 --> 02:58:04.760]  called vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:10.200]  cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of
[02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:18.840]  vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not
[02:58:18.840 --> 02:58:24.120]  getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[02:58:24.120 --> 02:58:28.520]  things to start replicating and taking your body over so now it's more important than ever because

[03:00:15.720 --> 03:00:31.240]  but think about the power of that that you are all your ancestors going back to the unknown eons
[03:00:31.800 --> 03:00:36.280]  and you are the leading edge of all their consciousness and their will and obviously their
[03:00:36.280 --> 03:00:41.640]  energy lives on other dimensions but we're not just conduits here personally now we are part of a great
[03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:51.640]  genetic and psychic and spiritual energetic trust can i offer a little bit of a clue that maybe
[03:00:52.520 --> 03:00:58.280]  they can get into a machine all right now wait so if any of you have watched paranormal shows
[03:00:58.280 --> 03:01:03.960]  you'll see that there's all this extraordinary evidence of disembodied in another dimension
[03:01:03.960 --> 03:01:09.480]  communicating either as apparitions in front of people or when they're recorded it's called
[03:01:09.480 --> 03:01:15.400]  electronic voice phenomena so maybe they know a lot we all know the cia did like remote viewing
[03:01:15.400 --> 03:01:20.600]  as did the kgb or whatever it was training people to do remote being so they obviously believe in
[03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:29.320]  spirit so is it more to do with them defying god and wanting to be you know more powerful and they're
[03:01:29.320 --> 03:01:35.400]  going to demonstrate to god that they can like outperform him um or are they actually taking
[03:01:35.400 --> 03:01:39.480]  something that's real but because they're psychopaths and insane they're doing something
[03:01:39.480 --> 03:01:45.800]  horrendous with it which is like you know i mean no i really trying to be god yeah and they're
[03:01:45.800 --> 03:01:49.000]  inviting people to commit suicide saying hey it'll be really great you know you've got a really
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:53.960]  screwed up body well you can upload your mind into this thing and i just feel they're using that
[03:01:53.960 --> 03:01:58.040]  as a way for people to knock them you know to make their free will to go into that dimension
[03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:02.040]  they're not even really in the machine but that's more like an art type and a symbol of them in a
[03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:06.600]  ritual agreeing to go with that energy well and to kill themselves because this seems to be like
[03:02:06.600 --> 03:02:10.760]  the death cult of all death cults they want to kill little babies they want people to commit
[03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:16.120]  suicide well they don't want you to do is pass on your genetic information absolutely why why
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:20.200]  because they know it's going to end up creating something beautiful they can't stop
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:27.240]  oh yes that is a good good answer i mean control is is the very much the end game right of what
[03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:33.560]  these sociopaths or psychopaths are after they want to control this this dimension completely
[03:02:33.560 --> 03:02:37.000]  that's why i think we were talking about the poisoning of the environment of you know using
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:41.000]  the chemtrails the chemicals the heavy metals that are being sprayed right putting it's an assault
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:44.440]  on the third dimension well it's an assault in third dimension be able to basically the more
[03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:48.680]  you can metallisize it the more you can then broadcast whatever frequencies you want like
[03:02:48.680 --> 03:02:53.160]  and they live right metallisize metallisize yeah yeah that's what the nanotech is replicating
[03:02:53.160 --> 03:02:57.560]  everybody right right they're putting the plugs into us so so shot stone how do we beat them
[03:02:58.920 --> 03:03:03.960]  get back to nature connect to you know detox your system keep you know cleaning out your mind
[03:03:03.960 --> 03:03:09.880]  and your body and your spirit and just basically honor the creator you know because that's it this
[03:03:09.880 --> 03:03:13.400]  this is this creation is of the creator and we are still we are all expressions of a living
[03:03:13.400 --> 03:03:18.360]  expressions of it so to honor ourselves and the spirit that goes that emanates through us that
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:23.240]  we are divine beings to honor that is then to honor and others and to respect others these
[03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:27.640]  beings they know talking about sociopaths they're they don't love themselves so they don't love
[03:03:27.640 --> 03:03:31.720]  anyone else you see they don't have respect for themselves so they don't respect anyone else
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:34.680]  and that's why a lot of these things a lot of these sexual perversions and stuff as you know
[03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:38.920]  from these elites it's like they're all into like s and m kind of things they want to be beaten or
[03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:43.960]  you know they want children because they themselves are so they hate themselves so much they're so
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:49.080]  wretched inside and it's a demonic energy ultimately it's such a low vibrational energy
[03:03:49.080 --> 03:03:55.240]  so the more that we that are aware awakening can basically come into a place of more self-love
[03:03:55.240 --> 03:03:59.160]  more self-awareness more self-respect then we respect others the same way right well that's
[03:03:59.160 --> 03:04:03.560]  true the revolution is us changing ourselves individually that will change the world absolutely
[03:04:03.560 --> 03:04:08.520]  and that's where you have to take responsibility for yourself learn how to differentiate and
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:14.360]  examine and expect information that you're being told and bother to see if there's grotesque
[03:04:14.360 --> 03:04:20.440]  contradictions i mean because that's part of their hypocrisy is they accuse you of the very thing
[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:26.040]  they're doing i actually think that's a technique but they actually they try to force you to have
[03:04:26.040 --> 03:04:32.440]  an opinion that they give you and if you're not on your guard you may actually take on that opinion
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:39.560]  it actually takes work to be a responsible being you actually have to really go wow i'm not going
[03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:44.520]  to immediately jump when they say jump i'm going to look at this which is what i did when this whole
[03:04:44.520 --> 03:04:50.520]  cobra thing began and by the way i want to really acknowledge this alex you and your guests i would
[03:04:50.520 --> 03:04:55.320]  guess saved millions of people by giving them the right information let's talk about that because
[03:04:55.320 --> 03:05:03.320]  the next attack's coming i'm dr peter mccullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you

[03:06:23.160 --> 03:06:26.760]  alex jones here back live final segment with our guest shon stone vimmy cubrick
[03:06:26.760 --> 03:06:29.960]  and then the great jay dark about a researcher the new world order he takes over in about 10
[03:06:29.960 --> 03:06:36.360]  minutes 15 minutes or so uh but but yes the the audience the crew our guest uh this whole
[03:06:36.360 --> 03:06:40.520]  operation deserves the credit she was getting into that of being the very tip of the spear
[03:06:40.520 --> 03:06:44.840]  exposing the virus out of the lab the lockdowns being a fraud the poison shot which is why it's
[03:06:44.840 --> 03:06:50.680]  so important we stay on here this whole community uh it's not about credit it's about recognizing
[03:06:50.680 --> 03:06:56.600]  we've been right and that they're they're trying to do new lockdowns new injections world IDs global
[03:06:58.600 --> 03:07:03.400]  passports to travel even leave your house and so vivian finish up your point well i think it's
[03:07:03.400 --> 03:07:08.920]  incredibly important because this is what we're pushing back against are the lies about info wars
[03:07:08.920 --> 03:07:16.280]  and the lies about alex is that alex his guests his crew everyone here have a mission a mission to
[03:07:16.280 --> 03:07:23.560]  set humanity free and to get the people that are criminally crushing humanity killing them at this
[03:07:23.560 --> 03:07:29.240]  point culling them um you're not going to get the information that you need in order to protect
[03:07:29.240 --> 03:07:35.640]  yourself and to understand what's being done to you probably from anywhere else that has such a
[03:07:35.640 --> 03:07:43.400]  vast audience as info wars so i believe that i know that when um covid happened i just moved back
[03:07:43.400 --> 03:07:47.960]  from florida to texas and i was just wobbling around i wasn't paying attention i walked into
[03:07:47.960 --> 03:07:52.440]  supermarket and everything had gone and i said what's happened they said haven't you heard about
[03:07:52.440 --> 03:07:58.680]  covid and i went no and i turned on alex and then immediately you were talking to francis boil
[03:07:58.680 --> 03:08:03.880]  dr francis or professor dr whatever francis boil and from the moment that you started reporting
[03:08:03.880 --> 03:08:09.800]  about it and having guests you completely educated me it let me go and find the documents myself
[03:08:09.800 --> 03:08:14.280]  it let me think about what was going on and then when i went to the supermarket and people
[03:08:14.280 --> 03:08:18.920]  were standing obediently six feet apart and having hysterics of anyone like pulled their
[03:08:18.920 --> 03:08:25.640]  mask down it gave me the freedom to observe what was happening instead of getting pulled into the
[03:08:25.640 --> 03:08:31.160]  hysteria and the one thing they want people to be is hysterical and frightened and waiting for the
[03:08:31.160 --> 03:08:34.760]  next well that's right well the enemy is this is our real brain trust with our guests and the whole
[03:08:34.760 --> 03:08:40.920]  family is that we did dead on a hundred percent nail what they were doing from previous research
[03:08:40.920 --> 03:08:45.080]  which shows we can beat them again when they tried again but that wasn't us that was just
[03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:49.160]  studying the globalist who think we're so dumb they admit why do the globalists admit
[03:08:49.720 --> 03:08:54.520]  shan stoner so much we're gonna do before they do it predictive programming because i think
[03:08:54.520 --> 03:08:57.960]  there well there's there's two aspects you you touch upon this a lot where everything has to be
[03:08:57.960 --> 03:09:02.840]  disclosed at some level right there has to be a certain level of transparency even if people
[03:09:02.840 --> 03:09:07.000]  don't believe it right because if you know sometimes you say hey i'm gonna punch you and then you
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:10.040]  actually do it the people still don't believe it they don't know wait a minute that must have been
[03:09:10.040 --> 03:09:15.640]  something else uh but uh there you know there is this sort of spiritual law around uh around
[03:09:16.280 --> 03:09:20.200]  revealing things and then there is the predictive programming which you could say is also designed
[03:09:20.200 --> 03:09:26.840]  to get people to to respond the way you want them to respond right so you put out movies like that
[03:09:26.840 --> 03:09:31.240]  soda burg film that was ridiculously bad about the pandemic right it was done a few years ago
[03:09:31.240 --> 03:09:35.160]  what was the name of it remember soda burg made it with uh anyway with jude law and all his people
[03:09:35.160 --> 03:09:39.400]  and this and how the cdc is racing to save everyone from this deadly new virus and oh yeah
[03:09:39.400 --> 03:09:42.840]  they even had a movie right before it came out that showed it yeah well it came out a few years
[03:09:42.840 --> 03:09:46.200]  ago and then the point was that like when the lockdown started all these people going oh it's
[03:09:46.200 --> 03:09:49.960]  trending on netflix everyone's gonna watch this movie again you know because it's it's this it's
[03:09:49.960 --> 03:09:54.920]  basically telling you how they want you to respond how you they want you to perceive the cdc as the
[03:09:54.920 --> 03:09:58.680]  savior they want you to perceive the government as the good guys right and that's a lot of the
[03:09:58.680 --> 03:10:03.080]  films in general that we we've seen across time right it's like consistently this idea of you know
[03:10:03.080 --> 03:10:07.800]  the good guys and you know in the un or whatever and you know in the good cia and then like there's
[03:10:07.800 --> 03:10:12.280]  a one rogue bad cia guy but the cia and generally is good right i mean this is what this the same
[03:10:12.280 --> 03:10:17.560]  narrative that's gets pushed across over and over to just get people to really be docile in a sense
[03:10:17.560 --> 03:10:23.160]  to not to not think for themselves to not realize that the government is not your friend and has
[03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:26.840]  has you know again has become this behemoth you know it's interesting about the federal government
[03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:32.920]  but it's about 40 percent of our gdp do you realize how much that that what that means to our reality
[03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:39.240]  the federal government is 40 percent of our gdp is a nation think about that and like all this
[03:10:39.240 --> 03:10:43.000]  spending all the military industrial complex so-called but it's everything it's pharma it's
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:46.680]  everything is spending money from the from the from the government and so in closing let me raise
[03:10:46.680 --> 03:10:51.640]  that the big front and center threat is zolensky i don't like the Russians invading i'm not choosing
[03:10:51.640 --> 03:10:56.440]  a side but nato started the war they overthrew the government eight years ago we all know
[03:10:56.440 --> 03:11:01.080]  that your dad made great films exposing it way before predicting it would all happen
[03:11:01.080 --> 03:11:05.720]  but now they fire a missile a hundred miles out of the bounds i say it's a any aircraft
[03:11:05.720 --> 03:11:09.880]  missile they later confirm it depending on since it doesn't matter it's still russia's fault and
[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:15.640]  zolensky calls for article five to be invoked and nato attack russia which will lead to nuclear war
[03:11:15.640 --> 03:11:19.400]  these people are out of their minds you know we know this i mean why haven't they gone for peace i
[03:11:19.400 --> 03:11:23.720]  mean the point was that we could have had a peace deal pretty quickly during you know right after
[03:11:23.720 --> 03:11:29.240]  the the invasion there was opportunity for peace and zolensky and company pulled out right and so
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:33.480]  and the u.s. has not pushed for peace since that time so here you know even russell brand is making
[03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:37.240]  fun of biden going this guy is sitting there like an old man on the side of the porch going you know
[03:11:37.240 --> 03:11:40.440]  if we stay on this course there's going to be a nuclear war it's like why don't you do something
[03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:44.920]  about it maybe you know maybe move towards peace why don't you it's they're insane and people
[03:11:44.920 --> 03:11:48.120]  take it as a russian loss they got a hundred thousand dead troops poorly a hundred thousand dead
[03:11:48.120 --> 03:11:55.800]  ukrainians no this is a real giant war in europe we know this has got to stop i mean without question
[03:11:55.800 --> 03:12:02.040]  war is slaughter war is what they need when they want to create chaos and do more controlling
[03:12:02.040 --> 03:12:10.520]  and another way to disguise the central bankers and their incredible irresponsible debt ocean
[03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:15.320]  that they've created for mankind and they want to keep hold of control so that's why they're going to
[03:12:15.320 --> 03:12:23.880]  try and bring in that central bank digital currency which will be a control system that i think would
[03:12:23.880 --> 03:12:29.640]  be the closest thing to being driven insane by how you have no more freedom anymore unless you're
[03:12:29.640 --> 03:12:34.520]  willing to sort of run around the woods and spare rabbits and live in a tree or something and even
[03:12:34.520 --> 03:12:39.320]  then they'll probably like send a drone and put a bullet in your head by the way i just want to
[03:12:39.320 --> 03:12:47.480]  really say it again or say and expand on this you've got to teach yourself about the technology of
[03:12:47.480 --> 03:12:53.560]  psyops because unless you understand how it works you're going to be vulnerable to it and there are
[03:12:53.560 --> 03:12:59.560]  certainly many places that you can find information about psyops but if you also look at the history
[03:12:59.560 --> 03:13:09.320]  of psychiatry and edward bernay's and the ways in which spies are are taught how to be spies you're
[03:13:09.320 --> 03:13:13.960]  going to understand more about how you're being manipulated so that you can catch it when it
[03:13:13.960 --> 03:13:18.520]  happens i mean most of us are kind and good hearted people so that's right if you're not aware
[03:13:18.520 --> 03:13:22.760]  that there's a war on for your mind yeah you're basically gonna lose that's right that's right
[03:13:23.640 --> 03:13:29.480]  exactly which is another reason why info wars is so incredibly important well i appreciate you guys
[03:13:29.480 --> 03:13:34.840]  the the what i'm happy about is i see so many great new talk show hosts and other talk show
[03:13:34.840 --> 03:13:39.720]  hosts really waking up that now you know because shan's been doing this forever so have i you
[03:13:39.720 --> 03:13:43.560]  obviously been awake a long time vivian but there's so many new people popping up i don't
[03:13:43.560 --> 03:13:47.080]  think their attempt to shut this down is gonna work no every time you it's like every time they
[03:13:47.080 --> 03:13:51.640]  take one out a hundred are born in metastasizes right and that's the beauty of this thing it's
[03:13:51.640 --> 03:13:56.120]  like the more that oh we censor one a thousand you know you end up with look at rumble and
[03:13:56.120 --> 03:14:00.760]  bitch you'd have popped up ever since youtube started banning you know conspiracy theorists right
[03:14:00.760 --> 03:14:05.800]  so it's just inevitability of human consciousness that the more they try to target and censor
[03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:10.120]  the more it actually leads to more people waking up and going hey wait maybe kairi is right you
[03:14:10.120 --> 03:14:15.720]  know maybe kanya is right right and that's the key is evil always loses and it doesn't mean we're
[03:14:15.720 --> 03:14:20.680]  perfect in our resistance to but we're trying to be good trying to find a real future for everybody
[03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:24.680]  and we're not gonna be happy until we do that uh shan you've got best-selling books you've got

[03:20:03.160 --> 03:20:17.240]  alex jones welcome back to the alice juncture i'm your guest so it's jay dyer of jason analysis
[03:20:17.240 --> 03:20:23.720]  that's as i was listening to vivian and shawn give their analysis of the way that we understand how
[03:20:23.720 --> 03:20:29.000]  the global power structure works i was really happy to hear them referring to organized crime
[03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:33.720]  and the structure of organized crime i give an interview this week on one of the largest
[03:20:33.720 --> 03:20:38.680]  true crime channels on youtube shawn atwood shout out to shawn atwood we had a whole 30 minute
[03:20:38.680 --> 03:20:44.520]  discussion of the history of organized crime how that ties into the assassination of jfk most
[03:20:44.520 --> 03:20:48.920]  likely that's one of the prevalent theories that seems to have the most evidence behind it of course
[03:20:48.920 --> 03:20:53.800]  i think there's other power players as well behind the assassination of jfk including
[03:20:53.800 --> 03:20:59.960]  intelligence agencies including foreign governments as well as organized crime and the mob and i
[03:20:59.960 --> 03:21:03.640]  wanted to review a little bit of that because that's one of the first things i discussed in the fourth
[03:21:03.640 --> 03:21:09.080]  hour two years ago on the alex juncture having uh been hosting the fourth hour an hour now for
[03:21:09.080 --> 03:21:17.240]  for two years a little over two years because this week it was a big big big news this huge dynamic
[03:21:17.240 --> 03:21:24.280]  scandal bigger than enron now right this uh ftx sam batman freed scandal and the more that you dig
[03:21:24.280 --> 03:21:30.840]  into this crazy rabbit hole what you find out is that not only was this uh you know a big scam and
[03:21:30.840 --> 03:21:36.040]  they were stealing money it was also funneled 40 30 40 million dollars to the democratic party for
[03:21:36.040 --> 03:21:42.040]  for uh for biden and we noticed that ftx as a platform popped up you know out of nowhere
[03:21:42.040 --> 03:21:46.520]  seemingly about three years ago and of course there were already large crypto exchanges
[03:21:46.520 --> 03:21:53.000]  that already existed like binance coinbase and then we have this sudden emerging thing on the
[03:21:53.000 --> 03:22:01.560]  scene with the face of the quasi-autistic afro-minded man boob figure of sam batman freed who supposedly
[03:22:01.560 --> 03:22:06.760]  this genius that nobody you know he's way beyond everybody he sleeps on a beanbag in his office
[03:22:06.760 --> 03:22:12.840]  and he's hairy he's got floppy hair and he just happens to be best friends with bill clinton and
[03:22:12.840 --> 03:22:17.960]  they're so close and it's just all going to be wonderful with all this crypto and then what do
[03:22:17.960 --> 03:22:27.000]  we know shocker it's a big huge bigger than enron scam and he's still tweeting he's still trying to
[03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:34.200]  explain himself as this altruistic billionaire who wants to give all of his money away as he lives
[03:22:34.200 --> 03:22:42.040]  together with a goblin face creature supposedly his quote girlfriend that they all sleep together
[03:22:42.040 --> 03:22:47.960]  in a giant orgy with 10 people living in an apartment complex i mean come on does anybody
[03:22:47.960 --> 03:22:51.960]  really believe that this guy was running this well it turns out as if you listen to bit boys
[03:22:51.960 --> 03:22:57.080]  interviews bit boy has dug really deep into this i think owen had bit boy on and they talked about
[03:22:57.800 --> 03:23:02.040]  the background to this whole scandal and over on bit boy's channel he's gone into depth with
[03:23:02.600 --> 03:23:10.120]  other people who this freed bird character who was involved in a famous early 2000s online poker
[03:23:10.120 --> 03:23:16.280]  scam and so it seems like they sort of recruited in these people who had a history of running
[03:23:16.280 --> 03:23:22.840]  high level scams and this was pumped up to the nth degree with all of these hollywood people all of
[03:23:22.840 --> 03:23:29.800]  these stars all these famous people pointing out how amazing ftx was ftx toke and all this stuff and
[03:23:29.800 --> 03:23:38.040]  it was and people are shocked at how fraudulent and fake all this is turning out to be yes there
[03:23:38.040 --> 03:23:45.880]  you go would you like to join these two in a round of coitus uh i know everybody's tempted
[03:23:45.880 --> 03:23:50.760]  in the audience for i try to hold back your temptation there um let's let's go take a cold
[03:23:50.760 --> 03:23:55.960]  shower real quick if you need to if you if you're giving into your base passions right now but i'm
[03:23:55.960 --> 03:24:02.600]  just joking um this is no shocker because as i'm listening to everybody talking about it's a it's
[03:24:02.600 --> 03:24:07.960]  a ponzi scheme it's a rug pool there's nothing behind the tokens it's fiat they're they're taking all
[03:24:07.960 --> 03:24:15.320]  the money that's exactly how the federal reserve works it's like everybody's shocked at that will
[03:24:15.320 --> 03:24:22.040]  wait till you find out that the federal reserve is the same scam system it's a giant rug pool ponzi
[03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:28.200]  scheme and if you go back you know creature from jackal island if you go back to woodrow wilson
[03:24:28.200 --> 03:24:34.280]  kernel colonel edwin mandel house who was the uh u k bank and elite agent who helped get all that
[03:24:34.280 --> 03:24:41.720]  legislation through who helped promote woodrow wilson setting up uh and and and uh weaponizing
[03:24:41.720 --> 03:24:46.280]  the federal reserve system which by the way is part of the uh communist manifesto if you didn't
[03:24:46.280 --> 03:24:50.440]  know you you might think that communists don't like bankers but in fact if you remember we
[03:24:50.440 --> 03:24:59.240]  did a whole breakdown of this famous book no in fact communism is has always had billionaire funding
[03:24:59.240 --> 03:25:03.560]  as did fascism fascism has the exact same history as professor anthony shut sudden has shown in his
[03:25:03.560 --> 03:25:11.640]  books so it also turns out that there seems to be connections to mit the background of ftx people
[03:25:11.640 --> 03:25:16.600]  at mit people in the finance department people connected to some of those epstein departments
[03:25:16.600 --> 03:25:23.080]  it turns out uh have these now and why is that well because this is a giant ponzi scheme a giant
[03:25:23.080 --> 03:25:33.080]  scam intended precisely to funnel people's money offshore and again if you are shocked by this i
[03:25:33.080 --> 03:25:39.320]  can't stress how shocking it is to you to understand that the dollar is the same you understand that
[03:25:39.320 --> 03:25:44.760]  they're doing the same thing with your tax money with the dollar especially when it moved off of
[03:25:44.760 --> 03:25:49.720]  the gold center but even prior to that dr carol quickly everybody knows how to hold up the books
[03:25:50.280 --> 03:25:56.280]  right it's just basically uh a show and tell book program over here in the fourth hour with me
[03:25:56.280 --> 03:26:02.040]  your library and nerd who does your homework for you dr carol quickly talks about how the
[03:26:02.920 --> 03:26:09.240]  the banker notes were always a fiat scam going back hundreds of years and they would uh print up
[03:26:09.240 --> 03:26:17.160]  more notes and flood the society with notes beyond the actual gold holdings that they had and that was
[03:26:17.160 --> 03:26:24.840]  part of this uh gold note scam and so uh the same thing uh is the model for the central bank
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:29.000]  that was set up throughout the the central bank so should they set up throughout the throughout
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:34.760]  europe uh throughout the 1800s and the 1900s and that became the model for the bank for
[03:26:34.760 --> 03:26:39.320]  international settlements which is the world reserve bank of world reserve banks the federal
[03:26:39.320 --> 03:26:44.760]  reserve of federal reserves it's the central federal reserve bank of the world federal reserve
[03:26:44.760 --> 03:26:52.120]  banking system they all are connected to that hub and most people don't know about this by design
[03:26:52.760 --> 03:26:59.720]  on purpose and that's why it occupies a central section of carol quickly straggling hope as well
[03:26:59.720 --> 03:27:04.040]  as a few other people who seem to have picked up on this over the years a few economists and a few
[03:27:04.040 --> 03:27:08.200]  people have written on this but for the most part people just are mystified and they they
[03:27:08.200 --> 03:27:14.200]  think it's like this big onion layered scheme scam of all of these different you know economics
[03:27:14.200 --> 03:27:19.960]  so the GDP and the jobs report and this report and that report and it's all a bunch of mystery and
[03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:26.680]  smoke and mirrors and guess what guess what's behind all that smoke and mirrors well it's not
[03:27:26.680 --> 03:27:37.400]  not stacks of gold at the Fort Knox right it's FTT scam tokens it's the exact same thing so if
[03:27:37.400 --> 03:27:42.600]  you're mad about fdx or if you think that all cryptos are scam crypto it's not a scam many
[03:27:42.600 --> 03:27:47.160]  cryptos are scams but you understand this has nothing to do for example with bitcoin bitcoin
[03:27:47.160 --> 03:27:53.880]  is the preeminent inflationary it's the hardest asset it's completely inflationary uh resistant
[03:27:53.880 --> 03:28:00.520]  because it has the fixed number of coins that can never be inflated beyond the fixed number when
[03:28:00.520 --> 03:28:07.000]  the last bitcoin is mined and so it's extremely rare and for that reason it is not like these kinds
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:14.200]  of uh proof of stake coins that are all just printed out of thin air uh these are all again
[03:28:14.200 --> 03:28:21.560]  literally modeled on the Federal Reserve system on the inron style scam system on the coming carbon
[03:28:21.560 --> 03:28:27.480]  scam system when they pull out the roll out the carbon credits and the carbon tokens and the carbon
[03:28:27.480 --> 03:28:32.520]  based cryptos those are already starting to roll out guess what they're the exact same model as
[03:28:32.520 --> 03:28:39.480]  ftx and all of the other collapsed scam models uh luna terra luna that collapsed uh what three or
[03:28:39.480 --> 03:28:46.120]  four months ago exact same scam model exact same rug pull exact same uh you can earn 30% by staking
[03:28:46.120 --> 03:28:51.320]  by staking your coins and it's just printed out of nowhere that's all the the scam stolen money
[03:28:51.320 --> 03:28:55.240]  right and they're gambling with your money that you put on the exchange don't go anywhere this is

[03:33:27.480 --> 03:33:33.400]  national security advisor he did not get that post that was blocked i think that involved mich mcconnell
[03:33:33.400 --> 03:33:38.760]  if i recall but uh colonel mcgregor is uh a frequent guest on tucker carlson you may have
[03:33:38.760 --> 03:33:43.800]  seen him or heard of him and we did a full hour breakdown of everything from the great reset to

[03:34:22.200 --> 03:34:28.840]  juniors so if you're familiar with tarkofsky's films and uh the the amazing art that he put out
[03:34:28.840 --> 03:34:35.400]  over the years films like stalker films like solaris films like uh rublev sort of capturing the
[03:34:35.400 --> 03:34:42.200]  history and the essence of eurasia and russia especially in art and iconography we went really
[03:34:42.200 --> 03:34:48.520]  deep into the the breakdown of andrei juniors documentary that he put out it's it's now at the
[03:34:48.520 --> 03:34:53.880]  criterion collection uh cinema prayer about his father about andrei tarkofsky so tarkofsky of

[03:35:09.960 --> 03:35:15.000]  rockfin channel so if you're looking for information like that uh that's a little edgier a little a
[03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:19.640]  little sooner than other stuff you can uh subscribe to me over on rockfin i think greg rees is uh
[03:35:19.640 --> 03:35:24.520]  maybe coming over to rockfin as well paul joseph watson's on rockfin too so a lot of a lot of cool
[03:35:24.520 --> 03:35:30.120]  stuff over there um you know we were talking about this the scam model how the scams work
[03:35:35.720 --> 03:35:42.520]  and these scams uh are structured in the way that a lot of uh intelligence agencies have structured
[03:35:43.240 --> 03:35:49.240]  uh uh secrets and cells secret societies and cells over the years and so if we think about
[03:35:49.240 --> 03:35:55.800]  how for example organized crime set up the the the secret societies that they had we go back to
[03:35:55.800 --> 03:36:02.920]  sicily in the 1800s 1700s this is the the the origin of the omerta which is a secret oath a
[03:36:02.920 --> 03:36:10.600]  death oath that you make to your dawn to the dawn of uh the local that time it was a militia but the
[03:36:10.600 --> 03:36:16.840]  militias are actually the local militias is where we get the idea of the sicilian mafia now when
[03:36:16.840 --> 03:36:22.440]  the a lot of the immigrants came over to the us they didn't find a lot of help with the existing
[03:36:22.440 --> 03:36:27.800]  local police so naturally they would continue their model of local neighborhood militia and
[03:36:27.800 --> 03:36:32.920]  that's where we get the ideas of the dawn and this kind of stuff but the omerta the secret ritual
[03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:39.240]  which is actually a copy from certain masonic rituals and masonic groups out of italy's known
[03:36:39.240 --> 03:36:44.840]  as the carbonari the sort of uh they copied this and that's because one of the uh early
[03:36:44.840 --> 03:36:51.720]  italian revolutionaries uh was in his name is garibaldi he was influenced by Giuseppe Mazzini
[03:36:51.720 --> 03:36:55.800]  who was one of the most famous there you go exactly this is the omerta scene in sopranos
[03:36:56.520 --> 03:37:02.200]  and uh i'm sure if you if you've never seen the sopranos uh i highly recommend checking it out
[03:37:02.200 --> 03:37:10.360]  because there's a lot of gabagool a lot of gabagool a lot of goomars and a lot of goombas
[03:37:10.360 --> 03:37:15.080]  up in the sopranos but it's a great show we did a whole uh two hour breakdown of that show by the
[03:37:15.080 --> 03:37:20.600]  way if you're looking for a great podcast getting into uh all the really insightful elements in
[03:37:20.600 --> 03:37:25.800]  that show including there's the omerta right there where you burn the image of the saint uh and you
[03:37:25.800 --> 03:37:31.480]  sort of take a blood oath but there's also references to you know the tie-in with organized
[03:37:31.480 --> 03:37:37.240]  crime and intelligence agencies there's references to the cia to uh tony having to at times collude
[03:37:37.240 --> 03:37:42.680]  with the fbi all of that comes up in that show uh consistently throughout gathering one of the one
[03:37:42.680 --> 03:37:48.680]  of the best tv shows ever made honestly um but it's instructive again because as you heard uh vivian
[03:37:48.680 --> 03:37:53.480]  i think uh mentioned in the last hour you know the organized crime model is really the best way to
[03:37:53.480 --> 03:37:59.720]  understand how the global elites run things now this may sound like oh yeah of course there's
[03:37:59.720 --> 03:38:04.520]  organized crime yeah we all know that but people just still can't figure out there's this block
[03:38:04.520 --> 03:38:09.880]  in their head this roadblock between there being organized crime and global organized crime they
[03:38:09.880 --> 03:38:14.280]  just cannot figure this out they cannot figure out that giant pharmaceutical corporations
[03:38:14.280 --> 03:38:20.280]  operate like organized crime they can't figure out that giant international banking institutions
[03:38:20.280 --> 03:38:27.320]  operate like organized crime now we just had a giant institution that collapsed guess what it's
[03:38:27.320 --> 03:38:33.640]  operating on an organized crime model and it's not run by nerdy do with an afro okay he's not
[03:38:33.640 --> 03:38:38.040]  he's the face of that he's the front of that and the the face the front people they take the fault
[03:38:38.040 --> 03:38:42.920]  and the media right now is running cover for them mainstream media is running cover for san bachman
[03:38:42.920 --> 03:38:49.320]  for oh he's altruistic it's not his fault it's all these other people well yeah maybe he's just
[03:38:49.320 --> 03:38:53.240]  he's just the front man but they're covering up because they know it shows that the giant
[03:38:53.240 --> 03:39:01.160]  establishment uh leftist especially democratic party uh system is a big scam and it totally
[03:39:01.160 --> 03:39:07.320]  exposes all that and it exposes that because it's kind of always been that way all right and I'm not
[03:39:07.320 --> 03:39:11.880]  saying that the republican party doesn't have a much of a phonies and con artists as well I mean
[03:39:11.880 --> 03:39:17.480]  it's they're they're basically the same party for the most part right except for a few outliers and
[03:39:17.480 --> 03:39:21.480]  people that you know people on this broadcast all know about the for the most part these people are
[03:39:21.480 --> 03:39:28.440]  all part of the same a big scam and crypto was just one of those easier ways to kind of mask
[03:39:28.440 --> 03:39:35.000]  the scammery by selling people on the idea that the federal reserve model of fiat system oh let's
[03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:40.280]  just put that into crypto do the exact same thing where we can print up infinite amounts of digits
[03:39:40.280 --> 03:39:44.920]  on the screen and just say oh yeah well there's there's a zillion ftt token and we'll just keep
[03:39:44.920 --> 03:39:50.680]  inflating the price of the fake coin and as people invest they will take the investor's money and put
[03:39:50.680 --> 03:39:57.240]  it into his own betting and investments and uh you know again it's obvious that this is just
[03:39:57.240 --> 03:40:03.960]  the exact same model of the federal reserve scam debt based system applied to the crypto world
[03:40:03.960 --> 03:40:09.400]  and the whole point of bitcoin itself bitcoin which is nothing to do with any of these things
[03:40:09.400 --> 03:40:18.440]  none of these scams bitcoin is it exists to fight that model that's its purpose so you know I think
[03:40:18.440 --> 03:40:23.320]  a lot of people kind of uh we were open to the possibility of where ethereum might go ethereum
[03:40:23.320 --> 03:40:30.280]  was for many many years based on this idea of uh proof of work like bitcoin model and then it
[03:40:30.280 --> 03:40:36.680]  recently switched to quote proof of stake and admitted to the uh uh censoring so tornado cash
[03:40:36.680 --> 03:40:41.480]  these are the recent scandals in the domain of ethereum have proven that ethereum is now part of
[03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:46.520]  global coin in fact claus even says he likes it now actually i'll see him we'll call him it's
[03:40:46.520 --> 03:40:50.520]  i'll see him so while we might have withheld judgment and been open to the possibility now
[03:40:50.520 --> 03:40:55.240]  it's gone into full on it's part of apparently it seems like it wants to go in them in the direction
[03:40:55.240 --> 03:41:02.200]  of uh claus coin global coin because now they they're willing to admit uh uh censoring when
[03:41:02.200 --> 03:41:09.320]  they're requested to censor at the uh the node level and that's not what bitcoin is bitcoin
[03:41:09.320 --> 03:41:13.720]  is not that you see so it's different so a lot of people who don't know about this sector they
[03:41:13.720 --> 03:41:18.200]  kind of class it all together and every time there's a shakeout oh it's because it's all a scam
[03:41:18.200 --> 03:41:24.120]  it's not all a scam that's why all of these other coins are not modeled like bitcoin is modeled right
[03:41:24.120 --> 03:41:30.120]  and so again it's kind of sort of vindicates max keiser in a way right max keiser max keiser bitcoin
[03:41:30.120 --> 03:41:36.440]  bitcoin is vindicated because it's all the bitcoin people right make max michael sailor
[03:41:36.440 --> 03:41:42.200]  max keiser who had been saying for the last year that these entities are going to start
[03:41:42.200 --> 03:41:45.640]  collapsing you're going to you're going to see you know there's three arrows capital you're
[03:41:45.640 --> 03:41:50.600]  going to see voyager you're going to see uh terra luna you're going to see because the same model
[03:41:50.600 --> 03:41:56.040]  had been done in the past through exchanges like mount gox which got hacked many many years ago
[03:41:56.040 --> 03:42:01.720]  bit connect was another one of these uh ponzi scams that that collapsed based on paying people out
[03:42:01.720 --> 03:42:06.680]  of money made tokens made out of thin air basically so these were all just scam models that's all i'm
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:11.080]  trying to say and that doesn't mean that everybody or everything in crypto is a scam that's why it
[03:42:11.080 --> 03:42:18.520]  wasn't about bitcoin it was about everything but bitcoin you see and most of the global elites
[03:42:18.520 --> 03:42:24.520]  don't like bitcoin openly right bill gates i wish we never had bitcoin right hillary get
[03:42:24.520 --> 03:42:29.880]  rid of bitcoin they all do not like that because that's one of the ones that they can't control
[03:42:30.520 --> 03:42:35.000]  because it's actually decentralized these other ones are completely centralized
[03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:41.240]  and are based on the print out of thin air scam debt model that is the federal reserve model and
[03:42:41.240 --> 03:42:45.880]  that's why this was all promoted for the last three years with zillions of dollars by all these
[03:42:45.880 --> 03:42:52.600]  democrats and all these uh you know wall street uh cnbc people to pump this up because it was a scam
[03:42:53.960 --> 03:42:58.840]  don't go anywhere this is the ox Jones show me you guys toast jay dire until about 150 years ago
[03:42:58.840 --> 03:43:05.720]  cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter
[03:43:05.720 --> 03:43:11.960]  because of something called vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold
[03:43:11.960 --> 03:43:17.320]  weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was
[03:43:17.320 --> 03:43:25.080]  killing people was a lack of vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body
[03:43:25.080 --> 03:43:31.000]  produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3
[03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:35.160]  and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body
[03:43:35.160 --> 03:43:39.880]  over so now it's more important than ever because the winter's here to take high quality vitamin

[03:46:01.960 --> 03:46:07.160]  the paper ballots and they're done in a day why can't we do this here the answer is fraud and
[03:46:07.160 --> 03:46:12.280]  corruption if we don't fix the system it doesn't matter whether republican nominees donald trump
[03:46:12.280 --> 03:46:17.640]  or governor de sanctimonious they're going to deny us michigan they're going to deny us pennsylvania
[03:46:17.640 --> 03:46:24.680]  they're going to deny us arizona and i can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[03:46:24.680 --> 03:46:30.680]  where i believe there is an america first majority in every single one of them so
[03:46:30.680 --> 03:46:36.440]  we need to keep fighting for reform of the system tucker crossin said this better last night than
[03:46:36.440 --> 03:46:42.680]  anything else communications are the reason why we didn't well that's why info wars.com is so damn
[03:46:42.680 --> 03:46:47.880]  important that's why they're so desperate to take you off the air alix people need to get behind
[03:46:47.880 --> 03:46:54.280]  info wars this alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important we
[03:46:54.280 --> 03:47:02.120]  need more of this communications not less leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[03:47:02.120 --> 03:47:19.560]  order it's alex jones i'm just joking that's my entertaining person but welcome back to the
[03:47:19.560 --> 03:47:26.200]  alex jones i'm your guest says j dire we're talking about the structures of large-scale
[03:47:26.200 --> 03:47:34.280]  scammery large-scale deception large-scale financial bamboozlery and particularly the
[03:47:34.280 --> 03:47:43.080]  federal reserve system is kind of actually pretty much the same as the fdx collapse scandal system
[03:47:43.080 --> 03:47:46.760]  so there's been a lot of these as we pointed out and the reason i was bringing in organized crime
[03:47:46.760 --> 03:47:51.240]  is that one thing organized crime uh got pretty adept at in this i guess still pretty adept at
[03:47:51.880 --> 03:47:57.640]  is financial scammery so we often think of you know mobsters organized crime as you know
[03:47:58.200 --> 03:48:03.160]  being involved in a little bit of sanitation that take out the dead body take a little bit of the
[03:48:03.160 --> 03:48:09.080]  trash you gotta go now but that's not all they do organized crime is also involved pretty heavily
[03:48:09.080 --> 03:48:13.880]  in large-scale financial scammery and that actually comes up throughout the sopranos as well there's
[03:48:13.880 --> 03:48:20.920]  many episodes where tony gets involved in a big-scale gentrification hud type of scam right
[03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:25.240]  and that's reference i think it's season one or two very similar to the stuff that catherine
[03:48:25.240 --> 03:48:31.560]  allston fits had investigated uh amazingly and there's a couple other episodes where you know
[03:48:31.560 --> 03:48:37.720]  tony gets involved in these high-level financial scams that at one point he sets up a front thing
[03:48:37.720 --> 03:48:44.440]  that is it that has to do with uh stock scams right and uh stock trading and whatnot and he
[03:48:44.440 --> 03:48:48.760]  puts a couple guys running this and that works for a little while it makes maybe a few million
[03:48:48.760 --> 03:48:55.640]  dollars something like that and so but those are models on a micro scale for what big-scale
[03:48:55.640 --> 03:49:02.040]  scammers do on a macro scale and it's just amazing to me that you know people can figure this out at
[03:49:02.040 --> 03:49:09.720]  the local level they can figure it out that maybe even their governor at a state level maybe even the
[03:49:09.720 --> 03:49:16.280]  president or some government official is involved in a scam but they can't figure it out beyond these
[03:49:16.920 --> 03:49:22.920]  goofy public official people as if there aren't billionaires involved in scams as if there aren't
[03:49:22.920 --> 03:49:30.600]  people you know like ftx scale people multi billion dollar scams now everybody knows about
[03:49:30.600 --> 03:49:35.080]  in ron everybody knows about bernie made off and now everybody knows about ftx but
[03:49:36.040 --> 03:49:40.280]  do you think that that's it like that that's the only scams that go on or that's the only
[03:49:40.280 --> 03:49:43.880]  deception that goes on you don't think that it goes on at the level of the federal reserve
[03:49:44.520 --> 03:49:47.320]  doesn't go on the level of the bank for international settlements
[03:49:49.320 --> 03:49:54.360]  what about the level of davos in the world economic forum could they possibly be involved
[03:49:54.360 --> 03:50:00.680]  in economic scammery or all do you think that they're all altruistic people who want to help you
[03:50:00.680 --> 03:50:08.120]  like sam bankman free are they just sweet nice people they want that they care about your health
[03:50:09.240 --> 03:50:14.280]  they want you to be happy and healthy while they also want you to not be around right i mean
[03:50:14.280 --> 03:50:19.720]  how can people not figure this out i'm mystified by this and so the point of this is that well how
[03:50:19.720 --> 03:50:24.680]  do we understand sam bankman free and and then and then ftx and then the democratic party connection
[03:50:24.680 --> 03:50:30.680]  there well it's like mafia it's like organized crime you got to work for the big boys you know
[03:50:30.680 --> 03:50:38.120]  we'll promote you on the global stage for the next three years sam come work for us you be the nerdy
[03:50:38.120 --> 03:50:44.520]  tech face of crypto because presumably from the psychological warfare vantage point from the market
[03:50:44.520 --> 03:50:53.000]  research the only people into crypto are nerds so you're the face of it maybe other silicon
[03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:58.280]  valley companies with nerdy face people are the same you think you think maybe maybe uh something
[03:50:58.280 --> 03:51:01.960]  like facebook is something like i don't know what do you think i don't know what do you think you
[03:51:01.960 --> 03:51:09.480]  think about this maybe this is a model for other things i don't know and then you do what we say
[03:51:09.480 --> 03:51:21.160]  however if things go sour maybe you don't pay your dues what happens well you take the fall
[03:51:22.360 --> 03:51:26.680]  you're the fall guy you're the you're the man that is the face of this and you you're the one
[03:51:26.680 --> 03:51:31.080]  that calls all this maybe we'll run a little interference for you for the you know mainstream
[03:51:31.080 --> 03:51:36.280]  media and we'll try to say that you know you're just this autistic genius savant nerd guy but
[03:51:36.280 --> 03:51:43.400]  but no uh it ultimately right uh this this guy might take the fall as if it's just one guy
[03:51:43.960 --> 03:51:48.520]  and that's another lie the system's always propping up right like oh it's just this one dude it's
[03:51:48.520 --> 03:51:54.120]  one we got one bad apple over here we'll root the bad apples as if this is not a gigant or scam
[03:51:54.680 --> 03:52:01.240]  with obviously a lot of high level connections but of course the high level people the dons
[03:52:01.240 --> 03:52:08.920]  not don tron the dons the don in the sense of the mob uh don right the structure of the mafia
[03:52:08.920 --> 03:52:12.840]  that if you didn't know this the reason that it was so successful for many decades in the 30s 40s
[03:52:12.840 --> 03:52:19.640]  and 50s was a cell model where a lot of the foot soldiers they didn't actually know who was running
[03:52:19.640 --> 03:52:25.960]  things they might know about the don but they might not even meet him very much right so they
[03:52:25.960 --> 03:52:31.480]  might they don't really know it's compartmentalized it's a cell structure and it was so successful
[03:52:31.480 --> 03:52:36.920]  and hard to bust because a lot of the soldiers they would interact with the bosses but the
[03:52:36.920 --> 03:52:44.920]  boss alone interacted with the don and so that's one way one model by which this type of thing
[03:52:44.920 --> 03:52:50.440]  was so successful and that's also a portrayed throughout this apprentice as well uh because
[03:52:50.440 --> 03:52:56.680]  remember uh you know tony's not really a don tony is uh a boss right and he's got soldiers under
[03:52:56.680 --> 03:53:01.960]  under him but you know tony has to interact with and and and deal with the five the dons of the
[03:53:01.960 --> 03:53:06.040]  five families right and so it's every now and then he'll have to drive he has to drive over to new
[03:53:06.040 --> 03:53:13.000]  york and and talk to the the various dons but tony's not exactly at that level he's he's sort of
[03:53:13.000 --> 03:53:19.160]  below that um and so he's you know oftentimes having to do chris get christopher you know the
[03:53:19.160 --> 03:53:23.080]  main foot soldier throughout the series to go and do all these operations and run all this stuff
[03:53:24.040 --> 03:53:31.640]  and so but christopher has to pay right his cut right when he gets uh made if you remember in the
[03:53:31.640 --> 03:53:37.160]  show that comes with new responsibilities right so christopher his whole life he he lacks his
[03:53:37.160 --> 03:53:42.280]  father figure he looks up to tony tony plays this father figure role when he finally gets made uh
[03:53:42.280 --> 03:53:50.040]  from uh uh you know being just sort of a a a a thug to a maid man with status it comes with
[03:53:50.040 --> 03:53:54.920]  all these responsibilities and now he has to give you even more money right now he owes more money
[03:53:54.920 --> 03:54:02.920]  he has to do more scammery more uh uh operations to bring tony a bigger cut so all what he thought
[03:54:02.920 --> 03:54:09.960]  was all this power and prestige and honor was actually just uh even further signing his soul
[03:54:09.960 --> 03:54:15.000]  over to the devil and there's that's actually a big part of the show where um over time you know
[03:54:15.000 --> 03:54:20.840]  christopher starts to realize that he's basically made a deal with the devil and this ends up in
[03:54:20.840 --> 03:54:26.600]  him having a an after-death or near-death experience for where he gets shot and he sees himself in hell
[03:54:27.160 --> 03:54:31.080]  all right and he relates this uh you know throughout midway throughout the show anyway
[03:54:31.080 --> 03:54:37.560]  the point is just that this is the model for understanding how uh the elite in our day run
[03:54:37.560 --> 03:54:42.520]  things on a grander scale it's the exact same and that that was the point vivian kuber was
[03:54:42.520 --> 03:54:46.760]  making in the previous hour so hopefully everybody caught that and you know shan stone was making
[03:54:46.760 --> 03:54:52.360]  the same point with secret societies and spies and spy networks and all that is the same stuff
[03:54:52.360 --> 03:54:57.960]  with this right with with organized crime and you know that's what this is you know controlling
[03:54:57.960 --> 03:55:05.240]  the black markets right brzezinski he made that famous comment that it wasn't just a matter of uh
[03:55:05.240 --> 03:55:09.960]  you know in terms of geopolitics controlling legitimate markets it was also uh necessary
[03:55:09.960 --> 03:55:15.480]  to control the black markets that that's a big part of controlling things on the geopolitical
[03:55:15.480 --> 03:55:20.280]  grand chess board running black markets as well and so this is where you get into you know a lot
[03:55:20.280 --> 03:55:25.480]  of the dark stuff that everybody's heard about and that has come out in the last several years
[03:55:25.480 --> 03:55:31.640]  right in regarding you know regarding international black market type stuff and this also relates to
[03:55:31.640 --> 03:55:36.520]  elections uh if you remember and this is all everybody's talking about this in the last week
[03:55:36.520 --> 03:55:42.520]  because of the midterm elections and it's sort of like you can't talk about uh election fraud or
[03:55:42.520 --> 03:55:49.560]  scammery you're not supposed to talk about that even though that is a fact of history so facts of
[03:55:49.560 --> 03:55:56.040]  history and it's even well known that the us has employed certain people to fix elections in other
[03:55:56.040 --> 03:56:02.280]  countries for the last 60 70 80 years there's people who are fixers who go for intelligence
[03:56:02.280 --> 03:56:09.320]  agencies and go and fix elections i think roger stone even did a whole breakdown of who fixed
[03:56:09.320 --> 03:56:14.200]  elections in other countries and might have been involved in uh fixing the previous presidential
[03:56:14.200 --> 03:56:19.320]  election there was a big big famous essay that roger stone did so uh two or three years ago on
[03:56:19.320 --> 03:56:24.280]  that very thing pointing this out is this kind of should be well known but no you can't even mention
[03:56:24.280 --> 03:56:31.160]  that so as the world government is put into place as gigantic financial scam institutions collapse
[03:56:31.800 --> 03:56:40.280]  you you can't talk about it and you're bad if you do but also it's not that bad right so for
[03:56:40.280 --> 03:56:44.040]  for years and years and years there was no global government you're bad uh if you mentioned that
[03:56:44.040 --> 03:56:48.040]  you're crazy by the way there is a global government and it's a good thing and if you don't like it
[03:56:48.040 --> 03:56:53.240]  it's because you're a bigot and you're a small minded so it's just gasoline just like you know
[03:56:53.240 --> 03:56:59.800]  half of my videos on youtube have the uh great reset uh warning from wikipedia the the new
[03:56:59.800 --> 03:57:06.040]  world order warning from wikipedia and it went it went viral on twitter this week that as you talk
[03:57:06.040 --> 03:57:16.920]  about the global government summit that's going on there's a warning pops up to tell you that this
[03:57:16.920 --> 03:57:24.520]  is disinformation and conspiracy theory that there's a global government summit as it is going on
[03:57:25.880 --> 03:57:31.960]  amazingly that is or well that is gaslighting and hopefully everybody can recognize this hopefully
[03:57:31.960 --> 03:57:39.080]  everybody has enough common sense and enough IQ points left to figure that out with staring
[03:57:39.080 --> 03:57:43.080]  everybody in the face this is the alex joneshow don't go anywhere this is j direb j's analysis
[03:57:43.080 --> 03:57:47.400]  follow me on youtube follow me on social media and also support alex in the store in arizona
[03:57:47.400 --> 03:57:54.120]  i think we watched the election be uh stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in
[03:57:54.120 --> 03:58:02.040]  ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's
[03:58:02.040 --> 03:58:08.280]  election month alex it's not election day and that's the problem and everything changed after
[03:58:08.280 --> 03:58:16.360]  covid-19 they illegally changed state elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes
[03:58:16.360 --> 03:58:21.480]  mailing multiple ballots to people well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious
[03:58:21.480 --> 03:58:26.920]  country when we have elections that can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe
[03:58:26.920 --> 03:58:32.680]  the election was stolen in 2020 and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for
[03:58:32.680 --> 03:58:38.760]  the media and the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity and question the
[03:58:38.760 --> 03:58:45.000]  the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election
