[00:00.000 --> 00:13.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.440 --> 00:22.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.200 --> 00:36.120]  here we are live kicking off the 28 hour live transmission it is 9 16 on this
[00:36.120 --> 00:41.560]  Wednesday thank you so much for joining us already so deep into the year
[00:41.560 --> 00:52.520]  September 16th 2015 over the next 28 hours we have just an incredible lineup of
[00:52.520 --> 00:58.880]  live guest of anchors and reporters that will also be hosting the show I'll be
[00:58.880 --> 01:03.120]  popping in live as well I will host three hours today and obviously three
[01:03.120 --> 01:11.080]  hours tomorrow the full lineup is at info wars.com forward slash money bomb and
[01:11.080 --> 01:19.560]  we're also going to add a icon up at the upper right hand corner of info wars.com
[01:19.560 --> 01:24.120]  that will lead you directly there this year the crew basically did the
[01:24.120 --> 01:28.760]  preparation for this special transmission almost by themselves I was
[01:28.760 --> 01:32.640]  not involved in it a lot they've done an incredible job with so much background
[01:32.640 --> 01:37.960]  research so much documentary film production lining up the guest and so
[01:37.960 --> 01:42.000]  much more so I just want to salute the work they've done we're going to be
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.120]  sending out on Twitter and of course on Facebook more links to the 28 hour live
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.960]  broadcast transmission it's about to take place now when we attempt to raise a
[01:52.960 --> 01:57.160]  million dollars today that sounds like a lot of money but when you actually know
[01:57.160 --> 02:01.640]  how much a media company even a smaller one like this one cost to run it's
[02:01.640 --> 02:06.360]  basically what's needed for this year satellite closed captioning and some of
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.080]  the other accoutrement that goes along with the syndication of a radio slash
[02:11.080 --> 02:16.000]  TV transmission but we already have a lot of affiliates picking us up even
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.280]  though we had to officially announce that the satellite's been up for the last
[02:18.280 --> 02:21.600]  month we're talking about some of those new affiliates and some of the
[02:21.600 --> 02:26.160]  responses they've already been getting UHFVHF and also major cable channels and
[02:26.160 --> 02:30.680]  cities like Houston so I know we have program directors station owners
[02:30.680 --> 02:36.400]  channel owners channel managers program directors across the country that are
[02:36.400 --> 02:41.120]  listeners and quite frankly we're just going directly to them and going
[02:41.120 --> 02:44.560]  directly to you the listeners to send them the links that we're going to be
[02:44.560 --> 02:49.480]  announcing and launching today and in the next few days that take people to
[02:49.480 --> 02:55.000]  the affiliate pages so that folks can find out more about that but info wars
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.840]  com forward slash money bomb we're also going to add to the front page a big
[03:00.840 --> 03:08.000]  red link that simply says live feed 28-hour special broadcast or 28-hour
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.320]  special live broadcast live feed so you can also send that link to your friends
[03:14.320 --> 03:23.000]  and family out there so they can tune in I will also go over the schedule that I
[03:23.000 --> 03:31.440]  have for the 28-hour broadcast and exactly who is coming up on the show
[03:31.440 --> 03:37.600]  today we're also obviously going to get into the news and have a lot of special
[03:37.600 --> 03:42.720]  guests you'll probably have ten minutes an hour of us talking about supporting
[03:42.720 --> 03:49.560]  info wars and the launch of the TV satellite system and the rest of it and
[03:49.560 --> 03:55.480]  the main body of the next 28 hours will be at least three new documentaries that
[03:55.480 --> 04:01.520]  we've shot one in Rome one in Arkansas and another here in Austin so the most
[04:01.520 --> 04:06.480]  important subjects out there bar none some really powerful stuff inside the
[04:06.480 --> 04:10.760]  Vatican with a big Vatican insider that's blown the whistle years ago and so much
[04:10.760 --> 04:16.000]  of what he said came true his legos agami I've never had him on because quite
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.440]  frankly I thought what he was saying was pretty outlandish it shows how
[04:19.440 --> 04:23.400]  crazy stuff's gotten people think I'm outlandish I mean he said there's a
[04:23.400 --> 04:29.200]  pedophile ring inside the Vatican and they're going to make the Pope step down
[04:29.200 --> 04:34.440]  they're gonna put a Jesuit Pope in the current when he said this about a year
[04:34.440 --> 04:39.360]  and a half before it happened and he just laid it all out and there I am on
[04:39.360 --> 04:42.400]  the outside of the Vatican with police coming over trying to stop us from
[04:42.400 --> 04:45.760]  filming even though we weren't on the Vatican and while he's talking for 30
[04:45.760 --> 04:49.920]  minutes a thunderstorm starts binding with lightning basically striking the
[04:49.920 --> 04:54.800]  Vatican and on the cover of his book there's lightning striking the Vatican
[04:54.800 --> 05:01.420]  I mean it was they wrote years ago it's really weird that's coming up the Miss
[05:01.420 --> 05:06.040]  America pageant is known for beautiful women who sometimes give rather amusing
[05:06.040 --> 05:10.520]  answers but recently Miss South Carolina turned the tide when she was asked
[05:10.520 --> 05:17.200]  about this do you support a ban on military style assault weapons I don't
[05:17.200 --> 05:20.440]  but I think it's because we need to increase education we have to go back
[05:20.440 --> 05:24.520]  there if we teach people the proper way to use guns then we will reduce the
[05:24.520 --> 05:31.120]  risk of having gun related gun related accident it starts with education even
[05:31.120 --> 05:35.400]  before she could finish answering her question her response received a massive
[05:35.400 --> 05:39.320]  applause demonstrating strong support for gun rights despite the
[05:39.320 --> 05:44.040]  establishment's ongoing gun demonization campaign and yes there have been
[05:44.040 --> 05:48.120]  high-profile slayings with fully automatic rifles but the FBI's own
[05:48.120 --> 05:51.680]  numbers show that you're more likely to be killed by a blunt object such as a
[05:51.680 --> 06:00.400]  baseball bat or hammer you can find more reports on info wars dot com a clean

[08:36.680 --> 08:44.680]  on the waterfall for bringing their kids to a battle that's right the main reason we went into Iraq at the time was we thought he had weapons of mass destruction
[08:44.680 --> 08:50.440]  turns out he didn't but he had the capacity to make weapons of mass destruction but I also talked about the human suffering in Iraq
[08:50.440 --> 08:55.360]  hello boys and girls I have a special message for you from the president of
[08:55.360 --> 08:59.440]  the United States I salute the boys and girls who are buying United States
[08:59.440 --> 09:03.760]  saving stamps and bonds and they're giving important support to the cause of
[09:03.760 --> 09:07.440]  freedom and the men who fight for us in Vietnam
[09:07.440 --> 09:14.440]  Congress gave us this authority in August 1964
[09:14.440 --> 09:20.720]  to do whatever may be necessary that's pretty far-reaching that's the sky is the
[09:20.720 --> 09:24.720]  limits as an American citizen you have to respect our president whether I like it
[09:24.720 --> 09:29.080]  or not it's really not not my decision but I do respect my president and I will
[09:29.080 --> 09:39.200]  support whatever decision he makes music play and people sign just for me the
[09:39.200 --> 09:48.640]  church bells rang it is a hard fact that us strikes have resulted in civilian
[09:48.640 --> 10:01.480]  casualties now he's gone I don't know why until this day sometimes I cry he
[10:01.480 --> 10:08.160]  didn't even say goodbye he didn't take the time to lie the United States knows
[10:08.160 --> 10:12.760]  that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction well the first things they told me was
[10:12.760 --> 10:17.480]  you're not even to acknowledge the drone program you're not even to discuss that
[10:17.480 --> 10:24.400]  exists renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the ICs and the
[10:24.400 --> 10:31.760]  Gulf of pumpkin have today required me to order the military forces of the United
[10:31.760 --> 10:40.040]  States to take action and reply that reply is crashing through the lies and
[10:40.040 --> 10:50.880]  disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network we now take you live to
[10:50.880 --> 10:55.400]  the central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance you're
[10:55.400 --> 11:00.840]  listening to the Alex Jones show well it's what so many people have been
[11:00.840 --> 11:07.560]  waiting for we haven't done a 24-hour broadcast in three years we've done
[11:07.560 --> 11:12.560]  some 10-hour broadcast covering elections five six-hour special broadcast
[11:12.560 --> 11:17.440]  covering some big events three-hour transmissions covering debates but we
[11:17.440 --> 11:23.440]  haven't done a fundraiser in three years the last money bomb we did was three
[11:23.440 --> 11:27.800]  years ago it's actually one of our listeners as it was a decade ago that
[11:27.800 --> 11:32.200]  came up with the first money bomb for Ron Paul and our show got behind it
[11:32.200 --> 11:35.840]  Ron Paul didn't even know what it was and he raised something like three
[11:35.840 --> 11:39.440]  million dollars in one day then the folks that launched the Ron Paul money
[11:39.440 --> 11:46.800]  bomb said we're doing one for you and I was in a four and a half thousand
[11:46.800 --> 11:54.520]  square foot former mechanics garage that had a small TV radio studio at it and
[11:54.520 --> 11:58.920]  had a shipping department in the building across the street and there was
[11:58.920 --> 12:03.440]  about 10 people in there and I did not want to get more employees I did not
[12:03.440 --> 12:09.680]  want to make more films I did not want to work more than 14 hours a day I was I
[12:09.680 --> 12:15.000]  guess under enemy propaganda that it was bad if I made any money and it was
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.080]  bad if I expanded but I was gonna be like a priest or something up in my high
[12:20.080 --> 12:25.720]  tower writing manuscripts or something I was so so good and so pious that I
[12:25.720 --> 12:30.960]  drove an old Tahoe truck nothing wrong with that old Tahoe SUV and I lived in
[12:30.960 --> 12:37.760]  a lower middle class pretty much blue collar house and I put 99% of the money
[12:37.760 --> 12:45.560]  98% of the money that came into info wars.com back into the operation so
[12:45.560 --> 12:48.920]  this guy comes along and says well you just raised three million dollars it
[12:48.920 --> 12:52.760]  was mainly your people the fact that you plugged it for Ron Paul Ron Paul came
[12:52.760 --> 12:55.840]  on and thanked us and said yes it was mainly your listeners so they started
[12:55.840 --> 13:00.640]  their own money bombs when I'm raised seven million dollars and that was our
[13:00.640 --> 13:04.160]  listeners that did that I'm not taking the credit but then this fella comes
[13:04.160 --> 13:09.880]  along and he the guy that invented money bombs the guy that I forget his name
[13:09.880 --> 13:12.840]  gonna look it up I just tell these stories stream of consciousness didn't
[13:12.840 --> 13:16.360]  even tend to tell the story just was thinking about it so I told it he's a
[13:16.360 --> 13:20.280]  guy that launched the Ron Paul blimps around the country and of course Ron
[13:20.280 --> 13:23.720]  pulled it to save the country he didn't win the presidency but he promoted
[13:23.720 --> 13:28.600]  libertarian ideas and adjusted position of the establishment Republican party
[13:28.600 --> 13:32.560]  and the Democrats that helped launch the modern tea party which is one of our
[13:32.560 --> 13:37.560]  best hopes out there one of our last best hopes in my view that's why it's
[13:37.560 --> 13:42.040]  under universal attack so this guy starts the money bomb and I ignore it and
[13:42.040 --> 13:47.080]  thousands pledge to give to it and I ignore it about two days before people
[13:47.080 --> 13:50.240]  were saying why aren't you covering your own money bomb well I was gonna ignore it
[13:50.240 --> 13:55.360]  then the day of or the day before fifty something thousand dollars had already
[13:55.360 --> 13:59.880]  come in on this third-party money bomb so I call the guy up and I say look I'm
[13:59.880 --> 14:03.160]  not gonna really promote this you can just write me a check for whatever it is
[14:03.160 --> 14:06.840]  and I'll put it towards things but I'm really maxed out right now I want to be
[14:06.840 --> 14:11.320]  a radio talk show host and make films I can't do more I've got two small
[14:11.320 --> 14:16.520]  children three now I can't do this so I said I told you don't do the money bomb
[14:16.520 --> 14:19.960]  so I'd appreciate if you just stop promoting it and didn't make this a big
[14:19.960 --> 14:25.560]  deal because I was under such mind control at the time that I thought I was
[14:25.560 --> 14:31.680]  this wonderful pure good person because my my car would break down every few
[14:31.680 --> 14:36.720]  months and I didn't like having money I didn't like having responsibility and I
[14:36.720 --> 14:42.520]  enjoyed being humble and simple and I understand that's something we see in
[14:42.520 --> 14:46.680]  the New Testament and is one aspect of Christ I understand that but the enemy
[14:46.680 --> 14:51.360]  was always attacking me on national news saying he wants money he wants your
[14:51.360 --> 14:57.120]  money he he's into money it's all for money don't don't support him don't buy
[14:57.120 --> 15:04.320]  his videos that I gave out for free online which killed sales by the way and
[15:04.320 --> 15:07.720]  he's the guy said look gonna send you all the money and you really need it you
[15:07.720 --> 15:12.320]  know you need to expand and a half million dollars came in and I went into
[15:12.320 --> 15:15.400]  Weldon Henson who was the head of the shipping department been working for me
[15:15.400 --> 15:19.760]  three years Air Force vet great Patriot and I said well then you're a good
[15:19.760 --> 15:22.840]  confident guy you've got businesses on the side I said I don't want the
[15:22.840 --> 15:27.320]  responsibility can you go find us cheaper space to rent maybe 10,000 square
[15:27.320 --> 15:32.840]  feet and we'll just start making more films and I guess with this money I'll
[15:32.840 --> 15:36.680]  bring in other filmmakers and make other films that reach tens of millions of
[15:36.680 --> 15:39.840]  people because our films we're reaching tens of millions of people info wars
[15:39.840 --> 15:43.920]  was already a major phenomenon the reason I tell the story is understand
[15:43.920 --> 15:48.040]  where we came from then I'll get into the huge breaking news and most of this
[15:48.040 --> 15:52.880]  28-hour broadcast will not be me talking about the history of info wars or
[15:52.880 --> 15:56.160]  ourselves or even fundraising it's going to be talking about the mission of
[15:56.160 --> 16:01.760]  independent press and where we're going and Weldon found the cheapest warehouse
[16:01.760 --> 16:11.320]  but air conditioned facility in the city is still some of the best area and so
[16:11.320 --> 16:16.080]  we moved in here and then I had the responsibility to try to spend that half
[16:16.080 --> 16:21.240]  million dollars a hundred percent of it against the globalist and it bore fruit
[16:21.240 --> 16:28.680]  incredibly and out of that here we are eight years later in a 30 plus thousand
[16:28.680 --> 16:33.360]  square foot facility not reaching two or three million people a week
[16:33.360 --> 16:38.560]  conservatively but reaching 20 plus million a week and by the way they
[16:38.560 --> 16:42.120]  brought in the metrics to my house last night Buckley Hammond and Anthony
[16:42.120 --> 16:46.600]  Gucciardi that I have working with outside IT consulting firms and they
[16:46.600 --> 16:50.080]  said you're giving people two-year-old numbers here they are they pulled them up
[16:50.080 --> 16:53.720]  in front of me on all the big third-party sites and our own internal
[16:53.720 --> 16:58.920]  server systems info wars now reaches 41 million individual different people a
[16:58.920 --> 17:03.760]  month that's individual different people it has a reach of 1.4 billion total
[17:03.760 --> 17:11.200]  views on the website if you count all of our social media it is several billion
[17:11.200 --> 17:17.120]  more individual users we did a metric run with a major company and looked at our
[17:17.120 --> 17:23.400]  YouTube views just on the top 500 sites tearing our videos and it's over 150
[17:23.400 --> 17:27.960]  million views a month and so they're now collating all of that data will be
[17:27.960 --> 17:31.840]  releasing soon but it appears we're reaching upwards of three and a half
[17:31.840 --> 17:38.880]  billion individual people per month there is six billion people that have some
[17:38.880 --> 17:43.600]  access to the internet some access three and a half that have heavy access we
[17:43.600 --> 17:48.680]  look at the latest numbers it's clearly probably a billion people or so but
[17:48.680 --> 17:51.600]  they're using different phones different computers different devices we
[17:51.600 --> 17:55.960]  don't think we really have three plus billion people of the globe tuning in it
[17:55.960 --> 18:01.840]  appears to be around a billion so I don't like to get killed I don't like to
[18:01.840 --> 18:06.840]  get in fights with the globalist but they already know all this so I I don't
[18:06.840 --> 18:11.480]  want to brag about what's happened it's actually like standing on the edge of a
[18:11.480 --> 18:15.920]  600 foot cliff about to dive into the ocean if you don't dive exactly right
[18:15.920 --> 18:25.560]  you'll rip your eyeballs out and break your neck so this is our
[18:25.560 --> 18:30.480]  responsibility it's what we're doing and it's because of you the listeners and
[18:30.480 --> 18:34.400]  the viewers and our sponsors and our affiliates and your prayers and your
[18:34.400 --> 18:39.640]  support you built info wars and the people in the control room built info
[18:39.640 --> 18:43.640]  wars and the reporters the writers the customer service people the video
[18:43.640 --> 18:52.160]  editors people like Rob Jacobson built info wars people like Darren McBreen and
[18:52.160 --> 18:55.680]  Jacarie Jackson with that great intro that you just saw that we just played
[18:55.680 --> 19:00.680]  people like Jacarie Jackson built info wars your love of liberty built info
[19:00.680 --> 19:04.400]  wars and the globalists are going to demonize us and attack us all day long
[19:04.400 --> 19:10.720]  because we are effective we do scare them and on all media platforms combined
[19:10.720 --> 19:19.880]  we're reaching a month a billion people that's a big deal and quite frankly I
[19:19.880 --> 19:22.760]  look at some of our production value because we're by the seat of our pants
[19:22.760 --> 19:27.280]  we're busy we're a small crew doing too much and I get upset about it I get it's
[19:27.280 --> 19:31.480]  upset at myself but it doesn't matter because we're doing it from a pure heart
[19:31.480 --> 19:35.040]  we're doing it for the greater good we're doing it to be honorable we're
[19:35.040 --> 19:40.200]  trying to tell the truth and that's what people resonate with and when we come
[19:40.200 --> 19:44.080]  back I'm gonna tell you what we're fighting though because good people
[19:44.080 --> 19:48.000]  tend to hate ourselves good people tend to be tough on ourselves God knows I am
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.920]  and God's really laid it on my heart it's time to start loving ourselves and
[19:51.920 --> 19:56.560]  the gifts God's given us and appreciate our gifts instead of instead of beating
[19:56.560 --> 20:00.520]  ourselves over the head it's time to go after the globalist not ourselves my

[20:05.160 --> 20:09.840]  research network in the world and I paid for this airtime because I have an
[20:09.840 --> 20:14.640]  important message to the American people there's a change coming that the
[20:14.640 --> 20:20.440]  government isn't telling you about this change has deep implications for life in

[20:24.840 --> 20:30.160]  want to protect look I've made predictions like this before thing is I

[20:36.160 --> 20:43.320]  they did before that I warned that dot-com companies would crash they did
[20:43.320 --> 20:49.000]  those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing to do

[25:07.080 --> 25:12.880]  Zagami from Rome the special documentary shot in Rome with him extremely
[25:12.880 --> 25:17.440]  powerful inside the Vatican Joe Biggs, Darren McBreen with Larry Pinckney of
[25:17.440 --> 25:20.560]  the good Black Panther Party the original Black Panther Party that was not
[25:20.560 --> 25:23.920]  killed the cops and caused race war that's what the government shut them down

[25:56.440 --> 26:04.200]  hour of overdrive after that so that is what is coming up I need to get into the
[26:04.200 --> 26:09.920]  news now but coming up the start of the next segment I'll go to Jakari Jackson
[26:09.920 --> 26:13.120]  or I'll go to Darren McBree and I'll go to Rob Jacobson really talented video
[26:13.120 --> 26:18.000]  editors and they'll put together something that talk radio has done for
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.040]  decades a one minute a two minute three minute promo using interesting clips
[26:23.040 --> 26:29.720]  from the news and current events mixed in with movies and things and I started
[26:29.720 --> 26:34.840]  doing this taking clips of films like 1984 and Brazil and others and mixing it
[26:34.840 --> 26:39.480]  in with my own show or other news events and airing it on access TV 20 years ago
[26:39.480 --> 26:43.560]  and folks really liked it then it became some of the first viral videos once
[26:43.560 --> 26:47.200]  viral video was allowed to operate and there were some platforms the last 16
[26:47.200 --> 26:52.440]  17 years but we've really I think brought it to a new level here we have
[26:52.440 --> 26:57.960]  new ones every week Darren McBree has spent a few weeks off and on working on
[26:57.960 --> 27:02.720]  the one we're gonna premiere today because the matrix is one of the best
[27:02.720 --> 27:09.880]  allegories or parables or parallels in fiction to the type of world we're
[27:09.880 --> 27:16.400]  entering into literally that's where the technocracy where the THX 1138
[27:16.400 --> 27:24.240]  brave new world Philip K. Dick wirehead cyberpunk dystopia is going because it's
[27:24.240 --> 27:31.000]  a plan to take us there the globalist have a brand new God the God of false
[27:31.000 --> 27:40.600]  reality the God of synthetic death and I'll assure you studying it and peering
[27:40.600 --> 27:47.360]  into it swimming in it that it is not a good place to go and you can see the
[27:47.360 --> 27:52.440]  fruits of it all around you so there's the war between false reality and
[27:52.440 --> 27:58.440]  reality and all we're offering is the truth nothing more now to illustrate
[27:58.440 --> 28:05.640]  while why independent liberty-based naked media is so important there's an
[28:05.640 --> 28:10.680]  article on infowars.com right now now when I first learned about something
[28:10.680 --> 28:21.240]  similar to this in 2003 from a news site Al Martin raw I went to the
[28:21.240 --> 28:27.360]  Congressional funding office online wasn't biz-ops at the time was another
[28:27.360 --> 28:36.080]  one and I actually found where Marcus Wolf was paid $900,000 in one year alone
[28:36.080 --> 28:41.320]  and over several years was paid even more like 3 million to establish the
[28:41.320 --> 28:46.600]  Department of Homeland Security now again back then I thought I was hardcore
[28:46.600 --> 28:49.480]  and knew a lot but I thought that was made up I mean I had the guy on the
[28:49.480 --> 28:52.760]  show I said I don't believe it I went looked it up later it became mainstream
[28:52.760 --> 28:56.960]  ish just like I didn't believe when somebody called me and said I have a
[28:56.960 --> 29:02.000]  tape of CBS News saying mercury is good for children's brains or hey we got a
[29:02.000 --> 29:07.040]  clip out of PBS Boston where they have the inventor of the polio vaccine
[29:07.040 --> 29:10.520]  admitting they knew it was gonna kill hundreds of millions of people because
[29:10.520 --> 29:15.560]  it had SV 40 cancer virus in it and it and they laughed and said good there's
[29:15.560 --> 29:20.480]  too many people and then the tape came in the mail I used to get these calls at
[29:20.480 --> 29:24.120]  the office that I or a secretary would take I have like one person answer the
[29:24.120 --> 29:27.880]  phones and people will tell me no I haven't it would come in the mail stuff
[29:27.880 --> 29:34.760]  like that well this ex-stasi agent is hired to run Germany's censorship of
[29:34.760 --> 29:41.840]  xenophobic Facebook post we are literally battling former Stasi
[29:41.840 --> 29:47.160]  commanders there's a new one Wolf Wolf's dead this is who we have trying to
[29:47.160 --> 29:51.680]  censor our post in Germany ourselves we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:51.680 --> 29:57.600]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:00.320 --> 30:05.080]  the Miss America pageant is known for beautiful women who sometimes give
[30:05.080 --> 30:10.120]  rather amusing answers but recently Miss South Carolina turned the tide when
[30:10.120 --> 30:16.120]  she was asked about this do you support a ban on military style assault weapons
[30:16.120 --> 30:20.360]  I don't but I think it's because we need to increase education we have to go
[30:20.360 --> 30:23.880]  back there if we teach people the proper way to use the guns then we will reduce
[30:23.880 --> 30:29.840]  the risk of having gun related a gun related accident it starts with
[30:29.840 --> 30:34.440]  education even before she could finish answering her question her response
[30:34.440 --> 30:38.240]  received a massive applause demonstrating strong support for gun
[30:38.240 --> 30:42.800]  rights despite the establishment's ongoing gun demonization campaign and
[30:42.800 --> 30:47.480]  yes there have been high-profile slain with fully automatic rifles but the
[30:47.480 --> 30:51.240]  FBI's own numbers show that you're more likely to be killed by a blunt object
[30:51.240 --> 30:58.640]  such as a baseball bat or hammer you can find more reports on info wars.com

[34:01.760 --> 34:04.400]  need to kill
[34:08.040 --> 34:15.680]  the matrix is a system neo that system is our enemy when you're inside look
[34:15.680 --> 34:21.400]  around what do you see businessmen teachers lawyers carpenters the varying
[34:21.400 --> 34:25.520]  minds of the people we are trying to save but until we do these people are
[34:25.520 --> 34:30.160]  still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy have to understand
[34:30.160 --> 34:35.240]  most of these people are not ready to be unplugged and many of them are so
[34:35.240 --> 34:40.240]  inert so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect
[34:40.240 --> 34:45.560]  it we are trained to deceive if we have to you shouldn't trust me I will take
[34:45.560 --> 34:50.400]  the net our propaganda was beginning to pay off and our Lord save you for rock
[34:50.400 --> 34:53.720]  over
[34:53.720 --> 34:58.880]  genetically modified sounds great and stymish drop resistance sounds really
[34:58.880 --> 35:06.920]  something I am not a dictator I'm the president this is a full dishonorable
[35:06.920 --> 35:13.840]  scientific mafia warfare take down public policy could itself become the
[35:13.840 --> 35:18.760]  captain of a scientific technological elite these people are coming for
[35:18.760 --> 35:22.760]  everybody I'm not gonna wait around to be soft killed I don't wait around to
[35:22.760 --> 35:27.920]  watch my family die around me I'm gonna die fighting take the blue pill the
[35:27.920 --> 35:33.160]  story ends you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe you
[35:33.160 --> 35:39.040]  take the red pill you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole
[35:39.040 --> 35:50.880]  goes the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[35:50.880 --> 35:56.740]  stop being a moron stop being dishonorable within 15 years they say
[35:56.740 --> 36:03.640]  CNN that everyone will be merged with machines or will be obsolete I'm not gonna
[36:03.640 --> 36:13.680]  sit here and take it anymore welcome to the real world
[36:14.320 --> 36:19.720]  ladies and gentlemen the technocrats admit that they are using human
[36:19.720 --> 36:24.440]  technology and our system to build a world designed to destroy what's left
[36:24.440 --> 36:30.240]  of humans designed to make us obsolete the statements I just made are repeats
[36:30.240 --> 36:35.440]  of every major computer company expert that's spoken out all the major
[36:35.440 --> 36:41.480]  billionaires metaphysically have a law they must follow to tell you what
[36:41.480 --> 36:46.920]  they're going to do to you before they do it to you and that's the word that's
[36:46.920 --> 36:51.800]  trickle down why I'm even tolerated is that it's believed that you're so
[36:51.800 --> 36:57.320]  unconscious and so stupid that you're not going to listen to what we're saying
[36:57.320 --> 37:03.280]  so it won't matter well all I know is my heart my gut my soul my intellect my
[37:03.280 --> 37:09.480]  will and I know your will as well will not sit here and go quietly into this
[37:09.480 --> 37:16.000]  modern soul-sucking system whether it was built by men or entities from the
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.720]  center of a black hole we can debate that all day long but where this
[37:20.720 --> 37:27.520]  fantastical world is hurtling is a very very nasty place and there are seven
[37:27.520 --> 37:31.880]  and a half billion people on this club who know there's a problem who know the
[37:31.880 --> 37:36.200]  planet's being killed who are seeking after the truth who know that the
[37:36.200 --> 37:40.280]  danger is increasing in their gut but also intellectually and they are
[37:40.280 --> 37:44.760]  seeking always seeking to try to warn others but trying to also inform
[37:44.760 --> 37:51.280]  themselves I want to get into the rest of the news and some more key information
[37:51.280 --> 37:54.600]  but I want to go back to what I talked about before the break because we're all
[37:54.600 --> 37:59.320]  dumb as dirt to some extent we're all in denial we're all ignorant it's a
[37:59.320 --> 38:03.680]  learning process and the more you learn the more you don't know you see the
[38:03.680 --> 38:09.400]  confidence of the dumb down masses who have no culture no ritual no history no
[38:09.400 --> 38:13.680]  future they've been destroyed they've been turned into mindless vessels that
[38:13.680 --> 38:18.320]  imprint on whatever the latest propaganda is they don't even know how
[38:18.320 --> 38:26.880]  shocking it is to learn 13 14 years ago that Marcus Wolf the former head of the
[38:26.880 --> 38:32.440]  infamous Stasi the most oppressive all-encompassing police state the world
[38:32.440 --> 38:40.320]  had ever seen had been hired to found the Department of Homeland Security and
[38:40.320 --> 38:46.200]  there it was in the congressional record there was the funding and he was
[38:46.200 --> 38:50.560]  hired for the next four or five years till he died and they hired other top
[38:50.560 --> 39:00.120]  Stasi and other former KGB and NKVD of the Soviet Union to come here that's why
[39:00.120 --> 39:05.840]  it looks just like that because that's what it is and then I get up and I
[39:05.840 --> 39:09.360]  read Paul Joseph Watson's article that links directly to major German
[39:09.360 --> 39:13.440]  newspapers that report on this like they're talking about something good oh
[39:13.440 --> 39:17.880]  thank gosh we're fighting the racism of people that don't want totally open
[39:17.880 --> 39:24.000]  borders with the Middle East and North Africa they've got this woman here that
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.760]  looks like a joke out of a Nazi movie you know some weird control freak woman
[39:27.760 --> 39:36.680]  in her uniform sitting there in her power-tripping you know repose
[39:36.680 --> 39:42.400]  ecstasy agent hired to censor xenophobic Facebook post German government
[39:42.400 --> 39:50.680]  cracks down dissent against migrant flux how about illegal hordes the German
[39:50.680 --> 39:53.680]  government and Facebook are working with an organization led by the ecstasy
[39:53.680 --> 39:58.120]  agent to oversee a new program that will identify xenophobic post while the
[39:58.120 --> 40:06.080]  social network website has pushed and punished people who make them with
[40:06.080 --> 40:11.600]  fines and jail sentences so if you make a comment against open borders that's
[40:11.600 --> 40:17.240]  judges racist that you don't want to pay for somebody who openly says they
[40:17.240 --> 40:22.760]  don't like your culture and so now you're gonna be fined and jail sentences
[40:22.760 --> 40:27.480]  and this is really happening I mean we link to the mainstream German articles
[40:27.480 --> 40:31.080]  that report on this like it's good sweeten's really making people how's
[40:31.080 --> 40:35.640]  illegals they're really telling women don't wear short many skirts it angers
[40:35.640 --> 40:39.120]  the radical Muslims this is really happening look at the latest headlines
[40:39.120 --> 40:44.960]  up on drugs today they're also on in force all hell breaks loose on hungry
[40:44.960 --> 40:51.000]  border tear gas water cannon rioting refugees pelt police with giant rocks
[40:51.000 --> 40:59.640]  a la Akbar roar migrants overrun police at border crossing we're actually seeing
[40:59.640 --> 41:06.920]  the collapse not just financially but culturally right now as Europe prepares
[41:06.920 --> 41:12.680]  to collapse under the EU into a new EU super state where there's no rights no
[41:12.680 --> 41:18.480]  freedoms and no sovereignty in their own words create the crisis offer the
[41:18.480 --> 41:28.440]  solution they'll let as I said years ago and months ago enough people that won't
[41:28.440 --> 41:33.320]  assimilate into the West put them under socialist indoctrination and welfare
[41:33.320 --> 41:37.520]  but they'll bring in enough to checkmate any political move against the
[41:37.520 --> 41:43.080]  globalist then they're going to totally seal the borders and use that as a
[41:43.080 --> 41:49.200]  police state to keep you from ever getting out you'll demand a police state
[41:49.200 --> 41:53.640]  to protect you and the interim they will and the average copper military person
[41:53.640 --> 41:58.040]  is facing incredible odds and is a good person but if you look at the entire
[41:58.040 --> 42:02.240]  engineering in the paradigm it is the end of Europe the fall of freedom the
[42:02.240 --> 42:10.480]  fall of the Renaissance and now into the void comes the Stasi the German
[42:10.480 --> 42:17.280]  Minister of Justice Hiko Maas met with Facebook this week to form a special
[42:17.280 --> 42:21.240]  task force that will work to remove comments from the website that call for
[42:21.240 --> 42:25.720]  hatred against migrants see by criticizing and saying we shouldn't have
[42:25.720 --> 42:29.560]  to pay for them that calls for hatred the organization will be overseen by
[42:29.560 --> 42:37.560]  network against Nazis oh isn't that nice Nets Gigan Nazis a group led by
[42:37.560 --> 42:46.640]  left-wing activists Anita how do you pronounce that k-a-h-a-n-e Anita Cahane
[42:46.800 --> 42:53.040]  Cahane that sounds Scottish or Irish doesn't sound German although Cahane now
[42:53.040 --> 42:58.600]  describes herself as an anti-racist aren't they all she wasn't the same
[42:58.600 --> 43:02.160]  thing for sorrow stuff she was intimately involved in another dark
[43:02.160 --> 43:05.480]  period of German history working as a Stasi informant under the code name
[43:05.480 --> 43:18.280]  Victoria during her most oppressive era 1974 to 1982 the Stasi which liaised with
[43:18.280 --> 43:22.440]  the Soviet KGB was the official secret police of the former communist government
[43:22.440 --> 43:26.520]  of East Germany its role was to spy on the population and use it vast network
[43:26.520 --> 43:29.720]  of informants to hunt down political dissidents numerous Stasi members were
[43:29.720 --> 43:34.680]  prosecuted for their crimes of the fall the Berlin Wall 89 last week Chancellor
[43:34.680 --> 43:39.200]  Angela Merkel whose father and mother were in the Stasi total communist look
[43:39.200 --> 43:44.920]  it up that will actually commanded them I'm sorry they were above them vowed to
[43:44.920 --> 43:48.400]  tackle racist comments made on social media sites yeah they've banned
[43:48.400 --> 43:52.160]  demonstrations describing them as sedition it's sedition and I want your
[43:52.160 --> 43:57.280]  country destroyed and demanding that Facebook take action 25 years of

[44:02.000 --> 44:07.240]  and sisters are to be monitored by former Stasi cadres notes the German website
[44:07.240 --> 44:13.280]  PI news a report in build also confirms the network against Nazis led by this
[44:13.280 --> 44:17.760]  woman was involved in monitoring Facebook for racist unified comments as well as
[44:17.760 --> 44:22.160]  refugee baiting remarks those found guilty will be hit with fines of around
[44:22.160 --> 44:31.480]  5,000 euros and 120 days in prison this is in mainstream news they're not playing
[44:31.480 --> 44:35.320]  games this is EU wide folks we were in Spain they came over and erased our
[44:35.320 --> 44:39.280]  footage took our cameras threatened to put us in jail we weren't even trying to
[44:39.280 --> 44:42.640]  film the police but but it was on the news that you couldn't do it
[44:42.640 --> 44:48.120]  criticism of government anyway you're arrested it's on
[44:51.840 --> 44:57.040]  man you got to read the rest of it it's up on info wars.com this story needs to
[44:57.040 --> 45:01.960]  go viral they can't arrest us yet in the United States so they're trying to pass
[45:01.960 --> 45:07.960]  laws that's why it's more important than ever before Europe fell I had to get
[45:07.960 --> 45:12.000]  over there I may go back to document what's happening in Germany see I told
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.720]  you they start with saying if you deny the Holocaust or if you say 5,999,000
[45:16.720 --> 45:21.280]  people died they will put you in prison for life over there even if you're a
[45:21.280 --> 45:27.200]  US citizen they grab you or a Canadian citizen and whereas I don't like the
[45:27.200 --> 45:31.320]  Nazis either that's just one group bad group for another the Nazis aren't in
[45:31.320 --> 45:35.280]  control the socialists the communists working for people like George Soros and
[45:35.280 --> 45:39.120]  the big above-the-law banks are and they want the precedent to arrest remember
[45:39.120 --> 45:43.480]  they want so it sounds reasonable oh let's find somebody that says Hitler was
[45:43.480 --> 45:49.000]  great no you take somebody's free speech away next it's you can't preach the
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.080]  gospel that's now happened you can't criticize the open borders that's now
[45:53.080 --> 45:58.840]  happened you're gonna have former Stasi over you whether you're in Spain or
[45:58.840 --> 46:02.720]  whether you're in Germany and notice it's Germany and Spain more than anybody
[46:02.720 --> 46:09.280]  directing the police state again in Europe the EU was the project of the
[46:09.280 --> 46:14.800]  Nazis I'm not saying it's a Nazi conspiracy they simply took over what
[46:14.800 --> 46:18.440]  the Germans tried to set up under the Nazis and are now running the same
[46:18.440 --> 46:25.720]  playbook but pushing it as politically correct that's just some of what's
[46:25.720 --> 46:30.880]  coming up there's so much more but it is earth shaking to see this that's why
[46:30.880 --> 46:37.800]  we need to be on satellite over the United States which we now are go to
[46:37.800 --> 46:42.760]  info wars.com forward slash affiliates to see all the details but info wars.com
[46:42.760 --> 46:51.720]  forward slash money bum to see all the details go to info wars.com or we just
[46:51.720 --> 46:58.080]  posted a red link info wars live feed 28 hours special broadcast and send that
[46:58.080 --> 47:02.200]  link on Facebook and Twitter everywhere else you can out now the way this works
[47:02.200 --> 47:06.640]  is we've had Facebook and Twitter censor us a lot for criticizing Benghazi
[47:06.640 --> 47:12.760]  response for putting Obama up there and saying the word crook undring and we've
[47:12.760 --> 47:17.080]  protested and pointed out it's not a violation of even their quote policies
[47:17.080 --> 47:22.000]  that they are engaged in serious Soviet style censorship and Facebook has been
[47:22.000 --> 47:32.040]  forced to back off so the answer is use these platforms to keep them free and
[47:32.040 --> 47:36.520]  to point out that these movements by Europe demanding Twitter Facebook and
[47:36.520 --> 47:42.120]  Google censor things is an attempt for an EU tyranny to come into place they
[47:42.120 --> 47:48.840]  can get away with virtually anything they want and understand that when you

[49:22.600 --> 49:28.240]  to consciously realize the huge effect that you've been have having it's it's
[49:28.240 --> 49:34.080]  massive and I understand the responsibility that I have to tell the
[49:34.080 --> 49:38.920]  truth to fight harder to be as eloquent as I can to get the best guest on we can
[49:38.920 --> 49:44.520]  to reach out to you as best I can to fire you up to take action so that we go
[49:44.520 --> 49:51.400]  in as hard and as fast and as focused and as truthful as our frail imperfect
[49:51.400 --> 49:55.480]  human bodies and souls can do we're gonna skip this network break only this
[49:55.480 --> 50:01.400]  one but that's what this comes down to this is a huge historical time to be
[50:01.400 --> 50:06.520]  alive we are seeing the manifestation of classical oppression classical
[50:06.520 --> 50:11.440]  totalitarianism classical police state surveillance that the world has never
[50:11.440 --> 50:20.120]  seen Europe is going pure tyranny the US is falling into staggering corruption but
[50:20.120 --> 50:24.320]  the good news is the polls show the people have never been more awake the
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.160]  evidence shows people want to do something about it but they need a media
[50:28.160 --> 50:32.040]  outlet they need a place to come together they need more outlets and more
[50:32.040 --> 50:36.240]  venues so that they can understand that they're not alone and so that their
[50:36.240 --> 50:41.440]  tips of their videos their comments their information can be seen and heard and
[50:41.440 --> 50:46.200]  not censored and then given on and passed on to others and out of this
[50:46.200 --> 50:51.240]  giant spectrum of wonderful organizations and great media operations and
[50:51.240 --> 50:56.960]  beautiful souls across the world fighting the scientific takeover that is
[50:56.960 --> 51:02.480]  corporate fascism globalism masquerading as grassroots communism
[51:02.480 --> 51:09.840]  info wars stands out at the very top now quite frankly I would hit my knees
[51:09.840 --> 51:15.280]  enjoy and cry my eyes out if some organization rose up more eloquent more
[51:15.280 --> 51:22.880]  focused more dynamic more serious more committed it has not happened and so I
[51:22.880 --> 51:28.320]  must give my full energy my soul I'm exhausted sometimes and I have to dig
[51:28.320 --> 51:35.160]  deep and actually pour out my my very essence to do this that's what you need

[52:20.240 --> 52:24.760]  going to lose everything the globalist want to bring in a tyranny because they
[52:24.760 --> 52:30.840]  plan to oppress the people the globalist want to bring in a tyranny
[52:30.840 --> 52:39.000]  because they know you're going to use the legitimate means of media to come
[52:39.000 --> 52:44.920]  after everyone they're they want to get rid of legitimate media so we can't
[52:44.920 --> 52:51.040]  fight back they want to come in and be able to shut down whoever they want and
[52:51.040 --> 52:56.680]  do it in the dark or no one is aware of it it's already happening in Spain it's
[52:56.680 --> 53:00.360]  happening in Germany it's happening in Greece it's happening in the UK it's
[53:00.360 --> 53:05.080]  starting to happen here they meanwhile fire up the left to go out and start
[53:05.080 --> 53:08.840]  killing police to get them to become even more militarized so they can be
[53:08.840 --> 53:15.360]  misdirected against the Patriots the takeover is here it's happening everyone
[53:15.360 --> 53:21.520]  can feel it everyone can see it and so many people get caught in a trick they
[53:21.520 --> 53:25.400]  think just keep your head down stay out of it and you'll be all right or better
[53:25.400 --> 53:31.200]  yet join with a new world order in your gut you know that means destruction of
[53:31.200 --> 53:36.300]  your very will and enslavement and it puts your soul in peril which you do
[53:36.300 --> 53:42.200]  have one but more importantly to people that don't care about things that
[53:42.200 --> 53:48.640]  really matter it puts this temporal world and prosperity on the chopping block
[53:48.640 --> 53:52.120]  because under the globalist own statements they're ending the age of
[53:52.120 --> 53:55.360]  prosperity they're ending the renaissance they're ending private
[53:55.360 --> 54:01.080]  property for the average person they're ending individual free will they are
[54:01.080 --> 54:11.720]  bringing in an absolutely destructive system on so many fronts the fruits of
[54:11.720 --> 54:20.880]  the new world order are bondage are sad or pathetic are starving children it's
[54:20.880 --> 54:25.960]  ignorance and everything it holds out enlightenment empowerment saving the
[54:25.960 --> 54:31.160]  earth everything they say they want to do it's the opposite they're coming for
[54:31.160 --> 54:34.200]  our families they're coming for our children they're coming for the unborn
[54:34.200 --> 54:40.520]  they're coming for everything they want total complete micromanagement and
[54:40.520 --> 54:45.080]  domination that the computer allows them through their minions to carry out and
[54:45.080 --> 54:48.960]  they want total compliance but to get that first they've got to bring you to
[54:48.960 --> 54:55.560]  your knees but bringing seven and a half billion people of their knees is hard and
[54:55.560 --> 55:00.000]  if the people know that it's premeditated in a plan there's nothing it
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.480]  can do that's why as they brazenly advertise free welfare and as they
[55:05.480 --> 55:09.040]  brazenly bring down the Middle East and have their proxy armies flush out these
[55:09.040 --> 55:13.560]  populations they bring them in with leftist social workers to fill them
[55:13.560 --> 55:18.440]  full of Western hate against the West and to bring them in as the new
[55:18.440 --> 55:24.000]  destabilization force to fully complete Europe's enslavement as we are being
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.080]  fully enslaved by the Latin American invasion and the European and the
[55:28.080 --> 55:34.400]  Chinese and the rest of the world checkmate against this country you are
[55:34.400 --> 55:39.840]  seeing 21st century warfare you're seeing world war three right now being
[55:39.840 --> 55:44.240]  conducted by the big five mega banks and the insurance companies and the
[55:44.240 --> 55:47.920]  propaganda firms and the systems and it's a war against every sovereign
[55:47.920 --> 55:52.000]  country it's a war against individuals it's a war against the very militaries
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.480]  and police that are being used up in the struggle against their own populations
[55:56.480 --> 56:03.600]  it is a premeditated ordered out of chaos program we are seeing just
[56:03.600 --> 56:07.240]  incredible times how could you watch history channel now read a history book
[56:07.240 --> 56:11.720]  when you're watching the most fantastical history ever thousands of
[56:11.720 --> 56:16.560]  cross species with humans spliced with every animal you can imagine humans
[56:16.560 --> 56:23.160]  implanted for 20 years inside cows and pigs every form of genetic Chimera
[56:23.160 --> 56:27.760]  blaspheme open-air crops by the thousands creating all sorts of new
[56:27.760 --> 56:32.680]  illnesses and allergies mega cancers rising diabetes off the chart

[56:40.520 --> 56:46.240]  in 58 with autism you can really see the soft kill plan of the eugenicist
[56:46.240 --> 56:51.800]  developed by British intelligence deployed by Hitler on a low level now
[56:51.800 --> 56:57.760]  being operated out of the open and you see the will of Satan the will of hell

[57:07.960 --> 57:11.040]  gonna stand by while your neighbor dies of cancer and just raise money for them
[57:11.040 --> 57:16.120]  but not try to find out why cancer is exploding you know what I'm gonna do God
[57:16.120 --> 57:22.400]  says I'm gonna remove my protection from you I'm gonna let what you now desire

[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.760]  have a very popular guest who hadn't been on for about eight months he's been
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:52.640]  writing another best-selling book James Wesley Rawls who was for an hour and a
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.320]  half interspersed with news on the designed worldwide collapse that's
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.600]  being engineered and I love some of our critics they'll say well if you think it
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.120]  collapses in a minute what are you doing trying to run your operation well
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.400]  that's why we're doing a money bomb if the collapse really is as bad as
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.160]  something it may be I hope it isn't I'm very clear about what I've said straw
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.080]  men say different things that is an Alan Jones it's like must have been 10
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:25.080]  different publications I saw your show not even looking you know Alex Jones
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:29.240]  discredited he said there would be martial law by September 15th and they
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:34.240]  would be taking all the guns in Texas they don't show where I said it and they
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.160]  lie and said that Rick Perry said it Rick Perry criticized me they show a bunch
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.680]  other Republicans that never even said any of that stuff it's lying but I don't
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.280]  care go ahead and lie all you want you've got people dumb enough to be your
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:53.280]  constituent readers that I just feel sorry for but it's the fact that even of
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.320]  Jade Helm was something nefarious exposing and speaking out against it
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:06.280]  made them back off of it but I never said I thought that's what it was I said
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:13.320]  it was the engineered build-up to condition us for occupation in this country
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.560]  and now you see all these top financial experts of others saying it couldn't be a
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.520]  total collapse the bubble can't go on forever but if you deflated it's gonna
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.960]  implode we're in big trouble if we do in the bubble we're in big trouble if we
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:32.880]  don't and I'm just up here saying wow we're sitting on top 2.2 quadrillion and
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:37.840]  fake derivatives counterfeit garbage that every major government signed on to
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:43.920]  I don't know when this mountains this volcano is gonna go off but smoke and
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.960]  lava is already coming out of it and half the world's already in turmoil and
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:53.320]  flames right now fact more than half the world so I really think the collapse is
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:59.000]  already begun and I want to try to stop it but they've got publications out
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.680]  today saying we're fear mongers and you know we say that there's gonna be a
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:08.080]  total collapse now I don't think it's a total collapse it's the beginning of the
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.480]  new dark age the new austerity that the new world order is engineering to bring
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:19.160]  in their total power and that's what it comes down to so you bet now's the time
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:23.440]  to expand the audience bigger than ever because now's the time for the message
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.600]  now's the time for the responsibility now's the time to pray
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:34.840]  because I never get scared when I'm awake during the day I always start
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:39.600]  crying I think about this because I don't want to leave my kids alone now more
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.520]  than ever that my children need me now more than ever I'm pretty much the only
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.920]  people there for them and I know in my heart that as all this unfolds this
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.360]  show is gonna get bigger and more popular to a dangerous level because we
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.480]  know what's going on and I've been told by top globalist that I'll be just fine
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:02.400]  until all this comes true and then that's when I better stop and the
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.400]  criticism is what do you want money for if you're ready to stop I'm not gonna
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.840]  stop during the collapse I'm gonna go to the next level and put everything on
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:13.160]  the table and be all in that's what you do when the enemy comes in like a
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:18.160]  flood this is the end of the West the end of humanity as we know it this is a
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.520]  total satanic takeover don't you understand it's real it's not a game
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:27.480]  they've captured our churches they run everything basically they're putting drugs
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:34.880]  in the water people and I'm not trying to scare you this is the truth and yes
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.600]  we need to raise a bunch of money info wars.com forward slash money bomb
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.880]  because we don't need to just have this much money to run things we need to have

[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:07.920]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:15.560]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network that liner you just
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:21.600]  heard was updated about five years ago but it's the same liner I wrote 20 years
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:28.920]  ago for my local radio show and then it was a little bit tongue-in-cheek from a
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.720]  central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines because the program
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.120]  director was kind of a libertarian patriot but he still made some jokes
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:41.480]  about how extreme my show was and he said you ought to have an intro or deep
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:45.880]  behind enemy lines from your bunker you know kind of the cliche you conspiracy
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:49.360]  guys and it'll kind of put people on that mindset and I said well you know we
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:54.360]  really are under the Federal Reserve we really are under FEMA region 6 here in
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:58.480]  Texas and he was an old veteran guy and he goes I know you're right I know we're
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.400]  under it but the point is the people don't know that and they kind of want
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:06.120]  to laugh at you so I think if you you know want a bigger audience you ought to
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:10.160]  you know go along with it I said okay I'll do the liner you want so see how
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:16.480]  that liner was written by somebody else 20 years ago as a joke but five years
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.840]  ago when we had it updated the original guy that of the voiceovers died by
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:26.120]  someone similar voice wasn't a joke anymore was it I live and captured
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.080]  FEMA region 6 they haven't captured all our minds yet they haven't captured all
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.200]  our power plants yet they haven't taken all our farms yet but they they're
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.640]  doing it now they're announcing it our kids belong to them our fire stoves
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.600]  wood stoves belong to them they're now announcing no more single parent
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.040]  families homes to be built in major cities across America and people are
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.280]  tuning in and going wow you made a film 15 years ago another one eight years ago
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:58.480]  saying that how would you know well it's in a jenna 21 the worldwide treaty just
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.080]  like taking half the roads off limits and making them for driverless cars is in
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:10.080]  the treaty and now LA just announced it they also just announced that they are
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:19.040]  officially the capital of the southern central and north America the capital of
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:25.280]  Latin America that's the globalist Balkanization I saw that 18 19 years ago
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.200]  in globalist publications and what they put in globalist publications like
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:34.840]  Club of Rome CFR they do now they're a few years behind in their program but
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:40.400]  now they're accelerating and that's why we haven't done a fundraiser in three
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.680]  years it's because I've really tried with products and sponsors to pay for
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:47.880]  everything but because it looks like the implosion is getting worse because the
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:51.560]  economy is going down because even though our audience has roughly doubled
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:58.520]  the last year it's never grown that fast I can look into the future and it'll be
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.800]  hard for me to pay for the satellite the closed captioning and the crew we
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:08.840]  have if we don't raise a million dollars for the next year on top of the 10
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.520]  million plus dollars I have to raise to run this and if you don't know about
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:16.600]  media that's cheap folks a small town you know newspaper for a hundred thousand
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:22.760]  people cost 10 million dollars to run or more it just the licensing of the the
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.680]  servers the everything and we do it cheap in Texas I've been told by top
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:31.240]  consultants what we run would cost 50 million dollars in New York not 10
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:36.240]  million not 15 million what what we run would cost probably more in LA because
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:40.520]  the unions we reach I'm gonna go over these numbers and we're gonna be putting
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.280]  a video out in the next few days showing this from all the big demographic

[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:08.600]  the biggest most successful platforms in history against tyranny because we're
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.040]  willing to do it I don't like that position I don't like saying that it's
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:19.760]  very dangerous and I've been told hey you've gone far enough you just need to
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:24.480]  do the right thing now and need to idle off you need to back off need to play
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.960]  ball I'm not playing ball anybody I never have because I can see my soul
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:34.520]  forfeit the minute I do and that's not hocus pocus that's not me even being
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:39.280]  religious it's just in my gut I can't be part of not fighting this tyranny and
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.480]  not speaking out against it I don't see that as heroic I see it as my mission but
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:45.960]  we're entering a very dangerous phase right now people need to get ready they
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:50.000]  need to offensively speak out they'll seem defensively get ready because you

[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:53.640]  I'm not gonna say where he works he told me I could but I'm not even going to but
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.400]  James Wesley Rawls has been an enthusiastic survivalist since his

[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.440]  series book that's coming out in just about a month and a half and I remember
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.000]  he was on with this about eight nine months ago and talked about the plan to
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.160]  flood the West and other serious issues I'm gonna go ahead today and just keep
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.280]  skipping breaks here this is an important broadcast I don't want to cut his
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:59.920]  time short with a break coming up here in a moment survival blog.com but I know
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.360]  James ten years ago you let your face be seen in public now you don't even come
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.600]  on with people via Skype you don't even want your photo out there because you
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.320]  know how imminent this is we've been trying as you know in an offensive
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:16.040]  defensive posture both to stop the takeover we've been holding it back
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.360]  slowing it down the elite have now gone ahead and dropped the hammer
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.200]  regardless so it's a it's a paradox people now no world government's real
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:27.800]  the Pope's calling for it Europe's being destroyed free speeches being banned
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.440]  they're announcing our children don't belong to us every form of evil is now
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.200]  out in the open we know they're selling babies killing them keeping them alive
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.640]  and harvesting them we now know everything the Patriots warned us of is
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.240]  true so we've now reached that paradox moment where the enemies emerge which
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:48.360]  means they're going into full full takeover mode it is what I believe I
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:53.280]  want to get the time frame to you where what you think the battle space is how
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:57.040]  well our people that love life doing we're just people that don't want to
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:02.600]  kill everybody how well the forces of non-insanity doing and have we not
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:06.840]  reach one of the most epic moments in history as all the forces are lining up
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:11.800]  all the stars are aligning politically and everyone can just feel that that
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:16.520]  deep breath before the armies collide into each other is that an accurate
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:23.440]  assessment James Wesley Rawls you're right Alex things are definitely coming
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:29.440]  to a head the the folks who are pushing the New World Order have definitely
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:34.360]  taken the gloves off and they they've also kind of let their guard down it
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:41.120]  they've let their full agenda be seen by so many people in so many different
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:46.840]  ways that is now abundantly clear exactly what they have planned and they
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:51.960]  are no longer being secretive and conspiratorial about it a lot of what
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:57.680]  they're doing is now out in the open and they're again not pulling any punches
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:03.680]  there they are pushing as hard and as fast as they can to institute one world
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:12.320]  government in our lifetimes and I think that the patriot movement the
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:20.240]  libertarian movements and just the freedom movement in general has caught
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:26.680]  on people are waking up people are getting actively involved politically
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:30.800]  people are getting involved out on the street with their cell phones with their
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:36.240]  smartphones taking video of some of the tyranny that's coming down around us and
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:42.920]  people are getting actively involved a good part of that ties into family
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:48.440]  preparedness there a lot of people are stocking up and teaming up and training
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:54.200]  up because they can see what's what's coming in the very near future the
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.440]  enemy loves to say all day where's the tyranny where's the world government
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.840]  where's the bands on speech where are they coming for the guns even as it was
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:09.480]  happening they would sit there and deny it but now they're just doing it out in
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:15.520]  the open but still denying they're doing it and it's discrediting them what is
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:23.280]  the modus operandi there well I think their level of fear of retribution
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:28.280]  whether it be a political or otherwise has dropped a bit they're just feeling
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:33.240]  very brazen very self-confident that they can get away with this they've seen
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:37.240]  that they've pushed and pushed and pushed and the americ people really
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:46.640]  haven't pushed back and because of that they become brazen and along with that
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:51.640]  brazenness comes a puffed up self-confidence that I think will be
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:57.240]  part of their downfall well I've been asking some of the questions here and
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.560]  I've got more but get into what you see is front and center right now obviously
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:08.000]  they're imploding the borders a big plank of globalism in our face definitely
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:17.400]  yes the the whole globalist agenda is getting played out in prime time right
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:25.560]  now the the dissolution of America's borders with NAFTA with GATT with the
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:34.520]  international trucking agreement and so on are blatant the you know the
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:41.400]  conservative or so-called conservative politicians even coming from the tea
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:47.880]  party side have caved in and are now saying oh we can't erect a border fence
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:55.560]  that will prohibitively expense them in practical or whatever the our nation's
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:00.600]  borders are incredibly porous we're in the very near future going to find out
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.480]  just how porous they are when a weapon of mass destruction comes across our
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:14.080]  border and is used domestically and we're at a at a juncture now where the
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:18.920]  very sovereignty of the nation itself is at stake I'm not just talking about a
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:23.920]  demographic demographic shift here I'm talking about the very sovereignty of
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:32.520]  our nation is in peril it things are that bad and they're crowing from the
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:37.760]  rooftops LA now the capital of Latin America officially from the city they
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:42.280]  are openly having George Soros and the Winehouse Fund kill the cop movements
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:46.600]  what's the strategy there we notice Europe's imploding its borders we're
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.920]  imploding the borders it's all the same tactics the globalists are moving on
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:55.600]  every front is this just the beginning of the major offensive or is this a
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:01.160]  vanguard that you expected to ratchet up even more I think it could ratchet up
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:09.160]  more I'm not sure what their exact time frame or or timetable is but they
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:20.680]  certainly could through manipulation orchestrate a a lot more attacks on
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:25.360]  police officers and highway patrolmen for example without too much
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:32.560]  difficulty we have a society really when you come right down to it that is
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.720]  based on a government that trusts the people and we've built our our
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:45.720]  infrastructure accordingly it's not like European nations where the the whole
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:52.440]  underlying precept is that the government doesn't trust the people our
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:58.400]  nation was built on the precept that that which our own government is of and
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:03.640]  buying for the people and the people were to be trusted and because of that we
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:08.640]  built such a free and open society that it's created unfortunately some
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.800]  vulnerabilities which I think will be exploited and those vulnerabilities will
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:19.040]  be used as an excuse for greater and greater control so for example for many
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:25.320]  many years in our nation we've enjoyed the freedom to travel and I think that
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:30.840]  could very well be taken away from us it's a lot of it's already gone if you
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:35.200]  look at things like the border patrol checkpoints for example and even
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:41.440]  agricultural checkpoints we no longer have full freedom to travel but could
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.560]  you imagine a society where you essentially have to file a flight
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:51.520]  plan just to take a cross-country road trip we very well could be in that
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:57.000]  situation soon or we could be in a situation where it's not up to us at
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  all but our own cars will be spying on us and reporting our movements to Big
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.840]  Brother with transponders that were put into the cars for the
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.480]  purposes of collecting tolls on individual toll roads or bridges but now
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:19.240]  those transponders would be used to track our every movement which we now
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:24.400]  learn they've been doing for 20 years since day one premeditatedly and you
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:28.200]  can see the White House and Soros funding this kill-the-cop movement that's
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.760]  expanding all over the country in an attempt to destabilize the country and
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:36.320]  bring in a police state I have seen that wake up a lot of police and military but
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:40.760]  it's a paradox they're awake but they still follow orders the citizens are
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:46.200]  awake we still put up with it meanwhile leftist are out killing police so
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:50.800]  they're so fired up once we demonstrate they'll attack us I wish there was some
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:56.240]  sophistication out there that everyone not be played like fiddles right well
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:03.480]  right now we have a lot of people being played like puppets indeed where radicals
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:10.960]  are being pushed toward killing police officers for example where you know
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:17.320]  there wasn't even talk of that for about a 25 period in this country you have to
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:21.280]  go all the way back to late 1960s or early 70s with the Black Panther movement
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.600]  to see you know they at the time they referred to it as the kill the pigs
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:34.320]  movement that kind of went quiet for a long long time in this nation and seeing
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:39.240]  that reemerge is very troubling because that could be used as a pretext for a
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:46.720]  huge number of draconian which controls on on public meetings on the freedom of
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:55.120]  assembly freedom of travel you name it that if if the if this situation gets
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:00.120]  out of control and large numbers of police officers start being killed by
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:07.080]  radicals that could again be used as the pretext for just out now tyranny in
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.880]  this nation I agree and what's crazy James Wesley I think a lot of people would
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:15.440]  go along with it exactly is that they're nakedly doing I use that word naked a
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:21.280]  lot they're so out in the open they're so obviously evil and then you add to it
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:26.120]  don't use the name boy or girl he or she in school it's hateful body parts
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:31.480]  selling of babies open world government I mean this is crazy how evil these
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:34.400]  people are from your research we want to break in a minute and a half but from
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:38.160]  your research who runs the new world order who are the different power blocks
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:42.440]  and what's their end game well that's a huge question for a minute and a half
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.480]  Alex but we can come back and finish it too you know it's one of those meet the
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:53.480]  the new boss same as the old boss situations it's the same international
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:29:01.520]  banking cartels that have existed since the 19th century and earlier we have
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:09.680]  international banking influence we have the all the power structures that go
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.800]  along with that we have the we have interpol their own policing organization
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.720]  that goes along with it that's in it that's co-opted our own police
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:23.360]  departments and our own and our own federal law enforcement when you come
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:30.240]  right down to it the same folks that are trying to enslave us are they will stay
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.960]  there answer when we come back give us this centuries ago treasure stay there

[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:44.800]  broke up James Losey Rawls is our guest survival blog.com I'm Alex Jones it's
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:52.040]  the 28 hour 2015 operation money bomb we're on the March the Empire's on the
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:58.000]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:05.360]  Kid Daniels info wars.com President Obama has ordered the federal government to
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.640]  start conducting behavior experiments on US citizens you heard that right the
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.080]  new executive order commands federal agencies to condition people into doing
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:16.240]  whatever the government wants them to do effectively turning we the people into
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:19.720]  lab rats running through a maze for a piece of cheese the feds are going to start
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:24.080]  hiring so-called behavioral scientists to encourage meaning brainwash people to
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:27.800]  say signing up for Obamacare or even turning into their guns at a local gun
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:31.760]  buyback program so basically the Obama administration wants to take the freedom
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.080]  of choice away from the individual and give it to the government that doesn't
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:38.560]  sound like freedom now does it freedom is the right of the people to choose how
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:41.280]  to live their lives as long as their conduct doesn't infringe on the rights
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.000]  of others to do the same the Obama administration however wants to brainwash
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.320]  you into surrendering that basic liberty they want you to be a lemming who
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:52.040]  jumps off the cliff when they say jump but you have the power to decide not to

[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:30.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show. Ladies and gentlemen I mentioned this
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:38.080]  last hour the stories up on info wars.com they've hired a former Stasi
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:44.080]  operative to head up censorship of anyone criticizing the open borders in
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:52.600]  Germany and they are arresting anyone and giving them 120 days in jail and or a
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:58.560]  5,000 euro fine any criticism and now they're telling women don't wear short
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:05.760]  skirts they're telling people you need to house these folks in your homes you
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:12.320]  have to understand Hitler was willing to kill millions of people to get power
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:16.840]  Stalin was willing to kill millions of people Genghis Khan was Julius Caesar
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:22.040]  it's breaking eggs and so for anybody who studied history or anybody who
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:26.800]  studied world events you know there's a confluence of things coming together
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:32.480]  most the top historians in the world long after Rawls and myself and others
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:37.840]  pointed it out it's not rocket science quite frankly have come out and said we
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:44.040]  have a lot of the same factors as world war one and world war two the economic
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:49.000]  the cultural all of it in the middle of it we have West hating freedom hating
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:57.040]  elites communists mainly run by big banks what a paradox who want to make
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:02.040]  the middle-class poor and break the back of Western culture who get on the news
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.240]  with a straight face and say don't call yourself a boy or girl you're a purple
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:10.880]  penguin so I was asking one of the top survivalists in the world's best-selling
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:16.280]  author mr. Rawls give you his website up on screen survival blog.com I was
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:21.000]  asking James Wesley Rawls the exacerbated question in his research
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.240]  who's at the bottom of the rabbit hole here what are the globalists want what's
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:31.360]  their end game I mean I know in my own mind what their end game is but I get
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:35.000]  why some new listeners hear this and just think it's fear porn well you're
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.760]  gonna think it's fair porn there's a world-wide depression which we're
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:41.520]  basically already into you're gonna think it's fair porn when that when they
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:44.360]  give your kid a forced inoculation or you go ahead and get it they have a
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:49.760]  seizure and ever talk again this isn't a game so I want you to understand for
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.600]  those of you that have been insulated that have been sheltered you have no
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.720]  idea the rest of the world's already in turmoil mr. Rawls finishing that big
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:03.040]  question takes as much time as you want about who runs it where's it going and
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:07.200]  then I want to get your prognosis on the world itself what you see coming in the
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.240]  future because you've been pretty accurate in the past and then tell us
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:13.240]  about your latest novels you're working on that's what we're basically done I
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:17.800]  guess about to be published about to be put out there on bookstore shelves that
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:23.320]  basically predicted so much of what's now happening well Alex yes to get back
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:27.840]  to what we're talking about in the last segment I think that when you come right
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:34.920]  down to it the folks that are behind the new world order are this are the same
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:41.720]  international bankers who have been pushing for this for centuries and while
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:47.680]  their their tactics have changed the strategy hasn't and when you come right
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:53.080]  down to the our folks who have all in the world and once you have all the
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:57.720]  money in the world the only thing that's left is power they want all the
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:04.280]  political all the nature of the world and ironically a lot of them don't even
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:09.760]  really care what system those nations are under as long as they control those
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:15.720]  nations and that explains things like World War one and World War two where
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:22.120]  you had you know essentially fascists versus communists and and some freedom
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:32.240]  loving people on the sidelines and the Cold War which you know went on for such
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:38.880]  a long time but the end result of it was that that was less free you know we
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:43.480]  were we're priding ourselves on the fact that we broke the back of
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:51.000]  international communism under the Reagan administration but the end result back
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:56.160]  30 or 40 years is that we now live in a less free country and in a lot of ways
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:03.120]  country that's a lot more like the Soviet Union used to be now than what we
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:09.280]  had back in the 19 we have more central planning we have less individual
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:19.000]  freedom when you come right down to it we are at the cusp of it probably what
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:24.120]  will probably it'll probably be a third world war is what it's going to be
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:31.200]  called in retrospect and the exactly how the nations will line up for that war
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:36.800]  is difficult to say and we have this huge wild card that's been created by the
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:45.720]  internationalists themselves which is radical Islam they want to have radical
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:56.960]  Islam as a foil as that the new enemy du jour and they want to use that as the
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:05.040]  pretext for forming global power structures global armies global currencies
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:15.160]  and global media and global control to them again the bottom line is not what
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:19.600]  system gets put in place but who controls that system that's right you
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.040]  can see the beauty I want you to continue on this eloquent breakdown then just
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:27.880]  like the Rothschild 300 years ago would fund both sides of European war or three
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:31.880]  or four sides then they just jumped to the winter at the end and then dictate
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:35.880]  the terms to the defeated just like World War two British intelligence and
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:39.720]  others had a secret peace treaty with Hitler that's been declassified they
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:45.680]  basically encouraged him to invade Czechoslovakia and Poland and Danzig and
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:49.040]  all these other places must think Hitler was good he was totally played and
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.400]  then he had a treaty to attack the Soviets and they would stop or attack
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:59.440]  the Russians and then they double-crossed him there on just so many fronts and you
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:04.720]  sit back and you realize oh my gosh the elite running us in World War two was
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:10.840]  more evil and sophisticated than Hitler and that's a hard group to beat that
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:15.120]  could actually play the Germans and you just sit back and on and you see them
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:19.280]  radicalizing Islam turning it loose giving them the weapons letting them
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:26.680]  overthrow our allies secular governments taking over it just goes on and on and
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:31.640]  on and then you see the ultimate enemy is free will it is the Western
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.840]  Christianity it is the Renaissance and you understand when they set up the
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:39.880]  Soviets then we had to build up to fight them but that was the globalist
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:44.880]  building up arms and a culture and a police state they again we control to
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:51.080]  then use against the people you see how sophisticated it is how do you get the
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:55.520]  public to even tune into that reality to understand that at the end of this end
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:01.160]  game there is mass population reduction world government the end of
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:07.000]  religious freedom forced inoculation I mean and now we're so close to it now in
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.040]  Europe they're arresting you if you don't want to have a thousand Islamists in
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:16.080]  your town of a thousand if you say it's wrong I don't want to pay for it they
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:24.920]  come and the Stasi arrest you the Stasi I mean it's so naked go ahead sorry
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:32.480]  I have to agree with you and you were asking how do we wake people up the
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:37.280]  method I chose was to write a novel because a lot of people will not sit
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:45.400]  down and read a treatise on globalism or treatise on economics but they will
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:52.320]  novel and I starting first with my Patriot series which was about social
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:55.440]  economic collapse here in the United States and now with my new series of
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:00.120]  novels that it's going to be at least a five book series called the counter
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:07.040]  caliphate chronicles I'm exposing what they have planned to do in instituting
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:16.960]  a semi successful Islamic caliphate my goal is to wake people up to get
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:25.360]  people and to basically shift their paradigm so that they can they can see
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:29.920]  through this nonsense that's being fed to them on the nightly news and they
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:37.400]  can reestablish critical thinking skills that's what's really needed here we
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:43.640]  need an educated electorate we need statesmen and setup politicians and we
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:49.400]  need people to stand up for their God give rights constitutional liberty we
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:55.120]  need to reestablish a constitutional republic and we need to defeat the
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:05.000]  globalists in detail and almas well I would hear you and I respected you I've
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.760]  been interviewing you off and off about 15 16 years first read one of your books
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.960]  20 years ago we actually put real militia leaders and stuff you know in in the
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:16.400]  book and then I finally interviewed and you said no I'm kind of writing what I
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:21.160]  think may happen in the future but putting it in a popular novel form so
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:24.280]  it actually reaches millions and you've had some number one New York Times best
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:29.240]  sellers but to now go back and read some of your books which I've done it makes
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:34.280]  me physically nauseous I can't even read them because I do see how accurate you
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:38.040]  were I'll be honest I hear Glenn Beck who's been wrong at a bunch of stuff six
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:43.240]  years ago say there's a plan to launch a new caliphate I would hear you know
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:49.640]  things like that and and I would think to myself this is overblown they'd never
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:54.240]  actually bring in giant Islamic armies and let them start attacking to fully
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:58.640]  bring stuff down but now I see there's a billion and a half Muslims they first
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:02.440]  successfully infiltrate them take them over put the most radical in charge give
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:05.840]  them weapons turn them loose and let them take over large areas and then what
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:09.480]  areas they don't let them take over they'll use the attacks to take us over
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:13.040]  in the name of protecting us they'll kill a bunch of cops with White House run
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:17.240]  groups the cops will then militarize know the name of it me I mean you can
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:22.040]  really see it this is sick so so as I was saying James in the past because I
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:25.800]  heard you talk about this 15 years ago plans for these Islamic armies and the
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:29.880]  rest of it I knew they'd wound up Al Qaeda for 9-11 that's now come out in the
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:35.040]  news but to a great extent it looks like under this whole world government
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:41.040]  system they plan to give Islam a huge seat at the table and make everyone
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:45.880]  adopt a one-world religion where we can't have Christianity we actually
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:51.600]  adopt a one-world religion that's partially Islamic and that that's how
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:55.360]  the politically correct use it they say we've got to be tolerant of whatever
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:59.680]  the most aggressive intolerant group is or you can't have a boys and girls
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:03.320]  bathroom that hurts somebody else because this radical minority says
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:07.880]  they're a transvestite I now see the paradigm of where they're going and
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:11.600]  they know how politically correct and pathetic we are now so they'll bring in
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:15.680]  a bunch of radical Muslims to bully us with government backing and they
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:20.360]  believe we're so broke back we will bow to them and worship them so how do we
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:26.560]  not go down that road and how did you see it coming so far away well to get
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:30.440]  back to your first part of your question if you look at the way the
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:35.680]  internationalists and globalists operate they always think in terms of
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:40.200]  multiple gains they never do anything unless they're gonna get more than one
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:47.600]  win out of the situation and in the case of backing international Islam they
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:55.280]  what they want to do is two things they want to have a worthwhile opponent that
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:02.400]  they can expand massive quantities of money on in the form of military
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:10.960]  armaments and military deployment and so forth and they want to also draw a
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:17.720]  parallel between Islamic fundamentalism and Christian fundamentalism they want
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:24.200]  to make us look like two heads of the same coin so that in their war on Islam
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:28.600]  they can have a simultaneous war on Christendom that's right they pass laws
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:34.880]  saying be nice be open where you now lose your basic right in the process yep
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:41.000]  that's that's their goal and I think that if you look at what's gone on in the
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.040]  events leading up to 9-11 and and of course everything has happened since 9-11
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:51.040]  that it's all played into this kind of master plan of both building up
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:59.720]  international Islam and putting fundamental Christianity in the same
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:06.760]  breath as fundamental Islam that's their goal and they played it very masterfully
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:14.240]  and of course they have the mass media as unwitting dupes in all of this and if
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:19.600]  you look at what what's been poured out of Hollywood what comes out of Madison
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:28.160]  Avenue and what comes out of the the halls of power inside the Beltway in DC
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:37.280]  it all fits together and unfortunately the folks that end up paying are the
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:42.520]  people our soldiers deployed overseas who end up paying in blood and the
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:48.880]  American people who are who are paying in the form of overtaxation and the
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:54.640]  diminishment of our individual liberty who you always have to ask yourself who
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:48:02.480]  benefits keep on old James Wesley Rawls is here just piercing insight he can
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:06.200]  take five minutes of my babbling and in 30 seconds crystallize it down but
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:10.280]  that's exactly what's happening is a war on religious freedom by importing the
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.080]  most radical and tolerant groups who they've also used to take over the
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:20.800]  Middle East and basically then bring in laws restricting all of our speech in a
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:26.680]  foil to quote suppress their more radical instincts but also exempting them
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:32.760]  to be radical but no one else can be quote radical and if you expand on that
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:36.760]  what some of the good news I see and I want to get James Wesley Rawls take on
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:44.520]  this is the military a couple years ago said no to backing a bombing of Assad in
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:48.560]  Syria for al-Qaeda and we saw a lot of non-commissioned officers and officers
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:52.760]  hold up signs and go to Twitter and Facebook saying I will not be the
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:55.720]  Air Force for al-Qaeda I will not fight on the ground to kill Christians in
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:59.920]  Syria they clearly saw that Assad didn't start the war he didn't do anything he's
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:03.800]  a he's a good guy compared to al-Qaeda he's certainly not perfect and that the
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:07.160]  West is destabilizing the whole region we already seen it in Egypt Libya so
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:11.240]  people understood it now we have the former head of defense intelligence
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:15.080]  coming out a month ago and saying we were ordered to back al-Qaeda in Syria it
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:18.560]  was a conscious decision and the reporter said so Obama didn't know what he was
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:21.440]  doing no we were ordered they knew exactly we told them what they were
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.480]  doing now we have the former deputy have the CIA coming out saying there needs
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:28.880]  to be an investigation it appears they were ordered to cover up that we knew
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.960]  we were aiding al-Qaeda which is really ISIS so I was here every day you were
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:37.640]  there talking about it but now US training helped mold top Islamic State
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:43.360]  military commander that's in McClatchy today they'll probably to pull a
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:47.600]  surprise for it we told you four years ago house dims what 9-11 docks of Saudi
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:52.000]  Arabia declassified President Obama orders behavioral experiments on American
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.600]  public with the CIA domestically this is where it's all that's daily callers see
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:01.520]  it's all getting really weird now where CIA is operating domestically and you know
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:04.560]  I'll be walking down the street they'll have guys they're obviously military and
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:09.280]  wearing clothes going to work with us Alex I mean it's getting really weird how
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:13.560]  they're have their soft intimidation going how they're messing with people but
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:18.400]  at the same time the military people who aren't openly evil who don't want to be
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:21.800]  bad who know there's always been some corruption but understand they were
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:27.160]  lied to you don't dance with the devil and then he changes you change when we
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.320]  come back I want to get into the good things that are happening and what do
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:35.040]  you think about the situation where openly backing Islam radical Islam to go
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:38.600]  around and murder everybody our own military saying no is there some
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:44.720]  breaking point where the spirit of sanity could wake up and we could say no
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:49.040]  to this divide and conquer strategy we'll be back with James Wesley Rawls

[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:15.560]  money on advertising and things and chasing that I want to just focus on

[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:35.720]  bunch are already carrying it I've got a video that we haven't aired yet with the

[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:04.480]  have left how big is it that our military is coming out and saying we
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:10.920]  don't want to back al-qaeda was definitely a substantial shift and it's
[01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:18.320]  evidence that people are waking up folks on the street folks in the military you
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:24.840]  don't have to be deployed to the sandbox three or four times to wake up a lot of
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:29.520]  people are waking up just on their a lot of these soldiers sailors airmen are
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:33.560]  waking up on their first deployment they're talking with other people they're
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:37.480]  looking at the big picture they're seeing what's really going on absolutely

[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:15.240]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:22.520]  network and now live from austin texas alex jones well dick cheney
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:26.280]  openly wrote the p-net document september 2000 they would use the
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:30.400]  class of civilization by radicalizing islam and allowing it to invade the
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:36.240]  tech west to bring in world government fellow obama is actually doing it this
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:39.840]  doesn't mean stir up the radical muslims so you go blow them up because you want
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:44.120]  to save america or whatever no if you go blow them up so they hate you then you
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:47.840]  radicalize them then you bring them in james leslie rolls one of the top probably
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:51.320]  the top survivalist authors and researchers out there formerly army
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:55.520]  intelligence and just really knows his stuff that's why it's so popular it
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:58.520]  joins us you got cut off by the break four minutes here twelve minutes in the
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:02.320]  next segment coming up we'll start taking some calls but james getting into
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:05.800]  how big a game changer is it repeat what you said and continue that our own
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:10.240]  militaries all across the board leaking generals are going public hey there's
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:14.640]  been a purge our government's betraying us they ordered us to back al-qaeda I
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:20.200]  mean it shows there is too far for the system to go the couch potatoes may not
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:24.960]  care but the military and even brass are saying no that's got a really freak
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:29.720]  out the establishment well yes I think they should be running for cover right
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:36.760]  now because when the ranking file military and the military leadership
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:42.640]  wakes up to the gravity of the situation and really takes the blinders off and
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:49.240]  looks at what's really going on how they've been played and what the end
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:54.840]  result of all this this endless this endless round of deployments it's just
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:58.600]  deployment after deployment after deployment that's tearing apart family
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:04.000]  that's wearing down our military this wearing us out logistically this
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:10.720]  stretching our supply chain to the breaking point and this essentially
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:15.920]  hamstrung us from the ability to fight a conventional but they could see the
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:23.000]  setup that's the key the everything that's gone on since 9-11 has gutted our
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:28.160]  military so that when World War three breaks out it'll just be just like the
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:32.120]  out that the out of World War one and outbreak of World War two where we're
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:40.720]  not physically prepared to fight a conventional war on two fronts we've
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:46.160]  been involved in counterinsurgency for so long and we've reorganized and
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:51.880]  pared down our our military and worn out our military the point where we can't
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:03:00.760]  fight a two-front conventional war so the military is used to at the brass
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:04.960]  level Hegelian dialectic and dirty tricks and playing people off against
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:09.640]  each other but they can see how our own military in America is being degraded
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:13.560]  being set up being prepared briefly we're gonna go to break and come back you
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:16.720]  can talk more on this but I know it's hard to see who's gonna line up with
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:20.120]  who in World War three in many respects I think it's already started
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:24.280]  economically and with migrants and with destabilization Ukraine all of it but
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:28.000]  what are some of the blocks that we could see allying themselves in World War
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:34.840]  three well again it's difficult to predict but I believe that they're going
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:44.360]  to try to have a pivot that will that will put China and Russia as counter
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:56.520]  polls and where the Islamic world is going to line up with the Russians the
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:03.240]  Russian goal of course is to get their long sought after warm sea warm water
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:12.760]  port port but as as everything lines up for World War three you're gonna see
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:17.040]  some pretty strange alliances and it'll be just like Orwell pointed out where
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:21.960]  you have country a versus B and teaming up with country C or whatever and then
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:27.600]  and then changing the order for the next World War we could see some pretty
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:35.160]  strange bedfellows when everything lines up for World War three and some of the
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:42.120]  folks that we have long depended upon to be allies may not be there for us and
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:46.920]  through the whole process trillions are made for the central banks we lose more
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:52.520]  freedoms and we start basically sliding in the technocracy even deeper we're
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:55.880]  gonna come right back in three minutes with our guest stay with us special
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:05:01.720]  for me now I'm guest the Miss America pageant is known for beautiful women
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:06.600]  who sometimes give rather amusing answers but recently Miss South Carolina
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:11.280]  turned the tide when she was asked about this do you support a ban on
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:16.440]  military style assault weapons I don't but I think it's because we need to
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:19.880]  increase education we have to go back there if we teach people the proper way
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:25.600]  to use the guns then we will reduce the risk of having gun related
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:30.160]  related accident it starts with education even before she could finish
[02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:33.920]  answering her question her response received a massive applause
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:38.000]  demonstrating strong support for gun rights despite the establishment's
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.080]  ongoing gun demonization campaign and yes there have been high-profile slain
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:47.280]  with fully automatic rifles but the FBI's own numbers show that you're more
[02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:51.480]  likely to be killed by a blunt object such as a baseball bat or hammer you

[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:24.800]  racist I mean these people are so evil and they know they're bad they don't
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:28.760]  think you're doing this for some great or good they want total control obama
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:31.720]  lands and air force one and tells Africans they can't have air conditioning
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:39.480]  or cars I mean these people are just so bad and they can't help it but so many
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:42.240]  folks are donating hundreds and hundreds of people have donated we've
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:46.120]  raised sixty eight thousand dollars so far but is it with any money bomb I
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:49.920]  count the profit of shopping cart purchases into the money bombs we're
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:53.160]  gonna be adding that it's well over a hundred thousand dollars right now as
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:57.600]  soon as those calculations go through and this is what helps fund our
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:02.680]  operation believe me fifty plus employees and contractors and the
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:08.640]  insurance and the electricity and the servers and the equipment and the all
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:14.240]  of it cost us a massive amount of money to put five hours of radio and TV on
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:18.960]  television satellite every day to reach every UHF VHF cable system in the
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:23.760]  country and to have ten thousand dollars a month that's what it costs for that
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:27.720]  many hours it's about a hundred dollars an hour it's federal law have to have
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.040]  closed captioning a person's doing it we have to have a high-def feed to these
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:34.440]  people we've got one of the biggest companies doing it they type it all out
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:38.520]  so somebody can hit their closed captioning that's ten thousand dollars a month it
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:42.160]  comes out to about four hundred thousand dollars a year just to pay for the
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:45.720]  satellite the closed captioning then there's all the rest of it so when I
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:49.800]  say I want to raise a million dollars that's just so we can do this new thing
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:54.840]  this year not even expand I intend to find the hot products the best things
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:59.480]  the the best ways to promote things to be self-sufficient selling quality
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:02.840]  products at low prices well have to do this why haven't had a money bomb in
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:08.720]  three years but it's fun to do a 24 26 27 this is our longest ever 28 hour
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:13.680]  broadcast it's fun to do it the listeners and viewers like it but it's also
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:18.520]  about you know just saying hey we're some of the best outlets there are we have a
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:22.400]  responsibility to not just stay the same but to expand in the face of this
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:27.480]  craziness and that's what we're doing and as soon as this phase is successful
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:32.560]  and I've got enough affiliates enough advertising revenue to expand I'm gonna
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:36.520]  get satellites into Europe the Middle East Africa and Asia then we get another
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:41.800]  satellite hitting the South Pacific in Australia and other areas all counted
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:46.840]  to get the big mainline satellites hit the whole populated areas the world five
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:51.400]  hours a day the best prices we've gone to the big conferences flown to Chicago
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:56.960]  New York gone to talk to folks in Europe we've got some of the cheapest rates
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:02.320]  out there but to do all of that we're talking about two and a half million
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:06.480]  dollars a year just for the satellites and all the rest of stuff and we're
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:09.880]  obviously far from that right now we're just going to hit Canada in the United
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:13.920]  States in northern Mexico we've already got the affiliates lined up so the
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:18.680]  info wars.com forward slash affiliates want to find out our simple free-to-air
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:24.440]  contract there's what 13 minutes of advertising an hour and we only get three
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:30.840]  of them I mean nobody else does that the contract so easy to sign and boom you
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:34.760]  can rebroadcast you just pull one of the episodes the nightly news the radio
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:40.520]  slash TV put it on the weekend test it out whatever we did this because I was
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:43.880]  internet television before anybody else did it and people kept saying at
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:50.120]  affiliates UHF VHF affiliates that had AM and FM stations they'd say hey up the
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:55.440]  production value we'll put it on TV and so we did do that and we've got a bunch
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:59.480]  of stations mainly that air us on the weekend and stuff and that's very
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:05.780]  popular very very very very popular so that's why we're doing this okay James
[02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:10.800]  Wesley Rawls is our guest I want to go to phone calls for him with eagle eyes as
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:21.000]  he's ex-army military intel listening on WNFZ in Tennessee I want to go to Dan on
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:26.200]  9-11 issues listening on info war streams that a lot of folks Sam and
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:29.280]  Kansas Mitch and Georgia James and Michigan will be going to your calls
[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:34.440]  here in a minute James Wesley Rawls other points you'd like to make to people
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:37.520]  about what you're most concerned about what you see happening negative things
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:44.000]  positive things we've now entered this time where people that are even halfway
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.520]  awake now know this is for real I've always known it's for real I've always
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:52.880]  hoped we could slow it down or stop it it's beyond the sick feeling now I'm not
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:59.080]  even afraid anymore I'm just so disgusted with the people that want to be part of
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:04.080]  this and the collaborators I mean they're so openly signing on to evil it
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:09.520]  gives me hope our military is trying to say no but they just still move forward
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:13.760]  I mean it isn't what's it like for you a veteran a patriot a guy who's been
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:19.120]  fighting this for 20 years 25 years what's it like for you well it is very
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:24.000]  discouraging but at the same time it is encouraging to watch people wake up to
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:30.560]  see that that people have finally lifted the veil and and are looking at the big
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:37.720]  picture they're seeing what's really going on on a macro level and they're no
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:44.240]  longer just concerning themselves with local politics just with individual
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:50.040]  issues but the larger issues the big issues like who is really pushing for
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:54.320]  freedom in the world and who's trying to enslave us they're looking at that as
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:15:00.280]  as a bottom line issue and just to back up for a little bit I want to encourage
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:07.600]  your listeners and viewers to go ahead and make some purchases of things like
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:12.880]  storage food and nutritional products that will really help your family pull
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:17.920]  through because I'm sure you've all heard that there's going to be an
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:23.840]  orchestrated collapse your family needs to be ready for that and I consider it a
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:30.480]  great big win-win if you order some of those products through info wars it's a
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:35.560]  win-win because not only will you be getting your family better prepared but
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:40.400]  you're also going to be building a war chest for Alex Jones to get the message
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:49.440]  out there now to get back to your question I think that we are living in
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:55.800]  very perilous times but it is both discouraging and encouraging because
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:16:04.160]  even though we could see the the drums of war being beaten we can see the storm
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:10.560]  clouds of economic catastrophe on the horizon we can also take heart in the
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:16.120]  fact that our friends our neighbors our relatives our fellow church congregants
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:20.760]  are waking up to the big picture they're getting involved and they're not
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:27.560]  they're not going to back down we also have a two-edged sword with with modern
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:33.720]  technology in that yes modern technology is is slowly enslaving us because we
[02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:39.360]  now have our own cars and our computers kind of spying on us but at the same
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:44.080]  time we have technologies like smartphones that are in almost everyone's
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:49.400]  pockets and that smartphone is an instrument of liberty a couple of years
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:58.440]  ago one of my sons and I started a free press credentials organization and our
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:02.360]  goal there was to get press credentials in the hands of everyone because in the
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:07.400]  modern context everyone that owns a smartphone can be an on-the-ground
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:14.120]  journalist reporting on what's going on and I encourage people to get those
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:20.880]  credentials and get involved and when you see people's rights getting trampled
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:28.200]  pull out your smartphone turn it on in camera mode and document what's what's
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:32.160]  going on you can be part of the solution that's right I mean this is just a tool
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:36.720]  like a gun the enemy is using it to control us we have to use it to expose
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:40.920]  what they're doing and support good police when they're good go after and
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:44.960]  expose bad police when they're bad but I really see despite the fact they're
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:49.200]  trying to hire thugs with these psychological actuaries I've seen the
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:54.320]  police really wake up give us so much good information and the police I run
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:58.480]  into all over the country are some of the most informed freaked out people I'm
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:02.800]  seeing because they get in the coming civil war the globalist want to start
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:06.360]  that they are going to be put on the chopping block and that the system wants
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:12.600]  to use the crises that are coming to basically degrade them call them soften
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:18.600]  them up just like they're doing the military right so again as people need
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:24.680]  to wake up get involved the the free press credentials organization that I
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:32.880]  mentioned before the folks can find at cfapa.org that's cfapa.org and we're
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:37.360]  about the only organization out there that will issue free press credentials
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:44.120]  to anyone all they have to do is print them out and slap a photograph on there
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:48.200]  and laminate a badge and they are ready to get out there well you've been
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:52.200]  doing a lot to try to save this republic I ran into a fellow that knew you
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:56.360]  during the Reg administration I'm not gonna get into how I knew him but he was
[02:18:56.360 --> 02:19:00.720]  pretty high-level fellow and he said that you were under him in some
[02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:06.640]  operations you were part of but he was just telling me separately how awake
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:10.000]  the intelligence services are he now works for a major computer company
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:14.160]  developing stuff of the Pentagon and others but he just said that you know I
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:18.200]  used to hear my show 15 years ago and he couldn't even believe it but that now
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:21.840]  he was basically more radical than I was and I think we've hit that point now
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:27.040]  where people really get that the bottoms dropped out and I kind of asked this
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:30.280]  question earlier but I want to ask this question and then talk about the collapse
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:35.120]  they're engineering and then go to calls but isn't it a spiritual issue at the
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:38.960]  end of the day when I really study these people because I mean I've always been a
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:42.640]  Christian but but I wasn't some Bible thumper guy I wasn't somebody obsessed
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:46.600]  with it all the time I wasn't somebody praying at every meal I had god in my
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:50.280]  heart I love justice that was it but the more I study these people the more I
[02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:55.640]  fight them the more I get around them I realize they really are animated by a
[02:19:55.640 --> 02:20:01.440]  love of evil and a love of hurting justice a love of dominating good people
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:07.000]  and I just can't see how anyone's gonna let this level the other issue is our
[02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:12.800]  enemy is so chicken neck they're so weak their eyes have no fire why is it that
[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:18.120]  such weak scum is dominating us that just adds insult to injury I mean are we
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:23.760]  really gonna let filth like this run our lives yeah it is it is troubling to
[02:20:23.760 --> 02:20:29.920]  see that but in essence what is really going on here is spiritual warfare there
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:34.720]  are powers of darkness that want to enslave the whole world and they will
[02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:38.760]  make a pact with the devil if they think that's what will get that power for
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:46.800]  them and what you asked about our chicken neck to pull opponents I think one
[02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:50.400]  of the reasons that they've been as successful as they have is because they've
[02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:59.640]  had the media elites in league with them the the media elite that that pushes
[02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:09.280]  the mainstream news organizations that that packages and engineers everything
[02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:15.120]  that comes out of Hollywood and Bollywood and Nollywood that they're all
[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:23.600]  in in cahoots the edit all good that all goes back to academia which was
[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:30.320]  co-opted years and years ago by the leftists and globalists and basically
[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:35.680]  everyone that comes out of journalism school these days is going to be a
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:42.200]  leftist center internationalist globalist I went to journalism school
[02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:49.120]  back in the 1980s and I was already a minority then perhaps 10% of the folks
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:53.360]  attending journalism school would be classified as Christian conservatives at
[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:59.480]  that time and I think unfortunately it's even less now so the media is not on our
[02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:06.480]  side and that's what's allowed the folks who want to us to enslave us to frame
[02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:10.720]  the whole conversation and create a false reality and then again I look at
[02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:14.840]  them they're not even real liberals it's a cult they all talk the same they're
[02:22:14.840 --> 02:22:19.000]  ordering us how to speak they're saying we've got to pay for everybody else's
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:27.520]  stuff yeah there they are whether consciously or unconsciously playing
[02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:33.280]  into the hands of the globalist elitists that want to enslave us and they
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:39.640]  think it's somehow in our best interest for them to to shovel this down our
[02:22:39.640 --> 02:22:45.480]  throats and they do it across the board if you look at almost everything
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:49.200]  that comes out of Hollywood and everything that all the advertising that
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:56.440]  comes out of Madison Avenue all of the major network and also cable network
[02:22:56.440 --> 02:23:03.960]  news it's all very neatly, slickly packaged and it all fits their agenda
[02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:13.440]  and all uses the same gosh awful rhetoric that wants to remove individual
[02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:21.000]  liberty. It's really amazing because I look at the Republican establishment
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:25.560]  it's obviously a handmade into this whole thing but they're just moving so
[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:29.640]  quick they're so obvious they're so out in the open about it all they're so
[02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:37.160]  brazen but I really see it as their arrogant bravada driven response to the
[02:23:37.160 --> 02:23:43.040]  fact that they know people are waking up but at the same time waking up but then
[02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:47.960]  not taking action. A, how do you think the average person should take action? I
[02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:52.200]  think you hinted at it becoming a citizen journalist just doing something to
[02:23:52.200 --> 02:23:56.800]  warn others but B, getting into the collapse you were on with us under
[02:23:56.800 --> 02:23:59.560]  eight nine months ago the last time I've been writing your new novel so you couldn't
[02:23:59.560 --> 02:24:03.400]  come on but you'd never said I believe collapse is right around the corner I
[02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:08.320]  believe it's imminent last time you were on if memory serves you said no no I
[02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:12.680]  think we're a year away I think this is it you can see the preparations well now
[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:17.680]  in your most areas the world the collapse is already here so what's your
[02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:23.320]  view on global collapse? Well I think it's definitely being orchestrated the if
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:28.160]  nothing else the mountains of debt that's built then built up public and
[02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:33.400]  private and the derivatives to go along with it are sowing the seeds of
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:41.160]  disaster and at any given time the elites can pull the plug implode the
[02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:49.320]  system wipe out entire currencies and and with it wipe out and unseat entire
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:56.520]  governments in the process that's the endgame for them so we're on the cusp of
[02:24:56.520 --> 02:25:04.120]  a collapse the question here in the United States is do the elites want to
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:10.560]  wait until after the next presidential election do they want to see a Democrat
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:20.520]  seated before it happens or do they want is their goal to to to wait or do they
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:27.920]  want to see it collapse first and then have try to make a Democratic candidate
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:35.040]  look to be another FDR style savior for our economy I'm not sure how it's going
[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:40.600]  to play out but either way sure individual families need to get prepared
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:44.880]  need to not just wake up but they also need to stock up and team up and train up
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:49.960]  to be ready for this because it's only going to be the families that are well
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:53.880]  prepared where you're going to have someone who can have their head up to
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:57.640]  look at the big picture everyone else is going to be concerned with where they're
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:02.200]  going to get their next meal for their family folks who are operating at that
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:07.320]  level are not going to be part of the solution they're going to just be
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:13.120]  individual survivors out there sure look at how I think I want people to thrive so
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:18.040]  that they can be part of the solution they could be part of rebuilding a a
[02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:23.200]  truly Republican form of constitutional government in this nation I totally agree
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:27.640]  I mean look at how Europe would bring in millions this year of radical Islamist
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:31.200]  and encourage them and let them get there and then arrest people that
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:36.480]  criticize it this is really happening now the next wave will be five ten
[02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:40.880]  million I mean this is this is World War three by the central banks to bring
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:44.960]  down Europe in the US they're pulling the same stuff here they're going to
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:48.840]  cause a nationwide rioting and killing of police the feds will come in as the
[02:26:48.840 --> 02:26:54.680]  saviors federalize everything you can really see that they've decided to try
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:59.160]  to do this they're trial ballooning it now their trial balloon is incredibly
[02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:06.360]  destructive James and I think this we have economy left we have a shell of
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:12.040]  an economy left in this nation and it's just moving along because of inertia and
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:17.000]  because of the Zerp they deserve interest rate policy that we've had for so
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:22.560]  many years that's creating up a false prosperity you think the federal get
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:27.120]  rid of that or keep that I'm sorry say again do you think the Fed will keep
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:30.120]  zero interest rates or we'll start raising them I think they will for the
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:33.240]  foreseeable future because they've really backed themselves into a corner if
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:38.920]  they even raise interest rates a quarter of a percent it's going to be perceived
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:43.520]  as a turning point and that could collapse the entire economy I want to go
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:47.680]  to break come back well absolutely I want to go to break come back to take
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:50.320]  calls with you for about ten minutes and then we're going to let you go we're

[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:57.880]  your time Eagle Eye and others I'm going to go to you in fact right now but after
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:02.120]  break I've got something really important to say folks it's just I'll just say it
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:05.240]  now I'm going to eagle off the break is only your brief take on this I'm not
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:09.080]  saying I'm the smartest guy around the toughest guy around but I do have a good
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:13.480]  six cents my whole life I got a gut that's never wrong a nose that's never
[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:17.200]  wrong they say and that's what I go with as I get older and things you know just
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:21.600]  get better the more I follow my spirit that's what it really is I've never had
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:26.400]  my six cents so on fire it's beyond being afraid it's beyond the hair on the
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:32.800]  back of my neck standing up it's so over the top James that I just feel for
[02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:37.000]  people that don't know what's coming because obviously it may not be here
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:40.960]  this year next year but in other parts of the world it's already here I mean my
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:46.400]  gut tells me get ready for full-out defend your life and my gut tells me it's
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:50.800]  not just you it's going to be everybody I mean my gut tells me all hell is going
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:54.280]  to break lose and what we're going to see is going to make World War two look
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:29:00.800]  like heaven you may very well be right Alex and after the break I'd be happy
[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:04.720]  to take those calls we got 40 seconds what does your gut tell you because you
[02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:14.000]  off the facts what is your gut tell you we're facing well I think that we're
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:19.800]  definitely on the cusp of economic collapse and with that we'll they'll
[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:28.080]  try to try to marshal up to bring martial law to select cities in the
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:33.120]  United States they'll use the collapse and all the riots and looting that goes
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:37.440]  along with it as a pretext for instituting martial law in those
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:43.680]  cities folks who are living in lightly populated areas stay there guys
[02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:48.880]  we're going to finish up the right to eagle eye Dan James Major Sam March the
[02:29:48.880 --> 02:29:56.000]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:57.360 --> 02:30:03.120]  get Daniels info wars calm president Obama has ordered the federal government
[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:07.520]  to start conducting behavior experiments on US citizens here at that right the
[02:30:07.520 --> 02:30:10.960]  new executive order commands federal agencies to condition people into doing
[02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:14.160]  whatever the government wants them to do effectively turning we the people into
[02:30:14.160 --> 02:30:17.400]  lab rats running through a maze for a piece of cheese the feds are going to
[02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:20.600]  start hiring so-called behavioral scientists to encourage meaning
[02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:24.720]  brainwash people to say signing up for Obamacare or even turning into their
[02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:29.000]  guns at a local gun buyback program so basically the Obama administration wants
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.800]  to take the freedom of choice away from the individual and give it to the
[02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:35.400]  government that doesn't sound like freedom now does it freedom is the right
[02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:38.200]  of the people to choose how to live their lives as long as their conduct
[02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:41.080]  doesn't infringe on the rights of others to do the same the Obama
[02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:44.040]  administration however wants to brainwash you into surrendering that

[02:33:22.520 --> 02:33:27.520]  mainstream media the people it's got captured are certainly captured want to
[02:33:27.520 --> 02:33:31.720]  thank you all for your donations they will help fund the satellite close
[02:33:31.720 --> 02:33:37.560]  captioning more reporters getting our reporters out in the field and then it
[02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:40.840]  is my intention this be our last fundraiser ever have it done one in three
[02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:45.040]  years the one three years ago I never told people on tend to be our last but
[02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:48.920]  I didn't intend to be our last and then the mainstream media was bullying and
[02:33:48.920 --> 02:33:52.360]  saying it was wrong that I sold products it was wrong that we existed it was wrong
[02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:55.360]  that we were reaching millions of people a day I said you know I'll just do a
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:58.680]  fundraiser then and I'll sell a bunch of even more products and we'll get even
[02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:03.680]  bigger since you want to try to tell us to shut up and go away so you really do
[02:34:03.680 --> 02:34:07.600]  have a huge effect when you donate whether it's $5 or $5,000 but I'll
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:11.200]  tell you this it's got to feel good to donate to a cause fighting for human
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:16.160]  freedom then to have the government take money from you and then give it to
[02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:20.840]  organizations like media matters and others that come after your basic
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:28.040]  freedom so that's what it comes down to that's why we have the 2015 Operation
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:33.960]  Money Bomb which is an attempt to just augment our war chest I mean they spend
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:41.200]  Bloomberg sometimes spends 10, 15, 20 million in one city trying to pass anti-gun
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:46.200]  ordinances so the little people have to start giving but I'll say something here
[02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:50.120]  briefly and they go to your phone calls with James Wesley Rawls if you are
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:53.840]  nouveau riche if you're self-made if you're worth a million dollars ten
[02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:58.560]  million dollars twenty million dollars a hundred million dollars you are insane
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:03.040]  if you don't start your own radio station or TV station and carry shows
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:06.440]  like this or if you don't put up billboards for shows and expose what's
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:10.960]  happening or if you don't run for office or if you don't write a book or if you
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:17.160]  don't donate to our Money Bomb there is no place that you could give money to

[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:06.280]  run through your calls eagle eye in Tennessee thank you for holding thanks
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:11.200]  for being part of the broadcast go ahead you're listening on WNFC 94.3 FM in
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:17.920]  Tennessee thank you gentlemen I just wanted to first I wanted to pray for
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:24.520]  peace love and protection for you and for all the warriors of liberty and you
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:28.520]  know what now knowledge is the is power is key knowing it's half the battle
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:33.760]  seeing what's coming up front gives us the opportunity to be able to to affect
[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:39.080]  change a prayer does that change and I pray that God would would know what show
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:42.680]  us what he would have us to do and that we would hear him and obey him and be
[02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:46.000]  able to do those things because that's gonna be critical now the analysis of
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:51.280]  the situation as I see it the number one problem that we are going to have to
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:56.840]  come up with a solution to is the coming and pending communications total
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:40:00.960]  blackout that will completely eliminate our ability to communicate with one
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:05.000]  another especially for those who are of like mind and the spirit that are
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:08.800]  truly the Patriots of this country trying to fight to the liberty and freedom and I
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:12.800]  wanted to get both of your thoughts on the best way to handle that well let me
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:15.720]  just say this and have James have the floor on the subject and Dr. Grips
[02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:18.560]  coming into the next segment I'll do about 20 30 minutes with him and
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:22.000]  overdrive then Anthony Gutierrez gonna come in as well because I've pushed
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:26.360]  group back and that's wrong and he's got T intel for us but what you said is the
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:30.360]  entire truth and I don't know why I don't say it more I do this so much I'm so
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:34.320]  exhausted and I'm not complaining it's just that I don't do very well a lot of
[02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:39.240]  the time because I just do too much of this but asking God to lead God and
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:44.400]  direct us is key if we just pray to God to show us what to do to fight this great
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:48.440]  evil and to try to to lessen its attack because we know it's coming I'm going
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:53.280]  way past the point of trying to stop it and we do need to ask God to tell us
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:56.840]  what to do isn't that true I mean I know you're gonna agree James but can you
[02:40:56.840 --> 02:41:01.600]  talk about that and what's key for us to pray for and then be get into his
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:06.760]  communications takeover with the Obama kill switch we know is in place right
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:11.240]  yes it's important that we be in close covenant with God we can't expect God's
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:16.880]  covenant blessings unless we're in the covenant with him and we need to pray
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:21.720]  specifically that God would put us in the right place at the right time with
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:26.160]  the right people I think that should be our key prayer for the months and years
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:30.120]  to come because we're going to be coming into it a very dark period for our
[02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:36.360]  nation I refer to it as the age of deception and betrayal that's the age
[02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:42.400]  we're entering the age of just deception and betrayal and to to focus on
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:47.360]  communications that's one of the things that we have been writing about year
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:52.040]  after year in survival blog is the importance of every family having
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:58.600]  multiple modes of communication I do recommend that people even if they
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:03.200]  don't want if they don't want the shackles of an FCC license at least go to
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:08.640]  a ham radio swap meet talk with some of the old timers there and get yourself
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:17.320]  set up for both two meter and HF communications equipment and for point
[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:23.400]  to point communications at a individual retreat or ranch I recommend the MERS
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:30.640]  band radios that's MURS which stands for multiple user radio system it's a
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:40.720]  unlicensed and that is it sits fairly close to the CB band but it's very
[02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:45.400]  underutilized it will not be crowded in the event of a crisis at least in
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:53.680]  suburban and rural areas and again it's required and it will be your means of
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:58.040]  communication it also sits right next to the National Weather Service
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:43:02.240]  frequencies so you can have your handheld MERS walkie-talkie this program
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:09.440]  with both your local MERS push-to-talk frequency and the National Weather
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:16.160]  Service alert frequency which sits right next to that band as well as having
[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:21.080]  permit or security via a system called it a Dakota alert I've written a lot
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:27.280]  about that in my blog the Dakota alert system also uses the MERS band
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:34.560]  frequencies so that one handheld radio can be your solution for push-to-talk to
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:38.800]  talk with your neighbors and folks right there to retreat for coordinating
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:46.560]  retreat security as well as having access to to weather alerts and being
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:51.120]  alerted when someone's entering your property through a Dakota alert infrared
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:57.280]  driveway alarm system all right God bless you eagle eye anything else thank
[02:43:57.280 --> 02:44:01.040]  you for your service to both of you and God bless you God bless America
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:06.640]  aerosol I tell you folks it's just you thank you sir it's just so crazy to know
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:10.440]  that they really do plan I mean that's one big thing that's scary James you
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:13.440]  said years ago other guests said years ago the elites were buying secret air
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:17.320]  strips underground bases run into the hills now they admit they're doing it
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:22.080]  and just what a nasty elite to screw the world up so bad they've got to go hide
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:26.120]  out but they don't care because after all this they'll come back and be our
[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:31.760]  rulers I mean what a group of sick freaks absolutely Alex and when you come
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:37.200]  right down to it that's what's really going on we have a power elite that
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:41.760]  want that has all the money in the world they just want more power and again as
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:45.000]  I mentioned before they don't care what system it's under as long as they're the
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:49.480]  ones at the controls and that's why they'll fund all these different groups
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:52.360]  and let there be a big battle because they've got their operatives at the key
[02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:57.160]  level so when whatever is in power they'll still be in control I mean what a
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:00.800]  group of loons and what's crazy is they're already in control pretty much
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:05.960]  they just want total global control and so they're willing to endanger even
[02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:10.720]  themselves for the power grab these people are psychopathic yes it is
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:16.040]  psychopathic or at least sociopathic when you come right down to it oh man I
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:19.080]  tell you let's go to Mitch in Georgia thanks for holding her on the air with
[02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:23.800]  James Wesley Rawls go ahead hi Alex hi James I just want to first take my head
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:27.520]  off to you Alex and tell you how much of an amazing man and amazing courage is
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:31.840]  for a patriot you are same as you James and I just want to give right to it Alex
[02:45:31.840 --> 02:45:35.560]  you are one of the first and one of the most noble and courageous people people
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:41.680]  that have exposed an issue I want to ask your thoughts about in in-game the
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:44.800]  broad of the other documentary you exposed the organ harvesting of the
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:49.000]  fallen gong the spiritual movement in China we're now up to four million have
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:53.560]  been killed and now it has been coined the largest genocide in history out of
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:57.800]  China where now the basically the entire Chinese economy has been used to
[02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:02.040]  eradicate the fallen gong spiritual movement for their organs and it's
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:05.560]  basically appropriate because Pat Planned Parenthood has been doing the same
[02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:09.000]  thing but what is going on with the fallen gong in China is may has made
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.960]  Planned Parenthood look like little babies and I just want to take my head off
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:16.200]  to you Alex and ask you don't take your head off to me I mean we exposed that
[02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:20.840]  because that could happen to us we have empathy but absolutely how a great term
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:26.440]  you use they the globalist use economies and gear them to destroy who they want
[02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:30.680]  that's what a command-and-control non-free market economy a free market
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:35.280]  economy is what you want happens the will of the people but a globalist
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:40.040]  economy is what they want that's a very powerful statement James your comment
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:47.000]  on what Mitch was just talking about well yes organ harvesting on moss is
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:52.080]  definitely going on both in China and here in the United States and if I were a
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:58.040]  black American I would be deeply deeply outraged to know that the entire Planned
[02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:04.960]  Parenthood apparatus was specifically directed at the so-called urban areas of
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:10.000]  the United States they actually wanted to reduce the black population of America
[02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:14.440]  that's why they put so many of the Planned Parenthood centers in urban
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:20.400]  areas they were specifically going after black Americans and here we they've been
[02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:29.040]  caught red-handed literally red-handed harvesting baby organs and selling them
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:36.160]  on the open market it is a sick sick system and I'm glad that people are
[02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:41.880]  exposing this but that is just one aspect of the larger battle well imagine
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:46.040]  what we don't know about I mean it's always worse than we even thought and I
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:49.000]  have to know a lot of stuff that's going on that I've mentioned on air but
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:53.400]  people just can't believe it I've read in scientific papers 20 years ago they've
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:47:57.320]  created thousands of different human animal chimeras they just don't roll
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:03.480]  them out in Costa Rica in in Thailand all over I mean the abominations already
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:07.920]  committed by the elite are so horrible I can't believe God hasn't already blown
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:14.040]  the whole planet up well we one thing's for sure we only deserve God's wrath and
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:20.720]  we need to beg God to stay in covenant with us and at this stage of the game
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:25.600]  we are at the end of the church age we cannot expect God to protect the United
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:29.880]  States as a nation the best we can hope for is that he will protect the
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:35.200]  individuals families and church families and communities at this stage well
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:41.240]  that's something I have a quandary with we should be employing God that he we
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:47.680]  should be employing him to protect us individually thank you so much magic I
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:50.760]  bless you good to hear from you yeah that's that that's something it's a
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:54.760]  paradox because I want to be protected I want my family to protect it but then
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:58.160]  if God just burned the whole planet up and started over I would I would get it
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:03.120]  I wouldn't blame God because man we have really taken free will and decided to
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:09.160]  just be absolutely evil well yes that's what the media has been drumming into
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:14.920]  everyone's heads that we're to be like God's and to turn our back on God his
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:22.040]  sovereignty his plan and his covenant with us so at this stage of the game if
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:27.120]  you look at things like the abortion mills for example we only deserve God's
[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:33.400]  wrath and we can at this stage only beg God that he would stay in covenant with
[02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:41.960]  us and protect us we need to pray those 91st song well I tell you this the
[02:49:41.960 --> 02:49:45.880]  enemy knows about these rules that's why it's gotten us to go along with the
[02:49:45.880 --> 02:49:49.360]  corruption or denied it's there and let it happen so that we would lose our
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:57.280]  protection and I just I just can't believe that it's this bad it's just so
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:01.080]  insane but there's this many people that would consciously go along with evil
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:06.840]  Dan in New Mexico you're on the air go ahead yeah thanks for taking my call Mr.
[02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:12.360]  Rawls president talk to you have one simple question for you sort of a high
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:19.640]  just sort of a hypothetical is if you are the president and CEO of Restore Liberty
[02:50:19.640 --> 02:50:26.240]  Inc. given the amount of evidence that exists and especially some new evidence
[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:34.320]  that has come out through a researcher by name of Rebecca Roth why wouldn't you
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:41.280]  make the exposure of 9-11 the cornerstone of the strategy are you
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:48.800]  asking me are you asking our guest that I'm asking the guest okay I have I've
[02:50:48.800 --> 02:50:56.520]  got to say that I don't think that 9-11 was entirely carried out with robotic
[02:50:56.520 --> 02:51:01.000]  aircraft but there's there is substantial evidence that there were
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:06.920]  thermite charges pre-placed in those buildings and I mentioned that just
[02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:10.960]  recently in my blog I try to stay away from some of the more conspiratorial
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:15.080]  aspects because I don't want to run myself in little circles getting
[02:51:15.080 --> 02:51:21.280]  involved in minutiae picture yeah James you're such a wise man because I've
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:24.360]  been I've been supposed to 9-11 since the day it happened just before it
[02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:28.960]  happened we have the Saudis running it we have the NORAD stand down we have the
[02:51:28.960 --> 02:51:33.000]  PNAC documents our government bare minimum aided it it's criminals they're
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:37.480]  aiding Al Qaeda today our military knows but then people call in and we'll bring
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:40.160]  up somebody I don't know who they are they'll say hey why aren't you covering
[02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:44.600]  this aspect there's a giant compendium of people researching it and a lot of them
[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:47.960]  fight with each other and stuff and it just becomes a big tar baby listen
[02:51:47.960 --> 02:51:51.560]  criminals have taken over our government they're harvesting babies organs
[02:51:51.560 --> 02:51:55.400]  they're putting fluoride in the water they want world government they're doing
[02:51:55.400 --> 02:51:59.880]  evil stuff they're aiding radical Islam we've already won that war most people
[02:51:59.880 --> 02:52:03.560]  now our own military is coming out saying our government runs Al Qaeda and
[02:52:03.560 --> 02:52:10.140]  ISIS so get the word out on that I mean I you just don't win the argument get
[02:52:10.140 --> 02:52:13.040]  into thermite charges even though that's true and they got the samples you
[02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:16.600]  can see it happening they obviously had somebody working with them inside you
[02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:21.400]  can argue all day who did it the problem is we can't prove it see it's like
[02:52:21.400 --> 02:52:25.400]  we're cops we know we caught the guy with 10 dead bodies in his basement but
[02:52:25.400 --> 02:52:31.320]  he won't talk and so or basically was hit by a car let's say his brain damage so
[02:52:31.320 --> 02:52:34.840]  we know he did it but if we go to the you know prosecutors and stuff and try to
[02:52:34.840 --> 02:52:39.400]  get exactly how he did it will never win the case we just have to show that this
[02:52:39.400 --> 02:52:43.000]  is the main suspect that's our job the public is here to decide what to do
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:48.160]  about this but hands down 9-11 was carried out by the New World Order people
[02:52:48.160 --> 02:52:52.040]  want to say it's our government so then it's projected on firefighters and cops
[02:52:52.040 --> 02:52:56.880]  and military who were compartmentalized no the globalist that have taken over
[02:52:56.880 --> 02:53:01.840]  our government they worked with foreign Islamists as they always do look at
[02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:06.680]  today to carry this out and we need to demand the 28 pages be released God
[02:53:06.680 --> 02:53:11.080]  bless you I appreciate your call I'm going to continue with these callers on
[02:53:11.080 --> 02:53:15.680]  NATO and on Islamic takeover and other stuff but our guests has got to leave
[02:53:15.680 --> 02:53:19.920]  real quick so let's go to Sam real fast and then James the last callers for James
[02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:26.240]  Wesley Rawls go ahead yeah I'll say guys thanks for taking my call I just want
[02:53:26.240 --> 02:53:30.480]  to reiterate something I guess more of a comment than anything else but you know
[02:53:30.480 --> 02:53:33.800]  you always respected Muslims out you know I got to give you credit for that
[02:53:33.800 --> 02:53:39.320]  but just so kind of the general audience realizes that we want to emphasize
[02:53:39.320 --> 02:53:44.040]  that you know this is a war against Islam especially we don't want to be a
[02:53:44.040 --> 02:53:47.720]  Christian versus swamping and I hate that because a lot of times I see people
[02:53:47.720 --> 02:53:51.440]  kind of making it into that because you know that people in the area they've
[02:53:51.440 --> 02:53:56.520]  suffered a lot in the Middle East want to kill and enslave everybody they have
[02:53:56.520 --> 02:54:00.360]  gone in and put the radicals in charge they have killed a lot of good Muslims
[02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:04.320]  there are good Muslims in my experience and I think it's terrible it's happening
[02:54:04.320 --> 02:54:08.400]  but now the West is being targeted so just like I was against the Iraq war and
[02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:13.920]  and attacking Syria I'm now against this globalist destabilization now using
[02:54:13.920 --> 02:54:17.520]  the radical Islamists they're bringing in thank you for the call I want to get
[02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:24.080]  the final comment on that from James Wesley Rawls sure the Islamic threat is
[02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:30.280]  genuine it has in part been manufactured but the thing that we need to keep
[02:54:30.280 --> 02:54:36.480]  in mind is that the the war on Christianity will continue there's
[02:54:36.480 --> 02:54:42.280]  going to be huge numbers of Christian refugees in the coming decades and I
[02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:48.720]  believe that there is actually a need for a new homeland nation for persecuted
[02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:54.600]  Christian and Messianic Jewish refugees who are going to be pushed out of
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:59.720]  countries in huge numbers in the years to come and that's why I decided to write
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:05.120]  my counter caliphate Chronicles series that first novel called land of promise
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:10.400]  describes the establishment of a Christian homeland nation and I also made
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:14.920]  it fictionally a Christian libertarian nation to illustrate a lot of other
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:21.360]  points but I do think that that is needed and we need to pray that God would
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:27.040]  provide a safe haven for persecuted Christians all over the world it's going
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:30.880]  to be needed desperately needed in the years to come powerful points
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:34.200]  survival blog calm can't wait to have you on the new novel comes out James
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:39.040]  Wesley Rawls thank you so much thank you for having me on Alex you bet he's

[02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:24.160]  point of world government now's the time for people to spread the word that
[02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:27.040]  there are people awake there are people involved there are people that know
[02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:30.240]  what's happening I want to salute our listeners and supporters we're trying to
[02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:33.440]  raise a million dollars today sounds like a big number not a big number for

[02:56:57.360 --> 02:57:01.040]  health wise but what to do in an emergency situation we're just gonna be
[02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:04.240]  covering a whole lot of different topics some of the things that are going on
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:08.280]  right now around the world like the typhoons the dust storms in the Middle
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:12.760]  East the soccer ball size hail I mean we're seeing a lot of geoengineering
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:15.960]  things happening and what we're gonna do is we're gonna cover a lot of
[02:57:15.960 --> 02:57:21.120]  solutions and a lot of positive news to slowly I mean the point you make though
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:25.080]  is they've gone from testing all these artificial systems social engineering
[02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:30.120]  open borders bio weapons forced inoculations immigrant flows proxy
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:34.440]  wars to now you can see they're going operational at every point do you agree
[02:57:34.440 --> 02:57:37.760]  that it looks like they've actually decided to launch the beginning of what
[02:57:37.760 --> 02:57:41.720]  becomes world war three I mean why do you think in closing of this hour people
[02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:44.560]  have such a feeling in their gun everybody even people that aren't
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:49.080]  Christians atheists whatever everybody's upset right it's one of the things I just
[02:57:49.080 --> 02:57:53.560]  found out my kids school has been initiating emergency preparedness stuff
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:57.960]  lately and I've got emergency alerts on my phone and through email and I started
[02:57:57.960 --> 02:58:02.360]  looking around and finding out that all across the United States schools are
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:07.640]  being forced to issue these emergency alerts and containment policies and all
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:11.840]  these weird things by September 18th I think it's just it's spreading it's
[02:58:11.840 --> 02:58:16.080]  everywhere people are talking about it they're feeling it and there's just an
[02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:20.680]  unease in it uneasiness that I think I've never been in my life in a
[02:58:20.680 --> 02:58:24.720]  situation that I've felt so much uneasiness but almost at the same time
[02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:28.400]  there's a calmness to it you know I was it well exactly it's like almost as it
[02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:31.320]  gets closer it goes from being upset to being calm you're ready for the fight

[03:00:31.800 --> 03:00:36.680]  it breaks today but Dr. Grip what did you make of the article I know I saw you
[03:00:36.680 --> 03:00:41.960]  reading it earlier ecstasy agent hired to censor xenophobic Facebook post in
[03:00:41.960 --> 03:00:47.600]  Germany the dreaded criminal stasi that rounded up folks for their speech will
[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:51.800]  now be over arresting people that criticize the radical Islamic invasion I
[03:00:51.800 --> 03:00:57.200]  mean this is such a totalitarianism you know I don't really have too much of a
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:01:00.760]  comment on that it just goes right in line with all the other news that you're
[03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:04.220]  seeing every single day the stuff that you just cannot believe is actually
[03:01:04.220 --> 03:01:09.840]  coming out you especially with the harvesting of the organs the political
[03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:14.440]  campaigns the all of the information disinformation that's coming out on the
[03:01:14.440 --> 03:01:18.240]  media so what I've really been doing lately is trying to focus on the
[03:01:18.240 --> 03:01:21.040]  positive things and what people can do and some of the things that are
[03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:25.120]  happening around the world undoubtedly than people up
[03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:28.720]  undoubtedly they're trying to accelerate all this because they know human
[03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:32.480]  consciousness is expanding awareness is expanding right I believe that I mean
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:34.840]  it's like the hundredth monkey phenomenon you know once you get to a
[03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:43.600]  certain point there's so many people that really do feel a positive environment a
[03:01:43.600 --> 03:01:48.480]  positive energy I guess it's almost like the negative the people that are real
[03:01:48.480 --> 03:01:52.920]  negative are going down even further on the negative path and the people that
[03:01:52.920 --> 03:01:56.480]  are like right in the middle depending on who they're hanging out with or
[03:01:56.480 --> 03:02:01.240]  depending on what they're involved with or maybe moving towards the positive but
[03:02:01.240 --> 03:02:05.000]  I can definitely say that you know just from talking to people and kind of
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:09.680]  observing and doing some research about how all this is affecting watching
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:13.320]  different types of videos understanding I mean I've talked to people in the oil
[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:19.200]  and gas industry that would never have even heard of you for example or never
[03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:23.240]  would have believed any type of so-called conspiracy like something might be
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:27.040]  happening with the earth that are high-level executives at oil and gas
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:30.840]  companies I talked to one the other day it was actually talking about survival
[03:02:30.840 --> 03:02:37.320]  blog.com so people are even people that you would never think are getting
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:43.280]  involved in understanding and that consciousness which is rising and rising
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:47.320]  and rising I know about them up I know a bunch of atheists I know folks that are
[03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:51.720]  in the Easter mysticism I know liberals that are coming to me with tears in their
[03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:55.680]  eyes it just happened today and saying it's God in the devil it's good and
[03:02:55.680 --> 03:03:00.920]  evil I can feel it I'm scared what do I do I'm saying don't be scared just just
[03:03:00.920 --> 03:03:04.400]  love God say you want to do the right thing say you're not with a new world
[03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:08.760]  order that's all God wants you to do it I mean it is just choose a side in your
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:12.640]  heart yeah you just have to have faith is so we should tell people that came in
[03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:18.000]  our cancer clinic with four-stage cancer they've lost the hope and they've lost
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:22.920]  the faith because the medical profession with the chemotherapy and
[03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:27.720]  radiation has destroyed their immune system has destroyed their body and
[03:03:27.720 --> 03:03:34.320]  they've lost all hope and they've lost all faith and they've created this fear
[03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:40.080]  within themselves so that's exactly what I tell people is don't fear I mean
[03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:43.000]  just have faith and have hope that everything's gonna be okay what else
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:48.200]  can you do I mean you can prepare you can have some iodine you can have do
[03:03:48.200 --> 03:03:51.240]  some cleansing on your body you know all the different things that we talk
[03:03:51.240 --> 03:03:55.320]  about have a bug out plan you make sure you have access to clean water I mean
[03:03:55.320 --> 03:03:59.080]  the whole the list goes on and on which is great everybody should do that it's
[03:03:59.080 --> 03:04:04.320]  good to know about these things because if you don't know about us like how God
[03:04:04.320 --> 03:04:08.120]  warned Noah before the flood you know we're being we know this is what we've
[03:04:08.120 --> 03:04:14.200]  devoted our lives to do is to tell people the truth warn people and let them
[03:04:14.200 --> 03:04:18.560]  prepare and give them the things that they need to increase their consciousness
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:22.440]  I mean that's that's how you can create change by increasing consciousness and
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:27.640]  may and bringing that awareness back out and giving people the hope that they
[03:04:27.640 --> 03:04:32.120]  can survive exactly that is so important I'm not here just to scare people the
[03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:34.960]  floods already coming down the valley the dam already broke I'm just saying get
[03:04:34.960 --> 03:04:40.480]  to high ground and that's the good news is we've got time to get ready I wanted
[03:04:40.480 --> 03:04:43.120]  to stop this whole thing from happening but if you live in other countries I
[03:04:43.120 --> 03:04:47.160]  mean all Hades is already broken loose we're gonna come back hit some news
[03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:51.040]  articles we haven't hit and then we're gonna go to your phone calls Dion AD

[03:05:01.360 --> 03:05:04.920]  migrant crisis is going to affect Europe in America a decade from now if
[03:05:04.920 --> 03:05:07.960]  governments keep handing out welfare while Sweden has been accepting a lot
[03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:12.080]  of immigrants for the past 15 years and now 58% of the country's welfare payments
[03:05:12.080 --> 03:05:15.760]  go to migrants the majority of violent crimes in Sweden are committed by first
[03:05:15.760 --> 03:05:19.560]  or second-generation immigrants most of them refuse to assimilate into Sweden's
[03:05:19.560 --> 03:05:23.400]  culture even more shocking nearly half the immigrants don't work and now
[03:05:23.400 --> 03:05:27.120]  Sweden has the biggest employment gap in Europe between natives and non-natives
[03:05:27.120 --> 03:05:30.800]  in other words native Swedes are working their butts off to support an immigrant
[03:05:30.800 --> 03:05:34.880]  population who won't work and want to simulate but will steal rape and murder
[03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:38.200]  simply put when the government offers free goodies and welfare to immigrants
[03:05:38.200 --> 03:05:41.360]  the country's only going to attract the worst kinds of people but what's going
[03:05:41.360 --> 03:05:44.680]  on in Sweden is now going to happen in the United States this is the new

[03:08:18.760 --> 03:08:23.520]  one reason we are putting in three different studios when we actually have
[03:08:23.520 --> 03:08:27.160]  three studios in right now that we're dolling one up like this one of the old
[03:08:27.160 --> 03:08:31.920]  TV studio with the radio studio in there studio a b and c is that after you've
[03:08:31.920 --> 03:08:34.240]  been in here four or five hours with these lights even with the best air
[03:08:34.240 --> 03:08:39.840]  conditions around it gets hot and so at three o'clock you guys for two hours you

[03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:47.960]  hosting the show out of studio a the original studio and then of course I
[03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:51.000]  myself and others gonna be coming back hosting throughout the night we've got
[03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:54.520]  special documentaries that are going to be premiering and more we're gonna have
[03:08:54.520 --> 03:09:00.960]  mystery science theater with jacari jackson leon macadoo david night and
[03:09:00.960 --> 03:09:06.800]  others from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. and then I'll be back with Larry Nichols for an
[03:09:06.800 --> 03:09:12.440]  hour of them are gonna premiere the new Clinton Chronicles 2015 very powerful

[03:09:17.200 --> 03:09:23.160]  Biggs and Darren McBreen and Larry pink me we've got Joe Biggs Ryan Smith and

[03:09:42.120 --> 03:09:45.800]  premier demonic possession of the Vatican exposed I want to get into some
[03:09:45.800 --> 03:09:51.640]  other news stories and phone calls with Dr. Group right now but first the reason
[03:09:51.640 --> 03:09:54.880]  we're doing 28 hours is to produce a whole lot of other media and gas
[03:09:54.880 --> 03:10:00.560]  exposing what's happening and to also sell high quality products that help
[03:10:00.560 --> 03:10:08.440]  fund this organization and give people and chance to donate a local PBS station
[03:10:08.440 --> 03:10:13.000]  for radio on average like Austin I know they cost about six seven million
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:17.200]  dollars a year for them to run that that's radio with about 10 employees we've
[03:10:17.200 --> 03:10:23.240]  got about 45 employees five or six contractors 50 plus people to pay the
[03:10:23.240 --> 03:10:28.360]  infrastructure the bandwidth the satellites all of it it's close to
[03:10:28.360 --> 03:10:33.080]  15 million dollars a year and that sounds like a lot of money to somebody
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:41.360]  that's not media that's not that's the cost of three NPR stations in a city so
[03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:47.440]  we're covering 150 plus big cities hundreds of small towns over 170 AM and
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:52.280]  FM affiliates we reach 1.6 billion people overall in the social media every
[03:10:52.280 --> 03:10:57.440]  year we reach half a billion every year conservatively on YouTube we reach a
[03:10:57.440 --> 03:11:01.680]  million people a day on our own podcast 3 million with terrestrial radio
[03:11:01.680 --> 03:11:05.240]  listeners we have all the numbers we've gone over them and we want to
[03:11:05.240 --> 03:11:09.880]  exponentially grow that now most media is folding right now even with huge
[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:15.480]  audiences because of the recession here depression worldwide we operate out of
[03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:20.800]  Texas that is inexpensive we do a lot of other things but also we're not about
[03:11:20.800 --> 03:11:25.640]  huge profits see big companies want something that's small that makes huge
[03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:31.080]  profits they don't want something that is really big but doesn't generate big
[03:11:31.080 --> 03:11:36.600]  profits you see so we are mission oriented nothing wrong with profits but
[03:11:36.600 --> 03:11:40.800]  we fund ourselves with high quality products competitively in the open
[03:11:40.800 --> 03:11:45.900]  market so we're not beholden to our sponsors and by beholden they can't
[03:11:45.900 --> 03:11:49.440]  control what we say or do about 30% of what we do is funded by sponsors those
[03:11:49.440 --> 03:11:53.320]  are sponsors we handpicked that we agree with and usually I end up just
[03:11:53.320 --> 03:11:57.480]  promoting and selling whatever product I have myself if they're a good long-term
[03:11:57.480 --> 03:12:04.200]  sponsor so if you want water filtration we have 20% off coming up for one hour
[03:12:04.200 --> 03:12:07.920]  only in fact you guys were going to bring in that's that's the one missing

[03:13:57.320 --> 03:14:02.760]  can't find them now that is what is going to really help us $4,000 will pay
[03:14:02.760 --> 03:14:07.200]  for basically or almost half a month of closed captioning quite frankly I'm all
[03:14:07.200 --> 03:14:12.880]  for handicap folks I'm all for the you know hearing impaired or whatever I'm
[03:14:12.880 --> 03:14:17.480]  half deaf in one ear I'll probably need it someday but what if you're a small
[03:14:17.480 --> 03:14:22.760]  media organization that doesn't have $120,000 that's the cheapest for five
[03:14:22.760 --> 03:14:27.880]  hours a day of closed captioning that we have to do to be on TV satellites that's
[03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:31.720]  federal law that's how they use the Americans with Disabilities Act to
[03:14:31.720 --> 03:14:37.640]  bankrupt people so we're trying to get on television in a kosher way to reach
[03:14:37.640 --> 03:14:41.840]  people that's a hundred and twenty thousand smackers on the barrel head in a
[03:14:41.840 --> 03:14:49.920]  year-long contract that's signed you have the satellite in $400,000 for five
[03:14:49.920 --> 03:14:53.760]  hours over the next year and let's just start adding everything else up that's
[03:14:53.760 --> 03:14:57.640]  why a million dollars is not a lot of money the globalist have the money
[03:14:57.640 --> 03:15:01.640]  that's why they've been able to enslave us that's why I'm making an attempt and
[03:15:01.640 --> 03:15:05.440]  everything else we've been doing is successful praise God to try to go to
[03:15:05.440 --> 03:15:09.720]  that next level and beam down to North America and when it's successful and I
[03:15:09.720 --> 03:15:13.200]  believe it will be thanks to your support your prayers all the rest of it
[03:15:13.200 --> 03:15:16.680]  then we're going to target Europe then we're going to target Africa we're going
[03:15:16.680 --> 03:15:23.680]  to target the Middle East we're going to target free-to-air Asia you're talking
[03:15:23.680 --> 03:15:27.920]  about a couple million dollars a year to do that and I have committed to do it
[03:15:27.920 --> 03:15:32.440]  even if I have to spend the emergency money in the bank even have to sell my
[03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:36.040]  house when it comes time when this new syndication thing is working and
[03:15:36.040 --> 03:15:42.360]  operating I will expand every amount of backup capital we've got but 100% of the
[03:15:42.360 --> 03:15:47.680]  capital that that comes into this money bomb will go directly to the radio
[03:15:47.680 --> 03:15:52.480]  slash TV syndication and reaching so many new people and hopefully that'll
[03:15:52.480 --> 03:15:58.200]  have enough profit from the moderate advertising we have to then pay for the
[03:15:58.200 --> 03:16:03.520]  satellites all over the world and so much more so info wars.com forward slash

[03:19:30.160 --> 03:19:34.800]  better than stuff like Viagra that's supposedly evil no they try to shame us

[03:24:04.640 --> 03:24:07.840]  be sitting here in the seat about all these stacks of news some of which we've
[03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:11.840]  covered a lot of which we haven't Dr. Grips our guest and he was just making
[03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:14.560]  the point about you know one of the comments he sees somewhere is look at
[03:24:14.560 --> 03:24:18.640]  Alex Jones he says this company cost over $10 million a year to run info wars
[03:24:18.640 --> 03:24:22.400]  wow and now he wants more money and I've actually talked to some of those folks
[03:24:22.400 --> 03:24:26.280]  in the ground they're not really trolls they have a nine to five job which I'm
[03:24:26.280 --> 03:24:30.320]  not knocking I kind of wish I had one sometimes they understand what a company
[03:24:30.320 --> 03:24:35.920]  grosses is not the profit of the company it's well over $10 million to run it
[03:24:35.920 --> 03:24:43.480]  it's it's it's it's like $400,000 just for the satellite and then close
[03:24:43.480 --> 03:24:48.720]  captioning I mean they just don't understand what we're saying well first
[03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:52.360]  of all it's $10 million that you have gross then you give 40% of that to
[03:24:52.360 --> 03:24:57.800]  the government for taxes so you go down to $4 million under Obama to run it on
[03:24:57.800 --> 03:25:03.080]  that but see it's exactly I'm gonna the tax laws have changed so much I should
[03:25:03.080 --> 03:25:07.600]  hold show on this and have a CPA on or a tax lawyer used to I could buy TV
[03:25:07.600 --> 03:25:11.560]  equipment computers you know a $50,000 switcher which is a cheap one you know
[03:25:11.560 --> 03:25:13.880]  the good ones are like a hundred and fifty thousand so stuff doesn't mess up
[03:25:13.880 --> 03:25:17.680]  the guys are working with you know lower grade stuff because we do it on a little
[03:25:17.680 --> 03:25:22.960]  bit cheaper which is fine but exactly now they don't give you the quote right
[03:25:22.960 --> 03:25:27.360]  off on equipment or studios this is supposedly mine now well it's totally
[03:25:27.360 --> 03:25:33.040]  worthless if it wasn't here if it's not my property but oh it is so I pay taxes
[03:25:33.040 --> 03:25:38.400]  on quote things I have you know or this company has that is just the
[03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:42.520]  infrastructure so yeah exactly they've gotten rid of all the right offs you name
[03:25:42.520 --> 03:25:46.440]  it that's the other thing that's killing us go ahead no that's that's what I was
[03:25:46.440 --> 03:25:50.400]  gonna say you were leading into and what I was talking about at the break is is
[03:25:50.400 --> 03:25:53.320]  people think that you have a multi-million dollar company or you're
[03:25:53.320 --> 03:25:57.080]  your grossed five million in sales but they don't realize that you know for the
[03:25:57.080 --> 03:26:00.320]  government's gonna take 40% of that then you have overhead then you have your
[03:26:00.320 --> 03:26:03.840]  equipment you know then you have your chair which that you can't even write
[03:26:03.840 --> 03:26:06.960]  off charitable contributions exactly let's say you sell $15 million of
[03:26:06.960 --> 03:26:11.600]  supplements it's just a hypothetical number okay you buy them you pay the
[03:26:11.600 --> 03:26:14.760]  insurance do all the stuff ship and deal that all let's say you make profit on
[03:26:14.760 --> 03:26:21.040]  half that so now you've got seven and a half million dollars now you pay 40% of
[03:26:21.040 --> 03:26:23.680]  the government then you pay the state taxes local taxes all the rest of
[03:26:23.680 --> 03:26:27.720]  employee taxes deal with some lawsuits all you all the craziness goes on any
[03:26:27.720 --> 03:26:31.200]  business this is overall getting the word out but it runs as a business and
[03:26:31.200 --> 03:26:36.360]  free market system we're left with like 30% of the money and then that's the
[03:26:36.360 --> 03:26:40.040]  money to get more equipment or hire people or expand I mean it's just crazy
[03:26:40.040 --> 03:26:45.720]  time because that's why there's so many investors usually that want to come into
[03:26:45.720 --> 03:26:49.280]  companies because you get to a point in your growth where you really need you
[03:26:49.280 --> 03:26:54.640]  either struggle when you do it slow and steady wins the race or you you need
[03:26:54.640 --> 03:26:57.840]  outside funding to come in I mean to get to that next point and that's what this
[03:26:57.840 --> 03:27:01.720]  is it's kind of like our shark tank that people want to fight the globalists you
[03:27:01.720 --> 03:27:04.760]  know we'll be there we'll fight for your second amendment we'll fight for your

[03:29:57.600 --> 03:30:03.080]  Kid Daniels info wars.com President Obama has ordered the federal government to
[03:30:03.080 --> 03:30:07.360]  start conducting behavior experiments on US citizens you're at that right the
[03:30:07.360 --> 03:30:10.800]  new executive order commands federal agencies to condition people into doing
[03:30:10.800 --> 03:30:13.960]  whatever the government wants them to do effectively turning we the people into
[03:30:13.960 --> 03:30:17.440]  lab rats running to a maze for a piece of cheese the feds are going to start
[03:30:17.440 --> 03:30:21.800]  hiring so-called behavioral scientists to encourage meaning brainwash people to
[03:30:21.800 --> 03:30:25.560]  say signing up for Obamacare or even turning into their guns at a local gun
[03:30:25.560 --> 03:30:29.480]  buyback program so basically the Obama administration wants to take the freedom
[03:30:29.480 --> 03:30:32.800]  of choice away from the individual and give it to the government that doesn't
[03:30:32.800 --> 03:30:36.280]  sound like freedom now does it freedom is the right of the people to choose how

[03:34:37.280 --> 03:34:42.360]  getting into a new realm of all this news and also tying it into what you guys
[03:34:42.360 --> 03:34:46.960]  were talking about before one of the things that i want to talk about is the
[03:34:46.960 --> 03:34:51.920]  ways in which we are consuming media and the ways in which we are consuming a
[03:34:51.920 --> 03:34:55.960]  number of different things affecting our ability to think and i think i've really
[03:34:55.960 --> 03:34:59.320]  boiled it down for this program i've been thinking about a lot these past few
[03:34:59.320 --> 03:35:03.000]  days knowing that i had some time on this program to talk about some of the
[03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:07.960]  news some of the issues we can get into why one in five americans are supposed
[03:35:07.960 --> 03:35:11.720]  to suffer male mental illnesses each year and why us adults are dumber than the
[03:35:11.720 --> 03:35:15.760]  average human but i think it really comes down to the consumption the media
[03:35:15.760 --> 03:35:18.480]  consumption and we know most media groups are owned by six different
[03:35:18.480 --> 03:35:21.920]  corporations and as alex was talking about their pumping millions and
[03:35:21.920 --> 03:35:25.520]  millions of dollars into all this that's also why it's centerfold for us to
[03:35:25.520 --> 03:35:30.440]  understand that the money bomb is just really about pushing forward alternative
[03:35:30.440 --> 03:35:34.040]  news real news and fighting those conglomerates because they have billions
[03:35:34.040 --> 03:35:38.320]  upon billions of dollars i want to get into ways that we can kind of hijack our
[03:35:38.320 --> 03:35:42.200]  brain back from those people solutions what the top news you think is that's
[03:35:42.200 --> 03:35:46.000]  important and really what is going on so what do you have on your huge stack over
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:48.600]  there i don't know if we can show his stack it's almost as big as this that we
[03:35:48.600 --> 03:35:52.640]  have like six stacks of news that we need to i have a lot of different things and
[03:35:52.640 --> 03:35:56.480]  it really a lot you know everything always comes back to the amount of
[03:35:56.480 --> 03:36:01.600]  toxins that you're exposed to you know if you have a calcified pineal gland
[03:36:01.600 --> 03:36:05.520]  mentally to i mean is it there's such a thing as toxic information right yeah
[03:36:05.520 --> 03:36:09.280]  we're battling toxic it's all fronts i think we're having the physical war for
[03:36:09.280 --> 03:36:13.080]  our health with monsanto and antibiotics and all the craziness like that we're
[03:36:13.080 --> 03:36:18.560]  having the mental consciousness war we're being bombarded by moguls of media
[03:36:18.560 --> 03:36:22.080]  that just attack and destroy things that are just crushing our brain and then at
[03:36:22.080 --> 03:36:25.680]  the same time we have kind of a social situation right because if we go out and
[03:36:25.680 --> 03:36:28.880]  we talk about these things some our friends and family they say oh you're
[03:36:28.880 --> 03:36:31.520]  crazy whatever they're just horribly negative people that don't want to hear
[03:36:31.520 --> 03:36:34.520]  the truth about things so we're being attacked on all these fronts and i think
[03:36:34.520 --> 03:36:38.680]  that's what shapes kind of this media system well we have more mental illness
[03:36:38.680 --> 03:36:44.320]  now than we've ever had in the history of the world depression anxiety you have
[03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:49.800]  children on psychiatric medications adults on psychiatric medication so much
[03:36:49.800 --> 03:36:54.720]  psychiatric medication in the water supply even that if you're in Europe and
[03:36:54.720 --> 03:36:59.920]  you drink a gallon of water in one day it's the equivalent of one Prozac so all
[03:36:59.920 --> 03:37:06.480]  of those things people are exposed to and it does it's it's negative it's it's
[03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:10.800]  the fear a lot of that is generated through media i mean pick up any
[03:37:10.800 --> 03:37:15.600]  newspaper watch any tv show any movie i mean look at the movies that are out
[03:37:15.600 --> 03:37:21.360]  zombie movies it's all killing it's all negative negative negative i mean you
[03:37:21.360 --> 03:37:26.120]  really have to almost live in a bubble to not be exposed to negative media
[03:37:26.120 --> 03:37:31.040]  somewhere and now i mean documents are are becoming unclassified that date
[03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:35.280]  back to the 1960s talking about psychological warfare you have a harp
[03:37:35.280 --> 03:37:42.280]  they opened up military bases and we're testing even in the 1970s on different
[03:37:42.280 --> 03:37:46.880]  types of sound technology that they can make you happy they can make you sad they
[03:37:46.880 --> 03:37:52.800]  can make you angry all of these you know really kind of comes back to the mind you
[03:37:52.800 --> 03:37:57.360]  know can't how can you control your mind or are you even able to control your
[03:37:57.360 --> 03:38:00.080]  mind that's a good point too because most people i think don't even know how
[03:38:00.080 --> 03:38:03.400]  their mind works let alone how their body works they don't know anything you
[03:38:03.400 --> 03:38:06.760]  know and fortunately and according to these these articles u.s. adults are
[03:38:06.760 --> 03:38:09.720]  dumb in the average human now that said i believe everyone has the intrinsic
[03:38:09.720 --> 03:38:13.080]  ability and intelligence to really wake themselves up and do whatever it is they
[03:38:13.080 --> 03:38:16.160]  want in their life but at the at the basic levels someone does know how to
[03:38:16.160 --> 03:38:18.760]  control your brain the corporations want to control your brain that advertised
[03:38:18.760 --> 03:38:22.920]  to you you know your brain is being controlled and it reminds me of yesterday
[03:38:22.920 --> 03:38:29.280]  i was in a lobby and there was a TV on and on the television it was like a
[03:38:29.280 --> 03:38:33.920]  shooting and then they showed war and famine and it was a bank robbery where
[03:38:33.920 --> 03:38:37.360]  someone was being shot outside the bank and then there was forest fires and
[03:38:37.360 --> 03:38:42.960]  floods and all these things and it was all just pure fear and you know we say
[03:38:42.960 --> 03:38:46.480]  oh will you cover things that are bad you're promoting fear there's a
[03:38:46.480 --> 03:38:50.040]  difference between showing oh we're all you know war is great we all need this
[03:38:50.040 --> 03:38:55.320]  evil in this world versus hey how about the fact that this article talks about
[03:38:55.320 --> 03:38:59.800]  agencies say they need access to americans emails without a warrant it's not
[03:38:59.800 --> 03:39:03.200]  being negative if let's say you had cancer it's not being negative to say
[03:39:03.200 --> 03:39:05.960]  hey you have cancer you need some treatment for that you need to fix that
[03:39:05.960 --> 03:39:09.680]  you need to do something about it this is cancer agency spying on your emails
[03:39:09.680 --> 03:39:12.680]  without a warrant doing whatever they want that's cancer this country has cancer
[03:39:12.680 --> 03:39:16.200]  to highlight that is actually being positive it's actually doing something
[03:39:16.200 --> 03:39:21.520]  it's actually a solution that is true positivity to help people to awaken up
[03:39:21.520 --> 03:39:24.880]  to that reality let's get someone into some of the news that you have over there
[03:39:24.880 --> 03:39:29.760]  as well well you touched on it one of mine was is 25 fast food change ranked on
[03:39:29.760 --> 03:39:34.080]  antibiotics use and the reason I bring this up is because I mean what is the
[03:39:34.080 --> 03:39:38.560]  there's so many people coming down with infections these days I mean it seems
[03:39:38.560 --> 03:39:41.720]  like somebody calls you know I have a hundred people call my office every
[03:39:41.720 --> 03:39:46.000]  single day saying is there's some natural alternative to antibiotics I was on
[03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:51.680]  antibiotics for this it is the honest truth and that most doctors when you go
[03:39:51.680 --> 03:39:55.800]  to the hospital no matter what you have you will leave the hospital with a
[03:39:55.800 --> 03:40:00.120]  prescription for antibiotics and what's happening is all these antibiotics are
[03:40:00.120 --> 03:40:04.920]  not only used for humans but they're also used for all the animals like 80
[03:40:04.920 --> 03:40:09.480]  percent going to 80% of the you know all the chicken feed is mixed in the
[03:40:09.480 --> 03:40:14.640]  livestock the pigs you know unless of course you eat antibiotic free which
[03:40:14.640 --> 03:40:21.720]  would in the water and it's exactly so we're developing resistance to these
[03:40:21.720 --> 03:40:28.920]  harmful organisms and so because we use the antibiotics and then that develops
[03:40:28.920 --> 03:40:32.160]  the resistance of the antibiotics since we're just getting antibiotics dumped
[03:40:32.160 --> 03:40:35.280]  into us at all times it loses it loses the potency right it's like if I were to
[03:40:35.280 --> 03:40:37.840]  punch you a little bit in the arm over and over every day for five years you
[03:40:37.840 --> 03:40:40.640]  wouldn't even realize I was punching you anymore well that's the thing it's
[03:40:40.640 --> 03:40:45.640]  usually the unseen things that affect you the CDC said more than two million
[03:40:45.640 --> 03:40:49.960]  people in the US get infections every year that are resistant to antibiotics
[03:40:49.960 --> 03:40:55.040]  and around 23,000 people die from these infections nobody knows about that I
[03:40:55.040 --> 03:41:00.400]  mean just think 23,000 soldiers die over there it's a big deal but all of this
[03:41:00.400 --> 03:41:05.520]  is covered up by the medical profession and the use of antibiotics and foods is
[03:41:05.520 --> 03:41:10.360]  what this article is about I mean it's again it's letting the people know out
[03:41:10.360 --> 03:41:15.900]  there what they need to avoid so they can keep their bodies healthy in this
[03:41:15.900 --> 03:41:20.240]  report there was only two fast food chains they got an A plus rating and
[03:41:20.240 --> 03:41:27.640]  that was Panera and Chipotle there was Chick-fil-A got a B rating McDonald's
[03:41:27.640 --> 03:41:31.680]  and Dunkin Donuts were C well they all loaded up you know at least Chipotle
[03:41:31.680 --> 03:41:35.240]  attempts to go GMF free he brought up an interesting point though in terms of the
[03:41:35.240 --> 03:41:40.560]  casualties if we were go to war and 50,000 people died from something it
[03:41:40.560 --> 03:41:43.680]  would be a big deal or if there was a terrorist attack and 50,000 people died
[03:41:43.680 --> 03:41:47.760]  from something it's a big deal we would probably go to war with another country
[03:41:47.760 --> 03:41:51.440]  if they launched a terrorist attack in the United States and killed 50,000
[03:41:51.440 --> 03:41:55.440]  people we would go to war with that nation but here we are with the
[03:41:55.440 --> 03:41:59.080]  individuals in the United States pushing this kind of stuff on us whether it's
[03:41:59.080 --> 03:42:03.400]  the GMOs or whatever it is really ultimately killing us millions and
[03:42:03.400 --> 03:42:07.680]  millions of people and we're not doing anything yet we have a war on drugs we
[03:42:07.680 --> 03:42:11.760]  have a war on drugs and cocaine and heroin combined doesn't kill nearly as
[03:42:11.760 --> 03:42:16.600]  many as as legal painkillers so you really have to wonder where the focus
[03:42:16.600 --> 03:42:20.600]  is it's obviously in the wrong places and what a war on drugs has not been
[03:42:20.600 --> 03:42:26.320]  successful and it's gotten worse because that's a money generating scenario for
[03:42:26.320 --> 03:42:29.760]  the government anyway and the pharmaceutical companies so it's just
[03:42:29.760 --> 03:42:33.760]  like legal speed when you have your Adderall and it's an amphetamine Adderall
[03:42:33.760 --> 03:42:40.560]  is a pure amphetamine exactly so it's just legal drugs is what it is so again
[03:42:40.560 --> 03:42:48.880]  if you create disease create conditions if you look at let's say some of the new
[03:42:48.880 --> 03:42:53.400]  procedures and medications being created it's all going towards mental illness
[03:42:53.400 --> 03:42:59.160]  because it's the there's no diagnostic testing for that you know there's no X
[03:42:59.160 --> 03:43:03.200]  rays there there's no CT scans or PET scans or anything or blood work that
[03:43:03.200 --> 03:43:08.760]  can say okay you have depression basically they say it's a chemical
[03:43:08.760 --> 03:43:14.440]  imbalance in the brain but we all know that that's the easiest way for them to
[03:43:14.440 --> 03:43:20.680]  prescribe medications to pregnant women to children at an early age to get them
[03:43:20.680 --> 03:43:26.040]  on some sort of medication for life you know I want to talk about that too I
[03:43:26.040 --> 03:43:28.920]  want to get to some calls here in a minute as well for you on a number of
[03:43:28.920 --> 03:43:32.840]  different subjects but overall talk about depression and I look at the call
[03:43:32.840 --> 03:43:35.560]  board right now and I see a number of people talking about how depressed they
[03:43:35.560 --> 03:43:38.920]  are and talking about how upset they are with things in the state of the world
[03:43:38.920 --> 03:43:42.000]  which I totally understand I feel you in many different ways and I've been there
[03:43:42.000 --> 03:43:45.640]  I felt like that before and I think there are four different factors right now
[03:43:45.640 --> 03:43:49.640]  they're affecting us in a serious way I want to get into either now or later in
[03:43:49.640 --> 03:43:53.880]  the program I also want to get to this other news here as well but if you think
[03:43:53.880 --> 03:43:57.480]  about it how many people are depressed if you think about that right now how
[03:43:57.480 --> 03:44:00.960]  many people are so upset and depressed and they feel powerless they feel like
[03:44:00.960 --> 03:44:04.800]  they can't do anything right well we're here to change that number one but
[03:44:04.800 --> 03:44:08.640]  secondarily it comes down to about four different things that I found out number
[03:44:08.640 --> 03:44:12.960]  one it is your consumption of media how many people out there as we talked about
[03:44:12.960 --> 03:44:16.080]  earlier are watching the actual nightly news not the infowars nightly news the
[03:44:16.080 --> 03:44:19.860]  nightly news watching the shootings the war the attacks the debates the
[03:44:19.860 --> 03:44:23.600]  presidential you know garbage it's all there's all thrown out in our face and
[03:44:23.600 --> 03:44:26.920]  we're felt to be powerless we're told we're powerless we're told we can't do
[03:44:26.920 --> 03:44:31.600]  anything that's total lie that's a total total lie and the second thing is though
[03:44:31.600 --> 03:44:35.480]  our health consumption which is what we're talking about obviously these
[03:44:35.480 --> 03:44:38.320]  corporations that are destroying our health have deep roots in the government
[03:44:38.320 --> 03:44:42.760]  here's an article EU panel panel rejects bid to stop Monsanto weed killer sales
[03:44:42.760 --> 03:44:46.240]  of the herbicide which contained in 750 products must stop in December so what
[03:44:46.240 --> 03:44:49.400]  happened is the EU was actually going to block glyphosate and roundup because
[03:44:49.400 --> 03:44:53.240]  it's been known linked to cancer but of course they blocked that out and that's
[03:44:53.240 --> 03:44:57.440]  the number two way that all of us feel so powerless and helpless and here comes
[03:44:57.440 --> 03:45:01.520]  Alex in the studio interrupt away come on in
[03:45:01.520 --> 03:45:13.760]  yeah we're going to Alex is in here live right now on Facebook mentions you can
[03:45:13.760 --> 03:45:20.760]  find him on Facebook at Alex Jones and watch this live is given a tour of the
[03:45:20.760 --> 03:45:24.560]  office anyway so we're back to the news and everything like that but you should
[03:45:24.560 --> 03:45:28.000]  actually look up Alex Jones on Facebook and follow him he does live streams
[03:45:28.000 --> 03:45:31.240]  every now and then on Facebook mentions where he's just hanging out and it could
[03:45:31.240 --> 03:45:34.080]  be up to about an hour long sometimes just hiking on a trail it's pretty cool
[03:45:34.080 --> 03:45:37.800]  stuff it's amazing which actually reminds me of the first point to because
[03:45:37.800 --> 03:45:42.680]  live streaming is defeating media twitch.tv which is a website where mostly
[03:45:42.680 --> 03:45:47.840]  people play video games gets one channel can get 56 million views of someone
[03:45:47.840 --> 03:45:52.000]  sitting there playing halo in their boxers all day from doing nothing and
[03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:56.520]  they can make 60 grand a month isn't that amazing it the mainstream media and
[03:45:56.520 --> 03:45:59.720]  the television based media systems of the old media are dying that's why
[03:45:59.720 --> 03:46:03.880]  info is now that's why Alex wants to crash through the lies on television and
[03:46:03.880 --> 03:46:06.880]  start the new media system because everyone is so tired of it that they're
[03:46:06.880 --> 03:46:09.600]  looking for alternatives they're looking into apps like periscope or you live
[03:46:09.600 --> 03:46:15.400]  stream Facebook mentions twitch.tv all of the true actual live streaming stuff
[03:46:15.400 --> 03:46:19.360]  because reality TV is dying they know that too I mean don't you just see this
[03:46:19.360 --> 03:46:23.800]  collapse doctor group? Well it's just demand I mean people want I think people
[03:46:23.800 --> 03:46:27.560]  are waking up they're kind of sick of seeing what's going on they're sick of
[03:46:27.560 --> 03:46:32.160]  they realize they've seen their parents die because they died of a disease and
[03:46:32.160 --> 03:46:35.840]  they had to take care of their parents and they never got any better on
[03:46:35.840 --> 03:46:41.000]  medications they're starting to see the lies that are being told through
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:47.480]  mainstream media so the internet to me has done tremendous things as far as
[03:46:47.480 --> 03:46:52.040]  getting the information out there and and waking people up and it's really
[03:46:52.040 --> 03:47:00.320]  based on consumer demand I mean look at how natural health organic foods look
[03:47:00.320 --> 03:47:05.960]  at how that has grown exponentially in the last 10 years I can remember 15
[03:47:05.960 --> 03:47:10.120]  years ago when you could stop 20 people on the street and ask them you know any
[03:47:10.120 --> 03:47:13.960]  question about natural health and they didn't even pretty much know what it
[03:47:13.960 --> 03:47:19.360]  is what alternative medicine was and now everybody has a vitamin in their home
[03:47:19.360 --> 03:47:24.080]  some form or another whether it's a Flintstone vitamin from you know the
[03:47:24.080 --> 03:47:29.200]  drugstore or whatever but people are becoming more educated about it and
[03:47:29.200 --> 03:47:35.840]  exactly what you're saying is people like that live interaction they like to
[03:47:35.840 --> 03:47:39.520]  see what you're doing there there's a fakeness you know what I mean there's
[03:47:39.520 --> 03:47:43.240]  a fakeness to mainstream TV when they just sit up there you know you can
[03:47:43.240 --> 03:47:48.520]  almost see him reading off a teleprompter and everybody's so you know
[03:47:48.520 --> 03:47:53.040]  prim and proper and everything and it's just I think people can see through
[03:47:53.040 --> 03:47:56.440]  that people like when you make a little mistake to like sometimes since this is
[03:47:56.440 --> 03:47:59.680]  teleprompter free I'll be reading an article mess up a little bit that just
[03:47:59.680 --> 03:48:02.800]  shows this is real and it's funny because it's just like live somebody sent me an
[03:48:02.800 --> 03:48:06.080]  email the other day last time I hosted the show and they said you do a really
[03:48:06.080 --> 03:48:08.800]  good job you know I can't even tell when you're reading a teleprompter and when
[03:48:08.800 --> 03:48:14.280]  you're not you guys realize there's no teleprompter in here I'm actually
[03:48:14.280 --> 03:48:17.080]  totally insane because I don't even come on here with notes most of the time I
[03:48:17.080 --> 03:48:20.520]  just cover whatever is the hottest news and whatever is going on but let's take
[03:48:20.520 --> 03:48:25.720]  a couple calls before we go to break let's talk to Dion I believe I can read
[03:48:25.720 --> 03:48:30.360]  his name from Illinois he wants to talk to Dr. Group what's going on Dion yeah
[03:48:30.360 --> 03:48:36.400]  I have a question for Dr. Group what alternative lifestyle choices and diet
[03:48:36.400 --> 03:48:42.520]  changes can we make for a heart enlargement and chronic depression well
[03:48:42.520 --> 03:48:47.880]  Dion thanks for the call chronic depression you know it's it's it's really
[03:48:47.880 --> 03:48:53.560]  kind of simple first you obviously want to figure out what the cause is of your
[03:48:53.560 --> 03:48:58.280]  chronic depression but with doing a massive amount of liver cleansing and
[03:48:58.280 --> 03:49:03.960]  intestinal cleansing and just cleansing your body it's especially dating back
[03:49:03.960 --> 03:49:06.960]  in traditional Chinese medicine you know cleansing the liver works really
[03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:12.960]  really good for depression also the iodine as well and drinking more water
[03:49:12.960 --> 03:49:17.800]  believe it or not and looking at some of the things you can do for happiness in
[03:49:17.800 --> 03:49:22.200]  your life when we were seeing patients with cancer they would come in and one
[03:49:22.200 --> 03:49:26.040]  of the first questions I would ask them is what are you doing for fun and what
[03:49:26.040 --> 03:49:30.520]  makes you happy that goes back to that hope and that lack of feet in that fear
[03:49:30.520 --> 03:49:37.000]  that's generated from the from the medical community so taking walks in
[03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:42.520]  nature exercise drinking more water eating organic foods and you know an
[03:49:42.520 --> 03:49:47.440]  enlarged heart believe it or not usually is also con is associated with a
[03:49:47.440 --> 03:49:54.160]  congested liver now strangely enough an enlarged heart can also be a problem
[03:49:54.160 --> 03:49:59.480]  with harmful organisms or parasites in your body and there's no accurate
[03:49:59.480 --> 03:50:04.280]  testing in the medical profession for a lot of different things and that's why
[03:50:04.280 --> 03:50:09.240]  there's so many misdiagnosis is out there you know especially with the
[03:50:09.240 --> 03:50:13.720]  autoimmune diseases with let's say an enlarged heart it's really hard to
[03:50:13.720 --> 03:50:20.040]  pinpoint that's why I believe that everybody has a self-healing mechanism
[03:50:20.040 --> 03:50:27.080]  and you have the ability to heal yourself and just like for thousands of
[03:50:27.080 --> 03:50:32.040]  years cultures have implemented strategic cleansing programs and once you
[03:50:32.040 --> 03:50:36.200]  clean your body you reactivate your body's self-healing mechanism and your
[03:50:36.200 --> 03:50:40.240]  body begins to heal itself and not only heal itself physically but also
[03:50:40.240 --> 03:50:43.440]  mentally absolutely right I want to ask you on to what's his passion what's in
[03:50:43.440 --> 03:50:46.920]  his life what does he do for fun I think that's also key you're listening to the

[03:55:32.280 --> 03:55:35.920]  says he wants to talk about some health stuff what's going on Chris. Hey good
[03:55:35.920 --> 03:55:39.480]  afternoon guys thanks for taking my call I'm really glad you guys are on today I
[03:55:39.480 --> 03:55:43.560]  see it as a blessing from God because pertaining to my wife I got some bad
[03:55:43.560 --> 03:55:50.320]  news of a call today she was diagnosed last year with GBM stage one they gave
[03:55:50.320 --> 03:55:54.240]  her some chemo and some stuff to control the seizures that directly resulted from
[03:55:54.240 --> 03:55:58.840]  that well she got a call from the doctor today in Tennessee a specialist and
[03:55:58.840 --> 03:56:03.480]  based on all the tests and everything he got from the various doctors we've seen
[03:56:03.480 --> 03:56:07.400]  specialists they think that the scar tissue on the back of her brain is
[03:56:07.400 --> 03:56:11.840]  actually spreading and penetrating her brain and I'm just grasping at
[03:56:11.840 --> 03:56:17.680]  straws to see how and if there's any way we can prolong her life or even
[03:56:17.680 --> 03:56:21.160]  possibly reverse the scar tissue issue. Well you know I'm gonna go ahead and say
[03:56:21.160 --> 03:56:24.080]  first and foremost that we're not giving medical advice on this show and you
[03:56:24.080 --> 03:56:26.840]  should always consult with your physician and I think it's always
[03:56:26.840 --> 03:56:29.520]  important to research and do your own stuff when it comes to health but always
[03:56:29.520 --> 03:56:32.640]  consult with your physician really a health care provider even if it's a
[03:56:32.640 --> 03:56:35.960]  naturopathic doctor but Dr. Group what do you have to say about that? Well I mean
[03:56:35.960 --> 03:56:41.200]  not knowing too much about your wife and going into detail what we used to use
[03:56:41.200 --> 03:56:45.320]  that worked really good and what I've used in the past for scar tissue is MSM
[03:56:45.320 --> 03:56:50.480]  which is methyl siphonal methane of course I agree with Anthony that you
[03:56:50.480 --> 03:56:55.040]  should probably find a good natural health practitioner in your area maybe
[03:56:55.040 --> 03:57:00.760]  somebody that can do some ozone therapy as well DMSO is something that we've
[03:57:00.760 --> 03:57:05.840]  used to work with scar tissue high levels of enzymes like a really good enzyme
[03:57:05.840 --> 03:57:12.600]  formula works fairly effectively as well so really getting back to the basics
[03:57:12.600 --> 03:57:18.080]  and again it's even if you start working on a condition and you're
[03:57:18.080 --> 03:57:22.760]  addressing the symptoms or trying to prevent a progression of some sort of
[03:57:22.760 --> 03:57:28.280]  illness what you really want to look at is trying to identify the root cause of
[03:57:28.280 --> 03:57:34.040]  why that happened to begin with was it aspartame toxicity was it you know
[03:57:34.040 --> 03:57:39.840]  chemicals at work that she was exposed to because no matter what you do you
[03:57:39.840 --> 03:57:42.640]  really want to make sure that it doesn't come back and you want to have a
[03:57:42.640 --> 03:57:46.240]  lifestyle change you want to incorporate more organic foods and you want to
[03:57:46.240 --> 03:57:50.360]  reactivate the self-healing mechanism I know I talk about that all the time but
[03:57:50.360 --> 03:57:56.080]  it was a shocking discovery for me to realize how powerful and to literally see
[03:57:56.080 --> 03:58:00.000]  hundreds of thousands of people working with them cleansing their body
[03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:04.400]  reactivating their body self-healing mechanism avoiding all the chemicals and
[03:58:04.400 --> 03:58:09.720]  toxins in their life how fast the body can heal itself exactly I think so many
[03:58:09.720 --> 03:58:13.680]  people ask hey I'm at this point what can I do for this now you really want to
[03:58:13.680 --> 03:58:16.720]  ask how you got there right I mean if you end up somewhere you want to ask
[03:58:16.720 --> 03:58:19.880]  what road did you take to get to that point all right we're gonna take some
[03:58:19.880 --> 03:58:22.200]  more calls in the next segment unfortunately we have to drop calls
