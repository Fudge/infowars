[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, October 20, 2020.
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.000]  I'm Alex Shownes, your host, and I'm going to take a few days off.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  I'm working seven days a week, just like you said.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  I always know when I hit a wall.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  So now's the time for me to take off a few days.
[00:40.000 --> 00:41.000]  I'll enjoy her.
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.000]  I'll do more than fill in.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  He brings his own great insight, analysis, and amazing calls.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  Yeah, so I was going to be really at the helm and ask everybody to get behind
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  Ellen even more and promote the war room and the other great shows here on
[00:53.000 --> 00:54.000]  Infowars.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  But I am going to be filing reports from the road.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  On one subject to try to get people's attention focused in on him.
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  When I sit here and I look at my five-year-old daughter playing in the
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  backyard right now through the window I'm looking at.
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  It doesn't enrage me how much danger she's in.
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  It gives me determination.
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  But she's in danger.
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  Your children and grandchildren are in danger.
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.000]  We're all in danger.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  Psychotic depopulation is too on record.
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  So they want to get rid of at least 80% of the whole population publicly.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  Other stages down to 500 million, that's 90 plus percent.
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  They are producing admittedly at labs all over the U.S., all over Europe,
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  all over Ukraine, all over Asia, all over Latin America.
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  Super weapons like Boston University admittedly with Fauci and Dazik,
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  all in regular crooks.
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.000]  Psycho, just absolute villains of all time producing weapons that kill 80% of humans.
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  They have humanized minds that have the exact same effect as humans when they're
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  given these pathogens, 80% kill rate on an airborne COVID.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  They created a super variant and they have it there and they tell you it in your face,
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  literally holding a gun to all of our heads.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  So everything else is a diversion.
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  Everything else is a distraction.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  Yes, it's all important that we have footage out of Texas at a directly
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  story time with two, three, four, five-year-old kids with a madness of
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  like a woman telling the children that he is going to have sex with them in the
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  most grotesque fashion.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  We can't even play these clips on air, okay?
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  And they're only going to ramp up.
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.000]  They're assaulting our children.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  They're creating bio weapons.
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  If they can't kill them in the womb, they want to sterilize them afterwards
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.000]  with a transgender cult.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  This is what a satanic assault looks like.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  It looks like, again, our government is completely out of control and lawless,
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  endangering all of themselves as well.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  They're totally compartmentalized.
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  99% of the corporate leaders and government leaders are just go along,
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  get along people that follow orders.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  But it's on record that they have gain of function weapons.
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.000]  They've lied to Congress and I'm just demanding people wake up.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  I'm demanding the establishment wake up because I know most people in the
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  establishment do not want to have hundreds of labs everywhere with stuff
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  that kills 80 to 90% of humans.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  The mousepox they develop kills over 90% of humans.
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  So I am simply sitting here explaining to everybody that these people are the criminals.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  They say Kanye is a criminal for his spot crimes.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  I'm a criminal for questioning things.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.000]  No, we're not criminals.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  We are sane people, challenging the power structure and everybody should take the links now.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  www.TheM4Wars.com for a live show and share it like never before.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  We are the forbidden broadcasts because we are exposing the enemies of humanity.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  I want to salute the hardcore listeners in the earth of the vault.
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  Absolute heart of the worldwide resistance.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  The globalists hate to me because they hate you.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.000]  They hate the fact we're awake.
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  We hate the fact that we're warning people.
[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000]  They hate the fact people are listening.
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  And yes, we are beginning to win politically and culturally.
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  That's why the globalists have said they will start wars or release bio-weapons.
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  And here's the key.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  They release COVID, which is weak compared to what they've got.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  There's a beta test of lockdown to see if you'll submit when they actually launch the real attack.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  So you stay in your houses and die.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  We're in a race against these people before they release it.
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  Two years ago, they said after the first release of COVID, they would then have cyber attacks,
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  bringing out World ID cards and more, and the new currency.
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  After that, they release the next bio-weapon, or they may do it sooner.
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  But they're scripting and all like we're idiots.
[04:20.000 --> 04:21.000]  Like we're fools.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  I don't want to be proven right again.
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000]  I know I'm right.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  These people must be stopped.
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.000]  Where is the FBI?
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  Where is the Justice Department?
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.000]  Where is MI5?
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.000]  Where is Interpol?
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  Where are you, psychotics?
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  These people will kill you and your family.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  They will sit there while you die like the rest of us.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  They will try to forcefully inject you like the rest of us.
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  And you sit there and follow your leftist ideology of anti-free speech, anti-human garbage.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  Everybody's pretending to be part of a new border.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  Including those at the very top of it.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  This is the anti-human agenda and it must be resisted.
[04:50.000 --> 04:56.000]  Remember, there are laboratories all over the world and right in Boston, Massachusetts,
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.000]  where they have just combined all of the different COVID virus.
[05:01.000 --> 05:08.000]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence Info Wars,
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people,
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  not as of America, but the world,
[05:18.000 --> 05:22.000]  to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links,
[05:26.000 --> 05:32.000]  to infowars.com and to also financially support infowars.com at the most critical time on our fight

[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  These people are coming for your birthright.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  They're coming for your First Amendment.
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  They admit once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  I am in your hands and I'm asking of your support now,
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.000]  who have my commitment to never give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  Thank you for all your past support.

[06:04.000 --> 06:09.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Owen Troyer.
[06:09.000 --> 06:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[06:16.000 --> 06:22.000]  In honor of a pleasure, a privilege to be with you here on this Thursday,
[06:22.000 --> 06:28.000]  October 20th, 2022 edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  And I've got all these stacks of news on my desk, all important.
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  I've got a bunch of video clips I want to get to today as well,
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.000]  but I'm sitting listening to Alex open the show thinking,
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  well, what is the biggest story?
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.000]  What do you start off the show with today?
[06:45.000 --> 06:51.000]  With all these huge stories from the killer vaccines getting mandated to children
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  to the voter fraud we're about to experience,
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  election fraud we're about to experience in 19 days in the midterms,
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  and all the political news developing around that.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  Is it the truth?
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  Because you have to understand, and I'm going to make this connection today,
[07:08.000 --> 07:15.000]  abortion and the agenda to stop manmade climate change are actually the same agenda.
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  It's two separate stories or two separate lanes,
[07:20.000 --> 07:26.000]  but the path goes to the same conclusion.
[07:26.000 --> 07:32.000]  And that's population control eugenics on this planet.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  That's what abortion is.
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  That's what manmade climate change is.
[07:38.000 --> 07:44.000]  And unwittingly, Stacey Abrams actually kind of admitted that in the clip where she says,
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  oh, well, if you're suffering from inflation, you know, just kill your kids.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  Well, okay, so when they shut off the energy and then you don't have a job
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  and you don't have any food on the table, just kill yourself.
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  You see, that's the logic, that's the goal.
[07:59.000 --> 08:05.000]  But I'm listening to Alex in that opening segment and it kind of just hit me.
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.000]  All right, let me zoom out from all of the news stories that we'll be covering today.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  Let me just kind of zoom out.
[08:12.000 --> 08:19.000]  This is just a stack of news as far as the continuation of media coverage
[08:19.000 --> 08:24.000]  in regards to the billion-dollar judgment levied against Alex Jones in Info Wars,
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  obviously ridiculous, obviously an abuse of the justice system
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  to hurt your political opposition.
[08:33.000 --> 08:40.000]  But I realized something because the truth is we are winning.
[08:40.000 --> 08:47.000]  Just the analogy would be Info Wars has been the lone man in the arena
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  fighting this fight for decades at point-blank range.
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  Not to say there's not other great people out there that have been telling the truth,
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  anti-establishment resistance.
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  Obviously, there have been great people that have been doing this even longer than Info Wars.
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  But Info Wars has been right there on the front lines, point-blank range,
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  sword and shield in hand, screaming like a banshee against these eugenicist globalists.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  And I don't think anybody would argue that that's not the case.
[09:11.000 --> 09:12.000]  That is the case.
[09:12.000 --> 09:22.000]  And so it's a paradox that we've got six arrows in our back and in our neck,
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  and we've got a dagger in our side, and we've got a sword through our heart,
[09:26.000 --> 09:33.000]  and we're just bleeding out and crawling all over the arena, can barely even stand.
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  And so they say, look, Info Wars is dead.
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.000]  Look, we killed Info Wars.
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  But then Alex Jones looks up, and like he said in the first five minutes,
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  all he sees is victory.
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.000]  So yeah, they might have their swords and daggers and arrows in our back and neck and heart and everything else.
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  And maybe we bleed out and die on the battlefield.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  Maybe we survive.
[09:56.000 --> 09:59.000]  Maybe we revive.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  It's all part of God's plan.
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  But why am I saying this? Because as we're barely even struggling to get back to our knees
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.000]  in the Information War on the battlefield in the arena where we've been for decades,
[10:14.000 --> 10:22.000]  now we look up, and though our vision is clouded with dust and blood and sweat,
[10:22.000 --> 10:30.000]  we can kind of see through the haze of it all, hey, we're not alone on this battlefield anymore.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  We look to the right. We look to the left.
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  Other people have swords. Other people have spears.
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  Other people have their shields.
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  Americans are coming to the front lines now.
[10:43.000 --> 10:52.000]  Now, what is my final point that clicked when I heard the first segment there from Alex Jones?
[10:52.000 --> 11:01.000]  The globalists, the deep state, the enemies of America, the enemies of freedom, really.
[11:01.000 --> 11:16.000]  All see this as a major pivotal moment in their desperation, in their power grab for world domination and domination over your body.
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  And even though we have all the momentum on our side, like a tidal wave, it's unstoppable.
[11:22.000 --> 11:33.000]  The human freedom movement worldwide, they see Info Wars or Alex Jones, perhaps more specifically,
[11:33.000 --> 11:43.000]  as their sacrificial lamb, let's say, to kill and have bleed out in front of the public
[11:43.000 --> 11:50.000]  to then hold up and say, if anyone else tries to resist us, this is what's going to happen to you.
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  And that's what this is really all about.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  They know globalism is dead on arrival.
[11:57.000 --> 12:04.000]  They know their new world order, which is the end of self-government, the end of the individual being independent and prosperous.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  That's the new world order now.
[12:06.000 --> 12:13.000]  It's not the new world order that we're used to thinking about or that came about post-World War II.
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  No, it's the new world order of the individual has no rights.
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.000]  The individual has no ability to prosper or have upward mobility.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  That's what people are realizing it's all about.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  That's what people realize the climate change nonsense is all about.
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  The vaccine mandates, the child grooming, it's all the same thing.
[12:35.000 --> 12:45.000]  It's all to create this big, giant corporate government borg that just runs your life from birth to death.
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  That's what it's all about.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  And they know that that's unpopular.
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  They know that that's been exposed.
[12:51.000 --> 13:04.000]  And so now their hope is, as the people are rising up across the planet, is to stab Alex Jones to death
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  and then hold him up in the air like some sort of a trophy to say,
[13:09.000 --> 13:17.000]  if anyone dares stand against us, this will be your fate.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  Same thing they've done to Donald Trump and his associates.
[13:21.000 --> 13:28.000]  Same thing they're trying to do to yay right now.
[13:28.000 --> 13:39.000]  So I understand the pessimism at times. I understand why people feel hopeless.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  I understand when you see all of this going on and the nonsense and the madness every day,
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  you just say, how can this be? How can we recover from this?
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  But no, folks, we really are having victories.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  Human freedom is going to win in the end.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  It's going to be a hell of a fight. It's going to be a hell of a battle.
[13:59.000 --> 14:06.000]  It might take years, decades, who knows, hopefully not, but even centuries.
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  But human freedom will prevail.
[14:10.000 --> 14:20.000]  And so the Satanic, Luciferian death cult that runs this planet has to give you the example of Alex Jones
[14:20.000 --> 14:27.000]  or Donald Trump or Kanye West to say this is what happens to you if you stand against us.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  You will be destroyed. You will be financially bankrupt.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  We will separate you from your family.
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  We will call you all sorts of names like anti-Semite and bigot and racist.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  We will censor you and make sure you can't speak to people.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  We will ruin your life.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  And so they take the big fish, they take the big targets, the Alex Jones, the Donald Trumps,
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  Kanye West, and they say, do you see what we've done to them?
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  We will do it to you.
[14:57.000 --> 15:04.000]  And then the little guy says, oh my, well, if they can do it to Donald Trump, then they can certainly do it to me.
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  If they can do it to Alex Jones, if they can do it to Yay, they can certainly do it to me.
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  Oh, I don't want to fight back now, except that's not what's happening.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  It's the exact opposite.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  Your attacks on Donald Trump have exposed you.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  Your attacks on Infowars and Alex Jones have exposed you.
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  Your attacks on Kanye West have exposed you.
[15:25.000 --> 15:39.000]  And now all you've done is put more cracks in your own dam that is eventually going to completely crumble and bury you.
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  And so what do the globalists have? What do the Satanists have? What is their one last card to pull, hopefully?
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  Nuclear war, World War III.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  At least that's the quickest thing they can pull the trigger on.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  There's other things they could probably do, but it would take longer.
[15:54.000 --> 16:00.000]  But that's where we're at, folks. That's why we're under attack, because we're winning.
[16:00.000 --> 16:06.000]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[16:06.000 --> 16:15.000]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.000]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over.
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.000]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[16:30.000 --> 16:36.000]  That's why when you share articles and videos from band.video or infowars.com or newswars.com, it changes the world.
[16:36.000 --> 16:44.000]  And that's why when you go to infowars.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family,
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[16:48.000 --> 16:54.000]  The fight starts at infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at infowars.com.
[16:54.000 --> 17:00.000]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[17:00.000 --> 17:11.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.000]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.000]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without your support.
[17:30.000 --> 17:38.000]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[17:38.000 --> 17:43.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful infowars has been because of your past support.
[17:43.000 --> 17:52.000]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now to critical juncture of the battle, free double your efforts by visiting infowarsstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[17:52.000 --> 17:59.000]  1776 the promo code, the destination is infowarsstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[17:59.000 --> 18:13.000]  X3, it stands for tri iodine, or all three types of iodine that the body needs to be healthy and survive and thrive.
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  It boosts your libido, your energy, your stamina, your immune system.
[18:17.000 --> 18:27.000]  X3 is the ultimate iodine product on the market. It's back at stock at infowarsstore.com for 50% off and it funds the info war.
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.000]  So many of you are on the fence, you know our information is powerful, you know it's changed the world.
[18:32.000 --> 18:43.000]  Try the products at infowarsstore.com and start with X3 tri iodine, 50% off infowarsstore.com.
[18:43.000 --> 18:51.000]  It takes about two weeks to kick in, an aspirin kicks in in 30 minutes, Tylenol kicks in 30 minutes, this kicks in in about two weeks on average.
[18:51.000 --> 18:59.000]  You need to experience it, don't wait, you'll be impressed, infowarsstore.com, X3.
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.000]  The listeners and viewers who support infowars are the real reason you've had this success.
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[19:32.000 --> 19:41.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[19:45.000 --> 19:55.000]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now, because we are over the target and history is happening.
[19:55.000 --> 20:18.000]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[20:25.000 --> 20:52.000]  Now you notice in this incredible time in human history, some fear evil give in to evil and become the slaves to evil
[20:52.000 --> 21:04.000]  because of their fear that it will strike them down in their own selfish desires, not realizing that giving in to evil is the loss, that is losing, that is death.
[21:04.000 --> 21:11.000]  So you see some people standing with Alex Jones and infowars and Donald Trump and Kanye West and the others out there,
[21:11.000 --> 21:22.000]  but to the ones that refused, to the ones that cave, to the weaklings, we never wanted them on our team anyway, because they were always losers.
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.000]  But not you in the audience and not us here in this crew.
[21:27.000 --> 21:39.000]  Now as Alex is going to be out for at least a week or so, we have a bunch of these clips lined up going back in time showing how ahead of his time Alex was
[21:39.000 --> 21:43.000]  on so many different issues, that's really why they want to silence him.
[21:43.000 --> 21:54.000]  It has nothing to do with what he said about Sandy Hook, it has to do with the fact he has been years and even decades ahead of his time with his news coverage.
[21:54.000 --> 22:02.000]  Here's an example, this is Alex Jones exposing the social credit score in December of 2015.
[22:02.000 --> 22:12.000]  There's a huge awakening happening, there's a giant explosive time here, but at the same time they're also now going to pure lies, pure demonization,
[22:12.000 --> 22:20.000]  saying we run demonstrations, we have nothing to do with, saying we terrorized Austin, had, you know, gun scares going, zero involvement,
[22:20.000 --> 22:34.000]  saying I hate black people, saying I'm a drug dealer, saying I'm a, just you name it, in mainstream news, in concerted efforts, hundreds of articles per day, per day.
[22:34.000 --> 22:42.000]  Matt, I was in over 300 on Monday, Chicago Tribune, Washington Post, I mean Miami Herald, I mean Austin,
[22:42.000 --> 22:51.000]  when I got calls about it, people going, you didn't, you think we had a moon landing, you know, you're not involved with Boston bombing, I mean, folks,
[22:51.000 --> 22:59.000]  you're talking hard course, so in the past they would just kill me, but because of the Info War, that would make me a martyr.
[22:59.000 --> 23:07.000]  Plus like shark teeth, I've got rows of people ready to replace me, okay, and so instead they are murdering who I am right now.
[23:07.000 --> 23:14.000]  They are killing who Alex Jones is, and look, Jesse Ventura has his problems politically, I don't agree with him on quite a bit of things,
[23:14.000 --> 23:22.000]  but he did get politically assassinated, you know, with the whole Chris Kyle thing, they could pull similar things on me.
[23:22.000 --> 23:28.000]  This is all a sign we're having a huge effect, they wouldn't be doing all of this if we weren't hitting the zeitgeist,
[23:28.000 --> 23:35.000]  and Info Wars is growing exponentially right now, so I want to give you kind of the state of the Info Wars Union here,
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  on the success we're having and realize when you tell friends and family to tune in,
[23:39.000 --> 23:46.000]  when you direct them, infowars.com, forward slash show, they can download the podcast, watch the live feeds, you know, whatever.
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  If you're listening on AM and FM stations, tell your friends and family to tune into that.
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.000]  You are the Info Warriors. Now, they're going to strike back a bunch of ways.
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  I'm going to be doing some special reports that go through how they're doing this, but the model, because it's total totalitarianism in China,
[24:01.000 --> 24:08.000]  they admit this in Australia, the US, you name it, the model for internet censorship is going to be phased in Chinese style net censorship,
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.000]  net IDs, net taxes, three strikes and you're out, net rules.
[24:13.000 --> 24:23.000]  But before they get to that, they're going to phase in and it starts this next year, just, you know, ten days or so, or less, I guess nine days, in China.
[24:23.000 --> 24:34.000]  And they're already lining up with Facebook, Google, all of them agreeing with China, Microsoft, to implement these systems where China already does it,
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  and then they beta test there and then bring in here.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  And our stories on drudgereport.com, we do a document cam over here.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  And of course, Drudge gets how incredibly important this is.
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.000]  We've been mentioning this for the last few months, but now it's a critical mass because the Chinese have released the full details.
[24:50.000 --> 25:00.000]  Everything you do, everything you do in China from your credit score to what you buy, to discount cards, to your internet records,
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  to what you say on social networks, is integrated into an algorithm.
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  And if you criticize the government basically once, you can't even buy or sell, you can't go to a hotel, you can't travel.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  Now, notice all this is being phased in here with the IRS saying, if we start auditing you or don't even start an investigation, you can't fly.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  Internal checkpoints, I mean, it's on folks.
[25:20.000 --> 25:25.000]  Europe's doing the same thing. This is all being brought in. It's being implemented.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  I mean, this is classical tyranny. It's here.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  And again, the Supreme Court Justice told Drudge, next year, they're coming for you.
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  And then they have the heads of the FCC, and yeah, we're coming for your free speech, talk radio, internet, you name it.
[25:38.000 --> 25:42.000]  I mean, because they can't beat us, folks. They're flaming tyrants.
[25:42.000 --> 25:50.000]  They're flaming crooks annihilating our country, spying on us illegally, opening our borders, having the Border Patrol complete the smuggling process.
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  I mean, this is the globalist offensive. This is the war against America.
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  And globally, there's a world awakening.
[25:57.000 --> 26:03.000]  So they know in algorithms, and they admit this, that revolutions are coming, just because food prices in the third world have gone up past 50%.
[26:03.000 --> 26:11.000]  They know at that point, riots start. They already have their operators ready to steer the revolutions into radical al-Qaeda, radical ISIS, radical al-Nusra,
[26:11.000 --> 26:17.000]  Saudi Arabian driven. Same thing here. They're going to have a big communist kill the cops, shoot the cops, burn the cities.
[26:17.000 --> 26:23.000]  They're going to let them do it, order the cops to stand down, and then say, cops, it's your fault, capitulate, go under UN control.
[26:23.000 --> 26:30.000]  I mean, it's on, folks. You are witnessing a real coup. 100% what I'm telling you is happening.
[26:30.000 --> 26:38.000]  Now, I knew this was coming, but to see it actually happen is so bold, is so over the top, that I get why people just can't believe it.
[26:38.000 --> 26:48.000]  Now, was that from yesterday or almost seven years ago?
[26:48.000 --> 26:56.000]  No, that was from seven years ago from Alex Jones. Just under seven years ago.
[26:56.000 --> 27:04.000]  But it might as well have been from yesterday. Could have been from yesterday.
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.000]  No, that was seven years ago, Alex Jones, right here on these airwaves.
[27:09.000 --> 27:17.000]  That's why they've marked infos for destruction, folks. We've been telling the truth about everything going on for decades.
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.000]  Doesn't mean we're perfect. Doesn't mean we don't make mistakes.
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.000]  But we are telling it like it is, and that's what they hate.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  They want people to be scared to tell it like it is. They want people to be scared to speak their minds, scared to speak their hearts.
[27:32.000 --> 27:39.000]  And that's what we do here, and that's why we have been set for destruction, and Alex Jones has had a billion-dollar judgment against him.
[27:39.000 --> 27:46.000]  And they all admit it. Yeah, this is about shutting infos down. I've got more news about that coming up on the other side.
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.000]  But folks, we're not shutting down. We're going to stay on air. We're going to fight our way through this.
[27:51.000 --> 28:00.000]  We're in the appeals process of the decisions now, and in the interim there, we should be allowed to operate as you've seen.
[28:00.000 --> 28:07.000]  Now, we've been knee-capped. We've been handicapped. We're bleeding out in many ways, but we're still here on the battlefield.
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  And thanks to your support, we'll continue to fight.
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.000]  And InfowarsStore.com is the key. That's how we take great products.

[32:12.000 --> 32:15.000]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.

[33:26.000 --> 33:51.000]  So the enemies of free speech, freedom and humanity altogether are angry because we're on air today and you're tuned in.
[33:51.000 --> 34:05.000]  And the crew is here and that angers, that angers the American left wing that angers the globalists and the deep state.
[34:05.000 --> 34:14.000]  And they really don't get it. They thought, how could we sue Alex Jones into oblivion and then he's still there and Infowars is still there.
[34:14.000 --> 34:24.000]  How could this be? Well, they don't understand how the world works at all. Generally speaking, that's why they don't understand how Alex Jones is ahead of his time as a talk show host.
[34:24.000 --> 34:33.000]  But this story was in Vox yesterday. Alex Jones lost a billion dollar trial. Why is Infowars still streaming?
[34:33.000 --> 34:45.000]  And of course, they lie about Alex Jones in this story. They lie about Roger Stone in the story. They can defame. They can libel and defame all day long.
[34:45.000 --> 34:54.000]  We're not allowed to question major events though. So they can lie into fame and libel Alex Jones and Roger Stone and anyone else they want.
[34:54.000 --> 35:08.000]  But you can't question events. See how that works? But they say in the story here, their mission is to shut me up and take me off the air quoting Alex Jones.
[35:08.000 --> 35:16.000]  As he told his followers via a video after the verdict, that's not going to happen in the near future and it's possible it may never happen.
[35:16.000 --> 35:25.000]  Oh, there it is. Vox preparing their audience for the worst news. They haven't destroyed Alex Jones.
[35:25.000 --> 35:34.000]  That billion dollar lawsuit you thought would finally silence Alex Jones is not going to work.
[35:34.000 --> 35:42.000]  And they're sad. They're sad about this because that's what it's all about.
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  It was never about the Sandy Hook families. It was not even about what Alex Jones said about Sandy Hook.
[35:47.000 --> 35:53.000]  It was always about getting Alex Jones off the air. That's what it was always about.
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  And that's why we're still on air and so then they write stories like this one you see on the screen.
[35:57.000 --> 36:04.000]  Only proper online regulation can stop poisonous conspiracists like Alex Jones.
[36:04.000 --> 36:14.000]  The billion dollar fine wasn't enough. We need government to crack down on the Internet and silence free speech.
[36:14.000 --> 36:26.000]  Wow, you sound like a fascist. You sound like an authoritarian. You sound like a totalitarian. You sound like a criminal.
[36:26.000 --> 36:33.000]  We must silence that man. Why do you want Alex Jones silence so much because he tells the truth about you?
[36:33.000 --> 36:44.000]  But see, the problem is, and this is just, I mean, we're getting into just the lowest common denominator of dumbass Americans
[36:44.000 --> 36:50.000]  that really believe everything they see on TV, really believe all the mainstream media propaganda.
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.000]  And so they really thought, oh, finally, we've got Alex. Finally, Alex is off the air. Yay, we did it.
[36:55.000 --> 37:01.000]  Billion dollars. Yay, we've destroyed Alex Jones. We've destroyed our own future in free speech, but we got Alex.
[37:01.000 --> 37:10.000]  So it's all good. And then they wake up and Alex is still on air and they say, what? How can this be? I thought we destroyed him.
[37:10.000 --> 37:16.000]  Because they really buy all the BS that they see. They really buy all the propaganda that they see.
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.000]  And I've got other examples of that coming up. But see, okay, what did we say?
[37:21.000 --> 37:27.000]  When they censored Alex Jones off all the big tech platforms, that was going to be the precedent, and then they were going to go after everybody else.
[37:27.000 --> 37:31.000]  That's exactly what's happened over the last five years.
[37:31.000 --> 37:40.000]  So now the legal precedent that they got in the Jones-Sandy Hook case, they're now using that to go after all their other opposition as well.
[37:40.000 --> 37:49.000]  And Kanye West is the latest example. George Floyd family lawyer says he plans to use Alex Jones precedent to sue Yay.
[37:49.000 --> 37:56.000]  Well, what is the Alex Jones precedent? What does he mean? What does that mean, the Alex Jones precedent?
[37:56.000 --> 38:17.000]  That means if there is an individual, in this particular case, in media, a journalist, a reporter, a talk show host, that you don't like, that is your political opposition, you can sue them for saying stuff that you don't like.
[38:17.000 --> 38:36.000]  And the process of that goes as follows. You find a district where you know you'll get a favorable jury, and you find a judge that you know is going to be on your side wearing your jersey and your hat the entire time,
[38:36.000 --> 38:50.000]  so that you actually don't have to go to trial. The whole thing is a kangaroo court, a rigged court where you just get a judgment against you, you don't get a day in court, you don't get to cross-examine,
[38:50.000 --> 38:57.000]  you don't get to present evidence, and you get completely gagged in the process, and then they just say, oh, billion dollar fine, you can't defend yourself.
[38:57.000 --> 39:04.000]  So the lawyers can go up there and lie about you the entire case, and then you can't show the evidence that proves their lying.
[39:04.000 --> 39:10.000]  That's the Alex Jones precedent. That's what the George Floyd family is talking about with Kanye West.
[39:10.000 --> 39:17.000]  Now, I don't know how much money Kanye West has. He claims to be the richest black man in the world, worth billions of dollars.
[39:17.000 --> 39:29.000]  Okay, maybe that's the case. Well, it's funny because Kanye West is getting sued for a quarter billion dollars, that wouldn't even break his bank accounts if you believe he's worth over a billion.
[39:29.000 --> 39:43.000]  But with Alex Jones, they have all the records. They know that InfoWars basically operates at a maximum of like maybe we have $100,000 at any given time in the bank.
[39:43.000 --> 39:49.000]  If we have a million in the bank, then we're looking really good, but normally we're right on the margins.
[39:49.000 --> 39:59.000]  And $100,000 is like what we need to just pay the crew bi-weekly and purchase the products to sell at InfoWarsStore.com. So I mean, that's already budgeted.
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.000]  That money is already budgeted. But then they say, oh, a billion dollars for Alex Jones.
[40:05.000 --> 40:14.000]  And they go up in front of the jury and they say, Alex Jones made $700 million this year, which is not even true.
[40:14.000 --> 40:24.000]  That's over the course of, say, 10 years. And that doesn't include all of the costs of running this operation, paying the crew, building the studios, paying for the bandwidth.
[40:24.000 --> 40:33.000]  You get the point, buying the product. And then we can't go up and show, hey, actually, here's our financial records. Hey, here's our bottom line bank statement.
[40:33.000 --> 40:39.000]  Hey, here's how much money we made. We're not allowed to do that. But that's the Alex Jones precedent.
[40:39.000 --> 40:49.000]  Now, how that's going to apply in practicality to the yay case is yet to be decided.
[40:49.000 --> 40:56.000]  And I think really this one is like half they want to shut Kanye West up, half they just want to take his money.
[40:56.000 --> 41:04.000]  We've seen that Black Lives Matter is really nothing more than a giant money grab, as Kanye West has called it, out as well.
[41:04.000 --> 41:13.000]  But so how is this precedent going to be applied to Kanye? Are they are they just going to say, oh, nope, the judge says you owe him $250 million and then go through the clown circus.
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  And then he has to cut the check.
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  Or how is that one going to go?
[41:19.000 --> 41:25.000]  But they say, oh, and now you've got Fox News is going to have billion dollar lawsuits on their hands.
[41:25.000 --> 41:33.000]  Tucker Carlson is going to get sued. I mean, anybody that says the election was stolen,
[41:33.000 --> 41:39.000]  or anybody says George Floyd didn't die from a knee on his neck or anything of that nature.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  You will now get the Alex Jones precedent.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  And it's sad to see media jumping on this like Howard Stern.
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.000]  Howard Stern blast Kanye West says he's like Hitler.
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.000]  You know, this is Howard Stern who used to do a game on his talk show where he did a countdown.
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  Tell me if this is inappropriate or even pedophilia.
[41:57.000 --> 42:06.000]  Howard Stern would do a countdown where he would find girls that were underage that he found, I guess, sexually attractive.
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  And then he would count down the days till they were 18 so he could legally fornicate with them.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  That's Howard Stern.
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.000]  Now, does Howard Stern have the right to do that?
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  Well, Howard Stern went through his own battles with free speech back in the day when he went on the air as a shock shock.
[42:24.000 --> 42:31.000]  And you know what? People understood that, you know, I might not like what Howard Stern has to say, but he has the right to say it.
[42:31.000 --> 42:40.000]  But now Howard Stern is going the complete opposite and he wants everybody else silenced after he's already been given the green light to say whatever he wants.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  Now he wants everyone else silenced.
[42:42.000 --> 42:51.000]  Ohio Supreme Court suspends Democrat judge due to unprecedented behavior removes her from Cleveland Municipal Court bench and temporarily strips law license.
[42:51.000 --> 42:57.000]  Could that be the future of the judges in the Alex Jones cases? It should be.

[45:12.000 --> 45:31.000]  This family that is info wars. Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the new world order.

[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  And as the process can all be
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.000]  You're asking for a working life, a working man.
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.000]  And I've got my hands together. They're gonna want all of them.
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.000]  You must give me back my bullets.
[47:35.000 --> 47:47.000]  They opened Pandora's box with the billion dollar judgment against Alex Jones. And the question is now
[47:47.000 --> 47:55.000]  Does this go both ways? Of course, we know the answer to that is no, but it's going to be tested in real time.
[47:55.000 --> 48:06.000]  Now again, I want to repeat this headline I said going to break because it's important. This is how we can stop the corruption and the abuse of our judicial system for politics.
[48:06.000 --> 48:16.000]  Ohio Supreme Court suspends Democrat judge due to unprecedented behavior removes her from Cleveland municipal court bench and temporarily strips law license.
[48:16.000 --> 48:26.000]  That needs to happen to the two judges in the Jones Sandy Hook cases 100% absolutely that should happen to them too because what they did was unprecedented behavior.
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  Now will it I don't know time will tell.
[48:31.000 --> 48:38.000]  But there you go it is possible there is precedent as far as that is concerned.
[48:38.000 --> 48:50.000]  But does this go both ways? Russian disinfo huh computer store owner Suze Hunter Biden and Joe Biden campaign for defamation over laptop.
[48:50.000 --> 48:57.000]  Yeah, what about the intelligence officers and the FBI agents that all signed the statement saying that Hunter Biden's laptop was fake and it wasn't real.
[48:57.000 --> 49:04.000]  It was Russian disinformation. They all lied. That was a conscious lie. They all knew it was real.
[49:04.000 --> 49:15.000]  They all knew it was Hunter Biden's laptop. They lied to you. Can we sue them? Can the laptop store owner sue them? Well he has.
[49:15.000 --> 49:22.000]  And we know that they consciously lied. They didn't make a mistake. They lied. They knew that was his laptop.
[49:22.000 --> 49:34.000]  As Massey points out, here's a tweet from Pfizer in January of 2021. Pfizer claimed their mRNA shots could stop transmission of the virus.
[49:34.000 --> 49:40.000]  Now they're admitting their trials were not designed to test that claim, which is it Pfizer. So Pfizer lied.
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.000]  When does a billion dollar lawsuit against Pfizer come down for them lying about the mRNA injections?
[49:45.000 --> 49:55.000]  Let me tell you the lies of Pfizer and the damage from those vaccines. I mean, Alex Jones isn't Alex Jones registers a zero.
[49:55.000 --> 50:04.000]  Alex Jones registers a zero compared to this, which registers what a thousand.
[50:04.000 --> 50:11.000]  So when it comes to let's say getting something wrong or lying and damages, Alex Jones scores a zero.
[50:11.000 --> 50:22.000]  Pfizer scores a 1000. All the people that took the vaccines that they said were safe and effective that have died in the tens of thousands.
[50:22.000 --> 50:32.000]  Their own public statements saying they tested them for transmission and then their own public statements saying they never tested them for transmission.
[50:32.000 --> 50:41.000]  When do the billion dollar lawsuits against Pfizer come down? But you'll find out when I get into the vaccine newsletter that they're actually above the law.
[50:41.000 --> 50:49.000]  They actually are completely immune, no pun intended to any lawsuits against them.
[50:49.000 --> 50:56.000]  But what about all the defamation against Alex Jones or against Donald Trump?
[50:56.000 --> 51:09.000]  You've got thousands of verified Democrats, liberals on Twitter, on TV, everywhere saying that Donald Trump is a rapist today.
[51:09.000 --> 51:21.000]  Saying that he raped a lady, E. Jane Carroll, that he was deposed in that case, not a rape case, a defamation case if you can believe that.
[51:21.000 --> 51:27.000]  So Trump is currently being sued for defamation by E. Jane Carroll who claims Trump raped him.
[51:27.000 --> 51:35.000]  My guess is that's a lie and it should be Trump suing her for defamation. But you're in the upside down world now.
[51:35.000 --> 51:42.000]  I mean, folks, come on. Have you seen the women Trump gets with? I mean, let's be honest, that woman looks like a paper bag.
[51:42.000 --> 52:00.000]  I mean, that's a hack. Now, granted, maybe age has not done her well, but we see the type of women Trump dates and sleeps with and, well, let's just say she ain't it, baby.
[52:00.000 --> 52:18.000]  She ain't it. But oh, she gets to claim Trump raped her. My guess is that's a total lie. And then she gets to defame Donald Trump and then sue him for defamation.
[52:18.000 --> 52:32.000]  You see, it was like chum in the water. It was like chum in the water when they got those massive numbers against Alex Jones, the millions in Texas, the billions in Connecticut.
[52:32.000 --> 52:39.000]  They're not done, by the way, they got more coming. And immediately other lawsuits started getting filed. They were all thrown out there frivolous.
[52:39.000 --> 52:44.000]  We don't really talk about it. I had people bailing me. I got sued a bunch of other times. All frivolous.
[52:44.000 --> 52:51.000]  The judge just throws them right out. It's total BS. But they just see chum in the water. They say, oh, these people got $500 million from Info Wars.
[52:51.000 --> 52:56.000]  These people got $1 billion from Info Wars. Oh, I'm going to get some of that money. I'm going to sue Info Wars. Yeah. Wow.
[52:56.000 --> 53:04.000]  The courts are completely rigged against Alex Jones and Info Wars. I want to get some of that action. So they sue me. They sue Alex. They sue Info Wars.
[53:04.000 --> 53:14.000]  You see, those are just corrupt dirt bags that see the chum in the water, like chum in the water for sharks or something.
[53:14.000 --> 53:22.000]  And they just figured, oh, let's jump on this bandwagon. We can milk Alex Jones for some money, too. But they don't understand that the whole thing was rigged.
[53:22.000 --> 53:30.000]  The whole thing was planned out. They made sure they could get a jury in their favor. They made sure they had the judge in their favor. The whole thing was rigged.
[53:30.000 --> 53:39.000]  So these other people don't realize, no, the case was rigged. You think you just suing Alex or suing Info Wars or suing Owen Schroyer is going to get you millions of dollars?
[53:39.000 --> 53:51.000]  That's not how this works. You have to put in years of groundwork to rig the case. And so then they find out, oh, the lawsuit got tossed by the judge upon seeing it.
[53:51.000 --> 53:58.000]  And they're confused. They say, what? How could this be? They just got $100 million from Jones. They just got $1 billion. I want some of that money.
[53:58.000 --> 54:07.000]  No, they planned the whole thing out. But see, they don't even want us to be able to talk about it. That's another reason why they want Alex Jones off the air.
[54:07.000 --> 54:15.000]  So the other day, though, and this happens all the time, hate hoax, racist texts to black Air Force member were faked.
[54:15.000 --> 54:28.000]  And Air Force member claimed he didn't get a promotion because he was black and he said it was racism. He had no proof. So he fabricated the proof and sent the text to himself saying, see how racist they are after an investigation.
[54:28.000 --> 54:34.000]  It found out he hate hoaxed himself. He just, he small-edded himself.
[54:34.000 --> 54:48.000]  But see, oh, don't even dare question that. Don't even dare question that. You can't question anything. You'll get sued for a billion dollars even though you're right.
[54:48.000 --> 55:01.000]  And there's another ongoing situation. And I'm not saying this fake. In fact, I think it's completely real happening at UC Berkeley where you've got pro-Palestinian students.
[55:01.000 --> 55:08.000]  And I mean, I don't know if many of them are claiming to be Palestinian. They just, they just claim to be pro-Palestinian.
[55:08.000 --> 55:19.000]  And then you have these groups of Jews that are out there protesting for their rights because at UC Berkeley's campus, there are Jew-free zones.
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.000]  Oh, did you hear about that? Oh, did they call UC Berkeley anti-Semitic? Did they call the liberals at UC Berkeley anti-Semitic?
[55:25.000 --> 55:33.000]  No, because see, this is the victimhood pecking order. Palestinians are the biggest victims and then Jews and then blacks, and nobody else gets to talk.
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.000]  And they wanted to put Asian Americans on that list when they thought white people were doing crimes against them.
[55:38.000 --> 55:45.000]  Then they found out it was black people doing crimes against them. And so black people are higher on the totem pole of victimhood than Asian Americans.
[55:45.000 --> 55:53.000]  So that got silenced real quick. So no, there's actually real, there's real stuff going on at UC Berkeley's campus.
[55:53.000 --> 56:00.000]  There's real people that hate Jewish people. I mean, you want to actually find anti-Semites. You want to actually find people that hate Jewish people.
[56:00.000 --> 56:09.000]  It's not Kanye West. It's liberals and Democrats at UC Berkeley's campus. And so there's videos coming out every day.
[56:09.000 --> 56:15.000]  Well, you'll just have groups of Jewish people out there saying, hey, we have, we get, we get the right to exist, stop discriminating against us.
[56:15.000 --> 56:22.000]  And then these radical leftist pro-Palestinian groups will come up and spit on them and attack them and yell at them and say, Jews not allowed here.
[56:22.000 --> 56:31.000]  But that's not the big news, is it? Actual real hatred and anti-Semitism, that doesn't make the air. But so now these videos are coming out.
[56:31.000 --> 56:41.000]  This is from a mall where a Muslim man is harassing a Jewish woman in New Jersey. Here's this video. It's going viral in clip nine.
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  Why are you recording me?
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.000]  I don't know. You called me out. I'm going to take my phone out. It's 2022. That's what we do.
[56:47.000 --> 56:48.000]  Are you just?
[56:48.000 --> 56:49.000]  I search me in.
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.000]  I'm Muslim.
[56:50.000 --> 56:51.000]  Nice. Welcome.
[56:51.000 --> 56:52.000]  You killed my people.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  Sorry?
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.000]  You killed my people.
[56:54.000 --> 56:55.000]  I didn't kill anyone.
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  You didn't kill my people.
[56:56.000 --> 57:01.000]  Are you going to call security or are you just going to stare at me?
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  You killed my people.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  I think you need to call the severity.
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  You killed my people.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  Okay. I didn't kill anybody.
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  Israel killed my people.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  Okay. I think it's time for you to take a walk from me.
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  I think it's time you put your phone out.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  Your boss man.
[57:14.000 --> 57:19.000]  Now, I'm not claiming that this is a hoax. I'm not claiming this is fake.
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.000]  But folks, you got to understand, this stuff gets faked all the time.
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.000]  I mean, there are hundreds of stories out there of people faking a hate crime against them.
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.000]  From black people to white people to Jewish people, you name it.
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  Now, I'm not saying, I think what's going on at UC Berkeley is real.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  I don't know. You can be the judge of that video.
[57:35.000 --> 57:49.000]  But see, this is the place we're in now where hate crimes are so profitable and you can get so much power off of a hate crime being done against you in the victim economy that people fake hate crimes against themselves to get it.
[58:05.000 --> 58:07.000]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.

[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  And we all know why that is because of the race baiting and the racial, the racified, if you will, aspect to news coverage and discussion in America these days.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  And so it's not just the violent crime that's overrunning cities that you never know if you're in a downtown Democrat run city.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  You never know. You might get shot. You might get robbed. You might get stabbed.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  But there's another phenomenon that's kind of at a lower level than that, but just as prevalent.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  And that's groups of youths, they like to use, but it's groups of young Americans.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  Most of the time they are black. Oh, don't say that.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  And they harass people on subways. They harass people. They harass their teachers.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  And the problem is they don't have a father in their home disciplining them.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  They're not allowed to be disciplined at school because that's illegal to discipline students now.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  And so they run rough shot all over people like this poor woman on a DC Metro bus who's black, by the way.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  You know, because you got to always say skin color nowadays.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  She's riding the bus. She gives up her seat to a mother and her children so they can sit down.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  And she then gets harassed by a group of youths and kicked and thrown off the bus in extremely disturbing video footage.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  Extremely disturbing. Young men and women beat up this old black lady and literally toss her off the bus.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Because, you know, it's just another Wednesday afternoon in America. Why not do it?
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  She spoke to Fox News local there in DC after the event and had this to say.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  What do you remember? Well, how did it all start?
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  I got on the bus and there was a young lady that got on with some smaller children.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  I got up to give her the seat and after that the kids were cursing.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  So I was just like, you know, can you all stop the foul language?
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  And at that point the kids became unruly. They started being disrespectful, like saying things to me.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Then next thing you know, there was things objects men thrown at me.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  And I was just like, thank you, Lord, because throughout the whole incident,
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  the only thing I could recall was the kids hitting me and kicking me and I had no defense.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  So right in the video you're saying thank you Lord, thank you Lord.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  You're saying that to protect yourself mentally.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Right.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  And then what happened in terms of you were asking the bus driver to stop the bus?
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  I asked several times prior to the stop that I was getting off at to stop the bus,
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  stop the bus, stop the bus.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  The bus driver made no sense to stop the bus.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  He didn't allow local authorities or anything to my defense.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  And so I saw in the video it looks like at one point the bus does stop
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  or the doors may be open or don't open.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  Were you trying to get off?
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  I was trying to get off, but it was where the bus driver just kept going.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  And even after I'm yelling out on top of my lungs, stop the bus, let me off the bus.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  The bus driver never stopped.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  And so then eventually the bus stops at another stop.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Which stop was that?
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  That was right there.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  I was from the Al Hop on Alabama Avenue and that's when the doors were open
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  and I was trying to get off the bus and the kids had started assaulting me
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  and kicking me and pushing me off the bus.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  Were you hurt?
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  Mentally, yeah, but not physically.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  I got like a little bruise on my arm.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  My jacket's like ripped off of me.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  You see guys, there's the rip on her jacket right there.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  I got a little creep in my arm, neck from the kicking,
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  but other than that, the law suspended me.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  Well, thank God.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  I mean, again, talk about that's just common decency.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  That's just a nice woman who wants to be a part of a civilization.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  She says, oh, here's a mother with some kids.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  I'm sitting down.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  I think I'll get up and I think I'll let her have my seat.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  Why don't you sit down with your kids?
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  Mother says, oh my gosh, thank you so much.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  And then a group of teenagers are cursing up a storm.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  I mean, the Lord knows what they were saying.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  And she says, hey, do you guys think you could maybe stop cursing?
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  We have children present.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  Oh, really?
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  And so they kick her, they punch her, they throw bottles at her,
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  they spit on her, and then they literally throw her off the bus.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Now, folks, here's the issue.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Why do we have this phenomenon of youth, complete lack of respect,
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  complete degradation, violence, vitriol, hatred?
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  This is a serious problem.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  We're seeing this every day we see examples of this.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  Why is no one addressing this problem?
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  We all know why.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  And we're not allowed to say it.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Or you'll be called a racist.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  It's came over.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com, it changes the world.

[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  We are playing throwback.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  Classic moments.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  Alex Jones was right moments, if you will.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  We go way back in time.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  20 years now to April 2020.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  Excuse me, 2002.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  April 2002.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  Here's Alex Jones warning you about the vaccines.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  The vaccines killing you.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  I got that report right here.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  Now here's where this news gets really scary.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  And this is when I freaked out on the radio today just looking at this.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  This is out of Reuters Health Company reports edible AIDS vaccine.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  The U.N., the CDC and others are now announcing that they want to put vaccines so you don't smoke cigarettes,
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  to stop cocaine use, to stop any bad bacteria, to stop bacteria in the mouth that cause cavities.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  We're talking about hundreds of vaccines being mandatory.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  And they're going to put it in bananas, corn, tomatoes.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  They're going to genetically engineer virus and bacteria, DNA into foods,
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  and then they're going to plant it when it spreads to other plants.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  Again, they're creating the genetic Pandora's Box and they want that.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  This is Reuters Health up on infowars.com.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  Six fronts from now.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  This show will be re-airing.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  It's live April 11th.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  It shall be re-airing.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  I'll get emails.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  You can find it.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  This link will go dead in about a week.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  Company reports edible AIDS vaccine.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  I've read past reports of how they're planning to put it in everything.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  A biotechnology company announced Tuesday that it had proceeded to produce genetically modified corn
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  that contains a protein found on the surface of HIV.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  The virus that causes AIDS.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  Protea Gene Inc. has worked with the National Institutes of Health, the NIH,
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  to develop the edible AIDS vaccine.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  The announcer represents a step towards this.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  And they go on to say it as global application for the people's food supplies.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  They're going to put it in everybody's food and the version of the pathogen of semen,
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  email, deficiency virus, and the major component of most vaccines against the viruses.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  And they admit that about one out of a thousand will get AIDS from this.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  Folks for the privately held college station Texas based company told Reuters Health
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  that they're going to do animal studies expected to begin this summer.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  Oh, that's great.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  Start putting virus DNA into corn and feeding it to pigs and cows.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  And cats and doggy bastards.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  And something will spin off of that.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  I mean, they're just doing it.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  Everything they're announcing now, they've already perfected and they're already doing.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  Let's go to the national post.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  One of the big three newspapers in Canada.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  Cancer linked to vaccine.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  60 top scientists met last year.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  We already knew about this and said not just the polio vaccine, but many others.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Modern vaccines have cancer viruses in them that you don't have to take the vaccine.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  Now, why is cancer up 400%?
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  Even rare cancers are up by 50%.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  An increasing number of medical researchers believe a monkey virus that contaminated polio vaccine
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  is causing cancer among the millions of Canadians who got the vaccine.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  Oh, millions of people with cancer.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  God, it's cancer everywhere.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  Everybody on my block has cancer.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  Young people have cancer.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  Two little kids on my block died this year of cancer.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  Cancer, cancer, cancer.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  La, la, la, la, la.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  I'm a right winger.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Don't listen to me.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  I'm an extremist.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  Researchers at the first thought Simeon virus, 40 SV 40, was linked only to rare brain bone and lung cancers.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  But last month, who studies the British Journal of Lancet found traces of the virus
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  in tumors of almost half of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  A relatively common cancer in Canada, which 6,200 new cases diagnosed last year.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  The number of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has inexplicably doubled over the past 30 years.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  And it says Dr. David Malkin, a Canadian researcher, wrote the controversial editorial last month's
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  Lancet saying there's enough evidence to show that SV 40 plays a role in the development of human cancers
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  in horrible cluster cancers.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  It was one of the non-believers.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  Now I'm a believer.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  There is no rational way I could figure out any other explanation for the results.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  Dr. Malkin, an oncologist at the Hospital of Sick Children, said in an interview.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  And it goes on to talk about how it's spreading into the population. You don't need to have the vaccine to get it.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  I have stuff here about a fungicide used on most crops.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  Shuts off the body's DNA that stops cancer.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  And they say we may use this for medical reasons for other stuff.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  Very strange. It does this.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Everything just messes up the DNA and everything just gets rid of population.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Just so happens to be the U.N.'s goal.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  This is yesterday, a new trend eases fears of population explosion from the U.N.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  This too from Reuters.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  In a major ship that is stunned, demographic fertility rates in much of Asia, Africa, Latin America
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  have begun dropping using fears of future global population explosion.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  Population experts said Tuesday.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And it goes in to see how it's suddenly plunging and sperm counts are down.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  Not just the 80% of Europe are 75% here, but even in other countries.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  And many women are now sterile.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  It can't be explained.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  The U.N. got caught. This is so deadly serious.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  I was trying to show you how stupid this is.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  The U.N. got caught in 133rd world countries that pay off to the country was they pay them to manufacture the vaccine.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  A very expensive female synthetic hormone they had to produce was found in the tetanus shots
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  that was sterilizing all the women because then the woman couldn't bring the child to term
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  because the body also attacked that hormone because it had been bound to the tetanus.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  Another very complex expensive procedure.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  The U.N. said, well, it's just an accident that 100 manufacturers accidentally produced this, added it.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  And the researchers went, well, excuse us, U.N., why is your tetanus program worldwide only for women?
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  And they went, no more comment.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  And later they said, well, because we care about women, feminism.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Women aren't getting taken care of and we had the program for them.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  Because if you gave a man that shot with a female hormone, it wouldn't hurt him.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  It wouldn't sterilize a man, but it sterilizes the women.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  But it's just an accident because they love you.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  And now they're going to put the vaccines in the food in that knife so there's no way to escape it.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  And Monsanto and others are buying up all the seed companies.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  Isn't that loving?
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  Vaccine sparked polio outbreak.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  Leonard Telegraph, a U.N. vaccination program in the Dominican Republic caused a massive death.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  MMR loses credibility and debate over MMR.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  MPs, government officials with credibility and debate.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  99% of the population in the latest poll are against the MMR shot.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  Yes, they're all right-wing cooks.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  The government has lost almost all credibility in the MMR debate according to a poll which found only 1% of people put their trust in politicians to give accurate balance information about the vaccine.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  This is after top, top scientists and have gone public saying that it is brain damaging children and killing them.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  And by the way, top news anchors are now being threatened to be fired.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  They're going public on live TV and going, the vaccine's killing you.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  You got that report right here.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  80% are opposed to MMR triple jab.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  This is two months ago.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Now it's the 99%.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  And it says right here the presenters are on TV going, it's killing us.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  The vaccines.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  I think, you know, drug off.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  The plan to kill you.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  It's like running man, but instead Schwarzenegger runs in and running man and takes over.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  It's all fake.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  It's, you know, I'm not mad dog bin renters.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  People go, shut up, right-winger.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  We love, we love the host of running man.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  Look at Whitman pricing a dime.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  There they are right now basking in the Maui Sun.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Alex Jones, 20 years ago.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  A man ahead of his time.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  Keep Alex Jones on the air, folks.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  Chop at infowarstore.com.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  Go to saveinfowars.com.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  It's our best seller.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back at stock.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system,
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  but it helps every cellular function of the body.

[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  that you need to live and be healthy.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  Essential means without these things you die.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  And so much of the food is debased.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  It is critical to bolster our body defenses with a product like this.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.

[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  in any way that they deem fit.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet,
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been

[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  At the White House lawn and then after he goes unhinged, he does his odd little jog.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  You know that weird little stiff legged jog that he does?
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  He takes off towards Marine One.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  So here's an unhinged Joe Biden approaching reporters and grabbing them as well,
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  screaming at them in a very odd unhinged clip here that just happened in DC.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  John Federman is going to appear with you today in Pennsylvania,
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  but there haven't been that many candidates campaigning with you.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  That's not true. There's about 15 counts.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  Okay, and are there going to be even more?
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  Yeah.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  There's going to be any restrictions on abortion at all.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  Any restrictions on abortion at all.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  Yes, there should be.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  There should be.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  And Roe v. Wade.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  Read it, man.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  You'll get educated.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  I'm going to have to read it.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  There's the little stiff legged jog.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  And he grabs both reporters aggressively, gets in their face and screams at them as you saw there.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  He's completely out of his mind.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  He's completely unhinged.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  And he screams at the first reporter, 15 Democrats have campaigned with me.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  Actually, I don't even, I don't believe that's true.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  The Democrat candidates head of the midterms have been avoiding Joe Biden for the most part.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  I mean, maybe two or three occasions where a Democrat has wanted to go to a Biden event
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  and have Biden in his event.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  Normally they don't want it.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  They don't want anything to do with him.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  His ratings are horrible.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  He's a horrible person.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  He's corrupt as they come.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  So Democrats don't want to campaign with Biden.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  But why does he run up and grab reporters?
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  The woman says, hey, Federman's campaigning with you today.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  First Democrat to do that in a while, he grabs her and says, not true, kid, not true.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  Gets angry, screams at her, grabs her, then moves on and the guy asks about abortion,
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  does the same thing, grabs him and says, Rover's raid, Rover's way.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  Federman, Federnek's neck growth, whatever it is, is on full display today, by the way.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  He's not wearing a hoodie or a gator.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  So you can see a gigantic bulge on his neck.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  He can't read, he can't hear, but he's ready for Senate.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  He's basically a Neanderthal.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  So that's what the Democrats are basically is Neanderthals and the crypt keepers like Joe Biden.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  But my producer was pointing out, and this point has been made a bunch,
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  if the Democrats really wanted to codify Rover's way, they could have done it a lot of different times.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  They could have done it when Obama was in office and they had the White House and the Senate and the House.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  They could have done it right now with Biden in the White House
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  and they have enough control over the Senate and control over the House.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  So they could codify Rover's raid or they could make abortion law of the land,
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  which they all claim to want to do.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  They could have done it probably about seven different times since Rover's raid was done
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  and the Democrats had control.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  I think it was seven different times they could have done it when they've had full control
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  and they never did it once.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  Why is that?
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  Because they know it's not popular, but they lie to you.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  Now, there's been another unhinged Democrat and this is AOC.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Now, I always put this caveat out there because we want our audience to be fully informed
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  and I understand why people think a red wave is coming.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  Folks, there should have been a red wave in 2020 and there wasn't and you know why.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  Why do you think that would change in 2022?
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  So I don't have my hopes up that you're going to see a red wave.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  I think the Democrats are going to get more political control, quite frankly.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  Even though they can't have an event that doesn't get protested now,
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  even the darling of the Democrat Party AOC cannot have events without getting protested now.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  Every event she has in public, she's getting protested.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  By liberals, by the way, by liberals, it has been conservative, but it's liberals
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  and she doesn't really know how to handle it because she's been handled with kid gloves
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  and everything has been given to her since she joined politics.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  So she hasn't had much of a resistance.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  Now she actually has an actual organic resistance and so this is what happened.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  Let's start with clip three.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  Actually, let's go to clip one and then three and then two. Let's do it like that.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  So protesters show up. This is the third or fourth time an AOC event has been protested lately,
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  mostly because of her stance on war, voting for war.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  Some people upset that she's not fully against Israel,
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  which she knows she can't do right now considering the left attack in Kanye West
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  being anti-Semites, anti-Semitic.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  So the Democrats can't show their hatred for Jews or Israel right now.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  It's the wrong time. So she's getting protested and so here's what happened.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  She starts dancing as the protests take over her event in clip one.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  She pretty much gives up trying to talk.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  Look at all the masters, all the masters standing up for AOC. They're all wearing a mask.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  They're saying how violent New York is.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  So there you go. Now folks, this is an AOC event.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  It's a small event, maybe 50 or so people there.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  And half the crowd is protesting her.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  And so there you can see she does a dance.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  And you know, that's fine. That's fine.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  I understand that. I've done that before when protesters line up against me.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  But then again, I'm not a politician in office.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  So behaving like a goon is not really a good look for a politician.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  But okay, whatever. She decides she wants to do a little dance.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  She's not a serious politician anyway.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  The event got so out of control, they basically had to shut it down.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  And so here's that in clip three.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  Ma'am, you're saying ask us why you all have been talking for 20 minutes, okay?
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  We know why. We know why you're mad. Let's talk about it.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  Let's talk about it. Let's talk about it.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  Politics, baby.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  Okay.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  So now they turn the lights off to try to get the crowd under control.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  We love you, AOC. Thank you.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  She has to step off, step out of the stage.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  And now she comes back, and this is wild, folks. Watch this.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  I'm not allowed to be in a room where the lights turn off. It gets a little...
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  All right, all right, listen, all right, listen, listen, okay, listen.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  Hey, listen. Hey, have a taco. Have a burrito. Hey, listen, listen.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  Are you Jennifer Lopez now?
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  That was, they're becoming completely unhinged.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  And of course they are, because they're finally being held accountable for what they've done.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  And that's what's happening here is these dirtbag politicians and these dirtbag media hosts
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  have been lying and hurting the American people for so long without any accountability,
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  without any pushback, with nothing. And now they're finally getting it.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  They're finally getting what they deserve. Our politicians deserve to be shouted down.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  They're crooks. They have destroyed this country.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  Our media members deserve to get shouted down. They're crooks.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  They've destroyed this country. And so this is inevitable, folks.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  Look, whether you're a liberal, whether you're a conservative Republican Democrat,
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  our politicians have screwed us over. Everybody knows it.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  D.C. is the district of criminals. Everybody knows it.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  And quite frankly, AOC is like the least a blame of it.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  She's just a dirty communist that wants to destroy freedom and prosperity in America.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  So she's got her own problems. But no, this has been a long time coming, folks.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  Our politicians, our media, they're corrupt, and that's why they're getting protested.

[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  Info wars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.

[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  and I can't fund those myself.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  It's unsustainable.

[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  Wouldn't be without you.
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  Saveinfowars.com Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  All right, let's get into the death cult eugenics program that has completely taken over the
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  liberal leftist movement with the stop the manmade climate change agenda and the abortion agenda.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  That's eugenics.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  That's human sacrifice.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  And I'm going to explain it all right here.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  Now, Stacey Abrams recently went viral for this odd clip and we'll start it with this.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  The White House not going to comment after Stacey Abrams suggests abortion is not a culture war issue,
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  but an inflation issue.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  She conflates the two.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  So Stacey Abrams gets asked about inflation and says, well, the answer is obviously killing your babies.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  An incredible clip here from Stacey Abrams.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  Just asked you, you're running for governor of Georgia.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  I would assume maybe incorrectly, but while abortion is an issue,
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  where it reaches the level of interest of voters in terms of the cost of gas, food, bread, milk, things like that.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  What can a governor, what could you do as governor to alleviate the concerns of Georgia voters
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  about those livability, daily, hourly issues that they're confronted with?
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  But let's be clear.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  Having children is why you're worried about your price for gas.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  It's why you're concerned about how much food costs.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  I mean, this is not a reductive issue.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  You can't divorce being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy from the economic realities of having a child.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  And so these are, it's important for us to have both and conversations.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  We don't have the luxury of reducing it or separating them out,
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  but we also have to talk about what a governor can do.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  A governor can address housing prices.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  A governor can address the cost of education.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  A governor can put money into the pockets of everything hardworking.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  So the logic here is that, oh, because we're forced to have children,
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  that's what's causing inflation.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  And so therefore, kill your children and that'll stop the inflation.
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  I mean, of course, that's completely wrong.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  But you know, imagine you were, let's say I'm an alien.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  Let's say I'm not from Earth and I don't really understand you Earthlings and your politics and any of this stuff.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  I'm completely uneducated, uninformed on all things humanity.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  And I'm just a neutral observer looking at the abortion debate.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  And so let's say I'm sitting here and I'm looking at the abortion debate
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  and I'm seeing the debates and I hear this and I say, okay, well, yeah,
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  I guess I could understand if you have an unwanted pregnancy and you can't afford the baby.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  I guess, yeah, that would be a situation where you wouldn't want to have that baby.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  You can't afford it.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  But then let's say somebody injects something into my knowledge in that moment that changes the game.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  Well, what would that knowledge be?
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  Again, I'm an alien.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  I have no idea what's going on.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  I'm just listening to a bunch of people debate abortion.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  And then someone comes to me and says, hey, you know that women don't just get pregnant, right?
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  I say, what?
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  I don't understand.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  They say, yeah, women have to make a choice to have sex to get pregnant.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  Oh, well, that changes everything.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  They have this mentality, of course, they know it's not true that pregnancy has just come out of nowhere.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  Like a woman has no control over when she's pregnant and when she's not.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  We're obviously not talking about instances of rape.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  But it's this notion like, oh, I have no control.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  I'm just pregnant out of nowhere.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  It's an unwanted pregnancy.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  Kill the baby.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  I'm not going to sit here and act like every American is going to practice abstinence.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  That's ludicrous.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  There's dozens of different ways to make sure you don't get pregnant.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  Abstinence is the most guaranteed one.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  See, that's the lie is that, no, you had sex.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  You knew having sex was going to could potentially lead to a pregnancy.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  That's on you.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Why is that aspect of this debate completely ignored and cast aside?
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  That should be the number one.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  Everything should stem from that concept.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  But see, that's the whole notion of you want to be able to do whatever you want without any accountability.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  Liberals want to burn cities to the ground with no accountability, and they do.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  Democrats want to cheat in elections with no accountability, and they do.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  You see what happens?
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  So it's the same thing.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  Oh, I want to be able to have sex, and if I get pregnant, I don't want to be accountable.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  I want to kill my baby.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  And then they try to justify that by saying, hey, that's a good thing.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  That's going to fight inflation.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  Wow.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  Justifying abortion because of inflation.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  Now here's the Babylon B headline.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  Stacey Abrams explains you can get your bills down to $0 by killing yourself.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  Now that's the Babylon B.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  It's a satirical website.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  But as the Babylon B operating as a satirical website does, unwittingly, it actually is sometimes more accurate than the real news.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  Because you understand that this is the entire notion behind man-made climate change, right?
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  Let me explain.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  It's all a eugenics program.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  Now, quickly, Matt Walsh reminds us, he posted this on his Twitter account.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  You can see for yourself.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  In 1969, Planned Parenthood produced a memo recommending strategies for population control.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  These include restructuring the family, encouragement of increased homosexuality, tax-funded abortion, and sterilization.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  They then went on and implemented all of these.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  He's absolutely right.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  Look at what's happened to the family.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  Fatherless households, a complete disaster, increased homosexuality, the grooming everywhere, tax-funded abortion, Planned Parenthood, sterilization, trans kids, they've done it all.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  Planned Parenthood was a eugenics program started by Margaret Sangers backed by Jewish Americans to eliminate the black population in America.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  I've done the research.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  I've been on this issue since I was in high school.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  I'm telling you the facts.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  Look it up for yourself.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  Planned Parenthood was started by Margaret Sanger financed by Jewish Americans to keep the black population out of America.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  And as they called it at the time, weeds.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  They wanted to get the weeds out.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Oh, but don't talk about the racism of Planned Parenthood.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no, because they love Planned Parenthood.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  But it's all eugenics, it's all population control and abortion and stopping manmade climate change are two arms of the same eugenics program.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  Biden Energy Advisor admits that the regime wants to limit oil production to accelerate the transition.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  The transition to what?
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  They don't know.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  Wind energy can't sustain.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  Solar energy can't sustain.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  So they have those as options, but they do not sustain.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  You need coal.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  You need oil.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  Or what is going to happen?
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  Well, I'll tell you, but it goes on.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  Peter Ducey, Stump Screen, GPR.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  What makes you think the oil companies are going to listen to an administration that is trying to put them out of business?
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  So they want to put them out of business.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  So what happens though?
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  What happens when you put the oil business and the coal producers and end energy?
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  What happens?
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  What happens when you end that energy?
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  Well, guess what?
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  You don't have electricity, you can't drive a car, you don't have a job, you don't have a meal on your table.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  So then what happens?
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  Major supermarket in UK planning to sell bugs as food to help poor people through winter.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  So this is all the result of manmade climate change agenda, green policies.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  You don't get oil.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  You don't get energy.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  You have to eat the bugs.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  You can't heat or cool your home and it mostly affects poor people.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  And so here's how brainwashed they are.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  This is a European climate activist interviewed by media short clip.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  Listen to what he says here in clip 11.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  Farming needs to stop.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  Okay.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  Let's play it one more time just so you heard it right.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  One more time.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  Here's what he says.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  Farming needs to stop.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  Now he's right.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  According to their logic, farming has to stop to stop climate change.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  That's their logic.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  It's completely inaccurate.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  You stop farming.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  We all die.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  You cut off the energy.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  We all die.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  You cut off the farming.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  We all die.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  Do you get it?
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  So when the Babylon bee says kill yourself to save the planet from climate change, that's
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  actually what they're trying to do.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  Support your baby.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  Kill yourself.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  Stop manmade climate change.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  Dutch government to seize 600 farms at gunpoint claiming nitrogen as a pollutant.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Do you get it, folks?
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  They're shutting off your energy.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  They're shutting off your farms so that you go die in the woods.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  Go live in a cave if you really believe this crap.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  The first amendment is unique in the world.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next.
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet,
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the global agenda.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  because of your past support.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  And I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle,
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  free double your efforts by visiting infowarstore.com
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  and getting amazing products that keep us on air.

[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  And I thank you all for your support.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics,
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  not just in America, but in the world.
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  Yes, I've persevered.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  But the listeners and viewers who support Info Wars
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  are the real reason we've had this success.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  how important you've been in this fight
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify it.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  God bless you all.
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  I salute you.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  I thank you.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  because we are over the target and this dream is happening.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  The fight is my fight.
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  It's your fight.
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  It's our fight.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  God bless you all.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  By the will of God and by God working through you and your support
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  Info Wars continues to persevere against the attacks never before seen
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  in the Western world against independent media.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  And over the years you have come to the table.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  You have stepped to the plate so many times
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  and kept Info Wars and Free Speech on the air.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  And I thank you.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  And I need your support.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward,
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  if you want to back me in this fight against the globalist,

[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  for direct Alex Jones legal defense fund.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making, is almost over.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  And right at the end, we're not giving up.
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  We're not giving in, but we could give out.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  So please, if you support what we're doing

[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  Today, fluoride is the enemy.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  What's the good halogen?
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  This doesn't understand, if you want to make sense of it all,
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  the leaders of this planet, the elites,
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  are running a global population control eugenics program
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  at its most basic functioning operational,
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  or operation of this would be abortion, plant-parenthood centers.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  Just kill the babies before they're born.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  But the large-scale operation is the man-made climate change lies
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  that are going to tell you, we need to stop using coal and gas,
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  and then what's going to happen?
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  Well, you're not going to have any farmers, you're not going to have any farms,
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  so then you're not going to have any food.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  So then what are you going to do?
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  Well, you're going to die.
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  So what you're going to do, you're going to die.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  And they have these leftists so brainwashed now
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  that they openly say, we need to stop farming,
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  it's the leading cause of climate change.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  Okay, so I just wish these people would actually live out their politics.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  I wish these people would actually live out their ideologies to the completion,
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  because if they did, you'd realize they don't actually believe anything they're saying.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  If you really believe all this crap, if you really believe man-made climate change
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  and you want to sit here and tell everyone else how to live their life because of it,
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  I want you to go live in a cave, okay?
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  Any Democrat or politician from that matter around the planet
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  that votes or writes legislation to stop man-made climate change,
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  I expect you to go home to your cave and I expect you to walk or hike or bike there.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  I don't want you using any electricity, I don't want you driving any sort of automobile.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  Why don't you live the life you want the rest of the people to live?
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  Why don't you live the life that you expect the world to live with your policies?
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  Go live in a cave.
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  No laundry for you, no laundry for you, no processed food for you,
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  no dishwasher, no heating, no cooling, no automobile, go live in a cave.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  Stop telling everyone else how to live their life when you won't live the life
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  that you're saying is the only way to save the planet.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  You go live in the woods, you go live in a cave, you go wipe your ass with your bare hands,
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  you do that.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  The rest of us like civilization.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  The rest of us like easily accessible energy.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  The rest of us like to be able to travel at our own leisure.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  We like that.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  Everybody likes that, including all you climate change activists.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  You like it too, but you just want to tell everybody else how to live
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  and you want a virtue signal like you're better than everyone else
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  when the truth is you are the scum of the earth.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  But just know abortion is a eugenics program.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  So is manmade, stopping manmade climate change.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  It's all the same thing.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  And then you've got the aspect with the vaccines.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  We'll cover that later on today, but now you've got the new phenomenon.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  This is how it should be done, folks.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  I mean, I could show you the videos today.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  There were more videos out of England where stop oil now protesters
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  sit in the road and block traffic.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  And it's the same thing happens in Italy and in the UK everywhere now.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  The stop oil, if they're not desecrating buildings,
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  if they're not desecrating famous art and museums,
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  they're blocking traffic and what happens is the drivers are sick of it
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  and so they get out of their car and they pick these little bastards up
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  and they throw them off the side of the road.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  That's what they deserve.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  You're going to block traffic?
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  Somebody needs to rough you up.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  People have lives to live.
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  You clearly are never disciplined as a child.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  You clearly have never faced discipline in your life.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  That's why you're still behaving like a child.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  This is all arrested development.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  I'm glad my parents disciplined me as a kid.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  I'm glad I got disciplined.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  I'm glad I got grounded.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  I'm glad I took a wooden spoon to the behind or a belt
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  because you know what?
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  I'd be behaving like those lowlifes if I didn't.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  I'm glad I was disciplined.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  I'm glad in high school when I acted up, I got disciplined.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  I'm grateful for that.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  I appreciate that.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  These people clearly never got that.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  That's why they are like the way they are.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  So how do you deal with these people properly?
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  I think Volkswagen is going about this the right way.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  Guys, if you could pull up the whole thread here just for more context
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  of the tweet I sent you.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  I guess it's engineers.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  I can't tell if some of them are engineers or some of them are activists
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  or there's a crossover here.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  One individual named Gianluca Gramalda is protesting with about a dozen
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  climate change activists and they have super glued themselves to the floor
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  of a car dealership or a car manufacturing showroom floor.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  So you can see it looks like some nice Porsches there I think.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  On the screen it looks like that's a nice 911 right there on the screen.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  That's a beautiful car and I'd love to drive that thing around.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  They wouldn't like me to do it though.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  So they super glued themselves to the floor and here's what happens.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  They super glued themselves to the floor and they know they're going to get
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  a bunch of media coverage.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  That makes them feel good and they know there's not going to be any punishment
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  because they do their little protest and then they get up and guess what?
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  They drive their cars home to their houses and their apartments
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  that have climate controlled environments.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  Because you know they're so loyal to their cause.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  As soon as they're done with their protest they hop in their car
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  and they go to their house and their apartment because they're all hypocrites.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  So how do you deal with these freaks?
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  I think Volkswagen has it right.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  Volkswagen has told the protesters that they support their right to protest
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  but they refused our request to provide us with a bowl to urinate and defecate
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  in a decent manner while we are glued and have turned off the heating.
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  People in support can't get out of the building.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  So let me get this straight.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  You super glued yourself to the floor because you think human activity on this planet
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  is killing it.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  Human activity like driving a car, flushing a toilet, heating your home.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  And then after you super glue yourself to the floor and the company says,
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  hey, you know what, we're going to let you stay there.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  You mean we actually have to stay here with our asses and hands super glued to the floor?
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  That's not what we wanted.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  We wanted you guys to just make us do this for half an hour or so
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  and then we could go back home to our lives in our nice homes and our fancy cars.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  We didn't actually think you'd make us stay here.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  And then what does he say?
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  The decency to defecate in a decent manner.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  Dude, you're the one that wants to live like a damn caveman.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  You're the one that wants to send us back to the Stone Age.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  And then you say the decency to defecate in a bowl.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  How do you think life is going to be when you shut the power off?
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  How do you think life is going to be when you don't have power tools
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  and you don't have trucks and equipment to build homes and infrastructure?
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  I mean, these people are loony tunes, man.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  They're loony tunes.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  Hey, you really believe we're killing the planet? Fine. Go live in a cave.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Go live in the woods. More power to you.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  You're frauds. You know what you're saying is a lie.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  And you know you're just doing it all for attention because you're stuck in arrested development.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  You're a 10-year-old boy in a grown man's body.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  And now you're complaining because you can't defecate in a decent manner.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  Well, what do you think is going to happen when you make everything illegal?
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  What do you think happens when you stop what you see as man-made climate change?
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  You'll be defecating in the woods, wiping your ass with your bare hand.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  Is that decent? Because I notice you didn't choose to do that.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  I notice you still choose to live in a home and drive your car to get to and from work.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  That's odd. No, they're all frauds.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  This is how this should be done.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  Now, when they do this at a Starbucks or stuff, I can understand.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  People may want to get them off.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  But I really believe this is the way right here.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  When these jackasses want to superglue themselves to the sidewalk,
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  superglue themselves to buildings, superglue themselves to car manufacturing plants,
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  I say more power to them.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  I say, let them sit there. Let them sit there forever.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  In fact, I would bring a vat of superglue and I'd say, do you need more?
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  Can I get you more superglue?
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  Is there anything else I can do to make sure that you're superglue here forever to prove your point?
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  Now, pouring out the milk at the grocery stores,
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  this is just a different level of derangement that shouldn't be tolerated at all.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  These individuals should be facing major, major fines and consequences, if not jail time.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  But that's a different level.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  But see, here's the thing.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  Once they realize that we've caught on to their superglue tactics
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  they're not going to play their games anymore and now if they superglue themselves to the sidewalk
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  or they superglue themselves to a car manufacturing plant or a museum
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  that they're actually going to have to stay there the rest of their lives,
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  they'll probably stop doing that and just go back to the physical violence
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  and the desecration of venerable objects and art and pouring milk out at supermarkets.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  Somebody should have decked those people, quite frankly.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  But they get to pave like children because they were never disciplined as children,
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  now they still are children and we don't call it out for what it is.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  But no, you want to know the answer?
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  All these loony tunes that want to superglue themselves to every which thing
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  to fight climate change, bring them more superglue.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  I would dump superglue all over their bodies and say, have at it.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  So all you climate change activists, either go live in a cave or shut your mouth.
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  All over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  or newswars.com, it changes the world.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  And that's why when you go to infowarsstore.com and get amazing products
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family,
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  The fight starts at infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at infowarsstore.com.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  Thank you.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  Thank you.
[2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  You may recall a few months back the New York Times wrote a story
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:19.000]  and I think it was picked up by other left-wing news outlets saying,
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  Republicans are stalking ballot drop boxes, pool watchers stalking drop mail-in ballots.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  Oh my God, it's the worst thing ever.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  The fascists are watching the drop boxes.
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  And there is this less.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  And the obvious question would be, well, wait a second, why does that bother you?
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  Why does somebody wanting to watch the ballot boxes under you so much?
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  Why would you be against that?
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  I thought you wanted to stop voter fraud.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  Democrats complain about voter fraud all the time and blame Republicans.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  But then when Republicans talk about voter fraud, say it doesn't exist,
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  it's just more of the double think of the liberal Democrat mindset.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  But okay, why would they be upset that there's pool watchers?
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  Why would they want to block out windows so nobody can see them counting the votes?
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  Why would they be upset that Republicans are organizing for people to watch the drop boxes
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  after the 2000 mules documentary exposed how Democrats cheated in the 2020 election?
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  Why would they be so concerned?
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  Another guest was on with Steve Bannon yesterday.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  Melody Jennings was addressing this exact phenomenon here it is in clip 13.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  People are getting the word.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  They are showing up.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  Our people are showing up and gathering around boxes and shutting the step down.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  What these mules don't understand is just because I put a fuzzy still shot up on true social
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  that doesn't look like anything.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  We're geo-tracking them.
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  We've got cameras on the back sides of them.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  People are freaking out because they say this picture doesn't prove anything.
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  That's okay.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  We have the sauce.
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  We're just showing you that we're out there and people are coming and joining us.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  It's great camaraderie going on.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  In Michigan, we're about to go viral all over the state.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  I've got people all lined up getting ready to march out there around your boxes.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  So be on notice.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  Tudor Dixon, Matt Teperno are here to help.
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  If you need me, shout me out.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  So, there you go.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  Yesterday, I covered a story where an individual checked the box on a mail-in ballot that said
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  the individual receiving this mail-in ballot is no longer living here or deceased.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  He continues to get mail-in ballots sent to his mailbox.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  It doesn't matter how many times he checks the box to get them off the voter rolls.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  They keep showing up.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  I explain why.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  That's how Democrats decide who they can vote for.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  They double test the market.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  Okay, this person is definitely dead.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  We can vote for him.
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  Nobody will know.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  You also have this.
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  This is even crazier.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  Dead Dog receives register to vote by mail application from Michigan Democrat Party.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  You can see his response at the story at the Gateway Pundit.
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  So, that's what they're doing.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  Now, again, I ask the question, why would anybody be concerned that there are polling
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  poll watchers monitoring the mail-in ballot drop boxes?
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  Why would anybody be concerned with that?
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  Do I even have to tell you the answer?
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  Is it not the most obvious thing ever?
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  Because they want to cheat.
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  One plus one equals two.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  Why would they be concerned that you're watching the drop boxes?
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  Because they're planning on using them to cheat.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  Duh.
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  And they say all this publicly, and they think that you're so stupid, you won't get it.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  Oh, why?
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  Why are they putting cardboard boxes over the windows at the polling locations?
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  Oh, I don't know, not to hide anything.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  Why are they pulling up with truckloads of ballots at 3 a.m. in the morning in Detroit, Michigan?
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  Oh, not so they can count 300,000 votes for Biden.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  Oh, why did they lie and say there was a water main break in Georgia so that everybody left the polling center,
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  and then they pulled out a bunch of boxes from underneath the table and double-running them through the counters?
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  Not because they were cheating.
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  Why are they upset that you're out there watching the ballot drop boxes?
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  Because they're cheating.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  Why do they block the windows?
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  Because they're cheating.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  Why do they lie about a water main break?
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  Because they're cheating.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  Why do truckloads of ballots come in at 3 a.m. in the morning for Biden?
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  Because they're cheating.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  It's so obvious, and you know what's even sadder about it?
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  We know it.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  They know it.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  They know we know it.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  We know they know we know it, and they still do it.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  These people are sick.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  It's our best seller.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  We came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them,
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:19.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system,
[2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  The essential means, without these things, you die.
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  And so much of the food is debased.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:35.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there,
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  but this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the infowars.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock at infowarsstore.com for 50% off.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:59.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  I didn't take a knee for anybody, except Jesus Christ.
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  Bryson Gray is that guy.
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  Now, he recently put out a song.
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  We're going to air it here on the show in the next segment,
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  and we're actually going to debut a music video that we made for it.
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  He put together his own video with the lyrics.
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  I think that was yesterday when you first put that out, Bryson.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  But I want to talk about your motivations for this song,
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  discussing the Kanye West and Alex Jones lawsuits.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  You put out a song yesterday. It's a great song, by the way.
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  We're going to play it in the next segment.
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  What motivated you to put the lyrics down on paper and then to put the song out yesterday?
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  Because the stuff is also happening to me.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  So I really hit home when I see him getting sued for his freedom of speech.
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  I see Kanye getting banned and his bank accounts getting banned for his freedom of speech.
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  That stuff already happened to Alex.
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  Now it's happening to Kanye, and it makes me think because I'm a very controversial person.
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  I'm outspoken myself, and I have opinions that people would call against the grain.
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  So when you think about what's happening to them, it's like, yo, we're literally next.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  Anybody that says anything against the agenda or outside the agenda is next.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  Look at what they did to Andrew Tate. That happened before Kanye.
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  So it just hit home for me for that reason.
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  So this is something you feel you can relate to as a musician, as an artist,
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  who's been de-platformed and had to deal with censorship yourself.
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  Yeah, I mean, who else gets songs, gets songs banned on Spotify, never getting to pay back up?
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  That doesn't really happen to a lot of people.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  When they start banning the music, there's an issue.
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  When they start really taking like, Kanye can't say, I don't know,
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  I don't even know how to say it on here, but like, he can't just question certain things.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  He can't say basic truths on social media.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  He can't say, Fed and I was a contributor to Joy Floyd's death.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:17.000]  Like these are things we can't say.
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  He can't say secular Jews own the entire music industry.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  Like we can't say these things.
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  Alex Jones can't give an opinion.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  Alex Jones even said he was wrong about some things.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  Apologize. It's still not enough.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  So it's like, come on, man.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  Well, and you know, let's go into this topic because here's my thing is, I want consistency.
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  The one thing I'm always talking about, I always try to say to my audience,
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  if there's ever, if I ever have a quotable, it's, if it can't be applied universally,
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  it's not logic, it's propaganda.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  And that's all I see here is propaganda.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  So it's mainstream to not just say white people run the world,
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  but to paint that as a bad thing and say white supremacy all the time.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  So it's perfectly acceptable to criticize white people.
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  And by the way, it's acceptable to criticize black people.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  Conservative, conservatives criticize black people all the time.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  Let's not act like that doesn't go on.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  I was doing it earlier today.
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  So white people can be white people are fully able to be criticized.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  Black people are fully able to be criticized.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  That happens every day in America.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  Okay, it's called free speech.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  You disagree in your debate, but oh, not those white people.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  Oh, not those white people.
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  So you can say, you could say Kanye West could rap about white people running the world all day long.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  But as soon as he inserts the word Jew into it, all of a sudden he can't say it.
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  That's why I know it's not logic, it's propaganda.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  I was just talking about this on a live stream, actually,
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  because you know, CRT and things like that in schools is all to paint the white male as a white supremacist or KKK or the enemy.
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  And then on the conservative side, they love when we talk about the black on black crime rate.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  They love when we talk about what's going on in the black neighborhood.
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  They love when we talk about what the rappers are promoting in their music.
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  But as soon as you talk about the people funding what the rappers are promoting in the music,
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  the ones signing, giving these artists the money and pushing this stuff out.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  Artists don't push their own music out.
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  These people get in front of your faces.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  And I mean, they are secular Jews.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  The three record labels are all owned by secular Jews.
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  This isn't a conspiracy.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  This is just reality and a fact.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  But as soon as you say that, everybody has a problem with it.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  So yeah, the double standard or triple standard, whatever this can be called, is insane.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  And I don't understand what the big deal is either.
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  It's like, hey, look, yeah, Jewish Americans are highly successful.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  I don't think you see many homeless Jewish people.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  I don't think I see any Jewish girls at Planned Parenthood.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  That's fine.
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  Hey, Jewish people do successful in America.
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  Good for them.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  They like the free market.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  They like capitalism.
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  You want to do business with them?
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  You make millions of dollars in the process?
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  Hey, good for you too.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  If you don't like it, then fine.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  You don't have to do it.
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  But it's like you're not even allowed to talk about it.
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  And so, but somebody that's been through the music industry before and you're independent,
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  I mean, what can you say about that?
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  I mean, how much of what we see from mainstream music is original or from the actual artist
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  versus somebody else putting that out there for them?
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  Well, when music artists sign a record deal, you don't have creative control anymore.
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  You don't control how it gets promoted.
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  You don't even control they could change the beat if they want to, they can add another artist if they want to,
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  they could change the hook if they want to.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  And these these record label owners, let me just use that phrase, are very smart in the way they do it.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  This is this is all a plan.
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  That's why they get these things about it.
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  This music, drill music is literally about people that are actually dead in real life getting promoted.
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  So these labels are signing these people, giving them a million dollars, pitting this drill music in front of everybody faces.
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  Little Nas X, pitting in front of everybody faces.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  These people don't have creative control.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  They don't even control their video shoots.
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  They don't even control their photo shoots.
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  They don't even, they don't have that control.
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  That's not contract's word.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  Now, when you get in, because here's the thing too, they want to make,
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  whether it's the Me Too movement or, you know, racism, this or whatever, okay,
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  let's let's look at every little word or every little action.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  But I mean, I could sit here and take a look at mainstream rap lyrics from anybody.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  It doesn't matter. Any mainstream rap lyrics you want.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  You pick the, you pick the rap artists, mainstream, played on the radio, played on TV, all over the internet,
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  millions of views, you play it, you're going to find lyrics that are blatantly misogynistic,
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  you know, blatantly violent, blatantly even racist and all this other stuff.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  Nobody really, barely even a fuss, barely even a blip on the radar.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  Nobody really complains about that.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  But then Kanye West goes on podcasts and all of a sudden there's all these problems in the world.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  I mean, what about, talk about that double standard or just why you chose to not do those kind of lyrics?
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  I'm going to say it was more interesting to add to it.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  Look up, look up who's a part owner of Tik Tok, Warner Music.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  Look up who's a part owner of Spotify.
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  Look who owns the Spotify playlist.
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  So these songs are talking about murder, sex, drugs, misogyny, right? True misogyny.
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  Not only are these rappers allowed to do it, but the people that control the platforms,
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  depending on your face, they're pushing it out there.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  I decided to do something different because that is destructive.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  And I used to make the music about women shaking a bus and getting drunk and stuff like that.
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  I used to make that music.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  Then you realize, you know, me as, of course, my faith comes first.
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  So when I changed my life, what I was rapping about started to change.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  And then you realize how destructive that stuff is.
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  Like if you look at clubs, I don't know if you remember the Wacka Flocka era and Wacka Flocka was popular.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  But when I used to go to the club and Wacka Flocka would play, it'd be a fight or crime mob,
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  nook if you buck, it'd be a fight with no songs played.
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  Music has influence over your mind.
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  So I decided to go a different route, try to make it positive.
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  I got a song called, I'm not depressed because every other song will tell you to be depressed.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  So I want to give you something different.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  And that's kind of another frustration here.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  It's like, look, whether you like what you said or not, or whether you think it's anti-Semitic or not,
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  how is it that you have a problem with that, but not all the garbage that you have been,
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  that you have been fed in these lyrics, much worse for humanity, much worse for the country,
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  much worse for the youth at large than anything you say says on a podcast.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  I don't know if you know, but these same rappers who met at Kanye,
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  they just came together to defend drill music.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  You know, New York was trying to ban drill music.
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  You know, this music about murder and killing.
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  And the rappers came together and fought for drill music to not get their free speech taken away from them.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  These same rappers was just fighting that Pete Diddy was doing it, Noriega was talking about it, Meek Mill,
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  all the rappers came together to defend drill music.
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  But Kanye speaking his mind, something that in my view is positive, but y'all going against him.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  What's really going on? What is really happening behind the scenes?
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  Yeah, and I think that's the problem is what Kanye's saying is making people think and ask those questions
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  and you're not supposed to think. Somebody else is supposed to think for you.
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  You're not supposed to ask those questions. Only the acceptable mainstream media can ask the questions.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, when we come back, we're going to play Bryson Gray's new song
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  with the music video that our crew made. Bryson hasn't even seen this yet, so I'm excited to get his reaction to it.

[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  or a co-worker that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.

[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  Look what they did to Alec Jones. They're trying to rob him of every single thing he owns.
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  How you get sued for a billy for saying something wrong?
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  They won't stop till everybody bein' watched by drones.
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  And look what they did to ya, they want everything.
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  P.P. Morgan, Van Hiss and Calmer, they do F-sting.
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  They care more about Kanye West than they do sex rings.
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  It's like you only have free speech if you F-wing.
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  Hey, he war, white lies, Madison, McCann and so on say. She show a bill and money winning.
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  They both expose them back.
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  They need to get closer to God, though that's what I'm hoping for.
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  Because of these, they hate the stars when they can't control them.
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  They been Donald Trump while he was sitting president.
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  I guess they don't care if that's just a dangerous precedent.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  Now they rayin' him and might land there without evidence.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  Is this still America and what it represents?
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  And that's why I'm not infected while I'm slaying demons.
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  We livin' in the end of times.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  You should show a season.
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  Politicians betray this country.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  They commit in treason.
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  It's off of power, so they laugh and ride a country blier.
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  Look what they did to Alex Jones.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  They tryin' to rob him of every single thing he owns.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  How you get sued for a billy for saying somethin' wrong?
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  They won't stop till everybody bein' watched by drones.
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  And look what they did to ya, they want everything.
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  P.P. Morgan, Van Hiss and Calmer, they do F-sting.
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  They care more about Kanye West than they do sex rings.
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  It's like you want me half a speech if you left wing.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  Look what they did to Andrew K. They been snicko too.
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  And everything they did to me, they gon' do to you.
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  They run experiments on people like we in the zoo.
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  They scare you in the silence if you have a different view.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  You could talk sex, murder, but kids to switch their gender.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  You can't preach repentance, but you can tell them to be sinners.
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  Biden's daughter exposed him, but nobody gon' remember, but these are not worth together.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  I know that y'all better differ, but look what they did to Alex Jones.
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  They tryin' to rob him of every single thing he owns.
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  How you get sued for a billy for saying somethin' wrong?
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  They won't stop till everybody bein' watched by drones.
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:25.000]  And look what they did to ya, they want everything.
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  P.P. Morgan, Van Hiss and Calmer, they do F-sting.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:31.000]  They care more about Kanye West than they do sex rings.
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  It's like you want me every speech if you wrap Wayne Beck.
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  And so now you see why they can't have Bryson Gray's music go mainstream
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  and they can't have it on Spotify and you won't hear it on radio stations
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  because his lyrics don't sing about pimping hoes and shootin' cops and all that type of violence.
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  No, he sings about truth and reality and has powerful messages in his lyrics.
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:08.000]  So there you go, though, your first response to the music video put together by the crew here for ya.
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  Yo, that was fire, bro.
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  That was heat, bro.
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  Hey, what's everybody out there did that?
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  Gang, gang.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  Big ups to Rob Dew and Darren McBreen.
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  I know they were the two main forces.
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  I'm not sure who else helped in that matter.
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  I got a little cameo, too.
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  You know, I mean, I gotta be, I gotta have my role in there.
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:27.000]  I mean, come on.
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  That was heat, bro.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  But there we go.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  So I think now, guys, are we going to, we should probably put that up on Bryson Gray's channel and band.video.
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  I don't know if they've done that yet, but we'll get that up on Bryson Gray's channel.
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  And so when you can't put your music out on Spotify, where can people find your music other than just band.video?
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  I was about to say band.video.
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  I try to post it on my Twitter.
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  I post it everywhere I can.
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  But when stuff gets banned, it gets banned.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  Like right now, I uploaded this song like six days ago and it's still not on Spotify or anything.
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  So I don't know, man.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  Band.video.
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  So you're telling me that you, they just, it's just like sits in limbo.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  They don't even tell you what's going on.
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  So I had this issue with tunecore, which is another distribution service at first.
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  Like stuff, stuff will happen.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  It's a distro kid and usually they get it up within three to five days. It's so beautiful.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  But the last two, the last two took like a little longer in this song.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  They just haven't picked it up.
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  I don't know, you know, but it's not the distribution service.
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  It's the stores.
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  Like it's the stores that they have to pick it up.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  Well, I'm not surprised that you have to jump through hoops just to get your, your stuff uploaded.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  You know, a lot of people can relate to that now.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  And so what has been the response though?
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  And the video has probably been seen tens of thousands of times on your Twitter page alone.
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  Maybe more than that.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  I haven't checked the views.
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  What's the response been like?
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  450,000 views on Twitter already.
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  Beautiful.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  Which is, which is insane.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  Everybody loves it.
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  Of course you have a few liberals that hate, but when they hate, they say, I mean, you can rap.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  It's using your talent for something stupid, which is them just saying they like the song subconsciously.
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  So the response has been great.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  And I love it because this song actually like hits home for me personally.
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  Yeah.
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  Why don't you, why don't you rap about like killing cops and pimping hoes?
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  What the hell is your problem, man?
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  Use your talents for something better.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  I know, man.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  I got her about spinning the block, killing the ice, gripping my glock, sending them shots.
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  That's what I got to start doing in my song.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  There you go.
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  That'll be on Spotify in an hour.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  But it really would though.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  They'll cut that.
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  They'll cut that out right now just to put it on Spotify right now.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  Yeah.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  I need to add a little beat to it.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  It'll be uploaded in 10 minutes.
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  You know, what I've found is, is just somebody that enjoys music, listening to music.
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  And I'd like to consider myself a connoisseur of music, if you will.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  I couldn't, I couldn't really listen to rap anymore.
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  Let's say maybe for like the last 10 years, you, you, you mentioned the, I think you called it the drill style.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  But, but aside from that, it seems like there's kind of been this transition to, it's really just kind of dark and like grumbly.
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  And then like, it's really kind of dark energy, the, the uniqueness or the, the diversity that you see in rap.
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  It's not, everything kind of sounds the same to me.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  I could be wrong because I'm just not listening anymore.
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  But when I listen to your songs, I'm like, Hey, this is what rap used to sound like when I was listening to it in the 90s and the 2000s.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  Yes, when you go to the DMX, the Tupac, some people like that.
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  It was my like fight back music and you could tell what they were going through and how they were feeling in their songs.
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  Now, literally all music, you write it is dark.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  It's about like R&P to juice world, but being depressed and being a drug addict.
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  You're talking about being a drug addict or it's pure killing.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  And the reason I bring up drill so much is it's gotten worse.
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  Like at first it was like killing random people on songs and you knew the people were fake.
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  Now it has like turned into like talking about real 16 year old, 15 year old kids that you're a gang killed and mocking their deaths on songs.
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:15.000]  And a lot of conservatives are not even aware of this.
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  Like these kids that get talked about in these songs, their mothers do interviews crying because their parents, these mothers are still alive.
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  And these kids are getting mocked on number one hits.
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  You know what I'm saying?
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  It's very demonic.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  It's very dark and very demonic, man.
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  Do you notice though, I mean, with your audience, I mean, maybe you can see this where they do allow your music to be distributed.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  Do you notice like, is it people that are listening to mainstream rap that are listening to you or is it people that listen to other types of genres that are listening to you?
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  A lot of people that follow me say they use to listen to mainstream rap that they literally stopped because of people like me, people like Tyson James.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  So it was people that was into mainstream rap, but they found rap that they believe is just as good.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  But without the demonic, demonic activity going on in the music, man.
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  Like, you know who King Von is who died like a year and a half ago?
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  No, I'm not familiar.
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  That's the rapper named King Von who like blew up, right?
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  And after his death, he has been like found guilty.
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  Like they have evidence now of him being the murderer or so many people.
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  He's rumored to have killed like seven or eight people.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  And he had beat a murder, got out of jail and started rapping, blew up bragging about the murderous own song saying the street names on songs and everything, man.
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  And after he died, he's guilty of killing like so many people.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  Do you know what record label he was signed to?
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  I think he may have been, I want to say at the beginning he was with Empire.
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  He was under a little dirt.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  So that's okay, but you probably couldn't get a record deal from them, I'm sure.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  I got you.

[2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  This family that is info wars.
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:19.000]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the new world order.
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:37.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.

[2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  And we got Bryson Gray with us for one more segment.
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:34.000]  You can see his new song music video at band.video on his channel.
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  And I was making a joke in the last segment about how you can get signed to a mainstream record label for millions of dollars
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  if you're rapping about pimping hoes, beating women, killing cops, killing kids.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  And you were mentioning an actual example of an individual who got...
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  I guess he's dead now, but he got...
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  I don't know if he got charged, but it came out he was involved in some murders.
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  And he was signed to a mainstream record label.
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  I made a joke right before the break like, I'm sure they wouldn't sign you.
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:06.000]  And you got cut off before you could respond to that.
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:08.000]  But I'm sure that's the case.
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  Like, yeah, you rap about gang banging and killing.
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  We'll sign you to a record label for millions of dollars.
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:18.000]  But if you're Bryson Gray and you rap about how you don't want to abort babies and you love Jesus Christ, we're not interested in you.
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  Fun fact, what I was going to say is I was actually with Empire.
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  I remember when Empire actually first started, I actually know the owner.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  And my rap group in North Carolina was one of the first groups he allowed into the distribution company of Empire outside of like the West Coast.
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  So in North Carolina, it was like one of the first people that they allowed on.
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  But it's like they started hitting me on the back burner when I started talking about more about God and supporting Trump and things of that nature.
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  And I just find it funny that the King of Oz, I'm not mistaken, was with Empire.
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  Nobody had issues with what he was talking about though.
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  Well, and a lot of people might not know your background.
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  You've been making music for more than a decade now.
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  And I believe what year was it you were featured with your group on?
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  Was it 106 in Park?
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  They had you guys performing?
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  Yeah, I was in Park twice when I was in high school.
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  And we had songs and movies that they played on BT all the time in high school.
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  So as I graduated, I had music on the radio in North Carolina.
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  Yeah, I've been like, I've had independent success in music all my life.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  I did EDM music under my moniker King Vodka when I used to drink and have viral songs with EDM music.
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  So yeah, I've been at it like 15, 16 years.
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  You know, it's funny, we kind of have a lot in common as far as this is concerned,
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:42.000]  because let me pose you the question like this.
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  If you want to be a rapper and you want to make millions of dollars
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  and you want your stuff played on the radio and you want the big concert events
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  and the venues and the music festivals, what is that process?
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  If that's what you want to do in the rap game, what does that look like?
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  Well, you have to get a label.
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  You can't do it independently because the label owns everything.
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  They don't access the radio, they don't access the playlist,
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  they don't access to getting your face front everywhere,
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  they don't access to going viral on TikTok, and you have to obey.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  And an example I have is we had a song on the radio about girls shaking their butts
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  and a record label came to us and it wasn't a huge deal.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  It was like $30,000 up front or whatever.
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  And they said, but we had to continue making that type of music.
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  Like that's the music we had to make.
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  That's what they wanted us to be, that group.
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  And I was always interested in making all types of music.
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  And I'm part of the reason the deal fell through
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  because I didn't want to sign a contract and we were getting forced to make one type of song,
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  but they said that's what they wanted.
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  So you have to obey and you have to be a part of the machine.
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  And when you're not a part of the machine,
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  Kanye West over the last week and a half shows you what happens.
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  And you know, it's not exactly the same,
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  but I bet there's a lot of similarities when it comes to political commentary and news.
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  And because I'll have people come to me like, why do you work for Alex Jones?
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  Why do you insist on working for Infowars?
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  It's like, you could make a lot more money doing this.
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  You could make 10 times the money doing this.
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  It's like, you don't get it.
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  You don't get it.
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  To us, success is not how many zeros are at the end of our bank account,
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  especially in today's day and age.
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:28.000]  Success means something totally different to me.
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  Success to me means staying loyal to myself and staying loyal to the people that follow me,
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  staying loyal to the people that raised me and wanting to create a better future.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  If I can create a better future where the people around me can be prosperous
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  and I can maintain human freedom at least in America and self-government,
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  to me, that's success.
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  Whether I have one zero in my bank account or 30 zeros in my bank account.
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  If I don't have those freedoms and I've got $100 million, I'm a failure.
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  I'm a loser.
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  I agree.
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  And I think I've talked to you about this before, but the Trump campaign stopped working with me.
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  Because a lot of the LGBT Trump supporters was reporting my lyrics to them,
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  telling them what I was saying on social media.
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  And by the way, you could have chosen at that time to change your stance.
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:16.000]  You didn't do it.
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  You want to talk about that briefly.
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  Yeah.
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  So when I was there shooting for the Republican National Convention,
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  because I remember it was during COVID, so it was digital.
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  If y'all remember, I was on there.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  And when I was there, they had offered me a contract to perform at all the rallies leading up to the election in November.
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  But in afterwards, I was getting complaints from the LGBT Trump supporters.
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  And they basically asked me to tone it down.
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  I just said no.
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  It was simple.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  You know, here's how I, this is what the Republican Party needs to do.
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  It really needs to have the approach of a big tent where meaning, hey,
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  if you're LGBTQ, but you agree with our beliefs, you're in.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  If you're anti-LGBTQ, but you agree with our beliefs, you're in.
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  If you're black, if you're white, if you're brown, if you're Jewish, if you're Christian, if you're Muslim.
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  I mean, that's not, this is the big tent we need to be in.
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  We need to stop pushing people away because we have a little disagreement.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  We understand we have more in common than we disagree with.
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  So yeah, you know what?
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  Oh, I don't like that Bryson Gray refuses to say that the Bible, you know, doesn't say that homosexuality or
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  sodomy is a good thing.
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  So I don't want to hear from anymore.
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  No, you should still be able to hear from Bryson Gray just if you don't agree with him.
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  That's fine.
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  We all have the same vision for the future.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  We need to come together.
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  Well, that will be consistent in the big tent theory now, wouldn't it?
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  To allow people like me to have my views, to allow the Nick Fuentes of the movement to have their views.
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  But unfortunately, the whole big tent theory is a lot to begin with.
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  What they want is the same thing that LGBT has always wanted.
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  They want complete and utter control.
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  And I mean, in the way they, in the way they got it, right?
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  The Republican Party has went very much more left wing as of late.
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  And, you know, the infiltration happened.
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  It was successful and people like me get pushed to the side.
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  People like Nick Fuentes get pushed to the side.
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  It's part of the game, you know, as long as I stick.
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  Because like you said, it's not all about the money.
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  To me, integrity is way more important than money.
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  So I'd rather have my integrity and have the people that like me,
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  like me for me being really me, rather than me being some fake talking point pundit.
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  Well, I hope you keep getting more popular.
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  And I think this last song is really going to help you out in that endeavor.
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  Because to me, it's, folks, what Bryson Gray does, he makes it look easy,
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  is actually extremely difficult to be a one man show.
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  It's extremely impressive.
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  It just shows his talent.
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  But to me, Bryson, I think you're getting better with time.
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  And I think your last song is one of the greatest works you've put out yet.
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  And I salute you for it.
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  Thank you so much, man.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  Thank you for having me on.
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  Y'all have been the people that supported me since the beginning.
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  So I love it.
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  Of course, brother.
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  So again, folks, go to band.video, Bryson Gray's channel.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  You can see not just his new song and music video,
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  but a lot of his old work is there as well.
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  And you can download it, by the way.
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  There's a download link right there.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  You can put it on your, you can put it on your phone, put it on your computer
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  and listen to Bryson Gray all the time.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  Bryson, thank you so much, man.
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  Thank you, man.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  All right, there goes Bryson Gray.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  You heard the song, folks.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  Seriously.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  Even if you don't like rap, you're probably going to like that one.
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  And follow him on Twitter or go to band.video.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  You can see his work.
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  Now, again, we are happy to have built band.video
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  so that we can put other artists and other commentators
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  and journalists and musicians and everything on there
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  because we want that.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  We actually want the big tent.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  We actually want everybody to be welcome.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  That's part of what we're doing here in Infowars.
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  But it is expensive.
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  It's not cheap.
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  And that's okay because we have a business model
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  that sells supplements to fund it all.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  And they say, look, oh, supplement companies make all this money.
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  Yeah, but it doesn't go towards funding a news organization.
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  It goes into the owner's pockets.
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  That's fine.
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  That's capitalism.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  I'm not complaining.
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  Supplements to make money to fund our news operation.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  No big sponsors.
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  Just you shopping at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  Folks, I'm telling you, some of these supplements
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  are just total game changers.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  Super male vitality is a huge game changer,
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  especially for men.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  Once you get into your 30s, you notice some of that vitality,
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  some of that energy starting to slip away.
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  Well, you can grasp it once again with Super Male Vitality
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  It's 50% off.
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  Same with Super Female Vitality.
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  Just as good for women.
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  50% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  The Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  of different vitamins and minerals
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  that you might not be getting in your daily diet.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  50% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  Get it before it sells out.
[2:42:56.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  It's our best seller.
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:00.000]  We first came out with it five years ago,
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  and it was a moderate seller.
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:04.000]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  and experienced the way it made them feel
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  and how healthy it made them,
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  And it's been sold out for a while,
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:13.000]  but it's finally back in stock.
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion doesn't just supercharge
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  your immune system,
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids,
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  all of the essential vitamins that you need to live
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  and be healthy.
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  And so much of the food is debased.
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  with a product like this.
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:41.000]  Now, there are other great Vitamin Mineral products out there,
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  but this is amongst the very best,
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  and it's a low price, and it funds the Infowars.
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today,
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  getting Vitamin Mineral Fusion finally back in stock
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  at InfowarsStore.com for 50% off.
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:56.000]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion back in stock at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  Look around you.
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  The first thing I predicted from the Globlestone Documents
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  from their own admissions is now happening.
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  Infowars credibility.
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  My credibility has never been higher.
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  And it's because of your backing of this operation
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  stay on air.
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  in the fight together.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:24.000]  So I want to ask all of you today
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  to help keep me on the air.
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations,
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  to pay for 40% of the legal fees,
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  and I can't fund those myself.
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  It's unsustainable.
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  So please visit

[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in,
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  but I could give out.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:54.000]  Thank you for your support.
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:56.000]  Without you, saveinfowars.com

[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  at infowarstore.com
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  and it funds the Info War,
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:41.000]  which is a 360 win.
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine,
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  takes two weeks to kick out on average,
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  you've got to go to infowarstore.com
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:49.000]  and get X3 50% off.
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:55.000]  infowarstore.com
[2:45:55.000 --> 2:45:59.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:02.000]  American citizens should be allowed
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:04.000]  to basically question that event
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  in any way that they deem fit.
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  That's what they want to take away,
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  your ability to speak freely.
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:13.000]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next,
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:15.000]  or they're going to go for Steve Bannon,
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:19.000]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago,
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  but only 28 years.
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  And now, because we've been so successful
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  warning the population of the planet,
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  not just America,
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  we're public enemy number one
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  how successful Info Wars has been
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  because of your past support.
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  So I salute you and I thank you,
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:43.000]  and I ask you now to critical juncture of the battle,
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  free double your efforts
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  by visiting infowarstore.com

[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  1776 is the promo code.

[2:46:53.000 --> 2:47:15.000]  And I thank you all for your support.
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  Okay, this is my last segment today
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  on the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  Jay Dyer taking over.
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  I'm going to be back hosting the war room
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:45.000]  where I'm going to get into all the big CDC vaccine news.
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  I'm going to get into the latest with the child grooming
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  that's going on in the classrooms by the liberals,
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  as well as some other news and a guest in studio.
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  Now, the breaking news,
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  CDC has just voted to add COVID-19 vaccines
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  to children's immunization schedule.
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  There's a lot that goes into that,
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  and there's going to be a lot of pushback as well.
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  So I plan on covering all of that on the war room.
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  Now, I want to play that vote for you
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  so that you can just see this.
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  This is big breaking news,
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  probably really the top story now.
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  And so yesterday, they did the same thing
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  with the most vulnerable,
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  the youth that are in, let's say, foster care,
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  stuff like that, that don't have their biological parents.
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  They got to take the COVID-19 vaccine.
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  Now they're just saying, all kids,
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  if you want to go to school, you have to take it too.
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  Now, of course, you don't.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  So there's going to be a lot of litigation.
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  There's going to be a lot of religious exemptions
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  and everything else.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  But here is the vote.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  CDC unanimously says all children
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  should take the COVID-19 vaccine.
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  We have everybody in?
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:58.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  We'll proceed with the vote.
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  So as a reminder, please state your name,
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  whether you have an conference,
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  and your vote in a digital press conference.
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  I'm going to start right now with Dr. Bell.
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  Bell, no conflicts, yes.
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  Thank you.
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  Ms. McNally.
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  No conflicts, yes.
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  Thank you.
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  Dr. Lair.
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  Lair, no conflicts, yes.
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  Ms. Bahta.
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  Bahta, no conflicts, yes.
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  Dr. Brooks.
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  Brooks, no conflicts, yes.
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  Dr. Daly.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  Daly, no conflicts, yes.
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  Dr. Sanchez.
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  Sanchez, no conflicts, yes.
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  Dr. Shaw.
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  Shaw, no conflicts, yes.
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  Dr. Long.
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  Long, no conflict. Yes.
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  Dr. Cotton.
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  Cotton, no conflicts, yes.
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  Dr. Sienius.
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  Sienius, no conflicts. Yes.
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  Dr. Pailing.
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  Pailing, no conflict, yes.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  Lee, no conflicts, yes.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  Dr. Talbot.
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  Talbot, no conflicts, yes.
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  Dr. Chen?
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  Chen, no conflicts, yes.
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  Thank you.
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  Dr. Warren?
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  In the motion passed, 15 unanimously in favor.
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  Now imagine voting to make children take a vaccine that has not been tested
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  and that has already killed more than 10,000, more than 30,000 people that we know of.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  And I've got more news on it. We're going to cover it coming up in the war room, folks.
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  But you know, and see, here's the thing, too.
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  They want to make a situation where, oh, you can't even question the doctors,
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  or you can't even say their name, or you're going to get sued, or you're going to be called a terrorist.
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  That's the environment they want this to go down in because that's how totalitarians,
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  that's how authoritarians work.
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  And that's now the type of country we live in.
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  But no, you should remember the names of all of those doctors
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  because when this vaccine gets forced into children's arms and they get sterilized and they die,
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:17.000]  you're going to know that those are the doctors that voted to do it.
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  And I would also say, and I'm going to have more on this coming up later on the war room, too,
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  I would remember the names of those doctors because in five years,
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:30.000]  they'll all be working for FISA, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and AstraZeneca,
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  making millions of dollars.
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  And now you know why, because that's how it works, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:42.000]  Now, of course, Info Wars was years ahead of this story.
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:46.000]  We knew all of this was coming since they announced that we were in a pandemic.
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  We knew one of the ultimate goals was the forced vaccination of sterilization vaccines,
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  deadly vaccines, poisonous vaccines, mRNA vaccines.
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:01.000]  That was always the goal.
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:04.000]  The pandemic was just a tool to get to this point.
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  Now we are here.
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  And it was Alex Jones that predicted it years ago.
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  We played the clip earlier.
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  Now, as Alex is out, we're going to be playing a lot of these classic timeless Alex Jones clips.
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  Alex Jones was right clips, sometimes dating back 20 years, sometimes dating back five years,
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  sometimes dating back a year.
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  Like this one, this is the case for Alex Jones.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  Here are big names, celebrities, politicos, talking about why we need Alex Jones.
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  This is from January of this year.
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  He has been so canceled.
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  How much heat have you gotten for being friends with him and having him on the show?
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  A lot, but I don't pay attention.
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  Okay, yeah.
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  I just, I can justify it.
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  He's a wild entertainer and a brilliant man.
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  Isn't he fantastic?
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:08.000]  And no one is perfect.
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  I've known Alex for like more than 20 years.
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  I've hung out with that guy.
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  It's like, that is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  Shout out to Alex Jones.
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:22.000]  We love you.
[2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  Alex Jones is a journalist and member of the media.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  End of story.
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  Recently, many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  from broadcaster Alex Jones.
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  There's a reason why the mainstream media calls a guy like him a palm thrower or conspiracy theorist
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:42.000]  because they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out.
[2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  Why are the most powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  radio show host in Texas that they're willing to lose business in order to make him shut up?
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  He runs a media organization.
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:54:00.000]  And so when the January 6th committee subpoenas him, they're basically violating our first
[2:54:00.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  member protections.
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  The Department of Justice says not only is it investigating what happened inside the
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  Capitol, but the conspirators and instigators who may have started this whole thing.
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  Now the committees decided to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the right,
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:16.000]  Alex Jones.
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  Yes, journalists.
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  The House Committee investigating the deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol is subpoenaing
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  Trump allies Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  The committee says he helped organize the rally ahead of the riots.
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  Alex Jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on January 6th.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  Alex Jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on January 6th.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  We're not running interference for Alex Jones and we're not guessing about it.
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:08.000]  We happen to know this for a fact.
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  Alex Jones is a journalist the same as Brian Stelter and Jake Tapper and Don Lemon are.
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  Absolutely.
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  I was about to say the same thing.
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  There's a wide difference.
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  Don't insult Alex that way.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  Well, yeah, Alex Jones never lied us into a war.
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  Right, right, right.
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:23.000]  True.
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  And if Jones said that with Tony Fauci, he would ask him real questions, just as journalists
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  are supposed to do.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  He wouldn't just slobber all over it.
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  Epstein, he was way ahead with that.
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  He told me about Epstein a f***ing decade ago.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:40.000]  Alex detailed all of that.
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  Alex Jones, info wars.
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  The media has tarnished him with all sorts of name calling, conspiracy theorist, bomb
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  thrower.
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:54.000]  The one thing that I know about this gentleman, Alex Jones, is that he loves this country.
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  He is as smart as a whip.
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  He absolutely believes in what he believes in.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  And he also does his research and his homework.
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:10.000]  Coolie compare Hotez's views on COVID to say Alex Jones's views on COVID and ask yourself,
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  who's saner?
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  It's not even close.
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  He's incredibly detailed in his research.
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  He loves this country.
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  He is a patriot and he's somebody who we better listen to or others in this country better
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  listen to.
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  He wants to say that Tucker Carlson is the new Alex Jones.
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  They're no vaccine passports.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  That's insane.
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  It's Alex Jones stuff.
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  And by the way, just so you know, as proof, if you want to get a job, you'll need your
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  vaccine papers.
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:45.200]  You know, it really is quite a phenomenon now that I think that in a way we're still adjusting
[2:56:45.200 --> 2:56:53.600]  to every day here, we're in the world that Alex Jones warned us about 20 plus years ago.
[2:56:53.600 --> 2:56:56.320]  We're in it now.
[2:56:56.320 --> 2:57:06.000]  And so now you say, how do we get out of it or how do we identify the causes and the individuals
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  that brought us here?
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:13.320]  As you got mass starvation around the planet, you've got obviously what's going on in America
[2:57:13.320 --> 2:57:16.360]  right now with the open border invasion.
[2:57:16.360 --> 2:57:22.040]  And now the mandatory vaccinations and the inflation and the consumer price index and
[2:57:22.040 --> 2:57:23.040]  all of it.
[2:57:23.040 --> 2:57:24.040]  I mean, we're in it now.
[2:57:24.040 --> 2:57:25.840]  So now you have to accept it.
[2:57:25.840 --> 2:57:29.560]  All right, Alex Jones and Info Wars was right.
[2:57:29.560 --> 2:57:31.620]  What are we going to do now?
[2:57:31.620 --> 2:57:37.960]  And we got a midterm election in 19 days, which is how Americans solve these problems.
[2:57:37.960 --> 2:57:45.680]  But most Americans don't trust our elections now and for good reason.
[2:57:45.680 --> 2:57:51.840]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[2:57:51.840 --> 2:57:57.520]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[2:57:57.520 --> 2:58:01.160]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:04.680]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[2:58:04.680 --> 2:58:10.640]  This came over and all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[2:58:10.640 --> 2:58:15.880]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[3:00:05.680 --> 3:00:09.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones, I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis and we have
[3:00:09.760 --> 3:00:16.320]  been lecturing through the excellent text from the Romanian historian, Ioan Ratsu, and
[3:00:16.320 --> 3:00:20.000]  the text is, of course, the Milner Fabian conspiracy.
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:25.880]  This is not any kind of wild tinfoil hat nonsense, this is a really well-documented, hundreds
[3:00:25.880 --> 3:00:32.880]  of footnotes, text about the history of the Fabian Society, support from Big Capital and
[3:00:32.880 --> 3:00:40.240]  the Blue Bloods, the Royal Society, the elites of London, Cecer, Cecil Rhodes, Milner, Rothschild,
[3:00:40.240 --> 3:00:46.240]  et cetera, setting the model for how the Fabian Society would be constructed as a pseudo-liberal
[3:00:46.240 --> 3:00:53.000]  pseudo-party of the people, right, and the party they created is actually the labor party.
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:00:57.440]  They also controlled a lot of fake right-wingers as well, so this is not a left-wing right-wing
[3:00:57.440 --> 3:00:58.440]  dialectic.
[3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:03.960]  In fact, Churchill, we were talking about the last time I was on, when we got to this
[3:01:03.960 --> 3:01:08.200]  point in the text, Churchill actually had a lot of influence from these circles and
[3:01:08.200 --> 3:01:13.400]  appointed several of his cabinet directly from the Fabian Society.
[3:01:13.400 --> 3:01:19.120]  The Fabian Society would go on to exercise tremendous influence throughout this period,
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:23.560]  all the way up until the 1990s when we have Tony Blair, Miliband, right, David Miliband,
[3:01:23.560 --> 3:01:30.280]  all of these people coming out of this Fabian Society idea of international socialism based
[3:01:30.280 --> 3:01:38.040]  around the breaking down of every single family and national firewall and border.
[3:01:38.040 --> 3:01:42.120]  Nationalize everything is what the Fabians said, and they said to do this, especially
[3:01:42.120 --> 3:01:48.000]  when it came to not just the resources and the allocation of social welfare or something
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:51.960]  like this, they actually meant nationalizing the family.
[3:01:51.960 --> 3:01:57.640]  Your children are not your own, and the property of the state was the argument of the Fabians.
[3:01:57.640 --> 3:02:05.120]  They wanted total state-mandated education, total state-mandated welfare, even an army
[3:02:05.120 --> 3:02:08.160]  educational core they talked about.
[3:02:08.160 --> 3:02:13.520]  This brings to mind the kind of militarization that we hear about in communist countries,
[3:02:13.520 --> 3:02:18.800]  right, and we'll take back to Obama talking about a civilian core that would be just as
[3:02:18.800 --> 3:02:25.480]  strong as the other military organizations, and that's exactly a Fabian idea, right?
[3:02:25.480 --> 3:02:31.240]  So we have to keep in mind that Fabian socialism is the model, it is the key to understanding
[3:02:31.240 --> 3:02:35.560]  the kind of liberal world order that we're going into, which is not a hardcore Marxist
[3:02:35.560 --> 3:02:43.680]  order, it's not a hardcore free market order, it is a free market big monopoly capital order
[3:02:43.680 --> 3:02:49.560]  that funds and runs basically socialism for the masses.
[3:02:49.560 --> 3:02:53.920]  The people who are the oligarchs, the zillionaires on the top of it, they're exempt from the
[3:02:53.920 --> 3:02:55.920]  rules that the masses are put under.
[3:02:55.920 --> 3:03:04.600]  It's a total wealth confiscation, collectivization scam, as we've seen throughout these talks.
[3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:09.920]  Rossiou notes that George Bernard Shaw, this luminary ideologue of the Fabian socialist,
[3:03:09.920 --> 3:03:16.560]  in his book, The Institution of Social Democracy, noted that all facts considered, the whole
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:19.960]  of society ought to be under direct state control.
[3:03:19.960 --> 3:03:26.680]  The state itself should be under Fabian socialist control, this logically means that total control
[3:03:26.680 --> 3:03:32.200]  by the Fabian society of all areas of society would amount to a true democratic society.
[3:03:32.200 --> 3:03:36.520]  So notice that terms like democracy and these kinds of things, for the people, this is all
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:37.960]  nonsense, it's all just slogans.
[3:03:37.960 --> 3:03:45.400]  It doesn't really mean anything other than big state capitalism, which is big state socialism.
[3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:46.640]  That's exactly the Fabian model.
[3:03:46.640 --> 3:03:53.480]  You could look at something like China as an example of big state capitalism that perfectly
[3:03:53.480 --> 3:04:00.680]  fits the kind of third way position or model that people like the Fabians are talking about.
[3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:06.680]  Where some of the other Fabian socialist institutions that have, as we said, spread all over Europe,
[3:04:06.680 --> 3:04:10.720]  the United Nations is one of these institutions, we're actually going to get in a moment to
[3:04:10.720 --> 3:04:13.080]  the institutions that the Fabians actually set up.
[3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:17.680]  One of those key institutions was the Royal Economic Society, isn't that fascinating?
[3:04:17.680 --> 3:04:25.480]  So the Royal Society, a lot of these Royal Societies directly modeled on the Rhodes-Millner
[3:04:25.480 --> 3:04:30.040]  Society and Secret Society that Rhodes and Millner set up.
[3:04:30.040 --> 3:04:34.800]  They also set up a plethora of NGOs, think tanks and foundations.
[3:04:34.800 --> 3:04:40.040]  So this sets the model for how the world is run now in terms of these think tanks, NGOs
[3:04:40.040 --> 3:04:46.240]  and non-governmental, basically policy bureaus that sit around and make up policy with no
[3:04:46.240 --> 3:04:47.240]  connection to the people.
[3:04:47.240 --> 3:04:50.440]  They're unelected bureaucrats sitting in all these think tanks.
[3:04:50.440 --> 3:04:51.440]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:04:51.440 --> 3:04:52.440]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[3:04:52.440 --> 3:04:57.800]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, Jay's Analysis, we'll be right back.
[3:04:57.800 --> 3:05:08.520]  X3, X3, it stands for Tri-Iodine, are all three types of iodine that the body needs
[3:05:08.520 --> 3:05:11.040]  to be healthy and survive and thrive.
[3:05:11.040 --> 3:05:15.480]  It boosts your libido, your energy, your stamina, your immune system.
[3:05:15.480 --> 3:05:18.840]  X3 is the ultimate iodine product on the market.
[3:05:18.840 --> 3:05:25.720]  It's back in stock at InfowarsTour.com for 50% off and it funds the Infowar.
[3:05:25.720 --> 3:05:27.840]  So many of you are on the fence.
[3:05:27.840 --> 3:05:30.600]  You know our information is powerful, you know it's changed the world.
[3:05:30.600 --> 3:05:41.520]  Try the products at InfowarsTour.com and start with X3 Tri-Iodine, 50% off InfowarsTour.com.
[3:05:41.520 --> 3:05:43.520]  It takes about two weeks to kick in.
[3:05:43.520 --> 3:05:47.920]  An aspirin kicks in in 30 minutes, Tylenol kicks in in 30 minutes, this kicks in in
[3:05:47.920 --> 3:05:49.880]  about two weeks on average.
[3:05:49.880 --> 3:05:51.800]  You need to experience it.
[3:05:51.800 --> 3:05:56.560]  That way, you'll be impressed InfowarsTour.com, X3.
[3:06:21.800 --> 3:06:26.240]  Totally secret, but kind of an inner secret government that the people, the masses don't
[3:06:26.240 --> 3:06:29.840]  know are running the British Empire at this time.
[3:06:29.840 --> 3:06:34.840]  And that's the model for how the world government in our day is being run by these unelective
[3:06:34.840 --> 3:06:40.880]  bureaucrats that are internationalists sitting on panels and sitting on think tanks, Bilderberg,
[3:06:40.880 --> 3:06:46.000]  CFR, trilateral, even things like United Nations, the CDC, all of these kinds of things, right,
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:51.760]  which takes their marching orders from Rockefeller Foundation directing CDC, directing these
[3:06:51.760 --> 3:06:58.640]  things as we saw in the COOFID crisis, the Fabians had this idea on the basis of the
[3:06:58.640 --> 3:07:02.960]  Milner-Rose Roundtable Groups to set up dozens of these.
[3:07:02.960 --> 3:07:06.440]  They set up the Imperial College of London, that's a Fabian institution.
[3:07:06.440 --> 3:07:11.640]  They set up the Noel Baxter Trust, they set up the National Union of Students, the National
[3:07:11.640 --> 3:07:17.200]  Institute of Economic Social Research, the London Business School, the Economic Social
[3:07:17.200 --> 3:07:21.640]  Research Council, the John Smith Memorial Fund, the Runnymede Trust, the Institute for
[3:07:21.640 --> 3:07:25.800]  Public Policy Research, on and on and on.
[3:07:25.800 --> 3:07:30.840]  And what we've noticed from this is that this is really just a kind of tax avoidance scheme,
[3:07:30.840 --> 3:07:37.800]  it's all of that, yeah, but according to the plan of the Fabians being directed by this
[3:07:37.800 --> 3:07:43.560]  real sort of inner secret society, their plan was to fully permeate society and they did
[3:07:43.560 --> 3:07:44.560]  that.
[3:07:44.560 --> 3:07:52.440]  So, full permeation by the 1990s, again, doesn't mean that the liberal outer labor party, remember
[3:07:52.440 --> 3:07:57.880]  in 1984 there's the inner party and the outer party, labor party is the outer party, there's
[3:07:57.880 --> 3:08:03.720]  a fake right wing in the UK as well, they don't matter, they're irrelevant, they are
[3:08:03.720 --> 3:08:08.520]  cuck-servatives who don't serve any purpose other than to gradually become more and more
[3:08:08.520 --> 3:08:10.640]  liberal.
[3:08:10.640 --> 3:08:15.160]  And they had a lot of influence, as we said, in the Eastern seaboard elite by recruiting
[3:08:15.160 --> 3:08:21.440]  and putting in professors at Harvard, at Princeton Yale, et cetera, and David Rockefeller studying
[3:08:21.440 --> 3:08:29.960]  under one of the key Fabians, I think his name was Hasker, or what was his name, Herald
[3:08:29.960 --> 3:08:37.000]  Lasky at Harvard, and they recruited one of their top admin and consultant men, Walter
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:42.880]  Lipman, Lipman Consulting and this kind of stuff, Lipman was a dedicated 100% committed
[3:08:42.880 --> 3:08:48.160]  Fabian socialist, they also had John Maynard Keynes as one of their key figures, Keynesian
[3:08:48.160 --> 3:08:54.480]  economics of course dominates modern neoliberal theory of economics, and Keynes would go on
[3:08:54.480 --> 3:09:00.200]  to consult and help to establish World Bank and the IMF, so you can begin to see that
[3:09:00.200 --> 3:09:06.120]  this is really the inner core of who set up and established the power structures of the
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:09.400]  Anglo-American establishment that we're still living under today.
[3:09:09.400 --> 3:09:14.840]  It is this same power structure that Klaus and company are a part of.
[3:09:14.840 --> 3:09:18.800]  If you saw Johnny Bedmore's articles and the research of say, Whitney Webb, you've noticed
[3:09:18.800 --> 3:09:24.720]  that they've uncovered that Klaus and company, you know, go back to really Kissinger and
[3:09:24.720 --> 3:09:30.400]  the Harvard research project and the CIA's, and that's no surprise, that's who we would
[3:09:30.400 --> 3:09:36.040]  assume set up these institutions, and that's because that institution, CIA, et cetera, is
[3:09:36.040 --> 3:09:40.120]  part of this institution here, CIA really being set up as kind of the private army of
[3:09:40.120 --> 3:09:45.680]  the Rockefellers themselves, that's their origin, so to speak, it's this same click
[3:09:45.680 --> 3:09:51.960]  involved in this, and even before the establishment of the CIA or the OSS, you had a private intelligence
[3:09:51.960 --> 3:09:59.000]  networks known as the Inquiry under Woodrow Wilson also working for these same people,
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:02.880]  the Anglo-American establishment, banking and royal elite.
[3:10:02.880 --> 3:10:09.400]  For example, the Fabians didn't just stop at these inner sort of ideologues that were
[3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:13.320]  part of the academic establishment, they also went on to recruit people like Gandhi.
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:18.840]  You know, Gandhi was a member of the Fabian Society as well as other members of the elite
[3:10:18.840 --> 3:10:25.520]  in India who were brought into believing that they were fighting against capitalist oppression
[3:10:25.520 --> 3:10:31.440]  by becoming a Fabian socialist itself, an institution created and run by some of the
[3:10:31.440 --> 3:10:33.760]  wealthiest people out there.
[3:10:33.760 --> 3:10:37.480]  As we said, subversion was key to the Fabian strategy.
[3:10:37.480 --> 3:10:42.680]  Their idea was to create various experimental socialist states, the early phases of the
[3:10:42.680 --> 3:10:46.720]  establishment of the state of Israel were, for example, in the Kabutzes and this kind
[3:10:46.720 --> 3:10:47.720]  of stuff.
[3:10:47.720 --> 3:10:51.360]  This was an experiment in socialism.
[3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:57.360]  Even the character of Ingalls himself said that he supported the approach of the Fabians,
[3:10:57.360 --> 3:11:00.000]  so he didn't really have a problem with the approach of the Fabians and how they went
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:01.200]  about this.
[3:11:01.200 --> 3:11:05.880]  The Fabians set up all kinds of other groups, as I mentioned before, I think they set up
[3:11:05.880 --> 3:11:10.360]  the Rainbow Circle, the Coefficient's Club, and again, subversion was crucial because
[3:11:10.360 --> 3:11:16.040]  subversion is the way that you can run a worldwide conspiracy from an inner group using an outer
[3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:23.280]  core and outer cutout that's under the guise of humanitarian and liberal aid and cover.
[3:11:23.280 --> 3:11:27.680]  Now, in today's geopolitical world, we know about the color revolutions and this kind
[3:11:27.680 --> 3:11:28.680]  of stuff.
[3:11:28.680 --> 3:11:33.800]  We know that Soros funded and utilized color revolutions in a lot of other Soviet-block
[3:11:33.800 --> 3:11:34.800]  countries.
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:40.640]  He's talked about this publicly, but he wasn't really the one that pioneered that, nor did
[3:11:40.640 --> 3:11:46.920]  Gene Sharp and the technology of nonviolent revolutionary change.
[3:11:46.920 --> 3:11:52.240]  That was actually pioneered by these people, setting up these foundations, things NGOs,
[3:11:52.240 --> 3:11:55.120]  and that's how the world is still run today.
[3:11:55.120 --> 3:11:58.440]  The world is not run by the government officials.
[3:11:58.440 --> 3:12:03.800]  The government officials, they have a degree of power, especially locally speaking, but
[3:12:03.800 --> 3:12:07.560]  in terms of DC and these kinds of places, they submit to these kinds of people.
[3:12:07.560 --> 3:12:11.040]  They submit to people that have tremendous amounts of wealth.
[3:12:11.040 --> 3:12:15.200]  I mean, who do you think has more power, somebody with billions of dollars or a senator that
[3:12:15.200 --> 3:12:16.200]  makes $250,000 a year?
[3:12:16.200 --> 3:12:21.280]  Of course, the senators get inside deals, so they know about stock trading, so they end
[3:12:21.280 --> 3:12:25.120]  up coming out of there with millions of dollars, but who has more power, a millionaire or a
[3:12:25.120 --> 3:12:26.120]  billionaire?
[3:12:26.120 --> 3:12:27.120]  I wonder.
[3:12:27.120 --> 3:12:31.400]  The idea was to create a worldwide Fabian Empire.
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:34.560]  In my opinion, I think the British Empire was kind of really just a cutout for this,
[3:12:34.560 --> 3:12:38.400]  and that they thought that they could create a Fabian Socialist World Empire and run it
[3:12:38.400 --> 3:12:40.120]  from behind the scenes.
[3:12:40.120 --> 3:12:45.240]  British Empire didn't succeed in doing that, and of course, the British Empire collapsed
[3:12:45.240 --> 3:12:52.240]  into the Pax Americana, but it was this same group of elites that ended up bringing America
[3:12:52.240 --> 3:12:59.480]  back under the authority and under the power, the secret rulership of these circles, these
[3:12:59.480 --> 3:13:02.400]  people, the same groups.
[3:13:02.400 --> 3:13:09.520]  Now the idea is America can be dispensed with because the global institutions that the American
[3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:14.840]  and Eastern Seaboard and Anglo-American establishment elites set up has now come to fruition.
[3:13:14.840 --> 3:13:16.600]  We now have the make for international settlements.
[3:13:16.600 --> 3:13:18.440]  We now have the United Nations.
[3:13:18.440 --> 3:13:25.120]  If those can achieve enough power, it can shed the very country that helped to establish
[3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:26.120]  it, the United States.
[3:13:26.120 --> 3:13:29.280]  Now, I'm not halting all the people in the United States, I'm saying that the elites
[3:13:29.280 --> 3:13:32.760]  of the United States, the Anglo-American establishment elites, they're the ones that
[3:13:32.760 --> 3:13:33.760]  set this up.
[3:13:33.760 --> 3:13:37.480]  They're the ones that are using countries, especially the United States, as the engine
[3:13:37.480 --> 3:13:44.800]  of this kind of stuff, and that's why we've been in such a battle for the control of America
[3:13:44.800 --> 3:13:49.840]  in regard to these elites taking over, subverting the country more and more and more every time
[3:13:49.840 --> 3:13:54.240]  there's another election, and we find it getting worse and worse and worse.
[3:13:54.240 --> 3:13:55.480]  But now people are starting to wake up.
[3:13:55.480 --> 3:13:59.560]  Now people are realizing, hey, wait a minute, there actually is some kind of inner cabal
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:06.040]  like what we see at Davos, who's now uncloaked and openly said, you're going to have a circular
[3:14:06.040 --> 3:14:12.120]  economy where you don't owe anything, guess who came up with that, these people, right?
[3:14:12.120 --> 3:14:17.040]  Because the Marxists didn't want there to be an alliance, the hardcore ones, no alliance
[3:14:17.040 --> 3:14:22.720]  with these capitalists, we got to get the workers to rise up and kill everybody, right?
[3:14:22.720 --> 3:14:25.800]  Seize the means of production, that didn't happen.
[3:14:25.800 --> 3:14:31.080]  And so they reformed Marxism to align with monopoly capitalism.
[3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:33.320]  This is the key to understanding the whole of the 20th century.
[3:14:33.320 --> 3:14:38.240]  I mean, if you don't understand this, you cannot understand what's happening today,
[3:14:38.240 --> 3:14:42.120]  because if you're stuck in, for example, the Cold War Boomer mindset, and you think that
[3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:48.680]  this is a bunch of commies and Marxists in China or in Moscow, that's not the locus of
[3:14:48.680 --> 3:14:50.200]  this power, right?
[3:14:50.200 --> 3:14:54.160]  They are moving more and more power, for example, to China, these people, these elites.
[3:14:54.160 --> 3:14:59.000]  But that's not who set up this 20th century, 21st century world order.
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:02.120]  It's the wealthiest people on the planet.
[3:15:02.120 --> 3:15:07.800]  They're behind this, not a bunch of low level commies and Marxists in some other country.
[3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:12.720]  Those people couldn't have come to power without these people helping them come to power.
[3:15:12.720 --> 3:15:16.120]  The OSS trained Mao's guerrillas.
[3:15:16.120 --> 3:15:23.520]  Mao was a Yali, Yale, and China student before he came to power.
[3:15:23.520 --> 3:15:28.960]  The only way to understand the 20th century is to understand this and where we are now.
[3:15:28.960 --> 3:15:33.760]  Then you will understand, hey, wait a minute, it's the Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 that are
[3:15:33.760 --> 3:15:41.600]  the real enemies that are pushing the soft socialism, the UBI, the social credit score,
[3:15:41.600 --> 3:15:42.600]  all of that.
[3:15:42.600 --> 3:15:43.720]  That is this stuff.
[3:15:43.720 --> 3:15:46.440]  That is total control by technocracy.
[3:15:46.440 --> 3:15:47.560]  These people are technocrats.
[3:15:47.560 --> 3:15:49.280]  They become technocrats.
[3:15:49.280 --> 3:15:51.480]  They influence the technocrats.
[3:15:51.480 --> 3:15:52.480]  No going anywhere.
[3:15:52.480 --> 3:16:07.480]  You're
[3:16:07.480 --> 3:16:08.880]  I can send it up in the media.
[3:16:08.880 --> 3:16:10.560]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[3:16:10.560 --> 3:16:12.520]  And over the years, you have come to the table.
[3:16:12.520 --> 3:16:15.000]  You have stepped to the plate so many times
[3:16:15.000 --> 3:16:17.280]  and kept Info Wars and Free Speech on the air,
[3:16:17.280 --> 3:16:18.240]  and I thank you.
[3:16:18.240 --> 3:16:20.520]  But now, I have my own legal bills
[3:16:20.520 --> 3:16:22.760]  that have reached the point that I can't pay them,
[3:16:22.760 --> 3:16:23.960]  and I need your support.
[3:16:23.960 --> 3:16:26.920]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward,

[3:17:02.280 --> 3:17:03.560]  comes after you.
[3:17:03.560 --> 3:17:05.160]  Now, I knew that.

[3:17:59.960 --> 3:18:02.400]  It's not hype that your support of infowars
[3:18:02.400 --> 3:18:04.480]  is the reason we were able to do this.

[3:18:06.200 --> 3:18:08.880]  Now, you know about fluoride, the bad halogen
[3:18:08.880 --> 3:18:10.080]  on the periodic table.
[3:18:10.080 --> 3:18:12.520]  Well, high-quality iodine is the good halogen,
[3:18:12.520 --> 3:18:14.000]  and does the opposite of fluoride.
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:15.160]  And when you've got it in your body,
[3:18:15.160 --> 3:18:16.800]  it doesn't just supercharge your cells.
[3:18:16.800 --> 3:18:17.800]  It does just give you more energy.
[3:18:17.800 --> 3:18:19.400]  It doesn't just boost your immune system,
[3:18:19.400 --> 3:18:22.960]  but it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride,
[3:18:22.960 --> 3:18:25.520]  chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[3:18:25.520 --> 3:18:28.600]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3
[3:18:28.600 --> 3:18:31.480]  to kick you out on average, take a few drops every day,
[3:18:31.480 --> 3:18:33.960]  and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[3:18:33.960 --> 3:18:35.400]  Plus, it funds the infowar.
[3:18:35.400 --> 3:18:39.160]  So what do you have to lose but taking action?

[3:19:06.240 --> 3:19:07.480]  Now you know about fluoride,
[3:19:07.480 --> 3:19:10.120]  the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[3:19:10.120 --> 3:19:12.560]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen,

[3:19:56.840 --> 3:20:00.640]  leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:20:00.640 --> 3:20:02.400]  of the New World Order.
[3:20:02.400 --> 3:20:04.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:20:07.920 --> 3:20:13.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:13.640 --> 3:20:15.040]  You know, we've been going through this text
[3:20:15.040 --> 3:20:17.520]  talking about the Fabians and their history,
[3:20:17.520 --> 3:20:21.000]  and how that's the overriding key ideological component
[3:20:21.000 --> 3:20:23.840]  to understanding what's going on with the Great Reset,
[3:20:23.840 --> 3:20:27.680]  in the emerging global order of technocrats.
[3:20:27.680 --> 3:20:28.720]  And I wanna play this clip,
[3:20:28.720 --> 3:20:32.040]  which is really just all these people in their own words,
[3:20:32.040 --> 3:20:34.520]  saying all the things that you've heard me covering,
[3:20:34.520 --> 3:20:37.440]  the same elite structure saying 100 years ago.
[3:20:37.440 --> 3:20:39.280]  So we're gonna see that what they're saying today
[3:20:39.280 --> 3:20:43.040]  is exactly identical to what all these clowns and goobers
[3:20:43.040 --> 3:20:44.760]  were saying 100 years ago.
[3:20:44.760 --> 3:20:45.640]  But let's go to that clip,
[3:20:45.640 --> 3:20:48.360]  and I'm gonna comment over it as we watch this,
[3:20:48.360 --> 3:20:49.760]  and you'll be able to hear what they're saying
[3:20:49.760 --> 3:20:54.760]  from their own mouths.
[3:20:57.280 --> 3:20:58.840]  You'll own nothing and be happy.
[3:20:58.840 --> 3:21:02.760]  We cannot hide away from human population growth.
[3:21:02.760 --> 3:21:06.120]  Because, you know, it underlies so many of the other problems.
[3:21:06.120 --> 3:21:08.800]  All these things we talk about wouldn't be a problem
[3:21:08.800 --> 3:21:10.120]  if the world is the way it is.
[3:21:10.120 --> 3:21:11.960]  It's the size of the population
[3:21:11.960 --> 3:21:14.880]  that there was 500 years ago.
[3:21:14.880 --> 3:21:17.480]  At this pivotal moment,
[3:21:17.480 --> 3:21:20.560]  I see several priorities for the global agenda.
[3:21:21.640 --> 3:21:26.640]  We must continue to fight against the global pandemic.
[3:21:26.960 --> 3:21:31.080]  We must revitalize the global economy
[3:21:31.080 --> 3:21:34.360]  and accelerate its transition to net zero.
[3:21:35.360 --> 3:21:39.600]  I'm just trying to get the opportunity for this pandemic
[3:21:39.600 --> 3:21:43.560]  has provided an opportunity for a recent golden opportunity
[3:21:43.560 --> 3:21:45.000]  to build something better.
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:47.800]  We call it the Great Reset.
[3:21:47.800 --> 3:21:51.320]  Through my sustainable markets initiative
[3:21:51.320 --> 3:21:52.520]  and the Great Reset,
[3:21:52.520 --> 3:21:54.840]  I want to achieve a great reset
[3:21:54.840 --> 3:21:56.800]  to rewrite Japan's blueprint.
[3:21:56.800 --> 3:22:01.160]  You have finished right state during the Great Reset.
[3:22:01.160 --> 3:22:04.640]  Well, we're about to see, or it's been announced,
[3:22:04.640 --> 3:22:07.240]  that we're about to see a great reset.
[3:22:07.240 --> 3:22:09.480]  I'm hopeful that we're gonna have a great reset.
[3:22:09.480 --> 3:22:11.560]  Next year's event titled The Great Reset,
[3:22:11.560 --> 3:22:12.400]  the pandemic presented opportunity.
[3:22:12.400 --> 3:22:13.720]  Notice it's coordinated.
[3:22:13.720 --> 3:22:15.120]  We're all saying the same line.
[3:22:15.120 --> 3:22:19.680]  Next year, vaccine policy is economic policy.
[3:22:19.680 --> 3:22:21.840]  Vaccines are economic policy.
[3:22:21.840 --> 3:22:25.120]  Even a higher priority than the traditional
[3:22:25.120 --> 3:22:27.680]  We'll be able to have commerce and lecture
[3:22:27.680 --> 3:22:28.640]  without your stabbings.
[3:22:28.640 --> 3:22:30.440]  Because without it,
[3:22:30.440 --> 3:22:35.240]  we cannot turn the fate of the world economy around.
[3:22:35.240 --> 3:22:36.600]  So the economy collapsed,
[3:22:36.600 --> 3:22:38.040]  we wouldn't be for vaccine.
[3:22:38.040 --> 3:22:40.480]  Public health, as far as I know,
[3:22:40.480 --> 3:22:44.200]  because you could have probably had access
[3:22:44.200 --> 3:22:46.280]  to billions of dollars,
[3:22:46.280 --> 3:22:47.960]  but you did it yourself.
[3:22:47.960 --> 3:22:49.120]  You did it alone,
[3:22:49.120 --> 3:22:52.480]  together with your partner, also biotech.
[3:22:52.480 --> 3:22:57.960]  Now, I just said you made a major announcement,
[3:22:57.960 --> 3:23:00.640]  a groundbreaking announcement this morning.
[3:23:00.640 --> 3:23:03.160]  Can you tell us a little bit more?
[3:23:03.160 --> 3:23:05.200]  Professor, thank you for the honor and sermon.
[3:23:05.200 --> 3:23:08.360]  Professor, thank you for the honor and sermon.
[3:23:08.360 --> 3:23:09.360]  We're here.
[3:23:09.360 --> 3:23:15.520]  Today we announced that we will offer
[3:23:15.520 --> 3:23:18.160]  all our patent protected medicines,
[3:23:18.160 --> 3:23:20.360]  all vaccines or medicines,
[3:23:20.360 --> 3:23:24.440]  but currently exist in the US or in Europe.
[3:23:24.440 --> 3:23:27.520]  To the 45 poorest countries of the world,
[3:23:27.520 --> 3:23:30.040]  it is a population of 1.2 billion people.
[3:23:30.040 --> 3:23:31.840]  State Department memorandum 200.
[3:23:31.840 --> 3:23:33.440]  And also in the community.
[3:23:33.440 --> 3:23:37.040]  But every year, as we discover and bring to the US
[3:23:37.040 --> 3:23:40.280]  or to the Europe or to the world new medicines,
[3:23:40.280 --> 3:23:43.680]  automatically those new medicines will be inserted
[3:23:43.680 --> 3:23:48.360]  into the experimental gene therapy of these countries.
[3:23:48.360 --> 3:23:52.520]  I think that is really fulfilling of a dream
[3:23:52.520 --> 3:23:54.800]  that we had together with my leadership team
[3:23:54.800 --> 3:23:57.560]  when we started in 19.
[3:23:57.560 --> 3:24:02.240]  The first week we met in January of 19 in California
[3:24:02.240 --> 3:24:04.680]  and set up the goals for the next five years.
[3:24:04.680 --> 3:24:06.720]  We all know, but still...
[3:24:06.720 --> 3:24:08.400]  2019, though that's prior to COVID.
[3:24:08.400 --> 3:24:13.600] ...sufficient attention to the frightening scenario
[3:24:13.600 --> 3:24:16.520]  of a comprehensive cyber attack,
[3:24:16.520 --> 3:24:18.880]  which would bring to a complete...
[3:24:18.880 --> 3:24:22.560]  Our polygon, coming for your food,
[3:24:22.560 --> 3:24:24.760]  control the energy, control the food.
[3:24:24.760 --> 3:24:27.000]  It's a controlled demolition.
[3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:33.880]  As a whole, the COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect
[3:24:33.880 --> 3:24:41.560]  as a small disturbance in comparison to a marginal cyber attack.
[3:24:41.560 --> 3:24:47.880]  To use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity
[3:24:47.880 --> 3:24:52.440]  to reflect on the lessons of cybersecurity,
[3:24:52.440 --> 3:24:58.080]  the community can grow and improve our preparedness
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:01.880]  for a potential cyber pandemic.
[3:25:01.880 --> 3:25:03.880]  Get ready for that one.
[3:25:10.160 --> 3:25:11.880]  Now they can control our emotions
[3:25:11.880 --> 3:25:14.760]  that we just give into the metaverse,
[3:25:14.760 --> 3:25:17.600]  putting on these stupid brain chips,
[3:25:17.600 --> 3:25:20.520]  brain interfaces, all being pushed by World Economic Forum.
[3:25:20.520 --> 3:25:24.440]  They can cure our depression in this next video.
[3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:28.760]  AI will be connecting us to the global brain.
[3:25:28.760 --> 3:25:31.640]  The World Economic Forum says,
[3:25:34.320 --> 3:25:36.120]  it will read your thoughts.
[3:25:37.880 --> 3:25:41.360]  You won't have to use a mouse.
[3:25:41.360 --> 3:25:44.480]  Brain chips will read your thoughts directly.
[3:25:44.480 --> 3:25:47.320]  Neurotech, nanotech is what they're talking about here.
[3:25:47.320 --> 3:25:49.480]  Remember, Klaus said, we will be inside you,
[3:25:49.480 --> 3:25:53.800]  we'll be inside your body, we'll change your DNA from within.
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:25:55.760]  That's what the video is discussing now.
[3:25:55.760 --> 3:25:57.560]  Again, these are all World Economic Forum clips
[3:25:57.560 --> 3:25:59.280]  and videos directly from them.
[3:25:59.280 --> 3:26:02.640]  What humanity basically learned to produce
[3:26:02.640 --> 3:26:06.160]  was all kinds of stuff, like textiles and shoes
[3:26:06.160 --> 3:26:08.480]  and weapons and vehicles.
[3:26:08.480 --> 3:26:12.480]  And this was enough for very few countries
[3:26:12.480 --> 3:26:15.240]  that underwent the revolution fast enough
[3:26:15.240 --> 3:26:17.960]  to subjugate everybody else.
[3:26:17.960 --> 3:26:19.440]  What we're talking about now
[3:26:19.440 --> 3:26:22.600]  is like a second industrial revolution,
[3:26:22.600 --> 3:26:26.280]  but the product this time will not be textiles
[3:26:26.280 --> 3:26:29.040]  or machines or vehicles or even weapons.
[3:26:29.040 --> 3:26:32.800]  The product this time will be humans themselves.
[3:26:32.800 --> 3:26:36.040]  We're basically learning to produce bodies and minds.
[3:26:36.040 --> 3:26:36.880]  Bodies and minds.
[3:26:36.880 --> 3:26:38.280]  So you're talking about cloning.
[3:26:38.280 --> 3:26:41.160]  The two main products of the next wave.
[3:26:41.160 --> 3:26:44.760]  Creating synthoid and fake people.
[3:26:44.760 --> 3:26:46.360]  If there is a gap between...
[3:26:46.360 --> 3:26:47.520]  I'm not joking, this is what he's saying.
[3:26:47.520 --> 3:26:49.120]  How to produce bodies and minds.
[3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:51.200]  And those that do not,
[3:26:51.200 --> 3:26:53.080]  then this is far greater than anything
[3:26:53.080 --> 3:26:55.120]  we saw before in history.
[3:26:55.120 --> 3:26:59.760]  And this time, if you're not part of the revolution fast enough,
[3:26:59.760 --> 3:27:02.440]  then you probably become extinct.
[3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:05.880]  Once you know how to produce bodies and brains and minds,
[3:27:05.880 --> 3:27:09.040]  so cheap labor in Africa or South Asia or whatever,
[3:27:09.040 --> 3:27:10.760]  it simply comes for nothing.
[3:27:10.760 --> 3:27:12.880]  Again, I think that the biggest question
[3:27:12.880 --> 3:27:16.440]  in maybe in economics and politics of the coming decades
[3:27:16.440 --> 3:27:20.760]  will be what to do with all these useless people.
[3:27:20.760 --> 3:27:22.280]  I don't think we have an economy.
[3:27:22.280 --> 3:27:23.320]  Useless eaters.
[3:27:23.320 --> 3:27:25.040]  Remember, did you notice that?
[3:27:25.040 --> 3:27:25.880]  Yes, because...
[3:27:25.880 --> 3:27:28.000]  Permanology of David Attenborough.
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:28.840]  Yes, sir.
[3:27:28.840 --> 3:27:30.200]  Who's going to eat them?
[3:27:30.200 --> 3:27:31.840]  What should we do with the useless people?
[3:27:31.840 --> 3:27:33.120]  With all that kind of technology,
[3:27:33.120 --> 3:27:36.440]  you will be able to produce food to feed everybody.
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:39.320]  The problem is more boredom.
[3:27:39.320 --> 3:27:41.240]  And what to do with them
[3:27:41.240 --> 3:27:44.200]  and how will they find some sense of meaning in life
[3:27:44.200 --> 3:27:48.400]  when they literally say we're going to create people
[3:27:48.400 --> 3:27:50.200]  on an assembly line.
[3:27:50.200 --> 3:27:53.360]  A combination of drugs and computer games.
[3:27:53.360 --> 3:27:54.080]  AI people.
[3:27:54.080 --> 3:27:55.400]  By the way, he's the same guy that says
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:27:56.960]  that there's no such things as minds.
[3:27:56.960 --> 3:27:57.680]  They don't exist.
[3:27:57.680 --> 3:27:59.000]  Minds, if we will, don't exist.
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:02.320]  But we're going to create people and entities with minds, cloning.
[3:28:02.320 --> 3:28:04.520]  In New York on September 11th.
[3:28:04.520 --> 3:28:08.560]  A key difference with the CBDC is...
[3:28:08.560 --> 3:28:11.040]  Is the Triple 10 guy.
[3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:14.800]  Absolute control on the rules and regulations
[3:28:14.800 --> 3:28:18.640]  that will determine the use of that expression
[3:28:18.640 --> 3:28:21.000]  of central language liability.
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:25.040]  And also, we will have the technology to enforce that.
[3:28:25.040 --> 3:28:29.000]  Those two issues are extremely important.
[3:28:29.000 --> 3:28:29.440]  And that means...
[3:28:29.440 --> 3:28:30.600]  You're just saying you're going to shut down
[3:28:30.600 --> 3:28:33.480]  all your monetary transactions if they want to.
[3:28:33.480 --> 3:28:34.640]  That looks like...
[3:28:34.640 --> 3:28:35.960]  If Bitcoin does a three X,
[3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:37.480]  that means Chin did a hundred X.
[3:28:37.480 --> 3:28:41.920]  Our diets look like in 2030.
[3:28:41.920 --> 3:28:44.120]  No meat.
[3:28:44.120 --> 3:28:44.920]  What does the revolution?
[3:28:44.920 --> 3:28:46.320]  Getting rid of meat.
[3:28:46.320 --> 3:28:49.920]  We can eat dead people, but that's not fast enough.
[3:28:49.920 --> 3:28:52.720]  So I think your next campaign slogan has to be this.
[3:28:52.720 --> 3:28:54.120]  Yeah, I don't know if America gets this.
[3:28:54.120 --> 3:28:55.520]  A tired days in office.

[3:29:57.160 --> 3:29:59.560]  Fluoride is the enemy.
[3:29:59.560 --> 3:30:04.120]  It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine, bromide,
[3:30:04.120 --> 3:30:05.040]  you name it.
[3:30:05.040 --> 3:30:06.720]  What's the good halogen?
[3:30:06.720 --> 3:30:09.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.
[3:30:09.600 --> 3:30:11.280]  And we have the highest quality iodine
[3:30:11.280 --> 3:30:13.680]  you're going to find anywhere, exclusively,

[3:30:23.360 --> 3:30:27.560]  into the cells for all cellular function, and for energy,

[3:30:57.080 --> 3:31:00.240]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member,
[3:31:00.240 --> 3:31:03.720]  or a friend, or a coworker that's on drugs or alcohol,
[3:31:03.720 --> 3:31:06.240]  and is in a bad place, and they need family and friends
[3:31:06.240 --> 3:31:09.800]  to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[3:31:09.800 --> 3:31:13.040]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[3:31:13.040 --> 3:31:15.440]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals
[3:31:15.440 --> 3:31:18.800]  that your body must have to live, and people don't listen,
[3:31:18.800 --> 3:31:21.840]  and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[3:31:21.840 --> 3:31:23.920]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.

[3:32:03.960 --> 3:32:05.440]  And the globalist number one mission
[3:32:05.440 --> 3:32:07.840]  is to silence info wars because they rightly
[3:32:07.840 --> 3:32:10.640]  see us as one of the main beacons of resistance
[3:32:10.640 --> 3:32:12.960]  alerting the people, not as of America,
[3:32:12.960 --> 3:32:15.600]  but the world for the threat of the globalist
[3:32:15.600 --> 3:32:17.800]  and their censorship and tyranny.
[3:32:17.800 --> 3:32:20.520]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever,

[3:32:58.600 --> 3:33:01.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:33:01.440 --> 3:33:05.000]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:11.920 --> 3:33:13.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:13.320 --> 3:33:15.800]  I am your guest host, J. Dyer of J's Analysis.
[3:33:15.800 --> 3:33:18.520]  We were just talking about all of the clips
[3:33:18.520 --> 3:33:21.880]  and audio messages from the global lead
[3:33:21.880 --> 3:33:24.720]  to all of us, thebs, all the peons
[3:33:24.720 --> 3:33:27.120]  and how they were saying openly the very same things
[3:33:27.120 --> 3:33:28.640]  they were saying they were gonna do 100 years ago.
[3:33:28.640 --> 3:33:32.000]  So here we are, 100 years later, 120 years later,
[3:33:32.000 --> 3:33:34.560]  and they're saying what they said they would do,
[3:33:34.560 --> 3:33:36.520]  and they're doing what they said they would do.
[3:33:36.520 --> 3:33:39.680]  And the Fabians set up back in the day
[3:33:39.680 --> 3:33:42.800]  their own Fabian International Bureau,
[3:33:42.800 --> 3:33:44.320]  and they had a three-point platform.
[3:33:44.320 --> 3:33:46.720]  They made it very simple, and they're a three-point platform.
[3:33:46.720 --> 3:33:51.160]  They said the existing institutions in the world
[3:33:51.160 --> 3:33:54.240]  in order to achieve general world peace
[3:33:54.240 --> 3:33:55.960]  must all disarm.
[3:33:55.960 --> 3:33:59.760]  So all the nation states disarmament needs to happen.
[3:33:59.760 --> 3:34:01.560]  This disarmament will only happen
[3:34:01.560 --> 3:34:04.720]  when there is an advanced form of global government.
[3:34:04.720 --> 3:34:06.880]  So global government will have to be in place
[3:34:06.880 --> 3:34:08.920]  to disarm everybody so that we can have peace.
[3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:10.320]  And the way that we get to the global government
[3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:14.160]  is by a lot of wars and by the strengthening
[3:34:14.160 --> 3:34:16.040]  of the United Nations.
[3:34:16.040 --> 3:34:19.320]  That's their three-point platform that they stated
[3:34:19.320 --> 3:34:22.360]  even back in I think the 1960s is when they made this statement.
[3:34:22.360 --> 3:34:26.560]  In 1963, a Fabian Society meeting,
[3:34:26.560 --> 3:34:28.680]  and so they said in order to have this
[3:34:28.680 --> 3:34:31.400]  we would need a world army, now wait a minute,
[3:34:31.400 --> 3:34:34.200]  so world peace will be achieved
[3:34:34.200 --> 3:34:36.600]  through a world army and world wars.
[3:34:36.600 --> 3:34:38.760]  Yes, correct, there will be more wars,
[3:34:38.760 --> 3:34:41.600]  there will be more collapses, more, I mean,
[3:34:41.600 --> 3:34:43.520]  I don't know for certain when there's gonna be
[3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:46.520]  another world war, you could happen now, we don't know.
[3:34:46.520 --> 3:34:48.640]  Or I've just come about through economic collapses,
[3:34:48.640 --> 3:34:51.120]  who knows, but the point is that they're arguing
[3:34:51.120 --> 3:34:54.040]  that no nations, nobody should have arms,
[3:34:54.040 --> 3:34:56.240]  nobody should have guns, nobody should have armies,
[3:34:56.240 --> 3:34:58.440]  except for the global elite.
[3:34:58.440 --> 3:35:01.600]  I mean, who can't see, this is a scam, right?
[3:35:01.600 --> 3:35:02.880]  They even say we're gonna have to use a lot
[3:35:02.880 --> 3:35:07.400]  of psychological warfare over a long,
[3:35:07.400 --> 3:35:10.640]  protracted amount of time to bring this about.
[3:35:10.640 --> 3:35:12.520]  That's exactly where we are now.
[3:35:12.520 --> 3:35:14.960]  They were saying in the 1960s they would use
[3:35:14.960 --> 3:35:17.040]  heavy psychological warfare, even to the point
[3:35:17.040 --> 3:35:19.360]  of a fake right-wing party,
[3:35:19.360 --> 3:35:21.280]  brought to you a note on page 101,
[3:35:22.240 --> 3:35:25.520]  to eventually bring about this new age,
[3:35:25.520 --> 3:35:29.080]  the new Aeon, the great reset, the new world order.
[3:35:29.080 --> 3:35:31.320]  Here are some of the societies that were set up
[3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:34.760]  that you should take note of.
[3:35:34.760 --> 3:35:36.400]  If you, I might have mentioned this the last time
[3:35:36.400 --> 3:35:37.960]  I was on it, I don't remember, but remember this,
[3:35:37.960 --> 3:35:41.720]  because this gives you an idea of what we're talking
[3:35:41.720 --> 3:35:44.480]  about how influential this group was,
[3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:46.680]  the Royal Institute for International Affairs,
[3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:51.160]  the League of Nations, the United Nations,
[3:35:51.160 --> 3:35:54.680]  International Labor, the Court of International Justice
[3:35:54.680 --> 3:35:59.680]  or the World Court, the League for Industrial Democracy,
[3:36:01.840 --> 3:36:04.800]  the Council on Foreign Relations, the CFR,
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:09.120]  the British Commonwealth, Christian Socialist League,
[3:36:09.120 --> 3:36:12.280]  the Federal Union, the Fabian International Bureau,
[3:36:12.280 --> 3:36:16.360]  which is who I just mentioned had a three point platform.
[3:36:16.360 --> 3:36:20.720]  The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
[3:36:20.720 --> 3:36:25.720]  the World Council of Churches, NATO, the Aspen Institute,
[3:36:25.960 --> 3:36:29.040]  the Socialist International, the Bilderberg Group,
[3:36:29.040 --> 3:36:33.560]  the Trilateral Commission, the One World Trust,
[3:36:33.560 --> 3:36:34.640]  the European Union.
[3:36:36.320 --> 3:36:37.360]  Have you heard of any of these?
[3:36:37.360 --> 3:36:38.440]  I mean, does this sound familiar?
[3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:40.520]  Do you think this is, I mean, does this sound like a group
[3:36:40.520 --> 3:36:42.840]  that maybe has some influence and power
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:45.320]  or is this all just far-flung conspiracy theories?
[3:36:45.320 --> 3:36:47.040]  Or I mean, what do you think about this?
[3:36:47.040 --> 3:36:49.360]  Doesn't it seem odd to you that these people
[3:36:49.360 --> 3:36:51.560]  were saying 100 years ago they would bring about
[3:36:51.560 --> 3:36:53.920]  a situation where there'd be a circular economy
[3:36:53.920 --> 3:36:55.120]  and you would own nothing?
[3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:01.080]  The next point that the Fabian stressed so heavily
[3:37:01.080 --> 3:37:03.360]  was that we gotta get rid of politicians
[3:37:03.360 --> 3:37:05.680]  because politicians are one of the key issues
[3:37:05.680 --> 3:37:08.800]  that stand on the way of management by experts.
[3:37:08.800 --> 3:37:11.800]  Who else believes in management by experts?
[3:37:11.800 --> 3:37:13.880]  Technocrats, technocrats, technocrats.
[3:37:13.880 --> 3:37:16.640]  It's a key platform of technocracy
[3:37:16.640 --> 3:37:19.800]  is to install government by expert.
[3:37:21.360 --> 3:37:23.000]  The Fabian institution known as
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:25.640]  the London School of Economics really pioneered
[3:37:25.640 --> 3:37:28.400]  and pushed this notion of management by experts.
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:30.560]  I've got a bit of a cold today, so I apologize
[3:37:31.840 --> 3:37:34.160]  if I have to cough and put my throat.
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:36.480]  So, and no, it's not the coup fit.
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:37.320]  I don't have the coup fit.
[3:37:37.320 --> 3:37:38.240]  I just have a normal cold.
[3:37:38.240 --> 3:37:39.120]  That does still exist.
[3:37:39.120 --> 3:37:40.040]  I don't know if people know this,
[3:37:40.040 --> 3:37:42.600]  but there's still such a thing as the cold
[3:37:42.600 --> 3:37:44.920]  in these are the classics, right?
[3:37:44.920 --> 3:37:47.840]  The classics of sickness and illness.
[3:37:47.840 --> 3:37:50.200]  Not everything is COVID, but people still,
[3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:54.360]  I talked to people in the streets, family members
[3:37:54.360 --> 3:37:56.120]  and everything is COVID now.
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:37:58.480]  There's no other illnesses, but COVID.
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:00.600]  Well, I'm pretty sure I just have a cold.
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:03.720]  Maybe I got the AIDS, I don't know,
[3:38:03.720 --> 3:38:06.280]  but the Fabian said that we gotta have management
[3:38:06.280 --> 3:38:08.600]  by experts, get rid of politics,
[3:38:08.600 --> 3:38:10.320]  get rid of voting, all of that stuff.
[3:38:10.320 --> 3:38:12.160]  And so I think a lot of what's going on today
[3:38:12.160 --> 3:38:14.840]  as we've said before, as the lockstep document talks about
[3:38:14.840 --> 3:38:18.320]  is actually geared towards weakening everyone's faith
[3:38:18.320 --> 3:38:20.160]  in the institutions that exist, right?
[3:38:20.160 --> 3:38:23.160]  Including voting, including democracy.
[3:38:23.160 --> 3:38:27.000]  I'm not saying that those things don't have problems,
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:31.000]  but they definitely want to weaken everybody's belief
[3:38:31.000 --> 3:38:33.920]  in the existing institutions not to help anybody
[3:38:33.920 --> 3:38:37.480]  and they highlight the actual problems that do exist,
[3:38:37.480 --> 3:38:40.640]  but that's only to push their solutions
[3:38:40.640 --> 3:38:42.120]  that are pre-packaged.
[3:38:42.120 --> 3:38:43.720]  Remember that was in the lockstep document.
[3:38:43.720 --> 3:38:46.120]  Everybody will clamor and cry out.
[3:38:46.120 --> 3:38:48.320]  The corrupt officials of the CDC, right?
[3:38:48.320 --> 3:38:50.560]  That's in the Spars document, right?
[3:38:50.560 --> 3:38:52.400]  Oh, we have the solution for you,
[3:38:52.400 --> 3:38:55.040]  global government, government by AI,
[3:38:55.040 --> 3:38:59.240]  government by computer, government by Zuckerberg,
[3:38:59.240 --> 3:39:01.880]  right, transhumanism, the new man.
[3:39:01.880 --> 3:39:04.720]  And yes, the Fabians, you got it.
[3:39:04.720 --> 3:39:06.560]  They believed in transhumanism.
[3:39:06.560 --> 3:39:11.560]  They believed in government by computer and they believed
[3:39:11.960 --> 3:39:16.960]  in eugenics and particularly dysgenics and nasty population.
[3:39:17.600 --> 3:39:19.840]  All the Fabians 100% accepted the belief
[3:39:19.840 --> 3:39:22.880]  that the earth was way overpopulated
[3:39:22.880 --> 3:39:26.160]  and that the best way to get rid of this problem
[3:39:26.160 --> 3:39:27.840]  was to get rid of most of the people,
[3:39:27.840 --> 3:39:32.040]  especially the European and American stock.
[3:39:32.040 --> 3:39:37.040]  So they explicitly according to George Bernard Shaw
[3:39:37.480 --> 3:39:41.800]  were the first and most necessary to be depopulated.
[3:39:41.800 --> 3:39:44.160]  And this is why we find out that actually a lot
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:47.680]  of the Fabians adopted a pro-Islamic view.
[3:39:47.680 --> 3:39:49.280]  Now they didn't really believe Islam,
[3:39:49.280 --> 3:39:51.560]  but they thought that Islam would be a great way
[3:39:51.560 --> 3:39:55.200]  to open up borders and bring in Islam
[3:39:55.200 --> 3:39:57.320]  to completely change Europe.
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:01.760]  This was explicitly a plan of each one of the Fabians,
[3:40:01.760 --> 3:40:05.440]  including Bertrand Russell, including H.G. Wells,
[3:40:05.440 --> 3:40:07.840]  including George Bernard Shaw and Annie Besant,
[3:40:07.840 --> 3:40:12.760]  the famous New Age theosophist Fabian spy.
[3:40:12.760 --> 3:40:16.120]  I'm pretty sure Bailey, Bolvatsky and Besant
[3:40:16.120 --> 3:40:18.560]  were all spies to some degree.
[3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:20.960]  But this began in the UK.
[3:40:20.960 --> 3:40:23.600]  If everybody knows that England is now,
[3:40:23.600 --> 3:40:25.680]  London is Londonistan basically now.
[3:40:25.680 --> 3:40:26.520]  How did that come about?
[3:40:26.520 --> 3:40:28.680]  Well, it came about actually through Fabians.
[3:40:28.680 --> 3:40:33.680]  The Fabians did this via setting up certain,
[3:40:33.920 --> 3:40:35.600]  I guess we call them think tanks
[3:40:35.600 --> 3:40:38.880]  that were dedicated in the 1940s and 50s to Sufism.
[3:40:39.800 --> 3:40:42.680]  Sufism was of course mystical Islam.
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:45.320]  A lot of mainline Sunnis and people like that,
[3:40:45.320 --> 3:40:47.120]  they don't really consider authentic Islam.
[3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:50.280]  I'm not really debating what the authentic Islam is,
[3:40:50.280 --> 3:40:54.040]  but it had a lot of connections with the theosophists,
[3:40:54.040 --> 3:40:56.800]  with Gergith, Gergith's fourth way,
[3:40:56.800 --> 3:40:58.560]  and had a lot of connection.
[3:40:58.560 --> 3:41:02.320]  The Sufi stuff did with Freemasonry and other groups
[3:41:02.320 --> 3:41:07.120]  that were popular in London and throughout the UK
[3:41:07.120 --> 3:41:08.440]  in the 1940s and 50s.
[3:41:08.440 --> 3:41:11.760]  And so this character named Idris Shaw,
[3:41:11.760 --> 3:41:14.720]  who was a famous Sufi,
[3:41:15.880 --> 3:41:19.280]  was able to kind of set up a lot of groups,
[3:41:19.280 --> 3:41:20.480]  reading groups and whatnot,
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:23.520]  including groups at Oxford, Cambridge,
[3:41:23.520 --> 3:41:26.480]  that were able to get a lot of people into
[3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:29.200]  and convert a lot of people to Islam through Sufism.
[3:41:29.200 --> 3:41:32.240]  And this even includes people as high up as Prince Charles.
[3:41:32.240 --> 3:41:34.400]  Now Prince Charles has had at different times
[3:41:34.400 --> 3:41:35.360]  that he's every religion.
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:37.200]  So I wouldn't put too much stock in that,
[3:41:37.200 --> 3:41:40.760]  but he did at one point, I think back in the 80s,
[3:41:40.760 --> 3:41:43.720]  give credence to and say that he was very enamored
[3:41:43.720 --> 3:41:45.040]  with Sufi Islam.
[3:41:45.040 --> 3:41:47.400]  And that's because of this Idris Shaw character
[3:41:47.400 --> 3:41:52.400]  and his, it was called the ICR Institute for Cultural Research,
[3:41:52.400 --> 3:41:57.080]  which was a promotional engine for promoting Sufism.
[3:41:57.080 --> 3:42:00.360]  Now, eventually Sufism opened the door
[3:42:00.360 --> 3:42:02.080]  to other forms of Islam.
[3:42:02.080 --> 3:42:06.240]  And now it's why nowadays the Islamistization
[3:42:06.240 --> 3:42:10.000]  of Europe and the UK is something spearheaded by these people.
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:12.320]  It was the Fabians, I'm saying that were explicitly
[3:42:12.320 --> 3:42:14.400]  100% behind that.
[3:42:14.400 --> 3:42:15.920]  And they had a lot of influence as well
[3:42:15.920 --> 3:42:20.920]  at the Sufis at LSE, London School of Economics.
[3:42:20.920 --> 3:42:24.160]  This also explains why a lot of Western intelligence groups
[3:42:24.160 --> 3:42:27.760]  had been able to utilize Sufi networks
[3:42:27.760 --> 3:42:30.120]  in other countries as well for drug running.
[3:42:30.120 --> 3:42:34.200]  This relies on another form of ecumenism, right?
[3:42:34.200 --> 3:42:36.320]  So you can begin to see how the ecumenists
[3:42:36.320 --> 3:42:39.480]  who are also part of this Fabian New Age,
[3:42:39.480 --> 3:42:40.840]  New World Order plan,
[3:42:40.840 --> 3:42:43.600]  they found a lot of commonality with Sufis.
[3:42:43.600 --> 3:42:47.120]  And that's how, again, we had such a conversion of Sufism,
[3:42:47.120 --> 3:42:52.120]  excuse me, of the UK away from Anglicanism
[3:42:52.360 --> 3:42:54.120]  over to Sufism and Islam.
[3:42:54.120 --> 3:42:57.080]  Don't go anywhere, this is the Ox Jones Show.
[3:42:57.080 --> 3:42:58.960]  It's our best seller.
[3:42:58.960 --> 3:43:00.880]  We first came out with it five years ago
[3:43:00.880 --> 3:43:02.720]  and it was a moderate seller.
[3:43:02.720 --> 3:43:04.880]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion
[3:43:04.880 --> 3:43:07.360]  and experienced the way it made it feel
[3:43:07.360 --> 3:43:08.680]  and how healthy it made them,
[3:43:08.680 --> 3:43:11.760]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[3:43:11.760 --> 3:43:12.880]  And it's been sold out for a while
[3:43:12.880 --> 3:43:14.320]  but it's finally back in stock.
[3:43:14.320 --> 3:43:17.240]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge
[3:43:17.240 --> 3:43:18.360]  your immune system,
[3:43:18.360 --> 3:43:21.040]  but it helps every cellular function of the body
[3:43:21.040 --> 3:43:23.800]  and has all the minerals, all the key amino acids,
[3:43:23.800 --> 3:43:25.640]  all of the essential vitamins
[3:43:25.640 --> 3:43:28.120]  that you need to live and be healthy.
[3:43:28.120 --> 3:43:30.680]  Essential means without these things, you die.
[3:43:30.680 --> 3:43:32.840]  And so much of the food is debased.
[3:43:32.840 --> 3:43:34.640]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[3:43:34.640 --> 3:43:37.680]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[3:43:37.680 --> 3:43:38.840]  with a product like this.
[3:43:38.840 --> 3:43:41.560]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there
[3:43:41.560 --> 3:43:43.400]  but this is amongst the very best
[3:43:43.400 --> 3:43:45.720]  and it's a low price and it funds the infill war.
[3:43:45.720 --> 3:43:48.240]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today,
[3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:50.920]  getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock
[3:43:50.920 --> 3:43:53.480]  at infillwarstore.com for 50% off.

[3:43:58.160 --> 3:44:03.080]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[3:44:03.080 --> 3:44:07.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics
[3:44:07.000 --> 3:44:09.520]  not just in America but in the world.
[3:44:09.520 --> 3:44:13.000]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range
[3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:16.360]  in the information war but I don't deserve the credit.
[3:44:16.360 --> 3:44:19.360]  Yes, I've persevered but the listeners and viewers
[3:44:19.360 --> 3:44:21.800]  who support an infill war are the real reason
[3:44:21.800 --> 3:44:23.520]  you've had the success.
[3:44:23.520 --> 3:44:25.760]  We're having now the greatest victories
[3:44:25.760 --> 3:44:28.920]  in the fight against the new war you've ever had.
[3:44:28.920 --> 3:44:33.240]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon
[3:44:33.240 --> 3:44:36.320]  and that's why today it's more important than ever
[3:44:36.320 --> 3:44:38.520]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[3:44:38.520 --> 3:44:41.120]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out
[3:44:41.120 --> 3:44:42.480]  and to intensify them.
[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:45.880]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you
[3:44:45.880 --> 3:44:48.840]  and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[3:44:48.840 --> 3:44:52.040]  because we are over the target and this grief is happening.
[3:44:52.040 --> 3:44:54.680]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight.
[3:44:54.680 --> 3:44:55.840]  God bless you all.
[3:44:56.880 --> 3:44:59.360]  Don't let the globalist monsters
[3:44:59.360 --> 3:45:01.520]  and their mercenary minions be successful
[3:45:01.520 --> 3:45:05.160]  at silencing you and the globalist number one mission
[3:45:05.160 --> 3:45:08.080]  is to silence infill wars because they rightly see us
[3:45:08.080 --> 3:45:10.320]  as one of the main beacons of resistance
[3:45:10.320 --> 3:45:13.640]  alerting the people, not as of America but the world
[3:45:13.640 --> 3:45:15.320]  for the threat of the globalist
[3:45:15.320 --> 3:45:17.520]  and their censorship and tearing.
[3:45:17.520 --> 3:45:20.240]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever,
[3:45:20.240 --> 3:45:23.040]  to share links, rimfallwars.com
[3:45:23.040 --> 3:45:25.760]  and to also financially support rimfallwars.com

[3:46:04.240 --> 3:46:07.400]  we are always the cutting edge tip of the spear.

[3:46:30.560 --> 3:46:33.520]  So X3, despite the fact it was a run on iodine

[3:46:41.760 --> 3:46:42.840]  which is a 360 win.

[3:46:58.120 --> 3:47:02.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[3:47:02.680 --> 3:47:04.520]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:08.600 --> 3:47:13.520]  We'll come back to the, I'll show you,
[3:47:13.520 --> 3:47:15.360]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jays and Elses.
[3:47:15.360 --> 3:47:18.040]  We were discussing the usage of Islam
[3:47:18.040 --> 3:47:20.760]  by the Fabian Society and the elites of the UK
[3:47:20.760 --> 3:47:23.600]  for cultural and social engineering by design
[3:47:23.600 --> 3:47:27.680]  to transform not just the UK, but also Europe as a whole.
[3:47:27.680 --> 3:47:30.280]  And they noted that the key British institutions
[3:47:30.280 --> 3:47:33.480]  could all be changed and revolutionized
[3:47:33.480 --> 3:47:38.480]  through this importation of a foreign religious ideology
[3:47:38.480 --> 3:47:39.320]  by design.
[3:47:39.320 --> 3:47:41.480]  Now again, remember that the Fabians themselves
[3:47:41.480 --> 3:47:43.200]  didn't believe Islam, they didn't care about it.
[3:47:43.200 --> 3:47:46.880]  In fact, they said explicitly we could co-opt
[3:47:46.880 --> 3:47:51.200]  the figure of Mohammed to be a revolutionary socialist figure
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:54.440]  to bring in Fabian socialism.
[3:47:54.440 --> 3:47:57.520]  Now, I'm not interested in debating that right now.
[3:47:57.520 --> 3:47:58.760]  I mean, that's kind of ridiculous,
[3:47:58.760 --> 3:48:01.440]  but you can see that from their vantage point,
[3:48:01.440 --> 3:48:03.240]  religion is a tool.
[3:48:03.240 --> 3:48:06.160]  It has nothing to do with what they think is true or false.
[3:48:06.160 --> 3:48:08.280]  It's rather that a lot of these Fabians,
[3:48:08.280 --> 3:48:11.440]  such as Lord Haldane and others noted that
[3:48:11.440 --> 3:48:14.640]  if they set up specific kinds of courses,
[3:48:14.640 --> 3:48:16.760]  seminars, workshops, lectures and other events
[3:48:16.760 --> 3:48:18.760]  that promoted advanced thinking
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:22.360]  and how the EU should be more open to Islam,
[3:48:22.360 --> 3:48:25.560]  then pro-Islamic outfits could eventually come to the fore
[3:48:25.560 --> 3:48:28.480]  such as the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, et cetera,
[3:48:28.480 --> 3:48:31.760]  to, through the acceptance of vast sums of money
[3:48:31.760 --> 3:48:34.200]  from various Islamic regimes,
[3:48:34.200 --> 3:48:38.760]  the entire existing culture of the UK and Europe
[3:48:38.760 --> 3:48:43.760]  could be transformed by this Islamization process.
[3:48:45.680 --> 3:48:48.720]  This has actually been noted by a lot of geopolitical analysts
[3:48:48.720 --> 3:48:50.720]  and historians, not just by Ratio,
[3:48:50.720 --> 3:48:55.360]  but also Batya or discusses how the 1973 Arab oil embargo
[3:48:55.360 --> 3:48:59.520]  was actually a key event in this transformation of Europe
[3:48:59.520 --> 3:49:02.200]  and they even wanted a clash of civilizations model
[3:49:02.200 --> 3:49:03.480]  on purpose.
[3:49:03.480 --> 3:49:05.320]  The purpose of the clash of civilizations model
[3:49:05.320 --> 3:49:07.800]  from Samuel Huntington, for example,
[3:49:07.800 --> 3:49:11.200]  that the Fabians wanted the stoke to hype up
[3:49:11.200 --> 3:49:16.200]  was to portray and focus on Christianity as evil
[3:49:16.400 --> 3:49:18.280]  and as reactionary.
[3:49:18.280 --> 3:49:23.280]  So even though that's not actually the case
[3:49:23.280 --> 3:49:26.040]  because when it comes to something like the Church of England
[3:49:26.040 --> 3:49:28.520]  or Anglicanism, I mean, that's pretty much completely
[3:49:28.520 --> 3:49:32.360]  a co-opted institution for the global elites,
[3:49:32.360 --> 3:49:35.840]  the ghostly remnants of what exists in Europe
[3:49:35.840 --> 3:49:38.040]  and in the UK as Christianity,
[3:49:38.040 --> 3:49:40.640]  even that had to be tossed out.
[3:49:40.640 --> 3:49:45.360]  And so, for example, from 1997 to 2010,
[3:49:45.360 --> 3:49:48.280]  the complete Islamization of Europe and the UK
[3:49:48.280 --> 3:49:52.600]  was pretty much done, was pretty much completed
[3:49:52.600 --> 3:49:57.200]  and they did this through entities like the Labour Party,
[3:49:57.200 --> 3:49:59.320]  which was a big promoter of this.
[3:49:59.320 --> 3:50:02.520]  In 1998, under Tony Blair, for example,
[3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:05.400]  MI6 was instructed to train and arm
[3:50:05.400 --> 3:50:08.200]  the Islamic Kosovo Liberation Army
[3:50:08.200 --> 3:50:11.520]  in collaboration with Bill Clinton and the CIA.
[3:50:11.520 --> 3:50:16.520]  Select al-Qaeda operatives were armed in an insurrection
[3:50:17.200 --> 3:50:19.280]  against Orthodox Christianity in Serbia
[3:50:19.280 --> 3:50:22.280]  to provide a pretext for this military intervention.
[3:50:22.280 --> 3:50:24.200]  In the following year, Serbia was bombed
[3:50:24.200 --> 3:50:28.080]  by NATO Secretary General Javier Solana himself,
[3:50:28.080 --> 3:50:29.720]  who is a Fabian.
[3:50:29.720 --> 3:50:33.680]  And the architect then of the European Euro-Mediterranean
[3:50:33.680 --> 3:50:38.680]  Partnership, aka the Barcelona process,
[3:50:38.680 --> 3:50:41.320]  was responsible then for the Islamization
[3:50:41.320 --> 3:50:42.920]  of the rest of Europe.
[3:50:42.920 --> 3:50:47.920]  So this was actually the KLA, which was this fake-created group
[3:50:47.920 --> 3:50:52.520]  by the CIA, which mixes Islam and communism,
[3:50:52.520 --> 3:50:54.240]  al-Qaeda and communism.
[3:50:54.240 --> 3:50:57.040]  That was actually a key instrumental operation
[3:50:57.040 --> 3:51:00.400]  to helping this process that we're discussing here
[3:51:00.400 --> 3:51:03.040]  about the Islamization of Europe.
[3:51:03.040 --> 3:51:05.920]  And it was spearheaded by British Intelligence,
[3:51:05.920 --> 3:51:09.160]  by the CIA, by Clinton, who was taught
[3:51:09.160 --> 3:51:12.560]  the third-way process under Dr. Cole Quigley,
[3:51:12.560 --> 3:51:14.760]  together with the Fabian Socialist
[3:51:14.760 --> 3:51:16.560]  third-way promoter, Tony Blair,
[3:51:16.560 --> 3:51:18.920]  and third-way is just another word
[3:51:18.920 --> 3:51:20.400]  for what I'm talking about,
[3:51:20.400 --> 3:51:24.320]  the Fabian model of combining monopoly capitalism
[3:51:24.320 --> 3:51:26.840]  with socialism or Fabian socialism.
[3:51:26.840 --> 3:51:29.320]  This is what resulted then in Londonistan,
[3:51:29.320 --> 3:51:31.840]  or the conversion of the UK and London
[3:51:31.840 --> 3:51:35.720]  to more or less a controlled operation
[3:51:35.720 --> 3:51:39.280]  where even Rotsu himself was a perceptive enough
[3:51:39.280 --> 3:51:42.840]  to note that the connection between MI6
[3:51:42.840 --> 3:51:45.360]  and the 7.7 bombing is pretty apparent.
[3:51:45.360 --> 3:51:47.560]  The people involved in the 7.7 event
[3:51:47.560 --> 3:51:52.560]  just happened to be publicly known to be MI6 assets.
[3:51:53.360 --> 3:51:54.800]  He notes that the evidence shows
[3:51:54.800 --> 3:51:59.200]  that the systemic partnership of Islamic schools
[3:51:59.200 --> 3:52:01.600]  and cultural centers and charities and mosques
[3:52:01.600 --> 3:52:03.760]  and the appointment of Muslim and Muslim sympathizers
[3:52:03.760 --> 3:52:06.400]  to key positions in local councils
[3:52:06.400 --> 3:52:09.760]  was all part of the official policy publicly
[3:52:09.760 --> 3:52:13.440]  of the Labour Party and privately by the fake-right wingers.
[3:52:13.440 --> 3:52:16.440]  And this eventually leads to Britain's first
[3:52:16.440 --> 3:52:20.240]  a Muslim like Pierre Nazir Ahmad in 1998.
[3:52:20.240 --> 3:52:23.400]  And in 2000, Blair infamously said,
[3:52:23.400 --> 3:52:25.680]  there is a lot of misunderstanding about Islam.
[3:52:25.680 --> 3:52:27.080]  This is right before 9-11.
[3:52:27.080 --> 3:52:28.680]  It is deeply reflective, peaceful.
[3:52:28.680 --> 3:52:30.000]  It is a beautiful religion, I think,
[3:52:30.000 --> 3:52:32.840]  that it would be helpful if people from other religions
[3:52:32.840 --> 3:52:35.000]  knew more about Islam.
[3:52:35.000 --> 3:52:38.640]  In 2001, weeks before the 9-11 event,
[3:52:38.640 --> 3:52:41.240]  Blair said that links between Muslims
[3:52:41.240 --> 3:52:43.760]  and the rest of Europe should be deepened.
[3:52:43.760 --> 3:52:47.400]  So this, again, you'll notice, is not accidental.
[3:52:48.760 --> 3:52:52.040]  That they know what this religion is all about,
[3:52:52.040 --> 3:52:53.240]  what it does.
[3:52:53.240 --> 3:52:56.680]  And the key to understanding why they support this
[3:52:56.680 --> 3:53:01.280]  is because there is a larger plan for global government.
[3:53:01.280 --> 3:53:04.280]  Once you understand that, all of this makes perfect sense.
[3:53:05.200 --> 3:53:06.960]  Even into the 2000s, Tony Blair,
[3:53:06.960 --> 3:53:10.200]  even after the big 9 event,
[3:53:10.200 --> 3:53:14.160]  consistently praised the Koran and Islamic imperialism
[3:53:14.160 --> 3:53:17.440]  as a progressive socialist type of movement.
[3:53:18.680 --> 3:53:23.160]  Now, the only reason that they say this, again,
[3:53:23.160 --> 3:53:25.680]  is because Babian socialists believe
[3:53:25.680 --> 3:53:28.760]  that you can utilize any of these religions
[3:53:28.760 --> 3:53:30.240]  for the purpose of global government.
[3:53:30.240 --> 3:53:31.080]  That's it.
[3:53:31.080 --> 3:53:31.920]  That's the only purpose,
[3:53:31.920 --> 3:53:33.880]  the only reason they care about it.
[3:53:33.880 --> 3:53:38.560]  And the changing of the demographics, right,
[3:53:38.560 --> 3:53:40.800]  which is what's going on in Europe and in the UK,
[3:53:40.800 --> 3:53:42.680]  it's the same model here.
[3:53:42.680 --> 3:53:43.840]  And they do that.
[3:53:43.840 --> 3:53:46.240]  They clash together the societies on purpose
[3:53:47.240 --> 3:53:49.640]  and they have the open borders on purpose
[3:53:49.640 --> 3:53:51.360]  so that there will be problems,
[3:53:51.360 --> 3:53:52.680]  so there'll be a collapse,
[3:53:52.680 --> 3:53:55.640]  so that then they can come in and say, we have the solution.
[3:53:55.640 --> 3:53:58.480]  The solution is technocratic global government.
[3:53:59.640 --> 3:54:04.640]  The solution is to create a social credit score system
[3:54:05.000 --> 3:54:08.280]  which allows you to track suit as everything that you do.
[3:54:08.280 --> 3:54:10.280]  You just heard the bank for international settlements,
[3:54:10.280 --> 3:54:13.520]  which is the central bank of central banks,
[3:54:13.520 --> 3:54:15.160]  that triple chin dude, right?
[3:54:15.160 --> 3:54:17.800]  He was saying that what we're gonna put in place
[3:54:17.800 --> 3:54:21.080]  is an electronic version of cryptocurrency,
[3:54:21.080 --> 3:54:22.280]  which isn't Bitcoin,
[3:54:22.280 --> 3:54:23.880]  it's some other kind of centralized thing
[3:54:23.880 --> 3:54:25.120]  that they're gonna pick.
[3:54:25.120 --> 3:54:28.520]  He says, we're gonna shut that down if we don't like you.
[3:54:28.520 --> 3:54:31.120]  If you say no, no words, naughty words,
[3:54:31.120 --> 3:54:32.720]  you say bad things.
[3:54:32.720 --> 3:54:34.520]  And who decides what that is?
[3:54:34.520 --> 3:54:36.320]  Well, you can already imagine the same people
[3:54:36.320 --> 3:54:39.200]  that have been already shutting everybody down
[3:54:39.200 --> 3:54:40.040]  and banning everybody.
[3:54:40.040 --> 3:54:42.280]  That's who we're talking about here.
[3:54:42.280 --> 3:54:44.400]  But you have to understand that this is
[3:54:44.400 --> 3:54:49.400]  the ideological game plan that they're using.
[3:54:50.000 --> 3:54:51.880]  It is this Fabian socialist model
[3:54:51.880 --> 3:54:53.200]  and it's not something new,
[3:54:53.200 --> 3:54:56.960]  it's an old model that goes back a long time.
[3:54:56.960 --> 3:54:59.840]  That's why David Rockefeller, for example, in the 1970s,
[3:54:59.840 --> 3:55:03.600]  the late 70s, 78, 79, wrote New York Times editorials
[3:55:03.600 --> 3:55:08.600]  where he said that he thought that Mao's social experiment
[3:55:08.960 --> 3:55:11.080]  in China was a great thing.
[3:55:11.080 --> 3:55:12.800]  He loved it, he praised it.
[3:55:12.800 --> 3:55:13.720]  And why is that?
[3:55:13.720 --> 3:55:16.120]  Well, if you know, in terms of his memoirs,
[3:55:16.120 --> 3:55:20.240]  he goes on to talk about how after the communists took over
[3:55:20.240 --> 3:55:22.640]  after China became a communist country,
[3:55:22.640 --> 3:55:26.640]  he was able to come in and have Chase Bank as the only bank.
[3:55:26.640 --> 3:55:28.280]  So that was by design.
[3:55:28.280 --> 3:55:30.040]  So do you see that this is a trick?
[3:55:30.040 --> 3:55:31.560]  It's a scam, right?
[3:55:31.560 --> 3:55:36.480]  You convince everybody, you have chaos, control chaos,
[3:55:36.480 --> 3:55:39.680]  arc of crisis, chaos, the Brzezinski model.
[3:55:39.680 --> 3:55:43.680]  The chaos causes people to cry out for a solution
[3:55:43.680 --> 3:55:47.160]  and you come with the solution, problem reaction solution.
[3:55:47.160 --> 3:55:48.960]  The same people that are behind the problems
[3:55:48.960 --> 3:55:50.360]  are the ones offering the solution.
[3:55:50.360 --> 3:55:54.160]  And that's by design to get society, to socially engineer,
[3:55:54.160 --> 3:55:56.800]  to move in the direction that they want.
[3:55:56.800 --> 3:55:59.120]  And all of this, the last century,
[3:55:59.120 --> 3:56:01.800]  where we're going right now, all of it,
[3:56:01.800 --> 3:56:05.120]  the two world wars, the Cold War, the war on terror,
[3:56:05.120 --> 3:56:08.800]  now the new war on viruses, the war on health,
[3:56:08.800 --> 3:56:10.800]  which is basically just the toxification
[3:56:10.800 --> 3:56:13.680]  or the perception that human beings are the toxins.
[3:56:13.680 --> 3:56:15.480]  That's the whole purpose of the COVID stuff,
[3:56:15.480 --> 3:56:19.600]  to move us into automation, to move us into AI governance.
[3:56:19.600 --> 3:56:21.040]  That's the next phase.
[3:56:21.040 --> 3:56:22.960]  This is all by design.
[3:56:22.960 --> 3:56:24.840]  It's not a conspiracy theory
[3:56:24.840 --> 3:56:28.360]  when the people behind it openly say what their plan is.
[3:56:28.360 --> 3:56:29.960]  That's not a conspiracy theory, right?
[3:56:29.960 --> 3:56:33.800]  If Jeffrey Dahmer was writing letters to the police
[3:56:33.800 --> 3:56:36.880]  saying what he was gonna do and the police read the letters,
[3:56:36.880 --> 3:56:40.280]  that doesn't make the policemen conspiracy theorists.
[3:56:40.280 --> 3:56:44.800]  It makes them detectives, policemen, investigators
[3:56:44.800 --> 3:56:46.000]  doing their job.
[3:56:46.000 --> 3:56:49.360]  Likewise, if the people who have a majority of the power
[3:56:49.360 --> 3:56:52.480]  on the planet openly write dozens and dozens of books,
[3:56:52.480 --> 3:56:56.560]  which I have lectured through for the last six years,
[3:56:56.560 --> 3:56:59.440]  dozens of them, from their own words,
[3:56:59.440 --> 3:57:01.280]  that's not a conspiracy theory.
[3:57:03.800 --> 3:57:08.520]  That is collusion, espionage,
[3:57:08.520 --> 3:57:10.720]  and basically being traitors.
[3:57:10.720 --> 3:57:12.840]  Those people are just traitors, right?
[3:57:14.080 --> 3:57:18.080]  Because they're working to subvert the existing society
[3:57:18.080 --> 3:57:22.360]  to bring in what they are convinced is a post-human era.
[3:57:22.360 --> 3:57:23.520]  And that's where this is all going
[3:57:23.520 --> 3:57:25.160]  and all the Fabian socialists were all
[3:57:25.160 --> 3:57:26.840]  into transhumanism, post-humanism.
[3:57:26.840 --> 3:57:27.840]  They all wanted to kill everybody.
[3:57:27.840 --> 3:57:29.600]  They're all psychos.
[3:57:29.600 --> 3:57:32.480]  Can't let psychos run your life and your government.
[3:57:32.480 --> 3:57:33.440]  So we have to stand up.
[3:57:33.440 --> 3:57:35.880]  We have to say no to this, get off the grid,
[3:57:35.880 --> 3:57:39.720]  stop using their corporate system, their Fortune 100,
[3:57:39.720 --> 3:57:41.760]  get Bitcoin, get gold, get silver, right?
[3:57:41.760 --> 3:57:44.360]  Get some land, get into church.
[3:57:44.360 --> 3:57:45.680]  This is the oxygen show.
[3:57:46.680 --> 3:57:50.560]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[3:57:50.560 --> 3:57:55.000]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question
[3:57:55.000 --> 3:57:58.080]  that event in any way that they deem fit.
[3:57:58.080 --> 3:57:59.880]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[3:57:59.880 --> 3:58:01.360]  That's what they want to take away,
[3:58:01.360 --> 3:58:02.960]  your ability to speak freely.
[3:58:02.960 --> 3:58:04.680]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next,
[3:58:04.680 --> 3:58:06.160]  or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[3:58:06.160 --> 3:58:07.720]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[3:58:07.720 --> 3:58:10.920]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years.
[3:58:10.920 --> 3:58:12.600]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[3:58:12.600 --> 3:58:15.040]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[3:58:15.040 --> 3:58:17.000]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[3:58:17.000 --> 3:58:18.600]  And now, because we've been so successful
[3:58:18.600 --> 3:58:20.120]  warning the population of the planet,
[3:58:20.120 --> 3:58:22.760]  not just America, we're public enemy number one
[3:58:22.760 --> 3:58:24.600]  when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[3:58:24.600 --> 3:58:26.640]  And that's why it's more important than ever to realize
[3:58:26.640 --> 3:58:28.440]  how successful Infowars has been
[3:58:28.440 --> 3:58:29.960]  because of your past support.
[3:58:29.960 --> 3:58:31.240]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[3:58:31.240 --> 3:58:33.760]  And I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[3:58:33.760 --> 3:58:36.640]  free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com
[3:58:36.640 --> 3:58:39.360]  and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[3:58:39.360 --> 3:58:41.280]  1776 is the promo code.
[3:58:41.280 --> 3:58:44.080]  The destination is infowarstore.com.
[3:58:44.080 --> 3:58:46.680]  And I thank you all for your support.
[3:58:46.680 --> 3:58:50.360]  Think about a world without Infowars.
[3:58:51.560 --> 3:58:53.800]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about
[3:58:53.800 --> 3:58:56.760]  all the incredible guests and callers and stories
[3:58:56.760 --> 3:58:59.680]  we've broken together, this family that is Infowars.
[3:59:01.160 --> 3:59:04.200]  Think about how Infowars is cited by Joe Rogan
[3:59:04.200 --> 3:59:06.400]  and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro
[3:59:06.400 --> 3:59:09.720]  and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage
[3:59:09.720 --> 3:59:13.880]  as being the main impetus towards firing up
[3:59:13.880 --> 3:59:16.440]  their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[3:59:17.400 --> 3:59:21.120]  The only reason humanity's still in the fight today
[3:59:21.120 --> 3:59:24.480]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast
[3:59:24.480 --> 3:59:26.720]  have taken action and supported this show.
[3:59:27.680 --> 3:59:29.400]  I don't take the credit.
[3:59:29.400 --> 3:59:31.120]  I give you the credit.
[3:59:31.120 --> 3:59:33.800]  And now Infowars is facing its darkest hours.
[3:59:33.800 --> 3:59:35.360]  It isn't gonna give up.
[3:59:35.360 --> 3:59:37.200]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
