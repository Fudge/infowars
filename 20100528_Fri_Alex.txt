[00:53.440 --> 01:00.880]  seems like 2005 just started a few minutes ago 2001 and the stage to government terror
[01:00.880 --> 01:06.600]  attacks seems like yesterday but at the same time seems like a million years ago it's
[01:06.600 --> 01:15.680]  that paradox so much of life is a paradox okay Alan Hart is joining us he is the former
[01:15.680 --> 01:22.720]  top BBC presenter and reporter he's now an independent investigative journalist and author

[01:35.640 --> 01:43.400]  on 9-11 remember that report from April 23rd little over a month ago when Fox News itself
[01:43.400 --> 01:47.080]  a reporter said yeah I was there they were talking about blowing it up at the command
[01:47.080 --> 01:53.640]  center that morning well it's the same thing from Alan Hart but this was known within days
[01:53.640 --> 01:59.960]  of the attack basically all the high-level media knew this but knew to keep their mouths
[01:59.960 --> 02:07.640]  shut so he'll be joining us coming up in the second hour today of course our once a week
[02:07.640 --> 02:12.440]  visit with Bob Chapman on the economy I tell you it's always important to have him on but
[02:12.440 --> 02:18.080]  more and more with the global meltdown that's ongoing humans are very resilient creatures
[02:18.080 --> 02:22.800]  as long as we're eased into something we pretty much accept it like oh yeah the whole world
[02:22.800 --> 02:26.440]  is going to hell in a handbasket but at least they say things might get better and yeah
[02:26.440 --> 02:30.520]  unemployment's a lot worse than what they say and the economy's falling apart and everything's
[02:30.520 --> 02:35.040]  shutting down around us and yeah they've got all these hundreds of new taxes and you know
[02:35.040 --> 02:41.200]  they're taking our houses for $300 unpaid water bills or for $1.25 unpaid parking tickets
[02:41.200 --> 02:45.320]  or toll road bills and yeah they're building giant FEMA camps everywhere we got some news
[02:45.320 --> 02:50.680]  on that today but oh you know just they've kind of eased us into it frog in the pot of
[02:50.680 --> 02:59.840]  water incrementally turned up but here's the article came out two days ago top construction
[02:59.840 --> 03:05.840]  firm WTC destroyed by control demolition respected mentally expert and former BBC presenter
[03:05.840 --> 03:10.720]  Alan Hart has broken his silence on 9-1-1 by revealing that the world's most prominent
[03:10.720 --> 03:14.280]  civil engineering company told him directly that the collapse of the Twin Towers was
[03:14.280 --> 03:19.800]  a controlled demolition so again that's coming up in the next hour Alan Hart Alan Hart.net
[03:19.800 --> 03:26.560]  joining us. In the meantime boy do we have some important news and we're going to be
[03:26.560 --> 03:36.160]  blitzing through it in this hour but I also want to go over basically my philosophy and
[03:36.160 --> 03:42.640]  the in the overall societal threats we face but also the positive things that are happening
[03:42.640 --> 03:46.080]  so I'll go over some of that at the bottom of the hour I'm going to cover news in the
[03:46.080 --> 03:52.040]  meantime we get back like North Korea warns it will meet war with all out war. Geithner
[03:52.040 --> 03:56.680]  talks up stability deal that's the global government public formation. Builderbergs
[03:56.680 --> 04:00.920]  are set to be meeting we're getting a lot of intel leaking out from Builderberg sources
[04:00.920 --> 04:06.480]  including some sources I have that run with the Builderberg group and I'll tell you these
[04:06.480 --> 04:11.200]  sources are as good as anybody's. I start to realize the type of sources we have and
[04:11.200 --> 04:20.240]  then I don't even really ever consciously myself realize the amazing info we have the
[04:20.240 --> 04:28.120]  amount of amazing intel we get from government from military from banking and academia but

[05:13.960 --> 05:17.800]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land they
[05:17.800 --> 05:23.960]  think they're on our water children our education our money we have to define who we are and

[08:23.640 --> 08:28.960]  joining us at the time of 9 11 they knew within days that it was an inside job of controlled
[08:28.960 --> 08:34.560]  demolition and that many other reporters knew this and controlled demolition companies
[08:34.560 --> 08:41.720]  knew this and it was just a public thing that's why one of the other bbc presenters of world
[08:41.720 --> 08:47.720]  news who was confronted by we are changed two years ago they brought up the fact that
[08:47.720 --> 08:52.200]  he was live on tv reporting the building seven had fallen and then he interviewed reporters
[08:52.200 --> 08:57.880]  on the ground before building seven had fallen and he said no i wasn't there i remember distinctly
[08:57.880 --> 09:06.560]  i took my film to the movies i took my son to the movies that day i went and saw a film
[09:06.560 --> 09:11.200]  and they said excuse me sir you were all over tv for hour after hour that day he goes oh
[09:11.200 --> 09:17.960]  yes i do remember now mmm so they just all know they just all know the government did
[09:17.960 --> 09:28.840]  it they all know it was blown sky high and it's a fear paradigm where you're there you
[09:28.840 --> 09:33.080]  know the government did it and you're standing around looking at each other and no one is
[09:33.080 --> 09:38.160]  a leader no one stands up no one speaks out it's like the cops the cops are brought into
[09:38.160 --> 09:42.320]  the conspiracy but only on the edge tell everybody get back we're blowing up building
[09:42.320 --> 09:48.440]  seven cops are on video on cnn on cbs local on other channels saying get back get back
[09:48.440 --> 09:54.040]  they're bringing down building seven boom they blow it up and then later the cops here
[09:54.040 --> 09:59.560]  the conspiracy theorist playing videos of them saying get back and they go you're a conspiracy
[09:59.560 --> 10:04.560]  theorist and then years later they go well they did talk about blowing it up but that
[10:04.560 --> 10:08.000]  doesn't matter it doesn't matter that it fell they said they were going to blow it up but
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.640]  it fell on its own as we said there was a countdown because now they say they didn't
[10:12.640 --> 10:15.800]  blow it up so i've got to say that they didn't blow it up i've got to go along with what
[10:15.800 --> 10:21.680]  they said because it can't be true the government would do something like this i've got to just
[10:21.680 --> 10:30.320]  see that's how the psychology works it's called crime stop in 1984 where you read the newspaper
[10:30.320 --> 10:35.520]  on a monday and it says we've always been at war with east asia and we just launched
[10:35.520 --> 10:40.040]  a huge victory against their capital city and took it over and we killed over a million
[10:40.040 --> 10:45.520]  enemy troops in the last month and then the next day there's a headline we have been in
[10:45.520 --> 10:50.880]  friends with east asia for the last hundred years they have always battled with us they
[10:50.880 --> 10:57.040]  are our best friends here's a photo of big brother with the grand leader of east asia
[10:57.040 --> 11:04.000]  together overseeing the battle front against your asia and then it lists fifty battles
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.120]  they've won together in the last six months and just how their incredible comrades and
[11:08.120 --> 11:12.800]  how big brother you know carried machine gun bullets himself up to the front lines to the
[11:12.800 --> 11:18.280]  wonderful double plus good troops this is the exact same thing and that's why they're
[11:18.280 --> 11:22.560]  psychologically now coming out and going yeah we put out fake bin Laden videos yeah we're
[11:22.560 --> 11:28.240]  growing the opium after all these years saying they didn't and yeah we killed the same taliban
[11:28.240 --> 11:33.960]  al-qaeda leaders four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen
[11:33.960 --> 11:37.760]  sixteen seventeen oh it's up to close to twenty times they've killed certain leaders and they
[11:37.760 --> 11:43.360]  never reverse it they never say oh we didn't you know we were wrong the last five times
[11:43.360 --> 11:52.840]  we said we killed habip durka durka but this time this time we you know we really did
[11:52.840 --> 12:00.520]  killing no no no they just say we killed habip durka durker whatever made up name it is we
[12:00.520 --> 12:04.360]  we killed him and then we've been hunting him for years and we're sure we killed him
[12:04.360 --> 12:09.000]  and we have the body and then they announced two months later they killed him again it's
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.200]  it's just training you see I'm gonna understand this more and more you know you think you
[12:15.200 --> 12:20.920]  understand 1984 when you read it in high school and then again in college and then again I've
[12:20.920 --> 12:27.480]  probably read 1984 four or five times and every time I read it it becomes more horrifying
[12:27.480 --> 12:33.720]  because you realize as Orwell said right before he died the book was only out a year before
[12:33.720 --> 12:39.080]  he died a lot of evidences they poisoned him he didn't really died tuberculosis I mean
[12:39.080 --> 12:45.600]  he went he went and hid out in Scotland on an honest secluded island and it was scared
[12:45.600 --> 12:51.840]  to death according to his family while he was riding it you know why because Eric Blair
[12:51.840 --> 12:57.080]  aka George Arwell had been a member of the Indian secret police the the British Royal
[12:57.080 --> 13:06.400]  Imperial Guard in India less than 100,000 people dominating 500 million at the time
[13:06.400 --> 13:12.240]  now it's over a billion they might have been 400 million at the time whatever the point
[13:12.240 --> 13:18.600]  is that he'd he'd been there then he thought he was fighting the empire went and joined
[13:18.600 --> 13:22.800]  the communist and got shot through the throat and was in a bunch of heavy fighting for a
[13:22.800 --> 13:35.640]  year in the foreign brigades in the Spanish Civil War in Spain and then he became homeless
[13:35.640 --> 13:40.920]  for a few years just to experience as he came from a good family upper middle class kind
[13:40.920 --> 13:49.600]  of the milk royalty as they would call it in Poland but this was in England the first
[13:49.600 --> 13:54.520]  echelon the lowest echelon of a leadest of a risk of aristocrats but again I digress
[13:54.520 --> 14:02.800]  from that and so he went and lived for years basically as a homeless person and by homeless
[14:02.800 --> 14:11.320]  I mean he would work 15 16 hours a day and down and out in Paris and London wrote a book
[14:11.320 --> 14:19.840]  about it and he would literally go work 14 15 sometimes 18 hours a day and then go live
[14:19.840 --> 14:27.520]  in a stone floored hovel with 10 other people and he would have no sores all over him even
[14:27.520 --> 14:31.520]  though he had money he wanted to experience this and then he went and he was homeless
[14:31.520 --> 14:38.800]  in England even up until the 40s they would lock you up in the poor houses at night they
[14:38.800 --> 14:44.280]  locked the homeless people up and also would take you off to work camps and he told that
[14:44.280 --> 14:53.480]  whole story and then the war started and he went as a journalist and worked at the BBC
[14:53.480 --> 15:00.560]  in propaganda and of course he is Winston Smith in the book he's basically writing about
[15:00.560 --> 15:13.120]  himself but seeing his contemporary decades in the future we wrote the book in 1948 he
[15:13.120 --> 15:20.320]  saw himself in the future reversing 1948 with 1984 with the type of world he saw that was
[15:20.320 --> 15:25.900]  going to be built and of course another elitist even more elite from one of the most powerful
[15:25.900 --> 15:33.960]  families in England in the technocratic field all this Huxley wrote in 33 about genetic engineering
[15:33.960 --> 15:42.720]  totally brainwashed populations far past the oppression that Orwell foresaw and that's
[15:42.720 --> 15:50.920]  why in 62 before he died Huxley went public at Berkeley and said well George Orwell is
[15:50.920 --> 15:57.400]  dead we're going to have a jack booted enforcement arm a black ski mask you basically swat team
[15:57.400 --> 16:02.240]  arm that will come physically kill you if they have to but they're not going to need
[16:02.240 --> 16:09.360]  to with entertainment with drugs with genetic engineering you won't even be able to revolt
[16:09.360 --> 16:20.600]  because it'll be like a revolt of sheep against the practice of eating mutton that's actually
[16:20.600 --> 16:25.480]  a Bertrand Russell quote but they all say similar things just laughing at us how there's
[16:25.480 --> 16:37.640]  no way we can stop them
[16:37.640 --> 16:52.360]  the reason I digress down this rabbit trail today is because we're living in a 1984 society
[16:52.360 --> 16:57.500]  the language has been reduced it's been dumbed down much of the public you can't even communicate
[16:57.500 --> 17:03.400]  whether they weren't given building blocks as children mentally historically societally
[17:03.400 --> 17:12.160]  acknowledged is just basically unknown they're just little entertained children in the west
[17:12.160 --> 17:18.720]  about to be reduced down the level of slaves but in that process of them having all their
[17:18.720 --> 17:26.280]  toys taken away they're going to be used as a political weapon to rob anyone politically
[17:26.280 --> 17:30.640]  of their second amendment of their property rights of everything on the next phase they're
[17:30.640 --> 17:38.920]  going to use the depression to communalize the wealth and then sick the working class
[17:38.920 --> 17:43.920]  on anyone who has a dollar more than they do and then of course that will destroy any
[17:43.920 --> 17:48.240]  final engine of wealth production and the globalists believe they're going to have full
[17:48.240 --> 17:55.120]  domination over the society I mean this is really going to be bad and that's the game
[17:55.120 --> 18:04.960]  plan now if you're in China or India you're working 12 14 hours in chemical plants and
[18:04.960 --> 18:11.560]  in fabs with basically no safety equipment breathing deadly poison and you work in them
[18:11.560 --> 18:18.280]  10 years and you die a liver failure and they just throw you in a big junk pile big dump
[18:18.280 --> 18:22.480]  mass suicides everywhere the government openly drives around with trucks grabbing women off
[18:22.480 --> 18:27.080]  the street sterilizing them it's mainstream news our government doesn't criticize China
[18:27.080 --> 18:31.720]  they actually say it's a great idea and they they you know they come out at the Bill and
[18:31.720 --> 18:36.800]  Melinda Gates Foundation and say China is now genetically testing everyone at birth
[18:36.800 --> 18:43.640]  to decide who and what they're going to be according to their DNA and of course they
[18:43.640 --> 18:48.560]  decide what's good DNA and what isn't and we know what we're going into and they've
[18:48.560 --> 18:55.240]  made the decision to just flood everything with admissions of world government admissions
[18:55.240 --> 19:00.920]  of deadly vaccines yeah there's a cancer virus in that MMR gonna give it to your kid so what
[19:00.920 --> 19:05.400]  it's going to kill you 20 years from now sure the RNA is going to plug into all your cells
[19:05.400 --> 19:09.520]  so what sure it's going to wear down your immune system and then kill you it's just
[19:09.520 --> 19:15.360]  all out in the open yeah we we grow the drugs yeah we ship them in yeah we make fake al-qaeda
[19:15.360 --> 19:19.880]  videos yeah we kill innocent people with drones yeah we're turning the public schools into
[19:19.880 --> 19:23.840]  prisons yeah we're putting RFID in all your products yeah we're listening to everything
[19:23.840 --> 19:27.760]  you say and do yeah we're training your kids to tattle on you and spy on you yeah we're
[19:27.760 --> 19:31.520]  merging the local police with the feds and training them for gun confiscation yeah we're
[19:31.520 --> 19:35.600]  getting ready to take everything you've gotten yeah we're getting ready to put vaccines in
[19:35.600 --> 19:40.240]  the food so you don't have a way to escape it and airborne spray it on you and to the

[24:17.280 --> 24:25.400]  little paradigm one little universe of looking into the mind of George Arwell and reading
[24:25.400 --> 24:32.800]  a book about a futuristic police state but then another elitist who understands the
[24:32.800 --> 24:39.920]  bigger picture Huxley goes no no no no no no this is how the tyranny is going to work
[24:39.920 --> 24:48.920]  propaganda brainwashing chemicals in the food chemicals in the water written in 1933 brave
[24:48.920 --> 24:59.160]  new world go read brave new world almost 80 years later and look at how everything in
[24:59.160 --> 25:03.720]  it is now being phased in because once these people get a plan they don't stop and he explains
[25:03.720 --> 25:10.680]  oh my brother heads up the United Nations at the time in 62 Julian Huxley this is the
[25:10.680 --> 25:15.120]  system we're going to set up and the elite believes you're so stupid I can sit here and
[25:15.120 --> 25:21.240]  even tell you this and there's nothing you're going to do it's possible to make them love
[25:21.240 --> 25:31.720]  their servitude you know pull up Berkeley speech Aldous Huxley hour long you can even
[25:31.720 --> 25:40.240]  hear the class clapping think of all the little technocrats all the elitist at Microsoft
[25:40.240 --> 25:52.120]  and Apple who were actually in that class who were actually at that convention building
[25:52.120 --> 25:58.280]  that auditorium see when Bill Gates a few months ago gets up and says we need to reduce
[25:58.280 --> 26:02.440]  the carbon footprint by half and the best way to do it is by cutting the human population
[26:02.440 --> 26:08.280]  by half and we're going to do this through vaccines he said it straight out knowing the
[26:08.280 --> 26:13.840]  average person watching it later but the the crowd began laughing and giggling uncomfortably
[26:13.840 --> 26:20.960]  and and and then it cuts to their faces and they were this makes me feel so powerful I
[26:20.960 --> 26:27.720]  paid $6,000 to be part of the Ted TV convention no I come and hear the elitist and I'm a globalist
[26:27.720 --> 26:34.600]  want to be on and most of our CEOs and high-level and mid-level people it's like their church
[26:34.600 --> 26:45.120]  tithe they go to Ted TV and hear the globalist gospel that's the admission was $6,000 on
[26:45.120 --> 26:51.160]  average some people get let him for free media so you get to hear Bill Gates sit there and
[26:51.160 --> 26:57.440]  giggle and laugh and talk and they only put out little select short clips oh we're gonna
[26:57.440 --> 27:01.720]  let you know Bill Gates talked about killing half of you and Bill Gates smiles and laughs
[27:01.720 --> 27:07.160]  with pleasure when they all smile and laugh with him it's because you know the public's
[27:07.160 --> 27:15.080]  too dumb to get it I can't tell you how many elitist I've talked to some even high level
[27:15.080 --> 27:19.720]  I've talked to elitist next to the very highest level and the highest level probably only
[27:19.720 --> 27:30.240]  has 400 people in it or less okay I've talked to the very highest levels of the power structure
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.480]  I guess I've even talked to the head of the former head of the Kissinger group so I've
[27:35.480 --> 27:40.760]  talked to the inner in the inner 300 400 or so there's an inner council within that but
[27:40.760 --> 27:52.200]  the point is and they all say on or off air Alex the public is a bunch of idiots if you
[27:52.200 --> 27:56.640]  gave them freedom they'd slit your throat in a minute they want to be slaves they want
[27:56.640 --> 28:03.000]  to be exterminated look at how we're in control look at how the establishment is in control
[28:03.000 --> 28:09.720]  look at how we're in control Alex doesn't that prove that it's our right to be in control
[28:09.720 --> 28:20.000]  survival of the fittest social Darwinism that guys will you print me the definition
[28:20.000 --> 28:29.680]  of social Darwinism instead of me just sitting here and and going over my layman's definition
[28:29.680 --> 28:47.320]  of social Darwinism will you print me the definition of social Darwinism
[28:47.320 --> 28:57.640]  social Darwinism my friends and then you can have a debate about whether or not you agree
[28:57.640 --> 29:03.520]  with them the problem is the average college graduate has been given kind of the outer
[29:03.520 --> 29:09.480]  temple doctrine that's how many religions are designed you have the inner group of the
[29:09.480 --> 29:17.640]  cult and then you have the outer group of the cult who who are only given parts of the overall
[29:17.640 --> 29:24.160]  agenda it's a form of compartmentalization but the outer cult sees themselves as liberal
[29:24.160 --> 29:28.880]  believes there's too many people we've got to have a world government we've got to have
[29:28.880 --> 29:33.520]  an organized society run by us the elite but the outer group always thinks they are the
[29:33.520 --> 29:43.040]  ultimate elite but the question all of those outer acolytes or outer party people have
[29:43.040 --> 29:50.640]  to ask themselves is are you part of the elite for real let's talk about that we come back
[29:50.640 --> 30:00.160]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network hi folks
[30:00.160 --> 30:04.680]  this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap not detergents

[30:34.600 --> 31:04.400]  to say with the implementation of codex elementaries it is clear that we must
[31:04.400 --> 31:08.320]  start quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are
[31:08.320 --> 31:14.900]  concerned as of January 1st 2010 codex elementaries was implemented within the European Union
[31:14.900 --> 31:20.240]  resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements including colloidal silver we
[31:20.240 --> 31:24.920]  must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and
[31:24.920 --> 31:29.360]  our families act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in
[31:29.360 --> 31:34.160]  the privacy of your own home colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more
[31:34.160 --> 31:39.040]  than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous unpredictable

[32:06.400 --> 32:10.520]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[32:10.520 --> 32:14.680]  or gold its true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country

[32:56.720 --> 33:11.720]  jones for survival seed bank dot com in the last hour today i am gonna spend much of the
[33:11.720 --> 33:18.800]  time we have on the nature of the new world order and their mindset and the type of world
[33:18.800 --> 33:25.000]  they're building but if the general public cannot educate themselves on what makes the
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.760]  controllers tick and what their global plan is you you have no chance of ever even being
[33:30.760 --> 33:40.400]  involved in the world or your future or having any impact on it so the average churchgoer
[33:40.400 --> 33:47.240]  the average liberal the average conservative the average professional in the last hundred
[33:47.240 --> 33:52.160]  years has been taught there's too many people poor people are scum you've got to do them
[33:52.160 --> 33:58.380]  a favor you've got to sterilize them and you know at certain levels you can see their
[33:58.380 --> 34:08.440]  arguments at certain levels there's an argument there and that's why so many people buy into
[34:08.440 --> 34:16.840]  this but but it's it's the outer room of the system let me give you the big news flash
[34:16.840 --> 34:21.720]  here for the want to be elitist and people that tune in when you actually get deeper
[34:21.720 --> 34:28.440]  into globalist philosophy and operations they are targeting ninety nine point nine nine
[34:28.440 --> 34:34.880]  percent of the public you learn that top controllers less than four hundred of them spend almost
[34:34.880 --> 34:45.440]  all their time avoiding the soft kill degenerative and binary weapons in the air food and water
[34:45.440 --> 34:53.920]  and in the magnetic spectrum they're now introducing and admitting they are and that we are all
[34:53.920 --> 34:59.580]  under sustained control freak attack this is a religion of control freaks and the ultimate
[34:59.580 --> 35:06.560]  control is to control human genetics human reproduction human education human destiny
[35:06.560 --> 35:10.920]  because when you control ideas and when you control the wealth and when you control the
[35:10.920 --> 35:17.720]  farms and when you control the factories and when you control the societies you control
[35:17.720 --> 35:23.840]  it all you control the planet it isn't about money it isn't about bling the elites don't
[35:23.840 --> 35:37.640]  care about that the real money hides their money the real power structure is hidden
[35:37.640 --> 35:43.240]  just like the federal reserve never wanted to be on the radar and it's only the holding
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.720]  company of these people they want you talking about obama and john mccain and what you're
[35:47.720 --> 35:53.600]  talking about george w bush and his cousin carry who are nothing but high level front
[35:53.600 --> 36:04.520]  men high level gophers high level foils shills cutouts puppets fronts doormats and so for
[36:04.520 --> 36:10.960]  all of you you genesis want to be out there all of you that go to the mall and look down
[36:10.960 --> 36:17.400]  your nose at the hunchback people scurrying around mindlessly with their bling for all
[36:17.400 --> 36:23.400]  of you who have disdain instead of wanting to lift up these people you you you get off
[36:23.400 --> 36:29.480]  on a petty power trip do you understand you are being hit by soft kill weapons magnetic
[36:29.480 --> 36:37.160]  chemical biological i mean you really are being attacked hundreds of textbooks hundreds
[36:37.160 --> 36:42.360]  and hundreds of publications state department of randoms you in biological diversity assessments
[36:42.360 --> 36:49.800]  on and on and on and on and on talking about how they're going to build a world government
[36:49.800 --> 36:58.080]  and kill you they're just warming up with forced abortion in fantaside sterilization
[36:58.080 --> 37:02.480]  oh yeah they go into africa and quote give them some gmo crops that sterilize them and
[37:02.480 --> 37:08.080]  claim they're helping them and tell them yeah go on birth controller get sterilized and
[37:08.080 --> 37:12.560]  we'll give you five thousand dollars and then you can even see the argument of look oh she
[37:12.560 --> 37:17.920]  won't have eight kids now four of which on average will die you know she'll have one
[37:17.920 --> 37:26.080]  child or no children but she'll get this money the point is this is undemocratic unelected
[37:26.080 --> 37:33.200]  power by a group that isn't just wiping out poor people and that's bad but their real
[37:33.200 --> 37:41.880]  enemy is anybody who is intelligent and isn't part of their program and then you get a doctor
[37:41.880 --> 37:47.840]  eric pionka ut who is a real insider and travels to europe with me with you know with prince
[37:47.840 --> 37:54.040]  charles and philip and gets all these awards and the guy can barely talk and he's on the
[37:54.040 --> 38:01.080]  ut website dressed up as a druidic priest talking about lucifer on the ut website that's why
[38:01.080 --> 38:09.560]  he's over there because he is a zombie self-hating demon and gives speeches where he talks about
[38:09.560 --> 38:14.360]  i know me and my family are gonna have to die soon i'm ready for the airborne abola
[38:14.360 --> 38:19.160]  and can't wait for it to come it's sad my children have to die but this is what we have
[38:19.160 --> 38:24.280]  to do for earth and prince charles is just like you are a beautiful creature prince philip
[38:24.280 --> 38:32.800]  is yes dr pionka you are incredible you realize your scum and need to die for me so the earth

[38:45.000 --> 38:53.480]  criticizing him and it became national news and and and i would have his graduate students
[38:53.480 --> 38:57.480]  send me emails going you know what you want to read my graduate paper here's a link to
[38:57.480 --> 39:04.240]  it he is a great man he is incredible and i'll tell you this he only wants 90 dead who could
[39:04.240 --> 39:08.680]  rationally disagree with the fact that all humans must be killed we are a cancer we are
[39:08.680 --> 39:15.520]  a plague then i started googling these people's names there they were in white lab coats working
[39:15.520 --> 39:20.400]  in bio weapons laboratories genetic engineering facilities oh they run everything and they're
[39:20.400 --> 39:25.040]  going to do it they're gonna do it just as sure as the sun comes up so go ahead power
[39:25.040 --> 39:28.640]  tripping cops on steroids who think you're part of the new world order think you've got

[39:42.800 --> 39:52.880]  ladies and gentlemen understand that you are not being honest oh pionkas being honest
[39:52.880 --> 39:57.280]  so are his graduate students that have got white papers out there their graduate thesis
[39:57.280 --> 40:02.520]  on killing everyone go read them we've linked to them over the years on the websites prison
[40:02.520 --> 40:09.760]  planet dot com info wars dot com you know i read some of the dark philosophy written
[40:09.760 --> 40:15.200]  by these people and they talk about it will be a great honor to be the last human that
[40:15.200 --> 40:22.240]  last human who will then kill themselves and knowing that the earth will go back to rewilding
[40:22.240 --> 40:29.280]  and a beautiful jewel will be the greatest human in history yeah meanwhile you care about
[40:29.280 --> 40:38.800]  the dallas cowboys win lose or draw you care about crow's feet at the edge of your eyes
[40:38.800 --> 40:46.160]  you care about getting old you women care about how good looking you are you better
[40:46.160 --> 40:53.040]  be caring about saving your children and the species why do you think the u n has built
[40:53.040 --> 40:58.720]  no fewer than 50 different seed vaults around the world the only one to get big attention
[40:58.720 --> 41:11.720]  is the one up at the north pole every seed they've got other vaults of the sperm and
[41:11.720 --> 41:17.000]  eggs of other mammals usually when i read the list of what the grants are what they're
[41:17.000 --> 41:24.200]  holding they don't have any human genetics that's not going to be needed and i'm just
[41:24.200 --> 41:28.720]  supposed to sit here and go about my business and watch these people circling around us like
[41:28.720 --> 41:34.880]  wolves and bill gates is up there giving press releases on the gates foundation dot org about
[41:34.880 --> 41:39.840]  it's wonderful a lot of people are trying to avoid vaccines now but it doesn't matter
[41:39.840 --> 41:44.120]  because we have airborne systems that will be delivered by aircraft by mosquito that
[41:44.120 --> 41:52.120]  we release that carry it and by rice and squash and sugar beets and potatoes that will deliver
[41:52.120 --> 41:58.920]  of the new vaccine and it's going to be wonderful that the new vaccine will reduce population
[41:58.920 --> 42:07.720]  by half and the whole crowd giggles and makes little monkey noises we're on a power trip
[42:07.720 --> 42:18.000]  cult because i mean these you understand that this is the ultimate extension of the people
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.880]  that get in the fast lane when it says seventy and they're doing fifty and they'll get with
[42:21.880 --> 42:26.000]  a little team member beside each other and block both lanes and you'll see them with
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.520]  satisfaction looking over that's the spiritual counterpart of what we're dealing with instead
[42:31.520 --> 42:36.120]  of saying you know we need to have great debates about population and should we start you know
[42:36.120 --> 42:42.280]  going off planet no it isn't about population that's their excuse to bring full control
[42:42.280 --> 42:51.040]  over the human species they're playing god folks everything they do everything they do
[42:51.040 --> 42:56.280]  their big government buildings that are imposing and make you feel small their tax collector
[42:56.280 --> 43:01.560]  ads it's you know look at you from space and say hi tom nice car nice house we're going
[43:01.560 --> 43:05.880]  to come get you tom oh and you know police chiefs for now in the news going yeah we are
[43:05.880 --> 43:11.400]  black mask to intimidate you we're secret police you know it's come out that large percentages
[43:11.400 --> 43:16.800]  and some police forces half the cops are on steroids including the women forward police
[43:16.800 --> 43:26.080]  chief promotes hormone therapy wfa a sex drive mental focus energy and he talks about injecting
[43:26.080 --> 43:33.560]  his troops as he calls them with testosterone how about a swollen heart how about that it
[43:33.560 --> 43:38.720]  reduces your regular hormone output once you go off of it how about teaching cops they
[43:38.720 --> 43:44.800]  can do a full body heavyweight power clings and squats and boost testosterone by more
[43:44.800 --> 43:49.760]  than 40% on average I wouldn't dare do that folks with my natural testosterone I want
[43:49.760 --> 43:54.040]  to tear people's heads off every day but I did when I got in super good shape by the
[43:54.040 --> 44:00.640]  time I was about 20 I could squat 600 bench press 320 and let me tell you folks I found
[44:00.640 --> 44:04.600]  the secret but also notice my hair started falling out because I was doing power clings
[44:04.600 --> 44:09.120]  twice a week squats my testosterone shot up and I quit because I went and read the medical
[44:09.120 --> 44:14.000]  research and learned I'd boosted my testosterone massively naturally and you know what I like
[44:14.000 --> 44:20.160]  my hair and not wanting to kill people more than I did boosting my testosterone what in
[44:20.160 --> 44:26.280]  Hades are police doing openly admitting their own roids now you do not need steroids you
[44:26.280 --> 44:34.520]  do not need the testosterone you've got in this society give me but my point is they've
[44:34.520 --> 44:39.160]  been drugging for 30 years our own troops and now they're given a methamphetamine you
[44:39.160 --> 44:43.560]  know pharmaceutical grade they're giving them psychotropic they're giving him a halcyon
[44:43.560 --> 44:48.600]  amnesic mind control drugs they're putting the troops on roids I mean we are just completely
[44:48.600 --> 44:54.080]  fried they're putting the military they're putting the cops on them this is the THX 1138
[44:54.080 --> 44:59.480]  system they're drugging your water supply they're openly announcing Japan wants to put
[44:59.480 --> 45:03.240]  lithium in their water they're pushing it here they're already doing it boys and girls
[45:03.240 --> 45:07.320]  they're already drugging the hell out of you so that's why cops feel like they need testosterone
[45:07.320 --> 45:12.640]  because they're lethargic and because they're so afraid of the public they're all souped
[45:12.640 --> 45:17.880]  up every time they go up to a car it's burning them out if you just tried being calm and
[45:17.880 --> 45:24.080]  in a position of mental power you wouldn't need to be jacked up in fear all you got to
[45:24.080 --> 45:29.000]  do is to let go of the fear as soon as you're not worried about somebody killing you you're
[45:29.000 --> 45:36.960]  icy you're in control no you don't need steroids by the way that may help you for a year or
[45:36.960 --> 45:41.360]  maybe two but then you're gonna have to have them and then the government has you right
[45:41.360 --> 45:45.360]  where they want you and then your testicles shrivel up to the size of grapes I'm just
[45:45.360 --> 45:50.480]  I'm just giving you the newsflash here folks and you fry the real testosterone you got
[45:50.480 --> 45:56.280]  you got the testosterone you need okay try ramming your head into a wall try boxing try
[45:56.280 --> 46:04.200]  getting hardcore excuse me I mean the point is is that these people are out of their minds
[46:04.200 --> 46:13.880]  folks I can't believe that they've got cops I don't know I guess some men may need it
[46:13.880 --> 46:20.240]  I guess some men don't have hair on their chest or fire in their eyes but most of its
[46:20.240 --> 46:28.320]  mental boys the roids you think you need Fort Worth police chief promotes hormone therapy
[46:28.320 --> 46:33.560]  all were topics of discussion in recent voluntary wellness seminar at Fort Worth police officers
[46:33.560 --> 46:38.160]  chief Jeffrey Halstead called the meeting to share his testimony about testosterone
[46:38.160 --> 46:44.600]  and yeah maybe if you're a 55 year old cop and you've been drinking GMO milk and been
[46:44.600 --> 46:49.320]  drinking out of plastic containers that have estrogen mimicers how about here's here's
[46:49.320 --> 46:53.400]  what I meant to say when I saw this article yesterday I never got to it I see articles
[46:53.400 --> 46:58.320]  every few weeks about England Europe in the US where girls now by the tens of thousands
[46:58.320 --> 47:04.560]  in the US the tens of thousands in Europe are going into puberty at age eight some at
[47:04.560 --> 47:11.000]  age six just like fish are going into puberty and frogs are going into puberty going into
[47:11.000 --> 47:16.360]  reproductive cycle earlier and earlier some are being born in reproductive cycles it's
[47:16.360 --> 47:21.320]  the hormones in the water it's the hormones were dumping it's the hormones humans are
[47:21.320 --> 47:26.080]  being fed as part of the sterilization that's getting to the fish and getting to the frogs
[47:26.080 --> 47:30.640]  in every case it's municipal water that's that's then being offloaded into the into
[47:30.640 --> 47:36.080]  the ecosystem and here's my issue I read these articles about an eight year old goes
[47:36.080 --> 47:41.880]  into puberty so they take them in and they give the girl or the boy shots to suppress
[47:41.880 --> 47:47.280]  what's happening instead of getting them off the hormones and the water and the food and
[47:47.280 --> 47:53.920]  the GMO milk I mean let me tell you something if they're giving mama cows a genetically
[47:53.920 --> 47:59.200]  engineered hormone that makes them produce almost twice as much milk what do you think
[47:59.200 --> 48:08.120]  that's going to do to your five year old daughter pal I mean this is two plus two equals four
[48:08.120 --> 48:14.040]  now this is one plus one equals two or this is just what is that number like when you
[48:14.040 --> 48:20.840]  ask your two year old what is that number one this isn't even one plus one of course
[48:20.840 --> 48:28.800]  of course the municipal water supply reservoirs have got frogs at birth going into puberty
[48:28.800 --> 48:33.480]  of course they got male frogs that are females female frogs that are hyper female and are
[48:33.480 --> 48:38.040]  dying of cancers of course women have got their breasts rotting off left and right because
[48:38.040 --> 48:43.120]  you're drinking all these hormones you went into puberty when you were nine years old
[48:43.120 --> 48:48.400]  and you've got the body sexually of a sixty five year old when you're thirty you've been
[48:48.400 --> 48:57.600]  hit with a chemical weapon attack you're being murdered and they think it's real funny well
[48:57.600 --> 49:02.160]  I don't think it's funny it makes me angry okay so these people sit up there in their
[49:02.160 --> 49:06.520]  little power trips and there's all this video of Bill Gates kissing on little black kids
[49:06.520 --> 49:10.080]  just like when you read Margaret Sanger with the Rockefellers going I want to kill these
[49:10.080 --> 49:14.920]  black animals these subhuman weeds these are all close we're gonna have to hire a bunch
[49:14.920 --> 49:21.040]  of blacks as fronts and pose with them and like we love them I'm talking to Ed Bernays
[49:21.040 --> 49:28.680]  on how to carry this out oh we'll get them don't you worry oh yeah oh we're gonna get
[49:28.680 --> 49:33.720]  ya see this is the real world folks this is what's really happening this is what's going
[49:33.720 --> 49:45.080]  on this is what you face as a society
[49:45.080 --> 49:51.280]  and so instead of telling the cops hey you don't have the sperm count of somebody fifty
[49:51.280 --> 49:56.280]  years ago or somebody ten years ago you don't have the testosterone count of a men twenty
[49:56.280 --> 50:02.120]  years ago thirty years ago forty years ago why is that well sodium fluoride attacks and
[50:02.120 --> 50:07.840]  lowers testosterone in every other endocrine released system go read the studies it's an
[50:07.840 --> 50:13.640]  absolute fact let me see all of the major plastics that have been accepted because there's hundreds
[50:13.640 --> 50:17.960]  of plastic formulas but they picked the few that have the estrogen mimicker just by accident
[50:17.960 --> 50:24.840]  globally they're used it's just a coincidence oh gee all of these major GMO foods we've
[50:24.840 --> 50:30.800]  been eating the last decade in all the studies sterilized or reduced fertility in every major
[50:30.800 --> 50:39.400]  mammal species oh gee the vaccine inserts say reduces fertility oh gee no instead they're
[50:39.400 --> 50:45.080]  gonna turn the cops all into a bunch of drugged out zombies running around murdering people
[50:45.080 --> 50:49.920]  because they're on testosterone folks do you have any idea why men are vicious and attack
[50:49.920 --> 50:54.600]  people it's testosterone you don't take more of it you don't need it you're not designed
[50:54.600 --> 51:04.480]  to have it do you understand that global meltdowns massive unemployment endless wars a new currency
[51:04.480 --> 51:09.920]  crisis financially and morally bankrupt a great and terrible storm is approaching so what's

[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:58.480]  we've got a very informative guest coming up for the rest of the hour in the next segment
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:04.480]  and then we got Bob Chapman coming on about the economy I'll intersperse important news when he's on with us like this news

[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.480]  take over local small banks that are healthy gives the criminal banks all the power over everything
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:43.480]  as dr. Paul Craig Roberts told you yesterday former head of policy department of the Treasury
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:48.480]  you know it's not just me saying that or the Texas Banking Association saying that Goldman Sachs
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:54.480]  and others are really going to rape everybody now oh you you set up a huge implosion to consolidate power
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:01.480]  here's more power that will teach you are blowouts coming in California with regime change in November
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:07.480]  and it says that all the polls show that every mainline Democratic incumbent and a lot of Republican incumbents are in trouble

[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.480]  we won't be able to escape California it's a beautiful state got a lot of wonderful people in it
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:40.480]  but it's also got a lot of airheads in it and California better wake up and go absolutely ape now
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:46.480]  or you will be fully imploded by the globalist they want you to fail you understand that
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:51.480]  in fact here's another one bankruptcy talks spreads among California municipal officials
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:55.480]  and then they'll go bankrupt with the state the state will go bankrupt this is out of Reuters
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:02.480]  and then they'll go bankrupt with the foreign bankers who will wave a magic fairy wand and go oh here's a hundred billion more

[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.480]  because we made it up out of nothing and we're the bankers and you're a bunch of gullible idiots
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:26.480]  in every other state Texas it doesn't matter they're going to rape every one of you until you get angry and wake up
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.480]  they're never going to stop they know exactly what they're doing
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:36.480]  here's a big article by Paul Joseph Watson guess what we found out they're the same corporation
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:42.480]  that did the bond proposal and built the hardened 28 million dollar facility that no one ever moved into
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:46.480]  that we have the blueprints for that is to be used by FEMA
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.480]  that's up on our Alex Jones YouTube channel private corporation building detention camps across America
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:58.480]  that call Watson he wrote this yesterday have him add that YouTube video I posted of inside the facility

[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.480]  it says alien detention facility and that doesn't mean little green men folks
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.480]  that means U.S. citizens stripped under the enemy combatant act
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:24.480]  and put in there and then CNN admits that they were looking at the facility as a detention facility
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:29.480]  for citizens and others and we went and showed the blueprints
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:36.480]  but the issue is the same companies building them all over the U.S. and getting sucker locals to fund it
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.480]  so that's coming up when Bob Chapman's on with us

[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:22.480]  Alex Jones
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.480]  we're live ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.480]  the 28th day of May
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.480]  2010 on this Friday edition
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:34.480]  two days ago we posted the amazing article written by Paul Joseph Watson
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.480]  at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.480]  top construction firm WTC
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.480]  destroyed by controlled demolition
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.480]  now remember just a month ago
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:48.480]  back on April 23rd the headline bombshell
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:52.480]  Silverstein wanted to demolish building 7 on 9-1-1
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.480]  that is from Fox News
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.480]  but the Fox News reporter said I was there that day
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.480]  I was with Silverstein and the emergency management people
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.480]  and yes they did say they were looking at wiring and blowing up 7
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:07.480]  but magically it fell on its own so we didn't have to blow it up
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.480]  well it takes weeks of not months to properly demolish a 47-story building
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.480]  a few years ago they tried to blow up the Intel building in Austin
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.480]  a top firm did
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.480]  it failed
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.480]  Intel in the late 90s during the.com bus
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.480]  finished the skeleton of the building
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.480]  then it collapsed the.com bubble
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:26.480]  so that they never finished it
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.480]  but they couldn't even blow up the skeleton of it
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.480]  on the first try
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.480]  the superstructure
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.480]  and then we have all the police and firemen footage
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:37.480]  I'm not going to go back over today we may play some
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.480]  where the cops are saying get back, get back, get back
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.480]  we're going to blow it up
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.480]  we're going to blow up 7
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.480]  and I remembered
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.480]  being in the car that day I'd been on air all day
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:49.480]  I ran out of the studio to get a pizza
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.480]  literally a half mile away to scarf it
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:55.480]  I was scarfing it in the car as I was driving back to go back on air
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.480]  and
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.480]  they were on ABC News saying they're going to blow up building 7
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.480]  and then I talked about it
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.480]  and people said you're a conspiracy theorist
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.480]  well it turns out there's scores of newscast now including BBC
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.480]  where they did a false script
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.480]  and announced that it had fallen in its own footprint
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.480]  25 minutes before it did
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.480]  so
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.480]  there's no doubt folks they blew up building 7
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.480]  we had Barry Jennings the deputy head of New York emergency management
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.480]  on
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.480]  two weeks later he died mysteriously
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.480]  and
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.480]  he was getting threats
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.480]  and he said yeah they blew up building 7
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.480]  so this isn't a game we're playing
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.480]  I mean I hope you understand that
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.480]  now you can debate who carried out 9-11
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.480]  who had the means, opportunity
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.480]  the motive
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.480]  and who thought they could get away with it
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.480]  and that's the western power structure
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.480]  no one else
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.480]  that's England, the US, Israel
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.480]  they're all joined at the hip
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.480]  but for the next hour
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.480]  and then a little bit into the next hour the Bob Chapman's joining us
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.480]  Alan Hart joins us
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.480]  because
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.480]  he's another window into this
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.480]  you have this Fox News reporter
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.480]  going with the lie saying yeah
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.480]  okay we were there, they were talking about blowing it up
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.480]  but we didn't
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.480]  so your conspiracy theorist forever saying
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.480]  we did
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.480]  and then you've got all the firemen saying
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.480]  yeah they told us they blew it up
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.480]  and then they get fired or threatened and the cops saying
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.480]  yeah they said they blew it up
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.480]  I've interviewed those cops Bartmer and others
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.480]  I've gone and found the cops who were on the CNN video
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.480]  and get back, they're bringing it down folks
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.480]  we have the live footage
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.480]  get back, they're blowing it up
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.480]  and then again the cops weren't involved
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:35.480]  they were brought into it
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.480]  and then once they've accepted it
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.480]  they just engage in
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.480]  crime stop or double think
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.480]  and then they don't talk about it but I'm going to shut up
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.480]  it's just to get into building 7
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.480]  to get into 9-11, to get into the NORAD stand down
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.480]  to get into US and British troops
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.480]  mass in and around Afghanistan
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.480]  in the two months before
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.480]  this week admitting Bush signed the attack order
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.480]  to go into Afghanistan on September 10
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.480]  and Jeb Bush declared martial law
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.480]  two days before in Florida, AP
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.480]  and hijackers trained at US bases
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.480]  they thought they were taking part in a drill
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.480]  on and on
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.480]  it's all confirmed
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.480]  but to have another eyewitness
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.480]  who's a prestigious pedigree
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.480]  with the BBC, ITN
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.480]  top correspondent in the Middle East
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.480]  interviewing the Shaw
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.480]  Yasser Arafat
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.480]  the highest level of journalist
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.480]  Alan Hart
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.480]  blowing the whistle that day one
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.480]  he was witnessing the cover-up
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:31.480]  in the media
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.480]  the self-censorship
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.480]  that because people are
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.480]  it's like
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.480]  Albert Speer, the German
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.480]  interior minister of the architect
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.480]  was asked later
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.480]  why did you go along with Hitler, why did you do all this
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.480]  because he was known as an intellectual and an aristocrat
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.480]  and they actually let him off
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.480]  because the British liked him so much at Nuremberg
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.480]  and he said
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.480]  well, when the devil's got his arm around you
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:57.480]  being nice to you, you don't recognize it's the devil
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.480]  and just once you're in it, you're in it
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.480]  well, folks, we gotta say we're not part of this
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.480]  the media, everybody
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.480]  again, I'm gonna shut up
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.480]  and I apologize for spending some time here with this precious guest
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.480]  I just wanted to preface it
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.480]  Alan, you don't like talking about yourself
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.480]  but you've got such a lengthy bio
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.480]  it'd be like talking about Muhammad Ali's boxing career
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.480]  that would take an hour
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.480]  to just hit the highlights
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.480]  but for those that don't know who Alan Hart is
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.480]  and the website's alanhart.net
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.480]  tell us about your career, what you've done
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.480]  and why you're going public now
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.480]  well, Alex, first of all, let me say
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.480]  I'm delighted to become a member of your
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.480]  truth-telling society if I can put it like that
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.480]  and I'd like to tell you why
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:37.480]  in two sentences
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.480]  when I became a very young reporter
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.480]  with independent television news
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.480]  more than 40 years ago
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.480]  my editor-in-chief gave me the
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.480]  mission statement in one short sentence
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.480]  quote
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.480]  our job is to help keep
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.480]  democracy alive
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.480]  unquote
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.480]  and my take today
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.480]  Alex is quite simple
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:01.480]  the mainstream media has betrayed
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.480]  democracy
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.480]  I suspect you might go along with that too, yeah
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.480]  they certainly have, they've been part of the
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.480]  complete overthrow of our society
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.480]  okay, well Alex, my background is
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.480]  I've been in
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.480]  journalism and
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:17.480]  I've been doing secret politics in the
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.480]  Middle East for the best part of 40 years
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.480]  I have two
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.480]  claims to fame in a sense
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.480]  I am the only person
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.480]  on earth, I think
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.480]  who enjoyed intimate access to
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.480]  and on the human level friendship
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.480]  with the two greatest
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.480]  opposites in all of human history
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.480]  Gorda Meir, mother Israel
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.480]  and Yasser Arafat, father Palestine
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.480]  I think there's nobody else on the planet
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.480]  who can say that
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.480]  my other claim to fame
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.480]  is that you know the first rule
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.480]  of journalism, Alex, if you
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.480]  offend both parties to a dispute
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.480]  or a conflict
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.480]  you're probably on the right track
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.480]  well I am red flagged
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.480]  by Zionism
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.480]  and the regimes
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.480]  of an impotent
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.480]  corrupt repressive Arab order
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.480]  both of those who
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.480]  have red flagged me so I guess I'm on the right track
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.480]  so basically
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.480]  what I bring to the table
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.480]  is 40 years
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.480]  of experience of covering the world
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.480]  in general, the Middle East in particular
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.480]  and I should add that I started
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.480]  to grow up as a person
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.480]  as a young reporter in Vietnam
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.480]  there I was watching America
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.480]  spending $6 million
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.480]  a minute destroying
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.480]  two countries, North and South Vietnam
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.480]  on a war it could not win
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.480]  and should not afford
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.480]  but I started to say to myself
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.480]  what the hell is this world all about?
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.480]  Amazing
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.480]  and again you're being
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.480]  meek about your amazing career
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.480]  sir and we appreciate you joining us
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.480]  we'll also talk about some of the books
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:55.480]  that you've written before you leave us
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.480]  but let's plunge into it now
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.480]  why have you decided to come out
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.480]  and lay out the fact
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.480]  that the media is self-censoring
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.480]  and that you talk to one of the biggest
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.480]  revolution firms in the world
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.480]  and that they did their own analysis
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.480]  and concluded it was controlled demolition
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.480]  okay well let's go head on to that Alex
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.480]  first of all I am not
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.480]  a late comer to the truth of 9-11
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.480]  I've been aware of the truth
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.480]  since a very few days
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.480]  after the Dirtful event happened
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.480]  but the point is this
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.480]  when I was completing my latest book
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.480]  it's an epic journey
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.480]  in three volumes through the lies
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.480]  and truth of history as it relates to the making
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.480]  and sustaining of the conflict
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.480]  in and over Palestine that became Israel
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.480]  I censored myself on the subject of 9-11
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.480]  because I didn't
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.480]  want to give supporters of Israel
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.480]  right or wrong
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.480]  the ammunition to dismiss me
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.480]  as a mad conspiracy theorist
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.480]  because of my views on 9-11
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.480]  in order to divert attention
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:55.480]  away from all the other truths
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.480]  I reveal in my book
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.480]  I think you'll understand what I'm saying Alex
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.480]  I understand
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.480]  where I am in America
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:05.480]  I didn't interview with another
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.480]  talk show host that I respect
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.480]  Kevin Barrett
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.480]  he asked about 9-11 so I thought
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.480]  hell the book's published
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:15.480]  volume 3 of the American edition
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.480]  is coming in a very few days
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.480]  so I decided that the time
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.480]  had come to end my own silence
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.480]  and the point is this
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.480]  what I think about 9-11
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.480]  as an individual is not important
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.480]  it's what people that I've learned
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.480]  to respect think
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.480]  now I have many friends
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:35.480]  in all walks of life
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:37.480]  politics, business, you name it
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:39.480]  and it so happens that two of my
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:41.480]  dearest friends
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.480]  are world leading consultants
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.480]  civil engineering consultants
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.480]  for one of the greatest
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:49.480]  civil engineering and project management
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.480]  firms in the world
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.480]  I'm not going to name it
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.480]  your listeners can either believe me or not
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.480]  because the research they did
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.480]  for me are studying
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.480]  all the films and everything else
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:03.480]  they did for me privately
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.480]  well you're a renowned journalist
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.480]  and award winning so that's standard
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.480]  for those that don't know to not reveal your sources
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:11.480]  you don't want to throw them overboard
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.480]  I mean they did this in confidence
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.480]  but continue
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.480]  so here we are, they are truly
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.480]  world leading consultants
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:21.480]  and they said to me
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.480]  when they studied the film footage
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.480]  and everything else
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.480]  was visible
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.480]  the building, the twin towers
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.480]  were brought down by controlled
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.480]  explosions from within
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.480]  now I know there are many other people
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.480]  that say that in America
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.480]  but as a journalist I can only go
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.480]  on people that I know
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.480]  and trust, right?
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.480]  so they send that to me
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.480]  so by definition Alex
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.480]  if the buildings were brought down
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:51.480]  by controlled explosions
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.480]  it is a conspiracy by absolute definition
