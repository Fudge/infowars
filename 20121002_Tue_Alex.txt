[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:30.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, he is another premier worldwide transmission.
[00:37.000 --> 00:44.000]  Thank you for joining us on this October 2nd, 2012, Tuesday, transmission.
[00:44.000 --> 00:53.000]  We are going to be live here blasting on the radio for the next three-hour simulcasting video at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:53.000 --> 00:59.000]  And when our guests join us via video Skype today and when we're showing documents and video clips, you can watch the video feed.
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.000]  But by tomorrow, we should be done with some of the construction in here.
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  And you'll be back to video of, well, my mug.
[01:08.000 --> 01:17.000]  And of course, the nightly news as well is video 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern in FullWarsNews.com or prisonplanet.tv.
[01:17.000 --> 01:25.000]  Reverend Leonard Childress of BlackGenocide.com will be joining us, breaking down how Planned Parenthood and all these other groups are on record.
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  Can we queue up to kill the ugly black baby clip that was there in a month ago?
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  And some of those other video clips, we can play that while he's on, where the abortionist, that's pretty much the default statement.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  But myself, you're not going to adopt these ugly black babies, are you?
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  I didn't know they were ugly, but according to them they are.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  So that's what it's really all about.
[01:45.000 --> 01:53.000]  Of course, Obama has helped massively expand abortion funding, where it's basically forced in Africa and in other countries.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  If you want the government funds, well, you got to get sterilized.
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  You got to kill that baby, because the earth is overpopulated.
[02:02.000 --> 02:10.000]  Whether you believe that or not, the point is we should have an honest debate about this and not let Planned Parenthood prance around and play the part of victims.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  They do that in Austin, Texas, where I live.
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  And it's one of the only, it's the only county in Texas where taxpayer money pays for abortions.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  So I moved out of the county.
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  My offices are still here, but I don't live inside Travis County anymore because of that.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  That was the final straw, but they're doing that nationwide.
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  And that's what the Obama healthcare is about paying for abortions.
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  France now pays for 100% of abortions, and they push it on people.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  So that's where this is all going.
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  And hey, don't worry, just because you don't get an abortion, eat some GMO that sterilizes the rats.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  You're going to have a lot of trouble having that baby.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  And then I love all the yuppies that support this.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  Hey, don't you get the fact that's why you can't have kids either?
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  You know, you play the part like you're an elitist, you genocist, globalist, but you're not.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  You are getting bombed by the GMO, the sodium fluoride and all the rest of it.
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.000]  You fools.
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  And then Daniel Simpson.
[03:04.000 --> 03:14.000]  We had, of course, the former CNN reporter on just a few days ago.
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.000]  Yeah, we had Amber Lyons on the show where foreign governments are funding CNN's news reports.
[03:20.000 --> 03:28.000]  They're told to cover up massacres by Bob Rain and others while making up massacres by the Syrians or exaggerating them.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  They're told to basically promote Al Qaeda as loving saviors.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  And she wouldn't do that.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.000]  So they tried to run around.
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  She basically left on her own recognizance, but big whistleblower there.
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.000]  Well, Daniel Simpson is another big whistleblower this time from the New York Times.
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  So that is going to be coming up and he's definitely being censored.
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  I don't know how far he'll go on air to tell you what's happening since he left the New York Times,
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  but I have the inside scoop.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  So that is in the third hour today.
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  That is all coming up.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  Now, we got the big debate tomorrow.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  They're practicing on their teleprompters right now.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  There won't be teleprompters there, but they're practicing off and on for the last week.
[04:12.000 --> 04:21.000]  So we're going to have Obama solid the last three days to read teleprompter responses to a battery of questions.
[04:21.000 --> 04:31.000]  So these will be pre-programmed answers getting their story straight when the two act like there's a bunch of differences between them.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  So we're going to be breaking that down as well.
[04:34.000 --> 04:41.000]  And obviously after the debate tomorrow, we'll be going over it all here on the radio Thursday as well in the aftermath of the greatest show on Earth.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  And it ain't P.T. Barnum.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  Suckers born every minute.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  Well, the suckers are boarded every second if the globalists have their way.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  And that's what they see these children and then their parents says,
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  Ha ha, die sucker.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  We're going to be right back to break down a plethora of news.
[05:00.000 --> 05:13.000]  Aaron Fullen here, as the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[05:20.000 --> 05:28.000]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[05:28.000 --> 05:35.000]  Today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  But here's some good news.
[05:37.000 --> 05:43.000]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  That's fermentationfactor.com.
[05:51.000 --> 06:00.000]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods, and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:06.000]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest half-year on record.
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.000]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[06:09.000 --> 06:14.000]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[06:14.000 --> 06:19.000]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[06:19.000 --> 06:27.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have to raise prices too.
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.000]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[06:33.000 --> 06:37.000]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming.
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.000]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[06:40.000 --> 06:47.000]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today, and because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[06:47.000 --> 06:53.000]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to e-foodsdirect.com forward slash alex.
[06:53.000 --> 07:00.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or e-foodsdirect.com forward slash alex. You can bet your life on e-foods direct.
[07:00.000 --> 07:05.000]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative, but not all silver is equal.
[07:05.000 --> 07:12.000]  SilverSol is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[07:16.000 --> 07:23.000]  SilverSol resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses, enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[07:23.000 --> 07:30.000]  SilverSol is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[07:30.000 --> 07:36.000]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is highly effective against viruses, bacteria's molds and yeasts.
[07:36.000 --> 07:42.000]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation, arm yourself with supernatural silver.
[07:42.000 --> 07:48.000]  SilverSol liquid and gel are perfect for on-the-go emergency preparedness and can provide protection at home, school, or work.
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.000]  Go to supernaturalsilver.com and be prepared for any emergency.
[07:52.000 --> 07:55.000]  Remember the promo code alex says for 20% off.

[07:59.000 --> 08:07.000]  Music
[08:07.000 --> 08:16.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:16.000 --> 08:24.000]  Music
[08:24.000 --> 08:33.000]  Yes, my friends, my fellow Liberty Lovers worldwide, thank you so much for joining us today.
[08:33.000 --> 08:47.000]  It is the second day of October 2012 and we will be here as we are weekdays, noon to three, eastern.
[08:47.000 --> 08:56.000]  Back Sundays, 4 to 6 with the radio, Monday through Friday, 7 o'clock central with InfoWars Nightly News, InfoWarsNews.com.
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.000]  Daniel Simpson, another whistleblower from inside the New York Times, will be joining us.
[09:02.000 --> 09:09.000]  We just had Ms. Lyon from CNN on a few days ago, what last Friday,
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  whistleblowing on CNN ordering her to cover up massacres, you name it.
[09:14.000 --> 09:20.000]  Well, Daniel Simpson's a big-time whistleblower from inside the New York Times.
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.000]  Wait till you hear about this.
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  It's coming out, CIA in there, the White House saying what can be published, what can't be.
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  No wonder they want to shut down the free web.
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  No wonder they hate the Drudge Report, DrudgeReport.com.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  No wonder they hate WorldNet Daily.
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  No wonder they hate InfoWars.com.
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  No wonder they hate PrisonPlanet.com.
[09:40.000 --> 09:47.000]  No wonder they hate things like Newsmax because they don't control us.
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  Nobody controls me, not even myself.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  When it gets down to it, I am so dedicated to telling it like it is and I'm in such a habit
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  of not shutting up and not backing down, even when I get death threats on my family.
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  It only makes me rampage 10 times more hardcore.
[10:05.000 --> 10:19.000]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you're hearing someone committed, someone turned over to the fight for liberty.
[10:19.000 --> 10:27.000]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we are live here on this Tuesday, Worldwide Transmission October 2nd.
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  Reverend Leonard Sheldris of blackgenocide.com is going to be joining us, getting into, well,
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  the admitted program to abort the babies in America, especially black people.
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  The heart of modern liberalism is absolute, well, precursor to the Nazis.
[10:43.000 --> 10:51.000]  I can't call them Nazis because they gave birth to the Nazis right out of the demonic loins of Margaret Sanger.
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  In fact, I forgot to do it. They're all over major university sites.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  Will you guys print me some of the letters of Margaret Sanger?
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  I want to read the exact quotes about we're going to hire blacks, we're going to pose as liberals,
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  and we're going to exterminate them.
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  And then the media's all, oh, you're so liberal, oh, it's so liberal.
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  Again, they hide their evil in plain view.
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  So that is coming up.
[11:17.000 --> 11:25.000]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, I tend to get really, really, really, really dark on air
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  because I'm envisioning and I'm focusing mentally and I image things.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  If I say Grand Canyon, I image the Grand Canyon.
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  If I say Marilyn Monroe, which I like to image, I image Marilyn Monroe in my mind.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  When that type of thing is happening, when I start imaging and wargaming in my mind,
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  the electrochemical computer God gave me, the supercomputer, and you've got one too.
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.000]  I suggest you use it. I then image their master plan and I just go into a rage,
[11:53.000 --> 12:02.000]  a fitting rage that I like into a raccoon caged that someone puts in a pond to drown.
[12:02.000 --> 12:09.000]  And you see it's fighting for its life up there, clawing at the metal bars.
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  And that's basically what you're hearing me do here on air.
[12:12.000 --> 12:20.000]  We are under absolute attack and I want to shake you out of your delirium, out of your trance
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  because if you're paying attention to even one-tenth of what's going on,
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  you would be wildly animated in resistance to this takeover
[12:30.000 --> 12:45.000]  because we are witnessing a global crime syndicate operation right now.
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we are live and broadcasting worldwide today
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  and we have those big guests coming up and I will try to take phone calls while both guests are on with us.
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  In fact, I'm going to take phone calls for first-time callers today on any issue, any item,
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  any topic you'd like to ask me a question about or any statements you have
[13:05.000 --> 13:13.000]  or any news points that you would like to raise, we would love to hear from you.
[13:13.000 --> 13:27.000]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  Okay, let me settle down just a little bit and tell you some of the news that's coming up today.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  The 5 million-volt cattle prod, to give you an idea, what is that,
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  about 10 times stronger or more than the most powerful taser?
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  But I was looking up those numbers this morning.
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  There's three different taser voltage models and it's well over 10 times the strongest.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  So I think Paul, to add that to his article,
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  let that Paul's already on fire, Paul Joseph Watson writing five, six articles a day,
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  all of them incredibly important in newsmaking.
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  There it is, a 5 million-volt cattle prod developed for crowd control.
[14:11.000 --> 14:19.000]  See video of it, it glows blue with the lightning of Thor and Odin and I guess Zoo Senate.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  And the taser keeps increasing the power.
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.000]  The more deaths from these systems, again, these are called less lethal in the real literature
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  and it's all part of a Ram Corporation plan, I don't know, came out like 20 years ago,
[14:33.000 --> 14:46.000]  to basically be able to be able to slowly increase the power
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  and then just get everybody acclimated to more and more deaths from rubber bullets,
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  more and more deaths from tasers, more and more deaths from falling and hitting your head.
[14:54.000 --> 15:02.000]  In fact, later in the next hour after Reverend Childress leaves us,
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.000]  I'm going to play some video and audio clips because I saw a new one today of the police
[15:07.000 --> 15:12.000]  beating for no reason a man in a wheelchair, I guess a quadriplegic,
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  and then stomping him once he's on the ground.
[15:15.000 --> 15:22.000]  And then I've seen all of these other countless videos of, you know,
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  the police dumping the quadriplegic out of the wheelchair and breaking their bones
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  because we've been paralyzed from the neck down or chest down for a long time.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  Your bones are like jello, basically.
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  They just break very, very easily.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  They're like chalk.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  And it broke a bunch of his bones and they said, get up.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  And the guy said, here's my card.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  I'm disabled. It's in my pocket.
[15:44.000 --> 15:49.000]  And they've got him there at the station about two, I guess, and they said, get up.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  And he could obviously tell the guy had no muscles, basically, in his body.
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.000]  You could tell, you know, that his arms and legs looked like they were the size of toothpicks, basically.
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.000]  And the cops just dump him out and he just shatters on the ground.
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  They didn't get in trouble, either. It was a celebration.
[16:03.000 --> 16:04.000]  It's like, get up.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  And you're like, I'm paralyzed from the chest down.
[16:06.000 --> 16:07.000]  I can't.
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.000]  Oh, really?
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  I'm going to throw you on the ground. You scum.
[16:11.000 --> 16:12.000]  And I see these videos all the time.
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  So I've got the guys trying to compile some.
[16:14.000 --> 16:23.000]  And again, the problem is, I don't know, Chris Alanis was in there telling me that he's finding dozens and dozens of these of just people in wheelchairs paralyzed.
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  And it's just like they're going to be their bones broken.
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  And I'm pro police. I think it's good.
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  I think they ought to line them up and shoot them all in the head and then dance around their blood.
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  I'm not put devil outfits on while they do it.
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  I'm being sarcastic.
[16:37.000 --> 16:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's just we're turning into a total joke as a society.
[16:43.000 --> 16:52.000]  And of course, three years ago, Homeland Security did have meetings and because it came out in the federal register and did propose.
[16:52.000 --> 17:00.000]  They set it up to the highest levels of Homeland Security, but Congress wouldn't approve it to have everyone wear taser bracelets when you fly.
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.000]  We've played the PR video for the company.
[17:03.000 --> 17:06.000]  And then that way everyone's wearing a taser bracelet.
[17:06.000 --> 17:12.000]  And so, you know, that way you can be trusted because you're guilty until proven enslaved.
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.000]  You're guilty until you die from the cancer virus as they inject you.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  So used to you were innocent until proven guilty.
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.000]  Then you were guilty until proven innocent.
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  Now you're guilty, guilty, guilty, scum, scum, scum.
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.000]  You're guilty, guilty, guilty, scum, scum, scum.
[17:25.000 --> 17:30.000]  So 800-25-99-231, I see the phones are loaded there.
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  We will take some when we come back from break.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  I'm shaking the show up.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  You know, have you noticed I have even more energy?
[17:36.000 --> 17:43.000]  It's because I realized it's like old fashioned radio, not having the studio fully put together and the lights taken down and things while they put in more soundproofing.
[17:43.000 --> 17:52.000]  And so we're not shooting video in here today of the full studio or streaming video, but not of what's going on in the studio of documents and clips and things at prisonplanet.tv.
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  And it's like old days.
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  I'm very intimate with the microphone.
[17:56.000 --> 17:57.000]  I'm right up on it right now.
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  I'm hunched over the microphone like I would do in the past.
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  And I'm telling you, I'm liking this.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  I'm liking this.
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.000]  I think we're going to go to one day a week.
[18:07.000 --> 18:12.000]  We'll have a video feed of the guest and everything, but one day a week I will not be on camera.
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  In fact, this is so enjoyable.
[18:14.000 --> 18:20.000]  I may just get rid of streaming full video of the daytime radio show because I'm loving this.
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  I mean, this is just awesome.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  I mean, this is, this is like a walk in the park.
[18:24.000 --> 18:30.000]  This is like a, this is like an Azure summer sky crystal clear and high.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  I mean, I am liking this like mountain air right now.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  I mean, boy, howdy is this good?
[18:35.000 --> 18:36.000]  Okay.
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  I got to stop.
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.000]  I got to stop.
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  I've got to stop.
[18:40.000 --> 18:48.000]  Like how 9,000 says just a moment, just a moment, just a moment.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  I'm afraid Dave.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  I'm afraid.
[18:54.000 --> 18:58.000]  If you haven't seen 2001 space Odyssey, I'm sorry, you're not going to get it.
[18:58.000 --> 18:59.000]  I'm sure many of you have.
[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  Most listeners are smarter than I am, but I do realize that we're down on over 120 AM and FM affiliates.
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.000]  A lot of them giant stations like in Chicago, 1530.
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  And there's a lot of new listeners tuning in.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  And let me just give you the message here.
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  I think that sheds it all right there.
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  And if you're wondering who I am, well, I'm a maniac.
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  I'm a crazy person because nowadays it's crazy to be aggressive.
[19:25.000 --> 19:38.000]  It's crazy to want freedom and it's crazy to be upset about 1.6 billion bullets bought and the government gearing up for martial law and admissions of preparations for total global meltdown.
[19:38.000 --> 19:45.000]  So when we get back, we'll give you a little bit of the economic news, the military news, the debates coming up.
[19:45.000 --> 19:57.000]  And then we'll also get into some of the reports here dealing with what is really going on with abortion in this country and who is behind that.
[19:57.000 --> 20:20.000]  And a lot more stay with us.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  Right now, as the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have to raise prices too.
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.000]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming.

[24:13.000 --> 24:18.000]  I said the joker to the thief. There's too much confusion.
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.000]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.000]  Said a joker to the thief.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  There's too much confusion.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  I can't get no relief.

[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  Come and smoke my herb.
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, transmitting worldwide.
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[24:52.000 --> 24:58.000]  I'm going to your phone calls here in a moment just to break the monotony of my ranting before I get to all the news.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  But let me give you a little news flash.
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  Ten years ago they started putting naked body scanners in select airports in Europe and the United States.
[25:05.000 --> 25:12.000]  And the cancer risk have come out even in the Boston Globe that at Boston Logan, massive increase, sevenfold increase in many cancers.
[25:12.000 --> 25:22.000]  And then the ensuing cover up just like with the deadly dust on 9-11 with the collapsing towers that the government knew was deadly and shed was healthy because they wanted to open everything back up.
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.000]  And then that later all came out.
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  But we were called conspiracy theorists reporting it out at the time.
[25:28.000 --> 25:35.000]  Well, now about a year ago Paul Watson reported on it, the Drudge Report link to it.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  It became a big news item.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  And then we reported on it a few months ago.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  But now it's being announced.
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  It's in several newspapers, RT's also covering it.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  It's up at prisonplanet.com.
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.000]  TSA to install molecular body scanners.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  You heard about the feds.
[25:51.000 --> 25:57.000]  They want to give them to police where they jerk you out of the car and a machine at you.
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  It has more false positives than anything you can imagine.
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  You know, they've proven a lie detector tester or fraud.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  They don't care.
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.000]  It's an excuse to say you're guilty.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  They're now going to walk everybody through.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  They're getting ready to put them in nationwide.
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  A scanner, a sniffer.
[26:12.000 --> 26:23.000]  They've already got some machines that sniff for radiation or the stuff associated with explosives that's got so many false positives it'll make your head spin.
[26:23.000 --> 26:31.000]  And now they're going to put these in and it's going to smell for thousands of things.
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  And guaranteed it's all about making you guilty.
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  And then they're going to drag you off the private screening rooms.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  They've said you won't have a choice.
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  We're going to take you in here.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  We're going to strip search it.
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  And folks, they're going to take your clothes off.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  They're already ripping colostomy bags off.
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  They're already probing into the cavities of women's bodies.
[26:50.000 --> 26:55.000]  Folks, you already get the beginnings of a proctology exam.
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  They already, remember Miss USA and Dallas crying?
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  They went in her pants, in her body.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  I hate to talk like that on air.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  I mean, that's what they did.
[27:03.000 --> 27:04.000]  She broke down crying.
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  She said they went in and she described, you know, scientifically the female opening and they did it.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  And they're going to do it to you and your family.
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  And they're going to do it at the side of a highway.
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  And let me tell you, you give them a problem.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  They're going to gun you and your family down.
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.000]  And they're going to rob your bags a million dollars a piece every year because like the, you know, people getting evicted.
[27:21.000 --> 27:22.000]  Say, hey, we all do it.
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  We all steal.
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  And all of us have been robbed by him.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  And this is the new sacrament of the brown shirts.
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  And they're going to say we're doing it to fight al-Qaeda, which the government publicly runs.
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  I'm going to break and come back.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  This is a short segment.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  Go to your calls.
[27:35.000 --> 27:36.000]  But this is a big deal.
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  TSA to install molecular body scanners.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  I'm going to get curtain.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  I'm going to do a full report on this kind of rehash Watson's because now it's out.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  TSA is introducing the new full body scanner system to American airports.
[27:48.000 --> 27:57.000]  The scanners will be capable of detecting every tiny trace of any substance on your body to find gunpowder or bomb making materials.
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  Or they say marijuana, whatever the case is.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  And it's just going to be false positives.
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  You know, I've gone through the airport before and the guy admitted he was a listener.
[28:07.000 --> 28:12.000]  He smiled when I was walking up in Vegas last year shooting Ventura's TV show.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  And when I walked through, there was a beep.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  And they go, oh, you've been chosen randomly.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  And I go, I just saw you push the button.
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  You got a button over there.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  Yeah, I lost in your show.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  Listen yesterday.
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  And he looked at me and he goes, he looked his lips and he goes, this is my administrative ride.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  Or you don't have to fly today, Mr. Jones.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  He didn't do that part, but spiritually he did.
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  And so there you go.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  There you go.
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  Now the scanner says you're guilty.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  It's this religion that we're guilty.
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.000]  We're not to be trusted with the Jumbotrons going in the Walmarts and in the public parks in Mall of America.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  Literally with Homeland Security announcing that someone leave a bag.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  Terrorists everywhere only trust Homeland Security.
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000]  The whole country's be like an airport with announcements of please do not leave bags.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  If you see one left, call authorities.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  This is a high security area.
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  That's what a free country sounds like now.
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  All the borders are wide open in the government.
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  Ships, tens of thousands of guns and hand grenades to Mexico.
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  And all they put the underwear bomber on the plane.
[29:18.000 --> 29:23.000]  And while they put al-Qaeda in charge of all these countries, they sit here like we're morons.
[29:23.000 --> 29:30.000]  Like we're idiots and say, oh, the TSA is now setting checkpoints up on highways and roads and bus stations everywhere.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  And you know what?
[29:31.000 --> 29:38.000]  They're now again, well, they're starting to set up armored pill boxes where they drag your wife and children off.
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  And they're going to rob you.
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  And they're going to rape you.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  And they're going to do whatever authoritarian companies ever done.
[29:44.000 --> 29:45.000]  And you're going to love it.
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  You're going to beg for it.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  Because you're land of the free, home of the brave.
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  We're on the march.

[29:53.000 --> 29:57.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.000]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for true speakers.

[31:00.000 --> 31:04.000]  Sick of the globalist, you Genesis control freaks adding poison to your water

[32:00.000 --> 32:01.000]  Aaron Fullen here.
[32:01.000 --> 32:06.000]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are losing access,
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses,
[32:08.000 --> 32:13.000]  but to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt and kefir.
[32:13.000 --> 32:17.000]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[32:17.000 --> 32:19.000]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[32:19.000 --> 32:22.000]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history,
[32:22.000 --> 32:27.000]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[32:27.000 --> 32:32.000]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi,
[32:32.000 --> 32:35.000]  and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[32:35.000 --> 32:36.000]  But here's some good news.
[32:36.000 --> 32:42.000]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.000]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[32:46.000 --> 32:49.000]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[32:49.000 --> 32:51.000]  That's fermentationfactor.com.
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.000]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods,
[32:53.000 --> 32:57.000]  and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[32:57.000 --> 33:20.000]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[33:28.000 --> 33:31.000]  The answer to tyranny is resistance.
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.000]  The answer to bullies is to fight back.
[33:36.000 --> 33:44.000]  The answer to a overwhelming bum rush of control freak activity is to redouble our efforts
[33:44.000 --> 33:49.000]  and get right out in their face and stop mincing words, stop being polite, stop being...
[33:49.000 --> 33:55.000]  They've taken American hospitality and turned it into a religion of bootlicking,
[33:55.000 --> 34:03.000]  where the government's the authorities, the officials, and we're the civilians in their military dictatorship.
[34:03.000 --> 34:08.000]  The good news is our military is waking up to what's happening, and so are the police.
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  Not to give credit where it's due.
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.000]  Every cop I run into or talk to, no matter where I am in the country, is awake and listening.
[34:14.000 --> 34:18.000]  We really are the number one radio show that the armed forces listen to.
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  That's got to freak the globalist out.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  Man, what a responsibility.
[34:22.000 --> 34:28.000]  What a realization that everybody I meet who's in the military, friends, family, neighbors,
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  medical doctors have been in the military, you name it.
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  They say, man, all people do is listen to your show.
[34:33.000 --> 34:40.000]  And then I think about the globalists who are really smart, but in ways cannot help but exercise raw power.
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.000]  The reason I'm number one in the military is, going back more than 15 years,
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  I would talk to Marines and others who would hand out films like America Destroyed by Design
[34:50.000 --> 34:56.000]  that just showed the UN taking over our national parks and public lands as collateral on the national debt
[34:56.000 --> 35:04.000]  to the IMF and World Bank and the XM Bank and OECD, Organization of Economic Cooperative Development.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  That was a pretty mild film.
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.000]  It's important, but nowadays it's pretty passé.
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  The banks will set up local government, they're going to bankrupt us.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  It's made 15, 16 years ago.
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  It's all come true, but unfortunately.
[35:16.000 --> 35:22.000]  I talked to multiple Marines and Army people who would show the film and then they'd have to run laps
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  or do extra duty or get in trouble.
[35:24.000 --> 35:28.000]  And then everybody would rebel and just make more copies and hand them out.
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  And then I would talk about it on air and all these other troops would call in talking about it.
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  And just since then, they call in officers and others and say,
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  I could open the phones up right now, the military would just fill the lines going, yeah,
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.000]  I was in 10 years ago, I was in five years ago, or I'm in right now and they told us don't listen to it.
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  But a lot of times at these briefings that even laugh and go,
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.000]  don't listen to this guy, I've been told to tell you this and then it's wink, wink.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  It's so ridiculous.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  Go in and tell people.
[35:57.000 --> 36:04.000]  It'd be like if I went in and told my children, because we've got a jar of candy up high in the pantry.
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  And it'd be like if I went in and said, hey, you know, I just filled that jar full of candy.
[36:08.000 --> 36:13.000]  Whatever you do, don't go get that step stool and climb up there and eat it when I'm out here mowing the lawn.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  What do you think my kids would do?
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  I mean, the psychology of that.
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  Do not listen to the Alex Jones radio show.
[36:21.000 --> 36:28.000]  When we're number one on the internet, according to Shotcast Alexa, Google Analytics, I don't know.
[36:28.000 --> 36:35.000]  There's like 600,000 people a day download our podcast and we don't even really promote it or put it out in the new fancy ways.
[36:35.000 --> 36:44.000]  What is it like 300,000 end up listening to our audio streams every day to the live show and the restreams at prisonblinded.com and infowars.com.
[36:44.000 --> 36:45.000]  I'm not bragging.
[36:45.000 --> 36:53.000]  I'm giving you the good news here, folks, that just on the internet streams we dominate and you watch the IP addresses.
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.000]  The military is just rebelling in mass even though they try to block it.
[36:58.000 --> 37:03.000]  The military is listening to us on duty all over the world right now.
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.000]  So I want to say hi to all of you as I did yesterday because the realization of this is just incredible.
[37:09.000 --> 37:17.000]  Every day I run into military who's gotten out or who are on leave who tell me that everyone they know is listening.
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  I mean, I'll be on a flight next to an MP and he'll go, oh, hey Alex Jones.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  Yeah, the guys all listen to you.
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  Yeah, they're told not to but they do.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  I mean, what do you think the system is going to do?
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  What can they do?
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  I've already said the basics.
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  If they kill me, it'll just make people listen that much more.
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.000]  See, that's the thing about evil, folks, and I'll go to your calls.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  Do you think it's invincible?
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  It tells you it's big and bad and powerful.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  It dresses in ways to intimidate you.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  The government likes big marble buildings to make you feel small.
[37:48.000 --> 37:55.000]  But when you call its bluff consistently and stand up against it, it will fold.
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.000]  It will fail when you've got right on your side.
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  There are more good people than there are bad people.
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  But you've got to stand up and say no to this system.
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  Now, we've got guests coming up, a big whistleblower, about an hour and a half.
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.000]  We've got a reverend who does a great job exposing Margaret Singer and Planned Parenthood
[38:13.000 --> 38:18.000]  and what they're up to and the agenda to exterminate the young of this country,
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.000]  especially blacks, that is coming up.
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  The media says it's racist to even say the name black,
[38:25.000 --> 38:28.000]  but it's okay to chop up black babies.
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  It's all about demonizing words.
[38:30.000 --> 38:37.000]  It's like when the Norman, almost a thousand years ago, took over England
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.000]  and they banned most of the English language and they called it dirty and low.
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  So it wasn't just so-called cuss words that got banned.
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.000]  It was so much more.
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.000]  And they've got the same thing going on today.
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down.
[38:53.000 --> 39:01.000]  But let me just give you a smattering here of some of what we've got up at prisonplanet.com
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  and fullworks.com.
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  Five million volt cattle prod developed for crowd control.
[39:05.000 --> 39:12.000]  Americans are waking up with the dangers of GMO foods, central bankers, inflate fiat currency
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  while plans for one world currency are finalized.
[39:15.000 --> 39:22.000]  The power game, how parasitic royalty consumes liberty.
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.000]  Frank and scientists announced mutant GMO cows to produce engineered milk for human babies.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  Yeah, that's already been going on for two years in China.
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  Russian general, the cows are part human folks.
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.000]  Their mammary glands are just like they can make a goat's mammaries produce spider web.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  That's about 20 years old.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  Yeah, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  Russian general, the USSR collapsed and the same fate has been prepared for the USA.
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  Yeah, by the bankers though.
[39:49.000 --> 39:55.000]  TSA, a collection of thieves and pedophiles to eat out our substance to quote the Declaration of Independence
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  known as the Declaration of Terrorism by the government.
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.000]  Banksters in White House, false flags, cyber attack victims right on time.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  And I've got a big stack of incredible economic news here.
[40:07.000 --> 40:12.000]  Economic warfare against Iran shows results as real drops.
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  Yeah, I want to just say this briefly, I'll get to it more later.
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  There's already a war going on for at least two years.
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  Probably longer against Iran, blowing up military bases, blowing up national police academies,
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  blowing up refineries, blowing up bridges, blowing up power plants,
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  assassinating people, shooting people, bombing people,
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  hand-grenading people, magnet mining people.
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  So they throw a magnet mine on the side of your car door and blow you up.
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  I mean, this is going on daily.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  They're using al-Qaeda jihadis.
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.000]  That's why the Iranians came out over a million the day after 9-11 in support of the U.S.
[40:47.000 --> 40:52.000]  because they hate Saudi Arabia and the Sunnis.
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  They're Shiites.
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  That's why when the news says Iran is al-Qaeda, folks, it is a joke.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  I'm not even saying Iran's good.
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  The point is, is that when the media is like, Iran was behind 9-11 now,
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.000]  yeah, and Easter bunnies might fly out of my nose or my ears.
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  I mean, they just prey on the ignorance of the public.
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  But their economy is just in absolute shambles imploding.
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  And they got stucks, net viruses.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  I mean, they don't have nuclear weapons.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  I don't agree with the propaganda we're seeing.
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  And the point is, when I saw Netanyahu last week, I saw newspaper headlines.
[41:27.000 --> 41:32.000]  I thought it was a joke photo of him with a ACME round bomb.
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  You know, the classic black bomb, you know, the bad guys throwing movies.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  The black round bomb with a lit fuse.
[41:38.000 --> 41:43.000]  I thought that's a joke about how he's fear monitoring because I'd heard and read the text of him saying, you know,
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  they're days away from, you know, nukes or whatever.
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  And then I found out it was real.
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  I thought that was a joke, like something out of Wiley Coyote.
[41:53.000 --> 42:01.000]  You've got to worry about bombs and war if they attack Iran.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  It's just incredible.
[42:03.000 --> 42:09.000]  And they're using five al-Qaeda groups listed as terrorists to attack inside Iran to overthrow Libya, to overthrow Syria.
[42:09.000 --> 42:15.000]  They go into family homes and say, we're going to kill your wife and children if you don't drive this truck bomb into the police station.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  And our news is like, well, that's really cool.
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  What a great thing to do.
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  I mean, this is sick.
[42:19.000 --> 42:26.000]  Simultaneously, I have a stack of news here where they're like, oh my gosh, well, here's the Washington Post.
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  White House secret meetings examine al-Qaeda threat in North Africa.
[42:30.000 --> 42:38.000]  And they're like, oh my gosh, we've got to invade all of Africa with Afrikan, because of al-Qaeda.
[42:38.000 --> 42:39.000]  And what did I tell you?
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.000]  Six months ago, a year ago, when all this was going on, I said they're going to invade all of Africa under the name of fighting al-Qaeda,
[42:45.000 --> 42:51.000]  that they have injected the bankers that run our government and our media.
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  I mean, it's so insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  The only people our troops are fighting in Afghanistan is not al-Qaeda and real Taliban.
[42:59.000 --> 43:06.000]  They're fighting warlords that don't want to only sell their drugs to U.S. and Western banks that run our military.
[43:06.000 --> 43:07.000]  And that's on record.
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  That's all a fight over 93% of world opium supply.
[43:11.000 --> 43:17.000]  It was 9% of world opium production pre-September 11, 2001, 10 and a half years ago.
[43:17.000 --> 43:18.000]  Or 11 years ago.
[43:18.000 --> 43:19.000]  Keep saying 10 and a half, 11.
[43:19.000 --> 43:20.000]  It's 11 years now.
[43:20.000 --> 43:21.000]  Wow, or more.
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  So all of this is going on.
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.000]  Because of geographic ignorance, because of cultural ignorance, because of economic ignorance,
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  because of spiritual ignorance, because of the incredible ignorance.
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  People are experts on sitcoms, experts on sports.
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.000]  Every time I'm sitting in a bar, picking up food to go to bring home every few weeks,
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  all the men do is talk about sports.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  And you can tell they're not even into it.
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.000]  And they try to impress each other with their knowledge of it.
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  And they'll start looking at me going, hey, sports, sports, hey, fan of fantasy football.
[43:53.000 --> 43:56.000]  And I go, no, I'm into currency wars.
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.000]  I'm sorry.
[43:57.000 --> 44:01.000]  I'm into cancer viruses and the vaccines.
[44:01.000 --> 44:06.000]  Yesterday, I pull into CVS to pick up some things.
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  There's no grocery store around my house in a rural area.
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  There's a CVS about five miles away.
[44:10.000 --> 44:11.000]  So I'm driving home.
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.000]  I pull into CVS and I think, I go, man, I hope one of the managers isn't on duty there
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  because they always, you know, they all know who I am as I've shot videos in there.
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.000]  And they'll hand back at me.
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.000]  So I go up to the thing and there's this nurse there with her grandson who looks addled
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  because he's had so many vaccines and there's vaccine ads everywhere.
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.000]  And I get up there and I hand the guy a 50 and I'm about about $25 worth of stuff again,
[44:32.000 --> 44:33.000]  just like Starbucks.
[44:33.000 --> 44:37.000]  And, and, and, and he's smiling and looking at me.
[44:37.000 --> 44:38.000]  He knows who I am.
[44:38.000 --> 44:44.000]  The guy's even said something before and he holds my 50th of the light and takes his time and checks it and looks.
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.000]  And I go, hey, hey, you know who I am.
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  And he goes, and he starts smiling at me.
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  And I go, B, are you implying that's a fake $15 bill?
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.000]  Because I know the corporations have been told to discourage cash now.
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.000]  And he goes, I'm a criminal justice major.
[45:02.000 --> 45:07.000]  Like I'm supposed to go, oh my gosh, well, man, you must have 190 IQ.
[45:07.000 --> 45:08.000]  You must walk on water.
[45:08.000 --> 45:09.000]  You must float around.
[45:09.000 --> 45:10.000]  You know, I'm a nobody.
[45:10.000 --> 45:15.000]  I mean, I just, you know, built a media empire out of nothing and have 50 plus crew members
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.000]  and, you know, reached 15 million people a week conservatively now.
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.000]  I mean, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I just talked to you.
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  You're letting me know soon you'll have a baton.
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  Beat me over the head on a dark road somewhere.
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  I mean, I mean, I didn't say that.
[45:27.000 --> 45:32.000]  And I went, oh, and the people are lining up behind me and I go, hey, you know, that is fake money.
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  And he went, but he knew it wasn't.
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  He looked at it again because, you know, it was a 50 with that kind of pink tinge to it.
[45:38.000 --> 45:39.000]  And I said, yeah, then I'm going to your calls.
[45:39.000 --> 45:43.000]  I said, I said, yeah, it's all Federal Reserve notes.
[45:43.000 --> 45:44.000]  It's 1913.
[45:44.000 --> 45:45.000]  It's all fake.
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  And I pull out money and I go, see everybody, Federal Reserve.
[45:47.000 --> 45:48.000]  I go, how many of you knew that?
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  And a few of them knew, a few of them didn't.
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  He was like, oh, okay.
[45:52.000 --> 45:53.000]  Well, here, here's your change.
[45:53.000 --> 45:54.000]  You can, you can go.
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  And I'm like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, we don't go now.
[45:57.000 --> 46:03.000]  You see, I'm not here to be impecked by you or you have your little authority dominance
[46:03.000 --> 46:04.000]  dance with me.
[46:04.000 --> 46:10.000]  And I said, be sure and take all your vaccines, everybody to the line now backing up behind
[46:10.000 --> 46:11.000]  me.
[46:11.000 --> 46:12.000]  Because there's one guy there.
[46:12.000 --> 46:18.000]  Be sure and take all your vaccines, everybody, because remember the government loves you.
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.000]  And he looked at me and smiled like, oh, you're right.
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  And then everybody else went, yeah.
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  And I was like, good evening.
[46:25.000 --> 46:34.000]  You don't impact me or you get stomped on verbally because I'm desperate.
[46:34.000 --> 46:35.000]  I'm trying to save humanity.
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.000]  I know they're killing us.
[46:36.000 --> 46:37.000]  I know they're attacking us.
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.000]  And I'm not taking any more corporate baloney from these managers that are out there like,
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  like, like, like bureaucrats or like TSA everywhere, everywhere.
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  Companies have told their people peck you.
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  I go in to get a rent car.
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.000]  They started asking me 20 questions.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  I go, hey, you just got my credit card.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  You know my whole rental history.
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  You know that's paid for by Time Warner.
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  I'm here for the Jesse Ventura TV show.
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.000]  You already knew that you're putting me in a database part of Patriot Act compliance.
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  And now I'm, you know, I'm there with like seven different rental car companies,
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  like a hundred people are listening to me.
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  And I just turn around and start speaking.
[47:12.000 --> 47:13.000]  And they go, sir, we'll give you a discount.
[47:13.000 --> 47:14.000]  Sir, okay, here's your stuff.
[47:14.000 --> 47:15.000]  You're like, that's right.
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  That's my stuff.
[47:17.000 --> 47:18.000]  You're right.
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  You don't want me to tell him you're spying on him.
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  You don't want to tell me you got a government database right there.
[47:23.000 --> 47:24.000]  You see, I'm free folks.
[47:24.000 --> 47:25.000]  I'm off the plantation.
[47:25.000 --> 47:26.000]  I'm a wild human.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  You understand that you're meant to be wild.
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.000]  You're meant to be strong.
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  You're meant to be red blooded.
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.000]  Oh, it feels good to suck air into my lungs because I won't be alive forever.
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  Oh, they hate this.
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  They hate it when you become alive.
[47:40.000 --> 47:41.000]  They hate it.
[47:41.000 --> 47:42.000]  They hate it.
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  They ain't not controlling you.
[47:43.000 --> 47:44.000]  They want you stunted and scared.
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.000]  They want to poison you because they're afraid of you.
[47:47.000 --> 47:48.000]  Let's go to the phone calls.
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  I'm gonna shut up now.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  Let's go to Gary in Illinois.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  Gary, you're on the air.
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  Welcome, sir.
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.000]  Yeah, you're just talking about people being ignorant that my dentist thinks I'm crazy
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  because I won't let her fluoride my kids.
[48:02.000 --> 48:08.000]  And people up to a four-way stop and people aren't even smart enough to know who goes first.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  No, no, it's because of television.
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  I see articles every day where people walk off canyons on their phone, walk into fountains,
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  walk into oncoming traffic.
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.000]  They're zombies.
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.000]  Their whole world is looking into a screen.
[48:21.000 --> 48:26.000]  And about your not having video, I used to listen on radio and really enjoyed it.
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  And then you start putting on news stream.
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  I hated their interruptions, you know.
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.000]  So I just signed up with your Prison Planet TV and I really enjoy it.
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  Enjoy watching you on there and seeing your document KMs and everything like that.
[48:41.000 --> 48:42.000]  Well, thank you.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  We will bring the TV back.
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  We're just finishing construction, better soundproofing and things.
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  It should be back tomorrow.
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.000]  I'm just saying I really enjoyed not, I mean, we are streaming video right now.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  We have documents and articles and we're going to have Gaspia Skype coming on at prisonplanet.tv.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  But yeah, no, I mean, it's very popular.
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.000]  We'll bring it back.
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.000]  It's just, it's exhausting being on camera and I can't like ignore it.
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  And maybe we could turn the screens off in here where, where I'm not always, you know,
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  there's screens in here with me on them.
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  And then it's, and I'm pretty good at not looking at myself, but it still distracts me.
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.000]  So maybe the answer is turn the screens off most of the time.
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  And then you guys just do whatever you want in there.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  Cause I end up like directing the TV show, you know, I'm constantly hitting the, you know,
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  the talk back deal and talking to the crew.
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.000]  Sir, what do you think about the fact that they're going to just increase the taser type systems 10 fold?
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.000]  Because again, and just get everybody used to more and more deaths from the high powered voltage.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  And it's just become a normal thing.
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  Oh yeah, that guy's dead.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  Do you see how they're upping the power of the soft kill weapons?
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  Yeah, yeah, I'm from Southern Illinois.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  So I've been on the farm around hog shockers.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  I know what they feel like and they don't feel good at all.
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  Yeah, well, I've been shocked by hot shots too.
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.000]  That barely even, you know, I've worked with cattle and things and sheep and you name it.
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  But they barely put off an arc.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  You can barely see the electricity off one of those and it hurts.
[50:05.000 --> 50:10.000]  Sir, this sends a large blue beam like lightning.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  Yeah, I'm an electrician.
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  I know all about all that stuff.
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.000]  It's going to probably kill people and everything else.
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  But it's just normal though.
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  That's not scary.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  People in uniforms charging around on power trips, killing people.
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  I mean, what's the big deal when there's cops everywhere throwing people out of wheelchairs and beating them
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  and people dying left and right and then it's no big deal.
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  What's the big deal?
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  Doesn't that make you feel safe and good?
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  Not me.
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  I'm far enough out in the country.
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.000]  I don't see that.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  I'm like two and a half hours from St. Louis.
[50:36.000 --> 50:39.000]  We still deer hunting and everything like that.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  Oh, that's evil.
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  That's an American.
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  Hey, what will five million volts do to somebody who's got heart problems?
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  It'll kill them.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  It only takes a sense to an amp.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  It's what I learned in school to stop your heart.
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  It goes across your heart.
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  Well, get ready for death.
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  We'll be right back.
[50:57.000 --> 51:26.000]  Stay with us, land of the free home of the brave.
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  Even today, Japanese eat miso.

[54:19.000 --> 54:24.000]  The places where you used to play.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  It wasn't inside your...
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.000]  By the will connected.
[54:30.000 --> 54:31.000]  We are back live.
[54:31.000 --> 54:32.000]  Taking your phone calls.
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  We're having children coming up in about 10-15 minutes.
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  Continue with your calls.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  Haven't even gotten into the economics back yet.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  It is unbelievable the takeover by the banks.
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  Engineering the world crisis while having the collaborator media cover up what they're doing for them.
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  Right now, let's go to David in South Dakota.
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  You're on the air.
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  Welcome.
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  Hi, how are you?
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  I'm a first-time caller and kind of a short-time listener.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  I've only been listening to you for about a month or so.
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  Well, thanks for putting up with me.
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  It's wonderful.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  You're just so informative.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  But what I called about...
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  Well, actually, there's a couple of things.
[55:08.000 --> 55:09.000]  The one is...
[55:09.000 --> 55:14.000]  I don't know if you've been looking at before it was news or before it's news.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  Anyway, there's a thing up here.
[55:16.000 --> 55:22.000]  It says the world leaders cancelling trips and meetings to the United States.
[55:22.000 --> 55:27.000]  And then it went down and scrolled into the audio of this.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  And it's really scary.
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  I mean, even Obama doesn't have anything scheduled from...
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  Well, he's got a meeting in Wisconsin on the 4th,
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  but all of his other meetings and everything has been cancelled.
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.000]  Well, you know why Obama is practicing for the debate?
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.000]  Well, that's what I heard, but I don't think so.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  I don't know.
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  It's just creepy.
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  Well, look, before it's news isn't bad. It posts a lot of our stuff,
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  but it posts so much. It's kind of an aggregator.
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  It also posts a lot of stuff that I don't think is very accurate.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  But we'll look into that.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  What's the headline? World leaders cancelling events?
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  I mean, we're constantly hearing the flying saucers are going to land next week.
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  The end of the world is in December.
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  The nuclear war starts now.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  We're in great danger.
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.000]  We are 7 billion people with a bunch of high-tech weapons on a tiny planet.
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  And if we have the type of wars we've had in the past, it's over for us.
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.000]  So we are, the species is in grave danger,
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.000]  mainly because the ruling class is so decadent and insane and imbred.
[56:27.000 --> 56:32.000]  But the constant, you know, naming the date of doom and all that,
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  it never pans out. It's like these preachers, you know, saying,
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  the world will end next week. And then, of course, it doesn't.
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  Then they use that to demonize all Christians.
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  But I appreciate your call. We'll look into that.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  Very interesting.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  People saying, where's Obama? Where's Obama?
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  Well, I mean, he's in Las Vegas getting ready for the teleprompter event.
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  He's got to practice on a teleprompter to every question he may be asked.
[56:54.000 --> 56:57.000]  And if you don't think those debates are rigged, think again.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  They know from the people what questions they're going to be asked.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  Now, let's talk to John in Illinois. John, you're on the air.
[57:04.000 --> 57:09.000]  Hi, Alex. I've compiled a list of 124 murders, mysterious deaths,
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  and disappearances that have happened since the Obama administration took power
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  that appear to have had political motivations.
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  You mean an Obama death list? I mean, a Clinton's run Obama.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  I mean, I wouldn't put it past him.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  What, people like Breitbart?
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  Yes, Breitbart's in there.
[57:24.000 --> 57:30.000]  Giffords, Fast and Furious, BP, political enemies during the 08 campaign.
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  And I've turned the list into an infographic that shows the faces of the victims
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  and it shows how their deaths are connected to various topics and political policy.
[57:36.000 --> 57:41.000]  I was hoping I could share the image with you and your viewers.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  Well, sir, can you send us your list?
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  Absolutely. You can give me an email address. It'll be great.
[57:47.000 --> 57:53.000]  Show tips at infowars.com and send it in the next 10 minutes and I'll look at it.
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  Very much.
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  Fantastic. Anything else, sir?
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  No, that's it. Thanks.
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  Thank you so much for that point.
[58:02.000 --> 58:05.000]  No, governments never kill anybody.
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  Governments never lie, cheat or steal.
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.000]  Governments are good. Governments make the grass grow.
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  They make rainbows in the sky. They make the birds tweet.
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.000]  Government built it. Government did it.
[58:21.000 --> 58:26.000]  Government is good. People are bad. People are suspects. Government is above the law.
[58:26.000 --> 58:30.000]  Don't trust average people. Only trust government.
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.000]  The general public are all suspects and well-civilian scum.
[58:34.000 --> 58:39.000]  Government are officials, authorities. They have the power. They are our gods.
[58:39.000 --> 59:01.000]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:39.000 --> 59:47.000]  Get on the web at 5starsope.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  There have been some big developments on the TSA front that I never properly got to yesterday and new developments today.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  It will be covering in about 45 minutes after our next guest leaves us.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  One of our stories, it's very important, is post it on the right-hand side of dredgereport.com.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  It's also on infowars.com and prisonplotter.com, obviously.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  We're going to be tying that into TSA to install molecular body scanners.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  Now the cops will pull you over and say, well, the scanner says you've got drugs. You're going to jail.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  So now you'll go through and they'll say, oh, the scanner says you have explosives or marijuana. You're going to prison.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  Because they've got to pack the prisons owned by the big banks that launder the drug money and kidnap your kids and sell them to Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  I mean, it's good people we're talking about here.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joseph in mass. Joseph, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  Hey, Alex. I'm glad that you're on the air.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  I got a couple stories to tell you one and I got a question for you about the hospital and explain to us about that laser thing, because I can't see.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  We had someone that was in the hospital. We never met him. We used to talk to him.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  They have the ride service up here for people like me and some of us are in wheelchairs, some of us are blind.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  They took his name off the visiting list. They wouldn't even let us go see him.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  He has no family. I guess one or two people. But when my friend died in intensive care, I went in and stayed with her.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  I mean, what is wrong with these hospitals? They're not our parents.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  You're saying the hospitals won't let you visit your friends now?
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  Well, that's what it sounds like.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  Hospitals in most countries are the most oppressive prisons where they force drug, where they take political dissidents and where they basically kill people.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  And for 20 years, 25 years or so, they don't give the Hippocratic oath anymore.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  A lot of medical doctors are little petty power tripping technicians now.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  There's still a lot of good doctors, but a lot of them are now taught bioethics of death.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  Most universities now teach it's good to kill blind people. It's good to kill people of any type of handicap.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  And, you know, all over the country, I've had a Wall Street Journal writer, what Wesley Smith on many times authored.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  I want to get him back on, by the way, listing the hundreds of names of handicapped folks who are paralyzed when the government becomes their guardian.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  People that can fully talk, totally healthy, want to live. The government murders them by dehydration.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  And they use a Terry Shiva, who they could argue was brain dead when she wasn't, to set the precedent.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  Well, she's brain dead. No, no, they kill people who are talking, begging for water.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  And they don't probably want you seeing that.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  And every time I've talked about this, I could open the phones up with nurses who aren't killers.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  They'll say, oh yeah, they're killing people right now at our hospital or right now at our nursing home.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  And they strap you down and they murder you.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  And I mean, my dad told me when I was 16 or 15, he said, don't sign the organ donor card.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  And I said, why? And he goes, well, I know a lot of doctors because my dad's a dentist and an oral surgeon.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  He would rewire jaws and hospitals in Dallas.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  And he said, well, the word is they kill you sometimes to get your organs here in Dallas.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  I said, well, what's your proof? And he said, well, I've just been told.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  And then years later, it came out in Chicago and Dallas and other areas.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  People that weren't even hurt that bad, they'd basically let you die or kill you to get your organs if you were an organ donor.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  Because they can get like a half mil for those.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  And so that's how it is.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  And now they're talking about making you be on the organ donor list, you understand?
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  It's all about money and what better place to kill you.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  I'm here in Austin, they've been caught stealing organs and they've been caught.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  Just type it into Google or startpage.com and stealing people's corneas.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  Even if you're not on the organ donor list, they still steal the goods.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  How does that sound? Does that sound nice?
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  No, it doesn't. But I wanted to ask you, I mean, I had a friend who was dying and they let me see her.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  But this was another hospital. Apparently they handle it right.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  But they're just going crazy over here at hospital.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  I mean, you don't treat people that way. They don't have a right to...
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  Well, here at death camp you do. What's the name of the death camp?
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  It was a Massachusetts general hospital.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  Well, the big general hospitals are government funded and government run generally.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  So that's where you're going to be. You're going to find the worst bugs in those too.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  The flesh eating, goods, all the other fun things in the death camp.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  But hey, I just try to stay out of the death camps as much as I can.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  I'm sorry to hear that you can't see your friend.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  But hey, what do you think this is? America? Free country?
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  I just take extra shots, everybody. Drink fluoride and eat GMO.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  Because remember, the government loves you. They love you. They want to help you.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  But not all silver is equal.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  Silver Soul is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  Silver Soul resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  to kill bacteria and viruses, enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  Silver Soul is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  It can be used internally as well as topically
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  and is highly effective against viruses, bacteria, molds, and yeasts.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation,
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  arm yourself with Supernatural Silver.

[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  A prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at Infowars.com.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  The items that I did research on, that I personally use,
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  you've got the life straw so you can turn fetted water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  The K-Tor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  Strategic relocation third edition by Joel Scousum.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  When disaster strikes by Matthew Stein,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  they're a safe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  Hand crank shortwave AMFM radios.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfowarsShop.com
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  and your purchase makes our Infowars possible.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  We're getting prepared. Are you InfowarsShop.com?
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  Just the other day, I saw another mainstream news article praising Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  And I knew that Margaret Sanger...
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  I could tell that Margaret Sanger from knowing history has been promoted as this wonderful, wonderful savior.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  And that the general public has no idea that Margaret Sanger was the inspiration for Adolf Hitler
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  and was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation that funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute on record.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  Just look this up. It's its mainline history that created the Nazi race science.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  So that stuff started in England, grew in the US.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  Thirty-four states up until the 1940s had forced sterilization laws targeting poor blacks, whites, Hispanics, you name it.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  We're going to be talking to Reverend Childress here in just a moment of blackgenocide.com.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  I'm really an expert on this, but I've dug out some of the famous quotes of Margaret Sanger about killing the black weeds.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  Because I thought I'd tie this into Obama taking the freeze off abortion funds for the third world and then increasing it.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  What it had been before the freeze and selling it like it's a civil rights movement.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  Because this video got attention a few months ago, really just a few weeks ago.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  Pro-life campaigners post video of abortion doctor saying his work helps get rid of ugly black babies.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  So I thought I'd break down what's really behind all this and what's behind the welfare and dependency and people wanting their Obama phone.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  None of this is to empower anybody. It is to fully take over society.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  Now, I tend to not look at the call list and who's on the board and this person's been holding about 10 minutes.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  So I apologize for that, but I thought I'd bring them up real quick because we always welcome station managers on the show.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  Matt's calling from Illinois, one of our latest, newest affiliates, general manager of WCKG 1530 AM.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  And he joins us from Chicago. Matt, good to have you calling in.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  In fact, I'd love to have you on as a guest sometime if you'd gone to the network.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  But thank you for calling into the show, sir. Glad you got in.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  Hey, Alex. Welcome to Chicago. If I cut out, I'm on my Obama phone, so you may lose the signal.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  I wanted to welcome you because, and I love that you're talking about the TSA, among other things.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  You've got O'Hare International Airport surrounded right now.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  So, you know, we're glad to have you on. This is a show that is, as you know, like no other.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  Up until last week, we had Michael Savage on also.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  And I thought that you all would complement each other well with man cow and we had a really nice lineup.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  It's a weird time for radio. And if there's other managers and radio folks out there listening,
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  you know, I think there's a really great solution in your vacancy for Savage with with the Alex Jones show.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  So that's what we're doing with it. And we're excited as all heck about it. And welcome to the Windy City, man.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  Well, thank you, sir. And hopefully I'll get up to Chicago sometime.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  I was up there in 2006 for a giant con conference with thousands of people.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  So hopefully I can get up there in the near future and I'm excited to be on your fine station, sir.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  Well, you know, it's really great to have something that's completely unique and we're really excited about it.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  And, you know, I know your listeners know this because they support you.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  But what's really important is that we get all of the info warriors out there in the Midwest surrounding the airport,
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  surrounding Chicagoland to get behind the show.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  And there's been a couple of key sponsors that have helped. And you know how it goes.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  When you have sponsors and listeners supporting this, that's how you can get good information out there.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  And so we're looking on building that and we're really excited to have you.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  So I'll let you get back to it. Thanks for being on with us and welcome to Chicago.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  And we're looking forward to having you on for a long time.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  Well, Matt, it's very exciting as you cover all of the Big Windy City.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  How many millions of people are in your listening area?
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  There's at least 3 million under the population, under the single coverage of 1530 here at WCKG.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  And you know, we're the little guy.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  Chicago is this huge area and we cover where the airport is and where the people are.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  And we're really excited to have you on talking to the regular folks because I'll tell you what, if it isn't you,
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  it's just the same old, same old stuff, the same guys that are on the news TV shows, doing the radio shows.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  And it's the same stuff over and over again.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  You're not going to hear about the order for bullets, you know, from the National Weather Service.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  Surprisingly, Alex, I didn't get coverage here in Chicago.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  Well, all I can say is without our AM and FM affiliates, we would not be reaching one-tenth of the people that we are now.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  And I don't like to gain off of somebody's failure.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  I happen to know the entire backstory on Michael Weiner, a.k.a. Michael Savage.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  And because I agree with him on a lot of issues and some other points, it just seems I've been falsely attacked and lied about so much
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  that I've almost got a compulsion now to not attack people in media, especially in talk radio,
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  just because it just looks like infighting or jealousy.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  The stuff I know about Savage is just off the charts wild, but from people directly inside talk radio network,
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  not one, not two, not three, not four, but like five people that actually dealt with Savage every day.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  It actually makes seem more interesting, knowing what a maniac he is.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  But we've actually had more than 30 stations call just since Savage left talk radio network last week.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  And it looks like we're going to gain like 20, 30 more affiliates immediately.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  I know they're going to put a full-page ad in Talkers Magazine promoting the show.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  But I almost hate to gain by their loss.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  It just doesn't feel good that way.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  I like to get such high ratings that stations just replace other shows.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  With mine, we beat and rush Limbaugh in many cities like Orlando.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  But no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  And it's so important for listeners to support local AM and FM sponsors.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  Call the sponsors, thank them.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  If you are a business owner, sponsor the station, the show.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  Even if you don't totally agree with myself, the fact that we're getting people to think is bold and needs to be done.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  And old talk radio is kind of going the way of the dodo bird.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  It's time for the next generation and I'm teleprompter free.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  I'm talking point free.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  This is real radio and we've dominated the web.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  Now we're starting to dominate talk radio itself and it's very, very exciting.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  But it's also very important.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  If you're listening to us in Dallas, Texas, or you're listening to us in Rochester, New York, or Los Angeles, or Chicago,
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  or if you're listening to us in Minneapolis, St. Paul, or all the great stations we've got,
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  tell people at Red Lights about the show.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  Tell people about the stations.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  Tell people at church.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  Tell people to tune in because if we can all just wake up one more person, we're that much closer to victory.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  I mean, I've got 15 million listeners one way or another a week.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  That's pretty much double what it was two years ago.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  We're growing exponentially.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  We can turn back the tide of the tyrants.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  So, Matt, very exciting, 15, 30 there in Chicago.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  Everybody spread the word and God bless you, Matt.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  You take care of Alex.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  God bless you and thanks for doing what you're doing.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  It's great to have you on here and keep up the good work.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  You bet.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  Yeah, so many station managers are trying to get a hold of me and I need to be able to talk to them all.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  I need to block out a few hours a week just to talk to these men and women, mainly men.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  But John Harmon up there at the network who's in affiliate relations,
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  give these general managers my cell phone number,
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  and then at least they can text me or call me and then I can just try to get a hold of them when I'm driving or something.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  That's about the only time I've gotten the day is when I drive to work and drive back or do errands
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  and I can take care of business while I'm driving.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  Okay, enough of that.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  Let's get to the big kahuna here.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  You know, I think all babies are really cute.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  I love my children.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  I want to have more children.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  I'm envious of people around the office when they have children.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  And I got to tell you, I've seen white babies, Hispanic babies, Asian babies, black babies.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  I think they're all super cute.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  But I got to tell you, black babies are really cute.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  They're all cute.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  But, you know, protesting an abortion clinic back when I had time to do this, 16, 17 years ago.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  I know I've produced anti-abortion shows.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  I've done it all, folks.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  That's one of the reasons I got started was pro-gun, pro-life.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  You know, I'm pro-defense.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  I'm pro-life.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  So I'm pro-gun.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  To defend our right to not be run over and running into people on the so-called left
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  at access TV and in talk stations and city people and city quote officials, authorities,
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  formerly public servants, I learned that they have a statement they make.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  And I would imagine Reverend Leonard Childress can second this.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  We're about to go to break.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  We're going to go to him.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  That what they always say is when you're protesting, they'll walk up and they'll look at you.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  The Planned Parenthood people will do this when you're camera in.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  And then they'll go, are you going to adopt these black babies?
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  And the first 20 times you hear it, you're like, what are they talking about?
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  You know, these are liberals.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  I thought liberals aren't racist.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  And then you figure out, folks, the real racist poses liberals.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  As Margaret Sanger said, we're going to pose as liberals.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  We're going to hire black leaders with doctorates.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  And we're going to kill these people.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  And I laugh in an evil laugh, folks, because they're laughing at you.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  And we have more and more video clips where you can call up Planned Parenthood and go,
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  I just want to get money to kill blacks.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  Oh, yes, we know.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  Oh, yes.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  You know, those recordings, we've played them.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  And hey, hey, hey, how dare you want to adopt these babies?
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  They're ugly black babies.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  Reverend Childress, I would imagine because you're pro-life and in the middle of this,
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  I've never asked you this.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  You're on the spot.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  Have you before heard this thing where they, it's like a standard go-to number one thing
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  in their playbook, I guess like the rush or something in football where they say, you
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  don't want, who wants the black babies?
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  I mean, what is it with this black baby thing?
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  Well, you know, that's basically somewhat systemic, especially.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  And as you surprisingly have pointed out, that the Democratic Party is unquestionably
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  and liberal people are unquestionably as racist as any southern or any other part of our
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  sector of our community.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  And I have right on my website, blackgenocide.org, an abortionist not ashamed to say it right
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  out in the public why he, one of the reasons why he's doing abortions, as you know, is
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  becoming increasingly more difficult for the abortion industry to find people who want
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  to do abortions.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  And so it appears that the ones that they're having now are just cold, sure enough, down
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  outright racist and didn't mind sprouting that message.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  Stay there.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  And by the way, I've been giving the website out wrong.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  Even though I've interviewed you probably 10 times, it's blackgenocide.org.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  Who knows where I'm sending you to come?
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  Blackgenocide.org.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  Stay there, sir.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  We're going to come right back to you to break all that down.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  Yeah.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  It's all of you that love abortion.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  You love murdering black people.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000]  You're so liberal.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  Aaron Fullen here.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000]  for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  culture.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porches, Koreans eat kimchi, and
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  But here's some good news.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  South for Lion Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  foods legally and privately in their own homes, since it's still legal to make these foods
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  as long as you can make them yourself.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  That's fermentationfactor.com.

[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  This is fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  humus for crops or gardens, with no turning and no obnoxious odors.

[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  IRAs?
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  of gold for your retirement.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  What the system does is they force blacks and others on to welfare, destroy their families.

[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:05.000]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:08.000]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:14.000]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:17.000]  at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:23.000]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:30.000]  Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally-occurring compounds
[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:35.000]  that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:39.000]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:42.000]  to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:05.000]  What do you do when your propane runs out and you don't have a large amount of wood for cooking?
[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  That's when you need a Grover Rocket Stove from stockstorage.com.

[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:32.000]  Don't want no shackles. Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:38.000]  I sit down with big brother. Don't like those RFIDs.
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  I don't want a chip in my family.
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:48.000]  Got the blues about my freedom. Got the blues about tyranny.
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:56.000]  I sit down with big brother. I got the blues about my freedom. Got the blues about tyranny.
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:00.000]  That's Jimmy Vaughn, my good buddy, great guy.
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:07.000]  I sit down with big brother. And the national ID.
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:14.000]  Alright folks, we have covered a lot today so far. Don't want a chip in my wallet. Chip in my car.
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  Crank this up. Yeah, all the big insurance companies are coming out and saying we'll give you a big discount if you put a satellite tracker in your car.
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:32.000]  Soon it'll be mandatory. Right here in Austin where I live, they've got a test program where the government pays you to put a box in your car to then pay by the mile.
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  They're privin' all the pumps. They're all goes to foreign banks.
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:42.000]  Don't want a chip in my mother. Chip in my wife.
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:52.000]  To destroy this republic. That's right, we want to be able to go to a store and buy normal produce, normal meat.
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  But you're like, no, you can't have that. I sit down with big brother. No more slavery.
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  No more slavery, that's right.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  It is that simple and I have had enough.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:14.000]  You know, it's taken me two days to get to this and I haven't gotten to it.
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  I want to thank DrudgeReport.com for linking to it last night until this morning.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  I'm going to get them to repost this as the top story on infowars.com right now because everybody needs to get this.
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:30.000]  TSA confiscates camera and deletes footage of checkpoint. That's one article.
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:35.000]  TSA rescinds approval to film in response to opt-out campaign.
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:42.000]  By law, you can film in these quasi-public areas. There are servants. It's not terrorism to film.
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  And I have a declaration at the bottom that I have not yet read entirely on air and it's very, very important.
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:54.000]  And so I am going to, I guess, read this on the Nightly News tonight.
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:57:02.000]  Jakari Jackson is doing the main part of the news. Aaron Dyches is going to be having a special report on Monsanto and the takeover of Whole Foods.
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:06.000]  All of that's going to be happening. We're in a fight for our lives, folks.
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:10.000]  If they can force us to eat this GMO, it is over.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:20.000]  I mean, there are hundreds and hundreds of studies where every major GMO crop sterilizes, deforms, mutates, kills, mammals it's fed to.
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  And look, there could be GMO that didn't do this. It's designed that way, ladies and gentlemen. It's eugenics.
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  I mean, I've had so many scientists on there, like, hey, this potato sterilizing the rats, they go, of course, that is the plan.
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  That was a Russian scientist I had on. I mean, it's all these companies.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:42.000]  Look at who founded modern science. They were eugenicists and the same big families that believed in it.
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:46.000]  Hitler was only one little spin-off of these people.
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:58.000]  And we're under attack, folks. I mean, we're leading the world in cancer, neurological disorders, everything else.
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:10.000]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, we are under incredible, incredible, tyranny in this country.
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:15.000]  And it's going to get a lot worse. Look at what's happened in other countries and other parts of history.
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:18.000]  And we know that's where the globalists are taking us right now.
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  So it's up to all of you out there to count the costs and decide are you going to go quietly with this or are you going to make a noise and say no.
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:31.000]  They think they can just incrementally twist your arm and condition you to accept all this and that you're going to fail.
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  And then I'm going to fail. But I know we're made a better stuff than that.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:47.000]  So let's get organized, let's get focused, and let's just start speaking out. Many hands make light work.
