[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.300]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.300 --> 00:40.360]  Texas Alex Jones well here we are my friends the seventh day already of
[00:40.360 --> 00:50.020]  April 2014 we're going to be live here for the next three hours and we have
[00:50.020 --> 00:54.040]  several guests joining us to break down some very important issues I'll tell
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.980]  about those guests coming up to the next segment there's a lot of confusion out
[00:58.980 --> 01:02.940]  there and that's the name of the game that was the plan about exactly what
[01:02.940 --> 01:09.580]  the Republicans are doing with Obama to quote fix Obamacare well you fix it by
[01:09.580 --> 01:14.860]  getting rid of the tar baby fraud that is designed to be basically a
[01:14.860 --> 01:19.600]  dictatorial edict to allow the federal government and the private banks that
[01:19.600 --> 01:24.240]  own it and run it to get their hands into anything and everything they want
[01:24.240 --> 01:34.040]  as an open mandate or get mission creep this is far beyond that and that's how
[01:34.040 --> 01:38.240]  they wrote the bill was to be a nation-wrecking machine that gives them
[01:38.240 --> 01:44.000]  unlimited power to take tax money from citizens via levies that's what it is a
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  letter of mark piracy and transfer it to the globalist the same people that
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.760]  own the Federal Reserve that's about as federal as federal express or federal
[01:52.760 --> 01:58.880]  plumbering and then once everything's getting screwed up they say oh my gosh
[01:58.880 --> 02:05.840]  let Obama operate as a dictator and then we'll go to him and secure things from
[02:05.840 --> 02:10.520]  him to fix it and Boehner the Speaker of the House is running around saying we
[02:10.520 --> 02:15.480]  didn't expand Obamacare as people that are researching it have documented with
[02:15.480 --> 02:21.200]  this new agreement with Nero I mean Hitler I mean dear leader Kim Jong
[02:21.200 --> 02:29.600]  Il the second we didn't expand it why we got him to fix it team Boehner to
[02:29.600 --> 02:36.720]  drudge we didn't expand Obamacare we repealed a piece and so that's how this
[02:36.720 --> 02:42.240]  is being spun as they openly set the precedents that print me that article
[02:42.240 --> 02:46.520]  guys thank you as they openly set the precedent to just do whatever they want
[02:46.520 --> 02:50.320]  which is what the heads of the committees want they want to be little
[02:50.320 --> 02:57.760]  dictators or ringwraiths under Sauron that is Obama and they want that
[02:57.760 --> 03:03.840]  precedent set now where they pass monstrosity legislation and then as it
[03:03.840 --> 03:07.960]  dawns on the public that it's a giant screw job the answer is well we'll
[03:07.960 --> 03:11.360]  selectively enforce this will selectively enforce that which is the
[03:11.360 --> 03:16.360]  essence of a tyranny because the whole thing is illegitimate and a fraud
[03:16.360 --> 03:20.440]  because it's discriminatory because it's not equally apportioned it's not
[03:20.440 --> 03:27.000]  equally applied I don't care what the blackmailed Supreme Court had to say
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.480]  about well the government has a power to tax not an unlimited power and so we're
[03:32.480 --> 03:39.240]  allowed to make you buy this from these companies but it's it's unconstitutional
[03:39.240 --> 03:45.680]  it is liquid 200 proof tyranny on every front every angle it is the mother load
[03:45.680 --> 03:50.720]  of fraud written by lawyers as a system just like they want to put poison in the
[03:50.720 --> 03:54.720]  food and water to make you six you never get out of the medical system I'm saying
[03:54.720 --> 03:58.840]  the doctors are bad it's just on record that this is done to create another
[03:58.840 --> 04:05.280]  system of dependency it's slavery Obamacare is written to take everything
[04:05.280 --> 04:10.680]  over in the process of imploding the country and consolidating it and making
[04:10.680 --> 04:15.640]  the insiders exempt and I know I just keep harping on that but I told you he
[04:15.640 --> 04:20.360]  would become a dictator to quote fix certain parts of it I told you that the
[04:20.360 --> 04:25.840]  website wouldn't work because I know all their tricks folks it's meant to create
[04:25.840 --> 04:29.880]  a process of boy isn't that screwed up well they're working on fixing it you
[04:29.880 --> 04:32.600]  know the Republicans would just get out of the way it would work if the
[04:32.600 --> 04:35.760]  Democrats would just back off at work when they're all in the same team at the
[04:35.760 --> 04:45.240]  top and we have to recognize the criminal program and get outside of the
[04:45.240 --> 04:50.080]  fake debate to realize what this system is and we're gonna beat it that's coming
[04:50.080 --> 04:55.320]  up and a lot more wait to hear what Jeb Bush said about immigration stay with

[07:05.000 --> 07:10.040]  entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model
[07:10.040 --> 07:15.280]  is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the
[07:15.280 --> 07:18.600]  global takeover that's why we've assembled the most vital and important

[08:23.840 --> 08:28.360]  resistance it's Alex Jones
[08:35.080 --> 08:43.040]  well Mickey Rooney dead at 93 Rob Lowe's come out in the New York Times and said
[08:43.040 --> 08:47.840]  I want the government out of almost everything that is the sentiment across
[08:47.840 --> 08:52.520]  the world libertarianism is rising at least people identifying as libertarians
[08:52.520 --> 08:56.560]  globally now as a majority in most countries according to the Financial
[08:56.560 --> 09:01.360]  Times of London but do people actually make those choices then in their lives
[09:01.360 --> 09:04.880]  what other people have freedom even if you disagree with what they're doing
[09:04.880 --> 09:09.360]  that's really what it's going to take to be free and all of us are hypocrites to
[09:09.360 --> 09:12.720]  one extent or another again now ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us
[09:12.720 --> 09:20.960]  on this Monday the 7th day of April 2014 Max Kaiser is going to be popping in
[09:20.960 --> 09:27.000]  for 30 minutes as he did last week for two hours dealing with the breaking
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.960]  intel from an insider who witnessed it of insider trading on 9-11 that
[09:31.960 --> 09:35.800]  interviewed is now aired on RT we're gonna air excerpts of it and have Max
[09:35.800 --> 09:41.160]  Kaiser popping in at the start of the next hour then we will continue with
[09:41.160 --> 09:46.960]  your phone calls then Dr. John Lybert is going to be coming on for 30 minutes to
[09:46.960 --> 09:51.400]  give us his breakdown on what's happening at the VA and why we're seeing a
[09:51.400 --> 09:58.000]  massive increase record increase in mass suicides in the military and he of
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.080]  course serve as a flight surgeon Vietnam and chief resident in psychiatry at
[10:03.080 --> 10:08.760]  Seattle VA hospital and he's done a lot more than just that since then he's
[10:08.760 --> 10:12.400]  going to be joining us wounded minds understanding and solving the growing
[10:12.400 --> 10:18.240]  menace of post-traumatic stress disorder this is a big deal you know I meant to
[10:18.240 --> 10:22.960]  shoot a video of it this weekend but with my children at the beach spending
[10:22.960 --> 10:27.000]  some time with them I just didn't get around to it but we should probably send
[10:27.000 --> 10:33.600]  one of the reporter crews out to show all the flags at half-mast over four
[10:33.600 --> 10:38.400]  dead people including the shooter at Fort Hood and you know they seem to lower
[10:38.400 --> 10:43.720]  flags now anytime the media reports on a dead soldier but when you get 22
[10:43.720 --> 10:49.520]  soldiers committing suicide a day and growing and being used like toilet paper
[10:49.520 --> 10:54.280]  in five six seven eight nine ten or more tours which is like putting five
[10:54.280 --> 10:59.600]  million miles on a pair of tires they will blow out in 90 plus percent of the
[10:59.600 --> 11:03.240]  public I mean they are just shredding these people and they say oh well they
[11:03.240 --> 11:07.640]  volunteered actually it's a scam in most cases where there's an automatic
[11:07.640 --> 11:13.040]  re-up and they force them back in an automatic re-up but the issue is that
[11:13.040 --> 11:17.040]  they can't get jobs once they get out in most cases because the economy and the
[11:17.040 --> 11:24.680]  rest of it and a stigma against veterans and so they're basically slaves so this
[11:24.680 --> 11:30.040]  is the type of garbage that we're facing and there's a video up on info wars.com
[11:30.040 --> 11:37.160]  that is very very important titled secret of military suicides exposed and
[11:37.160 --> 11:42.000]  it's the video slash audio report that I shot Friday that aired on the Sunday
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.200]  radio show and David Knight sat in for me and it's a very very important eight
[11:47.200 --> 11:51.680]  minute video that boils everything down so people can understand the reason
[11:51.680 --> 11:55.480]  they're committing suicide has been solved you make them serve too many
[11:55.480 --> 11:59.280]  tours in a questionable war all the psychology shows that's bad for people's
[11:59.280 --> 12:02.680]  minds even if it's one tour if they later think the war was wrong or
[12:02.680 --> 12:10.880]  questionable so you have them being used and abused rode hard and put away
[12:10.880 --> 12:16.880]  wet over and over again you have them trained to kill and then you put them on
[12:16.880 --> 12:21.560]  a cocktail of drugs even before they get out of the military what do you
[12:21.560 --> 12:25.440]  expect is going to happen well they want to wreck them they want to ruin them
[12:25.440 --> 12:30.040]  the globalists have stated that the military retiring veterans returning
[12:30.040 --> 12:33.960]  veterans are the number one terror threat and the enemy we first broke this
[12:33.960 --> 12:38.440]  six years ago it was so incredible when we first got the secret documents from
[12:38.440 --> 12:43.600]  federal marshals and then confirm them through state police state versions that
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.680]  Ron Paul his office called me and said is that really real mr. Jones because we
[12:48.680 --> 12:53.320]  know you're a credible person but you're kidding returning veterans and Ron Paul
[12:53.320 --> 12:57.680]  are terrorist and I said listen call the phone number on it the FBI is going to
[12:57.680 --> 13:05.480]  flip out it's real it's real in the FBI wanted to come to my house when I called
[13:05.480 --> 13:08.840]  them the other reporters were intimidated at that time again wouldn't
[13:08.840 --> 13:14.000]  call phone numbers on government documents I do and we got those documents a
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  few weeks ago where they were saying that they're training to take on web
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.280]  dissent during martial law and to quote takeout constitutionalist quote against
[13:21.280 --> 13:27.440]  socialist tyranny that's a close quote against socialist tyranny and I people
[13:27.440 --> 13:30.680]  said is it real is it real I said yeah it looks real looks like ADL Southern
[13:30.680 --> 13:36.160]  Barbery Law Center call the phone numbers oh I just I got in here picked the
[13:36.160 --> 13:40.080]  phone up started calling those phone numbers and they were flipping out like
[13:40.080 --> 13:43.640]  ought to call those numbers back and record them that's even better just to
[13:43.640 --> 13:48.600]  illustrate what's going on the point is people said veterans are the terror
[13:48.600 --> 13:52.160]  threat and who Homeland Security's for of course you are it's a criminal
[13:52.160 --> 13:59.000]  foreign takeover just like in Nazi Germany just like anywhere else you get
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.400]  special interest that takeover it's happening here and admitting how much
[14:02.400 --> 14:08.400]  trouble we're in is the only hope we have of reversing this now the good news
[14:08.400 --> 14:14.080]  is in popular culture across the board whether it's man of steel or the new
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.440]  captain America it's about secret government groups staging false flag
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.120]  terror to bring in martial law it's about eugenics it's about tyranny it's
[14:22.120 --> 14:25.960]  about being dishonorable and how horrible that is I see more and more
[14:25.960 --> 14:32.120]  positive movies out of Hollywood movies like up more and more I see horrible
[14:32.120 --> 14:36.680]  anti-human garbage out of television that's run by the old commanders of
[14:36.680 --> 14:40.320]  Hollywood that's where the real money set by the way they can make a hundred
[14:40.320 --> 14:44.240]  million dollars a year profit off one hit TV show or more like some of them made
[14:44.240 --> 14:47.760]  100 million in a month like Seinfeld made almost 100 million in one month it's
[14:47.760 --> 14:52.040]  last season and then in the syndication the point is is that the old guard is
[14:52.040 --> 14:57.200]  absolutely human extremist pure evil but there is a total rebellion across
[14:57.200 --> 15:01.200]  Hollywood that I keep telling you about that is indicative of what's about to
[15:01.200 --> 15:06.360]  happen when some are redstone and others die that almost everyone in Hollywood
[15:06.360 --> 15:11.240]  and I mean lawyers producers I mean even people that are 55 60 years old you
[15:11.240 --> 15:15.320]  think they'd be income control no they're under the control of 85 95 year
[15:15.320 --> 15:22.080]  old men and they absolutely hate it and it is cult level on fire I mean that in
[15:22.080 --> 15:27.360]  a good way like you know the fans of cult this cult that like cult film cult
[15:27.360 --> 15:37.400]  cinema like road warriors a cult classic liberty is on fire in Hollywood I know
[15:37.400 --> 15:41.920]  almost no one in Hollywood I know a lot of people who isn't a closet anti-new
[15:41.920 --> 15:44.840]  world order conspiracy theorist that just means you question the official
[15:44.840 --> 15:50.000]  narrative of the establishment Rob Lowe has come out and said quote I want the
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.080]  government out of almost everything close quote and says he's sick of the
[15:54.080 --> 15:58.800]  entire rotten system and it's totally corrupt and going down you see what I'm
[15:58.800 --> 16:03.320]  talking about Bruce Willis has said the same thing in Vanity Fair I could go on
[16:03.320 --> 16:07.600]  for hours and my point is people said well why do we care about Hollywood it's
[16:07.600 --> 16:13.720]  been the cultural dominant system to make people comply and say I'm anti-gun
[16:13.720 --> 16:18.400]  I'm anti-family I'm a liberal that's not liberal that's authoritarian that whole
[16:18.400 --> 16:24.240]  system is coming down and don't think the power structure doesn't know it
[16:24.240 --> 16:28.120]  there's probably six or seven guys that run Hollywood up at the top of the big
[16:28.120 --> 16:33.160]  production companies and when anybody puts out any type of message of liberty
[16:33.160 --> 16:36.640]  they call them up and threaten them and threaten the black ball them happen to
[16:36.640 --> 16:42.400]  mark Cuban I witnessed it later came out in the New York Times and the reason I
[16:42.400 --> 16:47.960]  get back to this Hollywood thing is the whole house of cards is coming down
[16:47.960 --> 16:53.560]  that's why the system wants to bring in authoritarianism 90% of warfare is
[16:53.560 --> 16:57.560]  psychological Hollywood is the tip of the spear for the New World Order and if
[16:57.560 --> 17:03.320]  they lose their own people it's over that's why they want to just skip all
[17:03.320 --> 17:08.160]  that bring in authoritarianism now or they could actually disappear you or
[17:08.160 --> 17:11.440]  arrest you because threatening everyone doesn't work anymore because what
[17:11.440 --> 17:19.400]  happens when everybody starts speaking out what happens when no one's
[17:19.400 --> 17:23.680]  intimidated anymore you can't stop everybody unless you already had a total
[17:23.680 --> 17:27.040]  tyranny and so we're in a race for the finish line with the tyrants I mean I'll
[17:27.040 --> 17:30.120]  give you an example Willie Nelson about eight years ago came to one of my film
[17:30.120 --> 17:33.680]  premieres for in-game and showed up and came around the counter I was signing
[17:33.680 --> 17:38.160]  DVDs afterwards and you know hey give me your number I'm gonna call you I really
[17:38.160 --> 17:43.120]  like what you do I listen to your show almost every day and I'm like well thank
[17:43.120 --> 17:48.120]  you Willie I heard you were here and didn't believe it and then he left so I
[17:48.120 --> 17:50.560]  got to know Willie Nelson started playing chess with him hanging out with him
[17:50.560 --> 17:55.560]  you know here and there eating dinner here and there and people started death
[17:55.560 --> 17:59.880]  threatening we're gonna kill you if you don't say you're he started saying he
[17:59.880 --> 18:07.160]  was pro-gun that 9-11 was an inside job that eugenics was the threat and he was
[18:07.160 --> 18:13.440]  about 72 years old then he's 80 he wasn't he was still super sharp he's
[18:13.440 --> 18:17.480]  still somewhat sharp but not at 80 and not as sharp as he used to be the point
[18:17.480 --> 18:22.960]  is I mean who would be the point is is that I mean I watched that where they
[18:22.960 --> 18:27.560]  literally death-threatening and then he had Ventura and I to speak at some deal
[18:27.560 --> 18:32.080]  and they were threatening to blow the place up nobody ever even knew about
[18:32.080 --> 18:35.760]  this I didn't talk about it and he said okay you guys can still speak Ventura
[18:35.760 --> 18:39.000]  said we don't care go have a good time Willie we're to watch the show as if
[18:39.000 --> 18:43.480]  Ventura cares about speaking to 4,000 5,000 people as if I care I'm gonna flip
[18:43.480 --> 18:48.680]  a switch and talk to 3 million every day but the issue is is that's the type of
[18:48.680 --> 18:52.480]  stuff that goes on the establishment is there trying to keep everybody on the
[18:52.480 --> 18:56.000]  reservation and there is a major pushback where do you think the biggest
[18:56.000 --> 19:02.200]  pushback is going to be inside Hollywood people are sick of it the
[19:02.200 --> 19:06.120]  Republican Tea Party is sick of the Republican leadership trying to prop up
[19:06.120 --> 19:09.880]  Obamacare and trying to prop up open borders and trying to prop up gun
[19:09.880 --> 19:15.040]  control it's an establishment working together to suppress real change and we
[19:15.040 --> 19:22.280]  ever shatter that with the incredible allure the sexiness of freedom true
[19:22.280 --> 19:27.480]  freedom true Americana it's over people are buying what we're selling freedom
[19:27.480 --> 19:31.600]  people are not buying what the establishment is selling they're a
[19:31.600 --> 19:36.360]  bunch of gangster bullies intimidating everyone and then your local talk show
[19:36.360 --> 19:40.240]  hosts and local reporters they all comply with whatever the party line is
[19:40.240 --> 19:45.080]  because the words out you do what the establishment says you repeat what the
[19:45.080 --> 19:51.560]  national talk show host says and you'll go far in life no you'll go nowhere so
[19:51.560 --> 19:55.480]  there's a total revolution in understanding happening right now and
[19:55.480 --> 19:58.760]  the battle is joined we're gonna come right back with big breaking news on
[19:58.760 --> 20:03.400]  Obamacare with the globalists making more and more advances into our freedoms

[25:11.120 --> 25:14.920]  their families have to come in and then just so happens Jeb they vote Democrat
[25:14.920 --> 25:22.680]  about 90% of the time which you love cuz the Republicans back during your very
[25:22.680 --> 25:30.320]  Goldwater's era weren't as bad as they are now and so the Bush's basically with
[25:30.320 --> 25:34.160]  the neocons took over the Republican Party they are the Democrats they are
[25:34.160 --> 25:39.320]  the Democrats right wing and they share power with the Clintons who were
[25:39.320 --> 25:44.720]  protégés of CIA officer George Herbert Walker Bush and you know that's all
[25:44.720 --> 25:50.480]  come out it's all completely staged all a giant joke to them and I told you you'd
[25:50.480 --> 25:54.160]  see Banner and the Republicans try to prop up Obamacare and keep the law in
[25:54.160 --> 26:00.800]  place with a couple of cosmetic changes that actually don't change anything on

[26:11.920 --> 26:19.120]  it's an act of love it's an act of love ladies and gentlemen can I go to Mexico
[26:19.120 --> 26:22.840]  and have my baby paid for when it's born and then say my family I need my
[26:22.840 --> 26:29.120]  family from El Norte to come down here with me come on you would be laughed at

[26:44.520 --> 26:52.480]  work camps for the Guatemalans but but Americans oh oh Jeb Bush just like he
[26:52.480 --> 26:55.960]  was for NAFTA and GATT and just like they were for the police state and the
[26:55.960 --> 27:00.720]  drug war and Obamacare Jeb Bush Republican leadership helped write
[27:00.720 --> 27:04.800]  Obamacare for the big insurance companies openly owned by people like
[27:04.800 --> 27:09.600]  Warren Buffett who's such a nice old man he he's a nice old man with his big
[27:09.600 --> 27:16.640]  banks laundering all that money on record just a friendly old man a friendly

[27:36.120 --> 27:43.280]  wrote it AP should have GOP works with Obama behind the scenes to stop
[27:43.280 --> 27:50.560]  revolution against Obamacare and its repeal or headline GOP seeks to cover
[27:50.560 --> 27:56.720]  Obama and the Democratic Party from total political annihilation and seek to
[27:56.720 --> 28:00.760]  protect the party who passed the bill Republicans wrote that should be the
[28:00.760 --> 28:07.720]  headline you know with Ezekiel Emanuel and the Eugenicist the death panel
[28:07.720 --> 28:13.320]  Bill and the Gates Foundation sponsoring it along with Mitt Romney in
[28:13.320 --> 28:20.400]  Massachusetts where the pilot state what 15 years ago and they passed the core of
[28:20.400 --> 28:25.360]  what became law I mean it wasn't as bad as what the Democrats added on to it but
[28:25.360 --> 28:30.160]  it was really bad basically insurance companies making you buy their product
[28:30.160 --> 28:33.080]  where they can charge whatever they want and lower the quality of the product
[28:33.080 --> 28:35.680]  and have the government set the standards of what type of tests and
[28:35.680 --> 28:38.200]  surgeries you can get what do you think is going to happen prices are going to
[28:38.200 --> 28:41.480]  go up you're going to get less what would you do you were an offshore mega
[28:41.480 --> 28:47.320]  corporation that owns insurance companies well every time they can they
[28:47.320 --> 28:51.320]  finance dictators in third world countries see the globalist finance pure
[28:51.320 --> 28:55.400]  evil you are nothing but dead meat to them and when you act so naive and
[28:55.400 --> 29:00.080]  ignorant folks they say that's a self-fulfilling prophecy that you deserve
[29:00.080 --> 29:07.280]  to be run over by the system that that you deserve to be crushed by the
[29:07.280 --> 29:13.360]  establishment and so they make it a partisan issue oh look the Republicans

[34:20.600 --> 34:25.760]  currency that they've gotten western governments to sign on to and guarantee
[34:25.760 --> 34:31.080]  as their debts turning us into financial slaves in the act of bailing them
[34:31.080 --> 34:37.080]  out a giant ball and chain with a greater financial weight than the sun
[34:37.080 --> 34:45.160]  itself imagine that a thousand fours hammers tied to our legs that's the
[34:45.160 --> 34:50.280]  type of weight we're talking about here financially culturally all a giant
[34:50.280 --> 34:55.720]  fraud intertwined into all the pensions intertwined into the culture
[34:55.720 --> 35:00.480]  intertwined into the investments to where the cancer has become the body
[35:00.480 --> 35:06.560]  itself and that's not enough for them they have a jenna 21 globally to create
[35:06.560 --> 35:10.680]  neo feudalism to cut off resources to make the public right at starvation
[35:10.680 --> 35:15.680]  level so that politically you will jump through any hope for resources so
[35:15.680 --> 35:20.920]  there's artificial scarcity and at the top of the pyramid you have the large
[35:20.920 --> 35:27.480]  central banks that are in control and then they've got other groups that are
[35:27.480 --> 35:35.640]  intertwined and interconnected as well that are a big part of that and they're
[35:35.640 --> 35:41.160]  the big lobbying groups they're the political class they are the select
[35:41.160 --> 35:47.200]  healthcare groups that are insiders who were exempt from the main Obamacare
[35:47.200 --> 35:51.840]  system who got their two cents in to have the legislation written to shut
[35:51.840 --> 35:55.920]  down their competition and to create unfair trade advantages you've got the
[35:55.920 --> 36:00.400]  lobbyists that help write it to be 13,000 pages of addendums so that it's
[36:00.400 --> 36:06.120]  always creating new crises always creating new problems always creating the
[36:06.120 --> 36:13.120]  equivalent of a contested divorce at every level so that all the bureaucrats
[36:13.120 --> 36:19.320]  and consultants and lobbyists can just endlessly feed off of new
[36:19.320 --> 36:27.040]  laws and addendums and executive orders to the giant metastasizing blob that is
[36:27.040 --> 36:33.280]  Obamacare and that's why it was written to absolutely destroy the country so
[36:33.280 --> 36:37.440]  that they can piecemeal then be the saviors
[36:37.880 --> 36:46.120]  applying or backing off of certain areas of the main law to where then they
[36:46.120 --> 36:49.600]  create the problem they can offer the solution just like they help get
[36:49.600 --> 36:53.400]  government involved in health care to begin with driving up prices bringing in
[36:53.400 --> 36:58.040]  political corruption giving the political class power over health care just
[36:58.040 --> 37:01.360]  like they've done with the drug war just like they've done with the prisons just
[37:01.360 --> 37:07.080]  like they've done with everything else this is done over and over and over again
[37:07.080 --> 37:13.080]  so with Obamacare the journey is the destination that's the most important
[37:13.080 --> 37:18.280]  thing to understand here and they have tricks they play they don't want all of
[37:18.280 --> 37:21.840]  it to go in at once they don't want you to know the reason your health care is
[37:21.840 --> 37:24.800]  doubling or tripling is because it was written in the bill they don't want you
[37:24.800 --> 37:28.520]  to know the reason your payroll went up was because of the bill your payroll
[37:28.520 --> 37:32.360]  tax they don't want you to know the reason the IRS is going to garnish your
[37:32.360 --> 37:36.960]  wages and take your bank account is because of the bill they want you to
[37:36.960 --> 37:42.080]  think it's all screwed up and broken and that's why it's happening and oh a
[37:42.080 --> 37:46.080]  million signed up the first day I told you that's people that think they signed
[37:46.080 --> 37:49.880]  up and then it turned out a month later no one had signed up and then they said
[37:49.880 --> 37:52.960]  three million it signed up and it turned out it was a hundred thousand who had to
[37:52.960 --> 37:56.360]  do it by phone and then all they got handed over to was an insurance company
[37:56.360 --> 38:01.040]  to screw them and double charge them bare minimum people that never had
[38:01.040 --> 38:04.880]  insurance didn't know how to do it going into the most predatory hands then
[38:04.880 --> 38:11.840]  you've got other layers of the of the political organizer community affairs
[38:11.840 --> 38:19.520]  type where you've get the navigators the acorn 2.0 running around getting social
[38:19.520 --> 38:24.560]  security numbers getting political data getting people for political enrollment
[38:24.560 --> 38:28.160]  getting people into your political organizations just good old-fashioned
[38:28.160 --> 38:32.000]  fraud good old-fashioned money laundering that's all coming out in every
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.880]  major state this is a criminal enterprise this is a giant criminal feeding
[38:37.880 --> 38:42.600]  frenzy like a group of 30 dolphins spending two hours surrounding and
[38:42.600 --> 38:46.400]  corralling a group of fish until they get them into a tight ball than having a
[38:46.400 --> 38:53.480]  feeding frenzy you are being fed on by a predator system that has designed the
[38:53.480 --> 38:59.320]  breakdown of the system so that they can reap incredible profits and control out
[38:59.320 --> 39:03.960]  of it with the larger social engineering plan of finally wrecking the
[39:03.960 --> 39:09.000]  civilization because the globalists are exempt from it all in their governmental
[39:09.000 --> 39:15.600]  corporate reservations above the law with diplomatic corporate immunity she
[39:15.600 --> 39:19.680]  have the banks you have the insurance companies you have the lobbyist you have
[39:19.680 --> 39:24.840]  the navigators you have the sickening degenerate insider trading political
[39:24.840 --> 39:29.520]  class members six years ago seven years ago it came out that Congress was
[39:29.520 --> 39:33.360]  insider trading into the billions and people were going to Congress worth a
[39:33.360 --> 39:37.680]  million and getting out worth 800 million not to mention their trust funds
[39:37.680 --> 39:43.480]  with billions and the CBS headline was insider trading legal for Congress put
[39:43.480 --> 39:47.160]  that into the search engine let's show the TV viewers radio listeners put it in
[39:47.160 --> 39:54.400]  con insider trading legal for Congress or Congress allowed to insider trade
[39:54.400 --> 39:59.040]  because they said so just like the police now saying we can come in your
[39:59.040 --> 40:02.640]  house without warrants because we say so we can set up checkpoints on the
[40:02.640 --> 40:05.880]  highway because we say so we can listen to your phone calls without warrants
[40:05.880 --> 40:09.960]  local police all over the country it's now being announced because we say so
[40:09.960 --> 40:14.360]  and we can force inoculate your kids because we say so and we could put
[40:14.360 --> 40:17.800]  fluoride in your water because we say so and we could put cancer viruses in your
[40:17.800 --> 40:21.920]  vaccines because we say so and we could set up death panels and make jokes about
[40:21.920 --> 40:24.840]  it because we say so
[40:25.280 --> 40:31.760]  there's C in BC insider trading in DC just got easier yeah that was last year
[40:31.760 --> 40:37.040]  when they passed a law legalizing their insider trading for years they had said
[40:37.040 --> 40:40.400]  it was illegal but they hadn't really done it then they came out and said no
[40:40.400 --> 40:48.800]  no no we're just allowed to there it is Congress insiders above the law CBS news
[40:48.800 --> 41:01.880]  the the point is is that this is the event horizon of tyranny they passed the
[41:01.880 --> 41:10.040]  point that we've now gotten to they get away with the point they've now brought
[41:10.040 --> 41:15.560]  us to Katie bar the door because people are like all the corruptions coming out
[41:15.560 --> 41:20.480]  isn't this great no no no no no if it all comes out and nobody gets in trouble
[41:20.480 --> 41:25.840]  and we don't reverse them the damn breaks and everything is fair game and
[41:25.840 --> 41:30.360]  then people will get so desperate and scared they're gonna start shooting the
[41:30.360 --> 41:36.760]  enforcers and then the civil war starts just as sure as grandma would put an
[41:36.760 --> 41:42.600]  apple pie out on the window ledge to cool it this is gonna happen just as
[41:42.600 --> 41:50.240]  sure as the Sun came up this morning just as sure as birds wake up in the
[41:50.240 --> 41:55.000]  morning tweeting this is gonna unfold ladies and gentlemen this is a total
[41:55.000 --> 42:02.440]  criminal mass and the Tea Party are a bunch of moral on average people that
[42:02.440 --> 42:07.440]  really are pro-gun really are pro-family who really do value freedom and who are
[42:07.440 --> 42:10.720]  really upset they're not perfect the Republicans tried to co-opt in the last
[42:10.720 --> 42:19.160]  six seven years that failed and so now ladies and gentlemen the Republican and
[42:19.160 --> 42:24.960]  Democratic leadership are trying to gut the Tea Party and they've circled the
[42:24.960 --> 42:30.940]  wagons and the reason the Tea Party's enemy number one is because they're
[42:30.940 --> 42:35.920]  informed they know about the UN they know about world government they know
[42:35.920 --> 42:42.560]  that you cut taxes government government revenue increases they know the system
[42:42.560 --> 42:45.800]  wants to stall the country and bankrupt the general public to complete our
[42:45.800 --> 42:49.880]  journey into serfdom and dependency they know they know and they're learning
[42:49.880 --> 42:56.760]  quickly my information the information we've broken down here by the grace of
[42:56.760 --> 43:03.280]  God our real power your real power because you are the power of this
[43:03.280 --> 43:07.880]  broadcast has now made it safe for the other big talk show hosts across the
[43:07.880 --> 43:14.320]  board to tell the truth because their constituents their listeners now know
[43:14.320 --> 43:18.440]  the truth so even if some of those big national hosts had been sellouts before
[43:18.440 --> 43:22.840]  it was mainly because they were scared it was mainly because they were on a
[43:22.840 --> 43:27.720]  short leash when more people speak out we normalize telling the truth it makes
[43:27.720 --> 43:36.560]  it safe for right wing talk show host libertarian talk show host for liberals
[43:36.560 --> 43:43.120]  in Hollywood who are real liberals in the vein of Thomas Jefferson this is the
[43:43.120 --> 43:56.560]  reality and we are now at this absolutely critical crossroads we are now
[43:56.560 --> 44:01.120]  there in a cultural revolution they have their cultural revolution of
[44:01.120 --> 44:05.800]  socialism of tyranny of domestication that they brand is liberal and happy and
[44:05.800 --> 44:12.920]  empowering when the fruits of it or total enslavement lies fraud poverty so
[44:12.920 --> 44:22.400]  we are now at that point where we have to go no we're the revolutionaries we're
[44:22.400 --> 44:25.600]  the people bringing the Renaissance we're the people bringing liberty we're
[44:25.600 --> 44:29.520]  the people that are liberals we're the people that are for human empowerment
[44:29.520 --> 44:33.560]  we're the people that have the plan that's been proven to work over and over
[44:33.560 --> 44:38.160]  again tyranny's been tried a hundred times more than liberty and it always
[44:38.160 --> 44:42.280]  leads the same place it's horrible let's not go down this road let's be
[44:42.280 --> 44:49.280]  virtuous let's turn back now even if people like John Boehner wanted to do
[44:49.280 --> 44:51.920]  the right thing he can't because he wouldn't have been allowed to be the
[44:51.920 --> 44:58.960]  speaker if they didn't have enough dirt on him to hang him high that's why if
[44:58.960 --> 45:03.160]  somebody does the right thing and then it comes out that they've got a mistress
[45:03.160 --> 45:07.880]  or it comes out that 20 years ago they took some money they shouldn't have or
[45:07.880 --> 45:12.720]  whatever we've got to leave them alone and realize that's political dirty
[45:12.720 --> 45:18.400]  tricks but until the public gets angry enough to get behind champions and to
[45:18.400 --> 45:21.560]  get I mean I'm sure there's no dirt on Rand Paul they would have already
[45:21.560 --> 45:24.840]  brought it out but they've sure tried to manufacture it if we ask Rand Paul to
[45:24.840 --> 45:29.280]  run or Ted Cruz and then a couple skeletons come out of the closet folks
[45:29.280 --> 45:33.720]  you've got to understand that if the if the establishment is bringing out the
[45:33.720 --> 45:38.440]  skeletons a it's probably a lie or exaggerated and it doesn't matter
[45:38.440 --> 45:42.160]  because it's the enemy trying to take down somebody that's good it's very
[45:42.160 --> 45:47.760]  very simple we hang together we hang separate and I'm not glorifying Rand
[45:47.760 --> 45:51.840]  Paul or Ted Cruz but I'll tell you this the system doesn't like them and wants
[45:51.840 --> 45:58.600]  to destroy them and they're an example to all these millions of people that are
[45:58.600 --> 46:02.720]  looking for a change looking for an alternative and the Republican leadership
[46:02.720 --> 46:07.640]  is offering more country club Republican establishment corruption and more
[46:07.640 --> 46:11.520]  socialism and corporate bailouts and wars and surveillance and police state
[46:11.520 --> 46:15.480]  and drug war and the Democrats are offering more of the same but with some
[46:15.480 --> 46:19.720]  cultural pandering of oh we care about the minorities that are really the
[46:19.720 --> 46:24.000]  majority now though and we care about women and and and you know you're on
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.120]  our winning team I mean it's literally raw raw Coke versus Pepsi Chevy versus
[46:29.120 --> 46:37.000]  Ford it means nothing and that's why the Republicans have put into a bill for
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.960]  Lord Obama to sign to allow a little more choice for small businesses because
[46:41.960 --> 46:45.280]  tens of millions are being kicked off their insurance some of the numbers
[46:45.280 --> 46:49.320]  are over 10 million at least 7 million and then oh Obama goes 6 million have
[46:49.320 --> 46:56.120]  signed up for Obamacare that's not even true it's not even 2 million now and it
[46:56.120 --> 47:00.880]  does increase payroll taxes on poor people if you're making $18,000 a year
[47:00.880 --> 47:04.920]  your payroll tax went up that is incredible you can't live on that
[47:04.920 --> 47:11.560]  nowadays if you've got kids forget it and every business I know is laying
[47:11.560 --> 47:17.320]  people off or cutting their hours because most businesses the owners are
[47:17.320 --> 47:21.720]  getting maybe 5% profit and then and the half that goes in taxes or more what's
[47:21.720 --> 47:27.360]  the point there are so many well-to-do upper middle class people that are just
[47:27.360 --> 47:31.200]  selling their businesses are shutting down because they can retire now why
[47:31.200 --> 47:34.720]  should they keep a business going when all they get is grief and hell and
[47:34.720 --> 47:42.360]  bureaucrats because they are not exempt from Obamacare let's say you won't be
[47:42.360 --> 47:46.600]  Terry's hamburger chain that's just in Austin Texas been around for maybe 10
[47:46.600 --> 47:50.960]  years very popular I looked it up they didn't get an Obamacare exemption
[47:50.960 --> 47:57.920]  McDonald's right across the street on South Lamar South Lamar and the river
[47:57.920 --> 48:02.360]  right across the street we should report on that how p Terry's on this side of
[48:02.360 --> 48:06.880]  the street doesn't get an Obamacare exemption but the McDonald's across the
[48:06.880 --> 48:14.400]  street does McDonald's can keep its workers at 40 hours a week but p Terry's
[48:14.400 --> 48:18.680]  has got to cut them down by 10 15 hours or they've got to pay the Obamacare and
[48:18.680 --> 48:23.080]  they can't afford it or their hamburgers gonna be $10 doesn't matter
[48:23.080 --> 48:26.640]  their hamburgers organic doesn't matter it's flame-broiled doesn't matter it
[48:26.640 --> 48:29.480]  tastes a hundred times better than the plastic food across the street that
[48:29.480 --> 48:34.400]  literally has plastic in it they can't compete with subway across the street and
[48:34.400 --> 48:42.440]  McDonald's across the street who are exempt that's discrimination while
[48:42.440 --> 48:46.920]  they're screaming black black white white race race male female north south
[48:46.920 --> 48:50.720]  blah blah blah they're trying to scream about those differences to make us all
[48:50.720 --> 48:54.880]  fight about those because if we ever got together and went man I own an auto
[48:54.880 --> 49:01.320]  parts place and I'm not exempt but that big national chain is let me tell you
[49:01.320 --> 49:06.720]  that's a lawsuit that's discriminatory this law is a fraud repeal it and it's
[49:06.720 --> 49:11.880]  over 80% now in major polls are against Obamacare and as it kicks in people are
[49:11.880 --> 49:15.120]  against it and what does the establishment do oh there's no fines
[49:15.120 --> 49:21.600]  there's no penalties my CPA tells me the most people are on salary around here
[49:21.600 --> 49:25.560]  but it's the equivalent we're going to have to lay people off or cut their
[49:25.560 --> 49:31.800]  hours at least a few people or or I guess I'll just have to sit there and
[49:31.800 --> 49:38.000]  have more advertising just to pay more taxes it's a losing battle I'm being
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.360]  called get ready to pay the penalty and then if I say I'm getting ready to pay
[49:42.360 --> 49:46.920]  penalties the media says liar it doesn't exist when it exists on record
[49:46.920 --> 49:52.040]  because only about 10% of the public now actually has employees they know 90% of
[49:52.040 --> 49:58.040]  you don't know and literally think we're lying to you that's how evil these
[49:58.040 --> 50:05.320]  people are the unions are exempt all of them are exempt but me and you that's
[50:05.320 --> 50:09.520]  discriminatory I don't care what color you are what religion you are you're not
[50:09.520 --> 50:14.640]  part of the insider club you're going to get screwed and now the Republicans have
[50:14.640 --> 50:18.440]  passed a legislation where some medium-sized corporations might be able
[50:18.440 --> 50:25.840]  to have a little more choice in joining larger health groups and again that's
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.200]  the Republicans messing with Obamacare instead of repealing it when they could
[50:30.200 --> 50:34.840]  literally blow on it and it would fall over it's a house made of straw they don't
[50:34.840 --> 50:38.440]  have to huff or puff or anything you just literally poke it it falls over
[50:38.440 --> 50:43.720]  universally unpopular growing more unpopular by the day the 20% of morons
[50:43.720 --> 50:47.200]  out there that still suck their thumbs and think Obama loves them haven't
[50:47.200 --> 50:50.360]  figured out it's a giant screwjob yet they're about to wake up we can't
[50:50.360 --> 50:54.600]  repeal something this evil this discriminatory no we can't because the
[50:54.600 --> 50:59.800]  Republican leadership are degenerate filthy criminals
[51:00.960 --> 51:05.960]  Jessica Armand here creator of my magic mud the all-natural teeth whitener and
[51:05.960 --> 51:09.840]  strengthening remedy that's getting rave reviews from GCN listeners here's what
[51:09.840 --> 51:13.880]  Austin dentist dr. Griffin Cole has to say about it I really love this magic
[51:13.880 --> 51:17.520]  mud product because charcoal is so absorbent it's very effective at taking

[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:15.640]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:22.600]  the name of the game is controlled by the corporate governing ruling class
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.800]  they want to be able to make all the decisions for you
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:29.480]  tell you where to live tell you what to eat how to live your lives
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:33.560]  whose products to buy that's what obama care is about is shutting down their
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.800]  competition shutting down companies that aren't affiliated with the
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:42.040]  globalist the major unions are exempt
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.520]  multi thousand major companies like mcdonald's
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:50.280]  subway and others were given exemptions last year
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:55.400]  to the obama care act they wrote the loopholes
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:00.680]  to where they can keep their employees for 40 hours but you
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:04.440]  you have to cut them to 30 hours or less
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.800]  or it kicks in you have to pay for the obama care
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.400]  which many businesses just can't do especially now
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:14.680]  as making you buy a product is making the price go up
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:18.600]  so i've asked leon macadoo to go out for the nightly news tonight
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:25.560]  and to go to the corner of south lamar right where it hits uh
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:30.360]  martin springs and you can point right across the street to a mcdonald's
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:35.000]  that was given health care waivers into a texas-based hamburger burger company
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.720]  that it was not given waivers peteris and there's the example now what does that
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:44.120]  do it allows them to pass on the savings they
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:48.920]  have with the monsanto bill gates controlled mcdonald's
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.360]  into the cost of their food so that it's a lot less
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:56.440]  expensive so that people will choose to eat there
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.560]  and not at peteris even though peteris is edible
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.200]  compared to mcdonald's where literally a supersize me shows the food does not
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.040]  rot and basically lives in your cola
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.640]  and they literally have federal regulations written where they can have
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:16.600]  ingredients that are in plastic that are in silicone in the chicken mcnuggets
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.120]  just like subway has plastic in their bread they claim they're going to take it
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:24.920]  out but we haven't seen that happen yet this shows who these corporations are
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:28.920]  that's what obama care is all about why do you think the big associations were
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:32.600]  for obama care why do you think the republican leadership helped write it
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.960]  because it's written as a way to shut down all their competition
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:41.160]  but they say a picture tells a thousand words what does video do
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:46.120]  with leon macadoo out there illustrating here i am at peteris
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.160]  which did not get an obama care waiver you can look up the list of obama care
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.280]  waivers online it's over three thousand last time i checked
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:56.200]  three thousand companies now the unions have gotten them
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.560]  that's tens of millions of people
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.600]  obama care exempted one thousand two hundred plus
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:08.840]  groups including congress and then that article asked did they and then
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.200]  they spin it well they've got it opt into another group you know that you know
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:17.160]  they play all these games like it's not illegal when congress
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.440]  has insider trading like i talked about last hour because we say so
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.360]  it's not illegal when the nsa spies on you even though it's on record it's
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.440]  illegal and speaking of that i want to go to
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.280]  judge andrew napolitano's pc did from last friday
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.680]  and air that in a moment but before i do that i want to get your
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.920]  your take on this because this is the real form of discrimination
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.920]  it's not oh i think somebody didn't serve me quick because i'm black or
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.720]  i think somebody you know didn't serve me quick because i'm white
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:50.920]  or uh you know you're not for open borders so you're racist
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.600]  the very same globalist interest that won open borders that gave us nafta and
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.320]  gat and kafta and and and all the rest of the stuff
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.080]  the same jeb bush now wants open borders because it's good
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.240]  for the globalist not good for us what about the real discrimination
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.200]  of us having to pay trillions in banker bailouts
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.960]  to banks that created fraudulent derivatives and they now say that's
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.120]  our debt your debt my debt your children's debt
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.080]  that's the total discrimination the discrimination of obama care
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.120]  the discrimination of government you try to spy on government you go to
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.160]  prison for espionage but they spy on you illegally
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:26.200]  and oh it's okay we're the government we're here to help you
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:30.680]  this is a fraud this is a scam and quite frankly
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.720]  congress has a six percent approval rating more and more of hollywood is
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.720]  speaking out and going public liberal darling rob low has gone public
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.520]  saying i want government out of almost every area of my life
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:45.240]  people are waking up and saying no we've just got to have the courage to tell it
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.040]  like it is we've just got to have the courage to speak out
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.880]  now and give other people political cover so they can speak out
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.480]  so the system can't persecute and can't prosecute
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:13:00.040]  and can't chill and can't hurt and can't demonize all of us
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:03.720]  we all start going public we all start speaking out
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:07.800]  we all start doing the right thing we all stop being intimidated
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.400]  and the whole system of tyranny will come down like a house of cards
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:16.040]  some people say yeah but then that might bring down the whole system itself
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.440]  the globalists have codified their system of tyranny in agenda 21
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:25.000]  so that when they implode things they rationalize that as a political system
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.280]  of domestication and dependency cloward and pivot agenda 21
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:34.120]  this is a real strategy and you could see it taking place so we don't have a
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.760]  choice we're cornered they're turning off our
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.720]  life support they're shutting down our society
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.000]  they want to have a game of chicken let's have it
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.520]  because they've got a score to settle with america the globalists hate this
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:49.400]  country more than they hate anybody else
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:53.080]  they want to have their way with us that's the main goal
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.960]  is running our lives i mean what's wrong with this headline
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.840]  look at this headline students fed up with michelle obama school lunch
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.080]  overhaul menu item snapshots spell out why and we'll
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:11.240]  show you some of those snapshots from the blaze
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:15.480]  and it goes through the fact that a million public school students said no
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:18.120]  way to their cafeteria menus after michelle obama's
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.720]  anti-obesity campaign led to anger and frustration over food
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:26.520]  that apparently many american kids didn't want but for those without other
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:30.440]  options all that's left is the power of social media and cell phone cameras
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:34.600]  when they simply can't take another bite
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.640]  folks this is worse than prison food and school food's never been perfect
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:44.040]  but this is worse than than than prison food
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:49.880]  because the parents put up with it ladies and gentlemen
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:53.080]  the parents put up with it when i was a child that was pretty good at school
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.160]  lunch at public school when my mother was a child it was like a nice
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.680]  restaurant the chicken fried steaks the the fish
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:04.680]  because the parents locally ran the school they paid for it and it was high
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.640]  quality you let government get involved you let the federal government get
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:12.120]  involved it has gotten worse and worse until now
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:17.320]  school lunch food is literally hell on earth my children are home school but
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.880]  they went to a home school academy a few years ago
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:23.400]  very nice school nice people three days a week
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.520]  and they brought me the literature home and i went to the school and i saw what
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.520]  was at lunch if you didn't pack a lunch which we did
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:34.040]  and it was michelle obama every week lecturing them on what to eat
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.320]  in handouts because the school was accredited to be accredited you have to
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:41.080]  have this and it was saying what is healthy lunchables
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.160]  a bunch of msg laden dead meat
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.680]  and other crud and and gmo see it's not it's have low calories eat gmo have
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.800]  aspartame it's not don't eat poison it's oh we're all
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.240]  sick because we have too many calories and it's literally worse
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.000]  than the food that i've seen in documentaries in maximum security
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.320]  prisons prisons actually have pretty good food in a lot of cases
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.600]  your children are fed worse than what prisoners are
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:11.640]  because the same companies that run the prison food a lot of times run the
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.840]  school programs and prisoners will riot over food
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:19.800]  kids won't and so it goes down down down in quality but if
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.240]  you're not for it you're racist because michelle obama
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.120]  what's wrong with the picture of not just having the federal government run the
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:30.680]  food but to have a woman lecturing and
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.080]  telling kids what they're going to eat not the parents
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.840]  in now in colorado texas illinois new york state florida
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:42.840]  we have confirmed mainstream reports where you are not allowed to pack your
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:46.120]  child a school lunch and the arguments are there might be
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.560]  peanuts and it kills everybody since when is everybody dying for
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.840]  peanuts since we eat gmo and develop other
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.680]  autoimmune disorders they've always got an excuse ladies and gentlemen they've
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.760]  always got a reason that we live in a bubble
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:02.040]  everything is at prison everything is getting us into
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.320]  into cages like chickens or something in a factory farm
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:09.800]  that's the whole goal of this system
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:14.280]  feds order school to ban packed lunches without doctor's note
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.280]  we live in a country where the federal government is going to say
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:22.040]  what you're going to eat who you're going to buy it from
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.640]  which is another insider giant scam it ties into the obama care
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.840]  it ties into all of it ladies and gentlemen where they tell your doctor
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.640]  what care they can give via a computer and if your doctor doesn't follow with
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.440]  that computer says they come in with a swat team
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:39.000]  and arrest them all over the country folks my dad was in health care management
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.920]  he retired early he had another five years ten years left
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:47.000]  hitting the top of his profession and he just said i can't do this anymore and
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.760]  has phased out 95 works one day a week in it now
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:54.600]  and is tying up loose ends and battling the legislature
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.280]  just because it's the right thing to do not even being paid to do it
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.440]  he's testifying the legislature in like a week the whole point is
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:07.400]  this is the type of stuff ladies and gentlemen that is going on okay
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:10.600]  and it's designed to make the doctors quit and leave it's designed to wreck the
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:15.640]  quality of care these are criminals ladies and gentlemen
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:19.320]  oh shot claim al sharpton was an fbi mole rat
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.800]  the smoking gun of course he was you're not allowed to call for the murder of
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:28.680]  people and the killing of people and and and riots and and and and
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:32.760]  everything if you're not of course he was tied in
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:37.400]  al sharpton the fbi and the mafia i mean what do you think ladies and gentlemen
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.880]  anyone who gets away with calling for violence
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:44.760]  is an fbi informant bare minimum we'll cover that report after i take your calls

[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:14.520]  this subject of obama care of the scam job

[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:51.560]  i wanted to go to this andrew napolitano clip with the judge
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:56.280]  telling it like it is about the fact that the head of cyber security who's
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:00.040]  been caught launching their own attacks as a false flag
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.880]  clapper when he said we don't spy on you now they admit they spy on you
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:10.760]  without warrants 100% illegal 100% evil not to protect you from terrorists
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:14.120]  the same criminals that run our government run al-qaeda
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:19.240]  worldwide on record from fantastical when i first exposed it
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:23.000]  to mount mainstream news let's go to this club
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.480]  does the nsa collect any type of data at all
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:31.960]  on millions or hundreds of millions of americans
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:40.200]  no sir it does not not wittingly there are cases where they could
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:46.200]  inadvertently perhaps collect but not not wittingly now why do you say he was
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:49.400]  lying there because the letter that he sent to congress to which he referred
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:53.000]  a few minutes ago which was dated march 28th and released yesterday
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.760]  admitted that they roam through the content of phone calls and the content
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.040]  of emails and the content of text messages
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:06.200]  without a warrant in direct contradiction to what he said to that
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:10.120]  senate committee that was senator widen interrogated senator widen
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:13.560]  knew that the answer was a lie at the time he gave it because senator widen
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:17.080]  had been briefed in secret and in private by director clapper and his staff
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.680]  he gave director clapper an opportunity to change his testimony
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:24.120]  publicly in writing or under oath and the director declined to do so
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:27.080]  yesterday when that letter was released he actually sent the letter
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.920]  last week he either directly or inadvertently
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:34.360]  acknowledged that that testimony that you just ran was a lie
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:38.600]  for that he should be prosecuted the government prosecuted roger clements for
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.280]  allegedly lying about the contents of his urine before a house committee and
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:45.720]  they're not going to prosecute this guy about allegedly lying
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.960]  over the most massive government orchestrated violation of the fourth
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.800]  amendment the history of the united states
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.760]  what are we supposed to do about this
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:02.200]  we have known for years now that they that they try emails that they troll our
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:06.200]  phone calls they have apparently that's the issue it is just
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:10.840]  criminally out in the open getting away with whatever they want
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:15.000]  and then you find out the government's involved in sex trafficking worldwide
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.880]  then you find out they're laundering almost all the drug money the whole drug
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:22.040]  war is to shut down any competition that isn't paying the big guys
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:27.320]  you find out our society is run by total criminals who want to end the family
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.320]  who want to incarcerate half the population basically
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.280]  they already had the largest prison population in the world
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:41.160]  bigger than china bigger than china russia and india combined ladies and
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:47.800]  gentlemen that's well over two
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:52.360]  and a half billion people there's there's there's seven and a half billion
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:57.880]  people in the world and the united states has more
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:01.960]  people with three hundred and fifteen million in prison
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:04.920]  our nation's three hundred and fifteen million people we have more people in
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:09.800]  prison than china russia india and a whole bunch
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:13.400]  other countries combined i've seen magazines break down the
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:17.400]  numbers we have the largest prison population
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:21.160]  we have the equivalent prison population of what you'd expect of a country
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:25.640]  that had two and a half billion people in it the united states is the world's
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:32.040]  leading jailer prisoners per one hundred thousand
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:35.400]  we're showing some numbers from 2008 it's actually much higher than that
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:41.560]  because a bunch of programs they don't categorize as prison
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:44.840]  and all these work release programs and the rest of it this is how they get your
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:48.600]  rights is they criminalize everything while letting the big banks
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:51.080]  launder the money while letting the big corporations
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:54.280]  commit any crimes they want while letting congress be exempt and
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:57.400]  insiders raid while they commit every crime you can imagine and now the
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:01.480]  government's gearing up for physical war with the american people
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:05.800]  in fact i saw a mainstream news article today it's here in one of my stacks
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:09.240]  i don't see it in front of me right now about how

[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:22.840]  thomas geverson said that all the evil men in tyrants need to flourish
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:27.560]  is that good men and women do nothing well let's stop doing nothing let's take
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.880]  action i want to go to your phone calls
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:33.560]  now ahead of some other important audio clips and video clips and
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:38.920]  news i want to break down here today we're going to get into some very
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:43.640]  important information on the economic front also with what's happening
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:49.480]  in the middle east as well as ukraine and some new information on good old
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:56.520]  al sharpton the smoking gun is saying that he was really a
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:01.800]  informant against the mafia and against other groups for the fbi
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.800]  i mean al sharpton has always been a bloated disgusting
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:13.000]  pig like uh just want to be tough guy thug i mean the guy is a complete joke
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:20.760]  he is a race pimp and just a complete fraud and again i'm not demonizing
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:23.000]  somebody for being an informant against the mob
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.120]  it's just so perfect that they're reporting this
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:31.960]  about him because i'll guarantee you he was reporting on black people
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:36.280]  i will guarantee you he wasn't allowed to pull the shenanigans he pulled
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:39.480]  and create the political diversions where he was acting like he was fighting the
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:45.160]  political establishment in new york without some serious backing
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:49.480]  because if i said the kind of things he said i'd be in jail
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:53.400]  i learned this a long time ago and i said halterner is an fbi informant
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:57.560]  bare minimum came out in federal court national security level
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:03.800]  clearance in an unnamed agency for the fbi did that stop them from putting him
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.840]  in jail for threatening federal judges and state judges
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:09.960]  when they were ready to destroy him they destroyed him
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:16.040]  because hackers got in to his email and showed that he was an fbi informant
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:20.760]  trying to stir up riots in the country so they could demonize
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:24.280]  libertarians and people let me tell you something
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:27.880]  if somebody attacks me every week on the radio
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:31.160]  and says i'm a fed and says i need to be dealt with and stuff
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:34.920]  and then also calls for violence against other people you can guarantee
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:41.480]  they're a fed ladies and gentlemen 100 cast sunstein style garbage
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.800]  mike in pennsylvania you're on the air welcome
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.880]  i'll exchange how are you i'm all right brother how may i serve you
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:53.480]  well i have a comment and i have a question for you i guess the first
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:59.720]  comment obamacare open your eyes i mean and this is for the people that are
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:04.040]  dumbed down don't understand anything don't want to take the time to look into
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:07.880]  anything people are lied to openly
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:11.960]  and they still they still just don't think
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.480]  wait you know maybe there's something more to this
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:20.840]  i try to uh talk to people you know to get them to look a little bit deeper
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:25.320]  but nobody wants to take the time and i gotta be honest with you
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:29.400]  these these things that they're putting in our food and our water
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:34.840]  are working and wow you know how do you it's
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:38.920]  it's very difficult to try to avoid these things nowadays
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:42.520]  you know um
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:48.200]  we try to do so much but in reality i think it's the
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:51.880]  smaller percentage of the world that's going to be the savior
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:55.720]  oh i agree with you and look it's never been a majority that changes things for
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:59.000]  the side of good or evil so we know that we've got to be a
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.360]  vocal animated minority that leads the rest of the sheep out of bondage
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:08.040]  that's what's going to have to happen i mean look at alsharpton
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:13.720]  report reverend was wired paid to snitch account of sharp and secret life
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:18.280]  as ci-17 based on hundreds of pages of confidential
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:23.480]  fpi affidavits and documents of course most of these black leaders including
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:26.520]  jesse jackson it came out were federal informants
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:30.120]  and of course jesse jackson was there to lead martin luther king out on the
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.120]  balcony and then to put out the official story
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:39.800]  i have a question for you if i could go ahead uh you plan on doing this calendar
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:43.720]  i think it's a great idea oh you'd like to see you'd like to see uh
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:49.080]  maca doing a bikini huh i'd like to see my wife in the bikini on the calendar
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:52.600]  well listen a lot of talk shows have put out
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:56.840]  calendars with women with guns and i'm all for it
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.800]  i'm not for putting one out with men on it i'm just going to be honest a little
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.560]  again i'm i'm discriminating here and being sarcastic the point is
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:07.320]  is that uh it is a good idea people have had the idea but i'd like to do with
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:11.640]  real women and then uh really shake up the feminist maybe
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:14.680]  maybe not have them in bikinis or something but maybe dressed up in
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:19.480]  dresses you know in the kitchen with the cherry pattern on the wallpaper
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:23.160]  but with maybe a little black scotty dog you're looking up at them lovingly
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:26.920]  holding say bear at 50 cows i think something tasteful
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:30.440]  within a little bit of second amendment lore and quotes about the second
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.760]  amendment on one side of it how does that sound
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:35.640]  would everybody like to hang out that calendar up
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:41.080]  do it do it only if my face isn't on it we can put my face on mac at his body
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:45.400]  how does that sound that's pretty nice you know that's that
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.840]  you don't need a bikini to make the women sexy with guns that's for sure
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:52.680]  that's right that's right all right you have a good taste
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:55.880]  all right all right no it's a great idea to promote the second amendment
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.040]  i just i got bigger fish to fry than chasing around
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:05.000]  you know the leads putting the ads out finding you know the the women to do it
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.200]  but i mean i've been to gun rallies and seen a lot of beautiful women so i was
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:11.240]  dead serious the other day they were have a skype feed and i said those are some
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:13.880]  lovely ladies that one right there could be in the calendar you know we have to
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:17.640]  actually get 12 women for this calendar you know and then i have to sit there
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:21.560]  and do the shoot and mess with it and it would raise some money for the
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:26.280]  operation and would help promote the second amendment so i don't know
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:29.400]  we got to get cracking on it if we are and i've got a film to finish that's
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:32.840]  behind i got the tv system to launch i i don't know if we're gonna have a
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:38.920]  calendar this year you know maybe maybe next year
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:43.400]  patrick in oregon patrick you're on the air go ahead
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:49.320]  alex can you hear me yes or go ahead oh hey hey uh alex i just wanted to share
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:54.040]  my story real quick uh i had a sports injury and i was
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:58.600]  faced with the decision to either walk or have a surgery again
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:03.880]  as it was off season of my seasonal job i uh decided to go ahead with the
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:07.720]  surgery i had saved up a bunch of money so i paid for all my
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:14.520]  cat scans x-rays doctor visits and cash and uh
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:19.400]  and anyway so as the the day before the surgery i go and i try to sign up i i
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.000]  don't actually try to sign up for obama okay they push it on me and they're
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.640]  like we'll pay for your surgery we'd pay for
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:29.560]  your pre-existing everything that you paid for and
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:34.520]  everything in the the future and who was they the hospital
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:39.000]  the hospital that i went to yeah yeah so so up until the day of my
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.320]  surgery i had paid for everything and i understand so tell us what happened
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:47.800]  so anyway i go through with the surgery and
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:53.720]  in order to to to get the benefits of obama care i had to give them
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:58.600]  all of my personal information my social security number they wanted to know
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:03.400]  what job i was gonna have when i was gonna start how much money i made how
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:07.400]  much money i had in the bank i was about to say because they do
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.560]  they're going to come after your wages later it's actually in the legislation
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.680]  they're going to call the money back just like in england but now the
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:17.640]  government gets it instead of the corporations and then they pass the
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:20.840]  money through to them so i i believe you were given a
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:24.840]  line of bull did you go to a city hospital
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:30.840]  um i went to a private hospital all right so how did this end
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:34.360]  so i went through with the surgery that came out fine
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:38.520]  um i'm gonna be capable of walking which is wonderful but you think i really
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:43.000]  have any that didn't anything to do with the obama care though because
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.840]  in order to get the benefits that i needed to
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:51.640]  have the surgery the obama care was just like a layer no i get it now they make
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:54.760]  you go through the federal government to get the charity care that was already
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.080]  there i appreciate your call yeah that's a big facet of it
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.280]  folks most hospitals even if they're private or charities
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.880]  they're tax exempt and they're supposed to give about a third or
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:07.640]  half depending on their charter of their care for free
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:10.920]  and then corporations donate money and things to pay for prosthesis or stuff
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:14.840]  like that then if you are sick then you can go
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:17.960]  get charity care obama care begins to phase that out
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:21.080]  but that's after they bankrupt the health care system
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:24.120]  then people think who are poor they're getting free health care because of
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:29.240]  obama care when they would have already gotten it
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:32.680]  and then one characteristic of it is it begins to phase out the actual free care
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:36.840]  you would have gotten no more knee surgery just here's the cane
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.960]  adam in iowa you're on the air go ahead adam
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:44.440]  yes sir can you hear me all right absolutely
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:48.600]  all right my wife currently got on the affordable
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:57.240]  care joke uh it works i can tell you that they actually do pay for things
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:03.400]  uh that did raise her premium double debt but see you're paying for it that's
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:06.680]  what i'm saying all it does is send you to select
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:10.280]  inside corporations who then jack up the price it's kicked
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:14.280]  10 million people off their health care i mean it's a total fraud
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:17.320]  yeah they canceled their old plan and we had to get on a new one
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:21.400]  through her employment and and it's gone up so so
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:24.520]  would you have done this before if you had a choice
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:28.120]  hell no sure but it didn't a great deal i mean
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:31.720]  ellen's generous says everyone quote loves it
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:35.400]  it's a great success we should all thank obama would you like to thank obama
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:41.800]  right now no thank you so where
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.120]  what are your other points on the subject well it raises your premium she's
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:49.080]  got a $2,500 deductible that has to be mapped
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:53.400]  before the insurance isn't going to go
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:58.280]  so if you go to a doctor you i mean you get the bill from the doctor
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:01.960]  and then i actually have a question for you also after we're done with obama
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:05.640]  carrier okay because i keep up with world events i keep
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:09.320]  up with the stock market i owned a gun shop
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:15.960]  and that's not good hey when i turned in my ffl my
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:20.600]  federal firearms license they took my 44 73s
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:24.120]  which i'm supposed to keep for 20 years as you know
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:28.760]  so if you think you haven't registered you're registered your gun you have
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:31.800]  that's right for those that don't know the yellow forms
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:34.920]  supposedly by law are supposed to be kept on site but not given to the
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.400]  government they've caught them over and over again
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:41.640]  most gun shops don't have them digitally it ends up going to the atf
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:44.600]  uh describe what happened when you went in to
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.200]  get rid of your ffl i guess and shut down your gun shop describe what
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:51.480]  happened well actually they came to my house
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:56.040]  so they came to your house and and the what the atf took the forms
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:00.760]  they took the forms my acquisitions dispositions book
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:06.360]  uh my ffl they took pretty much everything all the information on all
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:10.520]  the customers everything i want you to start over tell us
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:14.520]  the general area live in uh what type of gun dealer you were
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:18.200]  and explain the ffl and explain how big a deal this is because
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:22.040]  what the atf is doing is illegal but um
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:25.160]  they've been caught doing it over and over again i mean did you ask them at
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:27.880]  the time hey you're not supposed to do this
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:33.000]  well yeah okay we'll tell the story i mean i'm a well i was a pawn shop
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.680]  here in isle i'm in the central part of isle well pale i'm in bell plain isle
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:41.560]  i mean they're listening to my conversation anyway so you know they
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:46.360]  know where i'm at uh it was a little pawn shop down
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:50.200]  here that i accepted guns and then you know
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:54.440]  resold them and then you write it down the acquisitions and disposition book
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:58.440]  when you acquire the gun you write it down in the acquisitions part where you
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:01.800]  put it where you acquired it from in the
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:05.560]  dispositions you write down where the gun went
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:10.360]  okay to the person it went to not only took the acquisitions book and
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:15.240]  dispositions book and they took the form 44 73
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:19.880]  okay which i am supposed to keep for 20 years
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:24.200]  on site for 20 years i'm supposed to hold on to this form
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:27.480]  okay and that didn't happen they came to the house here when i called them and
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:31.400]  told them i was closing down turning in my federal firearms license
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:35.400]  but i was you know closing because of this crazy insurance ship
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:41.960]  they excuse my language they came and got 44 73 acquisitions and
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:45.800]  dispositions books so they have all the records of everybody that i ever
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:49.240]  sold again to and that is illegal they're not supposed to do that
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.440]  that's right the law says that they're never to save it or keep it
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:55.320]  they're allowed to go in for specific investigations
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:59.160]  with warrants and check on the specific form
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:03.720]  by the alphabet in your files and there have been major lawsuits they've been
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:06.120]  caught doing it there's been congressional investigations
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.560]  and i've been told by other gun dealers this has been in the news as well they
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:12.840]  come in and threaten them and say we're going to find
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:17.240]  some reason in a white glove inspection to basically indict you
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:21.720]  unless you just give us everybody's names and unless you violate the law
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:25.160]  and so that's a giant organized criminal conspiracy
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:29.960]  against the law just like the NSA is and against the people by this criminal
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:34.040]  government and your testimony is very important what we're going to do is
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:37.720]  we're going to take this clip from the show today and put it on the nightly
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:41.000]  news you know edit it down for time and then add news
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.760]  articles about the ATF caught keeping the digital databases caught using the
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:49.560]  databases this has been a big scandal and Larry
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.320]  Pratt may want to end up talking to you but we need gun dealers to be more
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:55.880]  honest about this did you say something to them
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:58.760]  i mean you said you did what did you say to them about wait a minute the law says
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:02.440]  i'm supposed to keep this describe that interaction
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:06.520]  i told him that i was supposed to hang on to it for 20 years
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:11.400]  for the tracking purposes of guns where you know they contact me if the gun has
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:14.920]  gone missing or something like this or used in a crime
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:18.600]  and he said we will handle the tracking from now on
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:23.160]  and that was pretty much the end of the conversation he took the box
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:27.880]  that was it right there i told him that i was supposed to keep him for 20 years
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:31.560]  apparently he does agree with me oh you never know they may come indict you
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:34.120]  later claiming you didn't keep the records i mean that's how criminal the
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:37.240]  ATF is they will take somebody who bought an
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:41.240]  m4 at a store that's semi-auto and then they will take the gun and
[01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:45.640]  mess with it and say they were able to fire it full auto and put you in jail
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:49.000]  doctors lawyers veterans the better a person you are
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.760]  the more they hate you they have a total criminal instinct
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:55.960]  i mean they bombed Oklahoma city for heaven's sakes
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.880]  when we know that the ATF people that were involved it's unbelievable
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:03.480]  and now they're doing everything uh digitally
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:10.120]  so i had to convert over to digital to where the form 4473 is now done online
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:15.720]  so and your acquisitions and dispositions is also done online so
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:19.560]  when they do this it's just automatically sent to them
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:22.680]  yeah the answer is get your guns in private sales folks
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:26.440]  um people say well nothing to hide they're coming for them i mean that they
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:29.400]  this is a larcenist group that conquered the country through crime
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:33.560]  they've built organized crime armies of paramilitary who are training for all

[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:20.680]  in there's an expert on suicides in the military
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:24.040]  i never finished my point when there was a ford hood shooting
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:28.440]  last week until last night all the flags were at half mass
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:32.120]  but when 22 veterans commit suicide every day
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:35.880]  there's nobody putting flags at half mass and they've got
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:40.040]  at least seven of those are active duty of the 22 is the average you can pull up
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:42.840]  the numbers so seven people on average every day
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:47.480]  commit suicide or active duty that's more than um died at ford hood three
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:52.840]  people died that weren't the shooter again the media tells you when to care
[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:58.200]  as Stalin said one man dies it's a tragedy 10 000 dies is statistic

[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:06.200]  thanks for holding you're calling in about obama care as well
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:10.680]  go ahead hey alex jones i've been listening to you for about like two years
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:15.480]  and what what i've noticed consistently is that like a lot of the things you say
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:20.120]  right like they come out and like fox rules like six to eight months later
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:24.520]  because like last week uh oh i didn't call him
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:27.560]  they basically just admitted that it doesn't really matter how many people
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:30.760]  sign up that it's all meant to blow the system to blow the
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:35.400]  engine up that all of it is a ruby like which is a criminal
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:39.000]  conspiracy and and again they say it publicly
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.280]  so people don't realize how criminal it is because they're worried they've done
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:45.560]  this they might get caught so they have a zikula manual and others go
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:49.320]  we plan to wreck the system we're taking over
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:53.400]  like it's a good thing i mean isn't that diabolical yes yes
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:56.760]  can i make another point yes sir related to obama care yes sir
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:01.480]  yeah you saw last week the the ceo mozilla
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:06.280]  had to resign over some controversy that he he donated a couple of thousand

[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:15.480]  seems to be the norm that now if you don't support gay marriage like
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:20.200]  you're persecuted we're no and see that's my issue is
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:24.280]  they're persecuting people and it's like a cult you've got to accept this

[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:31.640]  because they're for marriage even if you disagree with marriage because we're
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:34.680]  a man and a woman you should agree with people having their right

[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:45.480]  being made to resign because he gave some money to a defensive marriage group i
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:48.280]  mean this is like a new
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:51.880]  dark age or something with you know with the persecution or the inquisition
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:56.120]  that's going on and and it's never been a subject i've gotten into this whole
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:01:00.280]  you know gay straight thing um but i mean at a certain point
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:03.800]  we got to realize that the the gay mafia as it's been called rum of the
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:07.480]  democratic party basically attached to whole socialist
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:10.840]  globalist agenda to what they do and if you don't support that you're some type
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:14.360]  of bigot it's all about being a victim a victim and i'm sick of it what's your
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:18.440]  take on that oh no yeah that's my point i mean it's
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:22.120]  getting kind of scary because like you're persecuted with the vengeance is
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:26.680]  if you dare to say loudly that you're that you're against gay marriage and
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:31.560]  um should obama be impeached because he he was against gay marriage a couple
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:34.440]  of years ago should it be impeached for that that's a good point i saw an
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:38.360]  article saying that no no you're right it just shows how it's an all out push
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:41.880]  and it's not going to stop there they want to set the precedent to
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:45.400]  basically in europe arrest people uh that don't want to teach five
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:47.320]  year olds about this i appreciate your call
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:51.480]  people say oh well you know we're not going to be oppressed anymore well
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:57.240]  don't oppress me uh jessica in missouri thanks for holding her on the air
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:01.960]  thank you for having me you bet i just have i just have three um different
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:06.120]  comments that i want to bring up and i think the last one um no one's really
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:08.920]  talked about first of all i wanted to say that the
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:12.120]  comments that harry reid made are totally untrue
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:16.600]  my mother lost her insurance about the end of 2013
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:20.840]  it says no one has lost it and you don't know how to use a computer
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:25.080]  that is completely untrue my mother received a letter late 2013
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:29.720]  um saying that she was going to lose her health insurance through her job
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:34.120]  it's also doubled her premiums and she didn't get to keep her doctor either
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:37.960]  so it's not been affordable for her no sir
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:41.640]  not at all but it's called the affordable care act
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:45.720]  right but you know they like to propose bills or laws and they mean exactly the
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:48.840]  opposite no i agree i mean i'm being sarcastic exactly
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:55.480]  it is a total total hoax um my second point i wanted to bring up
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:03:01.480]  is also with obama care my son's father he was working full time at um a local
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:04.360]  movie theater i'm in st louis missouri and uh
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:08.040]  he also got his hours cut from full time about 45
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:13.960]  down to about 29 and he's lucky a lot of city people that are not official you
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:17.080]  know workers or contractors but we're really full-time employees
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:20.440]  is technically not they've been cut down to 20 or less
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:23.720]  martin springs i had a whole bunch of the uh life cards there last year coming
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:27.000]  to apologize so we thought you were wrong about obama care but
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.120]  we all got cut from 40 hours down to like 2025
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:35.960]  that's what i'm telling people it's so evil you are absolutely right
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:39.480]  and my last point that i wanted to bring up that i don't think anyone's talked
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:43.400]  about i am a single mother of three and i just had a baby
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:47.400]  um almost about two years ago and i received a letter from her
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:52.440]  insurance stating she was up for her 12 month shots now i didn't wake up until
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:57.560]  i'm only 27 so i didn't wake up until the government shut down it just blew my
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:01.880]  mind like how could a government that i grew up all my life thinking was
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:07.640]  you know how could they just shut down so i received a letter in the mail um
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:11.560]  a couple months ago stating that if i did not get my daughter
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:16.840]  her 12 month not her insurance would be cancelled and has been cancelled yeah
[02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:19.480]  well that's that's totally discriminatory you need to get a
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:22.920]  lawyer you just send them letters back or get somebody else
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:25.480]  we're looking for excuses to kick anybody off because they want you to
[02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:28.840]  re-up and it's more expensive it's a statutory issue
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:32.600]  but you have to tell them we have an exemption you can always find a doctor
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:35.000]  in your area they'll give you a medical exemption or we have a religious
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:39.240]  exemption we're not vaccinating and uh that's your choice
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:43.800]  and so it's a total fraud amazing send me a copy of that letter with the names
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:47.240]  whited out or blacked out because that's newsworthy
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:50.360]  insurance companies kicking people off who don't vaccinate
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:54.920]  amazing i wasn't aware of that i'm sure it's true i just need to see proof

[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:44.360]  extensive bio he's an md he's also practicing psychiatrists
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:48.520]  specializing in complex neuropsychiatric diagnosis
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:51.560]  he served as flight surgeon in vietnam i guess like ron paul
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:57.320]  and then chief resident in the psychiatry a unit at seattle virginia hospital
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:01.640]  or seattle va hospital he and he's lectured and testified
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:05.320]  you name it across the board on truce post traumatic stress disorder
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:10.680]  since 1969 he's got the new book out wounded minds understanding and solving
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:14.760]  the growing menace of post traumatic stress disorder
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:18.600]  and i'm no psychiatrist or psychologist but i just think that you know it
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:22.600]  becomes kind of a catchall term a post traumatic stress disorder
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:27.000]  and i've got a cousin who served 30 years in the u.s army non-commissioned
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.440]  officers as high as you can get as a non-commissioned officer basically
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:33.720]  and he's been at least 20 of those years in combat
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:38.840]  he just loves it he's addicted to it and uh you know special operations the
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:43.080]  whole nine yards 51 years old and of the
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:48.520]  30 years about to be 31 years well i i'm digressing
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:52.920]  some people can handle it there's no way i can handle it
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:56.120]  years of not knowing if your next steps in landmine or the next kid that walks
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:59.400]  by is going to throw a hand grenade at you or you shoot up a car it's full of
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:01.240]  kids and kids are flopping around with their
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:05.400]  intestines hanging out i mean this is something that the strongest
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:09.160]  men can't handle i knew a lot of world war two vets like
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:12.280]  my grandfathers i knew a lot of world war two vets i would go hunting with as a
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:15.160]  kid and they were all really nice guys but
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:19.240]  you know they didn't like violent movies and they didn't want and people
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:22.600]  didn't mess with them because they would snap
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:27.400]  and my grandfather my dad's dad did not like violence in movies
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:33.640]  and he'd been a boxer before statewide you know top boxer he'd been in a
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:36.440]  military academy when he was a kid because he got in
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:39.800]  so many fights he was a tough guy and he went to world war two folks and he
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:43.480]  didn't like violence because he's seen a bunch of it
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:47.320]  and it just shows how traumatic this is that was just a couple tours
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:51.560]  can you imagine some of these guys ten tours my cousin is a
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:55.480]  ridiculous example but but i digress dr john Liebert
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:59.240]  thank you so much for coming on you sent us a lot of really interesting points
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:03.080]  you'd like to go over we've got like six seven minutes till the break
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:05.960]  why don't you boil it all down for us and your great knowledge i mean you
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:09.080]  probably have more knowledge and almost any other psychiatrist out there
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:11.720]  looking at your bio i mean you've seen so much of this from
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:15.320]  on the ground to in the va what is going on
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:21.720]  what is causing record suicides well first of all thank you for having me
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:25.240]  on the program i i'm not sure what those bullet points were
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:30.840]  but uh you know i think what you mentioned before is
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:36.520]  is uh is certainly a major issue of the multiple deployments
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:40.360]  um you know we have you know probably
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:47.160]  well over a million returning soldiers and veterans who've had multiple
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:53.400]  tours of duty this is a real switch in this volunteer army from
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:58.600]  the vietnam draft where you went for one year
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:03.080]  with few exceptions um and you didn't have to go back
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:09.320]  so anybody could take anything for one year uh we had that wrong uh so we went
[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:15.560]  to this an all volunteer army and uh recurrent tours of duty
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:19.320]  uh the body burns out the mind burns out
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:22.840]  and unfortunately the weapons burn out too
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:27.640]  and i heard a marine psychiatrist in uniform
[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:33.400]  speak about this that you know his unit was being sent back for the fourth
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:38.840]  time and their weapons were not property properly functioning
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:42.680]  so the weapons burn out too they're not maintained so
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:46.520]  you know you know it just seems like you know
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:51.960]  this volunteer army is expendable because they volunteered
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:57.480]  expendable soldiers i mean i've studied us military history a bit as a
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:01.160]  novice i don't think i've ever thought of any period in any army
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:05.000]  even the roman centurions they let them go after 10 years
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.520]  i just can't believe that they're keeping people in this long and doing
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:12.600]  automatic re-ups and a lot of people don't have jobs to go back to or they're
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:15.800]  so traumatized i correct me if i'm wrong that a lot of them don't know
[02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:21.480]  anything but the military they're almost institutionalized like prisoners
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:27.320]  well uh they do hold them on basis and that is a suspicious aspect of what
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:31.560]  happened at fortwood um
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:36.360]  that guy probably should not have been kept in the military but then they run
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:39.400]  into the problem of how do we discharge them
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:44.200]  um and so they don't make the decision and
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:48.680]  i'm afraid this guy just got shipped down the road from el paso
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:53.480]  up the road to uh kelene texas well that was one of your points is is
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:57.240]  asked the question is forthood a dump site for problem soldiers and
[02:15:57.240 --> 02:16:01.160]  why was uh low pass center well that is a
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:05.080]  that is a you know like a key question i mean that's like
[02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:08.040]  you know looking for the malaysian airline or
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:13.080]  370 um you know don't look in the arctic ocean
[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:19.880]  look in the indian ocean um and um let's let's find out what was going on in
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:25.800]  at uh fort bliss uh this guy wasn't in fort hood very long and
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:28.760]  and i don't think they knew him very well
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:36.680]  um but they know him at at at fort bliss and el paso um and
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:40.360]  if he was under under this the assessment for post-traumatic stress
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:44.280]  disorder and and a traumatic brain injury
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:47.880]  why would they send him at this time did they did they
[02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:52.680]  he's a truck driver did they eat a truck driver at fort hood
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:57.880]  so i don't know but the the reason for that transfer um
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:03.160]  you know should be um explained just like it should have been explained what
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:06.920]  was the reason for the transfer of of major assign
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:10.440]  uh to fort hood i i i fear that they didn't know
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:13.640]  know very much about him when he got there
[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:18.680]  oh reportedly the cia didn't give the pentagon the reports congress reported
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:22.680]  a few years ago that for two years they were tracking a son
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:26.360]  talking to al-qaeda about things he was planning
[02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:30.360]  and it just looks like a whole process of passing the buck is going on
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:34.680]  uh with just all sorts of uh people that are disturbed
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:42.280]  uh unfortunately the the system is overwhelmed um and oftentimes at my
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:46.600]  experience um they just really don't know what to do
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:51.080]  with some of these problem people and um
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:56.280]  this was one of those problem people he didn't just
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:02.520]  he didn't just get refused to leave and get you know
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:06.760]  be owed at at at some low level human relations
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:09.720]  clerk well sure i mean look at how he was begging for help
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:12.920]  uh they're now having to admit all over the place and wasn't really getting it
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:16.440]  well it's worse than that they're not even they're not even
[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:19.880]  acknowledging that he was in combat and here's a facebook
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:26.440]  um posting um two years ago celebrating life it has been exactly one and
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:31.240]  year and two days since i left iraq seeing in fallujah the most
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:35.800]  brutal explosion i was left paralyzed and started the discussion over the radio
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:40.120]  i was only focused on breathing deeply so that i don't lose focus and continue
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:43.800]  the the mission were hours of agony waiting for an
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:46.520]  attack by the insurgency but we were able to
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:51.880]  exit fallujah all alive i was in vehicle number six the worst was that
[02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:56.360]  number number five was a diesel truck the perfect target and i was only
[02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:59.000]  thinking about getting back with my family
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.160]  you know you know this is a posting two years ago
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:07.560]  now was he lying it sounds pretty detailed to me
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:11.640]  but at the bottom it says you know general commander
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:15.560]  of the post said lopez did not experience
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:22.680]  direct combat in iraq that sounds to me like direct combat
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:25.640]  well they always want to act like anybody that goes off the deep end you know
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:30.760]  it was never a combat soldier because you know those guys are all angels
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:34.840]  look at sergeant bales killing the 18 people remember that
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:41.240]  i sure do that's in my book and um he was not fit for duty he had a half a
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:43.960]  foot um let's talk about him when we come
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:46.120]  back amazing book i want to get into the book

[02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:31.640]  are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had

[02:23:55.880 --> 02:24:09.960]  by patriot supply dot com slash alex
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:25.480]  dr john lebert is our guest a veteran working in the va
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:30.200]  in the psychiatry department heading it up in major hospitals
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:34.680]  and we were getting into the fact that all-time record suicides dwarfing any
[02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:37.640]  period ever outpacing combat deaths they had all
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:40.520]  these flags at half mass around the country for three dead
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:43.640]  four dead including the shooter which i guess is fine but
[02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:47.480]  what about the seven vets that are in the military that die every day
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:52.360]  of the 22 that are veterans 22 a day total seven of them was the average
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:56.280]  seen in and if that's accurate that are active duty
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:59.640]  where's the half mass for them i mean the half mass
[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:03.880]  would be every day so we were getting into sergeant bales for those that don't
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:07.320]  know about that sir tell people about that
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:11.800]  well sergeant bales um was had already
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:17.320]  served three tours um there were really no alleged problems other than the fact
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:21.880]  that uh he had a you know his foot amputated
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:24.920]  he was left with a half a foot which would have rendered him
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:31.240]  on the fitness for duty profile um unqualified for deployment uh he was
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:37.080]  not fit for duty just because of his foot he also had a head injury um
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:42.360]  in uh in a in a rock um he was in some of the fiercest combat in a
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:47.000]  rock and he also had a head injury um you know on
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.920]  basal and automobile accident um he apparently i had a diagnosis of
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:56.840]  post-traumatic stress disorder but that that's not clear
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:26:03.480]  um uh and you know i he was he was deployed
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:08.600]  against his wishes and he probably had more common sense than anybody who
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:12.680]  deployed him because he really i don't think he was fit for duty i'd like to
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:16.920]  see his fitness for duty profile i mean it's on his record
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:20.440]  well it's ridiculous he had he had a fake foot
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:24.040]  and that uh the day before he went and and and
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:26.920]  flipped out he said and remember who he was on all the drugs
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:30.200]  his buddy almost got killed and some other friends got killed in an ied
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:33.480]  attack he saw that happen if i'm going from memory here
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:36.760]  you've got the files there obviously in front of you and then they just keep
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:40.600]  deploying keep making him go out and he says look i don't want to go
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:44.360]  back out please and they they made him and then they put
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:47.800]  him on a bunch of medication how does the medication feed into this well i i
[02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:51.080]  don't know i don't think he was on psychotropic medication but there is a
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:55.800]  controversy about his being on an anti-malarial drug which has
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:59.640]  uh just inhibited people and caused violence of soldiers
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:02.440]  um i don't think that's ever been established
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:06.600]  um i don't believe he was on psychotropic medications
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:10.280]  uh he was apparently drinking uh but the point is
[02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:15.080]  that you know they they not only sent him they not only deployed him
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:19.400]  but they deployed him to what appeared to be a remote and rather dangerous
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:25.400]  um special forces outpost uh to protect the special forces
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:32.440]  um so it sounds to me like uh he was sent on on kind of a suicide mission
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:40.040]  um and uh yes uh you know he probably uh had
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:46.360]  lost enough of his buddies and uh these iEDs are are just absolutely so
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:51.320]  dangerous and so devastating uh he probably just uh
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:57.400]  yeah he had one too many of those and buried one too many of his friends and
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:02.600]  um he went off and tell you the truth i don't think he
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:06.120]  ever planned to come back to the united states i think he was probably
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:10.360]  suicidal about speculation uh the way he was behaving and
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:15.880]  when they say he doesn't remember um i tend to believe him although i did not
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:19.960]  examine him but instead we put him in
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:22.920]  prison i'm not saying what he did was good it was horrible but
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:26.360]  how do you expect a man through this stuff and not expect
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:34.840]  a large percentage of them to blow uh well it that that of course is the
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:39.640]  the important question and i don't think that uh it's being addressed
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:43.240]  at the levels uh where it should be addressed um i don't
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:47.320]  i don't believe uh that uh you know just
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:51.240]  running this volunteer army over and over and over again
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:54.200]  in order to solve the problems of the vietnam draft
[02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:57.880]  is the solution i think the vietnam draft is a failure i think this all
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:02.440]  volunteer army is a failure uh it's not the soldiers it's not the
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:05.720]  units you know the vietnam army was one of the
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:09.320]  best ever fielded and they just got thrown into the garbage can
[02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:15.960]  um this army uh is an excellent army um it's also going to probably be trash
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:21.320]  too as they downsize i don't think the policy is i don't
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:25.960]  think the policy is right i think we should the draft didn't work
[02:29:25.960 --> 02:29:29.960]  the volunteer army didn't work i think we need to go to
[02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:34.280]  universal military service everybody graduates from high school
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:38.680]  uh goes into the military dr lebert stay right there i want to come back in
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:42.760]  and hear more of your solutions and uh you know uh debate back and forth the
[02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:47.400]  pros and cons of universal service or a new draft of course you know all the
[02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:53.000]  congressional kids are going to be exempt we're on the march the empires on the

[02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:13.240]  the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five
[02:31:13.240 --> 02:31:16.360]  times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:20.760]  and most americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:25.000]  within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:29.080]  well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions
[02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:32.440]  and don't forget the fact that six million americans live with pets they're
[02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:35.960]  allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics it was clear
[02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:40.760]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic
[02:31:40.760 --> 02:31:43.880]  environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against

[02:32:07.640 --> 02:32:11.320]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the american people
[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:15.160]  so why are the social engineers adding it to the water
[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:18.600]  symbol dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[02:32:18.600 --> 02:32:22.040]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get
[02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:26.120]  fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies

[02:33:22.360 --> 02:33:26.120]  empires have always had a problem after big wars what do they do with all the
[02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:30.200]  veterans it's generally veterans at the end of world war one world war two you
[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:33.320]  name it that stir up trouble it was the veterans that
[02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:37.960]  mainly pushed for the civil rights reforms at the end of world war two
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:41.400]  we're supposed to be the good guys what's going on here
[02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:45.240]  and i'm oversimplifying it but there is social engineering going on sergeant
[02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:48.920]  biggs who does reporting for us time to time is going to be a full-time
[02:33:48.920 --> 02:33:54.040]  reporter with us soon he was in four tours of combat duty
[02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:57.400]  i've been surfing with him and seeing with a shirt off bullet holes
[02:33:57.400 --> 02:34:02.600]  all over him shrapnel wounds all over his head
[02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:07.320]  of course he's the guy that exposed the fact that they probably whacked hastings
[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:10.920]  there with the rolling stones magazine but
[02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:15.400]  he said that they were giving them on their duty in afghanistan
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:18.760]  opiates and ordering them to take them they'd have the russians come in with
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:23.560]  the helicopters and just deliver just just tons of it to the troops as a way
[02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:27.560]  to to addict them a way to control them and i talked to other troops and they
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:31.160]  give them speed they give them all sorts of amnesics they give special
[02:34:31.160 --> 02:34:34.760]  forces amnesics in these tests read about that in the
[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:37.960]  marshal plan that was the name of the article in wire magazine about the army
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:42.200]  futurist now i'm throwing this out at
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:49.080]  psychiatrist md dr john lebert who served and headed up a major
[02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:51.560]  seattle vas and other facilities and written the book
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:54.840]  wounded minds i totally agree with him on the points he's
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:35:00.360]  raising so far as for universal service it's kind of like the death penalty
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:03.400]  you know i'm for the death penalty but i don't trust our government to implement
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:07.000]  it it's the same thing with universal service i mean i don't want my kids
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:11.880]  in all these big giant wars endlessly and of course i see how they treat troops
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:16.280]  no matter what like garbage remember asking my dad when i was a kid
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:19.000]  why they have atomic soldiers aren't monkeys cheaper
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:23.400]  he said no son when i was working in md anderson i asked him that same question
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:26.520]  and they said animals are cheaper than humans
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:30.200]  and so there is this attitude by the technocracy and people like you know
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:34.520]  john i think he's probably a good guy so people that are nice and have good
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:37.880]  intentions they compartmentalize i'm not saying he's naive he's been
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:42.200]  doing with this for 40 years or more you know i think there is a predatory
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:46.360]  attitude period against veterans so i don't know about universal service
[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:50.920]  comment on that and then you can hear my more what you might call paranoid rants
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:53.640]  uh you know about i'm sure you heard the fluoride ad you know
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:56.760]  doctored about about fluoride as a social tool
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:00.440]  i have eco science written by the current white house science are
[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:03.640]  where they talk about social engineering us uh with
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:07.240]  sterilants in the water and behavioral modifiers that are not proposing
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:10.680]  lithium in the water in japan because of increased suicide over there
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:14.040]  instead of addressing the cultural situation i know that's a long just
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:18.840]  stalt introducing you but what do you say all that
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:24.760]  i believe that um uh and in my book i make a very strong point of this uh
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:32.040]  that uh in that everybody who uh
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:40.040]  graduates from high school um goes into the the military or goes to jail
[02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:47.320]  and um everybody uh goes into the military with a high school degree
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:53.400]  or goes to jail um and in there are no deferments other
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:57.560]  than conscientious objectors but they don't get off the hook because
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:01.640]  um they have to do something else they have to be firemen
[02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:05.880]  for two years or go with a p-score or do do something else
[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:09.160]  but there are no there are no deferments except for
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:13.000]  you know very extreme issues such as
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:20.040]  severe extreme juvenile delinquency or severe medical disability
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:23.240]  this is nothing new this is what eisenhower said
[02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:29.160]  in 1966 when he was complaining about how unfair the draft is
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:33.000]  the all volunteer army is also discriminatory too
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:37.720]  in a different way because it selects from
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:41.400]  more rural areas where kids are dead and it and uh
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:45.880]  offers them an opportunity to you know get out of dodge and
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:50.120]  and and get get a life yeah it's targeting poor people
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:55.560]  it is but it's a different class of poor people than than the vietnam draft
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:01.160]  um you know which was mostly interstate because these are a lot of these kids
[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:04.280]  are you know young people are from you know
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:07.960]  while some of them aren't even americans um i saw i saw
[02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:13.240]  Jamaicans and you know they're this individual was from portorico
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:16.280]  of course that's a national u.s territory but
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:19.960]  um now some of the biggest recruiting centers are like mexico's city now
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:24.520]  yeah i would be surprised but in any case and answer your question
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:27.720]  you know what would be the ramifications of that
[02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:33.640]  um i think if if we had a universal military
[02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:39.800]  service and everybody was in uh there would be more transparency
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:43.240]  we wouldn't have the kinds of you know managed news and
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:49.720]  you know kind of uh sequit uh official sequestration of the facts in this
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:54.120]  matter that oh this was just a little incident between a guy and the guy went
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:57.080]  off um you know we're i mean who's going to
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:02.040]  believe that i hope not too many people but in any case
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:06.200]  you know i i think that that you know if everybody's in
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:09.720]  we're going to have less of this kind of thing and
[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:13.640]  you know it's not going to be that easy you know to ship
[02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:19.080]  500 000 people off to you know to asia no i agree with you that the fact that
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:22.520]  it's all volunteer allows them to abuse these people
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:26.840]  and then nobody has skin in the game so it actually contributes to more wars
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:30.440]  because we just ship off all the rural conservative kids to die
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:34.600]  if the form is you know we got we got our we got our
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:39.800]  we got a foreign legion here you're right what percentage of it is not even
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:43.720]  u.s citizens well i saw a number of up to a high percentage
[02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:50.120]  but they're they're there i saw them and uh they're there and uh these are
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:53.480]  these are mercenaries it's not in a large percentage but
[02:39:53.480 --> 02:39:58.520]  you know we do have like the makings of a foreign legion and i just happened to
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:02.680]  be in i i happened to have arrived in france
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:07.160]  when de Gaulle signed that algerian peace treaty and
[02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:11.160]  there were john darms on every corner waiting for the
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:15.560]  foreign legion to come in and and do a parachute drop on paris
[02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:18.760]  and take it over they were so they were so betrayed
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:22.200]  weren't they involved hiring a jackal to try to kill de Gaulle
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:26.120]  i don't i wouldn't doubt it but i'll tell you that it was
[02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:30.120]  i had no idea what was going on i was just a tourist and i arrived there and i
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:34.680]  was i was just kind of dumbfounded at what was going on but
[02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:37.960]  they were up they were really afraid that their own army
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:41.640]  was going to come at them well that's because they had they had with the have
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:44.920]  you seen the movie the jackal it's it's an accurate history of what happened they
[02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:47.960]  have the uh the one attempt by the french foreign
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:51.880]  legion to kill de gaulle and then they send in the jackal but he gets killed
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:55.720]  that's actually a that's actually a true story pretty amazing
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:40:59.720]  of the types of things that go on there again governments fearing veterans
[02:40:59.720 --> 02:41:03.560]  look at the french and indian war that's who the the the british regular
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:07.400]  started a fight with the veterans back in 1775
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:11.800]  have you seen this demonization in the news by homeland security saying
[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:16.760]  veterans of the number one threat uh for terrorism have you seen that
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:21.320]  i have i have not seen that um we we do know that
[02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:25.960]  uh gangs have either been created in the military
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:31.160]  or have infiltrated the military to get military training and
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:35.080]  there have been some of them picked up and you know that that's an internal
[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:38.520]  threat doctor i'm not asking you to attack your profession but
[02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:41.960]  and obviously i know some people who've taken psychotropic and it's helped them
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:47.080]  but also know in so many cases i know people that's ruin their lives and the
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:50.680]  insert says can make you kill people can make you you know i mean you know
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:53.320]  better than i what's in the inserts of these things
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:57.400]  uh i mean drugs obviously have got to be central to this i get they're already
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:00.760]  screwed up but you give somebody these drugs that put them in a dreamlike
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:04.440]  state or or or sleeping pills that are really uh
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:08.440]  i guess hypnotics like the ambient we keep seeing it pop up as well
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:13.800]  i mean are there are do the drugs concern you the drugs concern me in that
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:20.440]  um we know uh that uh psychotropic psychotropic drugs
[02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:27.800]  um are inadequately um prescribed by most practitioners
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:32.040]  um and are a significant number of practitioners
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:38.520]  uh including psychiatrists so when they talk about this guy getting
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:42.840]  prescriptions having worked in the military you don't know how this guy
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:45.880]  got prescriptions they do have little baggies
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:50.760]  the medics have little baggies um you know in the combat zones and
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:55.480]  and it includes you know ambient and includes medications to help
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:43:04.440]  you know people sleep etc and yes this is a problem i don't think that
[02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:09.320]  that the psychotropic medications are prescribed as well as they should be
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:13.880]  because you know the the military does not have
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:16.920]  i mean there's a there's a portrait here
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:21.240]  that you know there are all these military psychiatrists at fort hood at
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:27.480]  fort blitz who were doing it i've worked in i worked in an outpatient clinic
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:30.760]  um and one of the largest military facilities in
[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:37.480]  in the world in 2008 there wasn't one military psychiatrist in that clinic
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:41.720]  um they were on they they were on the grounds but them
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:45.960]  they weren't in the clinic i was about to say in the 50s and 60s
[02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:49.160]  i was reading the ratios there was a lot more of them it seems like now the
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:53.240]  military particularly just wants to ignore that all this is going on
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:57.720]  well sure they do because you know they they don't have the
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:02.760]  they don't have the personnel to deal with it um now i guarantee you that all
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:06.360]  of us in psychiatry are going to start getting emails
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:10.600]  um you know to to to go to fort hood uh
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:14.360]  you know the pay is pretty good you know and be a psychiatrist there on a
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:17.640]  temporary basis and all that kind of thing you know and
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:21.560]  um you know one of these facilities you know they
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:25.480]  what's called the quotes the behavioral health clinic's quotes
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:30.680]  um you know that if there's a psychiatrist there
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:37.000]  um you know it's it's probably you know kind of unique either
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:42.360]  you know like physicians assistants uh nurse practitioners sure sure and
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:44.360]  they're the ones handing out the pills don't know what they're doing
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:48.840]  doctor you know i we don't know we we don't know if this guy ever saw a
[02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:51.960]  psychiatrist well they also said he had a brain injury
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:55.960]  but then they want to just deny that look final question here
[02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:59.880]  he had a neurological evaluation or he should have had one
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:05.960]  and according to his posting on facebook he was in a blast injury
[02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:09.480]  let me ask you this final question and folks can read the book Wounded Minds
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:15.160]  by dr john Liebert where do you think it's all going to end in your gut
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:19.480]  they're not going to do the national uh you know conscription or whatever
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:23.480]  or national service for a long time and again i wouldn't be against that
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:26.600]  except for who's running it i mean rama manual was for that for having sex
[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:29.400]  folks um that's not coming for a long time
[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:33.160]  have ever what do you expect to happen then as they
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:37.800]  have a aging military where there's like people in there that are 65 in combat
[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:41.320]  guys with legs blown off to the knee with prosthesis still fighting
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:47.400]  i mean this is this is like a joke uh if it wasn't real
[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:53.880]  well i i i go back to what kelvin coolidge president kelvin coolidge
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:46:00.360]  that um the nation that forgets its defenders itself will be forgotten
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:05.960]  and i think we're on that track and hidden off of it
[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:08.840]  well thank you hopefully we can get you to pop in on subjects from time to time
[02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:11.560]  thank you doctor thank you very interesting
[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:13.960]  interview folks i think he's a well-meaning guy has a lot of great
[02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:18.600]  points i don't know if i agree with um
[02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:21.800]  national compulsory service because it's all going to be
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:26.360]  socialist but you look at how screwed up kids are and how disconnected from
[02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:28.520]  reality sometimes they're going to be good for them but
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:32.200]  you just can't it's slavery it's you can't trust the state
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:35.320]  it's just too corrupt you can't have it the answer is not to have all these
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:39.720]  wars i get where the doctor's coming from
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:43.320]  that you will have less wars if everybody's kids are in it but you know
[02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:46.200]  all the politicians their kids are going to be in the
[02:46:46.200 --> 02:46:50.440]  air national guard their kids are not going to be out there in the combat
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:54.280]  and it's got to end ladies and gentlemen and it is going to end
[02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:58.280]  let me answer my question for him they're rolling out with autonomous drones
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:01.720]  land air sea ground
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:05.720]  and by land you're gonna have cars you're gonna have ground trips
[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:09.400]  you're gonna have land vehicles that are robots basically it's like a ford truck
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:15.800]  souped up like a ford raptor with uh missiles machine guns
[02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:19.960]  hand grenades whole nine yards that's a robot we think of robots as robbie the
[02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:23.400]  robot coming to kill you no an 18-wheeler pulls up at your house
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:27.000]  and 10 combat robots roll out the back with
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:31.880]  drones above to give them a bird's eye view and they come in your house and
[02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:34.920]  they kill you and that's what they've got right
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:37.560]  now they the robots they show you on tv are nothing
[02:47:37.560 --> 02:47:42.680]  ladies and gentlemen they had robots 15 years ago more
[02:47:42.680 --> 02:47:46.040]  advanced than we see on the niche that's highly classified
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:48.840]  like i told you back then they have autonomous drones they just told you
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:51.480]  last year that they've been operating for a long time
[02:47:51.480 --> 02:47:55.400]  they make the decisions ladies and gentlemen that's their answer
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:59.240]  to humans breaking down and not wanting to carry out immoral operations
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:02.440]  all right sandy sherry and others thanks for holding sorry i had to hold a while
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:05.800]  we ran into that guest uh being on from when you called in
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:10.280]  sandy you're on the air go ahead thank you yes calling about obama care
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:15.880]  yes ma'am okay um i have two short hospital wars stories for you and a
[02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:18.280]  question if that's all right now go ahead
[02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:21.640]  okay a friend of mine's mother got ill she was in her
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:25.240]  like 77 years old this was about a month ago
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:28.600]  she went into the hospital she was having kidney problems
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:32.520]  they kept her in there for a couple weeks she finally died
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:36.920]  well when the family talked to her afterwards they told her that dialysis
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:40.680]  could have saved her life but she wasn't qualified for
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:44.440]  uh no that's right that's right they're they're cutting almost all the life
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:47.400]  saving events most of the time if people you know
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:50.360]  are having kidney failure i learned about this with my uncle it comes back a
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:52.120]  lot of people in the hospital who are sick
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:55.080]  on all these drugs the kidneys fail but a lot of times they come back
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:58.600]  they will now just not do the dialysis and not even tell the family if you
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:01.960]  don't ask the questions and they will kill you
[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:06.040]  well that's what happened and another friend of mine uh she pulled she tore a
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:10.040]  ligament underneath she couldn't even walk i took her to the hospital in
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:13.800]  greensburg pennsylvania westmoreland hospital i took her up
[02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:17.080]  there there were no doctors to be found all there were were
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:22.120]  PAs and nurse practitioners when they asked where a doctor was they said
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:26.280]  doctors are only called in case of emergency well they gave her a crutch
[02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:29.320]  she's hobbling around on a crutch with a torn ligament
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:34.760]  she still has to have an MRI which i know is going to lead to surgery
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:38.680]  and god knows how long that'll take the hospitals that have fully rolled over
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:42.760]  to obama care now a computer tells the doctor what to do
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:46.200]  they're and real doctors just will not follow this they're getting rid of them
[02:49:46.200 --> 02:49:48.520]  they're going to have a nurse practitioner in there
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:52.200]  that's why you hear there's a nurse shortage a nurse practitioner basically
[02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:55.640]  is a doctor who isn't a doctor i'm not knocking nurse practitioners are a
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:59.080]  lot of great ones out there who do know as much as the doctors are more
[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:02.280]  the fact is they're just downgrading our health care
[02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:06.280]  uh now my question is this why can't we as a nation
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:11.160]  have a massive recall and call all these guys back before the elections
[02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:14.280]  i agree we have to have the will because the republican leadership is in bed with
[02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:17.880]  the democrats on obama care and everything else that's the problem
[02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:23.560]  i bless you we're going to go to break uh you had one other point

[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:20.440]  like eight percent or seven percent last time i checked private land
[02:55:20.440 --> 02:55:24.600]  and and now there's people that own houses and property in the middle of
[02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:27.560]  national parks everywhere and and outside areas

[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:22.280]  the air
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:25.800]  hi just before i begin about obama care
[02:56:25.800 --> 02:56:30.280]  just because your union does not mean that you vote democrat
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:33.080]  um but i know it just means that they take your dues
[02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:37.640]  and give it to the democrats right well let me just say
[02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:41.240]  uh what blue cross and blue shield defines as
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:46.920]  medical necessity and the plan only pays for services that are
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:51.720]  medically necessary which are defined as a service or supply
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:56:55.480]  essential to an eligible person's health that is
[02:56:55.480 --> 02:56:59.240]  appropriate and necessary consistent with
[02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:04.200]  acceptable medical practices according to the medical policy
[02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:08.120]  established by the national blue cross and blue shield
[02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:11.480]  association that's right that's the bioethics board that basically decides
[02:57:11.480 --> 02:57:14.680]  the rationing and blue cross blue shield the biggest insurance company in the
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:17.720]  world tied in with warren buffett and everybody else
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:21.080]  they helped write obama care as a giant rape
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:24.680]  and the democrats think oh we're getting a free goodie no you're not go ahead
[02:57:24.680 --> 02:57:28.600]  well let me finish this definition not primarily
[02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:32.280]  for the convenience of the eligible person his family
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:38.600]  physician or other provider consistent with attaining reasonably achievable
[02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:42.760]  outcomes and reasonably calculated to result in the
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:49.720]  improvement of the cover person's psychological or physiological benefit
[02:57:49.720 --> 02:57:53.880]  the fact that a physician prescribed services
[02:57:53.880 --> 02:57:59.560]  or supplies does not automatically mean the services or supplies are medically
[02:57:59.560 --> 02:58:03.960]  necessary no no no no no no obama care was written by the insurance companies
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:07.720]  amongst other things but chiefly to make you buy it
[02:58:07.720 --> 02:58:11.080]  and then to let them cut the quality of care
[02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:16.680]  let me say that our plan changed as of january 1st of 2012
[02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:19.960]  everybody's complaining about what happened this year
[02:58:19.960 --> 02:58:24.920]  our plan changed two years yes ma'am that's when they passed obama care
[02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:28.440]  even before it was quote implemented into the general public two years ago
[02:58:28.440 --> 02:58:31.800]  they began the screw job it's a phased-in screw job
[02:58:31.800 --> 02:58:35.080]  so people don't know what's hitting them and the media sits around going
[02:58:35.080 --> 02:58:37.720]  we don't know what's going on we don't know what's going on
[02:58:37.720 --> 02:58:41.960]  we're the republicans we don't know we don't like it but we can't repeal it
[02:58:41.960 --> 02:58:46.680]  uh because the lobby has paid them off great points great calls cherry
