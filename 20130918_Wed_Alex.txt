[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:34.680]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:34.680 --> 00:38.920]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this live worldwide
[00:38.920 --> 00:45.880]  transmission it is wednesday the 18th day of september 2013 and congressman
[00:45.880 --> 00:51.720]  walter jones will be joining us coming up in the middle of the second hour to
[00:51.720 --> 00:57.640]  talk about impeachment proceedings against barack hussein obama presiding a
[00:57.640 --> 01:03.800]  executive order claiming that he can circumnavigate federal law and arm al-
[01:03.800 --> 01:08.720]  qaeda terrorists you heard me ride obama waves ban on arming terrorists to
[01:08.720 --> 01:14.200]  allow aid to syrian opposition that is some of the news we're going to be
[01:14.200 --> 01:21.040]  breaking down on that front also syria hands rush approved on russian for
[01:21.040 --> 01:26.040]  russian inspectors on rebel use of chemical weapons we're going to be
[01:26.040 --> 01:33.320]  getting into that as well today and obviously the latest developments on the
[01:33.320 --> 01:39.280]  supposed shooter there at the naval yard several days ago that killed 13 people
[01:39.280 --> 01:43.320]  including himself and he died when police shot him it's now coming out via
[01:43.320 --> 01:47.720]  cns news and indeed the marines had weapons but that they were not allowed
[01:47.720 --> 01:52.920]  to have ammo or they could have taken him out so it's like most bases where the
[01:52.920 --> 02:00.040]  general population of the base is disarmed making it a disarmed fish in a
[02:00.040 --> 02:04.600]  barrel victim disarmament zone like the public schools colleges and other
[02:04.600 --> 02:08.120]  facilities and now they're saying it didn't matter that he heard voices and
[02:08.120 --> 02:12.640]  had called the police saying that the government was after him either he's
[02:12.640 --> 02:16.120]  schizophrenic or he was under mind control mind control is real has happened
[02:16.120 --> 02:20.080]  before so this this could be mind control but most likely is schizophrenia
[02:20.080 --> 02:25.040]  that's more common than mind control in the body of research we've done but the
[02:25.040 --> 02:31.920]  issue here is he still kept a top secret security clearance to work for the
[02:31.920 --> 02:38.280]  marines in clandestine weapons systems he still kept that even though he'd shot
[02:38.280 --> 02:42.200]  up tires on a vehicle shot through the wall of his neighbor threatening them
[02:42.200 --> 02:48.120]  reportedly called police repeatedly in hotels saying microwaves were being used
[02:48.120 --> 02:54.760]  on him I mean he was either under some kind of MK ultra program or he was stark
[02:54.760 --> 02:59.720]  raving mad and now the media is like oh no he was under government psychiatric
[02:59.720 --> 03:04.720]  care and taking drugs we won't say which ones but it doesn't matter and he played
[03:04.720 --> 03:08.200]  now it's 18 hours a day of call of duty but oh that has nothing to do with it
[03:08.200 --> 03:13.280]  no no it's gun owners and Obama has come out saying he's pressuring Congress to
[03:13.280 --> 03:18.880]  pass bans on private sales of guns and registries and harassment all the rest
[03:18.880 --> 03:25.400]  of it an expansion of the ATF because a double layer of security was penetrated
[03:25.400 --> 03:31.800]  legally in a gun-free zone and one of their people went haywired and killed
[03:31.800 --> 03:37.520]  folks so now we're guilty in fact I have a article here in my stack where a
[03:37.520 --> 03:42.400]  famous preacher Rick Warren we're gonna play this clip coming up and David
[03:42.400 --> 03:48.600]  Knight's doing a special report on it Rick Warren came out and on Piers Morgan the red
[03:48.600 --> 03:52.880]  coat is all for government having guns that we shouldn't be able to and said
[03:52.880 --> 03:59.440]  he forgives whoever sold his son a gun that his son killed himself with so I
[03:59.440 --> 04:02.400]  guess if somebody goes to the store and buys razor blades and slits their wrist
[04:02.400 --> 04:06.840]  the store should apologize maybe Rick Warren will forgive them or if somebody
[04:06.840 --> 04:12.800]  goes in the garage with a Ford car and gasses themselves with carbon monoxide
[04:12.800 --> 04:17.440]  does Ford need to apologize for that or if somebody runs over your family member
[04:17.440 --> 04:21.720]  with a car is it should Chevy apologize if say somebody runs over you with a
[04:21.720 --> 04:29.040]  Corvette in a parking lot or if someone goes into a Sears robux store and buys
[04:29.040 --> 04:32.120]  a butcher knife and walks out in the parking lot and stabs someone in the
[04:32.120 --> 04:37.280]  throat the Sears need to apologize or about the manufacturer the smelter of
[04:37.280 --> 04:42.720]  the blade well I mean we know they punished all the rodeo clowns without
[04:42.720 --> 04:46.640]  any sensitivity training and pay for it because one guy made fun of our lord and
[04:46.640 --> 04:54.640]  savior Barack Obama to quote Jamie Foxx they quoted again Barack Obama
[04:54.640 --> 05:01.720]  if anybody criticizes him we all need to be executed why does the United States
[05:01.720 --> 05:05.880]  spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care why do we have
[05:05.880 --> 05:11.240]  the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism and

[08:23.200 --> 08:27.640]  resistance it's alex jones
[08:34.640 --> 08:41.680]  ladies and gentlemen president obama has come out in a press conference and
[08:41.680 --> 08:46.720]  blamed the american gun owners for the tragedy two days ago at the highly
[08:46.720 --> 08:54.240]  secure gun-free navy yard in washington dc what our callers at military bases
[08:54.240 --> 08:59.760]  first reported has been confirmed that base and others only allowed mp's to
[08:59.760 --> 09:08.680]  have bullets in their firearms now there were large marine corps facilities at
[09:08.680 --> 09:13.520]  the base with full armories but no one was allowed to have bullets on the base
[09:13.520 --> 09:19.520]  with the firearms no one was allowed to have the cartridges and so this was
[09:19.520 --> 09:25.560]  allowed to continue on for some time until the police finally got there 45
[09:25.560 --> 09:30.560]  minutes later and finally took this guy out which is actually a quick response
[09:30.560 --> 09:36.200]  compared to a lot of other mass shootings we've seen like Columbine it
[09:36.200 --> 09:40.480]  was over four hours and we've seen other events where it's been over two and a
[09:40.480 --> 09:45.200]  half hours while everybody puts on their black uniforms their armor stands
[09:45.200 --> 09:51.000]  around and generally the shooter is already committed suicide but that
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.160]  reportedly is not the case here and there's been a lot of new developments on
[09:55.160 --> 09:59.160]  this front we're going to go over it and then I'm going to open the phones up
[09:59.160 --> 10:08.200]  today for victims of Zoloft and Louvox and the I don't know 50 plus popular
[10:08.200 --> 10:13.240]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other psychotropics that people are taking
[10:13.240 --> 10:17.000]  because this morning I was reading on info wars.com in a story that's linked
[10:17.000 --> 10:24.680]  up on drudgereport.com dealing with the fact that the reported Navy yard
[10:24.680 --> 10:31.040]  shooter was under psychiatric care and on psychotropic drugs and the media has
[10:31.040 --> 10:37.480]  now buried the psychiatric drug connection to the Navy shooter despite
[10:37.480 --> 10:41.600]  with Harrison Clybold under psychiatric care obsessed with violent video games
[10:41.600 --> 10:47.240]  Adam Lanza under psychiatric care on drugs obsessed with violent video games
[10:47.240 --> 10:54.940]  on and on and on and on and on in in over 90% of the cases on psychotropic
[10:54.940 --> 10:58.520]  drugs obsessed with shoot them up violent video games and we're not saying
[10:58.520 --> 11:02.480]  if you play shoot them up video games I play them sometimes when I go out
[11:02.480 --> 11:07.280]  somewhere I'm not saying I play the hunting games with my kids and you know
[11:07.280 --> 11:09.600]  we're hunting the elk and stuff just because it is good for them to learn how
[11:09.600 --> 11:13.880]  to shoot outside of going out naturally shooting which they do as well the
[11:13.880 --> 11:17.640]  five-year-old's not shooting yet but she plays the hunting game obviously that's
[11:17.640 --> 11:20.480]  not gonna make my five-year-old want to go out and murder people but when you're
[11:20.480 --> 11:27.400]  already unstable you're already on drugs that the insert says may cause
[11:27.400 --> 11:35.000]  psychotic breaks suicide megalomania mass murder nymphomania and there's a
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.560]  bunch of them with women that just I mean that's well known that's that's on
[11:38.560 --> 11:42.320]  the books they give them to women that aren't who are married reportedly and
[11:42.320 --> 11:45.840]  aren't sexually excited or whatever getting your menopause that's one of
[11:45.840 --> 11:49.840]  the treatments is they give them these drugs it absolutely kills inhibition in
[11:49.840 --> 11:55.400]  shrimp and frogs and fish they've done studies fish will swim right up with no
[11:55.400 --> 11:58.400]  fear and grab the hook with the bait on it
[11:58.400 --> 12:02.440]  shrimp will swim right up to other fish and be eaten when they're on serotonin
[12:02.440 --> 12:06.880]  reuptake inhibitors and so much of it is put out to the sewage into the rivers
[12:06.880 --> 12:14.440]  that marine animals are committing suicide everywhere and by suicide they'll
[12:14.440 --> 12:19.600]  they'll just swim right up and be run over by boats it's a happening larger
[12:19.600 --> 12:27.040]  fish the the the side effects are absolutely mind-blowing and this is a
[12:27.040 --> 12:36.160]  fact so I want to open the phones to hear your take out there on what it is
[12:36.160 --> 12:41.560]  like for you because I mean I read about people that will wake up and kill
[12:41.560 --> 12:45.360]  their wife or kill their husband or kill their kids or people will wake up and
[12:45.360 --> 12:49.120]  see the grim reaper in front of their bed and they'll have full-on hallucinations
[12:49.120 --> 12:55.280]  or they'll think they're a superhero or I was talking to a Houston cop years ago
[12:55.280 --> 13:02.080]  they pull up to the upscale neighborhood there's a beautiful woman up on top the
[13:02.080 --> 13:06.360]  roof cutting herself with a butcher knife and and they knew right away once
[13:06.360 --> 13:10.280]  they got her down that when they went inside they find some type of serotonin
[13:10.280 --> 13:14.280]  reuptake inhibitor some type of prozac type drug and sure enough she was on
[13:14.280 --> 13:18.080]  those every time they pull up to a house and the woman's chopped the baby's arms
[13:18.080 --> 13:22.400]  off they know they're on it every time the woman grounds their four kids in the
[13:22.400 --> 13:25.720]  bathtub these are all Texas cases I'm mentioning they know what they're on and
[13:25.720 --> 13:31.720]  the grand juries will still indict the woman obviously whacked out of their
[13:31.720 --> 13:35.920]  gourd given to him by a doctor it's one thing if you take LSD and have a bad
[13:35.920 --> 13:40.760]  trip or PCP and go out and kill people then you could say well you took it it's
[13:40.760 --> 13:44.800]  your fault but still it was it premeditated murder it's not murder
[13:44.800 --> 13:49.940]  one so you only get 25 years in prison so the death penalty these people though
[13:49.940 --> 13:54.360]  these military troops like sergeant Bales who went out and killed you know
[13:54.360 --> 13:58.640]  the 16 17 people would burn their bodies for hours and go house to house doing it
[13:58.640 --> 14:02.880]  no one knew he was doing it snuck out of the facility to go out and kill people
[14:02.880 --> 14:07.720]  in the neighborhood he begged not to go back he'd been arrested repeatedly he'd
[14:07.720 --> 14:11.240]  been found in the woods with a gun in Oregon he'd been beating people up he'd
[14:11.240 --> 14:15.720]  had as part of his foot blown off had a prosthesis on it was begging not to go
[14:15.720 --> 14:21.920]  back flipping out on a whole bunch of psychotropic son record down and last
[14:21.920 --> 14:25.560]  time I heard he was in trial facing life in prison what happened with his court
[14:25.560 --> 14:31.560]  Marshall is his army trial look up sergeant Bales I want to remember a
[14:31.560 --> 14:37.200]  few months ago he was in facing trial and and his lawyers didn't even argue
[14:37.200 --> 14:40.680]  from what I saw in the news that he was under psychiatric care and I'm not
[14:40.680 --> 14:44.720]  saying it's okay he killed 16 people but you take a killing machine four
[14:44.720 --> 14:49.400]  tears of combat he saw his buddies blown up in an armored vehicle that day and
[14:49.400 --> 14:55.920]  one of his buddies killed and he flipped out ladies and gentlemen he blacked out
[14:55.920 --> 15:01.680]  Robert Bales or 1973 one year older than me
[15:01.680 --> 15:08.640]  when it up happening in his a trial a six-person jury sentenced him to life in
[15:08.640 --> 15:14.920]  prison without parole I mean you can't send it's him to life in prison the
[15:14.920 --> 15:22.920]  crime was putting him on those drugs yeah he was on peroxatine and that's the
[15:22.920 --> 15:26.160]  same stuff that they've been giving most the troops that's the new drug that's
[15:26.160 --> 15:29.560]  that that's what the Navy shooter who he knows under care and on drugs was
[15:29.560 --> 15:35.080]  probably on and what does it say it does new roses paranoid reaction any social
[15:35.080 --> 15:40.000]  reaction delusions drug dependence hysteria manic depression reaction
[15:40.000 --> 15:51.080]  psychotic depression and psychosis mania and you add all this up in 5% of it
[15:51.080 --> 15:56.640]  they have the depression 2% lack of emotion you add all these up though it's
[15:56.640 --> 16:01.000]  a good 15% chance you're gonna have one of these quote side effects of mania
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.960]  psychotic depression psychotic breaks euphoria I mean let me tell you folks I
[16:06.960 --> 16:11.040]  had a few girls I dated who were who who were on this stuff and it wasn't any
[16:11.040 --> 16:16.000]  fun because they were like crazy maniacs but they weren't real it was like well
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.600]  this I want a real person I don't want I mean maybe some guys are into that but
[16:20.600 --> 16:27.400]  I mean they were not alive folks they were like robots you know crazy robots who
[16:27.400 --> 16:32.320]  one minute would be you know taking their clothes off in public and the next
[16:32.320 --> 16:36.080]  minute would be telling you they want to kill you and I mean I found out real
[16:36.080 --> 16:41.200]  quick man what is this stuff you're taking what is this stuff you and it was
[16:41.200 --> 16:46.120]  always those type of drugs and and again if a woman chops her baby's arms off and
[16:46.120 --> 16:49.320]  she's been put on two or three of these drugs in some cases because what happens
[16:49.320 --> 16:53.000]  is they put you on one drug and then oh my gosh I'm having delusions I want to
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.080]  kill people oh that's because you need a second drug well now I just don't want
[16:57.080 --> 16:59.800]  to go out of the house I'm really paranoid well you know what they've got
[16:59.800 --> 17:04.080]  this new one you stack on top and then pretty you know the average foster child
[17:04.080 --> 17:08.320]  in America 69% of them look a look up national numbers are on psychotropic
[17:08.320 --> 17:11.800]  if you cry for mommy that's mental illness when they they put two-year-olds
[17:11.800 --> 17:15.680]  on these now you cry for mommy that's mental illness that'll make you shut up
[17:15.680 --> 17:23.880]  on average the 69% that are on them look it up 69% on it in foster care are on
[17:23.880 --> 17:29.000]  an average of seven psychotropic well then they got to go on anti-psychotics
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.280]  then they start having convulsions from all the drugs and so then they put them
[17:32.280 --> 17:40.360]  on anti-convulsion drugs by the way this is a Dallas Morning News Texas Monthly
[17:40.360 --> 17:43.440]  wrote about it for some reason Texas reported and I found the national
[17:43.440 --> 17:47.640]  numbers were pretty much the same because medical doctors that work for CPS
[17:47.640 --> 17:54.200]  went public first to W.O.A.I. TV and radio out of San Antonio to twin group and
[17:54.200 --> 17:58.400]  they said look we watch healthy five-year-olds that come to us and take
[17:58.400 --> 18:03.400]  from their parents are dead a year later and we won't be there they give them so
[18:03.400 --> 18:17.960]  many drugs folks it kills them it kills them K.I. double hockey sticks now Obama
[18:17.960 --> 18:24.920]  is out blaming the second amendment right now and again people in national
[18:24.920 --> 18:28.560]  studies that LA Times reported on believe that there's double the shootings
[18:28.560 --> 18:32.880]  in America in national surveys when there's actually a 49% drop in overall
[18:32.880 --> 18:37.920]  crime with guns people being shot wounded you name it mass shootings are
[18:37.920 --> 18:45.120]  actually less than 2% of overall shootings obviously and of those of
[18:45.120 --> 18:51.160]  overall gun crime the M4 type 2 to 3 is only used again in 2% of the crime
[18:51.160 --> 18:56.880]  these are all real numbers look them up but none of that matters because Pierce
[18:56.880 --> 19:03.440]  Morgan says you are collectively guilty and and and now they have Rick Warren
[19:03.440 --> 19:07.400]  the preacher we're gonna play this when we come back going on Pierce Morgan and
[19:07.400 --> 19:13.000]  saying he forgives whoever sold a gun to his son that committed suicide hey buddy
[19:13.000 --> 19:19.000]  don't blame us we're sad your son committed suicide but how dare you if
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.600]  somebody goes in a store and buys razor blades the store is not not their fault
[19:22.600 --> 19:26.400]  they slip their wrist if somebody buys a car and goes in parks in the garage and
[19:26.400 --> 19:29.960]  puts a water hose on it and pumps it into the car with carbon monoxide and
[19:29.960 --> 19:33.640]  kills themselves it's not Ford's fault it's not Chevy's fault it's not
[19:33.640 --> 19:37.080]  Mercedes fault if somebody buys a car and runs through a crowd of people and
[19:37.080 --> 19:42.880]  it's a Porsche it's not Porsche it's not Porsche's fault okay now I know that
[19:42.880 --> 19:46.800]  it's hard to understand but you want to guilt us all into this enough of your
[19:46.800 --> 19:52.080]  authoritarianism where somebody does something wrong or bad and then we
[19:52.080 --> 19:57.000]  collectively are blamed for it when it's you pushing mass murder suicide pills

[24:15.480 --> 24:21.160]  on info wars.com in the article titled media berries psychiatric drug
[24:21.160 --> 24:25.600]  connection to Navy shooter you can read some of the comments from people about
[24:25.600 --> 24:29.640]  the horrible experiences they've had on Paxil the horrible experiences they've
[24:29.640 --> 24:34.960]  had on Zoloft and I have personally you know seen the countless news stories in
[24:34.960 --> 24:39.240]  the press every time you hear about some senseless killing they're on these
[24:39.240 --> 24:44.800]  drugs and folks it's because they're in the psychotropic hallucinogen family and
[24:44.800 --> 24:50.160]  again no one wants to blame the billions and billions and billions of
[24:50.160 --> 24:56.040]  dollars spent each year for advertising to push these drugs on people Prozac
[24:56.040 --> 24:59.400]  even did a thing back in the 80s and 90s repeatedly where they would mail free
[24:59.400 --> 25:06.600]  samples in the mail to people of a schedule three hallucinogen these are
[25:06.600 --> 25:10.920]  hallucinogens that put people in a dream state so if you have the compulsion
[25:10.920 --> 25:15.560]  to kill people just go ahead and do it it's a fact and I know I'm not going to
[25:15.560 --> 25:19.760]  rant anymore it's just that you continue to see all these people that are on
[25:19.760 --> 25:24.600]  this imprisoned when they kill people because the courts and everybody else
[25:24.600 --> 25:29.120]  knows you do not blame the mass murder suicide pills and I've coined that term
[25:29.120 --> 25:33.000]  and it's now gone viral it was actually in a bunch of newscasts yesterday
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.920]  national newscast had guests talking about it Ben Schwann talked about it when
[25:37.920 --> 25:43.200]  an article in video he did so that's good there is Pierce Morgan blaming
[25:43.200 --> 25:50.640]  blaming gun owners collectively for Sandy Hook a gunfree zone a guy who tried
[25:50.640 --> 25:54.640]  to get guns illegally five times and finally succeeded breaking in after he
[25:54.640 --> 26:01.120]  killed mommy to get her guns another video game head and then I'm to blame
[26:01.120 --> 26:06.680]  no if anybody wants to have blame here it's CNN with sponsors spending
[26:06.680 --> 26:10.880]  billions of dollars a year promoting pills that the insert says it makes
[26:10.880 --> 26:15.840]  people commit suicide or mass murder you promote suicide mass murder pills
[26:15.840 --> 26:21.400]  how dare you sit here and blame my rights and my liberties you little piece
[26:21.400 --> 26:26.800]  of trash that's common sense folks and that's why I got mad that he was there
[26:26.800 --> 26:31.040]  accusing gun owners collectively that's what they do that's what Kerry said if
[26:31.040 --> 26:36.080]  you don't back the Syria war by your anti-American you love Vladimir Putin
[26:36.080 --> 26:41.320]  and you will be to blame for the next killings when when the Obama administration
[26:41.320 --> 26:46.560]  in NATO headed up by France of all groups in Saudi Arabia now Israel admits
[26:46.560 --> 26:51.280]  they're involved in it finally yesterday and said yes we we back Assad was in
[26:51.280 --> 26:55.120]  Reuters we think he he's worse than al-Qaeda they didn't even deny it they
[26:55.120 --> 26:59.280]  owned it and said yes we're gonna back the al-Qaeda groups I mean it was so
[26:59.280 --> 27:05.480]  shocking to see that that that that now okay okay it's out in the open okay
[27:05.480 --> 27:09.040]  we're just Israel was smart to just own it yeah okay sure what's the big deal
[27:09.040 --> 27:15.320]  let's move along and now the big mega church preacher Rick Warren who I'm
[27:15.320 --> 27:20.480]  sad lost your son but I didn't do that I didn't make your son go out and get a
[27:20.480 --> 27:25.320]  gun and kill himself and then oh they don't know where he got the gun but
[27:25.320 --> 27:29.480]  whoever sold it to him that you forgive them like the person knew I mean if you
[27:29.480 --> 27:34.480]  walk in a store and say you know give me Drano and then tell me I'm gonna kill
[27:34.480 --> 27:37.480]  myself with it I'd be no way I'm not gonna sell that to you walk in with
[27:37.480 --> 27:43.320]  Drano did he did he get checked out that's it his son you know you're
[27:43.320 --> 27:48.520]  blaming us here's the clip from the Redcoats slime bag in chief who promotes
[27:48.520 --> 27:53.320]  ads are on a show every night for psychotropic drugs it's all over the news
[27:53.320 --> 27:57.960]  sometimes I watch the news and half the newscast is big pharma with all these
[27:57.960 --> 28:02.080]  different Paxil and Zoloft and you know the rest of it on there and then it's
[28:02.080 --> 28:06.520]  not their fault though it's not their fault it's my fault it's your fault as
[28:06.520 --> 28:11.680]  a gun owner let's go to the club but I had to say Pierce one of the hard things
[28:11.680 --> 28:16.480]  was forgiving the person who sold them the gun because they prayed because I
[28:16.480 --> 28:20.360]  didn't want to forgive him well when you pray on a desperate person yeah yeah
[28:20.360 --> 28:24.160]  you know who that person is right have no idea I don't the police have never
[28:24.160 --> 28:27.800]  been able to find out no because they couldn't trace the gun so absolutely no
[28:27.800 --> 28:32.080]  idea and it was so encrypted and and yeah they couldn't find what I'm written have
[28:32.080 --> 28:36.920]  you been able to forgive this person oh yeah yeah I have to give forgive not
[28:36.920 --> 28:40.840]  alright that's enough let's let's stop right there I could forgive Rick Warren
[28:40.840 --> 28:45.520]  but that's not ignorance that's all scripted with him and his wife a little
[28:45.520 --> 28:50.280]  glitterbug preacher and his wife up there demonizing our civil rights are
[28:50.280 --> 28:54.640]  God-given rights to self-defense crimes down 49% violent crime because of the
[28:54.640 --> 28:58.400]  upswing and gun ownership the criminals are scared to rob houses and rape
[28:58.400 --> 29:02.800]  women and car jackings are a thing of the past except in Chicago New York and
[29:02.800 --> 29:07.640]  DC Liberty is actually reigning the criminals are scared and the criminals
[29:07.640 --> 29:11.440]  of government don't like the fact that they they can't basically have their way
[29:11.440 --> 29:18.480]  with us and she says someone prayed on her son knowingly she's saying oh you're
[29:18.480 --> 29:21.640]  gonna commit suicide here here and they go well do you know who did it then oh
[29:21.640 --> 29:27.440]  no I have no idea as if the person whoever however he got this gun we have
[29:27.440 --> 29:34.400]  no idea how he got it and then you blame us and the gun owner but you
[29:34.400 --> 29:39.720]  forgive us aren't you taking the high road for all you've done Rick Warren
[29:39.720 --> 29:43.960]  you're such a big big man thanks for trying to blame the death of your son

[34:18.840 --> 34:22.560]  the Southern Baptist Convention and others have come out and said it's time
[34:22.560 --> 34:29.200]  to repeal the Second Amendment they said that this year they've had the biggest
[34:29.200 --> 34:34.720]  Catholic newspaper in the US come out and say it's time to repeal the Second
[34:34.720 --> 34:40.000]  Amendment this is what we're talking about and folks they're going to swat
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  team us they're going to take our guns they're already taking our bank accounts
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.040]  our pensions our future our dollar our children on MSNBC they say our children
[34:49.040 --> 34:53.320]  belong to the state these are authoritarians and so scumbag isn't
[34:53.320 --> 34:59.440]  strong enough of a term using the debt of his son to collectively put guilt on
[34:59.440 --> 35:05.840]  us and blame us as gun owners I have had enough when it's always victim
[35:05.840 --> 35:12.120]  disarmament zones where these mass shooters decide to go out and kill
[35:12.120 --> 35:19.680]  people and it doesn't matter if shootings overall are down 49% they are at
[35:19.680 --> 35:23.920]  war with reality CNN by the way I saw it again last night we've written
[35:23.920 --> 35:27.360]  multiple articles on this it's still saying he killed the people with an AR
[35:27.360 --> 35:33.440]  15 here's Morgan has been on notice for two days for two days that it will really
[35:33.440 --> 35:36.960]  about a day and a half it hasn't been an AR 15
[35:37.680 --> 35:45.600]  CNN claims Navy yard shooter had AR 15 shotgun by the way now of course shotguns
[35:45.600 --> 35:49.840]  aren't two to three they're 50 caliber if you want to get technical with the
[35:49.840 --> 35:55.240]  diameter of the barrel but they shoot multiple projectiles in each burst but
[35:55.240 --> 36:00.000]  let's not get technical they're still saying it was an AR 15 folks because
[36:00.000 --> 36:04.600]  that they say polar bears can't swim on CNN and there's less of them even though
[36:04.600 --> 36:10.640]  their numbers are five-fold they say that there's no northern ice cap even
[36:10.640 --> 36:14.800]  though it's the record size ever recorded they they they they literally
[36:14.800 --> 36:23.520]  prey on you viciously and savagely and consciously and have and have Lou Vox and
[36:23.520 --> 36:27.880]  all these ads you know it's always moving to it there's more than 50 of these
[36:27.880 --> 36:30.760]  now every couple years now there's new ones because all the other ones are
[36:30.760 --> 36:33.840]  making everybody kill themselves or suicide this new ones even better and
[36:33.840 --> 36:37.240]  what they do is get worse and worse and worse but despite the fact they've got
[36:37.240 --> 36:41.520]  20% of the population on this so many gun owners are out there shooting home
[36:41.520 --> 36:48.240]  invaders and criminals that the overall regular criminal attacks are way down
[36:48.240 --> 36:53.600]  because they're scared to death and they should be two weeks ever concealed
[36:53.600 --> 36:56.640]  carry went in in Texas and the first people graduated with it and got their
[36:56.640 --> 37:01.400]  license there were carjackers in Houston Dallas and San Antonio killed we've
[37:01.400 --> 37:06.280]  done articles on that they would be carjacking one group and stand still
[37:06.280 --> 37:10.200]  traffic and then somebody would get out and shoot them I mean it's beautiful
[37:10.200 --> 37:14.120]  it's beautiful to see the criminals on the run and the big criminals that run
[37:14.120 --> 37:18.680]  DC they inherently want us to be their slaves they've already stolen our
[37:18.680 --> 37:22.360]  future private fellow reserve they've robbed us of our jobs robbed us of
[37:22.360 --> 37:27.320]  everything all we they know we've got God and guns and family and so they're
[37:27.320 --> 37:30.440]  doing everything they can to attack whatever's left now let's go over some
[37:30.440 --> 37:37.080]  of these articles Navy Yard shooter well first off if you've tell us your
[37:37.080 --> 37:40.640]  experience with serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and psychiatric drugs and if
[37:40.640 --> 37:44.040]  you think they're great calling and tell us if you think they're horrible calling
[37:44.040 --> 37:50.960]  and tell us tell us your bad reactions eight hundred two five nine ninety two
[37:50.960 --> 37:56.280]  thirty one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one we want to hear
[37:56.280 --> 37:59.880]  from you eight hundred two five nine nine two three one now now let's go over
[37:59.880 --> 38:06.760]  these headlines here this is NBC news Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis was not
[38:06.760 --> 38:12.240]  happy with America friends say and of course confirming he was also upset
[38:12.240 --> 38:18.760]  about race relations that's code word for well you know you know you know like
[38:18.760 --> 38:22.400]  girl beat a lot as the new book breaks down we get that author on continuing
[38:22.400 --> 38:26.160]  and I don't know that's the case in this but it looks like it in amongst all
[38:26.160 --> 38:30.600]  the other craziness Washington gunman recently told cops he was being
[38:30.600 --> 38:36.160]  bombarded by microwave signals that kept him awake at night here's the
[38:36.160 --> 38:39.200]  problem a lot of people are actually bombarded and have bad effects from
[38:39.200 --> 38:43.680]  microwave radiation from there's a lot of studies showing it's increasing mental
[38:43.680 --> 38:48.360]  illness and actually making people artificially go schizophrenic with the
[38:48.360 --> 38:50.880]  high load of heavy metals in the environment that have been connected to
[38:50.880 --> 38:55.440]  it for 100 years lead arsenic mercury things like that and then you also get
[38:55.440 --> 39:00.560]  electromagnetic wireless radiation that's been shown to actually increase
[39:00.560 --> 39:05.680]  brainwaves and irritability that's mainline studies now he's probably a
[39:05.680 --> 39:11.400]  schizophrenic or was made schizophrenic as the psychotropic say can make you an
[39:11.400 --> 39:16.000]  artificial schizophrenic psychotic breaks mania paranoid schizophrenia
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.720]  artificially so we don't know if he was chemically a schizophrenic genetically a
[39:20.720 --> 39:26.240]  schizophrenic with some type of brain problem or disorder or whether the
[39:26.240 --> 39:30.320]  drugs did it but we know he's under psychiatric care the cops called over
[39:30.320 --> 39:33.400]  and over again believing the government was after him and here's the problem if
[39:33.400 --> 39:38.960]  the government's really after you which we know Theodore Kaczynski L.A. times you
[39:38.960 --> 39:43.440]  can pull this up Alexander Cockburn broke it was declassified in what two
[39:43.440 --> 39:49.640]  thousand Theodore Kaczynski the unabomber was a high-level MK ultra
[39:49.640 --> 39:56.680]  volunteer and it showed connections of the CIA for more than 15 years and
[39:56.680 --> 40:01.120]  Kaczynski was led into high-level programs at the CIA was very intelligent
[40:01.120 --> 40:06.520]  160 IQ was reported or around there the point is is that Theodore Kaczynski the
[40:06.520 --> 40:11.280]  unabomber was led into high-level meetings where they basically said they
[40:11.280 --> 40:15.000]  were going to exterminate everybody and that's why he wrote about the machines
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.520]  taking over and how we had to stop it and the media just thought he was some
[40:18.520 --> 40:22.040]  crazy environmentalist he was a guy who saw too much now he was either
[40:22.040 --> 40:26.080]  undermined control or flipped out because of what he learned in the MK
[40:26.080 --> 40:31.720]  ultra program but he was definitely an academic with the CIA that's declassified
[40:31.720 --> 40:38.040]  okay Tim McVeigh definitely sheep-debt army intelligence CIA that came out in
[40:38.040 --> 40:43.360]  federal court it was declared national security look it up we know so many of
[40:43.360 --> 40:49.080]  these guys it's right out of the movie the remake of the Manchurian candidate
[40:49.080 --> 40:54.520]  so so what Denzel Washington excellent movie you should watch it that is
[40:54.520 --> 40:59.680]  exactly the kind of stuff and exactly how they do it and they can brainwash and
[40:59.680 --> 41:05.240]  program with drugs and chemicals and electro shock in about a week and then
[41:05.240 --> 41:11.440]  they've got chips in the brain basically as control mechanisms to program
[41:11.440 --> 41:14.880]  basically make you ill make you sick bring you back to the trauma-based mind
[41:14.880 --> 41:18.480]  control they're not that sophisticated from from from the technology knows out
[41:18.480 --> 41:23.320]  there but they can do mind control without that they can hypnotize you over
[41:23.320 --> 41:27.800]  and over again put you on amnesics like halcyon sodium pentothal and then put
[41:27.800 --> 41:32.800]  you back on it like sir hand sir hand to wind you up just to be the patsy just
[41:32.800 --> 41:36.800]  like they drug Marinus Vanderloob who supposedly to the Reichstag fire just so
[41:36.800 --> 41:39.760]  they could blame him so he wouldn't remember anything they don't necessarily
[41:39.760 --> 41:43.120]  even do the shooting they're just there drugged out of their mind thinking it's
[41:43.120 --> 41:48.560]  a video game shooting the gun now I'm not saying this was staged but it's
[41:48.560 --> 41:54.520]  starting to move into that quadrant my gut my gut tells me there's more than
[41:54.520 --> 41:59.760]  meets the eye here I don't know but but but my gut told me it looks suspicious
[41:59.760 --> 42:03.480]  the timing Obama coming out for gun control the night before needing a
[42:03.480 --> 42:07.120]  diversion saying I predict mass shootings but I just said you know they're
[42:07.120 --> 42:10.520]  real schizophrenics they're real people go postal he's probably on drugs see
[42:10.520 --> 42:17.200]  that's natural mass mind control 20% of America including children we cross that
[42:17.200 --> 42:20.720]  Rubicon two years ago look it up that search 20% of America now on
[42:20.720 --> 42:25.400]  psychotropic or anti-depressants is what they call them actually are the
[42:25.400 --> 42:32.800]  opposite if you've got 20% out there that are on this again overall crime
[42:32.800 --> 42:39.760]  going down because of gun ownership and private security cameras that's that's a
[42:39.760 --> 42:43.640]  big part of it let's just be honest you've got crime going way down because
[42:43.640 --> 42:51.640]  that but you do have craziness is up a little bit because out of a giant swath
[42:51.640 --> 42:57.280]  of people you're going to end up having unstable folks but but let's continue
[42:57.280 --> 43:01.520]  with these headlines so imagine he's telling the police they're coming after
[43:01.520 --> 43:05.680]  me and calling 911 in hotel room shooting out people's tires shooting
[43:05.680 --> 43:09.440]  through walls of people and he still has a top secret security clearance folks
[43:09.440 --> 43:12.880]  let me give you a little newsflash you don't get a top secret security
[43:12.880 --> 43:18.080]  clearance now unless they want you to if you have bad credit you don't get
[43:18.080 --> 43:21.040]  security clearances if you have bad credit just search that term it's on
[43:21.040 --> 43:24.800]  record unless they want to hire a criminal for something and there's a
[43:24.800 --> 43:29.840]  lot of felons they hire and just wave it like TSA they wave this guy for some
[43:29.840 --> 43:36.080]  reason they wave this guy and they can do psychological metrics where they can
[43:36.080 --> 43:39.240]  just let out of hundreds of thousands working for the Department of Defense
[43:39.240 --> 43:43.440]  actually millions as contractors and others if they just let schizophrenics
[43:43.440 --> 43:48.360]  keep working and leave them there they know with with the with the scientific
[43:48.360 --> 43:50.880]  breakdowns they have with the supercomputers there's going to end up
[43:50.880 --> 43:56.840]  being these events on their own so see any way you slice it this is a government
[43:56.840 --> 44:00.480]  operation because of the drugs the culture the whole deal we're all under
[44:00.480 --> 44:06.480]  mind control bombardment mind control light compared to what intense mind
[44:06.480 --> 44:09.560]  control is when they actually have you in their clutches so I want to hear what
[44:09.560 --> 44:14.000]  you have to say about this 800 25 9 9 2 3 1 let's go to the rest of the headlines
[44:14.000 --> 44:24.280]  here breaking down all of this news not a diagnosis voices in head more common
[44:24.280 --> 44:28.400]  than thought and we've got NBC News and others saying oh no it was no big deal
[44:28.400 --> 44:31.120]  you got a security clearance nothing to see here that's quite normal to hear
[44:31.120 --> 44:38.680]  voices in your head now it's quite normal for that to be going on of course
[44:38.680 --> 44:43.360]  that is the number one sign of being schizophrenic continuing Washington
[44:43.360 --> 44:46.800]  Navy Yard government Aaron Alexis heard voices in head after playing violent
[44:46.800 --> 44:53.240]  video games up to 18 hours a day we're now learning Buddhist community ponders
[44:53.240 --> 44:58.080]  apparent link between their faith and Navy Yard shooter I mean if the guy like
[44:58.080 --> 45:02.440]  to eat at PF Chang's is it the fault of Chinese food restaurants I mean again
[45:02.440 --> 45:08.280]  this is oh one of the bombers visited Alex's website Alex is to blame it was
[45:08.280 --> 45:12.920]  NBC actually said I'm to blame and so we're all libertarians this is outrageous
[45:12.920 --> 45:18.560]  propaganda now the Buddhist a nonviolent group not they're not offensively violent
[45:18.560 --> 45:21.480]  the Buddhist actually historically trained to fight or good fighters
[45:21.480 --> 45:26.040]  defensively let's get you know aka Obi-Wan Kenobi the Zen Buddhist alright
[45:26.040 --> 45:32.240]  let's continue if we had the ammunition we could have cleared that building son
[45:32.240 --> 45:37.080]  at Navy Yard told dad CNS news has the video interview very important that oh
[45:37.080 --> 45:40.880]  yeah they have guns there were not allowed to have bullets we'll play that
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.520]  video later we have time media berry psychiatric drug connection to Navy
[45:45.520 --> 45:50.160]  shooter Paul Watson's article info wars dot com prison planet dot com and it's
[45:50.160 --> 45:55.560]  also up on drudge report dot com the left hand side here it comes Obama calls
[45:55.560 --> 46:00.920]  for gun control again in aftermath of shipyard shootings we have the quote he
[46:00.920 --> 46:04.200]  calls on Congress you know it's their fault we're not restricting guns that
[46:04.200 --> 46:09.520]  this happened this guy was openly out of his mind with a security clearance and
[46:09.520 --> 46:13.400]  legally owning guns this is who they should have taken to the psychiatric
[46:13.400 --> 46:18.320]  facility but instead people that had PTSD in Vietnam they claim are having their
[46:18.320 --> 46:23.280]  guns taken no criminal record retired police are having their guns taken saying
[46:23.280 --> 46:28.040]  they had PTSD amazing here it goes likely nearly all other mass shooters or
[46:28.040 --> 46:33.320]  like all others Alexis was also being treated with psychiatric drugs Mike
[46:33.320 --> 46:37.280]  Adams of natural news dot com upon info wars dot com very important article
[46:37.280 --> 46:41.560]  Rick Warren we already covered this says he forgives person who's sold gun to
[46:41.560 --> 46:48.560]  son I mean just unbelievable and of course here's our drudge link story here
[46:48.560 --> 46:53.680]  folks that's what the that's what the crew calls those those we're giving away
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.720]  trade secrets that's called a succulent plump because that's about the biggest
[46:57.720 --> 47:01.560]  news link you can get in the world and we appreciate drudge helping fight for
[47:01.560 --> 47:08.720]  the second amendment with the truth of the fact that media bury psychiatric
[47:08.720 --> 47:13.400]  drug connection it is only drudge covering the psychiatric drug connection
[47:13.400 --> 47:18.320]  only drudge and info wars dot com and folks like natural news so we salute
[47:18.320 --> 47:21.680]  people that live in reality and want to defend the second amendment if people
[47:21.680 --> 47:25.280]  just defend the second amendment it's all over for the globalist continuing
[47:25.280 --> 47:29.800]  Navy Yard shooter liberals supported Obama that's right that's from
[47:29.800 --> 47:34.520]  Breitbart caught CNN claims Navy Yard shooter at AR-15 shotgun and they're
[47:34.520 --> 47:39.520]  still reporting that even though it's admitted not true so that's just some of
[47:39.520 --> 47:44.440]  the information on that front we're gonna go to break here in a few minutes
[47:44.440 --> 47:51.240]  and go to your calls on what you've seen in family or yourselves with the bad
[47:51.240 --> 47:56.280]  reactions and again we call them bad reactions the inserts of every vaccine
[47:56.280 --> 48:00.240]  out there says it can cause death autoimmune diseases blood on the brain
[48:00.240 --> 48:09.560]  convulsions narcolepsy guion beret it just hundreds cancer AIDS like auto
[48:09.560 --> 48:14.480]  immune diseases and then every year I had to see it again in August headlines and
[48:14.480 --> 48:19.800]  TV reports going hey don't listen to conspiracy theorist and quacks you know
[48:19.800 --> 48:25.040]  the believe in space aliens there are no side effects other than a sore shoulder
[48:25.040 --> 48:28.840]  from a vaccine I've read you those headlines and they just sit there like
[48:28.840 --> 48:33.480]  con men like Obama going 80 90% of Americans support gun control he said
[48:33.480 --> 48:37.840]  that Sunday I'll meet the press was not a lot less it's not an awful as you know
[48:37.840 --> 48:41.000]  sat up there and said that's right a 90% what their guns take it doesn't matter
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.520]  the poll shows the opposite 70% or more doesn't matter just like polar bears
[48:45.520 --> 48:50.160]  can't swim just like it's your fault Rick warm Sun blew his head off it is all
[48:50.160 --> 48:55.560]  our fault these people are a joke now before we go to break I want to tell you

[55:41.960 --> 55:46.040]  me by the way speaking of drugs have an article where people on medical
[55:46.040 --> 55:50.480]  marijuana they use the medical marijuana card from their medical doctor to take
[55:50.480 --> 55:55.560]  their baby everyone needs to know folks in every major city they're taking kids

[56:08.560 --> 56:12.960]  the CPS all right we're taking calls starting now and into the next hour
[56:12.960 --> 56:16.600]  interspersed with amazing news and Congressman Walter Jones is joining us
[56:16.600 --> 56:22.000]  from North Carolina he's got a bill to impeach Obama you want it you got it
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.880]  we are moving forward in the info war here but I said call in on the drug
[56:26.880 --> 56:31.160]  topic of have you had bad side effects ever taking serotonin reuptake
[56:31.160 --> 56:35.200]  inhibitors and others known as anti-depressants that say on the insert
[56:35.200 --> 56:39.160]  they can make you murder your whole church or chop your kids arms off but
[56:39.160 --> 56:41.600]  hey why not give it to somebody's depressed here's a pill that will make
[56:41.600 --> 56:45.360]  you kill people and then oh my gosh there's more suicide in America that is
[56:45.360 --> 56:50.480]  way up well we better have anti-suicide training and put kids on drugs and oh
[56:50.480 --> 56:53.840]  we're giving them suicide pills more killing themselves well hell the answer
[56:53.840 --> 56:59.960]  to that's more suicide bills suicides in this country doubled in the last 20
[56:59.960 --> 57:04.920]  years you look up the numbers and of course it's more than that yeah in the
[57:04.920 --> 57:08.280]  youth that's more than double because they have now we have now have suicide
[57:08.280 --> 57:14.560]  education and all these suicide education programs they started 1990 under
[57:14.560 --> 57:17.840]  federal training it's the little girls that are the most easy to influence
[57:17.840 --> 57:21.800]  because they want to help and be friendly everybody knows that pre-adolescent
[57:21.800 --> 57:25.960]  girls you know are generally the most pliable and friendly and good in school
[57:25.960 --> 57:29.520]  and they teach them how to hang themselves and how to shoot themselves
[57:29.520 --> 57:32.520]  and whatever you do don't tie the shoelaces around your neck and do this
[57:32.520 --> 57:36.200]  and the little girl goes and does it and just tries it out and they find him
[57:36.200 --> 57:40.800]  dead all the time in the stall but that's okay because then everybody has to be
[57:40.800 --> 57:44.360]  tested because of the scare and they call everyone in run by the drug company
[57:44.360 --> 57:51.080]  reps the file into the into the sports arena or into the into the school
[57:51.080 --> 57:54.840]  auditorium and they have the local psychiatrist there we're gonna do
[57:54.840 --> 57:58.080]  screening we're gonna teach all your 10 or 11 year olds how to not commit
[57:58.080 --> 58:01.440]  suicide and then they do the screening and everybody goes on drugs and then
[58:01.440 --> 58:05.120]  there's a whole bunch of people commit suicide and girls start learning about
[58:05.120 --> 58:08.480]  cutting themselves and suddenly all that's happening and then there's just
[58:08.480 --> 58:11.940]  suicide everywhere then there's more drugs and then more suicide and then more
[58:11.940 --> 58:15.440]  drugs and then more suicide and then more drugs and then more suicide then
[58:15.440 --> 58:19.760]  more drugs suicide suicide suicide suicide and death education they put you
[58:19.760 --> 58:27.400]  in a coffin, in the school, they had to sit at Littleton, Colorado, Columbine, and then
[58:27.400 --> 58:31.560]  they get in the coffin and talk about death, and they have you, they wrap kids up in blankets
[58:31.560 --> 58:36.640]  and teach them how to die. It's all fun to learn how to die, and then, oh, cheepers,
[58:36.640 --> 58:42.760]  creepers, everybody's killing themselves, oh, we didn't know, oh, oh. Mass Mind Control,
[58:42.760 --> 58:48.200]  Mass Mind Control, with your kids captive inside the schools, teaching them how to kill themselves

[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:17.200]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:25.920]  from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Well, this guy was reportedly completely bonkers, hearing
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:36.680]  voices running around calling the police, shooting up people's vehicles and houses, so they gave
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.080]  him a top-secret security clearance, and then he went on a secure base where everybody's
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.720]  disarmed in a victim's harm area and shot everybody, so now we've got to give our guns
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.400]  up. And Rick Warren basically says he forgives American gun owners for killing his son. More
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.360]  of this, you know what, you keep your guilt, okay, and you rewrite the Bible like you say
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.640]  you need to amend it and everything, and you know, keep your guilt to yourself, you psychological
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:06.200]  warfare parasite. And I said I want to open the phones up for people that have had good
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:12.400]  effects, bad effects, hallucinations, psychotic breaks on the antidepressants as they're
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:19.400]  Orwellianly named. And I see Valerie called in, says she had a positive effect, so we'll
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:25.400]  go to her first, and then Burt, Michael, Travis, Eric, and others. Valerie, tell us about
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:32.400]  your positive effect and what you're taking. Well, I am taking three antidepressants, and
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:39.400]  they have absolutely saved my life. I was so disabled, I was in bed all the time, I
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:48.120]  was crying all the time, and they finally hospitalized me because no one knew what was
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:55.120]  wrong with me, and at the last resort put me on some antidepressants, and it was like
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:02.120]  a miracle. I got my life back after being a zombie, and within days I was able to sit
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:14.000]  up in a chair, which I hadn't been able to do for months. Within weeks I was able to
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  drive a car again, and within months I was painting the kitchen, so I'm very thankful.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  What are you on, Valerie? Okay, Rembrandt, which I take at night. I was on Lexapro,
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:39.720]  which I love. I will admit there is a side effect. It's a cardiac side effect, so I
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:46.880]  had to go off of Lexapro. Now I'm on Simbalta, and I also take Wilbutron. They even have
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:53.880]  one that uses the term where they drug people in Brave New World. They even use the same
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:01.360]  name, Sopa. Soma, Soma, Soma. Yes, I read that. I have to say though, I was totally disabled.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:12.760]  I was in bed all the time. I could not walk from one room to another without exhausting
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:17.400]  myself. I couldn't drive a car. I couldn't sit up in a chair. I've actually talked to
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.360]  medical doctors about this. Let's say 15% of the time you have the side effects of
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:27.360]  wanting to kill your children, or commit suicide, or think you're God, or become a nymphomaniac.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:33.000]  There's all sorts of things that they admit these drugs do, but let's say for 85% of people
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.960]  it helps them. My issue is, because of the GMO, the hydrofluorosilic acid, the lack
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:44.440]  of good nascent iodine in the population of the studies show, a lot of people are already
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:50.480]  chemically unbalanced. It's true, but St. John's wort in double-blind studies did better
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.640]  than Prozac. The turmeric and other things have been shown to have better effects than
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:00.160]  psychotropic. It's true for some people because you're already chemically imbalanced. It now
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.360]  brings you into a better balance. Undoubtedly, these drugs can do that. That's why I wanted
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.680]  to open the phones up for people that have had a good effect as well. We're going to
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:17.280]  bring them back with Bert, Michael, Aaron, and Eric, and many others. We appreciate your
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:24.780]  testimony on this. Were you eating any GMOs, or fluoride water, or things like the different
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:30.480]  artificial salts like MSG, before you got in this depressed mode? What happened to get
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:37.240]  you depressed? Well, it was actually the perfect storm of several things, the combination
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:45.400]  of menopause, hypothyroidism, and extreme stress. But I did want to add that it's very
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:52.640]  important to be constantly under the advice of a good psychiatrist, that you can't just
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:58.680]  take these and just go on by yourself. You have to come on here.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:05.080]  Thank you, ma'am. You may be arrested, and or subject to other police action.

[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:15.840]  that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:21.280]  oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.760]  network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:31.520]  continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state. Police State

[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.440]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.480]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes,
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:17.640]  autism and every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat.
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:22.960]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is

[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:12.720]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:21.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:41.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's being dubbed the wrong NATO or a tornado disinformation lies
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:48.120]  in Bravo Sierra at articles up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now. Here's Tergan
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:58.040]  and other mainstream media hacks have been slammed over wrong NATO of Navy Yard shooting
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:02.120]  coverage. And we're going to go over the wrong NATO after we take some calls in Congress
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:09.120]  when Walter Jones, I just combined the name Walter Jones joins us to Walter joins. Walter
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:13.760]  Jones will be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour to talk about how to impeach
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:20.760]  O'Vomit. Hey, you can't blame me for conflating Walter Jones' name with Walter Jones will
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:26.720]  join us to Walter joins when I'm already looking at other conflated names like wrong
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:33.720]  tornado, wrong NATO, O'Vomit, Piers Tergan or Turden. And so I don't know. It's my own
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.720]  stress therapy to make fun of these tyrants instead of just absolutely hating them because
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.720]  then that gives me an ulcer and we can't have that, can we? Thank you for joining us. We're
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:47.720]  now into the second hour today. Well, you had a gun free zone. And you had a guy with
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:51.720]  a national security clearance top secret who had been calling the police over and over
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:56.720]  again, staying in hotels saying that the government was microwave beaming and mind controlling
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.720]  him. He's either schizophrenic or under mind control. There's real mind control programs
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:07.720]  so that could be yet M.K. Alter M.K. Naomi M.K. You name it. Theodore Kaczynski was M.K.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.720]  Alter. That's declassified. Yeah, the unabomber was M.K. Alter. Didn't know that L.A. Tom's
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.720]  look it up. But I said it could be somebody going postal probably on a serotonin re up
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.720]  taken habit or so called anti-depressant. So I thought we'd open the phones up. We just
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:28.720]  took one of them. We're going right back to them right now from people that have taken
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:34.720]  it and liked what happened or not liked what happened because you read about in any of the
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:43.720]  inserts from Prozac 32 years ago to the new stuff that's out today. How do you pronounce
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:48.720]  this? Simbalta. The lady that just called said she was on Simbalta but had to get off
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.720]  of it because of heart problems. So we thought we would look it up. She said it was great.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:57.720]  She was totally depraved. She said it was great. She was totally depraved. She said
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.720]  it was great. She was totally depressed. Couldn't get out of bed. Was crying all the time. And
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:07.720]  I said to her, I think you probably needed iodine. Nation iodine. And I was thinking,
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:12.720]  I bet this lady was hitting menopause. Just like the old wives tales, they knew the herbs
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.720]  to give women when they got near menopause to either put menopause off a while or to
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:22.720]  make it smoother. And all the big studies I was mentioning to her, you can look them
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:26.720]  up. I'm not a doctor. I'm not an MD and I'm not a naturopath. I've done the research.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.720]  Go look it up. St. John's wort, double line studies, better than Prozac. On and on and
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:37.720]  on. You know, different roots, ginseng, you name it. It's all on record. Incredible stuff
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:42.720]  that plants do. Mary Jane has a lot of great effects for people that are having problems
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.720]  of her stomach aches, menopause, you name it. Go look it up. And sure enough, she goes,
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.720]  yeah, I had hyperthyroidism and I was going into menopause. And this is standard now.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:58.720]  They tell women after you have a child, you're going to be depressed a little bit because
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.720]  you've lost your placenta and the high of all those hormones. They don't tell you that's
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:06.720]  normal. Go out and get some exercise, whatever. No, they say, oh my gosh, we want to put you
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:11.720]  on a bunch of drugs. She's on three of them. You heard her. So going into menopause, hey,
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:17.720]  take some psychotropics. Hey, had a car wreck. Your back's hurt. You're depressed. Psychotropics.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.720]  And then you have all these problems and they sit there and tweak them. And for some people,
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:26.720]  it works okay, except for the side effects. I want to read to you from the drug that she
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:37.720]  said that she was on, spelled C-Y-M-B-A-L-D-A, one of the newer popular ones here. Simbalta
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.720]  oral. And they have Simbalta pill. Here it is, sleep disorders. Let me read these to folks.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:51.720]  This is from their site, a heart attack, having a rapid heart action, hemorrhaging, hemorrhaging
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:57.720]  of blood under the skin. That's always fun. Hepatitis just eats your liver. What's wrong
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:02.720]  with you? You don't need your liver. You don't need to be alive. Stevens-Johnson syndrome,
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:09.720]  abnormal liver function test, bruises, life-threatening allergic reactions, mood changes, suicidal
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:15.720]  thoughts, having thoughts of suicide, aggressive behavior, discharge of milk in men. Oh, that's
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:21.720]  always good. Open your own Borden's Dairy or something. Or women when not breastfeeding,
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:27.720]  not feeling well, easily angered or annoyed, extreme discomfort in the calves, high cholesterol.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:35.720]  You may keep going. That's only a fraction of them there. So, meanwhile, the media ignores
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.720]  and buries the fact that he's under psychiatric care, on reported drugs. They won't say which
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:45.720]  ones. Just like the Batman shooter took us nine months to learn when he was on. Harris,
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:53.720]  Clybold, Adam Lanza, Kip Kinkle, on and on and on and on and on. It says it can make you
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:59.720]  cause psychotic breaks and mass murder. It says it can make you a maniac. You know the
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.720]  cool part about it? I don't take any of this. I feel like a maniac constantly. I feel really
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:08.720]  good right now. I'm crazed and there's never any really valleys except maybe at like 10
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.720]  o'clock at 9 o'clock I'll overwork myself. They would say, oh, that's a maniac. No, no,
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:19.720]  it's called being red-blooded and alive. That's what it's called. Jerks. It's called loving
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:29.720]  beauty and innocence and things that are good. That's what it's called. That's what it's
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:33.720]  called, ladies and gentlemen. And they would call it insane because you can't be happy
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:40.720]  without drugs. You can't be happy without the Prozac tree by the river of other psychotropic
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:46.720]  and pharmacological drugs that flows by as the suicide rates. Last time I heard it was
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:51.720]  triple in under 20s and double in the general public and then all time records in the military
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:56.720]  because they're putting them on the drugs. The drugs make a small percentage of people
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:02.720]  suicide and they make a small percentage of people go out and murder people if they admit
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:07.720]  it. You're like, well, what's the big deal? What's 20% of the population? We crossed that
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:15.720]  Rubicon a couple of years ago of 320 million people. Let's do the math. 20, 40, 60. 62
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:28.720]  million people are on psychotropic hallucinogen drugs. Now you know the rest of the story.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:36.720]  And so if you get 15% of people having side effects, 5% mania, 2% suicide, 3% psychotic
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:46.720]  break. Oh, let's have 62 million people having, what's 3% of, that was just one drug we were
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:56.720]  looking at. What's 3% of 62 million? How many psychotic breaks is that? 3% of 62 million.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:01.720]  That's a lot of people running around doing stuff. And so their answer is blame us. So
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:06.720]  let's go to your calls now. Burt in Texas, what is your take on this? Have you had good
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.720]  side effects, bad side effects? I mean, I guess if you're Jeffrey Dahmer, it's a good side
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.720]  effect to kill people. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:19.720]  They were real bad. I took some balta and will butrant. And when I took those two medications,
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:26.720]  they put me on one first and it did cause suicidal thoughts. And I was driving there, I live
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:31.720]  in San Antonio and I was driving on this highway where they're building a new bridge and the
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.720]  thought just came into my head to drive off the bridge. And I was like, I need to stop
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:40.720]  taking this. And I went back to the doctor and he tried to pump me with another one with
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:44.720]  the well butcher. And he's like, well, that one does cause that to happen. He admitted
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:48.720]  it to me. And after I looked it up and saw the side effects, I was like, wow, I can't
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:54.720]  believe I was taking this. And so he prescribed well butchering to me and I threw it in the
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.720]  head and said, you know what, I'm just going to go to church and I'm not taking these drugs.
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:01.720]  Well, let me say this and I'm no medical doctor but you should look it up. We've had medical
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.720]  doctors on as well as psychologists and psychiatrists. I guess they're medical doctors as well, the
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:11.720]  psychiatrists. Let me explain something. If you go off these, you better go off them very
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:17.720]  slow. Over several months is what I've read and doctors have said and you need to supplement
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:23.720]  it as you go off of them with natural herbs that will help you naturally. But I mean,
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.720]  people, I'm telling you, you're designed to help others. If you're depressed, go to the
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:34.720]  Salvation Army, help homeless people, you know, old men, you name it, see how bad off they
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.720]  are. It's not the goody two shoes will suddenly make you feel good. It's the helping people
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:44.720]  just automatically makes your brain go, I'm a good person. I need to not die for the tribe.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:48.720]  You're just sitting around watching TV all day, unhappy, going into menopause. Don't
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:53.720]  have, you're eating GMO, your thyroid's fried. Of course you feel like killing yourself.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:58.720]  But if you go out and help homeless people or you go out and visit old people at the
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.720]  nursing home with your dog, just say, I want to, and the old people are like, you care
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.720]  about me? You want to talk to me? And it's nothing like hanging out with old people, folks.
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:11.720]  It just makes the spirit just soar. I can't explain what it is. It's about being with
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:16.720]  the elders. That will help you. Go help people in nursing homes. Go help homeless people.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:20.720]  Go pick up 10 cans on the side of the road to sell them. Start a garden. They've shown
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:24.720]  psychologically starting a garden will help you. But whatever you do, go off it slowly.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.720]  God bless you, Bert. Thank you for telling your testimony. Let's talk to Eric in Tennessee.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:35.720]  Eric, you're on the air. Go ahead. Yes, sir, I'm here. Welcome, my friend. Yes, sir.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:41.720]  Kudos to you, Alex. God bless you and the Republic of America. We do respect you, sir.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:47.720]  Well, thank you. Sir, would you like to tell us your take on this? Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:57.720]  Now, basically, I had a brain abnormality that showed up. They thought it was an aneurysm.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:02.720]  It hit me like a shot in the dark. It dropped me to my knees one day. And from there on,
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:08.720]  I had pain on the left side of my head like a brain freeze that never goes away. Wow.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:13.720]  That led me to some deep depression just due to the fact that I was in pain all the time.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:18.720]  Stay there. I'm going to come back to you. But that's Obamacare. What they've done with the VA
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:23.720]  is that you don't get your knee worked on. You don't get your brain fixed. They just put you on the drugs.
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:27.720]  That's the thing. I know people that have been in car wrecks and they're in the hospital.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:31.720]  Well, you cracked your spine. We recommend you go on some antidepressants.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:34.720]  They're putting everybody on. Stay there. I'm going to come back to you.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:39.720]  I want folks to hear this. Then we're going to go to everybody else's patiently holding, Michael.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:42.720]  And then we'll go to Pauline and Aaron and others.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:48.720]  And Walter Jones is going to be joining us. Congressman Walter Jones from North Carolina
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.720]  is going to be joining us coming up for just one segment.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.720]  And it will continue with your calls, open phones today.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:00.720]  And I've got a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet on Benghazi, the IRS persecution.

[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:35.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:38.720]  We've done the math out of 60-plus million Americans
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:43.720]  on psychotropic mass murder suicide pills known as antidepressants,
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.720]  properly orwellianly named.
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:52.720]  That is 1,860,000 people if with just one drug alone as an average
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.720]  and 3% have psychotic breaks.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:02.720]  That's 1,860,000 paranoid schizophrenic mass murder machines in America
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.720]  just waiting to kill everybody.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:08.720]  And that's all the reasons for us to be armed to protect ourselves.
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.720]  Going back to Eric in Tennessee, so you had some type of aneurysm or something.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.720]  You had a lot of pain on one side of your face.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.720]  And tell us what happened.
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:20.720]  Well, basically after five years of dealing with this,
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:25.720]  at the beginning, they put me on Prozac with a lithium chaser.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.720]  So that was pretty intense in itself.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:33.720]  I ended up going to 15 separate doctors before they finally found out
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.720]  it was a twisted artery as opposed to an aneurysm, and it was inoperable.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:43.720]  Now, the lithium chaser with the Prozac caused crazy intense
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.720]  during suicidal thoughts.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:48.720]  I was more depressed than ever because I was getting less sleep,
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:52.720]  felt crazy, and knew that that's what was causing it.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.720]  So I quit it all slowly.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:58.720]  I drank vitamin drinks and felt better within days.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:02.720]  And more research that I did into it said that basically your genes
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:07.720]  are the main trigger, and there's a doctor, a Moria Dolan MD,
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:11.720]  that along with the chemicals that we take in daily, you know,
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.720]  can interact with it and make it the perfect cocktail to cure you
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:19.720]  or kill everyone in your family or, in this case, on a Navy base.
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:23.720]  After everything that I've been through, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.720]  I mean, there are better ways.
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:31.720]  They never let me sit down and talk to anybody about what was causing my problem.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:36.720]  Well, now, I mean, I talked to ActiveDuty and they're ordering them
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:40.720]  on psychotropic and painkillers when there's not anything wrong with them.
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:44.720]  To get them primed and addicted and liking them, this is pharmacia
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:49.720]  as a tool of social control, something the Nazis and the Soviets pioneered,
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:52.720]  but something that now is extremely mainstream.
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:59.720]  In fact, the ninja were drugged at a young age to addick them to opiates
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.720]  so that they would be ready to follow their orders.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:07.720]  They use sex and opiates in the ninja death cult, assassin's death cult,
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.720]  to control the ninja or some sex of the ninja.
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.720]  And so this is how long they've been doing this.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:13.720]  It's unbelievable.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:14.720]  Thank you so much, Eric.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.720]  And glad they found out it was a twisted artery.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.720]  Yeah, now you go into the VA and say, man, I got really, my shoulder really hurts.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:23.720]  And they go, well, here's some serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.720]  You're like, but I want to get an X-ray on my shoulder.
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.720]  He's just, buddy, you don't talk back around here.
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.720]  I'll have the security remove you.
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:35.720]  Now, you take this and then maybe we'll look at doing surgery.
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:37.720]  Is that clear?
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.720]  Let's talk to Michael in Washington.
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:41.720]  You're on the air.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:42.720]  What's your story?
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.720]  Alex, how you doing?
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.720]  Pretty good.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:46.720]  Good.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.720]  I just wanted to call in because I am actually currently taking medication.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:56.720]  I've been on 15 different types over about four year period.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:00.720]  And I'm slowly trying to get off of them.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.720]  I can't find a doctor that actually let me get off.
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.720]  He just keeps prescribing me more and more.
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.720]  But I've taken some ball to like the lady and the guy before.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:18.720]  Lithium, cerakyl, Zyprexa, Lexapro.
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.720]  Right now I'm on lamotrigine.
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:27.720]  And I've had bad effects with every single one of them.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:33.720]  With the lithium and the cerakyl that I was taking at the same time,
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:36.720]  I was having hallucinations.
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:41.720]  I would see people like die in front of me.
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.720]  Yeah, that's the common one I see is that you see demons,
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.720]  grim reapers, dead people.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.720]  That's what I see in the news articles.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.720]  What kind of drug makes you see demons?
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.720]  I mean, doesn't sound like I want to be taking that.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.720]  So what would you see?
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.720]  Like how would the people look?
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:02.720]  Well, like if I was standing in line at a checkout line at the grocery store,
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:08.720]  I would watch people just drop in mass quantities and be dead late on the floor.
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:11.720]  Well, it is in the hallucinogen class.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:14.720]  So, well, you know, I'm not going to give you medical advice
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.720]  because it's the going off of it instantly that will wipe you out.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.720]  But I've heard most doctors say, no, no, you need more.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:22.720]  And they'll put you on as many as seven drugs at a time
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:25.720]  until you start having convulsions.
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:30.720]  But if I was you personally, I would start incrementally sawing the pills,
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:34.720]  you know, basically measuring them, crushing them into a powder or however,
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:39.720]  measuring it to reverse titrate the dose downward over two months.
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.720]  And then I would just take it easy and see what go.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:42.720]  I'm not telling you to do that.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:43.720]  That's what I do.
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.720]  But man, that sounds like hell.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.720]  Illucinations of people dying.
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.720]  That's pretty much standard.
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.720]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:56.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:27.720]  You're kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:30.720]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.720]  and testing it out and verifying it,
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.720]  they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.720]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:40.720]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:44.720]  so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:54.720]  Out of another one, another plane just passed.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.720]  At Silver Lungs, we have developed a reliable and easy-to-use
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:23.720]  full production system for creating endless pure nano-silver solutions
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:26.720]  right from the convenience and comfort of your home.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:30.720]  Your self-produced nano-silver solutions can be applied topically to the skin.
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:34.720]  For many who are new to silver that wish to try silver for the first time,
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:38.720]  we offer a full line of consumables and cosmetics,
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:41.720]  such as our two-ounce nano-silver nasal sprays,
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:44.720]  our nano-silver soap, and our most popular product,
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.720]  the all-natural nano-silver gel.
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:51.720]  Visit www.silverlungs.com to learn more
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:55.720]  about the industry-leading technology of the Silver Lungs system.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:32:00.720]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:04.720]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.720]  to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:10.720]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.720]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:17.720]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:20.720]  Supernatural silver is a new patented technology
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:23.720]  that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.720]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:32.720]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current,
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:36.720]  making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:39.720]  against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:42.720]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally,
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:45.720]  and our silver gel can be used topically.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:48.720]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.720]  can help you win the war against deadly pathogens,
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:53.720]  go to www.supernaturalsilver.com.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:55.720]  That's www.supernaturalsilver.com.

[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:31.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:34.720]  Alright, Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.720]  scheduled to call in the next five minutes or so
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:40.720]  to give us his breakdown on how we can potentially move forward
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:43.720]  and impeach Barack Obama.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:47.720]  So the Congressman is going to be joining us.
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:51.720]  If you've just tuned in, we're taking phone calls.
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.720]  We'll do this after Jones leaves us as well
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.720]  of people that have been on so-called antidepressants
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:01.720]  and just the nightmare situations they're having,
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.720]  the hallucinations, going in for a twisted artery,
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:06.720]  and they say, we're not going to give you surgery.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:07.720]  Here's this drug.
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.720]  I mean, there's so many angles to this,
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.720]  but I recommend everyone read the inserts.
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:13.720]  And when you have the side effects,
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.720]  their answer is more drugs to zombify you,
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.720]  and they're doing this to foster children in this country.
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.720]  And then I have another CBS News article of people
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:24.720]  that get medical marijuana cards.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:29.720]  For glaucoma, you name it, the CPS comes and takes their kids.
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:30.720]  It is unbelievable.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:31.720]  And here's what's scary.
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.720]  They're saying, well, if it's known you smoke marijuana
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:37.720]  or take the pills, you might be the victim of armed robbery.
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:39.720]  And so because you smoke pot,
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.720]  we're going to take your kids for your safety,
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.720]  saying your house is more likely to be robbed.
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:45.720]  That's saying take your kids because you live in a poor area
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.720]  or take your kids because you live in a rich area.
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:54.720]  This is what CPS, Breaking Up Families, is doing across the country.
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:00.720]  And it is truly, truly insane to watch this level of garbage unfolding.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.720]  We're in an info war, and that's why everything I do
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:05.720]  is about getting people prepared,
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:09.720]  and we fund ourselves also by promoting things that I believe in
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:12.720]  and that clearly either protect you,
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:15.720]  prepare you, inform you, or wake up others.
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:19.720]  And that's why whenever we had a constitutional lawyer in here
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:22.720]  the other day, a few weeks ago,
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:27.720]  with his law practice, he had these black and blue and red pins
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:29.720]  that had the name of his law practice.
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:31.720]  And I said, wow, those are really neat silver pins
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:33.720]  that have a black cap that are really nice
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:38.720]  and have a powerful LED light, very powerful in the dark at night.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.720]  I can't believe how good this technology is getting.
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:42.720]  We bought these thousands of them,
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.720]  and they just went on the shopping cart right now.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.720]  We're selling them at cost.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:48.720]  They come in a nice little box.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:54.720]  We're selling them to you at cost as a wonderful tool to wake people up.
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:58.720]  The black version says America has been occupied by Globalist Forces,
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:01.720]  infowars.com.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:07.720]  And the blue one says forbidden information, infowars.com.
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:13.720]  And you can get different quantities right there on the site
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:16.720]  selling these at cost.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.720]  You buy 15 or more, you can get them for like $2 apiece, folks.
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.720]  Okay, so they're all up there on the site,
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:26.720]  and these cost us like $1.60 apiece, $1.70 apiece
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.720]  at the time we package them and sell them.
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:29.720]  They cost over $2 apiece.
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:31.720]  So, again, it's not wrong to make money.
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.720]  It's just that we have certain things we sell,
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:37.720]  like the magazine and the bumper stickers and the activist packs
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:40.720]  and things like that that are designed to wake people up.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:42.720]  You want to wake your boss up, you want to wake your pastor up,
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.720]  you want to wake your employees up,
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.720]  you want to wake your neighbors up.
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:49.720]  Everybody loves a nice little silver pen.
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:51.720]  Let me show people how these pens look with the caps off.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:57.720]  I mean, that is a really executive-looking silver pen.
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:00.720]  And then it's got the nice black cap that goes on it,
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.720]  and then it's got the light, really an invaluable tool
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:10.720]  to wake people up at costinfowarsstore.com.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:15.720]  Or simply call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:17.720]  I don't know if you're going to like these.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:19.720]  Tell me if you do.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:23.720]  We bought a few thousand of them.
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:27.720]  And the congressman was called to a vote at the house
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:30.720]  that was not scheduled till next hour.
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:31.720]  So, it's now been flipped.
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.720]  He'll be with us at the start of the next hour.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.720]  So, Congressman Jones, the office, just called us.
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:38.720]  He was called to a unscheduled vote,
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.720]  and will be joining us on the impeachment situation.
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:43.720]  I remember when Ron Paul used to be in the house.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:45.720]  That happened a lot.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:47.720]  I think Ron Paul's on next week, isn't he?
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:48.720]  So, that should be informative.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:50.720]  We'll get his take on impeachment as well.
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:52.720]  But the North Carolina congressman, always a trooper,
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.720]  should be joining us sometime in the next hour.
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:57.720]  You can also get the Patriot T-shirts there.
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.720]  Hundreds of different designs.
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:02.720]  You can get Women's Apparel there.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:07.720]  It's all about waking others up or meeting like-minded people.
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.720]  We've got the Obama Tyrant shirts, the Obamacare shirts.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:11.720]  It says death panels are cool.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:13.720]  We have the mass murderers agree.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.720]  Gun control works.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:18.720]  On the back, it says politicians like disarmed peasants.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:21.720]  And again, your purchase makes the entire transmission possible.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:22.720]  Okay.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.720]  Let me just recap.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.720]  If you joined us, I want to go back to calls now
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:26.720]  and then into some geopolitical news.
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:32.720]  I've got to hit some Benghazi news and some other world news
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.720]  that I really want to hit, as well as some NSA news.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:44.720]  And some photos showed up on infowars.com today
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:50.720]  and dealing with the Rothschilds and one of their castle palaces
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:54.720]  over in France.
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.720]  And I knew I'd seen these photos before,
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:58.720]  but the article didn't say where they were from.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:03.720]  So I've got a Don Salazar writing an article to tell you where it came from.
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:07.720]  And then to tie it in to some of the background on it.
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:12.720]  So you can see why this mirrors eyes, eyes wide shut,
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:16.720]  and why it's now been released.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:21.720]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:24.720]  Coming up, I'm trying to find the actual article.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:28.720]  It's now scrolled off into the featured news archives.
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:33.720]  Vigilant Citizen put it out, revealing pictures from 1972 Rothschild,
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.720]  Illuminati Ball, all satanic in imitations written in reverse,
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:41.720]  and pretty much the same uniforms they wore and eyes wide shut.
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.720]  We know Kubrick went to these type of events.
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:48.720]  He shot it at a Rothschild palace in London, or outside of London,
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.720]  and they have them all over the world.
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:53.720]  And of course there's like tables with piles of,
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.720]  what appears to be feces on it that they would eat around
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:58.720]  and other stuff.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.720]  And we have modern photos of these same Rothschilds
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:03.720]  wearing Diablo pentagrams around their necks
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:05.720]  and things in public.
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:08.720]  So I just thought I'd let you know about the Rothschilds a little bit.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:12.720]  We're going to break that down and tie it into Bohemian Grove
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:15.720]  and some of the operations that I've infiltrated
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:17.720]  at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:19.720]  I was going to do it bottom of the next hour,
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.720]  but who knows if Walter Jones is there.
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:25.720]  But I've got Leanne McAdoo doing a report on this tonight as well.
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:28.720]  But I wanted to go back to where this was released
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:31.720]  by the author and the photographer herself.
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.720]  So that folks, because some people are in the comments going,
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:36.720]  this isn't real.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:38.720]  Of course, I instantly, when I saw it a month ago,
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.720]  knew they were real because I recognized the head of the
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:44.720]  French Rothschild family as well.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:48.720]  So we're going to give you that URL in a 46-page article
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:52.720]  that Don Salazar is going to mirror and post.
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:56.720]  And it's got even more, more stuff on it with what they're doing.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:00.720]  So that'll be up in the next couple of hours on infowars.com
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:04.720]  and prisonplanet.com.
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:10.720]  Okay, talk about the Illuminati, the Rothschilds boogie down to it.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:14.720]  Now, I said I wanted to open the phones up for people that have taken
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.720]  so-called antidepressants.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.720]  The real name is mass murder, suicide pills now being adopted widely.
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:21.720]  Orwellianly, again, they call the Patriotic,
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.720]  Patriotic, Patriotic, they call the Federal Reserve Federal,
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:26.720]  they call drugging half of the school children as the plan,
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:28.720]  under New Freedom Initiative, New Freedom, this is it.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.720]  You know, a women's going into menopause, they don't say,
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:33.720]  hey, maybe you want harm, but there's some risk,
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.720]  but you'll still basically stay young,
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:38.720]  might make you get cancer later,
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:40.720]  but you'll be young until that happens, basically,
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.720]  or how about these herbs that make,
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:44.720]  going into menopause a lot less better?
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:45.720]  How about your thyroid?
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:46.720]  Do you have bad hyperthyroidism?
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:48.720]  How about we get you the iodine you need?
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:50.720]  The nascent iodine is the best.
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:58.680]  No, no, no, no, no sir. We're gonna put you on a bunch of psychotrophics. Oh, you almost had a heart attack
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:03.120]  Oh, you're bleeding. Oh, let's put you on a different one and then they they tweak it and
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:09.160]  I'm sure that you know these type of things might help somebody the problem is they attack the liver at the body
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:13.920]  They're very toxic. They're all in the fluoride family. There's a reason they put hydrofluorosalistic water
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.560]  Systems in the water
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:20.280]  It's because it also acts as an adjuvant the medical doctors have broken down
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:28.400]  Nothing acts as an adjuvant better than hydrofluorosalistic acid or basically sodium fluoride with the electrons manipulated to make it highly
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:30.920]  acidic
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:39.200]  It takes things in some cases and boosted thousands of times the effect it would have so they can then put micro amounts of drugs and
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:46.440]  Hormones and things in the water and when you drink it with the hydrofluorosalistic acid, that's why they don't want to take it out
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:50.840]  That's why the feds will spend I think they spent like eight million dollars over a two-year period beating
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:55.880]  the groups that wanted to stop fluoride going in the water in San Antonio about 15 years ago and
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:05.640]  It is just amazing the adjutant effect that this has to turbo charge all the other
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:12.800]  Goodies because you know, they can't put a chemical, you know in the water separate from that meant to brain damage you make you depress
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:17.640]  Whatever the case is which we've caught them doing there's hundreds of things in the water just hundreds and hundreds. They're adding I
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:21.960]  Mean it's really expensive, but loving hydrofluorosalistic acid
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:30.960]  Supercharges everything it ties into so it's a loving attack by the Satanist that run the planet and they care about you
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:35.120]  So remember to get all your shots for your children and drink more fluoride
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:38.840]  They love you
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:41.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Aaron
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.840]  Aaron in Montana. Tell us your story
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.840]  Yes, I
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.520]  Okay, yes, sir, you're on the air
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:44:01.920]  Okay, yeah, I grew up in foster care and took just like I'm fair close Olaf and I took out with him riddle in low buterin
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:05.560]  Clomatin ambient tracidone Prozac
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.320]  How's I'm a ton of stuff?
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:14.240]  It would do blood test on me every other week while I was in my treatment center in foster care and
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:17.680]  Yeah
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:24.640]  And boy, I bet those foster parents and people when they had an at-risk child you get double or triple cash
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:30.960]  Well, would they take you on the lavish trips and stuff or do they basically lock you up in your room and give you maybe a hamburger a day?
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:35.720]  First foster home. I was locked up in a basement room. Mm-hmm
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:39.720]  Mm-hmm the second boss home same thing. Mm-hmm
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:43.960]  And into a couple good ones, but honestly, yeah for the most part it was
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:45.960]  Oh
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.880]  Yeah, they can they can hold like six seven kids
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:54.040]  And then they'll have other foster parents keep them when they go on like trips to roam trips to
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:45:00.280]  Tahiti and they just eat filet mignon while you literally get fed the worst stuff. They beat you
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:04.840]  They sexually abuse you and it's all on record. It's the most dangerous place to be but hey, what's wrong with that?
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.840]  The government cares about us
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:11.120]  Yeah, right so so what was your experience on these drugs?
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.880]  Wow, um, I was in a treatment center. I was
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:21.120]  Around 11 years old to like 14. I'm about 30 now, but I
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:29.120]  Basically ran away from the treatment center and and within four days my body was shutting down
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:32.960]  I couldn't really function think I eventually got
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:39.840]  Picked up by the police and then they took me to DT where I my body just shut down completely and I went to the hospital
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.840]  where they had to bring me back
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:44.720]  and then
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:46.960]  I
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:49.040]  Went back to the treatment center after everything
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:55.200]  Happened and then they the doctor fairy tried to put me back on all the medicine that I was on again. Oh
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:57.840]  Hello
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:04.000]  Well, that makes it easier on him of all the warehouse kids are drugged out of their minds. He's a good dungeon keeper
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:06.960]  Yeah
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:11.300]  Well, it sounds like by the grace of God you defeated it. You're doing better now
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:19.520]  Well, yeah, I joined the military. I was I was asleep, you know, I went to Iraq and I started doing insane things
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:25.920]  I didn't you know, my I don't know. I I don't have as bad as dreams as other people do but you know, I
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:29.600]  Was I was woken up, you know
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.320]  Yeah, I now have nightmares from watching the battle footage and the al-qaeda people killing kids
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:41.120]  They're on McBrain's and they're putting a big compilation together. I just can't even look at it the chopping up toddlers with swords and
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:46.880]  raping women and eating hearts and everything and then to know our government's right there funding them. It's unbelievable
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  This is the opposite
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.240]  Well, that's because you're a bad man. You should thank the government for what they're doing. It's it's good that they do all this, sir
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:58.560]  Yeah, right. Well, I'm a combat that I've been signed up for that
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:05.760]  No, I hear you. It's very very sick and very very painful. But when you realize that these people are a bunch of Satanists that run things
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.840]  Then it all all makes sense. God bless you, sir. And I'm glad to hear you're doing okay
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:17.440]  What a rough country to grow up in folks the most obese the most diseased the most mentally ill the highest cancer rates
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:22.720]  The highest autism rates. I mean, we are just we are just last and everything
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:28.880]  We were an exceptional nation in first and everything but the globalists came in and use use high-tech warfare on us
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:34.160]  We've been occupied by the globalists pretty much completely since about 1963
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:41.360]  Partially before that since 1913 and man, they are using scientific warfare on us. This is
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:44.800]  scientifically developed deployed
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:47.560]  systems of control and
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:55.560]  And knowing is the key being aware of the enemy and facing how much trouble we're in is the only way to turn this around
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:59.720]  If you become aware of the enemy, you'll start seeing it all around you warn others
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:03.800]  Withdraw all consent from the new world order. They are a dehumanizing
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:08.440]  eugenicist scientific dictatorship brave new world enemy
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:12.440]  They even name the drugs they put women and kids on soma
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:15.800]  the direct mind control drug from the book
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:19.000]  1932 I mean this is a plan
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:22.920]  Let's go ahead and talk to paul lean in colorado. Thanks for holding her on the air
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:29.880]  Hey, alex. How's it going? It's pretty painful here in these here in these stories people seeing dead people when they take
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:32.040]  You know these drugs go ahead
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:41.880]  Yeah, so uh 11 years ago, um, my son, uh, you know, he was 15 years old. He was just being a boy boys or boys
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:49.480]  Uh, tried to set the back deck on fire with uh, just a cigarette lighter, you know a big lighter
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:55.160]  And so I thought I'd be a hard-ass mom like, you know, my dad raised me he was in the military
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:58.760]  You know, my parents are very strict and I thought he'd get
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:03.080]  Call the cops, you know, they took him away. I thought he just did in the
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:06.600]  You know the jail for a couple hours or whatever and I'd take him home
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:15.640]  Well, they ended up putting him in some psychiatric hospital and and they wouldn't let him go until he was on like depico prozac
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.360]  um and some other drug
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:23.160]  And uh, yeah, he stayed a week in the hospital. So that was like a big
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:27.880]  Weird thing and the other thing is I have, you know, also a stepson
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:30.600]  He was five years old
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:32.600]  Um when he was diagnosed with
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:39.640]  You know add and and some other things deficit or something and he's on two medications too
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:43.640]  Yeah, now let me explain how this works. This was all actually worried out by john p. Holder and others
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:46.680]  This is all public by the way. They all write books about they're very proud of it
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.240]  They put the fluoride in the water the gmo's the hype fructose corn syrup
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:57.080]  I mean if you put an animal on that I had my dog gave it a few scoops of bites of ice cream in the day
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:59.080]  And it ran around crazy for an hour
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:04.840]  Uh, it was it was actually hilarious. But the point is we put them on these on on all these chemicals
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.840]  Then they do act out
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:12.280]  They do have problems and the same system that did this then comes in with something 50 times worse
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:18.920]  And uh, it's it's diabolical diabolical and it's all a plan and it's working quite well
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:27.480]  Um, the interesting thing is is with my son. They said he was bipolar and you know, as I understand it
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:31.000]  Bipolar people have that for life, right? Correct. Yes, ma'am
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:40.120]  Well, he's 26 years old now and he's never he hasn't been on medication for probably I don't know, you know eight years
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:45.720]  Yeah, no, I mean, I mean here's the deal ma'am. God bless you. I appreciate your testimony. It's almost all pure bull
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:52.920]  According to all the literature I've read from all angles most schizophrenia and things like that is heavy metals and toxicity
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:57.800]  They used to have plants in England and they called it mad as a hatter because the chemicals they were around they all went crazy

[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:20.920]  Boiled
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:27.800]  To know this is a scientific takeover program to domesticate the people in the world and that they are
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:31.640]  Targeting and and drug pushing
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:35.560]  I was an honor student at anderson high school
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:38.520]  I was in high school five years one year
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:42.440]  I was sent away to work on the ranch because I wasn't so much trouble my parents moved to austin to get me out of
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:46.600]  Fighting and stuff like that. I wasn't really bad, but I wasn't a lot of fights and stuff like that
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:49.720]  and when we moved
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:52.920]  Uh, you know down here to austin. I remember
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:57.320]  By my second year there when I was graduating. I was an honor student
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:01.320]  I I didn't really need to be there my fifth year, but I hadn't quite finished
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:08.760]  Uh, my studies so two periods out of the day. I was in the teacher's office. I was in the principal's office. I was
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:13.560]  You know helping them run errands. I was an office boy or whatever you call it and
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:19.320]  That they would tell me, you know, hey, we're on riddling. We like it. It's like speed. You like drugs, don't you?
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:24.120]  And I was a completely clean cut jock and I was like do I look like I use drugs
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:30.920]  And uh, then it moved from that to well if you're getting out of school soon, you aren't pretty handsome
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:32.920]  You want to you know go out on a date?
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:36.760]  I mean, this is the type of stuff that goes on at public schools folks
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:39.880]  and
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:41.960]  The little kids they can target
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:43.560]  I
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:48.840]  Remember there were kids who had been flunked two or three grades when I was in the sixth grade that I'd get in fights with and then
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:50.840]  I would end up fighting back and
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:54.680]  My dad would be called to school and they'd say well your son didn't start it
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:59.880]  But he did ram that kid's head into the ground and he's at the hospital now and you know for a six year old
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:01.880]  that's pretty mean and uh
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:07.400]  And you know, we'd like your son to go to this doctor and we think he should be put on drugs
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:10.440]  And my dad said no way
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:15.400]  It's on it doesn't matter. He's been in here 10 times this year. You need to keep those bully kids from attacking
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:20.520]  The problem is that beat up one and their cousins that want to fight me and then that kids little I can be you know
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.520]  Kids with mustaches in the sixth grade folks
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:25.240]  I mean, that's like that. That's what I grew up around
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:29.560]  In Dallas, Texas, and they would just you know, they weren't bad
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:35.240]  I was bad and so they tried to put me on drugs in sixth grade
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:41.000]  And then they tried to do it again when I was a senior that was in Dallas a senior in Anderson, honey
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:45.800]  And it happened repeatedly like I was arguing in
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:48.920]  American history class with somebody once
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:53.880]  And they had a substitute teacher from the school there that just did substituting at that school
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:58.360]  And she was like, you know, I'm going to recommend that you go see a psychologist
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:01.160]  I'm going to write and have the school write a note to your parents
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:05.880]  Just because I was arguing with her and people and I made like a 99
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:09.640]  In that class when I graduated
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:14.520]  Remember my report card would be 99 99 100 100 98
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:19.880]  And here I am clean cut working out every day friends having a super great time
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:24.280]  Friends with Shane stoner. He was in the same grade as me went to high school together
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:27.160]  And going out having a great time
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:28.680]  just
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:31.080]  Working out twice a day totally clean cut
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:36.680]  Turned my life around and they wanted to drug me folks. Can you imagine the foster kids?
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:38.920]  What they're doing to them the little kids the two year olds
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:44.280]  They're putting on drugs when they cry for mommy. This is child abuse. This is sick and it's a crime
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:50.520]  And now I have a cbs news report where the parents this is happening in texas
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:55.080]  If they catch you with marijuana or you go in to get a blood test or something for insurance
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:59.880]  And then they come take your kiss you smoked it but in other states like colorada and 16 other states, california
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:03.960]  All over I see this in the news every day, and I know people it's happening to

[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:29.240]  Because they're gonna put the child on a bunch of drugs
[01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:31.880]  They're gonna brain damage the child
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:34.280]  And that child's lucky if it doesn't end up

[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:26.600]  And what's funny with that circle? I think it masked a lot of problems I had from my, uh
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:29.160]  Problems with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:39.240]  Which itself is again a biological weapon program within the vaccines that's been documented it appeared and has been connected to measles antibodies in this gut
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:42.040]  And exactly you go in for a broken leg now
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:47.640]  They try to give you prozac or prozac type drugs and so oh, I oh they said you were mentally ill because you had stomach aches
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:55.000]  Um, no, I had what was called mentally ill. Uh when I became a suicidal after I got that
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.400]  I was on ethical when I was like 16 years old. You're supposed to love the bio weapons
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:01.880]  You're supposed to love the bio weapons that have hurt you
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:03.400]  well, uh
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:09.720]  Do you want to thank David Rockefeller right now for the bio weapon program and bill gates who has a bio weapon gut program going
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:12.280]  Do you want to thank them for all the gifts they've given everybody?
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:14.840]  Yeah, I don't think so. Mm-hmm. Oh
[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:17.960]  Oh, that's that's mean
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:19.880]  Yeah
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:24.040]  But it's funny that uh, uh, I before I was on circle. I was on uh
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:30.040]  Thorazine and that didn't help any either. I mean, I was on they gave you the anti psychotic thorazine
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:35.000]  Yeah for I lied about hearing voices because I felt a little nuts and I was little nuts in my head
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:37.080]  So I'm like, I'm hearing voices. I want to shut up now
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:44.120]  Well, listen, why don't you just become an artist and put and let the voices tell you what to paint
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  And I'm sure everything will turn out okay
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:53.960]  Of course now you get real voices where Obama breaks in on your phone with text messages and videos and breaks in on the radio
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:03:00.280]  And we all are hearing government voices. Tell us that George Washington is bad. God bless you. Good to hear from me, Sarah

[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.280]  um
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:19.000]  I just want to let you know that you're absolutely right about everything you're saying and it's insane the way they prescribe these medications
[02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:20.840]  Upon a mission
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:22.840]  It's a 10 minute interview with a doctor
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:27.160]  Before they know exactly what they want to put you on and you're on it and there's no
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:32.920]  Refusing it once you're on it. They will strap you down and shoot you up with it if you don't if you won't take it by mouth
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:35.720]  and um
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:37.720]  also, we take some uh
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:41.320]  people that are withdrawn from just substance abuse
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:46.680]  And they check yourselves into a regular hospital and they're railroaded into a mental facility
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:48.600]  um
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:50.600]  And everyone's put on psychotropic
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:54.440]  medication. Well, you know the story. You know where heroin came from right?
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:56.760]  right
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.760]  At the end of the civil war
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:02.600]  Everybody's addicted to opium. You know hundreds of thousands of arms and legs saw it off
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:08.920]  Uh, we we've got something to get some off of it. It's like 10 times stronger. It's a derivative of it. It's called heroin
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:13.320]  So that's what they do now. It's like, oh, you you have a cocaine problem here
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:19.400]  Let's put you on five psychotropics. They're 20 times more deadly, you know immediately. Absolutely. So that's what you're saying
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:24.520]  Yeah, it's like a revolving door after that. They're in and out of it. Um
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:30.840]  There's uh altercations every day because of these medications and and forcing the meds
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:35.960]  It's just ridiculous. But then but then the answer is more meds though because it causes problems
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:39.160]  Right, and they're always changing them up after they get in there
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:39.880]  They might be up
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:44.200]  They might start off with like three medications and by the time they leave they might be on five to seven
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:50.680]  And of course, let me guess because I've seen the statistics. How many of the inmates running the asylum are on drugs themselves
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:53.640]  um
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:55.640]  Probably 60%
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:05:00.040]  Wow, stay there. I want to hear more from you and stay there and then congressman jones is coming up

[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:32.280]  Well, he warned obama last year and introduced the legislation that if the president
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:42.600]  Launched any more military operations in foreign countries without congressional approval that they were going to start impeachment
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:51.320]  And of course, he's representative walter b jones who were very honored to have joining us here on the broadcast
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:54.120]  And he is the congressman hailing from
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:57.800]  North carolina and he's been all over the national news
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:02.920]  The last month or so as citizens have called for obama's impeachment
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:05.640]  over saying that he is
[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:10.120]  Uh going to launch a war in syria without congressional approval now he backed off
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:12.120]  A couple weeks ago as you know
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:18.920]  And now the media is trying to spin it like oh, don't let the russians tell us what to do. No, it's the constitution
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:21.480]  That's telling us what to do
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:24.280]  And if we don't impeach obama
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:28.120]  Uh for for trying to launch the war without approval and kerry saying that he didn't need it
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:34.440]  What about the associated press reporting obama waves ban on arming terrorists to allow aid to syrian
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:37.160]  Opposition and here's the new american article
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:41.000]  President breaks arms export laws to send shipments to syria rebels
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:43.560]  uh, joe wolverton
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:45.400]  Got it right
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:51.400]  Because how can you how can the president say he has an uh a a a presidential order not even executive order
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:54.520]  blocking federal law on arming al nazar, uh
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:59.880]  Which is commanded by the head of al qaeda who called to attack the us last week
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:03.960]  So i've thrown out a few points here of why i think obama
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:06.440]  Um, we should start impeachment now
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:08.520]  uh
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:10.360]  so that
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:16.120]  They're unable to start a war that some analysts say could lead to a larger regional war or even a world war three with 11
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:20.760]  Russian ships massing. I'm no fan of Assad, but compared to al qaeda. He's pretty much an angel
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:23.400]  uh ron paul ran paul
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:26.760]  Senator cruz as well have all said it looks like a false flag
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:30.680]  Pat Buchanan said that rush limbaugh said that i see an awakening happens
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:36.120]  I want to ask the congressman that as well jones dot house dot gov is his website to see his updates
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:38.520]  And sir, we thank you for your leadership and courage
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:42.520]  It seems as mark twain said in the beginning of patriots a scarce man
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:49.720]  Hated and feared and scorned but in time when his cause succeeds the tim had joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:52.280]  I think we're seeing an awakening
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:55.400]  And i want you to have the floor and talk about whatever you think is most important
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:11:02.120]  But what do you think's happened with this serious situation and and do you think this is a sign that people are starting to wake up sir?
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:07.320]  Alex thank you very much for the opportunity and the introduction and and you're
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:13.000]  Reciting your position and history as well. So let me start by saying uh
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:18.600]  I had started my feelings about going overseas sending our young men and women to die
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:21.240]  In the unnecessary war known as iraq
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:25.240]  Okay, when mr. Obama became the president of the united states
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:32.600]  Uh, he indicated he wanted to bring the troops out of iraq. I supported that uh, personally and secondly
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:36.200]  But then he decided to stay in afghanistan
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:43.560]  Uh for the length of 12 years to 2014 and possibly you know, but not maybe all your listeners know
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:50.440]  We're in the process of signing a bilateral strategic agreement with karzai to be there for 10 more years
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:52.440]  10 more years after 2014
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:56.600]  And yes, you will reduce the number of troops but god help those that are staying there
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:02.360]  Now let me go back to the issue of why I feel like impeachment of any president not just obama
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:07.320]  I want to be fair about it any president that bypasses congress and the constitution
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:12.200]  To bomb another country who really is not a threat such as libya
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.280]  The president said he called the leadership of the house
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:23.720]  Well, I want to inform the president that 435 members of the house and and also remind the president that 100 senators
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:29.400]  And just because you elect leadership in the senate in the house, they don't make the decision for everybody
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:35.320]  Uh, and when he bombed libya, if you remember this ron paul denizka senesh myself
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:41.480]  And three other democrats in republics. It's three and three. We went to the federal courts with johnathan turley
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:46.920]  We and our attorney because we felt that there was a distinct violation of the constitution
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:54.120]  And the court says they always do they threw it out because they said well, you can stop a war by voting no to fund award
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:59.880]  Well, that's a pipe dream to say the least. So when I looked at what was happening after libya
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:05.320]  Uh, kadafi was an evil man, but for god's sakes. We got evil people all around the world
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:09.400]  Are we supposed to police the world? We can't pay our own bills. We can't police our own borders
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:16.120]  There's got to be some sanity to this these foreign policies of any administration and particularly this one now
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:21.640]  So I was ready and still ready to file a articles of impeachment
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:23.640]  But I was based in mind on
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:29.240]  The issue of bypassing the constitution and bypassing congress to bomb another country
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:31.800]  And uh in the temporary
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:37.480]  In the short term, excuse me, uh, the russians have helped the president by putting a stall on where we are
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:43.400]  But there are many in both parties and I want to be fair about that alex both parties that are very concerned
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:48.760]  That as this moves forward that we might wake up one day and we've been dropping missiles in Syria
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:52.120]  Uh, and you're absolutely right that you cannot
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:14:00.120]  Totally decide about the rebels. They're so mixed up with different groups within the rebel cause that we don't know
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:03.880]  Who's our friend and our enemy and al qaeda is definitely our enemy
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:12.680]  Undoubtedly there's a new jane's weapons quarterly report out saying that at least half of them are hardcore jihadis
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:20.760]  And basically al qaeda because al qaeda basically will end up killing anybody that doesn't convert to their radical form of islam
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:24.680]  Well alex, this is the whole thing why I I think
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:26.920]  sincerely that
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:30.040]  With this we had testimony. I'm on the armed services committee
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:34.600]  We had testimony from the service chiefs the army navy marine corps air force
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:39.320]  Uh, if sequestration uh continues, we'll know the year. We're just about going to
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:46.920]  Put the military in a situation where they're going to be limited in being able to fight to protect america
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:52.200]  But I go back to the issue that you had me on today. Uh, I believe in the constitution
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:57.160]  I'm a ron paul type person when it comes to foreign aid. I'm just sick and tired of america
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:01.080]  Thinking that uh, we can borrow money from foreign governments and pump up other
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:03.400]  I mean look look at carzai
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:09.960]  I mean he is his family's in the drug business and we're spending him roughly six to seven million dollars a month
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:12.280]  To prop him up
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:15.800]  And here we're going to have a vote tomorrow to cut food stamps for the american people
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:19.560]  Particularly those that need it. I know there's abuse in and a lot of federal programs
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:22.680]  But there's no abuse in funding carzai and he's a crook
[02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:27.560]  You're right. I mean the country is going into a depression by every metric. We've got economic numbers
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:33.640]  Uh out today. Obamacare is coming in now. Now. I want to give you a chance to talk about some of the things you think are most important
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:40.600]  Sorry, but what about specifically? I mean, obama did blink and you talk about bipartisan. I do see a big awakening
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:47.000]  Happening right now. We're bipartisan 91 of americans and a reuters poll are against the strike
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:53.640]  75 percent in a army times poll of active duty say that are against it. I can't find any military
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:58.440]  I know that are active duty that are for it. What are your constituents? What are the military people you're talking to?
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:00.760]  What are they saying about?
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:07.960]  The popularity of this war and and how big a deal is it that we saw the president finally have to back off
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:14.040]  And admit that congress has to be consulted but then flip back and say but if you don't vote for what I want
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:17.880]  I can still strike. What will you do if he strikes without congressional authority?
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:23.400]  I would tell you this that if he strikes without a vote of the congress, you will see both parties
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:27.880]  I mean this sincerely both parties filed articles of impeachment
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:33.240]  Because we are sick and tired of a president be republican or democrat
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:40.920]  To bypass the constitution and the members of congress who who swear to uphold the constitution to bomb a foreign country
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:46.840]  We are a debtor nation. We cannot even pay our bills without raising the debt ceiling of america
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:49.240]  So we can borrow money to pay last year's bills
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:55.640]  This whole place up here is out of control and when you come to foreign policy as ron paul would say let's wake up
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:58.280]  Let's rebuild america and the hell with the rest of the world
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.520]  I agree with that
[02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:07.160]  So if obama or any other president tries to launch these preemptive wars these offensive criminal wars
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:12.040]  You're going to move for impeachment and and again for the folks that don't know the media spends it and says
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:16.120]  The president's allowed to respond to the war powers. Yeah, if russians have fired missiles
[02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:22.040]  Then congress has given the authority to defend against it or fire back or if we are attacked we know who does it
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:25.960]  Then he has the automatic default, but not to go attack a country
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:30.040]  That that's done nothing to us. I mean that's a war crime
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:34.920]  Alex thank you. You took the words wide out of my mouth that in a natural way
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:37.880]  You took the words wide out of my mouth that international courts
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:43.480]  In my humble opinion would be encouraged to to go to the court system because a
[02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:50.120]  Nation be america or someone else who is not threatened. Let's make that clear to your listeners not threatened
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.560]  To involve itself in a civil war
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:59.720]  And it's like I said recently in the interview. Yes, I think it's horrible when people are gassed
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:06.360]  But I think it's hard horrible when they hit by a fragments of a bomb because it kills them just as dead as the gas does
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.840]  Well said absolutely. Well, listen, we've only got about eight nine minutes left for you
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:16.280]  We're going to skip this network break congressman Walter Jones of north carolina joins us now that ron paul's gone
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:20.200]  More and more in the house. He is he has taken his place. He's been there for many years
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:23.560]  But but but really really snow. You've been stepping up. We see you a lot
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:29.880]  Uh, really turning up the heat on these tyrants so much more is happening as we learn that obama care
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:36.280]  Even the wall street journal admits and even abc news has admitted eight taxes on the poor the supreme court rules
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:37.800]  It is a tax on the poor
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:44.920]  I have family that obama care is going to bankrupt a lot of them are veterans that you know work at 12 dollar an hour jobs and things
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:52.440]  Uh, what are your constituents saying about obama care and what about the move we're seeing house to vote on defunding obama care?
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:54.520]  What can we do to shut this down?
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:59.560]  And what was the power structure thinking because I knew what this bill was three years ago
[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:03.080]  You know what it was right? It is a america health care system
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:09.720]  Killing america bankrupting system in my view. What is your view congressman? Well? I'm with you a hundred percent
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:15.800]  I was no republican voted for the obama care that came through the house when miss pelosi was the speaker
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:20.600]  We've had 39 or 40 votes already in the house to defund
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:23.880]  Uh to change certain aspects of obama care
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:30.440]  We will probably tomorrow the next day vote on the continuing resolution that will defund obama care
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:35.800]  We will probably pass that bill in the house and you probably have a few democrats to vote for it
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:41.560]  This is what we need to if we could win real quickly if we could win the senate
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:50.040]  The best I've ever seen the american people to have the best government believe this or not was bill clinton was the president
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:57.320]  We had the house was republican and the senate was republican and newt could get things done for the american people
[02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:01.640]  Because look at it this way alex the president wanted to get things done
[02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:05.400]  But he could not get it through the house and the senate unless they agreed to help
[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:09.640]  The house and senate wanted things done, but they needed the president to sign the bill
[02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:11.640]  We got things done for the american people
[02:20:12.520 --> 02:20:15.800]  And that's the frustration up here now if we could win the senate
[02:20:16.440 --> 02:20:24.040]  And the next election and have the house and the senate we could do a lot of major changes to obama care for the good of american people
[02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:31.400]  Well, you know i've been critical of the establishment republicans like carl rove, but you see him on fox news every week criticizing
[02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:37.480]  uh ron paul ran paul yourself ted cruise they're upset that real constitutional libertarian
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:44.200]  Just american types who are real men i mean i know ron paul i know ran paul well we've interviewed met cruise
[02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:47.640]  I feel like i know you interviewing you a dozen times or so you're real people
[02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:55.240]  And i think the power structure is scared that there is a revolution happening in the republican party and as matt drudge has said
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:57.880]  2014 is everything
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:00.600]  That's why they're going after the media the free speech
[02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:06.200]  They're trying to break this country and collectivize it now and get rid of the borders and everything else
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:09.160]  Because the collectivists know their time is short
[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:13.400]  Well, alex if we could win the senate has only four or five seats
[02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:16.360]  And hold the house and we should be able to hold the house
[02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:22.520]  Uh, i promise you we would be in the strongest position we've been in in a number of years and mr. obama
[02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:25.880]  Would have to deal with the house and that in itself
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:32.120]  Puts us on even playing field instead of having a president who's a democrat the senate is a democrat
[02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:39.080]  That would put the american people on an on an even keel to make some changes to what i think is probably the
[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:44.280]  Worst legislation i've ever seen i thought uh leave no child behind was one of the worst
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:48.680]  Fills that ever seen but i can tell you obama carry in my opinion
[02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:51.160]  Uh, would just bank rub america
[02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:55.800]  Well, my dad is a physician and he's he's quitting um next month
[02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:00.600]  Uh, he he's quitting over it. Uh, about a half people. He knows they're retiring early
[02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:04.440]  Uh, in fact, it's in the texas. It's been in the texas news
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:12.200]  The if you make one mistake on a chart you go to jail automatically. There's no judge no jury
[02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:15.800]  I mean this is designed to destroy american health care
[02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:19.720]  So some say we'll let them implement it that'll destroy collectivism forever
[02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:23.800]  No, no, no they plan to implode the country and then pose as saviors
[02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:28.280]  We've got to stop the implementation because even though it would show how bad they are
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:31.640]  Uh, it's immoral to let this thing go in
[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:34.360]  You're right alex you're exactly right
[02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:37.560]  This should be about doing what is right for the country
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:44.840]  Uh and not politics and what we do is right for the country is restore the constitutional right of the american people
[02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:53.480]  What are your constituents most upset about right now because again, i'm a radio host and i've got my finger on the pulse this country is
[02:22:53.480 --> 02:23:00.920]  10 times more elected than they were in say 1993 94. I mean, this is beyond anger. This is eye of the tiger
[02:23:01.400 --> 02:23:05.880]  Focused i'm here to tell the establishment people are not going to put up with it anymore
[02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:11.480]  Well alex i have said many times and i think that two or three senators you've named one or two
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:16.120]  And your conversation last couple minutes. We we need a ron paul
[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:21.480]  Ross perotipe leader for this country. We need somebody to get in there and to say listen
[02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:26.520]  You want to attack america? You're gonna get the big bombers coming over and they're gonna blow you to kingdom come
[02:23:26.840 --> 02:23:31.720]  We need somebody to start fixing the problems here in america and to hell with the rest of the world
[02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:36.920]  Why are we sending this money to carzai who's who's a crook and and we can't account for half the money
[02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:42.680]  We're sending him the wars in african afghanistan have already cost this country over 1.5
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:46.760]  trillion dollars that averaged it out to about 11 million dollars an hour
[02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:54.600]  Well said congressman, so what do you expect because you've got your to the ground on the arm services committee
[02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:58.840]  Where obama says okay? I've got to go to congress from the constitution doing a 180
[02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:03.640]  Thanks to your pressure and others, but you spearheading it. We've got to give credit where it's due not to give credit
[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:07.000]  But to show that doing the right thing, you know, you were pretty lonely a year ago
[02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:13.080]  Now you've got the majority republicans and democrats nationally openly supporting you and are being recognized for that
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:19.000]  Now, what do you expect him to do when he doesn't get the authorization and kerry says we're still going to attack
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:21.400]  Is is that a bluff or are they going to back off?
[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:25.800]  Well, I hope it would be a bluff because it truthfully they're just as many democrats
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:31.400]  They're more liberal that against the war for other reasons than maybe you and I are opposed to it
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:37.560]  Ours is based on the constitution, but I can tell you if by chance that did happen what you just described
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:41.800]  There would be a number of articles of impeachment introduced
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:43.800]  By both sides in the house
[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:45.960]  Wow
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:47.960]  Any idea on when they're going to try to
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:52.840]  I mean they've backed off a vote obviously to not embarrass the furor. I mean the president
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:57.080]  Any idea on because you're on the service committee, obviously, sir
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:25:02.920]  And no more than anybody when they're going to try to creep back in and try to get a vote or or or where is the war right now?
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:08.600]  Well, it I'm afraid our leadership in the house is not going to bring a vote or on Syria
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:13.240]  Uh to the floor until we find out over the next two to three weeks
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:16.120]  What is maybe going to happen with the negotiations?
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:18.760]  I think we should have last week
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:24.200]  The house should have brought the bill to the floor to be debated debated and a vote up or down
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:28.920]  Just to show that the will of the house is no to bombing Syria
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:33.800]  Sir, we've only got three minutes left. I appreciate your time. I wanted to ask you about the uh,
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:38.840]  Navy yard shooting, uh, two and a half days ago in a double secure area
[02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:44.600]  They got hearing voices playing 18 hours of video games on drugs under psychiatric care
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:51.720]  And now obama says I need to give my guns up and pierce morgan because because in a gun-free zone
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:56.600]  This mentally ill person went haywire when overall gun crimes down 49
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:03.000]  What is your take on that sir and then any other points you think are important on other subjects that are front and center on your radar?
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:04.360]  well
[02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:05.480]  Alex
[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:12.040]  If a person is going to commit mayhem, they will get whatever they need. I hate to say that but it is true
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:19.080]  So you cannot punish the law abiding citizen who is following his constitutional rights
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:22.120]  Because it's not going to stop those who want to
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.320]  To commit crime. It's just not going to stop it
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:29.000]  Uh, I think we need to do more in the area of mental health
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.480]  But that's really a state issue with uh, some assistance from the national government
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:37.800]  But we we need to start doing more in the states to help people with uh,
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:39.160]  middle problems
[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:44.760]  We've got men and women coming back from afghanistan and iraq with uh PTSD and tbi
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:47.400]  But uh, you you cannot
[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:52.520]  Violate the second amendment right of law abiding citizens. It just won't fix the problem
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:58.840]  I agree with you. Uh, other important issues like trying to open the borders up other things that are going on
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:03.000]  What else is on your radar? Sorry. You got three minutes. I'd like to get some closing comments
[02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:06.680]  Well, I the house is moving very slow on the uh,
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:10.520]  Senate bill is not really the senate bill the house will have its own version
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:19.080]  Of the bill dealing with the emigrate immigration issue. Um, I'm this way. Uh, I am not voting to
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:26.440]  Raise the debt ceiling with alex. We've raised the debt ceiling 18 times since 1993
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:29.000]  All that does to for your listeners
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:35.560]  All it does is allow america to go to foreign governments and borrow more money to pay last year's bills
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:39.480]  We don't ever say no. We always are saying we will
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:44.680]  We'll find some way to spend more money. We need to stop it. It is not fair to
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:51.640]  To our children and grandchildren. What does the washington elite think they're going to do when every economist says we're already destroyed?
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:53.880]  Well, these people are crazy
[02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:57.720]  Well, I agree with them. I mean, I am glad to say that
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:04.840]  The syrian issue brought people making phone calls. We had over 435 phone calls to my office
[02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:07.080]  We had over a thousand emails
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:13.160]  97 of those contacting our office by email or by telephone said no to syria
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:17.160]  Let the voices of the people be heard because that's the only way
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:21.800]  They the american people can take back their government. It's let their voices be heard
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:27.560]  What is wrong with the political elite that just think everything's going to be fine forever
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:35.960]  Are they disconnected from reality congressman jones? Well, ron paul said it better than anything that we can continue to dream
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:37.720]  But at some point
[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:40.760]  We're going to see a nightmare because the dream is not real
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:44.680]  Well, sir, I want to say this in closing to you for my family. Thank you
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:49.160]  For taking the leadership the last two years when obama was more popular

[02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:54.760]  To uh, because you know look at libya a couple years ago
[02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:58.280]  They just did it and told you guys to go to hell and now they're having to listen

[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:36.600]  Because I've got a Don Salazar doing a whole story on it right now
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:41.800]  I'll just give people background because we posted a great article about it and I knew it was real because I'd seen it before
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:45.480]  When it first got published by the people that took the photos
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:51.240]  About a month ago, but but people were like all this isn't real. Oh, so I said, you know what go to the original author
[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:54.680]  Give them a whole background do a story on it. So we're going to be doing that
[02:36:54.920 --> 02:37:00.600]  Here's some of the news up on info wars.com Fox news demonizes second amendment activist
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.600]  That's right with friends like that who needs a commie liberals
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:08.520]  video shows syrian rebels firing chemical weapons a new video
[02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:12.520]  Unbelievable that coincided with the august 21st attack
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:17.240]  Yeah, the UN says chemical weapons have used 14 times. I knew about three times
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:19.960]  I mean, it's just unbelievable these rebels
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:25.880]  Talk about scary man watching these videos. They've got these kids lined up. Mcgrain was showing me like 10 year old kids
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:30.120]  and one of us begging uncle uncle no uncle and
[02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:38.840]  They've got translated from arabic and they shoot them and they go don't f with al qaeda
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:44.760]  And another one's begging and they go we told you we're al qaeda. You don't mess with us and just shooting
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:49.960]  And I mean chopping up little girls and and the weird eyes these people have
[02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:53.960]  I mean, I've seen a lot of arab fighters and some of them look, you know, quite handsome or smart
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:59.400]  Depending on what group they're with you you look at these fighters, you know, just just like you can see a cop and say that guy
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:05.480]  Looks like a thug they look crazy their eyes look demonic, but not even powerful. It's like they're sunk in and
[02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:09.400]  Possessed is what I've got. I mean the al qaeda guys really look sick
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:15.560]  And I'll tell you why they're they're criminals from all over the middle east and and and central asia and the caucuses
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:17.800]  that just like to rape and kill
[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:23.400]  And they get authorization from Saudi Arabia to go do it. Uh, I don't mean to go off of this. I said I take your calls
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:27.160]  I was watching them kill women and children last night
[02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:31.800]  Because we've really gone deep into their video stuff. You've never I mean you don't want to see this
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:36.600]  But I asked McBreen. I said, why are you doing this? This is not going in Obama deception
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:37.800]  too
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:44.360]  I want some of them killing people with al qaeda flags chanting death to America so people understand our government's funding them
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:47.560]  But and he's like, well, I think it's important this be seen and I'm like
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:52.280]  And then they'll have some other kid bleeding the death on the I just got to turn it off
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:57.640]  I can't look at it anymore. But in a way, I know it makes McBreen sick. He's got children
[02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:01.880]  He's working in hospitals who says he knows how to turn it off
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:04.520]  but
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:06.520]  I guess we all do need to see this I
[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:08.680]  Because people that are supporting this
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:14.360]  Need to know what war looks like and war is bad enough if you've been attacked and got to fight back
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:19.720]  But man, when you go out and you fund al qaeda who've got to be the most sickening
[02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:24.440]  Disgusting filthy scum. I got to be honest with you. I'm gonna be honest right here
[02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:27.080]  My instincts as a man
[02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:29.160]  Is to go to Syria and fight these people
[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:34.360]  I just when I see him chopping up an eight-year-old girl with a machete as she screams for her mama
[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:37.000]  It makes me hate their guts. It's like those cops that
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:40.680]  Torture for 20 minutes the schizophrenic man as he begs for daddy
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:47.240]  I have real feelings there here and the guy go daddy daddy and they know they're killing them
[02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:52.360]  And and then I look at these but at least with the cops. It's black and white night footage
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:59.160]  I can't see their eyes when you see the al qaeda getting off on this. It just freaks me out. It really gets to me
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:04.440]  There I'm almost having flashbacks watching that footage because see
[02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:07.640]  You watch some violence in a movie. It's kind of oh, yeah
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:12.280]  I mean when I was a kid I could watch violent movies. It was okay now that I know more about it
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:17.720]  I thought evil dead the the remake was a comedy like the original that I was a fan of
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:25.160]  It was not a comedy and I and I could handle them chopping people's arms off with electric knives and stuff, but
[02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:29.800]  I've seen enough real stuff like that and car wrecks but also in film
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:32.840]  That it was making me almost threw up
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:38.280]  Because we ate a hamburger. I ordered a big greasy hamburger at Alamo draft house me my dad went and saw it
[02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:43.000]  He goes, I remember that comedy. Yeah, I'd see that with you and I'm sitting there and was well done movie by the way
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.880]  But it was just like now that I know what evil is I literally almost threw up when I left
[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:49.800]  People like oh, don't be a wimp you can handle that no
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:54.680]  I mean I've seen too many arms and legs blown off and little kids with their lower mandible blown off
[02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:58.680]  And they've got a columbian necktie with the tongue flapping around as they as they go
[02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:03.160]  You're saying mama
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:07.960]  What are you telling mama whatever it sounds like mama
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.080]  And it's like they're looking like why did this happen to me?
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:13.960]  And and and I'll tell you a brief story then go to your phone calls
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:18.200]  Rob do and I with his kids and and and my children
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:22.120]  My 10 year old my 9 year old my 5 year old
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:26.920]  We we go down to Sam Marcus to go tubing before it gets too cold beautiful river
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:33.000]  Amazing wildlife saw hawks a hawk 10 feet away in a tree never seen one of red till that close
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:36.920]  It wasn't in captivity saw a big blue heron. It was just a magic day
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:41.160]  We get down there about 10 a.m. We were there till about two then I came back Sunday into the radio show
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:44.200]  30 minutes away from Austin
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:48.440]  And I've been there before and I knew when you got to the end where we were stopping these big cypress trees
[02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:51.960]  There's three little shoots. They're not waterfalls. They're just
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:54.920]  Barely even having any degree to them
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:42:02.840]  But my 5 year old was in my lap. She wanted to get in the you know with me in my tube. My tube wasn't completely inflated
[02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:07.960]  I think do foul hole in it later. And so she's on my lap. So it's kind of bogged down
[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:12.840]  And we go down it and I mean it's no big deal. It's
[02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:17.800]  And then the next two are just so small. It's like three feet deep there. It's no big deal
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:20.680]  literally no danger she was in a
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:24.920]  Live jacket
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:28.920]  And we go over and as we hit where the water's coming down
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:35.960]  She bobs out and flies out of my lamp because I told her hold on to the handle. She didn't she lets go pops out
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  Goes about two feet of the water
[02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:43.560]  She's a great swimmer, but I still had her in a life jacket. Obviously she bobs under bobs back up
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:47.800]  And she's the baby of them all of all the kids I've had she's the sweetest the most innocent
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:50.840]  And she started and I could and I grab her and I'm about three feet
[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:54.280]  But I'm grabbing her we go over to rock and she was so scared and crying
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:43:00.120]  But not even crying loud like really genuinely scared and I talked her into going over the next two little rapids
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:03.480]  So she'd get over her fear. She didn't laugh and then did it again and got over it
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:05.640]  But I thought about
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:09.800]  How I don't have any real fear myself. I've gotten to the point where I don't even just have any fear
[02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:13.000]  It's almost like a handicap except for my children
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:19.320]  And it was imagining the innocence of a five-year-old and people that could hurt little children
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:25.400]  And then I think about the cps and the government and the system and how they hurt them through the drugs and everything
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:32.040]  These criminals camouflage their abuse, but they know what they're doing and I thought about then the rebels killing little kids
[02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:34.920]  I saw like we're a four-year-old girl
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.040]  They they tied her up in wire before they tortured her to death
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:41.320]  And all the stuff I've watched and it's just like man
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:45.320]  They just you cannot believe how evil this world is
[02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:47.320]  And
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:53.160]  How in feluja they leveled almost the whole city and killed tens of thousands of women and children and the marines
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:59.560]  I've seen videos of them making jokes or shooting up vehicles full of men women and children and and and laughing about dead kids
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:03.800]  Versus other videos of marines and armies saving kids and stuff
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:09.480]  But I don't know how you'd be in the military and watch somebody joke about killing a kid. I mean I'd want to attack them
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:13.000]  I just no wonder these people come home and freak out and and
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.880]  And commit suicide and all the rest of it. I just
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:20.760]  Just watching this war footage has started to really get to me
[02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:25.400]  I mean it is just unbelievable, but I got to say I've seen a lot of footage of the worst of our groups
[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:27.560]  It is not one
[02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:29.560]  10th of al-qaeda. I mean al-qaeda
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:33.560]  I just cannot I got to be honest. I never really watched the jihadi videos
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:36.360]  I've never really watched them over the years and I've been watching
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:40.440]  Hundreds of them and I mean it's unbelievable these people
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:46.840]  It is unbelievable the stuff they do and to know our government is funding the whole stinking thing
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:51.320]  It's just you ever wonder if the government's bad folks. Here's the proof. Okay, the government is bad
[02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:55.480]  They're attacking our families. They're attacking our country our sovereignty everything
[02:44:56.280 --> 02:45:01.720]  We have psychopathic dirt bags running things and they've got to be dealt with folks
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:04.520]  Let's go to your calls truth raider
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.320]  Uh in oregon. Thanks for holding her on the air
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:09.320]  Hi, alex
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:13.720]  You know, I have a unique testimony about the pharmaceuticals, but before I get to that
[02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:17.720]  Let me tell you about what happened. I haven't had a chance to tell you about this back in december
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:21.240]  We had the clackamas town shopping mall
[02:45:21.880 --> 02:45:24.200]  Shooting that with that occurred. I remember that I went there
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:29.560]  Right. I went there within 48 hours to investigate it myself
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:35.560]  Not any shred of any kind of evidence that anything happened there
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:37.720]  There was no media
[02:45:38.440 --> 02:45:42.520]  No heightened security. No police. No boarded up windows
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:46.520]  Full parking lot plenty of shoppers everyone is happy
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:50.600]  Singing carols and doing their shopping men, women and children and teenagers
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:53.320]  nothing at all
[02:45:54.280 --> 02:45:56.280]  Now let me get on to the
[02:45:57.080 --> 02:45:58.760]  psychotropic
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:00.760]  My testimony about what what occurred
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:03.320]  My father was a psychiatrist
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:05.320]  And this is over 30 years ago
[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:10.440]  My dad had samplers. He kept them in his drawer in his office
[02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:16.600]  And we had an open residence where the living room in his office blended into the kitchen in the dining room
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:18.200]  So I went in
[02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:20.200]  I was having some anxiety issues
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:22.760]  I was about ready to go to college. So I was nervous about that
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:31.080]  So I took a sampler. Yeah, I think we've all I think we've all dug through our parents medicine cabinet one time
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:34.040]  Uh, when I was about 14 my parents had some
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:36.200]  Valium or something
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:40.200]  Uh, and I uh, it was the first time I ever saw it in their medicine cabinet. He always did draw all their stuff
[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:44.520]  I remember taking a couple of those and then they took me out to El Chico after church. I took them at church
[02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:49.880]  And I mean literally thought I was going to fall asleep at the El Chico my dad's like what's wrong with you
[02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:52.440]  I go I took two of those valium. He goes you idiot
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:54.920]  Uh, but uh, I'm sorry go ahead
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:57.880]  Well, I wish that's all it was Alex
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:46:59.800]  I mean for a week
[02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:05.240]  I thought I was going to die. I took a tablet called howl doll which is about the size of a baby
[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:09.880]  I mean just an itty bitty tiny little pill maybe two milligrams of howl doll
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000]  And let me tell you I mean
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:19.640]  You wish you had the flu you wish you had anything but that kind of an experience. I couldn't know I couldn't keep my eyes open
[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:23.960]  Uh, I mean I couldn't sleep. I couldn't I couldn't do anything
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:29.720]  And I I I felt every kaleidoscope of every kind of illness you could ever feel all at one time
[02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:35.720]  I mean totally poison. Can you imagine when a two-year-old or three-year-old cries for mommy?
[02:47:35.720 --> 02:47:40.440]  That's called mental illness and they start putting them on psychotrophics. Can you imagine the abuse?
[02:47:41.160 --> 02:47:44.280]  Meanwhile, you get a medical marijuana card. They now take your kids
[02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:47.800]  Yeah, that's totally insane totally bogus
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:54.120]  This is all there's a whole structure of the medical system needs to be overhauled. It's a Rockefeller dominated
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:58.040]  You know, it is it is no no no no they set it up. God bless you
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:03.240]  They set it up. You're absolutely on target people that don't know nelson and georgia. Thanks for holding it on the air
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:06.200]  Well, Alex hey buddy
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:07.160]  Hey, man
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:10.920]  I'm a guitar teacher here in north georgia and I teach underprivileged kids
[02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:13.560]  and one side of my school has uh
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:18.200]  the black kids and the white kids and the other side's spanish kids and
[02:48:19.240 --> 02:48:20.200]  uh
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:26.360]  The spanish kids they don't take any of those drugs and they can learn seven eight chords in 20 minutes
[02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:30.760]  When I have to seven weeks to teach them three chords on the other side
[02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:34.200]  It's horrible what they're doing. They got them on that attention. Yep
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:38.920]  It's it's the black kids and the white kids are the ones that are being cps that are being druged
[02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:44.760]  Uh, Hispanics whether they're legal or citizens or not. They just run with their kids and they have these ads going
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:49.640]  It's terrible. The Hispanics won't go on the welfare. The Hispanics don't trust the government
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:51.400]  Yeah, because they're not idiots
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:54.280]  And and in literally what you say on average is true
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:59.080]  That they target blacks because that's a grip. They've always been able to feed on and then whites go
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:04.360]  Oh, the government wants to drug my kid. How trendy and uh, yeah from what I've heard. That's what goes on
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:11.960]  Yeah, and also my mother got on the prozac about eight years ago lost her business
[02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:18.280]  Uh, does not want to deal with society at all. And if I bring up the fact, hey, it's the drugs
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:23.560]  That's you know making this making you feel this way. She kicks me out of her house every single time
[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:28.520]  And hangs up on me when we're on the phone and there's one more point I'd like to make
[02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:35.640]  I'm up here in north Georgia in Calhoun, Georgia and I'm a I'm a solo acoustic musician and I play out all the time
[02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:42.440]  And I'm looking for other people in my area to start a group because I try to get I'd be with my city hall to start an

[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:50.840]  And to the people because that's where all the problems lies in our health
[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:57.640]  And uh, so if anybody wants to feel strongly as I do about this. My name is Nelson Williams and I'm a

[02:57:54.080 --> 02:58:00.000]  One hundred and one million on some farm of food assistance or one third of the country. So that number

[03:00:34.240 --> 03:00:36.240]  I started rereading that tv news piece

[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:43.200]  Hello
[03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:45.840]  Hello, welcome. Yes, ma'am. Hi, alex
[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:47.200]  Hi
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:49.200]  I've had an experience
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:52.720]  About seven years ago. Uh, kind of a nervous breakdown
[03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:54.560]  Some would call it
[03:01:54.560 --> 03:02:01.840]  But I don't you have a nervous break up into energized crazed luscious life. How about that? How's that sound?
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.640]  Yeah, that's happened now seven years later. Good
[03:02:05.680 --> 03:02:09.840]  Good seven years ago. So I had sort of a revelation
[03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:15.920]  Experience, you know, like my mother said that I sounded like a southern preacher. You were born again hard
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:22.080]  Hard it was very traumatic actually, but once I
[03:02:22.080 --> 03:02:23.600]  I
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:27.280]  Just found God, I guess I felt really safe and secure
[03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:32.160]  But I was rounded up and brought into a hospital where they put me on a bunch of different drugs
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:34.240]  Respiratone
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:39.840]  Crasps, so you had a religious experience and said you loved God and they thought that was mentally ill
[03:02:40.640 --> 03:02:47.440]  Yep. Yes, absolutely. Well, it's cultural cultural context plays a part in diagnosis too, you know
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:53.200]  And there is no one around by the way spiritual experiences have been recorded for all of human history and are associated
[03:02:53.440 --> 03:02:57.200]  With higher brain waves and creativity. So it's where you want to be
[03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:05.040]  And so I just completely trusted them and let them do all this stuff to me and give me all these drugs and slowly
[03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:10.960]  But surely my mental capacity is just sort of vanished and I felt pretty much lobotomized
[03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:17.760]  Ah, and they they really need to cut break your dignity like that seems like a process since seven years ago
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:20.400]  No, no, no, these are these are drug pushing cults
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:25.280]  Again in some rare cases where somebody already has a chemical imbalance the drugs save them
[03:03:25.680 --> 03:03:29.200]  But most of the time it's because of something you're already eating or doing or hormonal
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:34.960]  That's medical that they need to work on not just here take some chemical weapon. That'll fix you
[03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:43.200]  Totally true. Um, I did have two other episodes since then my last one was almost three years ago now
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:48.080]  But I would call those sort of spiritual crises and because they were sort of
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:53.920]  Well life is supposed to be a crisis people are supposed to freak out sometimes. You're on a planet. It's weird
[03:03:54.320 --> 03:03:58.960]  I mean look at all the crazy stuff around us. It's wild. Go with it. Have a good time
[03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:01.760]  Yeah, don't let it freak you out
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:04.960]  Believe me. I'm you ought to see me all there
[03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:12.640]  They soup you up when you're sort of in a daze and still trying to process what you're going through and
[03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:17.360]  You know drug you and the last time they did this to me
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:22.560]  It was bad, you know every time that they put me on these drugs like the first time when they had me on
[03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:29.680]  Three or four I gained 30 pounds in 30 days. Like it was crazy what it did to my health physically
[03:04:29.680 --> 03:04:37.040]  And so the last time it happened. I just as soon as I got out of the hospital away from them forcing them down your throat
[03:04:37.600 --> 03:04:40.320]  Otherwise, they'll just tackle you and stab you with needles
[03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:43.120]  Well, that's a loving I mean why not?
[03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:48.160]  Well, they don't mind trauma. I mean, what are you against arming al-qaeda with taxpayer paid war weapons?
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:54.560]  And people do this as a job, you know, and they go crazy just tackling people all day for years on end
[03:04:54.560 --> 03:04:59.920]  Well, they like the power though, man. I'm out of time. Thank you so much for your testimony
