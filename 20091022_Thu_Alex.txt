[00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:09.670]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.250]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.811]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:17.013]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.013 --> 00:00:21.056]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:42.403]  Well, there were a few bumps in the road, but we got Fall of the Republic released yesterday.
[00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:45.003]  At around 6 p.m.
[00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:53.466]  Central Standard Time at PrisonPlanet.tv and many many people have downloaded it.
[00:00:53.466 --> 00:01:05.350]  In fact, three times the members that we have at PrisonPlanet.tv have downloaded it, which means that the great members of PrisonPlanet.tv have been sharing their passcode with folks.
[00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.192]  You can share it with up to six people and have six simultaneous
[00:01:10.152 --> 00:01:28.924]  Connections on there and it is a absolutely rip roaring resounding success less than 24 hours into the release I guess about 18 hours into the release of Fall of the Republic.
[00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:35.135]  Just a massive, massive, massive success.
[00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:38.939]  I guess technically 17 hours into the release of the film.
[00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.303]  It is a just resounding success.
[00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:46.346]  The buzz is massive all over the internet.
[00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:54.935]  The overall message that has gotten out there via the wonderful activist listeners is get this film into the hands of everyone.
[00:01:55.874 --> 00:02:00.555]  Make copies of the DVDs that have been shipping out now for three days.
[00:02:00.555 --> 00:02:06.817]  Burn DIVX copies off the DIVX version that you can download at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:06.817 --> 00:02:10.078]  Burn it to CD, burn it to DVD, give it to everyone you know.
[00:02:10.078 --> 00:02:23.082]  The Obama deception obviously was the biggest success in the fight against the globalists we had had so far in my thirteen and a half years at that time of fighting globalists.
[00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:36.791]  Fall of the Republic, Volume 1, the presidency of Barack H. Obama, is shaping up to be, by an order of magnitude, more successful.
[00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:44.455]  And if the Obama deception got us on the White House enemies list, imagine what Fall of the Republic is going to do.
[00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:46.777]  So I want to commend and thank all of you.
[00:02:47.921 --> 00:03:08.524]  I want to open the phones up today about any of the news issues, any of the news items, any questions, any comments you have, the situation with the flu, the situation with the dollar, your review of Fall of the Republic, your emails are pouring in, your phone calls are pouring in, the comments on InfoWars and Prison Planet and the articles are
[00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.271]  Ninety-eight percent positive.
[00:03:12.271 --> 00:03:14.173]  Just absolutely amazing.
[00:03:14.173 --> 00:03:19.376]  We've never seen reviews this good.
[00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:21.497]  And we've gotten a lot of great reviews in the past.
[00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:32.864]  So, again, you go to IMDb and all my other films, on average, have more stars than even major motion pictures.
[00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:43.936]  So we have a very, very high rating for my films on IMDB and certainly that is another bellwether or another...
[00:03:45.205 --> 00:03:54.888]  Another thermometer, basically, into the temperature of the public's mind out there, and people are very, very hot, very, very fired up for Liberty.
[00:03:54.888 --> 00:03:58.369]  The toll-free number to join us on air today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:03.871]  We haven't had him on in a couple months.
[00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:05.871]  He, by the way, is in Follow the Republic.
[00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:07.932]  Trends forecaster Gerald Cilente
[00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:16.920]  Going back three years ago predicted the long fall of the dollar and he said he thought that would happen within the next three to four years.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.462]  He's right on time with that and accurate.
[00:04:19.462 --> 00:04:28.830]  He'll be joining us coming up in the third hour of this radio transmission today but in the balance of the radio broadcast we're going to have open phones and go through these massive
[00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:30.106]  I think?
[00:04:47.663 --> 00:04:53.588]  And go directly into your phone calls right here on the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:59.454]  And again, I want to thank all the supporters and listeners of the show for making Fall of the Republic such a giant success.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.441]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:08.682]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.682 --> 00:05:13.483]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:13.483 --> 00:05:19.864]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:19.864 --> 00:05:22.105]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:22.945]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:22.945 --> 00:05:23.466]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.466 --> 00:05:24.266]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:25.407]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.407 --> 00:05:27.649]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.681]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:48.824]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:48.824 --> 00:05:57.951]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.942]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.942 --> 00:06:09.183]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.183 --> 00:06:14.385]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.385 --> 00:06:17.846]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[00:06:18.486 --> 00:06:20.368]  And they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.368 --> 00:06:25.914]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.914 --> 00:06:35.563]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.683 --> 00:06:38.024]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.024 --> 00:06:39.605]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:42.067]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:44.188]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.188 --> 00:06:49.352]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.352 --> 00:06:58.457]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.828 --> 00:07:09.893]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[00:07:09.893 --> 00:07:19.799]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.

[00:07:54.332 --> 00:07:55.133]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:55.133 --> 00:07:56.275]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:20.950]  It is the 22nd day of October 2009 on this Thursday edition.
[00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:32.138]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the four hours and Top Trends Forecaster Gerald Cilente will be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:08:32.138 --> 00:08:42.726]  I want to throw this out there to the listeners, especially the millions of new listeners that we have tuning in throughout the week.
[00:08:43.832 --> 00:09:10.531]  And to people listening to this radio show on a podcast a month from now, or next year, or someone watching a YouTube video down the road, in the future, I want to throw this out to everyone
[00:09:13.442 --> 00:09:18.503]  Who is tuning in to the radio show.
[00:09:18.503 --> 00:09:34.868]  There can no longer be any doubt about what we're facing as a society.
[00:09:34.868 --> 00:09:35.928]  There can no longer be
[00:09:37.631 --> 00:09:46.017]  Any wiggle room for procrastinating and rationalizing what's going on in this nation and worldwide.
[00:09:46.017 --> 00:09:55.584]  We do have a private consortium of corporations engaging in planetary piracy against free populations.
[00:09:55.584 --> 00:10:02.309]  And the main conduit of robbery and oppression that's being used, the main tool, is government.
[00:10:04.853 --> 00:10:07.274]  World government is upon us.
[00:10:07.274 --> 00:10:11.575]  The Republic, for all intents and purposes, is dead.
[00:10:11.575 --> 00:10:17.516]  Now, we can, anytime we want, stand up as a society and take our nation, our world, back.
[00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:31.219]  But we have to face just how dire the situation is and admit to ourselves just how intellectually bankrupt and thoroughly corrupt the government and corporations that have grown up around it are.
[00:10:35.566 --> 00:10:51.626]  And until we admit that to ourselves, until we face those facts, we are only going to lose more liberty, we are only going to see our standard of living dropping rapidly.
[00:10:52.904 --> 00:11:12.057]  If we can't identify the pirates that are stealing from us and robbing from us and erecting more and more government systems so that they can steal more and more of our wealth, our time, our energy, then society is only going to continue to degenerate.
[00:11:12.057 --> 00:11:16.059]  The United States is becoming a failed state.
[00:11:16.059 --> 00:11:20.843]  Vice President Joe Biden's in the news today saying, for many Americans, this is a depression.
[00:11:20.843 --> 00:11:22.564]  This is a jobless recovery.
[00:11:23.763 --> 00:11:31.654]  The only reason the media is saying we're in a recovery is because the private banks, the private offshore corporations are making record profits.
[00:11:31.654 --> 00:11:40.986]  And the police and the military, who are the enforcers for this private corporate takeover, need to face the fact and look in the mirror and look at the evidence and realize
[00:11:42.054 --> 00:11:57.619]  That the Republic and all the liberties and freedoms for which it stands are being decimated, are being destroyed, are being annihilated, are being abolished and demolished and ruined in front of all of us.
[00:11:58.579 --> 00:12:00.641]  And you have to make the conscious decision.
[00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:07.226]  Are you going to do something about the fact that our republic is being dismantled before our very eyes?
[00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:09.028]  You need to make the conscious decision.
[00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:11.350]  Is this what you want in your own personal life?
[00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.851]  Is this the country you want to live in?
[00:12:14.462 --> 00:12:25.055]  Do you want your children and grandchildren and their progeny to live in a very, very serious high-tech scientific dictatorship?
[00:12:25.055 --> 00:12:26.977]  There is a world government.
[00:12:26.977 --> 00:12:31.103]  It is fraudulent and illegitimate and tyrannical.
[00:12:31.103 --> 00:12:32.004]  It is criminal.
[00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:49.203]  The establishment for decades conditioned the public that there's no government conspiracies and no corporate conspiracies and no forms of corruption and anybody that doesn't trust the government's a kook and anybody that doesn't go along with the system is an extremist or a terrorist.
[00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:51.645]  They did that to precondition the population.
[00:12:52.466 --> 00:13:03.990]  To lower our national immune system to the disease of corruption so that people would think it was fashionable and cool to not be involved in their society.
[00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:11.273]  That people think it's fashionable and cool to give up.
[00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:17.151]  And to have an attitude of there's nothing we can do.
[00:13:17.151 --> 00:13:25.534]  They have sold the idea that being cynical and not caring is the response you're supposed to have to a corrupt society.
[00:13:25.534 --> 00:13:31.116]  No, that only lets the corrupt thieves get more control.
[00:13:31.116 --> 00:13:37.138]  The level of tyranny we're going to live under, as Thomas Jefferson said, is the exact level we're going to put up with.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:52.844]  If you think the corrupt oligarchs we have in place today are bad, if we just give in to them, they will be replaced with even more vicious, more cunning, more abusive, more manipulative, and more sadistic individuals.
[00:13:52.844 --> 00:13:59.086]  And they, in turn, will be replaced with even more corrupt and evil and vicious people.
[00:14:00.458 --> 00:14:02.260]  We know what human history is.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.064]  We know what happens when societies give in to corruption.
[00:14:06.064 --> 00:14:16.176]  Incredible degradation and taxes and regulation and control and enslavement ensues every single time.
[00:14:16.176 --> 00:14:18.699]  It's like if you pour gasoline all over your house,
[00:14:20.382 --> 00:14:30.797]  In the kitchen, in the living room, in your bedrooms, in the bathrooms, on the front porch, on the roof, in the attic, and then you go in with a flamethrower and ignite it, you know what's going to happen.
[00:14:30.797 --> 00:14:32.900]  The house is going to burst into flames.
[00:14:34.554 --> 00:14:36.435]  And that's all that's happening here.
[00:14:36.435 --> 00:14:39.896]  Our nation, our republic, is on fire.
[00:14:39.896 --> 00:14:41.636]  It is burning to the ground.
[00:14:41.636 --> 00:14:51.859]  But any time we want to wake up, get focused, get aggressive, get serious, and start addressing the real shadow government, the National Security Council,
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.501]  that connects into the private central banks.
[00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:20.365]  Anytime we identify these Kinley, Skilling, Madoff type criminals for what they are, the Ben Bernanke's of the world, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the 20 or less big mafia families that run the West and are trying to use our energy, our military, our taxes to fund their planetary takeover.
[00:15:20.985 --> 00:15:42.285]  The minute we realize who the real enemy is and identify these people and pass the word through films and radio shows and pamphlets and books and calls into mainstream talk radio and access TV shows and speeches before the county commissioners and tea parties and lawsuits and grand juries indicting these people,
[00:15:43.346 --> 00:16:03.664]  Once we get that idea in our minds and trumpet that, broadcast that, and ignore the propaganda, the disinfo, the infighting, the COINTELPRO that the system uses to divide us against each other, the minute we figure out the game, and it's really pretty simple, is the minute the New World Order starts falling.
[00:16:03.664 --> 00:16:05.286]  It is that simple.
[00:16:06.578 --> 00:16:10.121]  Now I'm going to go to your calls, and then I'm going to blitz through news throughout the broadcast.
[00:16:10.121 --> 00:16:12.002]  Here are some of the type of headlines I have.
[00:16:12.002 --> 00:16:16.166]  Biden, it's a depression for millions of Americans.
[00:16:16.166 --> 00:16:19.028]  Senate okays bio lab money.
[00:16:19.028 --> 00:16:24.072]  Bill headed to Obama to build bio weapons labs all over the United States.
[00:16:24.072 --> 00:16:25.813]  We're going to tell you what's behind that.
[00:16:25.813 --> 00:16:28.776]  Obama announces help to small banks and businesses.
[00:16:28.776 --> 00:16:30.397]  Yeah, payoffs.
[00:16:30.397 --> 00:16:31.298]  With taxpayer money.
[00:16:32.677 --> 00:16:39.462]  Continuing, I want to get more into Senator Lamar Alexander talking about the White House enemies list.
[00:16:39.462 --> 00:16:42.164]  Reports on the dollars continue to decline.
[00:16:42.164 --> 00:16:48.849]  Ships, planes could cut emissions up to 20%, EU says, by restricting flights and putting taxes on flights.
[00:16:48.849 --> 00:16:49.310]  Bloomberg.
[00:16:51.147 --> 00:16:55.390]  China has a new carbon trading scam they're introducing to Obama.
[00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:01.495]  Grassley warns that HHS website may be government-paid for propaganda and illegal.
[00:17:01.495 --> 00:17:09.902]  Well, what do you think all the fake newscasts and the government paying tens of billions a year to write the scripts for TVs and movies?
[00:17:09.902 --> 00:17:11.944]  For TV, TV and movies.
[00:17:11.944 --> 00:17:13.705]  I mean, that's total Big Brother propaganda.
[00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:14.606]  Totally illegal.
[00:17:14.606 --> 00:17:15.427]  Of course it's illegal.
[00:17:15.427 --> 00:17:16.588]  The U.S.
[00:17:16.588 --> 00:17:18.309]  joins ranks of failed states.
[00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:19.430]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:17:21.601 --> 00:17:25.205]  The Feds and many states want soda taxes.
[00:17:25.205 --> 00:17:27.166]  Taxes on other foods.
[00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:28.448]  Deserted shopping malls.
[00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:30.810]  Bleak symbol of Fed bailout.
[00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:31.671]  Reuters.
[00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:31.991]  U.S.
[00:17:31.991 --> 00:17:34.473]  troops in Iraq have time on their hands.
[00:17:34.473 --> 00:17:36.976]  USA Today.
[00:17:36.976 --> 00:17:39.258]  Sudbury man arrested on terrorism charges.
[00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:40.980]  We'll tell you what's going on behind the scenes with that.
[00:17:43.513 --> 00:17:53.236]  And it goes on and on and on, and that's just some of the news that I have here in my important stack.
[00:17:53.236 --> 00:17:58.518]  Today, we have the latest polls on Barack Obama.
[00:17:58.518 --> 00:18:06.360]  House Dems want Medicare for everyone, as if this bankrupt state can pay for anything else.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.541]  There is no such thing as a free lunch.
[00:18:08.541 --> 00:18:12.302]  Big government and the welfare state has destroyed the country.
[00:18:13.456 --> 00:18:18.278]  Government creates a matrix for corruption at every level.
[00:18:18.278 --> 00:18:21.300]  It's a fact.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:31.825]  Democrats lock Republicans out of committee room in the Government House Oversight Reform Committee so that Republicans can't find out what's going on.
[00:18:31.825 --> 00:18:32.826]  Incredible corruption.
[00:18:33.996 --> 00:18:38.578]  I mean, the House and Senate are just more and more corrupt every day, the types of things they're doing.
[00:18:38.578 --> 00:18:40.458]  Not letting anybody read the bills.
[00:18:40.458 --> 00:18:47.301]  When Obama swore he would make sure there was five days for everyone to read the bills, now he lobbies that no one be able to read the stinking bills.
[00:18:47.301 --> 00:18:56.344]  I mean, they've got five different bills and they won't give the public, or even members of Congress, most of the subsections.
[00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:58.005]  I mean, I was thinking last night.
[00:18:59.525 --> 00:19:14.050]  About foodanddrugadministration.gov and the hundreds of pages they have about how the flu shot can give you neurological disorders, can kill you, seizures, Guillain-Barre, cancer, sterilization, mercury.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:24.968]  And then I was reading Paul Watson's article that had a link to the New York Times saying it's all a myth and they have fact sheets that are given to school children all over the country telling them that none of that's true.
[00:19:24.968 --> 00:19:31.754]  I mean, just the level of corruption and illegitimacy is mind-blowing.
[00:19:31.754 --> 00:19:38.639]  And police and military and bureaucrats, you're going to be asked to carry out all of this criminality against the people.
[00:19:38.639 --> 00:19:40.661]  You better make a decision whose side you're on.
[00:19:41.912 --> 00:19:46.894]  And don't think for a minute that you're not going to be hung out to dry by your bosses when they're done with you.
[00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:52.615]  Alright, we're going to come back.
[00:19:52.615 --> 00:19:53.416]  Go to your phone calls.
[00:19:53.416 --> 00:19:55.516]  Steve, Mike, Mike, Tim, Heather, many others.
[00:19:55.516 --> 00:19:55.636]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:55.636 --> 00:19:57.877]  That's just part of one of the stacks I've got today.
[00:20:02.403 --> 00:20:07.608]  The following message is proudly and patriotically brought to you by the owners of Ready Reserve Foods, Inc.
[00:20:07.608 --> 00:20:12.993]  It is generally not the place for a business or corporation to make an editorial stand, but times have changed.
[00:20:12.993 --> 00:20:17.978]  It has become very obvious that our government is completely out of control and has decoupled from any constraints placed
[00:20:17.998 --> 00:20:18.398]  We're good to go.
[00:20:48.138 --> 00:20:49.458]  Get prepared now.
[00:20:49.458 --> 00:20:50.839]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.

[00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:51.199]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:20:51.199 --> 00:20:55.980]  Or www.... On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.083 --> 00:21:15.210]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:23.376]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:23.376 --> 00:21:28.140]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:33.682]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:33.682 --> 00:21:38.044]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.044 --> 00:21:39.124]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.124 --> 00:21:43.626]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:01.992]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:22:01.992 --> 00:22:02.832]  Spy on me?
[00:22:02.832 --> 00:22:03.172]  Yeah.

[00:22:08.213 --> 00:22:09.834]  You should use Startpage instead.

[00:24:07.176 --> 00:24:19.002]  Steve in New Jersey.
[00:24:19.002 --> 00:24:19.982]  First call of the day.
[00:24:19.982 --> 00:24:20.583]  Welcome.
[00:24:20.583 --> 00:24:22.824]  Hello?
[00:24:22.824 --> 00:24:23.944]  Hey, buddy.
[00:24:23.944 --> 00:24:24.765]  Hello?
[00:24:24.765 --> 00:24:26.486]  Yeah, hello, Steve.
[00:24:26.486 --> 00:24:27.066]  How you doing?
[00:24:27.066 --> 00:24:28.047]  Can you hear me?
[00:24:28.047 --> 00:24:29.747]  Can you hear me, Steve?
[00:24:29.747 --> 00:24:30.748]  Yes, I can.
[00:24:30.748 --> 00:24:31.648]  Can you hear me?
[00:24:31.648 --> 00:24:32.369]  Yes, I can.
[00:24:32.369 --> 00:24:33.109]  I can hear you.
[00:24:33.109 --> 00:24:34.030]  Can you hear me?
[00:24:35.168 --> 00:24:35.929]  Yes, yes.
[00:24:35.929 --> 00:24:36.909]  I have a bad connection.
[00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:37.490]  I'm sorry.
[00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:43.193]  I want to make you aware of a new development breaking here in New Jersey.
[00:24:43.193 --> 00:24:44.594]  Okay.
[00:24:44.594 --> 00:24:54.060]  Okay, what happened is, uh, they supposedly arrested a man yesterday for making terroristic threats about the president.
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:59.504]  He's a 55-year-old private security guard, uh, in New Jersey.
[00:24:59.504 --> 00:25:01.545]  He's supposed to be arraigned today.
[00:25:01.545 --> 00:25:03.026]  Now, I don't know if you're aware of this.
[00:25:05.779 --> 00:25:07.820]  What did they say he did?
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.422]  They said he made terroristic threats.
[00:25:10.422 --> 00:25:11.603]  They searched his home.
[00:25:11.603 --> 00:25:15.926]  They found 40 weapons, they say, but they're all legal.
[00:25:15.926 --> 00:25:18.488]  He's supposed to be arraigned today.
[00:25:18.488 --> 00:25:23.591]  He's a 55-year-old private security guard.
[00:25:23.591 --> 00:25:28.575]  He might have said something on a message board or website or email.
[00:25:28.575 --> 00:25:33.478]  A fellow employee overheard him making some kind of threat towards the president.
[00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:35.151]  They arrested him.
[00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:41.213]  This is breaking news as we speak, and I don't know if it's being broadcast nationwide, but it just happened here.
[00:25:41.213 --> 00:25:43.574]  He's supposed to be arraigned today.
[00:25:43.574 --> 00:25:46.674]  It's something to look into.
[00:25:46.674 --> 00:25:47.495]  Alright, thank you.
[00:25:47.495 --> 00:25:52.836]  I appreciate the call, Steve.
[00:25:52.836 --> 00:25:59.978]  I do know that we have a Fox News report, a local Fox News report, and they
[00:26:01.317 --> 00:26:04.498]  Report on it like it might be reasonable.
[00:26:04.498 --> 00:26:14.540]  This guy has a tiny house off the road with little bitty windows with curtains and it was 5 30 a.m.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:25.923]  and he came down naked to make some coffee and I'll be quite frank sometimes
[00:26:28.866 --> 00:26:29.606]  I don't know.
[00:26:52.037 --> 00:27:00.379]  Showed where he made the coffee and the police came to his house and arrested him for indecent exposure.
[00:27:00.379 --> 00:27:12.502]  A few years ago, I saw the statistics.
[00:27:12.502 --> 00:27:13.302]  Hold on just a minute.
[00:27:23.797 --> 00:27:28.200]  I had a bunch of people come into the office, come into the studio.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.900]  I can't wait until I build the other studio.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:37.625]  We didn't build this one right, and it's right in the middle of the office, and there's just circuses going on constantly out the window and in the room next to me, and we didn't soundproof it right.
[00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:42.288]  And now, so I don't go deaf, I'm not wearing headphones, I'm wearing an earpiece.
[00:27:42.288 --> 00:27:46.110]  And so I hear everything people are saying when they're loud right into my ear.
[00:27:47.407 --> 00:28:02.618]  And then I guess I've just got to train myself to be able to operate and be able to do this show, but I designed this and I just designed it wrong.
[00:28:02.618 --> 00:28:03.659]  Oh, it's pointless.
[00:28:03.659 --> 00:28:14.267]  I was listening to the news yesterday and they were reporting that they may pass laws making it illegal
[00:28:16.408 --> 00:28:26.290]  To not just text while you drive, and that sounds reasonable, but not to drink coffee or eat while you're driving.
[00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:40.814]  And then I constantly read about people being arrested because their neighbor sees them loading a gun into their trunk and thinks that guns are illegal, so they call the police and the police still go ahead and come out and arrest them for no reason.
[00:28:40.814 --> 00:28:44.595]  And I see these reports
[00:28:47.537 --> 00:28:50.805]  Where they're just arresting people for absolutely no reason now.
[00:28:50.805 --> 00:28:56.800]  I see reports constantly where people have surveillance cameras on their own house.
[00:28:57.915 --> 00:29:26.503]  And the police will come out to their home, beat them up, or arrest them, and then they will use the video camera, try to use it in court, to show that the police are lying on the police report, and then police come back to the house and arrest them and charge them for eavesdropping, saying that it violated the police privacy, when clearly there is no reasonable expectation of privacy for the police.
[00:29:28.311 --> 00:29:32.654]  When they are at your house.
[00:29:32.654 --> 00:29:36.276]  Or when they're out on the street.
[00:29:36.276 --> 00:29:44.581]  And I see reports where the police will pull somebody over, the people will have a camera on them, the police are videotaping them from the squad car and the cops arrest them for that.
[00:29:44.581 --> 00:29:51.025]  And they always lose in court, but still it just shows they're ready to carry out tyranny.
[00:29:51.025 --> 00:29:52.426]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.426 --> 00:29:54.947]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.947 --> 00:29:57.629]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.174 --> 00:30:05.481]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:30:05.481 --> 00:30:10.027]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:30:10.027 --> 00:30:12.290]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:13.912]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:14.954]  There is a solution.
[00:30:15.174 --> 00:30:23.598]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:30:37.104 --> 00:30:42.687]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:47.270]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[00:31:02.059 --> 00:31:06.081]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.081 --> 00:31:09.343]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.343 --> 00:31:10.744]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[00:31:11.448 --> 00:31:14.129]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.129 --> 00:31:20.512]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.512 --> 00:31:26.055]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:26.055 --> 00:31:35.679]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:38.161]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.161 --> 00:31:39.742]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.742 --> 00:31:42.203]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.203 --> 00:31:44.325]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.325 --> 00:31:49.468]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:32:05.526 --> 00:32:09.547]  Toxins are in our foods and chemicals are in our air.
[00:32:09.547 --> 00:32:11.808]  Chemicals are in our water supply.
[00:32:11.808 --> 00:32:17.689]  We purify our air and we purify our water and yet we forget to purify our bodies.
[00:32:17.689 --> 00:32:22.830]  Funny, our bodies continue to absorb these deadly toxins and chemicals every day.
[00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.731]  Isn't it time to make a change?
[00:32:24.731 --> 00:32:26.311]  Maybe a life change?

[00:33:25.189 --> 00:33:30.092]  At a certain point, what is the point?
[00:33:30.092 --> 00:33:32.093]  Government is a cancer.
[00:33:32.093 --> 00:33:35.735]  It wants excuses to tax you, to fine you, to fee you.
[00:33:35.735 --> 00:33:38.056]  The number one characteristic of a tyranny
[00:33:40.424 --> 00:33:42.085]  And it's not just Alex Jones saying this.
[00:33:42.085 --> 00:33:57.618]  It's what historians, it's what anthropologists, it's what sociologists, it's what people who research societies always throughout history have made this point, including the Founding Fathers, Greek philosophers, the list goes on and on.
[00:33:57.618 --> 00:34:04.404]  The number one characteristic of a tyranny is that it makes the general public criminals.
[00:34:04.404 --> 00:34:07.507]  It makes normal activity criminal.
[00:34:09.122 --> 00:34:17.725]  So that the state has a pretext and an excuse to come in and take control of your life and ultimately make you a slave and extract your labor.
[00:34:17.725 --> 00:34:18.665]  It's very, very simple.
[00:34:18.665 --> 00:34:27.268]  Governments, 99% of the time, make their population slaves to a tiny oligarchy, to a tiny elite.
[00:34:27.268 --> 00:34:34.510]  And somehow, in America in the last 50 years, the media and the culture made it a conspiracy theory
[00:34:37.202 --> 00:34:49.709]  Made it end conspiracy theory, to question the government, to question corruption, to even say that corruption could exist in government, became a conspiracy theory.
[00:34:49.709 --> 00:35:03.656]  Until now, we have a government that attacks Iran using Sunnis, and then says that Iran is Sunni-based Al Qaeda.
[00:35:05.054 --> 00:35:06.416]  Up is down, down is up.
[00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:16.608]  We have a media and a government that says there is no mercury, there are no side effects with the flu shot, when the insert lists them all.
[00:35:16.608 --> 00:35:19.251]  And I keep going back over that because there's so many lies.
[00:35:20.737 --> 00:35:24.679]  Almost everything is 180 degrees from what the public's told.
[00:35:24.679 --> 00:35:37.526]  People are told the insurance companies don't want the government health care and they're greedy and bad and they're trying to stop it when they're the ones that have written it and their own lobbyists have stated this on record.
[00:35:37.526 --> 00:35:44.870]  They want to force you to go get health care from them and get insurance from them and then they get government liability protection to lower the quality of care.
[00:35:46.601 --> 00:35:49.603]  And the government lies about WMDs.
[00:35:49.603 --> 00:35:56.248]  I saw the Attorney General up on television right before I went on air giving a live press conference about a giant drug bust.
[00:35:56.248 --> 00:35:58.029]  Give me a break.
[00:35:58.029 --> 00:36:09.797]  They always bust some mid-level cowboy who didn't launder his cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, ecstasy, whatever drug he's selling, money with the right bank.
[00:36:09.797 --> 00:36:10.858]  And so he's busted.
[00:36:12.964 --> 00:36:18.427]  When on record the CIA has been caught hundreds of times shipping in cocaine and heroin.
[00:36:18.427 --> 00:36:31.193]  Congressional reports, the 1996 CIA Solicitor General, I've got it on video, off C-SPAN admitting the CIA brought in the cocaine for the crack epidemic.
[00:36:33.137 --> 00:36:37.921]  Now the public thinks that's a rumor because they never looked at the documents or the testimony.
[00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:43.085]  Just like the public still thinks it's a rumor that the Gulf of Tonkin attack on our ships was staged.
[00:36:43.085 --> 00:36:44.966]  No, it's now been declassified!
[00:36:44.966 --> 00:36:49.650]  You just haven't gone and looked it up!
[00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.971]  Alright, I said I'm going to take your calls.
[00:36:50.971 --> 00:36:55.575]  It just goes on and on and on and on.
[00:36:55.575 --> 00:36:58.217]  The lying, the stealing, the cheating.
[00:36:59.246 --> 00:37:05.230]  Here in Austin, they're about to pass tens of millions of dollars of funding.
[00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:08.011]  In fact, I had that in my stat, guys, and I didn't bring it.
[00:37:08.011 --> 00:37:11.153]  Just search engine the term.
[00:37:11.153 --> 00:37:18.738]  Government paid for city-funded abortions, county-funded abortions, Austin.
[00:37:18.738 --> 00:37:21.460]  It's a big deal right now with locals, and it should be.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:28.184]  I mean, if you're for abortion, and you're for dehumanizing human life to that point,
[00:37:30.987 --> 00:37:53.565]  It's a horrible thing, but you certainly shouldn't be able to argue that other people have to pay for it, and they've got federal and state laws where girls as young as 10 don't have to tell their parents when they have an abortion, but they've got to get a note until they're 17 in high school to be allowed to go on a field trip to the planetarium or the zoo or to SeaWorld.
[00:37:53.565 --> 00:37:55.927]  You've got to get a mommy's note to go to SeaWorld.
[00:37:57.096 --> 00:38:05.059]  But you don't need mommy or daddy's permission when you're 10 to go have some filthy abortuary kill the baby.
[00:38:05.059 --> 00:38:06.980]  My God.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:07.761]  That's what I mean.
[00:38:07.761 --> 00:38:11.142]  Everything is turned upside down.
[00:38:11.142 --> 00:38:17.345]  And the news is just pouring in how they're making everything criminal, everything a crime.
[00:38:17.345 --> 00:38:20.146]  They're arresting people every day for things that aren't even crimes.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:31.645]  I've seen three different cases I know of, of my listeners being arrested for handing out my films to police.
[00:38:31.645 --> 00:38:36.587]  The most famous case that made the newspapers was Kelly Rushing, Lyon County, Kentucky.
[00:38:36.587 --> 00:38:39.349]  Family been there since the founding of the county.
[00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:40.369]  Well-known family.
[00:38:40.369 --> 00:38:41.950]  Upstanding member of society.
[00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:43.551]  No criminal record.
[00:38:43.551 --> 00:38:46.152]  He gets road to tyranny and a Ron Paul speech.
[00:38:46.152 --> 00:38:50.434]  He puts Ron Paul at the front and road to tyranny on the second part of the VHS tape.
[00:38:50.434 --> 00:38:51.375]  This is like six years ago.
[00:38:52.918 --> 00:38:55.460]  Ron Paul's neocon speech.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.782]  He gives it to a local state police officer.
[00:38:57.782 --> 00:39:01.986]  Three days later, the guy pulls him over when he leaves his house.
[00:39:01.986 --> 00:39:07.951]  Laughs to his wife on his cell phone and says, I just arrested the VHS bandit.
[00:39:07.951 --> 00:39:11.034]  And says, that video's anti-law enforcement.
[00:39:11.034 --> 00:39:14.477]  And he was charged for the Ron Paul video.
[00:39:14.477 --> 00:39:16.218]  And he was charged for road to tyranny.
[00:39:16.218 --> 00:39:17.780]  And I called the judge up at home.
[00:39:19.005 --> 00:39:25.787]  With it on speaker, with my wife as a witness, because I don't want that judge making something up, but also wasn't going to record the judge.
[00:39:25.787 --> 00:39:28.948]  Because of wiretapping laws in many states.
[00:39:28.948 --> 00:39:30.848]  And I said, oh, hello, and it was the judge.
[00:39:30.848 --> 00:39:31.569]  I called information.
[00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:32.169]  He goes, yes, I got word.
[00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:37.290]  Do you have Kelly rushing next week in a terroristic threat trial?
[00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:38.310]  I go, that's in the newspaper.
[00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:39.591]  You're really going to have this trial?
[00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:44.914]  I'm with the news media, and I'm Alex Jones.
[00:39:44.914 --> 00:39:45.695]  He goes, I know who you are.
[00:39:45.695 --> 00:39:46.976]  And I said, you're going ahead with this trial.
[00:39:46.976 --> 00:39:48.097]  And he said, yes.
[00:39:48.097 --> 00:39:58.906]  And they seeded the jury, and they came in and wanted to give him three years for each count consecutive, six years in the state pen for giving him a video.
[00:39:58.906 --> 00:40:01.108]  They said the video was a threat.
[00:40:01.488 --> 00:40:04.810]  I mean, how warped is that state police officer's brain?
[00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.812]  How crazy is that lunatic?
[00:40:06.812 --> 00:40:14.817]  How un-American is that person to think that you can't give somebody a videotape of a congressman giving a speech in America?
[00:40:14.817 --> 00:40:17.719]  Or a road to tyranny that doesn't call for any violence?
[00:40:17.719 --> 00:40:21.462]  It reaches out to police and asks them to wake up and follow the Bill of Rights?
[00:40:21.462 --> 00:40:26.165]  It shows their internal training manuals where they were listing gun owners and conservatives as terrorists?
[00:40:27.665 --> 00:40:33.230]  Oh yeah, back when I put out films like Road to Tyranny in 2002, I couldn't get national attention.
[00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:37.374]  We've broken hundreds of those documents over the years.
[00:40:37.374 --> 00:40:41.918]  And it was funny to that cop, to that Kentucky State Police officer,
[00:40:43.444 --> 00:40:45.165]  Kelly Rushing wasn't a human being.
[00:40:45.165 --> 00:40:46.306]  He didn't have a life.
[00:40:46.306 --> 00:40:49.269]  It was funny trying to put him in prison for six years.
[00:40:49.269 --> 00:40:51.811]  It was a big joke to him and his wife.
[00:40:51.811 --> 00:40:52.932]  It was fun!
[00:40:52.932 --> 00:40:57.595]  He went in and testified to that jury and wanted Kelly in prison!
[00:40:57.595 --> 00:40:59.277]  They don't think you're a human being!
[00:40:59.677 --> 00:41:02.177]  They're so self-centered, and it's not just the cops.
[00:41:02.177 --> 00:41:16.660]  The general public, we all know, is either awake and upset and focused and loving and caring, or they're absolutely worldly scum who don't care about their husbands, their wives, their children, their society, much less you.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:26.922]  You know, we hear about how the government loves the troops, but that's why they've tried to make them and have pay for their meals in hospitals when they're in Rammstein and other hospitals in Europe when their arms and legs blown off.
[00:41:28.356 --> 00:41:30.937]  Or when they're all shot up.
[00:41:30.937 --> 00:41:35.538]  That's why Obama tried to make troops pay for their own medical care with their own insurance.
[00:41:35.538 --> 00:41:38.338]  People didn't believe that when we first broke it.
[00:41:38.338 --> 00:41:49.400]  We saw a congressional report and weeks later the head of the American Legion came on this radio show and said he met with Obama and Obama did pitch him the idea.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:54.782]  But under Bush they were trying to make the troops pay for their own health care and their own food and their own flights back home.
[00:41:54.782 --> 00:41:56.762]  The point is they don't care about you either.
[00:41:58.325 --> 00:42:02.970]  And that stupid, moron police officer should be fired, but of course he wasn't.
[00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:05.092]  It was funny at the state police office.
[00:42:05.092 --> 00:42:10.157]  Sit around and laugh about trying to ruin some good American's life for his First Amendment.
[00:42:10.157 --> 00:42:14.702]  Kelly lovingly, politely said, I'd like you to have this, sir.
[00:42:14.702 --> 00:42:17.645]  I'd like you to see what Ron Paul and Alex Jones have to say about what's happening.
[00:42:17.645 --> 00:42:19.447]  We'd like you to be on the right side of history.
[00:42:19.447 --> 00:42:21.248]  Alright, I said I'd take your calls.
[00:42:21.248 --> 00:42:21.529]  It's just...
[00:42:23.578 --> 00:42:27.980]  The Republic is falling right now.
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.460]  It is imploding.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.021]  It is falling apart.
[00:42:31.021 --> 00:42:36.903]  There's no doubt that we're going into a very serious system of oppression.
[00:42:36.903 --> 00:42:39.944]  There is no doubt we've already been robbed blind.
[00:42:39.944 --> 00:42:45.466]  There is no doubt that it's only going to get worse unless we really stand up.
[00:42:45.466 --> 00:42:48.987]  And the system's going to stage terror attacks to make themselves the victims.
[00:42:48.987 --> 00:42:50.568]  There's nothing they won't do.
[00:42:54.977 --> 00:42:57.838]  Alright, I'm going to give each caller one minute, because I do want to go to everybody.
[00:42:57.838 --> 00:42:58.939]  Let's go to Mike in Ohio.
[00:42:58.939 --> 00:43:00.920]  Go ahead, Mike.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.860]  Hey, Alex.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:02.940]  Hey, buddy.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:03.721]  How are you?
[00:43:03.721 --> 00:43:04.981]  Good.
[00:43:04.981 --> 00:43:05.261]  Good.
[00:43:05.261 --> 00:43:10.624]  Hey, I'm a police officer up here in Ohio, and you know, that's totally wrong, that stuff in Kentucky.
[00:43:10.624 --> 00:43:15.306]  Anyway, since I'm only getting a minute, I got a few points I want to touch on.
[00:43:15.306 --> 00:43:18.147]  Long-time listener, Prison Planet subscriber.
[00:43:18.147 --> 00:43:19.308]  Well, thank you.
[00:43:19.308 --> 00:43:20.808]  E-Cola Blue, awesome product.
[00:43:20.808 --> 00:43:21.889]  My uncle bought one.
[00:43:21.889 --> 00:43:22.269]  Loves it.
[00:43:23.106 --> 00:43:33.992]  Calvin products are great and I just had a serious bout with the flu here and I've been taking colloidal silver for a while and my flu lasted me a day and a half.
[00:43:33.992 --> 00:43:38.915]  Everybody else here at work has been down four to five days so I ordered that silver lungs thing.
[00:43:40.596 --> 00:43:47.441]  Well, I'm no medical doctor, but we've had medical doctor on after medical doctor who says that silver is the best thing out there.
[00:43:47.441 --> 00:43:56.006]  Now, pun intended, it's not a silver bullet, but it's one of the best things out there according to the doctors we've had on the show who aren't even selling this stuff.
[00:43:56.006 --> 00:43:59.689]  So, yeah, anything I have as a sponsor, I believe in.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.360]  Right.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.041]  And actually, I'm getting ready to hook up.
[00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:05.881]  I'm going to try to hook up with Dr. Tenpenny for some stuff.
[00:44:05.881 --> 00:44:11.963]  But on another note, I wear my Info Wars wristband that says, Defend Freedom on it every day.
[00:44:11.963 --> 00:44:14.643]  And we just had a thing with DHS police.
[00:44:14.643 --> 00:44:17.924]  Let me tell you something, most of those guys are good to go.
[00:44:17.924 --> 00:44:21.625]  But some of them, it freaked them out pretty bad that I was wearing that wristband.
[00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:23.365]  And I wear it everywhere, you know.
[00:44:23.365 --> 00:44:25.606]  And the high ups in my department
[00:44:29.616 --> 00:44:32.979]  I can't say too much about it, but that's about it, man.
[00:44:32.979 --> 00:44:34.800]  You're doing a great job.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.503]  I haven't watched the trailer yet, or the new film yet.
[00:44:38.503 --> 00:44:42.506]  I was going to download it, but ran out of time on the connection speed.
[00:44:42.506 --> 00:44:43.787]  But you're doing a great job.
[00:44:43.787 --> 00:44:45.909]  Keep it up, and we appreciate everything.
[00:44:45.909 --> 00:44:47.270]  There's a lot of good cops out here.
[00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:50.612]  I mean, there's some dirtbags, but there's a lot of good ones.
[00:44:50.612 --> 00:44:51.693]  Sir, I want to be clear.
[00:44:51.693 --> 00:44:53.574]  I want to be clear, and I can give you more in a minute.
[00:44:53.574 --> 00:44:56.517]  The point is, I just want to hurry everybody so everybody gets on, because I'm so long-winded.
[00:44:58.289 --> 00:45:03.492]  I learned more in a year now than I learned in the previous ten.
[00:45:03.492 --> 00:45:10.457]  Like everybody in life, people make the point that as you get older, more and more dots get connected and you get more wisdom.
[00:45:10.457 --> 00:45:11.977]  I know there are a lot of good police.
[00:45:11.977 --> 00:45:14.399]  I mean, I've had a car wreck before.
[00:45:14.399 --> 00:45:17.721]  Both the state troopers that came to help us were fans of the show.
[00:45:17.721 --> 00:45:24.245]  I go to the gym, police come over that are supporters of the show and they say, why are you so hard on us?
[00:45:24.245 --> 00:45:27.227]  You know, a lot of us are good and I know police are starting to wake up.
[00:45:27.927 --> 00:45:44.058]  But at the same time, when I see the leadership of most of the big departments, we know have been federalized, we know they're doing things that are unconstitutional, we know there's a lot of scum out on the streets and a lot of crime, and I know police have a tough job.
[00:45:44.058 --> 00:45:45.419]  I certainly don't want it.
[00:45:45.419 --> 00:45:49.282]  I mean, it's a pretty, you know, macho, gung-ho job I know a lot of the time.
[00:45:49.282 --> 00:45:50.643]  It's a dangerous job.
[00:45:51.563 --> 00:45:54.684]  Out there writing tickets with cars flying by at 80 miles an hour.
[00:45:54.684 --> 00:45:56.604]  I mean, it's insane.
[00:45:56.604 --> 00:45:58.844]  So I understand a lot of people are waking up.
[00:45:58.844 --> 00:46:06.346]  Who do you think sends me all these police and FBI training manuals and documents that we leak to the public?
[00:46:06.346 --> 00:46:07.526]  So I know that.
[00:46:07.526 --> 00:46:13.647]  And, you know, it's funny that the first person I go to is a police officer when I was just telling the Kelly Rushing story.
[00:46:13.647 --> 00:46:20.188]  I was mainly asking the question, how does this country get to that point
[00:46:22.256 --> 00:46:23.798]  Because there wasn't more to the story.
[00:46:23.798 --> 00:46:24.979]  I talked to the judge.
[00:46:24.979 --> 00:46:27.001]  I saw the trial transcripts after.
[00:46:27.001 --> 00:46:28.282]  I talked to Kelly Rushing.
[00:46:28.282 --> 00:46:30.384]  I didn't believe it when I first saw it.
[00:46:30.384 --> 00:46:32.045]  I called his neighbors.
[00:46:32.045 --> 00:46:33.367]  I did a whole investigation.
[00:46:33.367 --> 00:46:37.511]  I found out that he owned a business in town and was known as a soft-spoken guy.
[00:46:37.511 --> 00:46:44.857]  And I read the testimony of the police officer Kelly sent me the transcript after, where he gave him a video and said, please watch this, sir.
[00:46:46.659 --> 00:46:53.902]  Our country's future depends on it, so my point in bringing that story up every few months is, I'm seeing more and more craziness like that.
[00:46:53.902 --> 00:46:56.383]  I mean, it's almost like there's two groups dividing.
[00:46:56.383 --> 00:47:14.051]  You either have the police waking up, getting better, warning others, doing a great job, or you have the other group, like the G20, where they went into the university saying nobody's allowed out at night, nobody's allowed out during the day, no one can congregate, old women would come out of stores,
[00:47:15.427 --> 00:47:23.389]  With shopping bags, and the police would say, get out of here, and the women would ask, well officer, I'm just shopping, and the police dog would bite them.
[00:47:23.389 --> 00:47:26.529]  And what I'm saying is it's a mob psychology.
[00:47:26.529 --> 00:47:40.552]  How have the police gotten to this mob psychology, where I'm sure a lot of those cops would have been nice fellas to go watch a football game with, but you put them in a black uniform with a billy club, chasing down women on bikes and beating them in the head.
[00:47:40.552 --> 00:47:43.693]  I mean, this is tyranny, that's all I'm saying.
[00:47:44.787 --> 00:47:44.887]  Yes.
[00:47:44.887 --> 00:47:44.967]  Yes.
[00:48:06.517 --> 00:48:08.359]  And, um, you know, and that's what it is.
[00:48:08.359 --> 00:48:10.320]  A lot of guys get that mentality.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:14.223]  They see that crap on television, you know, and they think that that's the way it is.
[00:48:14.223 --> 00:48:18.086]  And like you're saying about the high-ups, you know, being all under control, and they are.
[00:48:18.086 --> 00:48:22.829]  You know, I had one of our commanders, I was complaining about something the other day.
[00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:25.992]  Well, not really complaining, but talking about some of this stuff the other day.
[00:48:25.992 --> 00:48:29.334]  And the one commander's like, well, that's a new world order.
[00:48:29.334 --> 00:48:30.755]  Get used to it.
[00:48:30.755 --> 00:48:32.277]  I go, well, let me tell you something.
[00:48:32.277 --> 00:48:33.958]  Bring it my way and we'll see what happens.
[00:48:34.537 --> 00:48:48.910]  But doesn't he know, doesn't he know, see we've gone from the New World Order doesn't exist till it's in thousands and literally every few months thousands of articles just go to Google News type in New World Order and it's thousands it was thousands it was like
[00:48:50.439 --> 00:48:53.282]  8,000 one day, 10,000 the next during the G20.
[00:48:53.282 --> 00:48:59.389]  The front page of the Statesman Where We Live said New World Order, and then they describe it, a financial dictatorship.
[00:48:59.389 --> 00:49:03.213]  Does he know what a New World Order means to him and his family?
[00:49:03.213 --> 00:49:06.757]  I mean, you know, they were laughing at us five years ago about New World Order.
[00:49:06.757 --> 00:49:09.339]  Are they going to laugh about eco-science?
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.122]  Are they gonna laugh about what's in their water?
[00:49:12.122 --> 00:49:13.644]  What's in their shots?
[00:49:13.644 --> 00:49:17.307]  I mean, I want police to know you are not immune from this.
[00:49:17.307 --> 00:49:18.909]  This is targeting you.
[00:49:18.909 --> 00:49:20.390]  We are all together.
[00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:24.534]  That's what's so frustrating, Mike, is that we're all together.
[00:49:24.534 --> 00:49:31.842]  Whether some rampaging cop knows it or not, or whether some corrupt corporate guy knows it, or whether some
[00:49:33.721 --> 00:49:37.083]  You know, just General Yuppie who thinks this is all funny.
[00:49:37.083 --> 00:49:38.704]  We're all in this together.
[00:49:38.704 --> 00:49:40.725]  We're in the same boat.
[00:49:40.725 --> 00:49:46.908]  And people need... That's my message to listeners is this is it.
[00:49:46.908 --> 00:49:49.909]  They're killing the country right now.
[00:49:49.909 --> 00:49:54.692]  And I know down the road everybody is gonna wake up.
[00:49:54.692 --> 00:49:57.313]  We need to wake up now before it gets even worse.
[00:49:57.313 --> 00:50:02.936]  I mean, I know down the road that we're gonna end up turning this around because all tyrannies get so bad they finally implode.
[00:50:03.686 --> 00:50:08.909]  But I just studied history and I can't believe we have to go down this road.
[00:50:08.909 --> 00:50:19.354]  It's like telling a kid not to snort cocaine and they're 15 and go to a party and snort it and have a heart attack.
[00:50:19.354 --> 00:50:24.557]  Or they don't have a heart attack right away, 10 years later they have a heart attack and are dead.
[00:50:24.557 --> 00:50:32.842]  You know, you just wish you could get people to listen and to not stick their finger in a light socket, to not play in traffic, to not
[00:50:34.059 --> 00:50:34.600]  I don't know.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:41.786]  Listen, great to hear from you, Mike, and God bless you for what you're doing.
[00:50:41.786 --> 00:50:43.808]  I've described it like being in a car.
[00:50:43.808 --> 00:50:55.799]  You ever been in a car with somebody when they start wrecking, and minutes slow down to seconds, or seconds slow down to minutes, and you know you're about to slam into that tree, and you're just like, oh man, why did this happen?
[00:50:55.799 --> 00:50:57.720]  And we're sliding towards the tree right now.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.202]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.135 --> 00:51:02.897]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:51:02.897 --> 00:51:04.418]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:51:04.418 --> 00:51:05.739]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:51:05.739 --> 00:51:07.701]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[00:51:07.701 --> 00:51:16.489]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:51:16.489 --> 00:51:21.754]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[00:51:21.894 --> 00:51:23.696]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[00:51:23.696 --> 00:51:31.183]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[00:51:31.183 --> 00:51:35.367]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[00:51:35.367 --> 00:51:37.889]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.

[00:52:02.142 --> 00:52:06.169]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.169 --> 00:52:09.395]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.395 --> 00:52:10.818]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:11.716 --> 00:52:14.217]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.217 --> 00:52:20.580]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:25.783]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.783 --> 00:52:35.748]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.888 --> 00:52:38.230]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:39.811]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.811 --> 00:52:42.272]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.272 --> 00:52:44.394]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.394 --> 00:52:49.557]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:54:00.993 --> 00:54:06.536]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:31.573 --> 00:54:38.299]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to beg you again of your new listeners, for heaven's sake, study Soviet Russia, Maoist China, Nazi Germany.
[00:54:38.299 --> 00:54:40.060]  Study the big bankers out of England.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.321]  They run it all.
[00:54:41.321 --> 00:54:42.442]  They created Hitler.
[00:54:42.442 --> 00:54:43.843]  It's declassified.
[00:54:43.843 --> 00:54:44.864]  It's London Guardian.
[00:54:44.864 --> 00:54:47.847]  They created Mussolini, MI5.
[00:54:47.847 --> 00:54:49.008]  They created Bin Laden.
[00:54:49.008 --> 00:54:54.612]  They created Saddam, the CIA training when he was 18 years old for four years in Egypt.
[00:54:55.461 --> 00:54:57.182]  They are slick!
[00:54:57.182 --> 00:54:59.362]  And we'd better figure out their game plan.
[00:54:59.362 --> 00:55:00.603]  I know their game plan!
[00:55:00.603 --> 00:55:03.324]  And I just got chills thinking about it.
[00:55:03.324 --> 00:55:05.005]  I'm thinking about my family.
[00:55:05.005 --> 00:55:07.205]  Thinking about all these innocent people!
[00:55:07.205 --> 00:55:12.087]  They want to consolidate wealth and end freedom in America to bring in world tyranny.
[00:55:12.087 --> 00:55:16.029]  The United States has to fall for world government to rise!
[00:55:16.029 --> 00:55:19.390]  The Republic really is going down the toilet!
[00:55:21.135 --> 00:55:29.561]  For all you people out there that when you see the American flag at a football game and you put your hand over your heart, you know why you get a tear in your eye?
[00:55:29.561 --> 00:55:37.507]  You're not just being sentimental, you instinctively know all the veterans and all your ancestors that fought and died and bled for what we've got here.
[00:55:37.507 --> 00:55:40.009]  It's so special!
[00:55:40.009 --> 00:55:45.773]  And I have been right about all of this, not because I'm smart, I know how to read their stinking documents!
[00:55:45.773 --> 00:55:49.235]  It's all out in the open, there's no more procrastinating!
[00:55:49.235 --> 00:55:50.116]  I'm gonna stop ranting.
[00:55:52.763 --> 00:55:57.604]  I just want to save the Republic.
[00:55:57.604 --> 00:55:58.944]  I just want to save this country.
[00:55:58.944 --> 00:56:00.945]  It's all we've got.
[00:56:00.945 --> 00:56:02.525]  Let's go ahead and take more calls here.
[00:56:02.525 --> 00:56:03.965]  Mike in New Jersey.
[00:56:03.965 --> 00:56:04.405]  Mike's there.
[00:56:04.405 --> 00:56:05.945]  Mike, go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:56:05.945 --> 00:56:07.106]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:56:07.106 --> 00:56:08.646]  I'm a big fan.
[00:56:08.646 --> 00:56:16.227]  Hey, I just thought you'd be interested to know that Sweden is actually burning bunny rabbits for biofuel.
[00:56:16.227 --> 00:56:18.168]  It's on Scientific American.
[00:56:18.168 --> 00:56:18.908]  Hey, do me a favor.
[00:56:19.915 --> 00:56:25.798]  Turn that radio off, because it's delayed and I hear myself ranting.
[00:56:25.798 --> 00:56:27.559]  What is the headline?
[00:56:27.559 --> 00:56:33.902]  It's burning bunnies for biofuel on a Scientific American Observer.
[00:56:33.902 --> 00:56:45.267]  Sweden is in Stockholm, they're actually hunting down bunny rabbits to be sent off to a rendering plant to be turned into biofuel.
[00:56:45.267 --> 00:56:46.848]  I'll have to look into that, but
[00:56:48.773 --> 00:56:53.597]  Listen, for more than 50 years they feed awful to cows.
[00:56:53.597 --> 00:56:57.240]  Cows aren't even supposed to eat meat.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.783]  They're vegetarian.
[00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:01.464]  They're herbivores.
[00:57:01.464 --> 00:57:04.147]  They're not omnivores like a pig or a human.
[00:57:04.147 --> 00:57:06.249]  They're not carnivores like a lion or a tiger.
[00:57:07.433 --> 00:57:14.298]  And that's where mad cow disease came from, they admit, and they're still taking dead cows.
[00:57:14.298 --> 00:57:21.684]  A lot of vets sell the euthanized animals and they grind them up into the offal in these giant slurry pits.
[00:57:21.684 --> 00:57:32.172]  In fact, you can search a dog food or animal food production plant offal, use the term offal, an offal plant, and if you've got the
[00:57:33.635 --> 00:57:34.436]  The stomach for it.
[00:57:34.436 --> 00:57:36.139]  You can actually watch videos online.
[00:57:36.139 --> 00:57:44.052]  I've seen one of thousands of rotten animals being ground up and see in the rotten meat crystals grow.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:47.741]  These prions.
[00:58:08.308 --> 00:58:19.852]  You'd also be interested to know that here in New Jersey, New Jersey actually has double the autism rate of the rest of the country, due in no part to the fact that New Jersey mandates more vaccines than any other state in the Union.
[00:58:19.852 --> 00:58:20.533]  I knew that.
[00:58:20.533 --> 00:58:21.533]  I'd seen that.
[00:58:21.533 --> 00:58:22.253]  Absolutely.
[00:58:22.253 --> 00:58:31.317]  And I have to sit here and look at all the brain-damaged kids walking around, I feel sorry for them, and their stupid parents won't wake up because the government wouldn't hurt them.
[00:58:32.355 --> 00:58:34.436]  The government wouldn't put Mercury in the shot.
[00:58:34.436 --> 00:58:36.597]  They said so in the New York Times.
[00:58:36.597 --> 00:58:37.418]  God bless you, sir.
[00:58:37.418 --> 00:58:38.358]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:38.358 --> 00:58:42.501]  Tim, Heather, others, stay with us.
[00:58:42.501 --> 00:58:45.122]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:00.388 --> 00:59:02.009]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:59:02.009 --> 00:59:03.090]  It's very real.
[00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:03.430]  I know.
[00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:07.653]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:59:07.653 --> 00:59:10.875]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.

[00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:55.772]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.772 --> 01:00:05.138]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.138 --> 01:00:06.439]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.439 --> 01:00:08.221]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.221 --> 01:00:09.982]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:10.743]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.545 --> 01:00:12.445]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.445 --> 01:00:17.288]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.288 --> 01:00:23.631]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.631 --> 01:00:26.052]  Hour number two, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:26.052 --> 01:00:28.914]  Continuing with wide open telephones.
[01:00:28.914 --> 01:00:31.815]  Coming up in the next hour, we are joined by Gerald Cilente.
[01:00:31.815 --> 01:00:37.578]  I'm going to break down some of the reviews we're getting, as well, for Fall of the Republic.
[01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:41.975]  Let's go ahead and talk to Heather in Indiana.
[01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:43.416]  Heather, thanks for holding.
[01:00:43.416 --> 01:00:44.136]  Oh, no problem.
[01:00:44.136 --> 01:00:46.918]  We'd hold all day to get on your show.
[01:00:46.918 --> 01:00:53.983]  We started watching the Fall of the Republic this morning, so we are almost halfway into it, and we want to congratulate you, and we absolutely love it.
[01:00:53.983 --> 01:01:01.387]  We've got our stack of DVDs, waiting to burn it and pass it all out, but we had to turn it off so I could get on and call you real quick.
[01:01:01.387 --> 01:01:06.590]  My aunt is 53 years old, and in 76 she had a swine flu shot.
[01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:06.830]  She was 19.
[01:01:08.035 --> 01:01:14.157]  Anna was okay for two weeks until she woke up paralyzed and has had 60-plus brain surgeries.
[01:01:14.157 --> 01:01:15.778]  She has Le Guin-Barre Syndrome.
[01:01:15.778 --> 01:01:18.719]  She has Pseudo-Tumor Cerebri.
[01:01:18.719 --> 01:01:20.580]  Very, very sick woman.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.160]  My family does not do flu shots.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.561]  We don't do... We're done with vaccinations.
[01:01:24.561 --> 01:01:26.742]  We have four small children.
[01:01:26.742 --> 01:01:29.963]  I was living in a bubble for a long time.
[01:01:29.963 --> 01:01:33.745]  My husband would come home from work and pull up Prison Planet and InfoWars and
[01:01:34.175 --> 01:01:35.257]  You've got to sit down and watch this.
[01:01:35.257 --> 01:01:36.299]  You've got to sit down and watch it.
[01:01:36.299 --> 01:01:41.107]  And I'm like, no, I kind of like not knowing what's going on until about six months ago.
[01:01:41.107 --> 01:01:42.750]  I really started getting into everything.
[01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:46.055]  And we are big, huge fans of you and support everything that you do.
[01:01:46.055 --> 01:01:47.878]  And my husband loves you and loves your show.
[01:01:48.922 --> 01:01:54.905]  The government had tried to pay her off with $200,000 back in 76 and said this will take care of your medical bills.
[01:01:54.905 --> 01:01:55.365]  We're done.
[01:01:55.365 --> 01:01:56.705]  You can't ever do anything.
[01:01:56.705 --> 01:02:00.207]  Well, we've had different historians on.
[01:02:00.207 --> 01:02:03.328]  The government says thousands died, tens of thousands got sick.
[01:02:03.328 --> 01:02:07.190]  It's more like hundreds of thousands got sick, tens of thousands died.
[01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.231]  And it's now happening again.
[01:02:09.231 --> 01:02:20.779]  I mean, it's in AP, Fox, CNN, but just little blurbs about, oh yeah, this woman was fine, now she's paralyzed, and they admit the vaccine did it, but it's still worth it to save the children.
[01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:24.222]  And what is it like for you to know that this happened to your family member?
[01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:42.804]  To know that it ruined her life, to know that it devastated her, and then to know that the New York Times and other major publications are saying that there's no mercury, no Guillain-Barre, no diseases, no infertility, no cancer risk, which is in the insert.
[01:02:42.804 --> 01:02:44.326]  I showed them again on TV yesterday.
[01:02:45.066 --> 01:02:45.986]  We post them.
[01:02:45.986 --> 01:02:48.547]  This is direct links to the government.
[01:02:48.547 --> 01:02:54.368]  And then, meanwhile, they'll just lie and say, oh, it's a conspiracy theory and all over the country.
[01:02:54.368 --> 01:02:59.249]  We've confirmed in California, Oregon, Texas, a bunch of Florida.
[01:02:59.249 --> 01:03:09.991]  We've been sent the local news articles where they're giving a fact sheet out to quell fears and misinformation to the parents and the children saying it's not true.
[01:03:09.991 --> 01:03:11.893]  It's not true it has mercury.
[01:03:11.893 --> 01:03:15.577]  It's not true it can cause a neurological disorder.
[01:03:15.577 --> 01:03:18.320]  It's not true that it has adjuvants.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.723]  It's not, and they are liars!
[01:03:20.723 --> 01:03:29.933]  And ladies and gentlemen, it's even hard for me to come to grips with the magnitude of that level of criminal lying and then to hear a police officer
[01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:35.490]  Earlier, talk about how his commander is just like, ah, so what?
[01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:36.991]  It's just the New World Order.
[01:03:36.991 --> 01:03:38.993]  Don't you get it, folks?
[01:03:38.993 --> 01:03:42.676]  No matter how crazy or scary it sounds, it's true.
[01:03:42.676 --> 01:03:45.498]  They want to kill you.
[01:03:45.498 --> 01:03:49.521]  They're testing how many of us they can kill before we wake up.
[01:03:49.521 --> 01:03:56.387]  All of their testing and killing and bio and chemical attacking of us is only the beginning.
[01:03:56.387 --> 01:03:59.129]  It's only a test, a probe.
[01:03:59.129 --> 01:03:59.490]  Go ahead.
[01:04:00.256 --> 01:04:05.420]  No, I just, uh, she had five miscarriages as well, um, years later after having this.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:06.821]  She couldn't, she couldn't get pregnant.
[01:04:06.821 --> 01:04:08.502]  She was constantly having miscarriage.
[01:04:08.502 --> 01:04:09.783]  It's in the insert!
[01:04:09.783 --> 01:04:11.664]  It totally ruins lives!
[01:04:11.664 --> 01:04:13.085]  This is murder!
[01:04:13.085 --> 01:04:28.436]  She, she has one daughter who is, uh, she just turned 18 and, and there isn't any other history, you know, I mean, cause once, I don't know, the whole family though, bottom line is, we don't, we have our children are eight, almost six, four and two, and we did,
[01:04:29.778 --> 01:04:36.961]  Before going to your websites and learning about all this, we were the stupid-ass parents who vaccinated our children, but we've been done.
[01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:46.806]  And we've signed the papers, and they're taken to school, and my two are in second grade and kindergarten, and I had to keep them home because they were doing vaccinations at the school.
[01:04:46.806 --> 01:04:54.090]  So I kept my kids home from school last week because I thought, you know, what if they just inject them anyway, regardless of what my paper says?
[01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:54.890]  They do that.
[01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:56.591]  They do that.
[01:04:56.591 --> 01:04:57.591]  Heather, God bless you.
[01:04:57.591 --> 01:04:58.111]  Keep it up.
[01:04:58.111 --> 01:04:59.072]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:05:00.435 --> 01:05:04.998]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.998 --> 01:05:05.899]  Number 1.
[01:05:05.899 --> 01:05:09.342]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.342 --> 01:05:10.182]  Number 2.
[01:05:10.182 --> 01:05:15.086]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.086 --> 01:05:15.826]  It's true.
[01:05:15.826 --> 01:05:20.710]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:21.531]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.531 --> 01:05:25.113]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.113 --> 01:05:28.796]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.016 --> 01:05:29.816]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.816 --> 01:05:32.557]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.557 --> 01:05:36.258]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.258 --> 01:05:37.039]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.039 --> 01:05:41.180]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:46.242]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:50.403]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.403 --> 01:05:52.203]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:06:27.556 --> 01:06:32.880]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:35.262]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:06:35.262 --> 01:06:37.003]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:06:37.003 --> 01:06:39.545]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:06:39.545 --> 01:06:44.268]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:06:44.268 --> 01:06:47.971]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.

[01:06:51.113 --> 01:06:52.994]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:52.994 --> 01:07:00.639]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:07:00.639 --> 01:07:02.661]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[01:07:03.291 --> 01:07:05.134]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[01:07:05.134 --> 01:07:06.936]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[01:07:06.936 --> 01:07:10.901]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:15.448]  Beta Prostate is a natural supplement that helps your body support prostate health.
[01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:20.034]  Your prostate affects the quality of your life, including your sleeping habits and intimacy.
[01:07:20.441 --> 01:07:25.883]  Beta Prostate has plant sterols shown to support healthy urine flow and healthy sleeping habits.
[01:07:25.883 --> 01:07:34.965]  And Beta Prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 sawpaw metal capsules to get the same plant sterols found in one Beta Prostate.
[01:07:34.965 --> 01:07:37.986]  New customers can get a free bottle of Beta Prostate.

[01:07:54.115 --> 01:07:54.655]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[01:07:54.655 --> 01:07:57.098]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[01:07:57.098 --> 01:08:06.207]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:08.469]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:17.917]  We're good to go.
[01:08:41.038 --> 01:08:42.498]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:42.498 --> 01:08:43.219]  That was close.
[01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:48.200]  I'm always busy conducting business during the three-minute breaks and sometimes getting a bit late.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:48.860]  I apologize.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.661]  We're continuing with your phone calls.
[01:08:50.661 --> 01:08:54.282]  For those who just tuned in, Heather from Indiana called.
[01:08:54.282 --> 01:09:01.104]  And she was talking about one of her family members in 76 who was 19 years old, totally healthy, took the swine flu shot.
[01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:02.625]  She's had a bunch of brain surgery.
[01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:05.025]  She has Guillain-Barré's disorder.
[01:09:05.025 --> 01:09:06.826]  The government admits the vaccine did it to her.
[01:09:07.768 --> 01:09:09.930]  And that's the issue.
[01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:15.314]  Just this one microcosm illustrates everything.
[01:09:15.314 --> 01:09:18.097]  You have a CDC, Center for Disease Control.
[01:09:18.097 --> 01:09:21.680]  You have an FDA, a Food and Drug Administration.
[01:09:23.257 --> 01:09:31.483]  That are spending billions of dollars of paid for government propaganda to tell you there's no mercury in the shots.
[01:09:31.483 --> 01:09:36.748]  To tell you it's not proven to cause neurological disorders in millions of people.
[01:09:36.748 --> 01:09:43.473]  That it's not proven that it can sterilize you or reduce your fertility and give you infertility.
[01:09:43.473 --> 01:09:48.577]  That there are live cancer viruses in every major vaccine that's been studied.
[01:09:51.010 --> 01:10:11.867]  Now, I've noticed a trend, and interviewing doctors and researchers, we have identified the vaccines that are particularly bad, and that the United Nations has been caught, in the third world, adding pathogens to them.
[01:10:11.867 --> 01:10:14.650]  They've been caught doing it on purpose.
[01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:18.153]  Those vaccines are polio, tetanus,
[01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:31.020]  Hepatitis, flu, and HIV vaccine trials.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.580]  And there are different companies.
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:41.923]  There are a lot of smaller companies that don't have as bad a records with adding all this garbage to the vaccines.
[01:10:41.923 --> 01:10:46.165]  But the big mega corporations are all involved in eugenics.
[01:10:46.165 --> 01:10:48.866]  They're all on the record involved in population control.
[01:10:50.009 --> 01:10:51.990]  But it's not just about vaccines.
[01:10:51.990 --> 01:11:00.536]  This illustrates how big government and big media get together and lie and tell everybody it's the law.
[01:11:00.536 --> 01:11:03.218]  You've got to take the shot to be at work or be in school.
[01:11:03.218 --> 01:11:05.499]  Meanwhile, President Obama says, oh, you don't have to take the shot.
[01:11:05.499 --> 01:11:06.680]  We're just gonna try to force you to take it.
[01:11:10.143 --> 01:11:26.866]  And if they will collude together to lie about something this big that they know maims and kills tens of thousands of people conservatively every year in the U.S., do you then not understand that they would stage a terror attack, especially when there are over 200 declassified examples of the criminal U.S.
[01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:29.547]  government staging terror attacks?
[01:11:29.547 --> 01:11:39.589]  And then hundreds of other examples of where they provocateur and go out and find mentally ill white supremacists, Muslims, you name it, to go out and stage terror attacks?
[01:11:40.919 --> 01:11:42.099]  These aren't just entrapment.
[01:11:42.099 --> 01:11:46.621]  They go out, find the groups, fund them, set them up.
[01:11:46.621 --> 01:11:49.582]  And then there are some real terror examples.
[01:11:49.582 --> 01:11:51.983]  What do you think Iran is going to do?
[01:11:51.983 --> 01:12:00.545]  Because the United States, Israel, and England have been staging scores of terror attacks a year for the last seven years at least inside Iran.
[01:12:00.545 --> 01:12:05.087]  Last Sunday blew up a giant police station killing a top general.
[01:12:07.105 --> 01:12:13.150]  Run by Jundola, a group publicly funded by the US government to stage the attacks.
[01:12:13.150 --> 01:12:23.919]  Iran has been playing it smart not staging attacks back knowing that that's the pretext the West wants to bomb that country into the Stone Age.
[01:12:23.919 --> 01:12:32.066]  But the issue is that Iran or some of their other hotheads that are in their government are probably going to blow up some airplanes.
[01:12:32.066 --> 01:12:34.188]  They're probably going to run a truck
[01:12:36.479 --> 01:12:40.242]  Full of explosives into a Marine Corps barracks.
[01:12:40.242 --> 01:12:41.784]  The Iranians don't play games.
[01:12:41.784 --> 01:12:44.486]  And when they attack, it's going to be military bases.
[01:12:44.486 --> 01:12:46.348]  And they're probably going to blow up some U.S.
[01:12:46.348 --> 01:12:47.529]  military bases now.
[01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:51.272]  Because the United States blew up one of their military bases.
[01:12:51.272 --> 01:12:54.455]  It's absolutely horrible.
[01:12:54.455 --> 01:13:00.260]  I'll guarantee you the Marines and Army soldiers or sailors that are going to get blown up by Iranian suicide bombers,
[01:13:06.653 --> 01:13:14.836]  from their Islamic Guard have no idea that the Pentagon is staging terror attacks in Iran.
[01:13:14.836 --> 01:13:20.437]  They're busy reading Playboy and watching football on the satellite and going out doing guard duty.
[01:13:20.437 --> 01:13:29.040]  And when that truck rolls through their gates and kills them, it'll all be over the news, oh my gosh, Iran did it, now we've got to hit them.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:35.422]  And then Iran's going to fire 12,000 sunburn missiles at our ships and our troops and World War III is going to start.
[01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:39.347]  And that's exactly what the globalists want.
[01:13:39.347 --> 01:14:03.664]  Just like it's been declassified that MI5, MI6, formerly OSS, the Milner Group, Lord Milner on record, funded Hitler, funded German intelligence, funded the buildup of the fascist, British intelligence on record told the Germans, attack Poland, attack Czechoslovakia, attack the Russians, we're gonna make a deal with you,
[01:14:06.078 --> 01:14:15.726]  We're going to help you take over the world and the King of England, Heil Hitler, Edward VIII, it's all on record.
[01:14:15.726 --> 01:14:31.540]  Just like they're staging events now, just like they're attacking Iran, so Iran will strike back, just like the British killed the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of the Austrian
[01:14:34.949 --> 01:14:45.392]  Hungarian Empire, to start World War I. And they went and killed the head of the Germanic nations, with a hand grenade and machine gun attack.
[01:14:45.392 --> 01:14:51.494]  And you better believe the Germans went absolutely ape, and got World War I going.
[01:14:51.494 --> 01:14:56.215]  They killed tens of millions of soldiers, total.
[01:14:56.215 --> 01:14:59.396]  That's what the British intelligence brain does.
[01:14:59.396 --> 01:15:02.817]  There is no one more cunning, no one more wicked, no one more evil.
[01:15:03.976 --> 01:15:05.718]  Are the British people bad?
[01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:07.760]  No.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.561]  I'm part British.
[01:15:09.561 --> 01:15:11.043]  I mean, my name is Jones.
[01:15:11.043 --> 01:15:12.064]  I'm Welsh.
[01:15:12.064 --> 01:15:13.585]  It's a Welsh name.
[01:15:13.585 --> 01:15:19.671]  The issue is that this is what governments do.
[01:15:19.671 --> 01:15:24.876]  And no one is more wicked and cunning and abusive and evil than the people running our government.
[01:15:24.876 --> 01:15:25.917]  That's why they're on top.
[01:15:25.917 --> 01:15:28.079]  That's why they rule.
[01:15:28.079 --> 01:15:29.160]  Because they're the most evil.
[01:15:30.578 --> 01:15:31.679]  Are the Russians evil?
[01:15:31.679 --> 01:15:32.700]  Absolutely.
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.181]  Are the Iranians corrupt and evil?
[01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:34.881]  Their leadership?
[01:15:34.881 --> 01:15:36.522]  Absolutely.
[01:15:36.522 --> 01:15:38.304]  Is Muammar Gaddafi corrupt?
[01:15:38.304 --> 01:15:39.004]  Absolutely.
[01:15:39.004 --> 01:15:40.665]  That's the nature of power.
[01:15:40.665 --> 01:15:41.586]  That's history.
[01:15:41.586 --> 01:15:43.507]  That's what the Founding Fathers taught us.
[01:15:43.507 --> 01:15:46.570]  CW in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:48.211]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:49.632]  Hey buddy.
[01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:57.658]  It looks like Mr. Lindsey Williams is on the money about what he said earlier this week, because old Dick Cheney came out yesterday and
[01:16:05.825 --> 01:16:08.107]  Well, I believe that Lindsey's telling the truth.
[01:16:08.107 --> 01:16:11.068]  I believe Lindsey does talk to this individual.
[01:16:11.068 --> 01:16:16.512]  His other prediction about oil to drop from 150 to below 50 happened for the year, like he said.
[01:16:16.512 --> 01:16:23.437]  But again, that's only one elitist, one perspective, one angle.
[01:16:23.437 --> 01:16:24.577]  Yes, sir, you're right about that.
[01:16:25.882 --> 01:16:28.832]  I just want to tell you and your staffers, bravo on the movie.
[01:16:30.051 --> 01:16:36.435]  I don't know if it's a knockout punch to the New World Order, but it's definitely the punch before the knockout punch that's going to put a few cracks in your glass jaw.
[01:16:36.435 --> 01:16:41.619]  Well, I mean, Paul Watson's headline is not saying this film is going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:16:41.619 --> 01:16:45.582]  His point is that it will be devastating to their system.
[01:16:45.582 --> 01:16:48.524]  Fall of the Republic devastates globalist agenda.
[01:16:48.524 --> 01:16:55.168]  The film itself, what that's saying is, if you watch it, you will fully understand their entire agenda.
[01:16:55.168 --> 01:16:57.950]  And it's made for the average person to be able to understand it as well.
[01:17:00.097 --> 01:17:04.598]  There's some new information for everybody in Riveting Info with Alan Watt and countless others.
[01:17:04.598 --> 01:17:08.580]  John Perkins, Jesse Ventura, the list goes on and on.
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:21.003]  But if the people take this video and make tens of millions of copies of the DVDs, burning them at your homes, making copies and getting them out to people, it is the beginning of the knockout punch.
[01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:23.684]  I mean, look, people are waking up in droves right now.
[01:17:23.684 --> 01:17:25.605]  We can't underestimate the power of the people.
[01:17:27.191 --> 01:17:31.074]  You're right about that, and I think the establishment definitely knows it.
[01:17:31.074 --> 01:17:36.619]  Well, that's why I'm on the White House Enemies List, but briefly, give us your review of the film.
[01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:38.881]  Well, honestly, sir, I haven't seen it yet.
[01:17:38.881 --> 01:17:47.387]  I've been doing everything by mail, and I've totally detoxed from the Internet, but I've talked to some friends in our group and stuff, and they're saying, you know, smash it.
[01:17:47.387 --> 01:17:51.451]  And I trust their opinion just as yours and anyone else's who knows this information.
[01:17:53.883 --> 01:18:00.804]  I think a great area of attack, and one that I focus on here in this area, is local radio.
[01:18:00.804 --> 01:18:04.105]  And I've been fairly successful, like I've mentioned in the past, at it.
[01:18:04.105 --> 01:18:16.147]  And I'd just like to put a plea out to all InfoWarriors to get together and call in at your local radio, two, three, four at a time, and fill up the call bank with people with knowledge, because it plays to the fear of their mind.
[01:18:16.147 --> 01:18:18.848]  And then if people start thinking, well damn, I don't know nothing about
[01:18:19.335 --> 01:18:21.076]  Absolutely good to hear from you.
[01:18:21.076 --> 01:18:21.957]  Let's talk to Jim in Missouri.
[01:18:21.957 --> 01:18:23.077]  You're on the air, Jim.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:48.322]  The school is in session, and by that I'm going to explain something to America.
[01:18:48.322 --> 01:18:58.425]  America needs to listen up, and this goes directly to the police departments, the Army, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Congress, and directly to Obama.
[01:18:58.425 --> 01:19:09.988]  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:21.243]  That means I pledge allegiance, I promise to be true, to the flag that is the symbol of our country, of the United States of America.
[01:19:21.243 --> 01:19:24.944]  Each state has joined to make our country.
[01:19:24.944 --> 01:19:33.906]  And to the Republic, the Republic is a country where people choose others to make our laws for them.
[01:19:33.906 --> 01:19:39.948]  The government is of, by, and for the people for which it stands.
[01:19:40.987 --> 01:19:43.589]  Flag means the country.
[01:19:43.589 --> 01:19:44.670]  One nation.
[01:19:44.670 --> 01:19:46.491]  A single country.
[01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:47.292]  Under God.
[01:19:47.292 --> 01:19:51.015]  The people believe in a supreme being.
[01:19:51.015 --> 01:19:52.456]  Indivisible.
[01:19:52.456 --> 01:19:55.418]  Country cannot be split into parts.
[01:19:56.317 --> 01:19:57.979]  All right, buddy, I appreciate your call.
[01:19:57.979 --> 01:20:00.140]  Eric, Cynthia, Gabby, Nikki, stay with us.
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:00.981]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:05.565]  Worried that inflation will ruin your retirement or plans of sending your kids to college?
[01:20:05.565 --> 01:20:06.566]  Get a pencil.
[01:20:06.566 --> 01:20:13.953]  Discover how to turn $10,000 into possibly $431,000 in the next 12 to 18 months.
[01:20:13.953 --> 01:20:20.759]  For example, investors who took Scott Smith's advice and invested $10,000 in Silver Standard Resources turned it into $431,000.
[01:20:23.541 --> 01:20:29.325]  And those who invested in Seabridge Gold shares turned $10,000 into $800,000.
[01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:36.130]  Scott Smith is the former senior executive of Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential, an investment newsletter.
[01:20:36.130 --> 01:20:42.214]  He's urging everyone afraid of the nearly $2 trillion in new debt to get his Inflation Survival Kit.
[01:20:42.214 --> 01:20:48.759]  It details seven must-own stocks, including a gold stock with six-figure potential that has doubled since June.
[01:20:49.239 --> 01:20:52.300]  To get his free kit, call 877-727-2461.
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:57.102]  That's 877-727-2461.
[01:20:57.102 --> 01:21:02.144]  Or go to his website, InflationSurvivalKit.com.
[01:21:02.144 --> 01:21:06.165]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:06.165 --> 01:21:09.406]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:14.168]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:21:14.605 --> 01:21:20.592]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.592 --> 01:21:26.158]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:26.158 --> 01:21:35.788]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:35.888 --> 01:21:38.229]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:39.829]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:39.829 --> 01:21:42.290]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:44.411]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.411 --> 01:21:49.552]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:49.552 --> 01:21:58.675]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.083]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[01:22:11.235 --> 01:22:14.396]  As many as 200 more banks are suspect by year's end.
[01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:16.837]  The FDIC is operating in the red.
[01:22:16.837 --> 01:22:17.918]  Who pays for that?
[01:22:17.918 --> 01:22:19.098]  Is your money safe?
[01:22:19.098 --> 01:22:23.160]  The dollar's lost over 95% of its value in the last 60 years.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:26.522]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[01:22:26.522 --> 01:22:27.802]  Ours is not immune.
[01:22:27.802 --> 01:22:29.983]  The time is now to be proactive.
[01:22:29.983 --> 01:22:32.304]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[01:22:32.304 --> 01:22:33.545]  CDs, annuities, 401ks,
[01:22:35.077 --> 01:22:37.239]  IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it.
[01:22:37.239 --> 01:22:41.082]  So decide, do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[01:22:41.082 --> 01:22:42.282]  The choice is yours.
[01:22:42.282 --> 01:22:43.263]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[01:22:43.263 --> 01:22:44.264]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[01:22:44.264 --> 01:22:45.285]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[01:22:45.285 --> 01:22:46.245]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[01:23:01.035 --> 01:23:02.316]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[01:23:02.316 --> 01:23:04.157]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[01:23:04.157 --> 01:23:05.998]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[01:23:05.998 --> 01:23:10.880]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:15.903]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.

[01:23:17.884 --> 01:23:23.427]  Choose4Health brings you 16 powerful ingredients in one delicious chewable for around 75 cents per day.

[01:23:44.618 --> 01:23:45.819]  Just pay shipping and handling.
[01:23:45.959 --> 01:23:46.399]  I think so.
[01:24:30.896 --> 01:24:34.736]  We're a wealthy nation with a lot of power.
[01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:41.437]  Powerful interests wanted to control this country and use it as an engine of control on a planetary scale.
[01:24:41.437 --> 01:24:43.078]  That's now happened.
[01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:45.738]  And they're sucking us dry to fund their world government.
[01:24:45.738 --> 01:24:48.619]  Eric in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:24:48.619 --> 01:24:49.459]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:50.579]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:24:51.917 --> 01:24:55.519]  I just wanted to let you know that I thought Fall of the Republic.
[01:24:55.519 --> 01:25:00.921]  I just watched it today and it is absolutely incredible.
[01:25:00.921 --> 01:25:03.982]  It's one of the best movies that you've done thus far.
[01:25:03.982 --> 01:25:08.343]  I like just about everything that you've ever done.
[01:25:08.343 --> 01:25:20.548]  I first came into listening to you back in 05 and you've really opened my eyes to what's really going on with the government and the New World Order.
[01:25:21.164 --> 01:25:23.004]  And I wanted to commend you for that.
[01:25:23.004 --> 01:25:29.425]  I've been sounding the alarm here in Northwest Florida ever since.
[01:25:29.425 --> 01:25:32.966]  I am an Army veteran of Desert Storm.
[01:25:32.966 --> 01:25:48.909]  I'm also an Oath Keeper and a Free Percenter, and I want you to know that you have a lot of people who are now mobilizing based on the information that you have brought to light, and I wanted to let you know that
[01:25:50.942 --> 01:25:59.024]  We think the best of you and please keep up the good work.
[01:25:59.024 --> 01:26:09.646]  It's very hard nowadays for people to get away from the corporate media and what they're spinning everything out to be.
[01:26:09.646 --> 01:26:15.167]  And actually being able to look at information that you can independently research
[01:26:15.896 --> 01:26:16.936]  Sports validity.
[01:26:16.936 --> 01:26:21.738]  And that's how I came into listening to your show in the first place.
[01:26:21.738 --> 01:26:29.520]  I did exactly what you said to do, which is, don't take my word for it, independently verify the facts.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.521]  And I've done so.
[01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:41.504]  And I also liked the fact that in Follow the Republic, the point was made that having the information is just the first step.
[01:26:42.210 --> 01:26:58.590]  If you don't do anything with that information, if you don't start preparing and start motivating yourself to resist the New World Order, having the knowledge doesn't do anything without the will to act upon it.
[01:26:58.590 --> 01:26:59.351]  Absolutely.
[01:26:59.351 --> 01:27:01.614]  And I thought that was a great point.
[01:27:02.216 --> 01:27:07.980]  Well, there are so many corporate tricks in the media, but their biggest trick is fake fights.
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:23.973]  Fox News attacks CNN, CNN attacks Fox News, the White House comes out and attacks Limbaugh and Beck to make it look like they're actually threatened by them and to make it look like, oh, well, if Obama's bad, Fox and Rush Limbaugh must be good.
[01:27:24.753 --> 01:27:30.705]  When the Republicans are only the party out of power, so they can now act like they're anti-New World Order.
[01:27:30.705 --> 01:27:36.256]  And of course that doesn't mean all Republicans are bad, or all Democrats are bad, but the leadership themselves...
[01:27:37.079 --> 01:27:38.740]  We're on the same page.
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:44.444]  And so they lay out this choice, like, are you going to be for the Cowboys or the Titans?
[01:27:44.444 --> 01:27:47.586]  Are you going to be for the Jaguars or are you going to be for the Seahawks?
[01:27:47.586 --> 01:27:49.367]  And then people just, well, I'll choose that.
[01:27:49.367 --> 01:27:52.990]  It's kind of like a trick that a used car salesman will say, well, you've got a choice.
[01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:54.971]  You can buy one of these three cars.
[01:27:54.971 --> 01:28:01.956]  And a lot of people in a mind game go ahead and buy one of the cars, not thinking, well, wait, I can go buy a car somewhere else.
[01:28:01.956 --> 01:28:03.937]  It's very simple little mind games
[01:28:04.958 --> 01:28:05.659]  That they play.
[01:28:05.659 --> 01:28:12.490]  But on the subject of Follow the Republic, you no doubt found my show because people told you about it.
[01:28:12.490 --> 01:28:14.673]  Whether it was on the internet or in person.
[01:28:14.673 --> 01:28:19.962]  Others will now find the radio show, find the films because you are now going to pay it forward and tell them about it.
[01:28:20.362 --> 01:28:29.031]  Other people will make their own films, their own YouTube videos, their own radio shows, will be leaders in their own right, in their area, and many hands make light work.
[01:28:29.031 --> 01:28:42.285]  Together, moving against the common enemy, the globalists, we are going to win this thing if we realize that we can win and have a manifesto that is our Constitution and Bill of Rights, a blueprint, an idea,
[01:28:43.166 --> 01:28:44.787]  That we move together.
[01:28:44.787 --> 01:28:54.190]  Even though we're not communicating with each other across the nation every day, in every way, it's a idea that we're reaching for and that idea is bulletproof.
[01:28:54.190 --> 01:28:56.391]  So, it is up to you.
[01:28:56.391 --> 01:28:57.712]  I make the films.
[01:28:57.712 --> 01:28:59.292]  People support me so I can make them.
[01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:00.433]  That's symbiotic.
[01:29:00.433 --> 01:29:03.914]  But 99% of it is now in your hands.
[01:29:03.914 --> 01:29:05.215]  This is your film.
[01:29:05.215 --> 01:29:07.936]  Follow the Republic belongs to you.
[01:29:07.936 --> 01:29:11.077]  That's why I make these films and then give them out to the public.
[01:29:11.577 --> 01:29:16.481]  And the people give us the seed money by buying the DVDs, by being PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[01:29:16.481 --> 01:29:17.202]  They get it first.
[01:29:17.202 --> 01:29:19.223]  They get the best quality.
[01:29:19.223 --> 01:29:22.746]  And then we carry the ball forward to others.
[01:29:22.746 --> 01:29:28.471]  And because the tyranny is coming in like a flood right now, people are really ready to listen.
[01:29:28.471 --> 01:29:30.012]  We have fertile fields.
[01:29:30.012 --> 01:29:31.353]  We have plenty of rain.
[01:29:31.353 --> 01:29:32.314]  We have sunshine.
[01:29:33.635 --> 01:29:38.159]  The tyranny is actually generating growth in the Tree of Liberty.
[01:29:38.159 --> 01:29:39.340]  And so God bless you.
[01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:41.241]  I salute you, Eric, in Florida.
[01:29:41.241 --> 01:29:48.968]  Keep up the great work and let's just intensify everything we are doing right now with Follow the Republic.
[01:29:48.968 --> 01:29:51.450]  This is an information warfare weapon.
[01:29:51.450 --> 01:29:52.831]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.831 --> 01:29:55.373]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.373 --> 01:29:58.056]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.781 --> 01:30:05.805]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:05.805 --> 01:30:09.048]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.048 --> 01:30:13.832]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:30:13.832 --> 01:30:20.238]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:20.238 --> 01:30:22.481]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:23.301]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:23.301 --> 01:30:23.822]  Bernanke?
[01:30:23.822 --> 01:30:24.502]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:24.502 --> 01:30:25.783]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:25.783 --> 01:30:28.024]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:41.914 --> 01:30:49.182]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:49.182 --> 01:30:58.313]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:00.984 --> 01:31:03.987]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.987 --> 01:31:09.334]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.334 --> 01:31:11.376]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.376 --> 01:31:16.382]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.382 --> 01:31:17.303]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.543 --> 01:31:18.664]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.664 --> 01:31:20.545]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.545 --> 01:31:21.625]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.625 --> 01:31:23.826]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.826 --> 01:31:25.167]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.167 --> 01:31:26.708]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.708 --> 01:31:31.971]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.971 --> 01:31:35.553]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.553 --> 01:31:39.015]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.375 --> 01:31:40.596]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.596 --> 01:31:41.497]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.497 --> 01:31:42.597]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.597 --> 01:31:43.538]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.538 --> 01:31:44.619]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.619 --> 01:31:47.681]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.681 --> 01:31:49.442]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.442 --> 01:31:50.363]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:59.875 --> 01:32:09.998]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[01:32:09.998 --> 01:32:11.599]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:32:11.599 --> 01:32:12.679]  It's very real.
[01:32:12.679 --> 01:32:13.020]  I know.
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:17.241]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:32:17.241 --> 01:32:20.482]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.
[01:32:20.482 --> 01:32:28.685]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecola Blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:35.831]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[01:32:35.831 --> 01:32:44.539]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:32:44.539 --> 01:32:49.243]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:49.243 --> 01:32:49.443]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:55.228 --> 01:33:10.253]  Or visit a Cola Blue on the web at E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com today.
[01:33:10.253 --> 01:33:12.794]  Gerald Salente is coming up in T-minus 27 minutes.
[01:33:12.794 --> 01:33:18.817]  We're going to start simulcasting the radio show in living color via TV at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:33:25.714 --> 01:33:31.599]  You tell them, Bob Dylan, I can see the day coming when even your home garden is going to be against the law.
[01:33:31.599 --> 01:33:34.762]  It's basically already happening.
[01:33:34.762 --> 01:33:39.206]  They want inspections of your neighborhood gardens to make sure you're not growing marijuana.
[01:33:39.206 --> 01:33:45.692]  You're guilty until proven innocent in Tulsa, Oklahoma and other areas around the country.
[01:33:48.578 --> 01:33:50.339]  Democracy don't rule the world.
[01:33:50.339 --> 01:33:52.841]  You better get that through your head.
[01:33:52.841 --> 01:33:59.445]  This world is ruled by violence, but I guess that's better left unsaid.
[01:33:59.445 --> 01:34:05.149]  From Broadway to the Milky Way, that's a lot of territory indeed.
[01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:08.352]  Cause a man's gonna do what a man's gotta do.
[01:34:08.352 --> 01:34:11.914]  Oh yeah, it's sundown on the Union.
[01:34:11.914 --> 01:34:15.076]  The fall of the Republic.
[01:34:15.076 --> 01:34:16.477]  In fact, cue that up again, John.
[01:34:16.477 --> 01:34:17.378]  I want to go on a break.
[01:34:18.476 --> 01:34:23.758]  And play about two minutes of that going out, because I guess that's our new anthem here.
[01:34:23.758 --> 01:34:32.941]  Unless we wake up, shake off the mind-numb days, the mesmerized trance we're under, and get angry.
[01:34:32.941 --> 01:34:40.764]  When you finally look at the information, when you finally do research for yourself, and you find out what's really going on, you're going to say, Alex Jones wasn't crazy.
[01:34:40.764 --> 01:34:42.245]  Alex Jones wasn't a hothead.
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:51.782]  I was reading a big report out of the London Guardian by a top anthropologist about how aggressive men used to be, how much stronger men were.
[01:34:51.782 --> 01:34:54.422]  We have been domesticated.
[01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:57.583]  I don't want to say we've been feminized because women have always fought and been strong too.
[01:34:57.583 --> 01:34:59.123]  We've been domesticated.
[01:34:59.123 --> 01:35:00.843]  We've been castrated.
[01:35:00.843 --> 01:35:09.565]  We have been taught that we're supposed to talk like Mr. Rogers and be real soft and sit there like a bunch of children and have the government tell us what to do.
[01:35:09.565 --> 01:35:10.425]  No!
[01:35:10.425 --> 01:35:13.546]  We're supposed to grow some hair on our chest, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:17.577 --> 01:35:22.518]  I mean, you know, a hundred years ago, it was a sign of manhood to be bald.
[01:35:22.518 --> 01:35:24.338]  That meant you had a lot of testosterone.
[01:35:24.338 --> 01:35:26.399]  Women thought that looked good.
[01:35:26.399 --> 01:35:35.461]  Then Madison Avenue taught us that it was unnatural and bad and that, and, and, and that, you know, they had to make us all feel inadequate about ourselves.
[01:35:35.461 --> 01:35:45.883]  It's all just a load of baloney, an absolute crock of propaganda, of cockamamie, of bunk.
[01:35:45.883 --> 01:35:46.003]  And
[01:35:47.592 --> 01:35:48.973]  I am not going to be a slave.
[01:35:48.973 --> 01:35:51.575]  I mean, in all intents and purposes, the slave grid's all around me.
[01:35:51.575 --> 01:35:54.556]  But I mentally, psychologically, I know what I'm in.
[01:35:54.556 --> 01:35:56.237]  I'm aware of the battlefield.
[01:35:56.237 --> 01:35:57.458]  And all I do is study it.
[01:35:57.458 --> 01:36:07.464]  And I'm here to tell you, if you would just look under the rock and see what I've seen, then I wouldn't have to sit here and motivate you to take action.
[01:36:07.464 --> 01:36:09.705]  I desperately just want to reach people.
[01:36:09.705 --> 01:36:11.767]  I desperately want to warn people.
[01:36:11.767 --> 01:36:15.369]  I don't want to see people getting conned or getting manipulated.
[01:36:17.389 --> 01:36:34.166]  It's like if you saw your neighbor drive off from their parking lot, and there was a trail of gasoline behind the car, and you tell them about it and they laugh at you, and then two days later their car blows up.
[01:36:34.166 --> 01:36:35.767]  You know that's a true story.
[01:36:35.767 --> 01:36:40.152]  When I was in high school, went to a couple years in Dallas, a couple years here, when I was a senior in high school,
[01:36:41.946 --> 01:36:42.326]  I don't know.
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.941]  Three centimeter wide trail of gasoline.
[01:37:02.941 --> 01:37:05.341]  I reached over, touched it, smelled it, it was gasoline.
[01:37:05.341 --> 01:37:09.483]  I saw him that evening and I said, uh, your car's got a trail of gasoline behind it.
[01:37:09.483 --> 01:37:10.443]  They started laughing at me.
[01:37:10.443 --> 01:37:13.544]  I went, oh yeah, okay, thanks kid.
[01:37:13.544 --> 01:37:16.705]  And it was a middle-aged yuppie.
[01:37:16.705 --> 01:37:25.628]  And I told him, you know, there's no way some kid could tell him this, and I said, no, seriously sir, that could really catch your car on fire.
[01:37:25.628 --> 01:37:28.809]  It's a Super Beetle, it takes gasoline, regular gasoline, not diesel.
[01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:29.669]  Extremely explosive.
[01:37:31.212 --> 01:37:37.175]  And about a month later, he comes up and apologizes to me and said, yeah, I was driving my daughter to school.
[01:37:37.175 --> 01:37:39.296]  It caught on fire and the whole car burned up.
[01:37:39.296 --> 01:37:41.898]  The fire department had to come.
[01:37:41.898 --> 01:37:42.878]  Blew up!
[01:37:42.878 --> 01:37:46.500]  Now, I'm not some genius, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:59.407]  If I see a trail of gasoline, like in a Looney Tunes, Wile E. Coyote cartoon, a trail of gasoline, a trail, a solid trail of gasoline behind the rear engine car,
[01:38:02.435 --> 01:38:05.116]  I know that you're going to end up having your engine blow up.
[01:38:05.116 --> 01:38:07.558]  I mean, it's a 99% chance.
[01:38:07.558 --> 01:38:11.960]  If you drive the car long enough, it's going to blow up.
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:16.022]  And I know the vaccines are designed to brain damage you.
[01:38:16.022 --> 01:38:23.185]  When they overly brain damage you, when they do too good of a job, you get so brain damaged and paralyzed that it's then obvious.
[01:38:23.185 --> 01:38:23.946]  They don't want that.
[01:38:25.216 --> 01:38:28.377]  So they try to balance it, and that's in government documents.
[01:38:28.377 --> 01:38:31.218]  That's why you say the public's stupid and can't seem to understand?
[01:38:31.218 --> 01:38:32.899]  They're brain damaged!
[01:38:32.899 --> 01:38:38.501]  You know, we've gotten tours of the Austin Water Treatment Facility.
[01:38:38.501 --> 01:38:39.681]  We've gotten tours of it.
[01:38:39.681 --> 01:38:41.902]  Went and did an interview with them as well.
[01:38:41.902 --> 01:38:46.664]  We're gonna put that in the upcoming film.
[01:38:46.664 --> 01:38:54.507]  And we got a tour with a local anti-fluoride action group, and there are quite a few companies, but I know it's
[01:38:57.304 --> 01:39:07.270]  I know it's less than 15 because we've done some research, but there are a handful of big companies that have toxic waste byproducts.
[01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:10.932]  And I know I talk about this all the time, but what else, what am I supposed to talk about here?
[01:39:10.932 --> 01:39:14.093]  This is the stuff that really matters.
[01:39:14.093 --> 01:39:18.916]  And if you look at the different companies, each company has a different mix.
[01:39:18.916 --> 01:39:23.599]  And it's whatever's coming out of their aluminum purification plant,
[01:39:24.781 --> 01:39:27.983]  It's whatever's coming out of their fertilizer production plant.
[01:39:27.983 --> 01:39:29.264]  You know where most fertilizer comes from?
[01:39:29.264 --> 01:39:35.909]  They mine limestone that has the chemicals in it that plants need.
[01:39:35.909 --> 01:39:39.272]  Or in the words of idiocracy, it's got the electrolytes plants crave.
[01:39:39.272 --> 01:39:39.912]  Brondo.
[01:39:39.912 --> 01:39:40.673]  I'm joking.
[01:39:40.673 --> 01:39:46.057]  The point is, that depending on the mix, it's between 150, and I'm being general here,
[01:39:47.332 --> 01:39:51.176]  People go nitpicking, go, it was 156 in the Austin water supply.
[01:39:51.176 --> 01:39:52.397]  You said 150.
[01:39:52.397 --> 01:39:53.958]  Whatever.
[01:39:53.958 --> 01:40:02.626]  It's around 150 to over 300 different deadly chemicals they put in your water and it's called fluoride.
[01:40:02.626 --> 01:40:07.771]  Oh, it's got sodium fluoride and several other variants of fluoride in it.
[01:40:08.786 --> 01:40:16.128]  And I've had the head of the EPA Union on who's a top PhD doctorate in toxicology here on the show.
[01:40:16.128 --> 01:40:16.908]  We had him on about a year ago.
[01:40:16.908 --> 01:40:19.109]  We should get him back on.
[01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.589]  Forget his name.
[01:40:19.589 --> 01:40:22.910]  You can just Google head of EPA Union says fluoridation deadly.
[01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:28.412]  90% is another headline of EPA scientists write letter to their own department saying please take it out of water.
[01:40:30.134 --> 01:40:43.518]  The point is, is that it's hundreds of chemicals, different mixes of mercury, lead, arsenic, and they go mine this limestone, and that's the byproduct that they don't put in the fertilizer.
[01:40:43.518 --> 01:40:51.980]  The fertilizer companies also have food crop fertilizer.
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:57.222]  They have food crop fertilizer that by law can't have these poisons in it, and they have lawn fertilizer.
[01:40:57.222 --> 01:40:58.542]  You want to learn what's in your water?
[01:40:59.918 --> 01:41:09.522]  Go to Home Depot or Lowe's or your hardware store and go read lawn fertilizer ingredients versus garden fertilizer.
[01:41:09.522 --> 01:41:15.124]  It will say on lawn fertilizer, do not put this on your garden.
[01:41:15.124 --> 01:41:20.706]  And it will list deadly chemicals and poisons that are in it.
[01:41:20.706 --> 01:41:22.987]  Do you hear the environmentalists not wanting that put on your yard?
[01:41:22.987 --> 01:41:24.788]  It's the toxic waste they're getting rid of.
[01:41:24.788 --> 01:41:29.390]  And you put it on your yard and it goes down the drain, it goes down the gutters into your water supplies.
[01:41:30.393 --> 01:41:34.155]  Now, the same stuff is dumped in your water.
[01:41:34.155 --> 01:41:39.538]  And you should have seen the facility in Austin where they put the chemicals in.
[01:41:39.538 --> 01:41:41.579]  The concrete's all eaten.
[01:41:41.579 --> 01:41:43.360]  This stuff eats through concrete.
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:49.703]  You're drinking that, and we know at one part per million, sodium fluoride brain damages and doubles your chance of bone cancer.
[01:41:49.703 --> 01:41:50.964]  Those are government's own numbers.
[01:41:50.964 --> 01:41:52.525]  But this isn't just sodium fluoride.
[01:41:52.525 --> 01:41:53.865]  It's a whole bunch of different types.
[01:41:53.865 --> 01:41:58.628]  And all these other poisons, and you are drinking it.
[01:42:02.133 --> 01:42:05.122]  Now, that is forced medication.
[01:42:08.513 --> 01:42:14.136]  But what really has been hitting me the last few days is what a coward and what a pathetic blob I am.
[01:42:14.136 --> 01:42:15.617]  And how conditioned I am.
[01:42:15.617 --> 01:42:17.518]  And how stupid I am.
[01:42:17.518 --> 01:42:19.480]  And how I'm not doing enough.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:27.945]  And how I haven't gotten outraged enough to consciously see how outrageous it is to really have it come home.
[01:42:27.945 --> 01:42:30.466]  How I've grown up in all of this and just accepted it.
[01:42:30.466 --> 01:42:32.387]  I know they're poisoning me by design.
[01:42:32.387 --> 01:42:33.408]  I have their own documents.
[01:42:33.408 --> 01:42:36.370]  I know what's in there.
[01:42:36.370 --> 01:42:37.991]  And that goes for everybody else in this country.
[01:42:39.359 --> 01:42:45.142]  There shouldn't be fluoride in the Austin water one week from now.
[01:42:45.142 --> 01:42:47.623]  It should be out now.
[01:42:47.623 --> 01:42:53.946]  Those bastards at the city councils that laugh at you while their children drink this stuff while they drink it?
[01:42:53.946 --> 01:43:02.230]  Even if you try to filter it, you still, in swimming pools or in your shower, you breathe it, it goes through your skin, it's the biggest organ in your body.
[01:43:02.230 --> 01:43:06.852]  The point is, I'm going to talk more and more about this, they shouldn't be forcing us to take their vaccines.
[01:43:06.852 --> 01:43:07.833]  We shouldn't be putting up
[01:43:08.652 --> 01:43:14.375]  With the establishment telling us we've got to have this stuff in our water.
[01:43:14.375 --> 01:43:16.796]  I mean, it's over, bastards!
[01:43:16.796 --> 01:43:18.056]  Do you understand?
[01:43:18.056 --> 01:43:20.277]  Get angry, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:43:20.277 --> 01:43:22.258]  All of you listening, go to your city council.
[01:43:22.258 --> 01:43:23.719]  Every week, it's worth it!
[01:43:23.719 --> 01:43:27.020]  You'll save thousands of people in your town from brain damage and cancer.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:28.661]  And say, listen, you little bastards!
[01:43:29.341 --> 01:43:39.688]  You can get the local water department's own list of what's in it, and say, here's a hundred and fifty, or here's two hundred and seventy, or whatever the case is with your town, with whatever crap they're buying.
[01:43:39.688 --> 01:43:42.469]  Get it out of my water right now, you bastards!
[01:43:42.469 --> 01:43:57.239]  If you caught me in your house, let's say you kept a water jug in the refrigerator like a lot of people do, and you caught me in there putting a couple drops of two hundred plus deadly poisons in there, there'd be something wrong with you if you didn't
[01:43:58.359 --> 01:44:04.065]  Grab a shotgun out of your closet and blow me to kingdom come, or if you didn't beat the living daylights out of me.
[01:44:04.065 --> 01:44:07.169]  But when the government does it, oh, it's completely normal!
[01:44:07.169 --> 01:44:17.740]  All right, I'm gonna shut up, go back to your calls after we got a break, and we've got Gerald Cilente coming up, the big news blitz as well, in the last hour today.
[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:19.222]  But I wanted to bring Steve Shank up.
[01:44:21.311 --> 01:44:29.276]  Because he's the founder-owner of the J. Michael Stevens Group, the biggest, most continually operating, highest quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid, storable food.
[01:44:29.276 --> 01:44:38.182]  It's where I chose to get my storable food when I tried out a bunch of other places, and he's got a lot of new specials for people, and we're honored to have him on here with us today until we go to break.
[01:44:38.182 --> 01:44:39.283]  Steve, good to have you on with us.
[01:44:39.283 --> 01:44:40.564]  What'd you think of that last rant?
[01:44:41.274 --> 01:44:42.996]  Well, I love that, Alex.
[01:44:42.996 --> 01:44:47.902]  We've been fighting that issue for a lot of years in every community in this country.
[01:44:47.902 --> 01:44:50.525]  People are aware of that fluoride.
[01:44:50.525 --> 01:44:52.788]  It is toxic waste.
[01:44:52.788 --> 01:44:56.372]  It used to be left over from the aluminum industry, and now they're just creating it.
[01:44:56.372 --> 01:44:57.494]  It's just absolutely pathetic.
[01:44:58.829 --> 01:45:01.090]  Absolutely pathetic.
[01:45:01.090 --> 01:45:03.350]  We have so much going on.
[01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:13.153]  Not only are they putting junk in the water, but we've been working for two years now to try and get everything out of the supplies that we build.
[01:45:13.153 --> 01:45:18.195]  And we just came out with a new product line called Nutraversal Foods.
[01:45:18.195 --> 01:45:24.777]  And this is clear of hydrogenated oil, genetically altered stuff and everything.
[01:45:25.752 --> 01:45:39.079]  And I tell you what, just to get the poisons out of the raw materials that the foods are processed from is absolutely a huge job in this country right now.
[01:45:39.079 --> 01:45:41.741]  Let alone the water situation.
[01:45:41.741 --> 01:45:48.924]  But I tell you what, I have to congratulate you on this last video that you put together.
[01:45:48.924 --> 01:45:51.706]  This is absolutely what everyone needs to get.
[01:45:52.483 --> 01:46:13.623]  The first step that they need to do is they need to get that and then people have to realize in every country we've got we've got our good service people over there fighting and dying in countries starting with Vietnam and and all these little brush fire and huge wars since then losing those battles
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:27.227]  And one of the things that folks have to realize is Saddam Hussein, before he was kicked out of power, or taken out of power, told all of his people to put in what?
[01:46:27.227 --> 01:46:33.130]  Not ammunition to deal with this, with the oncoming onslaught, but food.
[01:46:34.150 --> 01:46:38.173]  Why did the Soviets get kicked out of Iraq?
[01:46:38.173 --> 01:46:54.224]  Because all those little folks that were running around, they had old beat-up rifles that couldn't even match the archaic stuff that we had from World War I. But they still kicked the Soviets out because the main thing that they did was they had food.
[01:46:54.224 --> 01:47:00.568]  Now what people have to do, they have to get your last DVD, and they have to listen to it.
[01:47:01.445 --> 01:47:23.256]  And what they have to do once they've listened to that is realize that the only way that they can maintain their liberty and their chance at fighting this war is to be able to sustain themselves because this system, you mentioned it just before you went into your little rant about the fact that they are going to pass legislation where people are not going to be able to even have their own garden.
[01:47:24.451 --> 01:47:30.774]  The best way for people to have their own gardens, very simply right now, is to own the food.
[01:47:30.774 --> 01:47:36.337]  And we just came out with a new product, this Nutraversal stuff, that is absolutely phenomenal.
[01:47:36.337 --> 01:47:37.698]  It's pure food.
[01:47:37.698 --> 01:47:40.859]  It has better flavor than any restaurants you can get.
[01:47:40.859 --> 01:47:44.121]  It's priced better than you can buy groceries.
[01:47:44.121 --> 01:47:51.805]  And very simply, what it's put together to do, it comes in what we call a seven-day responder.
[01:47:52.495 --> 01:48:03.459]  This is a whole week's worth of food in a box that's one foot square and four inches deep, less than a third of a cubic yard, or cubic foot, I'm sorry.
[01:48:03.459 --> 01:48:07.461]  And what that does is it provides two cup meals.
[01:48:07.461 --> 01:48:13.003]  In other words, it provides twice the size, double meals, three meals a day plus snacks.
[01:48:13.003 --> 01:48:19.046]  And people literally can put this in that are challenged financially, can't put in a whole year's supply.
[01:48:19.046 --> 01:48:20.406]  They can put in a week at a time.
[01:48:20.406 --> 01:48:21.847]  They can put in four weeks at a time.
[01:48:22.702 --> 01:48:22.842]  Yeah.
[01:48:35.845 --> 01:48:47.553]  This process whereby they're increasing the cost of electricity for drying foods and working with the farmers and they're going after the farmers for their emissions.
[01:48:47.553 --> 01:48:55.598]  They're claiming that this global warming fiasco is largely the result of farmers putting out more greenhouse gases.
[01:48:56.498 --> 01:49:00.661]  Yeah, they're saying they're going to tax all the farmers.
[01:49:00.661 --> 01:49:01.762]  They're going to tax all the farmers.
[01:49:01.762 --> 01:49:04.944]  Look, my reason for having storable food, I promote whatever I do.
[01:49:04.944 --> 01:49:08.027]  What I think is good for Alex Jones, I tell everybody I think they should do.
[01:49:08.027 --> 01:49:09.788]  People can take it or leave it if they want.
[01:49:09.788 --> 01:49:23.638]  With all the talk of depression, the end of the dollar, with all this talk of war, the way the whole world's going, 90% of people were self-sufficient in the Great Depression, and university studies say 7 million starved to death over the nine years.
[01:49:24.378 --> 01:49:33.746]  Folks are insane if they don't have food, firearms, gold, water filters, and food is the most important along with water.
[01:49:33.746 --> 01:49:37.109]  I have three one-year supplies of food from you.
[01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:38.550]  It lasts more than 10 years.
[01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:39.891]  I tested out other people's stuff.
[01:49:39.891 --> 01:49:40.451]  It was crap.
[01:49:41.272 --> 01:49:44.715]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is the way to go and be secure.
[01:49:44.715 --> 01:49:48.479]  You got one-year supplies, seven-day supplies, month supplies.
[01:49:48.479 --> 01:49:52.383]  These are big, high-quality, tasty meals that are dehydrated.
[01:49:52.383 --> 01:49:54.105]  You've got all different sorts of systems.
[01:49:54.105 --> 01:49:57.228]  People have got to go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:49:57.228 --> 01:50:00.391]  That's efoodsdirect.com today.
[01:50:00.991 --> 01:50:01.211]  It's 800-409-5633.
[01:50:01.211 --> 01:50:01.351]  800-409-5633.
[01:50:01.351 --> 01:50:02.192]  Alex, I appreciate you.
[01:50:26.662 --> 01:50:27.563]  800-409-5633.
[01:50:27.563 --> 01:50:29.225]  People can also call and get a free brochure.
[01:50:29.225 --> 01:50:32.870]  There's a lot of videos and materials on eFoodsDirect.
[01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:39.279]  It's the letter E, then foodsdirect.com, big banners on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and all our other major
[01:50:40.234 --> 01:50:43.316]  Sites, 800-409-5633.
[01:50:43.316 --> 01:50:45.517]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is where I get my storable food.
[01:50:45.517 --> 01:50:47.058]  This is what I believe in.
[01:50:47.058 --> 01:50:49.520]  This is where I think you should go.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:51.981]  Steve Schenck, thank you so much for all you do.

[01:51:39.121 --> 01:51:39.481]  I think so.
[01:52:02.481 --> 01:52:06.505]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:06.505 --> 01:52:09.748]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:09.748 --> 01:52:14.573]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:14.573 --> 01:52:20.959]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:20.959 --> 01:52:23.181]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:52:23.721 --> 01:52:25.022]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:25.022 --> 01:52:26.523]  And right now in Washington D.C.
[01:52:46.995 --> 01:52:49.899]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:49.899 --> 01:52:58.991]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:53:01.141 --> 01:53:05.644]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[01:53:05.644 --> 01:53:09.927]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[01:53:09.927 --> 01:53:20.753]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[01:53:20.753 --> 01:53:29.579]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful immune system-building blocks defending your body against natural and man-made viruses, but they also assist your body in healing
[01:53:33.211 --> 01:53:33.651]  Let's do it!
[01:54:06.488 --> 01:54:20.597]  We're going to come back.
[01:54:20.597 --> 01:54:21.758]  Start taking your phone calls.
[01:54:21.758 --> 01:54:22.879]  Gerald Cilente is coming up.
[01:54:22.879 --> 01:54:26.241]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv, the start of the next hour.
[01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:32.041]  I was talking to Steve during the break.
[01:54:32.041 --> 01:54:35.563]  Steve, I'm flattered that you've already seen Fall of the Republic.
[01:54:35.563 --> 01:54:38.405]  I guess you watch it at PrisonPlanet.tv?
[01:54:38.405 --> 01:54:42.208]  Absolutely, and I've got to say something.
[01:54:42.208 --> 01:54:46.931]  Listeners, you've heard Alex and I talk about food, food, food for a long time.
[01:54:46.931 --> 01:54:49.592]  We've talked about how it's going to save your bacon.
[01:54:49.592 --> 01:54:56.697]  But I've got to tell you, before you even think about the food, you have to watch Fall of the Republic.
[01:54:57.597 --> 01:55:23.378]  Because what Alex has done with this thing is done a masterful job of summarizing all of the garbage that's being thrown at us in such a way that you can see exactly how it's going to affect you, exactly what you need to do, and then realize that every nation that has come under the thumb of the New World Order has done it because people weren't able to sustain themselves and resist.
[01:55:24.058 --> 01:55:34.822]  The way that we're facing resistance with our own troops over there is the fact that these people, Saddam Hussein and some of the other leaders, tell their people to get food in.
[01:55:34.822 --> 01:55:45.106]  Well, we're telling you the same thing, but the first thing you've got to do is get your head on straight and realize that what Alex is telling you is a summary of what's going to happen in this country.
[01:55:45.106 --> 01:55:46.467]  It's prophecy, almost.
[01:55:47.469 --> 01:55:52.015]  Well, we're going off their own battle plans, their own statements, but that's a good way to put it.
[01:55:52.015 --> 01:55:53.758]  Fall of the Republic is a briefing.
[01:55:53.758 --> 01:55:59.165]  It's a two-hour, 24-minute, the only pitfall is for the average mind-numb person.
[01:55:59.165 --> 01:56:02.610]  They may not have the attention span, but get them to watch it in two parts.
[01:56:03.451 --> 01:56:06.634]  And there's an online bibliography at fallrepublic.com.
[01:56:06.634 --> 01:56:10.077]  All the different articles we use, Curt and Emo link to quite a few of them.
[01:56:10.077 --> 01:56:14.421]  It's not as detailed as the whatistheendgame.com bibliography for Endgame.
[01:56:14.421 --> 01:56:15.982]  We've just been so busy.
[01:56:15.982 --> 01:56:18.104]  But the point is they can watch this film
[01:56:18.584 --> 01:56:21.366]  And then finally understand the left-right paradigm.
[01:56:21.366 --> 01:56:22.607]  See how the scam works.
[01:56:22.607 --> 01:56:23.948]  See who the enemies are.
[01:56:23.948 --> 01:56:26.610]  Well, regardless, Steve, thank you for all your support.
[01:56:26.610 --> 01:56:28.231]  Thank you for putting out high-quality food.
[01:56:28.231 --> 01:56:31.814]  This new line of the Nutraversal Foods is amazing.
[01:56:31.814 --> 01:56:40.139]  People should at least go read about it at efoodsdirect.com or get a mail-out to themselves by calling the toll-free number 800-409-5633.
[01:56:40.139 --> 01:56:40.240]  800-409-5633.
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:41.360]  Steve, have a great weekend.
[01:56:46.912 --> 01:56:48.013]  Hey, you too, Alex.
[01:56:48.013 --> 01:56:48.833]  Take care.
[01:56:48.833 --> 01:56:50.674]  God bless you.
[01:56:50.674 --> 01:56:52.315]  Again, we got two hours coming up.
[01:56:52.315 --> 01:56:57.117]  Gerald Cilente, your phone calls, a ton of news I haven't even gotten into yet.
[01:56:57.117 --> 01:56:59.899]  I'm like somebody who's got to march up a mountain.
[01:56:59.899 --> 01:57:04.901]  I'm kind of heavy breathing, bracing myself to march up this mountain with these two stacks of news I've got.
[01:57:04.901 --> 01:57:06.502]  They're all off the charts.
[01:57:06.502 --> 01:57:10.064]  But I wanted to go out to break with Sundown on the Union.
[01:57:10.064 --> 01:57:15.486]  You're going to make the decision on whether or not the Globalists are successful in bringing down the Republic.
[01:57:15.486 --> 01:57:16.247]  Here's Bob Dylan.
[01:57:18.487 --> 01:57:41.081]  My tablecloth's from Malaysia My belt buckle's from the Amazon You know this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines And the car I drive is a Chevrolet It was put together down in Argentina By a guy making 30 cents a day
[01:57:50.063 --> 01:58:08.315]  Sure was a good idea Till we got in the way, yeah!
[01:58:08.315 --> 01:58:18.862]  Well, the set-piece is from Hong Kong And the pearls are from Japan Well, the dark colour's from India
[01:58:21.033 --> 01:58:26.617]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:26.617 --> 01:58:30.900]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.737 --> 01:58:56.044]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:58:56.044 --> 01:59:00.570]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:59:00.570 --> 01:59:02.853]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:59:02.853 --> 01:59:04.475]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:59:04.475 --> 01:59:05.517]  There is a solution.
[01:59:05.737 --> 01:59:14.159]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:59:14.159 --> 01:59:21.601]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:59:27.643 --> 01:59:33.669]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:59:53.775 --> 01:59:56.176]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.176 --> 02:00:05.540]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:06.841]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.841 --> 02:00:08.602]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.602 --> 02:00:10.363]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.363 --> 02:00:11.943]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.943 --> 02:00:13.884]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.884 --> 02:00:17.686]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.686 --> 02:00:20.027]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:20.939 --> 02:00:30.365]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.365 --> 02:00:34.527]  Well, he is one of the premier transforecasters out there.
[02:00:34.527 --> 02:00:35.828]  And he's Gerald Cilente.
[02:00:35.828 --> 02:00:37.088]  He's with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:00:37.088 --> 02:00:40.670]  We're going to open the phones up as well for everybody that are patiently holding.
[02:00:40.670 --> 02:00:43.872]  Whatever the issue is, Gerald Cilente can comment on it.
[02:00:43.872 --> 02:00:46.134]  We'll also be posting his website up on screen.
[02:00:47.088 --> 02:00:51.616]  I need to mail him a copy of the DVD because he's a big part of it.
[02:00:51.616 --> 02:00:53.139]  Fall of the Republic is now out.
[02:00:53.139 --> 02:00:54.100]  It dropped yesterday.
[02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:56.805]  If you want your copy, it's available at Infowars.com.
[02:00:58.477 --> 02:01:00.499]  Gerald Cilente, it is great to have you here.
[02:01:00.499 --> 02:01:01.720]  I want to talk about the dollar.
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:04.542]  I want to get into what's happening with gold.
[02:01:04.542 --> 02:01:13.108]  I want to get into what's happening with the police and the government trying, like you said years ago, to raise all these taxes in the middle of a depression.
[02:01:13.108 --> 02:01:15.810]  The media lying, saying we're in a jobless recovery.
[02:01:15.810 --> 02:01:19.512]  I remember you a year ago on this show saying they would call it a jobless recovery.
[02:01:20.493 --> 02:01:23.215]  And I guess they stole your term because that's what they're saying.
[02:01:23.215 --> 02:01:28.538]  We're going to discuss it all today, but what's most important on Gerald Salente's plate?
[02:01:28.538 --> 02:01:31.040]  What do you want to talk about out of the gates?
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:44.369]  Well, first I'd like to talk about your new DVD and the impact that you're making all over the world as being a leader in the Second American Revolution.
[02:01:44.369 --> 02:01:47.451]  Because the Second American Revolution has begun.
[02:01:48.539 --> 02:01:54.608]  And it began with the tea parties and the tax protests in April 15th.
[02:01:54.608 --> 02:02:03.560]  It accelerated with the rallies and protests on the 4th of July, with people screaming for taxation without representation.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:06.362]  Or against it, I should say.
[02:02:06.362 --> 02:02:13.490]  And also, it hit another new high with all of these town hall meetings when people came out.
[02:02:13.490 --> 02:02:19.977]  It was more about, again, big government than the healthcare program.
[02:02:19.977 --> 02:02:25.203]  And then we saw the rally against big government on September 12th.
[02:02:26.744 --> 02:02:34.648]  In Washington, when nearly a million people, according to whose report you believe, and we don't know what to believe, but there are a lot of people.
[02:02:34.648 --> 02:02:41.791]  And so, really, the Second American Revolution has begun, and you're a prominent voice in it.
[02:02:41.791 --> 02:02:44.472]  And I'm thrilled to also be a part of it.
[02:02:45.212 --> 02:02:55.779]  Because the direction we're going in now is leading the country down a path and their people are calling it socialism.
[02:02:55.779 --> 02:02:59.301]  And we're making it clear that this isn't socialism.
[02:02:59.301 --> 02:03:06.306]  The merger of state and corporate powers is clearly, as Mussolini said, fascism.
[02:03:06.306 --> 02:03:08.287]  And fascism has come to America.
[02:03:08.962 --> 02:03:28.728]  This whole myth of the two big two fails who made this story up, and the banks gaining more and more control, buying out all the weaker financial institutions, bringing their strength together as oligopolies to take over this nation.
[02:03:28.728 --> 02:03:31.509]  And we're just seeing more and more of it.
[02:03:31.509 --> 02:03:37.531]  But the whole world also is seeing what's going on, as you're talking about, with the decline of the dollar.
[02:03:38.571 --> 02:03:47.373]  And people should be very aware of this, because we're very concerned that they're going to call a bank holiday as things get worse.
[02:03:47.373 --> 02:03:48.953]  You see the dollar now?
[02:03:48.953 --> 02:03:51.154]  Is it $1.50 against the euro?
[02:03:51.154 --> 02:03:58.195]  You know, they're talking about, Alex, how the Dow at $10,000, how people are, oh, how wonderful it is, Dow $10,000.
[02:03:58.195 --> 02:04:01.316]  Well, when the Dow first hit $10,000 ten years ago,
[02:04:03.016 --> 02:04:08.560]  You know, the unemployment rate, the official unemployment rate was about 4.2%.
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:12.843]  Now the official unemployment rate is what?
[02:04:12.843 --> 02:04:13.203]  9.8%.
[02:04:13.203 --> 02:04:21.569]  And you saw the numbers came out today again, about 500, what, 30,000 people on unemployment.
[02:04:21.569 --> 02:04:30.214]  And then the barrel of oil back then, 10 years ago, was selling for under $16 a barrel.
[02:04:30.214 --> 02:04:31.515]  What's it selling for now? $80.
[02:04:33.576 --> 02:04:35.357]  They're devaluing the dollar.
[02:04:35.357 --> 02:04:39.019]  They're going to make us all poorer.
[02:04:39.019 --> 02:04:39.759]  Absolutely.
[02:04:39.759 --> 02:04:46.403]  I want to talk about where you see the revolution going, because I remember several years ago, you predicted we were going to have the crash.
[02:04:46.403 --> 02:04:49.144]  They were going to raise taxes in the midst of it.
[02:04:49.144 --> 02:04:51.185]  People would start demonstrating.
[02:04:51.185 --> 02:04:54.447]  The government will ignore that, and then it will then build to a head.
[02:04:54.447 --> 02:04:58.429]  We're going to talk about a lot of issues with Gerald Solente when we come right back.
[02:04:58.429 --> 02:04:58.869]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.615 --> 02:05:03.977]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:03.977 --> 02:05:07.599]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.599 --> 02:05:12.181]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.181 --> 02:05:17.784]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:18.064 --> 02:05:22.847]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.847 --> 02:05:26.470]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:31.273]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.273 --> 02:05:37.837]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.837 --> 02:05:39.799]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.279 --> 02:05:43.482]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[02:06:01.377 --> 02:06:04.398]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.398 --> 02:06:09.721]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.721 --> 02:06:11.761]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.761 --> 02:06:16.764]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.764 --> 02:06:17.944]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.944 --> 02:06:19.085]  When do you want it?
[02:06:19.085 --> 02:06:20.965]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.965 --> 02:06:22.046]  When will you need it?
[02:06:22.046 --> 02:06:24.247]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.247 --> 02:06:25.587]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.587 --> 02:06:26.888]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:27.088 --> 02:06:32.374]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.374 --> 02:06:35.959]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.959 --> 02:06:39.783]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.783 --> 02:06:41.004]  How much will you need?
[02:06:41.004 --> 02:06:41.905]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.905 --> 02:06:43.007]  How much do you want?
[02:06:43.007 --> 02:06:43.948]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.948 --> 02:06:44.749]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.029 --> 02:06:48.074]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:06:49.857 --> 02:06:50.778]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.478 --> 02:07:05.785]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:05.785 --> 02:07:10.311]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:10.311 --> 02:07:12.594]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.594 --> 02:07:14.216]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:14.216 --> 02:07:15.258]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.478 --> 02:07:23.901]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:08:02.183 --> 02:08:07.727]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.444 --> 02:08:20.526]  Gerald Solente, top trends forecaster in the country, has made hundreds of spot-on predictions.
[02:08:20.526 --> 02:08:32.691]  More than two years ago, charted exactly what was going to happen with the economy, the bank implosions, the consolidation of power, the looting, the unfolding police state, and the building revolution.
[02:08:33.311 --> 02:08:35.452]  The establishment knows they've got a revolution on their hands.
[02:08:35.452 --> 02:08:45.534]  That's why they're saying they're going to deploy 379,000 Homeland Security troops from the Army and Marine Corps and Air Force in the United States in the next two years.
[02:08:45.534 --> 02:08:48.415]  They're suddenly popping up everywhere, conditioning the public.
[02:08:48.415 --> 02:08:52.096]  They're openly announcing Bank of the World, global carbon taxes.
[02:08:52.096 --> 02:08:55.797]  States and cities and counties and the feds are passing all these new taxes.
[02:08:55.797 --> 02:08:59.117]  Obama has been breaking every promise.
[02:08:59.117 --> 02:09:00.438]  All of this is coming to a head
[02:09:01.258 --> 02:09:03.840]  You predicted the Tea Parties.
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:09.965]  You called them taxpayer brushfire rebellions were some of the terms you used.
[02:09:09.965 --> 02:09:19.873]  You said two years ago when I was reading when we first started getting you on that those would be ignored and that by 2012 everything would melt down.
[02:09:21.454 --> 02:09:22.454]  Expand now.
[02:09:22.454 --> 02:09:23.715]  We're now two years later.
[02:09:23.715 --> 02:09:32.598]  Your forecast, unfortunately, is about 99% accurate, even better than my 95% accuracy, and I really do chart my accuracy.
[02:09:32.598 --> 02:09:35.218]  Let us into your brain, Gerald Cilente.
[02:09:35.218 --> 02:09:37.019]  What's happening next?
[02:09:37.019 --> 02:09:38.920]  Here's what we're concerned about next.
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:44.541]  We, as you know, we just published the Autumn Trends Journal, and now we're working on the top trends for 2010.
[02:09:44.541 --> 02:09:49.843]  What we're most concerned about, Alex, is what we're calling
[02:09:51.269 --> 02:09:54.972]  Terror 2010.
[02:09:54.972 --> 02:10:04.618]  We're forecasting that there is a very high probability of a major terror strike against the United States.
[02:10:04.618 --> 02:10:11.123]  And among the reasons why it's going to happen is what's going on right now in Pakistan.
[02:10:12.592 --> 02:10:27.241]  And most people, of course, aren't aware of the United States policy of increasing that war to a much greater extent now than it's ever been on the Afghan-Pakistan border.
[02:10:27.241 --> 02:10:29.042]  Gerald, let me interrupt.
[02:10:29.042 --> 02:10:33.085]  You also predicted 9-11, so people better pay attention to what you're saying.
[02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:49.715]  Actually, they could Google my name, Salenti, USA Today, December 14, 2000, and the headline read, 2001 won't be our year, Trent Sears says.
[02:10:49.715 --> 02:10:52.636]  We said that Americans wouldn't be safe at home or abroad in 2001.
[02:10:54.565 --> 02:11:05.515]  And right now, what's going on now is that Pakistan has launched a major, major offensive in South Waziristan.
[02:11:05.515 --> 02:11:09.319]  A couple of months ago, they were in the Swat Valley.
[02:11:09.319 --> 02:11:19.649]  And every time that the Pakistani army, and Pakistan has to be one of the most corrupt nations on Earth, and they're being funded, of course, by the United States,
[02:11:20.439 --> 02:11:25.623]  The president, Zardari, he was called Mr. Ten Percent.
[02:11:25.623 --> 02:11:29.785]  He was the husband of Budo, who was assassinated.
[02:11:29.785 --> 02:11:36.870]  They called him Mr. Ten Percent because he took ten percent of all the action that went on in the government.
[02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:38.791]  He's now the president.
[02:11:38.791 --> 02:11:49.298]  And what's going on is that the anti-Americanism sweeping through Pakistan, I mentioned the Swat Valley, it was the biggest amount of people
[02:11:51.359 --> 02:12:03.305]  Displaced since Rwanda just a month ago with 3 million refugees and now the same thing is happening once again in South Waziristan.
[02:12:03.305 --> 02:12:13.329]  So the anti-Americanism sweeping through the Middle East is at an all-time high and now it's also of course going on in Iran.
[02:12:13.329 --> 02:12:15.670]  Again, current events form future trends.
[02:12:16.170 --> 02:12:30.847]  We just saw last Sunday that several Iranian National Guard, the Republican Guard, were killed in a suicide attempt that Iran is blaming on the United States and Israel.
[02:12:30.847 --> 02:12:34.311]  So we're concerned that there's going to be a terror strike
[02:12:34.771 --> 02:12:43.017]  Against the United States, false flag or real, we're saying something is going to happen very major in this field in 2010.
[02:12:43.017 --> 02:12:46.820]  So now we take it again as trend forecasters.
[02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:48.401]  What does that mean?
[02:12:48.401 --> 02:12:50.683]  Good excuses to close the bank.
[02:12:50.683 --> 02:12:56.227]  We're getting emails from all over the world, Alex, and from top people.
[02:12:56.727 --> 02:12:57.948]  And Gerald, I want to stop you again.
[02:13:22.848 --> 02:13:24.610]  And that's key what you just mentioned.
[02:13:24.610 --> 02:13:37.164]  On the record, the Bank of England, the Private Federal Reserve, they're both partners as you know, but for listeners that may not, they are the ones openly killing the dollar, bad-mouthing it, making all the decisions to kill it.
[02:13:37.765 --> 02:13:56.838]  It's their G20 meeting and saying we need to phase it out, devalue it, go to SDRs as an above country currency, bank to bank, and then they'll control all the different currencies of the world so they can engage in more insider trading, more consolidation of wealth criminally with their insider knowledge and control, their regulatory control.
[02:13:56.838 --> 02:14:05.945]  The Madoff-type, Kinley-type criminals running the global regulatory system that has now already been built but now being unveiled,
[02:14:06.445 --> 02:14:07.947]  They are killing it.
[02:14:07.947 --> 02:14:10.950]  Meanwhile, our media tells us the Arabs are killing it.
[02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:15.736]  When the Russians, the Chinese, the Arabs are saying, we all hold trillions of your dollars.
[02:14:15.736 --> 02:14:17.157]  Why are you ripping us off?
[02:14:17.157 --> 02:14:20.521]  Why are you devaluing this when you asked us to buy it?
[02:14:20.521 --> 02:14:22.624]  And the United States admits
[02:14:23.344 --> 02:14:31.467]  The last White House and the new one admits they're running Jandela that's blowing up military bases and police stations to get the Iranians to attack back.
[02:14:31.467 --> 02:14:45.551]  They admit they're escalating the war in Pakistan and Afghanistan to elicit real resistance, which they're then going to call terrorism, used to launch a wider war and domestically crack down on the population.
[02:14:45.551 --> 02:14:47.812]  So for people to see an accurate map and tell me if you agree,
[02:14:48.732 --> 02:14:50.133]  Don't see the world as nations.
[02:14:50.133 --> 02:15:00.062]  We now have these global corporations that control the UN and the central banks, and they are playing nations and groups off against each other to consolidate the power.
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:01.721]  Well said.
[02:15:01.721 --> 02:15:03.402]  I agree with everything that you said.
[02:15:03.402 --> 02:15:07.365]  And that's precisely what's going on.
[02:15:07.365 --> 02:15:19.996]  And what the American people have to understand is that as the dollar devalues, and of course this trend has been going on for a long time, as I mentioned when we did talk about Dow 10,000, when we went back to 1999, since that time,
[02:15:23.238 --> 02:15:27.479]  Well, you could buy a euro, for example, for 95 cents.
[02:15:27.479 --> 02:15:30.180]  Now it's going to cost you $1.50.
[02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:35.042]  And back then, you could buy an ounce of gold for $280.
[02:15:35.042 --> 02:15:40.924]  So you're saying the stock market's really down, we're just buying it with devalued dollars, so it looks like it's more?
[02:15:41.084 --> 02:15:41.764]  Exactly!
[02:15:41.764 --> 02:15:45.825]  An ounce of gold now, of course, costs $1,060.
[02:15:45.825 --> 02:15:53.567]  So what the people are doing is they're lowering the standard of living for everyone.
[02:15:53.567 --> 02:16:02.650]  The gap between the 1% owning more of assets has never been higher in the 20th century than it is now.
[02:16:04.350 --> 02:16:11.542]  So they're pushing everybody down into poverty as the money is going up to the top to the very few.
[02:16:14.193 --> 02:16:22.182]  And about the jobless recovery that we talk about, 72% of our GDP is consumer-based.
[02:16:22.182 --> 02:16:24.564]  Again, we saw the numbers coming out today.
[02:16:24.564 --> 02:16:31.091]  The unemployment rate continues to rise, the amount of new people looking for unemployment.
[02:16:31.091 --> 02:16:34.415]  A jobless recovery is like being almost pregnant.
[02:16:34.955 --> 02:16:35.596]  You can't.
[02:16:35.596 --> 02:16:36.997]  It doesn't happen.
[02:16:36.997 --> 02:16:39.259]  There's no such thing.
[02:16:39.259 --> 02:16:47.226]  And when you go back to the last depression, you read the history of it, they were doing the same kind of jive talk back then.
[02:16:47.226 --> 02:16:56.334]  They would rush the market up, they'd sucker the people into it, the market would collapse, and they would talk about the recovery being just around the corner.
[02:16:56.514 --> 02:17:00.160]  Yo-Yo went on for three years until they admitted we were really in a big depression.
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:04.326]  How long will the yo-yoing go in your opinion?
[02:17:12.361 --> 02:17:19.606]  The real numbers are going to come out in December, when this Christmas retail sales are a bust.
[02:17:19.606 --> 02:17:30.775]  So when by the second quarter around March, when reality hits, February-March, as it did this year, when the markets collapsed, they can't hide it anymore.
[02:17:31.215 --> 02:17:37.978]  But what happens is, what we're concerned about, again, it's either false flag or real.
[02:17:37.978 --> 02:17:44.141]  They're going to divert the people's attention, and we're saying, Terror 2010.
[02:17:44.141 --> 02:17:48.844]  So they keep playing the yo-yo by throwing new games into the mix.
[02:17:50.211 --> 02:17:53.073]  So they'll have the people's attention diverted.
[02:17:53.073 --> 02:17:53.853]  Look what happened.
[02:17:53.853 --> 02:17:59.917]  People forget, Alex, that before 9-11, how unpopular George Bush was.
[02:17:59.917 --> 02:18:08.762]  And then they got this guy that couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag, who's gonna tell everybody he's gonna hunt down Osama bin Laden dead or alive.
[02:18:08.762 --> 02:18:11.703]  The whole nation followed him after 9-11.
[02:18:11.703 --> 02:18:14.205]  The same kind of scenario could happen now.
[02:18:16.084 --> 02:18:21.010]  Well, that's what the Rand Corporation is saying, that they need a big war to get their New World Order.
[02:18:21.010 --> 02:18:24.295]  Gerald, I want to shift back to an earlier subject.
[02:18:24.295 --> 02:18:27.319]  How do you see the rebellion against this manifesting?
[02:18:27.319 --> 02:18:33.927]  You called it taxpayer rebellions, demonstrations, rallies, two years ago, getting bigger and bigger.
[02:18:34.989 --> 02:18:39.273]  You predicted the term jobless recovery a year and a half ago.
[02:18:39.273 --> 02:18:45.719]  I mean, I want to ask you, Gerald, how did you specifically even pick the bogus term?
[02:18:45.719 --> 02:18:47.680]  How did you know they were going to come up with that?
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:50.343]  They play with that term from time to time.
[02:18:50.343 --> 02:18:54.467]  Every time they get into trouble over the past, they play out these terms.
[02:18:55.067 --> 02:18:58.728]  And what they do is they do it to divert people's attention.
[02:18:58.728 --> 02:19:01.429]  Alex, I want to make this 100% clear.
[02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:04.270]  The jobs that are gone are gone forever.
[02:19:04.270 --> 02:19:05.870]  They're not coming back.
[02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:10.231]  They've shipped our production overseas.
[02:19:10.231 --> 02:19:11.312]  You look around.
[02:19:11.312 --> 02:19:12.692]  Go anywhere you want to go.
[02:19:12.692 --> 02:19:14.112]  Where are their jobs?
[02:19:14.112 --> 02:19:18.334]  Hey, you want a job at a checkout counter at 7-Eleven?
[02:19:18.334 --> 02:19:21.334]  You want a wonderful position as a home health care?
[02:19:21.334 --> 02:19:23.235]  How about working at a nursing home?
[02:19:23.815 --> 02:19:26.556]  There's going to be plenty of jobs for you.
[02:19:26.556 --> 02:19:28.937]  They're dumbing down the society.
[02:19:28.937 --> 02:19:32.839]  The jobs that are left are among the worst.
[02:19:32.839 --> 02:19:36.801]  And when you look, when there's only job creation, where is it?
[02:19:36.801 --> 02:19:38.922]  Well, it's in government jobs.
[02:19:38.922 --> 02:19:41.063]  It's in home health care.
[02:19:41.063 --> 02:19:44.084]  It's in the hospitality sector.
[02:19:44.084 --> 02:19:46.725]  That's not even going to happen anymore.
[02:19:46.725 --> 02:19:49.046]  So the jobs that are gone are gone for good.
[02:19:49.046 --> 02:19:51.848]  Stay there, because I want to ask you next.
[02:19:52.751 --> 02:19:57.362]  More police, more tickets, more fines, more fees, more taxes?
[02:19:57.362 --> 02:20:00.549]  How do they squeeze more blood out of the population?
[02:20:01.459 --> 02:20:11.566]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecolablue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[02:20:11.566 --> 02:20:13.187]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:20:13.187 --> 02:20:14.268]  It's very real.
[02:20:14.268 --> 02:20:14.608]  I know.
[02:20:14.608 --> 02:20:18.832]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:20:18.832 --> 02:20:22.054]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[02:20:22.054 --> 02:20:30.260]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecolablue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[02:20:30.700 --> 02:20:37.402]  Their best-seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[02:20:37.402 --> 02:20:46.106]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[02:20:46.106 --> 02:20:51.007]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-8000.
[02:21:02.349 --> 02:21:12.253]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, clogged arteries?
[02:21:12.253 --> 02:21:14.294]  If so, you are not alone.
[02:21:14.294 --> 02:21:17.516]  Millions of people are suffering from one or more of these problems.
[02:21:17.856 --> 02:21:18.256]  We're good to go.
[02:21:41.408 --> 02:21:41.809]  We're good to go.
[02:22:01.038 --> 02:22:03.221]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:22:03.221 --> 02:22:04.083]  Spy on me?
[02:22:04.083 --> 02:22:04.403]  Yeah.
[02:22:04.403 --> 02:22:09.451]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:22:09.451 --> 02:22:11.093]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:22:11.093 --> 02:22:11.835]  Startpage?
[02:22:11.835 --> 02:22:12.255]  Yeah.
[02:22:12.255 --> 02:22:13.357]  Startpage.com.
[02:22:13.357 --> 02:22:16.081]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:22:16.301 --> 02:22:20.162]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.

[02:22:25.903 --> 02:22:27.504]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:22:27.504 --> 02:22:27.804]  Right!

[02:23:01.465 --> 02:23:03.266]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[02:23:31.425 --> 02:23:32.706]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:23:32.706 --> 02:23:34.087]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:23:34.087 --> 02:23:35.908]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[02:23:35.908 --> 02:23:36.828]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:24:02.094 --> 02:24:04.856]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:24:04.856 --> 02:24:13.043]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:13.043 --> 02:24:16.426]  Gerald Cilente.
[02:24:16.426 --> 02:24:18.888]  The Republic is fading into history.
[02:24:18.888 --> 02:24:20.990]  We've been fully conquered by offshore banks.
[02:24:22.139 --> 02:24:26.962]  They, in their own documents, admit they create economic implosions so they can consolidate wealth.
[02:24:26.962 --> 02:24:31.625]  They think their police state can protect them from the people so they can carry out this crime.
[02:24:31.625 --> 02:24:37.749]  But you have said repeatedly and broken down the fact that history shows it's not going to go that way.
[02:24:37.749 --> 02:24:44.533]  Break down, in summary, police sir, how you see this then unfolding in a chain of events.
[02:24:44.533 --> 02:24:50.417]  What are the taxpayer revolts going to turn into as the system squeezes and squeezes and squeezes?
[02:24:51.084 --> 02:24:55.218]  Well, we already have state and local governments over $200 billion in the red.
[02:24:57.774 --> 02:25:05.500]  And they're going to keep asking people for more and more taxes right here in Kingston, New York, where it just came out.
[02:25:05.500 --> 02:25:06.981]  I don't know how true it is or not.
[02:25:06.981 --> 02:25:13.246]  Someone just called me today that they're going to look for a 10% increase in taxes.
[02:25:13.246 --> 02:25:18.230]  So we're organizing our own local tax revolts right here.
[02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:20.792]  And this is going to go on all over the country.
[02:25:20.792 --> 02:25:27.077]  As you know, my saying as a Bronx boy, when people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:25:27.897 --> 02:25:33.622]  And people are now looking at government as the enemy, more so than ever before.
[02:25:33.622 --> 02:25:42.449]  So the tax protests we see are going to be the catalyst that drives the nation into the second revolution.
[02:25:42.449 --> 02:25:43.850]  We're in it already.
[02:25:43.850 --> 02:25:46.773]  The media is denying it, and as you know,
[02:25:47.333 --> 02:25:55.637]  They're attributing these protests, etc., to right-wing fringe elements and conservative nuts.
[02:25:55.637 --> 02:25:58.019]  That's the way, you know, they like to paint it.
[02:25:58.019 --> 02:25:59.800]  It has nothing to do with that.
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:03.021]  These are people that are fed up and they have nothing to lose.
[02:26:03.021 --> 02:26:07.123]  So we're going to see it manifest itself again with the tax revolts.
[02:26:07.123 --> 02:26:08.204]  Then the winter comes.
[02:26:09.469 --> 02:26:18.173]  And around much of the country, people are going to be unable to afford to buy home heating fuel or gas.
[02:26:18.173 --> 02:26:18.893]  They're not going to be.
[02:26:18.893 --> 02:26:22.295]  You're going to start seeing particularly among the elderly.
[02:26:22.295 --> 02:26:26.316]  Now we have to understand why is oil prices going up so high?
[02:26:30.158 --> 02:26:38.344]  Well, it has less to do with demand and more to do, going back again, to the devaluation of the dollar.
[02:26:38.344 --> 02:26:41.607]  Oil, as everyone knows, is petrodollars.
[02:26:41.607 --> 02:26:45.970]  And with the dollar losing value, oil prices keep going up.
[02:26:45.970 --> 02:26:47.612]  So that's what we're going to see.
[02:26:47.612 --> 02:26:50.434]  Now, I want to throw one other thing on here as well.
[02:26:51.275 --> 02:27:05.099]  We saw Obama come out and tell the elderly that because of the cost of living index has gone down and remained flat, that they're going to give them $250 each to help them along.
[02:27:05.099 --> 02:27:10.440]  Well, $250, as we all know in the real world, is chump change, not worth anything.
[02:27:11.167 --> 02:27:14.129]  It's going to cost the government about $13 billion.
[02:27:14.129 --> 02:27:17.091]  Aren't they generous with the elderly?
[02:27:17.091 --> 02:27:29.018]  $13 billion is what we, the people, gave to the Goldman Sachs gang to cover their losses that they took on bad bets with AIG.
[02:27:29.018 --> 02:27:31.980]  What an insult to the American people.
[02:27:31.980 --> 02:27:37.283]  And this is where the inflammation is going to start rising.
[02:27:37.663 --> 02:27:41.025]  It's going to be off with their heads before they know it.
[02:27:41.025 --> 02:27:50.231]  They're so out of touch with what's going on in the street that they think they could chum the people with, let them eat cake $250 payoff.
[02:27:50.231 --> 02:27:52.192]  So that's how we see this thing playing out.
[02:27:56.914 --> 02:28:02.301]  We're going to see more and more people turning against the government.
[02:28:02.301 --> 02:28:13.094]  And what we're hoping, not hoping, what we're suggesting is that this revolution cannot be hijacked by violence.
[02:28:13.094 --> 02:28:14.776]  Because if it does, we lose.
[02:28:15.937 --> 02:28:22.401]  And all you have to see is what happened at the G20 meetings, when they've called martial law in Pittsburgh.
[02:28:22.401 --> 02:28:30.605]  I mean, can you imagine closing down an entire city, 1.5 million people, for 20 world leaders?
[02:28:30.605 --> 02:28:35.008]  And saying you can't come out on the street, and then attacking peaceful people.
[02:28:35.008 --> 02:28:36.869]  They're looking for trouble.
[02:28:36.869 --> 02:28:38.650]  They're looking to set the precedent.
[02:28:38.650 --> 02:28:43.212]  Police dogs biting old women, young girls getting billy clubbed off bikes.
[02:28:43.212 --> 02:28:44.373]  They want violence.
[02:28:44.773 --> 02:28:46.156]  Exactly.
[02:28:46.156 --> 02:28:53.492]  And you know, as a close combat martial artist, a leader walks without fear.
[02:28:54.443 --> 02:29:03.047]  What kind of leaders do these people call themselves when they can't even step out into a crowd and have to close down the city?
[02:29:03.047 --> 02:29:05.088]  What a disgrace!
[02:29:05.088 --> 02:29:17.274]  You know, if anybody believes in anything, the Founding Fathers are turning in their graves at these little cowards that they call leaders, and people are going to follow these leaders?
[02:29:18.089 --> 02:29:19.650]  I talked to Jesse Ventura last week.
[02:29:19.650 --> 02:29:30.455]  It's a video we've got up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and he made the point that last year at the Republican National Convention, it was an armed camp, locked down much of the city.
[02:29:30.455 --> 02:29:33.476]  They were acting like the public were all terrorists.
[02:29:33.476 --> 02:29:34.957]  Then at Ron Paul's event,
[02:29:35.797 --> 02:29:39.501]  Couple cops, super light security, everybody had a great time.
[02:29:39.501 --> 02:29:51.693]  I mean, Saddam Hussein would walk around in a group of 10,000 people with AK-47s, but in America, the foreign bankers come into town, they lock the whole city down, because they're the criminals.
[02:29:51.693 --> 02:29:55.637]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.637 --> 02:29:58.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.862 --> 02:30:10.987]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecolablu, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[02:30:10.987 --> 02:30:12.587]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:30:12.587 --> 02:30:13.668]  It's very real.
[02:30:13.668 --> 02:30:14.008]  I know.
[02:30:14.008 --> 02:30:18.250]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:30:18.250 --> 02:30:21.451]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.

[02:30:24.793 --> 02:30:25.413]  We're good to go.
[02:30:42.881 --> 02:30:45.502]  Carbon filters and ultraviolet lights.
[02:30:45.502 --> 02:30:50.203]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.

[02:30:50.444 --> 02:30:52.584]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at ecoloblue.com today.
[02:31:00.987 --> 02:31:05.549]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.549 --> 02:31:06.450]  Number one.
[02:31:06.450 --> 02:31:09.871]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.871 --> 02:31:10.731]  Number two.
[02:31:10.731 --> 02:31:15.634]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.634 --> 02:31:16.374]  It's true.
[02:31:16.374 --> 02:31:21.236]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.236 --> 02:31:22.077]  Number three.
[02:31:22.077 --> 02:31:25.658]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.658 --> 02:31:29.360]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.560 --> 02:31:30.361]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.361 --> 02:31:33.123]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:33.123 --> 02:31:36.806]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.806 --> 02:31:37.587]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.587 --> 02:31:41.731]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.731 --> 02:31:46.495]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.795 --> 02:31:50.958]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.958 --> 02:31:52.739]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.739 --> 02:31:55.001]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:31:55.001 --> 02:31:57.343]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:00.939 --> 02:32:08.687]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:32:08.687 --> 02:32:14.773]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.

[02:32:17.736 --> 02:32:23.642]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:32:24.002 --> 02:32:25.583]  This book will work for anyone.
[02:32:25.583 --> 02:32:28.064]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:32:28.064 --> 02:32:33.687]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:32:33.687 --> 02:32:35.768]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:32:35.768 --> 02:32:37.529]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:32:37.529 --> 02:32:40.050]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:32:40.050 --> 02:32:44.793]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:32:44.793 --> 02:32:48.494]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[02:32:48.494 --> 02:32:50.636]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:32:51.596 --> 02:32:52.676]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:52.676 --> 02:32:53.697]  One last time.
[02:32:53.697 --> 02:32:54.577]  It's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:33:22.476 --> 02:33:26.858]  We're going back to Gerald Cilente in just one moment.
[02:33:26.858 --> 02:33:32.620]  I want to commend all the listeners for hitting the ground running with Follow the Republic at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:32.620 --> 02:33:35.981]  You support the explosion in the alternative media.
[02:33:35.981 --> 02:33:39.522]  There's no doubt that we're at the tip of the spear with Gerald Cilente and many others.
[02:33:40.445 --> 02:33:52.730]  in shattering a left-right paradigm because the establishment loves to divide and conquer us and play parties off against each other when the Republicans and Democrats are equally part of the same Wall Street gang robbing us.
[02:33:52.730 --> 02:33:55.432]  And we'll talk to Gerald Cilente about that.
[02:33:55.432 --> 02:34:07.197]  This film that has Jesse Ventura, Gerald Cilente, Webster Tarpley, Alan Watt, John Perkins, Professor Black, Dr. Bob Bowman, myself,
[02:34:09.431 --> 02:34:20.520]  Professor Boyle, the list goes on and on and on, and we went to the tent cities.
[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:23.483]  In Northern California, we traveled so much to put this together.
[02:34:23.483 --> 02:34:33.231]  It breaks down who the bankers are, what their battle plan is from their own documents and statements, what they're planning to do in the future, how they've committed crimes, and how we either bring them to justice
[02:34:34.076 --> 02:34:35.639]  Because they're criminals.
[02:34:35.639 --> 02:34:45.797]  Or we allow them to take their Ponzi scheme to the next level, worldwide tyranny, and then to the next scam, and the next, the carbon tax, the control, the police state, the citizen spies.
[02:34:46.835 --> 02:34:47.715]  It is.
[02:34:47.715 --> 02:34:50.416]  Fall of the Republic.
[02:34:50.416 --> 02:34:51.936]  I suggest you get it on DVD.
[02:34:51.936 --> 02:35:00.779]  The super high quality, highest quality, 2 hours and 24 minutes, 30 plus minutes of extras, right at 30 minutes of extras.
[02:35:00.779 --> 02:35:08.621]  If you're going to spend the time watching it, making copies, giving it out to people, the best way is to order the DVDs at InfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:35:12.723 --> 02:35:15.206]  You can also write to me.

[02:35:19.551 --> 02:35:19.871]  P.O.
[02:35:19.871 --> 02:35:20.873]  Box 19549 Austin, TX 78760.
[02:35:20.873 --> 02:35:21.413]  It is up to you.
[02:35:32.403 --> 02:35:44.154]  How viral this film goes, because there's no other single document that puts it all in perspective and explains what's happening 100% and shows you where we're going and how we can stop it.
[02:35:44.154 --> 02:35:45.796]  It is so important.
[02:35:45.796 --> 02:35:54.344]  If the Republic isn't going to completely fall, it's going to get bad, but if the people know who to blame and know the solutions, then we can pull out of it as Ron Paul has said.
[02:35:54.944 --> 02:36:01.287]  If we don't, ladies and gentlemen, it is hellish what these globalists do to third world and other first world countries they've taken over.
[02:36:01.287 --> 02:36:02.408]  So follow the Republic.
[02:36:02.408 --> 02:36:07.711]  You can also, $5.95 a month, see the live TV show, all my other films, this film in high quality.
[02:36:07.711 --> 02:36:12.573]  There's a DivX version you can download and put on CDs and give to people that looks very, very crisp.
[02:36:12.573 --> 02:36:13.894]  Not as good as DVD, but close.
[02:36:14.654 --> 02:36:16.275]  Again, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:36:16.275 --> 02:36:18.057]  I want to thank all those members as well.
[02:36:18.057 --> 02:36:19.638]  They make everything possible.
[02:36:19.638 --> 02:36:24.541]  I'm also going to tell you how to subscribe to Gerald Salente's Trends Forecaster.
[02:36:24.541 --> 02:36:25.782]  He's not a sponsor.
[02:36:25.782 --> 02:36:26.442]  I believe in it.
[02:36:26.442 --> 02:36:27.984]  I think you should subscribe to it.
[02:36:27.984 --> 02:36:30.986]  We'll tell you about that in just a moment, so get a pen and paper ready.
[02:36:30.986 --> 02:36:33.267]  A couple other sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[02:36:33.267 --> 02:36:37.670]  I haven't plugged a sponsor for two and a half hours, so now we're doing it all kind of here at once.
[02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:41.913]  These sponsors are so important, and they're also all groups I believe in.
[02:36:42.967 --> 02:36:45.832]  One of them is FrontSight.com.
[02:36:45.832 --> 02:36:50.959]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza, the founder of the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute?
[02:36:50.959 --> 02:36:55.086]  He's offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[02:36:55.086 --> 02:36:56.548]  It's not enough to just own the guns.
[02:36:56.548 --> 02:36:57.409]  You've got to know how to use them.
[02:36:57.990 --> 02:37:04.137]  This offer is only available for a limited time because Dr. Piazza is literally paying his own money out of pocket to be able to offer you this deal.
[02:37:04.137 --> 02:37:05.900]  It won't last forever, so listen up.
[02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:13.108]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:37:13.889 --> 02:37:18.850]  Act fast, and they'll give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:37:18.850 --> 02:37:20.330]  Frontsight.com.
[02:37:20.330 --> 02:37:22.071]  No drill instructor attitude.
[02:37:22.071 --> 02:37:23.171]  It's family-oriented.
[02:37:23.171 --> 02:37:25.671]  It's the biggest private firearm training center in the country.
[02:37:25.671 --> 02:37:27.972]  Two-day, four-day, five-day training courses.
[02:37:27.972 --> 02:37:30.473]  The fall and winter are the best time to take it out in Nevada.
[02:37:30.473 --> 02:37:32.933]  They have a lot of free online stuff if you can't go there.
[02:37:32.933 --> 02:37:34.353]  Frontsight.com.
[02:37:34.353 --> 02:37:36.314]  That's frontsight, like the front of your rifle.
[02:37:36.314 --> 02:37:38.554]  Frontsight.com.
[02:37:38.554 --> 02:37:40.255]  Okay, going back to Gerald Cilente.
[02:37:40.255 --> 02:37:41.935]  Gerald, plug your trends
[02:37:42.635 --> 02:37:44.276]  Newsletter because it's thick.
[02:37:44.276 --> 02:37:45.136]  It's a magazine.
[02:37:45.136 --> 02:37:46.297]  It's documented.
[02:37:46.297 --> 02:37:47.738]  People need it.
[02:37:47.738 --> 02:37:50.919]  Well, our website is TrendsResearch.com.
[02:37:50.919 --> 02:37:53.400]  That's TrendsResearch.com.
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:38:00.604]  And I also want to make it clear that we know that people are in tough economic straits, many people.
[02:38:00.604 --> 02:38:04.506]  So we offer discounts for people that
[02:38:05.626 --> 02:38:10.368]  That are in tough financial shape, disabilities, whatever.
[02:38:10.368 --> 02:38:21.092]  And we want the information out there for everyone, just as we promote and encourage everyone to get your new DVD, The Fall of the Republic.
[02:38:21.092 --> 02:38:32.337]  I have to tell you, Alex, that I've distributed the Obama deception to a number of friends who I consider really enlightened and on the cutting edge.
[02:38:33.077 --> 02:38:39.299]  And they learned so much that they didn't know when they saw the Obama deception.
[02:38:39.299 --> 02:38:54.503]  And that the only way that we're going to have the change that we need in a positive way is for people to know what's going on, to get the fall of the republic, and to learn more, and to give it to people that are on the fence.
[02:38:55.103 --> 02:39:06.968]  And with the Trends Journal, what we do, as you well know, is that we not only forecast the trends, we provide trend posts into the future so you can take proactive measures.
[02:39:06.968 --> 02:39:11.750]  And what we're saying now is that this is not a recovery, it's a cover-up.
[02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:12.911]  It's as clear as that.
[02:39:12.911 --> 02:39:19.974]  You know, why are these banks, for example, coming in with all these high profits?
[02:39:19.974 --> 02:39:22.015]  Well, it's very, very simple.
[02:39:22.715 --> 02:39:30.143]  It has more to do with gifts from the taxpayers than increased economic activity or skills.
[02:39:30.143 --> 02:39:42.455]  What they're doing, Alex, is these banks are reaping outside earnings through risk-free, low-interest loans from central banks, which they in turn lend back to governments.
[02:39:43.175 --> 02:39:44.816]  At higher rates.
[02:39:44.816 --> 02:39:46.817]  It's as simple as that.
[02:39:46.817 --> 02:39:48.999]  They're picking our pockets.
[02:39:48.999 --> 02:39:54.262]  Oh, and why are these other corporations showing such wonderful earnings?
[02:39:54.262 --> 02:39:55.803]  Oh, it's simple.
[02:39:55.803 --> 02:40:01.486]  They're cutting production, they're laying off people, and they're selling off assets.
[02:40:02.066 --> 02:40:10.112]  So this is only a temporary recovery, and what we're urging people to do now is to take survival measures.
[02:40:10.112 --> 02:40:17.877]  The kind of products that are offered on your website, the solar generators, the foods,
[02:40:18.918 --> 02:40:21.681]  And really start supporting your community.
[02:40:21.681 --> 02:40:23.202]  People ask me what I do.
[02:40:23.202 --> 02:40:25.665]  I don't buy anything I don't have to corporate.
[02:40:25.665 --> 02:40:28.908]  You won't find me dead in a Dunkin Donuts.
[02:40:28.908 --> 02:40:31.130]  I'll go to the local coffee shop.
[02:40:31.130 --> 02:40:33.213]  I should buy local produce.
[02:40:33.213 --> 02:40:35.155]  I buy local everything I can.
[02:40:36.121 --> 02:40:42.783]  And we don't give investment advice, but I'm still buying gold, and we're forecasting gold 2000.
[02:40:42.783 --> 02:40:53.465]  And also, as your crew well knows from coming up to the Trends Research Institute, I'm a firm believer in a renaissance.
[02:40:53.465 --> 02:40:54.726]  And a renaissance, to me,
[02:40:56.687 --> 02:40:59.088]  How can we make America great again?
[02:40:59.088 --> 02:41:02.209]  And a renaissance to everyone, of course, is a rebirth.
[02:41:02.209 --> 02:41:04.690]  So when was America at its greatest?
[02:41:04.690 --> 02:41:08.832]  When were we the most egalitarian nation on Earth?
[02:41:08.832 --> 02:41:10.072]  Well, it's very simple.
[02:41:10.072 --> 02:41:11.393]  The facts show it.
[02:41:11.393 --> 02:41:14.234]  It's when we had Main Street, not Wall Street.
[02:41:14.747 --> 02:41:16.369]  Not the too-big-to-fails.
[02:41:16.369 --> 02:41:18.230]  When we had mom-and-pops.
[02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:19.972]  Not Walmarts.
[02:41:19.972 --> 02:41:21.894]  People supported the community.
[02:41:21.894 --> 02:41:24.136]  When we had family farms.
[02:41:24.136 --> 02:41:29.681]  Not this garbage, deadly food that they're producing out of these factory farms.
[02:41:29.681 --> 02:41:33.264]  This hormone-laced, genetically modified junk.
[02:41:34.119 --> 02:41:43.104]  When we go back to the measure of Main Street, mom and pop, and family farms, we were the most egalitarian nation.
[02:41:43.104 --> 02:41:50.587]  Now the gap between the rich and the poor is the widest in the United States of any of the industrialized nations.
[02:41:50.587 --> 02:41:53.369]  I mention this because also with the Renaissance,
[02:41:54.029 --> 02:41:56.452]  And you go back to when the Renaissance happened.
[02:41:56.452 --> 02:41:59.575]  It happened after the Black Plague.
[02:41:59.575 --> 02:42:05.321]  People got hip to the fact that they didn't know what they were doing, and they needed a better way.
[02:42:05.321 --> 02:42:09.965]  So they went back to the past, when civilization was at higher levels.
[02:42:09.965 --> 02:42:17.533]  They said in Italy, at the height of the Renaissance, Alla Romana, Alla Antica, the man of the Romans and the ancients.
[02:42:17.993 --> 02:42:22.736]  The renaissance in America is to go back to when this country was great.
[02:42:22.736 --> 02:42:26.958]  And that means supporting your community, supporting your neighbor.
[02:42:26.958 --> 02:42:42.287]  This is a time for people to come together within their community, by local, and so this Christmas, I'm urging everyone, don't buy one thing made in China.
[02:42:42.287 --> 02:42:43.968]  Buy a handcrafted.
[02:42:44.648 --> 02:42:49.371]  Give your children something rather than a crappy plastic toy.
[02:42:49.371 --> 02:42:54.935]  Give them something that's going to experience and increase their artistic endeavor.
[02:43:14.788 --> 02:43:26.193]  But looking ahead, you mentioned Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, record, not just big profits, record profits off the bailout money.
[02:43:26.193 --> 02:43:33.696]  Obama's reform of credit cards was to let them go from 15% to 30% above loan sharking rates.
[02:43:33.696 --> 02:43:36.597]  And I keep talking about the breaking point, Gerald.
[02:43:36.597 --> 02:43:42.960]  As the system squeezes and squeezes and squeezes, and they have announced in Austin, and Travis County is going to raise
[02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:54.146]  Taxes on property, taxes on septic tanks, taxes on everything, taxes on water, taxes on trash.
[02:43:54.146 --> 02:43:58.528]  Doesn't the government understand that there just isn't more for them to steal?
[02:43:58.528 --> 02:43:59.949]  I mean, don't they understand?
[02:43:59.949 --> 02:44:05.352]  No, they don't understand because of the lifestyles that they live.
[02:44:05.352 --> 02:44:13.216]  Look, Alex, the worst job I ever had in my life was when I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[02:44:14.028 --> 02:44:27.383]  I may have mentioned this on the air, I'd be hanging around the back of the chamber with my pal, and a senator would walk in and my buddy would leave me to go follow the senator like a little puppy dog to go pull out the chair to help him sit down.
[02:44:27.383 --> 02:44:30.587]  These people live like royalty!
[02:44:30.587 --> 02:44:34.592]  Look at they fly around the world in their own planes!
[02:44:40.114 --> 02:44:43.055]  No, I'm interrupting.
[02:44:43.055 --> 02:44:51.019]  Now they're giving the entire House leadership and Senate leadership their own super luxury jets, their own security.
[02:44:51.019 --> 02:44:53.420]  They're just absolutely out of control.
[02:44:53.933 --> 02:44:54.513]  Exactly!
[02:44:54.513 --> 02:45:01.817]  They're totally disconnected, just like they were when in France, when it was off with their heads.
[02:45:01.817 --> 02:45:14.804]  They don't understand what's going on with the average everyday working person, who has a lousy job, crummy pay, lost benefits, and don't even know if they're going to get a job.
[02:45:14.804 --> 02:45:16.005]  Oh, and here's one.
[02:45:16.585 --> 02:45:23.127]  How about getting out of college and being, what, $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 in debt?
[02:45:23.127 --> 02:45:29.949]  Look, we know Ivy League graduates at a law school that can't find jobs.
[02:45:29.949 --> 02:45:32.350]  You think they're going to be angry?
[02:45:32.350 --> 02:45:34.390]  The revolution has begun.
[02:45:34.390 --> 02:45:38.812]  As you pointed out, they're squeezing the little people.
[02:45:38.812 --> 02:45:42.713]  Boy, you go through a red light, but they got it on camera.
[02:45:42.713 --> 02:45:44.113]  They got you.
[02:45:44.113 --> 02:45:46.074]  Everything, even the septic tank.
[02:45:46.514 --> 02:45:48.956]  Taxes on and on and on.
[02:45:48.956 --> 02:45:50.097]  Toilet taxes.
[02:45:50.097 --> 02:45:53.000]  We're going to continue to see it.
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.842]  The revolution is happening.
[02:45:55.842 --> 02:46:01.027]  And so now what we're also saying is that we're forecasting a third party by 2012.
[02:46:03.374 --> 02:46:07.439]  And we're calling it, for lack of another name, progressive libertarian.
[02:46:07.439 --> 02:46:15.128]  Progressive in the things that you talk about with organic foods, with a higher quality of life, without buying junk.
[02:46:15.128 --> 02:46:16.950]  Libertarian in the truest sense.
[02:46:18.825 --> 02:46:21.666]  Look, this is classic empire decline.
[02:46:21.666 --> 02:46:26.847]  Could you imagine being involved in foreign entanglements costing us, what is it costing us?
[02:46:26.847 --> 02:46:30.588]  Eight billion dollars a month just to be in Iraq?
[02:46:30.588 --> 02:46:34.029]  And at a time when the treasury is being depleted?
[02:46:34.029 --> 02:46:37.430]  So that's the new party that we're seeing forming.
[02:46:37.430 --> 02:46:42.511]  And possibly someone like a Jesse Ventura or others could be leading this movement.
[02:46:44.352 --> 02:46:48.255]  Now, Gerald, in the time we have with you, I want to take some calls.
[02:46:48.255 --> 02:46:50.677]  I want to expand on this.
[02:46:50.677 --> 02:46:52.598]  There's dangers, though.
[02:46:52.598 --> 02:46:58.903]  The establishment, generally when the banks loot a country, they fund a communist or a fascist movement.
[02:46:58.903 --> 02:47:03.026]  A fascist movement to consolidate control or a communist movement.
[02:47:03.026 --> 02:47:11.533]  And we're in a fascist paradigm right now, but I see through Obama or a future president that the establishment is attempting to sell socialism
[02:47:12.313 --> 02:47:16.896]  Or communism, but really that's just a way to consolidate the people's wealth and give it to offshore banks.
[02:47:16.896 --> 02:47:23.980]  But selling to the little guy that, oh yes, like Michael Moore's new film, capitalism did this.
[02:47:23.980 --> 02:47:26.741]  And so the answer is, rob the rich.
[02:47:26.741 --> 02:47:29.163]  Put caps on what people can be paid.
[02:47:29.163 --> 02:47:32.504]  But that won't be put on the big banks and the offshore corporations.
[02:47:32.504 --> 02:47:35.966]  That's going to be put on local businesses and local companies.
[02:47:35.966 --> 02:47:39.969]  And so kind of the howling mob of people that don't trust the government
[02:47:40.509 --> 02:47:49.257]  But they can be misdirected by the social engineers to then further rob the hereditary enemy of the elite, what's left of the middle class.
[02:47:49.257 --> 02:47:51.339]  And so how do we navigate that?
[02:47:51.339 --> 02:47:54.222]  Because we know the social engineers have got a lot of tricks up their sleeves.
[02:47:54.775 --> 02:47:57.517]  Well, it's going to be a difficult one, and you really nailed it.
[02:47:57.517 --> 02:48:02.960]  They're taxing the American business people out of business.
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:05.742]  They're giving the big tax breaks to the big guys.
[02:48:05.742 --> 02:48:08.464]  And Michael Moore is wrong about capitalism.
[02:48:08.464 --> 02:48:10.825]  It's not that capitalism isn't dead.
[02:48:10.825 --> 02:48:13.447]  Capitalism didn't cause this problem.
[02:48:13.447 --> 02:48:17.450]  It was caused by the criminal gangs, the Wall Street mob.
[02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:19.612]  You know, you've heard me say this.
[02:48:19.612 --> 02:48:27.639]  If the names on Wall Street were named Solenti, Caruso, Mondavi, Butoni, Rossini, Bellini, they'd call it the Mafia.
[02:48:27.639 --> 02:48:32.383]  But you're not allowed to call these white shoe boys crooks and criminals, oh no!
[02:48:32.383 --> 02:48:37.027]  They don't do loan sharking, that's just the cost of doing business to charge 30% on a credit card.
[02:48:38.368 --> 02:48:42.749]  Oh no, they don't do Ponzi schemes or pyramid scams.
[02:48:42.749 --> 02:48:46.530]  They do credit default swaps, auction rate securities.
[02:48:46.530 --> 02:48:51.831]  No, and they're blaming it on capitalism, just like you said, to turn it into fascism.
[02:48:51.831 --> 02:48:53.911]  There's nothing wrong with capitalism.
[02:48:53.911 --> 02:48:55.812]  This is greed and corruption.
[02:48:55.812 --> 02:48:57.412]  This is the Robert Rubens.
[02:48:57.412 --> 02:48:59.132]  This is the Henry Paulsons.
[02:48:59.132 --> 02:49:01.993]  This is the Larry Summers, the genius.
[02:49:01.993 --> 02:49:04.073]  Larry the genius Summers.
[02:49:04.073 --> 02:49:06.234]  These are the people that have created it.
[02:49:06.234 --> 02:49:07.314]  Timothy Geithner.
[02:49:07.814 --> 02:49:18.151]  There's nothing wrong with capitalism, so they're going to blame it on capitalism and just like you pointed out, they're going to use it to turn it around to gain more control.
[02:49:18.151 --> 02:49:21.416]  And what's amazing about this is
[02:49:23.075 --> 02:49:25.637]  We know that it's Madoff who founded the Nasdaq.
[02:49:25.637 --> 02:49:29.800]  We know it's Ken Lay that came up with the global carbon trading scam.
[02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:34.823]  Schwarzenegger's announcing he's gonna ban TVs above 40 inches, tax all the rest.
[02:49:34.823 --> 02:49:42.128]  Taxes on firearms, taxes on farms, taxes on ranches, taxes on beef, taxes on plastic.
[02:49:42.128 --> 02:49:44.170]  A wet blanket on an already
[02:49:44.770 --> 02:49:50.235]  It's a staggering economy that is burning out, that is becoming extinguished.
[02:49:50.235 --> 02:50:03.989]  They want to destroy the economy so that they can consolidate it and we witness these criminals just expanding their scams and never stopping and only getting more greedy with no end in sight.
[02:50:04.355 --> 02:50:05.476]  No end in sight.
[02:50:05.476 --> 02:50:07.458]  Here's another trend that we're working on.
[02:50:07.458 --> 02:50:08.939]  There are two trends.
[02:50:08.939 --> 02:50:14.063]  The first one was for 2010 is TerraTron 2010.
[02:50:14.063 --> 02:50:16.765]  The next one is Buy America.
[02:50:16.765 --> 02:50:25.292]  As they devalue the dollar and the currencies around the world are worth more, they're going to come in here and buy this country up.
[02:50:25.612 --> 02:50:26.253]  Stay there!
[02:50:42.014 --> 02:50:42.675]  Stay there, Gerald.
[02:50:42.675 --> 02:50:44.217]  We'll come back and talk more about that.
[02:50:44.217 --> 02:50:48.781]  Gerald Salente is our guest, and his website is TrendsResearch.com.
[02:50:48.781 --> 02:50:50.203]  TrendsResearch.com.
[02:50:50.203 --> 02:50:51.004]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:51.004 --> 02:50:55.769]  Our websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and InfoWars.net.
[02:50:55.769 --> 02:51:01.415]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.415 --> 02:51:04.138]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:51:05.794 --> 02:51:06.094]  I think so.
[02:51:22.722 --> 02:51:22.982]  I think so.
[02:51:51.135 --> 02:51:53.877]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:51:53.877 --> 02:51:54.538]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[02:52:02.412 --> 02:52:06.436]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.436 --> 02:52:09.678]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.678 --> 02:52:14.843]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.843 --> 02:52:20.888]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.888 --> 02:52:23.110]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:23.610 --> 02:52:25.191]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:25.191 --> 02:52:26.611]  And right now in Washington, D.C.
[02:52:46.918 --> 02:52:49.819]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.819 --> 02:53:00.922]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:00.922 --> 02:53:05.463]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:53:05.463 --> 02:53:09.804]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:53:09.804 --> 02:53:15.566]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:53:15.566 --> 02:53:15.986]  It's true.
[02:53:16.306 --> 02:53:21.991]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:53:21.991 --> 02:53:25.574]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:53:25.574 --> 02:53:30.297]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:53:30.297 --> 02:53:33.060]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:53:33.060 --> 02:53:36.382]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:53:37.523 --> 02:53:41.666]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:53:41.666 --> 02:53:46.710]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:50.893]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:53:50.893 --> 02:53:52.674]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:53:52.674 --> 02:53:57.277]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:54:08.766 --> 02:54:12.928]  Gerald Cilente will be with us for a half hour.
[02:54:12.928 --> 02:54:14.709]  Till the half hour point in the next hour.
[02:54:14.709 --> 02:54:16.549]  Very honored to have him.
[02:54:16.549 --> 02:54:19.050]  I want to throw out some news headlines at him as well.
[02:54:19.050 --> 02:54:25.093]  We're going to start taking your calls in T-minus five minutes when we go into the fourth and final hour here.
[02:54:29.332 --> 02:54:36.455]  Basically, government is a giant nexus point that allows corruption to pour in and feed off the people.
[02:54:36.455 --> 02:54:42.258]  The Congress won't even read and won't even publish all of the health care bill.
[02:54:42.258 --> 02:54:44.459]  They passed NAFTA and GATT without reading it.
[02:54:44.459 --> 02:54:47.621]  Member told us how great NAFTA and GATT would be.
[02:54:47.621 --> 02:54:49.882]  Gerald, how is the system going to keep
[02:54:51.078 --> 02:55:02.680]  The people from removing NAFTA and GATT, ending the open borders, ending all the welfare-free illegals, how are they going to be able to continue the war when there's giant soup kitchens and long lines?
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:04.461]  How are they going to be able to continue this?
[02:55:04.461 --> 02:55:06.821]  Well, my answer is a control grid.
[02:55:06.821 --> 02:55:07.081]  U.S.
[02:55:07.081 --> 02:55:15.703]  News & World Report has announced that the police have kill switches in basically all the new cars through OnStar and other systems where they just turn your car off.
[02:55:15.703 --> 02:55:16.903]  They always planned that.
[02:55:17.523 --> 02:55:23.087]  I mean, clearly they've put this high-tech control grid in, knowing they were going to bring in this tyranny later.
[02:55:23.087 --> 02:55:25.268]  But still, I think it's wishful thinking.
[02:55:25.268 --> 02:55:27.850]  Like you said, desperate people do desperate things.
[02:55:27.850 --> 02:55:29.731]  They're not going to be able to control what happens.
[02:55:30.194 --> 02:55:31.736]  No, they're not.
[02:55:31.736 --> 02:55:33.458]  It's way beyond their control.
[02:55:33.458 --> 02:55:49.455]  You know, people should understand as they look around and they look at who these world leaders are, or their own leaders, you know, Nancy Pelosi, the Bonnie Franks, the Bonners, the Shelbys, the Dodds, the Obamas, the Geithners, the Summers.
[02:55:50.035 --> 02:56:04.343]  And all those people you couldn't stand in high school that wanted to be the class president or the head of the student council in college, or the people that worked on the newspapers, the people that you really, you know, they always thought that they were better than you.
[02:56:05.143 --> 02:56:06.804]  Well, guess what, folks?
[02:56:06.804 --> 02:56:12.906]  All those people you couldn't stand in high school, those are the people that are telling you what to do right now.
[02:56:12.906 --> 02:56:24.251]  And just as you looked at them back in high school, you saw that they were a bunch of brown nosers and suck-ups, and they really didn't know much about anything other than having an attitude.
[02:56:24.711 --> 02:56:26.093]  Well, that's who they are.
[02:56:26.093 --> 02:56:28.336]  They still don't know much about anything.
[02:56:28.336 --> 02:56:42.655]  They pretend to, and they have this phalanx of guards around them, and all of the pomp and circumstances that pumps them up, and of course, you know, they're living these privileged lives, so they actually do think they're better than the rest of us.
[02:56:43.035 --> 02:56:45.878]  We're going to talk about that more after we take calls, but when I read about
[02:57:03.769 --> 02:57:07.331]  The psychology of Henry Kissinger and all these different globalists.
[02:57:07.331 --> 02:57:09.972]  They themselves admit they love the guards.
[02:57:09.972 --> 02:57:11.353]  They love the pomp.
[02:57:11.353 --> 02:57:13.174]  They love the awards.
[02:57:13.174 --> 02:57:16.696]  And I'm not saying I'm some perfect person, but I can't stand pomp.
[02:57:16.696 --> 02:57:19.998]  I can't stand just fake praise.
[02:57:19.998 --> 02:57:23.239]  But I guess for people like the Queen of England, they love uniforms.
[02:57:23.239 --> 02:57:24.980]  They love big golden crowns.
[02:57:24.980 --> 02:57:25.681]  They love
[02:57:27.543 --> 02:57:31.205]  And they're smart at certain levels, but at another level they're dumb.
[02:57:31.205 --> 02:57:37.769]  They do just paper over it with the police state and their lies, but like you have been saying, this isn't going to hold water.
[02:57:37.769 --> 02:57:38.950]  No, it's not.
[02:57:38.950 --> 02:57:46.995]  You know, and again, when you hear these politicians like Al Gore or Hillary Clinton or Bush, I'm going to fight for you.
[02:57:46.995 --> 02:57:50.817]  These people couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag.
[02:57:50.817 --> 02:57:54.339]  Anybody that calls them their leader needs to have their heads examined.
[02:57:54.739 --> 02:57:56.741]  These people couldn't lead me across the street.
[02:57:56.741 --> 02:57:58.642]  They don't want to lead a country.
[02:57:58.642 --> 02:58:00.464]  Again, it's all show.
[02:58:00.464 --> 02:58:02.125]  It's the Obama Show.
[02:58:02.125 --> 02:58:04.467]  We've never had a show like this one before.
[02:58:04.467 --> 02:58:07.729]  He's on daytime TV, late night TV.
[02:58:07.729 --> 02:58:09.090]  He's at town hall meetings.
[02:58:09.090 --> 02:58:10.892]  He's on factory floors.
[02:58:10.892 --> 02:58:12.693]  He's all over the place.
[02:58:12.693 --> 02:58:13.774]  It's a show.
[02:58:13.774 --> 02:58:15.696]  There's nothing behind it.
[02:58:15.696 --> 02:58:17.137]  It's the Wizard of Oz.
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:24.462]  And people are finding out that it's all hollow and that's why his approval rating is dropping like a rock.
[02:58:24.462 --> 02:58:29.204]  We'll talk about some of the other future trends you haven't gotten to yet before you leave us.
[02:58:29.204 --> 02:58:37.787]  We'll also discuss that key area, Gerald, that you got into dealing with the looting of America by offshore corporations.
[02:58:37.787 --> 02:58:41.528]  We'll be right back in one minute with the final hour.
[02:58:41.528 --> 02:58:46.510]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:52.261 --> 02:58:56.284]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.284 --> 02:58:59.527]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.527 --> 02:59:04.331]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:59:04.331 --> 02:59:10.737]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.737 --> 02:59:12.959]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.499 --> 02:59:13.799]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:13.799 --> 02:59:14.300]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.300 --> 02:59:15.100]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.100 --> 02:59:16.261]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.261 --> 02:59:18.502]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.392 --> 02:59:34.514]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.514 --> 02:59:39.678]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:59:39.678 --> 02:59:54.149]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:54.149 --> 02:59:56.531]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.531 --> 02:59:59.233]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:04.724 --> 03:00:06.425]  We are locked and loaded.
[03:00:06.425 --> 03:00:09.086]  We found it in the front line in the info war.
[03:00:09.086 --> 03:00:10.246]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:00:10.246 --> 03:00:15.468]  Gerald Cilente of TrendsResearch.com is our guest for another 30 minutes.
[03:00:15.468 --> 03:00:17.029]  We're going straight to your calls.
[03:00:17.029 --> 03:00:25.352]  Before he leaves us, more trends forecasting as we look over the horizon through the mind of Gerald Cilente.
[03:00:25.352 --> 03:00:27.393]  Cynthia in Maryland, thanks for holding.
[03:00:27.393 --> 03:00:28.814]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:00:28.814 --> 03:00:29.134]  Welcome.
[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:31.740]  Hi!
[03:00:31.740 --> 03:00:59.743]  First of all, I wanted to say, before the break, before this one, I noticed that there was Doctor Who music playing in the background, and I thought that was so apropos, because I just wanted to say that Doctor Who, Charlie Jade, Eureka, Heroes, and another show, everybody knows them as science fiction, but I have to say that they are based on fact.
[03:01:00.765 --> 03:01:13.002]  There are a lot of aspects of those shows that are put into science fiction, but are actually based on fact.
[03:01:13.002 --> 03:01:14.785]  When I grew up, hardly anybody had cable.
[03:01:15.777 --> 03:01:30.268]  And we didn't have cable, and one of the few shows on was Doctor Who, and I watched it a few times, but Paul Watson wrote an article a few years ago about the new Doctor Who, where the government stages a fake alien attack on London as a pretext to crack down on the population.
[03:01:30.268 --> 03:01:33.830]  Do you have any questions for Gerald Cilente?
[03:01:33.830 --> 03:01:41.396]  No, I just wanted to give some other educational resources, being Link TV, Free Speech TV,
[03:01:42.370 --> 03:01:47.132]  WPFW and Democracy Now.
[03:01:47.132 --> 03:01:54.834]  My problem with Democracy Now is it is better than some mainstream corporate media, but it's still Ford Foundation funded and is still behind Obama.
[03:01:54.834 --> 03:01:59.116]  But at least they did admit that Obama lied about how he wasn't going to sign signing statements.
[03:01:59.116 --> 03:02:07.079]  Gerald Cilente, I mean, we know they're liars, but you've been studying this for 30 plus years and advising government corporations, you name it.
[03:02:08.019 --> 03:02:11.822]  Is the lying getting more intense or is it just we're aware of it?
[03:02:11.822 --> 03:02:29.595]  Because the New York Times and others have a school program where they give fact sheets to school children saying there is no mercury in the shots, it doesn't give you neurological disorders, it can't sterilize you, but then the drug insert from FDA.gov, I showed this on television,
[03:02:30.697 --> 03:02:34.723]  And Obama, he seems to have broken all the lying records in my book.
[03:02:34.723 --> 03:02:35.584]  Your take on that?
[03:02:45.458 --> 03:03:09.150]  Well he has, and every time that you go through the litany of lies for Obama, what he said he was going to do, whether it has to do with habeas corpus, rendition, the Patriot Act, wiretapping, pulling the troops out of Iraq, putting more troops into Afghanistan,
[03:03:09.970 --> 03:03:13.432]  Bombing sovereign nations.
[03:03:13.432 --> 03:03:15.813]  You go after one issue after another.
[03:03:15.813 --> 03:03:20.396]  Lobbyists, lying, saying he would have open government.
[03:03:20.396 --> 03:03:38.546]  And you tell these things to his liberal supporters, and what I say is that you go through the facts and they look at you, and the only thing they could do is give you a key-sheeting grin and a balsamic smile, and they say, well, give him time, or, oh, he can't really fight that much about this.
[03:03:38.886 --> 03:03:40.348]  You just give him a chance.
[03:03:40.348 --> 03:03:41.430]  What chance?
[03:03:41.430 --> 03:03:42.051]  How much more chance?
[03:03:42.051 --> 03:03:43.353]  He's one of them.
[03:03:43.353 --> 03:03:45.496]  Nothing has changed.
[03:03:45.496 --> 03:03:49.281]  It's only a different team and they're playing the same crooked games.
[03:03:49.281 --> 03:03:50.663]  Has the lying increased?
[03:03:50.663 --> 03:03:52.085]  Yes, it has.
[03:03:52.085 --> 03:03:54.569]  I've never seen anything like this before in my life.
[03:03:55.129 --> 03:03:58.371]  It's one lie after another every day.
[03:03:58.371 --> 03:04:24.609]  But the biggest thing that's happened, Alex, between Bush and Obama in one year, in one year, is that this country went from the greatest entrepreneurial country in the world, the one that was the envy of everybody that wanted to come here to make their mark, to now a country that's too big to fail, that they have jammed down the public's throats, this too-big-to-fail lie, and that all our resources should be going to protect them.
[03:04:25.149 --> 03:04:29.611]  You know, in our Trends Journal, we did a story about this too-big-to-fail.
[03:04:29.611 --> 03:04:35.093]  After Obama was elected in December, they asked him, why are we bailing out these companies?
[03:04:35.093 --> 03:04:37.334]  And he came out with this two-bit analogy.
[03:04:37.334 --> 03:04:46.438]  Well, if your neighbor's house is on fire, even if he smoked in bed or left the stove on, wouldn't you want to put it out if it was going to catch your fire onto your house?
[03:04:46.438 --> 03:04:51.981]  Well, seven months later, on 60 Minutes, they asked Federal Chairman Bernanke the same question.
[03:04:52.808 --> 03:04:54.049]  And you know what he said?
[03:04:54.049 --> 03:04:58.274]  What if your neighbor's house is on fire and he left a stove on and smoked in bed?
[03:04:58.274 --> 03:04:59.515]  Would you want to put it on?
[03:04:59.515 --> 03:04:59.995]  Stay there!
[03:04:59.995 --> 03:05:01.597]  They're reading off a script.
[03:05:01.597 --> 03:05:04.600]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.600 --> 03:05:09.946]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.946 --> 03:05:12.008]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.008 --> 03:05:14.891]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[03:05:15.211 --> 03:05:16.973]  Food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:16.973 --> 03:05:18.154]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.154 --> 03:05:19.295]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.295 --> 03:05:21.176]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.176 --> 03:05:22.237]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.237 --> 03:05:24.439]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.439 --> 03:05:25.780]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.780 --> 03:05:27.321]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.321 --> 03:05:32.586]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.586 --> 03:05:36.169]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.169 --> 03:05:39.632]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:39.972 --> 03:05:41.192]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.192 --> 03:05:42.113]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.113 --> 03:05:43.213]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.213 --> 03:05:44.133]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.133 --> 03:05:45.234]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.234 --> 03:05:48.295]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.295 --> 03:05:50.056]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.056 --> 03:05:50.976]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.540 --> 03:06:10.648]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[03:06:10.648 --> 03:06:12.250]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:06:12.250 --> 03:06:13.331]  It's very real.
[03:06:13.331 --> 03:06:13.691]  I know.
[03:06:13.691 --> 03:06:17.914]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[03:06:17.914 --> 03:06:21.137]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.
[03:06:21.137 --> 03:06:29.344]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecola Blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[03:06:29.764 --> 03:06:36.465]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[03:06:36.465 --> 03:06:45.167]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[03:06:45.167 --> 03:06:49.888]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[03:06:49.888 --> 03:06:50.108]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[03:06:50.108 --> 03:06:51.248]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web
[03:07:02.578 --> 03:07:06.605]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:07:06.605 --> 03:07:09.850]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:07:09.850 --> 03:07:11.252]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:07:11.963 --> 03:07:14.644]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:07:14.644 --> 03:07:21.027]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:07:21.027 --> 03:07:26.069]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:07:26.069 --> 03:07:29.491]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:07:29.491 --> 03:07:36.194]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:07:36.334 --> 03:07:38.675]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:07:38.675 --> 03:07:40.255]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:07:40.255 --> 03:07:42.715]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:07:42.715 --> 03:07:44.836]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:07:44.836 --> 03:07:49.977]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:07:49.977 --> 03:07:54.998]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:07:54.998 --> 03:07:59.099]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:06.124 --> 03:08:10.966]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:08:10.966 --> 03:08:12.546]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.546 --> 03:08:13.847]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:13.847 --> 03:08:18.289]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.289 --> 03:08:22.350]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:29.514 --> 03:08:38.418]  We're going to go to Michael, Nikki, Luke, Captain Truth, and others for Trends Forecaster Gerald Cilente, but I wanted to finish up talking about Obama.
[03:08:38.418 --> 03:08:44.321]  It's just like when you grow up loving a football team, you identify with it like a political party.
[03:08:44.321 --> 03:08:47.302]  You don't want to admit when it's doing things wrong or lying to you.
[03:08:47.302 --> 03:08:52.445]  And so many Americans, this is changing, and that's our salvation, politically.
[03:08:54.062 --> 03:08:56.706]  That the Republicans, the leadership, will lie to you.
[03:08:56.706 --> 03:08:58.087]  They work for the same special interests.
[03:08:58.087 --> 03:09:02.153]  The Democrats work for the same offshore criminal special interests.
[03:09:02.153 --> 03:09:07.139]  But you talk to Obama supporters, and it's just like Bush supporters, and we would say, he's spying on you.
[03:09:07.139 --> 03:09:11.085]  He's setting up homeland security for gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[03:09:12.551 --> 03:09:16.735]  They're setting up Brigade Homeland through Northcom to use the military against us.
[03:09:16.735 --> 03:09:18.277]  He lied about WMDs.
[03:09:18.277 --> 03:09:19.618]  He's torturing people.
[03:09:19.618 --> 03:09:21.800]  He's tripled the size of government.
[03:09:21.800 --> 03:09:26.625]  He's going along with all the Clinton advisors from before him with this seamless scam.
[03:09:26.625 --> 03:09:31.670]  The politicians change, but the Wall Street cronies stay in place, and they wouldn't listen.
[03:09:32.190 --> 03:09:39.151]  Now as soon as Bush left office they suddenly woke up to all these issues and got upset because now they saw Obama carrying out the issues.
[03:09:39.151 --> 03:09:56.395]  Suddenly Democrats that could see what Bush was doing that was wrong were blind to Obama and they'll get this sickening smile and say, you're just jealous of him, you're just a Republican, you're just a racist, you just don't like him, you gotta give him time when he's lied, as we mentioned earlier, about everything.
[03:09:56.395 --> 03:09:57.335]  A new standard.
[03:09:58.015 --> 03:09:58.595]  In line.
[03:09:58.595 --> 03:09:59.596]  Worse than Clinton.
[03:09:59.596 --> 03:10:00.496]  Worse than Bush.
[03:10:00.496 --> 03:10:02.337]  Worse than Tricky Dick Nixon.
[03:10:02.337 --> 03:10:05.879]  Now they're having to give Senate speeches on the floor about his enemies list.
[03:10:05.879 --> 03:10:11.162]  I'm listed in the news as in the top 25 White House enemies for Obama deception.
[03:10:11.162 --> 03:10:13.363]  They're really going to hate fall of the Republic.
[03:10:13.363 --> 03:10:14.223]  It's now launched.
[03:10:14.223 --> 03:10:14.884]  It's now dropped.
[03:10:15.624 --> 03:10:21.088]  And it's this delusional syndrome where either people are waking up more than ever.
[03:10:21.088 --> 03:10:22.349]  We see a quickening there.
[03:10:22.349 --> 03:10:23.950]  Huge numbers waking up.
[03:10:23.950 --> 03:10:27.952]  But still, those that are staying asleep are getting even stupider.
[03:10:27.952 --> 03:10:29.533]  They love being abused.
[03:10:29.533 --> 03:10:30.914]  They love being lied to.
[03:10:30.914 --> 03:10:32.595]  They love being scammed.
[03:10:32.595 --> 03:10:33.516]  They think it's cute.
[03:10:33.516 --> 03:10:34.657]  They think it's funny.
[03:10:34.657 --> 03:10:36.598]  They have invested in Obama.
[03:10:36.598 --> 03:10:37.879]  They have invested in the government.
[03:10:37.879 --> 03:10:38.860]  I have the Wall Street Journal.
[03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:57.847]  With the head of the health care lobby admitting that the insurance companies wrote this as alluding, and that the government wants a new tax, so they're going to split it with the insurance companies, and that they may back out because of citizen pressure by both liberals and conservatives against $5,000 fines.
[03:10:57.847 --> 03:10:58.487]  They want that.
[03:10:58.487 --> 03:11:02.069]  Obama only wants $2,000 fines if you don't get insurance.
[03:11:02.069 --> 03:11:04.189]  That they're pulling out of what they wrote.
[03:11:04.189 --> 03:11:07.671]  And they admit that in this insurer's stand against committee's plan.
[03:11:08.291 --> 03:11:15.578]  So we hear the fake left saying, oh Alex, you don't want the health care plan because you work for the insurance companies, when the insurance companies wrote the stinking thing.
[03:11:15.578 --> 03:11:18.361]  It's like, it's a matrix of lies.
[03:11:18.361 --> 03:11:22.445]  The lies are so big that the general public just doesn't even know what to do.
[03:11:22.445 --> 03:11:25.428]  It's like the media, Gerald, saying there's no mercury in the shot.
[03:11:26.028 --> 03:11:35.596]  As I mentioned, when I have the insert for the H1N1 shot right here, and FDA.gov saying it can give you Guillain-Barré's and can sterilize you and give you cancer.
[03:11:35.596 --> 03:11:42.943]  I mean, it's just, what's going to happen to the system as people finally wake up to the fact that they've been completely screwed?
[03:11:43.735 --> 03:11:44.936]  Well, again, we're seeing it.
[03:11:44.936 --> 03:11:54.606]  This is, again, as we've mentioned many times, and have been writing about it since 2002, and that this is much more than an economic crisis.
[03:11:54.606 --> 03:11:57.289]  This is the decline of empire America.
[03:11:57.289 --> 03:11:59.411]  We've lost our morality.
[03:11:59.411 --> 03:12:03.094]  And, you know, morals don't change, values do.
[03:12:03.094 --> 03:12:06.238]  And people have lost their own self-respect.
[03:12:06.938 --> 03:12:10.760]  When they talk about health care reform, what are you going to reform?
[03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:13.702]  Look at this nation, it's a junk food eating nation.
[03:12:13.702 --> 03:12:18.764]  They poison their bodies with junk food, they poison their minds with junk information.
[03:12:18.764 --> 03:12:33.332]  How could any intelligent adult turn on the TV and listen to the nightly news or any of this other stuff when you have these bad actors, these great B-actors reading scripts that talk about Michael Jackson for a month and a half?
[03:12:33.852 --> 03:12:39.353]  So the people, again, America's the first, second, and third world nation wrapped into one.
[03:12:39.353 --> 03:12:46.015]  We're looking at a good 20% of the people right now that are neither right or left.
[03:12:46.015 --> 03:12:53.256]  They're all independent thinkers that are going to be at the forefront of this revolution.
[03:12:53.256 --> 03:12:58.597]  So again, we see this breaking down, and we also see the nation breaking down.
[03:12:58.597 --> 03:13:01.178]  And we can see it breaking down into smaller parts.
[03:13:02.466 --> 03:13:14.773]  Well, Gerald, before the mainstream media, with other inoculation campaigns they push, they would just beat around the bush, never say there wasn't mercury in it, they would just leave that out and say it's safe.
[03:13:14.773 --> 03:13:29.381]  Now the New York Times and Government Program for Public Schools lies and gives parents and school children a handout saying there is no mercury, there is no adjuvants, it cannot, there are no side effects when
[03:13:29.961 --> 03:13:42.866]  Every of the five versions of the vaccine, I'm holding one, anyone can get this at Walgreens, saying it can give you neurological disorders, saying it can sterilize you, saying it has mercury.
[03:13:42.866 --> 03:13:55.411]  I mean, I'm reading from FDA.gov, influenza, H1N1, 2009, vaccine information sheet, diagnostics limited, put out by Norvitas, the main vaccine maker.
[03:13:55.411 --> 03:13:59.633]  Alex, look, the New York Times, the paper that took the name
[03:13:59.653 --> 03:14:02.835]  In front of me the New York Times last Saturday, October 17th.
[03:14:29.056 --> 03:14:45.490]  This guy goes on to say, well there are plenty of experts who will tell you the worst is over, and I hope they're right, but as Mr. Roth is about this book Discovered in the 1930s, the experts can't predict the future any better than the rest of us.
[03:14:45.490 --> 03:14:50.234]  Yes, we can predict the future better than they can.
[03:14:50.234 --> 03:14:52.817]  It's the arrogance of the New York Times.
[03:14:54.478 --> 03:14:57.241]  Well, but you said it though, they're delusional.
[03:14:57.241 --> 03:15:00.525]  Don't they know that's why they're all going under and going bankrupt?
[03:15:00.525 --> 03:15:04.009]  Don't they know that's why mainstream media is in a crisis?
[03:15:04.009 --> 03:15:08.553]  And instead of telling the truth, they just intensify the lying.
[03:15:08.553 --> 03:15:10.596]  It's like putting gasoline on a fire to put it out.
[03:15:11.817 --> 03:15:13.177]  It's the same club.
[03:15:13.177 --> 03:15:16.478]  It's the White Shoe Boys Club.
[03:15:16.478 --> 03:15:19.179]  That's why you go to Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.
[03:15:19.179 --> 03:15:22.340]  What do you think, they don't teach you better than anywhere else?
[03:15:22.340 --> 03:15:35.463]  If you get into the system, and you look at the same, you read the New York Times, they quote the same experts that have been wrong a hundred times before to ask them what's going to happen next.
[03:15:35.843 --> 03:15:43.466]  And then they have the arrogance to say that nobody can forecast the future because they didn't see it coming.
[03:15:43.466 --> 03:15:46.907]  And again, this is the paper that took the nation to war.
[03:15:46.907 --> 03:15:55.010]  Let's not forget the stories about the yellow cake and the aluminum tubes and the nuclear weapons in Iraq.
[03:15:55.010 --> 03:15:59.751]  It's just another level of lying, though, to say there are no adverse reactions to the vaccine.
[03:15:59.751 --> 03:16:00.052]  Exactly.
[03:16:00.052 --> 03:16:01.072]  It's just another lie.
[03:16:01.072 --> 03:16:02.693]  But they're used to it.
[03:16:02.693 --> 03:16:03.733]  This is what they're good at.
[03:16:04.494 --> 03:16:05.415]  Michael in Florida.
[03:16:05.415 --> 03:16:06.015]  You're on the air.
[03:16:06.015 --> 03:16:07.596]  Go ahead.
[03:16:07.596 --> 03:16:08.136]  Hi Alex.
[03:16:08.136 --> 03:16:09.357]  Hi Gerald.
[03:16:09.357 --> 03:16:12.078]  I love the movie.
[03:16:12.078 --> 03:16:12.458]  Thank you.
[03:16:12.458 --> 03:16:13.098]  What's on your mind?
[03:16:13.098 --> 03:16:17.321]  Yeah, I have a question or maybe it's just a comment.
[03:16:17.321 --> 03:16:21.363]  It's about the movie and the Federal Reserve.
[03:16:21.363 --> 03:16:23.204]  Basically, my question is if
[03:16:26.678 --> 03:16:38.321]  Our politicians, if our Congress is all corrupt, they're passing bills without even reading them, and they're giving all our money away to offshore banks.
[03:16:38.321 --> 03:16:48.624]  That's one message, and then another gentleman that was interviewed in your movie said that he was in favor of nationalizing the Fed and putting the Fed in the hands of Congress.
[03:16:48.624 --> 03:16:53.345]  How could we trust putting the Fed in the hands of Congress if they're all corrupt?
[03:16:53.345 --> 03:16:54.806]  I'd like to comment on that.
[03:16:55.846 --> 03:16:58.809]  Number one, we have different guests on who have different perspectives.
[03:16:58.809 --> 03:17:04.335]  This is not like some cult where we just sit here and believe what I think or believe what one guest thinks.
[03:17:04.335 --> 03:17:08.680]  It's a college of ideas to get people really thinking about details.
[03:17:08.680 --> 03:17:11.963]  But number one, the Constitution says
[03:17:13.044 --> 03:17:19.666]  That the Congress is the boss because the people elect them, they follow the Constitution, the President then executes.
[03:17:19.666 --> 03:17:22.427]  The President just doesn't do what he wants.
[03:17:22.427 --> 03:17:32.069]  The Congress ran the coining and issuance of currency and credit, set the rules, until 1913, and our nation on average had a 10% growth rate from 1789 until 1913.
[03:17:32.069 --> 03:17:32.649]  Now look at us today.
[03:17:38.191 --> 03:17:49.377]  We built the capital, we built the nation, we built this wealth without an offshore banking cartel playing hanky-panky with the interest rates and the money and giving themselves unlimited cash.
[03:17:49.377 --> 03:17:59.003]  And so, yes, we need to nationalize the Fed, and Ron Paul and others have a plan under the Constitution to get us out of this crisis we're in.
[03:17:59.003 --> 03:18:01.564]  If not, these bankers are going to keep raping us.
[03:18:01.564 --> 03:18:02.325]  Gerald Solente.
[03:18:03.032 --> 03:18:04.294]  Well, you hit it.
[03:18:04.294 --> 03:18:09.120]  The Federal Reserve is Washington, and Washington's the Federal Reserve.
[03:18:09.120 --> 03:18:19.274]  At the break I was mentioning about how Obama said about the too-big-to-fail Jesus dumb analogy about your neighbor's house burning down, and then on 60 Minutes,
[03:18:19.894 --> 03:18:31.258]  Ben Bernanke several months later said, quote, if you have a neighbor who smokes in bed and he risks the risk to everybody, using the same exact analogies, bogus analogy.
[03:18:31.258 --> 03:18:37.360]  And the point being is that there is no separation between the Fed and Washington.
[03:18:37.360 --> 03:18:39.601]  Federal Reserve is Washington.
[03:18:39.601 --> 03:18:42.642]  Look who the Treasury Secretary is.
[03:18:42.642 --> 03:18:46.583]  Only a blind person can't see it.
[03:18:47.023 --> 03:18:48.925]  It's Timothy Geithner!
[03:18:48.925 --> 03:18:51.628]  Where did Timothy Geithner come from?
[03:18:51.628 --> 03:18:58.576]  Well, he was the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and now he's in charge of the Treasury!
[03:18:58.576 --> 03:19:01.159]  Well, let me... People need to get... Let me go further!
[03:19:01.840 --> 03:19:03.160]  Let me go further.
[03:19:03.160 --> 03:19:21.647]  And the guy talking about, well, somebody smoked in bed, we still gotta put the fire out, it's Bernanke and Geithner and all these private bank heads that are the ones smoking in bed, but they weren't just smoking in bed, they're the ones burning the houses down because they own and run the fire department and we didn't pay our protection money.
[03:19:21.647 --> 03:19:28.010]  And even when we pay them the tens of trillions of protection money, they just leverage that against our economy to buy us up.
[03:19:28.010 --> 03:19:28.810]  They're pirates!
[03:19:29.090 --> 03:19:30.371]  Can't people get it?
[03:19:30.371 --> 03:19:32.933]  They're criminal pirates, as Ron Paul has said.
[03:19:32.933 --> 03:19:39.017]  There isn't a grand jury in the country that couldn't indict every one of them for insider trading, conflicts of interest.
[03:19:39.017 --> 03:19:48.563]  You got all these Treasury Department heads making tens of millions apiece, in some cases billions, off of money they gave to their own stinking banks!
[03:19:48.563 --> 03:19:50.585]  I know.
[03:19:50.585 --> 03:19:51.065]  I know.
[03:19:51.065 --> 03:19:52.826]  How could anybody not see it?
[03:19:52.826 --> 03:19:58.230]  This is the greatest bank robbery in history, but the banks are doing the robbing.
[03:19:59.582 --> 03:20:00.423]  Man, I got a headache.
[03:20:00.423 --> 03:20:01.384]  I just got so mad.
[03:20:01.384 --> 03:20:01.864]  Stay with us.
[03:20:01.864 --> 03:20:02.645]  More calls straight ahead.
[03:20:02.645 --> 03:20:07.348]  You're also wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[03:20:07.348 --> 03:20:07.889]  I'm not.
[03:20:07.889 --> 03:20:08.609]  Don't trust it.
[03:20:08.609 --> 03:20:10.851]  But then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:20:10.851 --> 03:20:16.576]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:20:16.576 --> 03:20:19.138]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:20:19.138 --> 03:20:23.682]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:20:23.682 --> 03:20:26.404]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:20:26.844 --> 03:20:32.571]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:20:32.571 --> 03:20:34.834]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:20:34.834 --> 03:20:43.404]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:20:43.404 --> 03:20:44.405]  Don't pick your nose.
[03:20:44.765 --> 03:20:49.329]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:20:49.329 --> 03:20:54.453]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:20:54.453 --> 03:20:56.195]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[03:20:56.195 --> 03:20:58.417]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:20:58.417 --> 03:21:00.138]  Be well and stay well.
[03:21:00.138 --> 03:21:02.920]  Best MZ.
[03:21:02.920 --> 03:21:06.944]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.944 --> 03:21:10.186]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:10.186 --> 03:21:11.608]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:21:12.310 --> 03:21:15.331]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:15.331 --> 03:21:21.352]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:21.352 --> 03:21:26.914]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:26.914 --> 03:21:36.536]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.656 --> 03:21:38.998]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.998 --> 03:21:40.580]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.580 --> 03:21:43.062]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:43.062 --> 03:21:45.185]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:45.185 --> 03:21:50.330]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:50.330 --> 03:21:59.439]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:01.451 --> 03:22:07.334]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[03:22:07.334 --> 03:22:12.456]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[03:22:12.456 --> 03:22:13.677]  That was then.
[03:22:13.677 --> 03:22:14.977]  This is now.
[03:22:14.977 --> 03:22:17.699]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[03:22:17.699 --> 03:22:23.761]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[03:22:23.761 --> 03:22:29.024]  The DigiNet Sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings,
[03:22:29.304 --> 03:22:32.967]  Proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[03:22:32.967 --> 03:22:36.429]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[03:22:36.429 --> 03:22:40.912]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[03:22:40.912 --> 03:22:42.433]  Video never lies.
[03:22:42.433 --> 03:22:44.094]  Watch Big Brother back.

[03:23:02.204 --> 03:23:03.944]  Food security from eFoodsDirect.
[03:23:03.944 --> 03:23:06.505]  The most valuable protection your family can have.
[03:23:06.505 --> 03:23:08.006]  It's a scary world we live in.
[03:23:08.006 --> 03:23:12.368]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[03:23:12.368 --> 03:23:16.049]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[03:23:16.049 --> 03:23:23.392]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's 12 trillion dollar debt, which is why gold is now over a thousand dollars an ounce.
[03:23:23.852 --> 03:23:24.353]  We're good to go!
[03:23:43.598 --> 03:23:46.460]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:23:46.460 --> 03:23:47.900]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:24:31.135 --> 03:24:34.658]  Final segment with Gerald Cilente.
[03:24:34.658 --> 03:24:36.219]  Let's go to Nikki in Ohio.
[03:24:36.219 --> 03:24:37.119]  Nikki, quick question.
[03:24:37.119 --> 03:24:37.880]  We gotta move fast.
[03:24:37.880 --> 03:24:39.021]  Welcome.
[03:24:39.021 --> 03:24:40.062]  Hi there.
[03:24:40.062 --> 03:24:42.244]  It's great to be on the show with you guys.
[03:24:42.244 --> 03:24:43.685]  You guys have the excellent show.
[03:24:43.685 --> 03:24:45.966]  I'm always excited to hear both of you speaking.
[03:24:45.966 --> 03:24:48.989]  First, I wanted to ask a question about
[03:24:49.702 --> 03:24:54.025]  The PPFA award, if you know about the Margaret Sanger award?
[03:24:54.025 --> 03:24:57.747]  I know Margaret Sanger was a top eugenicist and best friends with Adolf Hitler.
[03:24:57.747 --> 03:25:10.515]  The Rockefellers gave her the money and she said blacks were subhuman, but we have to pose as liberals so we can set up death centers in their neighborhoods and so the liberals love it and offer their children up to the state, but I'm not familiar with this award.
[03:25:12.005 --> 03:25:14.587]  Well, this is interesting.
[03:25:14.587 --> 03:25:18.049]  I'll tell you what, I'm going to come back to you because this isn't for Gerald Cilente.
[03:25:18.049 --> 03:25:19.190]  We don't stay there, Nikki.
[03:25:19.190 --> 03:25:22.853]  We don't screen the calls, but when we go to you and it's not for the guest, you know what?
[03:25:22.853 --> 03:25:23.733]  I'm just going to go to calls.
[03:25:23.733 --> 03:25:34.981]  I know a lot of these are for Gerald, but with the time we have left, Gerald, finish up with other trends, other predictions, because current events form future trends in the last three minutes.
[03:25:34.981 --> 03:25:37.103]  Tell us what else we should be on the lookout for.
[03:25:37.103 --> 03:25:39.665]  By the way, Gerald Cilente is in Fall of the Republic.
[03:25:39.665 --> 03:25:39.945]  Go ahead.
[03:25:40.884 --> 03:25:47.390]  What people should be aware of now is that anything can happen, and this is a time for survival strategies.
[03:25:47.390 --> 03:25:48.691]  So prepare for the worst.
[03:25:48.691 --> 03:25:50.773]  You always could move back from that.
[03:25:50.773 --> 03:25:56.238]  And we're very concerned about the probabilities of bank holidays, dollar devaluation.
[03:25:56.958 --> 03:26:00.580]  And those are our major concerns right now.
[03:26:00.580 --> 03:26:03.922]  With the holidays coming up again, you know, rein in spending.
[03:26:03.922 --> 03:26:07.204]  Don't spend an extra penny that you don't have to.
[03:26:07.204 --> 03:26:11.247]  And again, don't support anything corporate that you don't have to.
[03:26:11.247 --> 03:26:19.372]  The major trends we're looking at coming along the line is this trend we call selective technology.
[03:26:19.372 --> 03:26:21.433]  Learning how to do things simply.
[03:26:22.179 --> 03:26:27.800]  A great story, what's going on in India right now, and this is how you can start making money.
[03:26:27.800 --> 03:26:31.501]  They're using technology to help the poorest people.
[03:26:31.501 --> 03:26:34.921]  So they have cell phones, for example, that only cost $20.
[03:26:34.921 --> 03:26:37.442]  Refrigerators that cost $70.
[03:26:37.442 --> 03:26:39.942]  Little stoves that cost $43.
[03:26:39.942 --> 03:26:41.363]  High technology.
[03:26:41.363 --> 03:26:48.844]  I'm saying this because people looking for opportunities start looking for these kind of things to start selling in the States.
[03:26:49.344 --> 03:26:52.848]  Because the standard of living is going to continue to decline.
[03:26:52.848 --> 03:26:54.911]  Necessity is the mother of invention.
[03:26:54.911 --> 03:27:03.300]  So we're going to see a lot of inventing opportunities to start providing new products and services to a declining economy.
[03:27:03.300 --> 03:27:04.902]  These are the ways to look.
[03:27:04.902 --> 03:27:05.243]  Also...
[03:27:06.169 --> 03:27:12.691]  In the old areas of old cities, you're going to start seeing them rebirth.
[03:27:12.691 --> 03:27:24.653]  So people that are looking for investment opportunities in real estate, as we are up here in Kingston, New York, you start looking for those beautiful old cities that haven't been destroyed through urban renewal.
[03:27:24.653 --> 03:27:31.115]  Because young people are going to be looking for places to live, they're going to start moving back into these areas.
[03:27:31.115 --> 03:27:32.415]  So those are areas to consider.
[03:27:32.475 --> 03:27:33.796]  By the way, that's already starting.
[03:27:33.796 --> 03:27:38.139]  We're already seeing a flood of people getting out of the cities into the country.
[03:27:38.139 --> 03:27:38.759]  Right.
[03:27:38.759 --> 03:27:41.361]  And especially these great old small towns.
[03:27:42.068 --> 03:27:43.970]  So those are the areas to look at.
[03:27:43.970 --> 03:27:46.092]  A rebuilding of community.
[03:27:46.092 --> 03:27:50.896]  And that old saying, use it up, wear it out, make it do, do without.
[03:27:50.896 --> 03:27:52.898]  Start buying quality products.
[03:27:52.898 --> 03:27:54.019]  Everything American.
[03:27:54.019 --> 03:27:55.581]  Grow your own food.
[03:27:55.581 --> 03:27:57.563]  Become more self-sustaining.
[03:27:57.563 --> 03:28:05.090]  The products that you have on Prison Planet and the other places around, those are the things to start looking into.
[03:28:05.090 --> 03:28:06.471]  Heal yourself.
[03:28:06.471 --> 03:28:07.132]  Healthcare.
[03:28:07.572 --> 03:28:17.593]  For this nation to get into shape, and for people to survive what's coming ahead, you need to be healthy spiritually, emotionally, and physically.
[03:28:20.012 --> 03:28:29.941]  And in closing, in the minute and a half we have left, I hope people will visit TrendsResearch.com and check out all your other great work, and also check you out in Fall of the Republic that just was released yesterday.
[03:28:29.941 --> 03:28:33.664]  In closing, when will the tyranny peak?
[03:28:33.664 --> 03:28:34.965]  When do you think we're going to come out of it?
[03:28:34.965 --> 03:28:34.985]  2012?
[03:28:34.985 --> 03:28:35.025]  2013?
[03:28:35.025 --> 03:28:39.529]  We don't see us coming out of this for a long time economically.
[03:28:39.529 --> 03:28:41.711]  This is a long decline.
[03:28:41.711 --> 03:28:46.595]  The only reason we got out of the last one, Alex, go back to the dot-com bust of 2000.
[03:28:48.336 --> 03:28:51.398]  $5 trillion is wiped out of the market.
[03:28:51.398 --> 03:28:56.782]  The way they got it out was they lowered interest rates to 46-year lows.
[03:28:56.782 --> 03:28:57.962]  Now they've done it again.
[03:28:57.962 --> 03:29:01.765]  They've created the big credit crisis in the real estate bubble.
[03:29:01.765 --> 03:29:04.006]  Now they've created the bailout bubble.
[03:29:04.006 --> 03:29:10.270]  What we're concerned about is that after the bailout bubble blows up, then they take you to war.
[03:29:10.270 --> 03:29:12.652]  So we're telling people to be on the alert.
[03:29:12.652 --> 03:29:14.373]  Don't buy into the lies.
[03:29:15.333 --> 03:29:20.057]  And fight the tyranny ahead that's coming ahead by being knowledgeable.
[03:29:20.057 --> 03:29:26.583]  And they're going to start also more and more pitting us against other people.
[03:29:26.583 --> 03:29:30.887]  Like they've taught us how to hate the Iranians, how to hate Muslims.
[03:29:30.887 --> 03:29:33.549]  Beware of this kind of fear tactic.
[03:29:33.549 --> 03:29:36.411]  You know, the big lie works better than the little lie.
[03:29:36.411 --> 03:29:39.154]  So the big lie, watch out for that one.
[03:29:39.154 --> 03:29:42.857]  Hitler used the big lie, they're going to use the big lie once again.
[03:29:43.257 --> 03:29:44.899]  Gerald Cilente, great job.
[03:29:44.899 --> 03:29:46.000]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[03:29:46.000 --> 03:29:48.262]  We'll come back, take calls, blitz through some news.
[03:29:48.262 --> 03:29:49.162]  Stay with us.
[03:29:49.162 --> 03:29:51.885]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:29:51.885 --> 03:29:53.266]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.266 --> 03:29:54.887]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.887 --> 03:29:58.491]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.468 --> 03:30:06.775]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.775 --> 03:30:11.301]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:11.301 --> 03:30:13.584]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.584 --> 03:30:15.206]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:15.206 --> 03:30:16.248]  There is a solution.
[03:30:16.468 --> 03:30:24.892]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:30:24.892 --> 03:30:32.355]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[03:30:32.355 --> 03:30:38.017]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[03:30:38.377 --> 03:30:44.400]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[03:30:44.400 --> 03:30:48.563]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[03:31:03.050 --> 03:31:07.078]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:07.078 --> 03:31:10.325]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.325 --> 03:31:11.748]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:31:12.458 --> 03:31:15.480]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:15.480 --> 03:31:21.503]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.503 --> 03:31:27.066]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:27.066 --> 03:31:36.692]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.812 --> 03:31:39.153]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:39.153 --> 03:31:40.733]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.733 --> 03:31:43.194]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.194 --> 03:31:45.335]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.335 --> 03:31:50.456]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.456 --> 03:31:55.477]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:32:01.676 --> 03:32:05.197]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[03:32:05.197 --> 03:32:07.197]  Now, going green can save money.
[03:32:07.197 --> 03:32:12.758]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[03:32:12.758 --> 03:32:20.780]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[03:32:20.780 --> 03:32:30.062]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives.
[03:32:30.382 --> 03:32:33.583]  Increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.

[03:32:52.487 --> 03:32:52.868]  That's 208-772-4514.
[03:32:58.629 --> 03:33:11.538]  Okay, I want to go to your phone calls, but first I wanted to point out, look at these graphs here.
[03:33:11.538 --> 03:33:14.020]  That is the five-year gold graph.
[03:33:30.185 --> 03:33:31.985]  Five years ago, gold was $400 an ounce.
[03:33:31.985 --> 03:33:33.146]  And today, it is right at $1,060 an ounce.
[03:33:33.146 --> 03:33:39.587]  Look at the 10-year gold in the graph right next to it.
[03:33:39.587 --> 03:33:40.767]  Go back 10 years.
[03:33:40.767 --> 03:33:44.568]  10 years ago, it was 300 an ounce.
[03:33:44.568 --> 03:33:45.708]  Nine years ago, it was 290 an ounce.
[03:33:59.116 --> 03:34:01.138]  Eight years ago, it was 330 an ounce on average.
[03:34:01.138 --> 03:34:05.121]  Four years ago, it was 360 on average.
[03:34:05.121 --> 03:34:06.702]  Five years ago, it was 450 on average.
[03:34:06.702 --> 03:34:12.447]  Six years ago, and it goes up to a year and a half ago, it was 700.
[03:34:24.997 --> 03:34:28.620]  Then 800, then 900, then 1,000, and now 1,600.
[03:34:28.620 --> 03:34:34.445]  I mean, who can't look at that graph and go, hmm.
[03:34:34.445 --> 03:34:40.009]  And you try comparing that to the stock market, you try comparing that to anything else, and that's because they're killing the dollar right there.
[03:34:40.009 --> 03:34:43.812]  I haven't plugged gold in a couple days.
[03:34:43.812 --> 03:34:50.318]  I will tell you that Ted Anderson told me privately that unless gold plunges, which he isn't expecting to happen,
[03:34:52.742 --> 03:34:56.484]  The gold prices he has are going to be going up next week.
[03:34:56.484 --> 03:35:06.390]  Here are the offers I have for you from Midas Resources, our great gold sponsor, the place I get my precious metals.
[03:35:06.390 --> 03:35:11.793]  They have the British Sovereign gold coin at $293.
[03:35:11.793 --> 03:35:12.434]  They have the 20-franc
[03:35:18.996 --> 03:35:21.198]  Gold coin at $238.
[03:35:21.198 --> 03:35:24.500]  This is the price it was a month ago.
[03:35:24.500 --> 03:35:30.144]  They have the Lakota Silver at $22 apiece.
[03:35:30.144 --> 03:35:41.152]  And the even better deal is they have the Silver half dollars, the Walking Liberty half dollars at $8.69 apiece.
[03:35:41.152 --> 03:35:45.154]  You cannot find Silver anywhere at that price.
[03:35:45.154 --> 03:35:48.457]  This is absolute loss leader
[03:35:50.046 --> 03:35:52.187]  And I'll tell you, I've seen the markup on these gold coins.
[03:35:52.187 --> 03:35:54.747]  Take this $20 Franc gold coin.
[03:35:54.747 --> 03:36:00.289]  And again, this is Ted buying this months ago when gold was $100 less than it is right now.
[03:36:00.289 --> 03:36:06.471]  Even with the market buying gold, when the market was $100 lower, there was only about $4.5 of markup in that for Ted.
[03:36:09.127 --> 03:36:11.308]  That's the kind of deal you're getting, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:36:11.308 --> 03:36:12.689]  You cannot beat these deals.
[03:36:12.689 --> 03:36:13.970]  Give Midas Resources a call.
[03:36:13.970 --> 03:36:15.731]  The brokers are there until midnight tonight.
[03:36:15.731 --> 03:36:16.352]  800-686-2237.
[03:36:16.352 --> 03:36:21.075]  Quit procrastinating, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:36:21.075 --> 03:36:27.339]  Gold has now been above 150 for, what is it, two, three weeks longer?
[03:36:27.339 --> 03:36:30.181]  I mean, it's settled in at a new low of around 1,040.
[03:36:30.181 --> 03:36:32.423]  It's right up at 1,060 right now after the close.
[03:36:37.438 --> 03:36:40.539]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, be sure and check this out.
[03:36:40.539 --> 03:36:42.420]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to take advantage of this.
[03:36:42.420 --> 03:36:43.500]  You'll be paying the higher price.
[03:36:43.500 --> 03:36:44.400]  It's still a great deal.
[03:36:44.400 --> 03:36:45.301]  800-686-2237.
[03:36:45.301 --> 03:36:46.821]  800-686-2237.
[03:36:46.821 --> 03:36:50.903]  Try Modest Resources out.
[03:36:50.903 --> 03:36:58.685]  Go buy a couple gold coins, a little bag of silver coins, a roll of silver coins, whatever the case is.
[03:36:58.685 --> 03:37:00.006]  800-686-2237.
[03:37:00.006 --> 03:37:06.408]  And you look at that graph, for those that are watching this on the TV show, but anybody can just Google the five-year, ten-year gold graph or silver graph.
[03:37:07.452 --> 03:37:09.854]  They both behave almost exactly the same.
[03:37:09.854 --> 03:37:11.355]  Look at that!
[03:37:11.355 --> 03:37:22.163]  I mean, in the last seven years, we've seen a 340% increase in the price of gold.
[03:37:22.163 --> 03:37:27.207]  It's coming in on a quadrupling soon.
[03:37:27.207 --> 03:37:29.929]  But if you want to hold junk bonds and paper, be my guest.
[03:37:29.929 --> 03:37:30.029]  800-686-2237.
[03:37:30.029 --> 03:37:31.771]  Hellermitt's the Alex Jones Special.
[03:37:36.997 --> 03:37:38.539]  And I want to thank Midas Resources.
[03:37:38.539 --> 03:37:43.466]  Ted has been syndicating my radio show for 12 years now, and I couldn't have done it without Ted Anderson.
[03:37:43.466 --> 03:37:48.032]  He has stood behind me from the beginning, and as we expand, I want to thank him for his support.
[03:37:48.032 --> 03:37:48.672]  800-686-2237.
[03:37:48.672 --> 03:37:54.200]  In closing, I want to tell you about a few of the other sponsors that made today's show possible.
[03:37:55.333 --> 03:37:57.055]  Because we don't have big globalist funding here.
[03:37:57.055 --> 03:37:59.558]  You're funding us with these great sponsors that you support.
[03:37:59.558 --> 03:38:01.080]  New Silver Solution!
[03:38:01.080 --> 03:38:04.764]  People all over the world are discovering the benefits of Supernatural Silver.
[03:38:04.764 --> 03:38:09.749]  This powerful new nanotechnology is a natural antibiotic and preventative.

[03:38:13.173 --> 03:38:16.117]  Silver is one of the oldest natural antibiotics and is non-toxic.

[03:38:47.333 --> 03:38:50.535]  SupernaturalSilver, one word, SupernaturalSilver.com.
[03:38:50.535 --> 03:38:53.938]  Okay, let's get to these phone calls here.
[03:38:53.938 --> 03:38:57.700]  By the way, I gotta go to a funeral Sunday, but we're gonna have a great best of on the Sunday 4 to 6 show.
[03:38:59.900 --> 03:39:06.982]  Yeah, the question was actually for both of you guys because he was talking about the leadership that we're praising here in the United States today.
[03:39:06.982 --> 03:39:08.282]  The PPFA Margaret Sanger Award
[03:39:28.516 --> 03:39:35.404]  Was given to Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Ted Turner, Phil Donahue and the latest one to Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[03:39:35.404 --> 03:39:43.433]  Just wanted to refer to Dr. Martin Luther King, how he's being praised in the black community and a lot of people don't know this about him.
[03:39:43.433 --> 03:39:47.318]  And it refers to him as being an advocate for women's rights and family planning worldwide.
[03:39:48.146 --> 03:39:49.587]  I just wanted you to elaborate on that.
[03:40:06.394 --> 03:40:12.857]  But the issue is WDB Dubois and others, or EB Dubois, was hired by Sanger.
[03:40:12.857 --> 03:40:18.539]  She said, we gotta hire black fronts so they'll go sell these weeds on us being able to get rid of them.
[03:40:18.539 --> 03:40:20.700]  These are sickening quotes by her.
[03:40:20.700 --> 03:40:25.302]  And I know that he did support family planning and all of this because he was sold on it.
[03:40:25.302 --> 03:40:26.683]  I don't believe he was for it.
[03:40:28.083 --> 03:40:37.568]  But, I mean, I don't believe he really understood, but yes, certainly Ted Turner and others you mentioned are just sickening racist eugenicists.
[03:40:37.568 --> 03:40:45.192]  Right, and another thing is, I found this online, it's called Notice to Checkpoint Agents for all these illegal checkpoints that are out here.
[03:40:45.192 --> 03:40:48.374]  You could keep this paper in your car, I've done it myself.
[03:40:48.374 --> 03:40:50.735]  When I was in Arizona with a friend of mine, and
[03:40:52.492 --> 03:40:58.356]  They will stop you, and they will ask you for your citizenship, and you don't have to tell them anything because these are illegal checkpoints.
[03:40:58.356 --> 03:41:01.698]  And I presented them this paper, and I was in the passenger side.
[03:41:01.698 --> 03:41:09.183]  I actually gave it to my friend, and she rolled her window down just a little bit, gave them this paper, and they continued to harass her a little bit, but they let her go ahead and go about her way.
[03:41:09.183 --> 03:41:10.384]  So I just wanted to let people know.
[03:41:10.384 --> 03:41:11.345]  Yeah, I've seen those.
[03:41:11.345 --> 03:41:12.665]  I've seen those, and I appreciate your call.
[03:41:12.665 --> 03:41:14.346]  They are quite effective, because they mention the U.S.
[03:41:14.346 --> 03:41:18.569]  Code, and how false arrest, and getting in a lot of trouble, and how they're not allowed to violate your Fifth Amendment.
[03:41:21.442 --> 03:41:22.903]  They're talking about, in U.S.
[03:41:22.903 --> 03:41:30.169]  News & World Report, here it is, how OnStar is being used to turn people's cars off by the police.
[03:41:30.169 --> 03:41:32.811]  That was always the plan, I told you that a decade ago.
[03:41:32.811 --> 03:41:33.992]  Not because I'm smart.
[03:41:33.992 --> 03:41:37.856]  I read the FBI's own statements.
[03:41:37.856 --> 03:41:39.897]  Other cars have built-in kill switches in them.
[03:41:39.897 --> 03:41:41.759]  They're just now announcing this to the public.
[03:41:43.015 --> 03:41:45.936]  People say, oh, they can stop illegal aliens, they can stop criminals.
[03:41:45.936 --> 03:41:46.776]  Here's the deal.
[03:41:46.776 --> 03:41:47.937]  We can pull this up.
[03:41:47.937 --> 03:41:51.358]  I was in a bunch of newspapers a few months ago.
[03:41:51.358 --> 03:41:58.461]  When Homeland Security does four or five of these big raids on meatpacking plants and places to go, oh, look, we're busting illegal aliens.
[03:41:58.461 --> 03:42:00.902]  Over three million illegal aliens come in every year.
[03:42:00.902 --> 03:42:01.862]  Over a million legal.
[03:42:04.022 --> 03:42:09.404]  And they deport in these raids, five, six, seven thousand, in these big publicized raids.
[03:42:09.404 --> 03:42:14.146]  It's not even a drop in the bucket, more like a drop in the ocean.
[03:42:14.146 --> 03:42:17.307]  And these are stunts, and then they'll show, oh, we broke up this family.
[03:42:17.307 --> 03:42:20.929]  Oh, the kid got sent home with his parents even though he was a citizen.
[03:42:20.929 --> 03:42:24.470]  You know, they pull on everybody's heartstrings.
[03:42:24.470 --> 03:42:33.574]  But it came out in the news that Homeland Security takes almost all those people, takes them and expedites them getting a green card, and just, and that the government then gives them jobs.
[03:42:35.560 --> 03:42:36.901]  In fact, I forget the exact headline.
[03:42:36.901 --> 03:42:37.922]  It was in the Wall Street Journal.
[03:42:37.922 --> 03:42:44.666]  It was, uh... ICE GIVES ILLEGALS JOBS.
[03:42:44.666 --> 03:42:49.729]  They even gave them jobs building the fence that's all fake and couldn't even keep a person out, much less a deer.
[03:42:49.729 --> 03:42:52.952]  What was that exact headline?
[03:42:52.952 --> 03:42:56.934]  I've seen a bunch of them, but... But it was like, oh, look how nice they are!
[03:43:00.086 --> 03:43:06.369]  Maybe search this term, Homeland Security raids illegals, then gives them jobs.
[03:43:06.369 --> 03:43:08.249]  Or something like that.
[03:43:08.249 --> 03:43:09.510]  It's all staged.
[03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:14.652]  Like, they have in every major city now, police cars that have cameras that read all your license plates.
[03:43:14.652 --> 03:43:16.713]  They've had it for over a decade, but now it's going in everywhere.
[03:43:18.476 --> 03:43:20.637]  And they drive around and they see stolen cars.
[03:43:20.637 --> 03:43:21.957]  They don't stop them.
[03:43:21.957 --> 03:43:23.937]  Nine times out of ten.
[03:43:23.937 --> 03:43:25.478]  They drive by illegal aliens.
[03:43:25.478 --> 03:43:26.378]  They leave them alone.
[03:43:26.378 --> 03:43:27.438]  I've talked to Austin cops.
[03:43:27.438 --> 03:43:29.879]  They're told don't arrest illegals when they're drunk driving.
[03:43:29.879 --> 03:43:34.660]  Don't arrest illegals when they don't have their insurance or don't have their driver's license.
[03:43:34.660 --> 03:43:36.581]  But a citizen, they do.
[03:43:36.581 --> 03:43:40.862]  One night at the office, one of the IT guys, his license had been expired.
[03:43:40.862 --> 03:43:42.102]  He pulled into the office.
[03:43:42.102 --> 03:43:45.723]  The cop thought that was suspicious at night, how the cop was coming this way.
[03:43:46.403 --> 03:43:49.384]  And one of my, well he's actually a contractor, turned in.
[03:43:49.384 --> 03:43:53.686]  They thought that was suspicious, whipped in behind him and said, oh.
[03:43:53.686 --> 03:43:56.667]  And by then he'd gone in the office, they start banging on the door.
[03:43:56.667 --> 03:43:58.088]  He comes out and goes, what's the problem?
[03:43:58.088 --> 03:44:01.149]  They said, get out here.
[03:44:01.149 --> 03:44:05.451]  Get him outside and they say, oh, you were driving this, your license is expired.
[03:44:05.451 --> 03:44:12.734]  And so he called me once they were at the door and I was already coming to the office to meet him to do some work.
[03:44:13.797 --> 03:44:16.538]  It was like at eight o'clock at night, and I get here and there's three police cars.
[03:44:16.538 --> 03:44:21.740]  They kind of blow up when I first walk up, and it turns out two of the cops were big fans.
[03:44:21.740 --> 03:44:24.281]  And I said, you know, if he was an illegal alien, you wouldn't be arresting him.
[03:44:24.281 --> 03:44:25.042]  And he said, that's right.
[03:44:25.042 --> 03:44:28.023]  The judges get mad if we do that.
[03:44:28.023 --> 03:44:29.743]  We're encouraged not to.
[03:44:29.743 --> 03:44:31.484]  And there have been sheriffs all over the country.
[03:44:31.484 --> 03:44:38.987]  One big case in Tennessee where they would arrest whole 18 wheelers smuggling illegals, and ICE won't come pick them up.
[03:44:38.987 --> 03:44:39.707]  There it is.
[03:44:39.707 --> 03:44:43.409]  Homeland Security frees 27 illegal immigrants, then sends them back to work.
[03:44:44.670 --> 03:44:46.232]  That's Fox News.
[03:44:46.232 --> 03:44:47.693]  That was out of Seattle.
[03:44:47.693 --> 03:45:00.547]  The Department of Homeland Security for 27 illegal immigrants arrested during a workplace raid in February and offered them legal work permits, signing a major departure, sealing a major departure from the immigration enforcement policy.
[03:45:01.775 --> 03:45:03.537]  Of the Bush administration.
[03:45:03.537 --> 03:45:04.898]  And Bush did the same thing.
[03:45:04.898 --> 03:45:06.279]  Folks, I could pull up hundreds of these.
[03:45:06.279 --> 03:45:19.512]  I remember an AP article, maybe I can pull up the exact article from three years ago, and they said, we know the economy's getting bad, and so we're going to give illegals home loans with no evidence, no paperwork.
[03:45:19.512 --> 03:45:25.377]  And how they do it is, three major banks at the time, Wells Fargo was the first, Vicente Fox came here and gave them an award,
[03:45:26.298 --> 03:45:33.922]  In Austin, it's in Battle for the Republic, the 17-minute minifilm that's an extra on Endgame.
[03:45:33.922 --> 03:45:36.703]  I was going to put it in the film, but it didn't fit, so we just made it an extra.
[03:45:36.703 --> 03:45:38.944]  It's really informative.
[03:45:38.944 --> 03:45:50.630]  And Vicente Fox came and gave Wells Fargo, Warren Buffett, an award and gave the Austin Police Department an award for not following the law and arresting illegals.
[03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:54.452]  And Wells Fargo, well, the police got the award for not arresting illegals and leaving them alone.
[03:45:56.705 --> 03:45:59.306]  They got an award for being criminals!
[03:45:59.306 --> 03:46:04.949]  But they'll throw the book at you, the stupid dumb American milk cow, whether you're Hispanic, black, white, they don't care.
[03:46:04.949 --> 03:46:07.350]  You're the sucker, not the illegals.
[03:46:07.350 --> 03:46:10.792]  They're meant to drive down wages, bring down the country and the globalist system.
[03:46:10.792 --> 03:46:14.833]  That's in the CFR, Club of Rome's own documents.
[03:46:14.833 --> 03:46:19.095]  Professor Pasteur talks about it.
[03:46:19.095 --> 03:46:20.036]  He's an advocate of it.
[03:46:21.661 --> 03:46:21.841]  I think?
[03:46:42.878 --> 03:46:51.921]  Because Wells Fargo issues illegals, if they have a matricula, a Mexican consulate, Mexico makes their people have real IDs.
[03:46:51.921 --> 03:46:52.821]  But in the U.S.
[03:46:52.821 --> 03:47:00.184]  they issue, Austin has a consulate, it's called a mission, it's a smaller one, where they just issue for $24 a fake ID.
[03:47:00.184 --> 03:47:07.206]  You can go in and get three at the same time, and get three people on welfare, the same person under three names, and that's all sent, a lot of it sent to Mexico.
[03:47:09.520 --> 03:47:16.503]  Then if you have a consular matricula, Wells Fargo gives them a debit card and a bank account, and then with that they get a home loan.
[03:47:16.503 --> 03:47:23.506]  And AP had bank executives admitting they're doing this when citizens don't get this.
[03:47:23.506 --> 03:47:28.188]  You go into your bank, they want three forms of ID, thumbprints, you're scum, you're filth, you're trash.
[03:47:29.679 --> 03:47:32.241]  But if you're an illegal, you are God.
[03:47:32.241 --> 03:47:37.245]  So all the face scanning cameras, license plate readers, it's all for the American people.
[03:47:37.245 --> 03:47:39.266]  Homeland security's for the American people.
[03:47:39.266 --> 03:47:40.947]  Luke in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[03:47:40.947 --> 03:47:47.912]  Hi Alex, just first wanted to say I love your show and your movie is phenomenal.
[03:47:47.912 --> 03:47:55.338]  And I've been reading over the global climate treaty and I just find like a bunch of words are repeated and just things that aren't like
[03:47:55.953 --> 03:47:58.595]  Making sense to me, and I was wondering if you could clarify.
[03:47:58.595 --> 03:48:01.696]  Sure, I have the treaty, or parts of it, somewhere right here in front of me.
[03:48:01.696 --> 03:48:03.017]  Go ahead.
[03:48:03.017 --> 03:48:05.078]  Alright, well... Oh, there's Business Week!
[03:48:05.078 --> 03:48:07.800]  Embracing illegals!
[03:48:07.800 --> 03:48:09.041]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:48:09.041 --> 03:48:10.661]  Oh, yeah.
[03:48:10.661 --> 03:48:13.163]  The section of the R.E.D.D.
[03:48:13.163 --> 03:48:18.406]  system, with like capacity building, and it talks about like N.A.M.A.
[03:48:20.208 --> 03:48:25.351]  It's a thousand plus page treaty.
[03:48:25.351 --> 03:48:30.054]  I've only scanned over where it says government and calls for global governance.
[03:48:30.054 --> 03:48:32.315]  I'm trying to find some of the key sections.
[03:48:32.315 --> 03:48:35.417]  But yeah, it's just it's like NAFTA was a wheelbarrow.
[03:48:35.417 --> 03:48:38.678]  Tens of thousands of more than 14,000 pages long.
[03:48:38.678 --> 03:48:40.139]  It was not free or fair trade.
[03:48:40.139 --> 03:48:44.622]  It was a giant ripoff and tax exemptions for companies that leave the US.
[03:48:45.382 --> 03:48:54.030]  And this carbon thing is where all the big companies are exempt, all the middle size and small, and our homes, the bureaucrats are going to gang rape us financially.
[03:48:54.030 --> 03:48:56.092]  That's all it is.
[03:48:56.092 --> 03:49:00.215]  And what about NAMA?
[03:49:00.215 --> 03:49:01.397]  I don't have the treaty in front of me.
[03:49:01.397 --> 03:49:04.119]  Tell me about it.
[03:49:04.119 --> 03:49:06.141]  It's a bill that's incorporated into it.
[03:49:06.141 --> 03:49:08.823]  It's like a separate bill from the
[03:49:13.857 --> 03:49:19.962]  Sir, you're talking about an 1,100 page document.
[03:49:19.962 --> 03:49:22.023]  It's a bill.
[03:49:22.023 --> 03:49:26.287]  It's a proposal for a National Asset Management Agency bill within it.
[03:49:26.287 --> 03:49:31.030]  And it says they'll incorporate it as soon as the treaty is signed.
[03:49:31.030 --> 03:49:31.731]  Yes, yes.
[03:49:31.731 --> 03:49:38.376]  They're passing a flotilla of bills in Congress on carbon tax, on banking regulations.
[03:49:38.376 --> 03:49:39.577]  This is global government.
[03:49:39.577 --> 03:49:40.798]  In this set of treaties.
[03:49:42.285 --> 03:49:49.771]  The nation states are passing, this is what I've been saying all week, passing laws to get in line to plug into the global government.
[03:49:49.771 --> 03:50:02.100]  They're going to track everything you buy, sell, do, companies, the new banking regulations, you hear Obama calls it bailout 2, stimulus 2, that allows banks to regulate all private businesses.
[03:50:02.100 --> 03:50:06.563]  It's a total, it's global government, sir, they admit it.
[03:50:06.563 --> 03:50:09.646]  Yeah, it's just, they're showing it now, that's exactly what this bill says they want to do.
[03:50:10.680 --> 03:50:13.341]  Well, listen, I can't read the whole thing and do everything I'm doing.
[03:50:13.341 --> 03:50:14.362]  We've had guests on about it.
[03:50:14.362 --> 03:50:15.702]  I've scanned over it.
[03:50:15.702 --> 03:50:17.263]  Every page is a nightmare.
[03:50:17.263 --> 03:50:19.084]  Folks, do your own analysis.
[03:50:19.084 --> 03:50:20.084]  Break it down.
[03:50:20.084 --> 03:50:21.405]  Write articles for it.
[03:50:21.405 --> 03:50:27.247]  Send it to writers at Infowars.com or Kurt at Infowars.com or Aaron at Infowars.com.
[03:50:27.247 --> 03:50:28.188]  We're posting more and more.
[03:50:28.928 --> 03:50:30.689]  That's... I'm just scared because they just...
[03:50:51.141 --> 03:50:53.443]  They're just showing us now what they want to do and what they're going to do.
[03:50:53.443 --> 03:50:53.623]  I know!
[03:50:53.623 --> 03:50:56.105]  Sir, you can Google New World Order.
[03:50:56.105 --> 03:50:59.167]  Thousands of mainstream news articles admitting exactly what it is.
[03:51:02.074 --> 03:51:03.836]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:51:03.836 --> 03:51:05.338]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:51:05.338 --> 03:51:06.679]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:51:06.679 --> 03:51:08.621]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:51:08.621 --> 03:51:17.410]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:51:17.410 --> 03:51:22.676]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:51:22.816 --> 03:51:24.618]  Why risk government vaccinations?

[03:52:07.058 --> 03:52:10.305]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.305 --> 03:52:11.707]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:12.426 --> 03:52:15.087]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.087 --> 03:52:21.469]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:26.671]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.671 --> 03:52:36.655]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.775 --> 03:52:39.116]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.116 --> 03:52:40.716]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.716 --> 03:52:43.157]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.157 --> 03:52:45.298]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.298 --> 03:52:50.440]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:53:57.114 --> 03:53:58.055]  You're gonna love them.
[03:53:58.055 --> 03:54:05.322]  You will never use anything else again.
[03:54:05.322 --> 03:54:13.089]  Folks, be part of history.
[03:54:13.089 --> 03:54:17.354]  The enemy is taking over, but it's all fraudulent and openly criminal.
[03:54:18.680 --> 03:54:21.582]  But they said, hey, we're going to put deadly poison called fluoride in your water.
[03:54:21.582 --> 03:54:22.262]  It's good for you.
[03:54:22.262 --> 03:54:23.343]  Shut up and drink it.
[03:54:23.343 --> 03:54:25.544]  Oh, but all the studies say it kills me and gives me cancer.
[03:54:25.544 --> 03:54:26.465]  We don't care.
[03:54:26.465 --> 03:54:26.845]  Shut up.
[03:54:26.845 --> 03:54:28.246]  We have police.
[03:54:28.246 --> 03:54:31.908]  Hey, you don't arrest illegals, but you arrest me for the same thing.
[03:54:31.908 --> 03:54:32.368]  Shut up.
[03:54:32.368 --> 03:54:33.809]  That's right, scum.
[03:54:33.809 --> 03:54:35.630]  Pay my paycheck.
[03:54:35.630 --> 03:54:37.391]  Oh, offshore banks are taking over.
[03:54:37.391 --> 03:54:38.071]  That's criminal.
[03:54:38.071 --> 03:54:38.712]  That's right.
[03:54:38.712 --> 03:54:39.632]  Shut up.
[03:54:39.632 --> 03:54:42.234]  We'll stage a terror attack and blame it on you and arrest your ass.
[03:54:44.315 --> 03:54:45.837]  That's how these people roll.
[03:54:45.837 --> 03:54:47.019]  That's how they're operating.
[03:54:47.019 --> 03:54:48.341]  That's what they're doing!
[03:54:48.341 --> 03:54:54.028]  And we've got to get mad with the truth and get it out to people.
[03:54:54.028 --> 03:54:56.572]  We have to get angry and then take the truth and get it out there.
[03:54:56.572 --> 03:54:58.875]  And that's what Fall of the Republic does.
[03:54:58.875 --> 03:55:00.858]  I busted my hind tail.
[03:55:02.745 --> 03:55:05.127]  On this, this sucker is good.
[03:55:05.127 --> 03:55:06.908]  This baby will wake people up.
[03:55:06.908 --> 03:55:08.429]  This has got the facts.
[03:55:08.429 --> 03:55:10.891]  And anybody that wants to know the truth can learn it.
[03:55:10.891 --> 03:55:17.075]  They can pack their lies and slick media and disinfo on people, but that's got to be reapplied, reapplied.
[03:55:17.075 --> 03:55:21.118]  Somebody finds out the truth one time, their life is changed.
[03:55:21.118 --> 03:55:22.479]  That's the secret about the truth.
[03:55:24.085 --> 03:55:26.547]  One grain of truth can smash a mountain of lies.
[03:55:26.547 --> 03:55:28.429]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:55:28.429 --> 03:55:29.650]  Do not wait.
[03:55:29.650 --> 03:55:30.310]  Order it now.
[03:55:30.310 --> 03:55:31.331]  It's the best way to get it out.
[03:55:31.331 --> 03:55:33.073]  People make copies of it.
[03:55:33.073 --> 03:55:35.034]  Or watch it on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:55:35.034 --> 03:55:35.695]  Download it.
[03:55:35.695 --> 03:55:36.395]  Burn it to disk.
[03:55:36.395 --> 03:55:37.316]  It's so easy.
[03:55:37.316 --> 03:55:38.657]  With the DivX version up there.
[03:55:38.657 --> 03:55:39.498]  Get it out to everybody.
[03:55:39.498 --> 03:55:41.239]  I know people are going wild with it.
[03:55:41.239 --> 03:55:41.980]  I want to commend you.
[03:55:41.980 --> 03:55:43.341]  I want to thank you.
[03:55:43.341 --> 03:55:44.362]  Gabby in Florida.
[03:55:44.362 --> 03:55:44.923]  You're on the air.
[03:55:44.923 --> 03:55:46.504]  And then we'll talk to Captain Truth at least.
[03:55:46.504 --> 03:55:48.085]  Go ahead, Gabby.
[03:55:48.085 --> 03:55:49.006]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[03:55:49.006 --> 03:55:49.847]  How are you?
[03:55:49.847 --> 03:55:50.087]  Good.
[03:55:51.209 --> 03:55:54.390]  I have two quick questions for you.
[03:55:54.390 --> 03:56:00.851]  I have a newborn baby that's two months, and they asked me to take some shots for her.
[03:56:00.851 --> 03:56:02.591]  What do you think about that?
[03:56:02.591 --> 03:56:08.032]  Well, you make your own medical decision, but they want you to take the hepatitis shot, correct?
[03:56:08.032 --> 03:56:12.113]  The hepatitis, the polio, and the DTP shot?
[03:56:12.113 --> 03:56:12.833]  Okay.
[03:56:12.833 --> 03:56:18.374]  Japan, it's illegal to give somebody under two shots in Japan, because they actually care a little bit about their people.
[03:56:19.232 --> 03:56:22.074]  Your child isn't going to be injecting heroin or cocaine.
[03:56:22.074 --> 03:56:24.315]  Your child isn't going to be having sex.
[03:56:24.315 --> 03:56:28.958]  The hepatitis is one of the most deadly vaccines on record.
[03:56:28.958 --> 03:56:31.960]  And I would just make that decision for yourself.
[03:56:31.960 --> 03:56:34.061]  They're not trying to make you give it to her, are they?
[03:56:34.061 --> 03:56:35.622]  No, no, no.
[03:56:35.622 --> 03:56:38.184]  They said that if you want to, yeah.
[03:56:38.184 --> 03:56:41.706]  But at first, the doctor was like, oh, you know, she has to take them.
[03:56:41.706 --> 03:56:42.406]  She has to take them.
[03:56:43.680 --> 03:56:44.520]  Yeah, yeah, they lie.
[03:56:44.520 --> 03:56:47.301]  Color of Law is hardcore criminal sicko filth.
[03:56:47.301 --> 03:56:50.862]  Again, even if you think shots are good, they shouldn't lie and say you have to.
[03:56:50.862 --> 03:56:54.323]  Then you showed Backbone and they backed off and said, I got one that can see.
[03:56:54.323 --> 03:56:57.464]  I got a slave that's aware.
[03:56:57.464 --> 03:56:58.805]  Ma'am, you do what you want.
[03:56:58.805 --> 03:57:03.526]  My three children have never had an injection in their life.
[03:57:03.526 --> 03:57:04.806]  Oh, wow, that's great.
[03:57:04.806 --> 03:57:06.907]  I have one more question, Alex.
[03:57:06.907 --> 03:57:10.908]  My husband is a deep listener of you and he's planning on joining the National Guard.
[03:57:10.908 --> 03:57:12.749]  What do you think about that?
[03:57:14.147 --> 03:57:14.868]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[03:57:14.868 --> 03:57:16.469]  It's an honor and a privilege to be on your show.
[03:57:16.469 --> 03:57:18.631]  You and Aaron Russo probably saved my life.
[03:57:41.598 --> 03:58:00.014]  Well, the way I did the DVDs is I asked for, and you can tell me if I'm wrong, I asked for a deposit and offered to refund it if they brought the DVD back to me, but I just had to have some reproduction money to make more DVDs.
[03:58:00.014 --> 03:58:04.858]  If I'd have made anything, and if I ever did, I guess... That's not the issue, sir.
[03:58:04.858 --> 03:58:08.522]  I can't tell people they can sell them, or they will take it away from me.
[03:58:10.086 --> 03:58:14.127]  Copyright it and say it's their work and I can't sell it.
[03:58:14.127 --> 03:58:16.347]  And we've had people actually try that.
[03:58:16.347 --> 03:58:17.167]  So just whatever.
[03:58:17.167 --> 03:58:18.847]  I don't want to hear about what you're doing.
[03:58:18.847 --> 03:58:21.168]  Just get the DVDs out to people.
[03:58:21.168 --> 03:58:24.008]  That's the whole issue.
[03:58:24.008 --> 03:58:29.229]  My God, a DivX is like 25 cents for the CD and you can put the film on it.
[03:58:29.229 --> 03:58:30.730]  So whatever.
[03:58:30.730 --> 03:58:31.410]  Great job.
[03:58:31.410 --> 03:58:32.890]  Keep it up.
[03:58:32.890 --> 03:58:36.050]  I got people calling me every day saying, can I put it on AXS TV?
[03:58:36.050 --> 03:58:39.231]  The film says copy and distribute on the back.
[03:58:43.223 --> 03:58:46.624]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.624 --> 03:58:51.226]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.226 --> 03:58:54.627]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.627 --> 03:58:58.248]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.248 --> 03:59:02.810]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.810 --> 03:59:08.412]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.692 --> 03:59:13.476]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.476 --> 03:59:17.098]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.098 --> 03:59:21.922]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:21.922 --> 03:59:28.486]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.486 --> 03:59:30.428]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:30.908 --> 03:59:34.110]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[03:59:34.110 --> 03:59:38.613]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[03:59:38.613 --> 03:59:40.394]  That's MySolarBackup.com.

[03:59:40.715 --> 03:59:41.395]  Don't wait.
[03:59:41.395 --> 03:59:41.895]  Call today.
[03:59:41.895 --> 03:59:42.476]  Coast to Coast.
[03:59:42.476 --> 03:59:43.196]  Direct from Austin.
[03:59:43.196 --> 03:59:46.398]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
