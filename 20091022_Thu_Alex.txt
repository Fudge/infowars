[09:29.160 --> 09:41.280]  society there can no longer be any wiggle room for procrastinating and
[09:41.280 --> 09:47.120]  rationalizing what's going on in this nation and worldwide we do have a
[09:47.120 --> 09:53.640]  private consortium of corporations engaging in planetary piracy against
[09:53.640 --> 09:59.160]  free populations and the main conduit of robbery and oppression that's being used
[09:59.160 --> 10:08.480]  the main tool is government world government is upon us the republic for
[10:08.480 --> 10:14.280]  all intents and purposes is dead now we can anytime we want stand up as a
[10:14.280 --> 10:19.920]  society and take our nation our world back but we have to face just how dire
[10:19.920 --> 10:25.680]  the situation is and admit to ourselves just how intellectually bankrupt and
[10:25.680 --> 10:30.880]  thoroughly corrupt the government and corporations that have grown up around it
[10:30.880 --> 10:46.360]  are and until we admit that to ourselves until we face those facts we are
[10:46.360 --> 10:49.560]  only going to lose more liberty we are only going to see our standard of
[10:49.560 --> 10:56.960]  living dropping rapidly if we can't identify the the the the pirates that
[10:56.960 --> 11:02.040]  are stealing from us and robbing from us and erecting more and more government
[11:02.040 --> 11:07.760]  systems so that they can steal more and more of our wealth our time our energy
[11:07.760 --> 11:13.040]  then society is only going to continue to degenerate the United States is
[11:13.040 --> 11:18.560]  becoming a failed state vice president Joe Biden's in the news today saying for
[11:18.560 --> 11:24.240]  many Americans this is a depression this is a jobless recovery the only reason
[11:24.240 --> 11:27.760]  the media saying runner recovery is because the private banks the private
[11:27.760 --> 11:33.040]  offshore corporations are making record profits and the police in the military
[11:33.040 --> 11:38.160]  who are the enforcers for this private corporate takeover need to face the fact
[11:38.160 --> 11:43.280]  and look in the mirror and look at the evidence and realize that the republic
[11:43.280 --> 11:49.080]  and all the liberties and freedoms for which it stands are being decimated are
[11:49.080 --> 11:55.080]  being destroyed are being annihilated are being abolished and demolished and
[11:55.080 --> 12:00.680]  ruined in front of all of us and you have to make the conscious decision are
[12:00.680 --> 12:05.400]  you going to do something about the fact that our republic is being dismantled
[12:05.400 --> 12:09.560]  before our very eyes you need to make the conscious decision is this what you
[12:09.560 --> 12:14.680]  want in your own personal life is this the country you want to live in do you
[12:14.680 --> 12:20.520]  want your children and grandchildren and their progeny to live in a very very
[12:20.520 --> 12:27.280]  serious high-tech scientific dictatorship there is a world government it is
[12:27.280 --> 12:35.520]  fraudulent and illegitimate and tyrannical it is criminal the establishment
[12:35.520 --> 12:39.240]  for decades conditioned the public that there's no government conspiracies and
[12:39.240 --> 12:43.480]  no corporate conspiracies and no forms of corruption and anybody that doesn't
[12:43.480 --> 12:46.160]  trust the government's a kook and anybody that doesn't go along with the
[12:46.160 --> 12:50.880]  system is an extremist or a terrorist they did that to precondition the
[12:50.880 --> 12:57.600]  population to lower our national immune system to the disease of corruption so
[12:57.600 --> 13:02.440]  that people would think it was fashionable and cool to not be involved
[13:02.440 --> 13:13.040]  in their society that people think it's fashionable and cool to give up and to
[13:13.040 --> 13:19.360]  have an attitude of there's nothing we can do they have sold the idea that
[13:19.360 --> 13:24.200]  being cynical and not caring is the response you're supposed to have to a
[13:24.200 --> 13:31.160]  corrupt society no that only lets the corrupt thieves get more control the
[13:31.160 --> 13:35.040]  level of tyranny we're going to live under as Thomas Jefferson said is the
[13:35.040 --> 13:39.920]  exact level we're going to put up with if you think the corrupt oligarchs we
[13:39.920 --> 13:44.200]  have in place today are bad if we just give into them they will be replaced
[13:44.200 --> 13:51.440]  with even more vicious more cunning more abusive more manipulative and more
[13:51.440 --> 13:57.520]  sadistic individuals and they in turn will be replaced with even more corrupt
[13:57.520 --> 14:02.920]  and evil and vicious people we know what human history is we know what
[14:02.920 --> 14:08.680]  happens when society is given to corruption incredible degradation and
[14:08.680 --> 14:15.680]  taxes and regulation and control and enslavement ensues every single time
[14:15.680 --> 14:21.480]  it's like if you pour gasoline all over your house in the kitchen in the living
[14:21.480 --> 14:25.200]  room in your bedrooms in the bathrooms on the front porch on the roof in the
[14:25.200 --> 14:29.720]  attic and then you go in with a flamethrower and ignite it you know
[14:29.720 --> 14:35.000]  what's going to happen the house is going to burst into flames and that's all
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.840]  that's happening here our nation our republic is on fire it is burning to
[14:40.840 --> 14:47.360]  the ground but anytime we want to wake up get focused get aggressive get serious
[14:47.360 --> 14:51.320]  and start addressing the real shadow government the national security
[14:51.320 --> 14:59.320]  council that connects into the private central banks anytime we identify these
[14:59.320 --> 15:06.640]  can lay skilling made-off tight criminals for what they are the Ben Bernanke's of
[15:06.640 --> 15:12.640]  the world the Rothschilds the Rockefellers the 20 or less big mafia
[15:12.640 --> 15:16.960]  families that run the West and are trying to use our energy our military
[15:16.960 --> 15:23.160]  our taxes to fund their planetary takeover the minute we realize who the
[15:23.160 --> 15:28.120]  real enemy is and identify these people and pass the word through films and
[15:28.120 --> 15:33.480]  radio shows and pamphlets and books and calls into mainstream talk radio and
[15:33.480 --> 15:38.920]  access TV shows and speeches before the county commissioners and tea parties and
[15:38.920 --> 15:44.680]  lawsuits and grand juries and guiding these people once we get that idea in
[15:44.680 --> 15:50.080]  our minds and trumpet that broadcast that and ignore the propaganda the
[15:50.080 --> 15:54.840]  disinfo the infighting the co-intel pro that the system uses to divide us
[15:54.840 --> 15:58.440]  against each other the minute we figure out the game and it's really pretty
[15:58.440 --> 16:06.680]  simple is the minute the new world order starts falling it is that simple now
[16:06.680 --> 16:09.560]  I'm gonna go to your calls and then I'm gonna blitz through news throughout the
[16:09.560 --> 16:13.080]  broadcast here are some of the type of headlines I have Biden it's a depression

[18:14.440 --> 18:22.120]  a matrix for corruption at every level it's a fact Democrats locked
[18:22.120 --> 18:26.920]  Republicans out of committee room in the government house oversight reform
[18:26.920 --> 18:32.320]  committee so that the Republicans can't find out what's going on incredible
[18:32.320 --> 18:36.400]  corruption I mean that the House and Senate are just more and more corrupt
[18:36.400 --> 18:39.680]  every day the types of things they're doing not letting anybody read the
[18:39.680 --> 18:43.600]  bills when Obama swore he would make sure there was five days for everyone to
[18:43.600 --> 18:46.800]  read the bills now he lobbies that no one be able to read the stinking bills
[18:46.800 --> 18:52.720]  I mean they've got five different bills and they won't give the public or even
[18:52.720 --> 18:57.560]  members of Congress most the subsections I mean I was thinking last
[18:57.560 --> 19:04.080]  night about food and drug administration dot gov and the hundreds of pages they
[19:04.080 --> 19:07.520]  have about how the flu shot can give you neurological disorders can kill you
[19:07.520 --> 19:15.840]  seizures Gillian beret cancer sterilization mercury and then I was
[19:15.840 --> 19:18.920]  reading Paul Watson's article that had a link to the New York Times saying it's
[19:18.920 --> 19:22.560]  all a myth and they have fact sheets that are given to school children all over
[19:22.560 --> 19:26.640]  the country telling them that none of that's true I mean just the level of
[19:26.640 --> 19:32.760]  corruption and illegitimacy is mind-blowing and police and military
[19:32.760 --> 19:37.720]  and bureaucrats you're going to be asked to carry out all of this criminality
[19:37.720 --> 19:42.200]  against the people you better make a decision who's side you're on and don't

[20:05.160 --> 20:08.840]  by the owners of ready reserve foods Inc it is generally not the place for a

[20:12.600 --> 20:15.880]  it has become very obvious that our government is completely out of control
[20:15.880 --> 20:19.720]  and has decoupled from any constraints placed on it by the Constitution it is
[20:19.720 --> 20:23.160]  also obvious that they are racing at breakneck speeds to place our once
[20:23.160 --> 20:26.920]  sovereign nation under the control of a global socialist government these
[20:26.920 --> 20:30.080]  treasonous leaders and we use the term treasonous because their action
[20:30.080 --> 20:33.960]  and behavior can easily be regarded as treason have over time systematically
[20:33.960 --> 20:39.200]  destroyed our culture our industries and now the US dollar this is our country
[20:39.200 --> 20:44.120]  and they the leaders have sold us to the globalists the future for America and

[21:11.840 --> 21:16.040]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line is this a flaw free
[21:16.040 --> 21:19.600]  enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing

[24:39.840 --> 24:48.600]  here in New Jersey okay what happened is they supposedly arrested a man
[24:48.600 --> 24:55.200]  yesterday for making terroristic threats about the president he's a 55 year
[24:55.200 --> 25:01.600]  old private security guard in New Jersey he's supposed to be a rain today and now
[25:01.600 --> 25:08.480]  I don't know if you're aware of this what did they say he did they said he made
[25:08.480 --> 25:14.040]  terroristic threats they searched his home they found 40 weapons they say but
[25:14.040 --> 25:20.160]  they're all legal he's supposed to be a rain today he's a 55 year old private
[25:20.160 --> 25:26.360]  security guard he might have said something on a message border website or
[25:26.360 --> 25:32.920]  email he a fellow employee overheard him making some kind of threat towards the
[25:32.920 --> 25:37.640]  president they arrested him this is breaking news as we speak and I don't
[25:37.640 --> 25:41.760]  know if it's being broadcast nationwide but it just happened here he's supposed
[25:41.760 --> 25:47.920]  to be a rain today it's something to look into all right thank you I appreciate
[25:47.920 --> 25:58.680]  the call Steve I do know that we have a Fox News report a local Fox News report
[25:58.680 --> 26:07.040]  and they report on it like it might be reasonable this guy has a tiny house
[26:07.040 --> 26:15.440]  off the road with little bitty windows with curtains and it was 5 30 a.m. and he
[26:15.440 --> 26:29.440]  came down naked to make some coffee and I'll be quite frank sometimes I've well
[26:29.440 --> 26:38.680]  at least when I was a bachelor I would do things like that and the new the TV
[26:38.680 --> 26:43.360]  news went and showed the window that the woman and her son at 5 30 a.m. they
[26:43.360 --> 26:52.240]  admitted were in his yard cutting through his yard through an alley and it showed
[26:52.240 --> 26:57.240]  where he made the coffee and the police came to his house and arrested him for
[26:57.240 --> 27:15.200]  indecent exposure a few years ago I saw the statistics hold on just a minute
[27:15.200 --> 27:28.600]  add a bunch of people come into the office come into the studio I can't wait
[27:28.600 --> 27:31.800]  till I build the other studio we didn't build this one right and it's right in
[27:31.800 --> 27:34.880]  the middle of the office and there's just circuses going on constantly out the
[27:34.880 --> 27:38.720]  window and in the room next to me and we didn't sound perfect right and now so I
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.040]  don't go deaf I'm not wearing headphones I'm wearing an earpiece and so I hear
[27:43.040 --> 27:49.360]  everything people are saying when they're loud right into my ear and then I
[27:49.360 --> 27:52.960]  guess I've just got to train myself to be able to operate and be able to do this
[27:52.960 --> 27:58.400]  show but I designed this and I just designed it wrong
[28:01.720 --> 28:10.360]  oh it's pointless I was listening to the news yesterday and they were reporting
[28:10.360 --> 28:18.280]  that they may pass laws making an illegal to not just text while you drive and
[28:18.280 --> 28:26.280]  that sounds reasonable but not to drink coffee or eat while you're driving and
[28:26.280 --> 28:29.280]  then I constantly read about people being arrested because their neighbor
[28:29.280 --> 28:35.560]  sees them loading a gun into their trunk and thinks that guns are illegal so they
[28:35.560 --> 28:39.640]  call the police and the police still go ahead and come out and arrest them for
[28:39.640 --> 28:48.960]  no reason and I see these reports where they're just arresting people for
[28:48.960 --> 28:54.960]  absolutely no reason now I see reports constantly where people will have
[28:54.960 --> 28:59.200]  surveillance cameras on their own house and the police will come out to their
[28:59.200 --> 29:04.480]  home beat them up or arrest them and then they will use the video camera try to
[29:04.480 --> 29:09.240]  use it in court to show that the police are lying on the police report and then
[29:09.240 --> 29:14.200]  police come back to the house and arrest them and charge them for eavesdropping
[29:14.200 --> 29:18.360]  saying that it violated the police privacy when clearly there is no
[29:18.360 --> 29:33.160]  reasonable expectation of privacy for the police when they are at your house or
[29:33.160 --> 29:38.160]  when they're out on the street and I see reports where the police will pull
[29:38.160 --> 29:42.000]  somebody over the people have a camera on them the police are videotaping them
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.600]  from the squad car and the cops arrest them for that and they always lose in
[29:45.600 --> 29:51.480]  court but still it just shows they're ready to carry out tyranny we're on the
[29:51.480 --> 30:00.680]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the illusion
[30:00.680 --> 30:05.120]  created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to

[33:33.120 --> 33:39.680]  to tax you to find you to feed you the number one characteristic of a tyranny
[33:39.680 --> 33:44.240]  and it's not just Alex Jones saying this it's it's what historians it's what
[33:44.240 --> 33:50.040]  anthropologists it's what sociologists it's what people who research societies
[33:50.040 --> 33:54.120]  always throughout history have made this point including the founding fathers
[33:54.120 --> 33:59.440]  Greek philosophers the list goes on and on the number one characteristic of a
[33:59.440 --> 34:05.600]  tyranny is that it makes the general public criminals it makes normal
[34:05.600 --> 34:13.400]  activity criminal show that the state has a pretext and an excuse to come in and
[34:13.400 --> 34:16.960]  take control of your life and ultimately make you a slave and extract your
[34:16.960 --> 34:22.720]  labor it's very very simple governments 99% of the time make their population
[34:22.720 --> 34:29.200]  slaves to a tiny oligarchy to a tiny elite and somehow in America in the
[34:29.200 --> 34:37.800]  last 50 years the media and the culture made it a conspiracy theory made it and
[34:37.800 --> 34:44.400]  conspiracy theory to question the government to question corruption to
[34:44.400 --> 34:48.960]  even say that corruption could exist in government became a conspiracy theory
[34:48.960 --> 34:59.600]  until now we have a government that attacks Iran using Sunnis and then says
[34:59.600 --> 35:07.400]  that Iran is Sunni based Al Qaeda up as down down as up we have a media and a
[35:07.400 --> 35:11.560]  government that says there is no mercury there are no side effects with the
[35:11.560 --> 35:17.680]  flu shot when the insert lists them all I mean and I keep going back over that
[35:17.680 --> 35:23.600]  because there's so many lies almost everything is 180 degrees from what the
[35:23.600 --> 35:27.880]  public's told people are told the insurance companies don't want the
[35:27.880 --> 35:32.160]  government health care and they're greedy and bad and and they're trying to
[35:32.160 --> 35:36.040]  stop it when they're the ones that have written it and their own lobbyists have
[35:36.040 --> 35:40.080]  stated this on record they want to force you to go get health care from them and
[35:40.080 --> 35:43.600]  get insurance from them and then they get government liability protection to
[35:43.600 --> 35:48.880]  lower the quality of care and the government lies about WMD's the
[35:48.880 --> 35:53.040]  government I saw the Attorney General up on television right before I went on
[35:53.040 --> 35:58.080]  air giving a live press conference about a giant drug bust give me a break they
[35:58.080 --> 36:03.400]  always bust some mid-level cowboy who didn't launder his cocaine heroin
[36:03.400 --> 36:09.200]  methamphetamine ecstasy whatever drug he's selling money with the right bank and
[36:09.200 --> 36:16.800]  so he's busted when on record the CIA's been caught hundreds of times shipping
[36:16.800 --> 36:23.760]  and cocaine and heroin congressional reports the 1996 CIA solicitor general
[36:23.760 --> 36:29.720]  I've got it on video off C-span admitting the CIA brought in the cocaine for the
[36:29.720 --> 36:35.560]  crack epidemic no the public thinks that's a rumor because they never looked
[36:35.560 --> 36:39.360]  at the documents or the testimony just like the public still thinks it's a
[36:39.360 --> 36:43.840]  rumor that the Gulf of Tonkin attack on our ships was staged no it's now been
[36:43.840 --> 36:50.200]  declassified you just haven't gone and looked it up all right I said I'm gonna
[36:50.200 --> 36:57.560]  take your calls it just goes on and on and on and on the lying the stealing the
[36:57.560 --> 37:02.520]  cheating here in Austin they're about to pass tens of millions of dollars of
[37:02.520 --> 37:08.440]  funding in fact I had that in my stack guys and I didn't bring it just just
[37:08.440 --> 37:16.440]  search engine the term government government paid for city funded
[37:16.440 --> 37:19.960]  abortions county funded abortions Austin it's a big deal right now with
[37:19.960 --> 37:25.640]  locals and it should be I mean if you're for abortion and you're for
[37:25.640 --> 37:32.960]  dehumanizing human life to that point it's a horrible thing but but you
[37:32.960 --> 37:37.440]  certainly shouldn't be able to argue that other people have to pay for it and
[37:37.440 --> 37:42.200]  they've got federal and state laws where girls as young as 10 don't have to
[37:42.200 --> 37:45.680]  tell their parents when they have an abortion but they but they've got to get
[37:45.680 --> 37:49.880]  a note until they're 17 in high school to be allowed to go on a field trip to
[37:49.880 --> 37:55.040]  the planetarium or the zoo or to SeaWorld you got to get a money's note to
[37:55.040 --> 38:00.840]  go to SeaWorld but you don't need mommy or daddy's permission when you're 10 to
[38:00.840 --> 38:07.560]  go have some filthy abortion where he killed a baby my god that's what I mean
[38:07.560 --> 38:13.640]  everything is turned up on upside down and the news is just pouring in how
[38:13.640 --> 38:17.960]  they're making everything criminal everything a crime they're arresting
[38:17.960 --> 38:22.760]  people every day for things that aren't even crimes I've seen three different
[38:22.760 --> 38:28.520]  cases I know of of my listeners being arrested for handing out my films to
[38:28.520 --> 38:34.800]  police the most famous case that made the newspapers was Kelly rushing Lyon
[38:34.800 --> 38:39.680]  County Kentucky family been there since the founding of the county well-known
[38:39.680 --> 38:44.560]  family upstanding member of society no criminal record he gets road to tyranny
[38:44.560 --> 38:48.920]  and a Ron Paul speech he puts Ron Paul at the front and wrote a tyranny on the
[38:48.920 --> 38:55.520]  second part of the VHS tape is like six years ago Ron Paul's neocon speech he
[38:55.520 --> 38:59.640]  gives it to a local state police officer three days later the guy pulls him
[38:59.640 --> 39:04.160]  over when he leaves his house laughs to his wife on his cell phone and says I
[39:04.160 --> 39:11.200]  just arrested the VHS bandit and says that videos anti-law enforcement and he
[39:11.200 --> 39:16.320]  was charged for the Ron Paul video and he was charged for road to tyranny and I
[39:16.320 --> 39:21.120]  called the judge up at home with it on speaker with my wife as a witness because
[39:21.120 --> 39:24.200]  I don't want that judge making something up but also wasn't going to record the
[39:24.200 --> 39:30.240]  judge because of wiretapping laws in many states and I said hello and it was
[39:30.240 --> 39:33.000]  the judge I called information he goes yes I go where do you have Kelly rushing
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.440]  next week in a terroristic threat trial I go that's in the newspaper you're
[39:38.440 --> 39:44.360]  really gonna have this trial I'm you know I'm I'm with the news media and I'm
[39:44.360 --> 39:46.680]  Alex Jones he was I know who you are and I said you're going ahead with this
[39:46.680 --> 39:51.800]  trial and he said yes and they they seated the jury and they came in and
[39:51.800 --> 39:56.920]  wanted to give him three years for each counts consecutive six years in the state
[39:56.920 --> 40:01.880]  pen for giving them a video they said the video was a threat to I mean how
[40:01.880 --> 40:07.160]  warped is that state police officer's brain how crazy is that lunatic how an
[40:07.160 --> 40:11.920]  American is that person to think that you can't give somebody a videotape of a
[40:11.920 --> 40:16.520]  congressman given a speech in America or road to tyranny that doesn't call for
[40:16.520 --> 40:20.560]  any violence it reaches out to police and ask them to wake up and follow the
[40:20.560 --> 40:24.160]  bill of rights it shows their internal training manuals where they were listing
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.800]  gun owners and conservatives as terrorists oh yeah back when I put out
[40:28.800 --> 40:33.360]  films like road to tyranny in 2002 I couldn't get national attention we've
[40:33.360 --> 40:39.240]  broken hundreds of those documents over the years and it was funny to that cop
[40:39.240 --> 40:44.560]  to that to that to that Kentucky State police officer Kelly rushing wasn't a
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.360]  human being he didn't have a life it was funny trying to put him in prison for
[40:48.360 --> 40:53.440]  six years it was a big joke to him and his wife it was fun he went in and
[40:53.440 --> 40:58.560]  testified to that jury and wanted Kelly in prison they don't think you're a
[40:58.560 --> 41:02.600]  human being they're so self-centered and it's not just the cops the general
[41:02.600 --> 41:06.960]  public we all know is either awake and upset and focused and loving and caring
[41:06.960 --> 41:11.320]  or they're absolutely worldly scum who don't care about their husbands their
[41:11.320 --> 41:17.440]  wives their children their society much less you you know we hear about how the
[41:17.440 --> 41:20.280]  government loves the troops but that's why they've tried to make them and have
[41:20.280 --> 41:24.960]  pay for their meals in hospitals when they're in romstein other hospitals in
[41:24.960 --> 41:31.080]  Europe when their arms and legs blown off or when they're all shot up that's
[41:31.080 --> 41:34.680]  why Obama tried to make troops pay for their own medical care with their own
[41:34.680 --> 41:38.680]  insurance people didn't believe that when we first broke it we saw a
[41:38.680 --> 41:44.760]  congressional report and weeks later the head of the American Legion came on
[41:44.760 --> 41:49.480]  this radio show said he met with Obama and Obama did pitch him the idea but
[41:49.480 --> 41:52.480]  under Bush they were trying to make the troops pay for their own health care in
[41:52.480 --> 41:55.880]  their own food and their own flights back home the point is they don't care
[41:55.880 --> 42:02.000]  about you either and that stupid moron police officer should be fired but of
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.600]  course he wasn't it was funny at the state police office sit around and
[42:05.600 --> 42:09.320]  laugh about trying to ruin some good Americans life for his first amendment
[42:09.320 --> 42:15.080]  Kelly lovingly politely said I'd like you to have this sir I'd like you to
[42:15.080 --> 42:17.920]  see what Ron Paul and Alex Jones have to say about what's happening we'd like
[42:17.920 --> 42:21.320]  you to be on the right side of history alright I said I'd take your calls it's
[42:21.320 --> 42:30.920]  just the Republic is falling right now it is imploding it is falling apart
[42:30.920 --> 42:37.000]  there's no doubt that we're going into a very serious system of oppression there
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.720]  is no doubt we've already been robbed blind there is no doubt that it's only
[42:41.720 --> 42:46.920]  gonna get worse unless we really stand up and the system's gonna stage terror
[42:46.920 --> 42:55.120]  attacks to make themselves the victims there's nothing they won't do all right
[42:55.120 --> 42:58.120]  I'm gonna give each caller one minute cuz I do want to go to everybody let's go
[42:58.120 --> 43:06.160]  to Mike in Ohio go ahead Mike Alex hey buddy how are you good good hey I'm a
[43:06.160 --> 43:09.640]  police officer up here in Ohio and you know that's totally wrong that stuff in
[43:09.640 --> 43:13.320]  Kentucky anyway since I'm only getting a minute I got a few points I want to
[43:13.320 --> 43:19.760]  touch on long-time listener prison plan a subscriber well thank you you call the
[43:19.760 --> 43:24.960]  blue awesome product my uncle bought one loves it Calvin products are great and I
[43:24.960 --> 43:28.600]  just had a serious bout with the flu here and I've been taking colloidal
[43:28.600 --> 43:34.880]  silver for a while and my flu lasted me a day and a half everybody else here at
[43:34.880 --> 43:40.720]  work has been down four to five days so I ordered that silver lungs thing well
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.520]  I'm no medical doctor but we've had medical doctor on after medical doctor
[43:44.520 --> 43:49.320]  who says that silver is the best thing out there now pun intended it's not a
[43:49.320 --> 43:53.360]  silver bullet but it's it's one of the best things out there according to the
[43:53.360 --> 43:57.040]  doctors we've had on the show who aren't even selling this stuff so yeah
[43:57.040 --> 44:02.600]  anything I have as a sponsor I believe in right and actually I'm getting ready
[44:02.600 --> 44:06.040]  to hook up I'm gonna try to hook up with doctor 10 penny for some stuff but
[44:06.040 --> 44:11.520]  on another note I wear my info wars with wristband it says defend freedom on
[44:11.520 --> 44:15.680]  every day we just had a thing with our DHS police let me tell you something
[44:15.680 --> 44:19.600]  most of those guys are good to go but some of them it freaked them out pretty
[44:19.600 --> 44:23.280]  bad that I was wearing that wristband and you know I wear it everywhere you know
[44:23.280 --> 44:27.520]  and the high ups of my department you know they hate it but they let everybody
[44:27.520 --> 44:31.440]  else wear their other wristband so they really can't say too much about it but
[44:31.440 --> 44:36.960]  that's about it man you're doing a great job I haven't watched the trailer yet or
[44:36.960 --> 44:41.400]  the new film yet I was gonna download it but ran out of time on the connection
[44:41.400 --> 44:46.080]  speed but you're doing a great job keep it up and we appreciate everything there's
[44:46.080 --> 44:49.120]  a lot of good cops out here I mean there's there's some dirt bags but
[44:49.120 --> 44:52.680]  there's a lot of good ones so sir I want to be clear I want to be clear and I
[44:52.680 --> 44:54.760]  give you more than a minute the point is that's when I heard everybody's
[44:54.760 --> 45:01.360]  everybody gets on because I'm so long-winded I learn more in a year now
[45:01.360 --> 45:05.640]  than I learned in the previous 10 like everybody in life you know people make
[45:05.640 --> 45:09.320]  the point that as you get older you more and more dots get connected you get
[45:09.320 --> 45:13.400]  more wisdom I know there are a lot of good police I mean I've had a car wreck
[45:13.400 --> 45:19.100]  before both the state troopers that came to help us were fans of the show I go
[45:19.100 --> 45:22.720]  to the gym police come over that are supporters of the show and they see why
[45:22.720 --> 45:26.360]  are you so hard on us you know a lot of us are good and I know police are
[45:26.360 --> 45:33.760]  starting to wake up but at the same time when I see the leadership of most of the
[45:33.760 --> 45:37.360]  big departments we know have been federalized we know they're doing things
[45:37.360 --> 45:41.320]  that are unconstitutional we know there's a lot of scum out on the streets and a
[45:41.320 --> 45:45.120]  lot of crime and I know police have a tough job I certainly I certainly don't
[45:45.120 --> 45:49.200]  want it I mean it's a pretty you know macho gung-ho job I know a lot of the time
[45:49.200 --> 45:54.440]  it's a dangerous job out there writing tickets with cars flying by 80 miles an
[45:54.440 --> 45:59.120]  hour I mean it's insane so I understand a lot of people are waking up who do you
[45:59.120 --> 46:04.600]  think sends me all these police and FBI training manuals and documents that we
[46:04.600 --> 46:10.080]  leak to the public so I know that and you know it's funny that the first person
[46:10.080 --> 46:13.240]  I go to is a police officer when I was just telling the Kelly rushing story I
[46:13.240 --> 46:21.240]  was mainly asking the question how does this country get to that point where
[46:21.240 --> 46:25.640]  because there wasn't more to the story I talked to the judge I saw the trial
[46:25.640 --> 46:29.560]  transcripts after I talked to Kelly rushing I didn't believe it when I first
[46:29.560 --> 46:34.520]  saw it I called his neighbors I did a whole investigation I found out that he
[46:34.520 --> 46:38.800]  owned a business in town and was known as a soft-spoken guy and I read the
[46:38.800 --> 46:42.720]  testimony of the police officer Kelly sent me the transcript after where he
[46:42.720 --> 46:48.040]  gave him a video and said please watch this sir our country's future depends on
[46:48.040 --> 46:52.480]  it so my point in bringing that story up every few months is I'm seeing more and
[46:52.480 --> 46:55.920]  more craziness like that it I mean it's almost like there's two groups dividing
[46:55.920 --> 47:00.920]  you either have the police waking up getting better warning others doing a
[47:00.920 --> 47:07.000]  great job or you have the other group like the G20 where they went into the
[47:07.000 --> 47:10.200]  university saying nobody's allowed out at night nobody's allowed out during the
[47:10.200 --> 47:16.240]  day no one can congregate old women would come out of stores with shopping
[47:16.240 --> 47:19.320]  bags and the police would say get out of here and the women would ask officer
[47:19.320 --> 47:24.120]  I'm just shopping and they would the police dog would bite them and and what
[47:24.120 --> 47:29.120]  I'm saying is it's a mob psychology how have the police gotten to this mob
[47:29.120 --> 47:33.200]  psychology where I'm sure a lot of those cops would have been nice fellas to go
[47:33.200 --> 47:36.800]  watch a football game with but you put them in a black uniform with the Billy
[47:36.800 --> 47:42.440]  Club chasing down women on bikes and beating them in the head I mean this is
[47:42.440 --> 47:46.280]  tyranny that's all I'm saying I can answer that question for you real easy
[47:46.280 --> 47:50.320]  number one their fluoride heads they're out of control on that number two it's
[47:50.320 --> 47:55.160]  the propaganda in in the television we got guys here remember that show the
[47:55.160 --> 48:00.360]  shield yes okay we got guys here that the thing that that's the way it is all
[48:00.360 --> 48:04.200]  over you know and it's what you know I work on everybody you know I pass out
[48:04.200 --> 48:09.080]  your videos to everybody and you know and that's what it is it's a day a lot
[48:09.080 --> 48:13.160]  of guys get that mentality they see that crap on television you know they think
[48:13.160 --> 48:16.560]  that that's the way it is and like you're saying about the high ups you know
[48:16.560 --> 48:19.920]  being all under control and they are you know what I had one of our commanders I
[48:19.920 --> 48:23.880]  was I was complaining about something the other day tell well never complain
[48:23.880 --> 48:27.240]  to talking about some of this stuff the other day and the one commander's like
[48:27.240 --> 48:32.440]  oh that's a new world order get used to it I go let me tell you something bring
[48:32.440 --> 48:37.600]  it my way and we'll see what happens but doesn't he know doesn't he know see see
[48:37.600 --> 48:41.120]  we've gone from the new order doesn't exist till it's in thousands and
[48:41.120 --> 48:45.400]  literally every few months thousands of articles just go to Google news type in
[48:45.400 --> 48:50.440]  new world order and it's thousands it was thousands it was like eight thousand
[48:50.440 --> 48:54.640]  one day ten thousand the next during the g20 the front page of the states where
[48:54.640 --> 48:58.920]  we live said new world order and then they describe it a financial dictatorship
[48:58.920 --> 49:04.160]  does he know what a new order means to him and his family I mean you know they
[49:04.160 --> 49:07.240]  were laughing at his five years ago about new world order are they gonna
[49:07.240 --> 49:12.280]  laugh about eco science are they gonna laugh about what's in their water what's
[49:12.280 --> 49:17.080]  in their shots I mean I want police to know you are not immune from this you
[49:17.080 --> 49:21.600]  this is targeting you we are all together that's what's so frustrating
[49:21.600 --> 49:28.320]  Mike is that we're all together whether whether some rampaging cop knows it or
[49:28.320 --> 49:34.120]  not or whether some corrupt corporate guy knows it or whether some you know just
[49:34.120 --> 49:38.840]  general yuppie who thinks this is all funny we're all in this together we're
[49:38.840 --> 49:45.120]  in the same boat and people need that's that's my message to two listeners is
[49:45.120 --> 49:51.040]  this is it they're killing the country right now and I know down the road
[49:51.040 --> 49:57.360]  everybody is gonna wake up we need to wake up now before it gets even worse I
[49:57.360 --> 50:00.560]  mean I know down the road that we're gonna end up turning this around because
[50:00.560 --> 50:06.440]  all tyrannies get so bad they finally implode but I just studied history and I
[50:06.440 --> 50:14.800]  can't believe we have to go down this road it's like telling a kid not to snort
[50:14.800 --> 50:19.320]  cocaine and they're 15 and go to a party and snort it and have a heart attack or
[50:19.320 --> 50:23.120]  they don't have a heart attack right away ten years later they have a heart
[50:23.120 --> 50:28.000]  attack and are dead it you know you just wish you could get people to listen and
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.200]  to not stick their finger in a light socket to not play in traffic to not I
[50:33.200 --> 50:37.040]  don't know listen great to hear from you Mike and God bless you for what you're
[50:37.040 --> 50:45.080]  doing I've described it like being in a car you've been in a car with somebody
[50:45.080 --> 50:49.840]  when they start wrecking and minutes slow down to seconds or seconds slow down
[50:49.840 --> 50:53.640]  to minutes and you know you're about to slam into that tree and you're just like

[52:20.560 --> 52:25.920]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for

[56:06.040 --> 56:13.480]  I'm a big fan hey I just thought you'd be interested to know it that Sweden is
[56:13.480 --> 56:18.080]  actually burning bunny rabbits for biofuel it's on Scientific American hey
[56:18.080 --> 56:22.320]  do me a favor to turn that radio off because it's delayed and I hear myself
[56:22.320 --> 56:30.560]  ranting what is the headline it's a burning bunnies for biofuel on a
[56:30.560 --> 56:36.080]  Scientific American observer Sweden is that in Stockholm they're actually
[56:36.080 --> 56:41.960]  hunting down bunny rabbits to be sent off to a rendering plant for to be
[56:41.960 --> 56:50.760]  turned into biofuel I'll have to look into that but listen for more than 50
[56:50.760 --> 56:57.360]  years they feed awful to cows cows aren't even supposed to eat meat they're
[56:57.360 --> 57:03.600]  vegetarian they're herbivores they're not omnivores like a pig or a human
[57:03.600 --> 57:10.200]  they're not carnivores like a lion or a tiger and that's where mad cow disease
[57:10.200 --> 57:15.680]  came from they admit and they're still taking dead cows a lot of vets sell the
[57:15.680 --> 57:20.840]  euthanized animals and they grind them up into the awful and these giant slurry
[57:20.840 --> 57:28.920]  pits like you could search a dog food or animal food production plant awful use
[57:28.920 --> 57:34.520]  the term awful an awful plant and if you've got the the stomach for it you
[57:34.520 --> 57:39.520]  can actually watch videos online I've seen one of thousands of rotten animals
[57:39.520 --> 57:48.000]  being ground up and see in the rotten meat crystals grow these prions and
[57:48.000 --> 57:53.760]  then you eat them and they start growing in your brain but yeah there it is
[57:53.760 --> 57:58.440]  Sweden is burning bunnies for biofuel no matter how insane the headline it
[57:58.440 --> 58:04.880]  turns out to be true to lower our co2 emissions oh yes cuz co2 is so deadly
[58:04.880 --> 58:11.120]  anything else you'd also be interested to know that here in New Jersey New
[58:11.120 --> 58:15.200]  Jersey actually has double the autism rate of the rest of the country I do in
[58:15.200 --> 58:18.360]  no part of the fact that New Jersey mandates more vaccines than any of
[58:18.360 --> 58:23.040]  their statement a union I knew that I'd seen that absolutely and I have to sit
[58:23.040 --> 58:27.120]  here and look at all the brain damage kids walking around feeling I feel sorry
[58:27.120 --> 58:30.840]  for them and their stupid parents won't wake up because the government wouldn't
[58:30.840 --> 58:35.280]  hurt them the government wouldn't put mercury in the shot they said so in the

[1:00:55.960 --> 1:00:58.920]  to burn it and pass it all out but we had to turn it off so I could get on and
[1:00:58.920 --> 1:01:05.480]  and call you real quick my aunt is 53 years old and in 76 she had a swine
[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:11.440]  flu shot she was 19 and was okay for two weeks until she woke up paralyzed and
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:16.680]  has had 60 plus brain surgeries she has the Ghanbari syndrome she has pseudotumor
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:23.240]  cerebri very very sick woman my family does not do flu shots we don't do we're
[1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:28.960]  done with vaccinations we have four small children I was living in a bubble
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:32.800]  for a long time my husband would come home from work and pull up prison planet
[1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:36.080]  info wars and you gotta sit down and watch this you gotta sit down and watch
[1:01:36.080 --> 1:01:40.040]  it and I'm like no I kind of like not knowing what's going on until about six
[1:01:40.040 --> 1:01:44.200]  months ago I really started getting into everything and we are big huge fans of
[1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:47.600]  you and support everything that you do and my husband loves you and loves your
[1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:53.360]  show and the government had tried to pay her off with $200,000 back in 76 and
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:55.920]  said this will take care of your medical bills we're done you can never do
[1:01:55.920 --> 1:02:00.760]  anything well we had different we've had different historians on the government
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:04.880]  says thousands died tens of thousands got sick it's more like hundreds of
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:09.600]  thousands got sick tens of thousands died and it's now happening again I mean
[1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:14.520]  it's in AP Fox CNN but just little blurbs about oh yeah this woman was fine
[1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:18.400]  now she's paralyzed and they admit the vaccine did it but it's still worth it
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:23.360]  to save the children and what is it like for you to know that this happened to
[1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:28.960]  your family member to know that it ruined her life to know that it devastated
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:33.760]  her and then to know that the New York Times and other major publications are
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:38.600]  saying that there's no mercury no Gillian beret no diseases and no
[1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:43.840]  infertility no cancer risk which is in the insert I showed them again on TV
[1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:48.840]  yesterday we post them this is direct links to the government and then
[1:02:48.840 --> 1:02:53.480]  meanwhile they'll just lie and say oh it's a conspiracy theory and all over the
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:59.360]  country we've confirmed in California Oregon Texas a bunch of Florida we've
[1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:03.800]  been sent the local news articles where they're giving a fact sheet out to quell
[1:03:03.800 --> 1:03:10.400]  fears and misinformation to the parents and the children saying it's not true it
[1:03:10.400 --> 1:03:16.840]  has mercury it's not true we can cause a neurological disorder it's not true that
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:23.080]  it has adjuvants it's not and they are liars and ladies and gentlemen it's even
[1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:28.320]  hard for me to come to grips with the magnitude of that level of criminal
[1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:34.080]  lying and then to hear a police officer earlier talk about how his commander is
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:39.080]  just like ah so what it's just the New World Order don't you get it folks no
[1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:45.680]  matter how crazy or scary it sounds it's true they want to kill you they're
[1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:50.600]  testing how many of us they can kill before we wake up all of their testing
[1:03:50.600 --> 1:03:56.160]  and killing and bio and chemical attacking others is only the beginning
[1:03:56.160 --> 1:04:03.240]  it's only a test a probe go ahead no I just she she had five miscarriages as
[1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:06.920]  well years later after having this she couldn't she couldn't get pregnant she
[1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:11.720]  was constantly having miscarriage it's the answer it totally ruins lives this
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:18.880]  is murder she she has one daughter who is she just turned 18 and and there isn't
[1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:23.000]  any other history you know I mean because once I don't know the whole family
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:27.200]  though bottom line is we don't we have our children are eight almost six four
[1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:32.880]  and two and we did before going to your websites and learning about all this we
[1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:36.840]  were the stupid ass parents who vaccinated our children but we've been done
[1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:40.960]  and and we've signed the papers and they're taken to school and and my two
[1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:44.040]  were in second grade in kindergarten and I had to keep them home because they
[1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:48.760]  were doing vaccinations at the school so I kept my kids home from school last
[1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:52.520]  week because I thought you know what if they just inject them anyway regardless
[1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:57.880]  of what my paper says they do that they do that Heather God bless you keep it

[1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:41.440]  people that it's not proven that it can sterilize you or reduce your fertility
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:47.080]  and give you infertility that there are live cancer viruses in every major
[1:09:47.080 --> 1:09:54.760]  vaccine that's been studied now I've noticed a trend and interviewing doctors
[1:09:54.760 --> 1:10:03.440]  and researchers we have identified the vaccines that are particularly bad and
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:10.200]  that the United Nations has been caught in the third world adding
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:15.520]  pathogens to them they've been caught doing it on purpose those vaccines are
[1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:32.000]  polio tetanus hepatitis flu and HIV vaccine trials and there are different
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:36.600]  companies there are a lot of smaller companies that don't have as bad a
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:42.800]  records with adding all this garbage to the vaccines but the big mega
[1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:47.240]  corporations are all involved in eugenics they're all on the record
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:52.800]  involved in population control but it's not just about vaccines this illustrates
[1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:59.880]  how big government and big media get together and lie and tell everybody it's
[1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:03.440]  the law you've got to take the shot to be at work or be in school meanwhile
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:05.920]  President Obama says oh you don't have to take the shot we're just gonna try to
[1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:12.960]  force you to take it and if they will collude together to lie about something
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:16.480]  this big that they know maims and kills tens of thousands of people
[1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:20.840]  conservatively every year in the US do you then not understand that they would
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:25.600]  stage a terror attack especially when there are over 200 declassified examples
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:30.240]  of the criminal US government staging terror attacks and then hundreds of
[1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:34.720]  other examples of where they provocateur and go out and find mentally ill white
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:41.240]  supremacist Muslims you name it to go out and stage terror attacks these aren't
[1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:46.840]  just entrapment they go out find the groups fund them set them up so and then
[1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:52.200]  there are some real terror examples what do you think Iran is gonna do because
[1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:56.440]  the United States Israel and England have been staging scores of terror attacks
[1:11:56.440 --> 1:12:01.720]  a year for the last seven years at least inside Iran last Sunday blew up a
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:09.640]  giant police station killing a top general run by Joondola a group publicly
[1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:15.880]  funded by the US government to stage the attacks Iran has been playing it smart
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:20.200]  not staging attacks back knowing that that's the pretext the West wants to
[1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:28.320]  bomb that country into the Stone Age but the issue is that Iran or some of their
[1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:31.400]  other hotheads that are in their government are probably going to blow up
[1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:37.720]  some airplanes they're probably going to run a truck full of explosives into a
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:42.800]  Marine Corps barracks the Iranians don't play games and when they attack it's
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:46.280]  going to be military bases and they're probably going to blow up some US
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:49.400]  military bases now because the United States blew up one of their military
[1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:56.240]  bases it's absolutely horrible I'll guarantee you the Marines and Army
[1:12:56.240 --> 1:13:00.560]  soldiers or sailors that are going to get blown up by Iranian suicide bombers
[1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:12.720]  from their Islamic Guard have no idea that the Pentagon is staging terror
[1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:17.240]  attacks in Iran they're busy reading playboy and watching football on the
[1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:21.680]  satellite and going out doing guard duty and when that truck rolls through
[1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:27.280]  their gates and kills them it'll all be over the news oh my gosh Iran did it now
[1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:32.800]  we've got to hit them and then Iran is going to fire 12,000 sunburn missiles at
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:36.600]  our ships and our troops in World War three is going to start and that's
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:41.880]  exactly what the globalists want just like it's been declassified that MI5
[1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:52.120]  MI6 formerly OSS the Milner Group Lord Milner on record funded Hitler funded
[1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:56.680]  German intelligence funded the buildup of the fascist British intelligence on
[1:13:56.680 --> 1:14:01.200]  record told the Germans attack Poland attack Czechoslovakia attack the
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:07.640]  Russians we're gonna make a deal with you we're going to help you take over the
[1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:12.760]  world and the king of England Hild Hitler Edward the 8th it's all on
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:20.360]  record just like they're staging events now just like they're attacking Iran so
[1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:26.920]  Iran will strike back just like the British killed the Archduke Franz
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:39.520]  Ferdinand of the Austrian Hungarian Empire to start World War one and they
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:43.960]  went and killed the head of the Germanic nations and with a hand grenade and
[1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:47.760]  machine gun attack and you better believe the Germans went absolutely
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:55.480]  ape and got World War one going to kill tens of millions of soldiers total
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:15:00.800]  that's what the British intelligence brain does there is no one more cunning
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:09.080]  no one more wicked no one more evil are the British people bad no I'm part
[1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:15.080]  British I mean my name is Jones I'm Welsh it's a Welsh name the issue is
[1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:21.880]  that this is what governments do and no one is more wicked and cunning and
[1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:25.480]  abusive and evil than the people running our government that's why they're on
[1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:31.440]  top that's why they rule because they're the most evil are the Russians evil
[1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:35.760]  absolutely are the Iranians corrupt and evil their leadership absolutely is
[1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:41.320]  Muammar Gaddafi corrupt absolutely that's the nature of power that's history
[1:15:41.320 --> 1:15:46.640]  that's what the founding fathers taught us CW in Texas you're on the air hey
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:51.760]  Alex thanks for taking my call hey buddy it looks like mr. Lindsey Williams is
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:56.920]  on the money about what he said earlier this week because oh big Cheney came out
[1:15:56.920 --> 1:16:01.960]  yesterday and had some harsh words for the Obama administration so it looks
[1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:07.120]  like that's kind of gelling with what he's saying well I believe that Lindsey
[1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:11.360]  is telling the truth I believe Lindsey does talk to this individual his other
[1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:15.400]  prediction about oil to drop from 150 to below 50 happened for the year like he
[1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:23.840]  said but again that's only one elitist one perspective one angle so you're
[1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:28.400]  right about that just want to tell you to you and your staff are you bravo on
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:32.240]  the movie I don't know if it's a knockout punch the New World Order but
[1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:34.960]  it's definitely the punch before the knockout punch it's gonna put a few
[1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:39.280]  cracks in the glass well well I mean Paul Watson's headline is not saying this
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:43.720]  film is going to defeat the New World Order his point is that it will be
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:48.040]  devastating to their system for the Republic devastates globalist agenda
[1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:53.480]  the film itself what that saying is if you watch it you will fully understand
[1:16:53.480 --> 1:16:57.040]  their entire agenda and it's made for the average person to be able to
[1:16:57.040 --> 1:17:01.840]  understand it as well obviously there's some new information for everybody and
[1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:05.600]  riveting info with Alan Watt and countless others John Perkins Jesse
[1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:11.320]  Ventura the list goes on and on but if the people take this video and make
[1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:15.960]  tens of millions of copies of the DVDs burning them at your homes making
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:20.600]  copies and getting them out to people it it is the beginning of the knockout
[1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:24.760]  punch I mean look people are waking up in droves right now we can't underestimate
[1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:28.600]  the power of the people so you're right about that and I think the
[1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:32.720]  establishment definitely knows it that's why I'm on the White House enemies
[1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:37.520]  list but but briefly give us your review of the film well honestly sir I
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:41.280]  hadn't seen it yet I've been doing everything by mail and I've totally
[1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:44.520]  detoxed from the internet but I've talked to some friends in our group and
[1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:48.760]  stuff and they're saying you know smash it and I trust their opinion just as
[1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:55.120]  yours and anyone else's who know this information but I think a great area of
[1:17:55.120 --> 1:18:01.360]  attack and one that I focused on here in this area is local radio and I've been
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:05.320]  fairly successful like I've mentioned in the past edit and I just like to put it
[1:18:05.320 --> 1:18:09.040]  fully outside info warriors to get together and call in at your local
[1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:13.320]  radio two three four at a time and fill up the call bank with people with
[1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:16.640]  knowledge because it plays to the theater of the mind and then if people
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:20.520]  start thinking well damn mean I don't know nothing about fluoride or this or
[1:18:20.520 --> 1:18:24.440]  that because no matter what these talking heads are talking about the
[1:18:24.440 --> 1:18:28.920]  microcosm issue they think so huge if you really know your information and
[1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:33.200]  you've done your homework you can spin it and show them how the new world order
[1:18:33.200 --> 1:18:37.000]  is using that issue you know what I mean absolutely good to hear from you let's
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:44.120]  talk to Jim in Missouri you're on the air Jim hey Alex school is in session and

[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:23.240]  I came into into listening to your show in the first place I I did exactly what
[1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:28.520]  you said to do which is don't take my word for it independently verify the
[1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:37.520]  facts and I've done so and I also liked the fact that in all of the Republic the
[1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:42.440]  point was made that having the information is just a first step if you
[1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:47.840]  don't do anything with that information if you don't start preparing and start
[1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:54.080]  motivating yourself to resist the new world order having the knowledge doesn't
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:27:00.600]  do anything without the will to act upon it absolutely and I thought that was a
[1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:05.360]  great point but well there are so many corporate tricks in the media but their
[1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:12.280]  biggest trick is fake fights Fox News attacks CNN CNN attacks Fox News the
[1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:16.440]  White House comes out and attacks Limbaugh and Beck to make it look like
[1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:20.960]  they're actually threatened by them and to make it look like oh well of Obama's
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:26.880]  bad Fox and Rush Limbaugh must be good when the Republicans are only the party
[1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:31.240]  out of power so they can now act like their anti-new world order and of course
[1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:34.960]  that doesn't mean all Republicans are bad or all Democrats are bad but the
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:40.280]  leadership themselves are on the same page and so they lay out this choice
[1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:45.080]  like are you gonna be for the Cowboys or the Titans are you gonna be for the
[1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:48.600]  Jaguars are you gonna be for the Seahawks and then people just well I'll
[1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:52.280]  choose that it's kind of like a trick that a used car salesman will say well
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:55.800]  you got a choice you can buy one of these three cars and a lot of people in a
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:28:00.200]  mind game go ahead and buy one of the cars not thinking well wait I can go buy
[1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:05.880]  a car somewhere else it's very simple little mind games that they play but on
[1:28:05.880 --> 1:28:11.200]  the subject of fall of the Republic you no doubt found my show because people
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:15.200]  told you about it whether it was on the internet or in person others will now
[1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:18.960]  find the radio show find the films because you are now going to pay it
[1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:22.080]  forward and tell them about it other people will make their own films their
[1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:26.040]  own YouTube videos their own radio shows will be leaders in their own right in
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:30.720]  their area and many hands make light work together moving against the common
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:35.240]  enemy the globalist we are going to win this thing if we realize that we can
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:41.120]  win and have a manifesto that is our Constitution Bill of Rights a blueprint
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:46.240]  a idea that we move together even though we're not communicating with each
[1:28:46.240 --> 1:28:51.720]  other across the nation every day in every way it's a idea that we're
[1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:56.880]  reaching for and that idea is bulletproof so it is up to you I make the
[1:28:56.880 --> 1:29:02.040]  films people support me so I can make them that's symbiotic but 99% of it is
[1:29:02.040 --> 1:29:08.240]  now in your hands this is your film fall the Republic belongs to you that's why
[1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:12.440]  I make these films and then give them out to the public and the people give us
[1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:16.760]  the seed money by buying the DVDs by being prison planet TV members they get
[1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:22.400]  it first they get the best quality and then we carry the ball forward to others
[1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:27.400]  and because the tyranny is coming in like a flood right now people are really
[1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:32.240]  ready to listen we have fertile fields we have plenty of rain we have sunshine
[1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:38.680]  this the tyranny is actually generating growth in the tree of liberty and so God
[1:29:38.680 --> 1:29:43.640]  bless you I salute you Eric in Florida keep up the great work and let's just
[1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:49.280]  intensify everything we are doing right now with follow the Republic this is an
[1:29:49.280 --> 1:29:55.920]  information warfare weapon we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[1:29:55.920 --> 1:30:04.200]  and the GCN radio network hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the
[1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:09.200]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:13.000]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:17.680]  Americans at home have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[1:30:17.680 --> 1:30:22.720]  and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[1:30:22.720 --> 1:30:27.920]  American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of
[1:30:27.920 --> 1:30:33.000]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and

[1:34:22.940 --> 1:34:30.100]  here unless we wake up shake off the mind numb days the mesmerized trance
[1:34:30.100 --> 1:34:35.100]  were under and get angry when you finally look at the information when you
[1:34:35.100 --> 1:34:38.620]  finally do research for yourself and you find out what's really going on you're
[1:34:38.620 --> 1:34:44.300]  gonna say Alex Jones wasn't crazy Alex Jones wasn't a hothead I was reading a
[1:34:44.300 --> 1:34:48.580]  big report of London Guardian by a top anthropologist about how aggressive men
[1:34:48.580 --> 1:34:54.740]  used to be how much stronger men were we have been domesticated I don't want to
[1:34:54.740 --> 1:34:57.700]  say we've been feminized because women have always fought been strong too we've
[1:34:57.700 --> 1:35:02.300]  been domesticated we've been castrated we have been taught that we're supposed
[1:35:02.300 --> 1:35:06.980]  to talk like mr. Rogers and be real soft and and and and sit there like a bunch
[1:35:06.980 --> 1:35:11.180]  of children have the government tell us what to do no we're supposed to grow
[1:35:11.180 --> 1:35:18.660]  grow some hair on our chest ladies and gentlemen I mean you know a hundred
[1:35:18.660 --> 1:35:24.220]  years ago was a sign of manhood to be bald that meant you had a lot of testosterone
[1:35:24.220 --> 1:35:28.060]  women thought that looked good then Madison Avenue taught us that it was
[1:35:28.060 --> 1:35:34.100]  unnatural and bad and that and that you know they had to make us all feel
[1:35:34.100 --> 1:35:40.420]  inadequate about ourselves it's all just a load of baloney an absolute crock of
[1:35:40.420 --> 1:35:49.300]  propaganda of cockamamie of bunk and I am not going to be a slave I mean all
[1:35:49.300 --> 1:35:52.380]  intensive purposes the slave grids all around me but I'm mentally
[1:35:52.380 --> 1:35:56.940]  psychologically I know what I'm in I'm aware of the battlefield and all I do is
[1:35:56.940 --> 1:36:01.140]  study it and I'm here to tell you if you would just look under the rock and see
[1:36:01.140 --> 1:36:06.380]  what I've seen then I wouldn't have to sit here and motivate you to take action
[1:36:06.380 --> 1:36:11.980]  I desperately just want to reach people I desperately want to warn people I don't
[1:36:11.980 --> 1:36:18.100]  want to see people getting conned or getting manipulated it's like if you saw
[1:36:18.100 --> 1:36:22.660]  your neighbor drive off from their parking lot and there was a trail of
[1:36:22.660 --> 1:36:30.820]  gasoline behind the car and you tell them about it and they laugh at you and
[1:36:30.820 --> 1:36:36.060]  then two days later their car blows up you know that's a true story when I was
[1:36:36.060 --> 1:36:39.300]  in high school went to a couple years in Dallas couple years here when I was a
[1:36:39.300 --> 1:36:45.140]  senior in high school I was walking the dog the neighbor a couple doors down had
[1:36:45.140 --> 1:36:53.380]  a silver superbele I guess the last one they made in 1979 the reason I know is
[1:36:53.380 --> 1:36:58.180]  my parents had one at one time and I saw him drive out and I saw a trail a
[1:36:58.180 --> 1:37:03.860]  little three centimeter wide trail of gasoline I reached over touched it
[1:37:03.860 --> 1:37:07.660]  smelled it was gasoline I saw him that evening and I said your car's got a
[1:37:07.660 --> 1:37:11.540]  trail of gasoline behind it they started laughing at me I went oh yeah okay
[1:37:11.540 --> 1:37:18.180]  thanks kid and that was a middle-aged yuppie and I and I told him us you know
[1:37:18.180 --> 1:37:22.100]  there's no way some kid could tell him this and I said no seriously sir that
[1:37:22.100 --> 1:37:26.820]  that that could that could really catch your car on fire so super beetle takes
[1:37:26.820 --> 1:37:32.580]  gasoline regular gasoline not diesel extremely explosive and about a month
[1:37:32.580 --> 1:37:36.060]  later he comes up and apologizes to me and said yeah I was driving my daughter
[1:37:36.060 --> 1:37:40.020]  to school it caught on fire and the whole car burned up the fire department
[1:37:40.020 --> 1:37:46.980]  had to come blew up now I'm not some genius ladies and gentlemen if I see a
[1:37:46.980 --> 1:37:53.180]  trail of gasoline like in a Looney Tunes Wiley coyote cartoon a trail of
[1:37:53.180 --> 1:38:02.180]  gasoline a trail a solid trail of gasoline behind the rear engine car I
[1:38:02.180 --> 1:38:05.940]  know that you're going to end up having your engine blow up I mean it's a 99
[1:38:05.940 --> 1:38:12.980]  percent chance if you drive the car long enough it's going to blow up and I know
[1:38:12.980 --> 1:38:17.780]  the vaccines are designed to brain damage you when they overly brain damage
[1:38:17.780 --> 1:38:22.420]  you when they do too good of a job you get so brain damaged and paralyzed that
[1:38:22.420 --> 1:38:27.380]  it's then obvious they don't want that so they try to balance it and that's in
[1:38:27.380 --> 1:38:30.540]  government documents that's why you say the public stupid and can't seem to
[1:38:30.540 --> 1:38:35.260]  understand they're brain damaged you know we've gotten tears of the Austin
[1:38:35.260 --> 1:38:41.260]  water treatment facility we've gotten tears of it went and did an interview
[1:38:41.260 --> 1:38:47.420]  with them as well we're gonna put that in the upcoming film and we got a tour
[1:38:47.420 --> 1:38:54.100]  with a local anti-fluoride action group and there are quite a few companies but
[1:38:54.100 --> 1:39:02.100]  I know it's I know it's less than 15 we've done some research but there are a
[1:39:02.100 --> 1:39:07.780]  handful of big companies that have toxic waste byproducts and I know I talk
[1:39:07.780 --> 1:39:10.580]  about this all the time but what else what am I supposed to talk about here
[1:39:10.580 --> 1:39:15.540]  this is the stuff that really matters and if you look at the different companies
[1:39:15.540 --> 1:39:20.700]  each company has a different mix and it's whatever's coming out of their
[1:39:20.700 --> 1:39:27.140]  aluminum purification plant it's whatever's coming out of their fertilizer
[1:39:27.140 --> 1:39:29.700]  production plant you know where most fertilizer comes from they mine
[1:39:29.700 --> 1:39:36.500]  limestone that has the chemicals in it that plants need or in the words of
[1:39:36.500 --> 1:39:40.940]  idiocracy it's got the electrolytes plants crave brondo I'm joking the point
[1:39:40.940 --> 1:39:46.580]  is that depending on the mix it's between 150 and I'm being general here
[1:39:46.580 --> 1:39:52.700]  people go nitpicking goes 156 in the Austin water supply you said 150 whatever
[1:39:52.700 --> 1:40:00.180]  it's it's it's around 150 to over 300 different deadly chemicals they put in
[1:40:00.180 --> 1:40:05.980]  your water and it's called fluoride oh it's got sodium fluoride and several
[1:40:05.980 --> 1:40:10.980]  other variants of fluoride in it and I've had the head of the EPA Union on
[1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:16.500]  who's a top PhD doctorate in toxicology here on the show yeah we had him on
[1:40:16.500 --> 1:40:20.180]  about a year ago we should get him back on forget his name you just Google
[1:40:20.180 --> 1:40:25.180]  head of EPA Union says fluoridation deadly 90% another headline of EPA
[1:40:25.180 --> 1:40:28.180]  scientists write letter to their own department saying please take it out of
[1:40:28.180 --> 1:40:33.780]  water the point is is that it's hundreds of chemicals different mixes of
[1:40:33.780 --> 1:40:39.140]  mercury lead arsenic and they go mine this limestone and that's the byproduct
[1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:44.580]  that that that they don't put in the fertilizer the fertilizer companies
[1:40:44.580 --> 1:40:54.460]  also have food crop fertilizer they have food crop fertilizer that by law can't
[1:40:54.460 --> 1:40:57.980]  have these poisons in it and they have lawn fertilizer you want to learn what's
[1:40:57.980 --> 1:41:03.140]  in your water go to Home Depot or Lowe's or your hardware store and go read
[1:41:03.140 --> 1:41:10.500]  lawn fertilizer ingredients versus garden fertilizer it will say on lawn
[1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:18.700]  fertilizer do not put this on your garden and it will list deadly chemicals
[1:41:18.700 --> 1:41:22.220]  and poisons that are in it do you hear the environmentalists not wanting that
[1:41:22.220 --> 1:41:25.260]  put on your yard it's the toxic waste they're getting rid of and you put on
[1:41:25.260 --> 1:41:28.900]  your yard and it goes down the drain it goes down the gutters into your water
[1:41:28.900 --> 1:41:34.980]  supplies now the same stuff is dumped in your water and you should have seen him
[1:41:34.980 --> 1:41:39.620]  the facility in Austin where they put the put the chemicals in the the
[1:41:39.620 --> 1:41:44.380]  concrete's all eaten this stuff eats through concrete you're drinking that
[1:41:44.380 --> 1:41:47.820]  and we know at one part per million sodium fluoride brain damages and
[1:41:47.820 --> 1:41:51.180]  doubles your chance of bone cancer those are government's own numbers but this
[1:41:51.180 --> 1:41:54.260]  isn't just sodium fluoride it's a whole bunch of different types and all these
[1:41:54.260 --> 1:42:08.740]  other poisons and you are drinking it now that is forced medication but what
[1:42:08.740 --> 1:42:12.740]  really has been hitting me the last few days is what a coward and what a pathetic
[1:42:12.740 --> 1:42:18.460]  blob I am and how conditioned I am and how stupid I am and how I'm not doing
[1:42:18.460 --> 1:42:25.020]  enough and how I haven't gotten outraged enough to consciously see how
[1:42:25.020 --> 1:42:29.540]  outrageous it is to really have it come home how I've grown up in all of this and
[1:42:29.540 --> 1:42:32.860]  just accepted it I know they're poisoning me by design I have their own
[1:42:32.860 --> 1:42:37.580]  documents I know what's in there and that goes for everybody else in this
[1:42:37.580 --> 1:42:45.140]  country there shouldn't be fluoride in the Austin water one week from now it
[1:42:45.140 --> 1:42:50.740]  should be out now those bastards at the city councils that laugh at you while
[1:42:50.740 --> 1:42:54.900]  their children drink this stuff while they drink it even if you try to
[1:42:54.900 --> 1:42:58.900]  filter it you still in swimming pools or in your shower you breathe it it goes
[1:42:58.900 --> 1:43:02.900]  through your skin it's the biggest organ in your body look the point is I'm
[1:43:02.900 --> 1:43:06.300]  gonna talk more and more about this they shouldn't be forcing us to take their
[1:43:06.300 --> 1:43:12.580]  vaccines we shouldn't be putting up with the establishment telling us we've
[1:43:12.580 --> 1:43:16.980]  got to have this stuff in our water I mean it's over bastards do you
[1:43:16.980 --> 1:43:21.460]  understand get angry ladies and gentlemen all of you listening go to your
[1:43:21.460 --> 1:43:25.140]  city council every week it's worth it you'll save thousands of people in your
[1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:29.620]  town from brain damage and cancer and say listen you little bastards you can
[1:43:29.620 --> 1:43:33.980]  get the local water department's own list of what's in it and say here's a
[1:43:33.980 --> 1:43:37.420]  hundred and fifty or here's 270 or whatever the case is with your town
[1:43:37.420 --> 1:43:41.860]  with whatever crap they're buying get it out of my water right now you bastards
[1:43:41.860 --> 1:43:46.540]  if you caught me in your house let's say you kept a water jug in the
[1:43:46.540 --> 1:43:51.020]  refrigerator like a lot of people do and you caught me in there putting a
[1:43:51.020 --> 1:43:56.180]  couple drops of 200 plus deadly poisons in there you there'd be something wrong
[1:43:56.180 --> 1:44:00.980]  with you if you didn't grab a shotgun out of your closet and blow me to kingdom
[1:44:00.980 --> 1:44:04.420]  come or if you didn't beat the living daylights out of me but when the
[1:44:04.420 --> 1:44:10.740]  government does it oh it's completely normal all right I'm gonna shut up go
[1:44:10.740 --> 1:44:14.580]  back to your calls after we got a break and we've got Gerald Salente coming up
[1:44:14.580 --> 1:44:18.620]  the big news blitz as well in the last hour today but I wanted to bring Steve
[1:44:18.620 --> 1:44:24.380]  Shank up because he's the founder owner of the J. Michael Stevens group the
[1:44:24.380 --> 1:44:28.700]  biggest most continually operating highest quality non-gmo non-hybrid
[1:44:28.700 --> 1:44:31.860]  storeable food it's where I chose to get my storeable food when I tried out a
[1:44:31.860 --> 1:44:35.420]  bunch of other places and he's got a lot of new specials for people and we're
[1:44:35.420 --> 1:44:38.620]  honored to have him on here with us today until we go to break Steve good to
[1:44:38.620 --> 1:44:42.980]  have you on with us what you think of that last rant well I loved it Alex
[1:44:42.980 --> 1:44:47.260]  we've been fighting that issue for a lot of a lot of years in every community in
[1:44:47.260 --> 1:44:53.260]  this country people are aware of that that fluoride it is toxic waste used to
[1:44:53.260 --> 1:44:56.500]  be left over from the aluminum industry and now they're just creating it it's
[1:44:56.500 --> 1:45:03.460]  just absolutely pathetic absolutely pathetic we have so much going on not
[1:45:03.460 --> 1:45:07.740]  only are they putting a junk in the water but we've been working for two
[1:45:07.740 --> 1:45:13.420]  years now to try and get everything out of the supplies that we build and we
[1:45:13.420 --> 1:45:18.460]  just came out with a new product line called neutral reversal foods and this
[1:45:18.460 --> 1:45:24.820]  is clear of of hydrogenated oil genetically altered stuff and everything
[1:45:24.820 --> 1:45:31.740]  and I tell you what just to get the poisons out of the raw materials that
[1:45:31.740 --> 1:45:37.180]  the foods are processed from is absolutely a huge job in this country
[1:45:37.180 --> 1:45:42.940]  right now let alone the water situation but I tell you what I have to
[1:45:42.940 --> 1:45:49.020]  congratulate you on this on this last last video that you put together this
[1:45:49.020 --> 1:45:54.340]  is absolutely what everyone needs to get the first step that they need to do is
[1:45:54.340 --> 1:45:59.580]  they need to get that and then people have to realize in every country we've
[1:45:59.580 --> 1:46:04.420]  got we've got our good service people over there fighting and dying in
[1:46:04.420 --> 1:46:10.220]  countries starting with Vietnam and and all these little brush fire and huge
[1:46:10.220 --> 1:46:16.420]  wars since then losing those battles and one of the things that that folks have
[1:46:16.420 --> 1:46:23.500]  to realize is Saddam Hussein before he was kicked out of power or taken out of
[1:46:23.500 --> 1:46:29.420]  power told all of his people to put in what not ammunition to deal with this
[1:46:29.420 --> 1:46:36.580]  with the oncoming onslaught but food why did the why did the Soviets get kicked
[1:46:36.580 --> 1:46:42.140]  out of Iraq because all those little Afghanistan around they had old beat-up
[1:46:42.140 --> 1:46:46.540]  rifles that couldn't even match the archaic stuff that we had from World War
[1:46:46.540 --> 1:46:52.900]  1 but they still kicked the Soviets out because the main thing that they did was
[1:46:52.900 --> 1:46:59.580]  they had food now what people have to do they have to get your last DVD and they
[1:46:59.580 --> 1:47:04.060]  have to listen to it and what they have to do once they've listened to that is
[1:47:04.060 --> 1:47:09.100]  realize that the only way that they can maintain their liberty and their chance
[1:47:09.100 --> 1:47:14.260]  at fighting this war is to be able to sustain themselves because this system
[1:47:14.260 --> 1:47:18.540]  you mentioned it just before you went into your little rant about the fact
[1:47:18.540 --> 1:47:22.220]  that they are going to pass legislation where people are not going to be able to
[1:47:22.220 --> 1:47:26.860]  even have their own gardens the best way for people to have their own gardens
[1:47:26.860 --> 1:47:32.620]  very simply right now is to own the food and we just came out with a new product
[1:47:32.620 --> 1:47:37.940]  is new traversal stuff that is absolutely phenomenal it's pure food it has
[1:47:37.940 --> 1:47:42.700]  better flavor than any restaurants you can get it's priced better than you can
[1:47:42.700 --> 1:47:49.860]  buy groceries and very simply what it's put together to do it comes in what we
[1:47:49.860 --> 1:47:55.860]  call a seven-day responder this is a whole week's worth of food in a box that's
[1:47:55.860 --> 1:48:01.340]  one foot square and four inches deep less than a third of a cubic yard and
[1:48:01.340 --> 1:48:07.380]  our cube cubic foot I'm sorry and what that does is it provides two cup meals
[1:48:07.380 --> 1:48:11.820]  in other words it provides twice the size double meals three meals a day plus
[1:48:11.820 --> 1:48:17.820]  snacks and people literally can put this in that are challenged financially can't
[1:48:17.820 --> 1:48:20.860]  put in a whole year's supply they can put in a week at a time they can put in
[1:48:20.860 --> 1:48:27.180]  four weeks at a time and unless people have food at this point with the way
[1:48:27.180 --> 1:48:31.740]  the system is going after our food supply farmers are being put out of
[1:48:31.740 --> 1:48:39.420]  business this this this this process whereby they're they're increasing the
[1:48:39.420 --> 1:48:44.020]  cost of electricity for drying foods and working with with the farmers and
[1:48:44.020 --> 1:48:48.580]  they're going after the farmers for their emissions they're claiming that this
[1:48:48.580 --> 1:48:54.020]  global warming fiasco is largely the result of farmers putting out more
[1:48:54.020 --> 1:48:59.180]  greenhouse gases than than the entire craft yeah they're saying they're gonna
[1:48:59.180 --> 1:49:02.780]  tax all the farmers they're gonna tax all the farmers look my reason for having
[1:49:02.780 --> 1:49:06.460]  horrible food I promote whatever I do what I think is good for Alex Jones I
[1:49:06.460 --> 1:49:09.180]  tell everybody I think they should do people can take it or leave it if they
[1:49:09.180 --> 1:49:13.660]  want with all the talk of depression the end of the dollar with all this talk of
[1:49:13.660 --> 1:49:18.940]  war with the way the whole world's going 90% of people were self-sufficient in the
[1:49:18.940 --> 1:49:23.020]  Great Depression and University studies say 7 million starved to death over the
[1:49:23.020 --> 1:49:29.540]  nine years folks are insane if they don't have food firearms gold water
[1:49:29.540 --> 1:49:35.340]  filters and food is the most important along with water I have three one year

[1:54:30.140 --> 1:54:34.460]  talking to Steve during the break Steve I'm flattered that you've already seen
[1:54:34.460 --> 1:54:39.220]  follow the Republic I guess you watched it at prisonplanet.tv absolutely and
[1:54:39.220 --> 1:54:44.580]  then I've got to say something listeners you've heard Alex and I talk
[1:54:44.580 --> 1:54:48.420]  about food food food for a long time we've talked about how it's gonna save
[1:54:48.420 --> 1:54:53.620]  your bacon but I've got to tell you before you even think about the food you
[1:54:53.620 --> 1:54:59.340]  have to watch fall of the Republic because what Alex has done with this
[1:54:59.340 --> 1:55:04.420]  thing is an a masterful job of summarizing all of the garbage that's
[1:55:04.420 --> 1:55:08.940]  being thrown at us in such a way that you can see exactly how it's going to
[1:55:08.940 --> 1:55:14.580]  affect you exactly what you need to do and then realize that every nation that
[1:55:14.580 --> 1:55:17.820]  has been come under the that has come under the thumb of the New World Order
[1:55:17.820 --> 1:55:24.140]  has done it because people weren't able to sustain themselves and resist the
[1:55:24.140 --> 1:55:28.980]  way that we're facing resistance with our own troops over there is the fact
[1:55:28.980 --> 1:55:33.700]  that these people Saddam Hussein and some of the other leaders tell their
[1:55:33.700 --> 1:55:37.380]  people to get food in well we're telling you the same thing but the first thing
[1:55:37.380 --> 1:55:40.700]  you got to do is get your head on straight and realize that what Alex is
[1:55:40.700 --> 1:55:45.900]  telling you is a summary of what's gonna happen in this country it's prophecy
[1:55:45.900 --> 1:55:49.860]  almost well we're going off their own battle plans their own statements but
[1:55:49.860 --> 1:55:54.340]  that's a good way to put it fall the Republic is a briefing it's a two hour
[1:55:54.340 --> 1:55:59.460]  24 minute the only pitfall is for the average mind-numb person they may not
[1:55:59.460 --> 1:56:04.180]  have the attention span but get them to watch it in two parts and there's an
[1:56:04.180 --> 1:56:07.780]  online bibliography at fallrepublic.com all the different articles we use
[1:56:07.780 --> 1:56:12.100]  curtain emma link to quite a few of them it's not as detailed as the what is the
[1:56:12.100 --> 1:56:16.460]  endgame.com bibliography for endgame we've just been so busy but the point
[1:56:16.460 --> 1:56:20.540]  is they can watch this film and then finally understand the left right
[1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:24.900]  paradigm see how the scam works see who the enemies are well regardless Steve
[1:56:24.900 --> 1:56:28.340]  thank you for all your support thank you for putting on high quality food this
[1:56:28.340 --> 1:56:32.900]  new line of the new traversal foods is amazing people should at least go read

[1:57:00.780 --> 1:57:04.340]  breathing bracing myself to march up this mountain with these two stacks of
[1:57:04.340 --> 1:57:07.820]  news I've got they're all off the charts but I wanted to go out to break with
[1:57:07.820 --> 1:57:12.340]  sundown on the Union you're going to make the decision on whether or not the
[1:57:12.340 --> 1:57:18.180]  globalists are successful in bringing down the Republic here's Bob Dylan
[1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:45.340]  yeah
[1:57:45.340 --> 1:57:51.340]  All the union and what's made in the USA
[1:57:51.340 --> 1:58:01.340]  Sure was a good idea till we got in the way
[1:58:01.340 --> 1:58:16.340]  When it's hit places from Hong Kong and it pearls out from Japan
[1:58:16.340 --> 1:58:25.340]  When the dark colors from India and the flower pots from Pakistan
[1:58:25.340 --> 1:58:32.340]  Are the front of turrets that made in Brazil
[1:58:32.340 --> 1:58:35.340]  Well, one man she slayed for sure

[2:00:43.340 --> 2:00:46.340]  We'll also be posting his website up on screen
[2:00:46.340 --> 2:00:51.340]  I need to mail him a copy of the DVD because he's a big part of it
[2:00:51.340 --> 2:00:54.340]  Follow The Republic is now out at Drop Yesterday

[2:00:57.340 --> 2:01:00.340]  Gerald Salente, it is great to have you here
[2:01:00.340 --> 2:01:04.340]  I want to talk about the dollar, I want to get into what's happening with gold
[2:01:04.340 --> 2:01:07.340]  I want to get into what's happening with the police
[2:01:07.340 --> 2:01:12.340]  And the government trying, like you said years ago, to raise all these taxes in the middle of a depression
[2:01:12.340 --> 2:01:15.340]  The media lying saying we're in a jobless recovery
[2:01:15.340 --> 2:01:19.340]  I remember you a year ago on this show saying they would call it a jobless recovery
[2:01:19.340 --> 2:01:23.340]  And I guess they stole your term because that's what they're saying
[2:01:23.340 --> 2:01:25.340]  We're going to discuss it all today
[2:01:25.340 --> 2:01:28.340]  What's most important on Gerald Salente's plate?
[2:01:28.340 --> 2:01:30.340]  What do you want to talk about out of the gates?
[2:01:30.340 --> 2:01:35.340]  Well, at first I'd like to talk about your new DVD
[2:01:35.340 --> 2:01:39.340]  And the impact that you're making all over the world
[2:01:39.340 --> 2:01:44.340]  As being a leader in the Second American Revolution
[2:01:44.340 --> 2:01:48.340]  Because the Second American Revolution has begun
[2:01:48.340 --> 2:01:54.340]  And it began with the Tea Parties and the tax process in April 15
[2:01:54.340 --> 2:01:59.340]  It accelerated with the rallies and protests on the 4th of July
[2:01:59.340 --> 2:02:04.340]  With people screaming for taxation without representation
[2:02:04.340 --> 2:02:06.340]  Or against it, I should say
[2:02:06.340 --> 2:02:12.340]  And also it hit another new high with all of these town hall meetings
[2:02:12.340 --> 2:02:19.340]  When people came out, it was more about, again, big government than the health care program
[2:02:19.340 --> 2:02:25.340]  And then we saw the rally against big government on September 12
[2:02:25.340 --> 2:02:31.340]  In Washington when nearly a million people, according to whose reports you believe
[2:02:31.340 --> 2:02:34.340]  And we don't know what to believe, but there are a lot of people
[2:02:34.340 --> 2:02:38.340]  And so really the Second American Revolution has begun
[2:02:38.340 --> 2:02:41.340]  And you're a prominent voice in it
[2:02:41.340 --> 2:02:44.340]  And I'm thrilled to also be a part of it
[2:02:44.340 --> 2:02:51.340]  Because the direction we're going in now is leading the country down a path
[2:02:51.340 --> 2:02:55.340]  And the people are calling it socialism
[2:02:55.340 --> 2:02:58.340]  And we're making it clear that this isn't socialism
[2:02:58.340 --> 2:03:05.340]  The merger of state and corporate powers is clearly, as Mussolini said, fascism
[2:03:05.340 --> 2:03:08.340]  And fascism has come to America
[2:03:08.340 --> 2:03:11.340]  This whole myth of the too big to fails
[2:03:11.340 --> 2:03:16.340]  Who made this story up and the banks gaining more and more control
[2:03:16.340 --> 2:03:21.340]  Buying out all the weaker financial institutions
[2:03:21.340 --> 2:03:28.340]  Bringing their strength together as oligopolies to take over this nation
[2:03:28.340 --> 2:03:31.340]  And we're just seeing more and more of it
[2:03:31.340 --> 2:03:35.340]  But the whole world also is seeing what's going on as you're talking about
[2:03:35.340 --> 2:03:38.340]  With the decline of the dollar
[2:03:38.340 --> 2:03:41.340]  And people should be very aware of this
[2:03:41.340 --> 2:03:47.340]  Because we're very concerned that they're going to call a bank holiday as things get worse
[2:03:47.340 --> 2:03:51.340]  You see the dollar now? Is it a dollar fifty against the euro?
[2:03:51.340 --> 2:03:56.340]  You know, they're talking about Alex, how the Dow at ten thousand, how people are
[2:03:56.340 --> 2:03:59.340]  Oh, how wonderful it is, Dow ten thousand
[2:03:59.340 --> 2:04:03.340]  Well, when the Dow first hit ten thousand ten years ago
[2:04:03.340 --> 2:04:08.340]  The unemployment rate, the official unemployment rate was about four point two percent
[2:04:08.340 --> 2:04:13.340]  Now the official unemployment rate is what, nine point eight percent
[2:04:13.340 --> 2:04:18.340]  And you saw the numbers came out today again about five hundred, what, thirty thousand people
[2:04:18.340 --> 2:04:21.340]  On unemployment
[2:04:21.340 --> 2:04:27.340]  And then the barrel of oil back then, ten years ago
[2:04:27.340 --> 2:04:30.340]  Was selling for under sixteen dollars a barrel
[2:04:30.340 --> 2:04:33.340]  What's it selling for now? Eighty dollars
[2:04:33.340 --> 2:04:38.340]  They're devaluing the dollar, they're going to make us all poorer
[2:04:38.340 --> 2:04:42.340]  Absolutely, I want to talk about where you see the revolution going
[2:04:42.340 --> 2:04:46.340]  Because I remember several years ago, you predicted we were going to have the crash
[2:04:46.340 --> 2:04:49.340]  They were going to raise taxes in the midst of it
[2:04:49.340 --> 2:04:53.340]  People would start demonstrating, the government will ignore that
[2:04:53.340 --> 2:04:55.340]  And then it will then build you ahead
[2:04:55.340 --> 2:05:00.340]  We're going to talk about a lot of issues with Gerald Salente when we come right back, stay with us
[2:05:26.340 --> 2:05:29.340]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers
[2:05:29.340 --> 2:05:31.340]  And even keep food from spoiling
[2:05:31.340 --> 2:05:34.340]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts
[2:05:34.340 --> 2:05:37.340]  You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[2:05:37.340 --> 2:05:40.340]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready

[2:08:04.340 --> 2:08:07.340]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[2:08:14.340 --> 2:08:17.340]  Gerald Salente, top trans forecaster in the country
[2:08:17.340 --> 2:08:20.340]  Has made hundreds of spot-on predictions
[2:08:20.340 --> 2:08:23.340]  More than two years ago, charted exactly
[2:08:23.340 --> 2:08:25.340]  What was going to happen with the economy
[2:08:25.340 --> 2:08:28.340]  The bank implosions, the consolidation of power
[2:08:28.340 --> 2:08:31.340]  The looting, the unfolding police state
[2:08:31.340 --> 2:08:33.340]  And the building revolution
[2:08:33.340 --> 2:08:35.340]  The establishment knows they've got a revolution on their hands
[2:08:35.340 --> 2:08:37.340]  That's why they're saying they're going to deploy
[2:08:37.340 --> 2:08:40.340]  379,000 homeland security troops
[2:08:40.340 --> 2:08:43.340]  From the Army and Marine Corps and Air Force
[2:08:43.340 --> 2:08:45.340]  In the United States in the next two years
[2:08:45.340 --> 2:08:48.340]  They're suddenly popping up everywhere conditioning the public
[2:08:48.340 --> 2:08:51.340]  They're openly announcing bank of the world global carbon taxes
[2:08:51.340 --> 2:08:54.340]  States and cities and counties and the feds are passing
[2:08:54.340 --> 2:08:58.340]  All these new taxes, Obama has been breaking every promise
[2:08:58.340 --> 2:09:00.340]  All of this is coming to a head
[2:09:00.340 --> 2:09:03.340]  You predicted the Tea Parties
[2:09:03.340 --> 2:09:07.340]  You called them taxpayer, bush, brush fire, rebellions
[2:09:07.340 --> 2:09:09.340]  Were some of the terms you used
[2:09:09.340 --> 2:09:12.340]  You said two years ago, when I was reading what you were
[2:09:12.340 --> 2:09:16.340]  When we first started getting you on, that those would be ignored
[2:09:16.340 --> 2:09:20.340]  And that by 2012, everything would melt down
[2:09:20.340 --> 2:09:23.340]  Expand now, we're now two years later
[2:09:23.340 --> 2:09:27.340]  Your forecast, unfortunately, is about 99% accurate
[2:09:27.340 --> 2:09:30.340]  Even better than my 95% accuracy
[2:09:30.340 --> 2:09:32.340]  And I really do chart my accuracy
[2:09:32.340 --> 2:09:35.340]  Let us into your brain, Gerald Salente
[2:09:35.340 --> 2:09:37.340]  What's happening next?
[2:09:37.340 --> 2:09:39.340]  Is what we're concerned about next
[2:09:39.340 --> 2:09:42.340]  As you know, we just published the Autumn Trends Journal
[2:09:42.340 --> 2:09:46.340]  And now we're working on the top trends for 2010
[2:09:46.340 --> 2:09:50.340]  What we're most concerned about, Alex, is what we're calling
[2:09:50.340 --> 2:09:54.340]  Terra 2010
[2:09:54.340 --> 2:10:00.340]  We're forecasting that there is a very high probability
[2:10:00.340 --> 2:10:04.340]  Of a major terror strike against the United States
[2:10:04.340 --> 2:10:08.340]  And among the reasons why it's going to happen
[2:10:08.340 --> 2:10:12.340]  Is what's going on right now in Pakistan
[2:10:12.340 --> 2:10:15.340]  And most people, of course, aren't aware
[2:10:15.340 --> 2:10:20.340]  Of the United States' policy of increasing that war
[2:10:20.340 --> 2:10:22.340]  To a much greater extent now
[2:10:22.340 --> 2:10:27.340]  Than it's ever been on the Afghan-Pakistan border
[2:10:27.340 --> 2:10:29.340]  Gerald, let me interrupt
[2:10:29.340 --> 2:10:31.340]  You also predicted 9-11
[2:10:31.340 --> 2:10:33.340]  So people better pay attention to what you're saying
[2:10:33.340 --> 2:10:35.340]  Actually, they can go
[2:10:35.340 --> 2:10:40.340]  Could Google my name, Salente, USA Today
[2:10:40.340 --> 2:10:43.340]  December 14, 2000
[2:10:43.340 --> 2:10:45.340]  And the headline read
[2:10:45.340 --> 2:10:49.340]  2001 Won't Be Our Year Trends Here Says
[2:10:49.340 --> 2:10:52.340]  We said that Americans wouldn't be safe at home
[2:10:52.340 --> 2:10:54.340]  Or abroad in 2001
[2:10:54.340 --> 2:10:56.340]  And right now, what's going on now
[2:10:56.340 --> 2:11:02.340]  Is that Pakistan has launched a major, major offensive
[2:11:02.340 --> 2:11:05.340]  In South Waziristan
[2:11:05.340 --> 2:11:09.340]  A couple of months ago, they were in the Swat Valley
[2:11:09.340 --> 2:11:12.340]  And every time that the Pakistani army
[2:11:12.340 --> 2:11:16.340]  And Pakistan has to be one of the most corrupt nations on earth
[2:11:16.340 --> 2:11:20.340]  And they're being funded, of course, by the United States
[2:11:20.340 --> 2:11:25.340]  The president, Zidari, he was called Mr. 10%
[2:11:25.340 --> 2:11:28.340]  He was the husband of Buto
[2:11:28.340 --> 2:11:30.340]  Who was assassinated
[2:11:30.340 --> 2:11:34.340]  Mr. 10% because he took 10% of all the action
[2:11:34.340 --> 2:11:36.340]  That went on in the government
[2:11:36.340 --> 2:11:38.340]  He's now the president
[2:11:38.340 --> 2:11:42.340]  And what's going on is that the anti-Americanism
[2:11:42.340 --> 2:11:44.340]  Sweeping through Pakistan
[2:11:44.340 --> 2:11:46.340]  I mentioned the Swat Valley
[2:11:46.340 --> 2:11:50.340]  It was the biggest amount of people
[2:11:50.340 --> 2:11:54.340]  Displaced since Rwanda
[2:11:54.340 --> 2:11:57.340]  Just a month ago, with 3 million refugees
[2:11:57.340 --> 2:12:00.340]  And now the same thing is happening once again
[2:12:00.340 --> 2:12:03.340]  In South Waziristan
[2:12:03.340 --> 2:12:06.340]  So the anti-Americanism sweeping through
[2:12:06.340 --> 2:12:09.340]  The Middle East is at an all-time high
[2:12:09.340 --> 2:12:13.340]  And now it's also, of course, going on in Iran
[2:12:13.340 --> 2:12:16.340]  Again, current events form future trends
[2:12:16.340 --> 2:12:18.340]  We just saw last Sunday
[2:12:18.340 --> 2:12:22.340]  That several Iranian and National Guard
[2:12:22.340 --> 2:12:26.340]  The Republican Guard were killed in a suicide attempt
[2:12:26.340 --> 2:12:30.340]  That Iran is blaming on the United States and Israel
[2:12:30.340 --> 2:12:33.340]  So we're concerned that there's going to be
[2:12:33.340 --> 2:12:36.340]  A terrorist strike against the United States
[2:12:36.340 --> 2:12:38.340]  False flag are real
[2:12:38.340 --> 2:12:40.340]  We're saying something is going to happen
[2:12:40.340 --> 2:12:43.340]  Very major in this field in 2010
[2:12:43.340 --> 2:12:46.340]  So now we take it again as trend forecasters
[2:12:46.340 --> 2:12:48.340]  What does that mean?
[2:12:48.340 --> 2:12:50.340]  Good excuses to close the bank
[2:12:50.340 --> 2:12:54.340]  We're getting emails from all over the world, Alex
[2:12:54.340 --> 2:12:59.340]  And from top people that are seeing very clearly
[2:12:59.340 --> 2:13:03.340]  That the United States' strategy is to devalue the dollar
[2:13:03.340 --> 2:13:07.340]  So that they pay back this massive loan with cheap money
[2:13:07.340 --> 2:13:10.340]  It's like you loaning me a hundred dollars
[2:13:10.340 --> 2:13:12.340]  And then all of a sudden that hundred dollars
[2:13:12.340 --> 2:13:15.340]  Only being worth ten cents
[2:13:15.340 --> 2:13:17.340]  And I pay you back ten cents
[2:13:17.340 --> 2:13:20.340]  When you loaned it to me, it was worth a hundred bucks
[2:13:20.340 --> 2:13:22.340]  Gerald, I want to stop you again
[2:13:22.340 --> 2:13:24.340]  And that's key what you just mentioned
[2:13:24.340 --> 2:13:28.340]  On the record, the Bank of England, the Private Federal Reserve
[2:13:28.340 --> 2:13:31.340]  They're both partners, as you know, but for listeners that may not
[2:13:31.340 --> 2:13:35.340]  They are the ones openly killing the dollar, bad-mouthing it
[2:13:35.340 --> 2:13:37.340]  Making all the decisions to kill it
[2:13:37.340 --> 2:13:42.340]  It's their G20 meeting and saying we need to phase it out, devalue it
[2:13:42.340 --> 2:13:46.340]  Go to SDRs as an above-country currency, bank to bank
[2:13:46.340 --> 2:13:49.340]  And then they'll control all the different currencies of the world
[2:13:49.340 --> 2:13:53.340]  They're going to engage in more insider trading, more consolidation of wealth criminally
[2:13:53.340 --> 2:13:57.340]  With their insider knowledge and control, their regulatory control
[2:13:57.340 --> 2:14:03.340]  The made-off-type, Kinley-type criminals running the global regulatory system
[2:14:03.340 --> 2:14:06.340]  That has now already been built, but now being unveiled
[2:14:06.340 --> 2:14:08.340]  They are killing it
[2:14:08.340 --> 2:14:11.340]  Meanwhile, our media tells us the Arabs are killing it
[2:14:11.340 --> 2:14:13.340]  When the Russians, the Chinese, the Arabs are saying
[2:14:13.340 --> 2:14:15.340]  We all hold trillions of your dollars
[2:14:15.340 --> 2:14:17.340]  Why are you ripping us off?
[2:14:17.340 --> 2:14:20.340]  Why are you devaluing this when you asked us to buy it?
[2:14:20.340 --> 2:14:23.340]  And the United States admits
[2:14:23.340 --> 2:14:26.340]  The last White House in the new one admits they're running Jundala
[2:14:26.340 --> 2:14:29.340]  That's blowing up military bases and police stations
[2:14:29.340 --> 2:14:31.340]  To get the Iranians to attack back
[2:14:31.340 --> 2:14:35.340]  They admit they're escalating the war in Pakistan and Afghanistan
[2:14:35.340 --> 2:14:40.340]  To elicit real resistance, which they're then going to call terrorism
[2:14:40.340 --> 2:14:45.340]  Used to launch a wider war and domestically crack down on the population
[2:14:45.340 --> 2:14:48.340]  So for people to see an accurate map and tell me if you agree
[2:14:48.340 --> 2:14:50.340]  Don't see the world as nations
[2:14:50.340 --> 2:14:54.340]  We now have these global corporations that control the UN and the central banks
[2:14:54.340 --> 2:15:00.340]  And they are playing nations and groups off against each other to consolidate the power
[2:15:00.340 --> 2:15:03.340]  Well said, I agree with everything that you said
[2:15:03.340 --> 2:15:07.340]  And that's precisely what's going on
[2:15:07.340 --> 2:15:10.340]  And what the American people have to understand
[2:15:10.340 --> 2:15:15.340]  Is that as the dollar devalues, and of course this trend has been going on for a long time
[2:15:15.340 --> 2:15:19.340]  As I mentioned, when we talk about Dow 10,000
[2:15:19.340 --> 2:15:22.340]  When we went back to 1999, since that time
[2:15:22.340 --> 2:15:27.340]  Well, you could buy a Euro, for example, for 95 cents
[2:15:27.340 --> 2:15:31.340]  Now it's going to cost you $1.50
[2:15:31.340 --> 2:15:36.340]  And back then you could buy an ounce of gold for $280
[2:15:36.340 --> 2:15:38.340]  So you're saying the stock market's really down
[2:15:38.340 --> 2:15:41.340]  You're just buying it with the value of dollars so it looks like it's more
[2:15:41.340 --> 2:15:43.340]  Exactly, an ounce of gold now
[2:15:43.340 --> 2:15:47.340]  Of course, what, $1,060
[2:15:47.340 --> 2:15:53.340]  So what the people are doing is they're lowering the standard of living for everyone
[2:15:53.340 --> 2:15:58.340]  The gap between the 1% owning more of assets
[2:15:58.340 --> 2:16:04.340]  Has never been higher in the 20th century than it is now
[2:16:04.340 --> 2:16:14.340]  So they're pushing everybody down into poverty as the money is going up to the top to the very few
[2:16:14.340 --> 2:16:18.340]  And about the jobless recovery that we talk about
[2:16:18.340 --> 2:16:22.340]  72% of our GDP is consumer based
[2:16:22.340 --> 2:16:25.340]  Again, we saw the numbers coming out today
[2:16:25.340 --> 2:16:28.340]  The unemployment rate continues to rise
[2:16:28.340 --> 2:16:31.340]  The amount of new people looking for unemployment
[2:16:31.340 --> 2:16:35.340]  The jobless recovery is like being almost pregnant
[2:16:35.340 --> 2:16:37.340]  You can't, it doesn't happen
[2:16:37.340 --> 2:16:39.340]  There's no such thing
[2:16:39.340 --> 2:16:42.340]  And when you go back to the glass depression
[2:16:42.340 --> 2:16:44.340]  You read the history of it
[2:16:44.340 --> 2:16:47.340]  They were doing the same kind of drive talk back then
[2:16:47.340 --> 2:16:49.340]  They would rush the market up
[2:16:49.340 --> 2:16:51.340]  They sucker the people into it
[2:16:51.340 --> 2:16:53.340]  The market would collapse
[2:16:53.340 --> 2:16:57.340]  And they would talk about the recovery being just around the corner
[2:16:57.340 --> 2:17:01.340]  For three years until they admitted we were really in a big depression
[2:17:01.340 --> 2:17:05.340]  How long will the yoyoing go in your opinion?
[2:17:05.340 --> 2:17:12.340]  Well, it will continue for probably, we think
[2:17:12.340 --> 2:17:15.340]  The real numbers are going to come out in December
[2:17:15.340 --> 2:17:19.340]  When this Christmas retail sales are a bust
[2:17:19.340 --> 2:17:22.340]  So when by the second quarter around March
[2:17:22.340 --> 2:17:25.340]  When reality hits, February, March
[2:17:25.340 --> 2:17:27.340]  As it did this year
[2:17:27.340 --> 2:17:29.340]  When the markets collapsed
[2:17:29.340 --> 2:17:31.340]  They can't hide it anymore
[2:17:31.340 --> 2:17:34.340]  But what happens is what we're concerned about
[2:17:34.340 --> 2:17:37.340]  Again, it's either false, flag or real
[2:17:37.340 --> 2:17:40.340]  They're going to divert the people's attention
[2:17:40.340 --> 2:17:43.340]  And we're saying Terra 2010
[2:17:43.340 --> 2:17:46.340]  So they keep playing the yoyo
[2:17:46.340 --> 2:17:49.340]  By throwing new games into the mix
[2:17:49.340 --> 2:17:52.340]  So they'll have the people's attention diverted
[2:17:52.340 --> 2:17:55.340]  Look what happened, people forget Alex
[2:17:55.340 --> 2:17:59.340]  That before 9-11 how unpopular George Bush was
[2:17:59.340 --> 2:18:01.340]  And then they got this guy
[2:18:01.340 --> 2:18:03.340]  That couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag
[2:18:03.340 --> 2:18:05.340]  Who's going to tell everybody
[2:18:05.340 --> 2:18:08.340]  He's going to hunt down Osama bin Laden, dead or alive
[2:18:08.340 --> 2:18:11.340]  The whole nation followed him after 9-11
[2:18:11.340 --> 2:18:15.340]  The same kind of scenario could happen now
[2:18:15.340 --> 2:18:17.340]  Well, that's what the Rand Corporation is saying
[2:18:17.340 --> 2:18:20.340]  That they need a big war to get their new world order
[2:18:20.340 --> 2:18:23.340]  Gerald, I want to shift back to an earlier subject
[2:18:23.340 --> 2:18:27.340]  How do you see the rebellion against this manifesting?
[2:18:27.340 --> 2:18:31.340]  You called it taxpayer rebellions, demonstrations, rallies
[2:18:31.340 --> 2:18:34.340]  Two years ago, getting bigger and bigger
[2:18:34.340 --> 2:18:37.340]  You predicted the term jobless recovery
[2:18:37.340 --> 2:18:39.340]  A year and a half ago
[2:18:39.340 --> 2:18:41.340]  I mean, I want to ask you, Gerald
[2:18:41.340 --> 2:18:45.340]  How did you specifically even pick the bogus term?
[2:18:45.340 --> 2:18:47.340]  How did you know they were going to come up with that?
[2:18:47.340 --> 2:18:50.340]  They play with that term from time to time
[2:18:50.340 --> 2:18:52.340]  Every time they get into trouble over the past
[2:18:52.340 --> 2:18:54.340]  They play out these terms
[2:18:54.340 --> 2:18:58.340]  And what they do is they do it to divert people's attention
[2:18:58.340 --> 2:19:01.340]  Alex, I want to make this 100% clear
[2:19:01.340 --> 2:19:04.340]  The jobs that are gone are gone forever
[2:19:04.340 --> 2:19:06.340]  They're not coming back
[2:19:06.340 --> 2:19:09.340]  They've shipped our production overseas
[2:19:09.340 --> 2:19:12.340]  You look around, go anywhere you want to go
[2:19:12.340 --> 2:19:14.340]  Where are their jobs?
[2:19:14.340 --> 2:19:18.340]  Do you want a job at a checkout counter at 7-Eleven?
[2:19:18.340 --> 2:19:21.340]  Do you want a wonderful position as a home health care?
[2:19:21.340 --> 2:19:23.340]  How about working in a nursing home?
[2:19:23.340 --> 2:19:26.340]  There's going to be plenty of jobs for you
[2:19:26.340 --> 2:19:29.340]  They're dumbing down the society
[2:19:29.340 --> 2:19:32.340]  The jobs that are left are among the worst
[2:19:32.340 --> 2:19:35.340]  And when you look when there's only job creation
[2:19:35.340 --> 2:19:37.340]  Where is it?
[2:19:37.340 --> 2:19:39.340]  Well, it's in government jobs
[2:19:39.340 --> 2:19:41.340]  It's in home health care
[2:19:41.340 --> 2:19:44.340]  And it's in the hospitality sector
[2:19:44.340 --> 2:19:46.340]  But that's not even going to happen anymore
[2:19:46.340 --> 2:19:49.340]  So the jobs that are gone are gone for good
[2:19:49.340 --> 2:19:52.340]  Stay there, because I want to ask you next
[2:19:52.340 --> 2:19:57.340]  More police, more tickets, more fines, more fees, more taxes
[2:19:57.340 --> 2:20:22.340]  How do they squeeze more blood out of the population?
[2:20:27.340 --> 2:20:53.340]  How do they squeeze more blood out of the population?
[2:20:53.340 --> 2:21:05.340]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain?
[2:21:05.340 --> 2:21:12.340]  High blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heart beats, clogged arteries
[2:21:12.340 --> 2:21:14.340]  If so, you are not alone
[2:21:14.340 --> 2:21:18.340]  Millions of people are suffering from one or more of these problems
[2:21:18.340 --> 2:21:25.340]  If you'd like to live your life free of sickness, pain and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy and youthfulness
[2:21:25.340 --> 2:21:28.340]  And experience your body healing itself

[2:24:01.340 --> 2:24:04.340]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation
[2:24:04.340 --> 2:24:08.340]  It's Alex Jones only on the GCN radio network
[2:24:12.340 --> 2:24:14.340]  Gerald Salente
[2:24:15.340 --> 2:24:18.340]  The Republic is fading into history
[2:24:18.340 --> 2:24:21.340]  We've been fully conquered by offshore banks
[2:24:21.340 --> 2:24:24.340]  They in their own documents admit they create economic implosions
[2:24:24.340 --> 2:24:26.340]  So they can consolidate wealth
[2:24:26.340 --> 2:24:29.340]  They think their police state can protect them from the people
[2:24:29.340 --> 2:24:31.340]  So they can carry out this crime
[2:24:31.340 --> 2:24:34.340]  But you have said repeatedly and broken down the fact that
[2:24:34.340 --> 2:24:37.340]  That history shows it's not going to go that way
[2:24:37.340 --> 2:24:39.340]  Break down in summary, pleaser
[2:24:39.340 --> 2:24:43.340]  How you see this then unfolding in a chain of events
[2:24:43.340 --> 2:24:47.340]  What are the taxpayer revolts going to turn into
[2:24:47.340 --> 2:24:50.340]  As the system squeezes and squeezes and squeezes
[2:24:50.340 --> 2:24:54.340]  Well, we already have state and local governments
[2:24:54.340 --> 2:24:57.340]  Over $200 billion in the red
[2:24:57.340 --> 2:25:01.340]  And they're going to keep asking people for more and more taxes
[2:25:01.340 --> 2:25:05.340]  Right here in Kingston, New York where it just came out
[2:25:05.340 --> 2:25:08.340]  I don't know how true it is and not someone just called me today
[2:25:08.340 --> 2:25:12.340]  That they're going to look for a 10% increase in taxes
[2:25:12.340 --> 2:25:17.340]  So we're organizing our own local tax revolts right here
[2:25:17.340 --> 2:25:20.340]  And this is going to go on all over the country
[2:25:20.340 --> 2:25:23.340]  As you know my saying as a Bronx boy
[2:25:23.340 --> 2:25:26.340]  When people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose
[2:25:26.340 --> 2:25:30.340]  They lose it and people are now looking at government as the enemy
[2:25:30.340 --> 2:25:33.340]  More so than ever before
[2:25:33.340 --> 2:25:38.340]  So the tax protests we see are going to be the catalyst
[2:25:38.340 --> 2:25:42.340]  That drives the nation into the second revolution
[2:25:42.340 --> 2:25:44.340]  We're in it already
[2:25:44.340 --> 2:25:47.340]  The media is denying it and as you know
[2:25:47.340 --> 2:25:50.340]  They're attributing these protests et cetera
[2:25:50.340 --> 2:25:55.340]  To right wing fringe elements and conservative nuts
[2:25:55.340 --> 2:25:58.340]  That's the way they like to paint it
[2:25:58.340 --> 2:26:00.340]  There's nothing to do with that
[2:26:00.340 --> 2:26:03.340]  These are people that have fed up and they have nothing to lose
[2:26:03.340 --> 2:26:07.340]  So we're going to see it manifest itself again with the tax revolts
[2:26:07.340 --> 2:26:09.340]  Then the winter comes
[2:26:09.340 --> 2:26:11.340]  And around much of the country
[2:26:11.340 --> 2:26:18.340]  People are going to be unable to afford to buy home heating fuel or gas
[2:26:18.340 --> 2:26:22.340]  They're not going to start seeing particularly among the elderly
[2:26:22.340 --> 2:26:30.340]  Now we have to understand why is oil prices going up so high
[2:26:30.340 --> 2:26:35.340]  Well it has less to do with demand and more to do going back again
[2:26:35.340 --> 2:26:38.340]  To the devaluation of the dollar
[2:26:38.340 --> 2:26:41.340]  Oil as everyone knows is petrodollars
[2:26:41.340 --> 2:26:45.340]  And with the dollar losing value oil prices keep going up
[2:26:45.340 --> 2:26:47.340]  So that's what we're going to see
[2:26:47.340 --> 2:26:51.340]  Now I want to throw one other thing on here as well
[2:26:51.340 --> 2:26:55.340]  We saw Obama come out and tell the elderly
[2:26:55.340 --> 2:26:58.340]  That because of the cost of living index has gone down
[2:26:58.340 --> 2:27:00.340]  And remained flat
[2:27:00.340 --> 2:27:04.340]  That they're going to give them $250 each to help them along
[2:27:04.340 --> 2:27:09.340]  Well $250 as we all know in the real world is chump change
[2:27:09.340 --> 2:27:11.340]  Not worth anything
[2:27:11.340 --> 2:27:14.340]  It's going to cost the government about $13 billion
[2:27:14.340 --> 2:27:17.340]  Aren't they generous with the elderly?
[2:27:17.340 --> 2:27:23.340]  $13 billion is a weave the people gave to the Goldman Sachs gang
[2:27:23.340 --> 2:27:28.340]  To cover their losses that they took on bed bets with AIG
[2:27:28.340 --> 2:27:31.340]  What an insult to the American people
[2:27:31.340 --> 2:27:37.340]  And this is where the inflammation is going to start rising
[2:27:37.340 --> 2:27:40.340]  It's going to be off with their heads before they know it
[2:27:40.340 --> 2:27:44.340]  They're so out of touch with what's going on in the street
[2:27:44.340 --> 2:27:47.340]  That they think they could chump the people with
[2:27:47.340 --> 2:27:52.340]  Let them eat take $250 pay off
[2:27:52.340 --> 2:27:55.340]  So that's how we see this thing playing out
[2:27:55.340 --> 2:27:59.340]  We're going to see more and more people
[2:27:59.340 --> 2:28:01.340]  Turning against the government
[2:28:01.340 --> 2:28:04.340]  And what we're hoping and not hoping
[2:28:04.340 --> 2:28:09.340]  What we're suggesting is that this revolution cannot be hijacked
[2:28:09.340 --> 2:28:15.340]  By violence because if it does we lose
[2:28:15.340 --> 2:28:19.340]  And all you have to see is what happened at the G20 meetings
[2:28:19.340 --> 2:28:22.340]  When they called martial law in Pittsburgh
[2:28:22.340 --> 2:28:26.340]  Can you imagine closing down an entire city
[2:28:26.340 --> 2:28:30.340]  With 1.5 million people for 20 world leaders
[2:28:30.340 --> 2:28:33.340]  And saying you can't come out on the street
[2:28:33.340 --> 2:28:35.340]  And then attacking peaceful people
[2:28:35.340 --> 2:28:37.340]  They're looking for trouble
[2:28:37.340 --> 2:28:39.340]  They're looking to set the precedent
[2:28:39.340 --> 2:28:41.340]  Police dogs, biting old women, young girls
[2:28:41.340 --> 2:28:43.340]  Getting billy clubbed off bikes
[2:28:43.340 --> 2:28:45.340]  They want violence
[2:28:45.340 --> 2:28:46.340]  Exactly
[2:28:46.340 --> 2:28:50.340]  And you know as a close combat martial artist
[2:28:50.340 --> 2:28:54.340]  A leader walks without fear
[2:28:54.340 --> 2:28:58.340]  What kind of leaders do these people call themselves
[2:28:58.340 --> 2:29:01.340]  When they can't even step down to a crowd
[2:29:01.340 --> 2:29:03.340]  And have to close down the city
[2:29:03.340 --> 2:29:05.340]  What a disgrace
[2:29:05.340 --> 2:29:08.340]  If anybody believes in anything
[2:29:08.340 --> 2:29:12.340]  The founding fathers are turning in their graves
[2:29:12.340 --> 2:29:15.340]  At these little cowards that they call leaders
[2:29:15.340 --> 2:29:18.340]  And people are going to follow these leaders
[2:29:18.340 --> 2:29:20.340]  I talked to Jesse Ventura last week
[2:29:20.340 --> 2:29:23.340]  It's a video we've got up on infowars.com
[2:29:23.340 --> 2:29:25.340]  They made the point that last year
[2:29:25.340 --> 2:29:27.340]  At the Republican National Convention
[2:29:27.340 --> 2:29:30.340]  It was an armed camp, locked down much of the city
[2:29:30.340 --> 2:29:33.340]  They were acting like the public world terrorist
[2:29:33.340 --> 2:29:35.340]  Then at Ron Paul's event
[2:29:35.340 --> 2:29:38.340]  Couple cops, super light security
[2:29:38.340 --> 2:29:40.340]  Everybody had a great time
[2:29:40.340 --> 2:29:42.340]  I mean Saddam Hussein would walk around
[2:29:42.340 --> 2:29:45.340]  In a group of 10,000 people with AK-47s
[2:29:45.340 --> 2:29:48.340]  But in America, the foreign bankers come into town
[2:29:48.340 --> 2:29:51.340]  They lock the whole city down because they're the criminals
[2:29:51.340 --> 2:29:55.340]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run
[2:29:55.340 --> 2:30:21.340]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[2:30:59.340 --> 2:31:01.340]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[2:31:01.340 --> 2:31:03.340]  You should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:31:03.340 --> 2:31:05.340]  Number one, new climate legislation
[2:31:05.340 --> 2:31:07.340]  Could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:31:07.340 --> 2:31:09.340]  Number two, our new energies are
[2:31:09.340 --> 2:31:11.340]  Wants to control how much power
[2:31:11.340 --> 2:31:13.340]  Your electric company allows you to have
[2:31:13.340 --> 2:31:16.340]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[2:31:16.340 --> 2:31:19.340]  In the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:31:19.340 --> 2:31:21.340]  Number three, in some areas of the country
[2:31:21.340 --> 2:31:24.340]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:31:24.340 --> 2:31:26.340]  And now, new socialist legislation
[2:31:26.340 --> 2:31:28.340]  Is only compounding the problem
[2:31:28.340 --> 2:31:30.340]  Number four, dangerous weather
[2:31:30.340 --> 2:31:32.340]  Is always a threat to local grids
[2:31:32.340 --> 2:31:34.340]  Every year, thousands of families
[2:31:34.340 --> 2:31:36.340]  Lose their power from weather-related onages
[2:31:36.340 --> 2:31:38.340]  Number five, a solar power generator
[2:31:38.340 --> 2:31:41.340]  Provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[2:31:41.340 --> 2:31:43.340]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[2:31:43.340 --> 2:31:45.340]  Offered by Solutions from Science
[2:31:45.340 --> 2:31:47.340]  One of my oldest sponsors

[2:31:50.340 --> 2:31:52.340]  That's www.mysolarbackup.com
[2:31:52.340 --> 2:31:54.340]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun
[2:31:54.340 --> 2:31:56.340]  So go to www.mysolarbackup.com
[2:31:56.340 --> 2:32:22.340]  Or call 1-877-327-0365
[2:32:27.340 --> 2:32:29.340]  This book truly has the information
[2:32:29.340 --> 2:32:31.340]  That can make you wealthy
[2:32:31.340 --> 2:32:33.340]  And it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well
[2:32:33.340 --> 2:32:35.340]  You know the government isn't looking out for you
[2:32:35.340 --> 2:32:37.340]  You need to look out for yourself
[2:32:37.340 --> 2:32:39.340]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse
[2:32:39.340 --> 2:32:41.340]  You must prepare and make sure
[2:32:41.340 --> 2:32:43.340]  You are able to financially take care of yourself
[2:32:43.340 --> 2:32:44.340]  And your loved ones

[2:32:47.340 --> 2:32:48.340]  And start today

[2:32:51.340 --> 2:32:53.340]  That's www.here'swhatyoudo.net
[2:32:53.340 --> 2:32:54.340]  One last time
[2:32:54.340 --> 2:32:56.340]  It's www.here'swhatyoudo.net
[2:32:56.340 --> 2:32:58.340]  www.here'swhatyoudo.net
[2:32:58.340 --> 2:33:02.340]  www.here'swhatyoudo.net
[2:33:22.340 --> 2:33:24.340]  We're going back to Gerald Solente
[2:33:24.340 --> 2:33:26.340]  In just one moment
[2:33:26.340 --> 2:33:28.340]  I want to commend all the listeners
[2:33:28.340 --> 2:33:29.340]  For hitting the ground running
[2:33:29.340 --> 2:33:32.340]  And follow the Republic at www.prisonplanet.tv
[2:33:32.340 --> 2:33:34.340]  You support the explosion
[2:33:34.340 --> 2:33:35.340]  And the alternative media
[2:33:35.340 --> 2:33:37.340]  There's no doubt that we are at the tip of the spear
[2:33:37.340 --> 2:33:39.340]  With Gerald Solente and many others
[2:33:39.340 --> 2:33:42.340]  In shattering a left-right paradigm
[2:33:42.340 --> 2:33:45.340]  Because the establishment loves to divide and conquer us
[2:33:45.340 --> 2:33:47.340]  And play parties off against each other
[2:33:47.340 --> 2:33:49.340]  When the Republicans and Democrats
[2:33:49.340 --> 2:33:52.340]  Are equally part of the same Wall Street gang robbing us
[2:33:52.340 --> 2:33:55.340]  And we'll talk to Gerald Solente about that
[2:33:55.340 --> 2:33:58.340]  This film that has Jesse Ventura, Gerald Solente
[2:33:58.340 --> 2:34:02.340]  Webster Tarpley, Alan Watt, John Perkins
[2:34:02.340 --> 2:34:06.340]  Professor Black, Dr. Bob Bowman
[2:34:06.340 --> 2:34:11.340]  Myself, Professor Boyle
[2:34:11.340 --> 2:34:15.340]  The list goes on and on and on
[2:34:15.340 --> 2:34:18.340]  And we went to the tent cities
[2:34:18.340 --> 2:34:21.340]  We, in Northern California
[2:34:21.340 --> 2:34:23.340]  We traveled so much, put this together
[2:34:23.340 --> 2:34:24.340]  It breaks down who the bankers are
[2:34:24.340 --> 2:34:26.340]  What their battle plan is
[2:34:26.340 --> 2:34:28.340]  From their own documents and statements
[2:34:28.340 --> 2:34:30.340]  What they're planning to do in the future
[2:34:30.340 --> 2:34:31.340]  How they've committed crimes
[2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:33.340]  And how we either bring them to justice
[2:34:33.340 --> 2:34:35.340]  Because they're criminals
[2:34:35.340 --> 2:34:37.340]  Or we allow them to take their Ponzi scheme
[2:34:37.340 --> 2:34:40.340]  To the next level, worldwide tyranny
[2:34:40.340 --> 2:34:42.340]  And then to the next scam, the next
[2:34:42.340 --> 2:34:44.340]  The carbon tax, the control, the police state,
[2:34:44.340 --> 2:34:47.340]  The citizen spies, it is
[2:34:47.340 --> 2:34:50.340]  Fall of the Republic
[2:34:50.340 --> 2:34:52.340]  I suggest you get it on DVD
[2:34:52.340 --> 2:34:54.340]  For high quality, highest quality
[2:34:54.340 --> 2:34:57.340]  Two hours and 24 minutes
[2:34:57.340 --> 2:34:59.340]  30 plus minutes of extras
[2:34:59.340 --> 2:35:01.340]  Or right at 30 minutes of extras
[2:35:01.340 --> 2:35:02.340]  If you're going to spend the time watching it
[2:35:02.340 --> 2:35:04.340]  Making copies, giving it out to people
[2:35:04.340 --> 2:35:06.340]  The best way is to order the DVDs
[2:35:06.340 --> 2:35:08.340]  At infowars.com
[2:35:08.340 --> 2:35:14.340]  Or call toll-free 888-2533139-888-2533139
[2:35:14.340 --> 2:35:15.340]  You can also write to me
[2:35:15.340 --> 2:35:16.340]  They're $19.95 a piece
[2:35:16.340 --> 2:35:17.340]  Your authorized to make copies
[2:35:17.340 --> 2:35:19.340]  For non-profit educational purposes
[2:35:19.340 --> 2:35:22.340]  P.O. Box, 1-9-5-4-9
[2:35:22.340 --> 2:35:25.340]  Austin, Texas, 7-8-7-6-0
[2:35:25.340 --> 2:35:27.340]  P.O. Box, 1-9-5-4-9
[2:35:27.340 --> 2:35:30.340]  Austin, Texas, 7-8-7-6-0
[2:35:30.340 --> 2:35:33.340]  It is up to you how viral this film goes
[2:35:33.340 --> 2:35:35.340]  Because there's no other single document
[2:35:35.340 --> 2:35:38.340]  That puts it all in perspective
[2:35:38.340 --> 2:35:41.340]  And explains what's happening 100%
[2:35:41.340 --> 2:35:43.340]  And shows you where we're going
[2:35:43.340 --> 2:35:44.340]  And how we can stop it
[2:35:44.340 --> 2:35:46.340]  It is so important if the Republic
[2:35:46.340 --> 2:35:48.340]  Isn't going to completely fall
[2:35:48.340 --> 2:35:50.340]  But if the people know who to blame
[2:35:50.340 --> 2:35:51.340]  And know the solutions
[2:35:51.340 --> 2:35:53.340]  Then we can pull out of it
[2:35:53.340 --> 2:35:54.340]  As Ron Paul has said
[2:35:54.340 --> 2:35:56.340]  If we don't, ladies and gentlemen
[2:35:56.340 --> 2:35:58.340]  It is hellish what these globalists
[2:35:58.340 --> 2:36:00.340]  Do to Third World and other First World countries
[2:36:00.340 --> 2:36:01.340]  They've taken over
[2:36:01.340 --> 2:36:02.340]  So follow the Republic
[2:36:02.340 --> 2:36:04.340]  You can also $5.95 a month
[2:36:04.340 --> 2:36:05.340]  See the live TV show
[2:36:05.340 --> 2:36:06.340]  All my other films
[2:36:06.340 --> 2:36:07.340]  This film in high quality
[2:36:07.340 --> 2:36:08.340]  There's a DivX version
[2:36:08.340 --> 2:36:10.340]  You can download and put on CDs
[2:36:10.340 --> 2:36:12.340]  And give to people that looks very, very crisp
[2:36:12.340 --> 2:36:14.340]  Not as good as DVD, but close
[2:36:14.340 --> 2:36:16.340]  Again, PrisonPlanet.tv
[2:36:16.340 --> 2:36:17.340]  Want to thank all those members as well
[2:36:17.340 --> 2:36:19.340]  They make everything possible
[2:36:19.340 --> 2:36:21.340]  I'm also going to tell you how to subscribe
[2:36:21.340 --> 2:36:23.340]  To Gerald Salente's
[2:36:23.340 --> 2:36:24.340]  Trends Forecaster
[2:36:24.340 --> 2:36:25.340]  He's not a sponsor
[2:36:25.340 --> 2:36:26.340]  I believe in it
[2:36:26.340 --> 2:36:27.340]  I think you should subscribe to it
[2:36:27.340 --> 2:36:29.340]  We'll tell you about that in just a moment
[2:36:29.340 --> 2:36:30.340]  So get a pen and paper ready
[2:36:30.340 --> 2:36:31.340]  A couple other sponsors
[2:36:31.340 --> 2:36:33.340]  That have made the day show possible
[2:36:33.340 --> 2:36:35.340]  I haven't plugged a sponsor for 2.5 hours
[2:36:35.340 --> 2:36:36.340]  So now we're doing it all
[2:36:36.340 --> 2:36:37.340]  Kind of here at once
[2:36:37.340 --> 2:36:39.340]  These sponsors are so important
[2:36:39.340 --> 2:36:42.340]  And they're also all groups I believe in
[2:36:42.340 --> 2:36:45.340]  One of them is frontsite.com
[2:36:45.340 --> 2:36:46.340]  Have you heard of the millionaire?
[2:36:46.340 --> 2:36:48.340]  Patriot Dr. Ignatius Piazza
[2:36:48.340 --> 2:36:50.340]  The founder of the Frontsite Farms Training Institute
[2:36:50.340 --> 2:36:52.340]  He's offering a free handgun
[2:36:52.340 --> 2:36:54.340]  And 5 days of firearms training to my listeners
[2:36:54.340 --> 2:36:56.340]  It's not enough to just own the guns
[2:36:56.340 --> 2:36:57.340]  You've got to know how to use them
[2:36:57.340 --> 2:36:59.340]  This offer is only available for limited time
[2:36:59.340 --> 2:37:01.340]  Because Dr. Piazza is literally paying
[2:37:01.340 --> 2:37:02.340]  His own money on a pocket
[2:37:02.340 --> 2:37:03.340]  To be able to offer you this deal
[2:37:03.340 --> 2:37:05.340]  It won't last forever, so listen up
[2:37:05.340 --> 2:37:07.340]  You get it in 5 days of world-class gun training
[2:37:07.340 --> 2:37:09.340]  At Frontsite Farms Training Institute
[2:37:09.340 --> 2:37:11.340]  And secure a 30-stake and seal weapons permit
[2:37:11.340 --> 2:37:13.340]  All for pennies on the dollar
[2:37:13.340 --> 2:37:15.340]  Act fast and they'll give you a free spring-filled
[2:37:15.340 --> 2:37:18.340]  Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice
[2:37:18.340 --> 2:37:21.340]  Frontsite.com, no drill instructor attitude
[2:37:21.340 --> 2:37:23.340]  It's family-oriented, it's the biggest
[2:37:23.340 --> 2:37:25.340]  Private firearms training center in the country
[2:37:25.340 --> 2:37:27.340]  2-day, 4-day, 5-day training courses
[2:37:27.340 --> 2:37:29.340]  The Fall and Winter are the best time
[2:37:29.340 --> 2:37:30.340]  To take it out in Nevada
[2:37:30.340 --> 2:37:31.340]  They have a lot of free online stuff
[2:37:31.340 --> 2:37:32.340]  If you can't go there
[2:37:32.340 --> 2:37:34.340]  Frontsite.com, that's Frontsite
[2:37:34.340 --> 2:37:36.340]  Like the front of your rifle
[2:37:36.340 --> 2:37:38.340]  Frontsite.com
[2:37:38.340 --> 2:37:40.340]  Okay, going back to Gerald Salente
[2:37:40.340 --> 2:37:42.340]  Gerald, plug your trend's newsletter
[2:37:42.340 --> 2:37:44.340]  Because it's thick, it's a magazine
[2:37:44.340 --> 2:37:47.340]  It's documented, people need it
[2:37:47.340 --> 2:37:50.340]  Well, our website is TrendsResearch.com
[2:37:50.340 --> 2:37:52.340]  That's TrendsResearch.com
[2:37:52.340 --> 2:37:54.340]  And I also want to make it clear
[2:37:54.340 --> 2:37:56.340]  That we know that people are
[2:37:56.340 --> 2:37:59.340]  Tough economic straits, many people
[2:37:59.340 --> 2:38:02.340]  So we offer discounts
[2:38:02.340 --> 2:38:06.340]  For people that are
[2:38:06.340 --> 2:38:09.340]  Tough financial shape, disabilities, whatever
[2:38:09.340 --> 2:38:11.340]  And we want the information out there
[2:38:11.340 --> 2:38:13.340]  For everyone, just as we
[2:38:13.340 --> 2:38:16.340]  We promote and encourage everyone
[2:38:16.340 --> 2:38:19.340]  To get your new DVD
[2:38:19.340 --> 2:38:21.340]  The Fall of the Republic
[2:38:21.340 --> 2:38:23.340]  I have to tell you, Alex, that I've distributed
[2:38:23.340 --> 2:38:27.340]  The Obama deception to a number of friends
[2:38:27.340 --> 2:38:30.340]  Who I consider really enlightened
[2:38:30.340 --> 2:38:32.340]  And on the cutting edge
[2:38:32.340 --> 2:38:36.340]  And they learn so much that they didn't know
[2:38:36.340 --> 2:38:39.340]  When they saw the Obama deception
[2:38:39.340 --> 2:38:41.340]  And that the only way that we're going to have
[2:38:41.340 --> 2:38:44.340]  The change that we need in a positive way
[2:38:44.340 --> 2:38:47.340]  Is for people to know what's going on
[2:38:47.340 --> 2:38:50.340]  To get the fall of the Republic
[2:38:50.340 --> 2:38:53.340]  And to learn more and to give it to people
[2:38:53.340 --> 2:38:55.340]  That are on the fence
[2:38:55.340 --> 2:38:57.340]  And with the Trends Journal, what we do
[2:38:57.340 --> 2:38:59.340]  As you well know, is that we not only
[2:38:59.340 --> 2:39:02.340]  Forecast the trends, we provide trend posts
[2:39:02.340 --> 2:39:06.340]  Into the future so you can take proactive measures
[2:39:06.340 --> 2:39:08.340]  And what we're saying now is that
[2:39:08.340 --> 2:39:11.340]  This is not a recovery, it's a cover-up
[2:39:11.340 --> 2:39:13.340]  It's as clear as that
[2:39:13.340 --> 2:39:16.340]  You know, why are these banks, for example
[2:39:16.340 --> 2:39:19.340]  You know, coming in with all these high profits
[2:39:19.340 --> 2:39:22.340]  Well, it's very, very simple
[2:39:22.340 --> 2:39:26.340]  It has more to do with gifts from the taxpayers
[2:39:26.340 --> 2:39:29.340]  Than increased economic activity or skills
[2:39:29.340 --> 2:39:32.340]  What they're doing, Alex, is these banks
[2:39:32.340 --> 2:39:34.340]  Are reaping outside the earnings
[2:39:34.340 --> 2:39:38.340]  Through risk-free, low-interest loans
[2:39:38.340 --> 2:39:40.340]  From central banks, which they in turn
[2:39:40.340 --> 2:39:44.340]  Lend back to governments at higher rates
[2:39:44.340 --> 2:39:46.340]  It's as simple as that
[2:39:46.340 --> 2:39:48.340]  They're picking our pockets
[2:39:48.340 --> 2:39:51.340]  Oh, and why are these other corporations
[2:39:51.340 --> 2:39:53.340]  Showing such wonderful earnings?
[2:39:53.340 --> 2:39:55.340]  Oh, it's simple
[2:39:55.340 --> 2:39:57.340]  They're cutting production
[2:39:57.340 --> 2:39:59.340]  They're laying off people
[2:39:59.340 --> 2:40:01.340]  And they're selling off assets
[2:40:01.340 --> 2:40:04.340]  So this is only a temporary recovery
[2:40:04.340 --> 2:40:07.340]  And what we're urging people to do now
[2:40:07.340 --> 2:40:09.340]  Is to take survival measures
[2:40:09.340 --> 2:40:13.340]  The kind of products that are offered on your website
[2:40:13.340 --> 2:40:17.340]  The solar generators, the foods
[2:40:17.340 --> 2:40:21.340]  And really start supporting your community
[2:40:21.340 --> 2:40:22.340]  People ask me what I do
[2:40:22.340 --> 2:40:25.340]  I don't buy anything I don't have to corporate
[2:40:25.340 --> 2:40:28.340]  You won't find me dead in a Dunkin' Donuts
[2:40:28.340 --> 2:40:30.340]  I'll go to the local coffee shop
[2:40:30.340 --> 2:40:32.340]  I buy local produce
[2:40:32.340 --> 2:40:35.340]  I buy local everything I can
[2:40:35.340 --> 2:40:37.340]  And we don't give it investment advice
[2:40:37.340 --> 2:40:39.340]  But I'm still buying gold
[2:40:39.340 --> 2:40:42.340]  And we're forecasting gold 2000
[2:40:42.340 --> 2:40:46.340]  And also, as your crew well knows
[2:40:46.340 --> 2:40:49.340]  From coming up to the Trends Research Institute
[2:40:49.340 --> 2:40:52.340]  I'm a firm believer in a renaissance
[2:40:52.340 --> 2:40:55.340]  And a renaissance to me
[2:40:55.340 --> 2:40:58.340]  Is how can we make America great again
[2:40:58.340 --> 2:41:01.340]  And a renaissance to everyone, of course, is a rebirth
[2:41:01.340 --> 2:41:04.340]  So when was America at its greatest?
[2:41:04.340 --> 2:41:08.340]  When were we the most egalitarian nation on earth?
[2:41:08.340 --> 2:41:09.340]  It was very simple
[2:41:09.340 --> 2:41:10.340]  The facts show it
[2:41:10.340 --> 2:41:14.340]  It's when we had Main Street, not Wall Street
[2:41:14.340 --> 2:41:15.340]  Not the too big to fails
[2:41:15.340 --> 2:41:17.340]  When we had mom and pops
[2:41:17.340 --> 2:41:19.340]  Not Walmart's
[2:41:19.340 --> 2:41:21.340]  People supported the community
[2:41:21.340 --> 2:41:23.340]  When we had family farms
[2:41:23.340 --> 2:41:25.340]  Not this garbage, deadly food
[2:41:25.340 --> 2:41:29.340]  That they're producing out of these factory farms
[2:41:29.340 --> 2:41:33.340]  This hormone-laced, genetically modified junk
[2:41:33.340 --> 2:41:38.340]  When we go back to the measure of Main Street, mom and pop
[2:41:38.340 --> 2:41:40.340]  And family farms
[2:41:40.340 --> 2:41:42.340]  We were the most egalitarian nation
[2:41:42.340 --> 2:41:44.340]  Now the gap between the rich and the poor
[2:41:44.340 --> 2:41:47.340]  Is the widest in the United States
[2:41:47.340 --> 2:41:50.340]  Of any of the industrialized nations
[2:41:50.340 --> 2:41:53.340]  I mention this because also with a renaissance
[2:41:53.340 --> 2:41:56.340]  And you go back to when the renaissance happened
[2:41:56.340 --> 2:41:59.340]  It happened after the Black Plague
[2:41:59.340 --> 2:42:01.340]  People got hip to the fact that
[2:42:01.340 --> 2:42:03.340]  They didn't know what they were doing
[2:42:03.340 --> 2:42:05.340]  And they needed a better way
[2:42:05.340 --> 2:42:07.340]  So they went back to the past
[2:42:07.340 --> 2:42:10.340]  When civilization was at higher levels
[2:42:10.340 --> 2:42:13.340]  They said in Italy, at the height of the renaissance
[2:42:13.340 --> 2:42:15.340]  Are they Romana, Al-Antiqua
[2:42:15.340 --> 2:42:17.340]  And the man of the Romans and the ancients
[2:42:17.340 --> 2:42:19.340]  The renaissance in America
[2:42:19.340 --> 2:42:22.340]  Is to go back to when this country was great
[2:42:22.340 --> 2:42:24.340]  And that means supporting your community
[2:42:24.340 --> 2:42:26.340]  Supporting your neighbor
[2:42:26.340 --> 2:42:29.340]  This is a time for people to come together
[2:42:29.340 --> 2:42:32.340]  In their community, by local
[2:42:32.340 --> 2:42:35.340]  And so this Christmas
[2:42:35.340 --> 2:42:37.340]  I'm urging everyone
[2:42:37.340 --> 2:42:42.340]  Don't buy one thing made in China
[2:42:42.340 --> 2:42:44.340]  Buy a handcrafted
[2:42:44.340 --> 2:42:46.340]  Give your children something
[2:42:46.340 --> 2:42:49.340]  Rather than a crappy plastic toy
[2:42:49.340 --> 2:42:51.340]  Give them something that's going to experience
[2:42:51.340 --> 2:42:55.340]  And increase their artistic endeavor
[2:42:55.340 --> 2:42:59.340]  And if people would just start making these decisions
[2:42:59.340 --> 2:43:01.340]  A good microcosm is 10 years ago
[2:43:01.340 --> 2:43:03.340]  You couldn't find organic food anywhere
[2:43:03.340 --> 2:43:04.340]  People demanded it
[2:43:04.340 --> 2:43:06.340]  And so now you can buy it everywhere
[2:43:06.340 --> 2:43:08.340]  And the price is going down
[2:43:08.340 --> 2:43:09.340]  And it's the same thing
[2:43:09.340 --> 2:43:13.340]  We have to start voting with our dollars
[2:43:13.340 --> 2:43:14.340]  Absolutely
[2:43:14.340 --> 2:43:17.340]  But looking ahead
[2:43:17.340 --> 2:43:20.340]  You mentioned Goldman Sachs
[2:43:20.340 --> 2:43:21.340]  G. Morgan Chase
[2:43:21.340 --> 2:43:23.340]  Record, not just big profits
[2:43:23.340 --> 2:43:26.340]  Record profits off the bailout money
[2:43:26.340 --> 2:43:28.340]  Obama's reform of credit cards
[2:43:28.340 --> 2:43:30.340]  Was to let him go from 15% to 30%
[2:43:30.340 --> 2:43:33.340]  Above loan sharking rates
[2:43:33.340 --> 2:43:36.340]  And I keep talking about the breaking point, Gerald
[2:43:36.340 --> 2:43:39.340]  As the system squeezes and squeezes and squeezes
[2:43:39.340 --> 2:43:41.340]  And they have announced in Austin
[2:43:41.340 --> 2:43:43.340]  And the Travis County is going to raise
[2:43:43.340 --> 2:43:45.340]  Taxes on property
[2:43:45.340 --> 2:43:48.340]  Taxes on septic tanks
[2:43:48.340 --> 2:43:50.340]  Taxes on everything
[2:43:50.340 --> 2:43:51.340]  Taxes on water
[2:43:51.340 --> 2:43:53.340]  Taxes on trash
[2:43:53.340 --> 2:43:55.340]  Doesn't the government understand
[2:43:55.340 --> 2:43:58.340]  That there just isn't more for them to steal?
[2:43:58.340 --> 2:44:00.340]  I mean, don't they understand their...
[2:44:00.340 --> 2:44:01.340]  No, they don't understand
[2:44:01.340 --> 2:44:04.340]  Because of the lifestyles that they live
[2:44:04.340 --> 2:44:08.340]  Look, Alex, the worst job I ever had in my life
[2:44:08.340 --> 2:44:11.340]  Was when I was the assistant to the secretary
[2:44:11.340 --> 2:44:13.340]  Of the New York State Senate
[2:44:13.340 --> 2:44:15.340]  I may have mentioned this on the yard
[2:44:15.340 --> 2:44:18.340]  Be hanging around the back of the chamber with my pal
[2:44:18.340 --> 2:44:19.340]  And a senator would walk in
[2:44:19.340 --> 2:44:21.340]  And my buddy would leave me
[2:44:21.340 --> 2:44:24.340]  To go follow the senator like a little puppy dog
[2:44:24.340 --> 2:44:27.340]  To go pull out the chair to help him sit down
[2:44:27.340 --> 2:44:30.340]  These people live like royalty
[2:44:30.340 --> 2:44:31.340]  Look at the...
[2:44:31.340 --> 2:44:32.340]  Look at the...
[2:44:32.340 --> 2:44:35.340]  Look at the fly around the world in their own planes
[2:44:35.340 --> 2:44:37.340]  That we the taxpayer pay for
[2:44:37.340 --> 2:44:39.340]  They're totally disconnected
[2:44:39.340 --> 2:44:41.340]  Yeah, now they're giving the entire...
[2:44:41.340 --> 2:44:42.340]  I'm sorry, what?
[2:44:42.340 --> 2:44:43.340]  No, I'm interrupting
[2:44:43.340 --> 2:44:45.340]  They're giving the entire House leadership
[2:44:45.340 --> 2:44:46.340]  And Senate leadership
[2:44:46.340 --> 2:44:48.340]  Their own super luxury jets
[2:44:48.340 --> 2:44:50.340]  Their own security
[2:44:50.340 --> 2:44:54.340]  I mean, they're just absolutely out of control
[2:44:54.340 --> 2:44:56.340]  Exactly, they're totally disconnected
[2:44:56.340 --> 2:44:58.340]  Just like they were
[2:44:58.340 --> 2:45:02.340]  When in France, when it was off with their heads
[2:45:02.340 --> 2:45:05.340]  They don't understand what's going on
[2:45:05.340 --> 2:45:08.340]  With the average everyday working person
[2:45:08.340 --> 2:45:11.340]  Who has a lousy job, crummy pay
[2:45:11.340 --> 2:45:13.340]  And benefits
[2:45:13.340 --> 2:45:15.340]  And don't even know if they're going to get a job
[2:45:15.340 --> 2:45:17.340]  Oh, oh, and here's one
[2:45:17.340 --> 2:45:19.340]  How about getting out of college
[2:45:19.340 --> 2:45:23.340]  And being, what, 30, 40, 50, $60,000 in debt
[2:45:23.340 --> 2:45:26.340]  Look, we know Ivy League graduates
[2:45:26.340 --> 2:45:30.340]  At a law school that can't find jobs
[2:45:30.340 --> 2:45:32.340]  You think they're going to be angry
[2:45:32.340 --> 2:45:34.340]  The revolution has begun
[2:45:34.340 --> 2:45:36.340]  As you pointed out
[2:45:36.340 --> 2:45:39.340]  They're squeezing the little people
[2:45:39.340 --> 2:45:41.340]  You go through a red light
[2:45:41.340 --> 2:45:43.340]  But they got it on camera
[2:45:43.340 --> 2:45:44.340]  They got you
[2:45:44.340 --> 2:45:47.340]  Everything, even the septic tank taxes
[2:45:47.340 --> 2:45:49.340]  On and on and on
[2:45:49.340 --> 2:45:50.340]  Toilet taxes
[2:45:50.340 --> 2:45:52.340]  We're going to continue to see it
[2:45:52.340 --> 2:45:53.340]  Is going to...
[2:45:53.340 --> 2:45:55.340]  The revolution is happening
[2:45:55.340 --> 2:45:58.340]  And so now what we're also saying
[2:45:58.340 --> 2:46:02.340]  Is that we're forecasting a third party by 2012
[2:46:02.340 --> 2:46:05.340]  And we're calling it, for lack of another name
[2:46:05.340 --> 2:46:07.340]  Progressive libertarian
[2:46:07.340 --> 2:46:08.340]  Progressive in the things
[2:46:08.340 --> 2:46:11.340]  That you talk about with organic foods
[2:46:11.340 --> 2:46:13.340]  With a higher quality of life
[2:46:13.340 --> 2:46:15.340]  Without buying junk
[2:46:15.340 --> 2:46:17.340]  Libertarian in the truest sense
[2:46:17.340 --> 2:46:21.340]  You know, look, this is classic empire decline
[2:46:21.340 --> 2:46:23.340]  Could you imagine being involved
[2:46:23.340 --> 2:46:25.340]  In foreign entanglements
[2:46:25.340 --> 2:46:27.340]  Costing us, what is it costing us?
[2:46:27.340 --> 2:46:30.340]  $8 billion a month just to be in Iraq
[2:46:30.340 --> 2:46:33.340]  And at a time when the Treasury's being depleted
[2:46:33.340 --> 2:46:35.340]  So we got, that's the new party
[2:46:35.340 --> 2:46:37.340]  That we're seeing forming
[2:46:37.340 --> 2:46:40.340]  And possibly someone like a Jesse Ventura
[2:46:40.340 --> 2:46:44.340]  Or others could be leading this movement
[2:46:44.340 --> 2:46:46.340]  Now, Gerald, in the time we have
[2:46:46.340 --> 2:46:48.340]  I want to take some calls
[2:46:48.340 --> 2:46:50.340]  I want to expand on this
[2:46:50.340 --> 2:46:52.340]  There's dangers, though
[2:46:52.340 --> 2:46:55.340]  The establishment, generally when the bank's ludicountry
[2:46:55.340 --> 2:46:58.340]  They fund a communist or a fascist movement
[2:46:58.340 --> 2:47:01.340]  A fascist movement to consolidate control
[2:47:01.340 --> 2:47:03.340]  Or a communist movement
[2:47:03.340 --> 2:47:05.340]  And we're in a fascist paradigm right now
[2:47:05.340 --> 2:47:08.340]  See through Obama or a future president
[2:47:08.340 --> 2:47:11.340]  That the establishment is attempting to sell socialism
[2:47:11.340 --> 2:47:13.340]  Or communism
[2:47:13.340 --> 2:47:15.340]  But really that's just a way to consolidate
[2:47:15.340 --> 2:47:17.340]  The people's wealth and give it to offshore banks
[2:47:17.340 --> 2:47:19.340]  But selling to the little guy
[2:47:19.340 --> 2:47:21.340]  That, oh yes, like Michael Moore's new film
[2:47:21.340 --> 2:47:23.340]  Capitalism did this
[2:47:23.340 --> 2:47:25.340]  And so the answer is
[2:47:25.340 --> 2:47:27.340]  Rob the rich
[2:47:27.340 --> 2:47:29.340]  Put caps on what people can be paid
[2:47:29.340 --> 2:47:31.340]  But that won't be put on the big banks
[2:47:31.340 --> 2:47:33.340]  And the offshore corporations
[2:47:33.340 --> 2:47:36.340]  Put it on local businesses and local companies
[2:47:36.340 --> 2:47:38.340]  And so kind of the howling mob
[2:47:38.340 --> 2:47:40.340]  Of people that don't trust the government
[2:47:40.340 --> 2:47:43.340]  But they can be misdirected by the social engineers
[2:47:43.340 --> 2:47:45.340]  To then further rob
[2:47:45.340 --> 2:47:47.340]  The hereditary enemy of the elite
[2:47:47.340 --> 2:47:49.340]  What's left of the middle class
[2:47:49.340 --> 2:47:51.340]  And so how do we navigate that
[2:47:51.340 --> 2:47:53.340]  Because we know the social engineers
[2:47:53.340 --> 2:47:55.340]  Have got a lot of tricks up their sleeves
[2:47:55.340 --> 2:47:57.340]  It's going to be a difficult one
[2:47:57.340 --> 2:47:59.340]  And you really nailed it
[2:47:59.340 --> 2:48:02.340]  The taxing that the American business people
[2:48:02.340 --> 2:48:05.340]  Are giving the big tax breaks to the big guys
[2:48:05.340 --> 2:48:07.340]  And Michael Moore is wrong
[2:48:07.340 --> 2:48:09.340]  About capitalism
[2:48:09.340 --> 2:48:11.340]  Capitalism isn't dead
[2:48:11.340 --> 2:48:13.340]  Capitalism didn't cause this problem
[2:48:13.340 --> 2:48:15.340]  It was caused by the criminal gangs
[2:48:15.340 --> 2:48:17.340]  The Wall Street mob
[2:48:17.340 --> 2:48:19.340]  You've heard me say this
[2:48:19.340 --> 2:48:21.340]  If the names on Wall Street were named
[2:48:21.340 --> 2:48:23.340]  Sollenti, Caruso, Mondavi, Butoni,
[2:48:23.340 --> 2:48:25.340]  Rossini, Bellini
[2:48:25.340 --> 2:48:27.340]  They call it the mafia
[2:48:27.340 --> 2:48:30.340]  But you're not allowed to call these white shoe boys
[2:48:30.340 --> 2:48:31.340]  Crooks and criminals, oh no!
[2:48:31.340 --> 2:48:33.340]  They don't do loan-shocking
[2:48:33.340 --> 2:48:35.340]  That's just the cause of doing business
[2:48:35.340 --> 2:48:37.340]  To charge 30% on a credit card
[2:48:37.340 --> 2:48:39.340]  Oh no, they don't do Ponzi schemes
[2:48:39.340 --> 2:48:41.340]  Or pyramid scams
[2:48:41.340 --> 2:48:43.340]  They do credit the false swaps
[2:48:43.340 --> 2:48:45.340]  Auction rate securities
[2:48:45.340 --> 2:48:47.340]  And they're blaming it on capitalism
[2:48:47.340 --> 2:48:49.340]  Just like you said
[2:48:49.340 --> 2:48:51.340]  To turn it into fascism
[2:48:51.340 --> 2:48:53.340]  There's nothing wrong with capitalism
[2:48:53.340 --> 2:48:55.340]  This is greed and corruption
[2:48:55.340 --> 2:48:57.340]  This is the Robert Rubens
[2:48:57.340 --> 2:48:59.340]  This is the Henry Paulson
[2:48:59.340 --> 2:49:01.340]  This is the Larry Summers
[2:49:01.340 --> 2:49:04.340]  The genius, Larry the genius Summers
[2:49:04.340 --> 2:49:06.340]  These are the people that have created it
[2:49:06.340 --> 2:49:08.340]  Timothy Geithner
[2:49:08.340 --> 2:49:10.340]  There's nothing wrong with capitalism
[2:49:10.340 --> 2:49:12.340]  So they're going to blame it on capitalism
[2:49:12.340 --> 2:49:14.340]  And just like you pointed out
[2:49:14.340 --> 2:49:16.340]  They're going to use it to turn it around
[2:49:16.340 --> 2:49:19.340]  To gain more control
[2:49:19.340 --> 2:49:22.340]  And what's amazing about this is
[2:49:22.340 --> 2:49:25.340]  We know that it's Madoff who founded the Nasdaq
[2:49:25.340 --> 2:49:27.340]  We know it's Ken Lay that came up
[2:49:27.340 --> 2:49:29.340]  With a global carbon trading scam
[2:49:29.340 --> 2:49:31.340]  Schwarzenegger is announcing
[2:49:31.340 --> 2:49:33.340]  He's going to ban TVs above 40 inches
[2:49:33.340 --> 2:49:35.340]  Tax all the rest
[2:49:35.340 --> 2:49:37.340]  Taxes on firearms, taxes on farms
[2:49:37.340 --> 2:49:40.340]  Taxes on ranches, taxes on beef
[2:49:40.340 --> 2:49:42.340]  Taxes on plastic
[2:49:42.340 --> 2:49:45.340]  A wet blanket on already
[2:49:45.340 --> 2:49:47.340]  Staggering economy
[2:49:47.340 --> 2:49:49.340]  That is burning out
[2:49:49.340 --> 2:49:51.340]  That is becoming extinguished
[2:49:51.340 --> 2:49:53.340]  They want to destroy the economy
[2:49:53.340 --> 2:49:55.340]  So that they can consolidate it
[2:49:55.340 --> 2:49:58.340]  With these criminals just expanding their scams
[2:49:58.340 --> 2:50:00.340]  And never stopping
[2:50:00.340 --> 2:50:02.340]  And only getting more greedy
[2:50:02.340 --> 2:50:04.340]  With no end in sight
[2:50:04.340 --> 2:50:05.340]  No end in sight
[2:50:05.340 --> 2:50:07.340]  Here's another trend that we're working on
[2:50:07.340 --> 2:50:09.340]  Two trends
[2:50:09.340 --> 2:50:12.340]  The first one was for 2010
[2:50:12.340 --> 2:50:14.340]  Terror 2010
[2:50:14.340 --> 2:50:16.340]  The next one is by America
[2:50:16.340 --> 2:50:19.340]  As they devalue the dollar
[2:50:19.340 --> 2:50:22.340]  And the currencies around the world are worth more
[2:50:22.340 --> 2:50:24.340]  They're going to come in here
[2:50:24.340 --> 2:50:26.340]  And put this country up
[2:50:26.340 --> 2:50:28.340]  For dimes on the dollar
[2:50:28.340 --> 2:50:30.340]  So all you people out there
[2:50:30.340 --> 2:50:33.340]  You know who the man you're going to be working for?
[2:50:33.340 --> 2:50:35.340]  Well, the man's going to be from China
[2:50:35.340 --> 2:50:38.340]  You're going to be from countries with money
[2:50:38.340 --> 2:50:40.340]  And that's what's going on in this country
[2:50:40.340 --> 2:51:00.340]  We're going to be enslaved
[2:51:00.340 --> 2:51:11.340]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[2:51:11.340 --> 2:51:13.340]  Add less than 2 cents per gallon
[2:51:13.340 --> 2:51:32.340]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water
[2:51:32.340 --> 2:51:38.340]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two-sport Berke bottles absolutely free

[2:52:01.340 --> 2:52:06.340]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[2:52:06.340 --> 2:52:09.340]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[2:52:09.340 --> 2:52:14.340]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[2:52:14.340 --> 2:52:18.340]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our President and Congress
[2:52:18.340 --> 2:52:20.340]  And they really are calling the shots
[2:52:20.340 --> 2:52:25.340]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[2:52:25.340 --> 2:52:29.340]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[2:52:29.340 --> 2:52:33.340]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:52:33.340 --> 2:52:35.340]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[2:52:35.340 --> 2:52:38.340]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and their arsonists
[2:52:38.340 --> 2:52:39.340]  They're asking for more matches
[2:52:39.340 --> 2:52:42.340]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[2:52:42.340 --> 2:52:44.340]  Today seems like nobody does care
[2:52:44.340 --> 2:52:49.340]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic
[2:52:49.340 --> 2:52:54.340]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[2:52:54.340 --> 2:53:00.340]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[2:53:00.340 --> 2:53:05.340]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:53:05.340 --> 2:53:09.340]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:53:09.340 --> 2:53:15.340]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:53:15.340 --> 2:53:21.340]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:53:21.340 --> 2:53:25.340]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:53:25.340 --> 2:53:29.340]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[2:53:29.340 --> 2:53:32.340]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[2:53:32.340 --> 2:53:36.340]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[2:53:36.340 --> 2:53:41.340]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[2:53:41.340 --> 2:53:45.340]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[2:53:45.340 --> 2:53:46.340]  One of my old sponsors
[2:53:46.340 --> 2:53:50.340]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[2:54:08.340 --> 2:54:11.340]  Gerald Salenta will be with us for a half hour
[2:54:11.340 --> 2:54:14.340]  Till the half hour point in the next hour
[2:54:14.340 --> 2:54:16.340]  Very honored to having
[2:54:16.340 --> 2:54:19.340]  I want to throw out some news headlines at him as well
[2:54:19.340 --> 2:54:21.340]  We're going to start taking your calls
[2:54:21.340 --> 2:54:25.340]  In T-minus five minutes when we go into the fourth and final hour here
[2:54:28.340 --> 2:54:35.340]  Basically, government is a giant nexus point that allows corruption to pour in and feed off the people
[2:54:35.340 --> 2:54:41.340]  The Congress won't even read and won't even publish all of the health care bill
[2:54:41.340 --> 2:54:43.340]  They passed NAFTA and GATT without reading it
[2:54:43.340 --> 2:54:46.340]  Remember, told us how great NAFTA and GATT would be
[2:54:46.340 --> 2:54:52.340]  Gerald, how is the system going to keep the people from removing NAFTA and GATT
[2:54:52.340 --> 2:54:56.340]  Ending the open borders, ending all the welfare for illegals
[2:54:56.340 --> 2:55:01.340]  How are they going to be able to continue the war when there's giant soup kitchens and long lines?
[2:55:01.340 --> 2:55:04.340]  How are they going to be able to continue this?
[2:55:04.340 --> 2:55:06.340]  Well, my answer is a control grid
[2:55:06.340 --> 2:55:10.340]  U.S. News & World Report has announced that the police have kill switches
[2:55:10.340 --> 2:55:13.340]  And basically all the new cars through OnStar and other systems
[2:55:13.340 --> 2:55:15.340]  Where they just turn your car off
[2:55:15.340 --> 2:55:17.340]  They always planned that
[2:55:17.340 --> 2:55:20.340]  I mean, clearly they've put this high-tech control grid in
[2:55:20.340 --> 2:55:22.340]  Knowing they were going to bring in this tyranny later
[2:55:22.340 --> 2:55:25.340]  But still, I think it's wishful thinking
[2:55:25.340 --> 2:55:27.340]  Like you said, desperate people do desperate things
[2:55:27.340 --> 2:55:30.340]  They're not going to be able to control what happens
[2:55:30.340 --> 2:55:31.340]  No, they're not
[2:55:31.340 --> 2:55:33.340]  It's way beyond their control
[2:55:33.340 --> 2:55:36.340]  You know, people should understand as they look around
[2:55:36.340 --> 2:55:38.340]  And they look at who these world leaders are
[2:55:38.340 --> 2:55:39.340]  Or their own leaders
[2:55:39.340 --> 2:55:42.340]  Nancy Pelosi, the Bonnie Franks
[2:55:42.340 --> 2:55:46.340]  The Bonners, the Shelby's, the Dodds
[2:55:46.340 --> 2:55:49.340]  The Obama's, the Geithners, the Summers
[2:55:49.340 --> 2:55:52.340]  And all those people you couldn't stand in high school
[2:55:52.340 --> 2:55:54.340]  That wanted to be the class president
[2:55:54.340 --> 2:55:57.340]  Or the head of the student council in college
[2:55:57.340 --> 2:55:59.340]  Or the people that worked on the newspapers
[2:55:59.340 --> 2:56:01.340]  The people that you really, you know
[2:56:01.340 --> 2:56:04.340]  That they always thought that they were better than you
[2:56:04.340 --> 2:56:06.340]  Well, guess what, folks
[2:56:06.340 --> 2:56:09.340]  All those people you couldn't stand in high school
[2:56:09.340 --> 2:56:12.340]  Those are the people that are telling you what to do right now
[2:56:12.340 --> 2:56:16.340]  And just as you looked at them back in high school
[2:56:16.340 --> 2:56:19.340]  And you saw that there were a bunch of brown-nosers
[2:56:19.340 --> 2:56:20.340]  And suck-ups
[2:56:20.340 --> 2:56:22.340]  And they really didn't know much about anything
[2:56:22.340 --> 2:56:24.340]  Other than having an attitude
[2:56:24.340 --> 2:56:26.340]  Well, that's who they are
[2:56:26.340 --> 2:56:28.340]  They still don't know much about anything
[2:56:28.340 --> 2:56:29.340]  They pretend to
[2:56:29.340 --> 2:56:32.340]  And they have this phalanx of guards around them
[2:56:32.340 --> 2:56:35.340]  And all of the pomp and circumstances
[2:56:35.340 --> 2:56:36.340]  That pumps them up
[2:56:36.340 --> 2:56:39.340]  And of course, you know, they're living these privileged lives
[2:56:39.340 --> 2:56:42.340]  So they actually do think they're better than the rest of us
[2:56:42.340 --> 2:56:45.340]  They're not going to be able to hold it together
[2:56:45.340 --> 2:56:48.340]  We're going to see also one of our forecasts
[2:56:48.340 --> 2:56:51.340]  Is that we're going to see great secessionist movements
[2:56:51.340 --> 2:56:52.340]  Really take hold
[2:56:52.340 --> 2:56:56.340]  And we can actually see the breakup of the republic
[2:56:56.340 --> 2:56:59.340]  Just like we saw the breakup of the former Soviet Union
[2:56:59.340 --> 2:57:01.340]  We're going to talk about that more after we take calls
[2:57:01.340 --> 2:57:05.340]  But when I read about the psychology of Henry Kissinger
[2:57:05.340 --> 2:57:07.340]  And all these different globalists
[2:57:07.340 --> 2:57:10.340]  They themselves admit they love the guards
[2:57:10.340 --> 2:57:11.340]  They love the pomp
[2:57:11.340 --> 2:57:13.340]  They love the awards
[2:57:13.340 --> 2:57:15.340]  And I'm not saying I'm some perfect person
[2:57:15.340 --> 2:57:16.340]  But I can't stand pomp
[2:57:16.340 --> 2:57:20.340]  I can't stand just fake praise
[2:57:20.340 --> 2:57:22.340]  But I guess for people like the Queen of England
[2:57:22.340 --> 2:57:23.340]  They love uniforms
[2:57:23.340 --> 2:57:25.340]  They love big golden crowns
[2:57:25.340 --> 2:57:27.340]  They love...
[2:57:27.340 --> 2:57:29.340]  And they're smart at certain levels
[2:57:29.340 --> 2:57:31.340]  But at another level, they're dumb
[2:57:31.340 --> 2:57:34.340]  They do just paper over it with a police state
[2:57:34.340 --> 2:57:35.340]  They're lies
[2:57:35.340 --> 2:57:36.340]  But like you have been saying
[2:57:36.340 --> 2:57:37.340]  This isn't going to hold water
[2:57:37.340 --> 2:57:38.340]  No, it's not
[2:57:38.340 --> 2:57:40.340]  You know, and again, you know
[2:57:40.340 --> 2:57:43.340]  When you hear these politicians like Al Gore
[2:57:43.340 --> 2:57:44.340]  Or Hillary Clinton
[2:57:44.340 --> 2:57:45.340]  Or Bush or...
[2:57:45.340 --> 2:57:47.340]  I'm going to fight for you
[2:57:47.340 --> 2:57:50.340]  These people couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag
[2:57:50.340 --> 2:57:52.340]  Anybody that calls them their leaders
[2:57:52.340 --> 2:57:54.340]  Needs to have their heads examined
[2:57:54.340 --> 2:57:56.340]  These people couldn't lead me across the street
[2:57:56.340 --> 2:57:58.340]  And they want to lead a country
[2:57:58.340 --> 2:58:00.340]  Again, it's all show
[2:58:00.340 --> 2:58:02.340]  It's the old bomber show
[2:58:02.340 --> 2:58:04.340]  I've never had a show like this one before
[2:58:04.340 --> 2:58:06.340]  He's on daytime TV
[2:58:06.340 --> 2:58:07.340]  Late night TV
[2:58:07.340 --> 2:58:09.340]  He's at town hall meetings
[2:58:09.340 --> 2:58:10.340]  He's on factory floors
[2:58:10.340 --> 2:58:12.340]  He's all over the place
[2:58:12.340 --> 2:58:13.340]  It's a show
[2:58:13.340 --> 2:58:15.340]  There's nothing behind it
[2:58:15.340 --> 2:58:17.340]  It's the Wizard of Oz
[2:58:18.340 --> 2:58:21.340]  And people are finding out that it's all hollow
[2:58:21.340 --> 2:58:23.340]  And that's why his approval rating is dropping
[2:58:23.340 --> 2:58:24.340]  Like a rock
[2:58:24.340 --> 2:58:26.340]  We'll talk about some of the other future trends
[2:58:26.340 --> 2:58:27.340]  You haven't gotten to yet
[2:58:27.340 --> 2:58:28.340]  Before you leave us
[2:58:28.340 --> 2:58:31.340]  We'll also discuss that key area, Gerald
[2:58:31.340 --> 2:58:33.340]  That you got into
[2:58:33.340 --> 2:58:37.340]  Dealing with the looting of America by offshore corporations
[2:58:37.340 --> 2:58:40.340]  We'll be right back in one minute with the final hour
[2:58:41.340 --> 2:58:44.340]  America's number one source for independent talk radio
[2:58:44.340 --> 2:58:46.340]  For over a decade
[2:58:46.340 --> 2:58:50.340]  We are the GCN Radio Network
[2:58:51.340 --> 2:58:55.340]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[2:58:55.340 --> 2:58:58.340]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[2:58:58.340 --> 2:59:01.340]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[2:59:01.340 --> 2:59:04.340]  We'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[2:59:04.340 --> 2:59:08.340]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[2:59:08.340 --> 2:59:10.340]  And they really are calling the shots
[2:59:10.340 --> 2:59:15.340]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[2:59:15.340 --> 2:59:18.340]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[2:59:18.340 --> 2:59:22.340]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:59:22.340 --> 2:59:25.340]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[2:59:25.340 --> 2:59:28.340]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[2:59:28.340 --> 2:59:29.340]  They're asking for more matches
[2:59:29.340 --> 2:59:32.340]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[2:59:32.340 --> 2:59:34.340]  Today seems like nobody does care
[2:59:34.340 --> 2:59:36.340]  And right now in Washington DC
[2:59:36.340 --> 2:59:39.340]  We have seen a fall of the Republic
[2:59:39.340 --> 2:59:44.340]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[2:59:44.340 --> 3:00:00.340]  Or watch it online right now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv
[3:00:04.340 --> 3:00:06.340]  We are locked and loaded
[3:00:06.340 --> 3:00:08.340]  We found it the front line in the info war
[3:00:08.340 --> 3:00:13.340]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Gerald Salente of trendsresearch.com
[3:00:13.340 --> 3:00:15.340]  Is our guest for another 30 minutes
[3:00:15.340 --> 3:00:17.340]  We're going straight to your call
[3:00:17.340 --> 3:00:20.340]  Before he leaves us, more trends forecasting
[3:00:20.340 --> 3:00:24.340]  As we look over the horizon through the mind of Gerald Salente
[3:00:24.340 --> 3:00:28.340]  Cynthia in Maryland, thanks for holding you're on the air worldwide
[3:00:28.340 --> 3:00:29.340]  Welcome
[3:00:29.340 --> 3:00:35.340]  Hi, first of all I wanted to say before the break, before this one
[3:00:35.340 --> 3:00:40.340]  I noticed that there was Dr. Hu music playing in the background
[3:00:40.340 --> 3:00:44.340]  And I thought that was so apropos
[3:00:44.340 --> 3:00:51.340]  Because I just wanted to say that Dr. Hu, Charlie Jade, Eureka, heroes
[3:00:51.340 --> 3:00:56.340]  And another show, everybody knows them as science fiction
[3:00:56.340 --> 3:01:00.340]  But I have to say that they are based on fact
[3:01:00.340 --> 3:01:03.340]  There are a lot of aspects of those shows
[3:01:03.340 --> 3:01:07.340]  That are put into science fiction
[3:01:07.340 --> 3:01:10.340]  But are actually based on fact
[3:01:10.340 --> 3:01:14.340]  When I grew up, when I grew up hardly anybody had cable
[3:01:14.340 --> 3:01:16.340]  And we didn't have cable
[3:01:16.340 --> 3:01:19.340]  And one of the few shows on was Dr. Hu
[3:01:19.340 --> 3:01:20.340]  And I watched it a few times
[3:01:20.340 --> 3:01:23.340]  But Paul Watson wrote an article a few years ago about the new Dr. Hu
[3:01:23.340 --> 3:01:27.340]  Where the government stages a fake alien attack on London
[3:01:27.340 --> 3:01:30.340]  As a pretext to crack down on the population
[3:01:30.340 --> 3:01:32.340]  Do you have any questions for Gerald Salente?
[3:01:32.340 --> 3:01:37.340]  No, I just wanted to give some other educational resources
[3:01:37.340 --> 3:01:46.340]  Being linkTV, free speech TV, WPFW and Democracy Now
[3:01:46.340 --> 3:01:51.340]  My problem with Democracy Now is it is better than some mainstream corporate media
[3:01:51.340 --> 3:01:54.340]  But it's still Ford Foundation funded and is still behind Obama
[3:01:54.340 --> 3:01:58.340]  But at least they did admit that Obama lied about how he wasn't going to sign
[3:01:58.340 --> 3:02:02.340]  His signing statements. Gerald Salente, we know they're liars
[3:02:02.340 --> 3:02:05.340]  But you've been studying this for 30-plus years
[3:02:05.340 --> 3:02:07.340]  And advising government corporations, you name it
[3:02:07.340 --> 3:02:10.340]  Is the line getting more intense?
[3:02:10.340 --> 3:02:12.340]  Or is it just we're aware of it?
[3:02:12.340 --> 3:02:15.340]  Because the New York Times and others have a school program
[3:02:15.340 --> 3:02:17.340]  Where they give fact sheets to school children saying
[3:02:17.340 --> 3:02:19.340]  There is no mercury in the shots
[3:02:19.340 --> 3:02:21.340]  It doesn't give you neurological disorders
[3:02:21.340 --> 3:02:23.340]  It can't sterilize you
[3:02:23.340 --> 3:02:28.340]  But then the drug insert from FDA.gov
[3:02:28.340 --> 3:02:32.340]  I showed this on television slash radio show yesterday
[3:02:32.340 --> 3:02:35.340]  Here they are, says that it can do all of that
[3:02:35.340 --> 3:02:37.340]  And that there is mercury in it
[3:02:37.340 --> 3:02:40.340]  And so just all of the law
[3:02:40.340 --> 3:02:44.340]  And Obama, he seems to have broken all the lying records in my book
[3:02:44.340 --> 3:02:45.340]  Your take on that?
[3:02:45.340 --> 3:02:46.340]  Well, he has
[3:02:46.340 --> 3:02:51.340]  And every time that you go through the litany of lies from Obama
[3:02:51.340 --> 3:02:53.340]  He said he was going to do
[3:02:53.340 --> 3:02:58.340]  Whether it has to do with habeas corpus, rendition
[3:02:58.340 --> 3:03:03.340]  The patriot act, wiretapping
[3:03:03.340 --> 3:03:07.340]  Pulling the troops out of Iraq
[3:03:07.340 --> 3:03:10.340]  Putting more troops into Afghanistan
[3:03:10.340 --> 3:03:13.340]  Bombing sovereign nations
[3:03:13.340 --> 3:03:16.340]  You go after one issue after another
[3:03:16.340 --> 3:03:20.340]  Lobbyist lying saying he would have open government
[3:03:20.340 --> 3:03:23.340]  And you tell these things to his liberal supporters
[3:03:23.340 --> 3:03:26.340]  And what I say is that you go through the facts
[3:03:26.340 --> 3:03:27.340]  And they look at you
[3:03:27.340 --> 3:03:30.340]  And the only thing they could do is give you a key sheet
[3:03:30.340 --> 3:03:33.340]  And grin and a balsamic smile
[3:03:33.340 --> 3:03:35.340]  And they say, well, give him time
[3:03:35.340 --> 3:03:38.340]  Or, oh, he can't really fight that much about this
[3:03:38.340 --> 3:03:40.340]  You just give him a chance
[3:03:40.340 --> 3:03:41.340]  What chance?
[3:03:41.340 --> 3:03:42.340]  How much more?
[3:03:42.340 --> 3:03:43.340]  He's one of them
[3:03:43.340 --> 3:03:45.340]  Nothing has changed
[3:03:45.340 --> 3:03:47.340]  It's only a different team in there
[3:03:47.340 --> 3:03:49.340]  Playing the same crooked games
[3:03:49.340 --> 3:03:50.340]  Has the lying increased?
[3:03:50.340 --> 3:03:51.340]  Yes, it has
[3:03:51.340 --> 3:03:54.340]  I've never seen anything like this before in my life
[3:03:54.340 --> 3:03:57.340]  It's one lie after another every day
[3:03:57.340 --> 3:03:59.340]  But the biggest thing that's happened to Alex
[3:03:59.340 --> 3:04:02.340]  Between Bush and Obama in one year
[3:04:02.340 --> 3:04:04.340]  In one year is that this country
[3:04:04.340 --> 3:04:07.340]  Went from the greatest entrepreneurial country in the world
[3:04:07.340 --> 3:04:09.340]  The one that was the envy of everybody
[3:04:09.340 --> 3:04:11.340]  That wanted to come here to make their mark
[3:04:11.340 --> 3:04:14.340]  To now a country that's too big to fail
[3:04:14.340 --> 3:04:17.340]  That they have jammed down the public's throats
[3:04:17.340 --> 3:04:20.340]  This too big to fail lie
[3:04:20.340 --> 3:04:24.340]  And that all our resources should be going to protect them
[3:04:24.340 --> 3:04:26.340]  You know, in our Trends Journal
[3:04:26.340 --> 3:04:29.340]  We did a story about this too big to fail
[3:04:29.340 --> 3:04:32.340]  After Obama was elected in December
[3:04:32.340 --> 3:04:34.340]  They asked him, why are we bailing out these companies?
[3:04:34.340 --> 3:04:37.340]  And he came out with this two-bit analogy
[3:04:37.340 --> 3:04:39.340]  Well, if your neighbor's house is on fire
[3:04:39.340 --> 3:04:42.340]  Even if he smoked in bed or left a stove on
[3:04:42.340 --> 3:04:43.340]  Wouldn't you want to put it out
[3:04:43.340 --> 3:04:46.340]  If it was going to catch you up onto your house?
[3:04:46.340 --> 3:04:48.340]  Well, seven months later, on 60 Minutes
[3:04:48.340 --> 3:04:52.340]  They asked Federal Chairman Bernanke the same question
[3:04:52.340 --> 3:04:54.340]  And you know what he said?
[3:04:54.340 --> 3:04:56.340]  What if your neighbor's house is on fire
[3:04:56.340 --> 3:04:58.340]  And he left a stove on and smoked in bed?
[3:04:58.340 --> 3:04:59.340]  Wouldn't you want to put it on?
[3:04:59.340 --> 3:05:01.340]  Stay there, they're reading off the script
[3:05:01.340 --> 3:05:04.340]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions
[3:05:04.340 --> 3:05:06.340]  If you're going into a battle
[3:05:06.340 --> 3:05:08.340]  And they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[3:05:08.340 --> 3:05:10.340]  How much ammunition do you want?
[3:05:10.340 --> 3:05:12.340]  My answer would be all I can get
[3:05:12.340 --> 3:05:15.340]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones
[3:05:15.340 --> 3:05:17.340]  Food is your only ammunition
[3:05:17.340 --> 3:05:19.340]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[3:05:19.340 --> 3:05:21.340]  Now or after the battle starts
[3:05:21.340 --> 3:05:22.340]  When will you need it?
[3:05:22.340 --> 3:05:24.340]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:05:24.340 --> 3:05:27.340]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[3:05:27.340 --> 3:05:30.340]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself
[3:05:30.340 --> 3:05:32.340]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:05:32.340 --> 3:05:36.340]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply
[3:05:36.340 --> 3:05:40.340]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life
[3:05:40.340 --> 3:05:42.340]  How much will you need? We don't know
[3:05:42.340 --> 3:05:44.340]  How much do you want? All you can get
[3:05:44.340 --> 3:05:45.340]  This is Alex Jones
[3:05:45.340 --> 3:05:48.340]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day

[3:06:08.340 --> 3:06:10.340]  Right from the humidity in the air you breathe
[3:06:10.340 --> 3:06:12.340]  No, this isn't science fiction
[3:06:12.340 --> 3:06:15.340]  It's very real. I know, I use one every day in my own home

[3:06:38.340 --> 3:06:40.340]  And uses a multi-stage filtration system

[3:07:02.340 --> 3:07:04.340]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[3:07:04.340 --> 3:07:06.340]  In the last century alone
[3:07:06.340 --> 3:07:09.340]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[3:07:09.340 --> 3:07:11.340]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[3:07:11.340 --> 3:07:14.340]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[3:07:14.340 --> 3:07:18.340]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[3:07:18.340 --> 3:07:20.340]  And they really are calling the shots
[3:07:20.340 --> 3:07:23.340]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[3:07:23.340 --> 3:07:25.340]  As American citizens to pay attention
[3:07:25.340 --> 3:07:29.340]  For the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[3:07:29.340 --> 3:07:31.340]  The criminal offshore cartel
[3:07:31.340 --> 3:07:33.340]  Hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[3:07:33.340 --> 3:07:36.340]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[3:07:36.340 --> 3:07:38.340]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[3:07:38.340 --> 3:07:40.340]  They're asking for more matches
[3:07:40.340 --> 3:07:42.340]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:07:42.340 --> 3:07:44.340]  Today seems like nobody does care
[3:07:44.340 --> 3:07:46.340]  And right now in Washington D.C.
[3:07:46.340 --> 3:07:49.340]  We have seen a fall of the republic
[3:07:49.340 --> 3:07:54.340]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[3:07:54.340 --> 3:07:56.340]  We're watching online right now
[3:07:56.340 --> 3:08:09.340]  In super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[3:08:27.340 --> 3:08:31.340]  We're going to go to Michael, Nicky, Luke, Captain Truth
[3:08:31.340 --> 3:08:34.340]  And others for Trends forecaster Gerald Salente
[3:08:34.340 --> 3:08:37.340]  But I wanted to finish up talking about Obama
[3:08:37.340 --> 3:08:40.340]  It's just like when you grow up loving a football team
[3:08:40.340 --> 3:08:43.340]  You identify with it like a political party
[3:08:43.340 --> 3:08:46.340]  You don't want to admit when it's doing things wrong or lying to you
[3:08:46.340 --> 3:08:49.340]  And so many Americans, this is changing
[3:08:49.340 --> 3:08:53.340]  And that's our salvation politically
[3:08:53.340 --> 3:08:56.340]  That the Republicans, the leadership will lie to you
[3:08:56.340 --> 3:08:58.340]  They work for the same special interests
[3:08:58.340 --> 3:09:01.340]  The Democrats work for the same offshore criminal special interests
[3:09:01.340 --> 3:09:03.340]  But you talk to Obama supporters
[3:09:03.340 --> 3:09:05.340]  And it's just like Bush supporters when we would say
[3:09:05.340 --> 3:09:08.340]  He's spying on you, he's setting up homeland security
[3:09:08.340 --> 3:09:11.340]  For gun owners, conservatives, libertarians
[3:09:11.340 --> 3:09:14.340]  They're setting up brigade homeland through Northcom
[3:09:14.340 --> 3:09:16.340]  To use the military against us
[3:09:16.340 --> 3:09:19.340]  He lied about WMDs, he's torturing people
[3:09:19.340 --> 3:09:21.340]  He's tripled the size of government
[3:09:21.340 --> 3:09:24.340]  He's going along with all the Clinton advisors from before him
[3:09:24.340 --> 3:09:26.340]  With this seamless scam
[3:09:26.340 --> 3:09:30.340]  The politicians change but the Wall Street cronies stay in place
[3:09:30.340 --> 3:09:32.340]  And they wouldn't listen
[3:09:32.340 --> 3:09:35.340]  Now as soon as Bush left office they suddenly woke up to all these issues
[3:09:35.340 --> 3:09:38.340]  And got upset because now they saw Obama carrying out the issues
[3:09:38.340 --> 3:09:42.340]  Suddenly Democrats that could see what Bush was doing that was wrong
[3:09:42.340 --> 3:09:46.340]  Were blind to Obama and they'll get this sickening smile and say
[3:09:46.340 --> 3:09:50.340]  You're just jealous of him, you're just a Republican, you're just a racist
[3:09:50.340 --> 3:09:53.340]  You just don't like him, you got to give him time
[3:09:53.340 --> 3:09:56.340]  When he's lied, as we mentioned earlier, about everything
[3:09:56.340 --> 3:10:00.340]  A new standard in lying, worse than Clinton, worse than Bush
[3:10:00.340 --> 3:10:02.340]  Worse than Tricky Dick Nixon
[3:10:02.340 --> 3:10:05.340]  Now they're having to give Senate speeches on the floor about his enemies list
[3:10:05.340 --> 3:10:11.340]  I'm listed in the news as in the top 25 White House enemies for Obama deception
[3:10:11.340 --> 3:10:13.340]  They're really going to hate Follow the Republic
[3:10:13.340 --> 3:10:15.340]  It's now launched, it's now dropped
[3:10:15.340 --> 3:10:20.340]  And it's this delusional syndrome where either people are waking up more than ever
[3:10:20.340 --> 3:10:23.340]  We see a quickening there, huge numbers waking up
[3:10:23.340 --> 3:10:27.340]  But still those that are staying asleep are getting even stupider
[3:10:27.340 --> 3:10:32.340]  They love being abused, they love being lied to, they love being scammed
[3:10:32.340 --> 3:10:34.340]  They think it's cute, they think it's funny
[3:10:34.340 --> 3:10:37.340]  They have invested in Obama, they have invested in the government
[3:10:37.340 --> 3:10:41.340]  I have the Wall Street Journal with the head of the healthcare lobby
[3:10:41.340 --> 3:10:45.340]  Admitting that the insurance companies wrote this as a looting
[3:10:45.340 --> 3:10:47.340]  And that the government wants a new tax
[3:10:47.340 --> 3:10:49.340]  So they're going to split it with the insurance companies
[3:10:49.340 --> 3:10:52.340]  And that they may back out because of citizen pressure
[3:10:52.340 --> 3:10:57.340]  By both liberals and conservatives against $5,000 fines
[3:10:57.340 --> 3:11:01.340]  They want that, Obama only wants $2,000 fines if you don't get insurance
[3:11:01.340 --> 3:11:03.340]  That they're pulling out of what they wrote
[3:11:03.340 --> 3:11:07.340]  And they admit that in this insurer's stand against committee's plan
[3:11:07.340 --> 3:11:11.340]  So we hear the fake left saying, oh Alex, you don't want the healthcare plan
[3:11:11.340 --> 3:11:13.340]  Because you work for the insurance companies
[3:11:13.340 --> 3:11:15.340]  When the insurance companies wrote the stinking thing
[3:11:15.340 --> 3:11:18.340]  It's like, it's a matrix of lies
[3:11:18.340 --> 3:11:22.340]  The lies are so big that the general public just doesn't even know what to do
[3:11:22.340 --> 3:11:25.340]  It's like the media, Gerald, saying there's no mercury in the shot
[3:11:25.340 --> 3:11:29.340]  As I mentioned, when I have the insert for the H1N1 shot right here
[3:11:29.340 --> 3:11:32.340]  And FDA.gov saying it can give you gillian berets
[3:11:32.340 --> 3:11:35.340]  And can sterilize you and give you cancer
[3:11:35.340 --> 3:11:38.340]  I mean, it's just, what's going to happen to the system
[3:11:38.340 --> 3:11:43.340]  As people finally wake up to the fact that they've been completely screwed
[3:11:43.340 --> 3:11:48.340]  Well again, we're seeing it, this is again, as we've mentioned many times
[3:11:48.340 --> 3:11:51.340]  And they've been writing about it since 2002
[3:11:51.340 --> 3:11:54.340]  And that this is much more than an economic crisis
[3:11:54.340 --> 3:11:57.340]  This is the decline of Empire America
[3:11:57.340 --> 3:11:59.340]  We've lost our morality
[3:11:59.340 --> 3:12:03.340]  And morals don't change, values do
[3:12:03.340 --> 3:12:06.340]  And people have lost their own self-respect
[3:12:06.340 --> 3:12:08.340]  When they talk about healthcare reform
[3:12:08.340 --> 3:12:10.340]  What are you going to reform?
[3:12:10.340 --> 3:12:13.340]  Look at this nation as a junk food eating nation
[3:12:13.340 --> 3:12:15.340]  They poison their bodies with junk food
[3:12:15.340 --> 3:12:18.340]  And they poison their minds with junk information
[3:12:18.340 --> 3:12:22.340]  How could any intelligent adult turn on the TV
[3:12:22.340 --> 3:12:26.340]  And listen to the nightly news or any of this other stuff
[3:12:26.340 --> 3:12:30.340]  When you have these bad actors, these great D actors reading scripts
[3:12:30.340 --> 3:12:33.340]  And they talk about Michael Jackson for a month and a half
[3:12:33.340 --> 3:12:39.340]  So the people, again, America is the first, second and third world nation wrapped into one
[3:12:39.340 --> 3:12:43.340]  We're looking at a good 20% of the people right now
[3:12:43.340 --> 3:12:47.340]  That are neither right or left, they're all independent thinkers
[3:12:47.340 --> 3:12:52.340]  That are going to be at the forefront of this revolution
[3:12:52.340 --> 3:12:55.340]  So again, we see this breaking down
[3:12:55.340 --> 3:12:58.340]  And we also see the nation breaking down
[3:12:58.340 --> 3:13:02.340]  And we can see it breaking down into smaller parts
[3:13:02.340 --> 3:13:04.340]  Well, Gerald, before the mainstream media
[3:13:04.340 --> 3:13:07.340]  With other inoculation campaigns they push
[3:13:07.340 --> 3:13:10.340]  They would just beat around the bush
[3:13:10.340 --> 3:13:12.340]  Never say there wasn't mercury in it
[3:13:12.340 --> 3:13:14.340]  They would just leave that out and say it's safe
[3:13:14.340 --> 3:13:18.340]  Now the New York Times and government program for public schools lies
[3:13:18.340 --> 3:13:22.340]  And gives parents and school children a handout
[3:13:22.340 --> 3:13:26.340]  Saying there is no mercury, there is no adjuvants
[3:13:26.340 --> 3:13:28.340]  It cannot, there are no side effects
[3:13:28.340 --> 3:13:32.340]  When every of the five versions of the vaccine
[3:13:32.340 --> 3:13:35.340]  I'm holding one, anyone can get this at Walgreens
[3:13:35.340 --> 3:13:39.340]  Saying it can give you neurological disorders
[3:13:39.340 --> 3:13:42.340]  Saying it can sterilize you, saying it has mercury
[3:13:42.340 --> 3:13:45.340]  I mean, I'm reading from FDA.gov
[3:13:45.340 --> 3:13:48.340]  Influenza H1NWain 2009
[3:13:48.340 --> 3:13:52.340]  Vaccine information sheet, Diagnostics Limited
[3:13:52.340 --> 3:13:55.340]  Put out by norvidus the main vaccine maker
[3:13:55.340 --> 3:14:00.340]  Look, the New York Times is the paper that took the nation to war
[3:14:00.340 --> 3:14:05.340]  Against the rock with the stories of, remember the aluminum tubes
[3:14:05.340 --> 3:14:07.340]  And the yellow cake
[3:14:07.340 --> 3:14:11.340]  I mean, this is the New York Times that promoted the war
[3:14:11.340 --> 3:14:15.340]  This is the New York Times that when the markets were unfolding
[3:14:15.340 --> 3:14:21.340]  In August of 2007 quoted all these experts that said
[3:14:21.340 --> 3:14:25.340]  Oh, it's just a hiccup here in front of me
[3:14:25.340 --> 3:14:29.340]  The New York Times last Saturday, October 17th
[3:14:29.340 --> 3:14:31.340]  This guy goes on to say
[3:14:31.340 --> 3:14:34.340]  Well, there are plenty of experts who will tell you the worst is over
[3:14:34.340 --> 3:14:36.340]  And I hope they're right
[3:14:36.340 --> 3:14:39.340]  But as Mr. Roth about this book discovered in the 1930s
[3:14:39.340 --> 3:14:45.340]  The experts can't predict the future any better than the rest of us
[3:14:45.340 --> 3:14:50.340]  Yes, we can predict the future better than they can
[3:14:50.340 --> 3:14:54.340]  What's the arrogance of the New York Times?
[3:14:54.340 --> 3:14:57.340]  Well, you said it though, they're delusional
[3:14:57.340 --> 3:15:00.340]  Don't they know that's why they're all going under and going bankrupt?
[3:15:00.340 --> 3:15:04.340]  Don't they know that's why mainstream media is in a crisis?
[3:15:04.340 --> 3:15:08.340]  And instead of telling the truth, they just intensify the lying
[3:15:08.340 --> 3:15:11.340]  It's like putting gasoline on a fire to put it out
[3:15:11.340 --> 3:15:16.340]  The members of the same club, it's the White Shoe Boys Club
[3:15:16.340 --> 3:15:19.340]  That's why you go to Harvard, Princeton and Yale
[3:15:19.340 --> 3:15:22.340]  What do you think? They don't teach you better than anywhere else
[3:15:22.340 --> 3:15:24.340]  It's you get into the system
[3:15:24.340 --> 3:15:27.340]  And you look at the same, you read the New York Times
[3:15:27.340 --> 3:15:31.340]  They quote the same experts that have been wrong
[3:15:31.340 --> 3:15:35.340]  100 times before to ask them what's going to happen
[3:15:35.340 --> 3:15:40.340]  Next, and then they have the arrogance to say that nobody can forecast the future
[3:15:40.340 --> 3:15:43.340]  Because they didn't see it coming
[3:15:43.340 --> 3:15:46.340]  And again, this is the paper that took the nation to war
[3:15:46.340 --> 3:15:50.340]  Let's not forget the stories about the yellow cake
[3:15:50.340 --> 3:15:54.340]  And the aluminum tubes and the nuclear weapons in Iraq
[3:15:54.340 --> 3:15:57.340]  It's just another level of lying though
[3:15:57.340 --> 3:15:59.340]  To say there are no adverse reactions to the vaccine
[3:15:59.340 --> 3:16:01.340]  Exactly, it's just another lie
[3:16:01.340 --> 3:16:04.340]  What's new to it? This is what they're good at
[3:16:04.340 --> 3:16:07.340]  Michael in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead
[3:16:07.340 --> 3:16:11.340]  Hi Alex, hi Gerald, I love the movie
[3:16:11.340 --> 3:16:13.340]  Thank you, what's on your mind?
[3:16:13.340 --> 3:16:17.340]  Yeah, I have a question or maybe it's just a comment
[3:16:17.340 --> 3:16:20.340]  It's about the movie in the Federal Reserve
[3:16:20.340 --> 3:16:29.340]  Basically, my question is if our politicians, if our Congress is all corrupt
[3:16:29.340 --> 3:16:32.340]  They're passing bills without even reading them
[3:16:32.340 --> 3:16:36.340]  And they're giving all our money away to offshore banks
[3:16:36.340 --> 3:16:46.340]  Another gentleman that was interviewed in your movie said that he was in favor of nationalizing the Fed
[3:16:46.340 --> 3:16:48.340]  And putting the Fed in the hands of Congress
[3:16:48.340 --> 3:16:53.340]  How could we trust putting the Fed in the hands of Congress if they're all corrupt?
[3:16:53.340 --> 3:16:55.340]  I'd like to comment on that
[3:16:55.340 --> 3:16:59.340]  Number one, we have different guests on who have different perspectives
[3:16:59.340 --> 3:17:04.340]  This is not like some cult where we just sit here and believe what I think or believe what one guest thinks
[3:17:04.340 --> 3:17:08.340]  It's a college of ideas to get people really thinking about details
[3:17:08.340 --> 3:17:14.340]  But number one, the Constitution says that the Congress is the boss
[3:17:14.340 --> 3:17:19.340]  Because the people elect them, they follow the Constitution, the President then executes
[3:17:19.340 --> 3:17:22.340]  The President just doesn't do what he wants
[3:17:22.340 --> 3:17:29.340]  The Congress ran the coining and issuance of currency and credit, set the rules until 1913
[3:17:29.340 --> 3:17:36.340]  And our nation on average had a 10% growth rate from 1789 until 1913
[3:17:36.340 --> 3:17:38.340]  Now look at us today
[3:17:38.340 --> 3:17:43.340]  We built the capital, we built the nation, we built this wealth without an offshore banking cartel
[3:17:43.340 --> 3:17:49.340]  Playing hanky-panky with the interest rates and the money and giving themselves unlimited cash
[3:17:49.340 --> 3:17:53.340]  And so, yes, we need to nationalize the Fed
[3:17:53.340 --> 3:17:58.340]  And Ron Paul and others have a plan under the Constitution to get us out of this crisis we're in
[3:17:58.340 --> 3:18:02.340]  If not, these bankers are going to keep raping us, Gerald Salente
[3:18:02.340 --> 3:18:04.340]  Well, you hit it
[3:18:04.340 --> 3:18:08.340]  The Federal Reserve is Washington and Washington is the Federal Reserve
[3:18:08.340 --> 3:18:14.340]  At the break I was mentioning about how Obama said about the too big to fail Jesus,
[3:18:14.340 --> 3:18:17.340]  Dumb analogy about your neighbor's house burning down
[3:18:17.340 --> 3:18:22.340]  And then on 60 minutes, Ben Bernanke several months later said, quote,
[3:18:22.340 --> 3:18:29.340]  If you have a neighbor who smokes in bed and he risks to everybody using the same exact analogy
[3:18:29.340 --> 3:18:31.340]  His bogus analogy
[3:18:31.340 --> 3:18:37.340]  And the point being is that there is no separation between the Fed and Washington
[3:18:37.340 --> 3:18:39.340]  Federal Reserve is Washington
[3:18:39.340 --> 3:18:42.340]  Look who the Treasury Secretary is
[3:18:42.340 --> 3:18:46.340]  Only a blind person can't see it
[3:18:46.340 --> 3:18:48.340]  It's Timothy Geithner
[3:18:48.340 --> 3:18:51.340]  Where did Timothy Geithner come from?
[3:18:51.340 --> 3:18:55.340]  Well, he was the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
[3:18:55.340 --> 3:18:58.340]  And now he's in charge of the Treasury
[3:18:58.340 --> 3:19:01.340]  What do people need to get over that with?
[3:19:01.340 --> 3:19:03.340]  Let me go further
[3:19:03.340 --> 3:19:08.340]  And the guy talking about, well, somebody smoked in bed, we still got to put the fire out
[3:19:08.340 --> 3:19:13.340]  It's Bernanke and Geithner and all these private bank heads that are the ones smoking in bed
[3:19:13.340 --> 3:19:15.340]  But they weren't just smoking in bed
[3:19:15.340 --> 3:19:19.340]  They're the ones burning the houses down because they own and run the fire department
[3:19:19.340 --> 3:19:21.340]  And we didn't pay our protection money
[3:19:21.340 --> 3:19:24.340]  And even when we pay them the tens of trillions of protection money
[3:19:24.340 --> 3:19:27.340]  They just leveraged that against our economy to buy us up
[3:19:27.340 --> 3:19:30.340]  They're pirates, can't people get it?
[3:19:30.340 --> 3:19:32.340]  They're criminal pirates, as Ron Paul has said
[3:19:32.340 --> 3:19:36.340]  There isn't a grand jury in the country that couldn't indict every one of them
[3:19:36.340 --> 3:19:38.340]  For insider trading conflicts of interest
[3:19:38.340 --> 3:19:42.340]  You got all these Treasury Department heads making tens of millions apiece
[3:19:42.340 --> 3:19:47.340]  In some cases billions off of money they gave to their own stinking banks
[3:19:47.340 --> 3:19:49.340]  I know
[3:19:49.340 --> 3:19:52.340]  I know it, how could anybody not see it?
[3:19:52.340 --> 3:19:56.340]  This is the greatest bank robbery in history
[3:19:56.340 --> 3:19:58.340]  But the banks are doing the robbing
[3:19:58.340 --> 3:20:01.340]  Man, I got a headache, I just got so mad
[3:20:01.340 --> 3:20:03.340]  Stay where there's more calls for it, as you're also wondering
[3:20:03.340 --> 3:20:07.340]  How many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[3:20:07.340 --> 3:20:10.340]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either
[3:20:10.340 --> 3:20:16.340]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form
[3:20:16.340 --> 3:20:19.340]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant
[3:20:19.340 --> 3:20:23.340]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes
[3:20:23.340 --> 3:20:26.340]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection
[3:20:26.340 --> 3:20:32.340]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info
[3:20:32.340 --> 3:20:34.340]  That's NoGerms.info
[3:20:34.340 --> 3:20:39.340]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well
[3:20:39.340 --> 3:20:43.340]  When they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid
[3:20:43.340 --> 3:20:49.340]  Don't pick your nose, don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails and doorknobs
[3:20:49.340 --> 3:20:54.340]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners
[3:20:54.340 --> 3:20:58.340]  Go to NoGerms.info, that's NoGerms.info
[3:20:58.340 --> 3:21:02.340]  Be well and stay well, best MZ
[3:21:02.340 --> 3:21:06.340]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[3:21:06.340 --> 3:21:10.340]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[3:21:10.340 --> 3:21:15.340]  We're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[3:21:15.340 --> 3:21:19.340]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[3:21:19.340 --> 3:21:21.340]  And they really are calling the shots
[3:21:21.340 --> 3:21:26.340]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[3:21:26.340 --> 3:21:29.340]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[3:21:29.340 --> 3:21:34.340]  The criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty
[3:21:34.340 --> 3:21:36.340]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[3:21:36.340 --> 3:21:40.340]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and their arsonists, they're asking for more matches
[3:21:40.340 --> 3:21:42.340]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:21:42.340 --> 3:21:44.340]  Today it seems like nobody does care
[3:21:44.340 --> 3:21:49.340]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic

[3:23:26.340 --> 3:23:37.340]  I'm Mattين
[3:23:37.340 --> 3:23:36.460]  I want to hear about the
[3:23:36.460 --> 3:23:37.340]  Yeah, cool.
[3:23:37.340 --> 3:23:40.340]  All you have to say about it.
[3:23:40.340 --> 3:23:41.340]  It's a land of DEFUNCATION
[3:23:41.340 --> 3:23:52.780]  Commitment of our family,
[3:23:52.780 --> 3:23:56.180]  your family can have, even more valuable than gold.

[3:24:26.180 --> 3:24:42.300]  Hi there, it's great to be on the show with you guys.
[3:24:42.300 --> 3:24:46.180]  You guys have the excellent show, I'm always excited to hear both of you speaking.
[3:24:46.180 --> 3:24:52.180]  First I wanted to ask a question about the PPFA award, if you know about the Margaret
[3:24:52.180 --> 3:24:53.180]  Sanger Award.
[3:24:53.180 --> 3:24:57.780]  I know Margaret Sanger was a top eugenicist and best friends with Adolf Hitler.
[3:24:57.780 --> 3:25:01.780]  The Rockefellers gave her the money and she said blacks were subhuman but we have to pose
[3:25:01.780 --> 3:25:06.020]  as liberals so we can set up death centers in their neighborhoods and so the liberals
[3:25:06.020 --> 3:25:08.900]  love it and offer their children up to the state.
[3:25:08.900 --> 3:25:11.180]  But I'm not familiar with this award.
[3:25:11.180 --> 3:25:13.180]  Well, this is interesting.
[3:25:13.180 --> 3:25:18.100]  I'll tell you what, I'm going to come back to you because this isn't for Gerald Salente.
[3:25:18.100 --> 3:25:19.220]  We don't stay there, Nikki.
[3:25:19.220 --> 3:25:22.420]  We don't screen the calls but when we go to you and it's not for the guest.
[3:25:22.420 --> 3:25:23.420]  You know what?
[3:25:23.420 --> 3:25:24.420]  I'm just going to go to calls.
[3:25:24.420 --> 3:25:27.740]  I know a lot of these are for Gerald but with the time we have left, Gerald, finish
[3:25:27.740 --> 3:25:34.180]  up with other trends, other predictions because current events form future trends in the last
[3:25:34.180 --> 3:25:35.180]  three minutes.
[3:25:35.180 --> 3:25:37.140]  Tell us what else we should be on the lookout for.
[3:25:37.140 --> 3:25:39.660]  By the way, Gerald Salente is in fall of the Republic.
[3:25:39.660 --> 3:25:40.660]  Go ahead.
[3:25:40.660 --> 3:25:45.460]  What people should be aware of now is that anything can happen and this is a time for
[3:25:45.460 --> 3:25:47.460]  survival strategies.
[3:25:47.460 --> 3:25:48.700]  So prepare for the worst.
[3:25:48.700 --> 3:25:53.260]  Joey's could move back from that and we're very concerned about the probabilities of
[3:25:53.260 --> 3:26:00.700]  bank holidays, dollar devaluation and those are our major concerns right now.
[3:26:00.700 --> 3:26:05.780]  With the holidays coming up again, you know, rain and spending, don't spend an extra penny
[3:26:05.780 --> 3:26:11.300]  that you don't have to and again, don't support anything corporate that you don't have to.
[3:26:11.300 --> 3:26:17.340]  The major trends we're looking at coming along the line is this trend we call selective
[3:26:17.340 --> 3:26:22.100]  technology, learning how to do things simply.
[3:26:22.100 --> 3:26:26.860]  A great story what's going on in India right now and this is how you could start making
[3:26:26.860 --> 3:26:27.860]  money.
[3:26:27.860 --> 3:26:33.220]  They're using technology to help the poorest people so they have cell phones for example
[3:26:33.220 --> 3:26:41.260]  that only cost $20, refrigerators that cost $70, little stoves that cost $43, high technology.
[3:26:41.260 --> 3:26:46.780]  I'm saying this because people looking for opportunities start looking for these kind
[3:26:46.780 --> 3:26:51.620]  of things to start selling in the states because the standard of living is going to continue
[3:26:51.620 --> 3:26:52.620]  to decline.
[3:26:52.620 --> 3:26:54.620]  Necessity is the mother of invention.
[3:26:54.620 --> 3:27:00.100]  So we're going to see a lot of inventing opportunities to start providing new products
[3:27:00.100 --> 3:27:02.700]  and services to a declining economy.
[3:27:02.700 --> 3:27:05.100]  These are the ways to look.
[3:27:05.100 --> 3:27:12.740]  Also, in the old areas of old cities, you're going to start seeing them rebirth.
[3:27:12.740 --> 3:27:17.320]  So people that are looking for investment opportunities in real estate, as we are up
[3:27:17.320 --> 3:27:21.940]  here in Kingston, New York, you start looking for those beautiful old cities that haven't
[3:27:21.940 --> 3:27:27.420]  been destroyed through urban renewal because young people are going to be looking for places
[3:27:27.420 --> 3:27:28.420]  to live.
[3:27:28.420 --> 3:27:31.180]  They're going to start moving back into these areas.
[3:27:31.180 --> 3:27:32.420]  So those are areas that can...
[3:27:32.420 --> 3:27:33.820]  By the way, that's already starting.
[3:27:33.820 --> 3:27:37.740]  We're already seeing a lot of people getting out of the cities into the country.
[3:27:37.740 --> 3:27:38.740]  Right.
[3:27:38.740 --> 3:27:42.140]  And especially these great old small towns.
[3:27:42.140 --> 3:27:47.740]  So those are the areas to look at, a rebuilding of community, and that old saying, use it
[3:27:47.740 --> 3:27:51.140]  up, wear it out, make it do, do without.
[3:27:51.140 --> 3:27:56.140]  Start buying quality products, everything American, grow your own food, become more
[3:27:56.140 --> 3:27:57.620]  self-sustaining.
[3:27:57.620 --> 3:28:03.540]  The products that you have on Prison Planet and the other places around, those are the
[3:28:03.540 --> 3:28:05.620]  things to start looking into.
[3:28:05.620 --> 3:28:11.540]  Heal yourself health care for this nation to get into shape and for people to survive
[3:28:11.540 --> 3:28:20.100]  what's coming ahead, you need to be healthy spiritually, emotionally, and physically.
[3:28:20.100 --> 3:28:24.740]  And in closing, in the minute and a half we have left, I hope people will visit trendsresearch.com
[3:28:24.740 --> 3:28:28.260]  and check out all your other great work and also check you out and follow the Republic
[3:28:28.260 --> 3:28:30.860]  that just was released yesterday.
[3:28:30.860 --> 3:28:33.780]  In closing, when will the tyranny peak?
[3:28:33.780 --> 3:28:35.980]  When do you think we're going to come out of it, 2012, 2013?
[3:28:35.980 --> 3:28:39.100]  We don't see us coming at it as for a long time economically.
[3:28:39.100 --> 3:28:41.740]  This is a long decline.
[3:28:41.740 --> 3:28:48.020]  The only reason we got out of the last ones, Alex, go back to the dot-com bust of 2000.
[3:28:48.020 --> 3:28:51.420]  The five trillion dollars is wiped out of the market.
[3:28:51.420 --> 3:28:56.860]  The way they got it out was they lowered interest rates to 46-year lows.
[3:28:56.860 --> 3:29:01.820]  Now they've done it again and they created the credit crisis in the real estate bubble.
[3:29:01.820 --> 3:29:04.100]  Now they've created the bailout bubble.
[3:29:04.100 --> 3:29:09.260]  What we're concerned about is that after the bailout bubble blows up, then they take you
[3:29:09.260 --> 3:29:10.260]  to war.
[3:29:10.260 --> 3:29:16.860]  So we're telling people to be on the alert, don't buy into the lies, and fight the tyranny
[3:29:16.860 --> 3:29:20.700]  ahead that's coming ahead by being knowledgeable.
[3:29:20.700 --> 3:29:26.980]  So we're going to start also more and more pitting us against other people, like they've
[3:29:26.980 --> 3:29:32.420]  taught us how to hate the Iranians, how to hate Muslims, beware of this kind of fear
[3:29:32.420 --> 3:29:33.420]  tactic.
[3:29:33.420 --> 3:29:38.500]  You know, the big lie works better than the little lie, so the big lie, watch out for
[3:29:38.500 --> 3:29:39.500]  that one.
[3:29:39.500 --> 3:29:40.500]  Hit them.
[3:29:40.500 --> 3:29:41.500]  Use the big lie.
[3:29:41.500 --> 3:29:43.020]  They're going to use the big lie once again.
[3:29:43.020 --> 3:29:44.020]  All right.
[3:29:44.020 --> 3:29:45.020]  Gerald Salente, great job.
[3:29:45.020 --> 3:29:46.020]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[3:29:46.020 --> 3:29:47.020]  We'll come back.
[3:29:47.020 --> 3:29:48.020]  Take calls.
[3:29:48.020 --> 3:29:49.020]  Blitz through some news.
[3:29:49.020 --> 3:29:50.020]  Stay with us.
[3:29:50.020 --> 3:29:52.020]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:29:52.020 --> 3:29:53.300]  We're on the march.
[3:29:53.300 --> 3:29:55.700]  The empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.700 --> 3:30:01.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:01.500 --> 3:30:06.180]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[3:30:06.180 --> 3:30:07.180]  you to eat.
[3:30:07.180 --> 3:30:10.700]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[3:30:10.700 --> 3:30:13.660]  sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[3:30:13.660 --> 3:30:15.300]  You don't have to cooperate.
[3:30:15.300 --> 3:30:16.620]  There is a solution.
[3:30:16.620 --> 3:30:20.180]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[3:30:20.180 --> 3:30:24.980]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[3:30:37.620 --> 3:30:38.620]  manager.
[3:30:38.620 --> 3:30:43.300]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your
[3:30:43.300 --> 3:30:44.500]  immune system.

[3:31:03.500 --> 3:31:07.220]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:31:07.220 --> 3:31:10.380]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:31:10.380 --> 3:31:14.700]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:31:14.700 --> 3:31:15.700]  at home.
[3:31:15.700 --> 3:31:20.860]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress and they really are calling the
[3:31:20.860 --> 3:31:21.860]  shots.
[3:31:21.860 --> 3:31:26.660]  It's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:31:26.660 --> 3:31:32.140]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[3:31:32.140 --> 3:31:36.780]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:31:36.780 --> 3:31:41.220]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[3:31:41.220 --> 3:31:43.220]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:31:43.220 --> 3:31:49.260]  Today it seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[3:31:49.260 --> 3:31:50.260]  of the Republic.

[3:32:05.060 --> 3:32:07.220]  Now going green can save money.
[3:32:07.220 --> 3:32:11.380]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the
[3:32:11.380 --> 3:32:12.780]  Renaissance charger.

[3:32:26.540 --> 3:32:31.700]  the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[3:32:31.700 --> 3:32:33.980]  and maintaining cell integrity.

[3:32:58.740 --> 3:33:17.020]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[3:33:17.020 --> 3:33:22.820]  I want to go to your phone calls, but first I wanted to point out, look at these graphs
[3:33:22.820 --> 3:33:24.580]  here.
[3:33:24.580 --> 3:33:30.380]  That is the five-year gold graph.
[3:33:30.380 --> 3:33:44.300]  Five years ago, gold was $400 an ounce and today it is right at $1,060 an ounce.
[3:33:44.300 --> 3:33:49.220]  Look at the 10-year gold in the graph right next to it.
[3:33:49.220 --> 3:33:59.100]  Go back 10 years, 10 years ago it was $300 an ounce, nine years ago it was $290 an ounce,
[3:33:59.100 --> 3:34:11.300]  eight years ago it was $330 an ounce on average, four years ago it was $360 on average, five
[3:34:11.300 --> 3:34:21.860]  years ago it was $450 on average, six years ago and it goes up to a year and a half ago
[3:34:21.860 --> 3:34:29.740]  it was $700, then $800, then $900, then $1,000 and now $1,600.
[3:34:29.740 --> 3:34:36.180]  Who can't look at that graph and go, hmm, and you try comparing that to the stock market,
[3:34:36.180 --> 3:34:38.980]  you try comparing that to anything else and that's because they're killing the dollar
[3:34:38.980 --> 3:34:39.980]  right there.
[3:34:39.980 --> 3:34:43.780]  I haven't plugged gold in a couple days.
[3:34:43.780 --> 3:34:49.060]  I will tell you that Ted Anderson told me privately that unless gold plunges, which
[3:34:49.060 --> 3:34:56.660]  he isn't expecting to happen, the gold prices he has are going to be going up next week.
[3:34:56.660 --> 3:35:01.940]  Here are the offers I have for you from Midas Resources, our great gold sponsor, the place
[3:35:01.940 --> 3:35:06.460]  I get my precious metals.
[3:35:06.460 --> 3:35:15.260]  They have the British sovereign gold coin at $293.
[3:35:15.260 --> 3:35:22.260]  They have the 20 franc gold coin at $238.
[3:35:22.260 --> 3:35:24.540]  This is the price it was a month ago.
[3:35:24.540 --> 3:35:35.700]  They have the Lakota silver at $22 a piece and the even better deal is they have the
[3:35:35.700 --> 3:35:41.220]  silver half dollars, the walking liberty half dollars at $869 a piece.
[3:35:41.220 --> 3:35:45.260]  You cannot find silver anywhere at that price.
[3:35:45.260 --> 3:35:52.300]  This is absolute loss leader and I'll tell you, I've seen the markup on these gold coins.
[3:35:52.300 --> 3:35:57.140]  Take this $20 franc gold coin and again, this is Ted buying this month ago when gold was
[3:35:57.140 --> 3:36:00.460]  $100 less than it is right now.
[3:36:00.460 --> 3:36:05.820]  Even with the market buying gold when the market was $100 lower, there was only about
[3:36:05.820 --> 3:36:09.260]  four and a half dollars of markup in that for Ted.
[3:36:09.260 --> 3:36:11.360]  That's the kind of deal you're getting, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:36:11.360 --> 3:36:12.820]  You cannot beat these deals.
[3:36:12.820 --> 3:36:13.980]  Give Midas Resources a call.
[3:36:13.980 --> 3:36:18.940]  The brokers are there until midnight tonight, 800-686-2237.
[3:36:18.940 --> 3:36:21.460]  Quit procrastinating, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:36:21.460 --> 3:36:27.100]  Gold has now been above $150 for what is it, two, three weeks longer?
[3:36:27.100 --> 3:36:32.340]  I mean, it's settled in at a new low of around $1,040.
[3:36:32.340 --> 3:36:37.500]  It's right up at $1,060 right now after the close.
[3:36:37.500 --> 3:36:40.580]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, be sure and check this out.
[3:36:40.580 --> 3:36:42.420]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to take advantage of this.
[3:36:42.420 --> 3:36:43.420]  You'll be paying the higher price.
[3:36:43.420 --> 3:36:44.820]  It's still a great deal.
[3:36:44.820 --> 3:36:49.860]  800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[3:36:49.860 --> 3:36:50.940]  Try Midas Resources out.
[3:36:50.940 --> 3:36:51.940]  Go call them.
[3:36:51.940 --> 3:36:56.020]  Call them buy a couple gold coins, a little bag of silver coins, a roll of silver coins.
[3:36:56.020 --> 3:37:00.100]  Whatever the case is, 800-686-2237.
[3:37:00.100 --> 3:37:02.900]  And you look at that graph, for those that are watching this on the TV show, but anybody
[3:37:02.900 --> 3:37:07.540]  can just Google the five-year, 10-year gold graph or silver graph.
[3:37:07.540 --> 3:37:10.100]  They both behave almost exactly the same.
[3:37:10.100 --> 3:37:11.260]  Look at that.
[3:37:11.260 --> 3:37:22.260]  I mean, in the last seven years, we've seen a 340% increase in the price of gold.
[3:37:22.260 --> 3:37:27.300]  It's coming in on a quadrupling soon.
[3:37:27.300 --> 3:37:32.660]  But if you want to hold junk bonds and paper, be my guest, 800-686-2237.
[3:37:32.660 --> 3:37:37.100]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones special.
[3:37:37.100 --> 3:37:38.540]  And I want to thank Midas Resources.
[3:37:38.540 --> 3:37:42.220]  Ted has been syndicating my radio show for 12 years now, and I couldn't have done it
[3:37:42.220 --> 3:37:43.540]  without Ted Anderson.
[3:37:43.540 --> 3:37:46.100]  He has stood behind me from the beginning.
[3:37:46.100 --> 3:37:51.100]  And as we expand, I want to thank him for his support, 800-686-2237.
[3:37:51.100 --> 3:37:53.700]  By enclosing, I want to tell you about a few of the other sponsors that made today's show
[3:37:53.700 --> 3:37:57.180]  possible, because we don't have big globalist funding here.
[3:37:57.180 --> 3:37:59.620]  You're funding us with these great sponsors that you support.
[3:37:59.620 --> 3:38:00.620]  New silver solution.
[3:38:00.620 --> 3:38:04.820]  People all over the world are discovering the benefits of supernatural silver.

[3:38:48.860 --> 3:38:49.860]  Okay.
[3:38:49.860 --> 3:38:52.860]  Let's get to these phone calls here.
[3:38:52.860 --> 3:38:56.980]  By the way, I got to go to a funeral Sunday, but we're going to have a great best of on
[3:38:56.980 --> 3:39:00.660]  the Sunday 4 to 6 show for you this Sunday.
[3:39:00.660 --> 3:39:02.820]  I just want to throw that out there now for people.
[3:39:02.820 --> 3:39:06.660]  Got to go to my grand uncle's funeral.
[3:39:06.660 --> 3:39:10.060]  Let's go ahead and get my call screen up here.
[3:39:10.060 --> 3:39:11.860]  Let's go ahead and talk to Luke.
[3:39:11.860 --> 3:39:12.860]  No, no, Nicky.
[3:39:12.860 --> 3:39:16.300]  I was going back to Nicky because she was bringing up some other subject.
[3:39:16.300 --> 3:39:17.300]  Go ahead, Nicky.
[3:39:17.300 --> 3:39:21.940]  Yeah, the question was actually for both of you guys because he was talking about the
[3:39:21.940 --> 3:39:25.820]  leadership that we're praising here in the United States today.
[3:39:25.820 --> 3:39:31.580]  The PPFA Margaret Sanger Award was given to Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Ted Turner,
[3:39:31.580 --> 3:39:35.540]  Phil Donahue, and the latest one to Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[3:39:35.540 --> 3:39:40.660]  This one had to refer to Dr. Martin Luther King, how he's being praised in the black
[3:39:40.660 --> 3:39:41.660]  community.
[3:39:41.660 --> 3:39:45.180]  A lot of people don't know this about him, and it refers to him as being an advocate
[3:39:45.180 --> 3:39:47.540]  for women's rights and family planning worldwide.
[3:39:47.540 --> 3:39:49.140]  So I just wanted you to know.
[3:39:49.140 --> 3:39:52.660]  Well, I mean, Martin Luther King was an eloquent speaker and also very intelligent, but he
[3:39:52.660 --> 3:39:53.900]  was also used a lot.
[3:39:53.900 --> 3:39:57.620]  I'm not defending him and I'm also not attacking him.
[3:39:57.620 --> 3:40:00.020]  A lot of what you hear about him is exaggerated and bad.
[3:40:00.020 --> 3:40:02.940]  A lot of what you hear good about him is exaggerated.
[3:40:02.940 --> 3:40:04.620]  I've done some research on King.
[3:40:04.620 --> 3:40:06.540]  They certainly did kill him.
[3:40:06.540 --> 3:40:12.940]  But the issue is WDB Du Bois and others, or EB Du Bois, was hired by Sanger.
[3:40:12.940 --> 3:40:17.740]  He said we got to hire black fronts, so they'll go sell these weeds on us being able to get
[3:40:17.740 --> 3:40:18.740]  rid of them.
[3:40:18.740 --> 3:40:20.780]  These are sickening quotes by her.
[3:40:20.780 --> 3:40:25.220]  And I know that he did support family planning and all of this because he was sold on it.
[3:40:25.220 --> 3:40:28.340]  I don't believe he was for it.
[3:40:28.340 --> 3:40:31.220]  But I mean, I don't believe he really understood.
[3:40:31.220 --> 3:40:36.660]  But yes, certainly Ted Turner and others you mentioned are just sickening racist eugenicists.
[3:40:36.660 --> 3:40:37.660]  Right.
[3:40:37.660 --> 3:40:41.500]  And another thing is, I found this online, it's called Notice to Checkpoint Agents for
[3:40:41.500 --> 3:40:45.260]  all these illegal checkpoints that are out here.
[3:40:45.260 --> 3:40:49.940]  You could keep this paper in your car, I've done it myself when I was in Arizona with
[3:40:49.940 --> 3:40:51.940]  a friend of mine.
[3:40:51.940 --> 3:40:55.740]  And they will stop you and they will ask you for your citizenship and you don't have to
[3:40:55.740 --> 3:40:58.460]  tell them anything because these are illegal checkpoints.
[3:40:58.460 --> 3:41:02.340]  And I presented them this paper and I was in the passenger side, actually gave it to
[3:41:02.340 --> 3:41:05.740]  my friend and she rolled her window down just a little bit, gave him this paper and they
[3:41:05.740 --> 3:41:09.260]  continued to harass her a little bit, but they let her go ahead and go about her way.
[3:41:09.260 --> 3:41:10.460]  So I just wanted to let people know.
[3:41:10.460 --> 3:41:12.700]  I've seen those, I've seen those and I appreciate your call.
[3:41:12.700 --> 3:41:16.340]  They are quite effective because they mentioned the U.S. Code and how false arrest and getting
[3:41:16.340 --> 3:41:21.540]  a lot of trouble and how they're not allowed to violate your Fifth Amendment look.
[3:41:21.540 --> 3:41:24.180]  They're talking about in U.S. News and World Report.
[3:41:24.180 --> 3:41:26.980]  Here it is.
[3:41:26.980 --> 3:41:30.260]  How on-star is being used to turn people's cars off by the police.
[3:41:30.260 --> 3:41:31.260]  That was always the plan.
[3:41:31.260 --> 3:41:32.940]  I told you that a decade ago.
[3:41:32.940 --> 3:41:33.940]  Not because I'm smart.
[3:41:33.940 --> 3:41:37.980]  I read the FBI's own statements.
[3:41:37.980 --> 3:41:39.980]  Other cars have built in kill switches in them.
[3:41:39.980 --> 3:41:43.180]  They're just now announcing this to the public.
[3:41:43.180 --> 3:41:44.740]  People say, oh, well, they can stop illegal aliens.
[3:41:44.740 --> 3:41:46.100]  They can stop criminals.
[3:41:46.100 --> 3:41:47.100]  Here's the deal.
[3:41:47.100 --> 3:41:48.100]  We can pull this up.
[3:41:48.100 --> 3:41:51.480]  I was in a bunch of newspapers a few months ago.
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:55.180]  When Homeland Security does four or five of these big raids on meat packing plants in
[3:41:55.180 --> 3:42:00.020]  places to go, oh, look, we're busting illegal aliens, over three million illegal aliens come
[3:42:00.020 --> 3:42:06.700]  in every year, over a million legal, and they deport in these raids, five, six, seven
[3:42:06.700 --> 3:42:09.500]  thousand in these big publicized raids.
[3:42:09.500 --> 3:42:14.220]  It's not even a drop in the bucket, more like a drop in the ocean.
[3:42:14.220 --> 3:42:15.220]  And these are stunts.
[3:42:15.220 --> 3:42:16.980]  And then they'll say, oh, we broke up this family.
[3:42:16.980 --> 3:42:22.660]  Oh, the kid got sent home with his parents, even though he was a citizen.
[3:42:22.660 --> 3:42:24.580]  You know, they pull on everybody's heartstrings.
[3:42:24.580 --> 3:42:28.380]  But it came out in the news that Homeland Security takes almost all those people, takes
[3:42:28.380 --> 3:42:32.940]  them and expedites them getting a green card, and just, and that the government then gives
[3:42:32.940 --> 3:42:33.940]  them jobs.
[3:42:33.940 --> 3:42:36.940]  In fact, I forget the exact headline.
[3:42:36.940 --> 3:42:37.940]  It was in the Wall Street Journal.
[3:42:37.940 --> 3:42:46.340]  It was, uh, ICE gives illegals jobs, they even gave them jobs building the fence that's
[3:42:46.340 --> 3:42:50.580]  all fake and couldn't even keep a person out, much less a deer.
[3:42:50.580 --> 3:42:52.900]  What was that exact headline?
[3:42:52.900 --> 3:43:00.260]  I've seen a bunch of them, but, but it was like, oh, look how nice they are.
[3:43:00.260 --> 3:43:06.700]  Maybe search this term, Homeland Security raids illegals, then gives them jobs or something
[3:43:06.700 --> 3:43:08.340]  like that.
[3:43:08.340 --> 3:43:09.340]  It's all staged.
[3:43:09.340 --> 3:43:13.900]  Like they have in every major city now, police cars that have cameras that read all your
[3:43:13.900 --> 3:43:14.900]  license plates.
[3:43:14.900 --> 3:43:18.660]  They've had it for over a decade, but now it's going in everywhere.
[3:43:18.660 --> 3:43:20.700]  And they drive around and they see stolen cars.
[3:43:20.700 --> 3:43:23.420]  They don't stop them nine times out of 10.
[3:43:23.420 --> 3:43:25.540]  Uh, they, they drive by illegal aliens.
[3:43:25.540 --> 3:43:26.540]  They leave them alone.
[3:43:26.540 --> 3:43:27.540]  I've talked to Austin cops.
[3:43:27.540 --> 3:43:31.140]  They're told don't arrest illegals when they're drunk driving, don't arrest illegals when
[3:43:31.140 --> 3:43:35.460]  they don't have their insurance or don't have their driver's license, but a citizen,
[3:43:35.460 --> 3:43:36.660]  they do.
[3:43:36.660 --> 3:43:40.920]  One night at the office, one of the IT guys, his license had been expired.
[3:43:40.920 --> 3:43:42.140]  He pulled into the office.
[3:43:42.140 --> 3:43:44.260]  The cop thought that was suspicious at night.
[3:43:44.260 --> 3:43:46.460]  How the cop was coming this way.
[3:43:46.460 --> 3:43:49.420]  And one of my, uh, he's actually a contractor turned in.
[3:43:49.420 --> 3:43:54.180]  They thought that was suspicious, whipped in behind him and said, Oh, and by then he'd
[3:43:54.180 --> 3:43:55.180]  gone in the office.
[3:43:55.180 --> 3:43:56.700]  They start banging on the door.
[3:43:56.700 --> 3:43:58.140]  He comes out and goes, what's the problem?
[3:43:58.140 --> 3:44:03.420]  They said, get out here, you know, uh, get him outside and they say, Oh, you were driving
[3:44:03.420 --> 3:44:04.420]  this.
[3:44:04.420 --> 3:44:05.420]  Your license is expired.
[3:44:05.420 --> 3:44:10.940]  And so, and so he called me once they were at the door and I was already coming to the
[3:44:10.940 --> 3:44:13.020]  office to meet him to do some work.
[3:44:13.020 --> 3:44:16.580]  It was like an eight o'clock at night and I get here and there's three police cars.
[3:44:16.580 --> 3:44:21.820]  They kind of blow up when I first walk up and heard that two of the cops were big fans.
[3:44:21.820 --> 3:44:24.260]  And I said, you know, if he was illegal alien, you would be arresting him.
[3:44:24.260 --> 3:44:25.260]  And he said, that's right.
[3:44:25.260 --> 3:44:26.260]  The judges get mad.
[3:44:26.260 --> 3:44:29.820]  If we do that, we're encouraged not to.
[3:44:29.820 --> 3:44:32.660]  And there have been sheriffs all over the country, one big case in Tennessee where they
[3:44:32.660 --> 3:44:39.140]  would arrest whole 18 wheelers smuggling illegals and ice won't come pick them up.
[3:44:39.140 --> 3:44:40.140]  This there it is.
[3:44:40.140 --> 3:44:44.820]  Homeland security freeze, 27 illegal immigrants, then sends them back to work.
[3:44:44.820 --> 3:44:46.380]  That's Fox news.
[3:44:46.380 --> 3:44:47.740]  That was out of Seattle.
[3:44:47.740 --> 3:44:51.220]  The department of Homeland security for 27 illegal immigrants arrested during a workplace
[3:44:51.220 --> 3:44:58.100]  raid in February and offered them legal work permits, signing a major departure, sailing
[3:44:58.100 --> 3:45:03.780]  a major departure from the immigration enforcement policy of the Bush administration and Bush
[3:45:03.780 --> 3:45:04.780]  did the same thing.
[3:45:04.780 --> 3:45:06.460]  Folks, I could pull up hundreds of these.
[3:45:06.460 --> 3:45:11.900]  I remember an AP article, maybe I can pull up the exact article from three years ago
[3:45:11.900 --> 3:45:14.540]  and they said, we know the economy is getting bad.
[3:45:14.540 --> 3:45:19.580]  And so we're going to give illegals home loans with no evidence, no paperwork.
[3:45:19.580 --> 3:45:22.380]  And how they do it is three major banks at the time.
[3:45:22.380 --> 3:45:27.100]  Wells Fargo was the first, Vicente Fox came here and gave them an award in Austin.
[3:45:27.100 --> 3:45:28.100]  It's in fall.
[3:45:28.100 --> 3:45:33.220]  It's in a battle for the Republic, the 17 minute mini film that's an extra on in game.
[3:45:33.220 --> 3:45:35.540]  I was going to put it in the film, but it didn't fit.
[3:45:35.540 --> 3:45:36.700]  So we just made it an extra.
[3:45:36.700 --> 3:45:39.100]  It's really informative.
[3:45:39.100 --> 3:45:45.420]  And Vicente Fox came in, gave Wells Fargo Warren Buffett an award and gave the Austin
[3:45:45.420 --> 3:45:51.580]  Police Department an award for not following the law and arresting illegals and Wells Fargo.
[3:45:51.580 --> 3:45:56.780]  Well, the police got the award for not arresting illegals and leaving them alone.
[3:45:56.780 --> 3:46:00.900]  They got an award for being criminals, but they'll throw the book at you, the stupid
[3:46:00.900 --> 3:46:05.100]  dumb American milk cow, whether you're Hispanic, black, white, they don't care.
[3:46:05.100 --> 3:46:06.700]  You're the sucker.
[3:46:06.700 --> 3:46:07.700]  Not the illegals.
[3:46:07.700 --> 3:46:10.900]  They're meant to drive down wages, bring down the country and the global system.
[3:46:10.900 --> 3:46:15.260]  That's in the CFR club of rums on documents.
[3:46:15.260 --> 3:46:19.180]  Professor pasture talks about it.
[3:46:19.180 --> 3:46:21.700]  He's an advocate of it.
[3:46:21.700 --> 3:46:22.700]  Said I'd take calls.
[3:46:22.700 --> 3:46:24.220]  Did you see this at thousands of points here?
[3:46:24.220 --> 3:46:28.260]  If I ever start covering news, I'll never even get to your calls ever.
[3:46:28.260 --> 3:46:32.780]  But he gave the police an award for being criminals and gave them across the country
[3:46:32.780 --> 3:46:37.700]  in big cities, Chicago, LA, but Austin was the smallest city I've seen.
[3:46:37.700 --> 3:46:40.220]  They gave it to them and the call around gives them awards too.
[3:46:40.220 --> 3:46:44.460]  And he gave Wells Fargo an award because Wells Fargo issues.
[3:46:44.460 --> 3:46:50.420]  He legals if they have a matricula, a Mexican consulate, Mexico makes their people have
[3:46:50.420 --> 3:46:52.060]  real IDs.
[3:46:52.060 --> 3:46:56.100]  But in the U S they issue, Austin has a consulate, it's called a mission.
[3:46:56.100 --> 3:47:00.260]  It's a smaller one where they just issue for $24 a fake ID.
[3:47:00.260 --> 3:47:04.140]  You can go in and get three at the same time and get three people on welfare.
[3:47:04.140 --> 3:47:08.500]  The same person under three names and that's all sent a lot of it sent to Mexico.
[3:47:08.500 --> 3:47:14.340]  Then if you have a consulate matricula, Wells Fargo gives them a debit card and a bank account.
[3:47:14.340 --> 3:47:20.820]  And then with that, they get a home loan and AP had bank executives admitting they're doing
[3:47:20.820 --> 3:47:23.580]  this when citizens don't get this.
[3:47:23.580 --> 3:47:24.580]  You go into your bank.
[3:47:24.580 --> 3:47:29.780]  They want three forms ID, thumb prints, your scum, your filth, your trash.
[3:47:29.780 --> 3:47:32.300]  But if you're an illegal, you are God.
[3:47:32.300 --> 3:47:35.780]  So all the face scanning cameras, license plate readers.
[3:47:35.780 --> 3:47:39.580]  It's all for the American people, homeland securities for the American people, Luke in
[3:47:39.580 --> 3:47:40.580]  North Carolina.
[3:47:40.580 --> 3:47:41.580]  You're on the air.
[3:47:41.580 --> 3:47:42.580]  Hi, Alex.
[3:47:42.580 --> 3:47:48.020]  Oh, just first one to say I love your show and your movie is phenomenal.
[3:47:48.020 --> 3:47:53.020]  And I've been reading over the global climate treaty and I just find like a bunch of words
[3:47:53.020 --> 3:47:56.700]  are repeated and just things that aren't like making sense to me.
[3:47:56.700 --> 3:48:00.660]  And I was wondering if you could like clarify like sure, I have the treaty or parts of it
[3:48:00.660 --> 3:48:02.180]  somewhere right here in front of me.
[3:48:02.180 --> 3:48:03.180]  Go ahead.
[3:48:03.180 --> 3:48:04.180]  All right.
[3:48:04.180 --> 3:48:07.620]  Well, there's business week in bracing illegals.
[3:48:07.620 --> 3:48:08.620]  I'm sorry.
[3:48:08.620 --> 3:48:09.620]  Go ahead.
[3:48:09.620 --> 3:48:10.620]  Okay.
[3:48:10.620 --> 3:48:17.420]  Um, the section of the RED system with like capacity building and it talks about like
[3:48:17.420 --> 3:48:22.700]  an AMA, like incorporating an AMA to like parties and everything.
[3:48:22.700 --> 3:48:25.260]  It's a thousand plus page treaty.
[3:48:25.260 --> 3:48:29.980]  I've only scanned over it where it says government and calls for global governance.
[3:48:29.980 --> 3:48:30.980]  I'm trying to find it.
[3:48:30.980 --> 3:48:35.700]  Some of the key sections, but yeah, it's just, it's like NAFTA was a wheelbarrow, tens of
[3:48:35.700 --> 3:48:40.220]  thousands of more than 14,000 pages long was not for your fair trade.
[3:48:40.220 --> 3:48:46.020]  It was a giant ripoff and tax exemptions for companies that leave the U S and this carbon
[3:48:46.020 --> 3:48:51.700]  thing is where all the big companies are exempt, all the middle size and small and our homes,
[3:48:51.700 --> 3:48:54.180]  the bureaucrats are going to gang rape us financially.
[3:48:54.180 --> 3:48:56.180]  That's all it is.
[3:48:56.180 --> 3:49:00.140]  And what about an AMA?
[3:49:00.140 --> 3:49:01.500]  I don't have the treaty in front of me.
[3:49:01.500 --> 3:49:02.500]  Tell me about it.
[3:49:02.500 --> 3:49:06.260]  Oh, it's, it's a bill that incorporated into it.
[3:49:06.260 --> 3:49:15.820]  It's like a separate bill from, let me go from the, so you're talking about an 1100
[3:49:15.820 --> 3:49:20.060]  page document.
[3:49:20.060 --> 3:49:25.980]  It's like a, it's a bill, it's proposal for national asset management agency bill within
[3:49:25.980 --> 3:49:26.980]  it.
[3:49:26.980 --> 3:49:30.660]  And it says like bill, bill incorporated as soon as the treaty is signed.
[3:49:30.660 --> 3:49:31.660]  Yes.
[3:49:31.660 --> 3:49:32.660]  Yes.
[3:49:32.660 --> 3:49:38.500]  They're passing a flotilla of bills in, in, in Congress on carbon tax on banking regulations.
[3:49:38.500 --> 3:49:42.580]  This is global government in this set of treaties.
[3:49:42.580 --> 3:49:48.060]  The nation states are passing sort of saying all week passing laws to get in line to plug
[3:49:48.060 --> 3:49:49.860]  into the global government.
[3:49:49.860 --> 3:49:54.100]  They're going to track everything you buy, sell, do companies, the new banking regulations
[3:49:54.100 --> 3:50:01.060]  you hear Obama calls it bailout to stimulus to that allows banks to, to, to regulate all
[3:50:01.060 --> 3:50:02.140]  private businesses.
[3:50:02.140 --> 3:50:03.860]  It's a total, it's global government, sir.
[3:50:03.860 --> 3:50:04.860]  They admit it.
[3:50:04.860 --> 3:50:05.860]  Yeah.
[3:50:05.860 --> 3:50:07.980]  It's just, they're showing it now.
[3:50:07.980 --> 3:50:10.180]  That's exactly what this bill says they want to do.
[3:50:10.180 --> 3:50:13.420]  Well, listen, I, I can't read the whole thing and do everything I'm doing.
[3:50:13.420 --> 3:50:14.420]  We've had guests on about it.
[3:50:14.420 --> 3:50:15.860]  I've scanned over it.
[3:50:15.860 --> 3:50:17.540]  Every page is a nightmare.
[3:50:17.540 --> 3:50:22.180]  Folks do your own analysis, break it down, write articles for it, send it to writers
[3:50:22.180 --> 3:50:27.340]  and info wars.com or Kurt and info wars.com or Aaron and info wars.com.
[3:50:27.340 --> 3:50:29.780]  We're posting more and more reader information.
[3:50:29.780 --> 3:50:32.260]  I know you have a lot of smart people out there.
[3:50:32.260 --> 3:50:34.700]  I can't keep, that's what I'm saying folks.
[3:50:34.700 --> 3:50:40.780]  They're hitting us from every side, the total world government with no freedom, no liberty
[3:50:40.780 --> 3:50:45.140]  is being set up right now, Luke.
[3:50:45.140 --> 3:50:46.140]  What?
[3:50:46.140 --> 3:50:51.820]  That's, that's exactly, that's, I'm just scared because they just, they're just showing us
[3:50:51.820 --> 3:50:52.820]  now what they want to do.
[3:50:52.820 --> 3:50:57.700]  I know that sir, you can Google new world order, thousands of mainstream news articles
[3:50:57.700 --> 3:51:02.140]  admitting exactly what it is.
[3:51:02.140 --> 3:51:06.740]  Say no to government vaccinations, say no to toxic overload, say no to chemicals, say
[3:51:06.740 --> 3:51:08.700]  yes to liquid zeolite.
[3:51:08.700 --> 3:51:12.660]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory
[3:51:12.660 --> 3:51:17.740]  loss, influenza or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[3:51:17.740 --> 3:51:21.540]  Chemical free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger
[3:51:21.540 --> 3:51:22.860]  to fight off viruses.
[3:51:22.860 --> 3:51:24.860]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[3:51:24.860 --> 3:51:29.500]  Liquid zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting
[3:51:29.500 --> 3:51:32.340]  energy levels and promoting a strong immune system.
[3:51:32.340 --> 3:51:36.100]  Liquid zeolite is tasteless, odorless and so gentle you won't even know you're taking
[3:51:36.100 --> 3:51:37.100]  it.
[3:51:37.100 --> 3:51:39.260]  Feel great again and it's little as three days to three weeks.
[3:51:39.260 --> 3:51:44.140]  Liquid zeolite comes with a money back guarantee but it's only available at restoreyourhealthnow.com.
[3:51:44.140 --> 3:51:48.060]  Learn how to get free bottles of liquid zeolite at restoreyourhealthnow.com.

[3:51:59.740 --> 3:52:03.420]  Try liquid zeolite today.
[3:52:03.420 --> 3:52:07.140]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:52:07.140 --> 3:52:10.300]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:52:10.300 --> 3:52:14.620]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:52:14.620 --> 3:52:15.620]  at home.
[3:52:15.620 --> 3:52:20.780]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[3:52:20.780 --> 3:52:21.780]  shots.
[3:52:21.780 --> 3:52:26.580]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:26.580 --> 3:52:32.100]  The fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[3:52:32.100 --> 3:52:36.820]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:52:36.820 --> 3:52:39.220]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:52:39.220 --> 3:52:43.340]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:52:43.340 --> 3:52:49.220]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[3:52:49.220 --> 3:52:50.220]  of the republic.
[3:52:50.220 --> 3:52:57.100]  Get your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now

[3:53:57.220 --> 3:53:58.220]  You're going to love them.
[3:53:58.220 --> 3:54:00.300]  You will never use anything else again.
[3:54:00.300 --> 3:54:18.780]  Folks, be part of history, the enemy is taking over, but it's all fraudulent and openly criminal.
[3:54:18.780 --> 3:54:21.660]  But they said, hey, we're going to put deadly poison called fluoride in your water.
[3:54:21.660 --> 3:54:22.660]  It's good for you.
[3:54:22.660 --> 3:54:23.660]  Shut up and drink it.
[3:54:23.660 --> 3:54:25.620]  Oh, but all the studies say it kills me and gives me cancer.
[3:54:25.620 --> 3:54:26.620]  We don't care.
[3:54:26.620 --> 3:54:27.620]  Shut up.
[3:54:27.620 --> 3:54:28.620]  We have police.
[3:54:28.620 --> 3:54:32.100]  You don't arrest illegals, but you arrest me for the same thing.
[3:54:32.100 --> 3:54:33.100]  Shut up.
[3:54:33.100 --> 3:54:34.100]  That's right, scum.
[3:54:34.100 --> 3:54:35.100]  Pay my paycheck.
[3:54:35.100 --> 3:54:37.580]  Oh, offshore banks are taking over.
[3:54:37.580 --> 3:54:38.580]  That's criminal.
[3:54:38.580 --> 3:54:39.580]  That's right.
[3:54:39.580 --> 3:54:40.580]  Shut up.
[3:54:40.580 --> 3:54:44.540]  We'll stage a terror attack and blame it on you and arrest your ass.
[3:54:44.540 --> 3:54:46.020]  That's how these people roll.
[3:54:46.020 --> 3:54:47.180]  That's how they're operating.
[3:54:47.180 --> 3:54:50.460]  That's what they're doing.
[3:54:50.460 --> 3:54:53.700]  And we've got to get mad with the truth and get it out to people.
[3:54:53.700 --> 3:54:56.620]  We have to get angry and then take the truth and get it out there.
[3:54:56.620 --> 3:54:58.740]  And that's what fall the republic does.
[3:54:58.740 --> 3:55:03.900]  I busted my high tail on this.
[3:55:03.900 --> 3:55:05.500]  This sucker is good.
[3:55:05.500 --> 3:55:07.020]  This baby will wake people up.
[3:55:07.020 --> 3:55:10.940]  This has got the facts and anybody that wants to know the truth can learn it.
[3:55:10.940 --> 3:55:15.580]  They can pack their lies and slit media and this info on people, but that's got to be
[3:55:15.580 --> 3:55:17.380]  reapplied, reapplied.
[3:55:17.380 --> 3:55:19.660]  Somebody finds out the truth one time.
[3:55:19.660 --> 3:55:21.260]  Their life has changed.
[3:55:21.260 --> 3:55:24.180]  That's the secret about the truth.
[3:55:24.180 --> 3:55:26.660]  One grain of truth can smash a mountain of lies.
[3:55:26.660 --> 3:55:28.460]  Get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:55:28.460 --> 3:55:29.460]  Do not wait.
[3:55:29.460 --> 3:55:30.460]  Order it now.
[3:55:30.460 --> 3:55:31.460]  It's the best way to get it out.
[3:55:31.460 --> 3:55:36.460]  People make copies of it or watch it on prisonplanet.tv, download it, burn it to the desk.
[3:55:36.460 --> 3:55:38.740]  It's so easy with the Divx version up there.
[3:55:38.740 --> 3:55:39.740]  Get it out to everybody.
[3:55:39.740 --> 3:55:41.100]  I know people are going wild with it.
[3:55:41.100 --> 3:55:42.100]  I want to commend you.
[3:55:42.100 --> 3:55:43.100]  I want to thank you.
[3:55:43.100 --> 3:55:44.940]  Gabby in Florida, you're on the air.
[3:55:44.940 --> 3:55:46.540]  And then we'll talk to Captain Truth at least.
[3:55:46.540 --> 3:55:47.540]  Go ahead, Gabby.
[3:55:47.540 --> 3:55:48.540]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[3:55:48.540 --> 3:55:49.540]  How are you?
[3:55:49.540 --> 3:55:50.540]  Good.
[3:55:50.540 --> 3:55:54.260]  I have two quick questions for you.
[3:55:54.260 --> 3:56:00.980]  I have a newborn baby that's two months, and they asked me to take some shots for her.
[3:56:00.980 --> 3:56:02.220]  What do you think about that?
[3:56:02.220 --> 3:56:07.020]  Well, you make your own medical decision, but they want you to take the hepatitis shot,
[3:56:07.020 --> 3:56:08.020]  correct?
[3:56:08.020 --> 3:56:12.100]  The hepatitis, the polio, and the DTP shot.
[3:56:12.100 --> 3:56:13.100]  Okay.
[3:56:13.100 --> 3:56:17.220]  Japan, it's illegal to give somebody under two shots in Japan because they actually
[3:56:17.220 --> 3:56:19.340]  care a little bit about their people.
[3:56:19.340 --> 3:56:22.180]  Your child isn't going to be injecting heroin or cocaine.
[3:56:22.180 --> 3:56:24.820]  Your child isn't going to be having sex.
[3:56:24.820 --> 3:56:31.060]  The hepatitis is one of the most deadly vaccines on record, and I would just make that decision
[3:56:31.060 --> 3:56:32.060]  for yourself.
[3:56:32.060 --> 3:56:34.660]  They're not trying to make you give it to her, are they?
[3:56:34.660 --> 3:56:35.660]  No, no, no.
[3:56:35.660 --> 3:56:40.940]  They said that if you want to, yeah, but at first the doctor was like, oh, you know, she
[3:56:40.940 --> 3:56:41.940]  has to take them.
[3:56:41.940 --> 3:56:42.940]  She has to take them.
[3:56:42.940 --> 3:56:43.940]  Like it was like...
[3:56:43.940 --> 3:56:44.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:56:44.940 --> 3:56:45.940]  They lie.
[3:56:45.940 --> 3:56:46.940]  Color of law is hardcore criminal, sicko, filth.
[3:56:46.940 --> 3:56:50.980]  Again, even if you think shots are good, they shouldn't lie and say you have to.
[3:56:50.980 --> 3:56:54.300]  Then you showed backbone, and they backed off and said, I got one that can see.
[3:56:54.300 --> 3:56:56.500]  I got a slave that's aware.
[3:56:56.500 --> 3:56:58.820]  Ma'am, you do what you want.
[3:56:58.820 --> 3:57:02.380]  My three children have never had an injection in their life.
[3:57:02.380 --> 3:57:04.380]  Oh, that's great.
[3:57:04.380 --> 3:57:06.940]  I'll have one more question, Alex.
[3:57:06.940 --> 3:57:11.060]  My husband is a deep listener of you, and he's planning on joining the National Guard.
[3:57:11.060 --> 3:57:14.260]  What do you think about that?
[3:57:14.260 --> 3:57:16.620]  Dear God, they're going to shoot him up like a pincushion.
[3:57:16.620 --> 3:57:17.620]  That's...
[3:57:17.620 --> 3:57:18.620]  Whatever.
[3:57:18.620 --> 3:57:19.620]  Free country.
[3:57:19.620 --> 3:57:20.620]  Do what you want.
[3:57:20.620 --> 3:57:21.620]  All right.
[3:57:21.620 --> 3:57:24.340]  Thank you, Alex, and you have a good day.
[3:57:24.340 --> 3:57:25.340]  God bless you.
[3:57:25.340 --> 3:57:26.340]  Oh, man.
[3:57:26.340 --> 3:57:28.340]  Captain Truth in Vegas, Captain.
[3:57:28.340 --> 3:57:30.540]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[3:57:30.540 --> 3:57:34.300]  It's an honor and a privilege to be on your show.
[3:57:34.300 --> 3:57:35.300]  Honor to talk to you.
[3:57:35.300 --> 3:57:36.300]  We got one minute.
[3:57:36.300 --> 3:57:37.300]  Okay.
[3:57:37.300 --> 3:57:41.780]  You and Aaron Russo probably saved my life.
[3:57:41.780 --> 3:57:46.740]  The way I did the DVDs is I asked for...I don't know, and you can tell me if I'm wrong.
[3:57:46.740 --> 3:57:51.540]  I asked for a deposit and offered to refund it if they brought the DVD back to me, but
[3:57:51.540 --> 3:58:00.060]  I just had to have some reproduction money to make more DVDs.
[3:58:00.060 --> 3:58:03.660]  If I'd made anything, and if I ever did, I guess it would have helped.
[3:58:03.660 --> 3:58:04.780]  That's not the issue, sir.
[3:58:04.780 --> 3:58:11.060]  I can't tell people they can sell them or they will take it away from me, copyright it,
[3:58:11.060 --> 3:58:16.420]  just say it's their work and I can't sell it, and we've had people actually try that.
[3:58:16.420 --> 3:58:17.420]  So just whatever.
[3:58:17.420 --> 3:58:18.980]  I just don't...I don't want to hear about what you're doing.
[3:58:18.980 --> 3:58:21.420]  Just get the DVDs out to people.
[3:58:21.420 --> 3:58:24.060]  That's the whole issue.
[3:58:24.060 --> 3:58:29.340]  My God, a Div X is like 25 cents for the CD, and you can put the film on it.
[3:58:29.340 --> 3:58:30.340]  So whatever.
[3:58:30.340 --> 3:58:31.340]  Great job.
[3:58:31.340 --> 3:58:32.340]  Keep it up.
[3:58:32.340 --> 3:58:36.100]  I got people calling me every day saying, can I put it on Access TV?
[3:58:36.100 --> 3:58:43.340]  The film says copy and distribute on the back.
[3:58:43.340 --> 3:58:46.700]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[3:58:46.700 --> 3:58:51.300]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:51.300 --> 3:58:54.620]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[3:58:54.620 --> 3:58:58.220]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[3:58:58.220 --> 3:59:02.900]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[3:59:02.900 --> 3:59:07.380]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[3:59:07.380 --> 3:59:12.540]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity
[3:59:12.540 --> 3:59:13.540]  for free.
[3:59:13.540 --> 3:59:17.180]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[3:59:17.180 --> 3:59:22.060]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[3:59:22.060 --> 3:59:26.420]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[3:59:26.420 --> 3:59:28.540]  through painful power outages again.
[3:59:28.540 --> 3:59:30.980]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[3:59:30.980 --> 3:59:36.900]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and
[3:59:36.900 --> 3:59:38.780]  get off the grid today.
[3:59:38.780 --> 3:59:45.740]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
