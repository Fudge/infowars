[00:00.000 --> 00:12.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.800 --> 00:36.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.280 --> 00:45.320]  welcome my friends welcome it is Friday the 14th day of January 2011 it seems
[00:45.320 --> 00:49.720]  like five minutes ago it was last Friday and we had Bob Chapman on dropping
[00:49.720 --> 00:54.680]  those bombshells on Ronald Reagan and others and talking about the CMP and
[00:54.680 --> 01:00.200]  how the establishment controls the right wing as well as the left wing we have a
[01:00.200 --> 01:05.920]  big video we just posted today actually last night at prison planet dot TV part
[01:05.920 --> 01:11.440]  one of a two-hour in-person interview with Joel Scalzen he was involved right
[01:11.440 --> 01:15.760]  at the beginning of the CMP and other major conservative organizations and
[01:15.760 --> 01:20.760]  breaks down how the Tea Party today is being infiltrated and taken over yet
[01:20.760 --> 01:24.160]  again and goes through all the major conservative players and from his
[01:24.160 --> 01:28.080]  intelligence and research who they exactly work for and that's up on
[01:28.080 --> 01:33.160]  prison planet dot TV right now again it is Friday and we have dr. Joel Wallach
[01:33.160 --> 01:37.120]  who I had on last year and people really wanted to have him come back to the show
[01:37.120 --> 01:46.000]  and he's both a medical doctor and also a veterinarian and he talks about how
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.440]  many illnesses are connected to lack of nutrition predominantly not having
[01:52.440 --> 01:56.160]  enough minerals and of course there are countless studies that show this and I've
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.560]  worked for a large animal vet a small animal vet and and and I remember vets
[02:00.560 --> 02:04.520]  saying you know get more of this mineral get more of that vitamin for your
[02:04.520 --> 02:08.000]  animal and that was always the first course of action when they identified
[02:08.000 --> 02:15.440]  things that weren't like a broken leg or you know a prolapse or a miscarriage and
[02:15.440 --> 02:20.560]  a cow I mean a lot of times it was mineral in nature but big mainline
[02:20.560 --> 02:25.600]  modern medicine doesn't ever want to give you things that are preventative or
[02:25.600 --> 02:31.160]  things that don't cut burn or poison they want to respond to what the lack of
[02:31.160 --> 02:39.800]  minerals and nutrients has caused and treat the crisis that has occurred
[02:39.800 --> 02:47.120]  instead of actually heading it off at the past so I wanted to have dr. Joel
[02:47.120 --> 02:50.560]  Wallach of course dead doctors don't lies name of his syndicated radio
[02:50.560 --> 02:57.760]  program and his millions of fans he'll be joining us coming up in the next hour
[02:57.760 --> 03:01.840]  and of course we have our once a week visit with Bob Chapman as well coming
[03:01.840 --> 03:08.960]  up there'll be open phones during that Bob Chapman interview today okay we've
[03:08.960 --> 03:14.880]  been spending the last five shows Sunday through Thursday spending about 80% of
[03:14.880 --> 03:21.000]  our time on the shooting in Tucson and we've had to do that because it's been
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.760]  used as a establishment move a counterrevolution against the American
[03:28.760 --> 03:32.200]  people are trying to take their country back as a way to demonize the first
[03:32.200 --> 03:38.640]  amendment and to savage the second amendment as well and so though it was
[03:38.640 --> 03:44.160]  pretty much a hyped up blown out of proportion media spectacle bordering on
[03:44.160 --> 03:48.000]  hoax certainly a hoax that he was a conservative or that he was politically
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.160]  motivated we now know that was a hoax that component of it we had to respond
[03:53.160 --> 03:57.600]  to it because it was a major globalist propaganda offensive it's now blown up in
[03:57.600 --> 04:02.280]  their face so the event itself is a diversion and distraction that they've
[04:02.280 --> 04:06.440]  hyped up but by resisting it you educate people about their different
[04:06.440 --> 04:14.640]  propaganda programs and their different dirty tricks and you also then snatch
[04:14.640 --> 04:20.360]  victory out of the jaws of defeat and really route the enemy once again and
[04:20.360 --> 04:23.040]  that has now happened and they are running with their tail behind their
[04:23.040 --> 04:27.840]  legs yet again this is not 10 15 years ago where the feds could bomb Oklahoma
[04:27.840 --> 04:31.360]  City and teach us all to worship black uniforms and lick their boots and
[04:31.360 --> 04:36.720]  cower and fear people more and more aware of how they seize on crises create
[04:36.720 --> 04:42.040]  crises and it hasn't worked that said they don't care they're barreling on
[04:42.040 --> 04:48.400]  down the road with incredible developments FBI targets critics of

[08:18.800 --> 08:27.920]  we're live it is Friday the 14th day of January 2011 Bob Chapman joining us on
[08:27.920 --> 08:34.160]  different developments in the economy and geopolitically as he always does
[08:34.160 --> 08:42.760]  coming up today in the third hour we have Dr. Joe Wallach joining us who was a
[08:42.760 --> 08:48.720]  doctor of veterinary medicine but also of a naturopathic of medicine indeed on
[08:48.720 --> 08:56.720]  MD and he is going to be joining us coming up to get into what's causing so
[08:56.720 --> 09:01.960]  many of the illnesses and diseases in this country is lack of minerals and
[09:01.960 --> 09:08.360]  vitamins and the system knows this but they want to treat the results of the
[09:08.360 --> 09:14.200]  lack of minerals and vitamins and other trace elements and nutrients instead of
[09:14.200 --> 09:17.120]  giving you the things that are preventative and so I want to be talking
[09:17.120 --> 09:22.360]  with him coming up later in the next hour also you noticed last week the
[09:22.360 --> 09:25.800]  federal government had to admit that sodium fluoride is causing dental
[09:25.800 --> 09:29.960]  fluorosis and a lot of other degenerative type diseases and problems
[09:29.960 --> 09:34.720]  and we're seeing an almost near reversal and they're doing that because they
[09:34.720 --> 09:40.320]  know that there is massive resistance building worldwide not to just things
[09:40.320 --> 09:44.200]  like NAFTA and GATT or the World Trade Organization or the private
[09:44.200 --> 09:50.280]  Federal Reserve or the TSA but on fluoride lawsuits are being filed at
[09:50.280 --> 09:54.360]  city and county level as people discover that it's a listed poison and that
[09:54.360 --> 10:01.320]  other poisons are being added under the name fluoride the vast majority over 90
[10:01.320 --> 10:06.560]  percent of toxicologists scientists neurologists are going public writing
[10:06.560 --> 10:11.280]  books shining petitions the major unions of the food and drug
[10:11.280 --> 10:17.200]  administration and the EPA have gone to Congress in the last 11 years multiple
[10:17.200 --> 10:22.240]  times I mean it's it's it's building towards a crescendo and so the
[10:22.240 --> 10:30.280]  establishment is saying okay we'll cut it from 1.2 parts per million and
[10:30.280 --> 10:34.240]  someplace this is as high as four parts per million we'll you know we'll cut it
[10:34.240 --> 10:40.240]  down to maybe three parts or point three parts per million or point five parts
[10:40.240 --> 10:45.040]  per million because they are already moved on to using sodium fluoride as a
[10:45.040 --> 10:50.000]  pesticide on crops and it goes through the cell wall and bio accumulates they've
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.960]  already got the chemical weapons system in literally thousands of processed
[10:54.960 --> 11:00.240]  foods at levels hundreds of times above one part per million I mean I've seen
[11:00.240 --> 11:04.800]  cases of it in powdered eggs of 600 parts per million I mean it's just I
[11:04.800 --> 11:08.520]  always wondered why growing up if I was on a camp out or something and ate
[11:08.520 --> 11:12.440]  powdered eggs I'd throw up I mean I'm somebody who loves eggs my body was like
[11:12.440 --> 11:17.560]  poison you know danger will Robinson and they're also of course in the
[11:17.560 --> 11:21.880]  toothpaste it's hundreds of times above one part per million so they're hitting
[11:21.880 --> 11:25.800]  you and hitting you hard there so they're going okay you want to win a fight
[11:25.800 --> 11:33.840]  okay we'll back off we'll cut it by half or more you win because it's very
[11:33.840 --> 11:38.520]  important they be able to continue adding the lead the mercury the uranium
[11:38.520 --> 11:44.280]  the radium and other radioactive isotopes into your water to sterilize
[11:44.280 --> 11:46.680]  you and of course that's in the government documents and Rockefeller
[11:46.680 --> 11:54.120]  documents we've covered and gone over here and we've had doctor Paul Conant
[11:54.120 --> 11:59.640]  on toxicologist biologist breaking all that down PhD and that videos at
[11:59.640 --> 12:04.600]  presentplanet.tv so so these are real public service announcements that we
[12:04.600 --> 12:10.560]  can do and actually help people now for the next 20 minutes or so I'm going to
[12:10.560 --> 12:17.680]  get into a smattering of important news and then coming up at the bottom of the
[12:17.680 --> 12:23.200]  hour I'm going to get into this story that I'm about to introduce in more
[12:23.200 --> 12:30.560]  detailed headline witch hunt FBI visiting conservative bloggers after
[12:30.560 --> 12:35.400]  Tucson shootings this is so outrageous I don't have words to describe how serious
[12:35.400 --> 12:40.520]  this is and they are visiting people in multiple states Arkansas you name it
[12:40.520 --> 12:47.920]  who said nothing threatening and ask polite questions at public events about
[12:47.920 --> 12:52.960]  budgets and about campaign donations and remember I played the clip yesterday
[12:52.960 --> 12:59.000]  of elected Democrats in Missouri and other states saying if you say things
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.480]  that we say aren't true about Obama that he's not a Christian or that he's a
[13:03.480 --> 13:09.960]  Muslim we will arrest you so don't think they won't do it just like you didn't
[13:09.960 --> 13:14.640]  believe they confiscate guns in Katrina from even the high and dry wealthy
[13:14.640 --> 13:18.760]  areas where they had generators and food their first target wasn't bring food
[13:18.760 --> 13:22.080]  water to the people at the Astro Dome that they blocked from leaving the city
[13:22.080 --> 13:26.040]  they wouldn't let them go out over the highways they shot them and they tried
[13:26.040 --> 13:29.520]  to leave the cops had followed orders by the feds by the way we're hung out to
[13:29.520 --> 13:33.480]  dry and put in prison for that so that's a good lesson for you I know they sent
[13:33.480 --> 13:37.280]  the military out under FBI command with police from all over the country in a
[13:37.280 --> 13:43.400]  giant orgy of via of tyranny violating the Bill of Rights and they took the
[13:43.400 --> 13:48.920]  guns all the guns will be taken no one will be allowed to be armed and then we
[13:48.920 --> 13:58.640]  saw the videos of police dragging out the burglar bars on on banks and on pawn
[13:58.640 --> 14:03.880]  shops stealing the jewelry police robbing in mass actually kicking looters out of
[14:03.880 --> 14:07.840]  Walmart that still had electrical power still had everything the surveillance
[14:07.840 --> 14:12.160]  cameras were rolling and then the cops just start loading sony playstations up
[14:12.160 --> 14:17.160]  it was a celebration of evil that's what you have to look forward to when
[14:17.160 --> 14:20.800]  there's a blizzard in New York the government people party and sit on their
[14:20.800 --> 14:27.320]  butts as little babies die on freezing mall floors for nine hours when there's
[14:27.320 --> 14:30.080]  a Katrina they're coming for your guns and they keep them and sell them for
[14:30.080 --> 14:35.240]  themselves and they go in Walmart and they robbed the banks every time there's
[14:35.240 --> 14:42.080]  a crisis in history armies and police loot and steal oh sure 60 70 80% of the
[14:42.080 --> 14:47.440]  cops just go I'm not gonna be part of this and go home but the lawless 30%
[14:47.440 --> 14:53.440]  rob and rape and kill and we now know robbing raping killing the real looters
[14:53.440 --> 15:00.480]  were the police and military in Katrina on record I had witnesses on who were
[15:00.480 --> 15:03.760]  there when the cops were shooting people on the bridge and listeners couldn't
[15:03.760 --> 15:07.120]  believe it and later they were convicted of it I had listeners on who were
[15:07.120 --> 15:10.800]  part of the relief effort that said the military demanded to see women's breast
[15:10.800 --> 15:14.200]  and privates for water and that they wanted to be taken out they had to go
[15:14.200 --> 15:19.880]  behind the building and have sex with them now our military's got a lot of good
[15:19.880 --> 15:23.800]  people but it's also got a lot of gangbangers and foreigners and you name
[15:23.800 --> 15:27.480]  it filling it up and let me tell you they're having a good time and if you
[15:27.480 --> 15:32.000]  think the government can and will protect you you're insane it's a rotten
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.320]  fish and they rot from the head up run by foreign offshore criminal banks
[15:36.320 --> 15:40.280]  rotting right down towards the tail and look I'm not just picking on police
[15:40.280 --> 15:46.160]  every major societal study shows the general public within 10 days will rob
[15:46.160 --> 15:53.000]  and kill for food within 15 days almost everyone it's close to 100% will eat
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.440]  man flesh they will roast a baby on a spit they will take your wife and gut
[15:59.440 --> 16:05.200]  her and eat her they will take you and they will gut you the general public
[16:05.200 --> 16:11.160]  out there these these wanting pathetic fake moralizing liberals and mainline
[16:11.160 --> 16:15.920]  conservatives and people that are these domesticated self-propelled stomachs
[16:15.920 --> 16:21.240]  will eat you within 15 days if they're not given food by the government as we
[16:21.240 --> 16:25.200]  go into this depression and the globalist plan they never let it get to
[16:25.200 --> 16:29.160]  that they're gonna let things fall apart and then use the giant screaming mob as
[16:29.160 --> 16:33.440]  they're battering round to destroy the middle class and complete the United
[16:33.440 --> 16:38.520]  States journey into complete despotism just like Argentina just like
[16:38.520 --> 16:42.720]  Nigeria just like Romania just like countless other countries it's all
[16:42.720 --> 16:47.320]  being lovingly prepared and we have the IMF World Bank documents where they
[16:47.320 --> 16:52.240]  planned it in the third world they call it the IMF riot they engineer it with
[16:52.240 --> 16:58.400]  precision and then you will beg for the SWAT teams and the military because
[16:58.400 --> 17:02.520]  even though they might rape your wife at least they'll machine gun the horde
[17:02.520 --> 17:08.960]  running towards you to to to literally rob you and beat you to death remember
[17:08.960 --> 17:13.080]  the media saying how dare the Korean shopkeepers hold off the mobs that wanted
[17:13.080 --> 17:17.520]  to burn down their businesses they were the bad guys in Los Angeles you will be
[17:17.520 --> 17:21.960]  the bad guy if you try to defend your business or your home you will be the
[17:21.960 --> 17:27.120]  one that's evil if you shoot looters you will be the one that's evil if things
[17:27.120 --> 17:31.000]  break down with no food and water for 15 days and people start trying to roast
[17:31.000 --> 17:36.880]  you oh and under Mao's great reorganization even mainline Chinese
[17:36.880 --> 17:41.160]  books government approved I've even got the nightline on this from like 15 years
[17:41.160 --> 17:46.480]  ago on tape somewhere around here that they had giant pots stewing people up

[28:50.480 --> 28:54.000]  follow me around and I'd look down to see what movies were there and he'd come
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.360]  and stand by me and I started to get a little irritated and I was looking at
[28:57.360 --> 29:00.560]  him and he wouldn't make eye contact but then I just said I'm not gonna get mad
[29:00.560 --> 29:03.800]  I'm gonna get out of here but then I saw him kind of follow me and then they
[29:03.800 --> 29:08.160]  kind of said something and I went up with like five videos and I bought him

[33:27.200 --> 33:32.120]  visiting conservative bloggers homes and businesses and asking them if they're
[33:32.120 --> 33:37.040]  planning to attack members of Congress and others if they simply ask
[33:37.040 --> 33:44.120]  questions politely and the message is you sit down you shut up you don't do
[33:44.120 --> 33:48.640]  that or we're basically going to come out and say that you're a terrorist now
[33:48.640 --> 33:54.640]  on top of this you know at the 9,000 locations malls shopping centers grocery
[33:54.640 --> 34:01.680]  stores 845 plus Walmart's that they're putting in in some cases dozens and
[34:01.680 --> 34:05.840]  dozens of telescreens at every checkout counter they have a telescreen telling
[34:05.840 --> 34:10.400]  you to basically spy on other people that are shopping watch your neighbors
[34:10.400 --> 34:14.440]  and of course we knew that there would be new announcements and they have like
[34:14.440 --> 34:20.120]  an AP news scroll on the bottom to make it newsy they now have a new report
[34:20.120 --> 34:24.920]  saying the internet is under threat watch the websites you visit don't worry

[36:06.840 --> 36:12.080]  that if you order room service but don't want them inside your room I mean I
[36:12.080 --> 36:17.680]  just a few weeks ago I was with my wife and children in a hotel and they were
[36:17.680 --> 36:20.640]  all in their pajamas and we ordered some food at about nine at night we were
[36:20.640 --> 36:26.560]  gonna you know watch TV something we rarely do a treat for the kids and we
[36:26.560 --> 36:29.080]  already already ordered room service at about seven we were gonna let them have
[36:29.080 --> 36:33.480]  some desserts because we're on vacation that's right so some ice cream and milk
[36:33.480 --> 36:37.680]  and stuff was coming up and I was wearing a shirt and shorts but my wife was in
[36:37.680 --> 36:41.760]  her nightgown and she said don't let them in and so I went over and went
[36:41.760 --> 36:45.520]  outside and signed it it says go ahead and call Homeland Security if you do
[36:45.520 --> 36:49.880]  that so again I'm a terrorist as well all of this is a net so wide that see

[38:12.280 --> 38:15.800]  Security this is being given to schoolchildren in Oklahoma if you hear
[38:15.800 --> 38:20.040]  controversial issues being debated and they're telling us now what controversial
[38:20.040 --> 38:25.280]  issues are are you talking about the monetary system little people aren't
[38:25.280 --> 38:28.960]  supposed to be talking about those high and mighty things you just let the
[38:28.960 --> 38:32.680]  bankers run things they'll take care of it like they've done all over the world
[38:32.680 --> 38:40.560]  they're nice men in suits like mr. Maid often can lay the mr. Brunack he's
[38:40.560 --> 38:44.160]  gonna take now never mind that Congress asked where the trillions went and they
[38:44.160 --> 38:49.160]  won't say that nothing to see here move along you don't want an FBI visit do
[38:49.160 --> 38:54.600]  you you don't want to be on a no fly or no work or no gun by list no judge or
[38:54.600 --> 38:59.320]  jury you better sit down and shut up and everything will be okay because
[38:59.320 --> 39:06.160]  together we thrive meaning sit down and shut up and do what the television in
[39:06.160 --> 39:11.640]  Barack Obama tells you the message is you criticize government and corruption
[39:11.640 --> 39:16.520]  you're gonna get an FBI visit you sit down and shut up you're gonna thrive all
[39:16.520 --> 39:19.080]  these Obama supporters for two years thought that we're gonna get free houses
[39:19.080 --> 39:22.680]  free cars oh thank you mr. President I don't have a job anymore I'm gonna get
[39:22.680 --> 39:27.760]  free health care did you get that turns out it allows the government to cut the
[39:27.760 --> 39:32.760]  quality of care for everybody and to set up death panels and not give old
[39:32.760 --> 39:36.320]  people treatment and to force 30 plus million people to buy overpriced
[39:36.320 --> 39:40.280]  insurance because the insurance companies wrote it do you suckers that are
[39:40.280 --> 39:43.680]  born every minute like what happened I'm talking to those mainline idiot
[39:43.680 --> 39:47.200]  liberals that think we're gonna be safer like you are in Chicago in New York if
[39:47.200 --> 39:52.880]  we disarm the public then you could have a total crime-ridden system run by
[39:52.880 --> 39:56.120]  crooks on top and government with their little buddies the crooks on bottom
[39:56.120 --> 40:03.280]  feeding on everybody you like that so this is all so over the top now and we've
[40:03.280 --> 40:08.600]  got a big video that I shot last night that Rob do stayed up all night to get
[40:08.600 --> 40:12.520]  up it's on the info warrior channel it's the top video at the Alex Jones video
[40:12.520 --> 40:17.840]  channel we're getting it posted right now info wars calm and prison planet
[40:17.840 --> 40:26.160]  calm and it's got the headline up there on info wars calm similar to the
[40:26.160 --> 40:31.400]  article which hunt FBI visiting conservative bloggers after Tucson
[40:31.400 --> 40:36.600]  shootings we have a video of the same title that's 18 minutes long that is
[40:36.600 --> 40:40.760]  extremely powerful that everybody needs to see remember a lot of the public
[40:40.760 --> 40:45.120]  doesn't read now so those of you that are reading that you know our higher IQ
[40:45.120 --> 40:49.680]  audience on average you need to send the video on to those that are basically
[40:49.680 --> 40:53.000]  the fifth grade level of the general public and maybe we can get them out of
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.480]  their trance in fact we're all we are having some success resuscitating the
[40:57.480 --> 41:02.760]  fires of liberty in many people's minds and then again Jason Douglas has two
[41:02.760 --> 41:06.560]  other articles that went up last night Oklahoma Homeland Security says
[41:06.560 --> 41:10.600]  controversial debate suspicious behavior and they're telling us what's
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.640]  controversial you don't talk about government corruption you don't talk
[41:14.640 --> 41:18.800]  about the Federal Reserve you don't talk about monetary issues you don't talk
[41:18.800 --> 41:25.600]  about crooks in government you sit down and you shut up and if we sit down and
[41:25.600 --> 41:29.160]  shut up see see they know the general public's being conditioned just to
[41:29.160 --> 41:32.120]  accept tyranny but they but this is also a message to those of people that are
[41:32.120 --> 41:35.760]  awake and about to get involved it's like you don't want men in black
[41:35.760 --> 41:40.600]  uniforms to come so that's why so many people that watch my show listen to my
[41:40.600 --> 41:44.880]  radio show watch it streaming at prison planet TV they can't believe I'm real
[41:44.880 --> 41:48.400]  even though all the fruits of what we've done they can't believe someone's bold
[41:48.400 --> 41:53.520]  someone has courage someone is announcing a contest against the
[41:53.520 --> 41:57.880]  government contest where they're saying make contest about not trusting other
[41:57.880 --> 42:02.800]  citizens not trusting the internet I'm gonna have a contest exposing the TSA
[42:02.800 --> 42:06.760]  rollout of the telescreens brainwashing people I mean I'm there
[42:06.760 --> 42:12.160]  engaging them I'm on the field as an example confronting these people at
[42:12.160 --> 42:16.600]  point-blank range in the info war okay I've been physically attacked I'm
[42:16.600 --> 42:22.280]  demonized the George Soros publications say I will be responsible for the next
[42:22.280 --> 42:26.920]  Oklahoma City it we have been sent the secret army documents where the army is
[42:26.920 --> 42:32.680]  surveilling yours truly I am surveilled by the US Army okay because we're hard
[42:32.680 --> 42:37.320]  core ladies and gentlemen we are real defenders of the Republic we are picking
[42:37.320 --> 42:42.240]  up the mantle of those that fought in 1776 against tyranny we are the real
[42:42.240 --> 42:46.560]  Americans we are the red blooded Americans we are the red white and blue
[42:46.560 --> 42:50.400]  regardless of what color or religion if you love liberty you're a red blooded
[42:50.400 --> 42:55.840]  American and so we're the enemies of these foreign banking usurpers that are
[42:55.840 --> 43:02.360]  butchering our country I mean what more does it take 1984 telescreens saying
[43:02.360 --> 43:06.680]  don't trust your neighbors 1984 messages and they're gonna get more and more
[43:06.680 --> 43:11.440]  crazy they're gonna be airing in the in the 9,000 locations citizen made
[43:11.440 --> 43:16.840]  propaganda and corporate made propaganda about how dangerous the internet is this
[43:16.840 --> 43:21.720]  is their propaganda push to force their way in to take over the web they've
[43:21.720 --> 43:26.360]  announced it PC World yesterday we told you a year ago but it's PC World
[43:26.360 --> 43:30.920]  yesterday internet ID program to be implemented it's been announced all the
[43:30.920 --> 43:34.280]  new Microsoft operating systems already have it built in to them you'll have to
[43:34.280 --> 43:41.560]  thumbprint to get online they're moving at warp speed it's real now here's an
[43:41.560 --> 43:47.120]  even better development if we give into the intimidation they win it means
[43:47.120 --> 43:50.520]  total enslavement if we don't buck up and say you know what I'm not
[43:50.520 --> 43:54.200]  intimidated by you just like when a bully starts a fight with you this is a
[43:54.200 --> 43:59.000]  political bully we're not calling for violence we're calling to stand up to
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.200]  these violent people in this violent state with its violent propaganda and
[44:03.200 --> 44:06.880]  it's IRS that comes with guns if you don't pay all the money they claim you're
[44:06.880 --> 44:11.840]  owed and the property taxes they will come with a gun they will kill you if
[44:11.840 --> 44:15.920]  you resist when they try to take your house they are the violent ones they're
[44:15.920 --> 44:18.600]  trying to make you think you're the violent ones you're the bad ones they're
[44:18.600 --> 44:25.400]  teaching you that political discussion is evil they're bringing in classical
[44:25.400 --> 44:28.840]  tyranny and they're counting on us not standing up and saying no to them
[44:28.840 --> 44:37.720]  right now now I want to get into this they are making the case and I'm gonna
[44:37.720 --> 44:42.880]  make the case 110% I will absolutely prove without a shadow of a doubt that
[44:42.880 --> 44:48.920]  Rachel Maddow America's favorite Boy Scout I am going to absolutely make the
[44:48.920 --> 44:55.520]  110% case that they are the un-American enemies of the republic they are the
[44:55.520 --> 45:02.120]  the the the children of the authoritarian past and we are the children of the
[45:02.120 --> 45:05.880]  renaissance of liberty of the enlightenment of the awakening of the
[45:05.880 --> 45:12.040]  flower of freedom 1776 we are the children of liberty they are the
[45:12.040 --> 45:17.480]  children of tyranny okay it's that simple and I will prove it now incontrovertible
[45:17.480 --> 45:22.000]  let's go ahead and play a clip of Rachel Maddow demonizing congressman Brown has
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.880]  been on congressman Paul and myself implying that we are calling for violence
[45:26.880 --> 45:30.800]  and that we are going to carry out violence and then she says that you
[45:30.800 --> 45:35.440]  know it's it's un-American I have the Declaration of Independence right here
[45:35.440 --> 45:40.560]  this is America more than the Bill of Rights more than the Constitution this
[45:40.560 --> 45:45.600]  is it this was when some of the most powerful men that had a lot to lose put
[45:45.600 --> 45:48.840]  their names their lives their treasure a lot of them got killed a lot of their
[45:48.840 --> 45:52.360]  families and children got killed when they put their name on this when they
[45:52.360 --> 45:58.680]  signed their John Hancock this is America if you don't stand for this if
[45:58.680 --> 46:04.440]  you don't kiss the ring of this you're not an American this is it nothing is
[46:04.440 --> 46:09.420]  more Americana it ain't apple pie and baseball folks it isn't Chevy cars okay
[46:09.420 --> 46:16.160]  that's the fruit of liberty this is the root this is the root the liberty and the
[46:16.160 --> 46:21.760]  wealth is the fruit this is the root this is putting it on the table this is
[46:21.760 --> 46:25.600]  saying you're tyrants and I'm calling you out when they were sending train
[46:25.600 --> 46:33.080]  murderers to kill these men burning down their farms this is the root of liberty
[46:33.080 --> 46:40.040]  and what does it say here but when a long train of abuses and usurpations
[46:40.040 --> 46:45.560]  pursuing and reverably the same object invents as a design to reduce them under
[46:45.560 --> 46:50.080]  absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such a
[46:50.080 --> 46:54.440]  government and to provide new guards for their future security it is not our
[46:54.440 --> 47:00.360]  right it is our duty to throw off this tyrannical government but we are the
[47:00.360 --> 47:05.000]  government we created this government and so we have a right to get in the face
[47:05.000 --> 47:08.800]  of these crooks and to get angry and to get focused and to rile people up that's
[47:08.800 --> 47:12.560]  how you get things done when the face of tyranny to take our republic back
[47:12.560 --> 47:16.320]  through the states through the Congress but they're not gonna let that happen
[47:16.320 --> 47:19.880]  they're gonna blow up new Oklahoma cities and blaming on us there they got
[47:19.880 --> 47:23.560]  the talking points out saying they're gonna do it even Lynn Beck has to admit
[47:23.560 --> 47:28.280]  that there isn't going to work we've got to have courage in the face of these
[47:28.280 --> 47:33.480]  criminals or there is no future now let's go ahead now here she is demonizing
[47:33.480 --> 47:39.800]  Ron Paul Congressman Brown myself right Rachel Maddow I think she's one of the
[47:39.800 --> 47:45.640]  you know most well-spoken men on MSNBC let's go ahead and play this clip of
[47:45.640 --> 47:53.120]  Rachel a mr. Maddow last night going after Ron Paul you name it here it is
[47:53.120 --> 47:58.480]  fellow patrons we have a lot of domestic enemies of the Constitution and
[47:58.480 --> 48:04.120]  they're right down the mall in the Congress the United States Paul Brown
[48:04.120 --> 48:09.760]  representative and write down Independence Avenue in the White House the unit
[48:09.760 --> 48:16.240]  they can't stand us we're calling them out my ability to hide which I love to do
[48:16.240 --> 48:22.360]  it's not about the ability for me to protect my family my property against
[48:22.360 --> 48:29.680]  criminals which we have the right to do but it's about it's all about us
[48:29.680 --> 48:34.640]  protecting ourselves from a tyrannical government of the United States that's
[48:34.640 --> 48:39.000]  America right there that's an American not about hunting or self-defense it's
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.200]  about citizens having the ability to overthrow the tyrannical government of
[48:43.200 --> 48:47.200]  the United States as Congressman Paul Brown of Georgia speaking last April EJ
[48:47.200 --> 48:50.640]  Dionne wrote about this at the Washington Post today he found Republican
[48:50.640 --> 48:54.840]  Congressman Ron Paul making a roughly the same argument in print five years
[48:54.840 --> 48:58.960]  ago quoting mr. Paul quote the second amendment is not about hunting deer or
[48:58.960 --> 49:02.560]  keeping a pistol in your nightstand it's not about protecting oneself against
[49:02.560 --> 49:06.480]  common criminals it's about preventing tyranny the founders knew that unarmed
[49:06.480 --> 49:09.520]  citizens would never be able to overthrow a tyrannical government as they
[49:09.520 --> 49:14.000]  did the muskets they used against the British army were the assault rifles of
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.400]  that time again the argument here is that the second amendment exists so
[49:17.400 --> 49:21.960]  Americans can overthrow the government that is a view it is it is a radical
[49:21.960 --> 49:27.000]  view and policy back it up a little bit though it's not a view it's the
[49:27.000 --> 49:34.040]  declaration of independence mr. Matau okay I'm sorry that a lot of men in this
[49:34.040 --> 49:37.400]  country still wear pants and aren't gonna be the slaves of Goldman Sachs and
[49:37.400 --> 49:42.320]  JP Morgan I'm sorry that some of us have read 1984 and no telescreens going in at
[49:42.320 --> 49:46.920]  locations everywhere telling us to spy on our neighbors in freedom you like to
[49:46.920 --> 49:51.320]  pose as a liberal the real liberals were the founding fathers classical liberals
[49:51.320 --> 49:56.640]  liberal means freedom the opposite of what you deliver and you don't like it
[49:56.640 --> 50:00.760]  now she goes after years truly here it is that time again the argument here is
[50:00.760 --> 50:03.720]  that the second amendment exists so Americans can overthrow the government
[50:03.720 --> 50:10.200]  that is a view it is it is a radical view of gun policy no it's not I reckon
[50:10.200 --> 50:14.040]  stress why are you buying guns they're buying it for civil unrest and to fight
[50:14.040 --> 50:18.040]  back against government tyranny it's conservative talk radio host Alex Jones
[50:18.040 --> 50:23.120]  yeah we essentially have have two choice that's enough from mr. Matau country we
[50:23.120 --> 50:29.120]  are I'm done with these people okay I'm done I'm done with their violence their
[50:29.120 --> 50:32.720]  wars killing millions of people and I want to tell conservative something if

[55:10.720 --> 55:16.360]  I've seen national polls of 98% of cops being pro-second amendment but the
[55:16.360 --> 55:20.120]  problem is under peer pressure they went ahead and confiscated the guns they
[55:20.120 --> 55:26.520]  had cops from all over the country in New Orleans we're at a crossroads here and
[55:26.520 --> 55:29.920]  they've got the FBI going out to conservative bloggers houses going
[55:29.920 --> 55:36.000]  along with the hoax the conservatives the influence this guy on hallucinogens

[1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:22.280]  you're not supposed to be here don't fix that road and of course it's the
[1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:25.560]  Mexican military and if you're an American riding around the lake you're
[1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:28.480]  gonna get your head blown off and the controlled media will say it doesn't
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:32.960]  exist and make fun of you you know when there's a tragedy that they don't like
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:36.360]  oh he didn't get shot in the head the woman didn't see that then they said
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:39.720]  Mexican police to find the body and they cut their heads off then they have
[1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:44.120]  articles about nobody's getting their heads cut off we've got that going on
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:50.720]  of course the big news is not news here we told you three months ago with
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:59.960]  Lindsay Williams it was back in was back in October October November December
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:03.480]  yeah three months ago was the middle of October you can pull up those interviews
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:06.440]  at present planet dot TV or they're all over the web they're in the audio
[1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:10.200]  archives on infowars.com just down the right hand side of the page back in
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:14.040]  October Lindsay Williams talked to his former oil company executive former
[1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:17.800]  head of Atlantic Richfield who's now died we've now given you the name of Mr.
[1:02:17.800 --> 1:02:21.360]  Rex the other guy was the CEO of an even bigger oil company still got that
[1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:26.600]  source and they both told him they said that it's gonna go to 150 to 200 by the
[1:02:26.600 --> 1:02:33.280]  end of 2011 and back then it was $60 a barrel and everybody laughed at Lindsay
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:39.560]  Williams didn't matter that he said when oil was $60 a barrel back in 2008 that
[1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:44.440]  within a year it'd be 150 and it was silly it's laughed at well now it's
[1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:51.360]  upwards of $100 a barrel from $60 a barrel and that'll translate when it
[1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:57.360]  goes to 150 to we're talking about $5 at the pump on average right now it's gonna
[1:02:57.360 --> 1:03:02.840]  go above three nationwide and if it goes up to I mean it goes up to 200 it
[1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:06.960]  might be six seven dollars a gallon but it goes to 150 you're talking five bucks
[1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:10.360]  a gallon and again those are rough guesstimus but we saw what happened a
[1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:13.840]  few years ago and so they know how to put the pressure on us then relieve it
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:17.840]  put the pressure on us relieve it and and of course nowhere in the media are
[1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:23.800]  they discussing why this is really happening the main driver is the fact
[1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:29.320]  that we have dollar devaluation and oil is purchased worldwide still in dollars
[1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:36.880]  though in the last month the Chinese and the Russians both big well Russia's a
[1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:40.600]  big oil exporter China's a big oil importer they both announced they're
[1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:45.960]  gonna deal in oil and natural gas and other petroleum products in the Chinese
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:50.160]  currency and now it's beginning to trade on the international market so these
[1:03:50.160 --> 1:04:01.640]  so the slide the exodus the race away from the good old dollar is accelerating
[1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:07.960]  and so you're gonna see gold silver oil food what was in Reuters yesterday food
[1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:14.240]  prices double food prices explode who told you food prices three years ago was
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:18.360]  gonna go up we did who told you back when silver was five dollars an ounce it
[1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:23.600]  was gonna go up to above 20 now it's up at 30 we did who told you that when
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:27.880]  gold was 265 dollars an ounce that was gonna go up well above a thousand we
[1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:32.800]  did who told you that they would put in telescreens in public telling you to
[1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:37.280]  watch your neighbors I put that in several of my films going back what eight

[1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:14.520]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[1:06:14.520 --> 1:06:18.120]  of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news

[1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:06.200]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[1:07:06.200 --> 1:07:10.760]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:14.480]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:19.360]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[1:07:19.360 --> 1:07:24.000]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:28.360]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:07:28.360 --> 1:07:33.640]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:37.960]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:41.440]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:46.680]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[1:07:46.680 --> 1:07:52.360]  have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd
[1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:57.560]  at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[1:07:57.560 --> 1:08:11.360]  prisonplanet.tv big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:19.400]  answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live
[1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:33.480]  from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is a fact that oil prices are set by the
[1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:40.880]  big oil companies and the sheets of the Middle East and it is a fact that we have
[1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:47.120]  an inside track to two one a CEO one the director of two major oil companies one
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:51.800]  of them just died via Lindsay Williams we know their names we just can't reveal
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:55.160]  those on air well we've now revealed the guy that died and they told you three
[1:08:55.160 --> 1:09:02.600]  months ago it would be going up from $60 a barrel to 150 to 200 by the end of
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:09.280]  2011 and now here's the headline $100 a barrel oil deal with it that's the
[1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:14.600]  headline out of the Associated Press it's also from the Drudge Report
[1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:24.480]  continuing UK warning oil prices may kill economy and the coalition MSNBC is
[1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:30.440]  also reporting on it OPEC ministers say world can handle $100 a barrel oil other
[1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:35.640]  exporters indicate the cartel may not increase crude oil production well good
[1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:39.360]  thing that we're seeing record exploration here on the ground in the
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:43.680]  United States I know they're drilling all over Texas and hitting natural gas and
[1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:47.520]  oil and they're trying to swap all sorts of federal regulations on them to stop
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:51.040]  it from getting out of the ground our economy is completely dependent on oil
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:58.320]  and gas and our society is designed along those lines and we have absolutely
[1:09:58.320 --> 1:10:09.480]  got to start moving towards energy independence but when you look at the
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:13.000]  internal intelligence we got years ago that's now mainstream news we've only
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:17.400]  got two pipelines out of Alaska they could have 50 out of Alaska they claim
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:20.440]  oh you can't get rid of them it hurts the caribou the caribou sleep under it
[1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:24.840]  and use it for shelter it's like a ship being sunk in a in the Caribbean it
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:31.200]  turns into a natural reef I mean this is what is basically a needed it doesn't
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:35.000]  hurt the environment at all we could have more oil out of Alaska than we get
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.600]  from Saudi Arabia but we can't have it because the government and the and the
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:43.640]  big cartels on record only allow a small amount of the oil out of Alaska to go
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:48.720]  to the US roughly 20% goes to the West Coast the rest goes to China and to
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:58.720]  Japan so it is just incredible to see that unfolding continuing here with the
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:04.640]  news you notice that their reports that as much as half of Australia is now
[1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:10.240]  underwater they're calling it a brown sea or a brown ocean as just tens of
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:13.480]  thousands of square miles are now underwater they had been in a long
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:17.680]  drought and you know times are thick times are thin that could naturally
[1:11:17.680 --> 1:11:23.760]  happen but I noticed reports going back to August 8th of last year out of the
[1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:34.400]  Sydney Morning Herald report rain making comes to Australia and it goes on
[1:11:34.400 --> 1:11:41.560]  a rain making method developed by Thai King in Thailand is set to aid
[1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:46.480]  Queensland in battles with drought after an agreement between the state
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:51.240]  government and the Thai Royal household the technique largely relies on cloud
[1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:55.280]  seeding generally undertaking using chemicals to promote the formation of
[1:11:55.280 --> 1:11:59.600]  water droplets within the cloud formations there are several stages in the
[1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:12.080]  process with sodium chloride used in the final stage to trigger rain and I
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:16.240]  remember back in 1998 they had a big flood in Texas and it killed more than
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:19.400]  30 people in one night in South Texas and there was a little blurb in the
[1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:25.280]  San Antonio Express news just a small blurb about oh the Navy was doing
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:30.480]  weather modification drills in the area with their aircraft but we don't know
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:33.560]  there's any connection to that a four-year request is going to be filed
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:37.800]  and I never saw what the end result of that was but they act like oh the
[1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:41.080]  Chinese have developed this or oh the Germans have developed it oh the Russians
[1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:44.720]  have developed it all the Russians for the parade are going to clear this the
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:49.000]  snowy skies or the Chinese are guaranteeing no rain for the Olympics
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.160]  they have weather control systems with antennas and now in Oman other
[1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:56.680]  countries the Middle East they're creating rain and then you talk about it
[1:12:56.680 --> 1:13:00.360]  in our media says you're a cook our government developed all of this stuff
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:05.760]  they were they were using rockets 150 plus years ago in the 1850s that's 160
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:11.960]  years ago to to seed clouds and cause thunderstorms before the Wright brothers
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:21.240]  ever took off at Kitty Hawk okay and I've had been Livingston on this radio
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:29.000]  show the father of weather weapons and he couldn't talk about it until it was
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:34.280]  declassified what in 2004 and when it was declassified the history of weather
[1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:38.680]  weapons at least up to 1970 he was the guy after he was a World War two pilot
[1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:44.640]  fighter pilot what a character he flew into hurricanes but not just
[1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:49.720]  hurricanes he flew into typhoons and a typhoon of course is in the Pacific and
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:54.560]  you get up to 220 230 250 miles an hour where hurricanes reportedly can't even
[1:13:54.560 --> 1:14:00.160]  get up to 200 they don't get spinning as fast here in this area and he was the
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:06.120]  first guy to fly into storms by the 60s they'd certified total control of
[1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:10.000]  weather weapons that they could create hurricanes steer hurricanes kill
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:14.600]  hurricanes and the reason that Ben Livingston came on this show when I saw
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:17.240]  him the local newspaper talking about weather weapons and he had all the
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:20.120]  documents they can now show us and I flew him to Austin to be interviewed
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:24.680]  that interviews being posted on prison planet TV next week exclusive student
[1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:28.720]  never before seen not just the original interview and he was mad because I guess
[1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:35.520]  it was 2005 we just had Katrina and he said in 67 it was certified by the Navy
[1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:39.200]  by the Air Force by Stanford Research Institute that we could create
[1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:44.200]  hurricanes kill hurricanes weaken hurricanes whatever we wanted with just
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:50.440]  eight aircraft and that was with old technology so this needs to be looked
[1:14:50.440 --> 1:14:54.840]  into did the weather modification nobody's talking about this a month into
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:57.960]  the floods in Australia none of the Australian news are talking about it
[1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:02.160]  that they started massive weather modification to end the drought in
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:08.080]  Australia in the area that has seen these incredible floods I think that that
[1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:14.560]  is very very important okay we are now joined for the rest of the hour and a
[1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:17.640]  little bit into the next hour because we had some phone issues on our end and
[1:15:17.640 --> 1:15:21.720]  got him on a little bit late Dr. Joel Wallach has been a guest on before and
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:25.240]  we had so many people requested that you get back on I remember before I was
[1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:29.080]  even really awake to the New World Order fully people were bringing up dead
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:33.640]  doctors don't lie that's a syndicated radio program syndicated by the great
[1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:39.640]  folks out in California MZ and and out of some of our affiliates there in Santa
[1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:45.480]  Cruz but Dr. Wallach lives in the Midwest and he's a veterinarian he's also a
[1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:49.720]  doctor of naturopathic medicine and Indy he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in
[1:15:49.720 --> 1:15:56.600]  1991 and a lot of what he discovered as as a doctor but also as a vet is a lot
[1:15:56.600 --> 1:16:00.840]  of the same things that Linus Pauling the two-time Nobel Prize winner talked
[1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:05.600]  about minerals and vitamin deficiencies but the system knows that and then they
[1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:10.120]  don't want to you know put things out that that that will then end a lot of
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:14.600]  these illnesses in the in the gravy train of of of treating the disease or the
[1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:18.960]  problem caused by the lack of minerals and the lack of vitamins now I work for a
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:23.640]  large animal vet off and on for three years I worked also for a small animal
[1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:28.040]  vet in high school and and I remember routinely the large animal vet would do
[1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:31.400]  a diagnosis on cows horses whatever they'd say this is a vitamin deficiency
[1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:36.880]  give them this and usually it worked and then later there might be some of the
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:41.520]  more you know mainline stuff used so so this is stuff known out there the system
[1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:44.880]  just doesn't want you to be aware of it and so we're really honored to have
[1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:49.360]  Dr. Wallach on with us and I've done research I've looked for people to
[1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:53.160]  partner with and to work with and you're gonna be hearing him on every month now
[1:16:53.160 --> 1:16:58.320]  and I've tried to do research on who really has the information who really

[1:18:17.960 --> 1:18:22.040]  made major contributions to eight major authored text and reference books on
[1:18:22.040 --> 1:18:26.440]  these subjects Dr. Veterinary Medicine Dr. Matriopathic Medicine and we

[1:18:33.320 --> 1:18:37.400]  teaming up with Dr. Wallach Dr. great to have you on with us well thank you so
[1:18:37.400 --> 1:18:41.640]  much Alex I really appreciate your hospitality your comradeship and we're
[1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:46.440]  both on the same train that's for sure absolutely tell us about your awakening
[1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:50.600]  and and how important this is that mineral and vitamin deficiencies is
[1:18:50.600 --> 1:18:55.680]  what's causing so many of the problems and the system knows this but they want
[1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:59.160]  you to be sick to make money off of you. Will you hit the nail right on the head
[1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:04.600]  Alex being a veterinarian we learned a hundred years ago actually a longer than
[1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:08.600]  half to maybe a hundred ten years ago we could prevent and cure as many as nine
[1:19:08.600 --> 1:19:12.760]  hundred different diseases using vitamins and minerals if we were to use the same
[1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:17.240]  health care system for livestock to be for people your hammer would cost you
[1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:20.680]  two hundred eighty five dollars a pound just to pay for the health care we
[1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:24.000]  learned a long time ago that we could keep the price of eggs and meat and
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:28.360]  vegetables and fruit and bread and stuff down to where the average person could
[1:19:28.360 --> 1:19:32.640]  afford to eat it simply by eliminating health care costs. There's a single
[1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:37.640]  insurance company or insurance policy prevents or cures disease but you buy an
[1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:41.360]  insurance policy to pay your premium you're betting you're gonna screw up
[1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:45.080]  somewhere along the line you're gonna have a big doctor or hospital bill and
[1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:49.920]  so you're building up that insurance of funds so that you can pay those bills and
[1:19:49.920 --> 1:19:56.000]  still up to us individually to stay healthy and so I've spent since 1964
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:00.760]  literally educating the public on this because it's really a tragedy that we can
[1:20:00.760 --> 1:20:04.320]  prevent every birth defects in animals nobody's paying attention for humans
[1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:09.320]  every OBGYN should be put in jail because all birth defects are limitable we
[1:20:09.320 --> 1:20:12.200]  don't need to be raising eighty million dollars a year for muscular
[1:20:12.200 --> 1:20:15.640]  dystrophy here he's kids because we already figured out how to prevent and
[1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:22.360]  cure muscular dystrophy back in 1957 and livestock because muscle is meat and
[1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:27.360]  anything that affects the meat industry gets fixed quick we learned that so I've
[1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:33.000]  I've known this since actually 1962 that we were in big trouble with the health
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:37.080]  care system been yelling about it ever since then and I'm so glad to have this
[1:20:37.080 --> 1:20:40.040]  association with you now because you're the guy can get the word out to the
[1:20:40.040 --> 1:20:47.280]  public well dr. Wallach it's just been invaluable what you've discovered let's
[1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:49.720]  go through some of the studies of the peer-reviewed journals that you've
[1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:55.320]  co-authored a lot of people Alex say okay okay Wallach but why were you the
[1:20:55.320 --> 1:20:59.200]  one chosen to do that big national institute the health study the book
[1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:04.160]  covers 20,000 autopsy 10 million chemistry that's in the Smithsonian
[1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:08.720]  Institute is a national treasure why did they pick you a dumb Missouri farm boy
[1:21:08.720 --> 1:21:17.160]  that's because of 1962 as the first guy to actually run into the first pollution
[1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:22.760]  mass dial pollution cars mass dial up the livestock and published it and it was
[1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:27.200]  actually a bunch of the feeder lambs the one guy had lost 500 lambs of one night
[1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:30.960]  because over time it had been chronically poisoned with nitrates and
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:35.560]  nitrites the fertilizer that it got into as well and affected their thyroid
[1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:39.160]  glands when they had a sharp dip in the temperature it got down to 19 degrees
[1:21:39.160 --> 1:21:44.200]  at night he lost every one of his lambs 500 lambs all the surrounding people
[1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:48.120]  all the other surrounding farmers didn't have the same problem I documented
[1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:53.400]  very well with nitrate levels and the well water and the feed and the lambs
[1:21:53.400 --> 1:21:59.720]  tissues got it published and so I was kind of kind of like a whistleblower back
[1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:07.000]  in 1962 as a result of that and I was actually in Africa doing a big conservation
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:11.640]  project in the white rhino I caught over 200 white rhino and sent it back to the
[1:22:11.640 --> 1:22:15.080]  United States so if you ever go to a wild animal park and you see a white rhino
[1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:18.520]  it's either one that I caught or offspring is the one that I caught to save the species
[1:22:18.520 --> 1:22:23.000]  well I was there doing that and Marlon Perkins, the old Mutual Roboho Wild Kingdom
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:27.920]  show, I think you probably familiar with him, he actually got the grant to do this
[1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:32.480]  autopsy study in zoo animals looking for a species of zoo animal that would
[1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:36.520]  essentially be the canary in the back, ultra sensitive to pollution that would
[1:22:36.520 --> 1:22:46.520]  warrant some of the pending pollution due and I did over 17,500 autopsy at over 454 species of zoo animals
[1:22:46.520 --> 1:22:50.040]  from 3,000 human beings, 10 million chemistries and all in this book
[1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:54.440]  that's in the Smithsonian Institute is a national treasure and that's the basic reason
[1:22:54.440 --> 1:23:00.840]  I was nominated for the Nobel Prize for that work and that's obviously the guy that did that study
[1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:05.800]  and I was a dismal failure of getting medical doctors interested in preventing and
[1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:10.000]  curing diseases in humans like we had an animal to get simple nutritional
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:13.840]  partners so I went back to school became an atriopathic position because they
[1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:17.840]  embraced nutrition and lifestyle change as opposed to medical doctors that just say
[1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:20.680]  oh eat fast, who you're going to get, who you're going to get, right?
[1:23:20.680 --> 1:23:27.640]  And so I went back to school became an atriopathic position since 1978, 34 years now
[1:23:27.640 --> 1:23:33.360]  I've been on the road giving 300 free lectures the most popular which was
[1:23:33.360 --> 1:23:41.920]  that doctors don't lie next came a deadly recipe and these lectures are my way of
[1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:45.000]  trying to communicate the warning to the general public that they have to take
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:49.680]  responsibility and recently and I graduated brought up a lot of the terrible
[1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:54.640]  things that were brought to light in November of last year just a couple of
[1:23:54.640 --> 1:24:00.200]  months ago actually one word they said that and this is the Department of Health
[1:24:00.200 --> 1:24:05.480]  and Human Services and the Census Bureau got together they found out that
[1:24:05.480 --> 1:24:14.480]  medical doctors kill 11,000 11,000 11,000 people who are there on
[1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:23.200]  Medicare, Medicare patients 11,000 no 15,000 per month American
[1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:26.320]  Medicare patients are killed in the hospital by medical doctors each month
[1:24:26.320 --> 1:24:31.560]  for 180,000 per year that's just one little slice of the public and then of
[1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:39.040]  course the audio cassette tape now CD at deadly recipe 1.5 million Americans are
[1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:44.680]  killed injured by prescriptions prescription mistakes 1.5 million are
[1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:48.760]  killed and injured by prescription mistakes each year in America and
[1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:52.320]  everybody wants prescription nobody should want prescription except for
[1:24:52.320 --> 1:25:02.920]  antibiotics and they know this and I mean here's a microcosm example in the
[1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:07.920]  trials of Prozac the big granddaddy of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor
[1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:13.800]  psychotropics doctor as you know they knew it massively increased psychotic
[1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:19.480]  outbreaks artificial mental illness suicidal tendencies suicide and it took
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:27.760]  decades up until just five years ago to force the SSRI's makers to add the fact
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:34.520]  that it causes mania psychopathic behavior suicide it took decades to make
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:38.520]  them put it on the label they knew from day one and what do they prescribe it
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:43.120]  for depression when they know it actually causes depression I mean they're
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:49.680]  ruthless oh you're absolutely right the prescription have been a nasty thing
[1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:54.680]  I don't know if it's a conscious tool they use keep the population down or if
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:59.400]  they can't be that stupid the doctors are very bright but they are eager to
[1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:04.320]  take some cases they're able to be swayed by free lunches and money throw
[1:26:04.320 --> 1:26:07.640]  down by farmers sure I mean I'm not even talking about the doctors they're kind
[1:26:07.640 --> 1:26:13.080]  of given from on high like Moses on the mountain you know fluoride's good for
[1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:19.360]  you mercury's good for you you know all of this stuff is wonderful you know don't
[1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:24.040]  treat the cause you know treat the symptoms but I mean I'm talking about
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:28.160]  the American Medical Association and Big Pharma that owns it yes well you're
[1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:32.240]  exactly right and of course I mean here's my example to support what you're
[1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:37.880]  saying we can actually in most cases get rid of diabetes type 2 diabetes which
[1:26:37.880 --> 1:26:42.840]  right now you take in the prediabetic patients you're looking at 90 million
[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:47.200]  Americans which is almost one third of the population has type 2 diabetes we've
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:53.600]  known because prevention cure type 2 diabetes is 1957 54 years and I'm the
[1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:56.880]  only guy in the world we use it if we get people routinely weaned off their
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:27:01.040]  medication in two or three days sometimes a week and they can have either with
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:07.240]  injectable infant have blood sugars of 222 40 and within 30 days they're down to
[1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:11.920]  blood sugars of 72 they weaned off their medication go back to why I mean what
[1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:17.640]  about this doctor how about how they tell diabetic patients to drink soft
[1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:23.680]  drinks with aspartame in and I've had countless medical doctors on breaking
[1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:27.600]  down the fact that that stuff absolutely decimates people that have
[1:27:27.600 --> 1:27:34.400]  diabetes well yeah first the answer team is made out of amino acids actually
[1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:43.520]  of course it acts like sugar for a diabetic it's just they should not not be consuming anything that has pure amino acids or pure sugar or
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:47.920]  agave syrup or you know things that you would think of as being healthy a whole
[1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:52.160]  grain even the whole grain breads are bad for diabetics use of their bad proof
[1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:56.400]  badness doctors they you know carry around an orange if your blood sugar goes
[1:27:56.400 --> 1:28:00.640]  below either either it's pretty well if you just eat nuts if you're allergic to peanuts
[1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:08.960]  I get mixed fancy nut to eat mixed fancy nuts the deluxe of nuts and you'll have
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:15.040]  a regulated blood sugar that doesn't go way up doesn't go way down actually
[1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:20.320]  comes down to the deficiency of a couple of trace minerals and everybody takes
[1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:23.680]  them every day that's why I like what we call the biting night just what we did
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:29.480]  the animal industry Alex so we give animals well doc I gotta stop you I was
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:32.320]  really excited about this interview today and we tried to get a different
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:35.640]  phone line I really want to be able to understand you and hear you but the
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:39.760]  but the line has just gone to where we can't understand you I'm gonna put you
[1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:42.680]  on hold and I'm gonna give you our number and I'm gonna see if you can get
[1:28:42.680 --> 1:28:46.520]  on with us for the rest of the hour because this is such powerful information
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:50.600]  I really want people to be able to hear it understand it we're gonna work on
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:56.360]  that with Dr. Wallach we may just have to have him back up next week because if I
[1:28:56.360 --> 1:28:59.680]  can't understand him I can imagine some of you are having a problem so I apologize
[1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:02.520]  the station's out there I can hear a lot of it but some of it I'm having to
[1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:07.520]  really strain and this information is so important I am really into doing things
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:12.640]  that I know can really help people if you filter your water with the proper
[1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:16.720]  filtration systems it's hard to find them it's hard to cut fluoride out you
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:20.800]  will have incredible health benefits that's scores of medical doctors
[1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:24.920]  endocrinologists brain surgeons we've interviewed them all we have literally
[1:29:24.920 --> 1:29:27.880]  hundreds and hundreds of studies that's conservative it's in the thousands but
[1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:31.800]  I've looked at hundreds that fluoride sodium fluoride hurts the thyroid the
[1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:35.760]  whole body and we've been beating this drum for years it's the government's
[1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:39.360]  finally having to admit a bunch of this well another big part of the equation is
[1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:44.840]  mineral deficiency and vitamin deficiency and Dr. Wallach has got the
[1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:50.840]  documentation on this and we can help a lot of people with this information
[1:29:50.840 --> 1:30:00.400]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[1:31:03.400 --> 1:31:07.840]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:11.880]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:31:11.880 --> 1:31:15.280]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:31:15.280 --> 1:31:19.800]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:31:19.800 --> 1:31:24.360]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:31:24.360 --> 1:31:28.400]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:31:28.400 --> 1:31:32.160]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:31:32.160 --> 1:31:35.800]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:31:35.800 --> 1:31:40.120]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:31:40.120 --> 1:31:43.240]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:31:43.240 --> 1:31:46.960]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[1:32:50.680 --> 1:33:18.000]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:24.600]  network well I've been really excited about interviewing Dr. Joel Wall it
[1:33:24.600 --> 1:33:29.200]  turns out he's on the road today joining us via payphone that explains the audio
[1:33:29.200 --> 1:33:37.040]  issues again I have researched this myself I've just looked at the main
[1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:42.600]  line studies they know that the many of the fields are played out that much of
[1:33:42.600 --> 1:33:46.440]  the agriculture land we're using has been destroyed because of the chemical
[1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:53.840]  fertilizers the establishment knows and understands this and they understand the
[1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:58.920]  mineral deficiencies we have Dr. Wall it give us your greatest hits I mean I mean
[1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:01.840]  of all the research you've done of what you understand what are some of the
[1:34:01.840 --> 1:34:06.960]  biggest lies out there and how do we reach out to people and and and warn
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:12.240]  them about what's happening okay the biggest lies Alex are when you have a
[1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:16.480]  disease like type 2 diabetes and doctors will say oh it's genetic we just have to
[1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:20.840]  be able to deal with it and they convince people that treating the symptom the
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:25.560]  main symptom of elevated blood sugar is the way to manage the disease you'll
[1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:30.200]  get maximum life well that's not true it's a very simple disease of what's
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:33.600]  called the insulin receptor site on the cell walls of all the trillions of
[1:34:33.600 --> 1:34:36.960]  cells your body's kind of like turning off the breaker in the next room you can
[1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:40.520]  plug in a 10 billion dollar computer and if the breakers shut off in the other
[1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:44.600]  room it ain't working and the same thing is true with your insulin type 2
[1:34:44.600 --> 1:34:50.480]  diabetics have ten times the circulating insulin as a non-diabetic it
[1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:53.640]  just doesn't work for the breakers are shut off in the insulin receptor sites
[1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:59.200]  in the cell walls so what we figured out how to do was actually flip on those
[1:34:59.200 --> 1:35:04.840]  receptor sites those insulin receptor sites wow and usually sometimes as
[1:35:04.840 --> 1:35:11.680]  quickly as 24 hours blood sugar will go from 220 300 down to 72 so you got to
[1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:14.960]  watch it you have to take your blood sugar and adjust your insulin or your
[1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:18.480]  pills they don't get yourself an insulin shock because your blood sugar will drop
[1:35:18.480 --> 1:35:23.240]  dramatically on this program and people will ask me well how long do I have to
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:26.560]  stay on this the nutritional program pretty average size person I like to
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:30.400]  cost about three bucks a day about half the price of a cup of exotic coffee
[1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:36.320]  right and as well as long as you're on oxygen you will need these nutrients as
[1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:39.200]  long as you're on water you will need these nutrients if you're dead you're
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:43.200]  not taking oxygen and water you don't need these nutrients the reason why we're
[1:35:43.200 --> 1:35:46.060]  in trouble is we're deficient in these nutrients as you pointed out so
[1:35:46.060 --> 1:35:50.680]  eloquently there are fields they're depleted because we're not repleting
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:55.320]  we're not replenishing the minerals in our soil like we did in the old days our
[1:35:55.320 --> 1:35:59.280]  grandparents used to put minerals back in the soil in the form of wood ashes
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:03.200]  they would cook with wood stoves and heat with fireplaces wood stoves they
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:06.280]  would take the wood ashes which are not carbon they may have carbon in them but
[1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:10.200]  basically wood ashes are the minerals that the trees sucked up out of the
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:14.840]  ground and they are left over when you burn the carbon in the wood for fuel and
[1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:19.640]  they used to put these wood ashes aka plant minerals into the soil their
[1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:23.920]  gardens and then the sweet potatoes and the squash and the tomatoes and beans and
[1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:28.600]  peas and corn and cucumbers and melons would pull these mills up you'd eat the
[1:36:28.600 --> 1:36:32.160]  food and you get the minerals in that fashion well we don't do that anymore
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:35.920]  and farmers do not get paid by how many minerals are your food they get paid by
[1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:40.000]  tons and bushels for acre and so really their businessmen they could care less
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:43.960]  how many minerals are in the pasture for the livestock or how many minerals are
[1:36:43.960 --> 1:36:47.280]  in the hay or the feed they're given their livestock but as insurance their
[1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:51.040]  insurance is different than ours instead of buying an insurance policy to pay the
[1:36:51.040 --> 1:36:55.160]  veterinarian when they screw up their insurance policy is to give each
[1:36:55.160 --> 1:37:00.680]  individual animal by hand the minerals to ensure they get them it's very
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:03.600]  efficient economically they're not just throwing those minerals in the ground and
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:06.920]  hope the plant takes them up they're actually giving them one by one to the
[1:37:06.920 --> 1:37:12.720]  animals and one of the ways to monitor how good this is is production of meat
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:17.040]  per pound to feed production of eggs production of milk per pound to feed and
[1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:22.880]  also longevity for instance when you and I were kids Alex an old dog was eight
[1:37:22.880 --> 1:37:26.840]  years old today no dog is 25 we didn't do that with wonder drugs we didn't do
[1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:33.000]  that with things like a bargain transplants and stem cells and
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:36.920]  acolytine proteins basically what happened was we just put bottomless
[1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:41.400]  minerals in our food the same thing is true for diabetes what if and this is
[1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:46.080]  true and I'm just saying what if the entire city of Austin were to listen to
[1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:50.040]  us today and say okay we're gonna make Austin the first diabetes-free city and
[1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:54.480]  it's doable within a couple of weeks everybody would take the 90th century
[1:37:54.480 --> 1:37:59.320]  nutrients the Alex pack if you will the Alex pack the 90th century nutrients
[1:37:59.320 --> 1:38:02.680]  and then throw in what we call the sweeties which is the secret sauce for
[1:38:02.680 --> 1:38:07.760]  diabetes and take their blood sugar like you're supposed to and it'll come
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:13.360]  down the wean author medication and Austin would be a diabetes-free city
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:18.000]  in a couple of weeks now now dr. Wallach again this is just one of the huge
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:22.400]  discoveries that you basically rediscovered but going back when I
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:28.840]  worked for you know Jess Adkins out in East Texas large animal vet when I
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:36.120]  worked for Billy Bob Dunn in Dallas a small animal that I mean I didn't know
[1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:40.360]  about medical things I was just listening to them and so often they would
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:43.800]  talk about mineral and vitamin deficiencies and here give your dog
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:48.480]  these minerals give them these vitamins and then when I got into large animal
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:54.240]  husband tree for those three summers I mean it was all about that and so much
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:57.640]  of it was you know you need to put them on this feed or you need to give them
[1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:02.440]  this block and and and I've got family that ranches they all know that so this
[1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:06.280]  isn't some big secret for veterinarians and of course you're a veterinarian and
[1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:14.280]  also a naturopathic doctor so again why aren't Americans who are having all
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:19.520]  these degenerative diseases and problems and things like diabetes why aren't
[1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:24.080]  they being told this well you have to appreciate that the doctor is not
[1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:28.480]  required by law to cure you and they're secure available and this is the first
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:31.000]  thing I would do if I was ever appointed when you get to be president
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:36.560]  Alex I want to be your first surgeon general out of the law that every
[1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:40.680]  doctor should be curing people where there's cures available otherwise they
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:44.920]  go to jail for 25 years alive without possibility of parole and since their
[1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:48.240]  average lifespan for doctors is 56 none of them will ever get out of jail so I
[1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:54.360]  like that part anyway the reason why for instance it usually takes depending on
[1:39:54.360 --> 1:39:58.480]  their body weight three to five hours a day to get people to wean off their
[1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:02.480]  medication when they have diabetes and go back to a normal life can't legally
[1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:08.320]  use the cure words so that's why I'm saying it the way I'm saying it then by
[1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:12.200]  option the alternative is if they treat people and teach them how to use
[1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:16.880]  insulin or pills to manage your blood sugar which is a meaningless process
[1:40:16.880 --> 1:40:22.320]  because elevated blood sugar is not the disease it's a symptom of these they the
[1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:27.560]  doctor will make the average a family doctor who diagnoses it usually will
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:34.000]  make $750,000 so you compare $300 and $750,000 which way are they gonna go now
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:38.600]  let's break that down and of course the average doctor is just busy they're
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:42.240]  just following what the American Medical Association says and they
[1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:45.680]  subconsciously go along with it because it's profitable and they've got all
[1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:51.480]  these bills and the rest of it but doctor how does it work and again we're
[1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:57.200]  talking to dr. Joel Wallach how does it work down at the you know cellular level
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:01.240]  how does not having all the trace elements and minerals and things that
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:05.080]  you need how does that just in the one area of diabetes that we're talking
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:09.680]  about there's so many other areas that we cover at info wars team calm one
[1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:13.480]  place to find all this information we've got your you know free audio there we're
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:18.640]  gonna add a video of this show today there at info wars team calm dr. Wallach
[1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:23.080]  expanding on that how does this interact at the cellular level not having these
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:27.600]  minerals and nutrients and what are those minerals and nutrients okay well first
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:32.200]  of all we need that basic 90s-century nutrients the 60 minerals 16 vitamins
[1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:36.400]  12-century muasses and three essential fatty acids that's the basic Alex pack
[1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:40.080]  this is the platform that everybody needs just to prevent disease I mean I'm
[1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:44.860]  going on 72 here I've been taking this myself since I was nine years old for
[1:41:44.860 --> 1:41:51.080]  64 years and I had my own issues that caused me to begin to take this when
[1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:55.000]  I was nine years old which I resolved in three days and doctors couldn't you do
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:58.360]  look very young you don't look I mean you look like you're 50 well thank you
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:01.960]  yeah most people think I'm 50 but I'm 20 years older than that chronologically
[1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:06.520]  and biologically I'm 18 my bone density does to my mass your last disease that
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:10.480]  of an 18 year old so I'm very proud of that I've been taking the 90th century
[1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:14.680]  nutrients and since I was nine years old and the whole purpose of that Alex is
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:19.080]  to do what we do for our cars for instance we put oil in our cars before
[1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:22.080]  the engine burns up if you have an expensive car like a Cadillac or a
[1:42:22.080 --> 1:42:26.240]  Bentley or Mercedes or something you change all every thousand miles or
[1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:31.320]  every month where you drive or not and so to prevent the engine from burning up
[1:42:31.320 --> 1:42:34.400]  get an extra three hundred thousand miles in distance well the same thing is
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:38.920]  true for us people get all the panic once they get fibromyalgia and lupus and
[1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:43.000]  and diabetes and arthritis and all the doctors says they got to get a double
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:48.040]  knee replacement tomorrow I'm already scheduled well cancel the darn surgeries
[1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:52.080]  and give me 30 days and we'll rebuild the cartilage in your knees it's that
[1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:55.320]  simple as it's just you need that platform of the 90th century nutrients
[1:42:55.320 --> 1:42:59.040]  now once somebody has a full-blown disease like diabetes you have to add
[1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:03.760]  some of the secret sauce back in which is not as you point out not secret in the
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:11.280]  case of diabetes it's two trace metals called chromium and vanadium now if you
[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:14.360]  just take chromium vanadium by the self you would drop your blood sugar say from
[1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:18.000]  220 to maybe 200 not very dramatic and people say well I can do that just by
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:22.320]  not eating fruit and so why should I take those things if I'm paying out of
[1:43:22.320 --> 1:43:25.800]  my own pocket insurance is not paying for it the government's not paying for it
[1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:31.000]  why should I do it less because when the research is done in animals the animals
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:35.600]  get are getting their basic laboratory rat getting big rabbit or monkey pellets
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:38.960]  with all the nutrients in it and they just leave out the one they would leave
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:41.880]  out chromium or vanadium or both chromium vanadium but all the other
[1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:46.600]  90th century nutrients are going to have in there whereas the average American
[1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:52.480]  doesn't have many of those 90th century which they might be bang along 12 or 15
[1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:57.280]  and then there'd be 65 short and so that's a big huge problem so when you
[1:43:57.280 --> 1:44:01.200]  take the chromium vanadium nothing dramatic happens so that's why they
[1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:06.880]  have to take the alex pack as a basic nutrient platform so basically it's
[1:44:06.880 --> 1:44:11.000]  almost like an adjuvant from talking to a medical doctors and scientists and
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:17.040]  brain surgeons on the subject fluoride is something that accelerates all of the
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:21.520]  other toxic things that are in you and almost gives it an acceleration effect
[1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:26.120]  or an amplifying effect you're saying all the minerals and vitamins together
[1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:30.400]  they have an amplifying effect because you need them all together and to be
[1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:34.400]  quite frank why Dr. Wallach is here and why I've approached him to have him on
[1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:40.440]  and to work with him I was a health nut and by health nut running six miles
[1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:44.840]  almost every day lifting weights super good shape 2% body fat when I was like
[1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:49.560]  22 I got into radio fighting the globalist just quit working out obsessed
[1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:53.400]  on it eating unhealthy and now for about three years I've quit most the
[1:44:53.400 --> 1:44:57.040]  unhealthy stuff in fact all of it I've been running I've been lifting weights
[1:44:57.040 --> 1:45:02.440]  I've been eating less but still I haven't felt good and now in the last few
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:07.440]  months I was doing research on you know with Mike Adams and with Dr. Wallach and
[1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:10.520]  with so many other people looking at their material studying the actual
[1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:14.680]  documents and I really came up with the fact that I'm gonna really announce this
[1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:18.000]  here today I haven't even told Dr. Wallach this and now I'm doing it publicly
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  so I got to put up or shut up last year I said I wait I'd lose 50 pounds only
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:28.840]  lost 25 I want to lose at least 40 pounds in this next year that's my pledge
[1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:34.160]  that's my resolution and and and doing the research it's not enough to go
[1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:38.280]  jogging in the morning or lift weights or even eat less I have got and I'm
[1:45:38.280 --> 1:45:41.480]  somebody's never taken vitamins in my life even when I play football I've now
[1:45:41.480 --> 1:45:45.520]  gotten these products I'm gonna start them next week and we're gonna see what
[1:45:45.520 --> 1:45:49.440]  happens but from all the research I've read if I don't want my hair to go gray
[1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:52.040]  which is all the sudden starting to happen I've got to get the nutrients
[1:45:52.040 --> 1:45:55.280]  even if I try to eat healthy and my wife makes all sorts of vegetables and
[1:45:55.280 --> 1:46:00.000]  things it's hard to get all of these things together and that's what we need
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:05.440]  and I would just think back to vets that I work for obsessed with vitamins and
[1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:09.320]  minerals and this is some of the old-timers all new as Dr. Wallach said
[1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:13.280]  he just discovered it in his own research and has now helped so many people
[1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:19.640]  and it's it's just it's so fundamental to get this message out to people that's
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:24.200]  why we've created info wars team.com we're gonna be adding banners up there
[1:46:24.200 --> 1:46:27.600]  we've got free audio we're gonna be adding a bunch of video a bunch of a free
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:33.520]  material on this but also very inexpensively priced big line of things
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:39.480]  for full spectrum and what Dr. Wallach has developed over the last I know 30
[1:46:39.480 --> 1:46:44.240]  40 years I don't know how long he's been doing it it's just so amazing and I do
[1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:47.840]  believe in this just like I believed in silver when it was $5 an ounce and now
[1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:52.680]  it's almost 30 it's like I believe in gold it was $260 dollars an ounce now
[1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:56.880]  it's right up at 1400 I mean I've done my research just like I bought
[1:46:56.880 --> 1:46:59.880]  storeable foods three or four places and finally found a good place and that's
[1:46:59.880 --> 1:47:04.360]  who my sponsor is I've done my research and now I found Dr. Wallach I've known
[1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:08.040]  him about him for 15 years but I just went through my research because now I'm
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:11.840]  gonna try to go on a health kick and we're gonna see right now what happens
[1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:16.520]  with the full line of longevity products all discounted right there at info
[1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:23.000]  wars team.com and when you sign up there you then get to get discounts on it you
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:26.760]  can sign others up this is a great way to create community organizations to
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:31.560]  educate people and in the free market profit from helping people tell folks
[1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:36.080]  about what they can do by by signing up or getting involved at info wars team
[1:47:36.080 --> 1:47:40.680]  dot com Dr. Wallach. Well Alex first of all they're gonna be able to get to these
[1:47:40.680 --> 1:47:45.880]  products at wholesale they'll save 30 to 40 percent from the marketplace we're
[1:47:45.880 --> 1:47:49.880]  gonna get products that are a thousand times better from formulation standpoint
[1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:53.960]  and amounts so for instance in some cases we have three thousand times a
[1:47:53.960 --> 1:48:01.040]  minimum rate minimum daily requirements of the vitamins we have maybe 500 times
[1:48:01.040 --> 1:48:05.320]  minimum daily requirement for minerals whereas when you get something off the
[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:09.120]  shelf of the grocery store or pharmacy these you know one-a-day multiple kind
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:12.920]  of things you're looking at 20% of the minimum daily requirement and so this is
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:18.680]  why people tend to be a downward spiral also for one time $10 fee for one time I
[1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:23.640]  believe it's a $10 fee you get a business and we will train you for
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:28.680]  nothing we will train people we do conference calls webinars we have
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:33.680]  regional and national meetings local meetings and they can not only help
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:36.640]  themselves with their health the people they love they can generate an income
[1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:41.560]  stream I have a tax deductible business which is a willable asset this is part
[1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:46.160]  that I love Alex you can work for a company for 40 years be the best
[1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:49.960]  employee they have to go to person to fill in when somebody's not there or
[1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:53.560]  train the new people you're the one they give the overtime to when you
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:59.800]  retire or die you cannot will or sell your job to your heirs but your young
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:03.360]  jivity business you can do that we're very very excited about our association
[1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:07.080]  with you because you're going to get the word out and in this economy we're going
[1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:10.560]  to help people stay away from doctors by keeping them healthy before they get
[1:49:10.560 --> 1:49:15.200]  sick we're going to help people cancel those double knee replacement surgeries
[1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:20.840]  and let us help them rebuild their knees we're going to help a rebuild cartilage
[1:49:20.840 --> 1:49:24.840]  ligaments tenants connective tissue bone it's doable we do with professional
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:28.960]  athletes and military personnel all the time we do with people that because
[1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:33.640]  minerals and vitamins are what we're made up of that's exactly right and it's
[1:49:33.640 --> 1:49:37.000]  real simple and so many of the vitamins I see on store shelves doctors you know
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:42.360]  it's synthetic versions you guys actually have the raw true vitamins and
[1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:45.600]  minerals explain to people briefly the difference well the difference is
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:51.000]  everything we have comes from plants and bacterial fermentation grinding up
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:54.640]  rocks doesn't count for instance if you have salt water source of minerals
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:49:58.680]  which is a liquid mineral we love liquids because we absorb all you only
[1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:03.680]  get 985 milligrams of minerals from salt water whether it's a great salt lake or
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:09.160]  the oceans around the world and in ours ours are from a certified organic plant
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:14.680]  source so this plant compost if you will it's been certified organic every year
[1:50:14.680 --> 1:50:20.040]  for 35 years that you can actually see the it's a biological source so it's
[1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:24.360]  ready to be sucked up by your body it's living as it's living it's already been
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:28.600]  predigested by the plants and so you don't have to do that and we're gonna
[1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:33.920]  give you 19,000 milligrams per quart 20 times what you get in ours is cheaper
[1:50:33.920 --> 1:50:39.400]  than everybody else's amazing it's info wars team at dot-com the sites loading

[1:53:03.360 --> 1:53:08.200]  typical doctor both a veterinary and a naturopathic physician doc asks why
[1:53:08.200 --> 1:53:12.400]  does the United States spend more money on health care by far and still rank
[1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:16.640]  50th in health and longevity worldwide he believes that people should empower
[1:53:16.640 --> 1:53:20.960]  themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition taking charge of their life
[1:53:20.960 --> 1:53:25.600]  and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition not by toxic
[1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:29.640]  prescription drugs leading to side effects this is clearly a deadly recipe
[1:53:29.640 --> 1:53:33.640]  the good news is doc wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number
[1:53:33.640 --> 1:53:37.120]  of Americans who are waking up to all the big government and big pharma
[1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:41.120]  manipulation of our health care system I like what doc wallach is saying and

[1:55:12.440 --> 1:55:16.960]  our track record if I have good judgment but people make their own judgment I am
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:22.240]  going to start on the regimen of the basic products you've developed that are
[1:55:22.240 --> 1:55:26.320]  mineral and vitamin based and all natural because it's full spectrum and
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:29.240]  I've done the research and you're the only organization or group that I've
[1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:35.080]  found that that fits in with the separate research I've done and what I learned
[1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:40.440]  working for veterinarians and of course you are veterinarian but also a
[1:55:40.440 --> 1:55:47.280]  naturopathic indeed and so the website is info wars team dot com and I'm
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:51.560]  flattered that you guys even created me on my own website for this that hooks
[1:55:51.560 --> 1:55:57.080]  into your great website so again they've got great discounts there and it
[1:55:57.080 --> 1:56:00.760]  isn't 10 bucks you sign up as a membership and then you can also sell

[1:56:05.640 --> 1:56:09.000]  amazing there's quite a few of them up there on the side at info wars team
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:14.680]  dot com and the time we have left dr. Joel Wallach other key tidbits other
[1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:21.360]  things that mineral and vitamin and trace element deficiencies are triggering
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:24.480]  and causing I know it's not just hair falling out in gray hair and bad
[1:56:24.480 --> 1:56:28.600]  fingernails and bad skin and you know on the inside it's causing problems isn't
[1:56:28.600 --> 1:56:32.080]  it yes you're exactly right when you have a gray hair you're also getting a
[1:56:32.080 --> 1:56:35.400]  breakdown of the elastic fibers your arteries and your blood vessels you're
[1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:40.200]  going to get spider veins very close veins hemorrhoids ruptured aneurysms even
[1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:44.760]  L. Brine stein died at age 76 or ruptured aortic aneurysm which is a
[1:56:44.760 --> 1:56:48.920]  simple copper deficiency and of course it also causes white hair which he was
[1:56:48.920 --> 1:56:53.880]  legendary for and then you can also you're going to get with the deficiencies
[1:56:53.880 --> 1:56:56.920]  of these trace elements you're going to get bone-to-bone arthritis for which the
[1:56:56.920 --> 1:57:01.720]  medical system has joint replacement surgeries doctors are screaming for a
[1:57:01.720 --> 1:57:06.000]  epidemic of arthritis coming here because there's 80 million baby boomers
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:09.760]  coming along and medical doctors have convinced them not to take vitamins and
[1:57:09.760 --> 1:57:13.480]  minerals and as a result they're all breaking down and what I tell people
[1:57:13.480 --> 1:57:20.200]  Alex is to cancel your scheduled double knee replacement or double hip
[1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:25.120]  replacement or your low back surgery give us to give the Alex pack in the
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:29.920]  extra gluco gel which is the secret sauce to supporting and promoting maintenance
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:33.000]  repair of cartilage a ligament tendons connected tissue disc between the
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:38.080]  vertebrae give us two months and if you still think you need your surgery you
[1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:41.840]  can always get the surgery but you can't always get undead and so there's
[1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:45.640]  always a tremendous risk with surgery from infection the implications for
[1:57:45.640 --> 1:57:50.280]  Alice I've had one surgery and they almost killed me in Dallas when I was 16
[1:57:50.280 --> 1:57:54.760]  for a broken leg and and and I've got a hernia and I won't go in for surgery
[1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:57.880]  because I'm afraid they'll kill me yeah yeah you don't want to go in for surgery
[1:57:57.880 --> 1:58:02.520]  they are the instrument of the bad guys you want to go in there believe me
[1:58:02.520 --> 1:58:06.520]  believe me listen they they tested my blood I'm gonna hold you over for five
[1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:09.120]  more minutes Dr. Walton you can do it and then we're gonna get Bob Chapman
[1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:13.200]  because I want to tell this story I'll start telling it now my leg gets broken
[1:58:13.200 --> 1:58:18.680]  the bone's almost sticking out of the meat they tell me you need a pin I go in
[1:58:18.680 --> 1:58:21.840]  and have the surgery after the surgery they came in they said we tested your
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:26.680]  blood you don't have any opiates in your body you're not a heroin user there's
[1:58:26.680 --> 1:58:31.200]  no drugs in your blood but it took nine times the regular amount to put you
[1:58:31.200 --> 1:58:35.280]  under I kept waking up on the operating table then after that they didn't put the
[1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:39.480]  IV in right I woke up with blood all over me it was a nightmare I do not want
[1:58:39.480 --> 1:58:44.600]  to ever go in for surgery again are you tired of searching for great talk radio
[1:58:44.600 --> 1:58:52.440]  something more important search no more we are the GCN radio network Alex told
[1:58:52.440 --> 1:58:56.080]  you the government announced recently that the recession is over it ended on
[1:58:56.080 --> 1:59:00.920]  June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree
[1:59:00.920 --> 1:59:04.800]  perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for
[1:59:04.800 --> 1:59:08.520]  the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the

[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:25.280]  only thing I've got missing is that I am nutrient deficient I haven't went a
[2:01:25.280 --> 2:01:28.400]  month ago and had my blood tested okay now going back to dr. Wallach's we're
[2:01:28.400 --> 2:01:33.960]  almost out of time I was telling that story and you talk about dead doctors
[2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:38.600]  don't lie that's the name of your radio program and that's absolutely accurate
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:42.040]  the guy that did my surgery was supposedly you know this great doctor
[2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:46.720]  in Dallas he was a nice guy he was a former NFL lineman and he was a big guy
[2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:50.440]  he was only I think was less than 50 years old and he did the surgery and
[2:01:50.440 --> 2:01:53.680]  then I went called four weeks later and said I need to get scheduled to have the
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:56.960]  pen taken out I still got the pen by the way and they said well the doctors had a
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:01.800]  huge heart attack he's down at the coast and he may be retired and I called back
[2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:04.840]  a few months later I said is he able to remove the pen or I got a new doctor to
[2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:08.640]  do it they said we're sorry the doctor has died and he wasn't even if I remember
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:13.920]  was even 50 yet so you talk about the statistics and I've seen them of medical
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:17.960]  doctors dentist you name it I mean these people how are we listening to anything
[2:02:17.960 --> 2:02:22.160]  they say when they've got very low life expectancies you're exactly right Alex
[2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:25.920]  and this is why we came up with the Alex pack so that the average American would
[2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:29.840]  could live to be well beyond 100 chronologically be biologically 30 the
[2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:34.200]  average medical doctor according to their own research Alex is 56 why would we
[2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:38.080]  listen to a bunch of guys whose average lifespan is 56 how to live to be 100
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:42.280]  they die from cancer diabetes heart attack stroke all the things we want to
[2:02:42.280 --> 2:02:46.840]  prevent their cure what why do we go to them and it's a madness and so I really
[2:02:46.840 --> 2:02:51.160]  really appreciate our alliance here and your ability to communicate is just
[2:02:51.160 --> 2:02:55.240]  going to be a novice in saving America from the medical system by getting them
[2:02:55.240 --> 2:02:58.960]  on a healthy program if you don't get sick you don't need a doctor you don't
[2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:02.800]  need a doctor if you get sick anyway but well not only that is my plan that's
[2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:05.440]  why I reached out to you so did the research I knew who you were at
[2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:09.120]  interviewed before as just as a guest and I thought this is the guy to team up
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:13.360]  with and I'm honored to be working with you because it's very very simple it's
[2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:16.480]  just like fluoride they're now admitting that sodium fluoride is so toxic to the
[2:03:16.480 --> 2:03:22.440]  body the government had to admit it last week you know that's something I'm sorry
[2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:26.240]  go ahead it's an insecticide they use sodium fluoride for an insecticide to
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:31.240]  kill ants you know fire ants in Texas and Africa exactly so I go with what I
[2:03:31.240 --> 2:03:35.600]  know we can do doctor I say stop drinking fluoride or if I know we don't have the
[2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:39.200]  minerals we need I'm gonna promote it and I'm gonna do it myself I mean it's
[2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:43.000]  just all part of making the right decisions isn't it yeah absolutely it's
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:46.760]  kind of a do-it-yourself or concept Americans or Americans because we're
[2:03:46.760 --> 2:03:51.040]  independent we don't want the government doing anything for us except
[2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:55.080]  protecting us from enemies far into and domestic and in this case the enemies
[2:03:55.080 --> 2:03:58.840]  domestic or the politicians and the doctors and medical systems in the
[2:03:58.840 --> 2:04:03.200]  pharmaceutical industry the special interest then and again that's why
[2:04:03.200 --> 2:04:06.480]  they're moving with Codex Alimentarius that is in it says Codex
[2:04:06.480 --> 2:04:10.520]  Alimentarius in the Food Safety Act written by Big Pharma and Big Agra
[2:04:10.520 --> 2:04:16.080]  they want to shut down people like Dr. Joel Wallach being able to get us this
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:19.880]  information and by the way I'm going whole hog on this I'm giving this stuff to
[2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:23.560]  my parents I'm giving it to my family I'm not even gonna go out and try to sign
[2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:27.160]  them up I'm gonna give it to him first and see the results they get because I
[2:04:27.160 --> 2:04:29.800]  know they're gonna get great results because I've talked to countless people
[2:04:29.800 --> 2:04:33.960]  over the years about Dr. Wallach Dr. Wallach oh my gosh I was sick it made me
[2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:37.480]  better and then I did the research on the minerals I remember what the vets I
[2:04:37.480 --> 2:04:41.720]  worked for said it makes total sense let's try it out together info wars

[2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:11.880]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[2:07:11.880 --> 2:07:15.800]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true

[2:07:19.440 --> 2:07:24.000]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:28.040]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:07:28.040 --> 2:07:31.840]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:07:31.840 --> 2:07:35.440]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[2:08:06.760 --> 2:08:14.760]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:29.000]  we're gonna have open phones for the next 52 minutes with Bob Chapman who's
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:33.160]  always gracious to join us every Friday in the third hour his website of course
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:38.280]  is invaluable a place for research and of course is international forecaster
[2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:42.680]  dot com and we're gonna get into the economy a little bit with him the
[2:08:42.680 --> 2:08:46.480]  situation with Mexico and a few other issues in this segment and then we're
[2:08:46.480 --> 2:08:49.640]  gonna take your phone calls because I know Bob always enjoys hearing the
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:56.400]  different topics that you raise because he's a well-traveled very intelligent
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:01.080]  guy and he can certainly field any of your questions the toll-free number to
[2:09:01.080 --> 2:09:09.280]  join us is 800-259-9231 I want to get into OPEC ministers saying oil is gonna
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:14.320]  go to $100 a barrel the British are freaking out saying that will cause the
[2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:19.400]  EU to go down and that will push this over the edge because our economies are
[2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:25.320]  completely dependent almost completely dependent on oil and natural gas and
[2:09:25.320 --> 2:09:30.200]  distillates from it if Lindsay Williams Intel from the former head of Atlantic
[2:09:30.200 --> 2:09:36.680]  Richfield who's now died so we can release his name and and have if that
[2:09:36.680 --> 2:09:42.000]  comes out to be absolutely true and it goes to 150 a barrel to 200 that is
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:44.560]  going to be devastating the economy we're gonna get Bob Chapman's take on
[2:09:44.560 --> 2:09:48.880]  that but first I wanted to get in into the shooting with you because we haven't
[2:09:48.880 --> 2:09:52.840]  talked a lot about that today and we haven't talked to you since it happened
[2:09:52.840 --> 2:09:59.360]  Bob Chapman Bob what do you think's going on here you know formerly with
[2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:05.440]  US intelligence agency formerly the biggest private silver and gold broker
[2:10:05.440 --> 2:10:09.960]  had the biggest newsletter until you retired for a decade came back now you
[2:10:09.960 --> 2:10:13.920]  have the international forecaster I'm just reintroducing Bob for some stations
[2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:20.560]  out there that are new Bob what is your scoop as a as you kind of one of our
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:27.520]  learned omnibudsman of liberty on the situation out in Tucson well I think
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:35.800]  it's absolutely tragic that the shooter felt it necessary to shoot so many
[2:10:35.800 --> 2:10:48.720]  people if he had a disagreement with his fellow religious person who is
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:56.640]  misgivings then that's one thing and of course it's not meaningful that you
[2:10:56.640 --> 2:11:04.120]  should shoot anybody but they should have been left at that but it didn't it
[2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:11.760]  wasn't and I think from my experience that spraying of bullets all over the
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:19.080]  place was a cover I think that the perpetrator knew he was going to get
[2:11:19.080 --> 2:11:27.160]  caught and I think that the shootings of many people was a cover yes everybody
[2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:34.920]  will think that misgiven was the target and maybe she was but how about the
[2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:39.200]  judge who we know is probably the most conservative federal judge and and
[2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:43.760]  continually voted pro-second amendment and it helped shoot down the Brady Act
[2:11:43.760 --> 2:11:52.640]  with Sheriff Richard Mack well I also we're getting reports that he just days
[2:11:52.640 --> 2:12:02.800]  before had made decisions regarding the administration requesting that they be
[2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:12.080]  allowed to go after the assets of known drug dealers of one kind or another and
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:18.080]  and by known no judge no jury I did look up the ruling they were saying just let
[2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:23.360]  us grab anybody's money we want with no proof and judge roll said no so he died
[2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:29.920]  well I think and I have from the very beginning he was a target and they were
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:34.280]  going to teach him and that's the way they beat these people operate and they
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:41.320]  understand also that they were trying to skirt going the administration was
[2:12:41.320 --> 2:12:48.840]  trying to skirt going through Congress on the issue of a trade what I call
[2:12:48.840 --> 2:12:55.200]  confiscation of furlough case and IRAs of which there's six trillion dollars in
[2:12:55.200 --> 2:13:01.720]  them and so that they could access them and trade off government guaranteed
[2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:10.120]  annuities and I understand he shot that down as well and that's the case that it
[2:13:10.120 --> 2:13:16.400]  is plenty of reason to think that perhaps that was the real reason he was
[2:13:16.400 --> 2:13:22.920]  there I understand he had debated the spoken with miss given before who went
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:27.600]  to the same synagogue that he did which makes this whole thing even worse I
[2:13:27.600 --> 2:13:33.240]  mean just like if he went to the same church and you talk to somebody all
[2:13:33.240 --> 2:13:37.000]  the time and then you walk over and shoot him in the in the head yeah I know
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:39.920]  if you had all this together he wasn't supposed to be there they claim he was
[2:13:39.920 --> 2:13:45.600]  shopping but in the indictment and the charges against the grim reaper killer
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:50.080]  who admittedly now was on hallucinogens not almost every day multiple times a
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:55.360]  day out of his gourd thought he was under mind control was on drugs that that
[2:13:55.360 --> 2:14:00.760]  caused disassociation or amnesia classic mind control sir hand sir hand even
[2:14:00.760 --> 2:14:05.960]  mainstream news admitted that that was mind control the LA County medical
[2:14:05.960 --> 2:14:10.000]  examiner said that sir hand did not shoot him we know the name of the CI agent
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:15.880]  who did shoot RFK behind the head so so so we know this history the whole thing
[2:14:15.880 --> 2:14:20.000]  really does stink to high heaven and this happens right as the new Republican
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:24.680]  Congress is coming in the way the media seizes on it within hours saying it's
[2:14:24.680 --> 2:14:28.840]  conservatives the way the police and sheriffs protected this guy and he was
[2:14:28.840 --> 2:14:32.680]  death-threading everybody for months running around like a complete lunatic
[2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:37.880]  they've tried to seal all of that I mean just every alarm bell Bob Chapman goes
[2:14:37.880 --> 2:14:45.640]  off on this yeah you're absolutely right and the Pima County police chief or
[2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:54.520]  whatever he's called for the comments he made and he should be dismissed well
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:14:58.520]  he's my age he should retire anyway well Bob I don't know if you've seen all
[2:14:58.520 --> 2:15:08.120]  this but I've had CNN online I've had MSNBC I've had democracy now a bunch of
[2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:12.480]  other programs basically blame myself and Ron Paul they've shifted from
[2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:17.520]  Sarah Palin and Limbaugh because it's admitted the guy's a big liberal and now
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:22.280]  they're or was now they're going after their main target the true outsiders the
[2:15:22.280 --> 2:15:28.240]  true people that want a republic what's your take on Rachel Maddow implying that
[2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:32.840]  it's un-American what I've said what Ron Paul has said and she plays clips of
[2:15:32.840 --> 2:15:35.760]  it that the second amendment isn't just there for duck hunting or to stop
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:40.720]  criminals it's there to stop a hitlerian or Stalinistic type regime coming to
[2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:45.960]  power and that's exactly right and you would expect that kind of response for
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:51.320]  her I'm just disappointed they didn't name me well Bob I'm gonna play that
[2:15:51.320 --> 2:15:54.720]  clip I want to get your take on this I'm gonna read from the Declaration of
[2:15:54.720 --> 2:15:59.920]  Independence here is Mr. Maddow last night
[2:16:01.680 --> 2:16:06.880]  we have a lot of domestic enemies of the Constitution and they're right down
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:11.840]  the mall in the Congress the United States
[2:16:13.200 --> 2:16:18.480]  and right down Independence Avenue in the White House the unit that belongs to
[2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:25.360]  us it's not about my ability to hide which I love to do it's not about the
[2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:32.600]  ability for me to protect my family my property against criminals which we have
[2:16:32.600 --> 2:16:38.800]  the right to do but it's about it's all about us protecting ourselves from a
[2:16:38.800 --> 2:16:44.680]  tyrannical government of the United States second amendment not about
[2:16:44.680 --> 2:16:48.880]  hunting or self-defense it's about citizens having the ability to overthrow
[2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:52.600]  the tyrannical government of the United States as Congressman Paul Brown of
[2:16:52.600 --> 2:16:56.360]  Georgia speaking last April EJ Dionne wrote about this at the Washington Post
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:17:00.760]  today he found Republican Congressman Ron Paul making a roughly the same
[2:17:00.760 --> 2:17:04.640]  argument in print five years ago quoting Mr. Paul quote the second
[2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:08.360]  amendment is not about hunting deer or keeping a pistol in your nightstand it's
[2:17:08.360 --> 2:17:11.480]  not about protecting oneself against common criminals it's about preventing
[2:17:11.480 --> 2:17:15.160]  tyranny the founders knew that unarmed citizens would never be able to
[2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:19.080]  overthrow a tyrannical government as they did the muskets they used against
[2:17:19.080 --> 2:17:23.440]  the British army were the assault rifles of that time again the argument here is
[2:17:23.440 --> 2:17:26.360]  that the second amendment exists so Americans can overthrow the government
[2:17:26.360 --> 2:17:31.880]  that is a view it is it is a radical view of gun policy
[2:17:31.880 --> 2:17:35.680]  Americans are asked why are you buying guns they're buying it for civil unrest
[2:17:35.680 --> 2:17:39.640]  and to fight back against government tyranny it's conservative talk radio
[2:17:39.640 --> 2:17:44.400]  host Alex Jones okay it goes on from there here is the Declaration of
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:49.480]  Independence this is what this country was founded on this this is how America
[2:17:49.480 --> 2:17:54.520]  started and they talk about the tyranny and that the government is building a
[2:17:54.520 --> 2:18:00.200]  tyranny by design and a premeditated tyranny that's what we're fighting but
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:04.440]  when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the
[2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:10.480]  same object invents is a design to reduce them under absolute despotism and
[2:18:10.480 --> 2:18:14.960]  what are we saying it is their right it is their duty to throw off such
[2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:20.280]  government and to provide new guards for their future security so Rachel Maddow
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:27.240]  hates what America is she is fundamentally non-american and she is an
[2:18:27.240 --> 2:18:30.960]  enemy of the Republic I mean it's it's that simple and I will fight her in the

[2:19:23.120 --> 2:19:32.440]  Adolf Hitler was a good example he was funded by the Lodge banks and brokerage
[2:19:32.440 --> 2:19:37.520]  houses in New York and London although I don't think he knew where a lot of the
[2:19:37.520 --> 2:19:43.040]  money was coming from do I think he cared it was a wind up toy what's that

[2:24:07.960 --> 2:24:12.880]  all right as promised I do want to take your phone calls but Bob was cut off by
[2:24:12.880 --> 2:24:17.960]  the break he was getting into how the globalist and I mean this came out
[2:24:17.960 --> 2:24:22.360]  of congressional hearings finance the communists and the Nazis and that's the
[2:24:22.360 --> 2:24:27.560]  British model British Imperial model they've got to create the enemy so that
[2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:31.840]  they can then build up giant armaments industries that are used to then bankrupt
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:38.000]  their domestic slaves that's how powers consolidated Bob Chapman continuing and
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:46.400]  so Edward Sy the bankers pre-wrote the treaty and they pre-wrote the
[2:24:46.400 --> 2:24:53.360]  conditions and when Germany capitulated they were able to do exactly what they
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:25:00.640]  wanted and what would reside was all about was the planning and preparation
[2:25:00.640 --> 2:25:06.160]  for World War two that's why I mentioned the funding of Adolf Hitler a good
[2:25:06.160 --> 2:25:14.160]  part of which came from not German hands and of course the main contributors in
[2:25:14.160 --> 2:25:19.760]  Germany were the two major steel companies the Thyssen and Krupp and they
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:26.480]  were supposed to be disbanded in 1948 and of course that never happened and so we
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:31.200]  all of these enemies that were created were created by these people and they
[2:25:31.200 --> 2:25:37.760]  were organizations and they set up this dichotomous situation in Europe after
[2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:45.360]  the fall of the Weimar Republic in the early 19 to mid 1920s and in that effort
[2:25:45.360 --> 2:25:51.840]  they split the people in in Europe generally but specifically in Germany
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:56.840]  which had all bad problems before anybody else did and before the Great
[2:25:56.840 --> 2:26:03.040]  Depression came along and you were either a Bolshevik or you were a
[2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:09.040]  national socialist and that's how they got the war going and they financed both
[2:26:09.040 --> 2:26:13.760]  sides and they do it over and over and over again and that's why it's not
[2:26:13.760 --> 2:26:18.760]  difficult for me to figure out what they're going to do next in the world
[2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:25.840]  economic arena today because they've got a formula that's right exactly they do
[2:26:26.040 --> 2:26:31.840]  it's a disgusting to deviate for it from it once in a while because the Alex
[2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:38.200]  Jones show and other talk radio and the internet is forcing them to do that and
[2:26:38.200 --> 2:26:43.880]  every time that we broadcast across the world we're influencing people by
[2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:47.320]  telling them the truth very simply well Bob that's what's happening that's what
[2:26:47.320 --> 2:26:53.240]  creeps me out we've got big breaking news and I've gotten so conditioned to
[2:26:53.240 --> 2:26:56.960]  accept that I'm living in a tyranny and to deal with it psychologically so I can
[2:26:56.960 --> 2:27:02.520]  live my life that I'm becoming too comfortable with it I mean I but things
[2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:07.400]  are moving so quickly now but but even though I know it's evil I'm almost just
[2:27:07.400 --> 2:27:10.880]  going well that's what's happening now they've got telescreens going up in
[2:27:10.880 --> 2:27:14.360]  shopping malls and Walmart telling you computers aren't safe homeland
[2:27:14.360 --> 2:27:18.200]  security's taking the web over for your safety watch everyone don't trust each
[2:27:18.200 --> 2:27:22.960]  other they're sending FBI to conservative bloggers houses who've asked polite
[2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:27.160]  questions of Congress people at events like why did you give a political
[2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:31.520]  contribution to this guy if you're conservative they are now issuing
[2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:36.520]  homeland security reports saying if your neighbor talks about politics go ahead
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:40.000]  and call Homeland Security on them they're saying if you buy guns and ammo
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:43.680]  that's a sign of terrorism I mean this is all just flooding out where they're
[2:27:43.680 --> 2:27:50.080]  just admitting yes Homeland Security's for you and the rollout is this guy who
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:56.040]  fits the classic MO has every earmark of a mind control assassin and then it's
[2:27:56.040 --> 2:28:03.360]  super creepy from MSNBC to democracy now to talk radio I've even got Limbaugh
[2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:08.080]  basically blaming me for films I'm in I mean I've got the left and right blaming
[2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:15.360]  me it's all my fault Bob well it's to be expected because you're at the spear
[2:28:15.360 --> 2:28:20.920]  point and you are driving them crazy and they want to find a way to shut you up
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:25.280]  and it's not gonna stop it's gonna get worse so what are they just gonna keep
[2:28:25.280 --> 2:28:31.280]  demonizing me and then just arrest me for some trumped up baloney or of course
[2:28:31.280 --> 2:28:38.160]  they will yeah and we discussed this a dozen years ago and it's not gonna go
[2:28:38.160 --> 2:28:44.280]  away and I'm a little bit older than you are I won't enough to be a dad and I
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:48.280]  decided that if I'm gonna continue to do what I'm doing I'm gonna get out of
[2:28:48.280 --> 2:28:56.200]  harm's way at least make it difficult for them to try to find me and so that
[2:28:56.200 --> 2:29:01.400]  was my choice as an elderly person but I haven't let up one bit and you know that
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:05.480]  and so we got to keep on doing what we're doing because what we're doing is
[2:29:05.480 --> 2:29:09.960]  right and it's going to work and that's why people all over the world are
[2:29:09.960 --> 2:29:14.840]  writing you emails thank you very much please keep it up I know you're right
[2:29:14.840 --> 2:29:22.000]  and so that's enough for us a thanks to keep right on going doing what we're
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:25.400]  doing well I mean look I've said this a thousand times when I come back go to
[2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:30.000]  calls I'll say it again if this was just some boss hog corruption I would be on
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:33.400]  the air criticizing it because I would know it was a danger can grow out of
[2:29:33.400 --> 2:29:39.920]  control but this is real organized evil I mean they really want the nastiest
[2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:44.240]  meanest police state they're openly announcing they will take everybody's
[2:29:44.240 --> 2:29:48.000]  pension funds they're openly announced and they want to throw basically
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:51.400]  everybody in prison I mean this is really a nasty group of terror and
[2:29:51.400 --> 2:29:58.080]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[2:29:58.080 --> 2:30:00.560]  network
[2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:07.160]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[2:30:07.160 --> 2:30:11.680]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[2:30:11.680 --> 2:30:15.680]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[2:30:15.680 --> 2:30:20.360]  turned members influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[2:30:20.360 --> 2:30:25.880]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to
[2:30:25.880 --> 2:30:30.040]  pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[2:30:30.040 --> 2:30:35.240]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[2:30:35.240 --> 2:30:39.280]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're

[2:34:04.280 --> 2:34:09.800]  absurd so ridiculous all right that I tend to agree with Ron Paul when he set
[2:34:09.800 --> 2:34:15.000]  on my show a few months that is the first minute or so of the 20 minutes
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:21.600]  19 minute 52nd video the witch hunt begins citizen spy network targets
[2:34:21.600 --> 2:34:27.720]  political speech gun owners and it is now happening they admit the homeland
[2:34:27.720 --> 2:34:32.000]  security the threat fusion centers it is if you're red white and blue if you're
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:37.520]  a real American who isn't a communist or an authoritarian you are the enemy and
[2:34:37.520 --> 2:34:41.120]  that's what Obama basically said he said we you know anybody speaking out
[2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:45.280]  against corruption you're causing the violence and we need to all you know
[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:52.160]  together we thrive that means I'm Vulcan right I'm sure one land you know one
[2:34:52.160 --> 2:34:57.120]  people one leader and they they want that collectivist control instead of its
[2:34:57.120 --> 2:35:01.480]  people who are bound together by the love of liberty and freedom it's bound
[2:35:01.480 --> 2:35:05.440]  together by the state and control and then making us dependent I will be going
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:11.360]  over the fourth hour live today ladies and gentlemen the reason I cut a few
[2:35:11.360 --> 2:35:15.360]  months ago the fourth hour is because I'm starting a new TV show soon I've
[2:35:15.360 --> 2:35:18.000]  been working on it developing it out of house and I'm not gonna be able to do a
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:21.520]  show TV show every day I do four hours of radio but in the interim I'm gonna
[2:35:21.520 --> 2:35:27.360]  start doing four hours a lot or part of four hours and I'm going to be doing a
[2:35:27.360 --> 2:35:31.160]  lot of other things here but continuing with Bob Chapman a Tunisian
[2:35:31.160 --> 2:35:38.960]  president quits after violent protest the Tunisian president fled today after
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:43.280]  23 years in power and fled to North Africa State as the authorities declare
[2:35:43.280 --> 2:35:46.960]  a state of emergency following deadly protests this is what always happens in
[2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:50.360]  countries what happened in Romania what's happened in Russia before what's
[2:35:50.360 --> 2:35:54.720]  happened here with our founding fathers and they teach the firemen and police and
[2:35:54.720 --> 2:35:59.440]  military I've got the FEMA training videos they teach them that the founders
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:03.520]  are bad and that standing up against the tyrannical government is bad our
[2:36:03.520 --> 2:36:07.880]  founders revolted over much less now I believe in the info war I know we're
[2:36:07.880 --> 2:36:11.720]  winning I know we can win the hearts and minds of the police and military I know
[2:36:11.720 --> 2:36:15.280]  we can take it back through the Tenth Amendment that our founders put in there
[2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:19.480]  as a peaceful way but if they start trying to oppress that and trying to
[2:36:19.480 --> 2:36:24.120]  shut us down and trying to take our guns and trying to bring in a Romanian or a
[2:36:24.120 --> 2:36:29.320]  Tunisian or a Soviet style thing I'm not gonna roll over here ladies and
[2:36:29.320 --> 2:36:34.000]  gentlemen and as Kennedy said those that make peaceful revolution impossible
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:40.600]  make violent revolution inevitable okay so I'm done with churches burning I'm
[2:36:40.600 --> 2:36:44.440]  tired of the feds blowing stuff up and blaming it on patriots it's time for the
[2:36:44.440 --> 2:36:49.720]  military and police to choose sides but but here's this example of Tunisia he
[2:36:49.720 --> 2:36:55.160]  begged them to stop he begged them to to grovel he did a live address I call
[2:36:55.160 --> 2:36:58.000]  them Tunisians of all political persuasions and from all regions to
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:01.880]  demonstrate patriotism and unity now if he'd have been smart he'd have gone and
[2:37:01.880 --> 2:37:05.320]  blown a little girl's head off grabbed a mental patient and said that he did it
[2:37:05.320 --> 2:37:09.280]  and the mental patient would have been an enemy of the prime minister and then
[2:37:09.280 --> 2:37:13.720]  the public might have stopped see our government's smarter they know how and
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:16.840]  people really start waking up and revolutions in the air they just say
[2:37:16.840 --> 2:37:20.360]  activate that schizophrenic we got drugged up send them in make sure they
[2:37:20.360 --> 2:37:25.760]  get a kid and oh by the way next hour why am I going into overdrive Aaron has
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:31.200]  the New York Times Aaron has the actual Nixon tapes that when there was a
[2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:37.440]  political shooting that happened with George Wallace and and you know during
[2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:44.160]  that whole period with Arthur Bremer that they went and planted stuff in his
[2:37:44.160 --> 2:37:47.800]  house saying he was a leftist when it turned out he was a schizophrenic and
[2:37:47.800 --> 2:37:50.800]  there's some evidence that he probably was actually mind-controlled they're
[2:37:50.800 --> 2:37:55.200]  just the Nixon tapes of him saying okay let's set him up you want to talk about
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:38:00.920]  that a little bit before we go to calls Bob Chapman well in a way it's vague
[2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:06.800]  it's been a long time ago I had the pleasure of meeting George Wallace and
[2:38:06.800 --> 2:38:14.160]  Lerlene and it was another government set up to shut him up it's just as
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:19.440]  simple as that and it's been so many of them and that's why people have to be
[2:38:19.440 --> 2:38:25.160]  extremely careful and you wonder why people in their 40s and 50s all the
[2:38:25.160 --> 2:38:32.960]  sudden have cancer or fast acting cancer and all of a sudden they're gone or they
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:37.240]  have a heart attack and if that doesn't work then they have an aneurysm there's
[2:38:37.240 --> 2:38:43.760]  things that government is doing to shut up people who they don't want talking and
[2:38:43.760 --> 2:38:50.760]  it's going to continue you know it's just like the the assassin they sent
[2:38:50.760 --> 2:38:56.720]  after Kennedy after Reagan unless you're going to shoot somebody behind the
[2:38:56.720 --> 2:39:04.760]  ear you don't use a 22 I use something it's going to take them down and and so
[2:39:04.760 --> 2:39:13.240]  there's all sorts of little clues along the way that remind you that very often
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:17.120]  these people are set out to do what they do by government and that could very
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:21.160]  well be the case that we've seen in Arizona we just don't know it yet well
[2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:26.240]  it's confirmed that the Sirhan Sirhan was staged that's even London Guardian I
[2:39:26.240 --> 2:39:29.600]  mean it just it's confirmed the police in LA even gets confirmed I mean it's
[2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:34.960]  fact and when you look at the Arthur Bremer situation he was a schizophrenic
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:39.880]  out of his mind had clear government connections and we got Nixon on tape you
[2:39:39.880 --> 2:39:46.440]  know to go over to his house and plant stuff to say that that he did it for the
[2:39:46.440 --> 2:39:50.280]  liberals and we just saw the Democrats do that against the conservatives and
[2:39:50.280 --> 2:39:54.160]  when that didn't work they went and said okay it's Ron Paul and Alex Jones it's
[2:39:54.160 --> 2:39:59.600]  those people that want to audit the Fed it's their fault and that will continue
[2:39:59.600 --> 2:40:05.900]  unabated and we're going to get blamed for more and more things and the way you
[2:40:05.900 --> 2:40:10.480]  challenge that you you made it head on and say look we didn't do that we
[2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:16.760]  wouldn't do that and this is what we stand for and probably 80% of the
[2:40:16.760 --> 2:40:20.400]  American people are more would say gee and that's what I and that's what I
[2:40:20.400 --> 2:40:25.720]  stand for as well so the government's wrong and Alex is right and they're
[2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:31.560]  gonna dig their own hole they can't win a media war even though they control the
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:37.880]  major media they can't win it because every day people are fleeing from the
[2:40:37.880 --> 2:40:43.320]  major media whether it's television or it's the newspapers the magazines they're
[2:40:43.320 --> 2:40:47.240]  fleeing because they know what's wrong they know there's something out there
[2:40:47.240 --> 2:40:52.040]  and they're looking for it maybe they won't be people who act that's okay
[2:40:52.040 --> 2:40:58.340]  everybody isn't built that way everybody isn't a soldier and so that's
[2:40:58.340 --> 2:41:05.160]  the direction we're headed in and we're gonna stop these people and all we have
[2:41:05.160 --> 2:41:09.640]  to do is tell the truth and that'll do it well I know this at the end of my
[2:41:09.640 --> 2:41:12.960]  life they're not gonna be able to say that I didn't engage tyranny and that I
[2:41:12.960 --> 2:41:16.400]  shat there on my hind end and they can't say that about you Bob I mean this
[2:41:16.400 --> 2:41:20.920]  tyranny that's being brought in is so wicked so scientific so pervasive so
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:26.360]  complete it must be met with resistance it is not even a question I mean we
[2:41:26.360 --> 2:41:32.280]  cannot give the species and uncounted generations over to this grip of what
[2:41:32.280 --> 2:41:38.280]  the globalist call the final revolution the endless tyranny you know I mean I
[2:41:38.280 --> 2:41:43.000]  mean they talk about how it's a complete death grip where they will end the
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:48.400]  human species as it is known so that we're so crippled we can never again
[2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:54.360]  rise I mean that is just pure Satanism let's go ahead and take a call from Ron
[2:41:54.360 --> 2:41:59.600]  in New York Ron you're on the air go ahead hello John hey buddy what's on
[2:41:59.600 --> 2:42:03.680]  your mind today okay of course the thing that's first and foremost the
[2:42:03.680 --> 2:42:09.920]  prominent is a shooting in Tucson Arizona one thing I noticed the pattern
[2:42:09.920 --> 2:42:14.480]  that has evolved here and I've seen this before certainly in certainly in the
[2:42:14.480 --> 2:42:18.640]  last ten years I've seen this pattern and this is why I would advise your
[2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:24.280]  listeners to be particularly observant and on God if you notice you'll see one
[2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:29.080]  half of the media which represents what is defined as the left in this
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:35.080]  paradigm very aggressively seek you know incessantly beating the same drum
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:39.880]  basically it boils down to let's take away civil rights and rights that you
[2:42:39.880 --> 2:42:44.920]  have and on the other side there are what I would lack of better words or
[2:42:44.920 --> 2:42:50.400]  term described as organizations that or or media outlets that try to pose
[2:42:50.400 --> 2:42:54.800]  themselves as more traditionalist or some people would call right wing
[2:42:54.800 --> 2:42:59.440]  loyal opposition right but the loyal opposition if you notice is sort of
[2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:04.840]  laying back at being rather melbetos and ineffective or even non-existent in its
[2:43:04.840 --> 2:43:12.200]  responses to the other side calling for suppression of rights now when this
[2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:17.360]  happens you have to be careful because see a lot of people still believe that a
[2:43:17.360 --> 2:43:22.320]  lot of these institutions still function properly well I put a certain
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:27.520]  political majority in power or I have a certain organization that's supposed to
[2:43:27.520 --> 2:43:31.960]  advocate for Second Amendment rights well when they take this approach you
[2:43:31.960 --> 2:43:35.520]  better be well warned that what's happening here is that they're going to
[2:43:35.520 --> 2:43:39.320]  go into the back room and this is all by design and they're going to sell you
[2:43:39.320 --> 2:43:43.080]  out a little further let me stop you and get Bob's take and and Ron I haven't
[2:43:43.080 --> 2:43:46.160]  heard from you in years are you the retired police officer yes I am yes
[2:43:46.160 --> 2:43:48.720]  oh you always give us you haven't called them or haven't gotten through and what
[2:43:48.720 --> 2:43:52.520]  about two years yeah I've tried a few times with no luck yeah but don't think
[2:43:52.520 --> 2:43:57.480]  I forget you because I mean I recognize great Patriots voices absolutely I I
[2:43:57.480 --> 2:44:01.640]  don't watch a lot of TV or I watch boil downs on YouTube or clips people send me
[2:44:01.640 --> 2:44:08.000]  but last night I ended up watching about two hours of CNN and Fox and MSNBC to
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:14.960]  analyze what was happening after I got home and I saw Fox on almost every show
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:20.520]  except Lynn Beck praising Obama speech praising that brainwashing Soviet
[2:44:20.520 --> 2:44:25.920]  rally that nighttime rally that collectivist you know come to the altar
[2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:31.000]  of collectivism rally and I saw them going yeah maybe and on other channels
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  CNN MSNBC going look the Republicans get it it is time to lower the rhetoric
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:40.360]  it may be it is time for some more gun control hey this is looking pretty good
[2:44:40.360 --> 2:44:45.640]  because now the Republicans have got the house and now they were fighting over
[2:44:45.640 --> 2:44:49.520]  who got to have the troughs and steal the money but now the mainline Republican
[2:44:49.520 --> 2:44:52.720]  leadership there are a few good new people in there but overall same old
[2:44:52.720 --> 2:44:58.120]  newt genrich style car carbon taxing gun grabbing globalist they're now in there
[2:44:58.120 --> 2:45:02.760]  and they're now going to share at the at the at the vampire feast on the
[2:45:02.760 --> 2:45:07.320]  American people with Obama and they're gonna weaken him just enough I've seen
[2:45:07.320 --> 2:45:10.840]  Carl Rove saying he wants Obama in for another four and they're gonna power
[2:45:10.840 --> 2:45:16.800]  share and perch on us and and and absolutely the Republicans are planning
[2:45:16.800 --> 2:45:21.200]  to stab us in the back like they always do but the difference is used to it took
[2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:25.160]  four five six seven eight years for a political flip-flop people to wake up
[2:45:25.160 --> 2:45:29.840]  they rejected Obama within six months now the Republicans are gonna be rejected
[2:45:29.840 --> 2:45:34.280]  it shows in just a few months if they don't instantly start repealing stuff so
[2:45:34.280 --> 2:45:38.800]  Howard I mean I look I welcome their treason now show us who you are scum
[2:45:38.800 --> 2:45:43.000]  show us who you are filth go ahead and come out in the open Bob Chapman and
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:50.160]  we'll drill them literally and and we'll keep on letting the people know what
[2:45:50.160 --> 2:45:54.080]  they're doing there and what they were sent to do there and they're not doing
[2:45:54.080 --> 2:45:59.720]  it and who's financing them all of the parties that were held by the lobbyists
[2:45:59.720 --> 2:46:04.760]  during the month of December for the incoming freshmen will call them and
[2:46:04.760 --> 2:46:11.760]  the House and the Senate and major corporations from Wall Street and banking
[2:46:11.760 --> 2:46:16.760]  and insurance and farmer and and transnational conglomerates they were
[2:46:16.760 --> 2:46:23.400]  just burying them in money and that you know we're gonna see who said no and who
[2:46:23.400 --> 2:46:28.000]  said yes but it's coming I think by March or April we'll know well look at
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:31.160]  Rand Paul he's getting more hardcore now that he is the senator he's coming out
[2:46:31.160 --> 2:46:35.560]  saying this is all a Rahm Emanuel cooked up narrative and it's freaking him out
[2:46:35.560 --> 2:46:39.920]  even on Fox he's coming right out and they're not gonna like it and the fact
[2:46:39.920 --> 2:46:44.360]  is he's gonna live with his dad who's gonna be there counseling him almost
[2:46:44.360 --> 2:46:49.200]  like Merlin counseling Arthur this is we're gonna see what happens now and we
[2:46:49.200 --> 2:46:52.200]  gotta pray for those two guys cuz they're for real and the globalists don't
[2:46:52.200 --> 2:46:56.440]  like them Ron a great points as usual did that basically concur with where you
[2:46:56.440 --> 2:47:00.760]  see things going it basically doesn't let me give you a little bit more of
[2:47:00.760 --> 2:47:04.960]  information because you certainly mentioned Fox we know Fox is owned by
[2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:08.920]  Rupert Murdoch dad is a New York Post now the New York Post and you could pull
[2:47:08.920 --> 2:47:12.280]  it up I'm sure online uncharacteristically I know I've read the
[2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:17.080]  paper for 15 years every day uncharacteristically now is taking as I
[2:47:17.080 --> 2:47:23.120]  says for lack of a better term what we'll call a left-leaning view and
[2:47:23.120 --> 2:47:26.360]  certainly I know there's not really a left or right there's just people out for
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:31.640]  power we're conspiring about this issue and they're calling for a boycott of
[2:47:31.640 --> 2:47:36.640]  Glock arms and basically saying Glock is responsible for this no absolutely
[2:47:36.640 --> 2:47:39.920]  ridiculous and they're always attacking the gun manufacturers we've got a buy
[2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:43.760]  more Glock well you notice there's record sale the Glock now so it blew up in
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:47.480]  their face look the good news is this isn't 15 years ago where they could sell
[2:47:47.480 --> 2:47:51.800]  these hoaxes everything's blowing up in their face now and that's why you see
[2:47:51.800 --> 2:47:55.720]  the Republicans and the Democrats kind of circling the wagons together because
[2:47:55.720 --> 2:48:00.520]  they're all perched on the pile of gold looking out from the pile it us the
[2:48:00.520 --> 2:48:06.320]  American people and they see us as wolves you know you know in in in their
[2:48:06.320 --> 2:48:10.200]  mind they're the shrinking violet you know in their petty kids going oh look
[2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:16.840]  at the rabble SWAT teams get them to take their guns I mean they see us as
[2:48:16.840 --> 2:48:20.880]  dangerous because we are we're the rightful heirs of this country we're the
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:25.080]  sovereigns it's we the people it's our country and if we don't like what this
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:29.200]  government is we can pull it down and put something else in place that's the
[2:48:29.200 --> 2:48:35.080]  declaration of that independence that's 1776 that's red white and blue Bob
[2:48:35.080 --> 2:48:43.480]  Chapman I hear you and if we're into that we'll remember 1788 in Paris as it
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:50.880]  evolved into August July the 14th it's 1789 and if they want to know what's
[2:48:50.880 --> 2:48:54.960]  going to happen to them if they don't stop what they're doing just read
[2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:59.520]  French history let's go ahead and talk to Robert and Georgia Robert you're on
[2:48:59.520 --> 2:49:03.240]  the air worldwide go ahead oh Alex and Bob it's an
[2:49:03.240 --> 2:49:07.840]  true honor to be with you I consider you all modern American heroes for exposing
[2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:12.720]  the globalist and one of the points I wanted to make I think what convinced me
[2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:17.560]  that 9-eleven was an inside job that they really are that evil was that film
[2:49:17.560 --> 2:49:22.320]  in Bohemian Grove I think that was a divine appointment by the God of the
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:27.800]  Bible that you got in there and exposed the Luciferian ritual yeah people can't
[2:49:27.800 --> 2:49:31.280]  believe that I actually infiltrated and got in and got out they think it must
[2:49:31.280 --> 2:49:36.080]  have been staged they must have letting for whatever reason I I snuck in they
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:39.520]  didn't tell me they were letting me I got questioned by the Secret Service and
[2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:43.440]  was able to you know get past them and we got the footage and it's there for all
[2:49:43.440 --> 2:49:48.280]  to see yeah I really believe you had angelic protection well there's no
[2:49:48.280 --> 2:49:53.160]  doubt I've got that every millisecond or I'd be dead right now oh absolutely and
[2:49:53.160 --> 2:49:59.560]  actually my question was for Dr. Wallach I've actually been using the tangy
[2:49:59.560 --> 2:50:04.520]  tangerine and I've noticed a great difference I used to suffer a lot from
[2:50:04.520 --> 2:50:08.960]  fatigue and I've been using it for several months now plus the fact where
[2:50:08.960 --> 2:50:13.280]  everybody else is getting sick around me I seem to be avoiding the sicknesses the
[2:50:13.280 --> 2:50:16.920]  coals that other people are yeah I got told about the tangy tangerine and I've
[2:50:16.920 --> 2:50:19.640]  just been taking it for about a month I'm about to get on all of it and I've
[2:50:19.640 --> 2:50:22.760]  felt her dramatic difference as well it's funny you mentioned that of their
[2:50:22.760 --> 2:50:27.000]  scores of products again that's info wars team.com if folks want to get the
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:30.800]  40% discount on that but absolutely we're gonna see what happens with it
[2:50:30.800 --> 2:50:33.960]  because I'm gonna get on all of the minerals and nutrients and stuff what
[2:50:33.960 --> 2:50:38.760]  was your question for Wallach next time he's on I'll ask it well I noticed in
[2:50:38.760 --> 2:50:43.600]  the plant-derived mineral powder and the ingredients one of the ingredients was
[2:50:43.600 --> 2:50:48.240]  was mercury and I saw lead but I know it just like with vitamin C if you take
[2:50:48.240 --> 2:50:52.120]  too much of that you get I think they have to put that because something
[2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:57.360]  naturally derived is gonna have just trace amounts of it bound into it like
[2:50:57.360 --> 2:51:02.800]  any fish has some mercury so I think that's the answer there. Is it really
[2:51:02.800 --> 2:51:06.720]  possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys? 18 years ago

[2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:20.280]  was released Richard Nixon planning to blame the shooting of George Wallace on
[2:54:20.280 --> 2:54:24.240]  the Democrats knowing that the guy was a paranoid schizophrenic and probably the
[2:54:24.240 --> 2:54:28.000]  evidence shows under their control as an operative but we know that was a
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:32.920]  staged event they planted black panther stuff and then porno magazines to make
[2:54:32.920 --> 2:54:38.680]  him look crazy or sexually deviant on top of it and then all this Democratic
[2:54:38.680 --> 2:54:43.560]  party stuff to make it look like he was a supporter and on these tapes you hear
[2:54:43.560 --> 2:54:48.160]  Nixon calling the Kennedys and saying if you need if you need any more secret
[2:54:48.160 --> 2:54:51.920]  service protection I want to protect you looks like the Liberals are behind
[2:54:51.920 --> 2:54:56.840]  this and they might want to get you to and oh let me call Mrs. Wallace I'm so

[2:56:05.560 --> 2:56:12.600]  Bob Chapman go ahead hey good afternoon Alex hello welcome if you are too quick
[2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:16.440]  point I don't know if if you have time for it but the first one I wanted to
[2:56:16.440 --> 2:56:23.800]  suggest a Google bomb a lot of a lot of mainstream artists sometimes they come
[2:56:23.800 --> 2:56:28.400]  and go when they talked about the answer we being anti-globalist but there's a
[2:56:28.400 --> 2:56:32.800]  new one I just saw music video the other day there's a rapper B.O.D.
[2:56:32.800 --> 2:56:38.360]  I don't know if you've heard of him but it's B.O. period B but you released a song
[2:56:38.360 --> 2:56:43.960]  called the Watchers and the video goes right along with it it shows you a lot
[2:56:43.960 --> 2:56:48.480]  of things that I mean your listeners are probably already up on but maybe well
[2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:52.080]  we are doing a Google bomb today that only plugged once we need to make it
[2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:56.480]  number one it's witch hunt FBI and that will lead people to our article which
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:57:00.480]  hunt FBI visiting conservative bloggers at your Tucson shootings this is
[2:57:00.480 --> 2:57:03.920]  something we've really got to get the word out on and not just the media
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:08.240]  telling you how great it is the FBI is now our political police our article
[2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:12.080]  with Watson counters that everybody please Google bomb today the search
[2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:18.800]  witch hunt FBI to show what's happening but I will check into that rapper what
[2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:23.960]  was the other point okay the other point is that you most of time you speak
[2:57:23.960 --> 2:57:28.360]  about rising consciousness and how everyone everywhere you're starting to
[2:57:28.360 --> 2:57:32.280]  wake up certain things but not everyone because I would be winning but it's not
[2:57:32.280 --> 2:57:35.200]  even consciousness it's just being aware that we go ahead
[2:57:35.200 --> 2:57:40.320]  well I just wait waking up and looking around to your surrounding but the
[2:57:40.320 --> 2:57:46.040]  uh I called in over over the break out I believe it was right before New Year's
[2:57:46.040 --> 2:57:49.680]  but I was listening to another podcast I don't plug the rancher like that but
[2:57:49.680 --> 2:57:54.760]  it's a very reliable source there's a couple of guests are talking about the
[2:57:54.760 --> 2:58:01.120]  the eclipse on the phone and how yeah I don't listen I got to go because we're
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:05.000]  almost out of time I don't get into all the esoteric stuff when I say raise your
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:08.840]  consciousness I mean actual brainwaves I mean be aware don't just be a blob
[2:58:08.840 --> 2:58:13.720]  watching television Bob Chapman comments on that no I think you covered it
[2:58:13.720 --> 2:58:17.380]  let's get out of the next one well we're going to break those to spend 30
[2:58:17.380 --> 2:58:22.360]  seconds on your view of the awakening is it accelerating
[2:58:22.360 --> 2:58:29.160]  oh it certainly is so will the same old tricks the establishment is using the
[2:58:29.160 --> 2:58:33.840]  past work now I don't think so I think they're gonna have to event something
[2:58:33.840 --> 2:58:40.760]  new and I think they they're gonna have to do a lot of things that they used to
[2:58:40.760 --> 2:58:45.480]  do in the open undercover GZN radio network providing the world with hard
[2:58:45.480 --> 2:58:53.120]  hitting talk radio GCN great talk radio starts here Alex told you the
[2:58:53.120 --> 2:58:57.000]  government announced recently that the recession is over it ended on June of
[2:58:57.000 --> 2:59:02.080]  2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a
[2:59:02.080 --> 2:59:05.440]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[2:59:05.440 --> 2:59:09.080]  of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news
[2:59:09.080 --> 2:59:13.320]  either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition to
[2:59:13.320 --> 2:59:16.920]  converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a

[2:59:52.120 --> 2:59:58.160]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[2:59:58.160 --> 3:00:14.680]  broadcasting network coming up we're gonna look at the shooting of George Wallace which on record Nixon had people plant things in the shooter's house
[3:00:14.680 --> 3:00:19.440]  schizophrenic to make it look political evidence is the shooter was clearly
[3:00:19.440 --> 3:00:23.160]  under mind control we know sir hand sir hand was but finishing up with Bob
[3:00:23.160 --> 3:00:27.480]  Chapman of the international forecaster.com by the way we can call
[3:00:27.480 --> 3:00:31.240]  Midas resources get a free hard copy or a free digital copy the latest issue it's

[3:00:43.360 --> 3:00:48.200]  jam in a few more calls but before we do that you were finishing up Bob you're
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:53.160]  saying that this isn't there they're using 20 30-year-old brainwashing and
[3:00:53.160 --> 3:00:59.520]  propaganda systems in the modern era and it's not working you're right too many
[3:00:59.520 --> 3:01:04.740]  people are aware of the methods that they've used in the past and I think a
[3:01:04.740 --> 3:01:09.800]  lot of things that they've been doing in the open in the last several years I
[3:01:09.800 --> 3:01:14.200]  think they're gonna have to think twice about it and start to be more
[3:01:14.200 --> 3:01:20.440]  surreptitious about what they do keeping it undercover you know like if
[3:01:20.440 --> 3:01:25.160]  somebody dies and they're one of them they're not going to be able to make a
[3:01:25.160 --> 3:01:29.800]  big thing about it in the future as they have in the past they're going to have
[3:01:29.800 --> 3:01:35.680]  to be cooler about what they do and I think you'll start to see that happen
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:42.320]  because they see that what we're accomplishing and they don't like it
[3:01:42.320 --> 3:01:48.640]  very much okay let's go ahead and take another phone call here let's talk to

[3:02:29.720 --> 3:02:33.960]  I don't even know where to start so I'm gonna start first by saying that that
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:38.720]  Obama speech propaganda thing I watched his speech this morning and you know what
[3:02:38.720 --> 3:02:43.200]  I thought you know I live in Detroit do you know how many people get shot in
[3:02:43.200 --> 3:02:48.280]  killing Detroit by the week no no now now Michelle has put out a letter to
[3:02:48.280 --> 3:02:52.200]  parents trying to make people think about their kids getting killed and then
[3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:56.640]  to associate it with loving her I mean they're just these drama queens always
[3:02:56.640 --> 3:03:01.040]  moralizing putting themselves in everyone's way and about see you didn't
[3:03:01.040 --> 3:03:06.680]  love us you made the little girl die oh worship me and all her fake crying it's
[3:03:06.680 --> 3:03:10.920]  disgusting Tim we're out of time I'd love to talk to you more and I'm gonna try to
[3:03:10.920 --> 3:03:14.840]  get to Adam 10 Mark Roy and others after Bob's gone we got Aaron coming in here
[3:03:14.840 --> 3:03:17.760]  with something the media is not talking about and something they don't want you
[3:03:17.760 --> 3:03:22.120]  to look at but I mean it's just so disgusting to see them when you're
[3:03:22.120 --> 3:03:26.880]  awake Bob how transparent that the psychic vampires are they made me want
[3:03:26.880 --> 3:03:31.800]  to throw up well you're absolutely right but the the problem is the average
[3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:38.720]  person certainly doesn't see it unless they watch it continually or more often
[3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:43.280]  than others and they're just not equipped to know what these people are up
[3:03:43.280 --> 3:03:49.640]  to and even in the other half of the population those who can think more
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:54.560]  clearly they have a hard time as well we're talking about things that people
[3:03:54.560 --> 3:04:00.280]  don't normally run into and it's just like people who we would expect would
[3:04:00.280 --> 3:04:05.320]  know about municipal bonds and they don't know what they are and so that's why
[3:04:05.320 --> 3:04:10.440]  we have to teach here on radio and television so the people will understand
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:15.520]  very simply what's being done to them
[3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:23.240]  well you're right about that Bob and it's certainly rough times ahead but we
[3:04:23.240 --> 3:04:26.880]  don't have any choice but to stand up against this because the globalists
[3:04:26.880 --> 3:04:30.600]  have shown in every other nation and here domestically they want to destroy
[3:04:30.600 --> 3:04:35.280]  things so that there's no path left for the general public ever bring them to
[3:04:35.280 --> 3:04:40.400]  justice that they use poverty and police state as a tool I mean it is
[3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:44.840]  literal darkness falling upon our society and they want to stuff out the
[3:04:44.840 --> 3:04:48.160]  light but they're not going to be successful Lord willing Bob Chapman
[3:04:48.160 --> 3:04:51.280]  it'll seem like five minutes from now we'll be talking to you next Friday my

[3:05:14.480 --> 3:05:18.560]  ACE inhibitor to date is lacto-kinin while lacto-kinin does not have the
[3:05:18.560 --> 3:05:22.320]  inhibitory potency of synthetic drugs commonly used in the treatment of

[3:06:13.240 --> 3:06:17.480]  from underneath the Americans at home I've termed members influence on our
[3:06:17.480 --> 3:06:21.680]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[3:06:21.680 --> 3:06:26.920]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention fall the
[3:06:26.920 --> 3:06:31.520]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[3:06:31.520 --> 3:06:35.920]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[3:06:35.920 --> 3:06:39.640]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[3:06:39.640 --> 3:06:43.600]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[3:06:43.600 --> 3:06:49.160]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[3:06:49.160 --> 3:06:55.280]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com we're
[3:06:55.280 --> 3:07:01.240]  watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv there's a
[3:07:01.240 --> 3:07:05.280]  man named dr. Wallach who is anything but your typical doctor both a veterinary
[3:07:05.280 --> 3:07:09.920]  and a naturopathic physician doc asks why does the United States spend more
[3:07:09.920 --> 3:07:14.240]  money on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity
[3:07:14.240 --> 3:07:18.360]  worldwide he believes that people should empower themselves with a basic
[3:07:18.360 --> 3:07:22.440]  understanding of nutrition taking charge of their life and attain optimal
[3:07:22.440 --> 3:07:27.080]  health and longevity through nutrition not by toxic prescription drugs leading
[3:07:27.080 --> 3:07:31.560]  to side effects this is clearly a deadly recipe the good news is doc wallach's
[3:07:31.560 --> 3:07:34.920]  message is resonating with an increasing number of Americans who were
[3:07:34.920 --> 3:07:38.720]  waking up to all the big government and big pharma manipulation of our health
[3:07:38.720 --> 3:07:42.400]  care system I like what doc wallach is saying and doing to enlighten people
[3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:46.440]  about health care and have joined forces to help this tireless crusader spread
[3:07:46.440 --> 3:07:51.000]  his message visit info wars team dot com and listen to dr. wallach's deadly
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:55.640]  recipes lecture it makes a lot of sense and I want you to join our info wars

[3:08:01.680 --> 3:08:21.480]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[3:08:21.480 --> 3:08:27.920]  well in studio with us is Aaron Dykes for this segment and Kurt Nemo worked on
[3:08:27.920 --> 3:08:31.000]  this story last night in this morning I was Aaron yesterday that pointed it out
[3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:35.200]  to me I had read about it in history but kind of forgotten about it is government
[3:08:35.200 --> 3:08:41.960]  attempting Nixon's dirty trick with Loeffner of the deranged shooter because
[3:08:41.960 --> 3:08:46.240]  if you go back to Nixon and the campaign that was going on with George
[3:08:46.240 --> 3:08:51.560]  McGovern and the outsider George Wallace who was like a Ron Paul and they
[3:08:51.560 --> 3:08:55.280]  called him races and stuff at the point as he was an outsider he was winning they
[3:08:55.280 --> 3:08:59.040]  were scared of him and in Nixon's on tape admitting get over to his house get
[3:08:59.040 --> 3:09:03.640]  over to the shooter's house plant democratic stuff in there to blame
[3:09:03.640 --> 3:09:10.680]  this on McGovern who who was the person you're running behind for the
[3:09:10.680 --> 3:09:14.840]  democratic nomination George Wallace who was in the lead and there's a lot of
[3:09:14.840 --> 3:09:18.840]  evidence and research that this was another CIA mind control op you know the
[3:09:18.840 --> 3:09:22.480]  medical people said that oh it looks like Arthur Bremer the assassin would be
[3:09:22.480 --> 3:09:26.360]  assassin that pumped four rounds into the stomach of George Wallace was a
[3:09:26.360 --> 3:09:29.840]  schizophrenic but that's what mind control does it artificially creates
[3:09:29.840 --> 3:09:34.840]  that but but here's Nixon and the audio is coming up it's scratchy but again we
[3:09:34.840 --> 3:09:38.000]  even have the New York Times confirming this I mean the people hear the Nixon
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:41.600]  you know tapes about other crimes and can't believe it but Aaron break down
[3:09:41.600 --> 3:09:45.320]  the history break down the facts of this and the parallel of what's happening
[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:50.760]  today yeah so Wallace was George Wallace was an important candidate because in
[3:09:50.760 --> 3:09:56.600]  68 he was the first outsider or third party at least in any main contemporary
[3:09:56.600 --> 3:10:01.200]  history to actually get electoral votes rather than it going to the Democrat
[3:10:01.200 --> 3:10:06.480]  or Republican then in 72 when Nixon's running for reelection he runs as a
[3:10:06.480 --> 3:10:10.960]  Democratic candidate but because of this assassination attempt is pulled out of
[3:10:10.960 --> 3:10:14.800]  the race and even though he tries to go back in as a third party he doesn't
[3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:19.120]  succeed because of his health but the important thing is that it's admitted
[3:10:19.120 --> 3:10:23.440]  and it's on tape as you're about to hear that Nixon's scheme to tie his foes
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:28.600]  that is the Democrats to the Wallace attack it's a direct parallel to the
[3:10:28.600 --> 3:10:33.160]  way the Democrats have been just shamelessly and disgustingly playing for
[3:10:33.160 --> 3:10:37.640]  political points the stuff with Loeffner and how they coordinated their attack if
[3:10:37.640 --> 3:10:41.800]  it'd be one thing if just one Democrat flew off the handle and those were their
[3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:45.760]  comments it's clearly coordinated you know from Bill Clinton the ex-presidents
[3:10:45.760 --> 3:10:49.400]  on down to Pelosi and all the major congresspeople yeah don't let a good
[3:10:49.400 --> 3:10:52.920]  crisis go to waste right out of the ramen manual playbook but who else had
[3:10:52.920 --> 3:10:57.320]  the playbook you know it was Nixon back in the 60s and this was this classical
[3:10:57.320 --> 3:11:03.360]  1972 era dirty tricks campaign with the likes of Howard Hunt Colson in the
[3:11:03.360 --> 3:11:06.920]  White House and the other players you may have read about if you've read that
[3:11:06.920 --> 3:11:11.800]  part of history well well said Aaron let's continue going over for those that
[3:11:11.800 --> 3:11:15.440]  don't remember this this era in history exactly what was going on at the time
[3:11:15.440 --> 3:11:21.720]  well it was in May of the 1972 race before the primary candidates had been
[3:11:21.720 --> 3:11:26.440]  fully selected it was a wide field and the Democrats of course this was the
[3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:31.040]  term after Bobby Kennedy was shot and so forth and you have Arthur Bremmer
[3:11:31.040 --> 3:11:36.880]  coming out of nowhere another loner who quote wanted attention and and as you
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:40.680]  later see Colson actually is reported to have met with them four days before the
[3:11:40.680 --> 3:11:45.400]  assassination but the point we have here the smoking gun is that we have
[3:11:45.400 --> 3:11:49.920]  Nixon and his White House saying on tape let's blame this on the left blame it
[3:11:49.920 --> 3:11:55.560]  on the Kennedy and McGovern people blame the left other White House aides
[3:11:55.560 --> 3:11:59.120]  bring up the record they say well this guy has a previous arrest maybe they'll
[3:11:59.120 --> 3:12:03.120]  have something to do with the gun shooting Nixon says screw it just go with
[3:12:03.120 --> 3:12:07.000]  the left thing just publish it get Colson to cause it doesn't matter say
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:11.280]  we've gots conclusive proof that's right yeah and Colson called his quote
[3:12:11.280 --> 3:12:15.920]  friends in the media including Bob Woodward and they reported that it was a
[3:12:15.920 --> 3:12:19.640]  leftist thing and that again Bob Woodward high-level naval intelligence
[3:12:19.640 --> 3:12:24.000]  and then of course later they used him to then burn Nixon from internally I mean
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:28.160]  this is just a pack of weasels yeah so you're gonna hear those smoking guns in
[3:12:28.160 --> 3:12:31.720]  this condensed two-minute clip but you should also listen to the 17-minute
[3:12:31.720 --> 3:12:37.000]  clip linked in Kurt's article he compares it to the JFK assassination says how
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:41.600]  they screwed that one up and set of linking the quote communist Oswald to
[3:12:41.600 --> 3:12:44.640]  the leftist they blamed it on the course he was in Dallas the night before I've
[3:12:44.640 --> 3:12:48.800]  interviewed the mistress with LBJ that was there all confirmed now the head
[3:12:48.800 --> 3:12:52.760]  head commander of the operation famous black ops assassination commander E
[3:12:52.760 --> 3:12:56.240]  Howard Hunt admits it all we've got it from every angle we've got LBJ's lawyer
[3:12:56.240 --> 3:13:00.440]  confirming the exact same story and then here's Nixon yeah I already screwed
[3:13:00.440 --> 3:13:06.000]  that up I mean these people are just so sick yeah and he even compares the wall
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:10.000]  is shooting to Huey Long says that guy should remember Huey Long he's just like
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:14.120]  him one of those guys who stirs up hate it's a real parallel to the kind of
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:18.000]  rhetoric we're seeing in the matter they haven't released but a thimble of these
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:23.600]  they use the rest of it for blackmail and and and that's why I mean we know
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:27.120]  they're blackmailing Obama we've got really good intel that I can't get into
[3:13:27.120 --> 3:13:31.840]  this time that Glenn Beck is blackmailed leave it at that I mean this is the
[3:13:31.840 --> 3:13:36.200]  stock and trade of this new world order this is how they control people and
[3:13:36.200 --> 3:13:39.240]  they've been obviously blackmailing limbaugh all these years with his drugs
[3:13:39.240 --> 3:13:42.080]  and other things he's doing and that's why all of us that are fighting
[3:13:42.080 --> 3:13:46.280]  tyranny have got to try to be as upright and good as we can like somebody out of
[3:13:46.280 --> 3:13:50.560]  the movie which is a true story like L Sid or something Tarleton Heston I mean
[3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:53.920]  we've got to be strong and pure and then that's the only thing that's
[3:13:53.920 --> 3:13:57.440]  fulfilling and they will use anything any dirt against you and they'll even
[3:13:57.440 --> 3:14:02.400]  manufacture dirt exactly because in this wall is shooting what you hear on tape
[3:14:02.400 --> 3:14:05.680]  and then what happened according to all the counts we have with Colson and
[3:14:05.680 --> 3:14:09.560]  Hunt Hunt wrote about it in his autobiography Nixon ordered them to break
[3:14:09.560 --> 3:14:12.920]  into Burmer's house and plant the literature that would blame it on McGovern
[3:14:12.920 --> 3:14:17.200]  Kennedy or anyone else on the left and magically when they do when the FBI
[3:14:17.200 --> 3:14:20.080]  later got there it was all there all the stuff they wanted put in there was
[3:14:20.080 --> 3:14:26.080]  there yeah the Secret Service and then they magically found a diary hidden
[3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:30.400]  under a bridge years later that prove it all later but they also found the one
[3:14:30.400 --> 3:14:34.320]  the day after I had to check my facts on the yesterday but a lot of people
[3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:38.120]  including Gorbadaw believed Howard Hunt himself planted that because the first
[3:14:38.120 --> 3:14:43.480]  line of this journal said it is my plan to kill either Nixon or Wallace with the
[3:14:43.480 --> 3:14:47.320]  pistol I have I'm paraphrasing but it's all right there in the report yeah and
[3:14:47.320 --> 3:14:50.920]  and and curtain article that links to all this is government attempting Nixon
[3:14:50.920 --> 3:14:56.680]  asked dirty trick with Lofner let's go ahead and play this two-minute condensed
[3:14:56.680 --> 3:15:01.840]  audio clip of the 17-minute unedited Nixon tape that's up on info wars com
[3:15:01.840 --> 3:15:29.120]  here it is
[3:15:29.120 --> 3:15:34.120]  they've been this on the right way be sure it can be assassination just they
[3:15:34.120 --> 3:15:39.840]  try to pin the assassin look we play the game with smartly change they have pinned
[3:15:39.840 --> 3:15:44.600]  the assassinations of Kennedy on the right way to the virtue it was done by a
[3:15:44.600 --> 3:15:50.000]  comment and it was the greatest hope that it's ever been correct perpetuated
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:55.920]  kind of respect police and Joe can we pin this on one of theirs well we can
[3:15:55.920 --> 3:16:00.600]  don't you agree but sure we know those are those who are in a hurry this whole
[3:16:00.600 --> 3:16:06.260]  student right that's easy she's doing this on the wire about 20-20 years old
[3:16:06.260 --> 3:16:13.020]  hell I'll say he was a supporter just say he was a supporter of a government and
[3:16:13.020 --> 3:16:18.280]  candidate I'll just put that out you say you have it on on a mistake about that
[3:16:18.280 --> 3:16:23.360]  I think that would be the rest of us so there ought to be a record out of the work
[3:16:23.360 --> 3:16:28.280]  it's true the record just say he was a supporter of that man and put it out to
[3:16:28.280 --> 3:16:34.840]  say that we have an authenticator report and charge the thing is to tell your
[3:16:34.840 --> 3:16:41.480]  man cross this is a hot tip and give it to somebody who's a friend one of the
[3:16:41.480 --> 3:16:45.840]  concern is the left the press or the local police or somebody else getting
[3:16:45.840 --> 3:17:00.240]  to get a party and they said the cursing from Wisconsin that he worked in the
[3:17:00.240 --> 3:17:06.280]  government so again we have a transcript of that but I go over basically what
[3:17:06.280 --> 3:17:09.680]  Nixon was saying there again Aaron yeah of course the audio is tough but that is
[3:17:09.680 --> 3:17:13.960]  the historical document we have and he says screw the record just blame it on
[3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:18.280]  the left put it on McGovernor Kennedy he says just say he was a supporter of
[3:17:18.280 --> 3:17:22.480]  McGovernor Kennedy repeats it over and over just put it out just say you have
[3:17:22.480 --> 3:17:26.400]  it on unmistakable evidence and then he orders them to leak that to the press
[3:17:26.400 --> 3:17:31.080]  and blame this Arthur Bremmer attempted assassination on the left what do we see
[3:17:31.080 --> 3:17:36.760]  today we see democratic opportunists blaming on the right-wing media so they
[3:17:36.760 --> 3:17:41.240]  can bring in this draconian legislation demonized talk radio assault the first
[3:17:41.240 --> 3:17:46.680]  amendment and attempt a new branding of a gun control it's disgusting it's the
[3:17:46.680 --> 3:17:53.440]  Rahm Emanuel Nixon playbook it is and didn't you know we know Cheney and Bush
[3:17:53.440 --> 3:17:57.480]  and and others came up with Nixon but but wasn't Roe in there with Nixon as
[3:17:57.480 --> 3:18:02.720]  well yeah well he was a student at the time he did college level student
[3:18:02.720 --> 3:18:05.720]  tricks and that's around the time that George Bush noticed him and said hey
[3:18:05.720 --> 3:18:08.520]  this guy's a good kind of opportunist yeah they made him the head of the young
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:12.280]  Republicans and all that yeah so he was involved but none at the high levels
[3:18:12.280 --> 3:18:16.880]  yet they were very proud of his dirty tricks though yeah yeah and then you
[3:18:16.880 --> 3:18:20.560]  know Howard Hahn on a slightly higher level doing all kinds of dirty hey what
[3:18:20.560 --> 3:18:26.160]  do you think of this new news about the Brad Metzler or Meltzler I'm pretty
[3:18:26.160 --> 3:18:29.200]  shocked to learn that he's in the news now saying he's best buddies with George
[3:18:29.200 --> 3:18:33.600]  Herbert Walker Bush the bohemian grove guy and and he's on radio making fun of
[3:18:33.600 --> 3:18:37.200]  the conspiracy theorists that are on his show while they advertise it was a big
[3:18:37.200 --> 3:18:40.320]  open fair show and all this I should have known better but you know I don't
[3:18:40.320 --> 3:18:44.320]  I don't turn down challenges I get on the field even if it's a rigged fight
[3:18:44.320 --> 3:18:48.320]  because I want to fight but well that's gonna be creepy coming out of the 27th
[3:18:48.320 --> 3:18:52.360]  on History Channel I haven't heard that about Meltzler and Bush but what the few
[3:18:52.360 --> 3:18:55.680]  minutes I've seen in that show was very disingenuous and I hope that's not the
[3:18:55.680 --> 3:19:00.600]  case with the other episodes well I mean now he's in USA Today doing all you know
[3:19:00.600 --> 3:19:06.560]  you know like Illuminati signs in in front of the temples he is saying he's
[3:19:06.560 --> 3:19:09.880]  in the inner circle these buddies with George Herbert Walker Bush helped him
[3:19:09.880 --> 3:19:13.200]  write this new book called the inner circle and so we've got this guy who's
[3:19:13.200 --> 3:19:18.200]  hanging out with the bohemian grove Grand Puba and he's in other radio
[3:19:18.200 --> 3:19:21.640]  interviews making fun of the conspiracy theorist but then while admitting all
[3:19:21.640 --> 3:19:26.240]  this is going on so they do a limited hangout while blaming the crazy
[3:19:26.240 --> 3:19:31.960]  delusional conspiracy theorist it's kind of the pattern yeah I mean I am just I
[3:19:31.960 --> 3:19:36.600]  mean I mean I should know better I mean I'll tell you History Channel I just any
[3:19:36.600 --> 3:19:41.560]  production they're involved in the 9-11 piece with them I mean they would wait
[3:19:41.560 --> 3:19:44.680]  till we had like an hour intermission for lunch and shoot the crowd when no one
[3:19:44.680 --> 3:19:48.760]  was there and then cut back to me as if I spoke to no one I mean it's just but
[3:19:48.760 --> 3:19:53.520]  that's not the Patty Meltzler Brad Meltzler Aaron great job on this report
[3:19:53.520 --> 3:19:56.400]  keep up the great research it's wonderful having Aaron here in-house with all of
[3:19:56.400 --> 3:20:00.280]  his deep research into everything tying it in to current events when we write
[3:20:00.280 --> 3:20:02.840]  back stay with us
