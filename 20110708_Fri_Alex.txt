[01:21.880 --> 01:27.920]  also had the lady joining us who was arrested earlier in the week at a city
[01:27.920 --> 01:33.800]  council meeting in Arizona but in Quartzville and it was her turn to speak
[01:33.800 --> 01:38.000]  but she was bringing up corruption and so they said arrest her the mayor said do
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.160]  not arrest her it is her time to speak and the police looked to the mayor and
[01:41.160 --> 01:49.840]  said we run this town boy so total mutiny and we mentioned a little bit on
[01:49.840 --> 01:54.560]  Tuesday but I'm gonna be going over it in detail with Miss Jones coming up about
[01:54.560 --> 02:00.840]  an hour and a half from now after Larry Pratt leaves us today now this happens
[02:00.840 --> 02:04.920]  a lot I I tend to start looking at a case and I get caught up in other news and
[02:04.920 --> 02:11.040]  then as things develop I really then get angry and have a big freak out over it
[02:11.040 --> 02:16.560]  and this started last night and this morning my wife and I spent off and on
[02:16.560 --> 02:21.080]  about three hours this morning trying because I know Jaren tried earlier in
[02:21.080 --> 02:27.720]  the week to find the location of the storage shed facility in Houston that
[02:27.720 --> 02:32.100]  the maintenance man lived at with his six children and he lost his job a few
[02:32.100 --> 02:37.600]  years ago as a welder lost his home couldn't get credit for one stayed in
[02:37.600 --> 02:41.720]  shelters for a while and got a job down the street from the shelter at a
[02:41.720 --> 02:47.280]  storage facility as the maintenance man and and he turned one of the large units
[02:47.280 --> 02:50.800]  and I've seen people here in Austin living in them that's one of the big
[02:50.800 --> 02:56.200]  dirty secrets and of course using the bathroom there at the business and had a
[02:56.200 --> 03:00.200]  air conditioner refrigerator computers everything and the by the way the
[03:00.200 --> 03:04.600]  children are homeschool that's why the photos and videos they look so happy and
[03:04.600 --> 03:09.440]  well-spoken intelligent folks they're trying to save money to get a house in
[03:09.440 --> 03:13.560]  the last couple years and it's not illegal to be poor and the CPS came and
[03:13.560 --> 03:18.920]  took them and said because they were living in the storage shed well I mean
[03:18.920 --> 03:22.400]  I've got distant cousins that I visited when I was a child who lived in things
[03:22.400 --> 03:29.960]  that were one step up from dirt floors my wife has sent me the general address
[03:29.960 --> 03:34.240]  of the place the storage facility the group doesn't even have a name as a lot
[03:34.240 --> 03:41.080]  of these little hole-in-the-wall places do we've done a big investigation and so
[03:41.080 --> 03:47.320]  we're gonna get you that address later in the hour and ask listeners my wife
[03:47.320 --> 03:50.400]  just called me when I got to the office he said she'd found the location on
[03:50.400 --> 03:55.320]  Google Maps talking to locals that know them so that we could send people there
[03:55.320 --> 04:01.720]  but I do not see this in her boil down all right well we'll pull up those
[04:01.720 --> 04:07.240]  Google Maps later in the hour for people watching at present planet TV and so I
[04:07.240 --> 04:13.800]  can direct folks to the general area so that they can get over there I am
[04:13.800 --> 04:21.320]  offering out of the gauge ten thousand dollars of our info wars capital of my
[04:21.320 --> 04:26.640]  personal money to the family to help get them an apartment or a house and I
[04:26.640 --> 04:29.160]  know we have so many listeners in Houston that if we just put out the word
[04:29.160 --> 04:32.960]  because obviously they don't have credit like a lot of Americans we can find
[04:32.960 --> 04:37.200]  listeners that will rent them at a reasonable price a place and I will I
[04:37.200 --> 04:40.880]  will put ten thousand dollars of their rent down because I've been studying
[04:40.880 --> 04:45.160]  these people for five days they're good people and more and more of us are gonna
[04:45.160 --> 04:48.680]  be in the crosshairs of this there's a larger issue involved we're gonna break
[04:48.680 --> 04:53.200]  it down on the other side of this quick break I call the Houston Chronicle and
[04:53.200 --> 04:57.440]  said I'd like to give money and they just laughed at me we'll be right back stay

[08:52.640 --> 08:56.840]  going to be going over that huge news on the economy front also all over the
[08:56.840 --> 09:00.360]  United States cities are striking back against people growing gardens in their
[09:00.360 --> 09:05.840]  yards and trying to shut them down with code enforcers a new video has come out
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.680]  of a man arrested in his front yard turns out it's a prison planet TV
[09:10.680 --> 09:14.720]  subscriber turns out we have a statement from him sent the video last night and
[09:14.720 --> 09:18.320]  sure enough looked and there was a statement from the gentleman where the
[09:18.320 --> 09:21.720]  police pull his neighbor over put her in handcuffs while they searched the car
[09:21.720 --> 09:27.360]  the woman looks about as innocuous as Barney 5 and then let her go and the
[09:27.360 --> 09:32.760]  guy yells Nazis which it is a Nazi tactic to have warrantless searches and put
[09:32.760 --> 09:37.200]  people in handcuffs they th they TSA search her breast and grabbing them and
[09:37.200 --> 09:43.120]  the cops come over and charge him for racial slur against Nazis you cannot
[09:43.120 --> 09:49.080]  make this type of stuff up days later the court dropped the charges but not
[09:49.080 --> 09:53.640]  before he went to jail and even if an idiot's calling cops names from their
[09:53.640 --> 09:59.360]  own yard ignore it somebody flips me off in traffic or something I just look
[09:59.360 --> 10:03.680]  forward and ignore it I mean you know you signed on for this job and you
[10:03.680 --> 10:07.120]  shouldn't abuse your authority is to show somebody who the boss is and you
[10:07.120 --> 10:12.200]  shouldn't be doing a TSA style grope this stuff's being proliferating out
[10:12.200 --> 10:17.080]  everywhere so I want to get to that video later if we can the lady arrested in
[10:17.080 --> 10:21.200]  Arizona town during the three-minute speech that she was signed up for and
[10:21.200 --> 10:25.280]  citizens communications the mayor ordered police to get their hands off of
[10:25.280 --> 10:31.040]  her she's being very polite but she was covering corruption in the city and in
[10:31.040 --> 10:36.120]  the police department and the police said no she will not speak about this
[10:36.120 --> 10:40.240]  and arrested her and the mayor said I am your boss do not do this and the cop
[10:40.240 --> 10:45.920]  said I mean this is incredible footage incredible and obviously spent out for a
[10:45.920 --> 10:49.800]  few days we posted it at what on Tuesday that info wars.com and
[10:49.800 --> 10:54.320]  principle.com Ms. Jones got arrested is going to be joining us coming up on
[10:54.320 --> 10:59.040]  about an hour and a half from now Larry Pratt head of governors of America on the
[10:59.040 --> 11:03.120]  whole fast and furious gun-running case where holders now have been caught
[11:03.120 --> 11:07.360]  perjuring himself to Congress the attorney general the ATF had turning
[11:07.360 --> 11:13.120]  against him saying he was ordered to do this and that the attorney general knew
[11:13.120 --> 11:19.760]  all about it that is all coming up today and of course our weekly visit with Bob
[11:19.760 --> 11:25.000]  Chapman and they also executed the Mexican national who was convicted of
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.520]  raping and killing a 16-year-old and I say good for Texas regardless of what
[11:29.520 --> 11:35.800]  you think of the death penalty the feds do not have any right or jurisdiction to
[11:35.800 --> 11:40.000]  tell a state what they can do with their courts and this guy was a child killer
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.620]  and now he's dead all right continuing we've now got a big big development as
[11:47.620 --> 11:54.200]  well a whole bunch of firearms were found connected to the ATF shipment of
[11:54.200 --> 12:00.000]  guns into Mexico 43 weapons at Phoenix traffic stop link to holders gun-running
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.400]  scandal I mean this is getting big and getting big fast so we're going to be
[12:04.400 --> 12:08.880]  going over that as well US government openly admits arming Mexican drug gangs
[12:08.880 --> 12:15.200]  with 30,000 firearms but why Mike Adams breaks down that in a big report with the
[12:15.200 --> 12:19.480]  rest of the story how this is a false flag attack against the Second Amendment
[12:19.480 --> 12:26.680]  so that is all coming up now now that said I became aware of this on the 4th
[12:26.680 --> 12:36.360]  of July and then on Tuesday morning it became a national news story and you
[12:36.360 --> 12:39.960]  heard about the kids living in shed taken into custody and actually what it
[12:39.960 --> 12:47.360]  was was a retrofitted large 12 by 25 foot shed a lot of families live in
[12:47.360 --> 12:51.960]  tents around this country now ladies and gentlemen and I didn't jump the gun on
[12:51.960 --> 12:57.800]  this I did a lot of research into the family into the Lennards and they are
[12:57.800 --> 13:01.320]  Christians they are homeschooling you can look at photos and videos of their
[13:01.320 --> 13:06.120]  children sparkly eyes healthy they don't have that zombie riddle and look the
[13:06.120 --> 13:10.880]  most kids they're Christian people he was a welder he lost his job three years
[13:10.880 --> 13:15.960]  ago and couldn't get credit for a house the only job he could get was running a
[13:15.960 --> 13:22.240]  boat and storage shed an RV park facility so it's an RV park that's what
[13:22.240 --> 13:26.120]  folks didn't look down a lot of them are old-timers staying the RV park they
[13:26.120 --> 13:30.520]  remember growing up when they were going to log cabin on dirt floors so he's the
[13:30.520 --> 13:33.360]  maintenance man there and he retrofitted it with air conditioners and
[13:33.360 --> 13:37.960]  computers and electricity and they've got community bathrooms there and he'd
[13:37.960 --> 13:40.640]  been saving his money up for almost three years they were actually getting
[13:40.640 --> 13:45.760]  ready to get a home and the CPS came and they didn't have any help for this
[13:45.760 --> 13:51.000]  family a family didn't want welfare and CPS is trained I have their textbooks
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.040]  even the University of Texas has for social workers we've posted this on the
[13:55.040 --> 13:57.520]  prison-blinded forum years ago people don't ever believe this stuff where they
[13:57.520 --> 14:02.240]  say the family is archaic needs to be eradicated that the state is going to run
[14:02.240 --> 14:07.240]  everything and already Germany's trying to pass laws to do this the family
[14:07.240 --> 14:11.480]  courts were set up 1910 or so in the US about 1900 England where it all started
[14:11.480 --> 14:17.320]  for racial hygiene Germany didn't adopt this till 33 when Hitler got in it
[14:17.320 --> 14:21.640]  wasn't widespread till 35 they had eugenics courts for sterilization the
[14:21.640 --> 14:25.720]  taking of single mother's children especially ones that Hitler wanted for
[14:25.720 --> 14:29.000]  the military blonde-haired blue-eyed single parent boom your kids are gone if
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.360]  you were another group they didn't like they would just kill you and when they
[14:34.360 --> 14:40.000]  six kids is a prize for CPS if you didn't know this over 70% you can pull
[14:40.000 --> 14:46.640]  these numbers up or just type Dinecore running CPS operations a little over
[14:46.640 --> 14:52.640]  70% of CPS are actual private contractors just like contractors in
[14:52.640 --> 14:58.360]  Afghanistan or Iraq private contractors and going around grabbing kids and they
[14:58.360 --> 15:03.840]  actually get bonuses off of how many children they get and off six children
[15:03.840 --> 15:06.640]  you're looking at several hundred thousand dollars that they're going to
[15:06.640 --> 15:10.560]  get in a year off them a federal and state money and expand their operations
[15:10.560 --> 15:14.800]  then big campaign contributions are given by the big orphanages and the
[15:14.800 --> 15:18.920]  places that place the children with foster parents and I've seen cases of
[15:18.920 --> 15:21.800]  some of these people that run these these rackets in Austin some of the
[15:21.800 --> 15:26.560]  directors making three four million dollars a year individually in Austin in
[15:26.560 --> 15:31.200]  Dallas in cases we've covered they then fence out the quote better kids to
[15:31.200 --> 15:35.120]  through adoption agencies of their smaller with the older ones they grab
[15:35.120 --> 15:41.320]  and these children are ages what 12 to 2 they will hop them up because
[15:41.320 --> 15:44.560]  statistically a lot of Christian families do want black children but
[15:44.560 --> 15:48.320]  they're not in as much demand and then they got the black ribs a lot of times
[15:48.320 --> 15:51.920]  funded by the government lobbying the whites not be able to save these black
[15:51.920 --> 15:55.200]  children because there are Christian white folks particularly that will adopt
[15:55.200 --> 16:00.040]  black kids in mass try to save them and they have big black groups fighting
[16:00.040 --> 16:04.960]  against whites adopting blacks it's funny the NAACP of the police beat a gang
[16:04.960 --> 16:07.800]  member there's will be a big demonstration in lawsuits but when
[16:07.800 --> 16:11.680]  they're grabbing and hunting black children and when a 52% of blacks are
[16:11.680 --> 16:18.360]  never born in this country and aborted it's not even a news item it's it it's
[16:18.360 --> 16:22.920]  not even discussed but I digress here this is a Christian home schooling
[16:22.920 --> 16:29.720]  family and he's a carpenter and handyman he and welder he retrofitted this as a
[16:29.720 --> 16:34.560]  home I've seen video inside the house little house pretty nice many of our
[16:34.560 --> 16:40.760]  presidents grew up and things a lot you know worse than this and by the way they
[16:40.760 --> 16:44.520]  go through in the articles that CPS takes people from rural areas that have
[16:44.520 --> 16:50.440]  outhouses folks I've got family I mean I've got a lot of family way out in the
[16:50.440 --> 16:57.120]  country who've got nice homes but just until recently had outhouses because
[16:57.120 --> 17:00.920]  you know they're there they're 10 miles from water or they've got a well and a
[17:00.920 --> 17:05.080]  pump on it but sometimes it breaks they got an outhouse as well they CPS is on
[17:05.080 --> 17:08.720]  record in the San Antonio Express news Houston Chronicle saying you got an
[17:08.720 --> 17:11.960]  outhouse your kids are gone you don't have air conditioning your kids are
[17:11.960 --> 17:16.840]  going if you if you store their clothes in boxes you are I mean this is in the
[17:16.840 --> 17:23.720]  news CPS says yes that is abuse now they had in 2000 the cover-to-time magazine
[17:23.720 --> 17:28.520]  the shame of foster care admitting that you're five times more likely to be
[17:28.520 --> 17:32.040]  abused in government custody than with your parents so that this is the most
[17:32.040 --> 17:35.360]  abuse of group and this is where the pedophiles go to get jobs and other
[17:35.360 --> 17:43.440]  things am I saying every one of you said pedophile no once in traffic and once
[17:43.440 --> 17:48.200]  in a grocery store a feminine pot belly pedophile type men fit the archetype
[17:48.200 --> 17:52.360]  but came up and got mad at me in traffic and once in a grocery store and
[17:52.360 --> 17:55.320]  we're like going I hate you and showing their teeth and I said you're a CPS
[17:55.320 --> 17:58.600]  worker and they just complete I wrote my windows and your CPS worker aren't you
[17:58.600 --> 18:02.440]  they just look at them instantly they would go you how do you know because I
[18:02.440 --> 18:10.280]  know I know I know I used to fight CPS back 15 14 years ago and I was just
[18:10.280 --> 18:15.080]  local and it tore my guts out so bad that 10 years ago I had to stop because
[18:15.080 --> 18:18.200]  I would go into these situations I would get the documents I'd try to get them
[18:18.200 --> 18:23.400]  lawyers and I would cry I would lose sleep because I was containing feelings
[18:23.400 --> 18:28.480]  of extreme violence which were natural when you've got predators grabbing
[18:28.480 --> 18:33.160]  children so here's the bottom line they didn't help this family you know if
[18:33.160 --> 18:37.560]  you're illegal aliens with 10 kids that you get everything or if you'll be a
[18:37.560 --> 18:41.080]  black woman or a white woman or Hispanic woman and not have a husband in the
[18:41.080 --> 18:44.000]  house they'll give you all the money you ever wanted and leave you alone that's
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.640]  where they also recruit a lot of their CPS workers I noticed his former welfare
[18:47.640 --> 18:53.720]  people but if you're a black man bucking the trend of 91% of blacks being
[18:53.720 --> 18:57.520]  illegitimate which then triples their chances of prison quadruples their
[18:57.520 --> 19:02.080]  chances of drug abuse if you buck the engineering blacks were only about 45%
[19:02.080 --> 19:06.240]  illegitimate pre 1950 now this is starting to happen to whites as well
[19:06.240 --> 19:10.760]  everybody they start with the blacks first they see as a group that's been
[19:10.760 --> 19:15.080]  targeted and that folks somehow just you know don't think are the same as
[19:15.080 --> 19:18.480]  everybody else so they allow it to be done to them first as a beta test Tony
[19:18.480 --> 19:21.800]  Brown has said what you let be done to black folks don't worry it's coming to
[19:21.800 --> 19:27.600]  your neighborhood and they don't like a black man working hard and building a
[19:27.600 --> 19:31.480]  home for his family they don't like a guy who who doesn't go on welfare they
[19:31.480 --> 19:36.320]  don't like a Christian they don't like a man taking care of his children and
[19:36.320 --> 19:41.200]  raising his boys and his girls so they came and took them now I've talked to
[19:41.200 --> 19:44.320]  the lawyers involved and others even though I've now learned their work
[19:44.320 --> 19:47.920]  groups trying to get them a house CPS wants to keep the kids this is about to
[19:47.920 --> 19:54.880]  be on KHO use about to have them on and if folks are people have already stepped
[19:54.880 --> 19:58.440]  forward I said I was gonna do it folks have stepped forward with the house CPS

[24:24.240 --> 24:31.560]  the federal regulations the quota goes up how many children they grab and again
[24:31.560 --> 24:35.520]  the illegal aliens I think they should be left alone by CPS but they're off
[24:35.520 --> 24:39.420]  limits they build shantytowns all over the place I can take you to Austin to
[24:39.420 --> 24:45.000]  some right now they're left alone at golf courses everywhere there are shacks
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.480]  and things on the back 40 were whole families of illegals live but that's
[24:49.480 --> 24:55.480]  okay you get though an Americanized Hispanic or black person white person
[24:55.480 --> 24:59.440]  whatever the case may be and you try to have an air conditioned metal housing
[24:59.440 --> 25:08.520]  there at a RV slash boat storage park with storage facilities he builds a
[25:08.520 --> 25:13.200]  little house while he's saving money being the maintenance man there after
[25:13.200 --> 25:16.640]  losing his job that was better paid as a welder three years ago and losing his
[25:16.640 --> 25:21.700]  home in this depression and they come for you the Great Depression there were
[25:21.700 --> 25:26.600]  tens of millions of homeless people living in tents living out of cars did the
[25:26.600 --> 25:31.520]  government come and and and and spend three four times the money to grab the
[25:31.520 --> 25:37.880]  children to house the children then it would cost to just help the people know
[25:37.880 --> 25:41.600]  the government didn't take their children and the government didn't help the
[25:41.600 --> 25:50.160]  people didn't do either but in this case it's private CPS with contracts with
[25:50.160 --> 25:58.040]  these fraudulent family courts and they come in all I see this all the time cases
[25:58.040 --> 26:04.240]  I see it every few months it's almost always you know young middle-class the
[26:04.240 --> 26:10.520]  the archetype MO is kind of quasi well-educated young 20-year-old hippie
[26:10.520 --> 26:16.680]  couples who will buy an RV and the dad will work in town an odd job but they
[26:16.680 --> 26:20.880]  live out of an RV park in an RV and pump it out you know once a week and
[26:20.880 --> 26:24.760]  whatever and the kids are really healthy and happy and the CPS comes and takes
[26:24.760 --> 26:29.600]  them and says because you're living in an RV park or because you're vegetarian
[26:29.600 --> 26:34.000]  or because it just goes on and on and on so that's that type double let me tell
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.360]  you you got white kids and you're living in an RV your kids are gone because
[26:38.360 --> 26:43.720]  they're gonna get 300 to half a million dollars 300,000 to half a mil on those
[26:43.720 --> 26:49.840]  children in the open market because rich people will pay a lot of money for a
[26:49.840 --> 26:56.320]  white kid most of the white people I see have got kidnapped Hispanic kids or
[26:56.320 --> 27:00.520]  black kids because it's so hard to get a white kid and I see it everywhere and
[27:00.520 --> 27:05.360]  the parents of course are totally unaware of where their children came from
[27:05.360 --> 27:10.800]  they have no idea what a racket in the business this is now the bad news is a
[27:10.800 --> 27:16.520]  lot of folks for whatever reason one of the most hard to adopt groups is black
[27:16.520 --> 27:21.480]  children they get where and why are they valuable well the Dinecore groups and
[27:21.480 --> 27:25.040]  others first get them that's who runs these things subsidiaries Dinecore and
[27:25.040 --> 27:30.960]  others they get the children and they make a lot of money out of them but then
[27:30.960 --> 27:34.680]  once they have their psychologist say the child screaming and crying for their
[27:34.680 --> 27:38.160]  parents that's mental illness you go on Ritalin then they get more depressed and
[27:38.160 --> 27:42.880]  they go on Prozac and on average I've shown the state hearings here it's the
[27:42.880 --> 27:48.160]  same nationwide average 68% of foster children nationwide again that's the
[27:48.160 --> 27:51.520]  state average in Texas you can Google it headline more than two-thirds of Texas
[27:51.520 --> 27:56.760]  foster children on on more than seven drugs and they take them then the
[27:56.760 --> 27:59.920]  children after five six drugs start having seizures then they put them on
[27:59.920 --> 28:04.840]  anti-seizure medication by the time they're 20 they are mind-blown zombies
[28:04.840 --> 28:09.160]  and they throw them out and I've seen studies done I've gone and talked to
[28:09.160 --> 28:12.920]  me see a lot of these old homeless people who aren't even drunks a lot of
[28:12.920 --> 28:16.600]  them are black and they'll be 30 40 years old look like they're 60 all on
[28:16.600 --> 28:19.000]  the side of the corners talking themselves if you go talk to them they'll
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.600]  say you're talking to me I'll say tell me your story well when I was nine in
[28:23.600 --> 28:28.840]  Mississippi they took me from my mama and my daddy we live back in the swamp
[28:28.840 --> 28:35.080]  and then they you're not gonna take me you're not gonna take me they gave me the drugs and they
[28:35.080 --> 28:41.760]  shocked me didn't ever saw my mama again they told my mama and sterilized her I
[28:41.760 --> 28:46.200]  mean I mean go talk to them go go find out who these humans are and he's six
[28:46.200 --> 28:51.000]  children they're gonna slow murder their minds as well they can't wait to kill
[28:51.000 --> 28:59.960]  them just like they did to Hemingway and I am not gonna sit here and put up with
[28:59.960 --> 29:06.520]  it anymore they will take them and they will get 40 50 60 70 80 a hundred
[29:06.520 --> 29:12.440]  thousand that's why they put them on average seven drugs 68% and then there
[29:12.440 --> 29:16.480]  was testimony it's in my film in game the text to the legislature and Susanna
[29:16.480 --> 29:21.200]  Hupp the good representative and others are saying why are 68% on an average of
[29:21.200 --> 29:28.560]  seven drugs he goes they come from bad gene pools they're subhuman they deserve
[29:28.560 --> 29:34.920]  it and that's what they do they grab the black and Hispanic children and there's
[29:34.920 --> 29:39.040]  are happy and there's doctors in the W.O.A.I. TVP said a few years ago admitting
[29:39.040 --> 29:42.840]  that they work who blow the whistle they say they take healthy happy kids in two
[29:42.840 --> 29:47.680]  years later some cases they're dead they kill them they put them on so many
[29:47.680 --> 29:55.280]  drugs to get the money we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones

[32:59.080 --> 33:14.520]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. we're here live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[33:14.520 --> 33:19.280]  thank you for joining us okay let me finish up with this whole case and as
[33:19.280 --> 33:24.600]  things develop will continue to report on it I put out a video this morning at
[33:24.600 --> 33:29.920]  the Alex Jones channel on YouTube uploaded for my iPhone 4 you know
[33:29.920 --> 33:34.240]  directly there basically in live time alert help save six kidnapped children
[33:34.240 --> 33:38.360]  now we've now talked to some of the lawyers involved we've talked to some
[33:38.360 --> 33:44.640]  of the reporters involved at KHOU my wife spent on the phone all morning and
[33:44.640 --> 33:48.360]  reportedly they're getting ready to interview the Leonard family that had
[33:48.360 --> 33:55.960]  their six children taken away for being poor and living in a retrofitted metal
[33:55.960 --> 34:00.440]  building with with with air conditioning and and power and computers and
[34:00.440 --> 34:04.000]  everything I mean is it a crime to not have air conditioner yes CPS is in the
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.120]  news saying we'll even take it for that so I guess everybody pre 1950s and the
[34:08.120 --> 34:11.360]  advent of the popularization of air conditioning would have your children
[34:11.360 --> 34:17.440]  taken and I was intending to go down there and I'm still thinking about it
[34:17.440 --> 34:21.880]  because a KHOU is set to report we're told that someone has stepped forward
[34:21.880 --> 34:25.680]  with a house for them and I was just going to give them money and then call
[34:25.680 --> 34:29.280]  for listeners to show them some houses that they would rent them at a good
[34:29.280 --> 34:33.920]  price and then I would you know pay for six months or something I think ten
[34:33.920 --> 34:37.320]  thousand dollars actually would for a half decent house probably pay for a year
[34:37.320 --> 34:42.320]  down in Houston but wasn't too fancy of an area or close to it but but but see
[34:42.320 --> 34:46.560]  that doesn't mean CPS would even let them go they claim you're neglectful
[34:46.560 --> 34:50.000]  because you would live with your children and you've got six children they
[34:50.000 --> 34:57.040]  say that's too many they have a whole eugenics angle they went on to say well
[34:57.040 --> 35:01.760]  the point is is that we have to call their Trump well we have to call their
[35:01.760 --> 35:08.360]  their their their scam and and and and we have to trump them with getting this
[35:08.360 --> 35:11.560]  family the help they need and people say well there's a million families this is
[35:11.560 --> 35:15.960]  happening to well the point is is that you point out this is wrong you don't
[35:15.960 --> 35:20.560]  just lackadaisically act like it's no big deal I called lawyers this morning
[35:20.560 --> 35:25.600]  trying to get find out where they lived that I'd see in the news I called TV
[35:25.600 --> 35:32.760]  stations radio stations KHOU and others finally helped they act like humans the
[35:32.760 --> 35:35.800]  Chronicle had articles they published saying it was wrong what happened so I'm
[35:35.800 --> 35:39.600]  not just bashing the Houston Chronicle here but I I got on the phone with one
[35:39.600 --> 35:43.920]  guy and and my wife is being very polite and then I got on the phone cuz the guy
[35:43.920 --> 35:47.920]  wasn't helping and I said listen he goes I'm not helping another news agency and
[35:47.920 --> 35:55.080]  I said sir I normally this was a media thing I had my producer call you I said
[35:55.080 --> 35:58.640]  I said I'm calling you you can Google Alex Jones he goes I know I know and I
[35:58.640 --> 36:02.520]  think we're saying he knew who I was and I said I built a veteran a new house
[36:02.520 --> 36:07.000]  built a Memorial Church you know I I like to you know have examples of you
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.600]  of coming people's aid to get other people to have the same attitude and to
[36:11.600 --> 36:16.040]  point out what's happening me things pull on my heartstrings I said please you
[36:16.040 --> 36:22.280]  know where this is just just just tell us where it is it's not the report and
[36:22.280 --> 36:26.360]  he said no you can try to talk to the reporter later if you want it made me
[36:26.360 --> 36:30.520]  very very angry and the guy was pretty much laughing at me it was very I guess
[36:30.520 --> 36:34.920]  people probably don't even believe there are folks that care like it's bad to even
[36:34.920 --> 36:40.000]  care it's bad to think CPS grabbing kids for no reason is wrong it's bad to not
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.160]  want TSA to stick their hands down your pants it's bad to not want the
[36:43.160 --> 36:48.720]  president to launch new wars without congressional approval it's bad and I
[36:48.720 --> 36:54.240]  run into so many people that have this attitude but the Houston Chronicle did
[36:54.240 --> 36:59.520]  run a report that was very fair and so did the awesome American statesman
[36:59.520 --> 37:05.040]  San Antonio Express News but they don't care of 90% of the articles are
[37:05.040 --> 37:09.720]  against what TSA is doing TSA just goes forward they don't care CPS
[37:09.720 --> 37:13.920]  I mean they're mercenaries they're gonna get money off these children because
[37:13.920 --> 37:18.840]  they're not agencies there to help you they're there to take your children if
[37:18.840 --> 37:24.000]  you want to say you can be on welfare can't have a man in the house you live
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.400]  in crack infested neighborhoods and then go into juvenile when you're young and
[37:28.400 --> 37:34.040]  learn how to be a criminal so the inner cities can become engines of crime wave
[37:34.040 --> 37:38.720]  after crime wave and riots and racial tension that's all wonderful that's what
[37:38.720 --> 37:43.400]  the system wants they don't like with only nine percent of blacks being quote
[37:43.400 --> 37:47.840]  legitimate coming from a you know married couple the non-broken homes they
[37:47.840 --> 37:54.440]  don't they don't like that 9% they target them and what 50 years ago 90 plus
[37:54.440 --> 37:59.240]  percent of whites were legitimate now over 50 percent are illegitimate same
[37:59.240 --> 38:03.800]  stuff that happened to blacks social degenerations now happening blacks were
[38:03.800 --> 38:12.360]  less than 50% illegitimate but pre-1950 now 91% and I mean it just
[38:12.360 --> 38:16.640]  civilization is collapsing because they'll give you that welfare keep that
[38:16.640 --> 38:20.120]  man out of the house put your kids in the inner city schools do this but oh
[38:20.120 --> 38:23.840]  you're a black man that lost his job three years ago and took his lower job
[38:23.840 --> 38:27.560]  and built and retrofitted at the place that you manage as a maintenance man
[38:27.560 --> 38:32.120]  you've been saving money for a house how we built this country and you homeschool
[38:32.120 --> 38:37.080]  your children I've seen video and photos great-looking happy you can see
[38:37.080 --> 38:40.920]  electric Christian children those who love to bash Christians you ever really
[38:40.920 --> 38:45.360]  known real Christians poor people go to neighborhoods where it's people are
[38:45.360 --> 38:50.000]  really poor and the Christians yards are straight they're hard-working that they
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.800]  have loving eyes they're good people they're happy they appreciate life and
[38:53.800 --> 38:58.920]  right next to them you'll have burnout motorcycles and cars on blocks and
[38:58.920 --> 39:03.000]  people beating their kids and hell on earth and they're all on welfare and
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.080]  right next door you got the poor Christians who aren't on welfare and
[39:06.080 --> 39:10.320]  the CPS is at their house every month trying to take their kids they're
[39:10.320 --> 39:14.520]  targeting these people they're targeting homeschoolers even wealthy
[39:14.520 --> 39:19.800]  homeschoolers taking them away in California Michigan busting down doors
[39:19.800 --> 39:23.840]  demanding to be let in to see the curriculum doesn't matter the homeschoolers
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.200]  are winning all the big spelling bees and geography bees the system wants to
[39:27.200 --> 39:31.480]  shut it down they don't want people to flee outside their system and as the
[39:31.480 --> 39:35.400]  economy implodes are they going to take more and more children I sent Rob do we
[39:35.400 --> 39:39.080]  have footage of this we did reports was it now two years ago Rob I sent them to
[39:39.080 --> 39:43.040]  the tent cities in Sacramento in Los Angeles where there are families living
[39:43.040 --> 39:46.800]  out there now they've made them all move off that same thing in Hawaii and they
[39:46.800 --> 39:50.640]  lock them up at night at the sports stadium at facilities and if you've got
[39:50.640 --> 39:57.120]  kids they take them they these aren't drunks and drug addicts in fact a lot
[39:57.120 --> 40:00.960]  of these people I was at the Capitol a few weeks ago I came out and this you
[40:00.960 --> 40:04.800]  could tell he was special forces this big like six foot four black guy was
[40:04.800 --> 40:11.440]  riding on a bicycle with a headset on and he he pulled over and he said oh Alex
[40:11.440 --> 40:14.880]  Jones I just love you I heard you were here that's why I came down here and he
[40:14.880 --> 40:18.120]  has a little ear he goes I listen to you all the time he goes I was you know eight
[40:18.120 --> 40:23.320]  years you know special forces Green Beret you could tell talking to guy he was
[40:23.320 --> 40:27.840]  you know scary and you tell this is a tough guy and he was like he's like you
[40:27.840 --> 40:30.720]  know that got out they won't give me anything and I'm homeless I've been
[40:30.720 --> 40:34.480]  saving money for two years to try to get out of this but I but and he was all
[40:34.480 --> 40:36.960]  clean to you could tell you've been living on the street for two years trying
[40:36.960 --> 40:40.720]  to save money he's like the police are asking when I'm out here homeless he's
[40:40.720 --> 40:45.040]  probably listening right now this is where our soldiers are this is what
[40:45.040 --> 40:48.440]  they've turned I mean you know I mean he was like I was in the I was in this
[40:48.440 --> 40:52.920]  country I was in I was in Columbia I was in Desert Storm I was in all these
[40:52.920 --> 40:56.560]  wars and you're right as soon as I got out of there that the they had nothing
[40:56.560 --> 41:01.920]  I just it just he just went on and on and on and on and I was sitting there
[41:01.920 --> 41:06.840]  talking to this guy who looked like a really high quality person and you know
[41:06.840 --> 41:12.280]  if he had kids would they take his kids this is outrageous so I wanted to go
[41:12.280 --> 41:19.320]  ahead and play with the original KHOU report with the family here and then
[41:19.320 --> 41:21.920]  later today they're reportedly going to interview the family and folks are trying
[41:21.920 --> 41:25.720]  now off to my house and money but that doesn't mean the CPS aren't gonna try to
[41:25.720 --> 41:28.440]  keep them that's they're gonna try to keep those kids because they're
[41:28.440 --> 41:31.920]  mercenaries and you're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
[41:31.920 --> 41:37.280]  on six kids and they will drug them 68% of the time and they'll put them on
[41:37.280 --> 41:41.520]  average seven drugs they will they will they will destroy these children's
[41:41.520 --> 41:45.880]  minds because again by listing a misspe and it's on record if you cry for your
[41:45.880 --> 41:51.360]  mother and father you are drugged immediately that is mental illness it is
[41:51.360 --> 41:55.480]  abnormal to throw fits or demand to have your parents can you imagine my I've
[41:55.480 --> 41:59.680]  got an eight-year-old a seven-year-old and a three-year-old and they don't like
[41:59.680 --> 42:03.560]  it when we have a part-time nanny come over you know they're great people they
[42:03.560 --> 42:07.360]  want to be with us or my or even relatives come over to keep them
[42:07.360 --> 42:12.000]  sometimes they really love us they really want to be with us I can't imagine
[42:12.000 --> 42:18.320]  the pain this family and because I have empathy for them I'm the bad guy even
[42:18.320 --> 42:21.000]  see on the YouTube channel some folks going good they need to be taken they're
[42:21.000 --> 42:26.320]  living in a in a you know you know in a storage shed the way the media spun that
[42:26.320 --> 42:30.920]  I mean it doesn't matter the point is that he retrofitted it had air
[42:30.920 --> 42:35.680]  conditioning it had that refrigerator had power you know there in it probably
[42:35.680 --> 42:39.200]  sounds like a fun place to live you know there were people living in their RVs and
[42:39.200 --> 42:42.280]  they got storage sheds and people storing their boats there and he's the
[42:42.280 --> 42:45.840]  maintenance man I mean I got to tell you folks just like in the movie catty
[42:45.840 --> 42:52.120]  shack the maintenance man lives at the greenhouse I grew up in Dallas on a you
[42:52.120 --> 42:57.320]  know me medium-tier golf course nothing fancy the neighborhood and there was a
[42:57.320 --> 43:00.720]  big sprawling complex back in the woods back in the area where the maintenance
[43:00.720 --> 43:04.600]  people were in a couple of them live there they were pretty much illegal
[43:04.600 --> 43:08.360]  aliens and I remember getting to know them and some of their kids back one of
[43:08.360 --> 43:12.800]  them name was Mario and he had a son for the first year he was there who the
[43:12.800 --> 43:17.160]  family lived there and I'd play soccer with his son and stuff then later he
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.640]  ended up starting his own lawn company and became wealthy and I remember going
[43:21.640 --> 43:24.440]  over to their house and you know decade later in high school when they lived in
[43:24.440 --> 43:28.800]  a house bigger than we had and but you know the American dream the point is
[43:28.800 --> 43:36.640]  you're gonna take take Mario's son what was his name said Julio the point is is
[43:36.640 --> 43:41.120]  that is this is what America is how do you think our immigrant ancestors that
[43:41.120 --> 43:45.640]  came here lived how do you think of 35 million people in Mexico City half of
[43:45.640 --> 43:50.480]  them live in cardboard boxes you can take all their kids it's not sure and
[43:50.480 --> 43:55.280]  this guy was working this guy was working and they took them and and the
[43:55.280 --> 43:59.040]  point is they didn't help them that the government will put you on welfare and
[43:59.040 --> 44:03.320]  put you in a section 8 housing but they won't come to you and say well you need
[44:03.320 --> 44:08.200]  help we're gonna help you get a house now and how many people are having their
[44:08.200 --> 44:11.120]  houses taken how many people are having to move in with their parents or moving
[44:11.120 --> 44:14.640]  with their brothers and sisters all right let's go ahead and go to this clip
[44:14.640 --> 44:20.880]  here it is thought their home was safe but the state disagreed now a mother and
[44:20.880 --> 44:24.240]  father are fighting to get their children back HOU 11 who's a part of
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.760]  russow found out what led them to seek shelter in a storage shed and why they
[44:28.760 --> 44:35.400]  believe the state is out of line at first glance Princeton Charlemagne Leonard
[44:35.400 --> 44:41.240]  seemed to be pulling into a driveway with an ordinary home on the other end but
[44:41.240 --> 44:45.760]  look again it has a freezer section we keep the frozen vegetables and meat or
[44:45.760 --> 44:50.040]  like shoes under the shelving a secondary computer this is home this is
[44:50.040 --> 44:55.720]  home turns out home for the lennards and their six children is a 12 foot wide 25
[44:55.720 --> 45:00.200]  foot long northeast Houston storage shed but you have to make the best of what
[45:00.200 --> 45:04.800]  you have they moved in three years ago after the father an unemployed welder
[45:04.800 --> 45:09.280]  got hired here as a maintenance worker they couldn't afford an apartment and
[45:09.280 --> 45:12.920]  the homeless shelter didn't seem safe enough and I say for you you know you
[45:12.920 --> 45:17.360]  just get secure let our kids go out and play hard times led the linards to this
[45:17.360 --> 45:22.320]  storage facility but it was a passerby's observation that led to a fight with the
[45:22.320 --> 45:26.880]  state over the custody of their channel to someone told child protective
[45:26.880 --> 45:30.680]  services that there appeared to be unattended children on the property a
[45:30.680 --> 45:35.160]  caseworker investigated and the state took custody of the kids we didn't do
[45:35.160 --> 45:39.200]  anything wrong we're doing the best that we can file children a CPS spokesperson
[45:39.200 --> 45:43.040]  says the children were removed because the storage shed is a dangerous
[45:43.040 --> 45:47.600]  environment a local activist is fighting to reunite the family you don't take
[45:47.600 --> 45:51.080]  people's children and snatched them away from families and separate children
[45:51.080 --> 45:54.960]  strictly because their parents support and fall no hard times I want my
[45:54.960 --> 46:01.280]  children back with me where they belong in a home that's far from ordinary in
[46:01.280 --> 46:10.200]  northeast Houston rucks Russell KHOU 11 news if now it's a big metal a peaked
[46:10.200 --> 46:15.440]  roof fence all the way around it giant facility people see kids running around
[46:15.440 --> 46:20.360]  so they call and the state comes why don't you call on Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[46:20.360 --> 46:24.400]  Morgan imploding the economy by design why don't you call for Obama to be in
[46:24.400 --> 46:27.840]  peach for launching illegal wars why don't you go after the real issues
[46:27.840 --> 46:35.040]  instead of six children but one girl five boys running around behind a fence
[46:35.040 --> 46:39.760]  and I can't tell you how many hundreds of cases I've seen in 16 years in even
[46:39.760 --> 46:46.080]  wealthy areas where people see children playing behind a cyclone fence in their
[46:46.080 --> 46:50.240]  own yard and the CPS comes saying the mothers like I was watching them out the
[46:50.240 --> 46:54.080]  window they're in the backyard sorry I could tell you how many wealthy people
[46:54.080 --> 46:59.280]  are even at school and fall off America around and break their finger or their
[46:59.280 --> 47:04.320]  arm and the CPS goes ahead and comes and tries to take them and then three days
[47:04.320 --> 47:07.400]  later in court they have to bring in the school admitting it even happened there
[47:07.400 --> 47:11.160]  your child falls off the swing at the park they're gonna try to take your
[47:11.160 --> 47:18.320]  children okay this is what America has become and these aren't real courts now
[47:18.320 --> 47:21.920]  I want to give you if we can back it up you can actually see on the sign the
[47:21.920 --> 47:28.880]  name of the facility about a minute into that video you can see it looks like
[47:28.880 --> 47:35.720]  oats RV but we've tried to find that that that that number on line and yeah
[47:35.720 --> 47:41.080]  boat RV it was the name of the storage facility and he's the maintenance man
[47:41.080 --> 47:44.280]  and he lives there in air conditioning in a big metal building and it's a big
[47:44.280 --> 47:49.240]  giant building he's only got one part of it and it's at the 12 the 12,000 block
[47:49.240 --> 47:59.000]  of McNair MC in a IR and boat RV is is is the sign on the facility the 12,000
[47:59.000 --> 48:06.760]  block of McNair and you can put that in McNair 12,000 block of McNair it's at
[48:06.760 --> 48:12.920]  the end of the road on Google Maps and there it is I mean it is a big park land
[48:12.920 --> 48:20.040]  all around it it looks like a semi rural area actually it looks like a lower
[48:20.040 --> 48:27.000]  middle-class houses across the street and that's it and you you got your kids
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.200]  living in a metal building with air conditioning and computers and everything
[48:30.200 --> 48:33.800]  else they're gonna take them and that's how they operate in America now I know
[48:33.800 --> 48:40.840]  I've spent pretty much most of this first hour on this subject and they don't
[48:40.840 --> 48:44.200]  even tell you that activists is on the newscaster I would get him on it's been
[48:44.200 --> 48:49.680]  really hard and again you call it the Chronicle and you go hey I'm a Torrio
[48:49.680 --> 48:53.200]  talk show host I'd like to give these people some money I'd like to try to
[48:53.200 --> 48:57.960]  help and get a house yes you do you have any contacts for him do you have the
[48:57.960 --> 49:03.320]  number at that for that place's office and they just say I'm not gonna help
[49:03.320 --> 49:08.240]  another news agency like but I'm not a news agency that's what I told talkers
[49:08.240 --> 49:14.040]  magazine a month ago I said I'm not in an industry I'm I'm on a mission like the
[49:14.040 --> 49:19.320]  blues brothers say we're on a mission from God I mean I'm on a mission at the
[49:19.320 --> 49:23.360]  end of the day we raise money and capital to expand our overall operation but
[49:23.360 --> 49:27.800]  KHOU and others have not acted like that when we've called them and maybe I just
[49:27.800 --> 49:31.280]  got the wrong person on the phone at the Chronicle at their news desk but I
[49:31.280 --> 49:35.200]  don't like being laughed at and just complete arrogance because I guess they
[49:35.200 --> 49:41.440]  didn't believe I was like I really want to help these people and I mean there's
[49:41.440 --> 49:44.960]  hundreds of cases of this every week without even looking I mean it's just
[49:44.960 --> 49:48.640]  it's endless I even try to stay away from this because it freaks me out too much
[49:48.640 --> 49:54.600]  it's just it's so fundamentally evil that this is going on and that we have a
[49:54.600 --> 49:57.400]  new video of a guy being arrested in his front yard he's all the way back in his
[49:57.400 --> 50:04.000]  garage filming cops searching a woman TSA style her breast and everything now
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.280]  they just pull you over put you in handcuffs before they conduct a search
[50:07.280 --> 50:11.200]  without probable cause and then he calls them Nazis and it is a Nazi style
[50:11.200 --> 50:14.240]  tactic and they come over and they said we're gonna get you for two taller grass
[50:14.240 --> 50:17.560]  looks like it's about three inches tall and they say we're gonna get you for
[50:17.560 --> 50:21.560]  disorderly conduct he says get off my property I'm leaving they said no they
[50:21.560 --> 50:24.920]  come into his garage I said we're gonna charge you for a racial slur talking
[50:24.920 --> 50:28.920]  bad about Nazis folks the video is on him full wars.com I know that sounds
[50:28.920 --> 50:33.440]  insane but they really do you're not allowed to talk about about Nazis now
[50:33.440 --> 50:37.200]  but again there's not even laws against racial slurs in this country this is the
[50:37.200 --> 50:42.720]  political correctness that now you can't call people Nazis that are engaging in
[50:42.720 --> 50:46.160]  type of police activities the Third Reich did of course the Third Reich had
[50:46.160 --> 50:50.760]  good reasons for what they were doing according to them as well all right we've
[50:50.760 --> 50:55.280]  got a bunch of other news coming up here but I'm probably gonna have to go to
[50:55.280 --> 50:58.200]  Houston try to help these people I mean somebody's got to do it we'll get right

[54:22.960 --> 54:28.560]  helped them go in conclusion I just want to point out that we see all these
[54:28.560 --> 54:37.560]  archetypal movies and books and in actual historical cases of groups coming
[54:37.560 --> 54:40.960]  in the night and grabbing your children and running away with them and and you
[54:40.960 --> 54:45.360]  think of that as the ultimate evil but then these private contractors with
[54:45.360 --> 54:50.040]  quasi-government power under race hygiene eugenics courts that's what family
[54:50.040 --> 54:53.400]  courts are that's how they were set up didn't happen until about a hundred
[54:53.400 --> 54:58.760]  years ago that little over a hundred years ago now 1910 or so and they just
[54:58.760 --> 55:02.640]  do whatever they want they've set up all over the western world and then they
[55:02.640 --> 55:08.000]  build a society a technological system then they make it impossible for a lot
[55:08.000 --> 55:11.200]  of people to pay for everything you're supposed to have then they come and take
[55:11.200 --> 55:16.920]  your children and even the Houston Chronicle says a family law attorney
[55:16.920 --> 55:21.840]  Julia Ketterman has worked countless cases in which shall protect services
[55:21.840 --> 55:26.800]  took children away from parents for reasons that range from family using an
[55:26.800 --> 55:30.400]  outhouse instead of an indoor plumbing to keeping clothes and boxes instead of
[55:30.400 --> 55:34.560]  dressers Ketterman said CPS caseworkers deemed those instances as unsafe and
[55:34.560 --> 55:38.240]  cramped living conditions which is grounds for removal by the agency
[55:38.240 --> 55:43.320]  standards while the government bankrupts everybody but to me they're being
[55:43.320 --> 55:48.480]  picked up because they are poor she said legally CPS cannot cite poverty as a
[55:48.480 --> 55:53.280]  reason to remove children from parental custody but they do it absolutely all the
[55:53.280 --> 55:58.200]  times that Ketterman who has worked as a defense attorney in CPS cases in Houston
[55:58.200 --> 56:02.160]  for more than five years the case of Prince and Charlemagne Leonard and their
[56:02.160 --> 56:06.480]  children is similar to many Ketterman says she's seen and handled last month
[56:06.480 --> 56:10.520]  CPS removed the couple six children was just now getting news attention after
[56:10.520 --> 56:14.600]  agency caseworkers said that the small storage shed in East Houston family was
[56:14.600 --> 56:18.280]  staying and contained unsafe living conditions and then it goes to the 12
[56:18.280 --> 56:24.080]  by 25 foot shed for nearly four years outfitting it with a wood-burning
[56:24.080 --> 56:28.200]  heater AC unit and composite toilet while fetching water from a nearby
[56:28.200 --> 56:37.800]  spigot CPS officials how their officials not not not mercenaries ranging in age
[56:37.800 --> 56:43.000]  from 2 to 12 were not removed because of poverty reasons but CPS spokesman said
[56:43.000 --> 56:48.360]  Thursday would not provide more detailed explanation so there you go and it's
[56:48.360 --> 56:54.560]  all over the news children removed for poverty I was just given a piece of
[56:54.560 --> 57:00.000]  legislation provide for an employee election w-4 form to have amounts
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.400]  deducted with help from wages to be used to produce the public debt Wow this
[57:05.400 --> 57:09.280]  bill just came out they've introduced a new bill this is from thomas.loc.gov
[57:09.280 --> 57:13.840]  Library of Congress they're introducing legislation to try to pay off the
[57:13.840 --> 57:18.520]  national debt for a new direct tax on working-class people yeah I tell you the
[57:18.520 --> 57:22.320]  news is coming in so fast and you know what I like to humanize stuff because
[57:22.320 --> 57:27.040]  this is what I'm feeling this upsets me this this is the bedrock in America that

[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.360]  Alex Jones
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:47.760]  okay folks we're getting a report out on this at info wars.com run the next 30
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:57.440]  minutes or so but we have the bill here at thomas.loc.gov it's HR 2411 and this
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.360]  is how the income tax started in World War two they had it on the books in
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:06.240]  1913 but they said just for the war we're gonna garnish this war tax and this
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:13.960]  new thing gives you a an elective check-off box in your W-4 to to give
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.080]  more money to the government in a way this is kind of cute because Warren
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.880]  Buffett and all these people that claim they want to pay more taxes but really
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:29.040]  they're exempt the way they've had the laws written now now they can be put on
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.960]  the hot seat going quick calling for our taxes to be raised if you want to give
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:37.480]  more give more to provide for an employee election on form W-4 to have
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:43.480]  amounts deducted and withheld wages to use to reduce the public debt which is
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.840]  impossible to pay off because it's a Ponzi scheme designed by the central
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:56.240]  banks to totally bankrupt society but that's a happy independence day absolutely
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:02.960]  incredible we got Larry Pratt joining us with just an absolutely huge story the
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.880]  Attorney General has been accused by the ATF of perjuring himself by the head of
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:14.560]  the ATF in Congress and in other venues saying he knew nothing about ordering
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.920]  the ATF to carry out operation fast and furious that now has confirmed to ship
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:24.200]  30,000 firearms into Mexico to drug gangs to then track them back here and to
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:29.840]  crime in Mexico as a pretext to call for total semi-automatic weapons bans so
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.240]  that's coming up in the next segment you know I see these type of reports all the
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.680]  time does Michelle Obama know about this because she's saying we all need
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.720]  gardens and we need a government tax on salt and fattening things but then she's
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.800]  always in public eating the most fattening things you can imagine who
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:50.360]  blames her it tastes good but it goes on does Michelle Obama know about this
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.960]  their front yard was torn up after replacing a sewer line they put really
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.680]  nice little boxes in fact show me a document cam shot for prison pointed out
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:03.400]  TV viewers so instead of replacing the dirt with grass one Oak Park woman put
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.920]  in a vegetable garden and now the city is seeing green and there's just some
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:12.760]  nice little boxes for tomatoes and peppers and things like that the list
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:19.120]  goes on fresh basil cabbage carrots tomatoes cucumbers and more all filling
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.520]  five large planter boxes that fill the bass family front yard well so you don't
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.960]  really own your land you pay a property tax on it which we didn't have the last
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:33.360]  80 years or so and they tell you what you can do Julie Bass says we thought
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.400]  we're minding our own business doing something not ostentatious and
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.160]  certainly not obnoxious or nothing that is a blight on the neighborhood so we
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.840]  didn't think people would care very much we'll don't worry a title till
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:48.000]  that'll tell no one knows what to do they get money for it but some cared
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.520]  very much and called the city the city then sit on a code enforcement they
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.640]  warned us at first that we had to move the vegetables from the front no
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.280]  vegetables were allowed in the front yard we didn't move them because we didn't
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:02.040]  think we were doing anything wrong even according to city code we didn't think
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.160]  we were doing anything wrong yeah you can plant whatever plant you want your
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.720]  front yard so they ticketed us in charge me where they misdemeanor bass said
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:12.240]  city code says that all unpaved portions of the site shall be planted with grass

[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:15.320]  to have inspections of all gardens because you might grow something illegal

[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:45.280]  well to P. O. Box one nine five four nine Austin Texas seven eight seven six
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:52.000]  zero okay Larry Pratt governors of America is joining us we've been
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.280]  covering this for two years the fact in fact six years ago Celica Stillo DEA
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:04.120]  retired agent said that that the U. S. government was helping ship guns in a
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.800]  Mexico destabilize and even name names and went over where the training was
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:13.360]  happening and they tried to hire him for this then two years ago he came out and
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:18.160]  said Obama has accelerated it they're helping get illegal guns into Mexico to
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:23.600]  blame it on gun shows he that he was on record ATF then rated him charged him
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.600]  for selling two shotguns at a gun show legally and this was a former sniper in
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:36.880]  the army DEA agent retired I mean they sent him to jail for this that's so so
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.600]  we were on this two years ago then Obama's and holders start saying our
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.880]  guns are causing what's happening in Mexico we got to have the assault weapons
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:48.240]  ban again you can only sell one gun at a gun shop you got to report to us even
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.520]  though it's not the law so we knew they were doing this this this this this
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:59.360]  operation blaming the Second Amendment for what's happening in Mexico when they
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.800]  have a total gun ban down there and the cartels about grenade launchers armored
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.720]  vehicles both their weapons are fully auto they got fleets of aircraft all
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.720]  over the world that you know the drug dealers do and so all of this is going
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.720]  on so it didn't make a lot of sense six years ago why would they be shipping the
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.560]  guns in well they wanted to blame the Second Amendment and that's what you get
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.200]  from the ATF but now we know in the last two years this was directly ordered
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:24.120]  according to the ATF by the Attorney General when the ATF director got on the
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.920]  hot seat he now has broken and with the establishment said look I'm not gonna
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.800]  hang for this we were ordered to do this and of course the ATF was they
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:37.560]  wouldn't do this on their own now the new report is US government openly
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:43.040]  admits arming Mexican drug gangs with 30,000 firearms that's at info wars.com
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:48.000]  by Mike Adams from natural news and continuing here and then we're going to
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.520]  our guest the real expert on this Larry Pratt a New York post fast and furious
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.760]  gets hotter for Holder here's another one breaking 43 weapons in Phoenix
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:01.120]  traffic stop linked to Holder's gun-running scandal Fox Nation it's
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.080]  also been linked to police officers death this is a big deal then we got
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.960]  Nixon online to Congress and to investigators we've got Holder who
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.040]  ran the Oklahoma City cover-up that came out in emails as Deputy Attorney
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:19.000]  General for Mr. I mean miss miss Reno sorry and so Larry Pratt the president
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.880]  governors of America non-profit lobbying organization formed in 75 to
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.000]  preserve and defend the Second Amendment the NRA's a sellout group they've
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.760]  proven that they would never talk about about them until recently because it got
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.680]  so obvious good NRA members with the leadership is basically playing possum
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.760]  but without gun owners we would not have a second amendment right now he's a
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:42.080]  former member of the Virginia House of Delegates and it's gunowners.org this
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.000]  is a big deal we've got him for this segment and the next joining us from
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.480]  Virginia outside DC they're gun owners headquarters am I right in saying this
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:55.640]  could bring down the entire Justice Department Obama and once and for all
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:01.320]  really show what who the victim disarmament crowd is. Alex when this
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:06.480]  began the media was ignoring it they're still trying their best to ignore it
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:11.520]  the Democrat media I should say because they're just an adjunct of the Democrat
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:16.680]  Party that's in power and they didn't want to embarrass their guys but it's
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:21.040]  gotten to the point now and it's been covered enough by some of the mainstream
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:27.840]  like Fox and a little bit by CBS that we're beginning to hear even some of
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:33.880]  the politicians talk about these guys need to be put on the stand Alan West
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:39.280]  new representative from South Florida called for an independent prosecutor and
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:42.960]  I think it's probably important that we look at the words that we use I don't
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:47.320]  think it can be an independent prosecutor I believe that would require the
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:52.720]  cooperation of the criminals themselves in the Justice Department but there is
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.960]  a way to get at this the way the representative wants to do it and that's
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:02.160]  an independent counsel put him in the sergeant of arms his office there's
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:09.000]  money for for doing this have his own staff and his own office space and then
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.320]  he's basically in charge of the Capitol Hill police that's actually what the
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:17.960]  sergeant of arms one of his responsibilities I think about 10,000
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.320]  of them and they can arrest within the District of Columbia for any crime that
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:27.440]  was committed in the Capitol well perjury would be one of those crimes and
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:32.760]  Representative Issa the head of the the oversight committee has been talking
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:37.760]  about he uses his words very carefully but he said I don't think Mr. Holder
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:42.320]  was truthful when he testified well and probably the flip side of that is he is a
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:48.000]  liar and this thing is getting to the point where the pot might start to boil
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.920]  because for those that don't know the head of the ATF said no he has perjured
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:57.800]  himself because he knows he's about to get his his head politically chopped off
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.240]  the Mexican government wants to prosecute in Mexico the ATF people that
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.760]  did this remember three months ago they tried to claim the ATF officers that
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.520]  blew the whistle and did their job who are honorable that they were liars we
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.320]  know the head of the ATF told Congress hey I never knew about this now we have
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.240]  his emails now he's in now Holder saying he didn't know the head of the ATF
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:23.160]  saying he did well obviously Holder knew for two years as you know we talked
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:26.960]  about two years ago their strategy is to blame what's happening in on Mexico on
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:31.040]  the second amendment shutting down gun shows running fake stings with the
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.360]  legals this is their whole Justice Department program yeah the code of the
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:42.640]  of ranking minority Elijah Cummins on mr. Isis committee made a valiant attempt
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.520]  at spinning this by saying well this shows that we need more gun control the
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.120]  ATF needs more power that's the that's why they had to resort to this
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.680]  particular program because we haven't given them the tools I think I've
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:59.440]  articulated as best anybody could what he was saying and it doesn't pass the
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:05.000]  laugh test I'm sorry this is hopefully not only a time when we might see some
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.520]  impeachments of the attorney general and one or two of the assistant attorney
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.920]  generals but the dissolution of the agency but that won't do the job if we
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:21.720]  don't extirpate the law itself it's what we have seen is that unconstitutional
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:28.120]  gun law leads to abuses of power such as we're talking about right now and we
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:33.080]  don't get it to go away by transferring the functions to some other department in
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:38.240]  the FBI or other place in the Justice Department not only do we need to get
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:43.520]  rid of this agent to get rid of the agency but the law itself has to be on
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.760]  the block we shouldn't have been regulating guns in Washington it you
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:53.400]  know what what part of shall not be infringed don't they understand well said
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.560]  now for those that just joined us and don't know the whole history of this
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.600]  this is a big deal to have holder being accused by the head of the ATF of
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:04.640]  perjuring himself and that being you know in in major newspapers I mean
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.960]  something has to give on this but the ATF has a history of when they're under
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.120]  political pressure and about to be abolished they go start a new Waco they
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:18.160]  go start a new distraction so that everybody rallies around them the beauty
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:22.560]  of this one is that this one has gotten out of their control and I agree with you
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:27.120]  that that would have been their tendency to try to set up a Waco but now
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.960]  nobody believes them at all and I think the dynamic may have actually shifted I
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:37.400]  didn't think I would ever see something like this now where it's actually going
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:41.400]  to end up that's another matter but you know these guys have already violated
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:46.360]  another law they fired a whistleblower last week Vincent Cefalu who was
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:51.560]  blowing the whistle about the misdeeds of fast and furious though the current
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:57.000]  codename for this and that's that's just amazing that they would do that while all
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:03.400]  this is going on it's if he were not in the public eye that might be one thing
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:11.040]  but the guys have been on television you can see him at Fox News in the William
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:18.400]  Lajanes archive it's just extraordinary what they're willing to do and I think
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:23.720]  that oh we also found out yesterday that the head of the Tampa office for the
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:29.320]  ATF was running guns into Honduras why Honduras well they want to blame us for
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.960]  Honduras too because the gangs in Honduras have been starting to work
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:40.800]  with the Sinaloa cartel out of Mexico and I guess we want our fingerprints on
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:46.240]  that one too incredible incredible we're we're translating this Mexican TV
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.000]  right now that's being reported down there that one of the top law set as
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.160]  people it's been captured is saying they purchased firearms directly from the
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:59.800]  US government including shoulder-fired US rockets and that's what we were told

[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.240]  Joseph Watson, Alex Jones and Kurt Nemo big detailed report at
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:35.960]  prisonplanet.com very important to get that out to everyone with all these
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:39.520]  White House officials saying Obama needs a terror attack that looked like a
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:45.200]  strong leader and continuous takeover of society going back to Larry Pratt I mean
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:50.480]  Larry you're calm about this I'm calm somewhat about it but I don't think I
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:57.000]  have words to describe how big a deal this is that it's actually mainly
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.240]  Rupert Murdoch's outfits reporting on it but it's confirmed I mean I see what
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.560]  the Congress people are saying it's in some other newspapers I just went online
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:08.680]  during the break and I found the Mexican source for what you were talking about
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:16.920]  this guy by the nickname of El Momito one of the leaders of the Flossatis the
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:21.840]  set as yeah has been blabbing I'd seen something yesterday and it didn't have
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:26.480]  the information that you pointed out that the sales were actually in some
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:32.600]  cases being made by the government itself and that's big stuff that is a
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:38.320]  major piece of information that ought to have heads rolling all the way down the
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.360]  line I mean it's one thing when it when an agent who's a good guy is being told
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.720]  to do something that he just knows and his gut isn't right and it breaks the
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:52.000]  law and all kinds of procedures he's ever followed as a cop but when he's
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:57.400]  involved in making the sale itself that's now I we did know that there was a
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:03.520]  paid FBI informant that was doing a lot of these sales and he was this is like
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:08.920]  the Keystone cops to a point that he was being surveilled by the ATF and they
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:14.480]  had no idea that the guy was a flipped drug dealer who was working for the FBI
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:19.520]  to stay out of jail now that may be the way the guns were getting in into
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:23.120]  Mexico I'm not I haven't read enough of the article to know exactly if he gives
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:28.880]  details but yeah that puts their fingerprints even more closely on yeah
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:35.360]  this Mexican TV is reporting that this top founder of Los Zetas basically said
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:38.920]  what Celica Stella told us six years ago and then again two years ago he was a
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:45.480]  former top DEA agent in Latin America that that the US government IEDA people
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:49.400]  had been hired and we're and we're and we're training and giving weapons to
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:55.680]  Los Zetas and here it is on on on on Mexican television so this goes a lot
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:00.240]  lot deeper and we're gonna be getting a report on that out as we're also having
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:05.520]  some of the Spanish checked first at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com in
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:10.560]  the next few hours but you know I tell you Larry I mean this this could be the
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:14.560]  thing that would bring them down I mean I mean the magnitude of the head of the
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:20.120]  ATF saying holders lying and what this guy was saying yesterday is something
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:24.520]  that we also knew about namely the Border Patrol was in on this that meeting
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:29.960]  two years ago that set up this particular Fast and Furious program included
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:36.480]  Border Patrol along with FBI and DEA and what Momito was saying that this
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.840]  CETA was saying is that there had to be some kind of a deal with the US to get
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:49.160]  trunk loads of arms across the border you never hear about trunk loads of
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:55.840]  arms being popped and yet if we do find drugs going from time to time so this is
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.280]  pretty strange that this was being allowed to happen and of course now we
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:07.160]  know why the Border Patrol was in on it too. Well this was all done to frame the
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:10.920]  Second Amendment and then we know for two years holders been saying get rid of
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:15.600]  the Second Amendment ban the semi-autos shut down the gun shows do all of this
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:19.240]  because of what's happening in Mexico and they knew full well the cartels were
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:23.000]  bringing in the guns fully auto grenade launchers from other governments other
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.560]  groups but they needed to have lots of weapons showing up that were from gun
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:32.040]  shops so they did it themselves I mean is this not a form of stage terror a
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:37.040]  false flag Larry Frant? Well and I think the Mexicans would not only second that
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:41.240]  motion but say it was an act of war against our country and I don't think
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:46.120]  much of the Mexican government but hey this is not exactly the way to deal
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:52.760]  with anybody this is it is monstrous that a policy would be developed with
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:58.760]  knowledge of forethought that unnamed people were very likely to end up dead
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:02.120]  that was the warning of one of the whistleblowers are you ready to go to
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:07.720]  funerals they knew what was going to happen of course they knew and they just
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:13.900]  didn't care because they had an ulterior policy design we can't you know we
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:17.440]  don't have the smoking gun on that what we don't have a transcript from the
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:21.880]  meeting but there's no other plausible explanation for something this bizarre
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:30.200]  something this wicked to be done well we know that they want our guns they want
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.920]  to end our our culture of liberty and freedom and they will do anything they
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:38.760]  can including staging this false flag attack to get to get the second
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:42.800]  amendment it's the MO of these people Larry Pratt thank you so much for
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:46.160]  joining us it's good to be with you thanks Alex appreciate folks going to
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.920]  gunowners.org and stay and post it on absolutely my friend we're on the march

[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.920]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:09.120]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:13.440]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:17.400]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:21.720]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:26.080]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:29.840]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:33.960]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.680]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.760]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.480]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:50.480]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:12.280]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:16.520]  from underneath the Americans at home I have a tremendous influence on our
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:20.760]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:25.960]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention fall the
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:30.560]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-shore cartel
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:34.920]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:38.680]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:42.600]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:48.160]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:00.240]  attacking police but I do know that the federal government is standardizing
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:04.640]  police training everywhere they're training them with TSA groping now
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:08.880]  they're erasing the fourth amendment I saw in the video last night of a guy in
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:13.480]  Arkansas Jonesboro videotaping his neighbor being stopped by police they
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:17.360]  put her in handcuffs she's clean cut got her kids bicycle on the back search
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.040]  your car let her go and he goes you guys are Nazis you're searching people out
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:24.880]  here without warrants he's in his garage by about 50 yards away they come up they
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.480]  said we're gonna get you for your grasping in too long about inch too
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:31.320]  long a little bit over the curb and they said we're gonna get you for a racial
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:36.600]  slur talking about about Nazis and then they go into his garage find a gun
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:41.040]  and charging with felon in possession of a gun until he went to court and he had
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:46.400]  no criminal record they knew that it's just I mean I see videos every day
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:49.840]  without looking where they beat someone up for no reason and then charge them
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:53.920]  with assault that they will beat the pulp out of you remember the ambulance
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:56.920]  driver they get behind the ambulance driver that famous footage and the
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:01.000]  ambulance is going 16 see the cop going like a hundred and it turns out he didn't
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.840]  really have a call because because you hear all the radio chatter state
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:10.400]  policeman Oklahoma and turn out he had a lot of problems in the past but his
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:14.800]  his daddy and people are all hooked up in the police department in the state
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:20.640]  police and and he pulls over the ambulance and they've got a woman turns
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:23.600]  out having a heart attack in the back and the guys get out white guy and a
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:26.840]  black guy and the first guy comes over the white guy and looks at me says
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:32.520]  we got a lady with heart situation well what I mean the guy looks like he's
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:35.480]  just seen shanna Claus in his living room on Christmas morning I mean he
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:39.520]  doesn't believe it he's like what's going the cops go get over there I told
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:44.200]  you got in my way and the driver gets out of the paramedic black guy
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:49.280]  comes over big black guy because you could tell he wanted to tear this guy up
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:54.160]  and he says what are you doing because you didn't get out of my wake working
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:58.280]  on it this cop car flies up on the tail and maybe for five seconds and even
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:03.000]  try to get over and there's no it's a grass shoulder so they fly up like
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.320]  maniacs on his hand in they can't get over the cops shoots around them but
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:12.960]  then waits and pulls them over it's it's really crazy and starts choking the guy
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.920]  and then the ambulance driver just going what are you doing man I got a
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:21.240]  patient the cops like I start choking me going don't resist me the guy's really
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.920]  smart he goes I'm not resisting you I'm not resisting you and the state police
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:29.840]  came out at first and said this is good this is good policy this is insanity
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:33.360]  this is like employees that get out of control and think that they're your boss
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.360]  or your children thinking you're your boss or your neighbor thinking you're
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:41.240]  boss we have this crazy neighbor so we moved years ago who was saying we had
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:46.800]  an imaginary cat we didn't have a cat okay and was saying you will come clean
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:51.040]  up the and and she was so crazy and looking at us and doing stuff that I
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.920]  told my wife let's turn the other cheek let's start cleaning up the cat poop I
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:57.760]  said let's get the house up for sale let's get out of here and it turned out
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:01.960]  her husband was like an engineer quasi retired for the state did they didn't
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:05.360]  like it that I was against toll roads they would freak out on me in the yard
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:09.240]  about that and then my man so she said you're gonna clean this up and my wife
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:12.360]  said we don't have a cat she goes yes you do little it was like a witch yes you
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:16.000]  do little lady and I said turn the other cheek get the house up for sale right
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.880]  now she'll black office with CPS these people work for the government I said
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:22.920]  let's get out of here and I said if she messes with us we're gonna sue her well
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:26.960]  we you know we will destroy them but let's just get out of here because it's
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:31.120]  it's and she we would go and weekly you know dig up the cat poop and worship her
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.800]  and she would stand there going I can't believe your little cat we like yes yes
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:39.760]  the little cat because these are mentally ill government worshipers they
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.960]  both want had worked for the government he still did now I mean I would walk
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:48.400]  outside they'd see me he was just shake with hate shake with hate now this is
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:51.960]  what government is you give them this power now for the rest of the hour we're
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:56.600]  going to be getting in to this with Jennifer Jones and actually have the
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:00.960]  world net daily article here Nazi police kidnapped woman at town hall that's what
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:04.920]  happened that's what it is official oppression the form of kidnapping that's
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:08.080]  like cops pull up in front of topless bars when the drunk dancers come out they
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:10.960]  say honey you're gonna service me in the back of the car that happens all the
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:15.560]  time it says I'm not going to quit until I see them in jail the small town in
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:20.080]  Arizona is suddenly a YouTube sensation after a town hall meeting devolved into
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:26.000]  a physical clash is they was called a class they they grabbed her was for
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.440]  removed for speaking during a public portion of the event Jennifer J Jones
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:36.400]  45 of courtside Arizona was taken into custody by local police at the behest of
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:39.280]  the council members who did not want her to be able to speak over the
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:43.560]  objections of the mayor who pleaded with officers not to remove the woman now
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:49.560]  you've studied this case I want to give people the the the news behind the news
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:55.320]  on what happened here right this this starts off in April of 08 and Alex it's
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:41:00.160]  insane basically Jennifer Jones is a lady who came moved to court site with
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:03.360]  her husband to start a dog grooming business are to keep her dog grooming
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:07.360]  business going she kind of wanted to go semi-retired and just live life and so
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:11.160]  in April of 08 she witnesses a code enforcement officer and a policeman
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:15.800]  harassing one of her neighbors and instead of turning the other they can't
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:19.280]  let the ants get together exactly and so instead of mining your own business and
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:22.960]  turning your head she stays in as a witness and so her neighbor comes up
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:26.440]  says what should I do and she says well you know you need to work with them now
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:29.960]  but you know you need to I'll be a witness for you will work on your rights
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:33.280]  and so then the code enforcement officer and the policeman turned to her and
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:36.840]  said well what can we get you with so they start harassing her she's been
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:41.280]  called a transient because her business is mobile she has a RV and a trailer and
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:44.840]  she moves them around wherever she gets the best rates well yeah they destroy
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:50.400]  the economy and then treats you like a gypsy for for if you live in a live in
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:54.960]  a shack or have a mobile business and and so she's been up fighting these people
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:59.440]  and it's it's police chief it's code enforcement it's the city council and
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:03.440]  most of the city it's a mafia yeah they've essentially set up shop in court
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:06.320]  site and they don't want anybody messing with what they're doing which is
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.520]  probably you know raising the water rates they just raise those up they took
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:15.160]  this public prosecutor who's they've just hired and this guy was is being
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:18.400]  investigated right now so they hired him because he's doing exactly what they
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:23.320]  want because their original prosecutor wouldn't go after Jennifer Jones and so
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:27.760]  this is all built up to a head she started her own newspaper you know the
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:32.440]  daily free the desert freedom press and she started writing about this stuff and
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.960]  people started coming to her with their problems so she's kind of becoming this
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:41.520]  pro se you know quasi pro se attorney standing up exactly she's walking tall
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:46.280]  and the next thing is they come into her business taking photos tell that story
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:51.340]  and then they go back and then and revoke her license stamping right the
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:54.520]  code enforcement officers out there taking photos of her business and she
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.880]  said what are you doing your trespassing and she asked them to leave well then
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:01.320]  the cops show up and they side with the code enforcement officer and take her
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:06.160]  to jail for disrupting what it ends up being disrupting an official business but
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:10.280]  at that point also there was another incident where they wanted to come in
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:14.480]  and look at her business and she said not without a warrant and they said no we
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:18.480]  don't need a warrant and they walked right in and she said no I have a
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:21.440]  business license I have every right to be here because they want to try to say
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.240]  the property she was on is not zoned for a business even though it's a swap meet
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.840]  center where they have swap meets every Saturday Sunday sure of a nottingham
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:32.420]  behavior exactly so then the code enforcement officer goes into the
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:36.440]  court records or the county records and and actually writes on there revokes her
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:39.920]  business license and signs it and then when she goes back to get it this past
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:44.800]  July it was up this this July that we're in now and they said no you can't get
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:50.320]  one you know it's well that's like the story out of a part in Michigan where
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:53.880]  they put these little vegetable boxes out in front of the house it looked very
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:44:00.200]  nice somebody didn't like it and it it actually says that it can have gardens
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:06.040]  but it quotes the court enforcement guy saying I've decided you can't right
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:11.360]  well this gets even weirder and in January of this year the police chief
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:14.560]  gets up and he starts reading about crime statistics and stuff like that and
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:16.520]  then at the end he goes well I got something I want to bring to your
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:21.280]  attention and he talks about what was written in her paper one of the writers
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:24.280]  Annie mentions her name he's and this is right after the shooting the Giffords
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:28.840]  shooting he says you know he starts equating what they're saying against
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:33.760]  you know police corruption and and and official corruption starts equating them
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.440]  to Jared Loeffner trying to say this is what's gonna happen if we don't put a
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.840]  stop to this so basically if you speak out against what's going on you're
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:43.840]  suddenly Jared well that's what they teach cops now who was a mind anybody
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:48.160]  that talks about freedom wants to kill the cops exactly and and and so from
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:52.000]  there then you get to the court case where are there the case in city council
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.240]  where she wants to stand up she's been recognized by the mayor who's doing
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:59.800]  something worse the citizens are now electing good people exactly elected a
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:04.200]  mayor they're taking their town back right you can't have that because you
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:07.160]  have this appointed city council they've all appointed their friends so they can
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:11.000]  run the mafia and they don't want her to speak so they start calling out
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.560]  motions they start telling the cops to grab her and so they take her away but
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:19.320]  they didn't charge her with anything so I guess she might be filing kidnapping
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.920]  charges is she's got to do with the state police let's play a short clip of her
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:27.640]  being arrested and then we'll go to Jennifer Jones there's a whole bunch of
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:30.560]  these clips shot from different angles must be 20 different videos online but
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:48.880]  here's one of them right now the mayor the mayor is saying I have control of
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:52.840]  the meeting it's her turn to speak let her speak and the police are grabbing at
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:56.560]  the microphone right with her as she's trying to talk because obviously she's
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:01.200]  with Al Qaeda Jared Lee Loftner talking is evil let's go ahead and play the rest
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:29.960]  of it that's the police chief right there
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:45.440]  and of course these tyrants act like this if they'd have just left her alone it
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:47:00.800]  wouldn't have got all the attention but no I mean the rules are once it's in
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:04.800]  front of the council right you have to hear it yeah and and it's her time to
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:08.600]  speak but now they're saying no we're not gonna do that they're now voting and
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:11.720]  of course she's talking about their corruption right and so they don't want
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:14.880]  this being discussed and they want to run out of town because he's got this
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:42.240]  newspaper let's continue and then we'll go to her this you are in violation of
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:47.520]  my rules of water you're not gonna talk about taxes in America they arrest her
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:53.520]  right here and they grab her the officer everybody was sir serve the treat us
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:48:07.200]  like trash here she goes the mayor saying let her speak the mayor saying
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:11.160]  stop it that's enough it goes on they take her to take her out let's go to
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:15.200]  Jennifer Jones Jennifer what happened once they once they drug you out of
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:19.400]  there hey good afternoon Alex I just first of all I just want to say thank
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:22.680]  you for shining a spotlight on what's happening here because I truly believe
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:28.800]  that cockroaches run from the light what happened was I thought that they were
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:32.640]  just going to remove me from the meeting and so I thought they were just
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:38.120]  gonna throw me out the door and shut the door on me I got outside and then at
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:41.480]  no time did they ever tell me I was under arrest and my understanding is you're
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:45.680]  either free to go or you're under arrest now they're God you know so I'm waiting
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:49.920]  for those those magic words you're under arrest but I never heard them I heard
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:55.200]  stop resisting the officer you know all of that nonsense but they took me
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:59.880]  outside of my husband another gentleman were standing right there and and they
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:06.200]  handcuffed me they had pulled me out by my arms especially the the one tall
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:10.840]  officer Patterson shoved me outside and then he twists my arm up behind my back
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:16.200]  and he says relax relax and I said I am relaxed they says no relax relax but he's
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:19.160]  twisting my arm a direction it doesn't want to go and he's already twisted it's
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:22.040]  all part of the mind game so after he beats you up they can charge you with
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:26.640]  something right so they handcuffed me and they walked me around to the woman
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:32.160]  officer Garcia walks me around to the back of the building and then she
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:36.240]  writes me a ticket for disorderly conduct which I thought was really strange
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:39.200]  because first I didn't know if I was now that they've handcuffed me but they
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:43.000]  still never said I was under arrest he said well will you sign the ticket and
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.800]  and last time they tried to pull this they invented some crazy misdemeanor
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:50.800]  that I didn't even know what it meant so I refused to sign the ticket until they
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:54.760]  told me who made the complaint what it meant I went to jail for that too but
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:58.480]  this time I'm like well if I don't sign this ticket and they take me to jail I
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:03.240]  may not get medical attention in jail so I'm like yeah I'll sign the ticket you
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:07.000]  know it's on videotape multiple videotape I even asked her is your badge
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.520]  cam on and she said yes and I said good I can't wait to get that video so they
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:15.640]  released me to the the ambulance service that took me to the county hospital I
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:19.240]  knew it wasn't broken but I felt like something had torn in my elbow maybe
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:23.200]  attended neuroligament or something you've been taught a lesson here and I'm
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:28.480]  sorry what you were evil please continue yes I'm I'm horribly evil I the people

[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:20.600]  it always happens the same as societies degenerate people make excuses for the
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:24.920]  corruption but humans act the same way we've acted for tens of thousands of
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:29.580]  years and there's no doubt there's nothing more dangerous than these
[01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:34.800]  entitled bureaucrats who think they own and run everything and I'm seeing videos
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:39.520]  all the time where city council people are beating each other up and police are
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:42.760]  arresting mayors when they're criticizing remember that video and they beat
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:48.600]  the mayor up where government is just going nuts and as the economy implodes
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:54.520]  it's only gonna get crazier talking to Jennifer Jones from court site Arizona
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:58.280]  and the story the last four or five days that's been one of the biggest on the
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:03.720]  internet describe the town describe what's going on describe the different
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:07.400]  power structures and why they were why they didn't want you to speak what were
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:12.680]  they so scared of well our new budget is being proposed right now and we had a
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:16.000]  work session on it a couple of days earlier of course you try and plan a
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.840]  lot of these these special meetings and work sessions early in the day when
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:23.960]  people are at work so they can't attend I'm self-employed and I can I can be
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:29.000]  there and the mayor had only gotten the budget packet the night before and he
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.760]  had done a horrible thing and shared it with some of us in the community so that
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:36.680]  we could see what was being proposed so several of us showed up to the the
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:40.920]  budget proposal and some things started to look a little interesting to us and
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:44.040]  I was trying to figure out how they'd balance the budget when we had borrowed
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.560]  a couple of million dollars from the state highway user revenue fund just to
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:50.920]  balance the budget the year before of course they keep those state highway
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:55.680]  funds commingled with our general fund shifted money from that commingled fund
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:00.720]  to pay for water and sewer then have no repayment plan to pay it back and and
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:06.160]  they go but it's not illegal what we're doing it's just creative math and I
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:12.920]  had noticed that they had put this proposed privilege tax into this evening
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:16.000]  session that they were going it appeared very clearly that they were going to
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.440]  pass a two and a half percent tax and expand the the types of categories of
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:25.560]  businesses that will be included in Arizona's privilege tax right now it's
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:30.400]  only motels campground certain activities very specific activities so
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:33.600]  basically every business in the town almost would have had a two and a half
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:37.680]  percent tax increase even businesses that are not subject to sales tax and you
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:42.720]  thought as a citizen in taxpayer you would talk yeah I mean you think you're
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:47.440]  in America lady are you crazy you don't you don't get to talk about them
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:52.040]  bloating the government and in taxing you and feeding on you and getting raises
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:58.480]  what happened Alex that night wasn't an accident what happened that night people
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:03.400]  have to understand this was very well planned out two days before this meeting
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:08.520]  the police chief and his sergeant and the building official slash assistant
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:13.360]  town manager had hooked up cameras in the meeting room for the first time in
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.040]  years and gotten the cameras going and they thought on the instant replay they
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:21.160]  might catch some of us anarchists and traditionists you know speaking out of
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:23.760]  turn or something in the audience maybe they were going to go back and write us
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:28.720]  tickets and and beat us down some more but it and sometimes you know instant
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:32.640]  replay means the other team gets the ball and in this case they got caught
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:37.360]  breaking the law and they got caught being out of control but they were under
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:42.600]  an obligation to put this police chief on administrative leave eighty percent of
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:48.240]  his police force went to as cops their state union filed a criminal and ethical
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:53.200]  misconduct charges on him about a month ago is their own procedure manual said
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:57.240]  that if an officer is under investigation for criminal conduct if
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:00.680]  there's an allegation maybe supposed to be placed on paid administrative leave
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:05.680]  well an outside law enforcement agency investigates the complaint instead of
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:09.600]  putting the police chief on leave the mayor called a meeting to do it and they
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:13.760]  wouldn't show up to the meeting so then at the regular so we're on that daily is
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:18.680]  right when they talk about kidnapping and mutiny I mean this is just even eighty
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:22.760]  percent of the cops are saying he's got to go and it's like no the mayor says
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:26.760]  be quiet let her talk and he says no well why not just make the police chief
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:30.840]  God I mean not just King why don't we why don't we make him king of courtsville
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:34.760]  courtside actually it's kind of interesting a woman named Violet Kiff who's a

[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:32.960]  everywhere people are going bankrupt everything's falling apart and government

[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:09.800]  taxes or not having us raise them you're evil going back to Jennifer Jones from
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:16.840]  court site Arizona I brought up the fact that why not make this the council
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:20.880]  members who don't like the mayor and the police chief why not just go ahead and
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:24.680]  admit that actually Christ may have returned to earth and then he may be
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:27.720]  living in court side and maybe the police chief did you ever think about
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:31.760]  that that you may be engaged in blasphemy right now yes because someone wrote
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:36.040]  that in in one of our local papers they actually compared the police chief to
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:40.640]  Jesus Christ and they said at the end of Christ days before the crucifixion he
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:45.040]  didn't have very many followers either just like the poor police chief Jennifer
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:48.600]  I never read this or known this I was joking about the Jesus thing I didn't
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:51.000]  know what you were gonna say after the break I didn't I didn't talk to you
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.520]  during the break did you I couldn't make this up Alex I really couldn't make this
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:58.160]  up one woman violent kiss has been writing the media mainstream media
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:02.080]  newspapers saying they're just disgruntled officers they're criminal
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:07.280]  complaints of his abuse of NCIC against political opponents is just because he
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:11.040]  didn't give them a raise and then this other woman high G a half moon wrote a
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:15.520]  letter comparing the chief of police to Jesus Christ I almost fell out of my
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:21.000]  chair when I read it yesterday and I thought you know we know they're not we
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.520]  truly believe these people are not mentally well some of them well how do
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:28.920]  you know he's not wait are you a conspiracy theorist you know Alex I
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:35.120]  didn't used to be but once I was in the National Forest and saw black gloves
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:40.480]  special ops ICS teams pointing guns at hippies in the forest who are praying
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:45.400]  for peace I said okay maybe there is something to some of that oh no no but
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:48.680]  I'm saying you're a conspiracy theorist and that you're denying that he may be
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:59.880]  Christ well yes I don't believe that he's Christ oh I'm sorry I you know so
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:04.920]  now so the camp that wants him to be I mean I was being sarcastic saying he'll
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:08.200]  be our king you said oh no let me tell you when we come back what I didn't
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:12.160]  didn't talk to you so I made the joke of that he's not just a police officer he
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:17.760]  may not just be a king but God and so he is now called God there so so so where
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:21.280]  are you going from here are you gonna charge him with a kidnapping well I'm
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:25.560]  I'm going to I've got the forms to fill out the complaint forms because I want
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:30.200]  to make sure that nothing is thrown out for lack of correct protocol you know
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:33.120]  we're dealing with the government here and it's the far stretched out the
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:36.760]  government to protect you from the government but I am going to file a
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:41.680]  complaint with DPS the state police and with the state Attorney General and with
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:46.800]  the Arizona Department Division of U.S. Justice Department for what happened at
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:50.920]  this meeting and some of the other meetings and make sure so basically now
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:57.360]  you're like the the high priest in in in in Jerusalem that called for Christ to
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:02.160]  be arrested that man yeah it's pretty much the mayor and I have become sort
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:05.840]  of and one or two other people who were willing to take the heat and put
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:09.520]  themselves out there have become the front line of defense for a couple
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:14.400]  thousand you've got a question to this this accuser of Christ yes one of the
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:17.720]  two people you were talking about do they attend the free coffee and donut
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:22.360]  seminar held once a month by the police chief absolutely he's got a group of
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:26.360]  apostles I mean followers that regularly show up to the meetings and
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:30.680]  applaud for him they show up to his little coffee and donut feed and they
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:35.360]  gaze adoringly at him and applaud for him well of course I recognize that he's
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:39.080]  the Christ to me out of the meeting oh you got one more point go ahead I was

[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:32.200]  told you weeks ago he will be running so we made the announcement for him I was
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:37.360]  just trying to put Rick Perry's name into the search engine and he's type Rick
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:42.080]  Perry and something else pops up first right beside it he's very happy he's
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:51.040]  having a very happy day Kaluka day Frabsha's day they're gonna blackmail him
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:55.960]  so bad it's gonna make everybody's head spin but that's the way things work Bob
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:58.720]  Chapman's do this for the rest of the hour I appreciate you being in here with us
[02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:06.040]  I do we're talking to Jennifer Jones an evil person who tried to speak at the
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:10.960]  city council meeting in the proper time to speak and criticize the police and
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:14.520]  the police came and arrested her even though the mayor said she's can speak
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:18.360]  even though she was wasn't cussing anything and a lot of folks are saying
[02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:23.280]  that's good I mean you don't talk in America I heard a conspiracy theory that
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:26.560]  folks used to have be able to talk in America at a city council meeting yeah
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:29.160]  well some of the people in there are actually sheep and they clap when she
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:34.400]  was being let out and that it's ridiculous that we're minions destroy
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:38.640]  all the freedom that's the thing people are trained move along don't look it's
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:42.520]  police business move along but then I was making the joke though I was making
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:48.160]  the joke going you know into the last break of the previous hour that and why
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:51.520]  not just make the police chief king then if he tells the mayor go take a hike
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:56.360]  and she said oh no actually in the local paper they say he's like Jesus repeat
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:10:00.200]  that Jennifer Jones for us I'd like to I'd like you to email me a copy of that
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:04.840]  because you know what maybe they're right I mean this could be could be the
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:12.560]  second coming well it's I think you can read the the comment on the other free
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:18.080]  newspaper in town you have to realize that the front page ads are from
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:24.080]  councilman Lucas and the real estate ad is from vice mayor Barbara Cowell and so
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:28.440]  it's a very subsidized free publication but it's called the desert
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:33.320]  messenger dot blog spot dot com and then there we learn about the police chief
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:38.240]  maybe Christ right and on the left hand side it'll say click here to read the
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:43.120]  current edition so all of your listeners can go to they call it ironically the
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:48.320]  people's voice except they've they've had a bad habit of censoring the voice of
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:51.600]  the people on our side of the dialogue which is why I started my little
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:56.560]  newspaper and I think if you really want to put up a bookend on this and start
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:00.280]  to understand what's going on and why court site would be doing this you have
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:06.600]  to realize that we fit about 90 miles from the Mexican border right on us 95
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:11.960]  north and south and at interstate 10 east and west you can move anything
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:16.600]  through this area and even though it's out in the middle of the desert and it's
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:20.840]  full of people in motor homes with solar power who live off the grid and home
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:25.480]  owners who want to keep their wells and not tie into city water there seems to
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:30.040]  be it always goes back to follow the money and location location location
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:35.080]  we've been asking ourselves why would these council members risk the
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:40.560]  incorporation risk the insurance risk everything for a $300 a month stipend
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:43.760]  you know we wanted to know where the money's going with that's what the
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:48.400]  mayor well ma'am as you said the police chief what last year earlier this year
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:52.120]  bio said that you guys might be violent yeah because you're you're speaking
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:56.880]  about freedom and then compared you to Jerry Lee Loeffner and I think if the
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:01.720]  Christ according to them says this it may be true listen I want you to plug
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:06.000]  your website one more time where folks can your terror side I'm sorry having

[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:33.520]  coming on with his lawyer the black fellow with his wife with the six kids
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:39.560]  homeschooled who had never you've got any trouble or had problems were living
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:43.080]  in a storage shed at the facility he managed with air conditioning and
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:46.440]  little house he'd built so after he lost his welding job and couldn't afford a
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:49.480]  home and the CPS came and took his children because they could make a lot
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:53.520]  of money getting them a strung out on the farmers pharmacological drugs is
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:14:00.760]  68% of foster children nationwide are oh hell he's meeting with CPS at 230 so
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:07.640]  so so so so he'll be on with us right before that's a 230 or say 130 okay
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:12.880]  great yeah he's popping on with his lawyer going to a Bob Chapman Bob just
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:16.960]  out of the gates what do you think now people that go homeless families and
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:20.640]  living in tents and stuff or even even an air-conditioned little houses they
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:26.080]  build now having the CPS swoop down you know basically like a scene out of
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:30.960]  Planet of the Apes and grab the humans in the nets and drag them away to the
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:40.240]  pedophile dungeons of the CPS it's not to be unexpected it's an extension of
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:47.240]  capturing young people to do the things that they want them to do and it's going
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:54.840]  to get worse because at the top of the political and economic chain there are
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:15:02.120]  a lot of people who have unusual desires and that's what they're doing it for and
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:07.880]  this behavior is rife not only in the United States but throughout the world
[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:15.800]  and it has been for many years there was reporting on this sort of thing back in
[02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:23.400]  the 1920s in relation to Nebraska and Boys Town and things like that
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:28.680]  well remember the thousands of missing kids in Florida that the feds had had
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:32.840]  grabbed from the state and then they were never seen again and CNN just quit
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:38.200]  reporting on it I mean they'll take one child and make a huge fiasco out of it
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:42.120]  it was a diversion but then it's come out in the Chicago Tribune and even
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:46.360]  Houston Chronicle that Dincor has been caught running white slavery that means
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:51.560]  sex slavery worldwide at an industrial scale with the UN and guess who the
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:56.480]  biggest contractor for CPS officers agents are people don't know these are
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:02.400]  private mercs a lot of them pedophiles here in the United States most of them
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:06.920]  are being grabbed by private mercenary contractor groups that run actual
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:11.000]  physical and military mercenaries outside the US I mean we are literally
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:17.920]  preyed upon well I think you're absolutely correct and I know that they
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:25.120]  supposedly supply security for post offices and things of that sort but I've
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:28.960]  never seen any of them around I think they get paid for doing nothing and it's
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:34.000]  just another racket and you're right about the worldwide prostitution and
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:44.040]  pedophile situation that they're in it was quite widespread in Bosnia and of
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:49.440]  course the same creeps that were running romp Bosnia then is still doing so and
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:55.080]  running the drugs out of Afghanistan into Europe but anyway it all meshes into
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:17:00.040]  any time a UN force lands it comes out in the news just that's why they joined
[02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:04.200]  the UN I mean it is to rape children I mean it's an army of pedophiles we're
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:10.120]  facing an army of pedophiles and you know nothing gets done about it because
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:17.680]  there's so many people with odd sexual appetites that run cities counties
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:24.280]  states even in the federal government as well I'm sure you've been to
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:31.920]  Washington DC and I don't have to take it any further but I'm glad that the
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:39.520]  young lady is pursuing these people in that city and I hope she's successful
[02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:45.600]  a lot of these police types lower enforcement types and in people in
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:52.460]  other walks of life as well have a messiah complex and it's what
[02:17:52.460 --> 02:18:00.560]  destroys people it's a very unfortunate thing to happen to people well that a
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:04.320]  lot of TSA people go crazy and in a couple cases stripped down naked and
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:08.720]  begin to yell I am God and flopping around that they're enjoying themselves so
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:15.040]  much well could be I haven't seen that yet but I'm not kidding we'll put it on
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:20.600]  screen NBC folks TSA agent arrested after stripping down naked and declaring I'm
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:25.200]  God no I'm not kidding I did they I mean they actually flip out was this an
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:29.240]  Austin no this was in Los Angeles that was another case too where they went
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:35.040]  crazy and so they were God maybe they have a course there that you should act
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:39.400]  like a God-like creature and maybe that's why they do that but see here's
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:43.160]  the deal Bob as I get more power real power you know as a big national
[02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:46.600]  syndicated host with hardcore political stuff my you know we're able to punch
[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:51.800]  news out there and and really sometimes set the agenda I get more and more
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:58.120]  concerned and and and and and and you know try to work harder and actually am
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:02.840]  even though I'm a good guy I'm almost ashamed of the power and then want to be
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:06.560]  careful but then I see these petty nobodies they just go wild a little
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:10.640]  bit of power yeah but that's why they do it because they have no power and they
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:15.480]  want to have power and they're extremely jealous of people like you who've got it
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:20.040]  all together and they were incapable of doing so and you're gonna find that through
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:24.160]  your entire life there's gonna be no letter because when you're in first
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:28.880]  place everybody wants to kick you out I've been there I've done that I've seen
[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:35.600]  it I've been subjected to it for over 50 years and now it's your turn Alex but
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:40.480]  I mean but I'm not even that good that's what's pathetic is these people are so
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:44.760]  busy trying to shoot somebody else down that they don't realize life is winning
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:49.160]  having a good life being a decent person is winning not running around being
[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:53.040]  worshiped like God Bob Chapman I want to get into the incredible military

[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:15.680]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:19.320]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:23.880]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:27.920]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:31.680]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:22:31.680 --> 02:22:35.360]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:51.520]  from your employer out of your paycheck and I guarantee you they're gonna start
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:54.560]  just doing it to everybody that's that's getting us ready for
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:59.120]  international austerity directly through the banking system also will NATO
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:04.240]  resurrect Operation Gladio to frame Gaddafi as Gaddafi saying I will
[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:08.200]  militarily strike back at you your attack in my country I'll attack Europe
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:12.840]  they're like oh my gosh he may launch a terror attack we've been bombing him for
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:16.680]  three and a half months and have al Qaeda rebels attacking he says he may fight
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:20.640]  back against Europe that's bombing him how outrageous and it's gonna be like a
[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:25.280]  time machine they're gonna say we attacked him in April and then he attacked
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:33.120]  us in August that's why we attacked in April was because of the because of the
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:37.120]  attack in August four or five months later this is the total disconnect in
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:42.320]  Fox News and CNN how outrageous that he might fire missiles at Europe well
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:46.840]  after we're blowing up schools and but my issue is they also he's playing
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:51.240]  into their trap the globalist may stage terror attacks as a pretext to sit in
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:55.560]  the ground forces this is a serious situation Bob Chapman what's your take
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:26:03.160]  well you never you should never warn your enemy what you're gonna do and these
[02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:09.440]  people have the great military power in Europe and the United States and so what
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:14.360]  that said if you're going to do terrorist things you go right ahead and do
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:20.480]  them and then let them figure it out and that's the way it should be handled I
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:30.800]  received a letter this morning email and one of the subscribers had been at a
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:39.640]  family meeting and one of the members who was talking about Libya and it was
[02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:48.480]  about the time that the aerial bombardment overflight situation began
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:55.960]  Alex how long ago was that two months three months say that again Bob the
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:27:02.240]  aerial bombardment in Libya how long ago oh yeah that's been going on for coming
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:09.880]  up on three and a half months you mean the aerial love yes well anyway the
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.560]  gentleman who was at the family reunion happened to be with the United States
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:23.360]  Marine Corps and they were being trained then to go into Libya and that was three
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:29.880]  and a half months ago so this has been in the works for some time and probably a
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:41.400]  long time prior to that many of the people in Europe are agree with Mr. Gaddafi
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:46.880]  not that they would normally do so perhaps but they think he's getting the
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:53.040]  raw end and I do too and have from the very beginning and well regardless it's
[02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:57.800]  gonna kill a bunch of our troops further bankrupt us and is all built on a lie and
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:02.280]  the group that started the attacks four months ago is Al Qaeda on record what
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:09.040]  are we doing this for Al Qaeda for because we control Al Qaeda and the
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:15.880]  Taliban and their creatures and creations of MI6 and the CIA and have
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:20.760]  been for a long time and we discussed this in the program before so now they're
[02:28:20.760 --> 02:28:26.880]  bringing them in the open to do their dirty work for them and I have seen
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:33.800]  reports I don't know how true they are of Mr. Gaddafi trying to find an exit by
[02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:42.240]  using the influence of Russia I don't know how true that is it seems somewhat
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:49.480]  out of character because he in fact would be abandoning his people but you
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:55.760]  know when situations people do strange things as well but the whole thing is we
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:00.800]  want to know the geopolitical position and let's rape the country and we've
[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:05.880]  gone over on the program before what's available in Libya or attached to Libya

[02:33:28.640 --> 02:33:34.000]  the live Friday broadcast I know all about the CPS I've been battling them
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:41.360]  since I got on air 16 years ago and they hunt poor people they mainly I'm
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:44.960]  telling you with black children they get them they they drug them they say
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:49.160]  their special needs and they get hundreds of thousands of dollars on
[02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:53.960]  average foster children in Texas 68 percent of them are on seven different
[02:33:53.960 --> 02:34:00.360]  psychotropic drugs that's also the national average it it it well it came
[02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:05.680]  out Newark Daily News five years ago that they take black children from their
[02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:08.840]  mothers and have them sign medical forms that will take the two-year-old if you
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:12.920]  don't give us the eight-year-old and they actually test pesticides on them
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:20.200]  till they die you cannot make this stuff up now the the CPS courts were set up in
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:25.040]  1910 first in New York and then in Boston from the Rockefeller Foundation then
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:32.440]  Hitler picked it up in the 30s it's a race hygiene is what they called them
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:36.240]  courts they're not real courts that's how they can do what they do the CPS or
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:40.520]  mercenaries a lot of them are Dincor that also run child kidnapping operations
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:44.000]  worldwide where they actually been caught running the sex slavery so they
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:48.080]  call themselves officials they're not most of our private pedophile contractors
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:51.960]  and scum they've been caught over and over again it's on record others are
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:55.360]  just mercenaries whether you work for the government or not it is pure evil it
[02:34:55.360 --> 02:35:03.840]  operates outside the Constitution we're going to Prince Leonard and of course he
[02:35:03.840 --> 02:35:07.960]  and his wife had their home there at the place that he maintained he lost his
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:13.080]  job as a welder three and a half years before and they came and took their
[02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:16.440]  children for the crime of being poor the CPS said yeah we'll take you if you've
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:20.080]  got your kids clothes and boxes for me talking to them in a moment Bob Chatman

[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:12.720]  to at least have a family as the economy goes into depression they're going to
[02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:17.640]  take your children it's happening everywhere they're now locking people up
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:21.120]  in Sacramento the homeless people they won't let them stay in tents they lock
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:25.440]  them up at night in a sports stadium we reported on that two years ago this is
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:30.200]  their program of control now I spent the whole first hour on this because of
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:34.880]  watching the media act like it's legitimate to take somebody's children
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:39.480]  in this case from what looked like a pretty nice house with a toilet and dry
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:44.920]  toilet they put in chemical toilet the you know computers homeschooled they've
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:50.280]  got air conditioning and he I mean I grew up around folks where the
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:54.080]  maintenance people you know lived in what you'd call a shack some of the best
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:56.760]  living in the world's done in that some of the most unhappy people in the world
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:37:01.200]  are living in mansions but my point is is this is the lawless evil of the CPS
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:04.880]  well they will take your children for dirty dishes in the sink when they're
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:08.160]  five times more likely than any other group to abuse children according to the
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:12.360]  Justice Department the Time Magazine coverpiece the shame of foster care now
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:19.640]  enough for me I want to introduce you to the activist minister Quonelle X who
[02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:23.120]  this happened a month ago we've now learned who finally got the media to
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:28.800]  cover it and has been helping Prince Leonard and his wife his six children
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:38.440]  and who should speak first mr. Leonard or a mr. X it's a problem for now well I
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:42.800]  just want to say thank you mr. Jones for allowing mr. Leonard and I to come on
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:46.920]  your radio show this afternoon we're grateful and I also want to commend you
[02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:50.240]  for challenging and going after CPS because the things that you said about
[02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:55.920]  earlier is absolutely right the only reason why mr. Leonard family have had
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:00.400]  their children snatched and taken away from them is strictly because in the
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:05.640]  eyes of a CPS investigator their living conditions were not conducive to her
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:10.960]  liking so they took the children these children are a and B on a roll students
[02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:15.200]  never had one dissuade report in school they were not a family were not
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:19.040]  neglected there was no allegations of drug alcohol abuse or molestating
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:24.680]  allegations none of that they strictly said that because you were poor and your
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:30.120]  standard of living does not meet the CPS investigators liking they took all six
[02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:34.360]  of this man's children and his wife's children and they called him at his job
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:38.480]  his wife called and she told him what was going on and unfortunately there was
[02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:42.040]  nothing he could do at the time but the reason they have given everybody
[02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:46.640]  including myself is they were poor they were not living in a dangerous
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:50.880]  environment just poor and the limits moved out of a dangerous environment and
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:55.720]  lived in their car because they were in a housing complex where drugs and alcohol
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:38:59.320]  and prostitution and gang violence was running rapid so the kids couldn't go
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:04.240]  outside and play by the way I've seen on Google video and Google Earth there's
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:10.120]  like a forest woods there's a big fence around the RV boat slash container park
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:15.080]  a big area for children to play some tattletale saw kids playing behind a
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:20.280]  fence and called CPS to begin with and we did actually talk to some of the
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:23.440]  people when they first lost his job when they were in a shelter and a lot of
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:26.840]  these places are hellish so he did the only thing a father could do he didn't
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:31.880]  go on welfare he kept working and was saving money and and literally built
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:36.760]  them a home that's the American way I thought and that's the most important
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:41.360]  thing that everybody needs to understand here mr. Leonard refused to take
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:46.080]  food stamps he refused to apply for welfare he refused to apply for housing
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:50.480]  his position was just so long as I'm healthy and able to work I'm going to
[02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:55.320]  work until my change comes while punish this man when CPS suggested he should
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:58.720]  apply for welfare and food stamps and housing but he didn't want to put up an
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:01.960]  assistant he wanted to do it for himself and now they've taken his man's
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:08.600]  children unbelievable so so continuing here bringing a mr. Leonard on tell us
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:12.120]  about your wife your children how long it's business you've seen your six
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:17.120]  darling children who just have you know have electric energy in their eyes it'll
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:21.960]  look like these you know mainline Prozac headkids that are out there I mean
[02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:25.160]  describe what you've been through and and where this is going because I'm now
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:30.200]  told due to attention that you have you are getting a home but CPS they don't
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:34.680]  like to be proven wrong that is a nicer home or something more to their godlike
[02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:38.000]  liking so we don't know yet if you are gonna be getting your children back
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:41.480]  right now it's a puzzle you're gonna be meeting with them in about an hour
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:47.560]  yes sir well they came two days before father's day my children I was at work
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:52.720]  and my wife called me on the job and she was telling me about CPS taking our
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:56.000]  children and I was like wait a minute ask the lady her name he told her her
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:00.680]  name and then I say actually he's from paperwork and he's gonna take our
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:03.680]  children to make sure that that's who she's with you don't want to get my wife
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:09.400]  to paperwork so I thought about 911 911 and the police time finally she gave my
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:15.120]  wife a piece of paper and so yeah it's been our life has been upside down you
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:20.080]  know it's how it's the house we said places been in it's quiet no children you
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:24.320]  know a lot of times we sit and look at the pictures of look at the wall just
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:29.640]  say you know just thinking about them what I've often thought about this
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:33.280]  having my three children torn away I don't think I could control myself
[02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:37.560]  I mean what was the horror like when they tore him away what did your little
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:43.000]  ones go through they were crying like my daughter told me that my two-year-old
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:47.880]  my youngest one he cried all the way from the place to the to the grandparents
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:53.440]  house and he cried a long time you know he was a nursing you know they just
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:57.400]  stripped him away from my wife my wife asked for a breast pump and they said
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:00.680]  they was gonna get one but they never got a breast pump I could count on my hand
[02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:05.200]  on 1 a how many times they take a recording they take they call us and
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:09.520]  talk to us they never did that they didn't do nothing they didn't try to help
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:14.000]  us out they didn't offer us enough it's gonna take your shooter away from you
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:18.120]  well it do the good news is at least they are with the grandparents but you
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:22.720]  never know what the CPS will do now and and that's another point why just take
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:30.520]  the children away why not then offer you some help that's the question my wife
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:34.280]  asked her like five while I was on the phone she asked the lady five times you
[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:37.760]  know we just help them we you have put we went we told people at the public
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:41.920]  school our issues and they asked us if we offer you help will you accept it we
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:46.720]  say yes but nobody never helps us so we had to do for ourselves and that's what
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:51.680]  we just what I've been doing I work and I work and I work and just keep just keep
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:55.600]  working in the one day you know one of these good days I have me a place for
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:42:59.240]  my family and this could be behind us now that's how we looked at it but in the
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:02.840]  meantime we're not gonna do that illegal we're not gonna do that wrong we just
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:06.200]  gonna do it how we supposed to do it until we get up to play well described
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:11.040]  for people sir how all this began I mean I mean how you how you ended up
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:15.880]  having to move in to the storage facility but it had air conditioning a
[02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:19.280]  toilet everything I mean I saw the video it looked pretty pretty nice your
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:24.200]  children look extremely happy I mean since when is that a crime I don't know
[02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:29.040]  we are we are we live there we live there at the apartment complex but what was going on
[02:43:29.040 --> 02:43:34.040]  it was a lot of drugs then so and police were kicking in doors and so I was like
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:37.160]  well I don't think I want to stay anymore but we stayed there for like a
[02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:41.840]  big two years and we are and every six months they will go up on the lease but
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:46.240]  they wouldn't improve the place and we've had issues with rats and roaches
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:51.600]  and so we are after my lease was up my wife and I we left out of this place
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:54.360]  out of the apartment complex so we stayed in the car the wife so we could
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:59.000]  figure out what is it that we want to do so we started standing this year
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:04.760]  the boat in RV stores and we fixed it up so it'll be livable that's what we
[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:12.160]  done well living in a big empty RV boat area with with basically a park there
[02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:15.480]  it's so big that sounds like a great place with children behind the fence
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:21.480]  safe then living in some crack infested den I want to bring the activists
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:29.800]  who's brought this story out to people up here Mr. X here a quantel X sir now
[02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:33.160]  we're told though that people have stepped forward and he is going to get a
[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:39.760]  home but obviously tell us where that's going but what the CPS is acting like
[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:45.000]  how they're behaving right now well there we have successfully gotten them a
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:49.760]  place to stay that's more decent and more palatable to see if this liking
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:53.560]  because they say they want them somewhere else but we've got them that what
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:59.320]  the family's in need of now it's furniture or appliances take care of six
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:03.200]  children is calling down on your luck they need as much as they possibly can to
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:06.400]  make their home now whether they're going to be going a very palatable
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:10.720]  acceptable place for them to live but remember CPS to come in and say well you
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:13.680]  don't have enough food in the refrigerator or you have too many
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:18.600]  unclean dishes that's not being washed consistently see some of these CPS
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:23.440]  investigators are very arrogant disrespectful to poor people yes they
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:27.360]  have placed the children with grandparents but now I'm being told by
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:31.800]  CPS source that one to do a whole study on the grandmother and if the
[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:36.600]  grandmother is viewed to be too old or if she's currently on medication or she
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:41.000]  has some disabilities because of the ages of the children no that's taken from
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:44.400]  the grandparent and place them in foster care no that's how they always work to
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:47.680]  make themselves look reasonable they'll do that at first then they'll white glove
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:50.680]  inspect for those that don't know at West Point they put white gloves on and
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:54.120]  go around the light bulbs and go under things if any dirt gets on the glove you
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:58.800]  fail and then meanwhile these CPS people it's like awesome they give you $3,000 a
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:02.920]  day fines for three inch grass and then I go to the city buildings they got two
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:07.760]  foot grass and council members got foot tall grass you know I've shown those
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:13.160]  video reports to folks and it's really caused a stir total hypocrisy so we need
[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:20.000]  to get the folks some financial support us and and obviously legal support is
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:23.680]  now coming so they can't win this victory people say well they're grabbing
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:28.560]  millions of kids overall every year you know the point is this has gotten
[02:46:28.560 --> 02:46:32.600]  attention and we can't let this story get attention and then the children
[02:46:32.600 --> 02:46:36.920]  basically be completely taken away as you were just saying we've got to stand
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:43.400]  up and you know show people what needs to be done what's coming up today in
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:49.160]  about an hour at the CPS meeting we have a meeting in an hour with CPS to
[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:54.960]  discuss the terms and conditions of reuniting the family and if the family
[02:46:54.960 --> 02:46:59.320]  meets the terms and conditions the CPS puts before us today they're saying they
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:03.560]  will reunite the family but I don't trust these terms and conditions I'm
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:08.080]  going to scrutinize these terms and conditions and if I find them to be
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:11.600]  unacceptable we're going to take them and we'll fight them in court and we'll
[02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:14.760]  fight them in a court of public opinion and we'll organize as many people as we
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:18.920]  possibly can to fight CPS because sometime they'll put terms and conditions on
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:23.080]  families that are absolutely unreasonable and unattainable this man
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:27.280]  yeah they'll do things like you got to pay $2,000 a month and I've seen it
[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:31.880]  hire to go to all these family classes you got to drive all these places we're
[02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:35.600]  going to come and inspect you every week and then they find one thing they
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:39.520]  don't like then you've signed an agreement they take your kids forever
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:46.240]  right absolutely no no I mean listen they have bounties on children they're
[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:49.520]  not there to help children are there some social workers that aren't evil in
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:55.080]  some cases but the overall system is predatory it's on record now I'm told
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:57.920]  that there is an account number and you guys didn't even bring this up to me but
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:03.760]  I'm bringing it up I'm told that there is an account number for people and I'm
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:07.360]  gonna say right now since other folks are helping and now that there's a home I
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:11.760]  was saying I was ready to go get him a place rented and put $10,000 down so we
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:17.480]  you so he would have close to a year of it paid but I'm I'm gonna give $5,000 of
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:21.720]  my money because folks tied to these corrupt churches who you know buy big
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:25.120]  swimming pools and the rest of it you're supposed to tithe to widows and the poor
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:28.760]  and people that are in trouble so it's real charity not the government with
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:34.280]  strings attached I'm gonna give $5,000 Monday because my accountant who will
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:38.240]  wire it I'm too dumb to do it myself is I guess I got my wife to it I'm gonna
[02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:42.200]  wire $5,000 on Monday I'm not gonna wait I'm gonna I'm gonna do it today I'm gonna
[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:47.200]  wire $5,000 today into this account and I would ask everybody else to you know to
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:53.320]  wire $510 into this account or there's a mailing address to help Mr. Leonard
[02:48:53.320 --> 02:48:59.320]  because he didn't go on welfare he built this home you know he he he did
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:04.320]  what rugged Americans are supposed to do and and we need to stand up to the CPS
[02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:08.800]  and say it's not illegal to be poor it's not illegal to not want to live in
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:12.120]  government housing it's not illegal to want to raise your own children we're
[02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:18.000]  human beings treat us like that what are the best places to send
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:23.680]  contributions Mr. Leonard give them the account number okay Bank of America
[02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:44.720]  48029678611 please say that two more times from the start starting again 48029678611
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:55.680]  and folks a lot of you're gonna say what is it gonna do to help one family if we
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:49:59.680]  all started finding people on our street or our neighborhood or like when I was a
[02:49:59.680 --> 02:50:03.440]  child my parents really did this so I know how good I had it taking me down
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:10.000]  many Christmases to be at the Salvation Army in South Dallas and to feed people
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:15.240]  and to do things like that at those soup kitchens if that is what it's all
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:20.200]  about if Americans started acting like this even two days a month and if you
[02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:24.640]  gave your money and churches aren't gonna like this to people individually like
[02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:28.000]  I feel bought people medical beds done things like that stuff people never
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:34.440]  hear about the point is you charity starts at home and it's time for us to
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:38.160]  do this not this big corrupt bureaucracy that's supposed to take care of us
[02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:42.600]  there's nothing but a eugenics murder arm with a bunch of compartmentalized
[02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:47.160]  idiots that don't even know what they're doing Bank of America it's Prince

[02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:29.440]  would control the world invisible Empire Chronicles how men of power and
[02:53:29.440 --> 02:53:33.360]  influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:37.360]  world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a
[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:41.080]  world constitution for the global financial system global governance with
[02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:45.320]  the establishment of the G20 so it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then

[02:54:19.160 --> 02:54:22.720]  overdrive internet only at info wars.com to cover some other news when our
[02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:26.920]  guest leave us here in a few minutes to ask any questions he's got but I want to
[02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:31.160]  point out that you can go to and I'm the one that recommended this it's not
[02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:38.080]  added yet qxjustice.com that's the activist Mr. X's website is community
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:42.760]  activists in Houston who I've actually read about before and he's gonna add
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:47.000]  the number there on the site to the Bank of America account I think that's
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:50.840]  very important to do by the way talking to him during the break they took the
[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:54.920]  children to state doctors try to dig up some dirt they have nothing else to take
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:54:58.520]  the children away for first they were in the news when this broke on for July
[02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:06.200]  4th a month after it happened saying that the children were taken because the
[02:55:06.200 --> 02:55:12.520]  house you know what was was too cramped and wasn't nice now they're saying well
[02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:15.000]  there might be some other things so they're really trying to cover their
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:19.760]  hind in but they don't have anything else and I cannot describe to you how evil
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:24.680]  CPS is for my own experience and how ruthless and how outside the
[02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:29.200]  Constitution they are Bob Chapman what's your take listening to all of this
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:34.440]  well we've been through this on the program a couple of times before but
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:39.840]  we've never had an incident where they've gone in and taken a whole family of
[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:49.040]  children out and for very spurious reasons and that's unusual I think too
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:55.400]  minority communities should get together and fight this sort of thing they
[02:55:55.400 --> 02:55:58.760]  actually have a little bit more leverage than we do they certainly don't
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:03.960]  have the money that we might have but the point is that they they can make
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:07.800]  themselves here and and I gotta start thinking about that and they can work
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:12.760]  with this activist gentleman in doing things like that to make sure that this
[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:17.280]  doesn't happen again that's why I love going to you Bob because you bring up
[02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:23.000]  points that I meant to bring up where is the black community when I don't mean
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:26.480]  to get off into this but this is part of it when 52% of blacks are never born
[02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:31.400]  or boarded when the CPS just has a free hand in these communities
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:35.760]  institutionalizing these children for a future in prison once the state gets
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:41.240]  them where is the NAACP where are all these organizations or are they out
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:47.320]  there speaking out against this and is the media covering it up minister
[02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:54.480]  civil rights organizations have become really just country clubs with
[02:56:54.480 --> 02:56:59.240]  membership to attend bank with seminars and function they're no longer playing
[02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:05.000]  the role of the activist groups like they were in its inception that's black
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:09.200]  organizations though but then the African-American community many of us
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:13.800]  are being lured off to sleep by what's happening with CPS because many of our
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:19.480]  political elected leaders never speak out against CPS not one African-American
[02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:23.040]  elected official has come to the assistance or the aid of the Leonard
[02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:26.440]  family they all know what's going on in this city with the Leonard family but
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:30.280]  none of them have said anything to the Leonard family are tempted to try to
[02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:35.480]  help because they themselves are in so going to twine with the system and
[02:57:35.480 --> 02:57:40.480]  seeing CPS as a state governmental licensed agency they are closing their
[02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:46.080]  eyes to what this license kidnapping group is doing and African-American
[02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:50.560]  children and minority children are the number one children set upon for
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:56.520]  kidnapping by CPS and until there's an uprising from the grassroots community
[02:57:56.520 --> 02:58:00.560]  of the African-American community whole black leaders accountable for this and
[02:58:00.560 --> 02:58:04.280]  doing nothing about this it won't change absolutely gentlemen will obviously have

[02:58:40.880 --> 02:58:51.520]  Bob Chapman thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today this is
[02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:54.880]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[02:58:54.880 --> 02:58:59.160]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[02:58:59.160 --> 02:59:03.320]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[02:59:03.320 --> 02:59:07.400]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:59:07.400 --> 02:59:11.760]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:59:11.760 --> 02:59:15.840]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:59:15.840 --> 02:59:20.400]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:59:20.400 --> 02:59:24.520]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:59:24.520 --> 02:59:28.520]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:59:28.520 --> 02:59:32.320]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:59:32.320 --> 02:59:35.040]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[02:59:35.040 --> 02:59:40.320]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar
[02:59:40.320 --> 02:59:44.760]  backup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the
[02:59:44.760 --> 02:59:54.160]  Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 coast to coast direct
[02:59:54.160 --> 03:00:01.560]  from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:13.360 --> 03:00:19.320]  All right we're in to overdrive I'll be back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. and whether the
[03:00:19.320 --> 03:00:22.600]  children are white black Hispanic I don't care what color they are it's
[03:00:22.600 --> 03:00:28.960]  wrong what happened to them and it's really sad that more people don't stand
[03:00:28.960 --> 03:00:33.160]  up for folks like this family but I looked into the case all week and it just
[03:00:33.160 --> 03:00:37.400]  disgusted me and Bob I apologize for cutting off half your interview today

[03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:03.560]  happening in the world economy right now jobs came in a little the jobs and
[03:01:03.560 --> 03:01:07.480]  been added but not many and that caused the market to go down and obviously we've
[03:01:07.480 --> 03:01:10.920]  had the banksters expanding their takeover in Europe now going into
[03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:15.320]  Portugal with threats of their rating level being dropped in closing in four
[03:01:15.320 --> 03:01:18.960]  minutes what's happening with the economy well on these figures this
[03:01:18.960 --> 03:01:26.560]  morning 18,000 jobs the bottom line is really that 200,000 jobs were lost not
[03:01:26.560 --> 03:01:34.400]  18,000 were gained it's another Mickey Mouse report and they based it on the
[03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:41.080]  birth-death ratio and it fabricated jobs and it's been going on and on and on I
[03:01:41.080 --> 03:01:46.880]  wrote a piece about it you'll see it in tomorrow's issue and it's far worse than
[03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:51.220]  what people think it is and it's going to get a lot worse you know I've been
[03:01:51.220 --> 03:01:54.640]  saying for a long time this is what the figures are going to be and this is
[03:01:54.640 --> 03:01:59.960]  where we're headed net unemployment 22.6% we're going higher and it's just
[03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:03.880]  showing up it just shows you that everything Wall Street and banking and
[03:02:03.880 --> 03:02:10.360]  the media major media is coming out with is gobbledygook it's not true and a
[03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:14.320]  good example is a gentleman we just had on here with the six children he's
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:19.400]  struggling to make a living and in many millions of Americans and people in
[03:02:19.400 --> 03:02:24.400]  other countries are doing the same thing switching over to Europe we haven't
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:29.640]  heard the last of this thing in Greece yet the people don't trust either party
[03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:37.240]  and they're eventually going to probably have a revolution there and I think
[03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:44.840]  Mr. George Papadreo is probably going to flee the country and we thought that
[03:02:44.840 --> 03:02:50.560]  perhaps some help might come from the other party but I'm not as optimistic
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:57.760]  as I was before that they might do so the Greek Orthodox Church is doing
[03:02:57.760 --> 03:03:03.360]  everything they can to educate people as to what has been done to them and I
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:08.760]  think this is a model which the bankers have put together so that they can do
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:13.680]  it to every country and that means they just want to rape everything that
[03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:18.400]  they've got and as you see it spreading through each country and I wouldn't be
[03:03:18.400 --> 03:03:26.160]  surprised if we didn't see an extension we were looking at six countries now
[03:03:26.160 --> 03:03:31.240]  that are in serious trouble over there there's going to be more because the
[03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:37.480]  French and the Dutch and the Germans and the Finns and the Austrians and a few
[03:03:37.480 --> 03:03:41.160]  others they're paying all the bills I mean where's all the money going to come
[03:03:41.160 --> 03:03:48.760]  from it isn't and so those are festering ongoing situations we're looking at the
[03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:53.080]  same thing in America will we look at the extension of the short term budget
[03:03:53.080 --> 03:03:58.720]  deficit what are they looking for here we don't know exactly but I'll tell you
[03:03:58.720 --> 03:04:05.120]  what they I think they want to do close tax loopholes for the wealthy and that
[03:04:05.120 --> 03:04:13.360]  will be patent I think on the 1986 tax reform act by Ronald Reagan which was a
[03:04:13.360 --> 03:04:20.360]  disaster for our country financially 8 million million years went bankrupt for
[03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:26.000]  following the rules so they changed the rules no grandfathering and lots of
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:31.880]  people lost everything the other side of that is they want to increase the age of
[03:04:31.880 --> 03:04:36.000]  Social Security and they also want cut back on the page so basically total
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:40.160]  austerity Lord willing next Friday Bob will have a full hour with you and really
[03:04:40.160 --> 03:04:44.760]  walk through all of this thank you so much for joining us Bob I'll see you
