[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.360]  welcome my friends welcome we're gonna have wide open phones throughout the four
[00:40.360 --> 00:43.480]  hours today and we're gonna finish up with part two and interview that we
[00:43.480 --> 00:47.800]  started last week we'll do part two live here on the air with dr. Bob Bowman
[00:47.800 --> 00:53.120]  coming up in the third hour today we're gonna open the phones up throughout the
[00:53.120 --> 00:58.280]  broadcast on any news item any issue anything happening locally in your area
[00:58.280 --> 01:02.880]  any national news story you wish to discuss any piece of legislation you
[01:02.880 --> 01:10.120]  wish to talk about there is so much to discuss here we also have the Democratic
[01:10.120 --> 01:16.840]  Party and the large fortune 100 who are financing the illegal alien invasion
[01:16.840 --> 01:22.000]  bragging that they're gonna have basically weeks and weeks of protests and
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.840]  demonstrations like the ones we saw back in 2005 six seven and eight pushing for
[01:28.840 --> 01:34.040]  total amnesty the end of the nation total open borders you don't have a
[01:34.040 --> 01:38.880]  country if you have open borders and just give a national ID card to anybody
[01:38.880 --> 01:42.800]  who comes here and of course it will further bankrupt the nation because much
[01:42.800 --> 01:48.200]  of these individuals coming in are also getting on the government welfare dole
[01:48.200 --> 01:53.520]  which the bankers love bankrupt things as fast as possible because the nations
[01:53.520 --> 01:58.160]  are all in debt to the banks who make the money up out of nothing so we'll be
[01:58.160 --> 02:03.880]  discussing that today Mexico acknowledges a migrant abuse pledges
[02:03.880 --> 02:10.360]  changes that's the point I always make there is really no country in the world
[02:10.360 --> 02:14.760]  except for maybe North Korea of course nobody's trying to get into North Korea
[02:14.760 --> 02:19.960]  they're all trying to get out but you have a lot of Latin Americans from
[02:19.960 --> 02:26.360]  south of the Mexican border Guatemala and and south of that point who want to
[02:26.360 --> 02:33.800]  get in to Mexico to get into the United States and Mexico arrest anyone that
[02:33.800 --> 02:40.160]  doesn't have papers anyone that is not from Mexico who isn't in a tourist zone
[02:40.160 --> 02:45.480]  and they take them to these dirt floored concentration camps is the only way
[02:45.480 --> 02:49.720]  they can be described where they are beat up and abused and that is in the
[02:49.720 --> 02:56.440]  Associated Press today and it says you know I've said it many times can you
[02:56.440 --> 03:01.040]  imagine if as an American whether you're Hispanic black white it doesn't matter
[03:01.040 --> 03:05.520]  if you tried to go to Mexico right as your wife's water broke and you marched
[03:05.520 --> 03:09.920]  into the hospital and said my baby is now going to be a Mexican citizen and you
[03:09.920 --> 03:14.480]  owe them free health care and my wife and I and the rest of my kids we're all
[03:14.480 --> 03:21.200]  now going on government welfare and then if 30 million Americans down in Mexico
[03:21.200 --> 03:28.040]  demanding everything free started marching around screaming and yelling and
[03:28.040 --> 03:32.520]  attacking police as they did in Arizona last week you would be mowed down with
[03:32.520 --> 03:40.360]  machine gun bullets not rubber bullets Mexico is brutal and collapsing so we
[03:40.360 --> 03:45.320]  have to secure the border now the border is collapsing much of the southwest
[03:45.320 --> 03:50.320]  especially south Texas and west Texas is financially collapsing because of this
[03:50.320 --> 03:54.200]  and that's not my words that's the government's own words failed state
[03:54.200 --> 04:01.040]  Mexico has collapsed all you've got is armed camps of government troops and
[04:01.040 --> 04:05.800]  installations guarding the resources and stealing the resources and the rest of
[04:05.800 --> 04:09.280]  the public is just ascending into bedlam now there are some cities and
[04:09.280 --> 04:15.200]  towns that are still untouched by this to a certain extent but large sectors of
[04:15.200 --> 04:22.280]  Mexico is a unbelievable war zone and the media for years kept this quiet but
[04:22.280 --> 04:26.480]  not now so we'll go over all of that coming up also doctors sterilize
[04:26.480 --> 04:33.440]  Uzbek women by stealth and you read this article it doesn't give you any
[04:33.440 --> 04:39.120]  backstory of why this is happening the government is getting IMF and World Bank
[04:39.120 --> 04:46.960]  funding to do this just like Peru just like India just like many other nations
[04:46.960 --> 04:51.000]  have been caught and the point is we should be honest about why this is
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.640]  happening and discuss the fact that it's now being pushed and promoted here
[04:54.640 --> 04:57.720]  we'll talk about that as well one of other key news straight ahead stay with

[08:18.440 --> 08:24.600]  going to detail it all and this hour I'm going to open the phones up and take
[08:24.600 --> 08:28.040]  call after call because I love the different directions that callers take
[08:28.040 --> 08:33.200]  us in the wild card aspect of information and directions we may not
[08:33.200 --> 08:37.400]  have gone in if not for the callers and the guests but let me tell you about
[08:37.400 --> 08:42.960]  some of the news that is coming up proposal all New Yorkers become organ
[08:42.960 --> 08:50.760]  donors and that is WCBS TV that is not Alex Jones's headline this is what
[08:50.760 --> 08:55.520]  Europe does they know the public's not paying attention they don't ask you when
[08:55.520 --> 09:00.600]  you're at the DMV in major European countries getting your driver's license
[09:00.600 --> 09:05.760]  of your worker ID pass they just enroll you in it and you have to know it's
[09:05.760 --> 09:11.600]  going on and you have to go in and say no I want to be taken off of it and it
[09:11.600 --> 09:17.680]  all sounds good oh there's now tens of thousands of people every year that need
[09:17.680 --> 09:26.240]  organs and so many people die and they didn't have access to organs and and
[09:26.240 --> 09:29.920]  other people dying car wrecks but they weren't organ donors so we have to throw
[09:29.920 --> 09:35.400]  them away in just a few minutes you can go use any major search engine and
[09:35.400 --> 09:41.240]  search the terms hospital caught stealing organs or hospital caught
[09:41.240 --> 09:48.120]  stealing liver or kidneys or hospital caught stealing corneas or I live Austin
[09:48.120 --> 09:52.280]  Texas they've been caught repeatedly at city-run hospitals stealing people's
[09:52.280 --> 09:58.480]  corneas they do not ask they do not care if you are an organ donor or not
[09:58.480 --> 10:05.160]  they're already stealing them and I've told the story about I was 15 taking
[10:05.160 --> 10:10.240]  driver's safety in Dallas Texas and my dad who's a dentist and also done oral
[10:10.240 --> 10:18.200]  surgery in hospitals he said son don't sign the organ donor card and I said
[10:18.200 --> 10:26.040]  why and he said the word is from surgeons and physicians I know in Dallas and
[10:26.040 --> 10:30.040]  in other parts of the country if you come in and aren't even brain dead and
[10:30.040 --> 10:35.080]  have a good chance of being revived they will not give you as much care in some
[10:35.080 --> 10:38.840]  hospitals because they get kickbacks they can get hundreds of thousands of
[10:38.840 --> 10:44.800]  dollars for your organs and that was 20 years ago 20 plus years ago and I
[10:44.800 --> 10:49.720]  didn't believe him you know when you're 15 years old you tend to not buy
[10:49.720 --> 10:54.280]  everything your parents are telling you you know you're thinking oh everything
[10:54.280 --> 11:01.200]  and then years later I saw 60 minutes report on it where hospitals in Chicago
[11:01.200 --> 11:07.200]  and other areas were killing people for their organs and so that's what's so
[11:07.200 --> 11:12.280]  dangerous about this they're also proposing taking prisoners organs then
[11:12.280 --> 11:15.880]  that incentivizes putting innocent people in prison and giving them the death
[11:15.880 --> 11:19.920]  penalty and of course DNA has shown that more than a third of people on death
[11:19.920 --> 11:25.080]  row were innocent and we now know about crime labs all over the country and at
[11:25.080 --> 11:28.800]  the federal level framing people I mean it was in the news last week the week
[11:28.800 --> 11:38.840]  before that just Boston Chicago San Francisco LA in just the last month just
[11:38.840 --> 11:44.560]  framing people in mass so we have a criminal government they have almost
[11:44.560 --> 11:49.280]  completed the conversion of kicking all the good people out and having nothing
[11:49.280 --> 11:54.440]  but criminals in mid-level and high-level positions they have almost completed the
[11:54.440 --> 12:01.240]  tyranny transfer it's taken them decades for crooks to get into positions of
[12:01.240 --> 12:05.480]  power and then to recruit their buddies in and now we are looking down the
[12:05.480 --> 12:10.040]  barrel of a gun you can't trust anything the government says you can't trust
[12:10.040 --> 12:13.280]  anything they say I mean you know that how many times they get caught lying
[12:13.280 --> 12:19.520]  it's the exception when government isn't lying and who does the government
[12:19.520 --> 12:24.800]  work for the big mega banks and corporations so that is coming up
[12:24.800 --> 12:32.480]  headline all New Yorkers become organ donors haha we're gonna get into Mexico
[12:32.480 --> 12:35.840]  how they treat American citizens how they treat Latin American citizens
[12:35.840 --> 12:42.960]  they're apologizing Mexico acknowledges migrant abuse pledges changes I mean I
[12:42.960 --> 12:49.640]  want to go into how Mexico treats outlanders outsiders and then they're
[12:49.640 --> 12:54.320]  always screaming bloody murder about their citizens pouring over the border
[12:54.320 --> 13:00.200]  and sucking off the welfare system and becoming a political block and we'll go
[13:00.200 --> 13:04.000]  over that entire controversy that's unfolding with Arizona the illegals
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.040]  saying they're going to demonstrate and march all over the country I think
[13:07.040 --> 13:12.160]  that's great because a lot of times they get violent you don't have to hire
[13:12.160 --> 13:15.200]  provocateurs to go make them look violent a lot of times they get violent
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.440]  and that'll discredit them further and this will only wake up Americans even
[13:20.440 --> 13:24.680]  more a lot of Americans five years ago weren't awake to the illegal alien
[13:24.680 --> 13:29.040]  situation but after watching those giant marches with illegals waving Mexican
[13:29.040 --> 13:34.000]  flags and shing down with the USA it was a big fat wake-up call wasn't it well
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.720]  good come out get the streets marching rally and you'll notice there won't be
[13:38.720 --> 13:44.200]  any SWAT teams there won't be any riot cops attacking peaceful demonstrations
[13:44.200 --> 13:48.920]  of illegals no that they only attack citizens they're only given the green
[13:48.920 --> 13:53.240]  light to attack citizens and to bully people in fact we have video and article
[13:53.240 --> 13:59.960]  up on info wars calm today by curtain emmo where a peaceful crowd of several
[13:59.960 --> 14:05.560]  hundred tea partiers in Illinois in a town we're gonna demonstrate down the
[14:05.560 --> 14:09.520]  street from where Obama was or he was scheduled to have a speech and first the
[14:09.520 --> 14:13.480]  Secret Service ordered the local riot police to push him down the road and then
[14:13.480 --> 14:17.320]  down the street even further and then they ordered him just to completely not
[14:17.320 --> 14:23.400]  allowed to demonstrate and the citizens started singing God bless America and the
[14:23.400 --> 14:28.480]  police became so embarrassed that their commander said that's it forget it and
[14:28.480 --> 14:33.640]  they marched off okay we push these people a mile away from where Obama's
[14:33.640 --> 14:38.080]  gonna be and now the Secret Service says just completely violate the First
[14:38.080 --> 14:43.600]  Amendment I'm not gonna do it and it's that spirit of saying I'm not gonna be
[14:43.600 --> 14:48.000]  part of this I'm not gonna violate people's rights that's what's gonna stop
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.280]  the New World Order right there but I've seen that with the Secret Service
[14:51.280 --> 14:54.840]  myself I've seen it so many demonstrations so many rallies first
[14:54.840 --> 14:58.240]  they say go to the end of the street over there I've had New York police do
[14:58.240 --> 15:00.840]  this to me not just the Secret Service and then you go to the corner and then
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.760]  they say go down that street now I remember the case in Philadelphia where
[15:05.760 --> 15:09.240]  they arrested a bunch of preachers who were protesting a gay rights parade and
[15:09.240 --> 15:12.560]  regardless of which side of that issue you're on they should have the right to
[15:12.560 --> 15:15.960]  protest it but they did arrest them they did charge them and then that got
[15:15.960 --> 15:20.120]  overturned in federal court but it was the same thing on the video there they
[15:20.120 --> 15:25.160]  said okay you can't be right here beside the the well it wasn't just a gay
[15:25.160 --> 15:30.360]  parade that was part of it it was a whole festival they were having a giant
[15:30.360 --> 15:34.080]  festival and they said okay you can't be part of the open-air city sponsored
[15:34.080 --> 15:38.080]  festival you can't be here you got to go down the street and then well now you
[15:38.080 --> 15:41.160]  can't even be down the street you got to go around the block and then they said
[15:41.160 --> 15:47.840]  you know what no protest and they arrested them no protest but notice that
[15:47.840 --> 15:53.080]  when the illegal aliens in Arizona last Friday and I'm sure a lot of you've
[15:53.080 --> 15:56.840]  seen the video now it's been on local news national news is pretty much had a
[15:56.840 --> 16:00.880]  blackout on it but it's all over YouTube we posted the videos you just search the
[16:00.880 --> 16:07.000]  term illegal aliens riot in Arizona I mean they were throwing full cans of
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.160]  soda at people that can really that could kill you it hits you in the temple
[16:11.160 --> 16:14.520]  I mean that's a dangerous weapon they were throwing bottles of water they were
[16:14.520 --> 16:20.120]  hitting people and the cops just stood there and took it you do that and you're
[16:20.120 --> 16:25.120]  a citizen you are gonna get beat to death probably and if you're lucky you'll
[16:25.120 --> 16:28.280]  just be beaten within an inch of your life and sent to the hospital and then
[16:28.280 --> 16:34.720]  you're gonna be charged with assaulting the police now I'm gonna say it again
[16:34.720 --> 16:39.680]  I'm I've always called for non-violence if you do hit a cop in the head with a
[16:39.680 --> 16:43.440]  can of Coca-Cola you probably should get cracked over the head with the Billy
[16:43.440 --> 16:49.000]  Club I mean you're assaulting them if you assault me if you come to my office or
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.240]  my house or if I'm walking out of a restaurant somebody walks up and tries
[16:52.240 --> 16:56.560]  to mug me and punches me in the face or hits me in the head with a club I'm
[16:56.560 --> 17:04.800]  gonna hit them right back and so why are the police so scared to death to even
[17:04.800 --> 17:08.560]  defend themselves from illegal aliens why does the National Guard run from
[17:08.560 --> 17:13.040]  illegal alien groups when they shoot at them or when Mexican troops come across
[17:13.040 --> 17:18.160]  and shoot at them I mean that's been in the news many many many times why why
[17:18.160 --> 17:25.120]  has our military and our police been told to roll over to this and why have
[17:25.120 --> 17:29.160]  they been told to attack dog the American people they're told you can
[17:29.160 --> 17:33.100]  attack dog the American people and we'll back you up all the way but any of you
[17:33.100 --> 17:39.400]  officers do anything to these illegal aliens you're going to get demoted
[17:39.400 --> 17:45.080]  you're going to get sent home without pay you might even get fired and that's
[17:45.080 --> 17:50.440]  on record that that is going on you have to ask yourselves why is that so we'll
[17:50.440 --> 17:55.960]  also talk more about that coming up at the broadcast today if I have time I'm
[17:55.960 --> 18:00.720]  going to play the whole eight-minute speech to the Council on Foreign Relations
[18:00.720 --> 18:09.800]  that happened just a few days ago but the article is up on prisonplanet.com
[18:09.800 --> 18:15.280]  Trichette calls for corrupt Bank of International Settlements to boss global
[18:15.280 --> 18:20.800]  government in CFR speech and he said global government global governance is
[18:20.800 --> 18:23.880]  here we've got to have this new banking structure that will control the planet
[18:23.880 --> 18:31.240]  and he just went on and on and on calling for world government run by the
[18:31.240 --> 18:34.240]  banks which is exactly what the globalists have always said they would
[18:34.240 --> 18:39.760]  do then meanwhile I had nightline here earlier this week and I would go try to
[18:39.760 --> 18:45.680]  show them video clips of Gordon Brown Herman von Roompi calling for world
[18:45.680 --> 18:49.160]  government and they were not interested in it and I finally made him watch one
[18:49.160 --> 18:51.920]  clip and he said well that's a different type of global government they're
[18:51.920 --> 18:56.520]  talking about this is the denial all these years there's no global government
[18:56.520 --> 19:01.240]  we're crazy it doesn't exist and then now they're out in the open and the media
[19:01.240 --> 19:04.960]  says well but that's a different global government than what you're talking
[19:04.960 --> 19:10.400]  about I mean it's this denial that they're in they've got their position
[19:10.400 --> 19:15.280]  they're sticking to it because there there cannot be a real debate in this
[19:15.280 --> 19:20.440]  country about the global government that has been formed and whether it's
[19:20.440 --> 19:23.960]  preemptive wars against Iraq and Iran and Afghanistan or whether it's the
[19:23.960 --> 19:28.360]  Patriot Act and naked body scanners or cell phones tracking everywhere you go
[19:28.360 --> 19:31.600]  or laptops watching your kids at home with the government watching them
[19:31.600 --> 19:39.000]  without warrants or open borders it's all globalist policy it's all globalist
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.800]  policy on record we have their white papers we have their plans we have their
[19:43.800 --> 19:48.360]  blueprints we had their blueprints decades ago we knew what they were going
[19:48.360 --> 19:52.200]  to build now they've built the stinking thing and they're putting the final
[19:52.200 --> 19:57.520]  fixtures in the house of tyranny we'll be right back with your phone calls stay
[19:57.520 --> 20:03.840]  with us it's no secret why pharmaceutical companies and mainstream
[20:03.840 --> 20:08.440]  media often question the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements but
[20:08.440 --> 20:11.920]  isn't it ironic that mainstream pharmaceutical companies are the ones

[21:12.840 --> 21:16.800]  stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social security
[21:16.800 --> 21:21.120]  would be there for you that's not what's happening you might even pass on gold if
[21:21.120 --> 21:24.840]  the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't
[21:24.840 --> 21:29.400]  lose value or that your retirement would be secure if all looks rosy to you then

[22:30.360 --> 22:34.640]  stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government I believe
[22:34.640 --> 22:38.480]  first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the
[22:38.480 --> 22:42.680]  global financial system global governance with the establishment of the G20 so

[24:15.760 --> 24:21.320]  this hour and the second hour but I also want to play a clip that we played a
[24:21.320 --> 24:29.720]  month ago of Bill Gates at Ted TV it's like a Al Gore propaganda type channel
[24:29.720 --> 24:34.480]  where they have these little speeches where he talked about vaccinating the
[24:34.480 --> 24:40.080]  population reduce the human population and how we must cut CO2 emissions to
[24:40.080 --> 24:44.440]  zero when humans are exhaling CO2 and it's a life-giving gas I mean I have
[24:44.440 --> 24:48.960]  NASA here very excited that they found high levels of methane from their
[24:48.960 --> 24:55.720]  latest probes in the atmosphere of Mars and they know there's water there on the
[24:55.720 --> 25:01.280]  ice caps and you normally only have a methane on a planet like Mars if there's
[25:01.280 --> 25:06.160]  life methane is put off by life but here they're declaring methane toxic and
[25:06.160 --> 25:16.120]  evil all animal life releases methane type gases that's what happens when you
[25:16.120 --> 25:23.200]  pass gas ladies and gentlemen it's part of the process of life it's just to watch
[25:23.200 --> 25:29.760]  Bill Gates up there and I they had another PR person and another speech
[25:29.760 --> 25:33.360]  from Ted TV I want to play a clip of talking about how wonderful it's going
[25:33.360 --> 25:38.400]  to be when the government DNA tests you and decides what job you're going to
[25:38.400 --> 25:47.000]  have that is brave new world that is the ultimate class system where the
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.080]  government decides what type of person you are from your DNA why do you think
[25:52.080 --> 25:56.320]  for 37 plus years they've been taking babies blood globally in almost every
[25:56.320 --> 26:00.200]  major nation under the IMF World Bank control and putting it in secret
[26:00.200 --> 26:03.640]  databases they now admit it is a eugenics database all right I'm already
[26:03.640 --> 26:12.080]  digressing this is this is so real this is so real what's happening
[26:12.080 --> 26:16.760]  Herman in New York thanks for holding her on the air yes hello Alex can you
[26:16.760 --> 26:21.640]  hear me yes sir yes I have one comment in two questions all right my first
[26:21.640 --> 26:26.040]  comment is pretty much the black media is all over the place trying to marginalized
[26:26.040 --> 26:30.880]  a tea party saying that they're racist and you know here they go again dividing
[26:30.880 --> 26:35.600]  you know dividing us and it's pretty much just so counterproductive when
[26:35.600 --> 26:39.720]  everybody can see that has nothing to do with the race at all and my first
[26:39.720 --> 26:46.240]  question pretty much is the next the false flag whether it's nuclear or
[26:46.240 --> 26:53.320]  however the next major false flag do you think it'll have the same effect as 9
[26:53.320 --> 27:01.160]  11 that's my first question and my second question is the do you think this
[27:01.160 --> 27:06.360]  will be the opportunity to be more pretty much as overt as ever just out in
[27:06.360 --> 27:09.840]  the open and they're pretty much saying it now declaring it now but will they be
[27:09.840 --> 27:17.360]  you know as overt as ever and just out in the open thank you thank you
[27:17.360 --> 27:23.440]  Oklahoma has a new law where if you were in a militia you get arrested which
[27:23.440 --> 27:31.960]  violates the freedom of assembly and the freedom to meet with citizens and the
[27:31.960 --> 27:38.480]  the militia is in the Constitution it's in the Bill of Rights and I'm going to
[27:38.480 --> 27:46.840]  cover that later I mean it's such an amazing statement and they've passed the
[27:46.840 --> 27:54.760]  bill outlawing militias and recruitment it's like Oklahoma last year passed a
[27:54.760 --> 27:57.760]  law that you can't have burglar bars on your house I mean Oklahoma's got some
[27:57.760 --> 28:01.440]  serious problems it's got some good people some of the best but also some of
[28:01.440 --> 28:09.000]  the worst and to answer your question that's where we're headed where they're
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.840]  just going to ban free assembly and they're going to ban tea parties if they
[28:12.840 --> 28:19.400]  get their way I mean we have a whole slew of White House Zars Sunstein and
[28:19.400 --> 28:24.560]  others cast Sunstein saying ban conspiracy theories ban criticizing the
[28:24.560 --> 28:30.720]  government and he lists some of the most broad issues he can to set the
[28:30.720 --> 28:36.720]  benchmark he says you will not be able to write or say that sunlight is good for
[28:36.720 --> 28:42.080]  you he actually says that you will not be able to criticize anthropogenic
[28:42.080 --> 28:48.320]  global warming or man make global warming I mean these are quotes so we
[28:48.320 --> 28:52.640]  got the diversities are calling for Hugo Chavez style censorship here in the
[28:52.640 --> 28:59.680]  United States it's got to be in its teens I haven't counted them up but it's
[28:59.680 --> 29:03.400]  more than 10 senators have called for the fairness doctrine to restrict free
[29:03.400 --> 29:11.400]  speech on talk radio you know I don't know exactly what type of false flag
[29:11.400 --> 29:15.360]  they're going to run or how big it's going to be and I don't know if it'll
[29:15.360 --> 29:20.400]  dwarf 9-11 but we know they're hyping nuclear false flag terror we know they're
[29:20.400 --> 29:23.880]  hyping that tea parties are going to commit attacks so I think it's going to
[29:23.880 --> 29:29.400]  be a cocktail of staged events you don't we come back I'll comment on this
[29:29.400 --> 29:34.120]  more it's a very important question and as for the so-called black media that
[29:34.120 --> 29:39.840]  you brought up African-American media black folks ought to be asking them why
[29:39.840 --> 29:43.160]  don't they talk about how 50 plus percent of blacks are ever born in this
[29:43.160 --> 29:46.760]  country I mean well a lot of talk about some real issues that actually affect
[29:46.760 --> 29:51.040]  the black community now they're just there to keep people stirred up we're
[29:51.040 --> 29:59.400]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:52.720 --> 33:55.520]  anti-trust program by the way and it was involved in the prosecution of the
[33:55.520 --> 34:00.080]  Nazis so this is a prestigious person telling you this the first instance of
[34:00.080 --> 34:03.600]  Florida drinking water in history was in Germany's Nazi prison camps that
[34:03.600 --> 34:06.960]  Gestapo had little concern about fluoride supposed effect on children's
[34:06.960 --> 34:10.680]  teeth the reason for mass medicating water and sodium fluoride was to
[34:10.680 --> 34:14.560]  sterilize humans and force the people in the concentration camps into calm
[34:14.560 --> 34:21.440]  submission see when we get up here and tell you that fluoride attacks all the
[34:21.440 --> 34:26.800]  organs reduces fertility and can sterilize and and and doubles the chance
[34:26.800 --> 34:30.920]  of bone cancer alone you need to go do the research instead of laughing about
[34:30.920 --> 34:35.840]  this I know we have new listeners every day every minute tuning in this is not
[34:35.840 --> 34:39.320]  funny I had nightline here two days ago and I was trying to show them these
[34:39.320 --> 34:44.720]  documents and they were just laughing about it it's not funny and one of
[34:44.720 --> 34:48.720]  these guys had a has a son and they were nice people I don't think they're
[34:48.720 --> 34:54.120]  evil they just think we're crazy it doesn't matter if you get inside one of
[34:54.120 --> 34:59.240]  these plants and on the sacks of fluoride it says deadly poison causes organ
[34:59.240 --> 35:04.160]  failure and it's one of the most cumulative toxins out there it builds up
[35:04.160 --> 35:07.560]  in the body I'm already ranting about this and I said I was gonna go to your
[35:07.560 --> 35:12.640]  calls but I thought I would talk about that Joseph Borkin was the chief
[35:12.640 --> 35:15.840]  economic advisor of the antitrust division the justice department I was
[35:15.840 --> 35:21.240]  responsible for the wartime investigation of IG Farben and he wrote
[35:21.240 --> 35:29.040]  several books on the subject and look I mean it's a fact and the Nazis learned
[35:29.040 --> 35:36.080]  this in 37 from the Soviets that's who they learned about it from and then they
[35:36.080 --> 35:42.080]  of course knew from US research I found in 1934 University of Texas study where
[35:42.080 --> 35:45.860]  they were looking at fluoride in rats and they said this could be a sedative and
[35:45.860 --> 35:50.360]  this could be used in mental patients but it has toxic effects on the organs
[35:50.360 --> 35:55.440]  and bones and attacks fertility so they said we don't recommend it be used for
[35:55.440 --> 36:00.320]  that I mean you could pull up these studies all day long they knew they put
[36:00.320 --> 36:05.360]  it in your water that's why Americans can't get upset won't get involved all
[36:05.360 --> 36:07.600]  right I'm gonna go back to your calls here in a moment I wanted to bring up the
[36:07.600 --> 36:12.360]  CEO of a cola blue after I just discussed this Jerome Janden because
[36:12.360 --> 36:15.960]  this is the best atmospheric water generator line out there and they're
[36:15.960 --> 36:20.320]  also the most affordable and it's what I use in my office and my home and Jerome
[36:20.320 --> 36:26.800]  it's good to have you up with us today you know I noticed that when you were
[36:26.800 --> 36:29.680]  talking to one of the guys here in the office that you guys had brought up a
[36:29.680 --> 36:33.960]  Joseph Borkin who I was well aware of but it's good to talk to folks at a
[36:33.960 --> 36:38.280]  cola blue who are aware of this thanks a lot yes we are that's why we're in this
[36:38.280 --> 36:43.800]  business well I mean let's talk a little bit about the a cola blue and the fact
[36:43.800 --> 36:48.120]  that it's one of the only water purification systems that has zero
[36:48.120 --> 36:53.080]  fluoride in it because even the best filtration systems that you filter tap
[36:53.080 --> 36:58.400]  water through fluoride is such a small small particulate that that almost no
[36:58.400 --> 37:03.080]  filter on earth can take it out one of the only ways to really get it out is to
[37:03.080 --> 37:08.420]  get clean water out of the air that's true I mean we're more than the
[37:08.420 --> 37:12.200]  filtration you know we just generate water that's what people are confused
[37:12.200 --> 37:17.880]  the cola blue is the only only solution you know to this that poison and water
[37:17.880 --> 37:23.540]  and purification water we do not take water to purify to filter it we generate
[37:23.540 --> 37:29.040]  water from the humidity of the air so you're 100% for bacteria 100% fluoride
[37:29.040 --> 37:34.960]  you know free and 100% independent from the system absolutely and when I say
[37:34.960 --> 37:38.760]  filter even after you grab out of the air you send it there's seven to twelve
[37:38.760 --> 37:42.120]  filters depending on what unit that's true you're right sorry I miss on the
[37:42.120 --> 37:46.800]  studio you're totally right and three UV as well to kill any kind of bacteria so
[37:46.800 --> 37:51.560]  you're totally free to drink it to board it for coffee or tea and trust me it
[37:51.560 --> 37:56.120]  does much better than tap water and on top of that you can use it for newborn
[37:56.120 --> 38:02.480]  and I've got a five weeks old girl and I give it to her as avoid me to make
[38:02.480 --> 38:07.080]  shopping and to get some bottle water which is dangerous for the pollution and
[38:07.080 --> 38:14.880]  for our nature well to be clear here again it is a water generator it grabs
[38:14.880 --> 38:17.840]  it out of the air but then it sends it through the filtration system but you're
[38:17.840 --> 38:22.920]  right you're not filtering the tap water or some lake water you are grabbing
[38:22.920 --> 38:26.480]  the already the cleanest purest water there is out of the atmosphere that's
[38:26.480 --> 38:31.240]  what the clouds are and then putting it through filtration systems tell folks
[38:31.240 --> 38:35.880]  about some of the products available from a color blue.com right now we've got
[38:35.880 --> 38:42.160]  the EB-28 you know which is a special machine with special you know a special
[38:42.160 --> 38:49.760]  prize for you guys and they call blue 28 and really available at $9.99 you know
[38:49.760 --> 38:54.880]  $9.99 and especially for you Alex and for your audience you know we just give
[38:54.880 --> 39:01.600]  two years filter package which is a $150 saving that's right now today only for
[39:01.600 --> 39:11.200]  you and it's available on a color blue.com you know Jerome yeah I've been
[39:11.200 --> 39:15.040]  promoting this I think for about three years now I know that I have one and use
[39:15.040 --> 39:19.520]  it I know absolutely and I don't think I've ever seen you guys offer savings I
[39:19.520 --> 39:26.720]  mean normally it's around $1,200 for the great unit but $9.99 is already a huge
[39:26.720 --> 39:35.760]  discount and then you add a two-year extra filter package. So I think this is
[39:35.760 --> 39:40.640]  the best deal I've ever seen you offer. But you know what we have to play the game
[39:40.640 --> 39:44.800]  and as my point you know you're aware about the water pollution on this
[39:44.800 --> 39:49.920]  planet and its nation as well are you aware that you as consumers the first
[39:49.920 --> 39:54.520]  in the world to consume in the bottled water and the bottle is in plastic it's
[39:54.520 --> 39:59.000]  coming from oil you know it generates a huge pollution in our country and in the
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.200]  world are you aware that there is you know a garbage patch in the ocean
[40:03.200 --> 40:10.000]  Pacific which is big only with bottled water big as twice takes us by. Yeah
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.120]  there's a giant floating island of just garbage that thing. Exactly and the
[40:14.120 --> 40:18.320]  salty water just you know I would say desegregates a little bit you know the
[40:18.320 --> 40:24.480]  bottle plastic of the bottle so it's oily around it's all full it's 870,000
[40:24.480 --> 40:31.160]  square miles. You go on Google you go ocean Pacific garbage patch you die and
[40:31.160 --> 40:35.320]  you will see videos and pictures you won't believe it. So just to avoid that
[40:35.320 --> 40:39.280]  and to avoid you know just you know generate more pollution for your kids
[40:39.280 --> 40:43.840]  and for your nation and you got free water as you know we mentioned and
[40:43.840 --> 40:47.760]  we precise you and I and the Gannon you know the price for the Gannon the
[40:47.760 --> 40:52.640]  widest machine is around 20 cents. 20 cents a Gannon whatever you go in the
[40:52.640 --> 40:57.680]  mall in your state the best price you got is 99 cents a Gannon 80% discount on
[40:57.680 --> 41:03.480]  the free water bacteria and no for right. Well Jerome there's another issue here
[41:03.480 --> 41:08.560]  yeah the plastics they're using in most the bottled water companies are the
[41:08.560 --> 41:13.760]  type that leech estrogen mimicers which is another big problem and that's why
[41:13.760 --> 41:18.080]  our girls are going into puberty at eight nine ten years old when they're
[41:18.080 --> 41:22.880]  supposed to go into puberty around 13 to 14 and the boys are being feminized so
[41:22.880 --> 41:26.760]  it's also very important not to drink out of plastic containers if you can
[41:26.760 --> 41:30.880]  avoid it that's why here in the office we use paper cups. Yeah totally great
[41:30.880 --> 41:34.640]  totally true and people are not aware about that that's so true and you know I
[41:34.640 --> 41:38.680]  think it's one another you know in your other system we try to make human beings
[41:38.680 --> 41:43.120]  nothing more with gender like that don't have any roots any attached you know
[41:43.120 --> 41:47.920]  just to defend yourself totally great yeah making us docile and I travel a
[41:47.920 --> 41:52.600]  lot and I really appreciate the fact that you shake the world on really
[41:52.600 --> 41:55.840]  appreciate that. Well we appreciate you Jerome I want to tell people about the
[41:55.840 --> 41:59.960]  savings and you guys do the special once a month this is the biggest savings I've
[41:59.960 --> 42:05.360]  ever seen they've discounted the unit by what looks like $200 and $150 in free
[42:05.360 --> 42:11.200]  replacement filters for the water generator and so that's just an amazing
[42:11.200 --> 42:17.320]  deal ladies and gentlemen it's running through Sunday May 2nd 2010
[42:17.320 --> 42:25.000]  1-800-691-6043 1-800-691-6043 or a coloblue.com
[42:25.000 --> 42:32.000]  ECOLOBLUE.com a coloblue.com 800-691-6043 and next time you come back
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.920]  Jerome I will talk about more about what's happening in the US
[42:34.920 --> 42:39.400]  infrastructure and how we're being basically sterilized by design thanks
[42:39.400 --> 42:42.200]  for spending time with us which pleasure you welcome thanks to you Alex you
[42:42.200 --> 42:48.640]  but good to have you on sir and you know what folks look I just hope you'll go
[42:48.640 --> 42:58.160]  look up the fact that Joseph Borkin and Charles Welsh wrote Germany's master
[42:58.160 --> 43:03.960]  plan 1943 he was an expert on Germany he was the chief economic advisor of the
[43:03.960 --> 43:08.440]  antitrust division of the Department of Justice then decades later in the mid
[43:08.440 --> 43:14.920]  70s he wrote a book about IG Farben with the documents that they had been able
[43:14.920 --> 43:20.600]  to get a hold of and of course that was the crime and punishment of IG Farben
[43:20.600 --> 43:27.960]  and they have the documents in the book our government took over Germany and
[43:27.960 --> 43:33.200]  took all their ideas of eugenics and took it back to the United States and it
[43:33.200 --> 43:39.520]  went underground everything going on in our society is about eugenics watch my
[43:39.520 --> 43:42.320]  film in game blueprint for global enslavement okay I'm gonna shut up and
[43:42.320 --> 43:45.560]  get off the subject for now later I'm gonna get into the times of London
[43:45.560 --> 43:50.360]  doctors sterilize Uzbek women by stealth and so you see this article by itself
[43:50.360 --> 43:57.320]  you go well that's Uzbekistan or Uzbekistan there's so many stands but
[43:57.320 --> 44:03.320]  no it's it's everywhere I mean in Masters of Terror I show government documents
[44:03.320 --> 44:09.040]  where they secretly sterilized Native American women 40 plus percent of them
[44:09.040 --> 44:14.120]  just in the 60s and 70s and and I got emails saying well how do you secretly
[44:14.120 --> 44:19.520]  sterilize somebody well they describe it here you go in for a checkup and they
[44:19.520 --> 44:26.080]  give you a shot and knock you out and then they clip your tubes and in some
[44:26.080 --> 44:30.680]  cases they go ahead and just cut your entire uterus out and that's in the news
[44:30.680 --> 44:40.320]  today but it doesn't just go on in foreign countries it's not just happening
[44:40.320 --> 44:47.080]  to Uzbek women in Uzbekistan it's Uzbekistan I mean here's another one
[44:47.080 --> 44:52.080]  Sky News China to sterilize 10,000 people in just one area forcibly to curb
[44:52.080 --> 44:56.600]  births forcibly sterilizing the police come to your door and drag you away
[44:56.600 --> 45:04.400]  alright alright that's this just has to stop ladies and gentlemen you everything
[45:04.400 --> 45:07.800]  they're setting up is about carrying the sound and all these yuppies say good
[45:07.800 --> 45:11.920]  get rid of the Chinese you know get rid of the Uzbek women you know get rid of
[45:11.920 --> 45:16.920]  the Native American women you know gut them it's being done to you through the
[45:16.920 --> 45:22.600]  water supply dummy why do you think all you yuppie women I mean the numbers are
[45:22.600 --> 45:26.760]  off the charts can't have children you're 30 years old your husband's got a
[45:26.760 --> 45:32.400]  good sperm count he can't get you pregnant because fluoride has fried you
[45:32.400 --> 45:39.800]  all right going back to that caller's question about when will they stage a
[45:39.800 --> 45:46.680]  false flag what type will it be all I can go off of is the pathology the
[45:46.680 --> 45:52.320]  the the the pathological activities of the globalists now they do the same
[45:52.320 --> 45:56.040]  thing over and over again and they're preconditioning for the public ahead of
[45:56.040 --> 45:59.200]  attacks and I've never seen such preconditioning ahead of the attack
[45:59.200 --> 46:03.600]  they're preparing people for nukes to go off for race war mass shootings and
[46:03.600 --> 46:07.840]  bombings of federal buildings and IRS buildings and they can provocateur some
[46:07.840 --> 46:12.200]  mental patient to do it out of prison they'll do it they may provocateur it or
[46:12.200 --> 46:15.640]  they may completely stage it generally they completely stage it but I would tell
[46:15.640 --> 46:21.440]  police and military and IRS workers you better be watching maintenance crews you
[46:21.440 --> 46:29.080]  better be watching people with federal passes because 90 plus percent chance if
[46:29.080 --> 46:33.240]  there's an event it's going to be staged and it's going to be an inside job so you
[46:33.240 --> 46:37.800]  see people in the maintenance hatch you know with gray sticks or butter one
[46:37.800 --> 46:42.720]  night you better do a YouTube video immediately and call the and then call
[46:42.720 --> 46:46.320]  the media and run around the street screaming because if you because the
[46:46.320 --> 46:50.800]  NSA before an operation is watching everyone in your federal building okay
[46:50.800 --> 46:55.400]  they're watching and they're always doing it under a drill so the guys at NSA
[46:55.400 --> 46:58.600]  don't even know they're about to stage a terror attack they think oh we're we're
[46:58.600 --> 47:01.960]  watching the federal building part of a drill you'll have a controller above them
[47:01.960 --> 47:06.840]  that's getting the main feeds and they hear John Smith at the federal building
[47:06.840 --> 47:10.560]  calling the newspaper that night John Smith and his family are going to be
[47:10.560 --> 47:14.400]  killed by burglars one hour later they had hit teams in every city they just
[47:14.400 --> 47:19.680]  send out the message give them a photo of the targets and they tell them what
[47:19.680 --> 47:24.120]  code to go with make it look like a burglary homicide or they give them
[47:24.120 --> 47:28.320]  another code and say you know whatever the spy controller decides whatever the
[47:28.320 --> 47:32.160]  black ops commander decides they may give the killers a code to go in and
[47:32.160 --> 47:35.200]  kill the family and say the husbands killed the family and then committed
[47:35.200 --> 47:39.480]  suicide so if you are in a federal building and you and you happen to see
[47:39.480 --> 47:45.720]  black ops getting ready to stage an attack you better put it on YouTube you
[47:45.720 --> 47:50.000]  better go to the newspaper you better call in the talk radio you better
[47:50.000 --> 47:55.560]  immediately before you talk to anybody point blank range get the story out or
[47:55.560 --> 47:59.200]  they will come by your house and murder you and your family and they'll still
[47:59.200 --> 48:03.400]  blow up the federal building the next day you understand this is black ops you
[48:03.400 --> 48:07.400]  were all under surveillance and they're preparing a kill off I'll guarantee it
[48:07.400 --> 48:11.960]  you're on military bases you're in police departments you better watch your
[48:11.960 --> 48:17.240]  back you're all targets right now of your loving banker run filthy government
[48:17.240 --> 48:26.520]  I'm sick of it Jonathan in Kansas you're on the air go ahead yes on YouTube there's
[48:26.520 --> 48:34.360]  a video of Fox morning news or whatever and it shows we tolerate the
[48:34.360 --> 48:40.080]  cultivation of opium poppies it's on YouTube and you type in we talk about
[48:40.080 --> 48:46.320]  tolerate the cult cultivation of opium poppies that's a good good tip guys go
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.640]  to YouTube we cultivate the the cultivation of poppies you know I told
[48:50.640 --> 48:54.960]  you I mean I don't know if you heard that show Jonathan but somebody could pull
[48:54.960 --> 48:57.880]  it up because everything on the BBC's archive I guess it was probably eight
[48:57.880 --> 49:04.240]  months ago now I've literally slowed down and almost ran off the road because
[49:04.240 --> 49:09.720]  they just admitted basically we grow the opium we let them ship it out and but
[49:09.720 --> 49:14.080]  that's a good thing and and then in Reuters what a month ago I had the
[49:14.080 --> 49:17.320]  headline that the Russians wanted to eradicate the poppies in the US said no
[49:17.320 --> 49:21.680]  and and see that's what's so sick about it I mean they ship the heroin and
[49:21.680 --> 49:26.280]  cocaine in publicly pretty soon they'll have the government shipping and in and
[49:26.280 --> 49:30.920]  saying we sell it but we still put you in prison I'm sorry go ahead yes also I
[49:30.920 --> 49:37.080]  have I can tell you something about immigration because I went through it
[49:37.080 --> 49:44.040]  and I noticed something it's it's ran by Homeland Security and I work I went
[49:44.040 --> 49:49.800]  there several times before and they would pack it would be packed with people
[49:49.800 --> 49:58.640]  literally it was so like inefficient they would put their own people on hold for
[49:58.640 --> 50:02.520]  hours when they talked to because they have different places where they handle
[50:02.520 --> 50:09.240]  things also the courts that they have in there it's like kangaroo courts because

[54:38.200 --> 54:42.360]  you were talking about going through immigration well one point I want to
[54:42.360 --> 54:48.800]  throw in here is it's been noted that Europeans and even Japanese anybody who
[54:48.800 --> 54:52.960]  comes from wealthy country it's very hard to emigrate to the United States but
[54:52.960 --> 54:56.000]  if you come from a poor country they make it a little bit easier and that's
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.200]  because those European nations are seeing mass exoduses of people to get
[55:00.200 --> 55:04.880]  away from high taxes so they have quiet agreements with England and Germany and
[55:04.880 --> 55:08.640]  France and others to make it hard for them to emigrate to the United States
[55:08.640 --> 55:13.240]  because our taxes are a lot lower than theirs but finish up your story yes I've
[55:13.240 --> 55:19.000]  been living in the US for 20 years and and to work here you have to have a workers
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.640]  permit and they would hike the prices up and now it costs like $400 a year workers
[55:25.640 --> 55:30.320]  permit they would miss permits like you could have one like you can send it out
[55:30.320 --> 55:34.240]  it it takes six months to get it and then they would mess up and it would take
[55:34.240 --> 55:38.880]  like four or five extra months to get another one and you do this I've been
[55:38.880 --> 55:43.640]  doing this for 20 years and then just recently I just became a permanent
[55:43.640 --> 55:51.120]  resident and going through there I've been living 20 years they said for me
[55:51.120 --> 55:55.160]  because I was an immigrant even I've been living in America for 20 years they
[55:55.160 --> 56:00.960]  had me take three different vaccines all at once ones like for smallpox and
[56:00.960 --> 56:06.320]  whatnot it left me bedridden for a week I could not sleep I would go to I would
[56:06.320 --> 56:10.720]  only have 30 minutes of sleep out of 20 hours of laying in the bed I'm sorry to
[56:10.720 --> 56:14.920]  hear that yeah and and now they're trying to make everyone take it to be a
[56:14.920 --> 56:19.640]  cop or to be a nurse or to go to school and they're they're lying and saying
[56:19.640 --> 56:25.960]  it's the law and again vaccines if they were produced properly might be good in
[56:25.960 --> 56:31.000]  some cases but we know that we have a bunch of criminal eugenicists running
[56:31.000 --> 56:37.120]  the medical system so anyone who takes a vaccine is insane Jonathan I'm sorry to
[56:37.120 --> 56:42.400]  hear that that happened to you and you better believe that they're spiking those
[56:42.400 --> 56:46.080]  vaccines in fact I have a stack of mainstream news articles I'm going to
[56:46.080 --> 56:51.360]  cover later about people dying all over the world from vaccines and these aren't
[56:51.360 --> 56:54.320]  articles from the last few months where you've heard me covering it every day
[56:54.320 --> 57:01.040]  this is out today I mean people are saying what is going on you take this
[57:01.040 --> 57:04.680]  stuff and you die or you have a convulsion or you get a neurological
[57:04.680 --> 57:11.440]  disorder because 90 plus percent of the vaccines are now made in China I mean
[57:11.440 --> 57:15.000]  let's talk to Annie in New York Annie you're on the air
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.920]  I like hi Jim and Alex all right you know so far I think everything's been
[57:20.920 --> 57:25.560]  carefully orchestrated and choreographed according to the CFR script but this
[57:25.560 --> 57:30.280]  time I think they've they've really miscalculated there is the wild card
[57:30.280 --> 57:35.200]  which is these uncontrollable radical illegals who've been weaned on the
[57:35.200 --> 57:37.800]  bitter vengeance of finally getting their hands on what they you know
[57:37.800 --> 57:41.920]  wrongfully believe is theirs and they are ready to blow and they don't respect
[57:41.920 --> 57:46.000]  anything or anyone in America and that includes members of the government and
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.480]  law enforcement so I think they've bitten off a little more the globalists
[57:50.480 --> 57:55.560]  than they can share and I just think everything's gonna blow sky high well I
[57:55.560 --> 57:59.320]  agree that we're definitely entering the maximum dangerous zone here in the
[57:59.320 --> 58:03.920]  next few years maybe even the next few months and even the RNC is saying that
[58:03.920 --> 58:07.720]  Obama is playing the race card and that's what he's doing in speeches now and
[58:07.720 --> 58:11.520]  this is very very dangerous but I think there's a method of the madness I mean
[58:11.520 --> 58:17.800]  that's why the CFR and the SPP have both said that they will use immigration
[58:17.800 --> 58:22.680]  crises to then try to pass immigration reform that will basically just merge
[58:22.680 --> 58:27.720]  the North American continent but I appreciate your call and we do have
[58:27.720 --> 58:32.000]  some news on that in fact this Trichette calls for corrupt BIS to boss
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.240]  global government and CFR speech that's coming up the next hour and he says
[58:36.240 --> 58:41.440]  they've planned the whole world government and they're gonna go ahead and launch it

[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:28.960]  Jones okay I am going to cover a mountain of important news including
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:34.880]  Council on Foreign Relations speech that was given by Jean-Claude Trichette the
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.960]  head of the European Central Bank openly admitting they have been setting up a
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.000]  coordinated global government takeover for decades and that they now must go
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.880]  ahead and go forward with it meaning things are not going well for these
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.400]  scumbags and if we identify them as the enemy of humanity and point out all the
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.680]  crimes they've committed that they're a bunch of parasite control freaks it's
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:59.880]  game over for them so that is coming up but I want to continue with your phone
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.440]  calls now John in Illinois you're on the air good morning Alex this is John we
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.600]  are change Chicago the other week you quoted Lord Acton where you said power
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:14.640]  tends to corrupt an absolute power corrupts absolutely a very famous quote
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.280]  but did you know the rest of the quote and it's this has always been truncated
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.520]  but this is the most important part this is what he goes on to say and
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:29.080]  remember where you have a concentration of power in a few hands all too
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:36.000]  frequently men with the mentality of gangsters get control history has proven
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.920]  that he said that over a hundred years ago yes he did and yes I had seen the
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:48.880]  full quote and any true statesman any philosopher any researcher knows that
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.760]  that is the 100% rule you will always get a tyranny when you build a big
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.880]  government it's normally built by tyrants to control but even if a big
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:02.680]  government's built by altruistic people paving the road to hell with good
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:11.400]  intentions the mechanism is always seized by tyrannous can I put out a
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.280]  quick shout to our we are changed and your listeners here in Chicago do whatever

[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:30.240]  that 9-11 truth is out in the open in Europe but it's still a big secret here

[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.320]  are doing it in a premeditated operation I wasn't familiar with the
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.920]  situation in Arizona that that had been going on that's par for the course and

[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:41.880]  Thursday the 29th day of April 2010 I'm going back to your phone calls now let's
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:48.400]  go ahead and speak to Kevin in California you're on the air yeah hi Alex
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:54.880]  on the recent discussion about the immigration laws in Arizona has been
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.840]  like a double-edged sword for me oh at the same time I'm happy that someone is
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:07.480]  addressing it I realized how much anger I have as someone who was born and raised
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:14.400]  in Los Angeles and the reality of what I've seen since my childhood happened in
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:19.480]  this country or happened to the city and how much it's falling apart here well
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:24.960]  that's the issue is that Latin America is falling apart and is hellish the
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:29.800]  people are good people but they're under tyranny and they all have their
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:35.880]  arguments for wanting to come here and and and their reasons the the issue is
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.840]  the globalist on record are using them to bankrupt the country and drive down
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:46.480]  wages and we've seen what it's doing to the United States and so we must tie a
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:52.680]  tourniquet on our leg we must do it now there are excuse me I said six point five
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.640]  billion it's now six point eight five billion people worldwide only three
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:01.880]  hundred million of that six point eight plus billion live here and billions of
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.760]  people want to come here and and and maybe we could have billions of people
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:11.440]  come here if we didn't have welfare but we cannot pay for the welfare of these
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.720]  illegal aliens and many of them are on massive welfare that is on record go
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:22.560]  ahead this place has been hit like a bomb okay this is about they say a few
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.800]  hundred thousand in Arizona or in around that area you we're talking about
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:33.160]  millions here I I can literally give you examples my my apartment manager where
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:37.720]  I rent is not here legally I could walk down the street and see 12 people at the
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.120]  gas station hanging out right down the street I could go to the home depot
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:45.440]  right right down the street from that and there's 20 hanging out I look I am I'm
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.120]  an employer I have my own business that want to put an ad in the paper for
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.240]  someone to do a certain skill for me the illegal immigrants they jump on the ad
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:58.120]  they call you immediately they fight for the spot you can't really hire anyone
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.200]  without them trying to finagle the paperwork it's it's like it's gotten
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:07.720]  so out of hand I was in downtown Los Angeles yesterday and for literally a
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:14.000]  three-mile radius in each direction it's just it's like Mexico it's not it
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.960]  doesn't even resemble the United States anymore everyone here is on different
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:24.480]  languages this is like a land that and it's not just Hispanic it's Armenian
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:30.440]  Filipino Korean it's all kind no one is speaking the same language no one is on
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:35.960]  the same page there's no communication here it's like a land of limbo and the
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:41.080]  government's jacking up taxes on the middle class that is disappearing they've
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:45.720]  got the votes and and and for whatever reason immigrants unless they're from
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:49.800]  the eastern block they tend to have lived under hardcore tyranny so they
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:55.560]  know freedom but other than those groups the immigrants tend to vote we're
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:12:00.040]  talking nine times out of ten if you look at the numbers for gun control for
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:05.920]  big government for socialism and so it's a game over they bring in masses of
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:13.200]  people they stick a government mammary gland in their face and just say suck us
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:20.080]  dry and I mean the country may not be able to be saved regardless but we know
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:25.840]  if we don't shut it down it's over yes yes I I would just like to implore
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:31.720]  people please please if anyone knows anyone in government anyone that can
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:36.200]  do anything about this remind them about the problem in Los Angeles this place
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:41.320]  is is falling over the years and it's like this one of the saddest things look
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:45.280]  it's your mayor I mean he's a Mexican supremacist who when we've played the
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:50.960]  audio and video here where he makes fun of America says go home pilgrim or he
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.720]  says all this racist stuff and again I'm against the Klan but I'm also against
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.680]  match and La Raza and and and this is the perfect divide and conquer they bring
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:05.960]  in a foreign group they put them on welfare and they forged them as a
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:09.760]  political weapon and that's totally different from Hispanic Americans
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.480]  with the first people to warn me about this many many years ago when I was
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:19.120]  completely blind to the fact that that Latin America is pouring into the
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.040]  country now if we took more manageable numbers of people didn't put them on
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.440]  welfare educated about the Bill of Rights and Constitution I'm all for legal
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:32.360]  immigration from Latin America I mean we need immigrants to this country this
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.080]  country was built by immigrants but you just can't have 30 million illegal
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:41.000]  aliens and a couple million more a year pouring in voting illegally they've been
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.680]  caught all over to take my guns I mean listen it's very simple this is why
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.840]  Rome fell this is why many other civilizations fell I appreciate your
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:54.960]  call Kevin let's talk to Matt in Oklahoma you're on the air hey Alex
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:58.480]  long-time listener first-time caller I want to thank you for all that you do
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.000]  out there all the hard work that you do getting the truth I just wanted to see
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.440]  if you could elaborate on some of the more pressing problems of Oklahoma
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.720]  currently and what you would say to your Oklahoma listeners needs the greatest
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:14.000]  levels of constitutional and liberty driven activism also I wanted to ask you
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.400]  a little bit about the climate bill but you can collaborate on the Oklahoma
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:26.360]  stuff first well they've passed a law that bans basically malicious and they
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:31.320]  tied it in with the Ku Klux Klan it bans the Ku Klux Klan and the militia so
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:41.960]  that's like saying we're banning murder and we're banning freedom you know they
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:47.640]  always pass legislation in Europe and other places restrict free speech and
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.680]  they start out with the Nazis well Nazis are bad so people think it sounds
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:54.640]  reasonable no you take their free speech you're gonna lose your free speech
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:58.600]  and it's gonna be selectively enforced and so you've got you know the best of
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.880]  times the worst of times in Oklahoma it's one of the most constitutional
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:06.840]  states it's got some of the best people pro-second amendment but you've also
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:13.800]  got a lot of really bad people in your legislature and I mean I've seen articles
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:20.880]  where different cities what Tulsa was last year and I don't know if it passed
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.000]  was trying to make you get a license to have a garden in your backyard or
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.320]  front yard because you might grow marijuana see you're guilty until proven
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.200]  innocent you've got to pay for an inspection because you're a criminal
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.080]  you've got to be searched violating the fourth amendment but Oklahoma passes
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.560]  bill outlawing militia recruitment Kurt Nemo's got an article about that it's
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.360]  also in the Daily Oklahoma and we he has links to TV news reports in the
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:50.160]  article Oklahoma passes bill outlawing militia recruitment but I've read the
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:54.160]  legislation it basically bans militias well militias are all able-bodied men
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.800]  are are to be armed and ready to defend their country just like Switzerland we
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.080]  have the Swiss model that says last week the Oklahoma House representatives
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.960]  passed a bill that equates recruiting militia members to recruiting gang
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.600]  members and it says recruiting membership in unauthorized militia or
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:13.840]  Ku Klux Klan would be a crime if legislation approved Thursday by the
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:17.480]  House representatives becomes law this is making unauthorized militias
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:21.600]  illegals representative Mike Shelton the amendments author news okay
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:26.160]  reported today Shelton wants to send people to prison who do not ask the
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.800]  state for permission to form a militia if the bill becomes law it will likely
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.120]  be challenged as unconstitutional however the bill and its passage in the
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.560]  Oklahoma House reveals that its support on the part of lawmakers the nice
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.120]  citizens they're right under the first amendment specifically the right to
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:44.760]  peaceably assemble Shelton exploited the government's attack on the federal
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.920]  building 15 years ago in order to rationalize the law in Oklahoma we have
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:52.840]  seen the damage done by militia fanatics and you know that was a government
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.200]  off he said Ku Klux Klan is a long history of violence and domestic
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:00.320]  terrorism so see he mixes Ku Klux Klan in with in with the militia it sounds
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.480]  like mr. Shelton has read too much Southern Poverty Law Center literature
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:07.600]  the Ku Klux Klan is not only almost entirely dormant with the exception of
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.600]  a few FBI run stragglers we have links to mainstream articles about that kept
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.120]  around just in case the race car needs to be played but the throwback
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:19.080]  organization has nothing to do with state militia movements even the ADL
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:22.200]  admits that McVeigh was not associated with any militia group they have a link
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:27.920]  to the ADL admitting that so I mean this is a big deal this is saying we're
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:32.920]  gonna ban certain groups from assembly we're gonna ban certain groups right to
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:38.840]  go out and speak and this is actually what Nazi Germany did or what Soviet
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.640]  Russia did and so there'll be two approved parties the Republican and
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.840]  Democratic Party and they're gonna the FCC is calling for government run
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:51.640]  media they're calling for restrictions on free speech and what is going on in
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:54.400]  Oklahoma I mean they passed a law last year that you can't have burglar bars
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:58.120]  anywhere on your house that that's called fortification because the
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:02.040]  government's criminal and it wants to work with its little buddy criminals to
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:04.560]  break in your house easier and they don't want you to be able to have a
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:09.480]  garden and they and they're saying you can't form a militia you can't go get
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.960]  together with ten of your buddies and say if society collapses we're gonna stick
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.360]  up for each other I mean it's again we have an out-of-control criminal
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.360]  government and I don't know what to say else about Oklahoma but folks have got
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.200]  a problem up there and you need to clean out the corrupt politicians up there go
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.320]  ahead it's baffling to me Alex that they could even consider a law like that
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:33.480]  that blatantly violates the first and second amendment right in one bill I
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:37.960]  mean I've never seen anything like it it's it's ridiculous what I wanted to ask
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:42.560]  you about next is the climate change bill all over the mainstream media for
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.200]  the last few days they've been talking about the climate change bill authored
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:50.520]  by a there's Kerry formerly Graham and now Lieberman and they're talking about
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.520]  this like it's their bill and I called Senator Reid's office because he's the
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:59.320]  one who said this was ready to go the other day and what they referred me to
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:03.520]  as a house bill that's already passed yeah and again legislation cannot
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.000]  originate in the Senate this is a new bill they admitted to new bill and it's
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.840]  illegal but they passed the health care bill illegally see that that's what I'm
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:15.720]  saying they are tyrants they are decimating our laws in front of our
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:22.920]  face yep but yeah it's it's pretty pretty bad here in Oklahoma too but you
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.560]  know just calling around to senators and you know congressmen all over the place
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:32.400]  here you can't get a straight answer out of anyone but we've actually got a
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.600]  couple of candidates running here in Oklahoma that actually stand to do some
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:39.840]  good we've got a congressman running for the district here in the central
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:44.200]  Oklahoma and RJ Harris and he's a Ron Paul supporter I was good guy Ron Paul
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:47.840]  campaign yeah he's great we're out of time Matt we're gonna talk to Adam

[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:58.040]  global government announcement and also cover the state of the power grab bill
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:03.080]  it's meant to shut everything off Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources talking
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:06.760]  today about change not the change we were promised by President Obama but the
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:10.000]  reality that we must face in these changing economic times with our
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.280]  national debt currently exceeding twelve point five trillion dollars and our
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:16.640]  unfunded liabilities totaling over a hundred and seven trillion dollars the
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.120]  value of the US dollar continues its slide into oblivion there's still time

[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.600]  aware of let's continue with phone calls Adam in Canada you're on the air go
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:54.400]  ahead Adam good afternoon Mr. Jones it's an honor to talk with you how are you
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:59.280]  doing today the honor the honor is all mine go ahead I was wondering what your
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.640]  opinion is on these free speech zones that in Toronto at the upcoming g20 well
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:10.200]  I mean they had a speech free speech zone started under Clinton in 98 and the
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:14.440]  Republicans decried it and then Bush expanded them and Obama is using him he
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.360]  used free speech zones to try to have riot police attack a peaceful tea party
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:25.880]  yesterday but the police refused to follow orders well the first two times
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.640]  they followed the order and then the video was up on info wars calm curtain
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:34.920]  Emma wrote an article about it and and you know they kept pushing them further
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:38.800]  and further back and the third time they just marched off they just didn't
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:43.600]  follow the order so to violate the first amendment that's a some good news but
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.640]  yes I am familiar with what's coming up with the g20 and whenever the global is
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:51.520]  coming to your town or your country that they let everybody know they're the real
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:56.080]  government and at least you're gonna have free speech zones there those are
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:59.440]  bad enough you know where you're two miles away and nobody can see or hear
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.640]  you and they ignore you so the people can't be heard there were no free speech
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:09.120]  zones at the last g20 they claim there would be some but they just basically
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.160]  said no assembly and then they couldn't find anybody resisting them so they
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:17.920]  marched down to the university miles away to a park two nights in a row and
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:22.560]  even chase people into their dorm rooms so college students weren't even allowed
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:27.240]  to go out and sit underneath the stars and we cover that in police state for
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:31.040]  the rise of FEMA and and so this is the same system globally where they
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.320]  militarize the police they have them shoot at people rubber bullets they call
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.560]  out the army on the streets they snatch and grab citizens off the streets to set
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:42.480]  the precedent to scare people as a chilling effect from being politically
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:47.400]  involved why do they keep meeting so frequently and what do you advise your
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:51.360]  Canadian listener listeners to do about this okay I'm gonna answer that
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:54.520]  question when we come back in the next segment because I'm doing a whole piece
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:59.520]  on this and this is it they're negotiating the final formation of an open
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:03.320]  world government and we're gonna let you hear that directly from top globalist
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:11.600]  the head of the European Central Bank coming up in the next segment Trichette
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:18.200]  calls for corrupt BIS to boss global government in CFR speech let's go ahead
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.640]  now though and go back to the calls let's talk to Chris in Rhode Island
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:28.480]  you're on the air Chris how we doing Alex okay brother just quick question for
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:33.080]  you actually I was wondering if you saw either of these articles there was one
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.800]  from Mother Jones at the beginning of this month right before the WikiLeaks
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:43.000]  incident called both keepers in the age of treason trying to equate the
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.680]  oath keepers of basically committing treason no I didn't see it the guys
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:50.880]  print that for me oath keepers in the age of treason by the way do we find that
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:53.640]  Fox News piece that they talked about where they're admitting the government's
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.440]  growing the opium I'm gonna play that later then or a clip of it no but I have
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.440]  seen the media claim that they're treasonous saying they'll follow the
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:06.160]  Bill of Rights and Constitution and will follow their oath I mean that's kind of
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:10.720]  like in road to tyranny I have squad car video at a checkpoint they arrest a
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.840]  woman for no reason because they find a pocket Constitution and the cops have a
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:18.400]  discussion about whether it's legal or not they have a pocket Constitution and
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.400]  they're they're scared and breathing heavily I mean you can't make this up
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:29.240]  you got to go watch the film that's on YouTube folks and they swore an oath to
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:33.320]  that Constitution they swore an oath to that Bill of Rights that Declaration of
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:38.960]  Independence no police it's not illegal but what's your take on that article
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:44.120]  well basically it's a it's you know the normal mother Jones hit piece and they're
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:48.080]  trying to say that they're just there to resist the Obama administration they
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:52.520]  completely leave out that the fact you know that guns were seized in New
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:57.760]  Orleans under Bush or that oath keepers is founded by a top Ron Paul
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:03.120]  staffer who was critical of Bush and that they've made it clear that they just
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:09.280]  want to follow their oath it's wholesome it's good it's clean it's American and
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:14.040]  that's why they hate it and then the the other article I wanted to bring to your
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:17.800]  attention it's kind of a joke article but it's by Andy Borowitz and it's
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:23.120]  equating on Goldman Sachs to the Somali Pirates the headline on that one
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:29.160]  Somali Pirates say they're subsidiary of Goldman Sachs thank you I did find the
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:32.400]  mother Jones article the guys brought it in oath keepers in the age of treason
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.360]  meet the fast-growing Patriot group that's recruiting soldiers to resist the
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:41.240]  Obama administration that is not what they're doing and mother Jones is lying
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:46.080]  and they know it they work for the big banks and they make me sick I'm so sick
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:50.760]  of these neo-libs and they're tyranny we'll be back

[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:32.760]  we see the G20 now meeting every few months in fact pull up on screen for
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:37.560]  people just just type into the search engine the term banking heads meet in
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:44.640]  secret in Australia remember that two months ago 27 banking heads of the G20
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:51.840]  and 7 private megabanks all met in secret well I mean going back to 1954
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:55.840]  Bilderberg has released part of the minutes of their first meeting and they
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.440]  said through stealth through economic trade deals we're going to create the
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:03.800]  Asian Union the North American Union and the European Union and we are then
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:07.480]  going to merge those three they've already set up the North American Union by
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:12.120]  stealth the EU and the Asian Union are all operating and we have this in my
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:15.880]  film in-game Bush actually giving a speech with Merkel and Barroso of the
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:22.600]  EU saying we are now merging the North American Union with the European Union
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:29.760]  through this Atlantic agreement so they publicly admit they're doing this but
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:33.480]  then separately have armies of pundits out there saying if you talk about
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:37.440]  global government run by banks you're crazy it doesn't exist and you're
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.400]  probably a terrorist and when I had nightline here earlier in the week I
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:45.680]  was trying to show them clips of Herman von Roompi I was trying to show them
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:52.160]  clips of Gordon Brown of Bancay moon saying global governments here world
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:55.520]  governance is here and it's going to be run by private banks and they're going
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:59.720]  to raise VAT taxes on us they're gonna have carbon taxes on us it's like when
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:02.800]  I had Rothschild the heir to the Rothschild fortune on one of the head
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:06.960]  environmentalist out there land grabbing and he said there is no such thing as a
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:11.200]  carbon tax even though at the time he'd been on other TV shows promoting a
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:15.760]  carbon tax and calling for global government for my audience the disdain
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:20.120]  was it doesn't exist so we have an argument about whether it exists or not
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:25.000]  instead of about who's setting up the world government is it tyrannical do we
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:31.280]  want it do we have a say in it and so the G20 is meeting now every month or so
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:36.400]  with the army called out in England the army called out in the US the army
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:39.720]  being called out in Canada the army being called out in Europe on the
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:45.040]  continent no protestings allowed people are arrested their surveillance
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:50.100]  everywhere because these are the true controllers the finance ministers of the
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:55.200]  20 industrialized nations who all are former Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:00.560]  England executives that they're private bank holders they themselves in the
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:05.200]  banking bailouts which are really just banking robberies openly get hundreds
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:09.080]  of millions in some cases billions of dollars a piece of the bailout money
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:13.400]  and then they won't even tell Congress or the Parliament where all the money
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:18.960]  went so I mean think about how outrageous this is so I hate to even get
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:23.200]  into this subject without playing clip after clip after clip but you can just
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:27.000]  search engine Herman von Roompi head of the EU global governance and you'll get
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.200]  clip after clip after clip and the documents video audio government
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:37.160]  documents Copenhagen Treaty you name it you can type in Herman not determined
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:44.760]  von Roompi but Ban Ki-moon Gordon Brown Barack Obama Barroso Merkel Sarkozy I
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:49.480]  mean there are hundreds of these in the last year where they're just coming out
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:53.160]  in the open and so they're they're having more and more meetings because
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:59.080]  they're at the end they're now hammering out the VAT taxes the financial VAT taxes
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:05.440]  the Tobin taxes the global regulatory system that is a global governance model
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:09.960]  where the countries get lobbied and financed and paid off to sign their
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:16.160]  sovereignty away to an open-world government run and governed by private
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:22.200]  banks and they stalled the public with Rush Limbaugh and ABC News and the rest
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:26.080]  of them for all these years saying none of this exists and now they're saying
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:33.360]  okay it exists but it's not kosher to talk about it or to oppose it and so just
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:39.160]  the latest video I mean there are new videos constantly from Davos and the
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:43.440]  list just goes on and on as you guys find the secret banking article out of
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:50.160]  Australia well let's put it back up for people again because I want to read that
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:54.560]  headline again these are secret bankers who meet in secret to really set the
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:58.120]  policy they'll meet in secret at Bilderberg they'll meet in secret at
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:01.960]  trilateral Commission meetings you know we've stolen their internal documents
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:06.280]  before Jim Tucker and others have we know that's how years before they go
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:10.080]  public with something we already know what they're planning there it is secret
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:14.360]  summit of top bankers so they have secret summits and actually agree on what
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:19.240]  they're gonna do then they have public PR stunts where they come out and say
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:25.000]  we've got to have banking reform we've got to stop the big private brokerage
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.200]  firms and investment banks from selling derivatives and destroying the global
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:34.040]  financial order meanwhile the entire leadership of the G20 are running this
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:38.360]  and are involved in it and making money and getting power out of it so it's like
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:44.200]  having mobsters sit over a trial of themselves and then they lie to the
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:48.200]  public and say this is going to fix the problem when it only gives them more
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:52.720]  control so they create every crisis that's in the Goldman Sachs emails they
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:57.640]  create the crisis and then they offer the solution the Goldman Sachs CEO is on
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:02.720]  television saying we need to pass this financial regulatory bill and what does
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.160]  it do it erects global taxes to be paid to the bankers as a quote bailout oh
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:12.800]  that will certainly show them that will certainly get them won't it so I'm gonna
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:15.640]  play this video here in a moment but here's just the latest Trichette calls
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:23.080]  for corrupt BIS boss Trichette calls for corrupt Bank of International
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:29.400]  settlements to boss global government in CFR speech ECB president tells insiders
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:33.200]  the secretive group of international bankers responsible to no nation state
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.200]  will become primary engine of world government in a speech before the
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.560]  elitist council on foreign relations organization in New York earlier this
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:46.000]  week president of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichette called for the
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.520]  imposition of global governance to be bossed by the G20 and the corrupt Bank
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:53.920]  of International settlements in the name of safeguarding the global economy in
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:58.800]  an address entitled global governance today for chef proclaims how the elite
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:03.960]  need to impose a set of rules institutions that's laws and informal
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:07.680]  groupings that means they can secretly do whatever they want and
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:13.080]  cooperating mechanisms that we call global governance this is a quote during
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:16.640]  the course of the speech Trichette use the term global governments well over a
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:21.480]  dozen times outlining how global governance is of the essence to avoid
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:25.920]  another financial crisis there's the financial terrorism if you don't give us
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:31.160]  total power we will destroy everything and so oh they need 150 billion now for
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:34.960]  Greece that Goldman Sachs on record engineered and now a Goldman Sachs
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:38.240]  former executive is running the financial operation there with the
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:43.320]  government oh now Portugal's going down we need hundreds of billions oh now all
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:50.720]  these other oh taxpayers have got to give us money when its derivatives sold by
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:55.120]  the big brokerage firms to the governments in collusion to make money on
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:58.960]  the way up bankrupt the countries on the way down and get total banking
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.000]  dictatorship out of it again they're all a bunch of birdie made-off types who
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:09.240]  need to be arrested it's on record that the head of Goldman Sachs ordered his
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:19.600]  people to sell derivatives that they knew were quote sh dash t y okay it's on
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:26.840]  record but no we'll give them more power that will show them section one of
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.120]  Trichette's speeches entitled why we need global governance and from then on he
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.720]  constantly invokes the economic downturn as a justification for empowering
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.720]  secretive undemocratic and corrupt global institutions with the power to rule
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:42.920]  the world that's the other point you know if I got another email from a yuppie
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:47.920]  saying basically well it's time like Star Trek for us to have a global
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:51.600]  government and no more war and and peace and this is what humanity wants
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:54.480]  number one in every poll humanity doesn't want to lose sovereignty of their
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:57.640]  countries number two this is a global government run by private corporations
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:02.000]  that in their own documents they admit are authoritarian number last year and
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.680]  now for world government financial times of London headline by their foreign
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:09.000]  editor where he said yeah we've been secretive yes is authoritarian but it's
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.800]  for your own good two weeks ago the head of the Gaia movement the top
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.320]  environmentalist in England said we need to have an undemocratic world
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:19.560]  government to enforce one child policies in total control because the
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:23.520]  public's too stupid to do it this is an authoritarian global corporate
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:29.680]  dictatorship that is being set up and he also talks about in the speech you can
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:33.600]  read the transcript and watch the whole video we have it linked up on info wars
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.320]  dot com and prison planet dot com in this article where he says we've been
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.840]  building this for a long time we've got to go ahead with it now okay so the
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:47.240]  world government is here these guys give constant speeches they run our
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:51.440]  government illegally they're openly robbing everybody blind and you can't
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:57.240]  get ABC news nightline when they're here in your office in our office you can't
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:02.960]  even get them to stop laughing about it laughing about Goldman Sachs laughing
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:06.880]  about what's happening right now laughing about the country falling apart it
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:13.600]  is a joke it doesn't exist the video you're about to see doesn't exist according
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:18.120]  to these people here is a snippet of it this transformation which again has been
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:25.320]  prepared it is something which is we didn't didn't come as a sharp and I would
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:32.080]  say an expected event because the G20 existed already but this shift from the
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:38.280]  G7 to the G20 we owe it it seems to me obviously because it was overdue that
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:44.680]  these economies that were obviously systemic at the global level would have
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:49.720]  a full ownership of this global governance at the level of this informal
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:57.640]  grouping that I mentioned but and that's of course something which appears
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:04.360]  absolutely obvious I trust also that there is a second reason perhaps the
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:09.840]  industrialized country prove that they were quite clumsy themselves in running
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:16.120]  their own economy which are and remain of course at the core of global finance
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:21.640]  and of the global economy and that is something that we have to take fully into
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:29.320]  account it is of utmost importance that the new Basel rules that we are
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:36.720]  preparing and we are in an intense phase of discussion after having had the in
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:42.280]  the input of the industry the industry was in dialogue with the Basel
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:48.120]  committee we have this industry response and now we have to engage in
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:54.360]  calibration okay that's enough it goes on and on more than a dozen times
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:59.320]  calling for global government global governance now when you get SPP documents
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:02.920]  or you get North American Union documents or you get internal EU documents
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:05.960]  or Copenhagen documents like the treaty they wouldn't give the treaty to the
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:09.960]  public it had to be leaked and it was confirmed by the one in Guardian and
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:15.680]  the the UN admitted no this is the treaty and it was just hundreds of taxes
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:21.200]  total control paid to private banks and so when you get these documents it's the
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:26.200]  top corporations and banks at meetings they all agree on what they're going to
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:29.760]  do and then the presidents and prime ministers sit there like Aaron boys and
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:35.800]  Aaron girls writing down their orders and you just heard him talking about that
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:40.840]  private corporations are the ones that run this and so you've got private
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:47.600]  central banks and mega corporations like IBM and Microsoft and Walmart at all of
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:53.040]  these events and so you have government mega industry and mega media all teamed
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:57.040]  up together against the public they're organized they're focused and they
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:03.440]  control the world through your taxes and regulations and here he is out of the
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:07.800]  open calling for global government and you can go read the full transcript or
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:13.360]  watch the entire video in Paul Watson's excellent article Trichette calls for
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:19.160]  corrupt BIS to boss global government in the CFR speech I mean they it nexuses in
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:22.440]  with the IMF and World Bank and the Federal Reserve and Bank of England all
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:27.400]  just front holding companies for private banks that's on record but it's totally
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:31.560]  secret all we have is the documents that have been leaked and their speeches and
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:37.600]  and what they're talking about openly is completely illegal so that's what's
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:45.080]  happening we have some major breaking news here today this is from Kurt
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:53.720]  Nemo is US Army training to take on the Tea Party and he has video of this we
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:58.080]  talked about how they tried to sick riot police on peaceful Tea Party people in
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:02.720]  Illinois yesterday with Obama and now we discover the Army was there well of
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:08.040]  course the Army was there regular Army and National Guard at G20 in Pittsburgh
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:12.840]  last year of course they're there I mean we got the document what over a year
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:17.400]  ago that the Ron Paul events the Tea Party events and of course they have
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:21.520]  sound cannons at the events for the public in San Diego and we learned
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:25.520]  that I'm being surveilled Ron Paul's being surveilled that the in the Fed
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:30.080]  events have regular Army intelligence there and in the particular document

[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:38.920]  may attack you so they're telling him we're dangerous terrorists you know
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:43.280]  we're evil Americans that don't like offshore banks robbing us is the US Army
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:47.880]  training to take on the Tea Party on April 17th the Courier Journal in
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:56.200]  Lewisville Kentucky reported on an Army exercise dubbed MANGU DAI named after
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:02.480]  the special forces of Genghis Khan's a Mongol Army who could fight for days
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:06.600]  without food or sleep the Kentucky newspaper portrayed the exercise as an
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:11.320]  effort to train soldiers to battle the Taliban in Afghanistan designed to test
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:15.720]  the limits of officers physical mental and emotional endurance they had one of
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:19.520]  these drills in Austin a week and a half ago by the way at Camp Maverick the
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.240]  emerging Army exercise offered a revealing window onto modern combat
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:27.240]  training in the era of Iraq and Afghanistan Chris Kinning wrote for the
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.680]  newspaper over three days last week participants had to crawl on their
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:37.640]  bellies under real machine gun fire shiny commando style shimmy commando
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:41.880]  style over a single rope eye in the air and march for more than 22 miles through
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:46.560]  the forest but according to information received by the Patriot blog post
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:50.520]  there's another aspect of the military exercise not reported by local media this
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:54.200]  week I was contacted by a number of military personnel enlisted an officer
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:59.240]  ranks who expressed concern about military exercises underway at Fort Knox
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:04.120]  the US Bullion Depository as with most such exercises the Fort Knox Alert
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:08.560]  occurred in stages as if real-time intelligence was being provided to
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:13.200]  various intervals writes Mark Alexander Alexander cites an intel advisory
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:16.880]  issued on Friday April 20 30,000 and 10 that identifies terrorist threat
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:21.400]  adversaries as local militia groups that's confirmed anti-government
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:28.320]  protesters tea party and then we have a link to that in short the military was
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:32.840]  training in Kentucky to take on mythical malicious and that's also going on in
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:37.640]  Illinois no word if they were the FBI creative variety and remarkably the
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:41.480]  non-violent tea party movement see North Common Homeland Security is meant to
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:49.000]  engage red-blooded Americans and we have the military now talking about the
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:55.120]  scenario continues anti-government healthcare protesters have stated that
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:59.040]  they would join the tea party as a sign of solidarity during a protest at Fort
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:03.920]  Knox the tea party groups are armed have combative training and some are
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:07.880]  former military snipers some may have explosives training experience according
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:12.480]  to the Intel report so this is what the military is being taught that the
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:15.400]  American I told you over a year and a half ago they were training every police
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:20.800]  department for IED attacks improvised explosive device attacks by militias
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:25.120]  and they're gonna stage attacks say the American people are doing it and they're
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:28.680]  gonna try to roll the military out nationwide to confiscate the guns just
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:32.720]  like New Orleans they are preparing for this we've got to get the word out now
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:36.520]  they'll blow up a few federal buildings they'll kill some troops and blame it on
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:43.160]  us the Intel report updated Monday the 26th of April 2010 noted that the rally
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:47.000]  at the militia compound occurred and viable threats have been made many
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.040]  members were extremely agitated at what they referred to as government
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:55.080]  intervention over taxation and their lives will be right back with more of
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:51:00.360]  this this is just more devastating information I want Watson to boil down

[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:15.760]  actual Intel documents from the US Army directly from the US Army posted on
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:22.840]  mainstream news paper post this is mainstream news exercise exercise
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:30.640]  exercise taking on military US former military that's planning to kill US
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:34.600]  troops see and this has been going on forever but now it's intensifying and
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:38.200]  they've got riot training you name it first they train the troops to take on
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:44.040]  Muslims and they also have some of that the drills guys wearing headdresses but
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:51.120]  then they just shift over and they talk about the militias are drunk and that
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:57.920]  alcohol use fan the flames many military grade firearms were openly carried at
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:02.760]  the militia compound former US military involved so the US military this is the
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:07.600]  headline Watson needs to put up or Kurt needs to put up this is confirmed I mean
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:10.000]  you know Kurt is a professional journalist he's worked for major
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.640]  newspapers and I love Kurt to death but it shouldn't be is the US Army training
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:19.640]  to take on the Tea Party it says they're training to take on the Tea Party and the
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:25.960]  militias in the documents right here I don't even know I want to have Dr. Bob
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:29.640]  Bowman on about other issues but I pretty much I'm gonna get him to talk
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:32.280]  about this because I mean this is a subject we've got to talk about now
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:38.720]  folks it's just it's happening so fast it's happening so furious for present
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:42.800]  planet dot TV viewers will pull the article up on screen for people where
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:47.520]  we have these documents saved and you can go read these for yourself dated
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:52.480]  April 23rd and April 26th so this some of this was just going on three four
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:58.040]  days ago and this is just disgusting and I'm reading this that militias are
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:03.680]  gonna attack the Fort Knox gold depository give me a stinking break I
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:09.040]  mean is there no end to this that's why you've got to get police state for the
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:14.800]  rise of FEMA on DVD and make copies and get out to everyone you know because we
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:18.720]  show how they're staging the terror how they're brainwashing the military we
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:22.240]  have military commanders on admitting they were doing gun confiscation drills
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.680]  in Iowa practicing going door-to-door to take the guns I mean they're training
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:31.640]  to take our guns they're saying we're terrorists they're training the Boy
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:36.200]  Scouts and the New York Times reports to quote take on disgruntled veterans we
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:39.760]  have the Mayak at Homeland Security reports where they admitted over a year
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:43.000]  ago that the main target of Homeland Security is the American people and
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.360]  then last week the head of the FBI said yes we're shifting from Muslims to the
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:51.840]  American people and the Muslim threat is fake to a certain extent this is
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:57.680]  completely fake and they're staging these events and building it up to use the
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:01.200]  military against us and large portions of the military are already illegal
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:05.800]  aliens they've hired Obama rally with a bunch of illegal alien troops they were
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:11.160]  legalizing last week I mean we are in so much trouble I just can't even believe
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:17.520]  how sickening all of this is getting the demonstration did not happen due to
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:20.280]  federal and local law enforcement influence so they're saying they went in
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:24.080]  and stopped the demonstration possible raid on local white supremacist
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:27.720]  organization may have been made in the last 48 hours and then see they talk
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:31.440]  about white supremacist and they say tea party organizer start stated that they
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:35.360]  will protest at the gold vault at a future date and then it talks about
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:39.000]  tracking the tea parties tracking the militias how they've got infiltrator
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.720]  groups in there how the army's working with federal and local law enforcement
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:47.520]  organizations as these groups are armed and have come bad of training and some
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:52.880]  reformer military snipers some have made explosives training experience and it
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:58.920]  goes on to talk about their exercise to take on the tea parties and take on the
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:02.360]  militias and they mix in white supremacist with it and then meanwhile
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:08.560]  Oklahoma passes bill outlawing militias saying you can't have a militia we're
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:13.800]  gonna just arrest you for that and this has got years in prison under it I mean
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:17.760]  they are moving against the American people there is no doubt it just gets
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:24.040]  worse and worse and worse by the minute this is a red alert good job Nemo
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:29.520]  getting this up and but I mean we need to get Watson on this right now with
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:34.840]  headline military training to take on tea parties militias and others
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:51.400]  listing former military as terrorist okay that is what this does when you're

[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:23.400]  Alex Jones
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:31.600]  red alert red alert red alert we've got it up on info wars.com Curt Nemos got an
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:35.560]  article is the US Army training to take on the Tea Party then it has links to
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:39.600]  mainstream news articles mainstream newspapers that are reporting it like
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:45.560]  it's good military regular army exercises with federal and local police
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:50.840]  around the country where militia groups along with veterans are basically
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:55.160]  preparing to attack the government and this integrates into this entire
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:01:00.760]  program of control that we see expanding I have Dr. Bob Bowman who was on with us
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:04.280]  last week we reared it Sunday I didn't do a live show we'll be doing a live show
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:07.720]  this Sunday and I wanted to get him on about solutions today I'll take the
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:11.520]  country back but separately they had the secret space plane launch that he's an
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:15.520]  expert on former head of the Star Wars program this week we were talking about
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:18.240]  it last week then they had a secret launch this week we'll talk more about
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:23.160]  that we'll also get into solutions with him but I just talked to him during the
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:28.320]  break he joins us via video Skype here at prisonplanet.tv and on the radio and
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:33.880]  so we're gonna be talking to him first about the paramilitary militarization
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:38.840]  of police and all the documents we've gotten where Northcom is preparing to
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:44.160]  take on the American people and that their main target at Northcom is the
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:48.180]  American people this is illegal this is unconstitutional it violates posse
[02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:51.640]  commentatus that they have not completely removed and I've got Watson
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:55.560]  doing a big boil down article with some of the backstory on this but this is so
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:02:00.920]  big and this just broke and we've already seen leaked documents that the
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:05.440]  in the Fed rallies Ron Paul myself are being watched by the army they tell the
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:08.760]  army that don't let the in the Fedders know at the rallies that you're
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:12.280]  military or they may attack you I mean they are really getting ready to use
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:15.320]  the military against the American people and our government has overthrown
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:18.560]  countless third-world nations their experts on this when they have their
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:21.960]  druthers they want a dictatorship in other countries they wanted here
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:25.840]  presidents come and go the tyranny of the military industrial complex only
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:30.360]  grows Dr. Robert M Bowman well I'll just introduce him in the next segment but
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:34.120]  let's go to him now Dr. Bowman I just started briefing you on this but I know
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:38.880]  you're familiar with the backstory on this does this concern you well of course
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:44.240]  it does I've been speaking about this for years the good news is they're not
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:48.800]  going to get away with it because you know I've talked to a lot of military
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:58.160]  folks and the majority the vast majority will not take action against the
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:03.520]  American people they will surround us and point our guns outward to protect us
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:09.800]  from black water well let's talk about the history of this and then I'm going
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:15.280]  to go over these new leak documents to newspapers in Kentucky and other states
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:21.920]  and the army is confirming that these are real but I mean this has got to be a
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:25.080]  wake-up call to the military Dr. Bowman that they're being trained to engage
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:30.480]  the American people yes it is and that's why organizations like the oath
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:37.400]  keepers is so important because we've got to teach the members of the military
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:42.240]  and law enforcement in this country about the Nuremberg principles and about
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:48.640]  the Constitution and the fact that they have an absolute duty never to follow an
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:56.600]  order to engage in a war of aggression or to arrest incarcerate or disarm their
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:01.960]  fellow American citizens for simply exercising their constitutional right of
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:07.120]  dissent this is incredible and again they just incrementally are
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:11.040]  acclimating us to be like Guatemala or Nigeria with just troops all over the
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:16.360]  streets and mobile naked body scanners and checkpoints and and and just
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:22.080]  everything else that is now happening but we'll discuss oath keepers when we

[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:50.080]  follow your oath and we'll talk about the oath that the military and the
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:54.560]  police give if tyranny comes to your door it comes in a uniform stay there

[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:12.400]  because there's a war on for your mind scores of documents have fallen into our
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:16.800]  hands and been reported by the mainstream news to be authentic that the main
[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:21.640]  enemy of the federal government is gun owners returning veterans libertarians
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:26.440]  in the Fedders anti-war activists and they're having drills all over the
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:29.960]  country they're working with every local law enforcement group this has been
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:35.760]  declassified that militias are going to attack police departments with IEDs with
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:41.440]  explosives and we have this latest drill where they have tea party and you know
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:45.040]  basically in the Fed groups anti-fella reserve groups that are going to
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:48.840]  protest and then it leads to that they're going to attack with militias and
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:53.120]  they mix white supremacist in with it in the drill and if you don't know the
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:59.680]  military psychology folks they drill you to to also prepare for the attack but
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:04.720]  to also demonize the groups you're gonna be fighting remember it came out with
[02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:08.040]  these shooting drills at schools in Michigan where they would say home
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:11.960]  schoolers against government education that was the one group came in didn't
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:16.000]  announce to the kids it was the police posing as as homeschooling parents who
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:22.080]  were gonna kill children that's a way to demonize homeschoolers it's asinine and
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:25.200]  I can think of no better guest to talk about this we're gonna get into some
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:29.040]  other issues as well as dr. Bob Bowman lieutenant colonel u.s. Air Force
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:33.480]  retired president of the Institute for space and security studies executive
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:37.160]  vice president millennium three corporation retired presiding and it
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:43.160]  just goes on and on here he 101 combat missions as a fighter pilot in Vietnam
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:48.880]  the head of the DoD Star Wars programs under two presidents and we appreciate
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:56.680]  him coming on www.thepatriots.us is his website dr. Bob Bowman recap what
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:00.360]  she was saying in the last segment and and spend some time on this and and
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:04.560]  your concerns and then you brought up oath keepers and I have all these
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:09.280]  mainstream news articles saying they are treasonous here's mother Jones oath
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:13.960]  keepers in the age of treason when all oath keepers is saying is we will not
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:17.840]  confiscate guns we will not take people to FEMA camps we will we will follow the
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:24.200]  Nuremberg code and which isn't I guess even taught anymore to the military dr.
[02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:28.640]  Bob Bowman good to have you here with us well thank you and you're saying that
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:34.400]  oath keepers is against the Obama administration is ridiculous because we
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:41.240]  started oath keepers way back under George W. Bush this organization is not
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:48.680]  against any particular administration this organization is sworn to follow
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:54.000]  their oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:59.240]  States of America and these organizations the military and law
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:03.920]  enforcement are supposed to protect the Constitution and the people of the
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:12.080]  United States and it doesn't matter who it is that's trying to do the people in
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:19.800]  and if they try and get the military and law enforcement to do it and it seems
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:25.040]  like they're trying they're trying to demonize the American people and people
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:34.320]  like militias and gun owners and oath keepers and 9-11 truthers and goes on
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:41.600]  and on I don't think they're gonna succeed but it's a real battle and it's
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:49.440]  one that I'm gonna be engaged in with our organization the Patriots because I'm
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:54.760]  sure that with the name we have now the Patriots they're going to demonize us
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:12:04.200]  as well and we're going to keep working with the Pentagon to inform them of the
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:12.480]  facts and their duty and how it all how all this stuff fits in as you know three
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:16.560]  years ago I sent a letter to the generals and admirals of the Pentagon
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:22.880]  saying that they must not attack Iran and if anybody orders them to do it they
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:28.720]  should arrest whoever did it as a war criminal in the same way now I'm going
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:33.920]  to be sending a letter reminding them that the American people are not their
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:39.720]  enemy and if somebody orders them to round up Americans dissenters though we
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:46.440]  may be they must not only refuse that order but consider arresting whoever gave
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:51.080]  it absolutely for someone who studied history was someone who's been a
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:57.240]  military officer commanding us the Star Wars system I mean this was always
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:02.720]  taught 101 to even low-level officers that in a tyranny they try to use the
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:06.600]  military against the people this is called a military industrial complex
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:11.560]  coup this is anyone that does this is engaged in treason and now the oath
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:15.720]  keepers have their 10 pledges that are all right out of the Bill of Rights all
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:22.080]  right out of the Constitution and to then demonize them and to have mock
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:27.320]  drills where it says you know it starts out with a Tea Party protest against the
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:32.080]  Federal Reserve in these documents and then it leads to former military people
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:35.960]  trying to sniper troops in the drill and and and so they're teaching the
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:40.400]  military that the American people are going to try to kill you I mean this is
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:46.000]  amazing brainwashing and it really shows us clearly just another example of what's
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:50.120]  going on inside the Justice Department inside the Pentagon inside local police
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:54.400]  that are part of this drill to take on the American people I mean they are
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:59.560]  clearly quietly building this system for the American people saying it was for
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:04.480]  outside groups just as Hitler did and now they're openly getting their people
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:07.760]  ready to go up against the American people and as we talked about last week
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:11.920]  Dr. Bowman Colonel Bowman I believe they're going to stage false flags we
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:15.000]  see the preparatory brainwashing in the media for this against government
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:20.560]  installations military bases you name it to then create the self-fulfilling
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:26.960]  prophecy to sick a martial law scenario on the population I mean we're we're
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:33.800]  two minutes to midnight now yeah yeah I I think they very met very well may try
[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:40.760]  it but again there are high-ranking people in the military that are aware
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:50.680]  of this stuff and just like back when it was Iran that Cheney and company was
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:55.360]  trying to attack they're going to be people up there that say not on my
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:15:01.720]  watch well yes I mean talk about Fox Fallon the head of Centcom resigned and
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:05.880]  said I'm not going to launch an illegal attack on Iran yep that's right that's
[02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:10.160]  right and there's going to be more people like him well for those that don't
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:15.120]  know who don't know military history international law attacking a country
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:19.240]  first I mean that is one of the greatest crimes you can commit that's right
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:25.880]  and we course we've already done it twice recently in Afghanistan and Iraq
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:31.160]  claiming that they carried out 9-11 and of course he just in a nutshell Colonel
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:39.080]  what happened on 9-11 well we don't know really who did it but we can be dug on
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:44.280]  sure that it wasn't 19 Arabs with box cutters and an old man in a cave on a
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:51.160]  dialysis machine we know that there was a lot more to it than that that those
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:59.480]  demonized enemies could not have sidelined our whole air defense system
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:05.920]  they could not have pre-wired the buildings with the nanothermite to
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:10.440]  bring them down in a controlled demolition fashion they just couldn't
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:17.160]  have done it and we know for sure that the official conspiracy theory that the
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:25.080]  Bush administration put together is totally impossible so on 9-11 we had the
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:36.360]  greatest crime of the century and perhaps of recent time and we still don't
[02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:42.000]  know who did it because the 9-11 Commission wasn't asked to find out who
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:47.720]  did it as a matter of fact we now know that they were specifically told not to
[02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:52.440]  ask that question not to worry about who did it is it you know we know who did
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:17:00.200]  it just tell us you know where intelligence failed so what the important
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:07.560]  thing is what happened after 9-11 because after 9-11 the Taliban rulers of
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:14.640]  Afghanistan offered to give us Osama bin Laden if we had evidence against him so
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:19.560]  that we could put him on trial for 9-11 and of course the Bush administration
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:26.520]  ignored that offer of the Taliban for two reasons one that course they had no
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:32.640]  evidence against Osama bin Laden and still don't they probably knew at that
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:36.920]  point who did it and of course are covering it all up and protecting
[02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:44.840]  whoever did it and secondly they had already planned in detail the invasion
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:50.880]  of Afghanistan because Afghanistan wouldn't give unical gas pipeline in
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:55.520]  fact in fact the BBC and Associated Press have reported that in the three
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:18:00.080]  months before 9-11 tens of thousands of US and British troops were masked in the
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:04.280]  stands around Afghanistan the carriers were in place it takes months to get
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:08.600]  that invasion like that ready and bush on September 10th according to Newsweek
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:12.400]  signed the attack order to launch the attack in the next two weeks on
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:17.000]  September 10th the day before it happened and Jeff Bush AP reported was
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:22.320]  preparing for martial law in Florida and expanding on that originally a real
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:25.960]  letter was put out by bin Laden and a statement that was confirmed to be
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:30.200]  authentic that he did not do it but then they had all these fake websites and
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:34.600]  fake videos that have been proven to be fake where he said that he did do it and
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:39.600]  and now they'll have a Facebook account two weeks ago saying he did it and it
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:42.800]  turned out it was completely fake and some kid was running it but the news for
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:49.440]  a week reported oh look bin Laden has said he did it again yeah yeah they they're
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:55.480]  trying to pull the wool over our eyes they keep doing it and guys like you and
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:59.640]  me Alex we have to just keep telling the truth because only the truth can
[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:03.040]  protect us well let's when we come back is then I want to get into solutions in

[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:12.640]  and a lot more but but this just broke in the last 30 minutes which just adds
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:16.960]  to the giant stack of other government documents we've gotten where they have
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:22.080]  been secretly training the military for more than two decades to take on
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:27.760]  American gun owners I mean I've interviewed former Marine Corps captain
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:34.720]  back in 2001 and the last straw for him was when he drove through an Army
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:39.140]  checkpoint on I-35 and they were searching cars right here in Austin was in
[02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:45.360]  Kyle so he went ahead went public how in 88 89 he was leading teams with police
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:51.440]  rating American gun owners in Virginia as part of secret program and of course
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:55.480]  now we've got a lot of documents proving that and I interviewed a colonel last
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:59.360]  year who admitted they were doing gun confiscation drills in Iowa so they
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:06.000]  are preparing to come global meltdowns massive unemployment endless wars a new

[02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:15.280]  impossible more than 2,000 years ago the Roman Republic fell it officially
[02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:22.440]  fell in 410 hundreds of years later but the Republic that had some level of
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:28.960]  freedom fell when Julius Caesar marched his troops into Italy across the
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:32.280]  Rubicon it was illegal it was high treason to do so they wouldn't even
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:38.320]  allow troops in the country they wouldn't allow them in the city of Rome they
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:42.320]  have known for thousands of years that when you have a standing army in the
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:45.440]  country it's why the founding fathers said it was illegal couldn't be used
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:49.200]  inside the country that's why the posse commentatus act 1878 says illegal
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:52.600]  every time look at Latin America where they're always having the military take
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:57.520]  over look at Eastern Europe look at Asia and we know they're using the
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:01.360]  military legally we've set up North com made us a military jurisdiction and
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:05.320]  now we know they're drilling and training and the FBI admits the main
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:10.080]  target is gun owning Americans conservatives libertarians dr. Bob
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:17.600]  Bowman how do you see them trying to go hot with this stage terror false flag
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:21.600]  I mean what are some of the scenarios and and what should we do if we see a
[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:26.200]  federal building blown up or God forbid a nuke detonated we know Obama's people
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:31.600]  are now floating that you know attack Iran stage domestic attacks to go after
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:37.320]  domestic groups I see it all happening as a combo well sure we have to be
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:42.760]  prepared for any of that and one of the great things about the 9-11 truth
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:50.720]  movement is that in digging into all of this we're watching now and and they
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:55.440]  know that we're watching and that's why they may be deterred from some of these
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:26:01.480]  crazy schemes and new false flags because they know we're liable to catch
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:11.760]  them red-handed and and and we will so we've got to watch for that if something
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:19.760]  happens the American people have to know that before they think oh yes it's you
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:30.400]  know some crazy Muslim group or it's a militia it net up they've got to think
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:39.040]  that it could be insiders in the military and intelligence establishment a
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:48.040]  rogue group associated with our government and we have to make sure that
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:53.680]  the people know that that's a possibility so that when these things
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:27:01.320]  happen they don't automatically knee-jerk into a yell let's go get those
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:08.400]  people whoever they're told are the bad guys well you're absolutely right and
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:12.640]  they're gonna need a Gulf of Tonkin or an Operation Ajax or a Gliwitz or a
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:18.000]  Reichstag or an Oklahoma City or a 9-11 to launch their new war against the
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:22.600]  American people but we know in any military planning with the local police
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:26.880]  and the feds with the FBI that it takes years of planning and preparation
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:30.200]  that's how we've known that this was coming and I said it would start in
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:35.680]  2010 2011 because I could see all the preparation building towards this
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:41.200]  invasion basically of the American people by the military and that's what
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:45.320]  oathkeepers recognized several years ago and that's what you've recognized for
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:50.200]  many years and they have certainly crossed the Rubicon the question is will
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:55.800]  they be successful in bringing down the Republic that indeed is the question and
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:59.480]  my answer is hell no they're not going to be successful because we're not going
[02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:07.200]  to let them dr. Bob Bowman there may become a time very soon and they're
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:12.800]  announcing North com through cyber security and shut down the web we're
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:16.480]  rapidly approaching a time and date where we may not even be on the air if
[02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:21.800]  they launch this full operation and I'm just really hope people are taking this
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:27.560]  information extremely seriously that's right we have to use whatever we've got
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:36.920]  the internet the independent stations like and networks like yours our
[02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:44.760]  newsletters our contacts local access television whatever we can use to
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:49.720]  spread the word and we have to educate ourselves and our friends and our
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:55.720]  neighbors and our families and our communities by any means possible I
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:29:00.960]  asked people who have subscribed to my newsletter to send us a list of people
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:05.000]  that you'd like to get educated you know we'll give them a free trial

[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:30.240]  to reach out to people all across the political spectrum and our members run
[02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:37.520]  the gamut from the militia folks on the far right to the anti-war people on the
[02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:41.720]  far left all across the political dr. Bob Bowman stay there let's talk about
[02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:47.840]  solutions when we come back and then I want to open the phones up for people in

[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:54.900]  was eight o'clock at night and then they called the police and said we were
[02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:59.600]  trying to blow up the military base and the police showed up and and and said
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:04.000]  we're gonna say you're terrorist you ran you were sneaking around all lies so
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:08.440]  just out of hand we're terrorist they've all been taught we're the enemy they've
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:11.800]  been taught in Gerald Salente thinks they will fire on citizens that they
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:15.800]  will do it especially after the feds blow up a military base and blame it on
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:21.200]  us and we now have the government blocking Congress's subpoenas on the
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:26.680]  shooter at Fort Hood that was done during a drill we know that the Atari

[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:48.360]  you can call toll free 8882533139 8882533139 a right to me Alex Jones
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:53.480]  P. O. Box one night 549 Austin Texas 78760 dr. Bob Bowman has been a huge
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:57.280]  supporter of oath keepers perhaps dr. Bowman you should explain that guys
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:37:02.840]  print me the 10 pledges of oath keepers it's on their site let's go over that
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:06.360]  and then the organization you've launched and the speaking tour you've done
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:11.120]  around the country reaching hundreds of thousands of people and and and where
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:17.480]  this is going and how people can get involved in the patriots dot US okay
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:23.160]  well we're an organization that is all across the political spectrum and we
[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:31.080]  want a peaceful revolution to restore the republic the way things are going
[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:40.560]  they're heading us toward violent revolution and we don't want that so the
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:46.800]  only way to have a peaceful revolution is to make sure that enough people in the
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:53.920]  military and law enforcement understand what's at stake understand what their
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:38:01.280]  oath means and wind up on our side the side of the people not the side of a
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:06.280]  few crazies in the government to tell them to do something stupid like round
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:11.360]  us up and throw us in FEMA camps so that's in the short term but we have to
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:18.280]  have a long-term solution to bring about this peaceful revolution and
[02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:25.040]  electoral solution and so we're asking all of our chapters to groom candidates
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:31.520]  to run in both the Democratic and Republican primaries for Congress we
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:36.720]  eventually have to vote out all of the members of Congress that are not on
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:42.080]  side of the people and you know the number that are on the side of the
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:47.240]  people and following the Constitution are very few I mean we've got Ron Paul
[02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:54.960]  Dennis Kucinich Alan Grayson you know just a very few but if your particular
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:39:02.720]  representative is one of the vast majority that's on the take and supporting
[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:11.000]  the giant corporations and the global terrorists and that want to take over our
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:17.640]  country and they're grabbing it now if that's the case then you have to vote
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:23.280]  them out we have to vote out every incumbent that is not one of the handful
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:30.360]  that is really trying to serve the people and to do that we can no longer
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:41.360]  just go to the polls as Greens or Libertarians or independents or writing
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:45.800]  candidates we have to take over the Republican and Democratic parties from
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:51.400]  within because the system is stacked in their favor and so that's what we're
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:58.800]  trying to do and our members of the Patriots members of our chapters are
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:05.760]  going to be running for Congress as Republicans and Democrats hopefully we
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:14.000]  get a few of them running in 2010 and a lot more in 2012 and see what we can do
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:19.800]  then we're going to hold their feet to the fire when we get somebody in and
[02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:26.280]  make sure that they don't wind up on the take like everybody else and we demand
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:31.200]  the changes the real changes that we need in this country and there's massive
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:37.000]  there's massive to interrupt massive grassroots concern and involvement
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:41.320]  people are really getting off the bench now and so now is the time for the
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:44.560]  campaign for liberty for your organization for oathkeepers for
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:48.240]  everybody for the listeners of this broadcast for we are changed for info
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:52.400]  warriors to get the word out like the life of this country depends on it
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:56.720]  because the global takeover is happening right now and I do want to just have you
[02:40:56.720 --> 02:41:01.640]  continue but I wanted to throw this out for military for police to get their
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:05.400]  concern about the fact that they're being openly trained to take on the
[02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:10.000]  American people either your concerns or what you've witnessed will cover it all
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:14.680]  but let me give that toll-free number out to military and police and others
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:25.920]  only the phones are wide open for you 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:28.960]  here's that number again if you're driving along in your squad car or
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:35.680]  or you're on leave and listening 1-800-259-9231 please continue Dr. Bob
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:43.680]  Bowman yeah well we eventually have to take over the government so that we
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:48.600]  have a government that follows the Constitution honors the truth and serves
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:55.800]  the people those are essential ingredients of a populist government a
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:42:03.480]  government that will be you know as Lincoln said for the people and we
[02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:08.960]  certainly don't have that now we have a government buying for the corporations
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:17.400]  and the billionaires and we have to get away from that and once we do then we
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:21.920]  can demand an end to the corporate wars cut off all the funding bring our
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:27.440]  troops home from all the hundred and fifty hundred and seventy hundred and
[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:32.120]  eighty countries they're stationed in around the world give give the bases
[02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:38.400]  back to the home countries and use our military only for protecting our borders
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:43.320]  and our people that is their constitutional mission that's their
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:52.200]  only constitutional mission and if we make that one change in military policy
[02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:56.760]  to eliminate the mission of protecting the global financial interests of
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:02.360]  multinational corporations we can greatly enhance our national security and
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:08.200]  simultaneously reduce the defense budget by eighty percent now that's a step toward
[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:12.720]  fiscal responsibility and I think it's worth thinking about that's just one
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:18.360]  change that can be made when we get a government that follows the Constitution
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:22.880]  honors the truth and serves the people and let's be clear we're not talking
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:26.720]  about just status quo or people gonna stand up are they gonna get involved are
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:30.960]  they gonna say no to you know the current corruption the way tyranny works is
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:35.680]  it only gets worse and worse until you stop it and then reverse it and so we
[02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:41.440]  are going down the slippery slope here very very very fast right now and and
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:46.080]  the time is up I mean in your educated opinion former head of Star Wars program
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:51.520]  you know Air Force Colonel researcher looking at history looking at what's
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:54.280]  happening looking at what the people running our government have done in other
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:58.960]  nations do you have any doubt that they're attempting to set up a open
[02:43:58.960 --> 02:44:05.320]  oppressive hot despotic system by hot for those that don't know you're no
[02:44:05.320 --> 02:44:11.560]  longer just a cold creeping tyranny but an aggressive jack booted in your face
[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:17.360]  tyranny now they're certainly heading in that direction there are elements and
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:22.280]  again I think they're in the the minority there's certainly a small
[02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:28.280]  minority of the population but unfortunately they seem to be in the
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:36.680]  majority in Washington DC and this small minority certainly has control of
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:44.600]  major elements of our government and we need to cut those strings we need to get
[02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:49.800]  big money out of politics we need to take our government back so that it starts
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:59.680]  serving us again and besides ending the wars we also must demand that we get the
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:06.880]  return of our full constitutional rights that we do away with the Patriot Act the
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:13.560]  Military Commissions Act and all the other acts and and executive orders that
[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:18.160]  have tried to take away our constitutional rights and by the way all of
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:24.920]  those acts are unconstitutional Congress does not have the power to take
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:29.240]  away the rights that have given us in the first ten amendments the Bill of
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:34.200]  Rights they can't take those away by just passing the law they have to pass an
[02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:37.880]  amendment to the Constitution get it ratified by the states of course that
[02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:43.160]  hasn't happened and that won't happen so we don't have to follow the Patriot Act
[02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:47.000]  we don't have to follow the Military Commissions Act those things are totally
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:53.120]  unconstitutional all right dr. Bob Bowman I want to I was about to go to some
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:56.440]  call we had some concerned military people on the line and they hung up
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:00.960]  again we can always load the phones with the people on any issue except
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:06.240]  sometimes I specifically want certain people to be able to call in former
[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:09.680]  military that's concerned current military people that have been involved
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:14.280]  in these drills for those that just joined us US military is training with
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:18.880]  police nationwide to take on the tea parties their brainwashing police that
[02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:23.520]  the tea parties and returning veterans are going to attack them with guns and
[02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:27.480]  they're claiming that we're white supremacists it's all mixed in and the
[02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:30.520]  military did leak these documents the military admits they were doing these
[02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:35.440]  drills so the good news is the military is concerned and is leaking these but I
[02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:42.160]  want to get people's take on this 1-800-259-9231 I mean don't tell me
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:46.480]  that our military and our police are so cowed listening out there that you're
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:50.840]  so afraid of the NSA that you're not going to call in and and and tell us
[02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:55.760]  your concern the the government's main focus in the real drills and
[02:46:55.760 --> 02:47:00.880]  preparation isn't just for the American people and tea parties folks and in the
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:05.240]  fetters it is for gun owning veterans who have military training that is in
[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:11.200]  both the drills held the 23rd and 26th okay and this is part of NLEO 10 going
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:15.760]  on we're NLEO 9 admitted they're using foreign assets in the drills foreign
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:20.800]  troops in these drills to go up against you this is the high treason this is
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:24.200]  serious what's going on all over the country that's what the stage terror
[02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:27.280]  attacks are about that's what this whole system is about and we've got
[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:32.800]  mainstream media claiming the oath keepers are treasonist this is fully
[02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:37.120]  disgusting I mean this is absolutely disgusting let me just read what
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:41.260]  oath keeper stands for we will not obey any order to sign the American people we
[02:47:41.260 --> 02:47:43.880]  will not obey any order to conduct warrantless searches the American

[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:04.000]  impose martial law or state of emergency or a state on a state or to enter by
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:07.040]  force into a state without the express consent of the invitation of the
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:10.880]  state's legislator or governor what's in the John Warner defense authorization

[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:44.600]  wanting the oath keepers to add one more to that and that's to promise not to
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:54.320]  follow any order to participate in a war of aggression but again I mean you
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:57.160]  sworn oaths to protect and defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:03.680]  domestic yeah I mean reading that reading the oath it goes further than
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:08.560]  oath keepers and I've read old army handbooks from 50 years ago that were
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:14.680]  more clear than this but but now this is treason to actually be a patriot yeah

[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:52.720]  he's doing but we've got Roger who's ex-military who's concerned about drills
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:59.680]  Tom and Canada military contractor Brian Chad let's go to Tom in Canada who is a
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:04.440]  military contractor what's your take on this and you have any information yes
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:10.520]  Alex I was on a couple military bases ten years ago pre-911 there were a
[02:55:10.520 --> 02:55:14.680]  live-round training base combined arms tactical training and basically what it
[02:55:14.680 --> 02:55:21.720]  was 100 acre site 60 buildings replica of a US city every building like
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:28.080]  municipal hall city hall town halls residential housing hotel and it was
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:32.280]  basically the structures and it was for ranger training for the army go through
[02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:36.680]  at the time you know I wasn't really so watching TV and so on not not aware and
[02:55:36.680 --> 02:55:41.240]  I was kind of taken back because I expected to see a Middle Eastern you
[02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:46.560]  know like Middle Eastern town or Russian town or something like that but it was
[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:51.920]  a US city and at the time the context I dealt with told me it's because of the
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:56.280]  Oklahoma city that it was to deal with domestic yeah we've got footage from
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:56:01.040]  three drills they did in the late 90s in Louisiana where they admitted it was
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:04.400]  for the American people and they had foreign troops drilling to do it so they
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:09.880]  told you ten years ago this was for domestic groups exactly and they use
[02:56:09.880 --> 02:56:16.360]  they decided the Oklahoma as one and now was this drilling for the US and was
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:21.240]  this with US troops yeah it was not it was a rangers based in the in the
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:25.200]  northwest there was one in Alaska I think a couple in the southern states as
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:28.560]  well there's about six the road at the time well last year I had an army
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:31.880]  colonel on it was in the newspaper we're doing door-to-door gun confiscation
[02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:35.960]  drills and and then I had the colonel on and he admitted it that's in police
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:41.120]  state the rise of FEMA the new film I appreciate your call dr. Bob Bowman this
[02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:44.880]  has been going on a long time but I see it really accelerating and coming to a
[02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:50.440]  head yeah right on let's get another one of your callers all right let's talk
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:57.000]  to a Roger in Missouri former military about drills go ahead yes this has been
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:03.400]  going on for a long long time Memorial Day of 1973 I was stationed at Camp
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:10.840]  Feldman California and the Black Panthers was gonna march on Camp Feldman the
[02:57:10.840 --> 02:57:15.320]  commandant general actually came out secure deliveries for everybody on the
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:21.400]  base brought retina out put 30 cow machine guns out and they grew a line
[02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:25.440]  and they told the Black Panthers you go across that line we're gonna kill you
[02:57:25.440 --> 02:57:32.480]  then after that they started they transformed the Vietnam training
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:40.720]  village into what would look like just a regular United States Street and told
[02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:45.320]  us that of course that was during the Nixon administration when they was
[02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:52.840]  watering it was going on that we would probably be attacked by armed citizens
[02:57:52.840 --> 02:58:00.160]  also just four years ago I belong to the Marine Corps League and the local
[02:58:00.160 --> 02:58:06.000]  police and Sheriff's Department came and asked us if we'd get search trains to
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:14.240]  help out administrative duties and rescue during a emergency of any kind
[02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:20.400]  and we went to that everybody was pretty well on board with it then about
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:25.080]  old three or four months after that they actually shut down our local airport and
[02:58:25.080 --> 02:58:33.880]  had a terrorist drill and we was supposed to do a fake triage different

[03:08:11.320 --> 03:08:15.560]  the country for decades I've interviewed Marine Corps captains I've
[03:08:15.560 --> 03:08:20.280]  interviewed generals I've talked to high-level former and current Pentagon
[03:08:20.280 --> 03:08:26.080]  people many many times I federal marshals state police gave us the Mayak
[03:08:26.080 --> 03:08:30.560]  homeland security documents over a year ago saying the number one threat the
[03:08:30.560 --> 03:08:34.200]  government says is gun owners returning veterans conservatives people that have
[03:08:34.200 --> 03:08:38.080]  American flags on their cars and that we're going to attack law enforcement
[03:08:38.080 --> 03:08:43.000]  military and IRS buildings then they bust a few militias that they set up to
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:46.440]  create the illusion that it's all about to happen Bill Clinton comes out and
[03:08:46.440 --> 03:08:51.160]  says gee I hope the Tea Party shut up or it's gonna cause somebody to blow up a
[03:08:51.160 --> 03:08:54.560]  federal building again and we then have all the eyewitnesses and people that
[03:08:54.560 --> 03:08:57.520]  were at the Alfred P. Murray building with McVeigh and feds in there
[03:08:57.520 --> 03:09:01.440]  plant and gray sticks of butter and they didn't know what it was I mean this is
[03:09:01.440 --> 03:09:03.760]  I've interviewed the foreman of the grand jury
[03:09:03.760 --> 03:09:09.120]  happy Heidelberg the FBI came to his house with guns and said shut up stop
[03:09:09.120 --> 03:09:13.600]  talking about it they killed Coppa the year who was a witness and saved a bunch
[03:09:13.600 --> 03:09:18.400]  of people because he saw it I mean they're not playing games here this is
[03:09:18.400 --> 03:09:21.520]  not a radio show it's not an entertainment it's not Alex Jones
[03:09:21.520 --> 03:09:27.080]  having fun I'm exhausted all I think about is spending time with my family
[03:09:27.080 --> 03:09:30.640]  but I was gonna go home today and take my kids to the park or I'm not even doing
[03:09:30.640 --> 03:09:34.080]  that now I'm gonna stay here and put out an emergency video trying to warn
[03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:41.800]  people we've got criminal offshore banks I played the CFR speech the head of the
[03:09:41.800 --> 03:09:45.360]  European Central Bank saying we have worked for world government we are now
[03:09:45.360 --> 03:09:50.880]  establishing it the taxes will be paid directly to the banks haha world
[03:09:50.880 --> 03:09:55.920]  government and then I had nightline here two days ago laughing at me when I was
[03:09:55.920 --> 03:09:59.760]  playing them world government clips saying well that's not what they mean
[03:10:00.960 --> 03:10:04.800]  they've stole 28 trillion plus in the last year and a half
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:08.320]  they're taking over everything they're openly in the news saying they're
[03:10:08.320 --> 03:10:13.120]  going to take your pension funds all right I'm going to try to shut up and I'm
[03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:16.160]  going to try to go to these veterans and police and others that are on hold
[03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:21.920]  here and and we've got an active duty folks Chris I'm gonna try to get to
[03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:26.520]  everybody but it's so touching and I've got so many of these callers now I can
[03:10:26.520 --> 03:10:31.000]  even keep track of them who was the caller I've been talking to yeah yeah
[03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:34.360]  Roger and everything Roger's saying I've actually seen in separate documents
[03:10:34.360 --> 03:10:40.840]  Rex 84 training to use the military FEMA camps the emergency centers act the
[03:10:40.840 --> 03:10:48.080]  top-off two drills in leo 9 and leo 10 I mean I the military Senate to us and
[03:10:48.080 --> 03:10:53.680]  others what last year that at in the Fed rallies with Ron Paul and others
[03:10:53.680 --> 03:10:58.800]  myself it specifically mentioned Texas and Dallas when I was there you see it
[03:10:58.800 --> 03:11:01.920]  the Obama deception bullhorning the Federal Reserve talking about how
[03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:06.000]  they're a banking dictatorship army regular army was there and they said
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:10.880]  don't let him know your army there they may be terrorist and may kill you they
[03:11:10.880 --> 03:11:15.560]  they teach the military and it's all these great Americans of all races you
[03:11:15.560 --> 03:11:20.040]  know religions out there calling for sovereignty and there was army there and
[03:11:20.040 --> 03:11:25.920]  and being told that we would kill them or may kill them if they told us they
[03:11:25.920 --> 03:11:30.960]  were military and now folks that is brainwashing and when you read these
[03:11:30.960 --> 03:11:36.560]  documents and the latest this comes out of the carrier journal this comes out
[03:11:36.560 --> 03:11:41.520]  of carrier journal Lewisville Kentucky and then we've got it info wars dot com
[03:11:41.520 --> 03:11:45.080]  and prison planet dot com they just report it dryly it's like that Ithaca
[03:11:45.080 --> 03:11:51.800]  newspaper and in New York talking about martial law you've got in in in
[03:11:51.800 --> 03:11:56.400]  Illinois you've got in California you've got in New York State the last three
[03:11:56.400 --> 03:12:00.280]  months from Schenectady to you name it like that was in the news here it is
[03:12:00.280 --> 03:12:05.520]  right here here it is right here Chicago Tribune to Chicago state reps they
[03:12:05.520 --> 03:12:10.200]  bring in National Guard blub blub blub Blagojevich a year ago before he got
[03:12:10.200 --> 03:12:13.080]  disgraced that we're going to use National Guard for gun confiscation
[03:12:13.080 --> 03:12:16.400]  door-to-door I played his press conference I mean look at New Orleans
[03:12:16.400 --> 03:12:20.120]  they went in the high and dry areas and took everybody's guns and the people
[03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:25.160]  are still in denial about that I mean folks do you understand that they are
[03:12:25.160 --> 03:12:28.600]  trying to warp the brains of the troops they're telling them that the American
[03:12:28.600 --> 03:12:31.960]  conservatives and libertarians are gonna kill them and they're gonna stage
[03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:36.520]  events to make that a real occurrence so they can use them against us and we
[03:12:36.520 --> 03:12:39.640]  were talking to Roger and then I'm going everybody else and Roger what if you
[03:12:39.640 --> 03:12:43.000]  just join us was talking about he tried to he was in the Marine Corps League
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:47.360]  they they took him out to an airport not been at airport drills in Brooksville
[03:12:47.360 --> 03:12:51.880]  Florida they had feds jumping out of the bushes that trying to light things on
[03:12:51.880 --> 03:12:57.000]  fire and blaming on me we've got video of me in the neighborhood where they were
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:13:00.480]  doing military drills and women coming out saying are you Alex Jones I was told
[03:13:00.480 --> 03:13:06.200]  not to talk to you by the army by special forces and special forces guys in
[03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:09.520]  plain clothes you heard Mike Hansen on air with us just jumping out of the
[03:13:09.520 --> 03:13:13.880]  bushes at night lighting fires and I'm like running over stopping them no no
[03:13:13.880 --> 03:13:19.000]  don't blame me I mean this is what I live this is what I do folks I've had
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:24.080]  special forces in plain clothes in a target parking lot tell me their special
[03:13:24.080 --> 03:13:28.000]  forces and they're gonna get me if I don't shut up years ago I've had guys
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:31.720]  pound on me attacked me in a parking lot telling me shut up as they were
[03:13:31.720 --> 03:13:35.800]  breaking my nose I have been there ladies and gentlemen I'm telling you
[03:13:35.800 --> 03:13:39.440]  they're ready to go after the American people and their number one target in
[03:13:39.440 --> 03:13:45.080]  these new documents is veterans don't you understand how treasonous this is
[03:13:45.080 --> 03:13:48.920]  because because veterans are good people police are good people on average and
[03:13:48.920 --> 03:13:54.540]  they understand and they saw the feds demonize us patriots and call us
[03:13:54.540 --> 03:13:57.600]  kooks for talking about a new world order for decades and now they've seen it
[03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:01.680]  all come true and they're waking up okay okay I'm gonna shut up it's just it's
[03:14:01.680 --> 03:14:05.440]  just this is so real this doesn't have to happen that we with the country doesn't
[03:14:05.440 --> 03:14:09.680]  have to fall to tyranny finish up what she was saying Roger in Missouri about
[03:14:09.680 --> 03:14:12.920]  just a few years ago they get the Marine Corps League out to aid the
[03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:16.000]  military at a base and they say we're not fighting in foreign terrorists we're
[03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:22.040]  getting ready for militia go ahead yes I mean a few others resigned or
[03:14:22.040 --> 03:14:26.280]  eventually have resigned over things like that but there's one good thing
[03:14:26.280 --> 03:14:31.880]  Alex especially our governor Jane Nixon here in Missouri probably won't more
[03:14:31.880 --> 03:14:41.160]  veterans up than any of us could but not that my report I seriously I don't
[03:14:41.160 --> 03:14:47.160]  think he'll get reelected because four years ago people just like you they
[03:14:47.160 --> 03:14:52.560]  called me a nut and they don't do it very loudly but I've had many of them
[03:14:52.560 --> 03:14:59.000]  come to me and say you was right you was right so we're winning huh hang in
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:02.200]  there yeah we're winning that's why Clinton's up there with failed threats
[03:15:02.200 --> 03:15:08.600]  about blowing stuff up to blame it on us but they're showing their hand well
[03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:13.600]  you know what all these vets out there they they need to understand that the
[03:15:13.600 --> 03:15:17.560]  government is going to come for the guns and and they better understand our
[03:15:17.560 --> 03:15:20.640]  country's been taken over by foreign banks and that's why this is not our
[03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:24.720]  government these guys out there that say this can't happen here it is happening
[03:15:24.720 --> 03:15:28.600]  here it is and it's accelerating God bless you I appreciate your call Roger
[03:15:28.600 --> 03:15:35.240]  okay there's a lot of military calls here and I'm gonna go to Brian Carl

[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:34.000]  cover the Brooksville drill to take over the town and then they had Feds running
[03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:39.000]  around trying to frame me but go ahead my brother is also an army he's part of
[03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:43.960]  the Third Brigade in Fort Stewart Georgia which he's not part of the first
[03:16:43.960 --> 03:16:50.080]  infantry but first infantry is the unit that deployed in the United States for
[03:16:50.080 --> 03:16:54.440]  you know the civil unrest yeah that's the that's the first cohort first
[03:16:54.440 --> 03:17:01.320]  spear centurion group is basically what it is that forms the heart of the 400
[03:17:01.320 --> 03:17:05.280]  thousand group that they're building according to Army times to occupy the
[03:17:05.280 --> 03:17:10.800]  U.S. right and when I last time I visited him I talked to actually post this
[03:17:10.800 --> 03:17:14.560]  story on the present planet forums but I talked to some of his neighbors and
[03:17:14.560 --> 03:17:19.200]  stuff on the base that are part of the first infantry and they confirmed that
[03:17:19.200 --> 03:17:24.840]  they are indeed trained in implementing martial law and one of the guys actually
[03:17:24.840 --> 03:17:31.080]  his neighbors tell me he flies the UAVs for the surveillance ones and he says he
[03:17:31.080 --> 03:17:36.360]  spies on civilians on a daily basis just randomly sir I had I had a Marine
[03:17:36.360 --> 03:17:41.640]  Corps source come to access TV in 99 two weeks after I was an urban warrior with
[03:17:41.640 --> 03:17:46.080]  Marines landing and taking over a part of Oakland and I and I had him come and
[03:17:46.080 --> 03:17:52.480]  say you can see this but you can't have it and it was UAVs watching us flying
[03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:55.560]  around we're getting out of the hotel getting out of our car going guest our
[03:17:55.560 --> 03:17:59.440]  one guest our one we've got the militia terrorists on our sites and again I
[03:17:59.440 --> 03:18:01.960]  wasn't allowed to show the public that because then it would have gone back to
[03:18:01.960 --> 03:18:06.920]  whoever supposedly did it but I'm sorry just go ahead it's not surprising I
[03:18:06.920 --> 03:18:10.160]  didn't want to say there are a lot of people in the military that are waking
[03:18:10.160 --> 03:18:15.760]  up where I'm stationed the officers my bosses are they're not completely
[03:18:15.760 --> 03:18:18.480]  awake but they're they're getting there I've woke up a lot of people in the
[03:18:18.480 --> 03:18:23.600]  military and I think they're gonna have a hard time implementing martial law
[03:18:23.600 --> 03:18:28.680]  short of bringing in foreign troops but let me go back here let's not just
[03:18:28.680 --> 03:18:34.840]  glaze over this and I may hold you over again active duty here now in Tennessee
[03:18:34.840 --> 03:18:41.600]  Chris let's be clear under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act under
[03:18:41.600 --> 03:18:45.560]  what brigade homeland has announced I mean you're not telling us anything of
[03:18:45.560 --> 03:18:50.320]  the that is secret this is on record but you're saying even the guys know that
[03:18:50.320 --> 03:18:55.400]  they are training for martial law in America yeah I was I asked them like
[03:18:55.400 --> 03:18:58.600]  if you've received any training on martial law or anything like that
[03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:03.520]  he's like you know like the big problem that I see Alex is that a lot of these
[03:19:03.520 --> 03:19:09.080]  people are really dumb like if you go to the base where my brother is it's like
[03:19:09.080 --> 03:19:13.880]  a fancy trailer park basically with their everybody running around with IQs
[03:19:13.880 --> 03:19:18.000]  like Forrest Gump and 10 kids running around everything and that's where the
[03:19:18.000 --> 03:19:23.680]  problem is that's where the Nazis are in the military is just ignorant you know
[03:19:23.680 --> 03:19:27.720]  like the smart people in the military are really coming around waking up
[03:19:27.720 --> 03:19:31.920]  especially since Obama got elected but there's just a lot of stupid people in
[03:19:31.920 --> 03:19:38.640]  the military and so he's like yeah we're training martial law watch
[03:19:38.640 --> 03:19:43.920]  citizens every day huh yeah well I don't even think you really understood what it
[03:19:43.920 --> 03:19:47.760]  what it means you know the guy that I talked to he did say yeah we've got
[03:19:47.760 --> 03:19:51.480]  training on martial law but I mean he didn't understand what that meant I
[03:19:51.480 --> 03:19:55.400]  tried to explain it to him but you tell him way over his head and everything
[03:19:55.400 --> 03:19:59.040]  stay there I got a few other questions for you and then other military vets
[03:19:59.040 --> 03:20:02.360]  current people active duty it's all coming up stay with us

[03:24:40.120 --> 03:24:43.200]  to take on two parties and take them to concentration camps that's in the
[03:24:43.200 --> 03:24:48.640]  documents for decades they've been training to take us on quietly with
[03:24:48.640 --> 03:24:53.880]  small cadres building into bigger forces slow brainwashing incremental now
[03:24:53.880 --> 03:24:58.840]  they're deploying army at checkpoints marines at checkpoints in the middle of
[03:24:58.840 --> 03:25:04.160]  the nation to stop drunk drivers they're preparing everyone to go against the
[03:25:04.160 --> 03:25:07.840]  American people the American people even peacefully try to say no we're not
[03:25:07.840 --> 03:25:13.120]  going into a new world order this is the time it's coming down to it now I want
[03:25:13.120 --> 03:25:17.800]  to now hurry through the calls finishing up with Chris active duty talking to the
[03:25:17.800 --> 03:25:21.360]  folks at brigade homeland going yeah we're training for martial law yeah
[03:25:21.360 --> 03:25:25.400]  we're surveilling the American people I mean I've talked to family who are
[03:25:25.400 --> 03:25:29.240]  officers in the military and they say even repair units that you know fix
[03:25:29.240 --> 03:25:32.720]  helicopters and things are for the first time ever being trained in riot
[03:25:32.720 --> 03:25:38.800]  control and martial law and the military needs to read the actual officer level
[03:25:38.800 --> 03:25:42.400]  manuals because they're training to take on veterans I mean is this
[03:25:42.400 --> 03:25:46.400]  disgusting people in the military that you talk to don't they understand that
[03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:49.720]  they're going to be out of the military soon and then every dictatorship goes
[03:25:49.720 --> 03:25:55.080]  after the veterans first it's disgusting some people once they realize that a
[03:25:55.080 --> 03:25:59.360]  lot of people don't even realize the extent that it's going on and when I
[03:25:59.360 --> 03:26:03.680]  point out to them a lot of times it will discuss them but still nobody a lot of
[03:26:03.680 --> 03:26:07.120]  people are afraid to do anything about it nobody wants to stand up and talk
[03:26:07.120 --> 03:26:10.880]  about it or even join oath keepers for the most part the exception of a few
[03:26:10.880 --> 03:26:15.760]  people that have met but I just want to encourage everybody all the brothers and
[03:26:15.760 --> 03:26:20.200]  sisters that are in the military to not be afraid to talk to people and you'd
[03:26:20.200 --> 03:26:24.840]  be surprised how many people you find that actually agree with you and just
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:28.280]  uphold your oath to the Constitution no matter what you know because that's
[03:26:28.280 --> 03:26:32.200]  that's why you join the military yeah yeah God bless you and I appreciate your
[03:26:32.200 --> 03:26:37.800]  call Chris look the feds under FBI command said don't let people walk out
[03:26:37.800 --> 03:26:41.120]  on the bridges make them stay don't give them food and water going to the rich
[03:26:41.120 --> 03:26:45.600]  areas that weren't affected that were high on high ground take their guns all
[03:26:45.600 --> 03:26:48.680]  the arms will be taken no one will allow to be armed that's the quote of the
[03:26:48.680 --> 03:26:54.080]  police chief and the military did what they were told and a lot of us citizens
[03:26:54.080 --> 03:26:57.280]  were killed and they went old ladies houses that wanted to stay there and
[03:26:57.280 --> 03:27:00.200]  take care of their dogs and cats and they took their guns and drug them off
[03:27:00.200 --> 03:27:04.360]  to jail I mean this is America and they passed the test and the new
[03:27:04.360 --> 03:27:08.680]  orders said good you'll do it we're getting ready for it and it is going to
[03:27:08.680 --> 03:27:13.120]  happen if we don't scream bloody murder let's talk to Roger and then Carl Mike
[03:27:13.120 --> 03:27:17.760]  and others Mike says his uncles in the military has key info but let's talk to
[03:27:17.760 --> 03:27:22.600]  Roger former military Roger what's your take on this once we talk to Roger let's
[03:27:22.600 --> 03:27:28.080]  talk to Carl in Texas go ahead Carl hey hey buddy how you doing there man I'm
[03:27:28.080 --> 03:27:31.120]  just sick of it I wish this nightmare would stop I wish people wake up and
[03:27:31.120 --> 03:27:37.000]  men and say no well I'll tell you this I'm in an interracial relationship my
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:40.800]  wife's African-American I'm I'm white if you want to call it that Hispanic and
[03:27:40.800 --> 03:27:45.560]  you know I just wanted to say thanks to Dr. Bowman for what he's done with his
[03:27:45.560 --> 03:27:49.520]  group so far to make a point of support of the diversity that I'm personally
[03:27:49.520 --> 03:27:53.320]  seeing more and more of on his website and YouTube account through the videos
[03:27:53.320 --> 03:27:58.680]  that he's shown with people of color and their viewpoint and what they see about
[03:27:58.680 --> 03:28:02.000]  the Constitution and Bill of Rights that's not only help them in their
[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:05.360]  in their understanding but understanding those rights and gaining a
[03:28:05.360 --> 03:28:10.320]  deeper conviction and the point I just wanted to say that this is clearly not
[03:28:10.320 --> 03:28:15.480]  an exclusive group for a certain race of people and those keepers is meant for
[03:28:15.480 --> 03:28:19.320]  all Americans of all races and that's really what I was just calling for I
[03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:23.640]  just wanted to make that point well I appreciate your call and because here's
[03:28:23.640 --> 03:28:28.080]  the issue the media is saying the oath keepers are treasonous they're saying
[03:28:28.080 --> 03:28:32.280]  anybody who doesn't want to banking take over as racist they are injecting race
[03:28:32.280 --> 03:28:36.720]  into the debate to get us at each other's throats God bless you I really

[03:33:12.240 --> 03:33:18.440]  veteran Henry Michigan ex-military and others here in just a moment then I want
[03:33:18.440 --> 03:33:21.720]  to get into some financial news I'm not gonna have time today to get into Bill
[03:33:21.720 --> 03:33:25.600]  Gates saying we need to vaccinate the population to quote reduce the population
[03:33:25.600 --> 03:33:31.240]  that's a quote and that we need to have zero carbon dioxide output bring it to
[03:33:31.240 --> 03:33:35.720]  zero which humans exhale he said that the same speech and the big crowd of
[03:33:35.720 --> 03:33:39.840]  globalists were laughing and smiling and giggling just pure evil I'll have to
[03:33:39.840 --> 03:33:43.080]  cover that tomorrow and integrate it with a new video clip of similar things
[03:33:43.080 --> 03:33:48.520]  being said and pushed where the same group that Bill Gates is promoting was
[03:33:48.520 --> 03:33:54.720]  in a speech they were saying that we need to be like China who's now giving
[03:33:54.720 --> 03:33:59.240]  people jobs according to their genetics and their DNA this is the essence of
[03:33:59.240 --> 03:34:03.000]  eugenics we're going to cover that tomorrow because this broke during the
[03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:07.720]  show and Paul Watson and Kurt Nemo put an article together the latest version is
[03:34:07.720 --> 03:34:13.480]  at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com US Army trains to confront Tea Party
[03:34:13.480 --> 03:34:18.280]  terrorist it describes Tea Partiers as former vets who were drunkards who hate
[03:34:18.280 --> 03:34:22.720]  the government and are training to kill military and police it describes them as
[03:34:22.720 --> 03:34:27.160]  absolute scum trash and white supremacist and says they must be taken on
[03:34:27.160 --> 03:34:32.240]  and they have drills where the Tea Party people are absolute scum and where the
[03:34:32.240 --> 03:34:38.000]  military takes them on and kills some and takes others to FEMA camps US Army
[03:34:38.000 --> 03:34:41.600]  trains to confront Tea Party terrorists as the headline military personnel
[03:34:41.600 --> 03:34:46.080]  blow the whistle and exercise which involved troops taking protesters to
[03:34:46.080 --> 03:34:51.680]  concentration camps and then he goes through all of that we have the actual
[03:34:51.680 --> 03:34:55.120]  army documents and of course the courier journals reporting this like it's a
[03:34:55.120 --> 03:34:59.760]  good thing this is in mainstream news and then they had an exercise the 23rd of
[03:34:59.760 --> 03:35:05.040]  this month and the 26th they're having similar ones all over the country but
[03:35:05.040 --> 03:35:11.200]  again you can go to the website and read these documents where they just
[03:35:11.200 --> 03:35:16.880]  absolutely train the troops the American people are the enemy and this is all
[03:35:16.880 --> 03:35:21.360]  ahead of government staged attacks to be blamed on the American people and then
[03:35:21.360 --> 03:35:28.600]  Curtin Watson go through and give all these examples the New York Times you
[03:35:28.600 --> 03:35:31.720]  know where kids are being trained the Boy Scouts to take on disgruntled veterans
[03:35:31.720 --> 03:35:35.360]  and kill them and seek and destroy operations we reported on Missouri
[03:35:35.360 --> 03:35:39.640]  National Guard unit at Camp Crowder engaging training exercises designed to
[03:35:39.640 --> 03:35:45.640]  take on fictitious militia group it's just article after article Marines
[03:35:45.640 --> 03:35:50.520]  running checkpoints Army running checkpoints in Iowa we interviewed the
[03:35:50.520 --> 03:35:53.480]  Colonel involved they admitted they're doing door-to-door gun confiscation
[03:35:53.480 --> 03:35:58.680]  drills against the American people we give you some of the back story and
[03:35:58.680 --> 03:36:02.360]  other examples to give you a clear picture of exactly what's going on I
[03:36:02.360 --> 03:36:09.360]  mean this is this is just insane what is happening right now and you can see it
[03:36:09.360 --> 03:36:15.520]  all building towards the head John and Kansas whose military go ahead John tell
[03:36:15.520 --> 03:36:22.600]  us about any information you have on this yeah like I was going I guess you
[03:36:22.600 --> 03:36:29.080]  know we've all been instructed not to talk about the preparations that are
[03:36:29.080 --> 03:36:34.360]  being made particularly training that is being given right now to even the
[03:36:34.360 --> 03:36:39.720]  delayed enlistment program first of all they're going to the Army oh I forgot
[03:36:39.720 --> 03:36:45.840]  that was in the news three years ago that San Antonio ROTC that their drills
[03:36:45.840 --> 03:36:49.720]  are all to take on militias and kill them see I mean I can't even remember all
[03:36:49.720 --> 03:36:54.760]  the cases sorry that guy's Google San Antonio ROTC training to kill
[03:36:54.760 --> 03:36:59.360]  militias I'm sorry sorry sir go ahead no no that's fine yeah the same thing like
[03:36:59.360 --> 03:37:03.760]  with the Boy Scouts that are being trained specifically to go to target
[03:37:03.760 --> 03:37:09.960]  the military and you know military veterans and militia members but it's
[03:37:09.960 --> 03:37:13.600]  I mean regardless nobody I'm gonna shut up because this is key info but I just
[03:37:13.600 --> 03:37:18.640]  want to add this think about the magnitude that the real training isn't
[03:37:18.640 --> 03:37:21.440]  for Muslims that are supposedly the bogeyman they're gonna get us it's
[03:37:21.440 --> 03:37:25.680]  almost all for gun owning Americans I mean the government is out of control
[03:37:25.680 --> 03:37:29.320]  and criminal I'm gonna shut up you're saying you're being told not to talk we
[03:37:29.320 --> 03:37:32.840]  have all these documents the military's leaking so certainly a lot of the troops
[03:37:32.840 --> 03:37:37.160]  are upset tell us exactly what you know what you're being told and and and give
[03:37:37.160 --> 03:37:43.480]  the military's buying this go ahead yeah and so so anyways training has been
[03:37:43.480 --> 03:37:50.560]  going on for at least the last two years now that to specifically as soon as
[03:37:50.560 --> 03:37:54.760]  bootcamp is over everyone we're all gonna be deployed onto the streets
[03:37:54.760 --> 03:37:58.320]  actually to work with the police we're being trained to work with the police
[03:37:58.320 --> 03:38:03.680]  specifically to assist the police force on the ground and it's four times of
[03:38:03.680 --> 03:38:08.320]  public dissent and civil unrest and we're being tied crowd control
[03:38:08.320 --> 03:38:13.120]  cuddling techniques I mean you name it it's in there and it's all specifically
[03:38:13.120 --> 03:38:17.440]  targeted for dissenting Americans and look at the g-20 we have the troops there
[03:38:17.440 --> 03:38:20.840]  we walk up say what about posse commentatus and they say we're here to
[03:38:20.840 --> 03:38:27.720]  aid the police but that's illegal and you notice that all of the personnel that
[03:38:27.720 --> 03:38:32.280]  we're firing the sound cannons they were all military that's because it is
[03:38:32.280 --> 03:38:37.800]  actually developed for war and control over in war zone in Iraq and Afghanistan
[03:38:37.800 --> 03:38:41.520]  so you know it's better to have the military personnel operate operating
[03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:45.800]  you know the device and they use the less lethal weapons even there they they
[03:38:45.800 --> 03:38:48.920]  call them less lethal the rubber bullets and everything and they have the troops
[03:38:48.920 --> 03:38:54.320]  now firing the guns firing the sound cannons at the people this is all a
[03:38:54.320 --> 03:39:01.000]  training aid towards real bullets right right and it's just progressively you
[03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:05.320]  know as if you know I mean imagine everybody always in the the you know
[03:39:05.320 --> 03:39:08.520]  protests and stuff they're always running away they're always scared nobody
[03:39:08.520 --> 03:39:13.360]  does anything if anything it's the provocateur you know undercovers that
[03:39:13.360 --> 03:39:18.200]  are actually doing the violence or the anarchists so the military and the
[03:39:18.200 --> 03:39:21.080]  police have an excuse to engage them they've been caught over and over again
[03:39:21.080 --> 03:39:26.320]  Denver last year Canada okay okay please continue what tell us what else
[03:39:26.320 --> 03:39:31.080]  they're training for and what are other military people you're talking to are
[03:39:31.080 --> 03:39:37.120]  they starting to understand what's happening well the sad thing is you can
[03:39:37.120 --> 03:39:40.800]  get people to realize and agree on the Constitution and you know what they're
[03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:45.640]  supposed to uphold but at the same time nobody realizes how important it is so
[03:39:45.640 --> 03:39:48.720]  I think when it comes down to it most people are just gonna fall in line and
[03:39:48.720 --> 03:39:51.880]  if there's one or two dissenters in the ranks well we've been training how to
[03:39:51.880 --> 03:39:55.920]  deal with dissent so they'll get dealt with I mean that's not right there stop
[03:39:55.920 --> 03:40:02.520]  right there they'll be dealt with but tell us about that training well again
[03:40:02.520 --> 03:40:05.400]  I don't know how much we're supposed to go into I mean actually I don't think
[03:40:05.400 --> 03:40:07.960]  we're supposed to go into any of this but you know what well sir this is all
[03:40:07.960 --> 03:40:12.440]  illegal what's going on and they're they're they're now acclimating the
[03:40:12.440 --> 03:40:16.680]  public with Marine Corps Army National Guard homeland security checkpoints the
[03:40:16.680 --> 03:40:19.480]  governor of Tennessee says they can't do what they do it they're doing it in
[03:40:19.480 --> 03:40:23.560]  California they're surveilling everybody in Austin they're building bases all
[03:40:23.560 --> 03:40:27.800]  over the place I mean this is all going on this is criminal this is our military
[03:40:27.800 --> 03:40:31.800]  we paid for to be used against us so offshore banks can engage in a takeover
[03:40:31.800 --> 03:40:36.280]  of the US how I mean sir I already know what they do okay I already know what
[03:40:36.280 --> 03:40:39.600]  the training is you're trained to take them into custody and put them in handcuffs
[03:40:39.600 --> 03:40:45.120]  and take them away well just let me affirm I can confirm that everything you
[03:40:45.120 --> 03:40:50.160]  talk about is 100% true and there are so many people out there that are just so
[03:40:50.160 --> 03:40:53.840]  brainwashed and like I don't know if it's if they're not smart enough or they
[03:40:53.840 --> 03:40:57.280]  just don't want to believe it because it seems so terrible because you know we've
[03:40:57.280 --> 03:41:01.080]  all been brought up now for you know what 60 years straight now and this
[03:41:01.080 --> 03:41:04.920]  brainwashing of oh America is gonna you know never do anything you know we're
[03:41:04.920 --> 03:41:08.640]  so much better and above all these other third-world countries and stuff and you
[03:41:08.640 --> 03:41:11.720]  know most of time we're the ones going over there and starting the shit in
[03:41:11.720 --> 03:41:18.200]  third-world countries all right sir I appreciate your call but be careful yeah
[03:41:18.200 --> 03:41:23.280]  yeah don't John I understand you're upset and angry but do you understand how
[03:41:23.280 --> 03:41:27.480]  essential it is for military men and women to go public to the mainstream
[03:41:27.480 --> 03:41:33.360]  media and to go on YouTube and to speak out I mean troops have said no you know
[03:41:33.360 --> 03:41:38.720]  after massacres you have a respect the Germans just following orders won't
[03:41:38.720 --> 03:41:44.120]  cover it the Germans people were hung who followed orders and it is essential
[03:41:44.120 --> 03:41:47.600]  that all the military people come out and speak out and obviously you're
[03:41:47.600 --> 03:41:51.960]  calling in these documents continue to get leaked so that that shows that the
[03:41:51.960 --> 03:41:56.640]  military at many levels is concerned you have any other comments I was
[03:41:56.640 --> 03:42:01.520]  wondering if you're gonna be going to the G20 this year and trauma no I'm
[03:42:01.520 --> 03:42:08.800]  probably not I mean I've got such Sony duties here and and then there's all the
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:13.520]  I'm a big target now but I do need to still go to events it's just that I
[03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:18.640]  mean they can plant weapons on me that they've already tried in Denver and as
[03:42:18.640 --> 03:42:23.320]  people haven't lived it they just haven't experienced it and I the operation I'm
[03:42:23.320 --> 03:42:26.760]  running is so important that's basically it's like I'm a general now I've got to
[03:42:26.760 --> 03:42:30.280]  sit back in the headquarters and I don't even morally like to send my guys off
[03:42:30.280 --> 03:42:33.880]  because they get arrested and set up and they try to set the guys up when they
[03:42:33.880 --> 03:42:38.440]  were out there but I really should be going to these events but but but but
[03:42:38.440 --> 03:42:43.360]  more citizens should be going out to these events and but I've spent lots of
[03:42:43.360 --> 03:42:48.040]  time out in the field believe me I I mean until you have them try to set fires
[03:42:48.040 --> 03:42:51.760]  and blaming on you you just don't know how hardcore this is and how much they've
[03:42:51.760 --> 03:42:58.200]  trained them to hate the American people but God help us John separately you know
[03:42:58.200 --> 03:43:00.840]  we've had all these people calling in about how they they were trained to take
[03:43:00.840 --> 03:43:04.600]  on militias specifically I mean we have their documents it's tea parties
[03:43:04.600 --> 03:43:09.400]  militias everybody I mean have you seen any of that yeah I mean that's
[03:43:09.400 --> 03:43:12.480]  specifically you know the people that are supposedly against the new world
[03:43:12.480 --> 03:43:16.240]  order that are against you know and they all say that it's like you know these
[03:43:16.240 --> 03:43:19.680]  people are crazy like haha there's no new world order you know but that this is
[03:43:19.680 --> 03:43:23.960]  what they think and you know the people that are are against the Federal
[03:43:23.960 --> 03:43:26.800]  Reserve is a big one for some reason anybody who doesn't like the Federal
[03:43:26.800 --> 03:43:34.680]  Reserve is a terrorist you know I mean so 99% of the American people are
[03:43:34.680 --> 03:43:39.160]  against the Federal Reserve in a national polls it's above 80% wanted
[03:43:39.160 --> 03:43:43.200]  abolished or audited everybody knows the bankers are a bunch of crooks at the
[03:43:43.200 --> 03:43:48.040]  national level international level and and and that's actually in army
[03:43:48.040 --> 03:43:51.040]  documents we have in federal documents so you're not telling us anything that
[03:43:51.040 --> 03:43:55.840]  isn't public but but specifically so they get the commander up in front of the
[03:43:55.840 --> 03:44:00.440]  group they show you PowerPoints they laugh at people it's all a big joke I
[03:44:00.440 --> 03:44:03.560]  mean we have their doubt they call us drunks they call us all these names I
[03:44:03.560 --> 03:44:07.240]  mean is that basically what's going on right I mean it's called it means this
[03:44:07.240 --> 03:44:10.200]  class whenever you're going to class I mean we you get training provide you
[03:44:10.200 --> 03:44:12.840]  there's different types of training that you get you know there's the training in
[03:44:12.840 --> 03:44:16.520]  the classroom there's training that's like actual hands-on and you know then
[03:44:16.520 --> 03:44:20.640]  use drills with assisting with with National Guard and the police force and
[03:44:20.640 --> 03:44:26.360]  like national level exercise that's an easy big one so you know everyone
[03:44:26.360 --> 03:44:30.080]  trains for that and the training just keeps getting more realistic and more
[03:44:30.080 --> 03:44:34.000]  specifically seems to be targeted directly at you know descending
[03:44:34.000 --> 03:44:36.840]  Americans that are just protecting their rights you know it doesn't really
[03:44:36.840 --> 03:44:40.640]  seem like anybody's doing anything that we haven't always done you know that
[03:44:40.640 --> 03:44:45.640]  makes but but in the drill manuals in the scenario manuals militias and tea
[03:44:45.640 --> 03:44:49.640]  party members are described as Ku Klux Klan running around with guns that want
[03:44:49.640 --> 03:44:52.880]  to murder everyone drinking whiskey I mean that that's we people can go read
[03:44:52.880 --> 03:44:56.880]  it right now three pages of this garbage that was just going on four days
[03:44:56.880 --> 03:45:04.120]  ago and it's total demonization what type of demonization have you seen well
[03:45:04.120 --> 03:45:08.520]  definitely they are beating into everyone's heads like you know that
[03:45:08.520 --> 03:45:12.000]  these people are personally have something against us like so that they
[03:45:12.000 --> 03:45:14.960]  want to bring out that's like kind of a psychological thing that I noticed they
[03:45:14.960 --> 03:45:19.080]  do they try a lot of psychological getting you to you know think of them as
[03:45:19.080 --> 03:45:22.480]  not human they're you know dehumanize them so you don't care to go after them
[03:45:22.480 --> 03:45:24.960]  and use your full force against them and feel that you there's definitely a
[03:45:24.960 --> 03:45:28.400]  threat on you against them like these people hate the military they hate
[03:45:28.400 --> 03:45:32.200]  anybody who is you know they hate the police they're cop killers you know and
[03:45:32.200 --> 03:45:34.640]  there's like specific examples they give and like you know the huddery
[03:45:34.640 --> 03:45:37.520]  militia they're trying to kill all the cops I mean that's why that that's why
[03:45:37.520 --> 03:45:40.680]  they're doing these things so that way they can get us turned against them and
[03:45:40.680 --> 03:45:44.000]  not care not look at them as American citizens we're gonna look at them as
[03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:48.680]  traitors and dissenters that need to be put down because you know me belligerents
[03:45:48.680 --> 03:45:52.560]  they're now saying in the legislation us citizens and it says that we can be
[03:45:52.560 --> 03:45:57.560]  seized by the army for any reason for any intelligence reason or any reason
[03:45:57.560 --> 03:46:03.400]  directed by the president and exactly now now remember within two hours of that
[03:46:03.400 --> 03:46:08.640]  marine killing the cops in Pittsburgh they blamed me on the news and said I
[03:46:08.640 --> 03:46:11.840]  called for it and it turned out the guy was a white supremacist and posted all
[03:46:11.840 --> 03:46:15.840]  of the internet hating me national news was just here saying are you gonna cause
[03:46:15.840 --> 03:46:19.800]  violence national news says I'm calling for violence when I'm calling for the
[03:46:19.800 --> 03:46:24.680]  opposite I'm pointing out they're gonna stage it so you can see the setup that
[03:46:24.680 --> 03:46:29.120]  is going on and you're saying now it's almost entirely militia gun owners
[03:46:29.120 --> 03:46:36.080]  veterans they hate America we've got to get them well the idea is that there's
[03:46:36.080 --> 03:46:40.760]  gonna be a lot of unrest and that will be needed so there's definitely gonna be
[03:46:40.760 --> 03:46:45.560]  something false flagged stage to bring in the need for us I mean it's not gonna
[03:46:45.560 --> 03:46:48.080]  be just like we're gonna go on the streets and roll out and say we've had
[03:46:48.080 --> 03:46:51.880]  enough of you guys no I mean it's gonna be like there's gonna be some you know
[03:46:51.880 --> 03:46:59.960]  you know proverbial you know so yeah stuff in the fan so so anyways you know
[03:46:59.960 --> 03:47:03.880]  it's gonna be you know something going down and it's you know it seems to me
[03:47:03.880 --> 03:47:07.600]  like they might use anarchists or some type of provocateur you know when
[03:47:07.600 --> 03:47:11.480]  there's a moment of like you know maybe when they raise taxes and you know
[03:47:11.480 --> 03:47:14.640]  everything just gets to the certain level you know you can feel the boiling
[03:47:14.640 --> 03:47:18.080]  point already in our society well the system knows that I mean government's
[03:47:18.080 --> 03:47:22.360]  all just spending more more taxes grabbing everything more more more and
[03:47:22.360 --> 03:47:26.440]  then meanwhile that there's the military being trained that veterans are
[03:47:26.440 --> 03:47:31.760]  enemy and they hate the military I mean how transparent does this have to get
[03:47:31.760 --> 03:47:36.640]  and we know they set up Atari we know they write the I I told Atari in August
[03:47:36.640 --> 03:47:40.480]  of last year I said they're gonna set you up and claim you want to kill cops I
[03:47:40.480 --> 03:47:46.400]  had sickles on the air and I identified what that group was putting out and that
[03:47:46.400 --> 03:47:50.800]  they had FBI inside leading it and it's come out now in federal documents that
[03:47:50.800 --> 03:47:56.480]  in that that happened I mean I was able just by watching to specifically single
[03:47:56.480 --> 03:48:01.440]  out that intelligence operation because it was clownish how ridiculous it is and
[03:48:01.440 --> 03:48:05.680]  now they're gonna play out this script and the military is gonna have their
[03:48:05.680 --> 03:48:09.640]  parents pension funds taken and if mom and dad speak up you know their kids
[03:48:09.640 --> 03:48:15.200]  will say mom and dad were taken away they didn't like America and this is how
[03:48:15.200 --> 03:48:19.440]  it happens this is red dawn ladies and gentlemen and they've massively built
[03:48:19.440 --> 03:48:23.640]  this up that they've never trained the military at one-tenth of what we see
[03:48:23.640 --> 03:48:28.960]  now and again I'm gonna ask you I mean we heard earlier people calling in
[03:48:28.960 --> 03:48:33.880]  saying the military's waking up or are you seeing the military wake up I have
[03:48:33.880 --> 03:48:38.680]  really tried to wake up a lot of people and I find that for every it's probably
[03:48:38.680 --> 03:48:42.760]  usually about for every 10 people you try you get one to like fully awaken but
[03:48:42.760 --> 03:48:49.360]  you know I'm definitely seeing at least 25% strong people in the military are at
[03:48:49.360 --> 03:48:54.640]  least aware that something's going on and probably 50% of the people I or let
[03:48:54.640 --> 03:48:57.880]  me say 50% of the people are aware that at least something's going on and 25% of
[03:48:57.880 --> 03:49:01.840]  the people are definitely enough in to know that when things start going that
[03:49:01.840 --> 03:49:07.480]  way I think that there will be you know maybe a dissension spring off from you
[03:49:07.480 --> 03:49:10.280]  know like like the other callers said I think I don't really see how they're
[03:49:10.280 --> 03:49:15.040]  gonna do it you know without bringing in the blue helmets but I'm sure that's
[03:49:15.040 --> 03:49:19.800]  already in well you know Leo 9 at FEMA.gov says they're gonna they train
[03:49:19.800 --> 03:49:25.600]  last year with trips from 14 countries to take on the American scum right and
[03:49:25.600 --> 03:49:31.680]  you know I think that in 2010 that it's just gonna be I think probably about four
[03:49:31.680 --> 03:49:38.040]  times as many foreign troops so you you see the foreign troops trying to take us
[03:49:38.040 --> 03:49:42.680]  on well they're gonna have to because the foreign troops you know if anything
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:46.160]  would love the chance to come in and you know beat up on Americans you know
[03:49:46.160 --> 03:49:51.320]  that's like you know because the same zeitgeist brainwashing that they do on
[03:49:51.320 --> 03:49:55.280]  our society you know to hate these you know evil people from other parts of
[03:49:55.280 --> 03:50:00.760]  the country they do in other parts of the world to hate Americans and let's be
[03:50:00.760 --> 03:50:05.560]  clear though I've had military and police confirmed to me and pastors and
[03:50:05.560 --> 03:50:08.960]  the clergy response teams that whole secret program that we broke that's
[03:50:08.960 --> 03:50:13.280]  now national news and confirmed that they train them specifically that Alex
[03:50:13.280 --> 03:50:18.680]  Jones is evil have you been taught look out for Alex Jones material?
[03:50:18.680 --> 03:50:27.680]  What's funny you asked that because Alex Jones that training as given was actually one of the reasons why I really started to listen to you.
[03:50:27.680 --> 03:50:31.760]  Yeah it's backfiring on the enemy operation we're gonna defend America we're
[03:50:31.760 --> 03:50:35.960]  gonna defeat the global banking takeover imagine the veterans are bad the
[03:50:35.960 --> 03:50:40.040]  patriots people that don't want the banking takeover are bad Alex Jones is
[03:50:40.040 --> 03:50:43.720]  pure evil and so what were they saying this guy is very dangerous this is what
[03:50:43.720 --> 03:50:46.240]  I've been told stay there I gotta come back to you briefly I gotta hit some
[03:50:46.240 --> 03:50:50.960]  financial news this man right here Alex Jones has a kernel of truth this man is
[03:50:50.960 --> 03:50:56.760]  very persuasive he is deceptive and he wants to kill cops this man is evil and

[03:55:17.640 --> 03:55:22.000]  do it we've got to get the info out now this article is so important US Army
[03:55:22.000 --> 03:55:26.280]  trains to confront Tea Party terrorists now I can tell you how many military
[03:55:26.280 --> 03:55:28.960]  people and that's I've also been in reports I mean I've gotten government
[03:55:28.960 --> 03:55:33.240]  reports where my name is there now why do you specifically what were they
[03:55:33.240 --> 03:55:40.720]  saying about me in the training that you are a conspiracy den basically you
[03:55:40.720 --> 03:55:47.640]  would be considered leader and the like radical expression I guess so I'm like
[03:55:47.640 --> 03:55:52.560]  Osama bin Laden basically yeah they had a deck of cards for the patriots that be
[03:55:52.560 --> 03:55:57.800]  the ace of spades you'd be up there yeah but you know see what you do is you
[03:55:57.800 --> 03:56:02.080]  know the the people that are susceptible to be radicalized or whatever you would
[03:56:02.080 --> 03:56:06.520]  be you know what basically is your we're waking them up you know but they view
[03:56:06.520 --> 03:56:10.880]  that as you know radicalization so you know people that have been radicalized
[03:56:10.880 --> 03:56:15.520]  you know are you know it's kind of like the red and blue list thing you know
[03:56:15.520 --> 03:56:19.360]  you would be somebody on the red list definitely and the blue list people would
[03:56:19.360 --> 03:56:22.200]  be like your listeners that are kind of like would fall in line with you if
[03:56:22.200 --> 03:56:25.560]  there was a movement that started but at the same time could probably be brain
[03:56:25.560 --> 03:56:30.160]  washed to fall back into society and do they imply that I'm calling for
[03:56:30.160 --> 03:56:40.240]  violence well yes because we know that's the public script right and it's a
[03:56:40.240 --> 03:56:46.280]  dangerous rhetoric you know it is you know violent you know dangerous violent
[03:56:46.280 --> 03:56:51.560]  rhetoric and those types of things that definitely put yeah I'm on the air saying
[03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:56.480]  for 15 years at the military secretly training to go after gun owners and
[03:56:56.480 --> 03:57:00.000]  patriots and now they're going we're getting ready to go after gun owners and
[03:57:00.000 --> 03:57:03.520]  patriots and these nuts think we're getting ready to go after gun owners
[03:57:03.520 --> 03:57:06.920]  veterans and patriots these people are crazy they think we're getting ready to
[03:57:06.920 --> 03:57:12.240]  go after them that's why we're training to go after them exactly that's always
[03:57:12.240 --> 03:57:16.080]  the conundrum that I usually use to stomp people that are kind of not wanting
[03:57:16.080 --> 03:57:19.800]  to believe it it's okay sir we're out of time call me back tomorrow God bless you
[03:57:19.800 --> 03:57:22.640]  Ted's been holding for 30 minutes I wanted to get Ted up people could
