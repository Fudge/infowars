[00:00:04.832 --> 00:00:06.133]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.914]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.914 --> 00:00:09.675]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.257]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.257 --> 00:00:12.798]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:16.980]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.103]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.592 --> 00:00:37.873]  Welcome my friends, welcome.
[00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:45.601]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the four hours today and we're going to finish up with part two of an interview that we started last week.
[00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.765]  We'll do part two live here on the air with Dr. Bob Bowman coming up in the third hour today.
[00:00:51.647 --> 00:01:03.932]  We're going to open the phones up throughout the broadcast on any news item, any issue, anything happening locally in your area, any national news story you wish to discuss, any piece of legislation you wish to talk about.
[00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:07.353]  There is so much to discuss here.
[00:01:07.353 --> 00:01:16.197]  We also have the Democratic Party and the large Fortune 100 who are financing the illegal alien invasion.
[00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:30.166]  Bragging that they're going to have basically weeks and weeks of protests and demonstrations like the ones we saw back in 2005, 6, 7, and 8 pushing for total amnesty.
[00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.227]  The end of the nation.
[00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:33.537]  Total open borders.
[00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:39.939]  You don't have a country if you have open borders and just give a national ID card to anybody who comes here.
[00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:50.243]  And of course it will further bankrupt the nation because much of these individuals coming in are also getting on the government welfare dole, which the bankers love.
[00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:56.165]  Bankrupt things as fast as possible because the nations are all in debt to the banks who make the money up out of nothing.
[00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.774]  So we'll be discussing that today.
[00:02:02.774 --> 00:02:07.737]  That's the point I always make.
[00:02:07.737 --> 00:02:12.220]  There is really no country in the world, except for maybe North Korea,
[00:02:13.234 --> 00:02:14.815]  Of course, nobody's trying to get into North Korea.
[00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:17.477]  They're all trying to get out.
[00:02:17.477 --> 00:02:29.146]  But you have a lot of Latin Americans from south of the Mexican border, Guatemala and south of that point, who want to get into Mexico to get into the United States.
[00:02:30.597 --> 00:02:52.389]  And Mexico arrests anyone that doesn't have papers, anyone that is not from Mexico, who isn't in a tourist zone, and they take them to these dirt-floored concentration camps is the only way they can be described, where they are beat up and abused, and that is in the Associated Press today.
[00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.290]  And it's just, you know, I've said it many times,
[00:02:56.155 --> 00:03:15.951]  Can you imagine if, as an American, whether you're Hispanic, black, white, it doesn't matter, if you tried to go to Mexico right as your wife's water broke and you marched into a hospital and said, my baby is now going to be a Mexican citizen and you owe them free health care and my wife and I and the rest of my kids, we're all now going on government welfare.
[00:03:17.546 --> 00:03:35.790]  And then, if 30 million Americans down in Mexico, demanding everything free, started marching around, screaming and yelling, and attacking police, as they did in Arizona last week, you would be mowed down with machine gun bullets, not rubber bullets.
[00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.231]  Mexico is brutal and collapsing.
[00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:42.166]  So we have to secure the border now.
[00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:44.467]  The border is collapsing.
[00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:50.389]  Much of the Southwest, especially South Texas and West Texas, is financially collapsing because of this.
[00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.970]  And that's not my words.
[00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.530]  That's the government's own words.
[00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.731]  Failed state.
[00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:57.292]  Mexico has collapsed.
[00:03:57.292 --> 00:03:59.513]  All you've got is armed camps of government.
[00:04:00.513 --> 00:04:08.178]  Troops and installations guarding the resources and stealing the resources and the rest of the public is just ascending into bedlam.
[00:04:08.178 --> 00:04:20.407]  Now there are some cities and towns that are still untouched by this to a certain extent, but large sectors of Mexico is a unbelievable war zone.
[00:04:20.407 --> 00:04:25.110]  And the media for years kept this quiet, but not now, so we'll go over all of that coming up.
[00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.373]  Also, doctors sterilize Uzbek women by stealth.
[00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:36.724]  And you read this article, it doesn't give you any backstory of why this is happening.
[00:04:36.724 --> 00:04:41.188]  The government is getting IMF and World Bank funding to do this.
[00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:43.410]  Just like Peru.
[00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.792]  Just like India.
[00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:49.015]  Just like many other nations have been caught.
[00:04:49.015 --> 00:04:55.040]  And the point is, we should be honest about why this is happening, and discuss the fact that it's now being pushed and promoted here.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.982]  We'll talk about that as well and a lot of other key news.
[00:04:56.982 --> 00:04:57.883]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:01.500]  What's your home worth?
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.600]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.642]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:05:06.642 --> 00:05:14.365]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[00:06:04.721 --> 00:06:05.981]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.981 --> 00:06:09.643]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.643 --> 00:06:12.145]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:17.328]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.422 --> 00:06:24.665]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.665 --> 00:06:30.628]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.628 --> 00:06:34.850]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.132]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:45.074]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.074 --> 00:06:47.976]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:50.577]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:51.718]  It's here.

[00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:08.748]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.748 --> 00:08:11.730]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.433 --> 00:08:20.596]  Okay, I want to graze over some of the headlines, and then coming up in the next hour, I'm going to detail it all.
[00:08:20.596 --> 00:08:36.302]  In this hour, I'm going to open the phones up and take call after call, because I love the different directions that callers take us in, the wildcard aspect of information and directions we may not have gone in if not for the callers and the guests.
[00:08:36.302 --> 00:08:39.023]  But let me tell you about some of the news that is coming up.
[00:08:40.322 --> 00:08:41.122]  Proposal!
[00:08:41.122 --> 00:08:44.744]  All New Yorkers become organ donors.
[00:08:44.744 --> 00:08:47.706]  And that is WCBS-TV.
[00:08:47.706 --> 00:08:50.387]  That is not Alex Jones's headline.
[00:08:50.387 --> 00:08:52.048]  This is what Europe does.
[00:08:52.048 --> 00:08:54.390]  They know the public's not paying attention.
[00:08:54.390 --> 00:09:01.934]  They don't ask you when you're at the DMV in major European countries getting your driver's license or your worker ID pass.
[00:09:03.194 --> 00:09:11.398]  They just enroll you in it, and you have to know it's going on, and you have to go in and say, no, I want to be taken off of it.
[00:09:11.398 --> 00:09:12.699]  And it all sounds good.
[00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:30.448]  Oh, there's tens of thousands of people every year that need organs, and so many people die, and they didn't have access to organs, and other people die in car wrecks, but they weren't organ donors, so we have to throw them away.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:45.662]  In just a few minutes you can go use any major search engine and search the terms hospital caught stealing organs or hospital caught stealing liver or kidneys or hospital caught stealing corneas.
[00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:53.416]  Where I live, Austin, Texas, they've been caught repeatedly at city-run hospitals stealing people's corneas.
[00:09:53.416 --> 00:09:54.918]  They do not ask.
[00:09:54.918 --> 00:09:58.702]  They do not care if you are an organ donor or not.
[00:09:58.702 --> 00:10:00.684]  They're already stealing them.
[00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:02.026]  And I've told the story.
[00:10:03.826 --> 00:10:17.792]  About I was 15, taking driver safety in Dallas, Texas, and my dad, who's a dentist and also done oral surgery in hospitals, he said, son, don't sign the organ donor card.
[00:10:17.792 --> 00:10:18.713]  And I said, why?
[00:10:18.713 --> 00:10:23.235]  And he said, the word is from surgeons and physicians I know.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:37.524]  In Dallas and in other parts of the country, if you come in and aren't even brain dead and have a good chance of being revived, they will not give you as much care in some hospitals because they get kickbacks.
[00:10:37.524 --> 00:10:40.725]  They can get hundreds of thousands of dollars for your organs.
[00:10:40.725 --> 00:10:44.426]  And that was 20 years ago, 20 plus years ago.
[00:10:44.426 --> 00:10:46.506]  And I didn't believe it.
[00:10:46.506 --> 00:10:51.048]  You know, when you're 15 years old, you tend to not buy everything your parents are telling you.
[00:10:51.048 --> 00:10:54.429]  You know, you think you know everything.
[00:10:55.859 --> 00:11:06.226]  And then years later, I saw a 60 Minutes report on it, where hospitals in Chicago and other areas were killing people for their organs.
[00:11:06.226 --> 00:11:09.208]  And so that's what's so dangerous about this.
[00:11:09.208 --> 00:11:12.230]  They're also proposing taking prisoners' organs.
[00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.913]  Then that incentivizes putting innocent people in prison and giving them the death penalty.
[00:11:16.913 --> 00:11:21.536]  And of course, DNA has shown that more than a third of people on death row were innocent.
[00:11:22.296 --> 00:11:27.179]  And we now know about crime labs all over the country and at the federal level framing people.
[00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:30.741]  I mean it was in the news last week, the week before that.
[00:11:30.741 --> 00:11:34.804]  Just Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, L.A.
[00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.634]  In just the last month, just framing people en masse.
[00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:44.157]  So, we have a criminal government.
[00:11:44.157 --> 00:11:52.184]  They have almost completed the conversion of kicking all the good people out and having nothing but criminals in mid-level and high-level positions.
[00:11:52.184 --> 00:11:55.667]  They have almost completed the tyranny transfer.
[00:11:56.693 --> 00:12:03.655]  It's taken them decades for crooks to get into positions of power and then to recruit their buddies in.
[00:12:03.655 --> 00:12:06.736]  And now we are looking down the barrel of a gun.
[00:12:06.736 --> 00:12:09.397]  You can't trust anything the government says.
[00:12:09.397 --> 00:12:11.137]  You can't trust anything they say.
[00:12:11.137 --> 00:12:12.138]  I mean, you know that.
[00:12:12.138 --> 00:12:13.858]  How many times do they get caught lying?
[00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.739]  It's the exception when government isn't lying.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.061]  And who does the government work for?
[00:12:20.061 --> 00:12:21.962]  The big mega banks and corporations.
[00:12:21.962 --> 00:12:25.284]  So, that is coming up.
[00:12:25.284 --> 00:12:28.387]  Headline, all New Yorkers become organ donors.
[00:12:28.387 --> 00:12:30.868]  Ha ha!
[00:12:30.868 --> 00:12:36.752]  We're going to get into Mexico, how they treat American citizens, how they treat Latin American citizens.
[00:12:36.752 --> 00:12:38.593]  They're apologizing.
[00:12:38.593 --> 00:12:42.736]  Mexico acknowledges migrant abuse, pledges changes.
[00:12:42.736 --> 00:12:47.219]  I mean, I want to go into how Mexico treats outlanders.
[00:12:47.219 --> 00:12:47.800]  Outsiders.
[00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:59.720]  And then they're always screaming bloody murder about their citizens pouring over the border and sucking off the welfare system and becoming a political block.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:06.847]  And we'll go over that entire controversy that's unfolding with Arizona and the illegals saying they're going to demonstrate and march all over the country.
[00:13:06.847 --> 00:13:10.431]  I think that's great because a lot of times they get violent.
[00:13:11.479 --> 00:13:14.081]  You don't have to hire provocateurs to go make them look violent.
[00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:17.563]  A lot of times they get violent, and that'll discredit them further.
[00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:21.226]  And this will only wake up Americans even more.
[00:13:21.226 --> 00:13:33.234]  A lot of Americans five years ago weren't awake to the illegal alien situation, but after watching those giant marches with illegals waving Mexican flags and shitting down with the USA, it was a big fat wake-up call, wasn't it?
[00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:34.595]  Well, good!
[00:13:34.595 --> 00:13:35.275]  Come out!
[00:13:35.275 --> 00:13:36.376]  Get in the streets!
[00:13:36.376 --> 00:13:37.757]  March and rally!
[00:13:37.757 --> 00:13:45.742]  And you'll notice there won't be any SWAT teams, there won't be any riot cops attacking peaceful demonstrations of illegals.
[00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:48.024]  No, they only attack citizens.
[00:13:48.024 --> 00:13:51.826]  They're only giving the green light to attack citizens and to bully people.
[00:13:51.826 --> 00:14:02.174]  In fact, we have video and an article up on InfoWars.com today by Kurt Nemo, where a peaceful crowd of several hundred Tea Partiers in Illinois, in a town,
[00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:25.325]  We're gonna demonstrate down the street from where Obama was where he was scheduled to have a speech and first the Secret Service ordered the local riot police to push him down the road and then down the street even further and then they ordered him just to completely not allow him to demonstrate and the citizens started singing God Bless America and the police became so embarrassed
[00:14:26.175 --> 00:14:29.837]  That their commander said, that's it, forget it, and they marched off.
[00:14:29.837 --> 00:14:30.458]  Okay?
[00:14:30.458 --> 00:14:40.244]  We pushed these people a mile away from where Obama's gonna be, and now the Secret Service says, just completely violate the First Amendment, I'm not gonna do it.
[00:14:40.244 --> 00:14:44.287]  And it's that spirit of saying, I'm not gonna be part of this,
[00:14:44.947 --> 00:14:47.149]  I'm not going to violate people's rights.
[00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:49.772]  That's what's going to stop the New World Order right there.
[00:14:49.772 --> 00:14:51.934]  But I've seen that with the Secret Service myself.
[00:14:51.934 --> 00:14:54.657]  I've seen it so many demonstrations, so many rallies.
[00:14:54.657 --> 00:14:57.259]  First they say, go to the end of the street over there.
[00:14:57.259 --> 00:14:59.842]  I've had New York police do this to me, not just the Secret Service.
[00:14:59.842 --> 00:15:00.662]  And then you go to the corner.
[00:15:00.662 --> 00:15:02.865]  And then they say, go down that street now.
[00:15:03.857 --> 00:15:09.602]  I remember the case in Philadelphia where they arrested a bunch of preachers who were protesting a gay rights parade.
[00:15:09.602 --> 00:15:13.546]  And regardless of which side of that issue you're on, they should have the right to protest it.
[00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:17.469]  But they did arrest them, they did charge them, and then that got overturned in federal court.
[00:15:17.469 --> 00:15:20.032]  But it was the same thing on the video there.
[00:15:20.032 --> 00:15:26.577]  They said, okay, you can't be right here beside the, well it wasn't just a gay parade, that was part of it.
[00:15:28.032 --> 00:15:28.793]  We're good to go.
[00:15:45.518 --> 00:15:47.000]  No protest.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:16:05.138]  But notice that when the illegal aliens in Arizona last Friday, and I'm sure a lot of you have seen the video now, it's been on local news, national news, pretty much had a blackout on it, but it's all over YouTube, we posted the videos, you just search the term illegal aliens riot in Arizona, I mean they were throwing
[00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:08.341]  Full cans of soda at people.
[00:16:08.341 --> 00:16:10.383]  That can really, that could kill you.
[00:16:10.383 --> 00:16:11.144]  It hits you in the temple.
[00:16:11.144 --> 00:16:12.865]  I mean, that's a dangerous weapon.
[00:16:12.865 --> 00:16:14.267]  They were throwing bottles of water.
[00:16:14.267 --> 00:16:19.051]  They were hitting people and the cops just stood there and took it.
[00:16:19.051 --> 00:16:20.973]  You do that and you're a citizen.
[00:16:20.973 --> 00:16:24.276]  You are going to get beat to death, probably.
[00:16:24.276 --> 00:16:28.079]  And if you're lucky, you'll just be beaten within an inch of your life and sent to the hospital.
[00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:32.083]  And then you're going to be charged with assaulting the police.
[00:16:32.083 --> 00:16:32.223]  Now,
[00:16:33.922 --> 00:16:35.563]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:16:35.563 --> 00:16:37.885]  I've always called for non-violence.
[00:16:37.885 --> 00:16:43.751]  If you do hit a cop in the head with a can of Coca-Cola, you probably should get cracked over the head with a billy club.
[00:16:43.751 --> 00:16:46.113]  I mean, you're assaulting them.
[00:16:46.113 --> 00:16:57.503]  If you assault me, if you come to my office or my house, or if I'm walking out of a restaurant and somebody walks up and tries to mug me and punches me in the face or hits me in the head with a club, I'm going to hit them right back.
[00:16:58.909 --> 00:17:06.597]  And so, why are the police so scared to death to even defend themselves from illegal aliens?
[00:17:06.597 --> 00:17:11.762]  Why does the National Guard run from illegal alien groups when they shoot at them?
[00:17:11.762 --> 00:17:13.724]  Or when Mexican troops come across and shoot at them?
[00:17:13.724 --> 00:17:16.987]  I mean, that's been in the news many, many, many times.
[00:17:16.987 --> 00:17:18.048]  Why?
[00:17:18.048 --> 00:17:23.053]  Why has our military and our police been told to roll over to this?
[00:17:24.545 --> 00:17:27.807]  And why have they been told to attack dog the American people?
[00:17:27.807 --> 00:17:32.369]  They're told, you can attack dog the American people and we'll back you up all the way.
[00:17:32.369 --> 00:17:44.854]  But any of you officers do anything to these illegal aliens, you're going to get demoted, you're going to get sent home without pay, you might even get fired.
[00:17:44.854 --> 00:17:48.536]  And that's on record that that is going on.
[00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:50.277]  You have to ask yourselves, why is that?
[00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:53.218]  So we'll also talk more about that coming up in the broadcast today.
[00:17:55.262 --> 00:18:06.665]  If I have time, I'm going to play the whole 8-minute speech to the Council on Foreign Relations that happened just a few days ago.
[00:18:06.665 --> 00:18:10.425]  But the article is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:10.425 --> 00:18:17.387]  Trochette calls for corrupt Bank of International Settlements to boss global government in CFR speech.
[00:18:18.655 --> 00:18:30.762]  And he said, global government, global governance is here, we've got to have this new banking structure that will control the planet, and he just went on, and on, and on, calling for world government.
[00:18:30.762 --> 00:18:34.924]  Run by the banks, which is exactly what the globalists have always said they would do.
[00:18:34.924 --> 00:18:43.689]  Then meanwhile, I had Nightline here earlier this week, and I would go try to show them video clips of Gordon Brown, Herman Van Rompuy,
[00:18:44.929 --> 00:18:47.910]  Calling for world government and they were not interested in it.
[00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:53.052]  And I finally made them watch one clip and he said, well, that's a different type of global government they're talking about.
[00:18:53.052 --> 00:18:54.492]  This is the denial.
[00:18:54.492 --> 00:18:57.153]  All these years there's no global government.
[00:18:57.153 --> 00:18:57.933]  We're crazy.
[00:18:57.933 --> 00:18:58.874]  It doesn't exist.
[00:18:58.874 --> 00:19:05.256]  And then now they're out in the open and the media says, well, but that's a different global government than what you're talking about.
[00:19:05.256 --> 00:19:08.057]  I mean, it's this denial that they're in.
[00:19:09.297 --> 00:19:18.984]  They've got their position, they're sticking to it, because there cannot be a real debate in this country about the global government that has been formed.
[00:19:18.984 --> 00:19:36.216]  And whether it's pre-emptive wars against Iraq and Iran and Afghanistan, or whether it's the Patriot Act and naked body scanners, or cell phones tracking everywhere you go, or laptops watching your kids at home with the government watching them without warrants, or open borders, it's all globalist policy.
[00:19:37.904 --> 00:19:41.007]  It's all globalist policy on record.
[00:19:41.007 --> 00:19:42.228]  We have their white papers.
[00:19:42.228 --> 00:19:43.389]  We have their plans.
[00:19:43.389 --> 00:19:45.791]  We have their blueprints.
[00:19:45.791 --> 00:19:47.413]  We had their blueprints decades ago.
[00:19:47.413 --> 00:19:49.215]  We knew what they were going to build.
[00:19:49.215 --> 00:19:55.901]  Now they've built the stinking thing, and they're putting the final fixtures in the House of Tyranny.
[00:19:55.901 --> 00:19:57.402]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[00:19:57.402 --> 00:19:57.763]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.317 --> 00:20:08.319]  It's no secret why pharmaceutical companies and mainstream media often question the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements.
[00:20:08.319 --> 00:20:16.922]  But isn't it ironic that mainstream pharmaceutical companies are the ones who manufacture overpriced prescription drugs that produce dangerous side effects?
[00:20:16.922 --> 00:20:21.683]  Do your own research and compare the herbal supplements offered at ResearchedHerbs.com.
[00:20:22.043 --> 00:20:22.424]  I think so.
[00:20:39.981 --> 00:20:40.582]  We're good to go.
[00:21:01.198 --> 00:21:02.219]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:07.744]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:21:07.744 --> 00:21:08.285]  I get it.
[00:21:08.285 --> 00:21:17.914]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:21:17.914 --> 00:21:19.336]  That's not what's happening.
[00:21:19.336 --> 00:21:23.700]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.741]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[00:21:25.741 --> 00:21:27.781]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:21:27.781 --> 00:21:31.182]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:21:31.182 --> 00:21:35.444]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:21:35.444 --> 00:21:37.044]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:21:37.044 --> 00:21:41.005]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[00:21:41.005 --> 00:21:44.826]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:21:44.826 --> 00:21:45.727]  You should too.
[00:21:45.727 --> 00:21:46.867]  Find out what they know.
[00:21:46.867 --> 00:21:50.248]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:21:50.248 --> 00:21:50.288]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:55.070]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.291]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:58.291 --> 00:22:03.052]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:22:03.052 --> 00:22:05.453]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:22:05.453 --> 00:22:08.674]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:08.674 --> 00:22:13.776]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:13.776 --> 00:22:17.957]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:18.277 --> 00:22:20.620]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.522]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:23.522 --> 00:22:26.425]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:26.425 --> 00:22:33.993]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:34.364 --> 00:22:39.749]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:39.749 --> 00:22:42.611]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:46.294]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:46.294 --> 00:22:47.375]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:47.375 --> 00:22:48.716]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:48.716 --> 00:22:50.218]  Invisible Empire.

[00:23:51.591 --> 00:23:51.971]  MyPillow.
[00:23:51.971 --> 00:23:52.891]  For the rest of your life.
[00:24:08.839 --> 00:24:26.082]  Okay, we're going to go to your phone calls throughout the rest of this hour and the second hour, but I also want to play a clip that we played a month ago of Bill Gates at TED TV.
[00:24:26.082 --> 00:24:35.564]  It's like an Al Gore propaganda type channel where they have these little speeches where he talked about vaccinating the population to reduce
[00:24:37.267 --> 00:24:43.996]  The human population and how we must cut CO2 emissions to zero when humans are exhaling CO2 and it's a life-giving gas.
[00:24:43.996 --> 00:24:53.207]  I mean, I have NASA here very excited that they found high levels of methane from their latest probes in the atmosphere of Mars.
[00:24:54.281 --> 00:24:57.444]  And they know there's water there on the ice caps.
[00:24:57.444 --> 00:25:01.867]  And you normally only have methane on a planet like Mars if there's life.
[00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:03.909]  Methane is put off by life.
[00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:07.552]  But here they're declaring methane toxic and evil.
[00:25:07.552 --> 00:25:12.737]  All animal life releases methane-type gases.
[00:25:14.773 --> 00:25:18.014]  That's what happens when you pass gas, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:18.014 --> 00:25:22.115]  It's part of the process of life.
[00:25:22.115 --> 00:25:39.059]  It's just, to watch Bill Gates up there, and they had another PR person in another speech from TED TV I want to play a clip of, talking about how wonderful it's going to be when the government DNA test you and decides what job you're going to have.
[00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:41.460]  That is Brave New World.
[00:25:42.813 --> 00:25:51.519]  That is the ultimate class system where the government decides what type of person you are from your DNA.
[00:25:51.519 --> 00:26:00.724]  Why do you think for 37 plus years they've been taking baby's blood globally in almost every major nation under the IMF World Bank control and putting it in secret databases?
[00:26:00.724 --> 00:26:03.146]  They now admit it is a eugenics database.
[00:26:03.146 --> 00:26:06.448]  All right, I'm already digressing.
[00:26:06.448 --> 00:26:07.749]  This is so real.
[00:26:09.875 --> 00:26:12.396]  This is so real, what's happening.
[00:26:12.396 --> 00:26:15.697]  Herman in New York, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:26:15.697 --> 00:26:17.458]  Yes, hello Alex, can you hear me?
[00:26:17.458 --> 00:26:18.918]  Yes, sir.
[00:26:18.918 --> 00:26:20.979]  Yes, I have one comment and two questions.
[00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:38.725]  Alright, my first comment is pretty much the black media is all over the place trying to marginalize the Tea Party, saying that they're racist and, you know, here they go again dividing us and it's pretty much just so counterproductive when everybody can see that it has nothing to do with race at all.
[00:26:39.249 --> 00:26:53.499]  And my first question pretty much is, the next false flag, whether it's nuclear or however, the next major false flag, do you think it'll have the same effect as 9-11?
[00:26:53.499 --> 00:26:54.859]  That's my first question.
[00:26:54.859 --> 00:27:03.045]  And my second question is, do you think this will be the opportunity to be more
[00:27:03.915 --> 00:27:04.235]  Thank you.
[00:27:04.235 --> 00:27:12.500]  Oklahoma has a new law where if you are in a militia, you get arrested, which violates the freedom of assembly and the freedom to meet with citizens.
[00:27:31.727 --> 00:27:35.488]  And the militia is in the Constitution.
[00:27:35.488 --> 00:27:38.149]  It's in the Bill of Rights.
[00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:39.249]  And I'm going to cover that later.
[00:27:39.249 --> 00:27:45.931]  I mean, it's such an amazing statement.
[00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:50.812]  And they've passed the bill outlawing militias and recruitment.
[00:27:53.188 --> 00:27:56.589]  It's like Oklahoma last year passed a law that you can't have burglar bars on your house.
[00:27:56.589 --> 00:27:58.569]  I mean, Oklahoma's got some serious problems.
[00:27:58.569 --> 00:28:02.110]  It's got some good people, some of the best, but also some of the worst.
[00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:13.392]  And to answer your question, that's where we're headed, where they're just going to ban free assembly and they're going to ban tea parties if they get their way.
[00:28:13.392 --> 00:28:16.273]  I mean, we have a whole slew of White House
[00:28:17.387 --> 00:28:25.794]  Zars, Sunstein and others, Cass Sunstein, saying ban conspiracy theories, ban criticizing the government.
[00:28:25.794 --> 00:28:32.440]  And he lists some of the most broad issues he can to set the benchmark.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:38.465]  He says, you will not be able to write or say that sunlight is good for you.
[00:28:38.465 --> 00:28:39.666]  He actually says that.
[00:28:39.666 --> 00:28:43.609]  You will not be able to criticize anthropogenic global warming or man-made global warming.
[00:28:43.609 --> 00:28:44.430]  I mean, these are quotes.
[00:28:47.089 --> 00:28:54.778]  So, we got the Diversity Czar calling for Hugo Chavez-style censorship here in the United States.
[00:28:54.778 --> 00:28:58.162]  It's got to be in its teens.
[00:28:58.162 --> 00:29:04.330]  I haven't counted them up, but it's more than 10 senators have called for the Fairness Doctrine to restrict free speech on talk radio.
[00:29:08.339 --> 00:29:20.043]  You know, I don't know exactly what type of false flag they're going to run, or how big it's going to be, and I don't know if it'll dwarf 9-11, but we know they're hyping nuclear false flag terror.
[00:29:20.043 --> 00:29:23.344]  We know they're hyping that Tea Parties are going to commit attacks.
[00:29:23.344 --> 00:29:28.105]  So I think it's going to be a cocktail of staged events.
[00:29:28.105 --> 00:29:30.266]  You know, when we come back, I'll comment on this more.
[00:29:30.266 --> 00:29:31.787]  It's a very important question.
[00:29:31.787 --> 00:29:35.568]  And as for the so-called black media that you brought up, African American media,
[00:29:38.444 --> 00:29:43.567]  Black folks ought to be asking them, why don't they talk about how 50 plus percent of blacks are never born in this country?
[00:29:43.567 --> 00:29:48.089]  I mean, why don't they talk about some real issues that actually affect the black community?
[00:29:48.089 --> 00:29:50.911]  No, they're just there to keep people stirred up.
[00:29:50.911 --> 00:29:52.292]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.292 --> 00:29:54.833]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.833 --> 00:29:57.515]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.782 --> 00:30:03.785]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.785 --> 00:30:09.112]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.112 --> 00:30:11.174]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.174 --> 00:30:16.180]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.361]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.361 --> 00:30:18.082]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.462 --> 00:30:20.343]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.343 --> 00:30:21.423]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.423 --> 00:30:23.624]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.624 --> 00:30:24.965]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.965 --> 00:30:26.485]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.485 --> 00:30:31.767]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.767 --> 00:30:35.349]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.349 --> 00:30:38.810]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.391]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.391 --> 00:30:41.292]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.292 --> 00:30:42.393]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.393 --> 00:30:43.314]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.314 --> 00:30:44.416]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.416 --> 00:30:47.479]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.479 --> 00:30:49.261]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.261 --> 00:30:50.161]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:59.844 --> 00:31:01.144]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:01.144 --> 00:31:06.726]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:06.726 --> 00:31:11.748]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:11.748 --> 00:31:16.790]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:22.554]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:22.554 --> 00:31:24.855]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:31:24.855 --> 00:31:29.658]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:31:29.658 --> 00:31:30.779]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:33.861]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:31:33.861 --> 00:31:37.464]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:31:37.464 --> 00:31:40.666]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:40.666 --> 00:31:42.887]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:42.887 --> 00:31:43.808]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:50.413]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:50.413 --> 00:31:56.518]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:56.518 --> 00:32:00.081]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:22.892]  Okay, I'm gonna finish up the questions the last caller asked me, and then I'll continue with your phone calls, but I wanted to take a few minutes out to talk about fluoride in our water supply.
[00:33:22.892 --> 00:33:35.836]  Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Joseph Borkin wrote a book about World War II, The Crime and Punishment of I.G.
[00:33:35.836 --> 00:33:36.256]  Farben,
[00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:41.677]  And you can actually read that book online for free.
[00:33:41.677 --> 00:33:42.898]  Google has it posted.
[00:33:42.898 --> 00:33:48.820]  And he says the first instance of Florida drinking water in history was in Germany's Nazi prison camps.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.021]  This is a Pulitzer Prize winner.
[00:33:51.021 --> 00:33:52.821]  He ran the U.S.
[00:33:52.821 --> 00:33:55.943]  antitrust program, by the way, and was involved in the prosecution of the Nazis.
[00:33:55.943 --> 00:33:58.744]  So this is a prestigious person telling you this.
[00:33:59.284 --> 00:34:03.468]  The first instance of Florida drinking water in history was in Germany's Nazi prison camps.
[00:34:03.468 --> 00:34:07.592]  The Gestapo had little concern about fluoride's supposed effect on children's teeth.
[00:34:07.592 --> 00:34:15.579]  Their reason for mass-medicating water in sodium fluoride was to sterilize humans and force the people in the concentration camps into calm submission.
[00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:32.031]  See, when we get up here and tell you that fluoride attacks all the organs, reduces fertility, and can sterilize, and doubles the chance of bone cancer alone, you need to go do the research instead of laughing about this.
[00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:35.434]  I know we have new listeners every day, every minute, tuning in.
[00:34:35.434 --> 00:34:36.735]  This is not funny.
[00:34:36.735 --> 00:34:41.859]  I had Nightline here two days ago, and I was trying to show them these documents, and they were just laughing about it.
[00:34:41.859 --> 00:34:42.459]  It's not
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.381]  Funny.
[00:34:44.381 --> 00:34:47.202]  And one of these guys has a son.
[00:34:47.202 --> 00:34:48.243]  And they were nice people.
[00:34:48.243 --> 00:34:49.403]  I don't think they're evil.
[00:34:49.403 --> 00:34:52.325]  They just think we're crazy.
[00:34:52.325 --> 00:35:00.769]  It doesn't matter if you get inside one of these plants and on the sacks of fluoride it says deadly poison causes organ failure.
[00:35:00.769 --> 00:35:03.630]  And it's one of the most cumulative toxins out there.
[00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.511]  It builds up in the body.
[00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:08.673]  I'm already ranting about this and I said I was going to go to your calls but I thought I would
[00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:11.362]  Talk about that.
[00:35:11.362 --> 00:35:15.725]  Joseph Borkin was the Chief Economic Advisor of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department.
[00:35:15.725 --> 00:35:20.189]  He was responsible for the wartime investigation of IG Farben.
[00:35:20.189 --> 00:35:26.273]  And he wrote several books on the subject.
[00:35:26.273 --> 00:35:28.054]  Look, I mean, it's a fact.
[00:35:28.054 --> 00:35:32.838]  And the Nazis learned this in 1937 from the Soviets.
[00:35:32.838 --> 00:35:34.299]  That's who they learned about it from.
[00:35:35.396 --> 00:35:37.336]  And they, of course, knew from U.S.
[00:35:37.336 --> 00:35:37.817]  research.
[00:35:37.817 --> 00:35:53.560]  I found a 1934 University of Texas study where they were looking at fluoride in rats, and they said this could be a sedative, and this could be used in mental patients, but it has toxic effects on the organs and bones, and attacks fertility.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.601]  So they said, we don't recommend it be used for that.
[00:35:55.601 --> 00:35:59.102]  I mean, you could pull up these studies all day long.
[00:35:59.102 --> 00:36:04.023]  They knew, they put it in your water, that's why Americans can't get upset, won't get involved.
[00:36:05.247 --> 00:36:06.728]  Alright, I'm going to go back to your calls here in a moment.
[00:36:06.728 --> 00:36:19.775]  I wanted to bring up the CEO of Acola Blue after I just discussed this, Jerome Jandon, because this is the best atmospheric water generator line out there, and they're also the most affordable, and it's what I use in my office and my home.
[00:36:19.775 --> 00:36:22.357]  And, Jerome, it's good to have you up with us today.
[00:36:22.357 --> 00:36:22.897]  Thanks, Danny.
[00:36:24.147 --> 00:36:25.449]  Thanks a lot.
[00:36:25.449 --> 00:36:25.949]  Yes, we are.
[00:36:25.949 --> 00:36:26.850]  That's why we're in this business.
[00:36:40.063 --> 00:37:00.113]  Well, I mean, let's talk a little bit about the Ecola Blue and the fact that it's one of the only water purification systems that has zero fluoride in it, because even the best filtration systems that you filter tap water through, fluoride is such a small, small particulate that almost no filter on Earth can take it out.
[00:37:00.113 --> 00:37:05.396]  One of the only ways to really get it out is to get clean water out of the air.
[00:37:06.468 --> 00:37:07.348]  That's true.
[00:37:07.348 --> 00:37:09.469]  I mean, we're more than the filtration, you know.
[00:37:09.469 --> 00:37:10.990]  We just generate water.
[00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.290]  That's what people are confused.
[00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:20.014]  The color blue is the only solution, you know, to this poisonous water and purification water.
[00:37:20.014 --> 00:37:22.915]  We do not take water to purify, to filter it.
[00:37:22.915 --> 00:37:25.616]  We generate water from the humidity of the air.
[00:37:25.616 --> 00:37:32.579]  So you're 100% free of bacteria, 100% fluid, you know, free, and 100% independent from the system.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.440]  Absolutely.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:40.565]  And when I say filter, even after you grab out of the air, you send it through 7 to 12 filters depending on what unit.
[00:37:40.565 --> 00:37:41.045]  That's true.
[00:37:41.045 --> 00:37:41.506]  You're right.
[00:37:41.506 --> 00:37:42.527]  Sorry, I misunderstood you.
[00:37:42.527 --> 00:37:43.347]  You're totally right.
[00:37:43.347 --> 00:37:46.690]  And through UV as well to kill any kind of bacteria.
[00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:50.873]  So you're totally free to drink it, to boil it for coffee or tea.
[00:37:50.873 --> 00:37:53.355]  And trust me, it does much better than tap water.
[00:37:53.355 --> 00:37:56.097]  And on top of that, you can use it for a newborn.
[00:37:56.097 --> 00:37:58.839]  You know, I've got a five weeks old girl.
[00:37:59.651 --> 00:38:00.974]  And I give it to her.
[00:38:00.974 --> 00:38:05.523]  To avoid me to make shopping and to get some bottled water.
[00:38:05.523 --> 00:38:08.529]  Which is dangerous for the pollution and for our nature.
[00:38:09.551 --> 00:38:14.535]  Well, to be clear here, again, it is a water generator.
[00:38:14.535 --> 00:38:17.638]  It grabs it out of the air, but then it sends it through the filtration system.
[00:38:17.638 --> 00:38:22.302]  But you're right, you're not filtering the tap water or some lake water.
[00:38:22.302 --> 00:38:30.909]  You are grabbing already the cleanest, purest water there is out of the atmosphere, and that's what the clouds are, and then putting it through filtration systems.
[00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:33.912]  Tell folks about some of the products available from AcolaBlue.com.
[00:38:34.844 --> 00:38:44.088]  Um, right now we've got the EB28, you know, which is a special, uh, machine with special, you know, um, uh, special price for you guys.
[00:38:44.088 --> 00:38:51.632]  And, uh, the Ecola Blue 28 is, uh, really available at $999, you know, $999.
[00:38:51.632 --> 00:38:57.934]  And especially for you, Alex, and for your audience, you know, we just give two years filter package, which is a $150 saving.
[00:38:59.915 --> 00:39:05.241]  That's right now, today, only for you, and it's available on acolorblue.com.
[00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:08.901]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[00:39:08.901 --> 00:39:10.242]  You know, Jerome?
[00:39:10.242 --> 00:39:10.922]  Yeah?
[00:39:10.922 --> 00:39:13.204]  I've been promoting this, I think, for about three years now.
[00:39:13.204 --> 00:39:14.024]  I know that.
[00:39:14.024 --> 00:39:15.385]  I know you have one and you use it.
[00:39:15.385 --> 00:39:15.945]  I know.
[00:39:15.945 --> 00:39:19.387]  Absolutely, and I don't think I've ever seen you guys offer a savings.
[00:39:19.387 --> 00:39:32.135]  I mean, normally, it's around $1,200 for the great unit, but $9.99 is already a huge discount, and then you add a two-year extra filter package.
[00:39:32.135 --> 00:39:34.977]  A two-year filter package, you know, for $150, you know, free.
[00:39:35.177 --> 00:39:37.879]  So I think this is the best deal I've ever seen you offer.
[00:39:37.879 --> 00:39:39.400]  But you know what?
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.242]  We have to play the game, and it's my point, you know.
[00:39:42.242 --> 00:39:46.985]  You're aware about the bottled water pollution on this planet and this nation as well?
[00:39:46.985 --> 00:39:48.506]  Are you aware that U.S.
[00:39:48.506 --> 00:39:52.789]  consumers are the first in the world to consume bottled water?
[00:39:52.789 --> 00:39:54.430]  And bottled water is in plastic.
[00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:56.132]  It's coming from oil.
[00:39:56.132 --> 00:39:59.334]  It generates a huge pollution in our country and in the world.
[00:40:00.316 --> 00:40:09.920]  Are you aware that there is, you know, a garbage patch in the Ocean Pacific, which is big, only with bottled water, big as twice Texas size.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.882]  Yeah, there's a giant floating island of just garbage that they... Giant floating, exactly.
[00:40:13.882 --> 00:40:22.666]  And the salty water just, you know, I would say, degradates a little bit, you know, the bottle, the plastic of the bottle, so it's oily around, it's awful.
[00:40:22.666 --> 00:40:26.527]  It's 870,000 square miles.
[00:40:26.527 --> 00:40:29.789]  You go on Google, you go Ocean Pacific garbage patch,
[00:40:30.484 --> 00:40:32.724]  You die, and you will see videos and pictures.
[00:40:32.724 --> 00:40:34.325]  You won't believe it.
[00:40:34.325 --> 00:40:49.628]  So just to avoid that, and to avoid, you know, just, you know, uh, generate more pollution for your kids and for your nation, and you got free water, as, you know, we mentioned, and we precise, you and I, and the gallon, you know, the price for the gallon with this machine is around 20 cents.
[00:40:49.628 --> 00:40:51.888]  20 cents a gallon.
[00:40:51.888 --> 00:40:55.429]  Whatever you go in the mall in your state, the best price you got is 99 cents a gallon.
[00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:57.591]  80% discount
[00:41:16.041 --> 00:41:18.401]  Yeah, totally agree, totally true, and people are not aware about that.
[00:41:18.401 --> 00:41:18.842]  That's so true.
[00:41:18.842 --> 00:41:21.242]  You know, I think it's one another, you know, a new order system.
[00:41:21.242 --> 00:41:24.023]  We're trying to make human beings not anymore with gender.
[00:41:24.023 --> 00:41:25.583]  Like, they don't have any roots.
[00:41:42.382 --> 00:41:51.404]  Yeah, making us docile.
[00:41:51.404 --> 00:41:54.924]  Well, we appreciate you, Jerome.
[00:41:54.924 --> 00:41:58.765]  I want to tell people about the savings, and you guys do the special once a month.
[00:41:58.765 --> 00:42:01.085]  This is the biggest savings I've ever seen.
[00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:11.207]  They've discounted the unit by what looks like $200 and $150 in free replacement filters for the water generator, and so that's just an amazing
[00:42:11.647 --> 00:42:12.708]  Deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:12.708 --> 00:42:15.549]  It's running through Sunday, May 2nd, 2010.
[00:42:15.549 --> 00:42:15.709]  1-800-691-6043.
[00:42:15.709 --> 00:42:16.009]  1-800-691-6043.
[00:42:16.009 --> 00:42:16.790]  Or Ecolablue.com.
[00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:17.730]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:18.170]  Ecolablue.com.
[00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:18.251]  800-691-6043.
[00:42:18.251 --> 00:42:22.073]  And next time you come back, Jerome, we'll talk about more about what's happening in the U.S.
[00:42:22.073 --> 00:42:27.335]  infrastructure and how we're being basically sterilized by design.
[00:42:27.335 --> 00:42:28.576]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[00:42:40.282 --> 00:42:40.862]  Always a pleasure.
[00:42:40.862 --> 00:42:41.382]  You're welcome.
[00:42:41.382 --> 00:42:42.102]  Thanks to you, Alex.
[00:42:42.102 --> 00:42:42.342]  You bet.
[00:42:42.342 --> 00:42:44.663]  Good to have you on, sir.
[00:42:44.663 --> 00:42:47.443]  And, you know what, folks?
[00:42:47.443 --> 00:43:00.326]  Look, I just hope you'll go look up the fact that Joseph Borkin and Charles Welsh wrote Germany's Master Plan, 1943.
[00:43:00.326 --> 00:43:02.407]  He was an expert on Germany.
[00:43:02.407 --> 00:43:06.587]  He was the Chief Economic Advisor of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.
[00:43:06.587 --> 00:43:08.488]  Then, decades later, in the mid-70s,
[00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:17.555]  He wrote a book about IG Farben with the documents that they had been able to get a hold of.
[00:43:17.555 --> 00:43:20.977]  And of course that was the crime and punishment of IG Farben.
[00:43:20.977 --> 00:43:25.381]  And they have the documents in the book.
[00:43:25.381 --> 00:43:34.047]  Our government took over Germany and took all their ideas of eugenics and took it back to the United States and it went underground.
[00:43:35.243 --> 00:43:39.146]  Everything going on in our society is about eugenics.
[00:43:39.146 --> 00:43:41.528]  Watch my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:43:41.528 --> 00:43:44.050]  Okay, I'm gonna shut up and get off the subject for now.
[00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:45.611]  Later, I'm gonna get into the Times of London.
[00:43:45.611 --> 00:43:48.653]  Doctors sterilize Uzbek women by stealth.
[00:43:48.653 --> 00:43:53.657]  And so you see this article by itself, you go, oh well that's Uzbekistan.
[00:43:53.657 --> 00:43:57.219]  Or Uzbekistan, there's so many stands.
[00:43:57.219 --> 00:43:58.901]  But no, it's everywhere.
[00:43:59.949 --> 00:44:11.793]  I mean, in Masters of Terror, I show government documents where they secretly sterilized Native American women, 40-plus percent of them, just in the 60s and 70s.
[00:44:11.793 --> 00:44:15.614]  And I got emails saying, well, how do you secretly sterilize somebody?
[00:44:15.614 --> 00:44:17.535]  Well, they describe it here.
[00:44:17.535 --> 00:44:23.437]  You go in for a checkup, and they give you a shot and knock you out, and then they clip your tubes.
[00:44:25.606 --> 00:44:29.688]  And in some cases, they go ahead and just cut your entire uterus out.
[00:44:29.688 --> 00:44:32.969]  And that's in the news today!
[00:44:32.969 --> 00:44:39.572]  But it doesn't just go on in foreign countries.
[00:44:39.572 --> 00:44:44.294]  It's not just happening to Uzbek women in Uzbekistan.
[00:44:44.294 --> 00:44:45.155]  It's Uzbekistan.
[00:44:46.442 --> 00:44:47.142]  I mean, here's another one.
[00:44:47.142 --> 00:44:51.003]  Sky News, trying to sterilize 10,000 people in just one area.
[00:44:51.003 --> 00:44:51.764]  Forcibly.
[00:44:51.764 --> 00:44:52.604]  To curb births.
[00:44:52.604 --> 00:44:53.924]  Forcibly sterilizing.
[00:44:53.924 --> 00:44:56.345]  The police come to your door and drag you away.
[00:44:56.345 --> 00:45:00.186]  Alright, alright.
[00:45:00.186 --> 00:45:03.927]  This just has to stop, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:03.927 --> 00:45:06.548]  Everything they're setting up is about carrying this out.
[00:45:06.548 --> 00:45:09.429]  And all these yuppies say, good, get rid of the Chinese.
[00:45:09.429 --> 00:45:11.510]  Get rid of the Uzbek women.
[00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:14.351]  Get rid of the Native American women.
[00:45:14.351 --> 00:45:14.691]  Gut them.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:20.043]  It's being done to you through the water supply, dummy!
[00:45:20.043 --> 00:45:24.367]  Why do you think all you yuppie women, I mean the numbers are off the charts, can't have children?
[00:45:24.367 --> 00:45:29.571]  You're 30 years old, your husband's got a good sperm count and he can't get you pregnant!
[00:45:29.571 --> 00:45:31.212]  Because fluoride has fried you!
[00:45:31.212 --> 00:45:34.675]  Alright.
[00:45:34.675 --> 00:45:41.740]  Going back to that caller's question about when will they stage a false flag, what type will it be?
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.102]  All I can go off of is the pathology
[00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:51.756]  The pathological activities of the globalists.
[00:45:51.756 --> 00:45:53.938]  Now they do the same thing over and over again.
[00:45:53.938 --> 00:45:56.881]  And they're preconditioning for the public ahead of attacks.
[00:45:56.881 --> 00:45:59.684]  And I've never seen such preconditioning ahead of the attack.
[00:45:59.684 --> 00:46:05.531]  They're preparing people for nukes to go off, for race war, mass shootings and bombings of federal buildings and IRS buildings.
[00:46:06.584 --> 00:46:06.764]  I don't
[00:46:27.767 --> 00:46:33.012]  90 plus percent chance, if there's an event, it's going to be staged and it's going to be an inside job.
[00:46:33.012 --> 00:46:45.283]  So you see people in the maintenance hatch, you know, with gray sticks of butter, one night, you better do a YouTube video immediately and then call the media and run around the streets screaming.
[00:46:45.283 --> 00:46:50.608]  Because the NSA, before an operation, is watching everyone in your federal building.
[00:46:50.608 --> 00:46:50.848]  Okay?
[00:46:50.848 --> 00:46:51.429]  They're watching.
[00:46:52.671 --> 00:46:57.136]  And they're always doing it under a drill, so the guys at NSA don't even know they're about to stage a terror attack.
[00:46:57.136 --> 00:47:00.599]  They think, oh, we're watching the federal building, part of a drill.
[00:47:00.599 --> 00:47:09.128]  You'll have a controller above them that's getting the main feeds, and they hear John Smith at the federal building calling the newspaper that night.
[00:47:09.128 --> 00:47:12.351]  John Smith and his family are going to be killed by burglars one hour later.
[00:47:12.351 --> 00:47:14.133]  They have hit teams in every city.
[00:47:14.133 --> 00:47:14.433]  They just...
[00:47:15.174 --> 00:47:35.751]  Send out the message, give them a photo of the targets, and they tell them what code to go with, make it look like a burglary homicide, or they give them another code and say, you know, whatever the spy controller decides, whatever the black ops commander decides, they may give the killers a code to go in and kill the family and say the husband's killed the family and then committed suicide.
[00:47:36.391 --> 00:47:54.964]  So if you are in a federal building and you happen to see black ops getting ready to stage an attack, you better put it on YouTube, you better go to the newspaper, you better call into talk radio, you better immediately, before you talk to anybody, point blank range, get the story out.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:47:55.664]  Yes, um...
[00:48:24.705 --> 00:48:36.239]  On YouTube, there's a video of Fox Morning News or whatever and it shows we tolerate the cultivation of opium poppies.
[00:48:37.717 --> 00:48:43.300]  It's on YouTube, and you type in, We Tolerate the Cultivation of Opium Poppies.
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:45.442]  That's a good tip.
[00:48:45.442 --> 00:48:50.125]  Guys, go to YouTube, We Cultivate the Cultivation of Poppies.
[00:48:50.125 --> 00:49:05.314]  You know, I told you, I mean, I don't know if you heard that show, Jonathan, but somebody could pull it up, because everything on the BBC's Archive, I guess it was probably eight months ago now, I literally slowed down and almost ran off the road, because they just admitted,
[00:49:06.451 --> 00:49:11.035]  Basically, we grow the opium, we let them ship it out, but that's a good thing.
[00:49:11.035 --> 00:49:17.000]  And then in Reuters, what, a month ago, had the headline that the Russians wanted to eradicate the poppies and the U.S.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.261]  said no.
[00:49:18.261 --> 00:49:20.242]  And see, that's what's so sick about it.
[00:49:20.242 --> 00:49:23.825]  I mean, they ship the heroin and cocaine in publicly.
[00:49:23.825 --> 00:49:28.449]  Pretty soon they'll have the government shipping it in and saying, we sell it but we still put you in prison.
[00:49:28.449 --> 00:49:30.251]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:49:30.251 --> 00:49:35.335]  Yes, also I have, I can tell you something about immigration because
[00:49:36.375 --> 00:49:40.158]  I went through it, and I noticed something.
[00:49:40.158 --> 00:49:50.887]  It's ran by Homeland Security, and I went there several times before, and they would be packed with people, literally.
[00:49:50.887 --> 00:49:55.011]  It was so inefficient.
[00:49:55.011 --> 00:50:02.898]  They would put their own people on hold for hours when they talked to, because they have different places where they handle things.
[00:50:05.086 --> 00:50:09.008]  The courts that they have in there, it's like kangaroo courts.
[00:50:09.008 --> 00:50:25.056]  Because when you go through the actual immigration, if you're a legal immigrant, the judge can bring his own evidence, meaning the judge can bring his own evidence, and the prosecutor would be against you, the judge and the prosecutor.
[00:50:25.056 --> 00:50:33.460]  Yeah, to be clear from what I've read and seen in the documents, they make it hard to legally immigrate, and then they just leave you alone if you're illegal.
[00:50:36.019 --> 00:50:38.100]  Is that what you found, Jonathan?
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.862]  Yeah, I have some more.
[00:50:39.862 --> 00:50:40.482]  Alright, stay there.
[00:50:40.482 --> 00:50:41.122]  I'll come back to you.
[00:50:41.122 --> 00:50:47.006]  Then Annie, John, Joe, Kevin, we're just going with your calls into the next hour and then I'm going to get into all the news.
[00:50:47.006 --> 00:50:48.347]  It's just so horrible.
[00:50:48.347 --> 00:50:49.408]  When is it going to end?
[00:50:49.408 --> 00:50:50.408]  When is it going to stop?
[00:50:50.408 --> 00:50:58.153]  I mean, they knowingly are putting poison in the water to give us cancer and to attack our reproductive system.
[00:50:58.153 --> 00:50:59.014]  This isn't a game.
[00:51:00.694 --> 00:51:09.921]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:51:09.921 --> 00:51:13.484]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?

[00:52:00.974 --> 00:52:03.316]  They helped to create a new world order.
[00:52:03.316 --> 00:52:05.557]  We are part of a new world order.
[00:52:05.557 --> 00:52:08.880]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:14.004]  Invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:14.004 --> 00:52:18.188]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.484 --> 00:52:20.947]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.947 --> 00:52:23.730]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:26.634]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.634 --> 00:52:34.243]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.563 --> 00:52:39.968]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.968 --> 00:52:42.290]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:46.514]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.514 --> 00:52:47.575]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.575 --> 00:52:48.916]  You're everyone else.

[00:54:38.517 --> 00:54:41.581]  You were talking about going through immigration.
[00:54:41.581 --> 00:54:45.927]  Well, one point I want to throw in here is it's been noted that Europeans...
[00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.370]  Yes, I've been living in the U.S.
[00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:48.690]  for 20 years.
[00:55:17.302 --> 00:55:19.964]  To work here, you have to have a worker's permit.
[00:55:19.964 --> 00:55:23.387]  And they would hike the prices up.
[00:55:23.387 --> 00:55:26.390]  Now it costs like $400 to get a worker's permit.
[00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:31.253]  They would miss permits, like you could have one, like you can send it out.
[00:55:31.253 --> 00:55:37.859]  It takes six months to get it, and then they would mess up, and it would take like four or five extra months to get another one.
[00:55:37.859 --> 00:55:45.545]  And you do this, I've been doing this for 20 years, and then just recently, I just became a permanent resident, and
[00:55:47.023 --> 00:55:50.305]  Uh, going through there, I've been living 20 years.
[00:55:50.305 --> 00:55:58.870]  They said for me, because I was an immigrant, even though I've been living in America for 20 years, they had me take three different vaccines all at once.
[00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:01.792]  Ones like for smallpox and whatnot.
[00:56:01.792 --> 00:56:04.173]  It left me bedridden for a week.
[00:56:04.173 --> 00:56:04.974]  I could not sleep.
[00:56:05.396 --> 00:56:10.237]  I would only have 30 minutes of sleep out of 20 hours of laying in bed.
[00:56:10.237 --> 00:56:11.378]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:56:11.378 --> 00:56:21.040]  And now they're trying to make everyone take it to be a cop or to be a nurse or to go to school and they're lying and saying it's the law.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:27.602]  And again, vaccines, if they were produced properly, might be good in some cases, but we know
[00:56:28.382 --> 00:56:36.266]  That we have a bunch of criminal eugenicists running the medical system so anyone who takes a vaccine is insane.
[00:56:36.266 --> 00:56:39.088]  Jonathan, I'm sorry to hear that that happened to you.
[00:56:39.088 --> 00:56:42.910]  And you better believe that they're spiking those vaccines.
[00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:50.914]  In fact, I have a stack of mainstream news articles I'm going to cover later about people dying all over the world from vaccines.
[00:56:50.914 --> 00:56:54.396]  And these aren't articles from the last few months where you've heard me covering it every day.
[00:56:54.396 --> 00:56:55.977]  This is out today.
[00:56:57.281 --> 00:57:00.482]  I mean, people are saying, what is going on?
[00:57:00.482 --> 00:57:10.006]  You take this stuff and you die or you have a convulsion or you get a neurological disorder because 90 plus percent of the vaccines are now made in China.
[00:57:10.006 --> 00:57:13.967]  I mean, let's talk to Annie in New York.
[00:57:13.967 --> 00:57:14.647]  Annie, you're on the air.
[00:57:14.647 --> 00:57:17.729]  Hi, how are you doing, Alex?
[00:57:17.729 --> 00:57:18.569]  All right.
[00:57:18.569 --> 00:57:24.891]  You know, so far, I think everything's been carefully orchestrated and choreographed according to the CFR script.
[00:57:24.891 --> 00:57:26.692]  But this time, I think they've
[00:57:27.321 --> 00:57:28.962]  They've really miscalculated.
[00:57:28.962 --> 00:57:39.569]  There is the wild card, which is these uncontrollable, radical illegals who've been weaned on the bitter vengeance of finally getting their hands on what they, you know, wrongfully believe is theirs.
[00:57:39.569 --> 00:57:41.130]  And they are ready to blow.
[00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:46.753]  And they don't respect anything or anyone in America, and that includes members of the government and law enforcement.
[00:57:46.753 --> 00:57:51.256]  So, I think they've bitten off a little more, the globalists, than they can chew.
[00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:54.632]  And I just think everything's going to blow sky high.
[00:58:13.388 --> 00:58:24.695]  And the SPP have both said that they will use immigration crises to then try to pass immigration reform that will basically just merge the North American continent.
[00:58:24.695 --> 00:58:27.316]  But I appreciate your call.
[00:58:27.316 --> 00:58:28.557]  And we do have some news on that.
[00:58:28.557 --> 00:58:34.441]  In fact, this Trichet calls for corrupt BIS to boss global government in CFR speech.
[00:58:34.441 --> 00:58:35.802]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[00:58:35.802 --> 00:58:39.464]  And he says they've planned the whole world government and they're going to go ahead and launch it.
[00:58:42.284 --> 00:58:45.706]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.706 --> 00:58:50.349]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:52.650]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:55.052]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:58:55.052 --> 00:58:58.273]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:58:58.273 --> 00:59:03.376]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:59:03.376 --> 00:59:07.579]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:59:07.879 --> 00:59:10.341]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:59:10.341 --> 00:59:13.102]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:59:13.102 --> 00:59:16.024]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:59:16.024 --> 00:59:23.629]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:59:23.962 --> 00:59:29.346]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:59:29.346 --> 00:59:32.208]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:59:32.208 --> 00:59:35.891]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:59:35.891 --> 00:59:36.972]  And I got news for you.
[00:59:36.972 --> 00:59:38.312]  You're everyone else.
[00:59:38.312 --> 00:59:39.794]  Invisible Empire.

[00:59:53.385 --> 00:59:55.786]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.786 --> 01:00:05.070]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:06.370]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.151]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:09.911]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.911 --> 01:00:11.492]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.492 --> 01:00:13.033]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.033 --> 01:00:17.234]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.234 --> 01:00:21.296]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.526 --> 01:00:47.580]  Okay, I am going to cover a mountain of important news, including Council on Foreign Relations speech that was given by Jean-Claude Trichet, the head of the European Central Bank, openly admitting they have been setting up a coordinated global government takeover for decades and that they now must go ahead and go forward with it, meaning things are not going well for these scumbags.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:56.405]  And if we identify them as the enemy of humanity and point out all the crimes they've committed, that they're a bunch of parasite control freaks, it's game over for them.
[01:00:56.405 --> 01:00:58.007]  So that is coming up.
[01:00:58.007 --> 01:01:00.828]  But I want to continue with your phone calls now.
[01:01:00.828 --> 01:01:02.229]  John in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:01:02.229 --> 01:01:03.610]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:04.351]  This is John.
[01:01:04.351 --> 01:01:05.531]  We are Change Chicago.
[01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:13.497]  The other week you quoted Lord Acton where you said, power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:01:13.497 --> 01:01:15.218]  A very famous quote.
[01:01:15.218 --> 01:01:16.839]  But did you know the rest of the quote?
[01:01:17.617 --> 01:01:21.839]  And this has always been truncated, but this is the most important part.
[01:01:21.839 --> 01:01:23.299]  This is what he goes on to say.
[01:01:23.299 --> 01:01:34.764]  And remember, where you have a concentration of power in a few hands, all too frequently, men with the mentality of gangsters get control.
[01:01:34.764 --> 01:01:37.145]  History has proven that.
[01:01:37.145 --> 01:01:38.846]  He said that over a hundred years ago.
[01:01:41.019 --> 01:01:51.345]  Yes he did, and yes I had seen the full quote, and any true statesman, any philosopher, any researcher knows that that is the 100% rule.
[01:01:51.345 --> 01:01:54.767]  You will always get a tyranny when you build a big government.
[01:01:54.767 --> 01:02:07.314]  It's normally built by tyrants to control, but even if a big government's built by altruistic people paving the road to hell with good intentions, the mechanism is always seized by tyrannists.
[01:02:10.843 --> 01:02:14.745]  Can I put out a quick shout to We Are Change and your listeners here in Chicago, Alex?
[01:02:14.745 --> 01:02:16.206]  Sure, do whatever you want!
[01:02:16.206 --> 01:02:20.929]  Okay, I want to thank them for supporting our David Ray Griffin event that took place on Tuesday night.
[01:02:20.929 --> 01:02:22.970]  We had a good turnout.
[01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:32.616]  And Griffin reports to us that 9-11 Truth is out in the open in Europe, but it's still a big secret here with the mainstream media.
[01:02:32.616 --> 01:02:34.197]  So, thanks again, Alex, for all you do.
[01:02:34.676 --> 01:02:37.638]  No, thank you to We Are Change Chicago.
[01:02:37.638 --> 01:02:39.159]  You're devastating the globalists.
[01:02:39.159 --> 01:02:42.401]  I loved you routing Al Gore.
[01:02:42.401 --> 01:02:44.502]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Texas.
[01:02:44.502 --> 01:02:45.363]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:02:45.363 --> 01:02:47.124]  Hello, Alex.
[01:02:47.124 --> 01:02:47.884]  Can you hear me, sir?
[01:02:47.884 --> 01:02:49.205]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:49.205 --> 01:02:50.666]  It's an honor.
[01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:53.167]  I wanted to get your comments.
[01:02:53.167 --> 01:03:00.852]  I heard this morning where, forgive me for not knowing the full name, but there's one of our representatives stating that
[01:03:01.522 --> 01:03:12.050]  They're going to follow along with Arizona's law come the 1st of January and try to get it voted in on the illegal immigration thing.
[01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:28.483]  And also I wanted to ask you if my second question was, do you feel that how they're trying to blackball with the swastika and Nazi emblems with the Tea Party, the Constitution Movement, Oath Keepers, things like that.
[01:03:29.293 --> 01:03:31.978]  I didn't understand the last point about...
[01:03:41.741 --> 01:03:43.301]  Refried beans.
[01:03:43.301 --> 01:03:52.424]  Oh, they had stated where, or they had showed where they were making Nazi swastikas on the windows of the Capitol in Arizona.
[01:03:52.424 --> 01:04:00.927]  And I was wanting to see if there was any, what your opinion was on how they're trying to, how they're doing it with the Tea Parties and the Constitution Movement.
[01:04:00.927 --> 01:04:01.807]  No, I understood that part.
[01:04:01.807 --> 01:04:04.228]  I didn't get the part about refried beans.
[01:04:04.228 --> 01:04:06.228]  Yes, sir.
[01:04:06.228 --> 01:04:08.269]  Oh, they were making them with refried beans.
[01:04:10.993 --> 01:04:13.494]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[01:04:13.494 --> 01:04:25.518]  Look, it's on record in the last month, even AP's reported, Democratic operatives have been running around putting swastikas everywhere and saying the Tea Parties are doing it in a premeditated operation.
[01:04:25.518 --> 01:04:30.920]  I wasn't familiar with the situation in Arizona that that had been going on, but that's par for the course.
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:34.681]  And then you had brought up the demonization of the Tea Party.
[01:04:34.681 --> 01:04:36.622]  I mean, that's now out in the open.
[01:04:37.642 --> 01:04:38.783]  Dog chewed your remote control?
[01:04:38.783 --> 01:04:40.104]  Lost your remote?

[01:07:50.753 --> 01:07:52.314]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:28.376 --> 01:08:29.737]  We are back live.
[01:08:29.737 --> 01:08:37.700]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, the 29th day of April 2010.
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:41.781]  I'm going back to your phone calls now.
[01:08:41.781 --> 01:08:45.783]  Let's go ahead and speak to Kevin in California.
[01:08:45.783 --> 01:08:46.343]  You're on the air.
[01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:49.184]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:08:49.184 --> 01:08:56.907]  The recent discussion about the immigration laws in Arizona has been like a double-edged sword for me.
[01:08:56.907 --> 01:09:00.208]  At the same time, I'm happy that someone is addressing it.
[01:09:00.208 --> 01:09:12.773]  I realized how much anger I have as someone who was born and raised in Los Angeles, and the reality of what I've seen since my
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:24.884]  Well that's the issue is that Latin America is falling apart and is hellish.
[01:09:24.884 --> 01:09:34.370]  The people are good people but they're under tyranny and they all have their arguments for wanting to come here and their reasons.
[01:09:35.231 --> 01:09:44.614]  The issue is the globalists on record are using them to bankrupt the country and drive down wages, and we've seen what it's doing to the United States.
[01:09:44.614 --> 01:09:48.715]  And so, we must tie a tourniquet on our leg.
[01:09:48.715 --> 01:09:50.575]  We must do it now.
[01:09:50.575 --> 01:09:57.277]  There are, excuse me, I said 6.5 billion, it's now 6.85 billion people worldwide.
[01:09:57.277 --> 01:10:02.839]  Only 300 million of that 6.8 plus billion live here, and billions of people want to come here.
[01:10:04.039 --> 01:10:14.818]  Maybe we could have billions of people come here if we didn't have welfare, but we cannot pay for the welfare of these illegal aliens, and many of them are on massive welfare.
[01:10:14.818 --> 01:10:15.639]  That is on record.
[01:10:15.639 --> 01:10:15.960]  Go ahead.
[01:10:17.145 --> 01:10:21.948]  This place has been hit like a bomb.
[01:10:21.948 --> 01:10:26.131]  They say a few hundred thousand in Arizona or around that area.
[01:10:26.131 --> 01:10:28.613]  We're talking about millions here.
[01:10:28.613 --> 01:10:31.034]  I can literally give you examples.
[01:10:31.034 --> 01:10:34.917]  My apartment manager where I rent is not here legally.
[01:10:35.357 --> 01:10:40.041]  I could walk down the street and see 12 people at the gas station hanging out, right down the street.
[01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:45.405]  I could go to the Home Depot, right down the street from that, and there's 20 hanging out.
[01:10:45.405 --> 01:10:47.406]  I'm an employer, I have my own business.
[01:10:47.406 --> 01:10:51.209]  Say I want to put an ad in the paper for someone to do a certain skill for me?
[01:10:51.209 --> 01:10:56.873]  The illegal immigrants, they jump on the ad, they call you immediately, they fight for the spot.
[01:10:56.873 --> 01:11:01.196]  You can't really hire anyone without them trying to finagle the paperwork.
[01:11:01.196 --> 01:11:03.058]  It's like it's gotten so out of hand.
[01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:13.361]  I was in downtown Los Angeles yesterday, and for literally a three-mile radius in each direction, it's like Mexico.
[01:11:13.361 --> 01:11:17.405]  It doesn't even resemble the United States anymore.
[01:11:17.405 --> 01:11:23.330]  Everyone here is on different languages, and it's not just Hispanic.
[01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:27.955]  It's Armenian, Filipino, Korean, it's all kinds.
[01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:29.496]  No one is speaking the same language.
[01:11:29.935 --> 01:11:31.357]  No one is on the same page.
[01:11:31.357 --> 01:11:32.899]  There's no communication here.
[01:11:32.899 --> 01:11:34.441]  It's like a land of limbo.
[01:11:35.786 --> 01:11:40.949]  And the government's jacking up taxes on the middle class that is disappearing.
[01:11:40.949 --> 01:11:51.176]  They've got the votes, and for whatever reason, immigrants, unless they're from the Eastern Bloc, they tend to have lived under hardcore tyranny, so they know freedom.
[01:11:51.176 --> 01:12:03.463]  But other than those groups, the immigrants tend to vote, we're talking nine times out of ten if you look at the numbers, for gun control, for big government, for socialism.
[01:12:03.463 --> 01:12:04.444]  And so it's game over.
[01:12:04.824 --> 01:12:22.380]  They bring in masses of people, they stick a government mammary gland in their face, and just say, suck us dry, and... I mean, the country may not be able to be saved regardless, but we know if we don't shut it down, it's over.
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.601]  Yes.
[01:12:23.601 --> 01:12:29.086]  Yes, I would just like to implore people, please, please, if anyone knows
[01:12:30.248 --> 01:12:35.673]  Anyone in government, anyone that can do anything about this, remind them about the problem in Los Angeles.
[01:12:35.673 --> 01:12:39.236]  This place is falling over the years and it's like this.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.161]  One of the saddest things.
[01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:07.056]  They put them on welfare and they forge them as a political weapon.
[01:13:07.056 --> 01:13:09.778]  And that's totally different from Hispanic Americans.
[01:13:09.778 --> 01:13:19.549]  Hispanic Americans were the first people to warn me about this many, many years ago when I was completely blind to the fact that Latin America is pouring into the country.
[01:13:19.549 --> 01:13:20.289]  Now, if we took
[01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:27.692]  More manageable numbers of people, didn't put them on welfare, educated them about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:13:27.692 --> 01:13:30.593]  I'm all for legal immigration from Latin America.
[01:13:30.593 --> 01:13:32.293]  I mean, we need immigrants to this country.
[01:13:32.293 --> 01:13:33.814]  This country was built by immigrants.
[01:13:33.814 --> 01:13:42.637]  But you just can't have 30 million illegal aliens and a couple million more a year pouring in, voting illegally, they've been caught all over, to take my guns.
[01:13:42.637 --> 01:13:43.077]  I mean, listen.
[01:13:44.157 --> 01:13:45.298]  It's very simple.
[01:13:45.298 --> 01:13:47.239]  This is why Rome fell.
[01:13:47.239 --> 01:13:49.180]  This is why many other civilizations fell.
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.221]  I appreciate your call, Kevin.
[01:13:51.221 --> 01:13:52.602]  Let's talk to Matt in Oklahoma.
[01:13:52.602 --> 01:13:53.143]  You're on the air.
[01:13:53.143 --> 01:13:55.404]  Hey, Alex.
[01:13:55.404 --> 01:13:57.165]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[01:13:57.165 --> 01:14:00.647]  I want to thank you for all that you do out there, all the hard work that you do, getting the truth out there.
[01:14:00.647 --> 01:14:02.008]  Thank you, sir.
[01:14:02.008 --> 01:14:12.374]  I just wanted to see if you could elaborate on some of the more pressing problems of Oklahoma currently and what you would say to your Oklahoma listeners who need the greatest levels of constitutional and liberty-driven activism.
[01:14:13.067 --> 01:14:18.470]  Also, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the climate bill, but if you could elaborate on the Oklahoma stuff first.
[01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:28.176]  Well, they've passed a law that bans basically militias, and they tied it in with the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:14:28.176 --> 01:14:31.218]  It bans the Ku Klux Klan and the militias.
[01:14:31.218 --> 01:14:33.599]  So that's like saying we're banning
[01:14:36.807 --> 01:14:41.870]  Murder, and we're banning freedom.
[01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:48.934]  They always pass legislation in Europe and other places to restrict free speech, and they start out with the Nazis.
[01:14:48.934 --> 01:14:51.556]  Well, Nazis are bad, so people think it sounds reasonable.
[01:14:51.556 --> 01:14:53.477]  No, you take their free speech.
[01:14:53.477 --> 01:14:56.879]  You're going to lose your free speech, and it's going to be selectively enforced.
[01:14:56.879 --> 01:15:00.641]  And so you've got the best of times, the worst of times in Oklahoma.
[01:15:00.641 --> 01:15:02.302]  It's one of the most constitutional states.
[01:15:02.302 --> 01:15:03.543]  It's got some of the best people.
[01:15:04.443 --> 01:15:06.304]  Pro Second Amendment.
[01:15:06.304 --> 01:15:12.225]  But you've also got a lot of really bad people in your legislature.
[01:15:12.225 --> 01:15:28.890]  And I mean, I've seen articles where different cities, what, Tulsa, last year, I don't know if it passed, was trying to make you get a license to have a garden in your backyard or front yard because you might grow marijuana.
[01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:30.590]  See, you're guilty until proven innocent.
[01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:32.571]  So you've got to pay for an inspection
[01:15:33.251 --> 01:15:34.232]  Because you're a criminal.
[01:15:34.232 --> 01:15:37.056]  You've got to be searched violating the Fourth Amendment.
[01:15:37.056 --> 01:15:40.039]  But Oklahoma passed this bill outlawing militia recruitment.
[01:15:40.039 --> 01:15:41.020]  Kurt Nemo's got an article.
[01:15:41.969 --> 01:15:44.050]  About that, it's also in the Daily Oklahoman.
[01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:46.672]  He has links to TV news reports in the article.
[01:16:12.369 --> 01:16:15.991]  Legislation approved Thursday by the House of Representatives becomes law.
[01:16:15.991 --> 01:16:23.193]  This is making unauthorized militias illegal, as Representative Mike Shelton, the amendment's author, News OK reported today.
[01:16:23.193 --> 01:16:28.295]  Shelton wants to send people to prison who do not ask the state for permission to form a militia.
[01:16:28.295 --> 01:16:31.336]  If the bill becomes law, it will likely be challenged as unconstitutional.
[01:16:31.336 --> 01:16:40.860]  However, the bill and its passage in the Oklahoma House reveals that its support on the part of lawmakers deny citizens their right under the First Amendment, specifically the right to peaceably assemble.
[01:16:41.914 --> 01:16:47.966]  Shelton exploited the government's attack on the federal building 15 years ago in order to rationalize the law.
[01:16:47.966 --> 01:16:50.992]  In Oklahoma, we have seen the damage done by militia fanatics.
[01:16:52.116 --> 01:16:53.317]  Yeah, that was a government op.
[01:16:53.317 --> 01:16:56.680]  He said, Ku Klux Klan has a long history of violence and domestic terrorism.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.962]  So see, he mixes Ku Klux Klan in with the militia.
[01:16:59.962 --> 01:17:03.986]  It sounds like Mr. Shelton has read too much Southern Poverty Law Center literature.
[01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:17.697]  The Ku Klux Klan is not only almost entirely dormant, with the exception of a few FBI-run stragglers, we have links to mainstream articles about that, kept around just in case the race card needs to be played, but the throwback organization has nothing to do with state militia movements.
[01:17:18.477 --> 01:17:21.799]  Even the ADL admits that McVeigh was not associated with any militia group.
[01:17:21.799 --> 01:17:24.180]  They have a link to the ADL admitting that.
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:27.002]  So, I mean, this is a big deal.
[01:17:27.002 --> 01:17:31.144]  This is saying we're going to ban certain groups from assembly.
[01:17:31.144 --> 01:17:34.926]  We're going to ban certain groups' right to go out and speak.
[01:17:34.926 --> 01:17:40.409]  And this is actually what Nazi Germany did, or what Soviet Russia did.
[01:17:40.409 --> 01:17:43.451]  And so there'll be two approved parties, the Republican and Democratic Party.
[01:17:44.171 --> 01:17:49.034]  Uh, and they're gonna, the FCC's calling for government-run media, they're calling for restrictions on free speech.
[01:17:49.034 --> 01:17:52.116]  Uh, and, uh, what is going on in Oklahoma?
[01:17:52.116 --> 01:17:56.619]  I mean, they passed a law last year that you can't have burglar bars anywhere on your house.
[01:17:56.619 --> 01:17:59.061]  That's called fortification because the government's criminal.
[01:17:59.881 --> 01:18:03.464]  And it wants to work with its little buddy criminals to break in your house easier.
[01:18:03.464 --> 01:18:05.386]  And they don't want you to be able to have a garden?
[01:18:05.386 --> 01:18:08.868]  And they're saying you can't form a militia?
[01:18:08.868 --> 01:18:13.732]  You can't go get together with 10 of your buddies and say if society collapses, we're going to stick up for each other?
[01:18:13.732 --> 01:18:25.121]  I mean, again, we have an out-of-control criminal government, and I don't know what to say else about Oklahoma, but folks have got a problem up there, and you need to clean out the corrupt politicians up there.
[01:18:25.121 --> 01:18:25.402]  Go ahead.
[01:18:26.083 --> 01:18:32.720]  It's baffling to me, Alex, that they could even consider a law like that that blatantly violates the First and Second Amendment, right?
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.562]  In one bill.
[01:18:33.562 --> 01:18:34.786]  I mean, I've never seen anything like it.
[01:18:35.245 --> 01:18:37.387]  It's ridiculous.
[01:18:37.387 --> 01:18:40.449]  What I wanted to ask you about next is the climate change bill.
[01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:49.556]  All over the mainstream media for the last few days they've been talking about the climate change bill authored by Senators Kerry, formerly Graham, and now Lieberman.
[01:18:49.556 --> 01:18:52.478]  And they're talking about this like it's their bill.
[01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:56.481]  And I called Senator Reid's office because he's the one who said this was ready to go the other day.
[01:18:57.345 --> 01:19:01.187]  And, uh, what they referred me to is a House bill that's already passed.
[01:19:01.187 --> 01:19:04.548]  Yeah, and again, legislation cannot originate in the Senate.
[01:19:04.548 --> 01:19:05.769]  This is a new bill.
[01:19:05.769 --> 01:19:10.190]  They admit it's a new bill and it's illegal, but they passed the health care bill illegally.
[01:19:10.190 --> 01:19:11.271]  See, that's what I'm saying.
[01:19:11.271 --> 01:19:12.671]  They are tyrants.
[01:19:12.671 --> 01:19:17.093]  They are decimating our laws in front of our face.
[01:19:17.093 --> 01:19:18.974]  Yep.
[01:19:18.974 --> 01:19:25.977]  But, yeah, it's pretty bad here in Oklahoma, too, but, you know, just calling around the Senators and, you know,
[01:19:26.601 --> 01:19:27.582]  Yeah, he's a good guy.
[01:19:44.504 --> 01:19:46.106]  We're out of time, Matt.
[01:19:46.106 --> 01:19:49.230]  We're going to talk to Adam, Chris, Chris, Larry, and others.
[01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:51.212]  Big news blitz coming up.
[01:19:51.212 --> 01:19:54.015]  And I'll cover the CFR global government announcement.
[01:19:54.015 --> 01:19:58.580]  And I'll also cover the state of the power grab bill.
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:19:59.942]  It's meant to shut everything off.
[01:20:00.851 --> 01:20:04.372]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, talking today about change.
[01:20:04.372 --> 01:20:09.774]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[01:20:09.774 --> 01:20:15.136]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion,
[01:20:16.516 --> 01:20:17.377]  The value of the U.S.
[01:20:17.377 --> 01:20:19.499]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[01:20:19.499 --> 01:20:24.204]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals, but you need to act today.

[01:20:33.352 --> 01:20:37.977]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of our children and grandchildren,
[01:20:38.197 --> 01:20:41.819]  There's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation with Precious Metals.
[01:20:41.819 --> 01:20:52.624]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical possession or convert your IRA into Precious Metals before it's too late.

[01:21:06.481 --> 01:21:09.246]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:21:09.246 --> 01:21:13.712]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[01:23:14.513 --> 01:23:15.394]  and Canada.
[01:23:15.394 --> 01:23:21.919]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:23:22.481 --> 01:23:25.862]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:23:25.862 --> 01:23:28.323]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[01:23:28.323 --> 01:23:34.904]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[01:23:34.904 --> 01:23:38.425]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[01:23:38.425 --> 01:23:42.286]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:48.650]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[01:23:48.650 --> 01:23:50.852]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[01:23:50.852 --> 01:23:54.515]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[01:23:54.515 --> 01:23:55.516]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[01:24:05.984 --> 01:24:15.252]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.TV, Samuel Casting in living video color for PrisonPlanet.TV members in the next segment for the Balance of the Transmission.
[01:24:15.252 --> 01:24:24.441]  Heads up, we've got the GATA whistleblower inside JP Morgan, artificially suppressing the metals market, joining us next Tuesday.
[01:24:24.441 --> 01:24:32.228]  Tomorrow, James Traficant, former congressman, joins us to talk about a host of issues, including Oklahoma City.
[01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:35.429]  And we've got Greg Pallas coming up on Monday.
[01:24:35.429 --> 01:24:47.552]  Been a long time since we had the BBC, ABC News reporter always has important breaking news for us and has some breaking news coming up on Monday that's important for everybody to be made aware of.
[01:24:47.552 --> 01:24:49.073]  Let's continue with phone calls.
[01:24:49.073 --> 01:24:50.513]  Adam in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:24:50.513 --> 01:24:51.613]  Go ahead, Adam.
[01:24:51.613 --> 01:24:52.894]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[01:24:52.894 --> 01:24:54.154]  It's an honor to talk with you.
[01:24:54.154 --> 01:24:55.815]  How are you doing today?
[01:24:55.815 --> 01:24:56.795]  The honor is all mine.
[01:24:56.795 --> 01:24:57.095]  Go ahead.
[01:24:58.476 --> 01:25:04.501]  I was wondering what your opinion is on these free speech zones in Toronto at the upcoming G20.
[01:25:04.501 --> 01:25:14.368]  Well, I mean, they had free speech zones started under Clinton in 98, and the Republicans decried it, and then Bush expanded them, and Obama is using them.
[01:25:14.368 --> 01:25:23.155]  He used free speech zones to try to have riot police attack a peaceful tea party yesterday, but the police refused to follow orders.
[01:25:24.996 --> 01:25:39.463]  Well, the first two times they followed the order, and the video is up on Infowars.com, Kurt Nimmo wrote an article about it, and they kept pushing them further and further back, and the third time, they just marched off, they just didn't follow the order.
[01:25:39.463 --> 01:25:43.505]  So, to violate the First Amendment, that's some good news.
[01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:52.049]  But yes, I am familiar with what's coming up with the G20, and whenever the globalists come into your town, or your country, they let everybody know they're the real government.
[01:25:52.649 --> 01:25:55.770]  And, uh, at least you're going to have free speech zones there.
[01:25:55.770 --> 01:26:02.452]  Those are bad enough, you know, where you're two miles away and nobody can see you or hear you and they ignore you, uh, so the people can't be heard.
[01:26:02.452 --> 01:26:07.254]  There were no free speech zones, uh, at the, uh, last G20.
[01:26:07.254 --> 01:26:11.115]  They claimed there would be some, but they just basically said, no assembly.
[01:26:11.115 --> 01:26:17.717]  And then they couldn't find anybody resisting them, so they marched down to the university, miles away, to a park two nights in a row.
[01:26:18.217 --> 01:26:21.039]  And even chase people into their dorm rooms.
[01:26:21.039 --> 01:26:25.683]  So college students weren't even allowed to go out and sit underneath the stars.
[01:26:25.683 --> 01:26:28.665]  And we cover that in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:26:28.665 --> 01:26:42.917]  And so this is the same system globally where they militarize the police, they have them shoot at people with rubber bullets, they call out the army on the streets, they snatch and grab citizens off the streets to set the precedent to scare people as a chilling effect from being politically involved.
[01:26:44.555 --> 01:26:50.058]  Why do they keep meeting so frequently, and what do you advise your Canadian listeners to do about this?
[01:26:50.058 --> 01:26:56.781]  Okay, I'm going to answer that question when we come back in the next segment, because I'm doing a whole piece on this, and this is it.
[01:26:56.781 --> 01:27:05.125]  They're negotiating the final formation of an open world government, and we're going to let you hear that directly from Top Globalist, the head of the European Central
[01:27:06.025 --> 01:27:08.608]  How we doing, Alex?
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:29.202]  Just a quick question for you, actually.
[01:27:29.202 --> 01:27:32.525]  I was wondering if you saw either of these articles.
[01:27:32.525 --> 01:27:46.237]  There was one from Mother Jones at the beginning of this month, right before the WikiLeaks incident, called Oath Keepers in the Age of Treason, trying to equate the Oath Keepers of basically committing treason.
[01:27:46.237 --> 01:27:47.117]  No, I didn't see it.
[01:27:47.117 --> 01:27:49.940]  The guys print that for me, Oath Keepers in the Age of Treason.
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:54.344]  By the way, did we find that Fox News piece that they talked about, where they're admitting the government's growing the opium?
[01:27:55.427 --> 01:27:57.831]  I'm going to play that later then or a clip of it.
[01:27:57.831 --> 01:28:04.001]  No, but I have seen the media claim that they're treasonous, saying they'll follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution and will follow their oath.
[01:28:05.549 --> 01:28:08.130]  I mean, that's kind of like in Road to Tyranny.
[01:28:08.130 --> 01:28:10.131]  I have squad car video at a checkpoint.
[01:28:10.131 --> 01:28:20.715]  They arrest a woman for no reason because they find a pocket constitution and the cops have a discussion about whether it's legal or not to have a pocket constitution and they're scared and breathing heavily.
[01:28:20.715 --> 01:28:22.416]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[01:28:22.416 --> 01:28:23.997]  You've got to go watch the film.
[01:28:23.997 --> 01:28:24.917]  It's on YouTube, folks.
[01:28:28.166 --> 01:28:30.888]  They swore an oath to that Constitution.
[01:28:30.888 --> 01:28:34.331]  They swore an oath to that Bill of Rights, that Declaration of Independence.
[01:28:34.331 --> 01:28:36.853]  No, police, it's not illegal.
[01:28:36.853 --> 01:28:40.076]  But what's your take on that article?
[01:28:40.076 --> 01:28:48.023]  Well, basically, it's the normal Mother Jones hit piece, and they're trying to say that they're just there to resist the Obama administration.
[01:28:48.023 --> 01:28:53.728]  They completely leave out that the fact that guns were seized in New Orleans under Bush.
[01:28:55.394 --> 01:29:04.898]  Or that Oath Keepers is founded by a top Ron Paul staffer, who was critical of Bush, and that they've made it clear that they just want to follow their oath.
[01:29:04.898 --> 01:29:11.880]  It's wholesome, it's good, it's clean, it's American, and that's why they hate it.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:21.023]  And then the other article I wanted to bring to your attention, it's kind of a joke article, but it's by Andy Borowitz, and it's equating Goldman Sachs to the Somali pirates.
[01:29:21.970 --> 01:29:26.473]  The headline on that one is Somali pirates save their subsidiary of Goldman Sachs.
[01:29:26.473 --> 01:29:28.355]  And that was it.
[01:29:28.355 --> 01:29:28.695]  Thank you.
[01:29:28.695 --> 01:29:30.056]  I did find the Mother Jones article.
[01:29:30.056 --> 01:29:30.896]  The guys brought it in.
[01:29:30.896 --> 01:29:37.801]  Oath keepers in the age of treason meet the fast-growing Patriot group that's recruiting soldiers to resist the Obama administration.
[01:29:37.801 --> 01:29:39.883]  That is not what they're doing.
[01:29:39.883 --> 01:29:42.745]  And Mother Jones is lying and they know it.
[01:29:42.745 --> 01:29:45.406]  They work for the big banks and they make me sick.
[01:29:45.406 --> 01:29:48.549]  I'm so sick of these neolibs and their tyranny.
[01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:48.969]  We'll be back.
[01:29:51.573 --> 01:29:55.474]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.474 --> 01:30:01.155]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.155 --> 01:30:04.176]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.176 --> 01:30:09.498]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.498 --> 01:30:11.538]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.538 --> 01:30:16.539]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.539 --> 01:30:17.740]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:18.460]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.721]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.721 --> 01:30:21.802]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.802 --> 01:30:24.003]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.003 --> 01:30:25.344]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.344 --> 01:30:26.884]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.884 --> 01:30:32.147]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.147 --> 01:30:35.269]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.729 --> 01:30:39.553]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.553 --> 01:30:40.774]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.774 --> 01:30:41.675]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.675 --> 01:30:42.776]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.776 --> 01:30:43.716]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.716 --> 01:30:44.817]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.817 --> 01:30:47.860]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:49.622]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.622 --> 01:30:50.543]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:01.598 --> 01:31:10.085]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:31:10.085 --> 01:31:20.973]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:31:20.973 --> 01:31:26.418]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:31:26.978 --> 01:31:31.861]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:40.927]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:31:40.927 --> 01:31:51.034]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:31:51.034 --> 01:31:54.737]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:31:54.737 --> 01:31:55.757]  SilverLungs.com.
[01:32:00.339 --> 01:32:01.640]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:07.222]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:07.222 --> 01:32:12.243]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:12.243 --> 01:32:17.285]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:32:17.805 --> 01:32:23.030]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:30.157]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.157 --> 01:32:31.278]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:31.278 --> 01:32:37.644]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:37.944 --> 01:32:41.145]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:41.145 --> 01:32:43.366]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:43.366 --> 01:32:44.307]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.307 --> 01:32:44.707]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.707 --> 01:32:47.948]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:47.948 --> 01:32:49.669]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:09.093 --> 01:33:10.194]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:10.194 --> 01:33:11.736]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:11.736 --> 01:33:16.461]  We're now an hour and 33 minutes into this Thursday broadcast.
[01:33:16.461 --> 01:33:23.688]  We're simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv live for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:33:23.688 --> 01:33:29.955]  Okay, the last caller said, why do we see the G20 now meeting every few months?
[01:33:31.314 --> 01:33:39.018]  In fact, pull up on screen for people, just type into the search engine the term, banking heads meet in secret in Australia.
[01:33:39.018 --> 01:33:41.399]  Remember that two months ago?
[01:33:41.399 --> 01:33:48.463]  27 banking heads of the G20 and 7 private megabanks all met in secret.
[01:33:49.838 --> 01:34:05.847]  Well, I mean, going back to 1954, Bilderberg has released part of the minutes of their first meeting, and they said, through stealth, through economic trade deals, we're going to create the Asian Union, the North American Union, and the European Union, and we are then going to merge those three.
[01:34:05.847 --> 01:34:16.313]  They've already set up the North American Union by stealth, the EU and the Asian Union are all operating, and we have this in my film, Endgame, Bush actually giving a speech with Merkel and Barroso of the EU,
[01:34:17.273 --> 01:34:25.175]  Saying, we are now merging the North American Union with the European Union, through this Atlantic Agreement.
[01:34:25.175 --> 01:34:40.179]  So, they publicly admit they're doing this, but then separately have armies of pundits out there, saying if you talk about global government run by banks, you're crazy, it doesn't exist, and you're probably a terrorist.
[01:34:40.179 --> 01:34:46.021]  And when I had Nightline here earlier in the week, I was trying to show him clips of Herman Van Rompuy, I was trying to show him clips
[01:34:47.463 --> 01:34:55.048]  Of Gordon Brown, of Ban Ki-moon, saying global government's here, world governance is here, and it's going to be run by private banks.
[01:34:55.048 --> 01:34:59.391]  And they're going to raise VAT taxes on us, they're going to have carbon taxes on us.
[01:34:59.391 --> 01:35:05.555]  It's like when I had Rothschild, the heir to the Rothschild fortune on, one of the head environmentalists, out there land grabbing.
[01:35:05.555 --> 01:35:07.597]  And he said, there is no such thing as a carbon tax.
[01:35:08.397 --> 01:35:13.924]  Even though at the time he'd been on other TV shows promoting a carbon tax and calling for global government.
[01:35:13.924 --> 01:35:17.608]  For my audience, the disdain was it doesn't exist.
[01:35:17.608 --> 01:35:23.715]  So we have an argument about whether it exists or not instead of about who's setting up the world government.
[01:35:23.715 --> 01:35:24.716]  Is it tyrannical?
[01:35:24.716 --> 01:35:25.697]  Do we want it?
[01:35:25.697 --> 01:35:26.638]  Do we have a say in it?
[01:35:27.566 --> 01:35:41.035]  And so the G20 is meeting now every month or so with the army called out in England, the army called out in the U.S., the army being called out in Canada, the army being called out in Europe on the continent.
[01:35:41.035 --> 01:35:43.076]  No protesting is allowed.
[01:35:43.076 --> 01:35:44.177]  People are arrested.
[01:35:44.177 --> 01:35:51.502]  There's surveillance everywhere because these are the true controllers, the finance ministers of the 20 industrialized nations.
[01:35:52.062 --> 01:35:57.385]  Who all are former Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of England executives.
[01:35:57.385 --> 01:35:59.026]  They're private bank holders.
[01:35:59.026 --> 01:36:09.171]  They themselves, in the banking bailouts, which are really just banking robberies, openly get hundreds of millions, in some cases billions of dollars apiece, of the bailout money.
[01:36:10.437 --> 01:36:14.220]  And then they won't even tell Congress or the Parliament where all the money went.
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:17.163]  So, I mean, think about how outrageous this is.
[01:36:17.163 --> 01:36:22.707]  So, I hate to even get into this subject without playing clip after clip after clip.
[01:36:22.707 --> 01:36:29.232]  But you can just search engine Herman Van Rompuy, head of the EU, global governance, and you'll get clip after clip after clip and the documents.
[01:36:29.232 --> 01:36:33.275]  Video, audio, government documents, Copenhagen Treaty, you name it.
[01:36:34.255 --> 01:36:38.576]  I mean, there are hundreds of these in the last year where they're just coming out in the open.
[01:36:38.576 --> 01:36:45.778]  And so they're having more and more meetings because they're at the end.
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:37:16.577]  They're now hammering out the VAT taxes, the financial VAT taxes, the Tobin taxes, the global regulatory system that is a global governance model where the countries get lobbied and financed and paid off to sign their sovereignty away to an open world government run and governed by private banks.
[01:37:18.513 --> 01:37:25.319]  And they stalled the public with Rush Limbaugh and ABC News and the rest of them for all these years saying, none of this exists.
[01:37:25.319 --> 01:37:32.446]  And now they're saying, okay, it exists, but it's not kosher to talk about it or to oppose it.
[01:37:32.446 --> 01:37:40.473]  And so just the latest video, I mean, there are new videos constantly from Davos and the list just goes on and on.
[01:37:40.473 --> 01:37:44.157]  Did you guys find the secret banking article out of Australia?
[01:37:47.585 --> 01:37:50.607]  Well, let's put it back up for people again, because I want to read that headline.
[01:37:50.607 --> 01:37:55.671]  Again, these are secret bankers who meet in secret to really set the policy.
[01:37:55.671 --> 01:37:57.212]  They'll meet in secret at Bilderberg.
[01:37:57.212 --> 01:38:00.295]  They'll meet in secret at Trilateral Commission meetings.
[01:38:00.295 --> 01:38:02.556]  We've stolen their internal documents before.
[01:38:02.556 --> 01:38:03.977]  Jim Tucker and others have.
[01:38:03.977 --> 01:38:04.378]  We know.
[01:38:04.858 --> 01:38:09.302]  That's how years before they go public with something, we already know what they're planning.
[01:38:09.302 --> 01:38:11.864]  There it is, secret summit of top bankers.
[01:38:11.864 --> 01:38:15.447]  So, they have secret summits and actually agree on what they're going to do.
[01:38:15.447 --> 01:38:20.010]  Then they have public PR stunts, where they come out and say, we've got to have...
[01:38:21.107 --> 01:38:21.828]  We're good to go.
[01:38:37.984 --> 01:38:49.107]  So it's like having mobsters sit over a trial of themselves and then they lie to the public and say this is going to fix the problem when it only gives them more control.
[01:38:49.107 --> 01:38:55.908]  So they create every crisis, that's in the Goldman Sachs emails, they create the crisis and then they offer the solution.
[01:38:55.908 --> 01:39:01.630]  The Goldman Sachs CEO is on television saying we need to pass this financial regulatory bill.
[01:39:02.455 --> 01:39:03.155]  And what does it do?
[01:39:03.155 --> 01:39:07.638]  It erects global taxes to be paid to the bankers as a, quote, bailout.
[01:39:07.638 --> 01:39:09.259]  Oh, that will certainly show them.
[01:39:09.259 --> 01:39:11.960]  That will certainly get them, won't it?
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:14.862]  So, I'm going to play this video here in a moment, but here's just the latest.
[01:39:14.862 --> 01:39:21.085]  Trichet calls for corrupt BIS boss.
[01:39:21.085 --> 01:39:26.448]  Trichet calls for corrupt Bank of International Settlements to boss global government in CFR speech.
[01:39:27.586 --> 01:39:37.355]  ECB president tells insiders that secretive group of international bankers responsible to no nation-state will become primary engine of world government.
[01:39:37.355 --> 01:39:53.769]  In a speech before the Elitist Council on Foreign Relations organization in New York earlier this week, President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, called for the imposition of global governance to be bossed by the G20 and the corrupt Bank of International Settlements in the name of safeguarding the global economy.
[01:39:54.309 --> 01:40:11.245]  In an address entitled, Global Governance Today, Frechette proclaims how the elite need to impose a set of rules, institutions, that's laws, and informal groupings, that means they can secretly do whatever they want, and cooperating mechanisms that we call global governance.
[01:40:11.245 --> 01:40:11.825]  This is a quote.
[01:40:12.866 --> 01:40:22.870]  During the course of the speech, Trichet used the term global governments well over a dozen times, outlining how global governance is of the essence to avoid another financial crisis.
[01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:24.571]  There's the financial terrorism.
[01:40:24.571 --> 01:40:28.433]  If you don't give us total power, we will destroy everything.
[01:40:28.433 --> 01:40:33.775]  And so, oh, they need $150 billion now for Greece that Goldman Sachs on record engineered.
[01:40:33.775 --> 01:40:39.177]  And now a Goldman Sachs former executive is running the financial operation there with the government.
[01:40:39.177 --> 01:40:40.878]  Oh, now Portugal's going down.
[01:40:41.178 --> 01:40:42.658]  We need hundreds of billions.
[01:40:42.658 --> 01:40:45.079]  Oh, now all these other... Oh!
[01:40:45.079 --> 01:40:48.280]  Taxpayers have got to give us money!
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:41:00.543]  When it's derivatives sold by the big brokerage firms to the governments in collusion to make money on the way up, bankrupt the countries on the way down, and get total banking dictatorship out of it.
[01:41:00.543 --> 01:41:03.764]  Again, they're all a bunch of Bernie Madoff types who need to be arrested!
[01:41:05.225 --> 01:41:18.916]  It's on record that the head of Goldman Sachs ordered his people to sell derivatives that they knew were, quote, S-H-T-Y.
[01:41:18.916 --> 01:41:23.380]  Okay, it's on record, but no, we'll give them more power, that will show them.
[01:41:26.129 --> 01:41:30.192]  Section 1 of Trichet's speech is entitled, Why We Need Global Governance.
[01:41:30.192 --> 01:41:39.520]  And from then on, he constantly invokes the economic downturn as a justification for empowering secretive, undemocratic, and corrupt global institutions with the power to rule the world.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.321]  That's the other point.
[01:41:41.321 --> 01:41:44.224]  If I get another email from a yuppie saying, basically,
[01:41:44.824 --> 01:41:51.907]  Well, it's time, like Star Trek, for us to have a global government and no more war and peace, and this is what humanity wants.
[01:41:51.907 --> 01:41:55.088]  Number one, in every poll, humanity doesn't want to lose sovereignty of their countries.
[01:41:55.088 --> 01:42:00.510]  Number two, this is a global government run by private corporations that in their own documents they admit are authoritarian.
[01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:09.938]  Remember last year, and now for world government, Financial Times of London headline, by their foreign editor, where he said, yeah, we've been secretive, yes, it's authoritarian, but it's for your own good.
[01:42:09.938 --> 01:42:21.248]  Two weeks ago, the head of the Gaia movement, the top environmentalist in England, said, we need to have an undemocratic world government to enforce one-child policies and total control, because the public's too stupid to do it.
[01:42:21.248 --> 01:42:25.872]  This is an authoritarian global corporate dictatorship that is being set up.
[01:42:27.970 --> 01:42:40.310]  And he also talks about in the speech, you can read the transcript and watch the whole video, we have it linked up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in this article, where he says, we've been building this for a long time, we've got to go ahead with it now.
[01:42:41.710 --> 01:42:42.511]  Okay?
[01:42:42.511 --> 01:42:59.751]  So, the world government is here, these guys give constant speeches, they run our government illegally, they're openly robbing everybody blind, and you can't get ABC News Nightline, when they're here in your office, in our office, you can't even get them to stop laughing about it.
[01:43:00.672 --> 01:43:06.835]  Laughing about Goldman Sachs, laughing about what's happening right now, laughing about the country falling apart.
[01:43:06.835 --> 01:43:08.596]  It is a joke.
[01:43:08.596 --> 01:43:10.277]  It doesn't exist.
[01:43:10.277 --> 01:43:14.839]  The video you're about to see doesn't exist according to these people.
[01:43:14.839 --> 01:43:16.300]  Here is a snippet of it.
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:24.364]  This transformation, which again has been prepared, it is something which didn't come as a sharp and
[01:43:25.103 --> 01:43:51.729]  I would say an expected event because the G20 existed already, but this shift from the G7 to the G20, it seems to me obviously because it was overdue that these economies that were obviously systemic at the global level would have a full ownership of this global governance at the level of this informal grouping that I mentioned.
[01:43:52.645 --> 01:43:58.788]  But, and that's of course something which appears absolutely obvious.
[01:43:58.788 --> 01:44:03.671]  I trust also that there is a second reason.
[01:44:03.671 --> 01:44:18.359]  Perhaps the industrialized country proved that they were quite clumsy themselves in running their own economy, which remain of course at the core of global finance and of the global economy.
[01:44:18.359 --> 01:44:22.081]  And that is something that we have to take fully into account.
[01:44:23.641 --> 01:44:49.221]  It is of utmost importance that the new Basel rules that we are preparing, and we are in an intense phase of discussion, after having had the input of the industry, the industry was in dialogue with the Basel Committee, we have this industry response, and now we have to engage in calibration.
[01:44:49.221 --> 01:44:50.622]  Okay, that's enough!
[01:44:52.003 --> 01:44:56.805]  It goes on and on, more than a dozen times, calling for global government, global governance.
[01:44:56.805 --> 01:45:06.810]  Now, when you get SPP documents, or you get North American Union documents, or you get internal EU documents, or Copenhagen documents, like the treaty, they wouldn't give the treaty to the public.
[01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:10.691]  It had to be leaked, and it was confirmed by the London Guardian, and the...
[01:45:12.012 --> 01:45:18.835]  The UN admitted, no this is the treaty, and it was just hundreds of taxes, total control, paid to private banks.
[01:45:18.835 --> 01:45:32.521]  And so when you get these documents, it's the top corporations and banks at meetings, they all agree on what they're going to do, and then the presidents and prime ministers sit there like errand boys and errand girls, writing down their orders.
[01:45:34.457 --> 01:45:36.178]  And you just heard him talking about that.
[01:45:36.178 --> 01:45:39.922]  Private corporations are the ones that run this.
[01:45:39.922 --> 01:45:48.949]  And so you've got private central banks and mega-corporations like IBM and Microsoft and Walmart at all of these events.
[01:45:48.949 --> 01:45:54.734]  And so you have government, mega-industry, and mega-media all teamed up together against the public.
[01:45:54.734 --> 01:46:00.459]  They're organized, they're focused, and they control the world through your taxes and regulations.
[01:46:01.772 --> 01:46:06.213]  And here he is, out in the open, calling for global government.
[01:46:06.213 --> 01:46:16.197]  And you can go read the full transcript or watch the entire video in Paul Watson's excellent article, Trichette Calls for Corrupt BIS to Boss Global Government in a CFR Speech.
[01:46:18.237 --> 01:46:22.460]  It nexuses in with the IMF and World Bank and the Federal Reserve and Bank of England.
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:25.582]  All just front holding companies for private banks.
[01:46:25.582 --> 01:46:26.742]  That's on record.
[01:46:26.742 --> 01:46:28.283]  But it's totally secret.
[01:46:28.283 --> 01:46:32.086]  All we have is the documents that have been leaked and their speeches.
[01:46:32.086 --> 01:46:36.088]  And what they're talking about openly is completely illegal.
[01:46:36.088 --> 01:46:38.469]  So, that's what's happening.
[01:46:38.469 --> 01:46:42.272]  We have some major breaking news here today.
[01:46:42.272 --> 01:46:45.514]  This is from Kurt Nimmo.
[01:46:46.983 --> 01:46:47.603]  Is U.S.
[01:46:47.603 --> 01:46:51.165]  Army training to take on the Tea Party?
[01:46:51.165 --> 01:46:53.606]  And he has video of this.
[01:46:53.606 --> 01:47:00.629]  We talked about how they tried to stick riot police on peaceful Tea Party people in Illinois yesterday with Obama.
[01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:02.470]  And now we discover the Army was there.
[01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:03.911]  Well, of course the Army was there.
[01:47:03.911 --> 01:47:09.373]  Regular Army and National Guard at G20 in Pittsburgh last year.
[01:47:09.373 --> 01:47:10.314]  Of course they're there.
[01:47:10.954 --> 01:47:36.073]  I mean, we got the document, what, over a year ago, that the Ron Paul events, the Tea Party events, and of course they have sound cannons at the events for the public in San Diego, and we learned that I'm being surveilled, Ron Paul's being surveilled, that the NtheFed events have regular Army intelligence there, and in the particular document we've covered at Nauseam here, it said, don't let them know you're Army, or they may attack you.
[01:47:37.148 --> 01:47:38.769]  So they're telling him we're dangerous terrorists.
[01:47:38.769 --> 01:47:42.451]  Yeah, we're evil Americans that don't like offshore banks robbing us.
[01:47:42.451 --> 01:47:43.091]  Is the U.S.
[01:47:43.091 --> 01:47:45.332]  Army trying to take on the Tea Party?
[01:47:45.332 --> 01:47:51.656]  On April 17th, the Courier-Journal in Louisville, Kentucky reported on an Army exercise dubbed
[01:47:53.209 --> 01:48:04.038]  M-A-N-G-U-D-A-I, named after the special forces of Genghis Khan's Mongol army, who could fight for days without food or sleep.
[01:48:04.038 --> 01:48:10.724]  The Kentucky newspaper portrayed the exercise as an effort to train soldiers to battle the Taliban in Afghanistan.
[01:48:10.724 --> 01:48:14.387]  Designed to test the limits of officers' physical, mental, and emotional endurance,
[01:48:15.248 --> 01:48:19.431]  They had one of these drills in Austin a week and a half ago, by the way, at Camp Mabry.
[01:48:19.431 --> 01:48:28.056]  The emerging army exercise offered a revealing window onto modern combat training in the era of Iraq and Afghanistan, Chris Kenning wrote for the newspaper.
[01:48:28.056 --> 01:48:35.820]  Over three days last week, participants had to crawl on their bellies under real machine gun fire, shiny commando style.
[01:48:36.881 --> 01:48:42.865]  Shimmy commando style over to single rope, eye in the air, and march for more than 22 miles through the forest.
[01:48:42.865 --> 01:48:50.450]  But according to information received by the Patriot blog post, there's another aspect of the military exercise not reported by local media.
[01:48:50.450 --> 01:49:00.377]  This week, I was contacted by a number of military personnel enlisted in officer's ranks who expressed concern about military exercises underway at Fort Knox, the U.S.
[01:49:00.377 --> 01:49:01.938]  Bullion Depository.
[01:49:01.938 --> 01:49:05.521]  As with most such exercises, the Fort Knox alert occurred in stages.
[01:49:06.161 --> 01:49:11.267]  As if real-time intelligence was being provided to various intervals, writes Mark Alexander.
[01:49:11.267 --> 01:49:19.257]  Alexander cites an intel advisory issued on Friday, April 20, 2010, that identifies terrorist threat adversaries as local militia groups.
[01:49:19.257 --> 01:49:20.739]  That's confirmed.
[01:49:20.739 --> 01:49:22.881]  Anti-government protesters, Tea Party.
[01:49:22.881 --> 01:49:24.003]  And then we have...
[01:49:25.399 --> 01:49:26.780]  A link to that.
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:31.946]  In short, the military was training in Kentucky to take on mythical militias.
[01:49:31.946 --> 01:49:33.607]  And that's also going on in Illinois.
[01:49:33.607 --> 01:49:39.333]  No word if they were the FBI creative variety, and remarkably, the non-violent Tea Party movement.
[01:49:39.333 --> 01:49:44.378]  See, North Com and Homeland Security is meant to engage red-blooded Americans.
[01:49:47.156 --> 01:49:50.338]  We even have the military now talking about the scenario.
[01:49:50.338 --> 01:49:59.862]  It continues, anti-government health care protesters have stated that they would join the Tea Party as a sign of solidarity during a protest at Fort Knox.
[01:49:59.862 --> 01:50:05.165]  The Tea Party groups are armed, have combative training, and some are former military snipers.
[01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:09.507]  Some may have explosive training experience according to the Intel report.
[01:50:09.507 --> 01:50:11.588]  So this is what the military is being taught.
[01:50:12.288 --> 01:50:21.773]  And I told you over a year and a half ago they were training every police department for IED attacks, improvised explosive device attacks, by militias.
[01:50:21.773 --> 01:50:29.538]  And they're going to stage attacks, say the American people are doing it, and they're going to try to roll the military out nationwide to confiscate the guns, just like New Orleans.
[01:50:29.538 --> 01:50:31.519]  They are preparing for this.
[01:50:31.519 --> 01:50:33.380]  We've got to get the word out now.
[01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:36.662]  They'll blow up a few federal buildings, they'll kill some troops, and blame it on us.
[01:50:38.442 --> 01:50:46.909]  The Intel report updated Monday the 26th of April 2010 noted that the rally at the militia compound occurred and viable threats have been made.
[01:50:46.909 --> 01:50:53.355]  Many members were extremely agitated at what they referred to as government intervention over taxation and their lives.
[01:50:53.355 --> 01:50:56.097]  We'll be right back with more of this.
[01:50:56.097 --> 01:50:59.280]  This is just more devastating information.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:01.241]  I want Watson to do a boil down.
[01:51:01.241 --> 01:51:04.184]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:51:07.947 --> 01:51:08.688]  I think so.
[01:51:21.212 --> 01:51:27.373]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[01:52:01.232 --> 01:52:02.533]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.533 --> 01:52:08.118]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.118 --> 01:52:13.143]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.143 --> 01:52:18.708]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.708 --> 01:52:23.412]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.922 --> 01:52:31.044]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[01:54:05.455 --> 01:54:06.476]  This is so amazing.
[01:54:06.476 --> 01:54:12.739]  During the three-minute break, I'm reading over the actual intel documents from the U.S.
[01:54:12.739 --> 01:54:14.660]  Army, directly from the U.S.
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:19.362]  Army, posted on mainstream newspaper posts.
[01:54:19.362 --> 01:54:21.824]  This is mainstream news.
[01:54:21.824 --> 01:54:23.725]  Exercise, exercise, exercise.
[01:54:24.705 --> 01:54:30.790]  Taking on military, U.S., former military that's planning to kill U.S.
[01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:31.151]  troops.
[01:54:31.151 --> 01:54:34.974]  See, and this has been going on forever, but now it's intensifying.
[01:54:34.974 --> 01:54:36.836]  And they've got riot training, you name it.
[01:54:36.836 --> 01:54:39.358]  First, they train the troops to take on Muslims.
[01:54:39.358 --> 01:54:43.942]  And they also have some of that, the drills, guys wearing headdresses.
[01:54:43.942 --> 01:54:46.124]  But then they just shift over
[01:54:49.053 --> 01:54:53.254]  And they talk about the militias are drunk and that alcohol use fanned the flames.
[01:54:53.254 --> 01:54:59.176]  Many military-grade firearms were openly carried at the militia compound.
[01:54:59.176 --> 01:54:59.857]  Former U.S.
[01:54:59.857 --> 01:55:00.817]  military involved.
[01:55:00.817 --> 01:55:01.977]  So, the U.S.
[01:55:01.977 --> 01:55:02.477]  military.
[01:55:02.477 --> 01:55:05.418]  This is the headline Watson needs to put up or Curt needs to put up.
[01:55:05.418 --> 01:55:06.579]  This is confirmed.
[01:55:07.439 --> 01:55:14.168]  I mean, you know, Kurt is a professional journalist who's worked for major newspapers, and I love Kurt to death, but it shouldn't be, is the U.S.
[01:55:14.168 --> 01:55:16.491]  Army training to take on the Tea Party?
[01:55:16.491 --> 01:55:22.098]  It says they're training to take on the Tea Party and the militias in the documents right here.
[01:55:24.073 --> 01:55:25.173]  I don't even know.
[01:55:25.173 --> 01:55:32.855]  I want to have Dr. Bob Bowman on about other issues, but I pretty much... I'm going to get him to talk about this because, I mean, this is a subject we've got to talk about now.
[01:55:32.855 --> 01:55:35.436]  Folks, it's happening so fast.
[01:55:35.436 --> 01:55:38.316]  It's happening so furious.
[01:55:38.316 --> 01:55:44.158]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we'll pull the article up on screen for people where we have these documents saved.
[01:55:45.103 --> 01:55:50.266]  And you can go read these for yourself, dated April 23rd and April 26th.
[01:55:50.266 --> 01:55:56.029]  Some of this was just going on three, four days ago, and this is just disgusting.
[01:55:56.029 --> 01:56:01.011]  And I'm reading this, that militias are going to attack the Fort Knox Gold Depository.
[01:56:01.011 --> 01:56:04.333]  Give me a stinking break.
[01:56:04.333 --> 01:56:06.114]  I mean, is there no end to this?
[01:56:06.114 --> 01:56:10.716]  That's why you've got to get Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA on DVD.
[01:56:12.037 --> 01:56:12.157]  I'm
[01:56:26.937 --> 01:56:29.499]  I mean, they're training to take our guns.
[01:56:29.499 --> 01:56:30.919]  They're saying we're terrorists.
[01:56:30.919 --> 01:56:36.103]  They're training the Boy Scouts and the New York Times reports to quote, take on disgruntled veterans.
[01:56:36.103 --> 01:56:43.067]  We have the MIAC and Homeland Security reports where they admitted over a year ago that the main target of Homeland Security is the American people.
[01:56:43.067 --> 01:56:48.770]  And then last week, the head of the FBI said, yes, we're shifting from Muslims to the American people.
[01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:51.512]  And the Muslim threat is fake to a certain extent.
[01:56:51.512 --> 01:56:52.893]  This is completely fake.
[01:56:53.633 --> 01:56:59.077]  And they're staging these events and building it up to use the military against us.
[01:56:59.077 --> 01:57:02.160]  And large portions of the military are already illegal aliens they've hired.
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:07.504]  Obama rallied with a bunch of illegal alien troops that they were legalizing last week.
[01:57:07.504 --> 01:57:09.586]  I mean, we are in so much trouble.
[01:57:09.586 --> 01:57:14.109]  I just can't even believe how sickening all of this is getting.
[01:57:14.109 --> 01:57:14.850]  The demonstration
[01:57:16.806 --> 01:57:19.410]  Did not happen due to federal and local law enforcement influence.
[01:57:19.410 --> 01:57:22.274]  So they're saying they went in and stopped the demonstration.
[01:57:22.274 --> 01:57:26.820]  Possible raid on local white supremacist organization may have been made in the last 48 hours.
[01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:33.049]  And see, they talk about white supremacists and they say Tea Party organizers stated that they will protest at the Gold Vault.
[01:57:33.590 --> 01:57:34.752]  At a future date.
[01:57:34.752 --> 01:57:43.904]  And then it talks about tracking the Tea Parties, tracking the militias, how they've got infiltrator groups in there, how the Army's working with federal and local law enforcement organizations.
[01:57:43.904 --> 01:57:51.293]  As these groups are armed and have combative training, and some are former military snipers, some have made explosives training experience.
[01:57:52.714 --> 01:58:13.620]  And it goes on to talk about their exercise to take on the Tea Parties and take on the militias and they mix in white supremacist with it and then meanwhile Oklahoma passes bill outlawing militias saying you can't have a militia we're gonna just arrest you for that and this has got years in prison under it.
[01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:20.802]  I mean they are moving against the American people there is no doubt it just gets worse and worse and worse by the minute.
[01:58:22.148 --> 01:58:23.348]  This is a red alert!
[01:58:23.348 --> 01:58:37.591]  Good job Nemo getting this up, but I mean, we need to get Watson on this right now with headline, military training to take on tea parties, militias and others, listing former military as terrorist.
[01:58:37.591 --> 01:58:42.412]  Okay, that is what this does.
[01:58:42.412 --> 01:58:45.933]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:02.877 --> 01:59:11.601]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:11.601 --> 01:59:15.663]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:59:15.663 --> 01:59:17.624]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:59:20.103 --> 01:59:24.684]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:59:24.684 --> 01:59:28.525]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[01:59:28.525 --> 01:59:29.745]  Others don't.
[01:59:29.745 --> 01:59:31.906]  We turn jeans inside out.

[01:59:48.270 --> 01:59:49.130]  Others don't.
[01:59:53.795 --> 02:00:01.780]  Waging War on Corruption Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network Big Brother
[02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:08.552]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.552 --> 02:00:10.313]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.313 --> 02:00:11.894]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.894 --> 02:00:13.435]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.435 --> 02:00:17.639]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.639 --> 02:00:21.702]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.753 --> 02:00:27.413]  Red alert!
[02:00:27.413 --> 02:00:28.034]  Red alert!
[02:00:28.034 --> 02:00:28.934]  Red alert!
[02:00:28.934 --> 02:00:30.955]  We've got it up on InfoWars.com.
[02:00:30.955 --> 02:00:32.937]  Kurt Nemo's got an article, Is the U.S.
[02:00:32.937 --> 02:00:34.878]  Army Training to Take on the Tea Party?
[02:00:34.878 --> 02:00:41.802]  Then it has links to mainstream news articles, mainstream newspapers that are reporting it like it's good.
[02:00:41.802 --> 02:00:52.428]  Military regular army exercises with federal and local police around the country, where militia groups along with veterans are basically preparing to attack the government.
[02:00:53.683 --> 02:00:59.287]  And this integrates into this entire program of control that we see expanding.
[02:00:59.287 --> 02:01:01.729]  I have Dr. Bob Bowman who was on with us last week.
[02:01:01.729 --> 02:01:02.830]  We re-aired it Sunday.
[02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:03.611]  I didn't do a live show.
[02:01:03.611 --> 02:01:04.892]  We'll be doing a live show this Sunday.
[02:01:04.892 --> 02:01:08.555]  And I wanted to get him on about solutions today and how to take the country back.
[02:01:08.555 --> 02:01:13.279]  But separately they had the secret space plane launch that he's an expert on, former head of the Star Wars program.
[02:01:14.539 --> 02:01:17.662]  This week, we were talking about it last week, then they had a secret launch this week.
[02:01:17.662 --> 02:01:18.903]  We'll talk more about that.
[02:01:18.903 --> 02:01:23.466]  We'll also get into solutions with him, but I just talked to him during the break.
[02:01:23.466 --> 02:01:40.339]  He joins us via video Skype here at PrisonPlanet.tv and on the radio, and so we're going to be talking to him first about the paramilitary militarization of police and all the documents we've gotten where NORTHCOM is preparing to take on the American people.
[02:01:41.279 --> 02:01:41.840]  I don't
[02:01:59.017 --> 02:02:04.981]  We've already seen leaked documents that the in the Fed rallies, Ron Paul and myself are being watched by the army.
[02:02:04.981 --> 02:02:10.445]  They tell the army that don't let the in the Fedders know at the rallies that you're military or they may attack you.
[02:02:10.445 --> 02:02:13.767]  I mean, they are really getting ready to use the military against the American people.
[02:02:13.767 --> 02:02:16.709]  And our government has overthrown countless third world nations.
[02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:18.030]  They're experts on this.
[02:02:18.030 --> 02:02:20.391]  When they have their druthers, they want a dictatorship.
[02:02:20.391 --> 02:02:22.433]  In other countries, they want it here.
[02:02:22.433 --> 02:02:23.574]  Presidents come and go.
[02:02:23.574 --> 02:02:26.936]  The tyranny of the military industrial complex only grows.
[02:02:26.936 --> 02:02:28.017]  Dr. Robert M. Bowman,
[02:02:28.777 --> 02:02:31.598]  Well, I'll just introduce him in the next segment, but let's go to him now.
[02:02:31.598 --> 02:02:36.441]  Dr. Bowman, I just started briefing you on this, but I know you're familiar with the backstory on this.
[02:02:36.441 --> 02:02:38.362]  Does this concern you?
[02:02:38.362 --> 02:02:39.382]  Well, of course it does.
[02:02:39.382 --> 02:02:42.924]  I've been speaking about this for years.
[02:02:42.924 --> 02:02:56.051]  The good news is they're not going to get away with it because, you know, I've talked to a lot of military folks and the majority, the vast majority, will not
[02:02:58.059 --> 02:03:19.247]  Well, let's talk about the history of this, Sean, and then I'm going to go over these new leaked documents to newspapers in Kentucky and other states, and the Army is confirming that these are real.
[02:03:19.247 --> 02:03:25.869]  But, I mean, this has got to be a wake-up call to the military, Dr. Bowman, that they're being trained to engage the American people.
[02:03:27.383 --> 02:03:49.130]  Yes it is and that's why organizations like the Oath Keepers is so important because we've got to teach the members of the military and law enforcement in this country about the Nuremberg Principles and about the Constitution and the fact that they have an absolute duty never to follow an order
[02:03:50.086 --> 02:04:02.482]  To engage in a war of aggression or to arrest, incarcerate or disarm their fellow American citizens for simply exercising their constitutional right of dissent.
[02:04:04.517 --> 02:04:05.718]  This is incredible.
[02:04:05.718 --> 02:04:20.294]  And again they just incrementally are acclimating us to be like Guatemala or Nigeria with just troops all over the streets and mobile naked body scanners and checkpoints and just everything else that is now happening.
[02:04:20.294 --> 02:04:22.656]  But we'll discuss Oath Keepers when we get back.
[02:04:22.656 --> 02:04:24.098]  I know you've been involved with them.
[02:04:24.098 --> 02:04:25.139]  Here's Mother Jones.
[02:04:25.139 --> 02:04:26.720]  Oath Keepers in the age of treason
[02:04:27.481 --> 02:04:32.384]  Meet the fast-growing Patriot group that's recruiting soldiers to resist the Obama administration.
[02:04:32.384 --> 02:04:34.806]  That's a complete lie.
[02:04:34.806 --> 02:04:37.368]  They're calling people to follow their oath.
[02:04:37.368 --> 02:04:41.831]  It's run by a former Ron Paul staffer.
[02:04:41.831 --> 02:04:45.373]  They're not calling for anything offensive.
[02:04:45.373 --> 02:04:50.537]  They're saying, follow your oath, and we'll talk about the oath that the military and the police
[02:04:51.417 --> 02:04:52.138]  Give.
[02:04:52.138 --> 02:04:54.321]  If tyranny comes to your door, it comes in a uniform.
[02:04:54.321 --> 02:04:55.523]  Stay there, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[02:04:55.523 --> 02:04:59.828]  We'll be right back with our guest on the other side.
[02:04:59.828 --> 02:05:00.209]  Stay with us.
[02:05:04.821 --> 02:05:06.081]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.081 --> 02:05:09.803]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:09.803 --> 02:05:12.224]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.224 --> 02:05:18.106]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:18.106 --> 02:05:24.348]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.788 --> 02:05:30.710]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.710 --> 02:05:34.931]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:34.931 --> 02:05:39.212]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.212 --> 02:05:45.154]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.154 --> 02:05:48.715]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.715 --> 02:05:50.696]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.696 --> 02:05:51.136]  It's here.

[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:04.141]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.141 --> 02:06:09.483]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.483 --> 02:06:11.523]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.523 --> 02:06:16.505]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.505 --> 02:06:17.706]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.706 --> 02:06:18.426]  When do you want it?
[02:06:18.826 --> 02:06:20.708]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.708 --> 02:06:21.769]  When will you need it?
[02:06:21.769 --> 02:06:23.970]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:23.970 --> 02:06:25.312]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.312 --> 02:06:26.853]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:26.853 --> 02:06:32.117]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.117 --> 02:06:35.240]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:39.503]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.503 --> 02:06:40.744]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.744 --> 02:06:41.644]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.644 --> 02:06:42.745]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.745 --> 02:06:43.666]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.666 --> 02:06:44.767]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:07:46.286 --> 02:08:06.497]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.497 --> 02:08:10.379]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:10.379 --> 02:08:15.362]  Scores of documents have fallen into our hands and have been reported by the mainstream news to be authentic.
[02:08:16.331 --> 02:08:27.398]  That the main enemy of the federal government is gun owners, returning veterans, libertarians, in the fetters, anti-war activists, and they're having drills all over the country.
[02:08:27.398 --> 02:08:29.660]  They're working with every local law enforcement group.
[02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:34.483]  This has been declassified that militias are going to attack police departments with IEDs.
[02:08:35.663 --> 02:08:36.224]  We're good
[02:08:58.346 --> 02:09:02.848]  To also prepare for the attack, but to also demonize the groups you're going to be fighting.
[02:09:02.848 --> 02:09:10.091]  Remember, it came out with these shooting drills at schools in Michigan, where they would say, homeschoolers against government education.
[02:09:10.091 --> 02:09:11.252]  That was the one group.
[02:09:11.252 --> 02:09:17.994]  Came in, didn't announce to the kids, it was the police posing as homeschooling parents, who were going to kill children.
[02:09:17.994 --> 02:09:20.355]  That's a way to demonize homeschoolers.
[02:09:20.355 --> 02:09:21.036]  It's asinine.
[02:09:22.196 --> 02:09:24.577]  And I can think of no better guest to talk about this.
[02:09:24.577 --> 02:09:26.478]  We're going to get into some other issues as well.
[02:09:26.478 --> 02:09:28.719]  There's Dr. Bob Bowman, Lieutenant Colonel, U.S.
[02:09:28.719 --> 02:09:40.685]  Air Force, retired, President of the Institute for Space and Security Studies, Executive Vice President, Millennium 3 Corporation, retired, presiding, and it just goes on and on here.
[02:09:40.685 --> 02:09:46.888]  He, 101 combat missions as a fighter pilot in Vietnam, the head of the DoD Star Wars programs under two presidents,
[02:09:47.748 --> 02:09:50.011]  And we appreciate him coming on.
[02:09:50.011 --> 02:09:55.497]  www.thepatriots.us is his website.
[02:09:55.497 --> 02:10:02.024]  Dr. Bob Bowman, recap what you were saying in the last segment and spend some time on this and your concerns and then you brought up...
[02:10:02.916 --> 02:10:07.500]  Oath keepers, and I have all these mainstream news articles saying they are treasonous.
[02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:09.222]  Here's Mother Jones.
[02:10:09.222 --> 02:10:11.825]  Oath keepers in the age of treason.
[02:10:11.825 --> 02:10:23.976]  What all oath keepers are saying is, we will not confiscate guns, we will not take people to FEMA camps, we will follow the Nuremberg Code, which isn't, I guess, even taught anymore to the military.
[02:10:23.976 --> 02:10:25.578]  Dr. Bob Bowman, good to have you here with us.
[02:10:26.530 --> 02:10:37.826]  Well thank you, and you know, saying that Oath Keepers is against the Obama administration is ridiculous, because we started Oath Keepers way back under George W. Bush!
[02:10:38.713 --> 02:11:07.221]  uh... this organization is not against any particular administration this organization is sworn to follow their oath of office to protect and defend the constitution of the united states of america these organizations the military and law enforcement are supposed to protect the constitution and the people of the united states and it doesn't matter who it is that's
[02:11:08.141 --> 02:11:13.422]  Trying to do the people in.
[02:11:13.422 --> 02:11:34.706]  And if they try and get the military and law enforcement to do it, and it seems like they're trying, they're trying to demonize the American people and people like militias and gun owners and oath keepers and 9-11 truthers and goes on and on.
[02:11:36.664 --> 02:11:42.337]  I don't think they're going to succeed, but it's a real battle and it's one that
[02:11:44.012 --> 02:11:56.901]  I'm going to be engaged in with our organization, the Patriots, because I'm sure that with the name we have now, the Patriots, they're going to demonize us as well.
[02:11:56.901 --> 02:12:11.090]  And we're going to keep working with the Pentagon to inform them of the facts and their duty and how all this stuff fits in.
[02:12:11.090 --> 02:12:13.172]  As you know, three years ago,
[02:12:14.092 --> 02:12:26.876]  I sent a letter to the generals and admirals of the Pentagon saying that they must not attack Iran and if anybody orders them to do it, they should arrest whoever did it as a war criminal.
[02:12:26.876 --> 02:12:34.438]  In the same way now, I'm going to be sending a letter reminding them that the American people are not their enemy.
[02:12:34.438 --> 02:12:40.200]  And if somebody orders them to round up Americans, dissenters, though we may be,
[02:12:41.408 --> 02:12:46.628]  They must not only refuse that order, but consider arresting whoever gave it.
[02:12:48.015 --> 02:12:48.736]  Absolutely.
[02:12:48.736 --> 02:13:04.587]  For someone who studied history, someone who's been a military officer commanding the Star Wars system, I mean, this was always taught 101 to even low-level officers that in a tyranny they try to use the military against the people.
[02:13:04.587 --> 02:13:07.689]  This is called a military-industrial complex coup.
[02:13:07.689 --> 02:13:11.051]  This is, anyone that does this is engaged in treason.
[02:13:11.051 --> 02:13:17.056]  And now the Oath Keepers have their ten pledges that are all right out of the Bill of Rights, all right out of the Constitution.
[02:13:18.056 --> 02:13:29.184]  And to then demonize them and to have mock drills where it says, you know, it starts out with a Tea Party protest against the Federal Reserve in these documents.
[02:13:29.184 --> 02:13:34.708]  And then it leads to former military people trying to sniper troops in the drill.
[02:13:34.708 --> 02:13:39.231]  And so they're teaching the military that the American people are going to try to kill you.
[02:13:39.951 --> 02:13:53.977]  I mean, this is amazing brainwashing and it really shows us clearly just another example of what's going on inside the Justice Department, inside the Pentagon, inside local police that are part of this drill to take on the American people.
[02:13:53.977 --> 02:13:54.978]  I mean, they are clearly
[02:13:56.078 --> 02:14:02.120]  Quietly building this system for the American people, saying it was for outside groups, just as Hitler did.
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:06.622]  And now they're openly getting their people ready to go up against the American people.
[02:14:06.622 --> 02:14:11.824]  And as we talked about last week, Dr. Bowman, Colonel Bowman, I believe they're going to stage false flags.
[02:14:11.824 --> 02:14:17.306]  We see the preparatory brainwashing in the media for this against government installations, military bases, you name it.
[02:14:18.186 --> 02:14:18.326]  Yeah.
[02:14:30.387 --> 02:14:34.711]  Yeah, I think they very well may try it.
[02:14:34.711 --> 02:14:42.779]  But again, there are high-ranking people in the military that are aware of this stuff.
[02:14:42.779 --> 02:14:55.871]  And just like back when it was Iran that Cheney and company was trying to attack, there are going to be people up there that say, not on my watch.
[02:14:57.076 --> 02:14:57.977]  Well, yeah.
[02:14:57.977 --> 02:15:04.541]  I mean, talk about Fox Fallon, the head of CENTCOM, resigned and said, I'm not going to launch an illegal attack on Iran.
[02:15:04.541 --> 02:15:05.741]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:15:05.741 --> 02:15:06.442]  That's right.
[02:15:06.442 --> 02:15:09.444]  And there's going to be more people like him.
[02:15:09.444 --> 02:15:18.909]  Well, for those who don't know, who don't know military history, international law, attacking a country first, I mean, that is one of the greatest crimes you can commit.
[02:15:18.909 --> 02:15:20.070]  That's right.
[02:15:20.070 --> 02:15:24.233]  And we, of course, we've already done it twice recently in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:15:26.519 --> 02:15:34.243]  Claiming that they carried out 9-11, and of course, just in a nutshell, Colonel, what happened on 9-11?
[02:15:34.243 --> 02:15:46.448]  Well, we don't know, really, who did it, but we can be doggone sure that it wasn't 19 Arabs with box cutters and an old man in a cave on a dialysis machine.
[02:15:46.448 --> 02:15:50.290]  We know that there was a lot more to it than that.
[02:15:50.290 --> 02:15:53.732]  That those demonized enemies could not
[02:15:54.372 --> 02:16:21.254]  have uh... uh... sidelined our whole air defense system uh... they could not have pre-wired the buildings with uh... nano thermite to bring them down in a controlled demolition fashion uh... they they just couldn't have done it and uh... we know for sure official conspiracy theory that the bush administration put together is totally impossible uh...
[02:16:23.766 --> 02:16:33.460]  On 9-11 we had the greatest crime of the century and perhaps of recent time.
[02:16:34.887 --> 02:16:42.391]  And we still don't know who did it because the 9-11 Commission wasn't asked to find out who did it.
[02:16:42.391 --> 02:16:50.956]  As a matter of fact, we now know that they were specifically told not to ask that question, not to worry about who did it.
[02:16:50.956 --> 02:16:52.817]  They said, you know, we know who did it.
[02:16:52.817 --> 02:16:55.859]  Just tell us, you know, where intelligence failed.
[02:16:55.859 --> 02:16:56.739]  So,
[02:16:59.079 --> 02:17:03.203]  Well, the important thing is what happened after 9-11.
[02:17:03.203 --> 02:17:17.675]  Because after 9-11, the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan offered to give us Osama bin Laden if we had evidence against him so that we could put him on trial for 9-11.
[02:17:17.675 --> 02:17:24.341]  And of course the Bush administration ignored that offer of the Taliban for two reasons.
[02:17:24.341 --> 02:17:25.582]  One, of course, they had
[02:17:26.457 --> 02:17:30.524]  No evidence against Osama Bin Laden and still don't.
[02:17:30.524 --> 02:17:37.736]  They probably knew at that point who did it and of course are covering it all up and protecting whoever did it.
[02:17:38.909 --> 02:17:51.412]  And secondly, they had already planned in detail the invasion of Afghanistan because Afghanistan wouldn't give UNICAL a gas pipeline.
[02:17:51.412 --> 02:18:01.915]  In fact, the BBC and Associated Press have reported that in the three months before 9-11, tens of thousands of US and British troops were massed in the stands around Afghanistan.
[02:18:01.915 --> 02:18:03.276]  The carriers were in place.
[02:18:03.276 --> 02:18:04.316]  It takes months to get
[02:18:04.676 --> 02:18:04.816]  That's
[02:18:20.798 --> 02:18:47.359]  Originally, a real letter was put out by Bin Laden and a statement that was confirmed to be authentic that he did not do it, but then they had all these fake websites and fake videos that have been proven to be fake, where he said that he did do it, and now they'll have a Facebook account two weeks ago saying he did it, and it turned out it was completely fake and some kid was running it, but the news for a week reported, oh look, Bin Laden has said he did it again.
[02:18:47.359 --> 02:18:48.040]  Yeah.
[02:18:49.317 --> 02:18:51.578]  They're trying to pull the wool over our eyes.
[02:18:51.578 --> 02:18:53.339]  They keep doing it.
[02:18:53.339 --> 02:19:00.542]  And guys like you and me, Alex, we have to just keep telling the truth, because only the truth can protect us.
[02:19:00.542 --> 02:19:07.866]  Well, let's, when we come back, because then I want to get into solutions and the Patriots.us and some of the things you're doing and Oath Keepers and a lot more.
[02:19:07.866 --> 02:19:09.647]  But this just broke in the last 30 minutes.
[02:19:10.927 --> 02:19:23.838]  Uh, which just adds to the giant stack of other government documents we've gotten where they have been secretly training the military for more than two decades to take on American gun owners.
[02:19:23.838 --> 02:19:28.942]  I mean, I've interviewed former, uh, Marine Corps captain back in 2001.
[02:19:28.942 --> 02:19:35.308]  Uh, and the last straw for him was when he drove through an army checkpoint.
[02:19:35.968 --> 02:19:40.052]  On I-35, and they were searching cars right here in Austin, it was in Kyle.
[02:19:40.052 --> 02:19:51.001]  So he went ahead and went public how in 88, 89, he was leading teams with police raiding American gun owners in Virginia as part of secret program.
[02:19:51.001 --> 02:19:54.343]  And of course now we've got a lot of documents proving that.
[02:19:54.343 --> 02:19:59.127]  And I interviewed a colonel last year who admitted they were doing gun confiscation drills in Iowa.
[02:19:59.127 --> 02:20:00.689]  So they are preparing to come.
[02:20:01.923 --> 02:20:03.164]  Global meltdowns.
[02:20:03.164 --> 02:20:04.584]  Massive unemployment.
[02:20:04.584 --> 02:20:05.785]  Endless wars.
[02:20:05.785 --> 02:20:07.446]  A new currency crisis.
[02:20:07.446 --> 02:20:09.526]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[02:20:09.526 --> 02:20:11.667]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:20:11.667 --> 02:20:13.568]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[02:20:13.568 --> 02:20:15.649]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[02:20:15.649 --> 02:20:17.630]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:23.793]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[02:20:25.674 --> 02:20:26.194]  We're good to go.

[02:21:01.329 --> 02:21:03.710]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:06.031]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:06.031 --> 02:21:09.233]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:09.233 --> 02:21:14.335]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:14.335 --> 02:21:18.537]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.837 --> 02:21:21.318]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:21.318 --> 02:21:23.739]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.739 --> 02:21:26.981]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.981 --> 02:21:34.584]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.924 --> 02:21:40.326]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:40.326 --> 02:21:42.626]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.626 --> 02:21:46.847]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.847 --> 02:21:47.928]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.928 --> 02:21:49.268]  You're everyone else.

[02:23:00.919 --> 02:23:01.840]  You worry.

[02:23:03.862 --> 02:23:06.405]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:23:06.405 --> 02:23:08.507]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:23:08.507 --> 02:23:10.108]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:23:10.108 --> 02:23:13.712]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:23:13.712 --> 02:23:18.957]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:23:18.957 --> 02:23:22.261]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:23:22.742 --> 02:23:24.422]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:23:24.422 --> 02:23:27.283]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[02:23:27.283 --> 02:23:30.584]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:23:30.584 --> 02:23:39.026]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:23:39.026 --> 02:23:43.727]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[02:24:10.334 --> 02:24:14.759]  More than 2,000 years ago, the Roman Republic fell.
[02:24:14.759 --> 02:24:20.105]  It officially fell in 410, hundreds of years later, but the Republic
[02:24:21.277 --> 02:24:29.523]  That had some level of freedom fell when Julius Caesar marched his troops into Italy, across the Rubicon.
[02:24:29.523 --> 02:24:31.785]  It was illegal, it was high treason to do so.
[02:24:31.785 --> 02:24:34.447]  They wouldn't even allow troops in the country.
[02:24:35.745 --> 02:24:38.187]  They wouldn't allow them in the city of Rome.
[02:24:38.187 --> 02:24:54.577]  They have known for thousands of years that when you have a standing army in the country, that's why the Founding Fathers said it was illegal, couldn't be used inside the country, that's why the Posse Comitatus Act 1878 says it's illegal, every time, look at Latin America where they're always having the military take over, look at Eastern Europe, look at Asia.
[02:24:55.257 --> 02:24:58.579]  And we know they're using the military illegally.
[02:24:58.579 --> 02:25:01.681]  They've set up NORTHCOM, made us a military jurisdiction.
[02:25:01.681 --> 02:25:09.685]  And now we know they're drilling and training, and the FBI admits the main target is gun-owning Americans, conservatives, libertarians.
[02:25:09.685 --> 02:25:15.048]  Dr. Bob Bowman, how do you see them trying to go hot with this?
[02:25:16.268 --> 02:25:17.069]  Stage terror?
[02:25:17.069 --> 02:25:17.669]  False flag?
[02:25:17.669 --> 02:25:24.813]  I mean, what are some of the scenarios and what should we do if we see a federal building blown up or God forbid a nuke detonated?
[02:25:24.813 --> 02:25:28.175]  We know Obama's people are now floating that.
[02:25:28.175 --> 02:25:29.656]  Attack Iran?
[02:25:29.656 --> 02:25:32.697]  Stage domestic attacks to go after domestic groups?
[02:25:32.697 --> 02:25:36.219]  I see it all happening as a combo.
[02:25:36.219 --> 02:25:43.924]  Well sure, we have to be prepared for any of that and one of the great things about the 9-11 Truth Movement is that
[02:25:45.842 --> 02:26:06.295]  In digging into all of this, we're watching now, and they know that we're watching, and that's why they may be deterred from some of these crazy schemes and new false flags, because they know we're liable to catch them red-handed, and we will.
[02:26:06.295 --> 02:26:09.957]  So, we've got to watch for that.
[02:26:09.957 --> 02:26:12.359]  If something happens,
[02:26:13.414 --> 02:26:28.751]  The American people have to know that before they think, oh, yes, it's some crazy Muslim group or it's a militia.
[02:26:28.751 --> 02:26:29.632]  No, no.
[02:26:29.632 --> 02:26:33.856]  They've got to think that it could be insiders in the
[02:26:36.405 --> 02:27:05.436]  military and intelligence establishment a rogue group uh... associated with our government and uh... uh... we have to make sure that the people know that that's a possibility so that uh... when these things happen uh... they don't automatically knee-jerk into uh... yeah let's go get those people whoever they're told uh... are the bad guys
[02:27:07.108 --> 02:27:18.855]  Well, you're absolutely right, and they're going to need a Gulf of Tonkin or an Operation Ajax or a Gleiwitz or a Reichstag or an Oklahoma City or a 9-11 to launch their new war against the American people.
[02:27:18.855 --> 02:27:23.998]  But we know in any military planning with the local police and the feds, with the FBI,
[02:27:24.818 --> 02:27:26.899]  That it takes years of planning and preparation.
[02:27:26.899 --> 02:27:29.201]  That's how we've known that this was coming.
[02:27:29.201 --> 02:27:40.707]  And I said it would start in 2010, 2011, because I could see all the preparation building towards this invasion, basically, of the American people by the military.
[02:27:40.707 --> 02:27:44.069]  And that's what Oath Keepers recognized several years ago.
[02:27:44.069 --> 02:27:46.751]  And that's what you've recognized for many years.
[02:27:46.751 --> 02:27:49.452]  And they have certainly crossed the Rubicon.
[02:27:49.452 --> 02:27:52.294]  The question is, will they be successful in bringing down the Republic?
[02:27:54.178 --> 02:27:57.159]  That indeed is the question, and my answer is hell no.
[02:27:57.159 --> 02:28:02.620]  They're not going to be successful because we're not going to let them.
[02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:12.622]  Dr. Bob Bowman, there may come a time very soon, and they're announcing North Com through cyber security can shut down the web.
[02:28:12.622 --> 02:28:18.803]  We're rapidly approaching a time and date where we may not even be on the air if they launch this full operation.
[02:28:18.803 --> 02:28:23.304]  And I just really hope people are taking this information extremely seriously.
[02:28:25.247 --> 02:28:28.531]  That's right, we have to use whatever we've got.
[02:28:28.531 --> 02:28:43.887]  The internet, the independent stations and networks like yours, our newsletters, our contacts, local access television, whatever we can use.
[02:28:44.648 --> 02:28:55.872]  To spread the word and we have to educate ourselves and our friends and our neighbors and our families and our communities by any means possible.
[02:28:55.872 --> 02:29:02.655]  I ask people who've subscribed to my newsletter to send us a list of people that you'd like to get educated.
[02:29:02.655 --> 02:29:08.677]  You know, we'll give them a free trial subscription and both by paper and email.
[02:29:10.666 --> 02:29:11.967]  We've got to get the word out.
[02:29:11.967 --> 02:29:15.328]  We've got to reach as many people as we can.
[02:29:15.328 --> 02:29:23.913]  We also want people around the country to form chapters of the Patriots just as we get chapters of both keepers.
[02:29:23.913 --> 02:29:29.216]  We've got to reach out to people all across the political spectrum and our members
[02:29:29.876 --> 02:29:32.298]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:32.298 --> 02:29:35.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.874 --> 02:30:03.276]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:30:03.276 --> 02:30:05.579]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:30:05.579 --> 02:30:08.802]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:30:08.802 --> 02:30:13.907]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:30:13.907 --> 02:30:18.091]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:30:18.411 --> 02:30:20.753]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:30:20.753 --> 02:30:23.634]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:30:23.634 --> 02:30:26.556]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:30:26.556 --> 02:30:34.161]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:30:34.488 --> 02:30:39.773]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:30:39.773 --> 02:30:42.735]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:30:42.735 --> 02:30:46.418]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:30:46.418 --> 02:30:47.499]  And I got news for you.
[02:30:47.499 --> 02:30:48.840]  You're everyone else.
[02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:50.341]  Invisible Empire.

[02:31:00.831 --> 02:31:02.131]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:02.131 --> 02:31:07.733]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:07.733 --> 02:31:12.755]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:31:12.755 --> 02:31:17.777]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:31:18.317 --> 02:31:23.538]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:31:23.538 --> 02:31:30.660]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:31:30.660 --> 02:31:31.780]  And here's the best part.
[02:31:31.780 --> 02:31:38.122]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:31:38.462 --> 02:31:41.644]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:41.644 --> 02:31:43.866]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:43.866 --> 02:31:44.806]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:31:44.806 --> 02:31:45.006]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:45.006 --> 02:31:48.448]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:31:48.448 --> 02:31:50.210]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:00.636 --> 02:32:05.962]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:32:05.962 --> 02:32:08.705]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:32:08.705 --> 02:32:13.170]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:32:14.042 --> 02:32:18.503]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[02:32:26.606 --> 02:32:34.668]  It exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[02:32:34.668 --> 02:32:36.529]  This film needs to be seen.
[02:32:36.529 --> 02:32:37.669]  Everybody needs to get it.

[02:32:48.475 --> 02:32:49.875]  Shadow Government.
[02:32:49.875 --> 02:32:52.097]  It gives Big Brother a black eye.
[02:32:52.097 --> 02:32:55.359]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:05.972 --> 02:33:07.353]  Welcome back, my friends.
[02:33:07.353 --> 02:33:09.775]  As we defend the Republic, I have cleared the phone lines.
[02:33:09.775 --> 02:33:20.464]  I apologize to other callers who were holding, but I want to have the phones open for military and police who have been part of drills to take on the American people.
[02:33:20.464 --> 02:33:24.687]  Now, it's been in the news, this has been going on for years, but more and more is coming out.
[02:33:24.687 --> 02:33:28.810]  They could just have dry exercises where combatants try to attack military bases.
[02:33:29.671 --> 02:33:34.274]  But no, they say tea parties, gun owners, former veterans.
[02:33:34.274 --> 02:33:38.377]  And we have the MIAC and Homeland Security reports that law enforcement sent me.
[02:33:38.377 --> 02:33:40.299]  We broke both those last year.
[02:33:40.299 --> 02:33:43.401]  I mean, the point is we're on top of this, okay?
[02:33:43.401 --> 02:33:49.105]  And to even talk about this subject, I can't even give you all the data in one show.
[02:33:49.665 --> 02:33:50.545]  It's so ridiculous.
[02:33:50.545 --> 02:33:54.507]  I called Watson 30 minutes ago, and he's great at boil-down articles.
[02:33:54.507 --> 02:34:02.510]  Nemo has an excellent article just on this latest development at InfoWars.com, where the military's training to take on the Tea Party as terrorists.
[02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:03.531]  We already know that.
[02:34:03.531 --> 02:34:07.552]  They got sound cannons, microwave guns they're rolling out now at events.
[02:34:07.552 --> 02:34:09.993]  They're trying to say we're all racist to demonize us.
[02:34:09.993 --> 02:34:10.894]  That's not working.
[02:34:10.894 --> 02:34:12.715]  They're globalizing the U.S.
[02:34:12.715 --> 02:34:18.457]  They're trying to get rid of our borders, bring in G20 control, value-added taxes, total oppression.
[02:34:19.617 --> 02:34:24.060]  And ladies and gentlemen, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[02:34:24.060 --> 02:34:26.581]  Two hours, 20 plus minutes long, 30 minutes of extras.
[02:34:26.581 --> 02:34:29.763]  When you purchase it, it supports this show.
[02:34:29.763 --> 02:34:31.544]  What's 30 minutes of the two hour film?
[02:34:31.544 --> 02:34:32.925]  It's the G20.
[02:34:32.925 --> 02:34:36.928]  Military snatching and grabbing protesters off the streets, putting them in cars.
[02:34:38.073 --> 02:34:45.085]  Uh, my camera guys go up to the military peacefully and say, we want to interview your public affairs officer.
[02:34:45.085 --> 02:34:46.527]  We have your press release.
[02:34:46.527 --> 02:34:47.769]  And they said, go park over there.
[02:34:47.769 --> 02:34:49.773]  Then they came over and said, we're not going to talk to you.
[02:34:49.773 --> 02:34:50.033]  Leave.
[02:34:51.065 --> 02:35:01.438]  And it was 8 o'clock at night, and then they called the police and said we were trying to blow up the military base, and the police showed up and said, we're going to say you're terrorists.
[02:35:01.438 --> 02:35:03.280]  You ran, you were sneaking around.
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:03.901]  All lies.
[02:35:03.901 --> 02:35:05.983]  So just, out of hand, we're terrorists.
[02:35:05.983 --> 02:35:07.525]  They've all been taught we're the enemy.
[02:35:08.286 --> 02:35:15.972]  They've been taught, and Gerald Cilente thinks they will fire on citizens, that they will do it, especially after the Feds blow up a military base and blame it on us.
[02:35:15.972 --> 02:35:22.777]  And we now have the government blocking Congress's subpoenas on the shooter at Fort Hood.
[02:35:22.777 --> 02:35:24.738]  That was done during a drill.
[02:35:24.738 --> 02:35:36.067]  We know that the Hatari militia thing was a setup, and they had Feds inside provocateuring it to create a news headline that, oh, the militias are about to attack, to coincide with the false flags.
[02:35:36.747 --> 02:35:42.070]  We cover it all in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:45.952]  Get it, make copies of it, give it to everyone you know, air it on AXS TV.
[02:35:45.952 --> 02:35:50.555]  Invisible Empire, No Order Defined, shows you who these criminals are, how they're running these systems.
[02:35:50.555 --> 02:35:52.896]  Two new films, released in the month of April.
[02:35:52.896 --> 02:35:58.699]  Get them, get them out to everybody, InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:35:58.699 --> 02:36:03.682]  Now for military and police, this hour into the next, I want to go back to Dr. Bob Bowman,
[02:36:04.142 --> 02:36:12.972]  Specifically, who've been in these drills, or talked to other officers that were in these drills, with the military, with police, with the feds, totally illegal.
[02:36:12.972 --> 02:36:18.358]  We know the military sent us the document that was later confirmed to be real last year, that Ron Paul events are being watched by the army.
[02:36:19.039 --> 02:36:20.219]  Call into the show.
[02:36:20.219 --> 02:36:21.520]  Call in from a payphone.
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:22.560]  Whatever you want.
[02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:23.760]  Call in.
[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:26.281]  Tell us what is going on.
[02:36:26.281 --> 02:36:31.143]  Give us your concern, or even if you haven't been part of these drills, if you have a concern about this.
[02:36:31.143 --> 02:36:35.824]  How many years have I told you this is being set up for the American people?
[02:36:35.824 --> 02:36:40.906]  We've got to raise the alarm now, and that's what police state for the rise of FEMA does.
[02:36:40.906 --> 02:36:41.846]  You can call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:36:45.247 --> 02:36:49.473]  888-253-3139 or write to me, Alex Jones, P.O.
[02:36:49.473 --> 02:36:52.297]  Box 19549, Austin, TX 78760.
[02:36:52.297 --> 02:36:55.221]  Dr. Bob Bowman has been a huge supporter of Oath Keepers.
[02:36:55.221 --> 02:36:59.787]  Perhaps, Dr. Bowman, you should explain, that guys print me the 10 pledges of Oath Keepers that's on their site.
[02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:17.263]  Let's go over that, and then the organization you've launched, and the speaking tour you've done around the country reaching hundreds of thousands of people, and where this is going, and how people can get involved in thepatriots.us.
[02:37:17.263 --> 02:37:28.073]  Okay, well, we're an organization that is all across the political spectrum, and we want a peaceful revolution to restore the Republic.
[02:37:29.298 --> 02:37:39.961]  The way things are going, they're heading us toward violent revolution, and we don't want that.
[02:37:39.961 --> 02:37:55.085]  So the only way to have a peaceful revolution is to make sure that enough people in the military and law enforcement understand what's at stake, understand what their oath means,
[02:37:55.925 --> 02:38:08.731]  And wind up on our side, the side of the people, not the side of a few crazies in the government that tell them to do something stupid like round us up and throw us in FEMA camps.
[02:38:08.731 --> 02:38:13.053]  So, that's in the short term, but we have to have a long-term solution to
[02:38:15.894 --> 02:38:20.438]  Bring about this peaceful revolution and electoral solution.
[02:38:20.438 --> 02:38:31.448]  And so we're asking all of our chapters to groom candidates to run in both the Democratic and Republican primaries for Congress.
[02:38:31.448 --> 02:38:38.494]  We eventually have to vote out all of the members of Congress that are not on side of the people.
[02:38:38.494 --> 02:38:40.276]  And, you know, the number that
[02:38:40.956 --> 02:38:46.039]  Are on the side of the people and following the Constitution are very few.
[02:38:46.039 --> 02:38:53.204]  I mean, we've got Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, Alan Grayson, you know, just a very few.
[02:38:53.204 --> 02:39:00.809]  But if your particular representative is one of the vast majority that's on the take
[02:39:01.895 --> 02:39:15.283]  And supporting the giant corporations and the global terrorists that want to take over our country, and they're grabbing it now.
[02:39:15.283 --> 02:39:18.225]  If that's the case, then you have to vote them out.
[02:39:18.225 --> 02:39:27.631]  We have to vote out every incumbent that is not one of the handful that is really trying to serve the people.
[02:39:27.631 --> 02:39:31.393]  And to do that, we can no longer just
[02:39:34.488 --> 02:39:42.536]  Go to the polls as Greens or Libertarians or Independents or write-in candidates.
[02:39:42.536 --> 02:39:50.124]  We have to take over the Republican and Democratic parties from within because the system is stacked in their favor.
[02:39:50.124 --> 02:39:52.106]  And so that's what we're trying to do.
[02:39:55.265 --> 02:40:05.251]  Our members of the Patriots, members of our chapters, are going to be running for Congress as Republicans and Democrats.
[02:40:05.251 --> 02:40:09.754]  Hopefully we get a few of them running in 2010 and a lot more in 2012 and see what we can do.
[02:40:17.099 --> 02:40:24.523]  Hold their feet to the fire when we get somebody in and make sure that they don't wind up on the take like everybody else.
[02:40:24.523 --> 02:40:30.386]  And we demand the changes, the real changes that we need in this country.
[02:40:30.386 --> 02:40:37.090]  And there's massive, there's massive, to interrupt, massive grassroots concern and involvement.
[02:40:37.090 --> 02:40:39.191]  People are really getting off the bench now.
[02:40:39.191 --> 02:40:45.094]  And so now is the time for the Campaign for Liberty, for your organization, for Oath Keepers, for everybody.
[02:40:45.834 --> 02:40:55.336]  For the listeners of this broadcast, for We Are Change, for InfoWarriors, to get the word out like the life of this country depends on it, because the global takeover is happening right now.
[02:40:55.336 --> 02:41:06.159]  And I do want to just have you continue, but I wanted to throw this out for military, for police, to get their concern about the fact that they're being openly trained to take on the American people.
[02:41:06.159 --> 02:41:10.240]  Either your concerns or what you've witnessed will cover it all.
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:15.763]  But let me give that toll-free number out to military and police and others only.
[02:41:15.763 --> 02:41:17.204]  The phones are wide open for you.
[02:41:17.204 --> 02:41:17.324]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:41:17.324 --> 02:41:17.625]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:41:17.625 --> 02:41:22.088]  And here's that number again if you're driving along in your squad car or you're on leave and listening.
[02:41:22.088 --> 02:41:22.168]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:41:22.168 --> 02:41:23.769]  Please continue, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[02:41:37.423 --> 02:41:49.479]  Yeah, well, we eventually have to take over the government so that we have a government that follows the Constitution, honors the truth, and serves the people.
[02:41:49.479 --> 02:41:52.623]  Those are essential ingredients of a
[02:41:54.585 --> 02:42:03.214]  Populist government, a government that will be, as Lincoln said, for the people.
[02:42:03.214 --> 02:42:05.136]  And we certainly don't have that now.
[02:42:05.136 --> 02:42:13.145]  We have a government by and for the corporations and the billionaires, and we have to get away from that.
[02:42:16.261 --> 02:42:20.342]  Once we do, then we can demand an end to the corporate wars.
[02:42:20.342 --> 02:42:31.306]  Cut off all the funding, bring our troops home from all the 150, 170, 180 countries they're stationed in around the world.
[02:42:31.306 --> 02:42:35.967]  Give the bases back to the home countries and use our military only
[02:42:36.627 --> 02:42:40.249]  for protecting our borders and our people.
[02:42:40.249 --> 02:42:42.910]  That is their constitutional mission.
[02:42:42.910 --> 02:42:46.032]  That's their only constitutional mission.
[02:42:46.032 --> 02:43:01.860]  And if we make that one change in military policy to eliminate the mission of protecting the global financial interests of multinational corporations, we can greatly enhance our national security.
[02:43:02.412 --> 02:43:03.313]  And let's be clear.
[02:43:22.332 --> 02:43:24.713]  We're not talking about just status quo.
[02:43:24.713 --> 02:43:25.794]  Are people going to stand up?
[02:43:25.794 --> 02:43:26.674]  Are they going to get involved?
[02:43:26.674 --> 02:43:28.315]  Are they going to say no?
[02:43:28.315 --> 02:43:35.178]  Uh, you know, the current corruption, the way tyranny works is it only gets worse and worse until you stop it and then reverse it.
[02:43:35.178 --> 02:43:41.001]  And so we are going down the slippery slope here very, very, very fast right now.
[02:43:41.001 --> 02:43:42.822]  And, and, and the time is up.
[02:43:42.822 --> 02:43:49.905]  I mean, in your educated opinion, former head of Star Wars program, uh, you know, Air Force Colonel, uh, researcher, uh,
[02:43:50.325 --> 02:44:03.459]  Looking at history, looking at what's happening, looking at what the people running our government have done in other nations, do you have any doubt that they're attempting to set up an open, oppressive, hot, despotic system?
[02:44:03.459 --> 02:44:12.388]  By hot, for those that don't know, no longer just a cold, creeping tyranny, but an aggressive, jack-booted, in-your-face tyranny.
[02:44:13.615 --> 02:44:15.936]  Well, they're certainly heading in that direction.
[02:44:15.936 --> 02:44:21.018]  There are elements, and again, I think they're in the minority.
[02:44:21.018 --> 02:44:30.183]  They're certainly a small minority of the population, but unfortunately, they seem to be in the majority in Washington, D.C.
[02:44:33.533 --> 02:44:40.136]  This small minority certainly has control of major elements of our government.
[02:44:40.136 --> 02:44:43.897]  And we need to cut those strings.
[02:44:43.897 --> 02:44:46.118]  We need to get big money out of politics.
[02:44:46.118 --> 02:44:51.560]  We need to take our government back so that it starts serving us again.
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:54.101]  And besides ending
[02:44:55.739 --> 02:44:56.320]  The war is
[02:45:13.436 --> 02:45:16.598]  That have tried to take away our constitutional rights.
[02:45:16.598 --> 02:45:22.003]  And by the way, all of those acts are unconstitutional.
[02:45:22.003 --> 02:45:30.089]  Congress does not have the power to take away the rights that are given us in the first 10 amendments, the Bill of Rights.
[02:45:30.089 --> 02:45:32.651]  They can't take those away by just passing the law.
[02:45:33.331 --> 02:45:37.397]  They have to pass an amendment to the Constitution, get it ratified by the states.
[02:45:37.397 --> 02:45:40.862]  Of course, that hasn't happened and that won't happen.
[02:45:40.862 --> 02:45:43.346]  So we don't have to follow the Patriot Act.
[02:45:43.346 --> 02:45:45.949]  We don't have to follow the Military Commissions Act.
[02:45:45.949 --> 02:45:48.133]  Those things are totally unconstitutional.
[02:45:49.542 --> 02:45:53.465]  All right, Dr. Bob Bowman, I was about to go to some calls.
[02:45:53.465 --> 02:45:56.928]  We had some concerned military people on the line and they hung up.
[02:45:56.928 --> 02:46:05.995]  Again, we can always load the phones with the people on any issue, except sometimes I specifically want certain people to be able to call in.
[02:46:05.995 --> 02:46:10.339]  Former military that's concerned, current military, people that have been involved in these drills.
[02:46:11.019 --> 02:46:12.541]  For those that just joined us, U.S.
[02:46:12.541 --> 02:46:17.527]  military is training with police nationwide to take on the Tea Parties.
[02:46:17.527 --> 02:46:23.874]  They're brainwashing police that the Tea Parties and returning veterans are going to attack them with guns.
[02:46:23.874 --> 02:46:25.676]  And they're claiming that we're white supremacists.
[02:46:25.676 --> 02:46:27.358]  It's all mixed in.
[02:46:27.358 --> 02:46:29.140]  And the military did leak these documents.
[02:46:29.140 --> 02:46:30.963]  The military admits they were doing these drills.
[02:46:31.403 --> 02:46:37.585]  So the good news is the military is concerned and is leaking these, but I want to get people's take on this.
[02:46:37.585 --> 02:46:38.665]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:46:38.665 --> 02:46:52.249]  I mean, don't tell me that our military and our police are so cowed listening out there that you're so afraid of the NSA that you're not going to call in and tell us your concern.
[02:46:52.249 --> 02:46:56.530]  The government's main focus in the real drills and preparation
[02:46:57.310 --> 02:47:01.414]  Isn't just for the American people and Tea Party folks and in the fetters.
[02:47:01.414 --> 02:47:04.796]  It is for gun-owning veterans who have military training.
[02:47:04.796 --> 02:47:08.559]  That is in both the drills held the 23rd and 26th.
[02:47:08.559 --> 02:47:09.200]  Okay?
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:15.405]  And this is part of NLEO 10 going on, where NLEO 9 admitted they're using foreign assets in the drills.
[02:47:15.405 --> 02:47:16.226]  Foreign troops.
[02:47:16.946 --> 02:47:18.789]  In these drills to go up against you.
[02:47:18.789 --> 02:47:20.451]  This is the high treason.
[02:47:20.451 --> 02:47:23.295]  This is serious what's going on all over the country.
[02:47:23.295 --> 02:47:25.177]  That's what the state's terror attacks are about.
[02:47:25.177 --> 02:47:26.979]  That's what this whole system is about.
[02:47:26.979 --> 02:47:30.604]  And we've got mainstream media claiming the Oath Keepers are treasonous.
[02:47:31.508 --> 02:47:34.490]  This is fully disgusting.
[02:47:34.490 --> 02:47:36.532]  I mean, this is absolutely disgusting.
[02:47:36.532 --> 02:47:38.413]  Let me just read what Oathkeeper stands for.
[02:47:38.413 --> 02:47:41.155]  We will not obey any order to disarm the American people.
[02:47:41.155 --> 02:47:50.322]  We will not obey any order to conduct warrantless searches of the American people, their homes, vehicles, papers, and effects, such as warrantless house-to-house searches for weapons, as you saw in Louisiana.
[02:47:50.322 --> 02:47:56.367]  Number three, we will not obey any order to detain American citizens as unlawful enemy combatants or to subject them to trial by military tribunal.
[02:47:57.810 --> 02:48:08.578]  We will not obey orders to impose martial law or state of emergency on a state or to enter by force into a state without the express consent of the invitation of the state's legislator or governor.
[02:48:08.578 --> 02:48:11.301]  What's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act?
[02:48:11.301 --> 02:48:14.143]  It talks about putting down governors.
[02:48:14.143 --> 02:48:16.585]  See the state saying no now to government takeover?
[02:48:18.137 --> 02:48:27.422]  Number five, we will not obey orders to invade and subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty and declares national government to be in violation of the compact to which the state entered the Union.
[02:48:27.422 --> 02:48:32.765]  Number six, we will not obey any order to blockade American cities, thus turning them into giant concentration camps.
[02:48:32.765 --> 02:48:43.932]  Seven, we will not obey any order to force... and what just... cops just got convicted under federal orders last month from, what, four or five years ago in New Orleans, shooting people trying to walk out on the highways.
[02:48:44.974 --> 02:48:45.575]  Remember that?
[02:48:45.575 --> 02:48:46.415]  Shooting them!
[02:48:46.415 --> 02:48:48.517]  Just mowing people down!
[02:48:48.517 --> 02:48:49.358]  Unarmed people!
[02:48:49.358 --> 02:48:54.282]  We will not obey any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext.
[02:48:54.282 --> 02:48:58.206]  Number right, we will not obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S.
[02:48:58.206 --> 02:49:03.650]  soil against the American people to keep the peace or to maintain control during an emergency or under any other pretext.
[02:49:03.650 --> 02:49:07.534]  As Henry Kissinger said, during stage crises they could bring in U.N.
[02:49:07.534 --> 02:49:08.174]  troops.
[02:49:08.174 --> 02:49:10.777]  We will consider any such use of foreign troops against the American people
[02:49:11.932 --> 02:49:13.492]  As an invasion and an act of war.
[02:49:13.492 --> 02:49:20.494]  Number nine, we will not obey any orders to confiscate the property of the American people, including food and other essential supplies under any emergency pretext whatsoever.
[02:49:20.494 --> 02:49:29.136]  Number ten, we will not obey any orders which infringe upon the right of the people to free speech, to peaceably assemble, and to petition their government for redress of grievances.
[02:49:29.136 --> 02:49:30.596]  How is this treason?
[02:49:30.596 --> 02:49:35.017]  Anybody that violates this is involved in treason, doctor.
[02:49:35.017 --> 02:49:37.518]  And I keep wanting
[02:49:38.516 --> 02:49:52.928]  The oath keepers to add one more to that and that's to promise not to follow any order to participate in a war of aggression.
[02:49:52.928 --> 02:49:57.612]  But again, I mean you swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:49:59.839 --> 02:50:05.550]  I mean, reading that, reading the oath, it goes further than Oath Keepers.
[02:50:05.550 --> 02:50:10.338]  And I've read old army handbooks from 50 years ago that were more clear than this.
[02:50:10.338 --> 02:50:12.883]  But now this is treason to actually be a patriot.
[02:50:14.534 --> 02:50:17.515]  Yeah, they're trying to turn things all the way around.
[02:50:17.515 --> 02:50:20.695]  That's why I've called my organization the Patriots.
[02:50:20.695 --> 02:50:36.878]  We need to take that back, make it a good word again, and make people understand that we who are protecting the people of the United States are the Patriots, and those who are trying to subdue us are the traitors.
[02:50:36.878 --> 02:50:38.199]  Dr. Bob Bowman, stay there.
[02:50:38.199 --> 02:50:39.919]  I'll talk about more of what you're doing at
[02:50:41.445 --> 02:50:52.712]  Your website, your book, your materials, your newsletter on the other side, and we do have some people calling in now, Roger, Tom, and a lot of others.
[02:50:52.712 --> 02:50:59.315]  Folks, they are quietly training everywhere to take us on, and they're gonna stage terror attacks to do it.
[02:50:59.315 --> 02:51:01.296]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.296 --> 02:51:05.219]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:05.219 --> 02:51:09.021]  My name is Span, and I'm 68 years old, and I live in Vermont.
[02:51:09.403 --> 02:51:14.144]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[02:51:14.144 --> 02:51:16.224]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[02:51:16.224 --> 02:51:17.945]  Made me feel breathless.
[02:51:17.945 --> 02:51:22.386]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[02:51:22.386 --> 02:51:23.446]  Nothing did anything.
[02:51:23.446 --> 02:51:27.447]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[02:51:27.447 --> 02:51:31.567]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:31.567 --> 02:51:34.208]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[02:51:34.662 --> 02:51:39.663]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.
[02:51:39.663 --> 02:51:42.484]  Usually you find a 30-day or 60-day guarantee.

[02:52:01.022 --> 02:52:03.323]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.323 --> 02:52:05.724]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.724 --> 02:52:08.926]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.926 --> 02:52:14.048]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.048 --> 02:52:18.230]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:20.893]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.893 --> 02:52:23.436]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.436 --> 02:52:26.699]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.699 --> 02:52:34.308]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.628 --> 02:52:40.030]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.030 --> 02:52:42.871]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.871 --> 02:52:46.553]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.553 --> 02:52:47.633]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.633 --> 02:52:48.974]  You're everyone else.

[02:54:03.973 --> 02:54:05.314]  Veterans!
[02:54:05.314 --> 02:54:09.138]  We have scores of secret and declassified and leaked government documents.
[02:54:09.138 --> 02:54:11.000]  We have new ones today.
[02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:14.764]  They are training against veterans.
[02:54:14.764 --> 02:54:18.148]  They are saying you're terrorists that are going to attack.
[02:54:18.148 --> 02:54:19.329]  This is outrageous.
[02:54:19.329 --> 02:54:21.471]  This is what the Soviets did when they took over.
[02:54:21.471 --> 02:54:22.312]  It's what Hitler did.
[02:54:22.312 --> 02:54:26.316]  He went and rounded up former military people that had been critical.
[02:54:27.085 --> 02:54:29.107]  I mean, this is happening in America.
[02:54:29.107 --> 02:54:30.829]  The banks have stolen trillions.
[02:54:30.829 --> 02:54:32.131]  They're setting up a police state.
[02:54:32.131 --> 02:54:34.433]  Your kids are herded through naked body scanners.
[02:54:34.433 --> 02:54:41.060]  School-issued laptops are watching kids 56,000 times at one school district and saying they're allowed to.
[02:54:41.060 --> 02:54:42.101]  I mean, this is hellish.
[02:54:42.101 --> 02:54:42.982]  And Dr. Bob Bowman
[02:54:43.743 --> 02:54:45.624]  Yes Alex, I worked on a couple military bases 10 years ago, pre 9-11.
[02:54:45.624 --> 02:54:48.046]  They were a live round training base, combined arms tactical training.
[02:55:14.165 --> 02:55:18.888]  And basically what it was, 100 acre site, 60 buildings, replica of a U.S.
[02:55:18.888 --> 02:55:19.608]  city.
[02:55:19.608 --> 02:55:27.853]  Every building, like municipal hall, city hall, townhouse, residential housing, hotel.
[02:55:27.853 --> 02:55:29.574]  And it was basically the structures.
[02:55:29.574 --> 02:55:32.355]  And it was for ranger training for the Army to go through.
[02:55:32.355 --> 02:55:36.818]  At the time, you know, I wasn't really still watching TV and so on, not aware.
[02:55:36.818 --> 02:55:42.721]  And I was kind of taken aback because I expected to see a Middle Eastern, you know, like Middle Eastern town.
[02:55:43.456 --> 02:55:43.937]  I don't know.
[02:55:48.499 --> 02:55:55.143]  The context I dealt with told me it's because of the Oklahoma City that it was a deal with domestic troops.
[02:55:55.143 --> 02:56:04.190]  Yeah, we've got footage from three drills they did in the late 90s in Louisiana where they admitted it was for the American people and they had foreign troops drilling to do it.
[02:56:04.190 --> 02:56:08.873]  So they told you ten years ago this was for domestic groups.
[02:56:08.873 --> 02:56:13.916]  Exactly, and they cited the Oklahoma as one.
[02:56:13.916 --> 02:56:16.177]  Now was this drilling for the U.S.
[02:56:16.177 --> 02:56:17.578]  and was this with U.S.
[02:56:17.578 --> 02:56:17.879]  troops?
[02:56:18.599 --> 02:56:21.922]  Yeah, it was a Rangers base in the northwest.
[02:56:21.922 --> 02:56:22.983]  There was one in Alaska.
[02:56:22.983 --> 02:56:25.365]  I think a couple in the southern states as well.
[02:56:25.365 --> 02:56:27.167]  There was about six that were out at the time.
[02:56:27.167 --> 02:56:30.290]  Well, last year I had an Army colonel on that was in the newspaper.
[02:56:30.290 --> 02:56:33.292]  We're doing door-to-door gun confiscation drills.
[02:56:33.292 --> 02:56:35.394]  And then I had the colonel on and he admitted it.
[02:56:35.394 --> 02:56:38.917]  That's in Police State, The Rise of FEMA, the new film.
[02:56:38.917 --> 02:56:39.858]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:39.858 --> 02:56:45.203]  Dr. Bob Bowman, this has been going on a long time, but I see it really accelerating and coming to a head.
[02:56:46.499 --> 02:56:47.920]  Yeah, right on.
[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:49.741]  Let's get another one of your callers.
[02:56:49.741 --> 02:56:53.923]  All right, let's talk to Roger in Missouri, former military, about drills.
[02:56:53.923 --> 02:56:55.924]  Go ahead.
[02:56:55.924 --> 02:57:00.367]  Yes, this has been going on for a long, long time.
[02:57:00.367 --> 02:57:10.773]  Memorial Day of 1973, I was stationed at Camp Pelham in California, and the Black Panthers was going to march on Camp Pelham.
[02:57:10.773 --> 02:57:15.696]  The commander in general actually came out, secured liberty for everybody on the base,
[02:57:16.739 --> 02:57:26.205]  Uh, bought Recon out, put 30-caliber machine guns out, and they drew a line, and they told the Black Panthers, you go across that line, we're gonna kill you.
[02:57:26.205 --> 02:57:39.333]  Then, after that, uh, they started, they, uh, transformed the Vietnam Training Village into what would look like, uh, just a regular United States street.
[02:57:39.333 --> 02:57:44.296]  And, uh, told us that, uh, of course that was during the Nixon administration when they
[02:57:45.525 --> 02:57:53.530]  Uh, Watergate was going on that we would probably be attacked by, uh, armed citizens.
[02:57:53.530 --> 02:58:12.340]  Uh, also, uh, just four years ago, uh, I belong to the Marine Corps League and the local police and sheriff's department came and asked us if we'd get SERT trained, uh, to help out in administrative duties and, and, uh, uh, rescue during, uh,
[02:58:13.073 --> 02:58:13.733]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:58:13.733 --> 02:58:14.554]  That's what they do.
[02:58:14.554 --> 02:58:16.214]  They get you there for one reason, then bait and switch.
[02:58:16.214 --> 02:58:16.654]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.223 --> 02:58:45.825]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:00:08.937 --> 03:00:11.719]  Dr. Bob Bowman with us in the final segment.
[03:00:11.719 --> 03:00:14.120]  Air Force Colonel, former head of the Star Wars program.
[03:00:14.120 --> 03:00:19.023]  He's been warning about the military being trained to engage in martial law operations.
[03:00:19.023 --> 03:00:25.847]  We have more secret Army documents confirmed by major newspapers to be authentic, leaked by patriots.
[03:00:25.847 --> 03:00:26.207]  U.S.
[03:00:26.207 --> 03:00:29.449]  Army trains to confront Tea Party terrorists.
[03:00:29.969 --> 03:00:38.054]  Military personnel blow the whistle on exercise which involved troops taking protesters to concentration camps.
[03:00:38.054 --> 03:00:40.256]  This is the updated, beefed article.
[03:00:40.256 --> 03:00:41.717]  Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo.
[03:00:41.717 --> 03:00:45.660]  Kurt Nemo, of course, broke this at Infowars.com.
[03:00:45.660 --> 03:00:46.600]  And it continues.
[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:48.742]  Kurt Nemo, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:00:48.742 --> 03:00:51.443]  The key article is at PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:00:51.443 --> 03:00:53.545]  This just went up minutes ago.
[03:00:53.545 --> 03:00:55.966]  It's got all the documents you need.
[03:00:55.966 --> 03:00:59.589]  We've got other news coming up in the last half hour on population reduction.
[03:01:01.370 --> 03:01:03.832]  So, we'll be discussing that.
[03:01:03.832 --> 03:01:15.102]  We're about to go back to the caller, and even after Dr. Bob Bowman leaves us, I will continue with military veterans and others who've been through these drills to take on the American people.
[03:01:15.102 --> 03:01:24.030]  We're going back to Roger here in a moment, but Dr. Bowman, before we run out of time, people can get your newsletter, they can learn more at your website.
[03:01:24.030 --> 03:01:26.152]  You also have a book out that's very informative.
[03:01:26.152 --> 03:01:26.813]  Tell us about that.
[03:01:29.758 --> 03:01:30.078]  Thank you.
[03:01:47.655 --> 03:01:51.498]  You can do that through our website, through PayPal, or mail us a check.
[03:01:51.498 --> 03:01:59.685]  And make sure you include your email address so that we can email you a copy of the book.
[03:01:59.685 --> 03:02:03.248]  And so you won't need to wait until we find a publisher.
[03:02:03.248 --> 03:02:04.629]  And give folks the title again.
[03:02:05.791 --> 03:02:09.656]  A populist vision for America.
[03:02:09.656 --> 03:02:10.136]  Absolutely.
[03:02:10.136 --> 03:02:23.072]  And in there are not only the problems that we face but the proposals we have for solving those problems and what we can do to take our country back.
[03:02:23.072 --> 03:02:24.774]  And give folks the website one more time.
[03:02:25.834 --> 03:02:32.757]  ThePatriots.us Patriots with an S. We don't stand together, we all hang separate.
[03:02:32.757 --> 03:02:49.284]  Now, for those that just joined us, Roger was talking about decades ago doing drills to take on the American people, and then he was part of the Marine Corps League, and I've seen this in the news in major papers the last two months, we've got to add that, where they are training former veterans to take on
[03:02:49.804 --> 03:02:52.645]  Yeah, as I was saying, we went to a regional airport for a terrorist drill
[03:03:20.354 --> 03:03:28.460]  And after we got right in the middle of it, they announced that these terrorists were militia.
[03:03:28.460 --> 03:03:30.181]  American militia.
[03:03:30.181 --> 03:03:36.365]  And soon after that, me and a few other guys resigned from the Marine Corps League.
[03:03:36.365 --> 03:03:40.188]  And I also had been blacklisted from the Marine Corps League and the VFW.
[03:03:40.188 --> 03:03:49.695]  And I find, and I'm sorry to say this, but the World War II guys, the Korean veterans and the early Vietnam veterans,
[03:03:50.487 --> 03:03:55.410]  are so brainwashed that you cannot reason with them.
[03:03:55.410 --> 03:04:00.793]  They cannot believe that their country would do things to them.
[03:04:00.793 --> 03:04:03.455]  I try to reach out to them, but there's just really no conversation.
[03:04:03.455 --> 03:04:04.876]  I'll tell you what, Roger, stay there.
[03:04:04.876 --> 03:04:06.376]  We're going to let Dr. Bob Bowman go.
[03:04:06.376 --> 03:04:07.797]  We appreciate him being gracious.
[03:04:07.797 --> 03:04:16.002]  I'm going to come back and I want you to explain this because it's on record for decades, but now it's accelerating that they're training the military to take the American people on.
[03:04:17.463 --> 03:04:21.945]  I want to discuss this and go to more veterans and more military people that are calling in right now.
[03:04:21.945 --> 03:04:31.509]  Dr. Bob Bowman, I wanted to get you on also about the secret space plane blast-off and what you think was going on there, but we'll talk to you again in the near future.
[03:04:31.509 --> 03:04:34.350]  We've been so honored to have you spend this time with us today, sir.
[03:04:35.612 --> 03:04:38.533]  Well, thank you, and keep at it, Alex.
[03:04:38.533 --> 03:04:38.993]  We'll try.
[03:04:38.993 --> 03:04:40.073]  I was going to get into other subjects.
[03:04:40.073 --> 03:04:41.013]  I'm sorry this broke.
[03:04:41.013 --> 03:04:45.935]  We've got to warn the people, but we couldn't have a better guest than you here, because you've been warning about this so intensely.
[03:04:45.935 --> 03:04:47.055]  Thank you, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[03:04:47.055 --> 03:04:54.557]  Roger, Tom, Brian, Chad, Carl, we're going to go to you after this break.
[03:04:54.557 --> 03:04:57.958]  Former military, current military, police have been part of these drills.
[03:04:57.958 --> 03:04:58.898]  Your call straight ahead.
[03:05:01.650 --> 03:05:04.671]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.671 --> 03:05:09.992]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.992 --> 03:05:12.033]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.033 --> 03:05:17.034]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.034 --> 03:05:18.215]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.215 --> 03:05:18.955]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.355 --> 03:05:21.236]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.236 --> 03:05:22.297]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.297 --> 03:05:24.499]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.499 --> 03:05:25.840]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.840 --> 03:05:27.381]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.381 --> 03:05:32.645]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.645 --> 03:05:35.767]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.227 --> 03:05:40.049]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.049 --> 03:05:41.270]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.270 --> 03:05:42.170]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.170 --> 03:05:43.271]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.271 --> 03:05:44.211]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.211 --> 03:05:45.312]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.312 --> 03:05:48.353]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.353 --> 03:05:50.114]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.114 --> 03:05:51.034]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.762 --> 03:06:02.082]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.082 --> 03:06:07.664]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:06:07.664 --> 03:06:12.686]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:06:12.686 --> 03:06:17.708]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:06:18.248 --> 03:06:23.472]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:06:23.472 --> 03:06:25.793]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:06:25.793 --> 03:06:30.596]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:06:30.596 --> 03:06:31.717]  And here's the best part.
[03:06:31.717 --> 03:06:34.779]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:06:34.779 --> 03:06:38.402]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:06:38.402 --> 03:06:41.584]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:06:41.584 --> 03:06:43.825]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:06:43.825 --> 03:06:44.746]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:06:48.708 --> 03:06:52.610]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:06:52.610 --> 03:06:57.433]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:06:57.433 --> 03:06:59.834]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:02.298 --> 03:07:06.259]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:07:06.259 --> 03:07:15.121]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:07:15.121 --> 03:07:19.762]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:07:19.762 --> 03:07:30.564]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:07:31.204 --> 03:07:40.726]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:07:40.726 --> 03:07:46.148]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:07:46.148 --> 03:07:53.629]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:07:53.629 --> 03:07:56.390]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:08:02.657 --> 03:08:05.424]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:05.424 --> 03:08:08.231]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:10.556 --> 03:08:15.419]  All over the country for decades, I've interviewed Marine Corps captains.
[03:08:15.419 --> 03:08:17.881]  I've interviewed generals.
[03:08:17.881 --> 03:08:23.305]  I've talked to high-level former and current Pentagon people many, many times.
[03:08:23.305 --> 03:08:39.976]  Federal marshals, state police gave us the MIAC Homeland Security documents over a year ago saying the number one threat, the government says, is gun owners, returning veterans, conservatives, people that have American flags on their cars, and that we're going to attack law enforcement, military, and IRS buildings.
[03:08:40.676 --> 03:08:45.418]  Then they bust a few militias that they set up to create the illusion that it's all about to happen.
[03:08:45.418 --> 03:08:52.522]  Bill Clinton comes out and says, gee, I hope the Tea Party shut up or it's going to cause somebody to blow up a federal building again.
[03:08:52.522 --> 03:09:00.305]  And we then have all the eyewitnesses and people that were at the Alfred P. Murrow building with McVeigh and feds in there, planting gray sticks of butter and they didn't know what it was.
[03:09:00.305 --> 03:09:03.347]  I mean, this is, I've interviewed the foreman of the grand jury!
[03:09:04.207 --> 03:09:05.328]  Poppy Heidelberg!
[03:09:05.328 --> 03:09:08.930]  The FBI came to his house with guns and said, shut up!
[03:09:08.930 --> 03:09:10.451]  Stop talking about it!
[03:09:10.451 --> 03:09:15.355]  They killed Cop of the Year, who was a witness, and saved a bunch of people because he saw it.
[03:09:15.355 --> 03:09:18.137]  I mean, they're not playing games here.
[03:09:18.137 --> 03:09:19.618]  This is not a radio show.
[03:09:19.618 --> 03:09:20.678]  It's not entertainment.
[03:09:20.678 --> 03:09:22.760]  It's not Alex Jones having fun.
[03:09:22.760 --> 03:09:24.101]  I'm exhausted.
[03:09:24.101 --> 03:09:25.062]  All I think about is...
[03:09:26.058 --> 03:09:30.046]  Spending time with my family, but I was going to go home today and take my kids to the park.
[03:09:30.046 --> 03:09:30.948]  I'm not even doing that now.
[03:09:30.948 --> 03:09:34.476]  I'm going to stay here and put out an emergency video trying to warn people.
[03:09:37.351 --> 03:09:39.212]  We've got criminal offshore banks.
[03:09:39.212 --> 03:09:49.162]  I played the CFR speech, the head of the European Central Bank saying we have worked for world government, we are now establishing it, the taxes will be paid directly to the banks.
[03:09:49.162 --> 03:09:50.663]  Ha ha ha!
[03:09:50.663 --> 03:09:51.504]  World government!
[03:09:51.504 --> 03:09:57.609]  And then I had Nightline here two days ago laughing at me when I was playing them world government clips.
[03:09:58.550 --> 03:10:01.151]  Saying, well, that's not what they mean.
[03:10:01.151 --> 03:10:04.952]  They've stole 28 trill plus in the last year and a half.
[03:10:04.952 --> 03:10:06.872]  They're taking over everything.
[03:10:06.872 --> 03:10:11.493]  They're openly in the news saying they're going to take your pension funds.
[03:10:11.493 --> 03:10:17.555]  All right, I'm going to try to shut up and I'm going to try to go to these veterans and police and others that are on hold here.
[03:10:18.986 --> 03:10:21.350]  Uh, and, and we've got an active duty folks, Chris.
[03:10:21.350 --> 03:10:24.554]  I'm gonna try to get to everybody, but it's so touching.
[03:10:24.554 --> 03:10:27.438]  Uh, and I've got so many of these callers now, I can't even keep track of them.
[03:10:27.438 --> 03:10:28.780]  Who was the caller I've been talking to?
[03:10:28.780 --> 03:10:31.484]  Um, yeah, yeah, Roger.
[03:10:31.484 --> 03:10:34.328]  And everything Roger's saying I've actually seen in separate documents.
[03:10:35.306 --> 03:10:44.317]  Rex84 training to use the military, FEMA camps, the Emergency Centers Act, the top-off two drills, NLEO-9, NLEO-10.
[03:10:44.317 --> 03:10:53.688]  I mean, the military sent it to us and to others last year that in the Fed rallies with Ron Paul and others,
[03:10:54.790 --> 03:10:55.491]  Myself.
[03:10:55.491 --> 03:10:57.773]  It specifically mentioned Texas and Dallas.
[03:10:57.773 --> 03:10:59.834]  When I was there, you see it in the Obama Deception.
[03:10:59.834 --> 03:11:03.758]  Bullhorning the Federal Reserve, talking about how they're a banking dictatorship.
[03:11:03.758 --> 03:11:08.262]  Army, regular army was there, and they said, don't let them know you're army.
[03:11:08.262 --> 03:11:10.363]  They may be terrorists and may kill you.
[03:11:10.363 --> 03:11:12.465]  They teach the military.
[03:11:12.465 --> 03:11:18.550]  And there's all these great Americans of all races, you know, religions out there calling for sovereignty.
[03:11:18.550 --> 03:11:19.851]  And there was army there.
[03:11:20.732 --> 03:11:27.317]  And being told that we would kill them, or may kill them, if they told us they were military.
[03:11:27.317 --> 03:11:30.160]  Now folks, that is brainwashing.
[03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:36.085]  And when you read these documents, and the latest, this comes out of the Carrier Journal.
[03:11:36.085 --> 03:11:38.627]  This comes out of Carrier Journal, Louisville, Kentucky.
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:42.503]  And then we've got it at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:11:42.503 --> 03:11:43.584]  They just report it dryly.
[03:11:43.584 --> 03:11:49.590]  It's like that Ithaca newspaper in New York talking about martial law.
[03:11:49.590 --> 03:11:58.819]  You've got in Illinois, you've got in California, you've got in New York State the last three months, from Schenectady to you name it.
[03:11:58.819 --> 03:11:59.940]  In fact, that was in the news.
[03:11:59.940 --> 03:12:00.761]  Here it is right here!
[03:12:01.241 --> 03:12:04.083]  Here it is right here, Chicago Tribune.
[03:12:04.083 --> 03:12:06.984]  Two Chicago state reps say bring in National Guard.
[03:12:06.984 --> 03:12:13.608]  Blagojevich a year ago, before he got disgraced, said we're going to use National Guard for gun confiscation door-to-door.
[03:12:13.608 --> 03:12:15.389]  I played his press conference.
[03:12:15.389 --> 03:12:16.489]  I mean, look at New Orleans.
[03:12:16.489 --> 03:12:19.731]  They went in the high and dry areas and took everybody's guns.
[03:12:19.731 --> 03:12:21.492]  And the people are still in denial about that.
[03:12:23.283 --> 03:12:36.366]  I mean, folks, do you understand that they are trying to warp the brains of the troops, they're telling them that the American conservatives and libertarians are going to kill them, and they're going to stage events to make that a real occurrence, so they can use them against us.
[03:12:36.366 --> 03:12:47.808]  And we were talking to Roger, and then I'm going to everybody else, and Roger, if you just joined us, was talking about, he tried to, he was in the Marine Corps League, they took him out to an airport, and I've been at airport drills in Brooksville, Florida.
[03:12:48.368 --> 03:12:54.816]  They had feds jumping out of the bushes trying to light things on fire and blaming on me.
[03:12:54.816 --> 03:13:00.082]  We've got video of me in the neighborhood where they were doing military drills and women coming out saying, are you Alex Jones?
[03:13:00.082 --> 03:13:04.026]  I was told not to talk to you by the army, by special forces!
[03:13:04.907 --> 03:13:13.473]  And special forces guys in plain clothes, you heard Mike Hanson on air with us, just jumping out of the bushes at night, lighting fires, and I'm like running over, stopping them.
[03:13:13.473 --> 03:13:13.833]  No!
[03:13:13.833 --> 03:13:14.954]  No, don't blame me!
[03:13:14.954 --> 03:13:18.116]  I mean, this is what I live, this is what I do.
[03:13:18.116 --> 03:13:20.938]  Folks, I've had special forces in plain clothes.
[03:13:21.638 --> 03:13:22.179]  We're good to go.
[03:13:41.899 --> 03:13:42.940]  Is veterans!
[03:13:42.940 --> 03:13:45.943]  Don't you understand how treasonous this is?
[03:13:45.943 --> 03:13:50.728]  Because veterans are good people, police are good people on average, and they understand.
[03:13:50.728 --> 03:13:56.954]  And they saw the feds demonize us patriots and call us kooks for talking about a new world order for decades.
[03:13:56.954 --> 03:13:59.196]  And now they've seen it all come true, and they're waking up.
[03:13:59.196 --> 03:14:00.638]  Okay, okay, I'm gonna shut up.
[03:14:01.218 --> 03:14:02.819]  It's just, it's just, this is so real.
[03:14:02.819 --> 03:14:04.561]  This doesn't have to happen.
[03:14:04.561 --> 03:14:07.263]  The country doesn't have to fall to tyranny.
[03:14:07.263 --> 03:14:17.291]  Finish up what you were saying, Roger, in Missouri, about just a few years ago, they get the Marine Corps League out to aid the military at a base, and they say, we're not fighting foreign terrorists, we're getting ready for militia.
[03:14:17.291 --> 03:14:18.492]  Go ahead.
[03:14:18.492 --> 03:14:30.062]  Yes, like I said, me and a few others eventually resigned over things like that, but there's one good thing, Alex, especially our governor, Jay Nixon, here in Missouri,
[03:14:30.683 --> 03:14:37.869]  Probably woke more veterans up than any of us could by putting out that Mike report.
[03:14:37.869 --> 03:14:49.139]  Seriously, I don't think he'll get reelected because four years ago, people just like you, they called me a nut.
[03:14:49.139 --> 03:14:54.743]  And they don't do it very loudly, but I've had many of them come to me and say, you were right.
[03:14:54.743 --> 03:14:55.304]  You were right.
[03:14:56.303 --> 03:14:58.724]  So we're winning.
[03:14:58.724 --> 03:14:59.405]  Hang in there.
[03:14:59.405 --> 03:15:00.625]  Bet they're showing their hand.
[03:15:11.840 --> 03:15:21.369]  They need to understand that the government is going to come for the guns, and they better understand our country's been taken over by foreign banks, and that's why this is not our government.
[03:15:21.369 --> 03:15:25.673]  These guys out there that say this can't happen here, it is happening here.
[03:15:25.673 --> 03:15:27.154]  It is, and it's accelerating.
[03:15:27.154 --> 03:15:29.276]  God bless you, I appreciate your call, Roger.
[03:15:29.276 --> 03:15:36.022]  Okay, there's a lot of military calls here, and I'm going to go to Brian, Carl, Chris,
[03:15:38.291 --> 03:15:39.832]  Just a bunch of other people.
[03:15:39.832 --> 03:15:42.415]  But Chris is in Tennessee, active military.
[03:15:42.415 --> 03:15:44.957]  This is in Police State 4, we interviewed the state rep.
[03:15:44.957 --> 03:15:46.578]  Remember last year?
[03:15:46.578 --> 03:15:55.246]  There were suddenly regular army with Marine Corps checkpoints with Homeland Security shutting down highways, and the governor said don't do it, and they still did it?
[03:15:55.246 --> 03:15:57.748]  And it was on the local news?
[03:15:57.748 --> 03:16:00.751]  So maybe he's gonna call in about that.
[03:16:00.751 --> 03:16:03.273]  Let's go ahead and go to Chris in Tennessee, active duty.
[03:16:03.273 --> 03:16:04.154]  Chris, what can you tell us?
[03:16:05.117 --> 03:16:08.201]  Hi Alex, I've been a listener for about five years.
[03:16:08.201 --> 03:16:10.845]  I'm also part of Vote Keepers and We Are Change Memphis.
[03:16:10.845 --> 03:16:18.295]  I was actually stationed in Florida when that happened and I personally haven't participated in any of those types of shows.
[03:16:18.295 --> 03:16:20.238]  Wait a minute, you were in Florida when I was there?
[03:16:21.602 --> 03:16:27.865]  I was in Florida, I was stationed in Florida when they did the martial law checkpoint in Tennessee with the governor.
[03:16:27.865 --> 03:16:28.705]  Okay, go ahead.
[03:16:28.705 --> 03:16:35.328]  I thought when I went to cover the Brooksville drill to take over the town and they had feds running around trying to frame me, but go ahead.
[03:16:36.791 --> 03:16:38.292]  My brother is also in the Army.
[03:16:38.292 --> 03:16:51.842]  He's part of the 3rd Brigade in Fort Stewart, Georgia, which he's not part of the 1st Infantry, but the 1st Infantry is the unit that is deployed in the United States for, you know, the civil unrest.
[03:16:51.842 --> 03:16:54.444]  Yeah, that's the 1st Cohort.
[03:16:54.444 --> 03:17:05.632]  1st Spear Centurion Group is basically what it is that forms the heart of the 400,000 group that they're building, according to Army Times, to occupy the U.S.
[03:17:06.559 --> 03:17:07.359]  Right.
[03:17:07.359 --> 03:17:23.005]  And last time I visited him, I talked to... I actually posted this story on the Prison Planet forums, but I talked to some of his neighbors and stuff on the base that are part of the 1st Infantry, and they confirmed that they are indeed trained in implementing martial law.
[03:17:23.005 --> 03:17:34.190]  And one of the guys, actually his neighbor, was telling me he flies the UAVs for the surveillance ones, and he says he spies on civilians on a daily basis, just randomly.
[03:17:35.730 --> 03:17:48.815]  I had a Marine Corps source come to AXS TV in 99, two weeks after I was at Urban Warrior with the Marines landing and taking over a part of Oakland, and I had him come and say, you can see this, but you can't have it.
[03:17:48.815 --> 03:17:53.156]  And it was UAVs watching us flying around.
[03:17:53.156 --> 03:17:59.078]  We were getting out of the hotel, getting out of our car, going Death Star One, Death Star One, we've got the militia terrorist in our sights.
[03:17:59.078 --> 03:18:03.159]  And again, I wasn't allowed to show the public that because then it would have gone back to whoever supposedly did it.
[03:18:03.159 --> 03:18:04.600]  But I'm sorry, just go ahead.
[03:18:05.856 --> 03:18:07.077]  It's not surprising.
[03:18:07.077 --> 03:18:11.119]  I did want to say there are a lot of people in the military that are waking up.
[03:18:11.119 --> 03:18:17.162]  Where I'm stationed, the officers, my bosses, they're not completely awake, but they're getting there.
[03:18:17.162 --> 03:18:25.747]  I've woke up a lot of people in the military, and I think they're going to have a hard time implementing martial law short of bringing in foreign troops.
[03:18:26.812 --> 03:18:28.192]  Well, let me go back here.
[03:18:28.192 --> 03:18:30.793]  Let's not just glaze over this, and I may hold you over.
[03:18:30.793 --> 03:18:36.074]  Again, active duty here now in Tennessee, Chris.
[03:18:36.074 --> 03:18:37.534]  Let's be clear.
[03:18:37.534 --> 03:18:46.776]  Under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, under what Brigade Homeland has announced, I mean, you're not telling us anything that is secret.
[03:18:46.776 --> 03:18:47.977]  This is on record.
[03:18:47.977 --> 03:18:53.158]  But you're saying even the guys know that they are training for martial law in America.
[03:18:53.840 --> 03:18:58.943]  Yeah, I asked him, like, have you received any training on martial law or anything like that?
[03:18:58.943 --> 03:18:59.944]  He's like, no.
[03:18:59.944 --> 03:19:04.667]  Like, a big problem that I see, Alex, is that a lot of these people are really dumb.
[03:19:04.667 --> 03:19:17.295]  Like, if you go to the base where my brother is, it's like a fancy trailer park, basically, with everybody running around with IQs like Forrest Gump and 10 kids running around and everything.
[03:19:17.295 --> 03:19:18.596]  And that's where the problem is.
[03:19:18.596 --> 03:19:22.198]  That's where the Nazis are in the military, is just
[03:19:22.944 --> 03:19:24.246]  Ignorance, you know?
[03:19:24.246 --> 03:19:35.538]  Like, the smart people in the military are really coming around and waking up, especially since Obama got elected, but there's just still a lot of stupid people in the military.
[03:19:35.538 --> 03:19:39.963]  And so he's like, yeah, we're trained in martial law, I watch Citizens every day!
[03:19:41.590 --> 03:19:44.972]  Yeah, well, I don't even think he really understood what it means.
[03:19:44.972 --> 03:19:49.233]  You know, the guy that I talked to, he did say, yeah, we've got Drano Martial Law.
[03:19:49.233 --> 03:19:51.574]  But, I mean, he didn't understand what that meant.
[03:19:51.574 --> 03:19:55.496]  I tried to explain it to him, but you could tell it went way over his head and everything.
[03:19:55.496 --> 03:19:55.896]  Stay there.
[03:19:55.896 --> 03:19:57.217]  I got a few other questions for you.
[03:19:57.217 --> 03:20:01.299]  And then other military vets, current people, active duty, it's all coming up.
[03:20:01.299 --> 03:20:01.719]  Stay with us.
[03:20:04.002 --> 03:20:06.485]  And we're subject to other police action.
[03:20:06.485 --> 03:20:07.746]  Tyranny is here.
[03:20:07.746 --> 03:20:11.609]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:20:11.609 --> 03:20:13.912]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:20:13.912 --> 03:20:19.277]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:20:19.773 --> 03:20:26.438]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:20:26.438 --> 03:20:32.422]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:20:32.422 --> 03:20:36.105]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:20:36.605 --> 03:20:40.889]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:20:40.889 --> 03:20:46.834]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:20:46.834 --> 03:20:50.397]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:20:50.397 --> 03:20:52.359]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:20:52.359 --> 03:20:53.480]  It's here.

[03:22:03.021 --> 03:22:04.462]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:04.462 --> 03:22:10.528]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[03:22:10.528 --> 03:22:11.349]  That's right.
[03:22:11.349 --> 03:22:13.951]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[03:22:13.951 --> 03:22:21.118]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[03:22:21.658 --> 03:22:29.801]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:22:29.801 --> 03:22:35.283]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[03:22:35.283 --> 03:22:41.085]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:41.085 --> 03:22:45.187]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[03:22:45.595 --> 03:22:45.855]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:45.855 --> 03:22:47.858]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[03:22:47.858 --> 03:22:48.459]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:48.459 --> 03:22:48.739]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.232 --> 03:23:03.354]  Hi, this is Steve Shank, eFoodsDirect.
[03:23:03.354 --> 03:23:08.778]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program and have started production.
[03:23:08.778 --> 03:23:10.099]  Congratulations!
[03:23:10.099 --> 03:23:16.564]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[03:23:16.564 --> 03:23:18.306]  Shipments will begin the end of March.
[03:23:18.866 --> 03:23:21.588]  And we'll be sent in the order that they were received.
[03:23:21.588 --> 03:23:22.708]  Now, something fun.
[03:23:22.708 --> 03:23:23.669]  It's springtime.
[03:23:23.669 --> 03:23:31.594]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[03:23:31.594 --> 03:23:32.494]  Here's the plan.
[03:23:32.494 --> 03:23:41.419]  When you add a one-month Superfood Spring Pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-high bred seeds absolutely free.
[03:23:41.419 --> 03:23:43.741]  Order now while the free seeds last.
[03:23:43.741 --> 03:23:43.961]  Call 800-409-500.
[03:23:48.615 --> 03:23:49.236]  I think so.
[03:24:30.522 --> 03:24:38.283]  I was just reading the beefed up article, because he's adding more documentation as we go, by Paul Joseph Watson and Curt Nemo at PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:24:38.283 --> 03:24:39.624]  U.S.
[03:24:39.624 --> 03:24:42.864]  Army trains to take on tea parties and take them to concentration camps.
[03:24:42.864 --> 03:24:45.985]  That's in the documents.
[03:24:45.985 --> 03:24:53.767]  For decades they've been training to take us on quietly with small cadres, building it into bigger forces, slow brainwashing, incremental.
[03:24:53.767 --> 03:24:54.607]  Now they're deploying
[03:24:55.632 --> 03:24:57.074]  Army at checkpoints.
[03:24:57.074 --> 03:25:01.378]  Marines at checkpoints in the middle of the nation to stop drunk drivers.
[03:25:01.378 --> 03:25:04.961]  They're preparing everyone to go against the American people.
[03:25:04.961 --> 03:25:09.085]  The American people, even peacefully, try to say, no, we're not going into a new world order.
[03:25:10.151 --> 03:25:11.091]  This is the time.
[03:25:11.091 --> 03:25:12.792]  It's coming down to it.
[03:25:12.792 --> 03:25:21.254]  Now, I want to now hurry through the calls, finishing up with Chris, active duty, talking to the folks at Brigade Homeland, going, yeah, we're training for martial law.
[03:25:21.254 --> 03:25:24.095]  Yeah, we're surveilling the American people.
[03:25:24.095 --> 03:25:33.937]  I mean, I've talked to family who are officers in the military, and they say even repair units that fix helicopters and things are, for the first time ever, being trained in riot control and martial law.
[03:25:36.400 --> 03:25:41.962]  The military needs to read the actual officer-level manuals because they're training to take on veterans.
[03:25:41.962 --> 03:25:45.384]  I mean, is this disgusting, people in the military that you talk to?
[03:25:45.384 --> 03:25:50.846]  Don't they understand that they're going to be out of the military soon and then every dictatorship goes after the veterans first?
[03:25:52.349 --> 03:25:53.330]  It's disgusting.
[03:25:53.330 --> 03:25:58.453]  Some people, once they realize it, a lot of people don't even realize the extent that it's going on.
[03:25:58.453 --> 03:26:05.117]  And when I point it out to them, a lot of times it will disgust them, but still, a lot of people are afraid to do anything about it.
[03:26:05.117 --> 03:26:11.682]  Nobody wants to stand up and talk about it or even join Oath Keepers for the most part, with the exception of a few people that I've met.
[03:26:12.341 --> 03:26:19.848]  But, um, I just want to encourage everybody, all the brothers and sisters that are in the military, to not be afraid to talk to people.
[03:26:19.848 --> 03:26:24.532]  And you'd be surprised how many people you find that actually agree with you.
[03:26:24.532 --> 03:26:30.538]  And just uphold your oath to the Constitution no matter what, you know, because that's why you joined the military, I think.
[03:26:30.538 --> 03:26:30.998]  Yep.
[03:26:30.998 --> 03:26:32.880]  God bless you, and I appreciate your call, Chris.
[03:26:34.520 --> 03:26:45.624]  The Feds, under FBI command, said, don't let people walk out on the bridges, make them stay, don't give them food and water, go into the rich areas that weren't affected, that were high, on high ground, take their guns.
[03:26:45.624 --> 03:26:48.145]  All the arms will be taken, no one will be allowed to be armed.
[03:26:48.145 --> 03:26:49.905]  That's the quote of the police chief.
[03:26:49.905 --> 03:26:52.566]  And the military did what they were told.
[03:26:52.566 --> 03:26:55.247]  And a lot of US citizens were killed.
[03:26:55.247 --> 03:27:00.629]  And they went into old ladies' houses that wanted to stay there and take care of their dogs and cats, and they took their guns and drug them off to jail.
[03:27:01.533 --> 03:27:07.858]  I mean, this is America, and they passed the test, and the new order said, good, you'll do it, we're getting ready for it.
[03:27:07.858 --> 03:27:10.720]  And it is going to happen if we don't scream bloody murder.
[03:27:10.720 --> 03:27:14.963]  Let's talk to Roger, and then Carl, Mike, and others.
[03:27:14.963 --> 03:27:19.447]  Mike says his uncles in the military has key info, but let's talk to Roger, former military.
[03:27:19.447 --> 03:27:21.708]  Roger, what's your take on this?
[03:27:21.708 --> 03:27:24.250]  Once we talk to Roger, let's talk to Carl in Texas.
[03:27:24.250 --> 03:27:24.791]  Go ahead, Carl.
[03:27:25.951 --> 03:27:26.992]  Hey, buddy.
[03:27:26.992 --> 03:27:28.073]  How you doing there, man?
[03:27:28.073 --> 03:27:28.873]  I'm just sick of it.
[03:27:28.873 --> 03:27:30.094]  I wish this nightmare would stop.
[03:27:30.094 --> 03:27:33.516]  I wish people would wake up and say no.
[03:27:33.516 --> 03:27:35.197]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[03:27:35.197 --> 03:27:36.919]  I'm in an interracial relationship.
[03:27:36.919 --> 03:27:38.340]  My wife's Afro-American.
[03:27:38.340 --> 03:27:41.862]  I'm white, if you want to call it that, Hispanic.
[03:27:41.862 --> 03:27:54.791]  I just wanted to say thanks to Dr. Bowman for what he's done with his group so far to make a point of support for the diversity that I'm personally seeing more and more of on his website and YouTube account through the videos that he's shown.
[03:27:55.359 --> 03:27:56.039]  We're good to go.
[03:28:12.469 --> 03:28:14.250]  For a certain race of people.
[03:28:14.250 --> 03:28:17.152]  And Oath Keepers is meant for all Americans of all races.
[03:28:17.152 --> 03:28:19.834]  And that's really what I was just calling for.
[03:28:19.834 --> 03:28:21.074]  I just wanted to make that point.
[03:28:21.074 --> 03:28:23.336]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[03:28:23.336 --> 03:28:24.396]  Because here's the issue.
[03:28:24.396 --> 03:28:27.678]  The media is saying the Oath Keepers are treasonous.
[03:28:27.678 --> 03:28:30.660]  They're saying anybody who doesn't want a banking takeover is racist.
[03:28:30.660 --> 03:28:35.783]  They are injecting race into the debate to get us at each other's throats.
[03:28:35.783 --> 03:28:36.484]  God bless you.
[03:28:36.484 --> 03:28:38.305]  I really appreciate that call.
[03:28:38.305 --> 03:28:38.805]  Let's go to
[03:28:40.086 --> 03:28:41.407]  Another call here.
[03:28:41.407 --> 03:28:43.208]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[03:28:43.208 --> 03:28:43.989]  Mike, you're on the air.
[03:28:43.989 --> 03:28:46.551]  Hi there, Alex.
[03:28:46.551 --> 03:29:06.745]  You know, uh, speaking of race, uh, Barry Serto, Serto, wherever his name is, he, when he was at my local in Bloomington Normal, he sounded much more African American Black, you know, uh, and that was when he was running for Senator.
[03:29:06.745 --> 03:29:08.566]  Well, anyway,
[03:29:09.275 --> 03:29:15.478]  My uncle was in the Marine Corps in Vietnam, and my grandfather was a coxswain in the Navy.
[03:29:15.478 --> 03:29:17.138]  And you know what?
[03:29:17.138 --> 03:29:19.560]  I knew Vietnam had done something to my uncle.
[03:29:19.560 --> 03:29:23.941]  He talked about blue zones, and well, he's died.
[03:29:23.941 --> 03:29:25.582]  He's passed on.
[03:29:25.582 --> 03:29:30.744]  And I do pray that God protects you and does his will in your life, Alex.
[03:29:30.744 --> 03:29:31.925]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[03:29:31.925 --> 03:29:36.147]  I mean, what is the info you had, though, about the martial law preparations?
[03:29:36.147 --> 03:29:38.788]  Well, you know, we've had checkpoints.
[03:29:39.522 --> 03:29:43.587]  Three months ago and also last week.
[03:29:43.587 --> 03:29:44.989]  And they're getting more and more frequent.
[03:29:44.989 --> 03:29:46.110]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:46.110 --> 03:29:47.952]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:29:47.952 --> 03:29:49.013]  This is incredible.
[03:29:49.013 --> 03:29:49.314]  U.S.
[03:29:49.314 --> 03:29:51.817]  Army trained to take on tea parties.
[03:29:51.817 --> 03:29:53.198]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.198 --> 03:29:55.741]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.741 --> 03:29:58.424]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:05.276 --> 03:30:06.537]  Tyranny is here.
[03:30:06.537 --> 03:30:10.200]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:30:10.200 --> 03:30:12.882]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:30:12.882 --> 03:30:18.566]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:30:18.566 --> 03:30:24.831]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:30:25.231 --> 03:30:31.215]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:30:31.215 --> 03:30:35.378]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:30:35.378 --> 03:30:39.680]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:30:39.680 --> 03:30:45.644]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:30:45.644 --> 03:30:49.186]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:30:49.186 --> 03:30:51.167]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:30:51.167 --> 03:30:51.608]  It's here.

[03:31:13.155 --> 03:31:19.837]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[03:31:30.250 --> 03:31:34.994]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[03:31:34.994 --> 03:31:40.038]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[03:31:40.038 --> 03:31:42.200]  We turn jeans inside out.

[03:32:03.228 --> 03:32:04.449]  This is not a drill.
[03:32:04.449 --> 03:32:06.950]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:08.851]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[03:32:08.851 --> 03:32:16.075]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.

[03:32:39.828 --> 03:32:40.509]  But listen up.
[03:32:40.509 --> 03:32:46.772]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.

[03:32:48.613 --> 03:32:50.774]  That's hideyourguns.com.

[03:32:53.775 --> 03:32:54.355]  Right now.
[03:33:06.274 --> 03:33:07.275]  We are back live.
[03:33:07.275 --> 03:33:18.121]  I'm going to go to John in Kansas Military, Sandra, Texas Veteran, Henry, Michigan ex-military, and others here in just a moment.
[03:33:18.121 --> 03:33:20.202]  Then I want to get into some financial news.
[03:33:20.202 --> 03:33:29.648]  I'm not going to have time today to get into Bill Gates saying we need to vaccinate the population, to quote, reduce the population, that's a quote, and that we need to have zero carbon dioxide
[03:33:30.308 --> 03:33:51.145]  Output bring it to zero which humans exhaled He said that in the same speech and the big crowd of globalists were laughing and smiling and giggling just pure evil I'll have to cover that tomorrow and integrate it with a new video clip with similar things being said and pushed Where the same group that Bill Gates is promoting was in a speech they were saying that
[03:33:52.981 --> 03:33:58.003]  We need to be like China, who's now giving people jobs according to their genetics and their DNA.
[03:33:58.003 --> 03:34:00.244]  This is the essence of eugenics.
[03:34:00.244 --> 03:34:04.106]  We're going to cover that tomorrow, because this broke during the show.
[03:34:04.106 --> 03:34:06.927]  And Paul Watson and Kurt Nimmo put an article together.
[03:34:06.927 --> 03:34:11.289]  The latest version is at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:34:11.289 --> 03:34:11.789]  U.S.
[03:34:11.789 --> 03:34:14.731]  Army trains to confront Tea Party terrorists.
[03:34:14.731 --> 03:34:19.173]  It describes Tea Partiers as former vets who are drunkards who hate the government.
[03:34:19.853 --> 03:34:22.034]  They're training to kill military and police.
[03:34:22.034 --> 03:34:37.458]  It describes them as absolute scum, trash and white supremacist and says they must be taken on and they have drills where the Tea Party people are absolute scum and where the military takes them on and kills some and takes others to FEMA camps.
[03:34:37.458 --> 03:34:40.639]  US Army trains to confront Tea Party terrorists is the headline.
[03:34:40.639 --> 03:34:47.141]  Military personnel blow the whistle on exercise which involved troops taking protesters to concentration camps.
[03:34:48.123 --> 03:34:53.027]  And then he goes through all of that and we have the actual army documents.
[03:34:53.027 --> 03:34:55.709]  And of course the Courier-Journal's reporting this like it's a good thing.
[03:34:55.709 --> 03:34:57.871]  This is in mainstream news.
[03:34:57.871 --> 03:35:00.694]  And then they had an exercise the 23rd of this month and the 26th.
[03:35:00.694 --> 03:35:04.857]  They're having similar ones all over the country.
[03:35:04.857 --> 03:35:15.106]  But again, you can go to the website and read these documents where they just absolutely train the troops that the American people are the enemy.
[03:35:16.178 --> 03:35:21.099]  And this is all ahead of government-staged attacks to be blamed on the American people.
[03:35:21.099 --> 03:35:25.520]  And then Curt and Watson go through and give all these examples.
[03:35:25.520 --> 03:35:34.383]  The New York Times, you know, where kids are being trained, the Boy Scouts to take on disgruntled veterans and kill them and seek and destroy operations.
[03:35:34.383 --> 03:35:42.185]  We reported on Missouri National Guard unit at Camp Crowder engaging training exercises designed to take on fictitious militia group.
[03:35:42.185 --> 03:35:42.445]  It's just
[03:35:44.116 --> 03:35:48.580]  Article after article, Marines running checkpoints, Army running checkpoints.
[03:35:48.580 --> 03:35:55.805]  In Iowa, when we interviewed the colonel involved, they admitted they're doing door-to-door gun confiscation drills against the American people.
[03:35:56.997 --> 03:36:02.238]  We give you some of the back story and other examples to give you a clear picture of exactly what's going on.
[03:36:02.238 --> 03:36:08.579]  I mean, this is just insane what is happening right now.
[03:36:08.579 --> 03:36:12.040]  And you can see it all building towards ahead.
[03:36:12.040 --> 03:36:14.661]  John in Kansas, who's military.
[03:36:14.661 --> 03:36:18.161]  Go ahead, John, tell us about any information you have on this.
[03:36:18.161 --> 03:36:20.642]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[03:36:20.642 --> 03:36:26.283]  I guess, you know, we've all been instructed not to talk about
[03:36:27.498 --> 03:36:35.709]  The preparations that are being made particularly training that is being given right now to even the delayed enlistment program
[03:36:37.418 --> 03:36:39.079]  First of all, they're going into the Army.
[03:36:39.079 --> 03:36:40.160]  Oh, I forgot!
[03:36:40.160 --> 03:36:48.244]  That was in the news three years ago that San Antonio ROTC, that their drills are all to take on militias and kill them.
[03:36:48.244 --> 03:36:50.205]  See, I mean, I can't even remember all the cases.
[03:36:50.205 --> 03:36:50.825]  Sorry.
[03:36:50.825 --> 03:36:55.688]  Guys, Google San Antonio ROTC training to kill militias.
[03:36:55.688 --> 03:36:56.188]  I'm sorry.
[03:36:56.188 --> 03:36:56.629]  Sorry, sir.
[03:36:56.629 --> 03:36:56.909]  Go ahead.
[03:36:57.569 --> 03:36:58.430]  No, no, that's fine.
[03:36:58.430 --> 03:37:09.279]  Yeah, the same thing like with the Boy Scouts that are being trained, uh, specifically to go to target the, uh, military and, uh, you know, military veterans and, uh, militia members.
[03:37:09.279 --> 03:37:14.223]  Uh, but it's, I mean, regardless, nobody... I'm going to shut up because this is key info, but I just want to add this.
[03:37:14.924 --> 03:37:21.345]  Think about the magnitude that the real training isn't for Muslims that are supposedly the boogeyman that are going to get us.
[03:37:21.345 --> 03:37:23.746]  It's almost all for gun-owning Americans.
[03:37:23.746 --> 03:37:26.086]  I mean, the government is out of control and criminal.
[03:37:26.086 --> 03:37:27.286]  Now, I'm going to shut up.
[03:37:27.286 --> 03:37:29.227]  You're saying you're being told not to talk.
[03:37:29.227 --> 03:37:33.648]  We have all these documents the military is leaking, so certainly a lot of the troops are upset.
[03:37:33.648 --> 03:37:38.288]  Tell us exactly what you know, what you're being told, and if the military is buying this.
[03:37:38.288 --> 03:37:39.569]  Go ahead.
[03:37:39.569 --> 03:37:40.729]  Yeah, and so...
[03:37:41.496 --> 03:37:56.664]  So anyways, uh, training has been going on for at least the last two years now that, um, to specifically, uh, as soon as boot camp is over, everyone, we're all going to be deployed onto the streets, actually, to work with the police.
[03:37:56.664 --> 03:38:05.989]  We're being trained to work with the police specifically to assist the police force on the ground in four times of public dissent and civil unrest.
[03:38:05.989 --> 03:38:10.832]  And we're being taught crowd control, kettling techniques, I mean, you name it.
[03:38:11.352 --> 03:38:15.294]  It's in there, and it's all specifically targeted for dissenting Americans.
[03:38:15.294 --> 03:38:16.415]  And look at the G20!
[03:38:16.415 --> 03:38:19.996]  We have the troops there, we walk up and say, what about Posse Comitatus?
[03:38:19.996 --> 03:38:22.217]  And they say, we're here to aid the police.
[03:38:22.217 --> 03:38:25.119]  But that's illegal.
[03:38:25.119 --> 03:38:29.181]  And you notice that all of the personnel that were firing the sound cannons
[03:38:29.821 --> 03:38:31.482]  They were all military.
[03:38:31.482 --> 03:38:37.943]  That's because it is actually developed for war and control over in a war zone in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[03:38:37.943 --> 03:38:42.845]  So, you know, it's better to have the military personnel operating, you know, the devices of war.
[03:38:42.845 --> 03:38:45.026]  And they use the less lethal weapons.
[03:38:45.026 --> 03:38:48.106]  Even there, they call them less lethal, the rubber bullets and everything.
[03:38:48.106 --> 03:38:53.928]  And they have the troops now firing the guns, firing the sound cannons at the people.
[03:38:53.928 --> 03:38:56.429]  This is all a training aid towards real bullets.
[03:38:57.717 --> 03:38:59.158]  Right, right.
[03:38:59.158 --> 03:39:06.763]  And, uh, it's just progressively, you know, as if, you know, I mean, imagine everybody always in the, the, you know, protesting stuff.
[03:39:06.763 --> 03:39:07.563]  They're always running away.
[03:39:07.563 --> 03:39:08.264]  They're always scared.
[03:39:08.264 --> 03:39:09.224]  Nobody does anything.
[03:39:09.224 --> 03:39:17.109]  If anything, it's the provocateur, uh, you know, uh, undercovers that are actually doing the violence or the, uh, uh, anarchists.
[03:39:17.109 --> 03:39:21.552]  So the military and the police have an excuse to engage them and they've been caught over and over again.
[03:39:21.552 --> 03:39:23.053]  Denver last year, Canada.
[03:39:23.733 --> 03:39:24.274]  Okay, okay.
[03:39:24.274 --> 03:39:25.795]  Please continue.
[03:39:25.795 --> 03:39:31.018]  Tell us what else they're training you for and what are other military people you're talking to?
[03:39:31.018 --> 03:39:32.359]  Are they starting to understand what's happening?
[03:39:33.874 --> 03:39:45.539]  Well, the sad thing is you can get people to realize and agree on the Constitution and what they're supposed to uphold, but at the same time, nobody realizes how important it is.
[03:39:45.539 --> 03:39:48.640]  So I think when it comes down to it, most people are just going to fall in line.
[03:39:48.640 --> 03:39:52.821]  And if there's one or two dissenters in the ranks, well, we've been training how to deal with dissent.
[03:39:52.821 --> 03:39:54.602]  So they'll get dealt with.
[03:39:54.602 --> 03:39:55.742]  Stop right there.
[03:39:55.742 --> 03:39:56.723]  Stop right there.
[03:39:56.723 --> 03:39:59.084]  They'll be dealt with.
[03:39:59.084 --> 03:40:00.064]  Tell us about that training.
[03:40:01.863 --> 03:40:04.425]  Well, again, I don't know how much we're supposed to go into.
[03:40:04.425 --> 03:40:06.407]  I mean, actually, I don't even think we're supposed to go into any of this.
[03:40:06.407 --> 03:40:06.948]  But you know what?
[03:40:06.948 --> 03:40:10.191]  Well, sir, this is all illegal, what's going on.
[03:40:10.191 --> 03:40:16.597]  And they're now acclimating the public with Marine Corps, Army, National Guard, Homeland Security checkpoints.
[03:40:16.597 --> 03:40:18.779]  The governor of Tennessee says they can't do what they do.
[03:40:18.779 --> 03:40:20.720]  They're doing it in California.
[03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:22.562]  They're surveilling everybody in Austin.
[03:40:22.562 --> 03:40:24.484]  They're building bases all over the place.
[03:40:24.484 --> 03:40:25.725]  I mean, this is all going on.
[03:40:25.725 --> 03:40:26.546]  This is criminal.
[03:40:26.826 --> 03:40:33.429]  This is our military we paid for to be used against us so offshore banks can engage in a takeover of the U.S.
[03:40:33.429 --> 03:40:35.710]  I mean, sir, I already know what they do, okay?
[03:40:35.710 --> 03:40:37.191]  I already know what the training is.
[03:40:37.191 --> 03:40:40.613]  You're trained to take them into custody and put them in handcuffs and take them away.
[03:40:41.587 --> 03:40:43.429]  Well, just let me affirm.
[03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:47.653]  I can confirm that everything you talk about is 100% true.
[03:40:47.653 --> 03:41:00.864]  And, uh, there are so many people out there that are just so brainwashed and like, I don't know if it's if they're not smart enough or they just don't want to believe it because it seems so terrible because, you know, we've all been brought up now for, you know, what, 60 years straight now.
[03:41:00.864 --> 03:41:04.488]  And this brainwashing of, oh, America is going to, you know, never do anything.
[03:41:04.488 --> 03:41:07.871]  You know, we're so much better and above all these other third world countries and stuff.
[03:41:08.561 --> 03:41:12.585]  You know, most of the time we're the ones going over there and starting the shit in third world countries.
[03:41:12.585 --> 03:41:14.207]  Alright.
[03:41:14.207 --> 03:41:15.929]  Sir, I appreciate your call, but be careful.
[03:41:18.067 --> 03:41:20.350]  Yeah, yeah, don't.
[03:41:20.350 --> 03:41:31.061]  John, I understand you're upset and angry, but do you understand how essential it is for military men and women to go public to the mainstream media and to go on YouTube and to speak out?
[03:41:31.061 --> 03:41:36.827]  I mean, troops have said no, you know, after massacres.
[03:41:36.827 --> 03:41:39.129]  The Germans, just following orders won't cover it.
[03:41:39.790 --> 03:41:43.091]  The Germans, people were hung who followed orders.
[03:41:43.091 --> 03:41:46.852]  And it is essential that all the military people come out and speak out.
[03:41:46.852 --> 03:41:48.472]  And obviously you're calling in.
[03:41:48.472 --> 03:41:50.412]  These documents continue to get leaked.
[03:41:50.412 --> 03:41:54.253]  So that shows that the military at many levels is concerned.
[03:41:54.253 --> 03:41:56.434]  Do you have any other comments?
[03:41:56.434 --> 03:42:01.295]  I was wondering if you're going to be going to the G20 this year in Toronto.
[03:42:01.295 --> 03:42:02.275]  No, I'm probably not.
[03:42:02.275 --> 03:42:04.216]  I mean, I've got so many duties here.
[03:42:08.100 --> 03:42:12.781]  And then there's all the, I'm a big target now, but I do need to still go to events.
[03:42:12.781 --> 03:42:18.363]  It's just that, I mean, they can plant weapons on me that they've already tried in Denver.
[03:42:18.363 --> 03:42:19.683]  And people haven't lived it.
[03:42:19.683 --> 03:42:21.064]  They just haven't experienced it.
[03:42:21.064 --> 03:42:26.525]  And I, the operation I'm running is so important that it's basically, it's like I'm a general now.
[03:42:26.525 --> 03:42:34.528]  I've got to sit back in the headquarters and I don't even morally like to send my guys off because they get arrested and set up and they tried to set the guys up when they were out there.
[03:42:34.528 --> 03:42:34.988]  But, uh,
[03:42:35.888 --> 03:42:42.671]  I really should be going to these events, but more citizens should be going out to these events.
[03:42:42.671 --> 03:42:44.432]  But I've spent lots of time out in the field.
[03:42:44.432 --> 03:42:54.016]  Believe me, I mean, until you have them try to set fires and blame it on you, you just don't know how hardcore this is and how much they've trained them to hate the American people.
[03:42:54.016 --> 03:42:55.976]  But God help us.
[03:42:55.976 --> 03:43:01.679]  John, separately, you know, we've had all these people calling in about how they were trained to take on militias.
[03:43:02.179 --> 03:43:04.041]  Specifically, I mean, we have their documents.
[03:43:04.041 --> 03:43:06.143]  It's tea parties, militias, everybody.
[03:43:06.143 --> 03:43:07.364]  I mean, have you seen any of that?
[03:43:07.364 --> 03:43:09.145]  Uh, yeah.
[03:43:09.145 --> 03:43:20.535]  I mean, that's specifically, you know, the people that are supposedly against the New World Order, that are against, uh, you know, and they all say that it's like, you know, these people are crazy, like, haha, there's no New World Order, you know, but that this is what they think.
[03:43:20.535 --> 03:43:25.620]  And, you know, the people that are, uh, are against, uh, the Federal Reserve is a big one for some reason.
[03:43:25.620 --> 03:43:28.742]  Anybody who doesn't like the Federal Reserve is a terrorist, you know, I mean, so.
[03:43:29.643 --> 03:43:30.283]  I don't know.
[03:43:47.848 --> 03:44:04.936]  Army documents we have and federal documents, so you're not telling us anything that isn't public, but specifically, so they get the commander up in front of the group, they show you PowerPoints, they laugh at people, it's all a big joke, I mean we have their, they call us drunks, they call us all these names, I mean is that basically what's going on?
[03:44:05.908 --> 03:44:07.669]  Right, I mean it's called, I mean it's just class.
[03:44:07.669 --> 03:44:10.211]  Whenever you're going to class, I mean, you get training provided.
[03:44:10.211 --> 03:44:11.852]  There's different types of training that you get.
[03:44:11.852 --> 03:44:13.393]  You know, there's the training in the classroom.
[03:44:13.393 --> 03:44:15.854]  There's training that's like actual hands-on.
[03:44:15.854 --> 03:44:20.597]  And, you know, then you use drills with assisting with National Guard and the police force.
[03:44:20.597 --> 03:44:23.919]  And like national level exercise, that's, NLE is a big one.
[03:44:23.919 --> 03:44:27.221]  So, you know, everyone trains for that.
[03:44:27.221 --> 03:44:29.723]  And the training just keeps getting more realistic and more
[03:44:30.533 --> 03:44:36.117]  Specifically, he seems to be targeted directly at, you know, defending Americans that are just protecting their rights.
[03:44:36.117 --> 03:44:41.281]  You know, it doesn't really seem like anybody's doing anything that we haven't always done, you know, that makes us Americans.
[03:44:41.281 --> 03:44:51.428]  But in the drill manuals, in the scenario manuals, militias and Tea Party members are described as Ku Klux Klan, running around with guns that want to murder everyone, drinking whiskey.
[03:44:51.428 --> 03:44:57.253]  I mean, people can go read it right now, three pages of this garbage that was just going on four days ago.
[03:44:58.014 --> 03:45:00.523]  And it's total demonization.
[03:45:00.523 --> 03:45:02.190]  What type of demonization have you seen?
[03:45:03.550 --> 03:45:07.892]  Well, uh, definitely, uh, they are beating into everyone's heads.
[03:45:07.892 --> 03:45:11.494]  Like, you know, that these people are personally have something against us.
[03:45:11.494 --> 03:45:15.196]  Like, so that they want to bring out, that's like kind of a psychological thing that I noticed they do.
[03:45:15.196 --> 03:45:19.758]  They try a lot of psychological getting you to, you know, think of them as not human.
[03:45:19.758 --> 03:45:21.159]  They're, you know, dehumanize them.
[03:45:21.159 --> 03:45:26.622]  So you don't care to go after them and use your full force against them and, and feel that there's definitely a threat on you against them.
[03:45:26.622 --> 03:45:28.182]  Like these people hate the military.
[03:45:28.182 --> 03:45:29.223]  They hate anybody who is,
[03:45:29.643 --> 03:45:30.044]  We're good to go.
[03:45:45.115 --> 03:45:45.275]  Yes.
[03:46:03.715 --> 03:46:06.576]  Marine killing the cops in Pittsburgh.
[03:46:06.576 --> 03:46:13.539]  They blamed me on the news and said I called for it and it turned out the guy was a white supremacist and posted all over the internet hating me.
[03:46:13.539 --> 03:46:16.801]  National News was just here saying are you going to cause violence?
[03:46:16.801 --> 03:46:20.303]  National News says I'm calling for violence when I'm calling for the opposite.
[03:46:20.303 --> 03:46:22.223]  I'm pointing out they're going to stage it.
[03:46:22.223 --> 03:46:30.167]  So you can see the setup that is going on and you're saying now it's almost entirely militia, gun owners, veterans.
[03:46:30.167 --> 03:46:31.488]  They hate America.
[03:46:31.488 --> 03:46:32.248]  We've got to get them.
[03:46:33.757 --> 03:46:39.460]  Well, uh, the idea is that there's going to be a lot of unrest and that will be needed.
[03:46:39.460 --> 03:46:44.923]  So there's definitely going to be something false flag stage to bring in the need for us.
[03:46:44.923 --> 03:46:49.045]  I mean, it's not going to be just like, we're going to go on the streets and roll out and say, we've had enough of you guys.
[03:46:49.045 --> 03:46:53.267]  No, I mean, it's going to be like, there's going to be some, you know, you know, proverbial,
[03:46:54.095 --> 03:46:55.136]  Don't say it!
[03:47:13.463 --> 03:47:16.304]  You know, you can feel the boiling point already in our society.
[03:47:16.304 --> 03:47:17.484]  Well, the system knows that.
[03:47:17.484 --> 03:47:22.566]  I mean, government's all just spending more, more taxes, grabbing everything, more, more, more.
[03:47:22.566 --> 03:47:28.287]  And then meanwhile, there's the military being trained that veterans are our enemy and they hate the military.
[03:47:28.287 --> 03:47:31.828]  I mean, how transparent does this have to get?
[03:47:31.828 --> 03:47:33.549]  And we know they set up Hattari.
[03:47:33.549 --> 03:47:40.271]  We know they write the... I told Hattari in August of last year, I said, they're going to set you up and claim you want to kill cops.
[03:47:40.951 --> 03:47:48.713]  I had sickles on the air, and I identified what that group was putting out, and that they had FBI inside leading it.
[03:47:48.713 --> 03:47:51.913]  And it's come out now in federal documents that that happened.
[03:47:51.913 --> 03:48:03.356]  I mean, I was able, just by watching, to specifically single out that intelligence operation because it was clownish how ridiculous it is, and now they're going to play out this script
[03:48:04.196 --> 03:48:07.618]  And the military's going to have their parents' pension funds taken.
[03:48:07.618 --> 03:48:11.500]  And if mom and dad speak up, you know, their kids will say, mom and dad were taken away.
[03:48:11.500 --> 03:48:13.561]  They didn't like America.
[03:48:13.561 --> 03:48:15.943]  And this is how it happens.
[03:48:15.943 --> 03:48:18.164]  This is Red Dawn, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:48:18.164 --> 03:48:20.605]  And they've massively built this up.
[03:48:20.605 --> 03:48:24.568]  They've never trained the military at one-tenth of what we see now.
[03:48:24.568 --> 03:48:30.691]  And again, I'm going to ask you, I mean, we heard earlier people calling in saying the military's waking up.
[03:48:30.691 --> 03:48:32.112]  Are you seeing the military wake up?
[03:48:33.474 --> 03:48:41.920]  I have really tried to wake up a lot of people and I find that for every, it's usually about for every 10 people you try, you get one to like fully awaken.
[03:48:42.679 --> 03:49:04.127]  But, you know, I'm definitely seeing at least 25% strong, or people in the military are at least aware that something's going on and probably 50% of the people, or let me say 50% of the people are aware that at least something's going on and 25% of the people are definitely enough in the know that when things start going that way, I think that there will be
[03:49:04.867 --> 03:49:14.073]  You know, maybe a dissension spring off from, you know, like, like the other caller said, I think, I don't really see how they're gonna do it, you know, without bringing in the Blue Helmets.
[03:49:14.073 --> 03:49:16.214]  But, I'm sure that's already in the works.
[03:49:16.214 --> 03:49:23.519]  Well, NLE09 at FEMA.gov says they're gonna, they trained last year with troops from 14 countries to take on the American scum.
[03:49:25.197 --> 03:49:35.493]  Right, and you know, I think that in 2010 that it's just going to be, I think, probably about four times as many foreign troops.
[03:49:35.493 --> 03:49:38.298]  So you see the foreign troops trying to take us on?
[03:49:39.485 --> 03:49:45.968]  Well, they're gonna have to because the foreign troops, you know, if anything, would love the chance to come in and, you know, beat up on Americans.
[03:49:45.968 --> 03:49:59.314]  You know, that's like, you know, because the same zeitgeist brainwashing that they do on our society, you know, to hate these, you know, evil people from other parts of the country, they do in other parts of the world to hate Americans.
[03:50:00.211 --> 03:50:01.431]  Well, let's be clear though.
[03:50:01.431 --> 03:50:14.514]  I've had military and police confirm to me, and pastors and the clergy response teams, that whole secret program that we broke that's now national news and confirmed, that they train them specifically that Alex Jones is evil.
[03:50:14.514 --> 03:50:19.615]  Have you been taught, look out for Alex Jones material?
[03:50:19.615 --> 03:50:26.717]  It's funny you ask that because Alex Jones, that training I was given was actually one of the reasons why I really started to listen to you.
[03:50:27.947 --> 03:50:30.028]  Good, it's backfiring on the enemy operation.
[03:50:30.028 --> 03:50:33.890]  We're going to defend America, we're going to defeat the global banking takeover.
[03:50:33.890 --> 03:50:42.334]  Imagine, the veterans are bad, the patriots, people that don't want the banking takeover are bad, Alex Jones is pure evil, and so what were they saying?
[03:50:42.334 --> 03:50:44.335]  This guy is very dangerous, this is what I've been told.
[03:50:44.335 --> 03:50:47.256]  Stay there, I've got to come back to you briefly, I've got to hit some financial news.
[03:50:47.256 --> 03:50:50.358]  This man right here, Alex Jones, has a kernel of truth.
[03:50:50.358 --> 03:50:54.780]  This man is very persuasive, he is deceptive, and he wants to kill cops.
[03:50:55.160 --> 03:51:02.426]  This man is evil, and you must realize that he made me with Al-Qaeda.
[03:51:02.426 --> 03:51:04.288]  Don't answer it!

[03:54:57.612 --> 03:55:01.095]  Army trains to confront Tea Party terrorists.
[03:55:01.095 --> 03:55:04.617]  Tea Party, you are being demonized.
[03:55:04.617 --> 03:55:11.122]  And Limbaugh better talk about this, Savage better talk about this, we better get this out, and we may be able to save this country.
[03:55:11.122 --> 03:55:12.603]  They're not gonna go with this operation.
[03:55:13.809 --> 03:55:17.972]  And stage an attack as the pretext, unless we lay down and let them do it.
[03:55:17.972 --> 03:55:19.694]  We've got to get the info out now.
[03:55:19.694 --> 03:55:21.535]  This article is so important.
[03:55:21.535 --> 03:55:21.815]  U.S.
[03:55:21.815 --> 03:55:23.597]  Army trains to confront Tea Party terrorists.
[03:55:23.597 --> 03:55:31.103]  Now, I can tell you how many military people, and I've also been in reports, I mean, I've gotten government reports, where my name is there.
[03:55:31.103 --> 03:55:35.286]  Now, why do you, specifically, what were they saying about me in the training?
[03:55:36.499 --> 03:55:40.623]  That you are a conspiracy den, basically.
[03:55:40.623 --> 03:55:47.209]  You would be considered a leader in the, like, radical expression, I guess.
[03:55:47.209 --> 03:55:49.131]  So I'm like Osama bin Laden, basically.
[03:55:50.168 --> 03:55:50.488]  Yeah.
[03:55:50.488 --> 03:55:54.589]  If they had a deck of cards for the Patriots, that'd be the Aces page.
[03:55:54.589 --> 03:55:56.190]  You'd be up there, yeah.
[03:55:56.190 --> 03:56:08.253]  But, you know, see, what you do is, you know, the people that are susceptible to be radicalized or whatever, you would be, you know, what basically is you're waking them up, you know, but they view that as, you know, radicalization.
[03:56:08.253 --> 03:56:11.074]  So, you know, people that have been radicalized
[03:56:11.638 --> 03:56:15.341]  You know, it's kind of like the red and blue list thing.
[03:56:15.341 --> 03:56:28.172]  You know, you would be somebody on the red list, definitely, and the blue list people would be like your listeners that are kind of like would fall in line with you if there was a movement that started, but at the same time could probably be brainwashed to fall back into society.
[03:56:28.172 --> 03:56:32.375]  And do they imply that I'm calling for violence?
[03:56:32.375 --> 03:56:34.997]  Well, uh, yes.
[03:56:34.997 --> 03:56:36.859]  Because we know that's the public script.
[03:56:38.277 --> 03:56:38.938]  Right.
[03:56:38.938 --> 03:56:42.001]  And it's dangerous rhetoric.
[03:56:42.001 --> 03:56:47.988]  You know, it is, you know, violent, you know, dangerous, violent rhetoric and those types of things.
[03:56:50.044 --> 03:57:04.878]  Yeah, I'm on the air saying for 15 years that the military's secretly training to go after gun owners and patriots, and now they're going, we're getting ready to go after gun owners and patriots, and these nuts think we're getting ready to go after gun owners, veterans, and patriots.
[03:57:04.878 --> 03:57:06.179]  These people are crazy!
[03:57:06.179 --> 03:57:07.780]  They think we're getting ready to go after them!
[03:57:07.780 --> 03:57:09.402]  That's why we're training to go after them!
[03:57:10.995 --> 03:57:11.876]  Exactly.
[03:57:11.876 --> 03:57:17.199]  That's always the conundrum that I usually use to stump people that are kind of not wanting to believe it.
[03:57:17.199 --> 03:57:18.219]  Sir, we're out of time.
[03:57:18.219 --> 03:57:19.240]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:57:19.240 --> 03:57:20.261]  God bless you.
[03:57:20.261 --> 03:57:21.461]  Ted's been holding for 30 minutes.
[03:57:21.461 --> 03:57:25.123]  I wanted to get Ted up so people could financially protect themselves with gold and silver.
[03:57:25.123 --> 03:57:29.086]  He bought gold back when it was $1,060 an ounce.
[03:57:29.086 --> 03:57:30.026]  It's $1,170 right now.
[03:57:30.026 --> 03:57:32.047]  Ted, I apologize for making you hold.
[03:57:32.047 --> 03:57:33.288]  This is such incredible info.
[03:57:33.288 --> 03:57:36.210]  In the last minute and a half, throw out the gold offer for today.
[03:57:38.496 --> 03:57:41.677]  Yeah, we're going to be offering the Frank at $249.68.
[03:57:41.677 --> 03:57:44.058]  You know, there's hardly enough time to talk about it.
[03:57:44.058 --> 03:57:46.799]  We'll follow up with an email to show people what it is.
[03:57:46.799 --> 03:57:48.599]  Maybe you can put it up on the website.
[03:57:48.599 --> 03:57:55.001]  But it's such a great buy because you're getting the full year subscription to Bob Chapman's International Forecaster.
[03:57:55.001 --> 03:58:00.843]  And I've got to say, with the information that you have and the kind of stuff that he's providing, I don't know how people can afford not to take this.
[03:58:01.881 --> 03:58:04.383]  You've got gold at cheaper than anywhere else.
[03:58:04.383 --> 03:58:08.246]  You can find it because you bought it when it was low and you're selling it when it's high at the old low price.
[03:58:08.246 --> 03:58:08.346]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:08.346 --> 03:58:08.606]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:08.606 --> 03:58:10.488]  We ought to just do 20 minutes tomorrow on the economy.
[03:58:10.488 --> 03:58:10.528]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:21.883 --> 03:58:24.706]  So important to protect yourself from these bankers.
[03:58:24.706 --> 03:58:31.512]  And Ted, thank you so much for coming on with us and associating with somebody as evil as me.
[03:58:31.512 --> 03:58:32.373]  God bless you all.
[03:58:32.373 --> 03:58:35.396]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:35.396 --> 03:58:37.318]  God Almighty, it's getting crazy.
[03:58:37.318 --> 03:58:38.058]  Great job, crew.
