[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:44.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, wow, we've got big developments.
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  A lot of really positive developments, but also a lot of really negative developments.
[00:50.000 --> 00:59.000]  But it's always good to know what you're facing so that you can make preparation for it in hell, even try to stop it.
[00:59.000 --> 01:07.000]  You know, it's always best to face up to things, isn't it? At least it is 99% of the time.
[01:07.000 --> 01:14.000]  Alright, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, and wow, is this not an amazing time to be alive, obviously.
[01:14.000 --> 01:24.000]  We have the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals coming out and specifically saying that major states have filed, along with a lot of private businesses,
[01:24.000 --> 01:36.000]  against Biden's unconstitutional edict that he is directing through a federal agency that everyone take the experimental, poison, deathshot, clot shots.
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.000]  And the whole corporate media is trying to gaslight us and act like this is just terrible and bizarre,
[01:41.000 --> 01:52.000]  but this is a specific federal court of appeals ruling, again, because the states have brought forward real, compelling evidence of tyranny.
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  This is completely outside of law. We've got the ruling right here. We'll be covering it coming up next segment.
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  But first, I want to start with a quote by Booker T. Washington.
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  And you could say this all the different ways, but he said it, I think, the best.
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  A lie doesn't become truth. Think about that.
[02:12.000 --> 02:25.000]  A lie doesn't become truth. Wrong doesn't become right. And evil doesn't become good just because it's accepted by a majority.
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  If the majority of Americans said we were going to start barbecuing two-year-old children alive,
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  if there was a mass psychosis, that would not make them right. It would make them wrong.
[02:37.000 --> 02:45.000]  And if the Supreme Court 150 years ago said that, or I guess longer than that now, it's like 200 years ago,
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  that blacks were only two-thirds human, well, that's wrong as well.
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  And so the Democratic Party and Jimmy Kimmel and Hollywood and George Soros and the globalists and everybody out there
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  can say that there's 50 genders and say that pedophilia is good and push their world government agenda
[03:05.000 --> 03:12.000]  and the head of the Democrat Banking Control Committee, the Budget Committee saying we can print unlimited money.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  We have all the power. We're invincible. That's delusional crazy person talk.
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  And the type of thing you hear right before a major war or total collapse and or both.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  And I'm getting into the financial numbers that are so incredible tonight as well.
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.000]  I mean, this bubble is way beyond the point of blowing.
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.000]  It does blow. Katie bar the door, but that's what the great resets about to get you ready with the global carbon tax,
[03:35.000 --> 03:42.000]  the global ID and the new guaranteed universal income that puts everybody basically at a subservient subsistence level.
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  Absolutely incredible, unless you're like that one-tenth to one percent of the globalist superclass.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  So we've got all that to cover here today and there is just so much more to it.
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  You know, on Friday, the FBI raided two different homes of members of Project Veritas in New York.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  And then on Saturday, they raided James O'Keeffe.
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  And they told James O'Keeffe on Friday, don't talk about this or we might indict you for obstruction.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  And even Fox News legal analysts and others, this is unprecedented.
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.000]  You're allowed to say whatever you want and then rating the journalist James O'Keeffe is outrageous.
[04:20.000 --> 04:27.000]  And they're now confirming the diary with Biden's daughters talking about him having sex with her.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  But that's real.
[04:29.000 --> 04:36.000]  So wow, man, you've got the FBI as the attack dog of the president,
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  which is what Nixon got in trouble for even thinking about.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  And then the damn diary that hard to believe that's real.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  But boy, he's basically doing a lot of wild stuff.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  They are definitely a out of control family.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  But I mean, look, Biden's wife runs around on the Rose Garden wearing fishnets.
[04:55.000 --> 05:20.000]  I mean, right back.
[05:20.000 --> 05:27.000]  It's even better than the last formula with chaga mushrooms and turmeric and just everything.
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.000]  It's so good.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  It's now available again, 20% off.

[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  Last time of the year, that deal's happening.
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  It's all available now at infowarsstore.com.
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  The Black Friday sale comes early.
[05:56.000 --> 06:00.000]  It's going right now for the next two weeks, and it supports the Info War.
[06:00.000 --> 06:01.000]  Take action now and get ready.
[06:01.000 --> 06:02.000]  You got it, got it, got it.
[06:02.000 --> 06:08.000]  Thanks, man, for coming down.
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.000]  Waging War on Corruption.
[06:11.000 --> 06:21.000]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[06:21.000 --> 06:36.620]  Wow, here we are live broadcasting worldwide on hundreds of radio stations with millions
[06:36.620 --> 06:41.920]  of people tuning in over InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com blasting out on TV satellites
[06:41.920 --> 06:45.480]  to Europe, Africa and North America.
[06:45.480 --> 06:52.360]  It is Sunday, November 7th, 2021 and we are extremely honored and blessed to be here.
[06:52.360 --> 06:57.960]  That's why I'm now hosting shows seven days a week, I was hosting them five days a week
[06:57.960 --> 07:00.360]  going back 28 years ago.
[07:00.360 --> 07:04.440]  Then after the last 16, I've been hosting Sunday four to six, that's what you're watching
[07:04.440 --> 07:08.120]  listening to right now and hell the world is so crazy.
[07:08.120 --> 07:11.920]  I've gone to seven days a week now, I've got a two and a half hour commercial free
[07:11.920 --> 07:17.240]  transmission yesterday that aired at 5 p.m. that was extremely powerful, got a nice 700,000
[07:17.240 --> 07:22.480]  views just to band on video and millions of folks have also tuned into it elsewhere thanks
[07:22.480 --> 07:27.000]  to you spreading the links and taking action and coming up very soon in December and into
[07:27.000 --> 07:28.000]  the new year.
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  I'm launching a whole nother show weeknights, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.360]  You know why, because the Democrats and the Deputator are trying to shut me up.
[07:36.360 --> 07:41.520]  So guess what, I got a rule, you cut off one head, two more go right back where it came
[07:41.520 --> 07:44.520]  from and I've been saying that over 20 years.
[07:44.520 --> 07:48.720]  That's not from your little Red Skull Captain America program where you cut off one head
[07:48.720 --> 07:54.400]  to either a two more go back, but I guess that's kind of how this works, but I'm fighting
[07:54.400 --> 07:58.000]  the real hydra of the new world order.
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.040]  So I salute you all and thank you all for your support and your prayers and your just
[08:02.040 --> 08:04.040]  amazing blessings.
[08:04.040 --> 08:09.280]  Okay, let me just start the show with this because we got a big broadcast as usual, but
[08:09.280 --> 08:13.400]  they just get bigger each transmission because more and more is happening here and the quickening,
[08:13.400 --> 08:17.160]  the singularity as we approach that, whatever you want to call it.
[08:17.160 --> 08:26.840]  The transhumanist, the singularitarians or that's how they say it, believe that this
[08:26.840 --> 08:32.280]  is the end of history that we're approaching and that they are in full control of humanity's
[08:32.280 --> 08:38.640]  mind and soul and genetics and developmental future.
[08:38.640 --> 08:43.760]  And they just want to be able to mold the brains of the people to accept this nightmare
[08:43.760 --> 08:46.280]  future and to not resist it.
[08:46.280 --> 08:50.040]  Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm going to resist it.
[08:50.040 --> 08:52.680]  I'm here to tell you that I'm not going to go along with it.
[08:52.680 --> 08:58.960]  I'm here to tell you that I know it's destructive and evil and selfish and stinks to high heaven
[08:58.960 --> 09:03.280]  and I'm going to document it and I believe in you and I believe that when you figure
[09:03.280 --> 09:06.800]  out how much trouble you're in and what an incredible attack you're under, that you're
[09:06.800 --> 09:08.680]  going to rise to the occasion.
[09:08.680 --> 09:15.080]  So I salute you all and thank you all for being here with us on this November 7th transmission.
[09:15.080 --> 09:17.480]  So here we are.
[09:17.480 --> 09:18.800]  How do I want to start the show today?
[09:18.800 --> 09:23.640]  Well, I'm going to start it with this Booker T. Washington quote that you can't read enough.
[09:23.640 --> 09:25.960]  A lie doesn't become truth.
[09:25.960 --> 09:27.760]  Wrong doesn't become right.
[09:27.760 --> 09:35.960]  Evil doesn't become good just because it's accepted by a majority.
[09:35.960 --> 09:37.760]  And it's not been accepted by a majority.
[09:37.760 --> 09:39.520]  Wrong has not been accepted.
[09:39.520 --> 09:43.800]  Federal Court of Appeals temporarily blocks Biden's vaccine mandate.
[09:43.800 --> 09:46.200]  I actually got the ruling right here.
[09:46.200 --> 09:49.000]  I thought I couldn't find it anywhere on the news.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.360]  So I thought how about I just go actually find and read the ruling for you.
[09:54.360 --> 09:55.360]  What an original idea.
[09:55.360 --> 09:56.360]  We're going to be doing that in a moment.
[09:56.360 --> 10:00.800]  And then I've got definitions of what the judge said in legal parlance coming up.
[10:00.800 --> 10:01.960]  It's very, very important.
[10:01.960 --> 10:07.520]  And then I've got what the Biden administration of globalists said in response to that.
[10:07.520 --> 10:13.360]  It's all very important to understand how they're taking control of the country and the
[10:13.360 --> 10:19.640]  world because before I even saw this ruling yesterday afternoon, we were already up here
[10:19.640 --> 10:20.640]  taping a show.
[10:20.640 --> 10:21.640]  This is live.
[10:21.640 --> 10:25.040]  We were, and we tape the Sunday show generally.
[10:25.040 --> 10:30.560]  And I was going to title the show The Permanent Emergency.
[10:30.560 --> 10:34.160]  And then of course that's actually what they say here.
[10:34.160 --> 10:39.040]  So the term permanent emergency is very important.
[10:39.040 --> 10:45.880]  And the rest of your life because fighting the great reset and the permanent emergency
[10:45.880 --> 10:47.920]  is the rest of your life.
[10:47.920 --> 10:52.920]  It's the number one thing governing you on this planet and your body and your health
[10:52.920 --> 10:57.680]  and your future and your money and your right to live your life as you see fit because the
[10:57.680 --> 11:01.800]  good times ladies and gentlemen are gone.
[11:01.800 --> 11:05.160]  And they don't come back till we wake up and say no to the new world order.
[11:05.160 --> 11:07.160]  They just get worse.
[11:07.160 --> 11:09.280]  But we got a lot of good news here.
[11:09.280 --> 11:14.520]  It's going to be a very big animating contest of liberty that Jefferson talked about.
[11:14.520 --> 11:18.760]  And we could all just wake up to the great reset and corporate fascism and the new world
[11:18.760 --> 11:23.240]  order and all their books and white papers and their terms, technocracy and their admissions
[11:23.240 --> 11:24.240]  of what they're setting up.
[11:24.240 --> 11:25.240]  It's all there.
[11:25.240 --> 11:26.240]  It's all a blueprint.
[11:26.240 --> 11:27.240]  It's all being rolled out.
[11:27.240 --> 11:36.120]  We live under a system that is habituating us to tyranny, under AI technocracy.
[11:36.120 --> 11:37.560]  In their words.
[11:37.560 --> 11:41.920]  And we could decide that we're under attack and decide we've got to say no to it.
[11:41.920 --> 11:45.920]  But the average person is so delusional that they just think if they deny that's going
[11:45.920 --> 11:49.520]  on or just rationalize it or say, oh, I'm not going to care.
[11:49.520 --> 11:52.600]  That gives them power over something.
[11:52.600 --> 11:55.760]  That's like saying you don't need to get up and go for a jog or get up and go lift weights
[11:55.760 --> 11:57.720]  or go up and take a hike.
[11:57.720 --> 12:01.200]  And then you just sit there on your couch eating bonbons and Twinkies and you have a
[12:01.200 --> 12:04.800]  giant heart attack or diabetes.
[12:04.800 --> 12:06.080]  I'm certainly not perfect either.
[12:06.080 --> 12:08.240]  But I know I need to get up and exercise.
[12:08.240 --> 12:09.240]  So I do.
[12:09.240 --> 12:10.440]  I feel better and life's better.
[12:10.440 --> 12:14.200]  And it's the same thing opposing this.
[12:14.200 --> 12:18.440]  We've got to understand that this is like lifting weights or stretching or going for
[12:18.440 --> 12:20.680]  a walk or whatever it is.
[12:20.680 --> 12:23.840]  When you don't do it, it gets harder and harder and then it gets hard to even get up from
[12:23.840 --> 12:25.720]  your chair and go to the bathroom.
[12:25.720 --> 12:29.640]  But when you get out there and stretch and exercise every day, you can get addicted to
[12:29.640 --> 12:33.360]  it and it feels great and it's wonderful and you don't want to stop.
[12:33.360 --> 12:34.800]  It's like riding a bike.
[12:34.800 --> 12:37.880]  And so see what I do is study how the world really works.
[12:37.880 --> 12:41.920]  What I do is look at how systems integrate and connect and then I can go read a Davos
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.240]  group publication and it's word for word but I already said years before on air because
[12:46.240 --> 12:52.120]  I've already studied their operations and I already am inside their system.
[12:52.120 --> 12:56.480]  And again, that's why the Kissinger group tried to hire me because they said you know
[12:56.480 --> 13:05.520]  how to integrate systems and see through things and see the patterns and understand large integrated
[13:05.520 --> 13:07.920]  programs of analysis.
[13:07.920 --> 13:13.000]  And it's an idiot savant trait to see what I saw coming 25, 30 years ago.
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.960]  But now you got to be in a coma or in a trance or under a spell, that's the old term for
[13:18.960 --> 13:21.720]  it, to not see what's happening.
[13:21.720 --> 13:27.520]  And people are in a highly suggestible trance state living through artificial constructs
[13:27.520 --> 13:32.320]  or artificial identities that have been programmed and the behavioral psychologists all know
[13:32.320 --> 13:37.240]  this and they've used this with the corporations to get in control.
[13:37.240 --> 13:42.640]  But in the process they are ruining and destroying civilization so now they've created a cosmology
[13:42.640 --> 13:46.680]  where they're going to have the control demolition of civilization because they believe we're
[13:46.680 --> 13:51.700]  already going through a natural cycle of collapse and decadence which is true so they've exacerbated
[13:51.700 --> 13:56.800]  it for 80 years or so to make it as bad as possible so that they believe they'll come
[13:56.800 --> 14:01.760]  out on the other side of it in control before we wait and have a mass calamity with nuclear
[14:01.760 --> 14:06.320]  weapons or bio weapons, they're going to have limited releases of the bio weapons ahead
[14:06.320 --> 14:11.360]  of that to again go ahead and cull the public down to a manageable size.
[14:11.360 --> 14:13.880]  And there are real arguments to all of that.
[14:13.880 --> 14:17.480]  And when you go out and you look at the public walking around like dumb zombies, don't care
[14:17.480 --> 14:21.160]  what color they are or where they're from, people are in big trouble but from the western
[14:21.160 --> 14:26.280]  countries with all the decadence we're in the worst trouble and you see how unconscious
[14:26.280 --> 14:31.240]  they are and how decadent they are and you just say hey they don't want me to help them,
[14:31.240 --> 14:33.600]  I guess go ahead, gate step in and kill them.
[14:33.600 --> 14:37.400]  I mean did I, and I'm not just saying this, did I make the wrong choice, should I help
[14:37.400 --> 14:42.120]  them just kill all of you seriously because I don't feel good doing that and I have a
[14:42.120 --> 14:47.600]  connection to God and the Holy Spirit tells me not to do it but I mean seriously, seriously
[14:47.600 --> 14:54.480]  because you're just as bad as Bill Gates and all these people, if you know this information
[14:54.480 --> 14:59.120]  is happening and you don't do anything about it because you're decadent and lazy or you
[14:59.120 --> 15:03.800]  just don't have the spirit of resistance against it, then is Bill Gates actually as evil as
[15:03.800 --> 15:11.200]  he is fulfilling a purpose to remove the weak people?
[15:11.200 --> 15:17.960]  Now my central problem with Gates and the globalist is they are inbred, they're massively
[15:17.960 --> 15:26.000]  connected to pedophilia, they're very immoral and they have lead horrible lives and their
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.640]  programs target the most intelligent and brightest people out there in a general carpet bombing
[15:31.640 --> 15:36.080]  to take out all their competition and I don't even call that the pop eugenics they push
[15:36.080 --> 15:42.360]  but a very, very destructive form of hyper-dominant similar to a bear eating the male cub because
[15:42.360 --> 15:44.800]  he doesn't want to be challenged by it later.

[03:40.220 --> 20:37.080]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen to this November 7th Worldwide Transmission.
[20:37.080 --> 20:41.280]  Let's start plowing in to the really big news.
[20:41.280 --> 20:46.600]  There are a bunch of national polls out showing that Biden has between 30 and 36% approval
[20:46.600 --> 20:52.360]  rating in more than 16 polls that were just conducted in the last week and remember those
[20:52.360 --> 20:57.680]  are skewed towards the Democratic Party in the methodologies of those polls.
[20:57.680 --> 21:02.280]  So Biden probably has about a 20% approval rating.
[21:02.280 --> 21:05.720]  He probably had a 30% during the election.
[21:05.720 --> 21:09.560]  Kamala Harris, remember when she was running for the nomination of the Democratic Party
[21:09.560 --> 21:14.960]  a couple years ago, had less than half a percent with black voters and a half a percent with
[21:14.960 --> 21:16.880]  other voters.
[21:16.880 --> 21:20.360]  So these guys are a joke, people are like oh great then, they're discredited, people
[21:20.360 --> 21:21.720]  are blaming Biden.
[21:21.720 --> 21:24.960]  Biden and Kamala Harris are not running things.
[21:24.960 --> 21:30.360]  The Rockefeller Foundation, Klaus Schwab, the Davos Group, the Bilderberg Group, Bill
[21:30.360 --> 21:35.280]  Gates' organizations, that's the private foundations, the Carnegie Endowment, they're
[21:35.280 --> 21:36.280]  running the show.
[21:36.280 --> 21:40.480]  I told you the Carnegie and Ford and Rockefeller Foundations work together, they're run by
[21:40.480 --> 21:45.920]  the same groups now and I said that the Rockefeller Foundation runs all our medical systems and
[21:45.920 --> 21:53.280]  the whole geopolitical system at the trilateral level is run by the Carnegie Endowment and
[21:53.280 --> 21:57.000]  they have some overlaps and then the Ford Foundation is involved in this kind of socialist
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.680]  agenda, open borders, third world populations being brought in.
[22:00.680 --> 22:07.840]  You can look this up and the Rockefeller Foundation is in control of the entire Western
[22:07.840 --> 22:16.320]  world's COVID rollout, the COVID passports, all of it, that's on record, you can just
[22:16.320 --> 22:21.960]  type in Rockefeller Foundation directing NIH, CDC.
[22:21.960 --> 22:27.600]  So these are the people and they created and funded Hitler and that came out in the Nuremberg
[22:27.600 --> 22:28.600]  trials.
[22:28.600 --> 22:35.640]  The Bushes just worked for the Rockefellers, that's why George H.W. Bush famously asked
[22:35.640 --> 22:39.120]  what kind of Republican are you and he said, I'm a Rockefeller Republicans, I've worked
[22:39.120 --> 22:42.080]  for the Rockefellers as my father did my whole life.
[22:42.080 --> 22:47.880]  That's a quote in the newspaper and they created Hitler.
[22:47.880 --> 22:53.840]  Now you kind of get a little idea here and then you've got Gates, whose father and grandfather
[22:53.840 --> 22:57.800]  worked for the Rockefellers on record.
[22:57.800 --> 23:01.040]  So they're more sophisticated than Hitler.
[23:01.040 --> 23:05.680]  That was a dialectic, they created Hitler to have a right wing version as they projected
[23:05.680 --> 23:11.400]  it, really left wing as a socialist and then they go, oh no, no, no, we're not going to
[23:11.400 --> 23:15.240]  just target one group of people or two groups, we're just going to set up a liberal world
[23:15.240 --> 23:19.560]  order counter Hitler but you now see the dialectic, it's actually much more vicious and even
[23:19.560 --> 23:24.360]  much more deadly because it's much more sophisticated and creeping and more shielded and more cloaked
[23:24.360 --> 23:25.360]  and more hidden.
[23:25.360 --> 23:33.240]  So before I hit the big appellate court ruling against Biden and walk through it, when you
[23:33.240 --> 23:39.160]  see Biden and you see national news saying that he walked up to Prince Charles, who's
[23:39.160 --> 23:45.360]  really already the king of England and his longtime wife Camilla Parker Bowles and reportedly,
[23:45.360 --> 23:53.440]  this is in the news, passed a long ripping fart, this is in the news and then it smelled
[23:53.440 --> 23:57.680]  horribly, they believe he defecated in his pants.
[23:57.680 --> 24:05.360]  When I get up here on air and I tell you that Secret Service told us directly that he had
[24:05.360 --> 24:12.560]  to change his pants repeatedly, the day before 9-11 and on 9-11 and it's part of what he
[24:12.560 --> 24:18.880]  does when he's upset or angry, he has dementia that he literally dumps a huge load of feces
[24:18.880 --> 24:19.880]  into his pants.
[24:19.880 --> 24:22.160]  He has to wear diapers now.
[24:22.160 --> 24:28.040]  It's in mainstream news, I'll cover it later, but it's all over the British news that indeed
[24:28.040 --> 24:33.000]  that he was defecating his pants at the royal party.
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.680]  This is all part of humiliating America.
[24:36.680 --> 24:41.880]  Watch the videos on infowars.com, thunderous chant of F. Joe Biden breaks out during UFC
[24:41.880 --> 24:45.920]  268 fight.
[24:45.920 --> 24:50.800]  You see it's everywhere, but see then he gets the blame, he leaves and the doubling gas prices,
[24:50.800 --> 24:54.600]  the collapse borders, the dollar that's going to end up going belly up out of their plan
[24:54.600 --> 25:00.520]  for a global reset currency, all of their agenda gets blamed on him and then the very globalists
[25:00.520 --> 25:05.680]  that are doing all this, they slide in a Republican, a Democrat, whatever and then the agenda just
[25:05.680 --> 25:06.680]  keeps rolling.
[25:06.680 --> 25:08.240]  That's how they do this.
[25:08.240 --> 25:13.000]  I mean, even in a book by Frank Herbert that I read several times, it's excellent, much
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.040]  better than both movies, this is just so detailed and it's got a lot of historical references
[25:17.040 --> 25:19.600]  that he put into fiction.
[25:19.600 --> 25:25.320]  Stephen Harkinen sets up his cousin that he's jealous of to go take over the planet, doesn't
[25:25.320 --> 25:31.000]  sneak attack, takes him out, then he puts in his fat, mean, vicious nephew and says
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.840]  squeeze and kill and murder and enslave and then after you're done exterminating most
[25:35.840 --> 25:41.520]  of the population, I'll send Fade Rabon, you know, the young, handsome guy as the savior
[25:41.520 --> 25:51.560]  and then they'll accept tyranny as liberation because they were under just absolute genocide
[25:51.560 --> 25:52.840]  and that's all this is.
[25:52.840 --> 25:56.600]  Oh, you've been locked up for a year, you're going bankrupt, you're suicidal, take this
[25:56.600 --> 26:00.680]  shot and now you can go outside, yeah, you got to take a PCR test, yeah, you still got
[26:00.680 --> 26:04.360]  to wear a mask, yeah, you got to take more shots but you're free now, you're free to
[26:04.360 --> 26:09.560]  wear a mask and scan and take more injections, you see and then they call that freedom, it's
[26:09.560 --> 26:15.520]  all over the news, oh, you're free now, you're free as long as you do X, Y, Z.
[26:15.520 --> 26:20.040]  So that's in the movies, that's in the culture, you know it, the movie but you understand
[26:20.040 --> 26:24.960]  what's happening in the real world, just like Biden's here to crush us and enslave us and
[26:24.960 --> 26:29.080]  we hate him, he'll be removed, the saviors will be sent in, just like Hitler was created
[26:29.080 --> 26:34.240]  and funded and told he could take over Europe and there was a secret treaty with the British
[26:34.240 --> 26:39.760]  Empire and then they double crossed him, that's in mainline history, it's just buried, that's
[26:39.760 --> 26:44.480]  why the deputy Fyrr Rudolf Hess flew in and parachuted into the palace and got locked
[26:44.480 --> 26:48.120]  up the rest of his life in the Tower of London because they couldn't let him out with the
[26:48.120 --> 26:53.280]  actual treaty as the witness to it being signed with Edward VIII, the King of England and
[26:53.280 --> 27:00.960]  then Nebel Chamberlain, Prime Minister of England, this is the real world folks, so you go watch
[27:00.960 --> 27:05.640]  the original Dune or read the book and he sends in a strong man to crush people and
[27:05.640 --> 27:10.600]  dominate them so that they then accept another tyrant who's just not as bad but now you're
[27:10.600 --> 27:14.400]  in a new world, the Overton window's been moved to, total genocide, total enslavement,
[27:14.400 --> 27:19.000]  death murder for five years and then oh you'll accept a tyrant that has checkpoints and curfews
[27:19.000 --> 27:25.200]  and executes people and everything but it's still not as bad as total extermination.
[27:25.200 --> 27:26.200]  See how that works?
[27:26.200 --> 27:30.480]  So I know people don't care about real news or real info, some people, so I'll just give
[27:30.480 --> 27:33.520]  you a Hollywood example of what's really going on.
[27:33.520 --> 27:41.720]  Now here's Biden a week ago saying it's bull, nobody is going to give $450,000 to people
[27:41.720 --> 27:47.040]  separated from their children, a million dollars per family and then he goes, okay, it's true,
[27:47.040 --> 27:51.000]  if the children are separated, if the children are separated, oh so when a SWAT team raids
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.560]  the house with a warrant, the kids are separated for five minutes, they get a million dollars?
[27:55.560 --> 27:59.160]  What about people separated from their loved ones under the fake COVID lockdowns with not
[27:59.160 --> 28:03.000]  able to see them in nursing homes for a year, do they get a hundred billion dollars?
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.720]  No this is to incentivize illegals coming here, so here's Biden flip-flopping with his
[28:07.720 --> 28:08.720]  dementia.
[28:08.720 --> 28:13.640]  Your administration is planning to pay illegal immigrants who are separated from their families
[28:13.640 --> 28:19.280]  at the border up to $450,000 each, possibly a million dollars per family.
[28:19.280 --> 28:20.280]  But it's not true.
[28:20.280 --> 28:22.280]  So this is a garbage report?
[28:22.280 --> 28:23.280]  Yeah.
[28:23.280 --> 28:24.280]  Okay, so.
[28:24.280 --> 28:27.280]  $450,000 per person, is that what you're saying?
[28:27.280 --> 28:32.920]  That was separated from a family member at the border under the last administration.
[28:32.920 --> 28:33.920]  That's not going to happen.
[28:33.920 --> 28:34.920]  Where do you stand?
[28:34.920 --> 28:40.800]  You said last week that this report about migrant families at the border getting payments
[28:40.800 --> 28:41.800]  was garbage.
[28:41.800 --> 28:42.800]  No, I didn't say that.
[28:42.800 --> 28:43.800]  Let's get it straight.
[28:43.800 --> 28:48.800]  You said everybody coming across the border gets $450,000.
[28:48.800 --> 28:51.680]  The number was what you had a problem with.
[28:51.680 --> 28:52.680]  The number does me for fun.
[28:52.680 --> 28:53.680]  Okay.
[28:53.680 --> 28:54.680]  Now here's the thing.
[28:54.680 --> 28:58.400]  We'll be right back with the rest of it, stay with us.

[29:59.200 --> 30:05.840]  If a hurricane is smashing into the Gulf Coast and I make the prediction that it's going
[30:05.840 --> 30:08.600]  to cause flooding, that's not a prediction.
[30:08.600 --> 30:09.600]  You know it's a hurricane.
[30:09.600 --> 30:10.600]  You know it's got a lot of water.
[30:10.600 --> 30:11.600]  It's going to die up.
[30:11.600 --> 30:12.600]  It's going to cause flooding.
[30:12.600 --> 30:17.200]  So it wasn't a prediction 20 months ago when I said the UN order to lock down the world
[30:17.200 --> 30:20.840]  economy is going to cause a chain reaction that's going to cause supply chain problems
[30:20.840 --> 30:21.840]  for years.
[30:21.840 --> 30:23.960]  It's going to starve tens of millions to death.
[30:23.960 --> 30:24.960]  And now it all happened.
[30:24.960 --> 30:29.160]  25 million extra dead, hundreds of millions on the verge of starvation and the UN that
[30:29.160 --> 30:31.280]  ordered it's running around being the savior.
[30:31.280 --> 30:35.240]  Listen, when the first world collapses, the third world dies and now the first world's
[30:35.240 --> 30:36.360]  becoming the third world.
[30:36.360 --> 30:37.760]  So listen to me now.

[31:46.400 --> 31:50.760]  and it funds the InfoWare, which is so important in the fight against the New World Order.
[31:50.760 --> 31:53.640]  So thank you all for your support with supply chain breakdowns.

[31:56.960 --> 31:59.000]  InfoWare at infowarstore.com.

[32:04.320 --> 32:05.320]  life.
[32:05.320 --> 32:09.680]  Ultimate Bone Broth is now Ultimate Bone Broth Plus because we've made it even stronger
[32:09.680 --> 32:14.640]  and reformulated it, and listen, it's not just concentrated chicken broth, and it's
[32:14.640 --> 32:17.680]  so good for your joints, your bones, and your whole body.

[32:24.960 --> 32:30.000]  herb powder, and a bunch of other stuff in it, like real organic cocoa, bean powder with
[32:30.000 --> 32:34.680]  natural chocolate flavor, and a touch of sea salt, and just on and on and on, magnesium,
[32:34.680 --> 32:39.600]  and potassium's added, this is so good for inflammation, for your immune system, for
[32:39.600 --> 32:41.100]  your whole body.
[32:41.100 --> 32:45.320]  Grandma always gave you chicken soup when you were sick, remember, that's a tiny amount
[32:45.320 --> 32:50.200]  of the same stuff that's in there that is now in here in a very large amount.
[32:50.200 --> 32:54.480]  So again, get the power of Grandma's chicken soup with the power of turmeric and everything
[32:54.480 --> 33:02.040]  else with the new and improved Bone Broth at infowarstore.com.
[33:02.040 --> 33:09.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:09.040 --> 33:27.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:27.040 --> 33:37.520]  So, America and the rest of the western world, the once free world, has a new boss, Private
[33:37.520 --> 33:43.160]  Megabanks, that have taken over by their control of the central private banks that they got
[33:43.160 --> 33:50.160]  in place in Europe, about 120 years ago, you're in the United States, about 100, and eight
[33:50.160 --> 33:54.280]  years ago.
[33:54.280 --> 33:58.560]  And they have unlimited money so they can set up the corporations and companies and
[33:58.560 --> 34:01.320]  engineer society the way they want.
[34:01.320 --> 34:06.480]  But in the western world, there was still so much power by the consumer that we could
[34:06.480 --> 34:10.800]  dictate the type of country and world we lived in, and the whole world saw us with swimming
[34:10.800 --> 34:17.880]  pools and jet skis and race cars and helicopters and going to the movies and restaurants everywhere.
[34:17.880 --> 34:21.040]  Things have been like a Disney world, and yeah, it's been decadent, it's been out of
[34:21.040 --> 34:24.160]  control, it's been wasteful, it's had a lot of problems.
[34:24.160 --> 34:27.680]  Consumerism in and of itself for consumerism is bad.
[34:27.680 --> 34:31.880]  But the very globalists telling us they've got a new system to clean that up, or the
[34:31.880 --> 34:38.760]  worst of that system, and they're heavily connected constantly, can't shake a stick
[34:38.760 --> 34:43.320]  at them, can't swing a stick in the dark without hitting a pedophile.
[34:43.320 --> 34:46.840]  Because that's what decadent corrupt elites have always been into, because that's the
[34:46.840 --> 34:54.080]  last taboo, and that's going against God, and it's just, it's how you get in the club.
[34:54.080 --> 34:57.480]  And so these are the people taking over and running our world.
[34:57.480 --> 35:01.880]  I mean, you see these British royalty, and you see these Davos group people, I mean you're
[35:01.880 --> 35:09.520]  looking at, makes the people in eyes wide shut look like squares.
[35:09.520 --> 35:11.840]  You think eyes wide shut's racy?
[35:11.840 --> 35:16.520]  Hell, I got drugged into a couple of those things when I was a teenager, that's just
[35:16.520 --> 35:20.560]  part of the course with the rich people.
[35:20.560 --> 35:26.840]  That's nothing, nothing.
[35:26.840 --> 35:29.560]  And so we're either going to wake up to this or it's game over.
[35:29.560 --> 35:32.320]  I tried to go to the clip earlier, but I forgot the break was coming up soon.
[35:32.320 --> 35:33.320]  So let's replay.
[35:33.320 --> 35:35.120]  This is Biden a week ago.
[35:35.120 --> 35:36.120]  Just go on.
[35:36.120 --> 35:37.120]  What?
[35:37.120 --> 35:38.120]  Are you kidding me?
[35:38.120 --> 35:43.560]  We're not giving a half million dollars or whatever to people that got separated from
[35:43.560 --> 35:46.880]  their kids, because he doesn't know all this.
[35:46.880 --> 35:49.960]  He plays Mario Kart and poops his pants.
[35:49.960 --> 35:54.440]  I mean, I've talked to Secret Service separately from inside the White House and his detail
[35:54.440 --> 35:56.720]  going around the country.
[35:56.720 --> 36:01.600]  And the story from the Secret Service out of D.C. is he runs around out of his mind
[36:01.600 --> 36:07.200]  all night in a robe in his underwear, and he just comes in to like work offices and
[36:07.200 --> 36:11.080]  just starts talking to people that doesn't really know who he is and telling weird jokes
[36:11.080 --> 36:13.080]  and just clearly out of his mind.
[36:13.080 --> 36:16.960]  I mean, they're not making these stories up, but just that he's out of his mind.
[36:16.960 --> 36:21.280]  And then he's up at all hours the night wandering around on the complete other side of the White
[36:21.280 --> 36:22.280]  House.
[36:22.280 --> 36:26.040]  And yes, they said, you know, saying, quote, he's looking for the bathroom.
[36:26.040 --> 36:27.040]  That was one of them.
[36:27.040 --> 36:28.040]  They just say he wanders around.
[36:28.040 --> 36:29.800]  He's obsessed with that.
[36:29.800 --> 36:36.560]  And now it's in mainstream news that he just basically like a Monty Python or Benny Hill
[36:36.560 --> 36:44.960]  joke or an Ace Ventura joke was just like, on and on and on and smelled terribly.
[36:44.960 --> 36:47.200]  That's mainstream news.
[36:47.200 --> 36:52.120]  So you see, they're setting him up for a fall because they're setting America up for a fall.
[36:52.120 --> 36:54.000]  So I don't think it's funny.
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.400]  You know, the let's go Brandon thing.
[36:55.400 --> 36:56.400]  That's okay.
[36:56.400 --> 36:57.560]  It makes a joke out of it.
[36:57.560 --> 37:00.520]  But but it's deadly, deadly serious.
[37:00.520 --> 37:04.760]  Loopy pants, Biden trends on Twitter, his rumor claims bathroom mishap explains long
[37:04.760 --> 37:06.200]  meeting with Pope Francis.
[37:06.200 --> 37:11.000]  Yeah, the new news is this since we're already on this story.
[37:11.000 --> 37:16.960]  News of Cornwall, that's Camilla Parker bulls on Biden's farting and climate summit long
[37:16.960 --> 37:19.960]  loud and impossible to ignore.
[37:19.960 --> 37:23.680]  That's being reported by the Daily Mail and a bunch of other publications.
[37:23.680 --> 37:25.400]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[37:25.400 --> 37:27.280]  Kamala hasn't stopped talking about it.
[37:27.280 --> 37:33.200]  Hearing President break wind during chat at their great reset summit.
[37:33.200 --> 37:39.880]  And of course, you've got the again, thunderous chance of F Joe Biden breaks out during UFC
[37:39.880 --> 37:41.840]  268.
[37:41.840 --> 37:43.480]  He stole the election.
[37:43.480 --> 37:48.880]  But we all know that now and the idea that we're terrifically say it is just ridiculous
[37:48.880 --> 37:49.880]  gaslighting.
[37:49.880 --> 37:51.400]  But now let us move away from that.
[37:51.400 --> 37:52.760]  I've set the table here.
[37:52.760 --> 37:57.240]  Oh, by the way, you know, normally I'm here for two hours on Sunday nights, four to six
[37:57.240 --> 37:58.960]  p.m. central, five to seven Eastern.
[37:58.960 --> 38:01.120]  Oh, I'm here for four hours tonight.
[38:01.120 --> 38:04.880]  I'm doing Sunday live that no one usually host six to eight p.m.
[38:04.880 --> 38:08.680]  That's some very special interviews and more coming up six to eight p.m. tonight.
[38:08.680 --> 38:14.560]  So we've got plenty of time, but I've dispensed with the pleasantries.
[38:14.560 --> 38:17.840]  And so let me do this right now, because this is really, really important.
[38:17.840 --> 38:21.080]  Oh, I need to get the bite and put that's right when we come back.
[38:21.080 --> 38:27.000]  I will get to the the case filed by Texas, Louisiana and other states that the fifth
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.480]  circuit Court of Appeals looked at and said they have serious cause and serious constitutional
[38:31.480 --> 38:36.720]  issues that they've basically proven in their filing on its face.
[38:36.720 --> 38:40.760]  And if the Supreme Court shoots this down, well, you know how screwed we are.
[38:40.760 --> 38:45.120]  But that's what Robert Barnes, the lawyers on my show, warned people that Kavanaugh is
[38:45.120 --> 38:50.840]  an authoritarian, that Amy Comey Barrett is an authoritarian.
[38:50.840 --> 38:56.360]  I mean, she cited cases that allowed the sterilization of mentally retarded children
[38:56.360 --> 39:02.880]  and stuff to like, say no to people that file cases in the Supreme Court that she only
[39:02.880 --> 39:08.320]  heard, you know, deciding if the higher ups would hear it, and she said, no, we're gonna
[39:08.320 --> 39:10.400]  go ahead with forced inoculations.
[39:10.400 --> 39:16.920]  So I wouldn't hold your breath on this, but if the Supreme Court says that they can mandate
[39:16.920 --> 39:21.000]  these shots when the executive branch orders it, it's one thing to have a private business
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.320]  say to work here, you got to do this, but when a bunch of private businesses link together
[39:25.320 --> 39:29.040]  to try to make you do it, that's a cartel, that's that's racketeering.
[39:29.040 --> 39:34.120]  And when government does it, my God, on its face, it's unconstitutional, it's illegal,
[39:34.120 --> 39:37.640]  violates the Nuremberg code on its face.
[39:37.640 --> 39:39.240]  So we're going to get to that next segment.
[39:39.240 --> 39:44.600]  But first, since I mentioned it, here is Biden.
[39:44.600 --> 39:48.880]  And the big takeaway from this, he's not been picked up by the press, he legitimately did
[39:48.880 --> 39:56.280]  not know a week ago, about eight days ago, that it'd been the news for months that his
[39:56.280 --> 40:00.480]  administration had said $450,000 per family.
[40:00.480 --> 40:03.920]  Now be one thing of jail guards and rape kids, they took away from parents, that never happened,
[40:03.920 --> 40:08.600]  like AOC tried to say, or if kids were drinking out of toilets or something, but that didn't
[40:08.600 --> 40:11.400]  ever happen.
[40:11.400 --> 40:16.000]  And so Biden's up there saying, that's just ridiculous, that's bull.
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.840]  And then a week later, well, yeah, they're separated from their parents, because then
[40:19.840 --> 40:20.840]  they came to him.
[40:20.840 --> 40:28.360]  And notice, a couple of days after he said that eight days ago, Jean Pierre, the deputy
[40:28.360 --> 40:34.600]  press secretary, talk about an arrogant, talk about a liar, you know, but she actually
[40:34.600 --> 40:39.040]  told the truth this time and said, oh yeah, we're giving them $450,000, because that's
[40:39.040 --> 40:44.040]  to get the caravans even bigger, not the hundreds of thousands slamming in every few days, not
[40:44.040 --> 40:48.240]  the video of the Mexican troops again this week, thousands of Mexican troops just overrun
[40:48.240 --> 40:55.040]  by a crowd of over 100,000 stampeding them, fewer in critical condition, almost dead by
[40:55.040 --> 40:56.040]  being run over.
[40:56.040 --> 40:59.840]  I mean, our borders are being broken by the UN and the globalist.
[40:59.840 --> 41:04.640]  And then they go on the news and they say, this is being done because of global warming,
[41:04.640 --> 41:06.240]  no one has any food down there.
[41:06.240 --> 41:08.640]  No, the global lockdown caused it.
[41:08.640 --> 41:13.000]  That's what the surveys show, nine out of 10 in these migrant caravans say, we're locked
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.200]  down, no one buys our crops anymore, we don't have any food, we have to come north.
[41:17.200 --> 41:21.960]  I don't even blame these people, but once the third world completely collapses and we
[41:21.960 --> 41:25.600]  haven't stopped them and the world knows they can come here, it's not going to be a million
[41:25.600 --> 41:29.600]  every month, it's going to be 10, 20 million every month, that's what the UN said in the
[41:29.600 --> 41:33.600]  replacement migration documents, just type in replacement migration into the UN's own
[41:33.600 --> 41:36.920]  search engine on their website and you'll read thousands of pages about how they were
[41:36.920 --> 41:42.480]  going to do this with 640 million they want to bring to America alone, 220 million to
[41:42.480 --> 41:47.160]  France from Africa alone that they'll control.
[41:47.160 --> 41:51.360]  That's how the globalists are conquering us with migration and collapsed countries.
[41:51.360 --> 41:52.360]  Here's Biden.
[41:52.360 --> 41:56.800]  The administration is planning to pay illegal immigrants who are separated from their families
[41:56.800 --> 42:02.560]  at the border up to $450,000 each, possibly a million dollars per family.
[42:02.560 --> 42:03.560]  But it's not true.
[42:03.560 --> 42:05.560]  So this is a garbage report.
[42:05.560 --> 42:06.560]  Yeah.
[42:06.560 --> 42:10.960]  Okay, so $450,000 per person, is that what you're saying?
[42:10.960 --> 42:16.120]  That was separated from a family member at the border under the last administration.
[42:16.120 --> 42:17.360]  This is not going to happen.
[42:17.360 --> 42:18.360]  Where do you stand?
[42:18.360 --> 42:23.960]  You said last week that this report about migrant families at the border getting payments
[42:23.960 --> 42:24.960]  was garbage.
[42:24.960 --> 42:26.440]  No, I didn't say that.
[42:26.440 --> 42:29.880]  You said everybody coming across the border gets $450,000.
[42:29.880 --> 42:31.680]  The number was what you had a problem.
[42:31.680 --> 42:34.360]  The number was what you were referring to.
[42:34.360 --> 42:35.360]  Okay.
[42:35.360 --> 42:43.460]  Now here's the thing, if in fact because of the outrageous behavior of the last administration,
[42:43.460 --> 42:49.060]  You coming across border whether it was legal or illegal and you lost your child, you lost
[42:49.060 --> 42:51.380]  your child, it's gone.
[42:51.380 --> 42:55.180]  You deserve some kind of compensation no matter what the circumstances are.
[42:55.180 --> 42:56.180]  Yep, there you go.
[42:56.180 --> 42:58.780]  You have no idea.
[42:58.780 --> 43:03.220]  Ultimate.
[43:03.220 --> 43:06.460]  It's now becoming accepted knowledge.
[43:06.460 --> 43:10.900]  Accepted fact that global government run by private corporations is taking over the
[43:10.900 --> 43:13.940]  United States and other formerly sovereign nations.
[43:13.940 --> 43:15.060]  They're being destroyed.
[43:15.060 --> 43:19.300]  All the checks and balances are being annihilated, our borders are being destroyed, our currency
[43:19.300 --> 43:23.140]  is being destroyed, and the American people have been listed as terrorists by the rogue
[43:23.140 --> 43:24.980]  federal government.
[43:24.980 --> 43:28.140]  Info wars is going to continue to fight on and there is a big awakening happening.
[43:28.140 --> 43:31.100]  We have a good chance of beating these people, but we're not going to be able to stay on
[43:31.100 --> 43:33.300]  air unless you support us and you've been doing it.
[43:33.300 --> 43:37.660]  So spread the word about the broadcast, pray for the broadcast, but also buy great products

[44:03.460 --> 44:07.740]  why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth and we could never
[44:07.740 --> 44:12.780]  get the ingredients again until now and we have reformulated and not just used the same
[44:12.780 --> 44:16.460]  ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.

[44:20.140 --> 44:21.620]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[44:21.620 --> 44:26.660]  Cutting-edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[44:26.660 --> 44:31.580]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and
[44:31.580 --> 44:36.180]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbocharge your body with antioxidants and
[44:36.180 --> 44:39.700]  then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium
[44:39.700 --> 44:40.700]  added.
[44:40.700 --> 44:42.780]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[44:42.780 --> 44:47.220]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch
[44:47.220 --> 44:49.220]  of sea salt and it just goes on and on.
[44:49.220 --> 44:51.060]  It is now back in stock.

[44:56.020 --> 45:02.300]  infowarstore.com after being unavailable for more than two years.
[45:02.300 --> 45:05.340]  Ultimate Bone Broth is back at Info Wars Live.
[45:05.340 --> 45:09.980]  Ultimate Bone Broth is now Ultimate Bone Broth Plus because we've made it even stronger and
[45:09.980 --> 45:10.980]  reformulated it.
[45:10.980 --> 45:15.500]  And listen, it's not just concentrated chicken broth in there that's so good for your joints
[45:15.500 --> 45:17.700]  and your bones and your whole body.
[45:17.700 --> 45:24.940]  It's got really strong high-end turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa
[45:24.940 --> 45:30.020]  herb powder and a bunch of other stuff in it like real organic cocoa, bean powder with

[45:35.460 --> 45:36.460]  added.
[45:36.460 --> 45:41.020]  This is so good for inflammation, for your immune system, for your whole body.
[45:41.020 --> 45:43.260]  Grandma always gave you chicken soup when you were sick.
[45:43.260 --> 45:48.060]  Remember, that's a tiny amount of the same stuff that's in there that is now in here
[45:48.060 --> 45:50.100]  in a very large amount.
[45:50.100 --> 45:54.420]  So again, get the power of Grandma's chicken soup with the power of turmeric and everything
[45:54.420 --> 45:58.860]  else with the new and improved Bone Broth at infowarstore.com.
[45:58.860 --> 46:05.460]  The hurricane is smashing into the Gulf Coast and I make the prediction that it's going
[46:05.460 --> 46:06.700]  to cause flooding.
[46:06.700 --> 46:08.200]  That's not a prediction.
[46:08.200 --> 46:09.200]  You know it's a hurricane.
[46:09.200 --> 46:10.200]  You know it's got a lot of water.
[46:10.200 --> 46:11.200]  It's going to die up.
[46:11.200 --> 46:12.200]  It's going to cause flooding.
[46:12.200 --> 46:16.820]  So it wasn't a prediction 20 months ago when I said the U.N. order to lock down the world
[46:16.820 --> 46:20.460]  economy is going to cause a chain reaction that's going to cause supply chain problems
[46:20.460 --> 46:21.460]  for years.
[46:21.460 --> 46:24.780]  It's going to starve tens of millions to death and now it all happened.
[46:24.780 --> 46:28.820]  25 million extra dead, hundreds of millions on the verge of starvation and the U.N. that
[46:28.820 --> 46:30.780]  ordered it's running around being the savior.
[46:30.780 --> 46:34.900]  Listen, when the first world collapses, the third world dies and now the first world's
[46:34.900 --> 46:35.980]  becoming the third world.
[46:35.980 --> 46:37.700]  So listen to me now.
[46:37.700 --> 46:40.660]  We've got the highest quality storeable foods, the lowest price you're going to find ready

[46:44.180 --> 46:46.420]  But after that, the prices are going up.
[46:46.420 --> 46:48.940]  We cannot suppress prices anymore.
[46:48.940 --> 46:52.940]  So protect yourself, get high quality storeable food, so you're self-sufficient and fund the
[46:52.940 --> 46:56.380]  info war today at 361 at infowarstore.com.
[46:56.380 --> 47:01.180]  It's time to get your food.
[47:01.180 --> 47:27.860]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:27.860 --> 47:32.860]  Here we are on Sunday night.
[47:32.860 --> 47:36.500]  Let's plow in to the big story.
[47:36.500 --> 47:39.300]  This happened Saturday.
[47:39.300 --> 47:44.540]  We learned the news breaking federal court of appeals temporarily blocks Biden's vaccine
[47:44.540 --> 47:45.540]  mandate.
[47:45.540 --> 47:49.100]  And this isn't like the private businesses and some of the colleges and schools that
[47:49.100 --> 47:50.100]  fall.
[47:50.100 --> 47:56.340]  This was a bunch of states and also a bunch of businesses and companies.
[47:56.340 --> 47:58.900]  But what did the court say?
[47:58.900 --> 48:07.860]  Well, the court said that it was so constitutionally dangerous and so threatening and basically
[48:07.860 --> 48:15.860]  on its face what was going on was so obviously unconstitutional that they were putting in
[48:15.860 --> 48:22.260]  the emergency injunction and that Biden had until Monday evening to respond to it.
[48:22.260 --> 48:27.140]  Because if you know about the Bill of Rights Constitution in common sense or the Nuremberg
[48:27.140 --> 48:32.260]  Code, international law, what's going on is illegal as hell.
[48:32.260 --> 48:44.500]  And so it's Joe Biden getting up on C-SPAN seven years ago and saying I was over in Ukraine.
[48:44.500 --> 48:47.220]  The prosecutor was investigating me and my son.
[48:47.220 --> 48:51.100]  I told him you better fire him by the time I fly out of here in six hours or we're not
[48:51.100 --> 48:54.580]  going to give you a billion dollars and son of a bitch, they fired him.
[48:54.580 --> 48:55.860]  We gave him a billion dollars.
[48:55.860 --> 48:57.940]  That's called bribery on TV.
[48:57.940 --> 49:01.780]  That's like, oh, hey, I killed somebody five years ago.
[49:01.780 --> 49:04.660]  They're buried back there in my backyard and the cops go dig up a dead body.
[49:04.660 --> 49:07.020]  I mean, it's just rubbing it in our faces.
[49:07.020 --> 49:09.500]  That's what criminals do.
[49:09.500 --> 49:15.540]  So here's the actual United States Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit and you can see the
[49:15.540 --> 49:22.620]  state of Texas and the state of Mississippi and a bunch of others did this, a bunch of
[49:22.620 --> 49:26.820]  big churches, Daystar, television network, man, I tell you, they're fighting the force
[49:26.820 --> 49:27.820]  inoculations.
[49:27.820 --> 49:29.260]  They're doing a great job.
[49:29.260 --> 49:33.340]  Those are some good people right there.
[49:33.340 --> 49:34.580]  And then let's read to you right here.
[49:34.580 --> 49:39.420]  This is a cause, law and legal definition.
[49:39.420 --> 49:41.340]  And let's read the legal definition.
[49:41.340 --> 49:44.740]  Occupational Safety and Health Administration, United States Department of Labor, United
[49:44.740 --> 49:49.620]  States Department of Labor, Martin J. Walsh, Secretary of the Department of Labor, Douglas
[49:49.620 --> 49:54.300]  Parker, Ms. Official Capacity and Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety
[49:54.300 --> 49:59.780]  and Health, respondents, partitions for review of Occupational Safety and Health Administration
[49:59.780 --> 50:07.180]  Emergency Temporary Standard, notice this, Emergency Temporary Standard, before Jones
[50:07.180 --> 50:13.300]  Duncan, Engelhardt, Circuit Judges, Purcurium.
[50:13.300 --> 50:18.460]  Before the court is the petitioner's emergency motions to stay enforcement of the Occupational
[50:18.460 --> 50:22.580]  Safety and Health Administration, November 5th, 2021, Emergency Temporary Standard,
[50:22.580 --> 50:29.100]  the mandate, which is an emergency pending expedited judicial review.
[50:29.100 --> 50:39.260]  Because the petition gives cause, because the petitioners give cause to believe there
[50:39.260 --> 50:44.420]  are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the mandate, the mandate is hereby stayed
[50:44.420 --> 50:47.220]  pending further action by the court.
[50:47.220 --> 50:51.820]  Now give cause, cause means standing, or you're right, or you have a reason to do it.
[50:51.820 --> 51:03.700]  And it says they've given cause here, and have raised grave constitutional issues.
[51:03.700 --> 51:11.260]  You see that, because the petition, petitions gave cause to believe there are grave statutory
[51:11.260 --> 51:19.020]  and constitutional issues with the mandate, grave.
[51:19.020 --> 51:21.820]  That's why they made all this experimental, they knew exactly what they were doing, they
[51:21.820 --> 51:24.940]  knew about the heart problems, they knew about it all.
[51:24.940 --> 51:30.100]  Here's the CNN globalist piece against it, Federal Appeals Court issues, stay-of-bide
[51:30.100 --> 51:34.700]  administration's vaccine mandate for private companies, and it goes on, the U.S. Department
[51:34.700 --> 51:40.340]  of Labor is confident in its legal authority to issue the emergency temporary standard
[51:40.340 --> 51:46.580]  on vaccination and testing, oh, I mean they could issue the emergency temporary standard
[51:46.580 --> 51:51.980]  on vaccination and testing, because there's no law that's been able to be passed, because
[51:51.980 --> 51:56.900]  there's an emergency, like if there's a chemical spill, or a big fire, or whatever, and then
[51:56.900 --> 52:03.620]  OSHA can come in with emergency rules, say suspending rules on things you normally have
[52:03.620 --> 52:07.740]  to do in a factory, because they've got to suspend the rules, so emergency workers can
[52:07.740 --> 52:10.820]  go in and put the fire out.
[52:10.820 --> 52:15.700]  But see, this is a permanent emergency, where here we are 20-something months later, and
[52:15.700 --> 52:20.260]  a virus cooked up by the globalist has been released, and it's been the pretext to suspend
[52:20.260 --> 52:25.540]  normal rights, to quote, blow up the regular authorization system at the FDA, as Fauci
[52:25.540 --> 52:31.420]  said, and to bring in all this experimental garbage onto the public, that only Western
[52:31.420 --> 52:38.380]  countries are taking, nobody else will dare take this, not China, not India, no, not Brazil,
[52:38.380 --> 52:43.020]  we get the special death shot, because we're to be taken out.
[52:43.020 --> 52:49.140]  And so again, this is all done under emergency auspices, because then it's outside of law,
[52:49.140 --> 52:58.100]  so we always talk about FEMA bringing in martial law in the statutes, that Congress did pass,
[52:58.100 --> 53:03.740]  that during a nuclear war, or a meteorite, or a supervolcano, or huge earthquakes, if
[53:03.740 --> 53:08.980]  regular governance is suspended, and regular government and private corporations can't
[53:08.980 --> 53:15.420]  operate, then an emergency is declared, a national emergency, and the Army's putting
[53:15.420 --> 53:18.740]  the streets and the rest of it, it's a fancy name for martial law.
[53:18.740 --> 53:25.100]  So they're invoking all those clauses by declaring this emergency, and the only emergency is
[53:25.100 --> 53:28.460]  Congress isn't standing up and saying no, and the governors aren't standing up and saying
[53:28.460 --> 53:31.460]  no, and the people aren't standing up and saying no, and saying, this thing has a lesser
[53:31.460 --> 53:35.420]  chance of killing you than the flu, but the vaccine has a much higher chance of killing
[53:35.420 --> 53:39.900]  you, here's the British Medical Journal's own numbers from a month ago.
[53:39.900 --> 53:46.380]  The emergency is that they've declared an emergency, and are coming after us, and now
[53:46.380 --> 53:50.340]  Bloomberg and all of them are like, oh, COVID's permanent, we're never going to stop giving
[53:50.340 --> 53:54.500]  you the shots, and COVID's never going away, and you've got to take shots a couple of times
[53:54.500 --> 53:58.700]  a year, and you've always got to wear a mask, and you've got to have checkpoints, and you
[53:58.700 --> 54:01.660]  got to have an app on your phone to say when you can travel or go anywhere, I mean this
[54:01.660 --> 54:06.380]  is just a nightmare of control, all being brought in globally by the UN and the Davos
[54:06.380 --> 54:10.820]  group that have set the standards that our own government is now adopting.
[54:10.820 --> 54:17.940]  I met Ron Paul right about last week that in the infrastructure bill, and it passed,
[54:17.940 --> 54:25.860]  is this unifying standard medical identifier number that is now being used for this, and
[54:25.860 --> 54:31.860]  is now being established that is in line with the UN approved Davos group system.
[54:31.860 --> 54:37.140]  And what did Gigi Ping 20 months ago say, he said, we must have the UN approved global
[54:37.140 --> 54:42.900]  unified QR code system, and it's the QR system that the communist Chinese government developed
[54:42.900 --> 54:47.780]  and created and implemented, and you can even look it up that the UN Davos group global
[54:47.780 --> 54:50.300]  standard is run by the communist Chinese.
[54:50.300 --> 54:52.940]  Wow, talk about a coup.
[54:52.940 --> 54:56.980]  You cook it up, you release it, you have your operatives in control through big tech, you
[54:56.980 --> 55:01.060]  censor the opposition, you even censor the House and the Senate and governors that speak
[55:01.060 --> 55:05.900]  out against it, and then you roll this thing out with a world ID and a world tax and world
[55:05.900 --> 55:11.460]  regulations and a global social credit score tied to the carbon tax, and it's all officially
[55:11.460 --> 55:12.460]  announced.
[55:12.460 --> 55:18.020]  Two weeks ago, I played you Davos group video press releases bragging how the UN standardized
[55:18.020 --> 55:23.260]  this with China and how the world is now adopting this world ID through your smartphone, and
[55:23.260 --> 55:26.460]  how soon it will be an implantable chip under your damn skin.
[55:26.460 --> 55:30.260]  I mean, it's all been announced.
[55:30.260 --> 55:38.940]  Hell, it's all over the news now, and then finally, some states get together and stand
[55:38.940 --> 55:39.940]  up against it.
[55:39.940 --> 55:44.300]  Thank God.
[55:44.300 --> 55:46.580]  So go back to where this hour started.
[55:46.580 --> 55:49.380]  New polls suggest GOP victory in 2022.
[55:49.380 --> 55:56.100]  Biden approval stinks and sinks to 38% while Kamala's is even worse.
[55:56.100 --> 55:57.100]  That's just a good poll.
[55:57.100 --> 55:59.860]  A lot of them have got him at 30 points, but it doesn't matter.
[55:59.860 --> 56:04.100]  He was put in there, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:04.100 --> 56:06.180]  He was placed in there.
[56:06.180 --> 56:07.180]  So he'll take the blame.
[56:07.180 --> 56:08.740]  Doesn't mean I don't hate him.
[56:08.740 --> 56:11.140]  Doesn't mean I don't hope he gets impeached, whatever.
[56:11.140 --> 56:14.420]  The point is, is that he's just their front man.
[56:14.420 --> 56:16.580]  A lot of good news.
[56:16.580 --> 56:20.620]  Dana White refuses to mandate COVID vaccinations for the UFC fighters.
[56:20.620 --> 56:21.780]  This is a free country.
[56:21.780 --> 56:22.780]  You do what you want.
[56:22.780 --> 56:26.780]  He says he will defy it, and that's indentured servitude.
[56:26.780 --> 56:33.860]  It makes him an agent of the government, which federal regulators have said.
[56:33.860 --> 56:39.540]  And Biden's executive directive to OSHA says they are federal officers now.
[56:39.540 --> 56:43.340]  Oh, you're a federal deputy now with all the liability and all the problems that come
[56:43.340 --> 56:45.620]  with it.
[56:45.620 --> 56:46.940]  But it's not our federal government.
[56:46.940 --> 56:49.340]  We'll play that clip next hour with Dana White.
[56:49.340 --> 56:50.340]  He's a great guy.
[56:50.340 --> 56:51.340]  I got to meet him a few times.
[56:51.340 --> 56:53.900]  Really nice.
[56:53.900 --> 56:57.620]  People don't know the special fund exists, zero-hedge reports.
[56:57.620 --> 57:02.140]  Feds pay zero claims for COVID-19 vaccine injury deaths, even though they're several
[57:02.140 --> 57:07.980]  thousand percent higher than any other vaccine death rate, according to VAERS.
[57:07.980 --> 57:09.940]  Because they're claiming, well, that was authorized.
[57:09.940 --> 57:13.980]  Approved vaccines get the 1986 vaccine act.
[57:13.980 --> 57:14.980]  This isn't approved.
[57:14.980 --> 57:15.980]  It's experimental.
[57:15.980 --> 57:21.100]  So we have liability protection, and you don't get paid when you get sick or die.
[57:21.100 --> 57:22.100]  Wow.
[57:22.100 --> 57:24.980]  So we got a whole bunch of news on this front coming up next hour, and then I'll get into
[57:24.980 --> 57:25.980]  it.
[57:25.980 --> 57:27.420]  James O'Keeffe got raided by the FBI.
[57:27.420 --> 57:28.420]  Not just Veritas.
[57:28.420 --> 57:29.420]  He got raided yesterday.
[57:29.420 --> 57:31.500]  A total attack on journalism.
[57:31.500 --> 57:33.980]  That's all coming up in the next hour.
[57:33.980 --> 57:38.860]  And so much more on the economy, a video of Mexican soldiers retreat from ferocious battle
[57:38.860 --> 57:40.900]  with caravan migrants.
[57:40.900 --> 57:43.140]  Stay with us and tell everybody, you know, tune in.
[57:43.140 --> 57:45.820]  That's how we override the censors is when you take action.
[57:45.820 --> 57:47.820]  Stay with us.
[57:47.820 --> 57:48.820]  I never compromise.
[57:48.820 --> 57:54.320]  I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of Thursday, November 4th, 2021.

[58:31.260 --> 58:32.260]  we had.

[1:00:17.060 --> 1:00:21.140]  All right, folks, let's do this.
[1:00:21.140 --> 1:00:27.140]  I want to get to the rest of the really important COVID news in the next segment that's longer,
[1:00:27.140 --> 1:00:31.980]  because there's a lot of it here, and it's very important.
[1:00:31.980 --> 1:00:38.700]  But I also wanted to get to a few of these clips we haven't gotten to that are just amazing.
[1:00:38.700 --> 1:00:39.700]  Let's play this clip.
[1:00:39.700 --> 1:00:41.060]  It's clip two.
[1:00:41.060 --> 1:00:46.540]  It's despite high vaccination rate, COVID is surging in Ireland, and then I've got
[1:00:46.540 --> 1:00:54.700]  some graphs in Ireland, and I've got some graphs in Vermont of Elyseus here in my stack
[1:00:54.700 --> 1:01:00.060]  that we'll go to here in a moment, but the more injected you are, the higher rates of
[1:01:00.060 --> 1:01:07.060]  COVID you have, the higher rates of hospitalization, higher rates of death.
[1:01:07.060 --> 1:01:10.060]  That reminds me of what I meant to start the show with today, but I got distracted by just
[1:01:10.060 --> 1:01:12.740]  how much news I've gotten in front of me.
[1:01:12.740 --> 1:01:17.580]  I have talked on air, obviously, to most the big prominent well-known prestigious scientists
[1:01:17.580 --> 1:01:22.420]  and doctors that have been speaking out against the COVID tyranny, but now there's so many
[1:01:22.420 --> 1:01:23.420]  speaking up.
[1:01:23.420 --> 1:01:27.420]  I learn about hundreds of new ones every week that are prominent, and they've had a lot
[1:01:27.420 --> 1:01:32.860]  of big conferences around the country and around the world, and when I meet these doctors
[1:01:32.860 --> 1:01:39.100]  in person or I have them on the show and I'm talking to them during the breaks, I can punch
[1:01:39.100 --> 1:01:43.060]  it up and talk to them on their own Skype or Zoom or on the phone, they're like, Alex,
[1:01:43.060 --> 1:01:44.060]  we all know you're right.
[1:01:44.060 --> 1:01:48.060]  We know they cooked it up and released it, and the vaccine's the cover for the further
[1:01:48.060 --> 1:01:49.060]  due population.
[1:01:49.060 --> 1:01:52.780]  They're releasing new, more powerful weapons, and all the healthcare people we know know,
[1:01:52.780 --> 1:01:58.220]  and basically 90% of us are awake, but people are scared to be fired or lose their license,
[1:01:58.220 --> 1:02:03.380]  and I mean, I understand that not everybody's doctor is a lingo or a doctor merit or others,
[1:02:03.380 --> 1:02:09.500]  but or doctor Fleming, and I really respect all these prominent scientists that are coming
[1:02:09.500 --> 1:02:12.820]  out and doctors, but we're going to have to admit what's really going on and we're going
[1:02:12.820 --> 1:02:18.060]  to lose society, because I understand it's hard for the public to get their mind around
[1:02:18.060 --> 1:02:23.660]  this, but the scientists and doctors and prestigious, I mean, Dr. Yedon, the former head of Pfizer
[1:02:23.660 --> 1:02:28.100]  said it is a depopulation weapon over a year ago, so that's the reality.
[1:02:28.100 --> 1:02:36.180]  As part of that report, despite high injection rates, COVID is surging in Scotland, in Ireland.
[1:02:36.180 --> 1:02:41.140]  The way it's gone at the minute is like, we all seem to know somebody who has COVID.
[1:02:41.140 --> 1:02:46.020]  Waterford is mirroring the COVID situation across Ireland at the moment.
[1:02:46.020 --> 1:02:50.820]  Extremely high vaccine uptake, but stubbornly high infection rates.
[1:02:50.820 --> 1:02:53.940]  Local man Tom Gallagher nearly died from the disease.
[1:02:53.940 --> 1:03:00.500]  He spent 66 days in hospital twice on a ventilator in ICU before being allowed home.
[1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:05.540]  Because if people think that the vaccine is the full metal jacket, like, you know, you
[1:03:05.540 --> 1:03:10.220]  have total immunity, but obviously you don't, you know, why pity is the grandparents who
[1:03:10.220 --> 1:03:14.660]  are still living at home who are worried sick of getting these things, of getting this virus,
[1:03:14.660 --> 1:03:18.100]  you know, because I mean, it's the vulnerable people who are still dying, people who have
[1:03:18.100 --> 1:03:20.140]  underlined ailments, you know.
[1:03:20.140 --> 1:03:26.300]  In a city famous for its walls, the vaccine hasn't been a barrier to high infection rates.
[1:03:26.300 --> 1:03:33.580]  A pretty staggering 99.5% of all adults over the age of 18 here in Waterford are now fully
[1:03:33.580 --> 1:03:34.580]  vaccinated.
[1:03:34.580 --> 1:03:38.780]  That's the highest vaccination rate in Ireland and thought to be among the highest anywhere
[1:03:38.780 --> 1:03:39.780]  in the world.
[1:03:39.780 --> 1:03:43.580]  OK, let's just stop right there and then it goes on that they have the highest rate in
[1:03:43.580 --> 1:03:46.900]  Europe and then the places that aren't doing the injections have the lowest rate.
[1:03:46.900 --> 1:03:52.980]  So let me, let me show you some of these graphs here that I've got in the stacked deal with
[1:03:52.980 --> 1:04:01.340]  this because this is a, this is a big, big, big, big, big deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:04:01.340 --> 1:04:08.180]  They know this and then the public can't get their mind around it and that Stockholm syndrome,
[1:04:08.180 --> 1:04:12.180]  just like all the clips out of Canada, out of the US, out of England, out of Australia.
[1:04:12.180 --> 1:04:17.900]  So with premieres of major regions like Western Australia last week saying we don't know why
[1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:22.180]  the hospitals are at record levels, why everybody's so sick, why they can't breathe, they don't
[1:04:22.180 --> 1:04:26.780]  have COVID and they've been double-vaxxed because that's what ADE is.
[1:04:26.780 --> 1:04:30.140]  We'll go to break, we've got that clip from Australia for you.
[1:04:30.140 --> 1:04:32.180]  I got so many clips but that one's really important.
[1:04:32.180 --> 1:04:36.060]  I'm probably going to play that clip every day for a while because it's just all right
[1:04:36.060 --> 1:04:37.060]  there in your face.
[1:04:37.060 --> 1:04:38.060]  All right, folks.
[1:04:38.060 --> 1:04:43.660]  Oh, they're now bombarding children on Sesame Street saying be protected, take your shot,
[1:04:43.660 --> 1:04:44.980]  but it doesn't protect you.
[1:04:44.980 --> 1:04:49.220]  In fact, the British Medical General says you're twice as likely to get COVID if you've
[1:04:49.220 --> 1:04:55.380]  had the vaccine because the vaccine is a more serious form of COVID as Dr. McCullough said
[1:04:55.380 --> 1:04:59.580]  in Studio Friday.

[1:06:15.340 --> 1:06:19.180]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:19.180 --> 1:06:27.420]  So, if you just joined us, I played national TV out of Ireland where they're almost 90%
[1:06:27.420 --> 1:06:32.380]  injected, and just like Israel, Israel has the highest COVID rates in the world,
[1:06:33.260 --> 1:06:37.580]  but after them for a major industrialized country, Ireland has the second highest
[1:06:37.580 --> 1:06:45.900]  COVID rates and COVID deaths and COVID hospitalizations. I just played that part of that
[1:06:45.900 --> 1:06:52.940]  newscast for you. It's posted at M-FullWars.com, but let me show you this. This is from the CDC's
[1:06:52.940 --> 1:07:01.500]  own numbers. Vermont is the most vaccinated U.S. state, and Vermont has the highest COVID rates
[1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:10.220]  in the United States. Gibraltar, Singapore, Israel, Ireland, whoever's the highest injected
[1:07:10.220 --> 1:07:18.380]  has the highest rates. In fact, a month ago, Maine was the most injected, and they were
[1:07:18.380 --> 1:07:27.340]  number one in the U.S., but now Vermont passed them to over 90%, and they have the highest rate
[1:07:27.340 --> 1:07:34.300]  and the highest rate of hospitalizations per capita and death. Gee, I'm not a chemist,
[1:07:34.300 --> 1:07:40.620]  but if I went out in the garage and I just scooped some powder out of some weird container and took
[1:07:40.620 --> 1:07:45.020]  it and died, you know, while I was dying, I'd probably figure out that was poison.
[1:07:47.100 --> 1:07:51.420]  So here you go. I mean, for TV viewers, radio listeners, just go look it up yourself.
[1:07:51.420 --> 1:07:56.700]  Vermont and Maine have the highest cases and the highest injected in the country.
[1:07:56.700 --> 1:08:04.940]  That's the reality of all of this. This is modern warfare.
[1:08:07.420 --> 1:08:11.420]  Now, I played this one Friday, and I played this one Saturday, and I'm playing it again now,
[1:08:12.460 --> 1:08:18.860]  because it's so powerful. Here is the premier, the governor of Western Australia. That's the name
[1:08:18.860 --> 1:08:24.300]  of the province. And here he is saying, we don't know why we've got record number illnesses,
[1:08:24.300 --> 1:08:28.540]  and the hospitals are just full. You see this stack right here, your TV viewer?
[1:08:28.540 --> 1:08:35.500]  That is a five-inch tall stack, probably 200 articles, every one of them a public figure dying
[1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:40.860]  or having a heart attack after the shot, and stacks of news all over the world, mainstream news
[1:08:40.860 --> 1:08:47.660]  of the countries taking Moderna or Pfizer or J&J, all having blood clots and cancers and heart
[1:08:47.660 --> 1:08:54.860]  attacks and strokes and the rest of it, and, quote, mystery illnesses filling the hospitals at
[1:08:54.860 --> 1:08:59.580]  levels never foreseen, but the people don't have COVID. This whole stack is that. Look at it.
[1:09:00.940 --> 1:09:06.620]  Whole stack, heart attacks and everything. Maybe I should just spend a couple of seconds just
[1:09:06.620 --> 1:09:11.260]  showing each headline to you, because I read all these articles, and it's backed up by the studies.
[1:09:11.260 --> 1:09:15.020]  But again, the average person can't believe because they're so domesticated that they're
[1:09:15.020 --> 1:09:20.460]  being hit like this, and I've used this analogy a thousand times. Out in the Pacific Ocean,
[1:09:21.020 --> 1:09:25.420]  they come across the Galapagos Islands that had never had humans on them, at least not in
[1:09:25.420 --> 1:09:30.700]  modern times, and there were these big, stupid, flightless birds, bigger than turkeys, had more
[1:09:30.700 --> 1:09:36.780]  meat on them than a Christmas turkey, hopping around, and you could walk right up to one and hit
[1:09:36.780 --> 1:09:40.380]  it on the head and eat it and kill it, and the others wouldn't run away. That's why you have
[1:09:40.380 --> 1:09:46.300]  the term don't be a dodo. Do-do didn't exist until they started calling them do-dos, meaning stupid.
[1:09:46.300 --> 1:09:52.060]  You know, the sailors go, that's a do-do. And now you hear don't be a do-do because a do-do
[1:09:52.700 --> 1:09:55.980]  didn't run from a dog, wouldn't run from a human, wouldn't run from anything.
[1:09:56.860 --> 1:10:01.900]  And so the do-dos were all extinct in a couple years, and I think we should really change the
[1:10:01.900 --> 1:10:08.140]  world's flag to a do-do bird, because, you know, people wrongfully say that ostriches stick their
[1:10:08.140 --> 1:10:12.300]  head in the sand because they're scared. No, they have really good ears, and they can listen to
[1:10:12.300 --> 1:10:18.860]  vibrations up to a mile away. Ostriches are actually amazingly smart birds. They're not sticking
[1:10:18.860 --> 1:10:24.780]  their head in the sand because they're scared. That's Americans. That's liberals. That's leftists.
[1:10:24.780 --> 1:10:31.020]  That's people that Stockholm syndrome and go along with things. They're do-do birds. They don't have
[1:10:31.020 --> 1:10:37.340]  any survival instincts. They have nothing. It's very sad because they're then organized into groups
[1:10:37.340 --> 1:10:40.540]  that come after our freedom because they think they're going to get freedom as soon as they submit
[1:10:40.540 --> 1:10:45.420]  to the system that they see as their mommy giving them little treats, but it's not their mommy. It's
[1:10:45.420 --> 1:10:55.020]  the New World Order. So here is the premiere of Western Australia. Just puzzle, gee, what started
[1:10:55.020 --> 1:10:59.980]  in the last six months over there that's causing just all these mystery illnesses. And you go to
[1:10:59.980 --> 1:11:05.500]  the Australian news, I got like five articles in the stacker out of Australia. I think I'm just
[1:11:05.500 --> 1:11:10.300]  saying that. I better go through this. There's five articles on that Australia in here that
[1:11:11.820 --> 1:11:16.780]  talk about the hospitals being full over there with lungs filling up with water,
[1:11:17.340 --> 1:11:21.580]  blood clots, heart attacks, and they keep saying we don't know what it is. It's called ADE. We had a
[1:11:21.580 --> 1:11:25.340]  bunch of scientists on a year ago, a year and a half ago saying what's going to happen, and now it
[1:11:25.340 --> 1:11:31.820]  has. So let's go ahead and play the premiere of Australia there and now let's go Australia.
[1:11:31.820 --> 1:11:39.100]  Look, our hospitals are under enormous pressure. This is the same in Tasmania,
[1:11:39.100 --> 1:11:45.100]  South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. Enormous pressure. This has been
[1:11:45.100 --> 1:11:51.180]  something no one has ever seen before. The growth in demand in our hospitals, why it is, is hard
[1:11:51.180 --> 1:11:59.580]  to know, except that there is some evidence that some sort of delayed reaction to COVID, but there
[1:11:59.580 --> 1:12:04.940]  is huge numbers of people coming through the door. So we're doing everything we can to try and manage.
[1:12:07.580 --> 1:12:12.940]  So we had Dr. Peter Della in the studio, a very respected research scientist and heart surgeon.
[1:12:14.460 --> 1:12:19.500]  He's a leading expert from Dallas, very respected Fox News analysts, you know, Fox News guest.
[1:12:21.740 --> 1:12:25.340]  And he said on air Friday, he said the COVID vaccine
[1:12:25.340 --> 1:12:31.180]  causes the same thing COVID does just worse in a certain percentage of people. The viral video
[1:12:31.180 --> 1:12:35.980]  with 700,000 views and each more than that is Dr. Peter McCullough, issues emergency warning,
[1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:40.700]  vaccine-created spike protein is deadly in the human body. You want to warn people just the
[1:12:40.700 --> 1:12:46.060]  first five minutes of it is a great boil down. That's what we do. We take an hour and a half
[1:12:46.060 --> 1:12:50.540]  interview and put the best parts of the first five minutes, then we show the unedited video from
[1:12:50.540 --> 1:12:56.540]  front to back, the interview, sitting right there Friday, showing the peer reviewed studies on air
[1:12:57.180 --> 1:13:01.340]  where this is happening. And they know they admit the vaccine is causing the heart attacks
[1:13:01.340 --> 1:13:07.100]  and microcarditis and ADE. And he says as bad as all this is when the boosters come in, which
[1:13:07.100 --> 1:13:11.100]  is happening, it's going to be 10 times worse, which happened in Israel and England.
[1:13:13.100 --> 1:13:17.100]  They've suspended the boosters in Europe, but you don't hear that on your news. You're just told
[1:13:17.100 --> 1:13:23.100]  you're a cook. You're crazy. Don't ask questions. I saw a Jimmy Kimmel video from Friday this morning.
[1:13:23.100 --> 1:13:26.940]  I'm going to play some of them when we come back. And Jimmy Kimmel looks straight at the camera and
[1:13:26.940 --> 1:13:34.620]  he says, look at these idiot sports people. They say that they're doing their research before they
[1:13:34.620 --> 1:13:41.660]  take the shot. And the crowds told the laugh. He did research. He read the back of the container.
[1:13:41.660 --> 1:13:48.380]  They just want us mindlessly like a bunch of idiots going off the edge of a cliff.
[1:13:51.260 --> 1:13:57.500]  So here is the head of the UFC who I just really admire now more than ever. He's always been a
[1:13:57.500 --> 1:14:02.780]  libertarian conservative type. He's a trailblazer. And he's one of the first people
[1:14:03.340 --> 1:14:08.220]  hell, eight, nine months ago, 10 months ago to reopen areas. And he left Vegas because they
[1:14:08.220 --> 1:14:11.740]  wouldn't let them have events there. He says, we're not wearing masks. We're not making people take
[1:14:11.740 --> 1:14:17.420]  shots. This is BS. And he's saying, this is in America. I'm going to defy this crap. And that's
[1:14:17.420 --> 1:14:23.180]  what it takes as leadership. Like you see it in out burger. I don't go to in out burger. I don't
[1:14:23.180 --> 1:14:27.020]  need a lot of burgers, but I'm going to go in out burger. Now they got some in Austin.
[1:14:27.900 --> 1:14:35.580]  That's some good burgers, as they say in the Big Lemosky. But we've got to support these people.
[1:14:35.580 --> 1:14:40.620]  We've got to stand together and say, no, and not just collapse like a bunch of slaves. Here it is.
[1:14:41.660 --> 1:14:47.340]  First of all, since we came back and started doing full crowds, every event we've done has
[1:14:47.340 --> 1:14:53.580]  been a sellout, including Madison Square Garden. So, you know, going through the pandemic, the way
[1:14:53.580 --> 1:15:00.220]  that we did finding solutions to problems, you know, instead of hiding was the best thing that
[1:15:00.220 --> 1:15:06.860]  we've ever done. I mean, our business grew exponentially through the pandemic. Because
[1:15:06.860 --> 1:15:10.700]  you think you sent a message. You think you sent a message to the country by saying,
[1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:14.060]  we're going back. We're not going to hide. We're going to lean forward.
[1:15:15.260 --> 1:15:21.260]  I hope so. I mean, I hope that's what happened. But, you know, my intention was to take care of
[1:15:21.260 --> 1:15:26.300]  my people, you know, through the pandemic, we didn't lay off one person. We didn't cut anybody's
[1:15:26.300 --> 1:15:32.140]  salaries. Everybody got their full bonuses that year. And all my fighters' contracts were kept.
[1:15:32.140 --> 1:15:36.060]  Well, you're in a city that told a bunch of firefighters get vaccinated or go home,
[1:15:36.780 --> 1:15:42.220]  firefighters, cops, sanitation workers. What about that vaccine or drop dead attitude?
[1:15:42.940 --> 1:15:48.620]  Yeah, no, it's crazy. Well, you know, I'm not having my fighters can get vaccinated or not.
[1:15:48.620 --> 1:15:52.380]  We're not forcing people to get vaccinated. It's a great interview. The full interview is on
[1:15:52.380 --> 1:16:01.500]  infowars.com. We'll be back with Sesame Street. If a hurricane is smashing into the Gulf Coast,
[1:16:02.300 --> 1:16:07.260]  and I make the prediction that it's going to cause flooding, that's not a prediction.
[1:16:07.820 --> 1:16:10.540]  You know, it's a hurricane. You know, it's got a lot of water. It's going to die. It's going to
[1:16:10.540 --> 1:16:16.380]  cause flooding. So it wasn't a prediction 20 months ago, when I said the UN order to lock down the
[1:16:16.380 --> 1:16:20.460]  world economy is going to cause a chain reaction that's going to cause supply chain problems for
[1:16:20.460 --> 1:16:25.500]  years and is going to starve tens of millions to death. And now it all happened. 25 million extra
[1:16:25.500 --> 1:16:29.260]  dead, hundreds of millions on the verge of starvation, and the UN that ordered it's running
[1:16:29.260 --> 1:16:34.060]  around being the savior. Listen, when the first world collapses, the third world dies. And now
[1:16:34.060 --> 1:16:38.220]  the first world's becoming the third world. So listen to me now. We've got the highest quality

[1:20:28.540 --> 1:20:33.660]  experimental shots that have killed and maimed so many people and the whole surveillance
[1:20:35.020 --> 1:20:39.340]  casual society control grid that goes along with it to monitor and make sure we've taken all our
[1:20:39.340 --> 1:20:43.980]  good big pharma experimental shots imagine if somebody told you 20 years ago they're going to
[1:20:43.980 --> 1:20:48.780]  bring in a world government with a world id with little handheld computers that tracks everywhere
[1:20:48.780 --> 1:20:52.620]  you go and what you do and then make you take experimental injections well you you would
[1:20:52.620 --> 1:20:55.500]  have been listening to the alex jones show you would have known that i was saying it but
[1:20:56.300 --> 1:20:59.580]  you thought it was crazy and i understand why you thought it was crazy because that's hard to
[1:20:59.580 --> 1:21:04.860]  believe but now claus swabs on tv saying next they're going to put a microchip in you oh and by
[1:21:04.860 --> 1:21:11.980]  the way now the devos group announced they're going to start now that this year through the fda spring
[1:21:11.980 --> 1:21:19.580]  nanotech chips that become part of your body without you even having a choice in it it's a
[1:21:19.580 --> 1:21:26.140]  transhumanist revolution dano white refuses to mandate covid vaccinations for ufc fighters this
[1:21:26.140 --> 1:21:32.140]  is a free country you do what you want but but the statement is oh but you're going to hurt me if
[1:21:32.140 --> 1:21:40.220]  you don't take it really so you need me to take a shot because you won't be safe unless i've taken
[1:21:40.220 --> 1:21:44.460]  the shot but even when you take the shot it doesn't protect you from covid 19 because it's not an
[1:21:44.460 --> 1:21:52.700]  inoculation inoculations work it's a gene therapy i mean it's just incredible it's all over the
[1:21:52.700 --> 1:21:57.500]  news like i got in the hospital after i took the shot i thought it protected from covid but i was
[1:21:57.500 --> 1:22:05.340]  in the hospital two weeks later hey stupid the shot gave it to you it grows the same spike protein
[1:22:05.340 --> 1:22:17.180]  in the injection not my opinion a fact here's a key article people don't know the special fund
[1:22:17.180 --> 1:22:24.300]  exists people pay zero claims heads have paid zero claims for covid 19 vaccines and injuries and
[1:22:24.300 --> 1:22:30.860]  deaths zero claims because they don't tell you and i've been making this point the whole time they
[1:22:30.860 --> 1:22:36.140]  have the vaccine damage fund set up in 86 billions have been paid out hundreds of millions a year
[1:22:36.140 --> 1:22:39.740]  you got to jump through a bunch of hoops they make your damage you want to use secret so you
[1:22:39.740 --> 1:22:44.700]  don't scare the public and here when people try to approach them when they've died or their families
[1:22:44.700 --> 1:22:52.140]  have gotten sick or families had a bad reaction and they just say sorry this was an experimental
[1:22:52.140 --> 1:22:57.740]  injection so it's got liability protection but it's not under that law because it's not even a vaccine
[1:22:57.740 --> 1:23:01.580]  see it's just no man land just like they said oh it's approved for five and up
[1:23:03.020 --> 1:23:09.500]  they said a few months ago it's approved 12 and up now it's approved by the FDA in 2026
[1:23:10.220 --> 1:23:18.060]  they say the studies are done in 2026 and it may be approved then all of that is a lie ladies and
[1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:25.100]  gentlemen so that's where we are now we're going to read the article at zero hedge dot com it's

[1:32:56.060 --> 1:33:07.580]  broth at infowarstore.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:07.580 --> 1:33:15.580]  you
[1:33:20.940 --> 1:33:29.580]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[1:33:29.580 --> 1:33:39.100]  all right do i need to recap here the basic facts that
[1:33:39.980 --> 1:33:45.660]  covid-19 has killed less than 20 children under the age of 10 in the united states the last
[1:33:46.780 --> 1:33:53.980]  20 plus months that's the numbers and that almost all those children in fact everyone we looked at
[1:33:53.980 --> 1:34:01.340]  had comorbidities some of them so incredibly deformed that they didn't even have iqs most of
[1:34:01.340 --> 1:34:06.460]  them have the different disorders where their babies born without brains in one case a little
[1:34:06.460 --> 1:34:10.940]  baby that died up in michigan had the disease where the intestines are on the outside the baby
[1:34:10.940 --> 1:34:14.860]  had been alive for less than a year outside its mother then they just put covid on the death
[1:34:14.860 --> 1:34:21.020]  certificate to get the 53 thousand dollars that the hospitals get if they say it's a covid related
[1:34:21.020 --> 1:34:27.980]  death even us today admits that so last year it was mainly hype now we've got the vaccine damage
[1:34:27.980 --> 1:34:31.820]  and we've got phyzer admitting in the british medical journal confirming last week
[1:34:31.820 --> 1:34:39.100]  that shedding is happening and it's creating the variance and so that's why you see the numbers all
[1:34:39.100 --> 1:34:45.660]  over the world of double the chances of getting covid and higher chances of being hospitalized
[1:34:45.660 --> 1:34:52.780]  are dying that is just amazing but now they're coming after our children who have a higher
[1:34:52.780 --> 1:34:59.180]  rate of getting sick from the vaccine than even adults in the official studies they rolled out
[1:34:59.180 --> 1:35:03.900]  where we now learn from whistleblowers in the phyzer study in texas this is now mainstream news
[1:35:03.900 --> 1:35:10.380]  last week that they covered up adverse reactions in the trials well of course so they didn't do
[1:35:10.380 --> 1:35:14.940]  the trials before and like they're supposed to then they started trials once the rollout happened
[1:35:14.940 --> 1:35:23.260]  and now they're trying to cover up what really unfolded there as well so here is sesame street
[1:35:23.260 --> 1:35:29.180]  ladies and gentlemen targeting a little children at home to scare them about viruses and make them
[1:35:29.180 --> 1:35:34.780]  think that a big drug company cares about them if they just get this put in their body so they'll
[1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:39.980]  ask mommy and daddy to give them the shot i mean this is worse than tobacco companies targeting
[1:35:39.980 --> 1:35:46.780]  children or uh if seagrams targeted children which they never did i mean this is a form of
[1:35:46.780 --> 1:35:50.780]  pedophilia in my view i mean just like pedophile wants to molest your child have sex with your
[1:35:50.780 --> 1:35:55.980]  child defile your child destroy their innocence it's about power this is the exact same thing it's
[1:35:55.980 --> 1:36:01.340]  about power and control and it's it's it's a war crime against humanity and our children here it is
[1:36:02.940 --> 1:36:08.540]  almo but i have to say it's wonderful to actually see all of you it also sounds and looks like you
[1:36:08.540 --> 1:36:15.340]  and your families have been staying healthy oh oh i have a way i've been staying healthy doctor sanjay
[1:36:15.340 --> 1:36:25.020]  look oh does rosita have a poo poo oh oh i know i meet a visitor my covid vaccine my mommy and my
[1:36:25.020 --> 1:36:33.020]  papi took me to get up this morning rosita that's great getting the covid vaccine is a great way
[1:36:33.020 --> 1:36:40.460]  to stay healthy see my mommy and my papi said that it will help keep me my friends my neighbors my
[1:36:40.460 --> 1:36:46.700]  abuela all healthy your parents are absolutely right you know covid vaccines are now available for
[1:36:46.700 --> 1:36:52.140]  children five years and older and the more people who get them the better we're going to be able to
[1:36:52.140 --> 1:36:59.020]  help stop the spread of covid all of that's a lie we have the head of the cdc just last week saying
[1:36:59.020 --> 1:37:06.220]  96 effective and no side effects that's like saying a hot stove won't burn you or plan in
[1:37:06.220 --> 1:37:13.660]  traffic won't get you hurt sanjay gupta that got his clock cleaned by joe rogan a month ago
[1:37:13.660 --> 1:37:18.940]  already seems like a thousand years ago what a sick joke he went old sanjay gupta's wife somebody
[1:37:18.940 --> 1:37:24.460]  told me wants to basically divorce him because she's so ashamed of him pushing these vaccines
[1:37:24.460 --> 1:37:31.900]  and i think she should leave him he's a monster he's a dirtbag and now he's on sesame street pushing
[1:37:31.900 --> 1:37:41.020]  this poison pushing this poison on our children absolutely outrageous and he knows exactly
[1:37:42.140 --> 1:37:52.140]  what he's doing for his 20 pieces of silver but if that isn't bad enough the the the the
[1:37:52.140 --> 1:37:57.100]  rape of our children because i told you it was coming it was announced in san francisco now la
[1:37:57.100 --> 1:38:03.900]  now other new york saying we want vaccine passports for children as well so when your child tries to
[1:38:03.900 --> 1:38:10.540]  go in the grocery store or to church or anywhere they're ordering every place of business or worship
[1:38:10.540 --> 1:38:17.500]  to to check your phone and the app that you're fully vaccinated i walked in target today and it was a
[1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:24.860]  big sign saying unless you're fully vaccinated for your protection please wear a mask the vaccine
[1:38:24.860 --> 1:38:31.100]  doesn't protect you it's not a vaccine it's a gene therapy that erases your immune system in their own
[1:38:31.100 --> 1:38:39.420]  studies and they know in the studies that it particularly hurts children and now when all
[1:38:39.420 --> 1:38:43.820]  these children get hurt just like they did in the trials they're going to cover it up and that's how
[1:38:43.820 --> 1:38:48.380]  the corruption works just like the pedophiles got into the catholic church the catholic church
[1:38:48.380 --> 1:38:52.380]  covered it up so they were able to take over and the same thing with the boy scouts it's the same
[1:38:52.380 --> 1:38:56.060]  phenomenon and now when all these kids get sick and die there'll be an even bigger cover up and
[1:38:56.060 --> 1:39:00.060]  we'll accept more evil because it's too evil to fail it's too big for people to wake up to
[1:39:02.300 --> 1:39:06.300]  and now san francisco is saying you've got to do it you've got to take it
[1:39:06.300 --> 1:39:15.180]  evil evil evil evil now here's jimmy kimmel who they admit gets talking points from the federal
[1:39:15.180 --> 1:39:19.660]  government all the late night comics do because they're comics posing as newsmen when they're
[1:39:19.660 --> 1:39:25.420]  really just government vomit merchants and they'll say a joke that's funny and then say some disinfo
[1:39:25.420 --> 1:39:30.140]  they'll say a joke that's funny and then stab you with an attack on asking questions or doing
[1:39:30.140 --> 1:39:36.140]  your own research and it's all just despicable here's that jimmy kimmel making fun of people it's a
[1:39:36.140 --> 1:39:40.540]  long clip won't play the whole thing but just the very first few minutes he makes fun of sports
[1:39:40.540 --> 1:39:44.620]  people that do their own research you shouldn't do your own research on medical stuff you shouldn't
[1:39:44.620 --> 1:39:48.140]  have any rights you should just shut up and do what they say here it is
[1:39:48.140 --> 1:39:54.140]  yes
[1:39:57.020 --> 1:40:02.860]  sunny southern california where as of yesterday we started giving the vaccine to kids aged five
[1:40:02.860 --> 1:40:09.260]  and up our finally our kids will be able to go to bars and nightclubs again isn't that great
[1:40:10.700 --> 1:40:16.060]  this has been a very bittersweet week for children now on sunday you get a bag full of candy three

[1:40:32.300 --> 1:40:40.460]  going to be super chill about that you can hear this is canned laughter by the way that's why they
[1:40:40.460 --> 1:40:44.700]  took away the crowds for a year and a half bring them back but also add in the laugh track that's
[1:40:44.700 --> 1:40:50.940]  a laugh track people laughing at force inoculation laughing at tyranny let's continue drunkest
[1:40:50.940 --> 1:40:56.380]  friend at a bachelor party joe biden's going to make sure everyone gets shots a lot of people are
[1:40:56.380 --> 1:41:04.060]  wondering what it will be like in the office now with this vaccine mandate how we will know

[1:41:37.100 --> 1:41:41.260]  some potentially good news for kairi Irving of the brooklynettes they have a new mayor in new york
[1:41:41.260 --> 1:41:46.620]  eric adams who says he's going to reconsider the city's vaccine mandate when he takes office in
[1:41:46.620 --> 1:41:52.380]  january if that happens it would it could mean kairi will be back on the court i i just hope he's
[1:41:52.380 --> 1:41:57.980]  able to finish his research first you know he's been doing his own research what if he enjoys
[1:41:57.980 --> 1:42:03.980]  that so much he decides to become a researcher full-time green bay packers quarterback erin

[1:47:16.300 --> 1:47:30.300]  minutes after day two guy from the bottom list but my hand was made strong by the hand of the
[1:47:30.300 --> 1:47:39.580]  almighty by the end of the almighty hand of god forward in this generation next hour i'm gonna
[1:47:39.580 --> 1:47:44.860]  host coming up on sunday live that's some big interviews a lot more and a ton of news i haven't
[1:47:44.860 --> 1:47:48.860]  hit i'm gonna blitz through news till the next hour starts i'm gonna give you my view and what
[1:47:48.860 --> 1:47:57.340]  happened on at the travis scott astro world conference concert but everybody's saying satanic
[1:47:57.340 --> 1:48:02.380]  ritual everybody's saying they must have been on a bunch of drugs of course people were drunken on
[1:48:02.380 --> 1:48:09.260]  drugs and a bunch of other stuff but at this concert with travis scott at astro world he's the big
[1:48:09.260 --> 1:48:15.740]  big celebrity he was the headliner and you had a bunch of people that had come there he had a hundred
[1:48:15.740 --> 1:48:23.100]  thousand folks and as soon as they saw him go on the stage and things got exciting they rushed
[1:48:23.100 --> 1:48:27.260]  forward and they didn't think about what they were doing or the power they had and they crushed the
[1:48:27.260 --> 1:48:33.820]  people in front of them that happens at mecca all the time or sometimes hundreds get crushed
[1:48:33.820 --> 1:48:40.780]  it happens it's trines in india or hundreds get crushed it happens all over the place that's why
[1:48:40.780 --> 1:48:46.540]  people need decorum and need to be in control of themselves and that's why i wouldn't get near
[1:48:46.540 --> 1:48:52.460]  these modern rock and roll concerts or these modern rave parties or any of it because people got hurt
[1:48:52.460 --> 1:48:57.820]  when i was going to them but i have in the last decade gone some of our older children wanted to
[1:48:57.820 --> 1:49:04.060]  go i said yeah i'll go and y'all see what it's like and particularly hip hop and particularly
[1:49:04.060 --> 1:49:11.180]  stuff like that is super dangerous and it's a travesty but i'm i'm going to get more into it
[1:49:13.100 --> 1:49:19.660]  you have the country music thing shot up in uh vegas i understand live music is fun i understand
[1:49:19.660 --> 1:49:25.100]  the energy is fun i understand that but now they want you to take vaccines or shots to go to it all
[1:49:25.100 --> 1:49:30.220]  the rest of it and it's just things are falling apart now again i'll get to it more next hour
[1:49:30.220 --> 1:49:43.100]  because there's more to it yes the selfish band even though when they knew people were being hurt and
[1:49:43.100 --> 1:49:48.780]  killed did not stop things it did not say get back for a while and there's a lot of videos of that
[1:49:48.780 --> 1:49:52.540]  people trying to climb up and even tell the roadies to stop it and and and people are so selfish
[1:49:52.540 --> 1:49:58.780]  and so evil now that they just kept going because obviously the people up on stage were so bombed
[1:49:58.780 --> 1:50:03.100]  out of their brain as well a bunch of drunk and drugged out people together is not safe
[1:50:03.100 --> 1:50:07.180]  so you know rolling stones got in trouble in the early 70s or was it late 60s i forget
[1:50:07.180 --> 1:50:11.100]  with the famous thing out in california with the hell's angels or things got out of control
[1:50:11.100 --> 1:50:15.340]  well that's basically what just happened at the travest scott astro world festival
[1:50:15.340 --> 1:50:22.780]  and sad for those that died and the hundreds that got trampled and feel like they're dead
[1:50:23.820 --> 1:50:30.060]  but uh yeah i've seen the video and they're screaming people are getting hurt people are
[1:50:30.060 --> 1:50:37.100]  being stomped on and the uh leader of the thing travis scott runs out of this precipice out
[1:50:37.900 --> 1:50:43.980]  this promontory out over the crowd and he just starts singing looking down approvingly at it
[1:50:43.980 --> 1:50:48.860]  that's why folks said hey this is some kind of satanic ritual the whole damn thing is folks
[1:50:49.580 --> 1:50:55.180]  anything out of hollywood anything out of these main line you know people is bad news it's all
[1:50:55.180 --> 1:51:02.860]  got a bad spirit and i didn't go to stuff this bad with my children but you know when they were
[1:51:02.860 --> 1:51:07.340]  teenagers let them go get a taste of it and then not like it and then not want to go anymore like
[1:51:07.340 --> 1:51:15.020]  they both older children 19 and 17 now they don't want it because i went and showed them and pointed
[1:51:15.020 --> 1:51:18.860]  it out and showed them how trashy it all is and the rest of it and a lot of folks love concerts
[1:51:18.860 --> 1:51:22.620]  they're addicted to it they love the energy i'm not blaming anybody likes concerts i'm saying
[1:51:23.180 --> 1:51:27.740]  that the hollywood system the people that own all this are going to use it to make you give them
[1:51:27.740 --> 1:51:32.540]  ids make you take poison in your body and then you're going to be also around a bunch of other
[1:51:32.540 --> 1:51:38.700]  drugged out out of control exploitative people and it's not a place to send your teenagers i'll
[1:51:38.700 --> 1:51:45.900]  tell you that things are degenerating i mean i wouldn't tell somebody to go downtown in austin
[1:51:45.900 --> 1:51:51.980]  at night anymore it's not because i'm some old man now and can't handle it they had 78 shootings at
[1:51:51.980 --> 1:51:58.140]  one apartment complex in austin they didn't used to they didn't used to have 78 shootings in a year
[1:51:58.140 --> 1:52:10.940]  in austin stuff is just falling apart there is a degeneration happening in the public
[1:52:11.980 --> 1:52:16.940]  we've lost god we've lost our spirit we're in a trance we're in a days you look at people you
[1:52:16.940 --> 1:52:20.460]  can see they're in the days they're not even self-aware they don't even know what's going on
[1:52:20.460 --> 1:52:29.420]  and that's information that by the middle of december very focused very cogent very well
[1:52:29.420 --> 1:52:37.900]  put together alex jones production bigger than a film more important than a book that's going to
[1:52:37.900 --> 1:52:43.660]  be coming out by mid december maybe even earlier that i'm going to be telling you about very very
[1:52:43.660 --> 1:52:51.180]  soon i'll begin by the end of this week to begin to let you know the title of it and what it is
[1:52:51.980 --> 1:52:57.580]  so look for that by the end of the week and then by early december you're going to be
[1:52:57.580 --> 1:53:03.980]  getting a glimpse of it and i'm telling you if you put this into function and you become aware of this
[1:53:04.860 --> 1:53:09.580]  we will bring down the new order with god's help very very quickly and i've proven that i'm not
[1:53:09.580 --> 1:53:15.980]  somebody that's playing games we've proven that we've got god on our side thanks to god and thanks
[1:53:15.980 --> 1:53:22.620]  to your prayers no lori goes to me and we've got a mission here and we're going to go to the next
[1:53:22.620 --> 1:53:29.260]  level and i i'm very thankful to all of you for keeping us on air over the years that we now be
[1:53:29.260 --> 1:53:33.340]  here at this time and we're going to do our best work together coming up here in the very near
[1:53:33.340 --> 1:53:36.940]  future okay let me tell you what's coming up on sunday live usually hosted by holland shroyer
[1:53:36.940 --> 1:53:45.740]  from six to eight p.m. central it's not just tucker carlson and joe rogan that are awake now
[1:53:45.740 --> 1:53:52.940]  it's russell brand and i was sitting there realizing that russell brand and his wife at
[1:53:52.940 --> 1:53:58.860]  the time and then of course his wife's father contacted me and you know basically said they were
[1:53:58.860 --> 1:54:04.140]  big listeners and i'd woken them up they listened every day and then he ended up leaving that wife
[1:54:04.140 --> 1:54:08.140]  and you know the rest of the story and russell talked about it on joe rogan's show and he was on
[1:54:08.140 --> 1:54:13.420]  there last year hopefully russell come to town soon and come on both our shows and russell's
[1:54:13.420 --> 1:54:17.980]  been on the show a few times and i've interviewed him outside the show but he's got some gatekeepers
[1:54:17.980 --> 1:54:22.060]  around trying to keep him on the show but i'm not really worried about that but but we can again not
[1:54:22.060 --> 1:54:30.060]  take credit but say info wars was one of the main influences on russell brand as well and now
[1:54:30.060 --> 1:54:34.300]  it's all over the news they go what is he alex jones he's the new one well no it's not the
[1:54:34.300 --> 1:54:40.860]  tucker carlson or joe rogan or russell brand of the new alex jones is it's more like this
[1:54:41.580 --> 1:54:47.260]  and i was having a conversation uh this weekend with one of the people i just mentioned i'm not
[1:54:47.260 --> 1:54:54.220]  going to say just interesting story it's not name dropping um and it was it was myself and one of
[1:54:54.220 --> 1:54:59.260]  these big talk shows talking and there was another person there talking and it was it was over the
[1:54:59.260 --> 1:55:05.500]  phone and it was a three-way conversation and we were talking about everything that's happening
[1:55:05.500 --> 1:55:10.780]  and people waking up to the vaccines and all the stuff that's going on uh with rogers and white
[1:55:10.780 --> 1:55:17.500]  and all of it and they're like yeah man it's like people are saying you're the new alex jones it's
[1:55:17.500 --> 1:55:27.900]  like no no no i'm not the new alex jones i love this he said alex jones is morpheus and all of us
[1:55:27.900 --> 1:55:33.900]  that are waking up are basically meo and that's the archetype it's true and and so yeah i'm not in
[1:55:33.900 --> 1:55:41.900]  the archetypal sense the keanu reeves um character you know the ethos are coming out of the plateaus
[1:55:41.900 --> 1:55:47.900]  cave coming out of the pod i'm morpheus and all of you that have been for decades some of you
[1:55:47.900 --> 1:55:51.900]  50 years fighting tyranny aware of this new world order we stand on their shoulders a lot of them
[1:55:51.900 --> 1:56:02.140]  are tuned in right now a lot of folks been listening 28 years we're all morpheus and we are literally
[1:56:02.940 --> 1:56:08.220]  educating and waking up the public to realize how powerful they are to overturn this system and when
[1:56:08.220 --> 1:56:14.780]  they realize the power they have and take the red pill the adventure begins we show you how deep the
[1:56:14.780 --> 1:56:21.100]  rabbit hole goes and we win and so it's just so cool to fight tyranny it's so cool to go with god's
[1:56:21.100 --> 1:56:26.220]  plan it's so cool to go against the grain when you know you're right and then to live most
[1:56:26.220 --> 1:56:33.900]  trailblazers most mavericks don't get a chance to live to actually see their work come to fruition
[1:56:35.420 --> 1:56:38.940]  and i'm getting a chance to see it still gonna be a rough road we're going down but
[1:56:38.940 --> 1:56:42.620]  we're not gonna get caught flatfoot it's i want to thank all the lusters for keeping us on here
[1:56:42.620 --> 1:56:48.220]  because you are morpheus as well those of you that have been the missionaries and the trailblazers
[1:56:48.220 --> 1:56:53.180]  and the emissaries and the ambassadors of freedom against the globalist promoting this show and the
[1:56:53.180 --> 1:56:57.980]  interviews and the articles and the videos and the documentaries those of you that did this you
[1:56:58.620 --> 1:57:06.300]  literally deserve way more credit than i do because there's millions of you and what you did was 99
[1:57:06.300 --> 1:57:10.780]  percent of the work as ron paul would always say when he was getting the credit for things he'd say
[1:57:10.780 --> 1:57:15.660]  i'm just a focal point of this and then ron paul helped build the trump revolution and trump
[1:57:15.660 --> 1:57:20.620]  wasn't perfect but that builds a bigger revolution and it's all a process and we're getting stronger
[1:57:20.620 --> 1:57:26.540]  the globalists are getting weaker and everything they've thrown at us is a response to try to suppress
[1:57:26.540 --> 1:57:31.340]  us and and keep us under their control so this is the animating contest of liberty and i'm just
[1:57:31.340 --> 1:57:35.900]  blessed to be here and i want to thank from the bottom of my heart all of you for what you've
[1:57:35.900 --> 1:57:41.500]  done thank you all right some stations don't carry sunday live they should but it'll be at band
[1:57:41.500 --> 1:57:45.500]  dot video and free world news dot tv and a lot of the places so tune in and share it i'm coming right
[1:57:45.500 --> 1:57:57.260]  back in two minutes it's now becoming accepted knowledge accepted fact that global government
