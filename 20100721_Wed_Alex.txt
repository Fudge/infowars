[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:33.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.000]  Welcome my friends welcome it is Wednesday the 21st day of July 2010
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  coming out in the third hour we have some guests dealing with the depression that
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.000]  has been engineered not just here in the United States but worldwide and I wanted
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  to pull up some statistics and numbers to cover in the last hour dealing with the
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  fact that many university studies estimate between five and seven plus
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  million people starved to death during the decade-long Great Depression that
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000]  with a population that was 90 percent rural and most of that 90 percent being
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  self-sufficient we now have 90 percent being urban and of the 10 percent that
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  are rural less than half are estimated to be completely self-sufficient this is
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.000]  the problem with the domesticated society we live in and all the luxuries
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.000]  like toilets running water electricity modern medicine that we take for
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  granted all of those are wonderful developments that were developed and
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  discovered by our forebears with inventions from Japan to the United
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  States that have been developed in the last 200 years but through this system
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000]  of a high-tech society we become very very soft and also very very
[01:54.000 --> 02:01.000]  disconnected from the land and reality and that has allowed a level of
[02:01.000 --> 02:10.000]  domestication a level of dumbing down from basic facts of life and a softness
[02:10.000 --> 02:16.000]  that we've never seen in human experience and with that softness we see a
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  more intense version of what happened in other decadent societies Rome during
[02:20.000 --> 02:29.000]  its decline starting what 40-something years even before the birth of Christ
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  with Julius Caesar right through to its fall in the 400s we see that when
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  societies become decadent and lovers of corruption lovers of death lovers of
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  evil that the more decadent people get the more corrupt and murderous they
[02:45.000 --> 02:52.000]  become and the more callous they become and the less feeling and the more
[02:52.000 --> 02:59.000]  self-centered you become the more that allows society to even accelerate its
[02:59.000 --> 03:06.000]  collapse once societies have become wealthy they always then begin to
[03:06.000 --> 03:13.000]  slouch towards Gomorrah and disintegrate and anytime a society says there is no
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  good and evil and people lose the capacity to judge between what's wholesome
[03:17.000 --> 03:24.000]  and what is destructive it is an elevator straight to hell a man-made hell
[03:24.000 --> 03:32.000]  and I am a student of history I have found it to be very well entertaining
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  when I first got into it about age 12 of course the more research history I
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  found out this wasn't just entertaining action-packed information I was
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.000]  reading this was humanity's story and now I have unfortunately come to the
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  realization that total societal degeneration is being done by design
[03:52.000 --> 04:01.000]  and that the old system of humanity is being designed to collapse into a high
[04:01.000 --> 04:11.000]  tech kill grid and what really concerns me is so many times I will come to a
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  realization about the elite about the global ruling class and what their aims
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  are from just watching what they're doing on the ground and then many years
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  later I will read writings by the leading intellectuals of this planetary regime
[04:27.000 --> 04:37.000]  where they talk about the necessary program of dumbing us down so that we
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  can't resist being exterminated they believe this is a great hardcore
[04:42.000 --> 04:51.000]  decision they've made and is beautiful in its will its willingness to do this
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  but I want to have a larger discussion about that today cover a lot of news
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  and take your phone calls we'll cover it all and come back stay with us

[08:17.000 --> 08:22.000]  we're live it's Wednesday the 21st day of July 2000 and Tim we have guests coming up
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  the third hour today to deal with the depression that has been engineered by
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.000]  what I want to do is mix the show up a bit here
[08:33.000 --> 08:39.000]  a lot of you probably been noticing we're making a lot of changes I I want to open
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  the phones up on the economy on the oil leak is it really capped they're saying
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  that it's leaking some and that there's leaks and fissures several miles away but
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  it's not related to the original leak I want to get into what's happening with
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  the economy what's going on in Arizona
[08:57.000 --> 09:04.000]  Mexico's collapse is accelerating we're now learning more about Obama and the
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  sweeping financial overall bill that has passed and some more of the things that
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  are in the health care bill that passed like the tracking and control of gold
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  and other precious metals purchases there's just a lot of insane news coming out
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  on a daily basis as this quickening intensifies and builds towards a crescendo
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  the world is changing for the better and the worst it was the best of times it was
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  the worst of times but before I get into all of this news I want to give the
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  toll-free number out and in the first hour give new callers a chance because
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  so many people are never able to call in so I want to give first-time callers a
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  chance that means if you've been on hold before when the show ends you've never
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  had a chance to be on the broadcast and you've got an issue or a question or a
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  comment or you disagree with me I'd love to hear from you 1-800-259-9231
[10:03.000 --> 10:13.000]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us the top story that I will hit
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  later in the hour after I've gone to some of your calls just went live at
[10:18.000 --> 10:25.000]  prisonplanet.com and the headline is false flag cyber attack could take down
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  the internet and this story is multifaceted we had a caller on the
[10:31.000 --> 10:37.000]  broadcast he said Alex starting last Friday and through Tuesday on Friday
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  Sunday Monday and Tuesday you've given out key search terms like Obama
[10:41.000 --> 10:51.000]  deception Obama deception censored Google spies and now Google launches and all
[10:51.000 --> 11:00.000]  four of those terms have become the number one search trend not Lindsay
[11:00.000 --> 11:08.000]  Lohan not Mel Gibson not even the BP oil spill and the way Google trends works
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  is if you're in the top 10 or so generally that's going to stay in there
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.000]  for a few days we know Google's been censoring these it's very elementary
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.000]  and I went in and read there's algorithm rules in the last few days and
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  what we had already known about it was correct they claim that you know you
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  will be searchable if you're in the top several thousand search terms so there's
[11:32.000 --> 11:39.000]  no way that these four terms have gone to number one on Friday Sunday Monday and
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  Tuesday each day we launched a search term the first being Obama deception the
[11:44.000 --> 11:51.000]  second being Obama deception censored the third being Google spies and the next
[11:51.000 --> 12:00.000]  being Google launches cover-up of Google spies we know they are erasing it
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  because it goes to number one and other search terms that are number one number
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  two number five number 10 number 15 they move back and forth all day our four
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  search terms go to number one and then just completely disappear and when you
[12:14.000 --> 12:22.000]  search those terms it says no data to produce a graph no search is found for
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  this term now that's impossible you don't have something at the top of the search
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  engine and then it's just not found it doesn't go from number one to zero not
[12:33.000 --> 12:41.000]  existing instantaneously so it's just total fact common sense that that is
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  indeed happening as I saw some of the comments on the info wars dot com and
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  present planet dot com story by Steve Watson yesterday about Google launches
[12:49.000 --> 12:57.000]  cover-up of Google spies story I also noticed that it was in the top ten
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  two days ago the Washington Post story that was the one of the major stories
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  in the nation about the United States of spies and about how there's 850 plus
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.000]  thousand highest level private corporate spies that gives them untreated
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  vantage unfair trade advantage gives them control they are literally taking over
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  the government that was disappeared I noticed that that was number nine our
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  search was number one on Monday and I searched a few hours later and it said
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.000]  no search found zero so they're not just censoring Obama deception Obama
[13:32.000 --> 13:38.000]  deception censored Google spies Google Google launches cover-up I guess they
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  could argue well you had people doing that so we're saying it's not a real
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  search that I mean I haven't said that publicly but I I could see them doing
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  that but still that's a form of censorship but to say that the headline out of
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  the Washington Post that was all over the national news and is all over the
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  news today just to have that disappear without a trace this is another window
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  into how the establishment decides what it wants to be the top trends they're
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  not disappearing Lindsay Lohan they're not disappearing Mel Gibson they're
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.000]  not disappearing Vander sloot they're not disappearing things like that they
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.000]  are disappearing information that exposes the fact that Google and Oracle and
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  others are deeply into the secret America in fact the term was the secret
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  America that was the term that they censored dealing with the Washington
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  Post article and here's some articles on it today here's one out of the
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  Seattle Times top secret America snoops in our suburbs and it shows how all
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  over the country they're building giant spy bases against the American people
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.000]  and there's a bunch of other mainstream news articles that are dealing with
[14:56.000 --> 15:03.000]  that today and we'll be we'll be covering some of that coming up after I take
[15:03.000 --> 15:10.000]  your phone calls but false flag cyber attack could take down the internet the
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  Pentagon is telling us there's going to be a massive attack they're going to
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  have to shut the web off and change our access and last Thursday 73,000 blogs
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.000]  were taken down because one blog they claim was being used by al-Qaeda the
[15:25.000 --> 15:31.000]  the feds of now what five days later told us their reason and that's in the
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  news today Kurt Nemo wrote a story about it last night linking to Reuters and
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.000]  others where they say oh well there was one blog on this website that al-Qaeda
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  was using so we didn't call the website and say you know please take that down
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  or we didn't take them to court or we didn't show evidence no no we just took
[15:48.000 --> 15:54.000]  a giant website with 73,000 blogs down and so they will attack the internet the
[15:54.000 --> 15:58.000]  mainstream media is dying the government support with the people is dying all the
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  polls and numbers show that the media the dinosaur media even admits they're in
[16:03.000 --> 16:07.000]  freefall and governments in freefall and so the dinosaur media owned by the big
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  global robber bearing corporations that aren't free market that are criminal
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  that make their money through looting and power and surveillance and espionage
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  I've been telling you it's a global corporate takeover now you learn that
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  there are hundreds of times more security clearances at the highest level
[16:21.000 --> 16:26.000]  for private corporate chiefs 850 plus thousand than there are in the government
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  the government is now I mean here in Austin foreign banks come in and the
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.000]  city council gets bought off and they pass 6 2.6 billion dollars in energy
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  increased taxes that are more than all the other taxes combined each year and
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  that now they're announcing they're going to seize all the major roads and put
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  toll roads on it and almost all the money is going to go to offshore corporations
[16:48.000 --> 16:54.000]  like central of Spain that's exactly what happened 150 plus years ago in China
[16:54.000 --> 17:01.000]  when 11 western powers France the United States England the Netherlands
[17:01.000 --> 17:07.000]  Germany even Poland had an outpost went in and divided up China and took it
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  over and it took them decades of corporate espionage to buy off local
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  cities and regions and they did it and the boxer rebellion and other
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  rebellions led to China finally getting its sovereignty back but then it was
[17:18.000 --> 17:28.000]  still a week so Japan came in decades later same with Korea
[17:28.000 --> 17:38.000]  eastern Russia was weak so the Japanese invaded as well before World War 2
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  so this is happening now we were a free society we were wide open and
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.000]  corporations running intelligence operations and the first intelligence
[17:45.000 --> 17:51.000]  agencies were not government in the more modern era the last 300 years in
[17:51.000 --> 17:56.000]  Europe the Rothschilds and others on record had intelligence agencies bigger
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.000]  than British intelligence and British intelligence itself this is in
[18:00.000 --> 18:07.000]  mainline history was modeled after the Rothschild intelligence networks and
[18:07.000 --> 18:12.000]  so we have been conquered and the banks are bankrupting us to bring us down
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.000]  the level of third world surfs and they don't want the people to be able to
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.000]  speak out and expose their banking takeover that's why they erased the
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.000]  Obama deception but the backlash caused them to put it back up and
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  unprecedented move that's why they're moving and openly announcing they're
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  gonna start curtailing the web because we are countering them and they can't
[18:32.000 --> 18:37.000]  have us out there telling the truth during this process and so today this is
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  the last time I'm gonna do this at least for a few weeks I want to see the
[18:40.000 --> 18:47.000]  aftermath of it engage it I want to analyze the data it's very interesting
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.000]  but it does show we're even more effective than we had previously
[18:51.000 --> 18:58.000]  engaged which is a chilling prospect why me God why why am I sitting in the

[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  Hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  for depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  stability I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments
[22:47.000 --> 22:51.000]  currently have been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over

[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  household cleaning products linked to breast cancer and a major long-term
[24:24.000 --> 24:31.000]  study but it's also linked to ADHD increases in cancer that's because
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.000]  mainline household cleaning products are the derivatives of the oil industry
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  and gasoline refining they also sprayed on the crops and they know full well
[24:43.000 --> 24:50.000]  what they're doing that's why 30 years ago in a cancer ward doctors would come
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  from hundreds of miles around to see someone below the age of 10 who had
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.000]  cancer and now there's children with cancer all over your neighborhood you
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  are being murdered the question is will you have the strength to research this
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  well we'll talk about that later let's talk to JP in Minnesota JP you're on the
[25:11.000 --> 25:19.000]  year welcome Alex my brother in freedom and my sensei in the infill war thank
[25:19.000 --> 25:26.000]  you for taking my call thanks for calling you know Alex I had a few
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  questions for you a few points I wanted to share with you I was all caught up
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  on listening to your show last week on Saturday I had to drive in the work so
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  I downloaded one of your older shows I went searching through 2008 and I
[25:41.000 --> 25:47.000]  downloaded this episode where you interviewed Nick Begich and it was an
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.000]  awesome awesome show probably five minutes into the show you were talking
[25:52.000 --> 25:58.000]  about the internet and some news story at the time and you were telling us that
[25:58.000 --> 26:05.000]  I mean you predicted flat out you said in two and a half years mid 2010
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  internet's dead big attack the globalists own words their own documents so I
[26:11.000 --> 26:17.000]  thought that was just amazing to hear you back in 2008 you really laid it out
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  what's going on right now well I believe I was I don't remember the show two
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  years ago that would be two years ago now that was mid 2008 I do remember
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  interviewing Begich then his brother was running for the Senate and then one
[26:30.000 --> 26:37.000]  but Begich of course a scientist for those that just joined us I was on
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  talking about a host of issues but at that time I was covering a British
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.000]  Ministry of Defense report where they were basically laying out what they were
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  going to do the global collapse how they would use that to start the
[26:49.000 --> 26:56.000]  transfer of the web from free to unfree in 2010 into 2012 nothing to do with the
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.000]  Mayan calendar that's the government itself is saying they want to have this
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.000]  global system in by 2012 and there's mirrored documents in the Defense
[27:05.000 --> 27:10.000]  Department statements and also internet to this private consortium this
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  corporate consortium that spearheading the takeover of the web by these
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  interest so it's not really so much the end of the web it's the end of the web
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  as we know at the end of the free web but yes I mean I don't deserve any credit
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  for that I'm just going off their own documents I know it was just amazing to
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  hear you lay it out you know two years ago I mean you hit the nail on the
[27:32.000 --> 27:40.000]  head but I want you to know I'm I've been a long time listener a long time

[36:36.000 --> 36:41.000]  Monsanto and others are coming out with aluminum resistant seeds but it's not
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  just in the chem trails which that we know they're spraying aluminum to oxide
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  and barium salts it's in the fertilizers many of the industrial fertilizers
[36:49.000 --> 36:55.000]  being sprayed on the crop so that's what's also killing the soil and there's
[36:55.000 --> 36:58.000]  one other thing I want to bring your attention I have just gotten out of the
[36:58.000 --> 37:04.000]  military but just before like a week ago I was hearing about at least in my state
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  they're going to be having a pretty much a full-time force to deal with in-state
[37:08.000 --> 37:14.000]  emergencies but comprised of like 25% full-time individuals yeah that's brigade
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  homeland they announced two and a half years ago in army times now they've got
[37:18.000 --> 37:25.000]  eight regions with ten sub-directorate regions under FEMA with the military to
[37:25.000 --> 37:31.000]  engage in all forms of law enforcement yeah it's just getting crazy cameras
[37:31.000 --> 37:36.000]  everywhere and and remember they were building this up decades ago and in
[37:36.000 --> 37:42.000]  their own white paper saying it was for the design collapse and so this has all
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  been premeditated and the average person in the military even at kernel level
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  it was compartmentalized and doesn't see all of this but if you show them the
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  information like my film police state 2000 police state to the takeover made
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  over a decade ago people will then click in and say wow I already knew all of
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  this I just didn't put the pieces together I've got about five year films
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.000]  and so far I've put out about 400 copies so far which isn't a lot but yes it is yes
[38:10.000 --> 38:17.000]  it is thank you the active resistance handing out one film is a gift of
[38:17.000 --> 38:28.000]  information and it's that first step that matters yes it does anything else on
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  your mind Justin that's the one thing I could think of thank you very much for
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.000]  taking my call sir thank you Justin good to hear from you let's go ahead and
[38:36.000 --> 38:41.000]  talk to Daniel in Washington DC you're on the air hey there Alex how you doing
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  thank you so much for taking my call how are you I'm doing all right very good
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  I just wanted to first of all I just wanted you know thank you you know just
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  I really appreciate you know all the work you're doing I feel like I'm not
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  sort of felt like Neo you know in the matrix for a lot of years I felt like
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  you know something was wrong you know when Morpheus is explaining to him you
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  know you always saw something wrong but you know you could never just quite put
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  your finger on it so I felt like that and you know in a lot of ways you and other
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.000]  people kind of like my Morpheus a little bit no that's it I mean all I've ever
[39:13.000 --> 39:19.000]  done is point out that people already intrinsically new as I said 30 seconds
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  ago they just hadn't put the pieces together and I think when callers call
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  and say thank you Alex thank you thank you I always make the point don't thank
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.000]  me this is self-preservation I mean this is pure evil scientifically crafted
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  dehumanization we're dealing with I think really the statement is I care about
[39:38.000 --> 39:44.000]  you intrinsically and we are brothers and sisters in liberty in loving the
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.000]  truth in carrying the fire of hope and honor and love in our hearts and so I
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.000]  think instead of saying you appreciate me I appreciate you and we love the truth
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  and so we are spiritual brothers and so I understand callers always want to thank
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.000]  me because they want to say I appreciate you well no I appreciate you we are
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  together we are soulmates in eternity all of us are part of a brotherhood and
[40:10.000 --> 40:15.000]  sisterhood and sons of liberty here and so I think that's really why even though
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  I ask callers not to thank me that everyone does it because they're wanting
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  to say I am with you well I am with you as well we are together in history
[40:25.000 --> 40:33.000]  absolutely you know you united we stand well well I wanted to bring up just
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.000]  just a couple of things I'm on Facebook like a lot of other folks and I was just
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  you know looking at some of your pages and it just I just get so tired and so
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  frustrated there are so many people that are on these comments on these message
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  boards and they instead of like an issue or something that you might have posted
[40:50.000 --> 40:55.000]  up there they want to focus and like you know maybe bad mouth you or you know
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  make it about you instead of focusing on the issue and when it didn't take for
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  you to tell me or the rest of your listeners to focus on the issues and
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  they choose not to so what I was basically saying was just you know if
[41:08.000 --> 41:14.000]  he's touching on something that you don't want him to touch on or whatever then
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.000]  then go ahead and write an article or make up a blog and pretty much you
[41:19.000 --> 41:24.000]  know just do what you want to do if all you're going to do is go into his
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.000]  message boards and stuff and bad mouth him you're not being really productive
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  I would never go to Glenn Beck's message board or something like that or some
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  Neolib message board and bad mouth like whoever put it together I would go on
[41:38.000 --> 41:43.000]  there and raise issues that I want you know raised up you know what I mean so
[41:43.000 --> 41:49.000]  I just think that I just think that's crazy and and I had recently from off
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  of your site I got the I've got the Roy Furtle Fletcher proudies the secret
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.000]  team and it's extremely informative already I'm leaving that far into it
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.000]  well it is extremely important and everything you said has been extremely
[42:03.000 --> 42:08.000]  well-focused anything else Daniel anything else sir
[42:08.000 --> 42:14.000]  no no well well concerning the secret team I just I just wanted to say
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  really quick I thought was I was incredible my father he came in and
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  he he saw he was like what is this another conspiracy book I said no I
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  kind of considered a history book rather but okay yeah for the sake of argument
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  he's like well you know I think he's like basically called a criminal proudy
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  a snitch or what have you and then so I let him make his point and I came back
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  after the fact I said well you know what let me ask you a quick question tell me
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  the truth would you would you still have said the same thing if Colonel
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  proudy had written this book but instead of critiquing the CIA and what he
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  called a secret team he had been supporting it would you still say the same thing
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  you thought about it for a minute and he said no I wouldn't say the same thing
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  and I just I left that I just think it's so incredible we need to shake ourselves
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  out of this silly apathy that we're in Daniel I appreciate your call let me
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  speak to your father who I'm sure is a wonderful person and because he is a
[43:04.000 --> 43:10.000]  good patriotic American and he's done good work it sounds like in the government
[43:10.000 --> 43:16.000]  he takes that as an insult to hear about Fletcher proudy the head of
[43:16.000 --> 43:21.000]  black ops the liaison between the Pentagon and the CIA and the White House
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  he takes that as an insult against himself and that's why compartmentalization
[43:25.000 --> 43:32.000]  is so dangerous is that people that work in the system are shielded and are
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.000]  kept in a little bubble and are generally told they're doing something for one
[43:36.000 --> 43:41.000]  reason when really it's not being done for a it's being done for B and they
[43:41.000 --> 43:48.000]  don't want their image of America to be tarnished and they're really playing a
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  mind game with themselves where if they think that they just say everything's
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  okay then that makes it okay and that's not the case there were tens of
[43:55.000 --> 44:00.000]  thousands of German officers who spoke out arose up against Hitler and a lot of
[44:00.000 --> 44:05.000]  them were Nazis a lot of them were anti-Semitic and had been pro-Hitler but
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  in the last two years of the war Germany had been bombed into oblivion
[44:08.000 --> 44:14.000]  millions of German soldiers were dead a lot of their families were dead and
[44:14.000 --> 44:19.000]  they said this guy's going to destroy Germany now a lot of them had fought
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  against him early on because they had seen what was coming from a hundred
[44:23.000 --> 44:30.000]  miles away and and and pastors and so many others but you know were they
[44:30.000 --> 44:37.000]  traders were the German officers that tried to get rid of Hitler I mean were
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.000]  they traders see the government of Germany wasn't Hitler though he made it to
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  be the government the government was the people under their republic but they
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.000]  lost their Weimar Republic they lost it to corruption and apathy and to
[44:51.000 --> 44:56.000]  depression you know depressions most the time lead to a worse form of tyranny
[44:56.000 --> 45:00.000]  than what was there beforehand that's what the globalists are putting us into
[45:00.000 --> 45:03.000]  this depression and then they're going to offer their solutions Bernanke and
[45:03.000 --> 45:09.000]  others are which is more control for them here it is today Obama poised to
[45:09.000 --> 45:15.000]  sign sweeping financial overhaul but since you mentioned the fact that
[45:15.000 --> 45:29.000]  that the folks on the internet spend more time attacking Alex Jones than they
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  do attacking the government and criticizing it they spend I mean large
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.000]  portions of people it's one of the biggest memes on the internet and it's
[45:37.000 --> 45:43.000]  actually helped me I guess God says no weapon formed against us will prosper
[45:43.000 --> 45:51.000]  and I didn't understand this you know 15 years ago I understand it now but
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  they attack me for a lot of reasons I mean really it's a perfect storm but I
[45:55.000 --> 46:01.000]  would say 95% of it is not government produced but if you have a plastic
[46:01.000 --> 46:07.000]  explosive say a hundred pounds of it and you stick a tiny trigger cap in it that
[46:07.000 --> 46:13.000]  runs to the electrical timer it is a tiny electrical charge that causes that
[46:13.000 --> 46:20.000]  hundred pounds of plastic explosives that you know can destroy much of a city
[46:20.000 --> 46:29.000]  block it is a tiny blasting cap that ignites that and so the government is
[46:29.000 --> 46:35.000]  on record and this is what Cass Sunstein this what got released a year ago he
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  written it two years ago advising Harvard and Chicago business school he's
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  now in the White House regulations are we've written articles about it but
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  it's also even been in the mainstream news that he said we need to go out and
[46:46.000 --> 46:51.000]  pose this conspiracy theorist and he defines that as anybody that criticizes
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  the government that's a mind control term itself oh you don't trust the
[46:55.000 --> 47:00.000]  government you don't trust BP you don't trust powerful people are founding
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.000]  fathers said don't trust the system keep the government small have separation
[47:04.000 --> 47:11.000]  of powers or you will get tyranny but they call what Thomas Jefferson said
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.000]  basically a conspiracy theory it's a stereotype a one-liner there's something
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.000]  they just throw out to not have a debate with you to try to minimize you but
[47:19.000 --> 47:25.000]  Sunstein says this isn't working anymore he said we've got to go out and cause
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.000]  infighting with these groups we've got to go out and attack their effective
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.000]  leaders discrediting them what happened with Cohen tell pro in the 60s with the
[47:34.000 --> 47:40.000]  anti-war movement they'd send people in to get everybody in fighting with each
[47:40.000 --> 47:45.000]  other and so it's a very small government trigger and then you've got the
[47:45.000 --> 47:51.000]  troll society the troll culture online it's a coward culture and they've done
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  corporate studies about even employees will send threatening emails to their
[47:55.000 --> 48:00.000]  bosses or vice versa but they won't say it in person but an email people tend to
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  really say what they think it's kind of like a drunk man you know tells no
[48:04.000 --> 48:11.000]  lies and so these people just go wild and then it's a radicalization process of
[48:11.000 --> 48:17.000]  competing with each other to you know bring up more and more crazy things and
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.000]  so instead of the conspiracy culture being about government documents and
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.000]  opposing the foreign banks those are big targets that people don't feel like
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.000]  they're worthy to resist but it's easy to look at Alex Jones and say well that
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  guy's had some success that must be a fraud look at these people are saying
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.000]  about themselves they're saying they have no respect in themselves they're
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  saying they can't believe there's somebody real out there resisting well
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  I mean look how many people we've woke up look at how we're the driving engine of
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.000]  the global awakening I mean it there's a lot of factors there but we're the
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  biggest of hundreds of factors we're the biggest there's a lot of fish in the
[48:53.000 --> 49:02.000]  pond of resistance but we're the biggest and so I always admired people that
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  could do things better than I could or who were eloquent or who were beautiful
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  I never have really had a lot of envy or jealousy and I didn't really realize
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  that most people a lot of people are driven by that and most losers are
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.000]  they feel sorry for themselves and so the kind of conspiracy theory culture
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.000]  it attracts good patriots researchers people that understand what's happening
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  people who could see over the horizon historically people who have a sixth
[49:26.000 --> 49:33.000]  and a seventh or an eighth sense as some would say but it also attracts people
[49:33.000 --> 49:43.000]  who were just angry and who want to blame somebody for something and so
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  there's a lot of jealousy you know they have a simple term for it it's called
[49:47.000 --> 49:56.000]  haters and I almost cringe when a Willie Nelson or a Charlie Sheen calls me
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.000]  now and wants to come on the show or or Jesse Ventura tells me hey I want to
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  come on and go public for 9-11 truth two and a half years ago because then I
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  used to I thought that would wake people up because they care about celebrity
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  now I realize it just makes them get more jealous so I've been contacted by a
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  lot of big celebrities lately and I haven't even asked them to come on I've
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  just like because I realized we need to build the archetype up of the
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  individual the auto mechanic the police officer the school teacher the artist
[50:24.000 --> 50:31.000]  the little man standing up because that really is where the power is and I
[50:31.000 --> 50:36.000]  learn more and more about human traits and the way people behave and I realize
[50:36.000 --> 50:42.000]  that a lot of people also just at a subconscious level they envy my courage
[50:42.000 --> 50:48.000]  they envy my intellect they envy my will they envy my success and the fact that
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  I work harder than anybody else and God gave me a lot of great gifts and they
[50:52.000 --> 50:58.000]  all work together for the glory of God's creation and for God and so I'm
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  committed but yes stay focused on issues we all know that the Berkey water

[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think
[52:17.000 --> 52:21.000]  they own our land they think they're on our water children our education our
[52:21.000 --> 52:27.000]  money we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's going to

[54:06.000 --> 54:13.000]  one other reason it's so popular to attack this radio show by the mainstream
[54:13.000 --> 54:21.000]  media the government corporations is because you know if one head tries to
[54:21.000 --> 54:26.000]  pop up above the others it's fun to try to knock it back down you ever gone
[54:26.000 --> 54:32.000]  fishing for crabs must have been 15 years ago an old patriot you know said
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  well you know why there's so much in fighting you know why you know the
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.000]  system is promoting in fighting and pushing it to keep us all down it's a
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  form of divide and conquer but more than that you ever gone crab fishing and
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.000]  yeah throw out a piece of bacon or whatever the crabs greedy you drag him
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.000]  in you scoop them up with a shovel you throw them in a bucket and if the crabs
[54:51.000 --> 54:56.000]  work together like army ants they can form a human chain or an ant chain or a
[54:56.000 --> 55:01.000]  crab chain and get out of the crab bucket but when the crabs will all leave
[55:01.000 --> 55:06.000]  each other alone till the biggest crab goes over and starts trying to climb out
[55:06.000 --> 55:12.000]  crabs will come over and grabbing by the legs and try to pulling back down and
[55:12.000 --> 55:20.000]  I thought that was a good all the terms not parable or good analogy what's the
[55:20.000 --> 55:33.000]  what's the best term to describe that but and that's why the system tells us
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  torture and secret arrest and murder and killing is good that's why they teach
[55:37.000 --> 55:43.000]  people when somebody else fails you get ahead when in truth a rising tide raises
[55:43.000 --> 55:51.000]  all ships a lowering tide lowers all ships the truth is if you talk to most
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.000]  people they say yeah even people that attack me they say Alex Jones won't be
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.000]  up but he's bad so they don't understand what Christ said about judge a tree by
[55:59.000 --> 56:04.000]  its fruits but it doesn't bother me I've gained more wisdom over the years and I
[56:04.000 --> 56:11.000]  know that that is a symptom of our success against the New World Order but
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  I look at all the good people out there who have discernment and understand what's
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.000]  going on and how they are ignoring the disinformation and how they're moving
[56:19.000 --> 56:25.000]  forward because these minions and these fellow travelers of evil and weakness
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.000]  they're just frustrated and feel powerless and it makes their ego feel good to be
[56:30.000 --> 56:35.000]  able to ignore all of my work and just say you know I the troll and good Alex
[56:35.000 --> 56:45.000]  Jones is bad I feel sorry for those people but they do win when we divert
[56:45.000 --> 56:51.000]  from all the information we have and warning people about the poison and the
[56:51.000 --> 56:56.000]  food and the water and how it's done by design and how we can say no to these
[56:56.000 --> 57:02.000]  products and and and no to these vaccines if we just stay focused on warning
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  people I want to warn new people I'm not here to talk to the choir when I do talk
[57:07.000 --> 57:15.000]  to the choir like I've been doing the last 10 minutes it is only to get you to
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.000]  look inward and realize how you can do a better job and so the caller from DC
[57:20.000 --> 57:25.000]  brought up those points I thought they were very very central and extremely
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  informative and Obama's done it just minutes ago he signed the sweeping
[57:29.000 --> 57:34.000]  financial overhaul into law it's not as Alex Jones saying this it's Ron Paul
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.000]  and Judge Andrew Napolitano many others have analyzed the bill and it expands the
[57:39.000 --> 57:45.000]  Federal Reserve dictatorship by several orders it is just incredibly bad news
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.000]  but it's the beginning of their end because now they're identified as the
[57:49.000 --> 57:53.000]  ruling elite not their puppet Obama not their puppet George W. Bush or their
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.000]  puppet Mitt Romney or Sarah Palin or any of these people they're bought and paid
[57:57.000 --> 58:02.000]  for by the globalists that make up the false left-right paradigm the controllers
[58:02.000 --> 58:05.000]  and their own writings have been pointing out we're in trouble because the people
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.000]  now are looking at the real shadow government it's now in the news about
[58:09.000 --> 58:15.000]  top-secret America and 850 plus thousand highest level security level private
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.000]  corporate spies that we've talked so much about this is a private corporate
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  takeover they've gone in paid off the government to have the government give
[58:22.000 --> 58:27.000]  them government power so they can then go in and take over so the sky's the
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.000]  limit now listen I want to go through your calls quickly I'm gonna these calls
[58:30.000 --> 58:35.000]  are all profound though I'm gonna go to Frank Jeremy Walt Robert Kirby and others

[58:50.000 --> 58:55.000]  the question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand
[58:55.000 --> 59:00.000]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[59:00.000 --> 59:04.000]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two
[59:04.000 --> 59:08.000]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[59:08.000 --> 59:13.000]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to define
[59:13.000 --> 59:18.000]  who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did
[59:18.000 --> 59:23.000]  during the patriot uprising we have the facts we have the constitution we have

[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  okay coming up at the bottom of the alarm got a huge news blitz coming up
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  Obama has signed the sweeping financial overhaul bill into law getting the
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  federal reserve even more power over the complete economy they create the crisis
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  over the solution false flag cyber attack attack down the internet I want to
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  get into this our top story today and a lot of other key information that's
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  coming up but let's go to your phone calls right now Frank in Wisconsin you're
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  on the air Frank yeah hey Alex I appreciate you taking my call listen to
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  you all the time and we're up here in what they call God's country and there's
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  so much I'd love to talk to you about and but I just really want to tell you
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  that the great job you're doing well I appreciate you and I appreciate all you
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  getting the word out about what's really happening in this world there's an
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  unprecedented awakening taking place I'm trying I go out and I put up
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  wires on bulletin boards telling people you know they need to listen to Alex Jones
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  and info wars and and wake up to what's really going on here in our world and
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  sometimes as fast as I put them up though they're they're taken down and
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  it's like you know are these people you know what's wrong with you know society
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  they need really to wake up well they don't want to be reminded about the bad
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  things that are happening they think if they just procrastinate and ignore it
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  everything's going to be all right but it doesn't take a majority to fix society
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  it takes a highly motivated focused tireless minority and our minority is
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  much bigger per capita than what it was in the 1770s so we're going to win this
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  if we just persevere by the sheer force of numbers and the fact that we have
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  right on our side that's hey I'm hoping I'm praying all the time like this is
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  we're here in God's country well I used to live in Florida and one of the reasons
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  I moved up here I thought it was a you know safe place to have my family it's
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  clean it's so we have the world's largest concentration of fresh water here
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  but you know they're everywhere just wasn't that long ago he's talking to
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  a friend of mine and tell me the FBI was going into some of the tattoo
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  parlors and wanting names of people that are getting certain types of tattoos
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  we've got the flyers they give them at gun shops tattoo parlors everywhere
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  if somebody's missing a finger which a lot of farmers are somebody's got
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  burns on their hands which most farmers do that I've known then they must be
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  terrorists this entire anti-terror apparatus is for we the people I really
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  do appreciate your call and I saw a story last Friday it was in my stack
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  you guys reprint it it dealt with federal government creating fund to buy more
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  land and just the other night I saw Louis Gomern on C-span back there in the
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  kitchen in the coffee room here at the office and he had a map up of western
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  states over 90% of Nevada federal over 80% of Utah federal many of those states
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  are over 70% some even higher and he was showing just a little bit he slivers
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  that are not federal and then most of that is state and so the feds now have
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  passed a new tax and a new multi-billion dollar a year fund to go force
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  people to sell their property to him and if you fly in an airplane you see how
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  much land there is humans have this hallucination this this false perception
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  this I what do they call those pictures you hang on the wall pictures where
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  it's got a hidden image that you can't see yeah yeah those magic eye pictures
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  or it's a visual illusion where we all live in cities 90% of us in growing it's
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  almost above 90% and so we see the cars the people the the lines and we think
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  oh my gosh there's too many people but I mean you just drive in any direction
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  outside your town or city and you'll see most of the farms aren't even being
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  tilled the federal government pays the farmers not to grow food me mom was
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  looking at some statistics the other night
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  back pull that up to own a double check those Africa just 30 years ago was
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  almost 800 million and now it's 500 million they've gotten rid of a couple
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  hundred million of the Africans I mean the population reductions going on
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  ladies and gentlemen the Arabs the Muslims won't let the globalists into
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  abort and poison their food a lot of the Asians won't Latin America won't so
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  their numbers are up but the globalists run Africa the colonial powers and their
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  murder in those people and some folks will say well there are too many people

[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar

[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  grab US representative Louie Gohmert address Congress to report the natural
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  resource committee's passage of HR 3534 the consolidated land energy and
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  aquatic resources act or clear act of 2009 congressman Gohmert said the bill
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  was to deal with the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico but it contains plans for
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  the federal government to acquire land and was introduced in 2009 Louie
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  Gohmert said the bill contains plans for the federal government to acquire land
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  see Gohmert's remarks here so this is a chrisandra anderson a great info wars
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  dot com writers report and then she has a link to the video that was up
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  actually today this is up today on info wars dot com so I've seen this I've
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  seen him talking about this a few days ago but here it is today I tell you our
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  great writers are on top of it we've got a story dealing with this and it is to
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  buy more land and it's got video of Gohmert showing the federal maps and
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  then what isn't federal most of its state of course the biggest state in the
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  country that has the most private land is Texas and they're trying to change
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  that here most the land is private or state not federal and if it's federal
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  it means it's corporate we've been taken over by these interests okay let's go
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  quickly now through your calls because I gotta just I'm looking at all these
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  stacks of incredibly important news coming up and some eugenics news I want
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  to go over let's go ahead and talk to Jeremy in California you're on the
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  air hey I just I was gonna call you about something else that's a pressing story
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  of the day it seems like in the mainstream media but I was diverted a
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  little bit by your comments and by the maybe one or two callers ago you know
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  Alex it is okay to question you it's okay to to give you critique is it not
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  well yeah we didn't screen your call you're on air Jeremy right I understand
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  that but you know kind of around ten minutes to the hour you made it sound
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  like you're doing the Lord's work and that you're almost like you know what
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  you mock occasionally of being of the Lord and it was just you know it's okay
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  you you make mistakes Alex yeah but Jeremy Jeremy it's it's it's not okay
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  a popular lie to say that we have fake phone calls and screen phone calls that
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  mean that was my little example there and maybe you miss the whole point of
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  what I was saying I'm not the one raising your taxes I'm not the one putting
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  poison in your food and water I'm not the one trying to launch a war against
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  Iran I'm here trying to get people to realize our country has been taken over
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  by offshore corporations and so my point was so much of people's time and I'm
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  I'm not saying that some criticism isn't warranted nobody's perfect I make mistakes
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  all the time and own up to them I try to be a good person I try to be accurate
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  my issue is we have bigger fish to fry than just talking about Alex Jones all
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  day and talking about doing the Lord's work I am a Christian I do believe we
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  have a spirit and I do believe standing up against abortion and wars and
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  torture and secret arrest is the Lord's work and when I make fun of some
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  preacher saying it's the Lord's work like some of them have said to kill
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  Palestinian babies that's who I'm making fun of so you know I didn't say I was
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  doing the Lord's work I think this work is important and I guess you could call
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  the work of standing up against evil the Lord's work and I did talk about being
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  able to judge between good and evil being essential but I mean do you have
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  any other news or anything you want to discuss Jeremy yes and you know what
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  Alex thank you for one letting me engage you on that and two keeping me on to
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  talk about what I originally called about it we don't have to thank me sir I
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  want your phone calls I mean I know but you know a lot of people when you call
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  you know and disagree man there's people out there that just freak out I mean I've
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  heard clips of Glenn Beck just go off but anyways well look I've gone off on
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  people last night I got angry because I was reading some comments on prison
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  planet dot com on Steve Watson's article about our search terms being deleted
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  out of the top number one slot the last four of them and I know how the search
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  term system works I went and read it on Google Trends years ago I re-read it a
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  few nights ago and you're not the number one trend and then it says unsearchable
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  does not exist okay trends move up and down but the term Obama deception was
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  erased the term Obama sensor was erased the term separately the term top secret
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  America was number nine I noticed that my term Monday and the term Monday was
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  a Google spies I noticed that it disappeared from number one and that
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  top secret America disappeared from number nine completely so my issue is
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  Google is gaming and manipulating the the the the most popular search terms we
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  have demonstrated it and people are like oh no your term can just move up and
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  down well that's not what I said it didn't move from number one to number
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  200 it moved from number one to zero does not exist look I was sending emails
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  yesterday and it frustrates me for their own ignorance I can't believe how
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  willfully dumb they are saying that we took down the Obama deception or saying
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  it was never even down it said removed by user the user the director account did
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  not take it down it was already number one why would we take it down if it was
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  number one and then a anybody who has a YouTube account knows you cannot
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  remove your own video and then put it back up that's a 100% rule this is the
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  second time we've only ever seen it so so I get frustrated at people's
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  criticism of me because 95% of the time it's unfounded baloney you know I get
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  sick of people telling me that I work for the Vatican when I'm not a Catholic
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  and my family was on the Mayflower and my family the airs family help raise
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  Colonel Travis's son and help found Texas okay I don't bash Catholics but
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  I'm as Protestant as they get it doesn't get any more pure bread pilgrim than
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  me okay I'm a pilgrim baby on both sides of my family it doesn't get any more
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  pure it's frustrating to be told I work for Israel and I'm an Israeli citizen
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  when I have no connections to Israel and my wife doesn't okay I'm tired of the
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  fact that we're going to hell in a handbasket and cancer rates are exploding
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  and sterility is exploding and we know the flu shot was killing people and we
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  know Gardasil is killing people and folks like some mindless simple thing they
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  can repeat like parrots over and over again that's what I'm frustrated at so
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  I don't I'm frustrated because we don't have much time sir we don't have much
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  time and and what was your point Jeremy what was your point because I'm not
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  going to be able to get to the other calls I got this news I got to get to
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  this thank you and one quick little footnote to what you just said about
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  Google don't forget man they park their jets on NASA's facility so we know who
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  they're working oh no I'm lying Google's not involved with the CIA and the
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  government look I said this five years ago and now it's mainstream news I know
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  what I'm talking about I mean that's what I'm trying of course yes I know
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  exactly but people are saying Google isn't involved in spying they're not
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  censoring people bull and then people tell me well don't be on Google Google
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  is the internet now they're trying to take the whole web over I'm on the main
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  battlefield but Alex I wanted to get your your opinion and comments if you
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  could tell us what you know about Andrew Breitbart I think that there is a
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  just like you did with the machete thing earlier there's an ongoing racial
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  divide and conquer thing going on here and I believe that Andrew Breitbart
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  this guy Malik Shabazz that Fox News has put out I believe he's a paid
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  contributor there's because he's not anywhere else on cable news I think that
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  there's definitely an organized effort here and if you know anything about
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  Breitbart it's time to expose this creep for who he is okay what I know about
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  Brett Bart is that he has a big news website and that he's done work with
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Matt Drudge before and all I can do is say Matt Drudge is disposing world
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  government and the new world order and Brett Bart did expose the Black Panther
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  saying kill the crackers now they're saying that the tape was edited and my
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  guys have watched it this morning I haven't had time to watch it but in fact
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  who was that Matt Ryan called me this morning and or I am me and told me that
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  that lady went on to say that she decided not to discriminate against him
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  because he was white she she decided to be better than that and that the
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  farmers wife went on TV and I did read about this on MSNBC and said that
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  no that lady helped him so obviously the Republicans going back to Willie Horton
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  use race and obviously Machan LaRaza use race and obviously the NAACP uses
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  race because we're tribal creatures and it's very powerful but you know I think
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  it's self-destructive that I even have spent time attacking Glenn Beck I mean
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  at least Glenn Beck's talking about the world government I mean they're bigger
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  fish to fry than Brett Bart and Glenn Beck and all of these people I mean look
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  Obama signed sweeping financial overhaul in the law this is the Federal Reserve
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  completely taking over society it's almost like even responding to racism
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  feeds into it I was thinking about this driving in to work this morning and I
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  was talking about at the bottom of the hour think I'll just do it at the bottom
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  of the hour but I had this epiphany about race and about how all this works and
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  I'm going to write a note that remind me guys to cover that when we come to the
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  bottom of the hour let's talk to Walt and Pennsylvania Walt you're on the air

[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  just finishing up on corrects it corrects it was used for the Exxon Valdez
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  the average life expectancy for Exxon Valdez workers according to the federal

[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  big news blitz coming up and we got gas dealing with this engineered depression
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  coming up in the third hour
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  Walt you were getting into the dispersant chemicals
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  and now they admit 40 plus million gallons used in the
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  gulf far worse than the crude oil itself go ahead
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  correct yes you know I mean seriously we got the EPA
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  with the environmental protection agent
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  I have a clip of Obama saying there's no health problems in the gulf he said it again last week
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  everything's fine you notice you didn't see Michelle Obama
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  standing in the water when she was down there last week did you
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  she was standing on the beach not in the water well they admit that
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  core exit is eating the boats exactly
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  the especially the ones that are made out of fiberglass
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  it's eaten right through them it's eaten right through them but the thing is
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  you know nobody none of the main media is even covering
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  this but the whole idea of corrects at 9500 is
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  to hide the oil it's to push it down into
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  the ocean so that nobody can see it
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  and so it can't be cleaned up no they should exactly it's
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  it's diabolical what they're doing and they're using their own money to buy
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  the core exit from one of their own subsidiaries
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  so they're basically making money on the cleanup exactly
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  Nelco which by the way I can't remember this guy's name I think it's
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  Finkstein or something like that but he is also big buddies
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  with Geithner and
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  Summers you know I mean this is all a scam we're being
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  poisoned and people are I don't know
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  well somebody ought to tell those workers there's no amount of money worth
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  dying and to be down there cleaning up the oil that's coming
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  in mixed with this core exit is insane and they
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  should stop using it and they should give them respirators but what's been happening
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  for two months they won't let them wear respirators because then they'd have to admit that it's toxic
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  fumes so just like on 9-11 they told the firefighters and people
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  don't wear masks you don't need it so out of sight out of mind
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  they just wave a magic wand and say asbestos is good for you
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  pulverized glass and concrete and mercury is good and these deadly
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  dispersants it's not the only one being used it's good for you and there's
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  no problem and Obama has said repeatedly there's no health problems and everything
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  is good I appreciate your call Walt on the other end of that I've seen maps
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  that people have been sending me in the last month that show the United States
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  with a black line drawn from
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  northern Mexico all the way up to Maine and
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  it's saying you better evacuate and
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  when the hurricanes come the oil probably will get blown into shore there may need to be some evacuations
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  a few miles in I can't see the oil going further than that there will be some fumes
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  but just to draw an arbitrary line when weather systems
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  are going to take that stuff all over the place and it's going to disperse it and lord knows
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  it's not going to be good for anybody but there's already so much poison in the food and water
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  and everything else they already you know test all these nuclear weapons they already used
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  du that circles the globe in the jet stream I mean that's why all these fake
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  environmentalists they say cut all of our carbon
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  output but move it to China with no controls then that increases
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  the carbon of carbon dioxide so deadly but they know it's not they use that as a red
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  herring to not worry about real environmental issues that's coming up in the next segment
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  let's jam in another call here Robert Montana you got about two minutes go ahead sir
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  hey Alex thanks for having me on thanks for calling
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  hey uh first of all I just I know you don't like to be thanked that much
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  but I just have to say thanks to for you to help shape my
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  sheep's wool with your clippers of truth I call
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  well I appreciate that it's not that I don't like being thanked just everybody does it and then the whole show turns into that
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  yeah well okay well quickly I have
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  a militia demonization alert for you
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  you know I don't watch TV a whole lot anymore but I
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  I do watch the show leverage on TNT I've been watching
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  and I noticed the commercial for next
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  Sunday's episode is all about militias and you know I haven't seen the
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  episode yet but the commercial really makes it look like the militias are some hillbillies
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  um you know like and they're really violent people and
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  and stuff like that and they had a militia movie where it was basically a
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  talk show host who acted just like me who was the bad guy and who was a terrorist
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  and that's just all over the culture yes they're telling you homeschooling bad
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  owning guns bad being a patriot bad being in a militia
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  bad I mean it's admittedly paid for by the government
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  yeah and that one other quick thing Alex I just want to
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  let people know um free screening of

[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  and I just wanted to know which which movie would you recommend
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  to maybe show first to really get people's attention to come back and watch some of the other ones
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  fall the republic Obama deception in game
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  those are probably the films I would show for

[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  I want to get into eugenics
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  briefly here because in the last year
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  I've been told by so many people to read the book The Road
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  I didn't know it was a prolet surprise winning book
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  I didn't know that he'd written No Country for Old Men and All the Beautiful Horses and so many other
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  powerful novels that I've seen
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  turn into films but
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  No Country for Old Men is nothing compared to The Road
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  which is probably the most powerful film I've ever seen
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  because it only tells us things we already know
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  but it does it in just a stunning way and I bought the novel I'm going to read it
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  I have time coming up this weekend and no they're not advertising here
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  I'm just saying The Road with Vigo Mortensen
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  Robert DeVall and others is
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  well not even Fear of the New World Order really gives me nightmares I have disquieting dreams
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  nightmares I need to have very disquieting
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  but I've shot a special video yesterday
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  that's going to go up at about 3pm central today
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com it will have The Road in the title
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  I haven't figured out the title yet they're completing editing it and adding
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  video clips and documents to it but I think it'll explain
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  why I've been talking about The Road but this morning
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  I thought to myself I better do some research on The Road
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  and because it does have
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  one thing in it that's a problem but still this is powerful art
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  and so I'm talking about it
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  there's been a sudden disastrous event and in the trailer for the film
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  much of what's in the trailer is not even in the film
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  it shows you know newscast saying the end of civilization
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  everything's collapsing, sudden temperature increase, collapse of the atmosphere
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  you guys searched that term
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  I mentioned it last week but it was a NASA report
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  about massive collapse of the atmosphere
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  and then when the sun cooled off in the last decade and stopped having sunspots
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  which are just visual evidence of Coriolis sun flares
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  solar flares that the atmosphere, the upper atmosphere
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  collapsed to the greatest extent it's ever collapsed
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  in the hundred years they've been studying it and so basically this film deals
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  with a partial collapse of the atmosphere
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  and in the video I shot yesterday
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  I hadn't read the novel yet I talked about roasting children on spits
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  that is not in the film but it turns out that's in the novel
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  I was reading reviews of it online but
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  it does deal with cannibalism and the worst and best in humanity
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  love versus hate but I learned that globalist
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  George Mambillat has been
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  promoting the film as a way to scare people into giving into global carbon
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  taxes and regulations
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  he actually promoted the novel
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  when it won the Pulitzer Prize in 2007
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  the film in the two years after that and was released last October
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  and the film is very multifaceted
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  it turns out the writer
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  Cormac McCarthy
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  and of course something this powerful would have a connection to that
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  and I learned this after shooting the video turns out this guy
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  has had Annenberg funding, Rockefeller Foundation funding
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  but they fund thousands of
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  novelists and that's how they control culture
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  because they understand that's a way to steer society
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  he doesn't do a lot of interviews and so before I judge the author
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  I'm going to try to get in contact with him and it turns out he's involved with this science fusion
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  center
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  and when I talked about the film having so many archetypal multi-layered messages
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  then I was doing research for several hours this morning
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  I discovered that's exactly what this guy's into
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  so that's why the film freaked me out so badly is because
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  it's everything I've already foreseen
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  and the system is implanting, in fact my instincts were right last week
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  when I first seen it I was on Mancow and he asked me if I had seen the road
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  he said that it had disturbed him and I said yes I believe they're planting these
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  messages in the population preparing us for mass
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  die off and mass death and so this is really
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  an addendum I'm doing live right now to
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  the 10 minute video that we're going to be posting about the road
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  today and I admire the art, I admire the understanding, I admire
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  the beauty
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  that is magnified by all of the ugliness, the ugliness is not beautiful
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  the beauty of the love of the family, the pro-second amendment message
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  in it is very very strong
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  the self-sufficiency message is very very strong
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  and I associate these two quotes with the film
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  adversity makes men and prosperity makes monsters
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  Victor Hugo, courage and perseverance have a magical talisman
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  John Quincy Adams
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  and we have these ancestral instinctive memories of asteroids
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  hitting the earth and super volcanoes going off and now NASA admits that they were wrong
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  previously Shoemaker Levy the comment decades ago
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  that broke into many pieces and hit Saturn blowing holes in the planet
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  and the gas giant bigger than the earth studying
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  with radioactive dating
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  the different isotopes they know
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  that many of the giant crater sites that are pot marking
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  the surface of the planet and the ocean floor
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  happen more often than 10, 20, 30 million years
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  like scientists had previously thought, I mean look at the surface
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  of the moon, the face of the man on the moon is giant mega
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  meteor craters
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  so we know that mass catastrophe and collapse
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  is happening every few hundred thousand years and that's conservative
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  the science points towards every 50,000 years maybe every 10,000
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  and so
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  as a species we instinctively know that disaster is always right around the corner
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  and that life is transient
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  and that this earth is always changing, the only constant is change
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  that the earth is being struck by giant meteorites, there are super
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  volcanoes, huge fault lines
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  being changed, tectonic forces
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  we know that war comes and kills millions of people
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  sometimes hundreds of million, we know that famine and starvation
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  and disease and that
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  peaceful times, times of milk and honey are very, very rare
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  in the human experience and so that's why this film resonates
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  and I wrote some notes
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  that speak to deep human truths here
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  there are other forms of social death
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  if you see an 18 wheeler carrying a bunch of cannibals in a collapsed society like Rwanda
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  coming over the hill to hack you up with machetes and eat you
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  you know that threat, that's 100%, that's not creeping death
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  that's a full frontal assault, when you see a down break
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  and 100 feet of fast moving water coming towards you, you know that's a threat
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  but the globalist are scientific in their system of control
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  and they admit that they are bringing in a form of creeping, soft kill
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  slow death where they genetically modify the food to sterilize you and add
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  chemicals to the cleaning products and to the foods and silicone
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  to many of the fast foods and prepared foods and processed foods
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  and that the sperm counts drop by over 80% and then infertility
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  is exploding and cancers are up several thousand percentiles on every
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  major front and that this is designed, I mean I have the
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  globalist textbooks
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  we've shown you many of them here like eco science written by the White House Science are
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  so I wanted to speak directly
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  to the people that are bathing our culture in films
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  like Eli
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  and The Road and others, all these constant
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  2012 movies, meteor movies
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  viral release movies like I Am Legend
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  which is a remake of the Omega Man and The Last Man on Earth and others
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  with Vincent Price
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  this is being done to introduce this idea
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  so that we will accept it when it happens and we've had
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  our federal government since the 40's building the biggest underground complexes
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  in the world, they admit they're the biggest but they're secret
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  with decades of food supplies and nuclear power plants underground
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  and Adam and Eve repopulation centers and huge seed banks
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  all over the world funded by the Rockefellers and the UN and Rothschilds on record
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  this is mainstream news and they say oh in case there's a total collapse
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  well I mean I want to give you the big secret here, the biggest secret
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  they are planning a moon raker scenario
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  the man that wrote moon raker was of course a member of OSS and the MI6
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  he was a spy chief, Mr. Fleming
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  and in moon raker you have a globalist who is the richest man in the world
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  a robber baron and he releases a biological weapon or attempt to kill everyone
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  on earth and he and his elite
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  the eugenics elite, the genetic elite are going to stay off world for two years
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  because the bio weapon is meant to run its course
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  and then retrograde
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  and break down into something harmless and then they're going to come back and re-people the earth
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  this goes back to Plato and his republic saying
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  we need to round up all the poor, kill them and then only breathe with the elite because we're smarter and better
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.000]  and we're going to control the future and humanity is crushing the breast of mother earth
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  this is the ultimate jealousy, the ultimate
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  form of cannibalism, this is the ultimate form of controlling technology
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  and hoarding information
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  the ultimate form of selfishness and I want to say
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  to the Rockefeller Foundation and to others
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  that you are psychopaths and you are control freaks
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  and all of your history shows that and you funded all the major wars the last
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  90 plus years since world war one and you've done all of this
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  on record to bring in your world government and you hand out nuclear weapons to North Korea
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  and to Pakistan our own government's done that and you know
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  that you're releasing salmon that have just been approved that in major university studies
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  cause a total extinction within 40 generations of the natural salmon
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  and these salmon themselves are a chimera cross species
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  you're on a power trip, you believe you control reality
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  you believe that you're going to destroy the earth so that we are all forced to die
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  you are committing us to this, you're going to go into your underground bunkers
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  and then re-emerge you believe and then eradicate all the GMO
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  and replant, I mean they actually state this, they have all these shows on Discovery Channel
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  you know the world after man, romanticizing how great it's going to be
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  I mean you see it and how we shouldn't have even one child now
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  there should be taxes on having children and how humans are evil
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  we see this everywhere
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  and so if you're really concerned about the environment, if you're really concerned
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  about what's happening in our world
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  many of you mainline
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  lower level environmentalists are good people
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  and I notice a lot of the old environmentalists that help grab land
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  from people here in Austin with the FOS, they're now not part of it
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  they've woken up and they're fighting fluoridation of water, GMO food, things like that
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  I mean that's the big issue that's hurting this planet
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  all the new viruses and genetically modified
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  mosquitoes they're releasing, that was in BBC two days ago
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  and all of this is the real threat and fish and fusion weapons
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  and neutron weapons and antimatter weapons that the Air Force admits they've developed
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  are highly classified, they just admit they've developed it and the Hadron Superconducting Supercollider
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  their own scientists admit it could cause a strange lent, a singularity
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  a black hole and they wouldn't know the particle would sink to the center of the Earth
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  and then start replicating, start sucking in energy
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  and then by the time they even felt the earthquake happen one second later we'll all be dead
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  and I'm not saying that's going to happen
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  but the point is you've got thousands of these experiments going on, pale male
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  globalists rushed for advanced technologies to extend life
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  they believe eternal, I'm not saying that's real, I'm saying they think they're going to get it
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  this is all they talk about, it's a power trip of how their gods
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  and everybody else are a bunch of dumb people
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  and they are organizing
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  a global collapse that will make our world look like Leningrad
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  where the people survive for several years on cannibalism
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  I mean this is what they want to set up, this is what they want to push
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  and so the film is profound and I don't know if that was the goal of this film
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  because it has a lot of other good messages in it but I'm telling you this is something profound
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  that people need to see, it is a master work of master work
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  and I got a video coming out in a couple hours
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  where I break it all down in more detail at infoworks.com, stay with us
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  Hi this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  it's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  and here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  that's 877-327-0365
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  remember, in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  if you're in a service business that's money ringing in your ears

[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  there's the headline on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers from NASA.gov
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  a puzzling collapse of Earth's upper atmosphere
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  a record collapse in 2008-2009
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  and NASA says that the sun put off a lot less radiation
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  for the years before that and that's what caused it so it's not going to be carbon
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  dioxide that plants breathe that makes the atmosphere collapse
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  like the road says, paying taxes to Al Gore so you can have bigger
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  palaces isn't going to do that
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  and again that's my message to
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  the establishment fake environmentalists who are just eugenicists and then
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  their kind of outer acolytes in the church of dehumanization
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  is that what the elite, what the controllers are doing
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  is endangering the Earth with their megadeth weapons
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  with their genetic engineering, with their open air planting and release of genetically modified organisms
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  goats that are part spider, fish that are part roach
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  corn that is part roach, grasshopper, tomatoes that are part
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  roach, roach is one of their favorites because they've got the genome for it
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  I mean you can't make this stuff up, please don't laugh at me, just search the term
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  spider goats or salmon genes in corn
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  insect genes in salmon, I mean they know
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  what they're doing, they talk about themselves like they're gods and how they're
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  rewriting everything and how the third world populations don't deserve to live
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  and then you research they're targeting western populations even more
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  saying don't have kids it's bad
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  they go city with 30 million people most of them living in cardboard boxes
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  every day they have snow that is human feces they call it
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  I'm not going to use the slang term for it, I'm not kidding
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  the storms of brown human
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  waste raining down and they say well we've got to reduce population but if they industrialized them
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  if they educated them that would happen but instead
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  the globalist in the Royal Commission on Population in 49
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  are doing out this year say we're not going to allow these countries to industrialize
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  because that will make them a rival to us, we're going to let their population be a bomb
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  and by the way it's a perception issue, 90% of the western
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  world and other industrialized countries live in cities, you can fly on an airplane
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  for hours and not see any human civilization
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  the way we're concentrated is bad for us in this toxic environment but outside of
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  that it's not as toxic and the globalist could care less about it
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  and here you have all the mainline quote liberals like Margaret Sanger
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  who got awards from Hitler, gave awards to Hitler, being pushed as good
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  and loving and they play all these race issues
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  to bring down western countries so they can control them but meanwhile
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  they want the people in Mexico dead
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  see I'm supposedly the racist because I don't want the Mexicans dead, I want to wake them up
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  like everybody else and have them have a free, vibrant, uplifted
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  society, I know that if they're not doing well I'm not going to do well, I care
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  about humans, I have empathy, I have that fire burning in my heart
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  for the destiny of humanity but the globalist is just cold bloodedly
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  poisoning everybody, testing their soft kill weapons
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  and targeting western populations that have a 1.3
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  replacement rate, for every two adults a replacement rate of 1.3
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  the west is dying, it's the death of the west and the
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  globalists are destroying the environment by design, rewriting it
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  saying there is no such thing as a mutation, I had an IBM person tell me this
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  they said there's no such thing as a mutation because humans are natural so anything we do
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  even if we do it with technology is evolution and so it's
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  evolutionary that we're going to rewrite everything
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  and destroy what the natural world was, I'm a real conservationist
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  I'm a real environmentalist, I realize what the real threats are
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  these people tell me no, it's what you exhale, it's what plants breathe
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  it's carbon dioxide, that's what we're going to tax, we're not going to stop the GMO
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  we're not going to stop the chimera cross species, we're not going to stop the fission fusion
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  neutron bombs and super hydrogen weapons, we're not going to stop the X-ray lasers
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  we're not going to stop the bio weapons, we're not going to stop any of that
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  we're going to sit up here and tell you that all of humanity is going to die
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  if you don't give us a global government to reduce your numbers, when the aim of the
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  global government is mass extermination, so it's really a riddle in all these films
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  when they show you mass extinction, because that is the aim of the environmental
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  movement, they're not trying to stop that, that's their aim, that's their state of
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  aim

[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  it's being engineered with some special guests coming up after the break. I wanted to get into
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  this top story today. It's up on prisonplanet.com
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  we want to make this the top search term on the web again and then I'm going to
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  give this a rest for a while. I want to commend all of you that have made the last four search terms number one.

[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  this number one, which I have no doubt you will, God bless you, then they will be led to this
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  article by Steve Watson. False flag cyber attack
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  could take down the internet. Billion dollar cyber security
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  industry at the forefront of top secret America complex
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  and Google's also censoring the term top secret
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  America. It was in the top ten they removed that and that's just because it's in the Washington
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  Post and a bunch of papers so they're not just censoring our terms. We have to come up with new ones
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  before they censor them and then by them censoring them it shows the censorship.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  False flag cyber attack could take down the
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  internet. Search term false flag cyber.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  An increasing
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  glamour to restrict and control the internet on behalf of the government, the Pentagon and intelligence community
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  and their private corporate arms could result in a stage
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  cyber attack being used as justification and they're saying the attack's coming.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  We're going to shut the web down as you know it when it happens for your own good of course
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  as they already build the takeover hubs. Over recent months we have seen
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  great increase in media coverage of inflated fears over a possible
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  electronic Pearl Harbor event with reports claiming that the US could
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  be filled within 15 minutes. Remember we had to
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  attack Iraq because they had an EMP weapon to knock out everything in 45
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  minutes. Vastly overhyped and in some cases completely asinine claims
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  that the power grids and other key infrastructure such as rail networks and water sources
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  are wired up to public internet have permitted such
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  false coverage. It's not true. Threats against computer networks
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  in the United States are grossly exaggerated. Dire reports issued by the Defense Science
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  Board and the Center for Strategic International Studies
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  are usually richer in vivid metaphor and that's from a mainstream news article
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  which fears of digital Pearl Harbor and cyber Katrina's
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  than in functional factual foundation writes
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  a major news publication a respected researcher and blogger
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  who writes on the political effects of the internet.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  They go on to write that much of the data on the suspect
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  exposed cyber threat are gathered by ultra secretive government agencies which
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  need to justify their own existence and cyber security companies which derive
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  commercial benefits from popular anxiety and allows them to consolidate and control
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  the infrastructure of the web. When the Cyber Security Act was introduced by
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  Senator John Rockefeller J Rockefeller who said we better off we never had the internet was
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  invented. We had similar claims about the threat of cyber attacks
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  quote adding would it have been better off we never invented the internet
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  Rockefeller legislation gives the president the ability to declare a cyber emergency
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  and shut down or limit internet traffic in any critical information
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  network in the interest of national security. It's now been admitted this year that last year
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  the CDC almost had the internet completely shut down
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  and rerouted to the CDC. Obama almost did it as a test
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  because the flu was such a threat you could only get their info.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  That's because myself and others were on the web countering that it was a total fraud.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  I'll come out in the EU Commission and the British Medical Journal that it was a complete
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  lie and a fraud to sell vaccines. Dangerous vaccines. But they almost
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  did it last year. And it goes on the Rockefeller
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  legislation gives the president the ability to declare a cyber security emergency and shut down or limit internet
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  traffic in any critical information network in the interest of the national security.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  The bill does not define a critical information network or cyber security emergency.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  But it says that anybody with over 100 ISP members will be under federal control.
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  That information would be left to the president according to Mother Jones report.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  Provision of the bill would allow the federal government via the DHS and NSA
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  to tap into any digital aspect of every citizen's information which they're already doing
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  without a warrant. This report is so important only read one page of it. It's lengthy
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  it's key. You want to save the web get this out to everybody.
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  False flag cyber attack could take down the internet.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  Just search the term false flag cyber. Search the term
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  false flag cyber. This is your mission if you choose to accept it. I salute you all
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  for making our last four search terms number one on the web.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.000]  Number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.000]  bill. Number two our new energies are wants to control how much power
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.000]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  Number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:29.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.000]  Number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.000]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science

[02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:23.000]  We are live ladies and gentlemen and for the next
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  52 minutes we're joined by Robert Denazi. Produced a lot of big films. My flight plan
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  with Jody Foster and of course Kevin Costner. We got Brian Kraft
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  another writer-director involved with a lot of important work. They wanted to
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  interview me about two years ago for a film called The Fall of America. It's
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  nine discs. They have a tenth disc. When you order it the website is
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  fallofamerica.net. We'll put that up on screen for everybody.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:02.000]  But they set out to make a film about something completely different but in
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  their research every expert they talked to not just myself or Dr. Paul Craig
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  Roberts and countless others told them that a collapse was coming. So they were
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  making this long before the collapse began and it's now been out for about a
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  year and it is a survival guide how to protect you, your loved ones from
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  financial Armageddon, government tyranny, the destruction of the middle class
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  and the end of freedom. What if in the fictional movie The Road people around
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  the country had seen an important compendium, a survival guide like The
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  Fall of America and the Western World. Gentlemen it's good to have you on with
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  us. Fire out your website for folks. Thanks for having us back Alex. Always good to
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  hear your voice. The website is www.thefallofamerica.net. That's the
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  fallofamerica.net and that's where they can get the 10 hour DVD box set called
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  The Fall of America and the Western World. Well it's an incredible compendium
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  of information. Tell folks before we get into how you made the film and the
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  journey of discovery it took you on and where you see this country and the
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  world right now as they admit now we're going into a depression and some of the
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  folks that are in the film gentlemen. Well it was you know when Bob and James
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  Pudula our other partner when we started out to make this film pre-economic
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  collapse. We were just setting out to make a movie on what it would like to be
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  living in a post-911 world. We went and talked to as many experts and notables
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  as we could get to talk to us and these are you know everyone from yourself
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  Alex Jones to the father of Reaganomics Dr. Paul Craig Roberts to NYU
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  professor Mark Crispin Miller we spoke to Doug McIntyre the historian the
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  eminent economist Doug Casey we spoke to these notables Naomi Wolfe and we were
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  interviewing them just asking them about hey what would it be like to live in a
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  post-911 world and one word or one phrase kept coming up as we were
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  interviewing people and that was hey you guys know America is not going to
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  collapse it's in the process of collapsing now again these are notable
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  experts on the economy on government and when they said this we said well what
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  do you mean it's in the process of collapsing and I'll never forget it
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  the eminent economist Doug Casey who's also a supporter of Ron Paul he
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  looked at us and said oh we're in inning three of a nine inning greater
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  depression he said look around now this was before the economic collapse since
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  then we've seen things that I think are and I think your viewers your audience
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  and viewers and yourself would agree are unprecedented out bank failures Wall
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:26.000]  Street collapse the socialist takeover of the American private sector and this
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  is not by the way just in America we don't have enough time to go into what's
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  happening everywhere but look let's see look what's happening in Spain or
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  school in Greece and so anyway we looked and we listened and we realized oh my
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  gosh America is in any two or three of a collapse and it's our duty as patriots
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  of Americans is just good people who care about ourselves and our family it's
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  our duty to create a survival guide and so that's what we did with the fall of
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  America and the Western world it's more than just the documentary Alex it's
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  really a ten disc survival guide with over a hundred and fifty actionable tips
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  that people can do starting today you know starting right now because we only
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  have a two to three year window I believe it is that to get our house in
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  order by the house I mean there's things we need to be doing questions we need
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  to be asking ourselves people we need to be talking to not least of what who are
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  we need to be talking to our family our friends our pastors our rabbis our
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  preachers because just a few years ago most of them would laugh at us now
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  they're not laughing now they're listening and especially when you can show
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  them a compendium documentary like this where you guys made the film and then
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  it all started to come true because you were talking to the leading minds the
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:02.000]  leading experts that understood what was happening and that's what people
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  should go to thefallofamerica.net and they need to get this compendium it's
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  very affordable you guys spent a lot of money making this what does it come out
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  to about six seven dollars per disc when you get the compendium when you get the
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  compendium that's right it's really very affordable we did our try our best to
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  keep it as low as possible it's seventy nine ninety nine which is about seven
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  or eight dollars per disc but also there's literature in there we also
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  would invite people but yeah it's a very you know respectable price it we would
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  invite people those of Alex to go to our website look let's get real folks this
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  is 2010 okay we're not living in 1998 or 1988 anymore this isn't fear mongering
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  this is truth mongering this is a reality check it's 2010 you've lived through
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  we've all lived through things we thought would never be possible let's start with
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  9-11 right then let's talk about bank failures let's talk about the largest
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  Wall Street failure in the history of our country the socialist bailout right
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  the further destruction of our dollar hyperglobalist well they now admit in
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  the secret america report in the washington post that eight hundred and
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  fifty four thousand private corporate spies with the highest security level
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  what's scary is this is a designed corporate takeover just like bankers
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  want the family farm to go bankrupt they don't want the loan back they want the
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  property this is being done by design but if we're aware of it it's going to
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  lessen how bad it gets a and b if people are educated we can then bring these
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  culprits to justice in your film also covers that
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  i i would like to know it
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  yeah let's go to robert d'nazzi i've been talking to brian correct as i recognize
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  your voices
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  alex you know he hit the nail on the head when you talk about corporations
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  when we set out to make this this nine dvd series when it became that we all
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  look at each other we you know we talked about how we had friends and family
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  you know kind intelligent caring people but they were so caught within the
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  false paradigm of the conservative liberal you know split and so forth
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  that trying to introduce the larger picture to them was like trying to
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000]  extract them from a hall of mirrors you know everywhere they turn everything is
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:28.000]  explained away within the dominant propaganda system and that's really why
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  we set out to make this how can we cut through that and give people a larger
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  perspective because anytime we would introduce something or you talk to your
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  friends and family a lot of your listeners know this people go oh you're
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.000]  conspiracy theorist or you're a gloom and doomer or whatever the case may be
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:47.000]  well you know one of the things that we try to do with this project is
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  introduce a new language that you can use to talk to your friends and family
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  you know most people don't argue the point that the same elite who sit on the
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  boards of directors and run major corporations are the same elite that sit
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  in key government positions and run our political universe so why would you
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.000]  expect the elite who run multinational corporations who want to run a
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:12.000]  government any differently and what a corporations want they want no borders
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  they want to be above the law they don't want to be subject to court they want
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  powerless workers who work cheap and they don't want democracy in the workplace
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:24.000]  they want constant surveillance they want private security and private intelligence
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  and so when you start to look at it that way the things around us start to make a
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  lot more sense and that's why we made it and Robert your film crystalizes that
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  perfectly and now there's no more denying the new world order is a private
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  global corporate government above the law that then passes laws to extract
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  our wealth and enslave us and they openly say they're doing this and that's what
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  your film covers exactly you know I thought I saw the propaganda machine at
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  work is a great example I had seen this is about 2007 right when we got underway
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  with this and I saw a fund manager on CNBC and he actually mentioned the
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  Amaro as a coming currency and that contraction and it kind of went viral
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  and people started talking about it and it was a search term and I told my dad
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  I said see dad there is this thing called the Amaro there will be a North American
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  currency to replace our dollar and not a week later a full page hit piece in the
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:21.000]  Boston Globe connecting the idea of the Amaro to conspiracy fears and you know
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:26.000]  apocalyptic anxiety and now it's all over the news that they have a new cashless
[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  global currency called the SDR and we're going to be forced to pay carbon taxes
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  to fund these private bankers now the world government's not being denied
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  that's right and Alex you bring up a good point this is Brian again you bring up
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:46.000]  a great point fighting these people and I would say the best way to fight someone
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:51.000]  first is to make sure that your house is in order how are you going to fight
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  someone if you don't have food on your table how are you going to fight someone
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  if you don't have the means to protect yourself at home or your family you're
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:03.000]  not just going to not be able to fight them politically you're going to be
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:08.000]  dependent on them that's right which is what they want so our film really the
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:14.000]  fall of America really is about becoming self-reliant it's about getting off the
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  grid it's about asking tough questions of yourself and your family what would you
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  do for example if the power grid failed what would you do if there were no food
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:31.000]  on the supermarket shelves what would you do if martial law happened what would
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  you do if we have further past it of draconian laws stay there stay there I
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.000]  want to come back and continue with mr. Kraft and mr. Denaze because you know my
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:44.000]  wife and I we've been getting ready for years and now we understand that this
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  isn't just a option or a probability that there's going to be a total collapse
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  we're hoping that there's some small chance that it isn't going to be a total
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  collapse so I mean I believe everything I'm saying here folks and so do these
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:02.000]  filmmakers the fall of America net will be right back hi this is Alex Jones did

[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  informed the better chance we've got of surviving through this gentlemen you were
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  trying to finish up a point now mr. Kraft you were getting into that we don't
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  want to be dependent on these people and the first step in fighting back is
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  being self-sufficient continue the first step in fighting back is getting your
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  own house in order look I'm assuming that people who listen to your program
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  alex are in part at least awake your if you're listening to this program you
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  know you're listening for a reason you're you're partly awake however I can't
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  tell you how many people I know even though you awake one who still say
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  things to me like it can't happen here in America come on and the reason they
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:04.000]  say that is because they've never known any different they have roads to get to
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  their office with or to get to the beach with or whatever to the baseball
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  diamond with there's food in the supermarket there's gas in their tank
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:22.000]  and they say things to me like it can't happen here in America Alex I'd like to
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  get your thought what can it happen here in America well the answer is it is
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:32.000]  happening look at Mexico that's been poor but it's completely collapsing look
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.000]  at Greece look at Spain look at how they're talking about taking the pension
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:42.000]  funds they've created 1.5 quadrillion the Washington Post says 600 trillion but
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  it doesn't matter at that point whether it's 600 trillion or 1.5 quadrillion
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  they have created a black hole of debt that is designed to wreck society the
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  global controllers want a post-industrial society they want a collapse so they
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  can reorganize things and I mean that's what Time magazine said last week was
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  people are going to be so poor they won't be able to afford to have children
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  and that's a good thing for the environment this is a diabolical plan
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  it is happening here by design that's my answer and and it's a good answer and
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:22.000]  the reality is if you believe that then you have in the next very next set of
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:28.000]  questions that a discerning intelligent Alex Jones listeners should be asking
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:34.000]  himself or herself is the following what would you do if the power failed what
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  would you do if you turned your sink on and there'd be no tap water and let me
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  interrupt and then have you continue to go back to Mr. Denaze but you know I'm
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  Alex Jones I'm supposedly on top of all this I know it's real and I've made more
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  preparations at most but I haven't made a lot of the preparations I need to I'm
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  looking at my wife going we've got to move to the country she's like yes we've
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  got to get out of here but I'm so busy in the daily grind to fight in the New
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  World Order I haven't done half of what I should have so the point is it's time
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:06.000]  for people to stop procrastinating and a great place a focal point is to watch
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:13.000]  the how many hours long is your film it's over 10 hours with the bonus that we
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  give away yeah so so I mean for the next 10 days folks watch an hour every night
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  write notes they've got a booklet to do that in and create your own plan you'll
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  focus make it important I want my listeners to be prepared regardless of
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  what happens in a great place to start is the fall of America dot net that's
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  right and you know don't be overwhelmed that's the other message I would say
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  don't be overwhelmed it is going to be a lot of work and it may take you the
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  next year of you know maybe a couple hours a day to get this done but you
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  have to get it done let me ask you this what choice do you have if you believe
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  in what is talked about on the Alex Jones program the answer is you don't
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  have a choice let me ask you this let me ask you this why until 40 years ago or
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:02.000]  so did every rural household my grandparents you name it that you
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  went to they were canning they had food for almost a year they were prepared for
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:10.000]  collapse because they'd lived through the depression but before that their
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.000]  their grandparents had lived through even more every culture has always put away
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  things and been prepared that's common sense because they were living closer to
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  the field closer to reality they'd been through this before and I'll assure you
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  our great-grandkids and our grandkids they're going to be more prepared than
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  us because they're going to go through this it's that we've been so fat dumb
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  and happy and inserted into this matrix and this what Robert was talking about
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  this full spectrum of false information this propaganda universe that we are
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  just right for the slaughter and that's why all the economists we talked to
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:47.000]  called the greatest depression because it all the evidence shows it's going to be
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  the worst ever because we are so dependent we're on the March the
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:30:00.000]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:05.000]  thousands of Americans are facing evacuation if you or any of your loved

[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:05.000]  the question is where should the American people draw their line in the
[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:11.000]  sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:15.000]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two
[02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.000]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:23.000]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to

[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:06.000]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:10.000]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.000]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:18.000]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:22.000]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:27.000]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:31.000]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:35.000]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:39.000]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:42.000]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.000]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:05.000]  this is our land
[02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.000]  these are our people
[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.000]  the workers
[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000]  the strivers
[02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000]  the builders
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  these are our people
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.000]  who are they?
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:35.000]  they are the dark armies
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:38.000]  the dark murdering armies is only honor
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:41.000]  is atrocity
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:45.000]  the answer to 1984
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:50.000]  is 1776
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:34:03.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  there is a war on for your mind
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  thank you so much for joining us today on this Wednesday the 21st day of July
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  2010 you know I was thinking during the break
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:21.000]  of Ohio and Michigan and California where they'll have
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.000]  120-something sheriff's deputies and they lay them off down to 44
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:28.000]  and they say in that one Ohio County buy guns
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  we're only gonna basically write tickets and raise money
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  our police will now just be tax collectors one deputy per shift
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  three a day will be out there one at one time
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:44.000]  to respond to crime I think of the Oakland police chief two weeks ago saying
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  we're not gonna respond to burglary robbery
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  people being poisoned by design arson
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  we're not gonna respond so the bigger the government gets the more taxes we pay
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  it all goes to interest of the bankers
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:02.000]  and this is the road warrior type collapse I keep talking about
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.000]  that the globalist have designed this is their stated goal
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000]  finishing up the points you were making Brian Kraft
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.000]  we're gonna go back to Robert Denazi and get some of his take on what's happening with society
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:17.000]  but that point I just raised there I mean I see these headlines daily
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:21.000]  I know what happens in other countries we are collapsing into a third world situation
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:26.000]  most nations live very close to a road warrior type scenario
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  much of Africa is like the movie the road
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  you know it's um I think it's very clear to most who listen to you
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.000]  that we are truthfully in the final phase of the meltdown
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  I mean I said last time I was on your show
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:47.000]  we're an inning three of the nine inning greater depression
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  um and I don't think but even saying that Alex
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:55.000]  I don't know that people still can grasp what that
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  means um and so I think it's important to paint
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:03.000]  a picture for people for the visual picture for people
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:07.000]  so they can realize that this is not only serious but that they must act
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  now and so I asked people
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  who contact me and ask for suggestions and we've received
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  thousands of emails by the way so this so people are waking up
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:23.000]  um I asked people to ask themselves the simplest
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  of questions and those questions start with
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:31.000]  what would you do if the power grid failed
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:35.000]  what would you do if you turned on your tap and no water
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  came out or if the government tripled the price that's actually what the IMF
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  World Bank do there you go what would you do if there was a collapse
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.000]  of law and order and you were truly out there fending for yourself what would you
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  do if you woke up and gas was
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  $12 a gallon or there was no someone that siphoned the gas
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  out of your tank what would you do if there were mass migration
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.000]  out of the city what would you do if the dollar collapsed
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  how much food does the average American have in there
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:11.000]  covered enough for what Alex a week or two weeks to feed their family that's not
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  enough and so we're trying
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:19.000]  to get the word out look here's what we want people to do if you have
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  ears to hear and eyes to see and you truly
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.000]  call yourself a true seeker a patriot
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  an American someone who really wants to see the world that our
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:35.000]  founders or the country that our founders intended
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  then just do this go to the website
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  thefallofamerica.net
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  download the free gold report that's right there on the
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  home page tell 10 to 15 of your
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  friends about the trailer watch it with them if you can afford it
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  it's not expensive buy the film and
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  discuss that's all do that one thing discuss and
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  watch the trailer in the film start there I think
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  your audience who does this when they go
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  and they read through the voluminous amount of information on the website
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  will see the truth and wake up and start preparing to
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  survive this thing well I mean there is a small
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:27.000]  chance that the bankers could back off but I've talked to so many economists and I've studied
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:31.000]  so much history and they've stated over and over again this is
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  mathematically impossible to get out of unless we arrest
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  the Federal Reserve heads unless and that's what the film
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.000]  The Secret of Oz covers is monetary solutions to extricate
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  ourselves out of this I mean if we had good people running things we could fix this and
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  get out of it I mean if we'd elected Ron Paul and they hadn't assassinated him if he got elected
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  and he was able to do things we would be able to reverse things but he
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  said it would still be really tough but the fact is the globalist have got
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  the accelerator all the way down to the metal and this
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  is the direction they want to go order out of chaos and
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  so we're trying to wake people up so that as we go into this crisis
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  the controllers can't spin things even into more power
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  form in fact look at this today Obama signs the financial overhaul
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  legislation Obama signs sweeping financial overhaul into
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  law and it's in record that this gives the Federal Reserve not just
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  power over monetary but everything and the entire economy and gives them
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:35.000]  unlimited autonomy as the Washington Post said
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  to do whatever they want and gobble up other banks and insurance companies
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.000]  that's why the Texas Banking Association has come out and exposed them and criticized it
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  and said it's a fraud but they create the banking crisis the made off type
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  scam then their solution is more power this is just the evidence they're not
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  backing off they've committed so many crimes they're now committed all or nothing
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  they're all in and I wanted to get Robert Denazy's
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:03.000]  comments on what Mr. Kraft and I have been talking about
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  I could agree more Alex I mean look here's this thing Federal Reserve
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  having given private banks the right to lend us our own currency
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:15.000]  at interest and inflation has been historically the greatest
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  wealth transfer scam ever concocted by anybody
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:23.000]  makes our value our wealth that we produce as middle class Americans
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  and transfers it into the hands of the elite that's what it's for
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  I'm a little less optimistic then that they even Ron Paul that the dollar could be saved
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  one because they have no incentive to save it the whole point for them is to print
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  more and more and more because every time they lend us more we owe them more interest
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  so that's not going to happen let's be reverted back to the gold standard
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  which brings me back to Brian's comments on being prepared
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  the reality is maybe a lot of us aren't in a position where we can go off into
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  the woods somewhere in the country and build a second home or be off the grid or whatever
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  but the single most fundamental thing that you can do is own
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  gold in a variety of ways and
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  never mind the water not turning on tomorrow morning I mean we all woke up to 9-11
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  can you imagine waking up to a financial 9-11 turn on your TV
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  the markets collapse you're told that your dollars are no longer currency
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  you're going to have to be exchanged for something else
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  that is very very real and that was the thing that I was
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:27.000]  very concerned with when we started this film
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  you know I had a dream it's kind of funny way back when we were first getting going and in this dream
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  I woke up and I was like oh I didn't do anything it was too late
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  and there were military vehicles rolling down the street and we were being told on loudspeakers
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  that we had to report to our local Liberty Center to get our freedom number
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  20 years before I was even awake
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  well you know the thing is it's you know what we're trying to do with this I really
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  caught on to the power of you know disseminating information in grassroots ways
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  when I was on the set of flight plan of all things
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:03.000]  I had made a film previously years ago and I brought a couple of copies down to the set
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  and I gave them to a few of my friends on the crew and you know our star
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  Judy Foster she happened to be sitting there and I never in a million years thought she'd asked me for one but she did
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  and I was on a Friday Monday morning her assistant called me down her trailer and I went
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  in and she said this was amazing I need 10 more in a box please I need to give them all my friends
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  and I said this is something I want to do more of
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  well I mean they have the emergency centers
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  act which is to build FEMA camps they've already built them it's like they have a cyber security
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  act after they've already built it they have the real ID act
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  15 years after they've already put it into place federalizing our IDs with
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:43.000]  telemetrics they have built the FEMA centers they are your sports stadiums
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  they are the old military bases and they're gonna and they're out there already
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:51.000]  I always said they are going to now they are advertising them as your local emergency
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  community center the old mall here off I-35
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  got taken over by FEMA two years ago and they come over and tell you
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  to get out of there if you try to videotape them I mean this is a designed
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:07.000]  implosion of society and I just hope folks will go get the film
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:11.000]  The Fall of America at thefallofamerica.net
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:15.000]  because I really do want people to get prepared and that's why
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  I agreed to be in your film let's list one more time for folks everybody that send this
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:23.000]  it's a very eclectic group but they're all basically saying the same thing
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:27.000]  absolutely very eclectic
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.000]  of notable expert Alex that
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  normally agree on very little if anything at all
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.000]  but do agree that America is in sort of a stage
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  two or any three of a collapse so we
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who's the father of Reaganomics
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  we have Naomi Wolfe the New York Times bestselling
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:55.000]  author of course she normally probably doesn't agree with much that Mr.
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:59.000]  Roberts says Alex Jones
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:03.000]  Professor Mark Christian Miller head of media studies at NYU
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  we have Mickey Z a left winger
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  who probably doesn't agree with anything that the notable
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:15.000]  G. Edward Griffin a libertarian believes we have constitutionalist
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:19.000]  and journalist Joseph Farrah
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  the eminent
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:27.000]  economist Douglas Casey who's an anarchist is in the film
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:31.000]  biblical scholar and Klein who talks about how this relates to
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:35.000]  Christianity and Judaism
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  author David Ike historian Doug McIntyre
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:43.000]  and economist David McElvaney there's also
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:47.000]  some literature that comes with the film that's not available elsewhere
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  written by the survivalist
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  and martial law expert David Black so those are the people that are in the film
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  Alex. It's just incredible and again folks
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:03.000]  I suggest you watch this in a 10 day period an hour a night
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:07.000]  write notes think about it that's what I've been doing get the
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:11.000]  9 DVDs and the extra bonus DVD all together in one package
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:15.000]  at thefallofamerica.net and I want to give people that toll free number one more time
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  in case they missed it 800-655-1577
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  800-655-1577 because the last time you were on
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:27.000]  Brian I got calls later at the office saying no where's the number I missed it I
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:31.000]  was wondering the system though is scared that's why they're
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  engaged in a power grab that's why they openly want to take over the internet that's why they
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:39.000]  openly want to shut down what we're doing because what the globalists are engaged in is so
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  outrageously unconstitutional and it's so illegal on its
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:47.000]  face that if we just speak up and say no to them they're going to collapse
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:51.000]  guys what's your view on that instead of us collapsing let's use the collapse
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:55.000]  to bring them down. That's absolutely right
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:59.000]  if we do that we have to be secure in our persons in effect
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  we cannot get out there and help them
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:07.000]  to self implode if we're hungry
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:11.000]  you can't do it if your child at home
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:15.000]  freezing or is perspiring because you can't turn on the air
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:19.000]  or is sick or has the flu or if someone's trying to
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.000]  loot your house we can absolutely
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  miss this opportunity Alex to
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:31.000]  help them sort of kill off themselves with this
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  implosion but we have to be secure first
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:39.000]  well I couldn't agree with you more and
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:43.000]  the good news is we've seen 18 million plus guns sold
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  in the last year and a half that's doubling the previous record and that's only
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:51.000]  accelerating and so the real reason the whole is the fact that the
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:55.000]  American people are so armed that doesn't mean we're out looking for an arm revolution
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:59.000]  or looking for a shootout with thugs or looters but you look at the
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:03.000]  states where people have more guns they have lower crime because the criminals know
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:07.000]  they're not safe that's why they all move to Chicago or New York where the victims have been disarmed
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  where it's happy hunting
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:15.000]  and so the film gets into self defense
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  and a lot more again I want to go back with both of you about your
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:23.000]  journey you set out to make a film about the post 9-11 America and how things
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:27.000]  had changed and what was it like for you as you talked to all these experts
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  many of them which didn't even know each other and they were telling you basically the same thing
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  well Alex if I may that was what was most intriguing about this
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  was that you have people from all across the
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  spectrum left right you know conservative liberal secular religious
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  and for everything they disagreed on what was fascinating
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  and I think what makes our the fall of America and the western world
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  theory so powerful is the common ground makeshift which makes it really hard
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:59.000]  for people like to dismiss like my father he's a republican
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  well you know voted for George Bush the whole thing now there are people in that film
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:07.000]  he would normally dismiss as Pharisees theorists or liberals or whatever
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  but he'll watch the film because Paul Craig Roberts the father
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:15.000]  of Reaganomics is in and then that exposes him to other voices and other perspectives
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  so that was what we were we were finding this common ground and we said
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  okay wait a minute you know these people are vastly vastly different in some ways
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  there's so much overlap they're all saying the same thing and it can't be dismissed as a liberal
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  thing or a conservative thing or you know a conspiracy thing
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  what effect has the film had on your family some of them that
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  might have been scoffing at you earlier well you know
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  they were scoffing at us when we were making the film
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:47.000]  you know again saying oh it's gloom and doomer and everything's fine
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  and that's conspiracy and it can't happen here and all that stuff
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  but through the process of making the film slowly but surely things that we told them
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:59.000]  were going to come about like gold going from $700 an ounce
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  to $1,200 an ounce of like you know the mortgage crisis the subprime
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  explosion bank collapse things that I talked about
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  that we had written into this film that people thought were impossible
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  to run folding before their eyes and so that gave us a lot more credibility
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  well that's what's happened with my broadcast is that I'm just going off
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  the history the research the issues the facts
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  doesn't mean I'm 100% right but overall we've been going in the
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  exact direction of society and predicting it long before
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:35.000]  and so now I've got to contend with the fact that people
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  really do listen to what I say and I've tried to bring the quality of my information
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  that's always been good to an even higher level because of the responsibility
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  of the effect that I have and that my listeners have with this information
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:51.000]  in my films but one thing that
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  you know seeing this collapse coming and now entering the first stages of it
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  has done is it's helped me realize and focus on what's really important in my life
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  you know petty issues and I've never been a very worldly person but you know still
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:07.000]  worldly to a certain extent I'm a lot less worldly than I was even five years ago or even a year ago
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:11.000]  a month ago it's really a focusing
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  of the soul of the psyche of the mind especially when
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  you have children to realize if you studied history just how dangerous
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  things can get and to know that we are going there it's incredible
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  you know Alex you bring up a good point
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  on my own personal journey to get my own house
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  in order because prior to starting this I said
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  everything was wrong like I think most of your listeners but I didn't know
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:43.000]  what was wrong and I didn't know what to do about it once I
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  you know defined it but I gotta say since I've been on this
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:51.000]  journey of getting my own house in order you know I'm starting to feel better about
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  myself as a spiritual being having a human experience
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  I mean I feel better about because I still
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:03.000]  this is key this is key
[02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:07.000]  I'm not a fan of golf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe

[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:37.000]  people are instinctively aware of the fact that much of the world they see is a false
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  reality it's disinformation it's propaganda it's lies
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:45.000]  and when you start tuning into the real world and realizing that the solution is
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:49.000]  facing just how bad things are so you can protect all the good things
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  in the world it is a enlightenment that happens
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:57.000]  it is an acceleration of understanding and you begin to really tune into
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:01.000]  the secrets of the world and creation the mysteries of the
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:05.000]  world and I think that's what Brian is that what you were starting to get into
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  that's exactly where I'm going
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:13.000]  many of us realize that this isn't any way to live at all
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  this isn't fun life doesn't have to be
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  you know neurotic and paranoid and we don't have to be so angry
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  and there's something very wrong with the way in which we've been forced
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:29.000]  into unconsciousness as Jim Morrison said
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  you know we are unconscious
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  but when we wake up as scary as it is
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  as scary as it is to wake up and embrace the moment of now
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:45.000]  and start becoming a spiritual person having a human
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  experience instead of the other way around
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:53.000]  when we realize who we are we do become enlightened
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:57.000]  and without getting too esoteric really what the film is trying to say is
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  this stuff can be fun it's fun
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:05.000]  to take control of your life yes it's exactly to take control
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  of your destiny folks this is a link fee
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:13.000]  well produced film that has so much great information the fall of America

[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  1577 or the fall of America
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  dot net in closing comments
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  Robert Denazy first I would just encourage everybody to go check out the
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  website for two reasons one because Brian has done a great job
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  at making a nine minute trailer which will introduce you to all of the guests
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  in the 9 DVD series and what their perspectives are you really get a sense
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  for what the content is and how it will help you but also which we didn't mention
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  earlier Doug Casey in our film was kind enough to make available to us
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  a very simple 12 page report which is downloadable
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:09.000]  anyone who visits the site as a gift you don't have to sign up for anything
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:13.000]  enter your name or anything it's just the three easiest ways to buy
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  and own gold most people still don't own gold because they're afraid they don't know how to do it
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  it makes it very simple download and share the link with your friends absolutely
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  absolutely well gentlemen I look forward to talking to you again and I'm glad
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:28.000]  that for a lot of people your film is almost like
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:32.000]  prophecy because it was made two years ago and it's evergreen it's even more important
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:36.000]  important and pertinent today for everybody out there
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:40.000]  and I want to commend you for coming on the show and for
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:44.000]  making the film and I'm glad that you interviewed me for the fall of America
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:48.000]  thefallofamerica.net or 800-655-1577 gentlemen God bless you
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:51.000]  God bless you
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:55.000]  well that was a powerful broadcast today ladies and gentlemen you know we do three hours now
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:59.000]  not four because I'm getting some time to do the TV show now but earlier this week we did do
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  the show into the fourth hour we'll be doing that more in the future
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  but I'm working on a chemtrail film and so much more right now but I do believe we're going
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:11.000]  into a collapse if we expose these bankers we might be able to reverse it but either way
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:15.000]  it's going to be rough if you do want to find out about gold specifically
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:22.000]  I'd give minus resources a call they have great literature as well 800-686-237-800-686-237
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:26.000]  or minusresources.com don't forget the Genesis Network website
