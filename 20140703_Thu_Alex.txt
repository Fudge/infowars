[00:53.000 --> 00:58.400]  Alex Jones back in the saddle yet again again thank you so much for joining us
[00:58.400 --> 01:03.000]  today we're going to have Lord Christopher Moncton on with the latest
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.600]  big news on the carbon tax global tax fraud that the globalists are pushing and
[01:09.600 --> 01:12.800]  how they're trying to get that agenda through and how they're trying to shut
[01:12.800 --> 01:17.600]  down free speech and and some other breaking news that will disclose when he
[01:17.600 --> 01:26.200]  comes on with us then professor Daryl Hamamoto will be joining us coming up
[01:26.200 --> 01:36.200]  from UC Davis and the professor went public last week and and contacted
[01:36.200 --> 01:42.700]  info wars.com via Paul Watson with the article Paul Watson then subsequently
[01:42.700 --> 01:49.900]  wrote UC professor immigration influx is about reeducation of society and creating
[01:49.900 --> 01:54.100]  a new permanent underclass see that's the deal they want to exploit these
[01:54.100 --> 01:59.400]  immigrants I don't even dislike these immigrants overall except for the
[01:59.400 --> 02:05.360]  Democratic Party vitriol that they're programmed with that they deserve free
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.760]  welfare you know vote to turn in the guns the government's God the government's
[02:09.760 --> 02:14.400]  bringing in a client group that will pliantly do whatever they're told and I
[02:14.400 --> 02:18.160]  know you know that but the general public knows something's going on they
[02:18.160 --> 02:22.120]  don't know exactly what we've got to get the truthful narrative out against the
[02:22.120 --> 02:29.960]  lying narrative and boy is it getting crazy when we come back from break all
[02:29.960 --> 02:36.500]  hell is breaking loose as Obama signs this executive order and announces a
[02:36.500 --> 02:40.920]  bunch of other executive orders to basically legalize these illegals he
[02:40.920 --> 02:46.400]  says that's how you fix the giant uncontrolled influx is put more of them
[02:46.400 --> 02:53.840]  on welfare make more of them legal that'd be like if someone wanted to stop
[02:53.840 --> 02:59.920]  getting fat they would triple the amount of food they would eat or if you
[02:59.920 --> 03:03.360]  didn't want to die you'd shoot yourself in the head at point blank range with
[03:03.360 --> 03:08.400]  double-lock buckshot with a 12 gauge or if you didn't want to bleed you'd hack
[03:08.400 --> 03:13.080]  your fingers off of the hatchet come here we'll pay for everything it's free get
[03:13.080 --> 03:17.300]  on buses to the United States will bushy deeper and just drop you off in the
[03:17.300 --> 03:22.440]  latest welfare office we'll take you in and now the reporting VA employees
[03:22.440 --> 03:28.840]  switch from processing VA applications to Obamacare applications we actually
[03:28.840 --> 03:34.040]  put incoming applications aside so we could focus on the ACA related
[03:34.040 --> 03:37.800]  applications that came in over last summer that's the whistleblower quote
[03:37.800 --> 03:44.520]  from Fox News with Neil Cavuto so staff sergeant Joe Biggs and the rest of our
[03:44.520 --> 03:48.400]  reporters down there at the border kept pointing out that the VA is basically
[03:48.400 --> 03:52.640]  turning off services it was already bad it's now basically almost like a VA
[03:52.640 --> 03:57.480]  stand-down in many areas and we said wow what's it going to the illegals they
[03:57.480 --> 04:03.360]  get everything paid for and a red carpet but the veterans get nothing is this
[04:03.360 --> 04:08.880]  related and it is now emerging a congressional testimony and closed-door
[04:08.880 --> 04:13.320]  hearings that that is exactly what's happening and when the government wants
[04:13.320 --> 04:22.080]  to cover something up that's what they do is they have a closed-door hearing and
[04:22.080 --> 04:27.160]  then gag everyone that brings in the bombshell information the good news is
[04:27.160 --> 04:29.960]  as the whistleblowers are getting smarter about that there's going to the
[04:29.960 --> 04:34.200]  media whether that be old dinosaur media that'll tell the truth like Fox
[04:34.200 --> 04:39.200]  News on some cases or whether it's the true new media the only real media the
[04:39.200 --> 04:42.800]  real media versus the fake media state-run media versus the people's
[04:42.800 --> 04:48.200]  media the Liberty based truth-based media versus the Decepticon media it's

[05:09.160 --> 05:12.800]  shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[05:12.800 --> 05:17.320]  outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[05:17.320 --> 05:21.040]  chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the

[08:24.960 --> 08:32.360]  we now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the
[08:32.360 --> 08:56.200]  resistance you're listening to Alex Jones one of the claims surrounding this
[08:56.200 --> 09:01.000]  illegal immigration influx is that the White House hasn't sent a clear message
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.800]  that it's not open season at the border and over the weekend Nancy Pelosi
[09:05.800 --> 09:09.920]  visited a border facility in Brownsville Texas and what she saw there
[09:09.920 --> 09:14.480]  prompted her to tug on the heartstrings of the American people she says that we
[09:14.480 --> 09:19.080]  have a moral responsibility to help children that are crossing the southern
[09:19.080 --> 09:23.200]  border but what about these American children that are being treated like
[09:23.200 --> 09:28.680]  terrorists by the TSA here we have an 18 month old and her family that were
[09:28.680 --> 09:34.520]  thrown off a flight because her name was on the no-fly list absolute terrorist
[09:34.520 --> 09:38.240]  and then you know here just it goes on and on we've got a girl that was in a
[09:38.240 --> 09:41.800]  wheelchair she was headed to Disney World with her family and she was so
[09:41.800 --> 09:45.680]  traumatized by that experience that she told her family I don't want to go to
[09:45.680 --> 09:49.920]  Disney World anymore because we all just really enjoy getting patted down by the
[09:49.920 --> 09:56.240]  TSA as if we're the terrorists meanwhile it's open season at the border one of
[09:56.240 --> 10:00.960]  the things that Nancy Pelosi failed to mention is that some of these children
[10:00.960 --> 10:05.520]  are actually active gang members now we've reported before about how border
[10:05.520 --> 10:11.480]  agents are saying that even if these children under 17 admit to actively
[10:11.480 --> 10:15.400]  being in gangs even if they're covered in gang tattoos they're ordered to
[10:15.400 --> 10:20.320]  release these known gang members into America as long as they don't have a
[10:20.320 --> 10:25.760]  current criminal record here in the US meanwhile cops are using pre-crime
[10:25.760 --> 10:31.080]  techniques to detain American citizens who could possibly commit a crime
[10:31.080 --> 10:35.200]  Pima County Sheriff's Department's missed unit the mental health support team
[10:35.200 --> 10:40.120]  takes every threat seriously and now armed with everything known about a
[10:40.120 --> 10:45.960]  subject a new Arizona law says the individual can be brought in
[10:45.960 --> 10:50.360]  voluntarily to a mental health crisis response center without a warrant or
[10:50.360 --> 10:54.840]  court order or visible evidence of danger are we preventing crime I think we
[10:54.840 --> 10:59.480]  are so anyone showing these warning signs can be involuntarily detained in
[10:59.480 --> 11:03.920]  a mental health facility meanwhile if you have the warning signs of gang
[11:03.920 --> 11:08.360]  tattoos all over your body or you admit to being in a gang that's not enough of
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.520]  a warning sign for you to be detained now here's video of police throwing a
[11:13.520 --> 11:18.320]  female professor college professor to the ground and arresting her for
[11:18.320 --> 11:24.480]  illegally crossing the street and here we show video exclusively shot by info
[11:24.480 --> 11:29.560]  wars showing busloads of illegal immigrants being given the VIP treatment
[11:29.560 --> 11:34.120]  for illegally crossing the border so one of the biggest issues facing these
[11:34.120 --> 11:39.000]  unaccompanied illegal alien children is the dangerous journey ahead of them
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.040]  they could be kidnapped pulled into the sex trade drug cartels they could starve
[11:44.040 --> 11:49.840]  dehydrate catch any number of diseases rape murder I mean it's a dangerous
[11:49.840 --> 11:55.080]  journey here Breitbart News reports on the body of an 11 year old child that
[11:55.080 --> 11:59.760]  was found in a border town these kids some are reportedly as young as three
[11:59.760 --> 12:04.520]  months old are being sent on this dangerous journey by themselves by their
[12:04.520 --> 12:09.880]  parents now imagine if parents here in America were you know showing the same
[12:09.880 --> 12:14.200]  kind of disregard for their children here we have a father in Hawaii who was
[12:14.200 --> 12:19.080]  sentenced to one-year probation he was given a $200 fine and he was also forced
[12:19.080 --> 12:24.240]  to take child parenting classes his crime he forced his eight-year-old son to
[12:24.240 --> 12:28.320]  walk nearly a mile home from school because the boy refused to tell his
[12:28.320 --> 12:32.320]  father why he had been disciplined earlier that day well the father wanted
[12:32.320 --> 12:36.160]  to teach him a lesson he said walk it off and by the time you get home you
[12:36.160 --> 12:40.040]  better have a better answer for me than that well the judge ruled that that
[12:40.040 --> 12:44.320]  walking was just too severe of a punishment for this child and the
[12:44.320 --> 12:48.200]  judge said these are different times it's dangerous for children to walk
[12:48.200 --> 12:51.920]  along the highway and there are predators out there walking was
[12:51.920 --> 12:56.640]  considered too severe of a punishment to inflict on a child now clearly if the
[12:56.640 --> 13:01.120]  parents of these unaccompanied illegal minors were here in America they'd be
[13:01.120 --> 13:05.280]  fine they'd be arrested they'd have their parental rights taken away but
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.880]  instead these children are given a bus ticket to any town USA and then they're
[13:09.880 --> 13:13.280]  going to serve as anchor babies for their families and then when their
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.480]  families get here rather than arrest them on the spot they're going to be
[13:17.480 --> 13:21.800]  reunited promptly with their children they're going to be given access to
[13:21.800 --> 13:27.800]  welfare legal representation and amnesty which the Obama administration is
[13:27.800 --> 13:31.960]  reportedly planning to announce it's going to issue executive action to give
[13:31.960 --> 13:36.760]  temporary amnesty and work permits to dreamers parents as early as the fall
[13:36.760 --> 13:40.720]  now while the message of the White House is sending to illegal aliens might be
[13:40.720 --> 13:44.360]  a little fuzzy the message they're sending to the rest of America is quite
[13:44.360 --> 13:50.360]  clear it's not hope and change for America but for everybody else now you
[13:50.360 --> 14:16.360]  can find more reports like these at info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv
[14:20.360 --> 14:35.480]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the

[15:21.280 --> 15:26.600]  satisfaction as we go up against this tyranny is Leanne McAdoo's reports Paul
[15:26.600 --> 15:32.760]  Watson's reports Anthony Gutiarty's reports staff sergeant Joe Biggs reports
[15:32.760 --> 15:39.960]  and others routinely Kit Daniels reports on national television national radio
[15:39.960 --> 15:45.120]  international television and radio our reporters are now news sources all over
[15:45.120 --> 15:50.400]  the globe for dinosaur media and alternative new media and are kicking
[15:50.400 --> 15:56.840]  butt and that's another testament to what you can do out there ladies and
[15:56.840 --> 16:02.080]  gentlemen most of these reporters haven't even worked in mainstream media
[16:02.080 --> 16:07.760]  McBrain worked for was it Scripps Howard news service on TV and print Leanne's

[16:16.120 --> 16:20.440]  media and an engineer and worked at a think tank an investigative journalism
[16:20.440 --> 16:24.200]  but he was trained as an engineer look at what a great job they're doing just
[16:24.200 --> 16:33.120]  off people that entered YouTube contest and now you see them here changing the
[16:33.120 --> 16:39.680]  world just another example of the power of the individual working through free
[16:39.680 --> 16:48.920]  association with others absolutely dynamite dynamite liberty is sexy
[16:48.920 --> 16:56.000]  liberty is cool liberty is fun liberty is like fresh air compared to being
[16:56.000 --> 17:02.640]  drowned in a pit of lies and we are here promoting it we have serious biases
[17:02.640 --> 17:07.200]  around here to tell the truth we get off on being honorable we get off on not
[17:07.200 --> 17:14.840]  being cowards we get off on going up against tyrants that's simple and the
[17:14.840 --> 17:23.000]  establishment calls us a disease I call us the cure and we're into this
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.600]  animating contest we're into this fight like we've got to get that clip from
[17:27.600 --> 17:32.720]  Patton where he says Americans Americans aren't cowards Americans love to fight and
[17:32.720 --> 17:36.000]  he just goes into that whole rant with George C. Scott that's a real speech
[17:36.000 --> 17:41.160]  Patton gave and it's it's time for the American spirit that tyrants worldwide
[17:41.160 --> 17:45.920]  have feared to be rekindled and the tyranny that has possessed us it's time
[17:45.920 --> 17:52.440]  for an exorcism that's what America needs ladies and gentlemen now we are
[17:52.440 --> 17:56.320]  gonna go to break and I'm gonna come back and get into all the news and it's

[25:46.280 --> 25:51.200]  America never lost a fight that was up until we went under UN control for
[25:51.200 --> 25:54.840]  Korea and then Vietnam and it was designed to create a counterculture
[25:54.840 --> 25:59.800]  movement that could pose as heroes and to get the well-meaning young people to

[26:36.120 --> 26:42.000]  the Spanish historians marveled at the American spirit we were exceptional when
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.080]  Vladimir Putin says you're not exceptional and stop thinking you're
[26:45.080 --> 26:48.680]  exceptional he's saying stop being arrogant like you could just do whatever
[26:48.680 --> 26:53.600]  you want you're not exceptional I disagree with Vladimir Putin America was
[26:53.600 --> 26:58.200]  exceptional in many ways on the eve of July 4th and I'm gonna talk tomorrow and

[27:48.680 --> 27:52.440]  government that publicly funds al-qaeda no one else puts up with the illegal
[27:52.440 --> 27:56.160]  aliens being given free welfare and driver's license which they're then
[27:56.160 --> 28:00.200]  allowed to vote with in more than six states and Colorado is set to be the

[36:48.720 --> 36:55.800]  tyranny rediscover our human dignity oppression and all of its diseases will
[36:55.800 --> 37:01.920]  vanish like phantoms at dawn like mist at dawn to quote Thomas Jefferson I'm
[37:01.920 --> 37:09.000]  paraphrasing the quote but if the people are educated in basic liberty and armed
[37:09.000 --> 37:15.600]  and ready to defend their freedom tyranny and all of its corruptions will
[37:15.600 --> 37:25.160]  fade like the mist of phantoms at dawn that's my own paraphrase of the larger
[37:25.160 --> 37:27.960]  quote that I haven't read in years look up at Thomas Jefferson quote about
[37:27.960 --> 37:32.640]  phantoms at dawn I'm gonna be able to actual quote that's what's going on here
[37:32.640 --> 37:36.360]  ignoring it doesn't make it go away it makes it worse and we've now reached
[37:36.360 --> 37:40.800]  that breach point that I that I could intellectually see but also at my gut
[37:40.800 --> 37:46.440]  level feel the last few years where wars are starting from Central Europe
[37:46.440 --> 37:50.880]  Eastern Europe the Middle East to Africa to Asia with China threatening to
[37:50.880 --> 38:01.240]  attack not just Japan now but the Philippines the Philippines
[38:01.440 --> 38:05.760]  officially a month ago said we may just take major islands like the Japanese
[38:05.760 --> 38:13.720]  did in World War II I mean it's it's the headlines are so off the chart and then
[38:13.720 --> 38:17.200]  mainstream news is covering the latest kidnapped child with Nancy Grace and how
[38:17.200 --> 38:22.440]  Alex Jones is deeply racist and behind the Boston bombings and and and and how
[38:22.440 --> 38:25.400]  you know the alternative media needs to be shut down as it's evil and how
[38:25.400 --> 38:31.320]  horrible drudge is I mean it's twilight zone folks the White House has media
[38:31.320 --> 38:38.160]  matters every day attacking this operation and and and other pro-liberty
[38:38.160 --> 38:43.200]  operations wanting us shut down what does that tell you about the all-powerful
[38:43.200 --> 38:51.280]  Soran that is supposedly the New World Order they're not that powerful we could
[38:51.280 --> 38:58.640]  shake them off like fleas if we ever decided to do it and they know that they
[38:58.640 --> 39:02.040]  found the quote enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of
[39:02.040 --> 39:06.000]  body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day Thomas
[39:06.000 --> 39:13.960]  Jefferson and there's a longer quote that I conflated with that earlier part
[39:13.960 --> 39:20.600]  but yeah evil spirits not phantoms
[39:20.600 --> 39:32.680]  yeah are you just on air CJ I'm glad you are because when you talk to me that's
[39:32.680 --> 39:35.760]  why you're you're welcome to pop it anytime you want thanks because it
[39:35.760 --> 39:39.640]  sounds like I'm talking to myself when you talk to me I go yeah that's right
[39:39.640 --> 39:42.840]  like talking to a fan my dad's heard it before go who are you talking it's not
[39:42.840 --> 39:47.200]  like a crazy person I already am obviously insane so please ladies and
[39:47.200 --> 39:54.040]  gentlemen Alex is talking to a real Indian all right I should probably open
[39:54.040 --> 39:57.280]  the phones up I mean there's just so much news here toll-free number to join
[39:57.280 --> 40:03.600]  us first-time callers on this Thursday that feels like a Friday 800-259-9231
[40:03.600 --> 40:11.280]  800-259-9231 in California and other states people are going out with American
[40:11.280 --> 40:15.200]  flags to their border that's been collapsed where the homeland security
[40:15.200 --> 40:19.760]  black buses pull in now from Mexico they're not even dropping them off at
[40:19.760 --> 40:23.320]  the border now they're just bringing them in to then be deployed by the tens of
[40:23.320 --> 40:27.680]  thousands every few days as Democratic Party voters as Colorado other states
[40:27.680 --> 40:34.320]  vote to give them driver's license to vote so all of this is going on right
[40:34.320 --> 40:39.560]  now all of this is unfolding right now and I mean I mean imagine if Mexico was
[40:39.560 --> 40:44.120]  busing US citizens in by the tens of thousands every few days and giving us
[40:44.120 --> 40:48.400]  welfare and letting us vote you would have Mexicans on their border protesting
[40:48.400 --> 40:57.320]  it I mean what are you if you're a citizen and pay taxes what what is it if
[40:57.320 --> 41:05.120]  you are a citizen and then you pay for everything but get nothing the veterans
[41:05.120 --> 41:09.040]  are having their healthcare cut so they can enroll illegals that's in the news
[41:09.040 --> 41:13.840]  that's now on Fox News last night on the El Cavuto with whistleblowers that have
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.080]  told Congress this and nothing's being done I mean it's all a fraud and then
[41:19.080 --> 41:24.280]  Obama's up there going you darn anti-immigrant racist in his speech on
[41:24.280 --> 41:28.640]  over the weekend another speech he gave a few days ago we played clips here how
[41:28.640 --> 41:37.360]  dare you not do anything about the border that's why this is happening and all of
[41:37.360 --> 41:44.960]  this is going on while every other form of lawlessness you can imagine is
[41:44.960 --> 41:51.040]  unfolding and then Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi and Petraeus and all of
[41:51.040 --> 41:54.680]  them are saying at all these big think-tank meetings no this is about
[41:54.680 --> 42:01.040]  North America what comes after America North America that's why they have US
[42:01.040 --> 42:05.800]  troops at public events patrolling Canada I mean that's in the Toronto Star
[42:05.800 --> 42:15.440]  that's in the national post look it up Mexican and Canadian troops are to
[42:15.440 --> 42:23.360]  patrol America Canadian and US troops are to patrol Mexico and vice versa and
[42:23.360 --> 42:28.760]  you know I've got family in the last year who isn't in Afghanistan or Iraq
[42:28.760 --> 42:34.640]  anymore running helicopter operations and ground operations you name it there
[42:34.640 --> 42:41.040]  they're in Mexico and I don't just mean northern Mexico I mean deep in Mexico
[42:43.920 --> 42:55.440]  all State Department run and the public doesn't even know this is going on we
[42:55.440 --> 43:00.400]  had Celica Steel former DEA agent retired Vietnam veteran been a board
[43:00.400 --> 43:07.840]  patrol agent after Vietnam became a DEA saying eight years ago on the show 2005
[43:07.840 --> 43:14.320]  as it was eight years ago nine years ago the videos are public saying our
[43:14.320 --> 43:18.080]  government's training Los Zetas is a CIA secret army did he stabilize and
[43:18.080 --> 43:21.320]  collapse Mexico into the United States and they're going to bring in martial
[43:21.320 --> 43:27.880]  law using it and then Shelley they they came to Shelley and said yeah we heard
[43:27.880 --> 43:31.400]  your interview he did another interview with us and they said in studio with
[43:31.400 --> 43:35.920]  video he was in Kevin Booth's documentary that aired on Showtime as well
[43:35.920 --> 43:40.520]  about it and they came to him and they said you to shut up he's a school
[43:40.520 --> 43:46.320]  teacher in South Texas and then because he was in a divorce and stuff he had to
[43:46.320 --> 43:52.280]  sell his 20 guns to get money and he moved into a trailer you know how
[43:52.280 --> 44:01.200]  divorces are no criminal record school teacher in McAllen and he went to the
[44:01.200 --> 44:05.760]  gun show at three gun shows and sold his guns and a buddy kept saying sell me
[44:05.760 --> 44:09.080]  another shotgun so the shot goes he finally sold the shotgun just like the
[44:09.080 --> 44:17.680]  green beret with Ruby Ridge and the state police pulled him over the ATF and
[44:17.680 --> 44:20.600]  said you're going to prison and they railroad him in the prison for three
[44:20.600 --> 44:26.360]  years for gun-running because he sold his guns they set him up that's why I've
[44:26.360 --> 44:28.760]  had family even say hey I want to buy that gun from you know I'm I've been
[44:28.760 --> 44:35.120]  selling it to you I mean it's it's crazy ladies and gentlemen how screwed up
[44:35.120 --> 44:39.040]  this country is and of course everything Shelley said came out it came out in the
[44:39.040 --> 44:44.040]  El Paso times about three years ago and it came out in the Chicago Tribune three
[44:44.040 --> 44:47.120]  years ago and then over the last two years years after Kurt Nemo reported on
[44:47.120 --> 44:51.920]  it we reported on it that Los Zeta's is totally CIA run came out in federal
[44:51.920 --> 44:55.760]  court to knock out the other groups and destabilize Mexico so the globalists
[44:55.760 --> 45:02.480]  are collapsing Mexico into 130,000 dead in eight years they're overflowing the
[45:02.480 --> 45:06.320]  United States with refugees who then come into the very arms of the
[45:06.320 --> 45:10.920]  globalists who then become political voters in a block to take down the
[45:10.920 --> 45:23.320]  country that's how this works ladies and gentlemen that's how the globalist
[45:23.320 --> 45:38.920]  operate and that's the country we live in you get a divorce you're a sniper of
[45:38.920 --> 45:45.440]  army veteran board patrol agent DEA now a school teacher you sell your guns you
[45:45.440 --> 45:49.720]  go to jail totally legal and lawful they've got judges that would put a two
[45:49.720 --> 45:55.000]  year old into a gas chamber if they were told to you ship tens of thousands of
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.800]  guns into Mexico to destabilize Mexico and blame the Second Amendment you don't
[45:59.800 --> 46:05.040]  get in trouble this is the country we live in where they allow the IRS to do
[46:05.040 --> 46:09.840]  things that are literally a hundred thousand times what Nixon did Nixon had
[46:09.840 --> 46:13.560]  a hundred and twenty-something names in a safe never used them with their IRS
[46:13.560 --> 46:18.520]  records Obama publicly uses the IRS on tens of thousands of people quoting
[46:18.520 --> 46:22.720]  innocent people in jail persecuting political speech arresting the next
[46:22.720 --> 46:31.320]  to Suza and doesn't get in trouble you see this is the total lawless evil that
[46:31.320 --> 46:34.800]  they have allowed and then they've got coyotes publicly shipping people across
[46:34.800 --> 46:39.120]  on jet skis shooting anybody in the head that gives them a problem when you get
[46:39.120 --> 46:42.080]  shot in the head and your husband dies the media says oh you're just being
[46:42.080 --> 46:46.320]  racist and make this up maybe the wife shot the guy in the head until they get
[46:46.320 --> 46:49.800]  caught shooting more people in the head
[46:52.440 --> 46:58.720]  I mean it's a joke America is gone America is a giant joke to the world
[46:58.720 --> 47:03.880]  because we act like a joke you take your shoes off your belt off you get yelled
[47:03.880 --> 47:08.240]  at by the TSA you go through the lines you get naked body scanned until you
[47:08.240 --> 47:12.720]  sign up for trusted traveler and wave all your rights into their system which
[47:12.720 --> 47:16.160]  is the national ID card they planned all along and then now I notice at the
[47:16.160 --> 47:19.760]  airport they're phasing it back in to still search you when you do that I
[47:19.760 --> 47:23.840]  mean we know their whole plan even the TSA people they call themselves agents
[47:23.840 --> 47:29.400]  they don't know what's going on and by the way I saw them putting little kids
[47:29.400 --> 47:32.680]  back on the naked body scanners Congress told them don't do that anymore
[47:32.680 --> 47:36.200]  we'll defund you and they go okay we'll stop and they didn't stop because it's
[47:36.200 --> 47:43.200]  a military operation against us our government funds ISIS I have a stack
[47:43.200 --> 47:50.960]  of articles here they arrested people in Austin and Houston last month in
[47:50.960 --> 47:56.000]  Austin and Houston last month for trying to go join ISIS to fight and now a
[47:56.000 --> 48:02.760]  woman in Colorado has been arrested for trying to give material aid to ISIS
[48:02.760 --> 48:08.480]  which is al Qaeda now my issue is our government publicly gave them stinger
[48:08.480 --> 48:17.160]  missiles our government has opened the border up for nationals out of Syria
[48:17.160 --> 48:22.280]  Iraq you name it on record to be pouring across China Pakistan it's just
[48:22.280 --> 48:26.560]  wide open and people from all the world are landing now in airports in Mexico
[48:26.560 --> 48:31.640]  it's on the news down there overflowing to then take flights into the US or to
[48:31.640 --> 48:36.120]  take flights up to the border and come right across and then but they'll arrest
[48:36.120 --> 48:41.160]  you though if you try to give material support because one hand doesn't know
[48:41.160 --> 48:46.160]  what the other hand's doing see or it creates headlines I guess that scare the
[48:46.160 --> 48:48.680]  public that there's a terror threat of course it's a terror threat our
[48:48.680 --> 48:54.440]  government's illegitimate and is running it so that's just some of the
[48:54.440 --> 48:59.680]  information smugglers threaten landowners in Cameron County Texas
[48:59.680 --> 49:05.960]  CDC ignores diseases illegal crisis we reported on that yesterday today HHS
[49:05.960 --> 49:13.120]  reports that that indeed is going on and that they are quote responding to it
[49:13.120 --> 49:16.640]  no they're not they're busting them in ladies and gentlemen they're just
[49:16.640 --> 49:20.120]  releasing them it's incredible I'm gonna go to break come back and talk to

[49:43.040 --> 49:47.960]  underclass literally slaves of the government and he's not saying that
[49:47.960 --> 49:51.600]  because he dislikes the mainly Hispanic immigrants it's that it's being done on
[49:51.600 --> 49:56.640]  purpose to create a new permanent Hispanic slave class that loves their
[49:56.640 --> 50:00.920]  slavery under racial identity this is how you make slaves you make them love
[50:00.920 --> 50:07.960]  it so that's coming up and he's an expert on that so briefly we will sell out of

[57:13.840 --> 57:17.880]  you're endangering the public by your free speech Monsanto will tell

[57:26.240 --> 57:30.680]  you can't be here this is what they do this is the new attitude I have videos

[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:44.560]  but from an expert position of ours to create a permanent slave class a
[1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:48.920]  political voting block the Democrats tried to forge the black community into
[1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:52.200]  but that's not a big enough group for them to fully dominate election cycles
[1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:56.920]  so they're trying to use racial control and primitive programming which is very
[1:00:56.920 --> 1:01:03.320]  effective on humans period on Hispanics to forge them into a race-based cult that
[1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:09.160]  has gun control open borders the end of the family as its sacraments let's go
[1:01:09.160 --> 1:01:14.880]  to David in Florida thanks for calling you're on the air hi Alex thanks for
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:18.560]  taking the call long-time listener present planet subscriber wanted
[1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:23.920]  welcome back for vacation thank you shot off at the prior caller for standing up
[1:01:23.920 --> 1:01:29.040]  for our rights that's a whole thing he's doing but the reason I called you
[1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:33.120]  today is I wanted to talk to you about that interview that Karen Hughes of the
[1:01:33.120 --> 1:01:36.360]  IMF just did it was posted on the website a couple of days ago it was
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:41.880]  actually they put out by SGT reports that you guys said re-linked it and he
[1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:46.320]  had a chance that the list of that that interview yet and get a read on what
[1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:51.040]  she's saying about the Federal Reserve get ready to collapse you haven't we
[1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:57.360]  had her on before yeah yeah we've had her on let's get her on next week in
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:01.280]  fact I've been meaning to get her on I actually watched some of that interview
[1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:07.960]  listen to some of that interview the that SGT folks do a great job and I do
[1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:11.080]  want to get her on to talk about that but that's that's what a bunch of
[1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:17.200]  billionaires are saying right now an economist so it's very frightening well
[1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:21.520]  absolutely but she's she actually stated in that interview that the dollar is
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:27.040]  going to be replaced by a gold standard currency well you know she was mid level
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:31.080]  and I think she's an eloquent person who has a lot of courage so I think she's
[1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:36.400]  a very credible nice person but I've interviewed her before and I just don't
[1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:42.600]  think that you know everything she says is exactly the way it is the IMF and
[1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:52.400]  World Bank have discussed a global 10% backed SDR 10% back with gold so they
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:56.320]  could then manipulate gold at the same time but still have fractional reserve
[1:02:56.320 --> 1:03:00.880]  banking but then a lot of the Davos and Bilderberg people don't even want that
[1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:06.960]  they want it pegged to digital transfers any type of online banking any type of
[1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:11.800]  purchases in a casual society with a global Tobin overlaid with a global
[1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:20.440]  carbon which is basically an omnibus VAT and I think that's the way it's going
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:25.400]  but I look forward to having her on what do you think about it well I had some
[1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:29.680]  problems trying to understand the crowd credibility piece because it doesn't
[1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:33.760]  align the scripture as you know number one and number two the fact she's been
[1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:37.520]  reinstated to the IMF was a little bit suspect to be a senior council I mean
[1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:41.840]  she was being chased by the Justice Department of the US last time you
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:44.800]  interviewed her and all of a sudden she's back into position position she
[1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:50.640]  held previously well I mean I think she's my gut is she's a real lady and not a
[1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:54.760]  bad person a lot of times if you make enough noise and you don't shut up from
[1:03:54.760 --> 1:04:01.880]  the intimidation they try to buy you off I mean I've literally no exaggeration
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:08.160]  at least six seven times been offered huge contracts way more money than I even
[1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:12.640]  make now to join the establishment so that's actually what they do in my
[1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:17.720]  experience is they either kill you put you in prison but if you're too too
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:20.320]  obnoxious and they don't want to make a big deal out of it they try to buy you
[1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:22.280]  off and I'm not saying that's what's happened because I haven't been
[1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:26.160]  following it it's just that they will try to get you back into the fold to try
[1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:30.160]  to get some control over you I don't want me to dominate so much your type it
[1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:32.680]  before I let you go I just want to let you know I'm holding you and whole staff

[1:08:05.640 --> 1:08:13.600]  the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:08:16.080 --> 1:08:21.120]  I have been syndicated for almost 18 years I've been on air 19 and a half
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:30.080]  years and since I've been syndicated back in 1997 late 1997 we have had the
[1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:35.640]  line broadcasting from deep behind enemy lines in occupied former United
[1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:39.760]  States and the reason I've always put that out is because under the North
[1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:45.160]  American Union under globalization the EU model was the model for Asia and then
[1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:51.280]  the Americas and then the Caribbean and then Africa under that undemocratic
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:59.800]  unelected model you are literally occupied and in 2007 judicial watch
[1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:04.400]  sued and got the absolute rosetta stone of this thousands of pages that I
[1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:11.120]  spent weeks at night when my small children were growing up literally
[1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:16.560]  reading it so that I would understand much of the full plan from the Banff
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:21.120]  Canada three-day meeting where you had select inside crony capitalists there
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:27.600]  commanding the ministers of the governments from secretary of state on
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:32.240]  down on what was being set up they were actually having parliamentary votes
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:36.680]  under the secret agreement signed by Bush and the sent a fox at Baylor
[1:09:36.680 --> 1:09:42.560]  University in 2005 and so you have to be honest that we are literally in an
[1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:46.080]  occupied territory just as Lord Monkton who helped found a UKIP a few
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:49.520]  decades ago with Nigel Farage now the fastest growing party not just in the
[1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:55.080]  UK but in Europe they are the tea party in Europe trailblazing not copying our
[1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:59.720]  tea party our tea party came out of England parliament first voted to not
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:02.800]  have war with George Washington until King George went down and said you've
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:07.040]  got to have a war so it the fight that we have an America for freedom started
[1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:12.040]  with Magna Carta in England in 1215 and then what came out of that the
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:15.720]  Renaissance and everything else that followed we now were continuing that
[1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:20.800]  same fight globally we're all in this together what started in England and
[1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:26.880]  spread all over the world continues on the true spirit of 1776 against
[1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:31.440]  tyrants everywhere whether they be big corporations governments mentally ill
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:37.920]  kings it doesn't matter we have a right to self-determine and be free and if you
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:43.760]  look at how they're usurping our freedom it is the same old story being
[1:10:43.760 --> 1:10:48.520]  replayed and so we know how to beat this we know how to stand against it so I
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:54.320]  say broadcasting from deep behind enemy lines that's not fiction that's not
[1:10:54.320 --> 1:10:59.160]  hyperbole that's not hype I'm in FEMA region 6 Obama has opened the border
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:02.960]  hundreds of thousands of illegals are pouring across which will detonate the
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:07.280]  new flood that will be millions which will be the crisis and then I remembered
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:14.680]  Tony Blair in 97 98 99 I would watch it in and other channels online and when I
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:18.080]  traveled to England I would watch them as well and Paul Watson reporting from
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:23.120]  the UK would would would write on it how he got caught let telling the border
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:28.400]  patrol in France working in a secret deal with France to ship in hundreds of
[1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:32.360]  thousands of illegals to be put directly on labor dole to then become the
[1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:37.040]  social workers and the new political dominating attack dogs I've had even
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:39.760]  liberal members of parliament on admitting this from England this is now
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:43.920]  well known you could type in Tony Blair secret immigration deal you'll get
[1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:50.200]  stories with France Romania you name it Obama has done this with Mexico to open
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:53.840]  their southern border to flood us with Central and South American dregs
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:59.840]  criminals unemployed women with children and their stacks of news so to
[1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:06.480]  understand the EU and how 80 plus percent of the laws in England are sent
[1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:11.160]  by the EU bureaucracy not even the EU Parliament and people in the UK can't
[1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:16.600]  even vote I wanted to bring this up before we get into his new challenge and
[1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:20.120]  new breaking news on the climate change fraud and just some amazing information
[1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:25.280]  but I wanted to bring this up with Lord Moncton first because he pioneer with
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:29.080]  Nigel Farage the game plan that's beginning to take Europe back and his
[1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:32.720]  political class is panicking I cannot build up this man enough ladies and
[1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:38.360]  gentlemen or Nigel Farage who is just a rock star I mean he's like Ron Paul but
[1:12:38.360 --> 1:12:44.720]  also has that super appeal of not just a medical doctor but of more of a super
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:50.040]  leader but but he's also a blue-collar working guy so he just has it all these
[1:12:50.040 --> 1:12:54.040]  are the leading lights that can literally turn the whole world around and we
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:57.480]  have to recognize that so many people got introduced to Lord Moncton Nigel
[1:12:57.480 --> 1:13:03.000]  Farage is coming on for ten years on this radio show again to show the power
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.080]  of the people and the fact that our movement for global liberty has only
[1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:12.880]  just begun now I'm ranting here but the point is they point out most of our laws
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:17.840]  are made by the EU we have no right it's a dictatorship by upping the
[1:13:17.840 --> 1:13:22.280]  rhetoric to the level of reality I mean when you're under tyranny you call it
[1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:26.240]  what it is you're not polite about it we're doing the same here we are in an
[1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:31.720]  occupied illegitimate globalist EU system now Obama's about to sign this new
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:36.520]  Pacific trade deal that takes over internet freedom you name it gun control
[1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:41.400]  you name it it's all happening global governance is here and recognizing it and
[1:13:41.400 --> 1:13:45.200]  the fact that it's undemocratic it's unelected it's authoritarian it's
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:50.520]  crony we'll end it so I want to first spend this segment on that subject and
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:14:00.800]  then get into an outrageous challenge by a professor claiming that you know
[1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:03.920]  prove climate change isn't real I'll give you thirty thousand dollars but then
[1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:06.520]  admitting it's not really a real challenge like the professor here in
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:10.640]  Austin that said he'd live in a in a trash bin for a year to prove we can
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:14.800]  all live with less and then it turned out he didn't really stay there I mean
[1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:18.600]  this is outrageous we're talking about that and so much more about the stunts
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:23.360]  they pull and the latest but Lord Christopher Moncton top journalist
[1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:27.600]  former top advisor to Margaret Thatcher and so much more and the leading
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:32.320]  scientist exposing the fraud everything he's written about on his site in the
[1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:36.640]  last decade has all been proven absolutely accurate and so now they're
[1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:41.400]  calling for his arrest and execution in major publications because they're such
[1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:45.440]  liberals is Lord Christopher Moncton but but what about the fact that our
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:49.840]  borders wide open I mean this is epic this is totally epic and the same
[1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:54.720]  thing's been done to the UK what are we facing how do we stop it well it's very
[1:14:54.720 --> 1:15:00.680]  difficult to stop it when you elect a left-wing government because once they
[1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:05.800]  take office Alex they then want to hold on to office and eventually they become
[1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:09.560]  unpopular because high taxes and low government performance eventually people
[1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:13.960]  get bored of that but the way they can turn the terms of political trade in
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:20.360]  their favor is to say right we'll let in left-wing immigrants poor immigrants
[1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:24.560]  from wherever we can get them because the first generation of those immigrants
[1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:28.760]  will always vote left and this has been increasingly the pattern now you see it
[1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:33.960]  with Tony Blair you see it certainly with Obama in order to get Obama elected
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:38.760]  he was elected by people who largely didn't originally come from the United
[1:15:38.760 --> 1:15:43.680]  States they came from somewhere else and those are the ones that will vote left
[1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:48.240]  because the left will promise them handouts which they say they will take
[1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:53.080]  from the rich to give to the poor and so the left can can live off this and
[1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:57.880]  gain themselves office for longer and longer periods as a result of it and
[1:15:57.880 --> 1:16:03.000]  of course in the end what will defeat them is that however hard they tried to
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:07.280]  trash the economy with climate change measures run the world everybody is
[1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:11.840]  paying no attention and most countries are getting rapidly a great deal richer
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:16.520]  as prosperity increases so that it eventually will even reach places like
[1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:20.880]  Mexico which are largely very poor at the moment but they will become more
[1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:26.480]  wealthy the pressure for immigration to still wealthier countries will diminish
[1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:30.840]  and when that happens the left will be extinguished so I think we're going
[1:16:30.840 --> 1:16:37.040]  through a temporary difficulty where the left will bend the electoral rules to
[1:16:37.040 --> 1:16:41.240]  by letting people in and then giving them the vote as Tony Blair did in Britain
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:46.280]  and as Obama is doing on a very large scale in the United States Obama is the
[1:16:46.280 --> 1:16:51.960]  most nakedly partisan political president you've ever had he doesn't see
[1:16:51.960 --> 1:16:56.240]  himself as president of the United States he sees himself as the chief
[1:16:56.240 --> 1:17:01.240]  rights commissar he sees himself as the effect for the king and he does
[1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:05.760]  undoubtedly have a deep I mean I didn't believe this is a two years ago when he
[1:17:05.760 --> 1:17:10.640]  put out America 2016 that it really was the fact that Obama truly hated free
[1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:13.920]  market and wealth and success because you tend to think once you're the
[1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:17.520]  president and once people are in power they understand that wealth and
[1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:21.200]  prosperity is a good thing that I mean that's an instinct for normal well
[1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:25.400]  adjusted people but then you realize no they really want to shut off our power
[1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:30.200]  plants open our borders wreck the whole culture attack the family I mean these
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:35.120]  people are mentally ill degenerates never underestimate the extent to which
[1:17:35.120 --> 1:17:40.320]  the left hate the West they hate the countries that bring them up they hate
[1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:45.320]  the prosperity they hate the success they hate the democracy they hate the
[1:17:45.320 --> 1:17:50.280]  liberty they hate the freedom they do not want it they want absolute control
[1:17:50.280 --> 1:17:55.320]  that's why the word totalitarian is so important it means somebody who wants to
[1:17:55.320 --> 1:17:59.760]  control every little aspect of your life down to the last flickering poisonous
[1:17:59.760 --> 1:18:03.480]  mercury filled light bulb and of course that's the word for them they are
[1:18:03.480 --> 1:18:08.040]  totalitarians that's the thing and this is a very ancient divide in politics
[1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:12.120]  which you and I have talked of before Alex it goes right back to early Imperial
[1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:17.520]  China where the totalitarians were known as legalists and the more enlightened
[1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:21.440]  libertarians the likes of you and me Alex we were called the confusions and
[1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:25.720]  this divide between legalism and Confucianism between totalitarianism
[1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:29.280]  and libertarianism between those who would control us and we who would be
[1:18:29.280 --> 1:18:33.920]  free and we who would allow others to be free that divide is the fundamental
[1:18:33.920 --> 1:18:39.280]  divide in politics and always has been and probably always will be because it's
[1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:43.720]  the control freaks that like to go into government and a control freak of course
[1:18:43.720 --> 1:18:48.320]  is a totalitarian he wants to control everything the totality of what is
[1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:53.680]  within his reach and this is what Obama is all about and what is interesting
[1:18:53.680 --> 1:18:59.720]  about it is a growing sense that of quasi-moral superiority that they have
[1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:05.360]  they like to say we have to save the planet from itself because only we
[1:19:05.360 --> 1:19:10.920]  understand the need to save the planet from global warming for instance now
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:15.720]  this is basically a device to try to cover up that what they're really doing
[1:19:15.720 --> 1:19:20.800]  is nakedly partisan Obama doesn't like the coal industry because the coal
[1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:24.720]  industry are and have long been the biggest donors to the Republican Party
[1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:29.800]  who are his opponents it is as simple as that it has nothing whatsoever to do
[1:19:29.800 --> 1:19:33.880]  with the climate that's why he makes such idiotic statements about it every
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:37.600]  time he speaks about it for instance it was a wonderful moment I think about ten
[1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:43.160]  days ago in the Senate well I think it was senator Graham was cross-examining
[1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:48.640]  five former heads of the environmental destruction agency and there they all
[1:19:48.640 --> 1:19:52.040]  were sit on I want to hear that story straight ahead with Lord Christopher

[1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:44.400]  gonna have professor Hamamoto on who's saying this border being open is
[1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:48.760]  exactly what Lord Monkton just said total social engineering with a
[1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:54.880]  permanent political underclass of the system and we need gridlocking government
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:58.480]  it's designed to have separation of powers if the Republican Party was trying
[1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:03.640]  to extinct the Democratic Party I want a third a fourth a fifth party I would be
[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:07.000]  defending the Democratic Party I've never thrown my weight behind the
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:11.800]  Republicans until now that is the Republican Tea Party movement because
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:14.560]  the Republican leadership along with the Democrats is trying to extinct it
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:19.280]  right now this is a big deal the Democrats is what Lord Monkton just
[1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:24.080]  sort of getting at are in a political takeover mode for a political oligarchy
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:29.960]  to carry out a totalitarian system and they're not making any bones about it
[1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:34.040]  they say we have the moral authority we are gonna arrest people to disagree with
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:37.720]  climate change you don't have a right to promote pro-gun stuff and terrorize
[1:25:37.720 --> 1:25:42.760]  people Hillary said we want to arrest you but the enemy is an al-Qaeda it's the
[1:25:42.760 --> 1:25:47.240]  Tea Party I mean this is outrageous stuff going on it's for real and Lord
[1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:51.880]  Monkton was speaking to that and then he also started getting into the climate
[1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:55.240]  fraudsters being questioned in Congress go ahead Lord Monkton yeah just to tell
[1:25:55.240 --> 1:26:00.960]  you the story about these four or five ex-administrators of the environmental
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:05.480]  destruction agency and center grain was questioning them he said hands up any of
[1:26:05.480 --> 1:26:10.480]  you who think that mr. Obama was right when he said that temperatures are
[1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:17.440]  rising faster than ever before he said it twice recently and not a single hand
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:21.320]  went up you see this row of dummies sitting there looking uncomfortable as
[1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:25.480]  they had to admit by they're not raising their hands that Obama had got it
[1:26:25.480 --> 1:26:29.360]  wrong in fact just in I've just picked it up off the satellite during the break
[1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:35.800]  breaking news we now have had no global warming according to the remote sensing
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:39.800]  systems satellites which monitor global warming around the world we haven't had
[1:26:39.800 --> 1:26:46.640]  any global warming at all for 17 years and 10 months and the significance of
[1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:53.040]  that figure is that it's over half the entire satellite measurement of global
[1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:58.120]  temperatures that started in 1979 for over half of that period the last half
[1:26:58.120 --> 1:27:03.320]  there has been no global warming at all so if anybody ever tells you oh but look
[1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:06.440]  at all these extreme weather events we've got a hurricane on the 4th of July
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:09.120]  we've got all these things that have never happened before cross they have
[1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:14.640]  all happened before the one thing we know didn't cause them is global warming
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:20.960]  because there hasn't been any and says really as simple as that wow and we've
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:24.000]  got a long segment coming up you're gonna get into this ridiculous challenge
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:29.200]  another hoax where they say everyone agrees that climate change is real well
[1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:33.400]  of course climate change is always going on doesn't mean you pay the UN a tax to
[1:27:33.400 --> 1:27:38.720]  stop it well Alex you're too young to remember but climate change has been
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:46.280]  going on for 4.5 thousand million years ever since the world began and the fact
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:49.640]  that they're now saying oh we've discovered it's real everybody's got to
[1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:53.760]  agree with us everybody has always agreed that climate change is real and I
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:58.920]  wrote to this professor the fellow called Keating and I said to him look we all
[1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:04.800]  accept climate change is real we all accept also that humans can have some
[1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:09.800]  effect on the climate the question is did they have a lot of effect or a
[1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:14.880]  dangerous effect that's what the debates about but he he won't frame the question
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:22.120]  in a way that is fair or sensible and also he insisted on not allowing an
[1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:27.280]  independent third party to judge the company because he's got because he
[1:28:27.280 --> 1:28:31.560]  wants to judge it himself he's not going to give the money to anyone it doesn't
[1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:35.360]  matter what evidence you produce he's just going to say you're a skeptic I
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:38.320]  don't believe in your evidence therefore I'm not giving you the price he's done
[1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:42.720]  it to several people already so of course it's not a real challenge it's a
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:46.800]  bogus challenge it's one that the left can then report on all their websites the
[1:28:46.800 --> 1:28:52.840]  daily cast and the Huffington Puffington all these places are talking about it
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:57.240]  but the fact is that it's just another stunt you mentioned that word in an
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:29:01.240]  earlier segment and Alex and you're quite right what goes on is that the
[1:29:01.240 --> 1:29:05.360]  left increasingly governed by stunt because they can't govern on the basis
[1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:10.800]  of the fact and the facts are certainly on the global warming thing now that it
[1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:16.200]  hasn't been warming for something like nearly 18 years according to the the
[1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:21.200]  satellites probably more like 14 years according to the terrestrial measurements
[1:29:21.200 --> 1:29:25.840]  which of course are badly influenced by urban heat island effects with people
[1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:30.440]  turning on their electricity that heats up the area around cities and give you
[1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:33.960]  an artificial and by the kleptocrats putting the measurements out on black
[1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:37.760]  tarmacs to manipulate data all this sort of dodgy stand there we'll be right
[1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:42.260]  back Lord Moncton a science and public policy dot org our sites are info wars

[1:34:01.880 --> 1:34:08.880]  continue getting into the specifics of this professor think climate change isn't
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:13.880]  man-made then prove it professor offers $30,000 reward for anyone who can
[1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:18.160]  disprove his theory Texas based professor has issued a challenge I want to send my
[1:34:18.160 --> 1:34:24.280]  reporters down there to climate change deniers see Holocaust deniers Dr. Keating
[1:34:24.280 --> 1:34:30.920]  is offering 17,500 pounds or roughly $30,000 to anyone that can disprove the
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:35.000]  theory that human activity is warming the planet he is so sure of his claim that
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.480]  he is not expected to pay out anytime soon anyone can enter the competition and
[1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:44.080]  the work doesn't need to be original Dr. Keating says he will be the final judge
[1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:49.360]  on winning or losing the entries that's the daily mail you know what a sick
[1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:58.440]  joke for this quote Texas Texas professor that'd be like if I said yeah
[1:34:58.440 --> 1:35:03.880]  you can enter a contest to prove that this guy you know isn't a knuckle dragging
[1:35:03.880 --> 1:35:12.960]  fraud but there isn't an impartial group of judges here no I will judge because I
[1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:17.480]  know you're full of baloney I mean it no one would buy tickets to that no one
[1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:22.480]  would say that wasn't rigged it's like Al Gore famously I have this in the film
[1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:26.560]  in-game going no one doubts not one scientist on earth the man-made little
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:30.800]  warming is real it's gonna flood everybody by 2013 and that the Arctic
[1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:35.000]  will be completely melted of course it didn't happen it got bigger than ever and
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:40.160]  then one congressman goes excuse me I'm gonna play that clip again I forget
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:44.840]  which Congress goes excuse me it isn't all the scientists there's thousands and
[1:35:44.840 --> 1:35:48.320]  a bunch of people in the UPC report that they say they never were actually in
[1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:52.760]  that report well Congress when there are people who believe we didn't go to the
[1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:58.720]  moon to I'm not talking about I'm a credible scientist and the Congress
[1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:03.840]  was like listen there are a bunch of people who weren't in that report who
[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:09.160]  say their names were put on uh-huh aliens are gonna get me like when Jesse
[1:36:09.160 --> 1:36:11.960]  Ventura the former governor goes and talks to congressman goes I have your
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:15.760]  bill here for civil unrest and FEMA camps for Americans he goes no there's no
[1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:19.480]  bill I don't believe space aliens are gonna come out of machines and eat me
[1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:25.000]  that's their response and again that the Republicans have been horrible but
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.400]  now the Democrats are going for broke for a total takeover so Lord Monkton I
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:32.200]  want to get into this professor people should go visiting where he's a
[1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:36.800]  professor I'll tell folks where he's a professor in a moment but I mean these
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:41.720]  stunts have got to be called I mean the media is reporting on him like well see
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:45.320]  he disproved it you know he's the judge and he's the winner don't people see
[1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:52.480]  through this as a joke because nearly all the media are on the far left nowadays
[1:36:52.480 --> 1:36:56.600]  you know you're an honorable exception you're so far on the far right you
[1:36:56.600 --> 1:37:01.560]  almost fallen off the edge but I mean you know all the far left media they
[1:37:01.560 --> 1:37:09.960]  are doing their best to give the the the the new world order every favor they
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:15.120]  can and when I say new world order I'm not just using a vague right-wing reds
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:21.840]  under the bed phrase at Paris next year next December they're going to make the
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:28.560]  next really big attempt to introduce a world government treaty now in Copenhagen
[1:37:28.560 --> 1:37:32.880]  a few years ago 2009 they made the mistake of publishing it first on the
[1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:36.840]  web where a colleague of mine found it Dr. Willie soon at the Harvard
[1:37:36.840 --> 1:37:41.320]  Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics he sent it to me I publicize it first all
[1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:45.040]  over Canada then all over the United States the video which I mentioned it
[1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:48.960]  went viral two million people had seen it in a week and it was huge still the
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:53.520]  fastest YouTube platinum for any political speech and then what happened
[1:37:53.520 --> 1:38:00.960]  was they paid for a dozen bogus pages on the web which contained somewhere
[1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:05.760]  within them the words monkton video they paid each of the search engines to put
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:09.040]  these bogus pages of complete gibberish that nobody would have wanted to read it
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:13.440]  was just strings of letters and numbers over and above the video that it had two
[1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:16.960]  million hits that cost them according to an expert who got in touch with me
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:20.720]  about it not less than a quarter of a million dollars just to silence one
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:25.640]  person making one speech about their planned proposal to take over the world
[1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:29.960]  using the climate treaties and excuse what then happened Alex is really
[1:38:29.960 --> 1:38:35.920]  fascinating in Melbourne Australia a left-wing radio station decided that I
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:41.360]  was just a right-wing cook they sent a copy of the draft Treaty of Copenhagen
[1:38:41.360 --> 1:38:46.520]  to a Queen's Council a senior attorney and they said to him please will you
[1:38:46.520 --> 1:38:52.280]  read this for us and will you tell us whether or not Lord Moncton is right to
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:57.160]  say that they're trying to set up a world government that isn't elected and
[1:38:57.160 --> 1:39:01.000]  it's going to be a real world government and do they use the word government in
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:05.080]  the treaty and so you know they were sneering they thought it wouldn't turn
[1:39:05.080 --> 1:39:09.160]  out to be real the Queen's Council the senior attorney came back to them he
[1:39:09.160 --> 1:39:15.760]  said look he said Moncton has got it wrong it is ten times worse than anything
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:21.440]  he said this is a bid to take over the world and to stamp out democracy
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:27.600]  everywhere and to have a single central global government using the environment
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:33.080]  and the climate simply as a fig leaf behind which this new tyranny by Clark
[1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:37.200]  will be extended worldwide the EU has already done it in Europe now they're
[1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:42.080]  going to make it go worldwide there are EU advisors telling the UN how to grab
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:48.760]  power by making sure that each new treaty by which power is handed over by
[1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:53.040]  usually left-wing governments to international bodies that nobody
[1:39:53.040 --> 1:39:57.440]  elects is kept secret from the people until after it has been signed and
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:02.560]  that's the technique that the European Union has used I once spent years trying
[1:40:02.560 --> 1:40:05.440]  to get hold of a copy of what eventually became the Treaty of Maastricht I
[1:40:05.440 --> 1:40:10.160]  eventually got the first copy in the country and began writing about it and
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:16.200]  the Foreign Office denied that any such document existed and so I produced
[1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:19.520]  photocopies of it I put it up on the newspaper I was writing for the evening
[1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:23.880]  standard they still went on pretending it existed and two years later they signed
[1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:28.480]  it incredible Lord Moncton let's go to the model of Australia and talk about
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:32.760]  UKIP sum because you know taking taking not just the United States but the
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:40.040]  world back Australia back if I remember correctly they then demonized you you
[1:40:40.040 --> 1:40:45.640]  in an attack piece backfiring in TV and print articles all over Australia that
[1:40:45.640 --> 1:40:49.520]  then caused you to be a cause to live you traveled Australia repeatedly turned
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:53.000]  the country speaking to packed halls of the tens of thousands debated people on
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:56.240]  television and now they're set and say they have the votes will put it on
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:41:01.160]  screen next week to repeal the carbon tax that's been devastating Australian
[1:41:01.160 --> 1:41:06.000]  farmers factories you name it national affairs the Australian newspaper
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:10.720]  carbon tax set for repeal next week you helped get the secret Copenhagen treaty
[1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:15.240]  they got the third world to pull out not vote for passage in the UN all because
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:19.400]  you took action they blocked you from the UN meeting in Durban South Africa you
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:24.800]  literally parachuted into the meeting which was a stunt fighting stunts with
[1:41:24.800 --> 1:41:31.720]  stunts and again it's just an example of taking action perseverance what it can
[1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:36.000]  do we're gaining ground against them do you disagree with that statement and
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.240]  elaborate on what happened in Australia because if they repeal it this is a
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:44.560]  stunning victory because I briefed Tony Abbott who's now the Prime Minister oh
[1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:49.320]  three or four years ago at his request I was in Canberra I got a message from his
[1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:53.200]  office saying please call in whenever you can and so I went there and had half an
[1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:56.680]  hour with him and we talked through this climate thing and he said look I've got
[1:41:56.680 --> 1:42:01.700]  to be very careful because there are those in my party who think this
[1:42:01.700 --> 1:42:05.880]  is a problem he said I don't really think it is but I have to be very careful
[1:42:05.880 --> 1:42:11.000]  how I play it but he said it's quite clear that even if it were a problem
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:15.520]  having carbon taxes is not the solution to the problem and that's the rather
[1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:19.520]  crafty way in which he's managed to persuade his own party that they should
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:23.880]  stand with him and oppose the carbon tax because it even if there were a problem
[1:42:23.880 --> 1:42:29.240]  the carbon tax is not a good solution to it and so he's a very very good man he's
[1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:33.280]  he does a lot of privately a lot of good works quietly which he doesn't
[1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:39.320]  publicize a very very unusual politician and I'm hoping he'll be the Prime
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:43.760]  Minister there for a very long time to left of course absolutely low and because
[1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:47.560]  he has said that the climate thing is all nonsense that he and Stephen Harper in
[1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:51.800]  Canada are the two who have stood out against this nonsense and as it happens
[1:42:51.800 --> 1:42:56.040]  I've briefed both of them on this all it needs is for the with these leaders to
[1:42:56.040 --> 1:43:01.560]  meet Moncton and they change their view on the climate at it it's simply amazing
[1:43:01.560 --> 1:43:05.520]  I want to shift gears back to this professor because the media is
[1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:09.520]  besmirching my great state by saying he's a Texas professor he's actually from
[1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:13.520]  the Naval War College sneaking around here and that's another issue that they've
[1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:18.680]  had the Navy the Marines the Army putting out climate hysteria they've had
[1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:23.320]  NASA scientists putting out stuff you know to fear monger and then using the
[1:43:23.320 --> 1:43:29.440]  name I mean this is outrageous it is I think that this this professor with his
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:33.760]  silly scare I wrote to him on his website and I said look are you prepared
[1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:39.880]  to have an independent third-party judge preferably a real judge who's used to
[1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:46.040]  assessing evidence fairly on both sides of the case and oh no he was not he ran
[1:43:46.040 --> 1:43:51.680]  a mile from that this man is frightened he knows perfectly well that if there
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:56.560]  were any independent trial of this matter he knows perfectly well who would
[1:43:56.560 --> 1:44:01.040]  win in fact I'm now working with TV producers in Canada and we are going to
[1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:06.360]  put global warming on trial and we're going to have a real judge probably a
[1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:10.800]  retired one but a real one in a real courtroom we're going to have I'm going
[1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:14.560]  to be the prosecutor of global warming and they've said their difficulties in
[1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:18.320]  finding anybody who will now defend it so I've given them a few names that I
[1:44:18.320 --> 1:44:21.600]  think might be prepared to defend it we're each going to be allowed to choose
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:26.400]  our own witnesses there will be a fairly chosen jury and what we're going to do
[1:44:26.400 --> 1:44:30.320]  is we're going to put this in a theater and the idea is that then in this
[1:44:30.320 --> 1:44:35.760]  theater every night there will be a two-hour courtroom drama effectively great
[1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:40.880]  idea and the case will be argued before a jury chosen from that night's audience
[1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:45.040]  they get their money back if they agreed to come on to the jury and the jury will
[1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:49.640]  then have here the evidence and they'll have to be honest and try to decide it
[1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:53.320]  well that's bold to do it in Canada because they've really bought a lot of
[1:44:53.320 --> 1:44:56.640]  the brainwashing up there but what is interesting is that the ordinary people
[1:44:56.640 --> 1:45:00.080]  haven't it's as as always it's the chattering classes that have bought into
[1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:03.120]  this because they're making money out of it and I know this is what it's really
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:07.680]  all about Obama supports that this whole nonsense because it means he can shut
[1:45:07.680 --> 1:45:12.040]  down his biggest his opponents biggest funders that's what it that's what he's
[1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:16.360]  doing it for China is now just beginning to change its tune on this it was
[1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:20.640]  previously completely against it because it wants to compete with them the
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:24.200]  West for natural resources it doesn't need to sell its products to us it needs
[1:45:24.200 --> 1:45:27.840]  to be able to have a natural resources to make them that's its biggest need where
[1:45:27.840 --> 1:45:31.240]  it's biggest competitors to get the supplies to keep their industries going
[1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:35.800]  if they can shut the West down that suits them fine so now they're back in
[1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:39.560]  climate change Putin is back in climate change again for purely financial
[1:45:39.560 --> 1:45:44.240]  reasons he wants to sell lots of overpriced Siberian methane gas to heat
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:47.560]  the towns and cities of Western Europe through the pipeline that runs through
[1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:52.200]  the foreigners are siding with Obama to literally shut off half our energy source
[1:45:52.200 --> 1:45:57.480]  is that not treason I mean in World War two our fighter bombers blew up German
[1:45:57.480 --> 1:46:02.240]  power plants and facilities I mean Obama is in your government shutting down
[1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:07.960]  power plants is is is doing what what what what bombers couldn't do to us well
[1:46:07.960 --> 1:46:11.080]  this is exactly what's happening but across he did say he was going to do it
[1:46:11.080 --> 1:46:15.280]  he was very open about it and the left often are they are they will often say
[1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:18.800]  yes we're going to have a war on coal this is a dirty industry we're going to
[1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:23.040]  shut it down what was interesting was that 40 years ago in Britain when I
[1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:27.200]  worked for Margaret Thatcher at that time the coal industry was the great
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:32.080]  great industry of the future the miners were the heroes of labor I mean they
[1:46:32.080 --> 1:46:35.800]  still are for me going down a deep line in Britain was a very dangerous and
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:40.360]  dirty job I was a huge admirer of the miners but the left put them right up
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:44.080]  on a pedestal when the miners went on strike against the Thatcher government
[1:46:44.080 --> 1:46:48.240]  there wasn't a word from the left about how coal is a dirty fuel no but they
[1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:52.480]  changed their tune when they realized that the coal industry stick in place
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:55.680]  like the United States were the ones that were backrolling their political
[1:46:55.680 --> 1:46:59.320]  opponents in the Republican Party so what do we do we find an excuse a
[1:46:59.320 --> 1:47:04.480]  totalitarian excuse to have a war on coal and shut down the coal industry now
[1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:09.080]  modern coal-fired power plants you burn the coal at very very high
[1:47:09.080 --> 1:47:12.640]  temperatures so you get very very little pollution you trap the ash on the way
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:17.800]  out and you don't get much pollution it's actually as clean as burning gas the
[1:47:17.800 --> 1:47:22.840]  only thing it gives off is about twice as much CO2 as gas but CO2 is a harmless
[1:47:22.840 --> 1:47:27.160]  trace gas it is the stuff of life so what this is about and this is why
[1:47:27.160 --> 1:47:32.280]  Paris is such a worrying thing is that they are planning now to have this
[1:47:32.280 --> 1:47:36.440]  world government treaty put in place in Paris and this time they won't let the
[1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:39.600]  the likes of me see the draft of that treaty in advance and I can tell you how
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:44.400]  I know that because in 2012 I went to the Doha conference where they finally
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:48.600]  banned me for life for telling them there'd been no global warming at that
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:52.720]  stage for 16 years now it's going on for 18 years and they banned me for life
[1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:58.240]  they didn't want that said and when I was there I was trying to get a copy of
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:02.680]  what I call the draft conclusions from the chair and this is essentially what
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:07.280]  are the main points this conference was going to decide and at all previous
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:09.880]  conferences have been publicly available you go and ask it from the
[1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:13.280]  document center or press office they had plenty of copies you would just ask for
[1:48:13.280 --> 1:48:18.800]  one I asked for it and they pretended no such thing existed or had ever existed
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:24.240]  they're driving it all underground all these documents all these negotiations
[1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:28.160]  that were once open and public they're now secret all the documents to do with
[1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:33.040]  those negotiations once public just my secret and you know why because at the
[1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:36.440]  Durban conference the one I had to parachute in from 10,000 feet I'd never
[1:48:36.440 --> 1:48:42.080]  skydived in my life before I thought well all I can do is hit the ground and the
[1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:45.200]  real danger is missing but you know because I got Irish ancestry but I was
[1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:49.200]  alright I hit the ground alright and what was there at that Durban conference
[1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:53.960]  when I got the copy of the draft conclusions from the chair it was just
[1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:59.280]  bonkers they were advocating reducing the carbon dioxide concentration of the
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:05.360]  atmosphere from 400 parts per million to 200 now at 200 parts per million most
[1:49:05.360 --> 1:49:10.800]  plants and trees on earth would either die or struggle to survive crop yields
[1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:15.320]  would fall by up to 50% and they were advocating this as a necessary measure
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:19.160]  wouldn't that kill a billion people it's estimated a decade it would get it
[1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:22.760]  would have killed probably five billion of the six billion people then on earth
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:25.800]  it's seven billion now it would have killed something like five or six billion
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:29.720]  it was it was an extraordinary policy they wanted to set up an
[1:49:29.720 --> 1:49:34.360]  international climate court which was going to try western countries and so
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:38.240]  was the old plan that would kill a billion they had one even worse and all
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:43.520]  of this was in this treaty draft 2,000 journalists were there not one
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:48.760]  newspaper or news medium around the world reported what was in well how are
[1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:53.840]  we gonna get the intel out of Paris then we're gonna have to have moles I can't
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:57.720]  get in of course they banned me for life but I have got people who are going to
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:00.680]  get in there whether they like it or not and they'll be feeding stuff out to me
[1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:04.680]  the trouble is that even inside the conference they will be doing their best
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:08.400]  to keep these documents secret until they've got them signed and agreed to by
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:13.520]  the well criminals always try to operate in secret in closing tell us about the
[1:50:13.520 --> 1:50:17.600]  Las Vegas summit coming up and this is very important in next week from the
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:23.480]  7th to the 9th of July at the Mandalay Bay Hotel Resort and Casino the biggest

[1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:54.480]  much to worry about as those profiteers of doom have been trying all right great

[1:55:54.960 --> 1:55:58.840]  Kentucky you're on the air go ahead thank you sir thank you for taking my
[1:55:58.840 --> 1:56:02.640]  call I have a lot of respect for what you're doing there brother we're all in
[1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:07.560]  it together I respect you as well what's on your mind well I've I've noticed the
[1:56:07.560 --> 1:56:11.240]  news really speedballing lately economic experts are calling for something
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:16.640]  worse than 2008 in our near future the gates to the states are hanging wide
[1:56:16.640 --> 1:56:21.040]  open in the south a good friend of mine sells the chemicals they're putting in
[1:56:21.040 --> 1:56:25.560]  my local water supply so I know those are there and here lately in Kentucky over
[1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:28.760]  the last few months I'm noticing the skies are looking a lot different than
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:32.280]  what they used to and in fact yesterday a plane went overhead of me and dropped a
[1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:36.480]  plume like I've never seen before I'm wondering at this point if it's not too
[1:56:36.480 --> 1:56:40.920]  far late too far gone why folks by the millions aren't standing out in front of
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:44.800]  capital building state and federal over the nation demanding answers and what
[1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:49.080]  we can do at this point it's just totally overwhelming that the energy
[1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:53.440]  department admits in their high altitude aerosol campaign they don't call it
[1:56:53.440 --> 1:56:56.800]  chemtrails there's no documents on chemtrails there's tens of thousands on
[1:56:56.800 --> 1:57:01.240]  weather modification Bill Gates is over it he may he gets paid by the government
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:05.040]  to run the operations he makes billions his company does tax-free they're
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:08.680]  involved in weather modification manipulation they've been caught
[1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:12.640]  spraying biologicals on people and they admit all this it's even in the news
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:17.240]  but it's like oh there's secret tasks never mind and as he mentioned that it
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:21.800]  sounds crazy because it is crazy we're in 2014 it's like a science fiction movie
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:28.960]  and now all these yeah stratospheric sulfate aerosols geoengineering there's
[1:57:28.960 --> 1:57:33.360]  a headline right there from Wikipedia so all of this is going on we know what's
[1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:36.720]  going on we just don't know exactly the full extent it's like you know your
[1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:38.880]  neighbors killing people and burying them you just don't know how many are
[1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:44.280]  buried I mean it's it's bad it's always always worse than I thought because it's
[1:57:44.280 --> 1:57:50.040]  compartmentalization so people have just been raised in a trench and they're
[1:57:50.040 --> 1:57:53.120]  starting to break out of it that's why the armored vehicles are coming out it's
[1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:57.960]  why the gloves are coming off the velvet you know gloves coming off the iron
[1:57:57.960 --> 1:58:04.600]  fist so I'm in the same boat as you I mean it's just crazy town that the
[1:58:04.600 --> 1:58:09.560]  government has opened the borders and is flooding us but then you go to the
[1:58:09.560 --> 1:58:12.320]  airport they want to stick their hands down your pants and the NSA spies on
[1:58:12.320 --> 1:58:19.200]  you now there's ABC News Bill Gates the hurricane tamer he's saving us so there
[1:58:19.200 --> 1:58:25.440]  you go and the reason I went off on the climate manipulation is I say it's
[1:58:25.440 --> 1:58:30.120]  admitted the new listeners think I'm nuts I mean literally there are hundreds
[1:58:30.120 --> 1:58:36.960]  of patents from the 50s and 60s on total weather control and it's all going on
[1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:44.360]  now we'll be right back I'm gonna go right to your calls Nathan then we're
[1:58:44.360 --> 1:58:51.320]  gonna go to Derek Gray and a bunch of others from the water table to our soils

[2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:54.560]  rights and you know what rights people have as American citizens and I was
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:01:57.600]  just looking for your professional opinion well I think you should take

[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:29.600]  4th of July don't wake people up I think if you've been fighting tyranny you
[2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:34.320]  should relax never good time on the 4th of July but if you haven't been I mean I
[2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:37.720]  would go out where they're gonna have army and National Guard and people at
[2:02:37.720 --> 2:02:43.800]  fireworks displays it'll be open green fields like Austin and a quote terrorist
[2:02:43.800 --> 2:02:47.040]  ISIS funded by the government can come through at any point and blow people up
[2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:50.720]  but they'll have a checkpoint just to train you and and have an act of
[2:02:50.720 --> 2:02:54.480]  domination where you walk through and they search you and so you should just
[2:02:54.480 --> 2:02:57.160]  go up and say you know there was a real terrorist like ISIS our government runs
[2:02:57.160 --> 2:03:00.760]  they would just blow up this line the biggest concentration of people look
[2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:05.080]  this whole field's wide open why is the army on here don't oh sir just trying to
[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:09.120]  keep you safe well listen National Guardsman I'm not against you personally
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:12.840]  but we should have a whole discussion about come on sir just let us go to the
[2:03:12.840 --> 2:03:17.480]  line no this is July 4th no other country does this this is a police state
[2:03:17.480 --> 2:03:22.120]  our government funds ISIS and that's the kind of stuff I do I'd go up to these
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:26.040]  parks and stuff you know like the last 4th of July that have signed saying you
[2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:29.600]  know you know no free speech no demonstration what was that sign you
[2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:34.520]  stay about you know no dogs no drinking no loud talking in the park I mean this
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:38.000]  is literally a criminal government trying to train us to be good slaves and
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:45.080]  trying to breed out of this basic human freedom and and and and they want you to
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:50.120]  act like a prisoner in a medium security prison and so there it is first
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:53.800]  amendment expression area this has been set aside for individual groups exercise
[2:03:53.800 --> 2:03:58.640]  the constitutional rights again exercise it everywhere yeah that's the not the
[2:03:58.640 --> 2:04:03.040]  sign there was a 4th of July sign that said you had no rights so folks stuck
[2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:07.320]  another one up on it saying yes you do so I don't know I mean I would go out and

[2:04:11.480 --> 2:04:15.840]  nation which I always said it's the immigrant importation agency you know

[2:09:33.240 --> 2:09:38.160]  have a government policy of destabilization BBC reporter says Google

[2:09:58.800 --> 2:10:02.040]  the current level of tyranny I don't believe that new poll neither does that
[2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:08.080]  writer and then it gets into the fact that only 7% approve of Congress the
[2:10:08.080 --> 2:10:13.320]  Brax are morphing into an anti-dollar alliance Americans sense of freedom
[2:10:13.320 --> 2:10:18.000]  plummets by another 12% since a poll last year that's just some of the news up on
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:27.240]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com now we are joined here until close to the end
[2:10:27.240 --> 2:10:32.200]  of the hour then I'll go back to the collars that are holding we are joined by
[2:10:32.200 --> 2:10:37.160]  professor Daryl Hamamoto and he's a teacher and is taught at the University
[2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:41.360]  of California Davis for most of his academic career he holds an
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:45.360]  undergraduate and graduate degrees in political science popular culture
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:49.640]  studies and comparative culture Hamamoto is a senior ranking professor in the
[2:10:49.640 --> 2:10:54.240]  Department of Asian American Studies he is a recognized authority in US media
[2:10:54.240 --> 2:10:58.440]  I've seen on TV a lot of times popular culture and sexuality having published
[2:10:58.440 --> 2:11:02.640]  extensively in these areas Hamamoto is a recipient of the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:07.760]  research fellowship UCLA so he's a prestigious scholar and a Fulbright
[2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:12.760]  scholar Japan his current project is a volume and outlines the principles of
[2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:17.120]  New World order theory and is directed to the current generation college and
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:21.560]  university undergraduates in search of alternatives to the dominant foundation
[2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:26.960]  guided corporatist curriculum so that's pretty revolutionary if you know what
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:32.640]  that means because we live under a foundation corporatist roadmap of the
[2:11:32.640 --> 2:11:36.440]  mind system so he's a very interesting a fellow that I was familiar with his
[2:11:36.440 --> 2:11:41.000]  work before we got in contact with him about some of his current papers that I
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:46.200]  know he's getting heat from at UC Davis dealing with all this where he's
[2:11:46.200 --> 2:11:51.520]  currently resides and the headline from last week that Paul Watson wrote a
[2:11:51.520 --> 2:11:57.000]  story about UC professor immigration influx is about reeducation of society
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:02.840]  Hamamoto warns amnesty will lead to creation of subservient underclass
[2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:07.840]  which is just what Lord Moncton just said because that's what it is but but
[2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:14.960]  he's a real technical expert not just a layman with my own street you know jive
[2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:20.440]  you could say definitions he can give you the technical definitions you know via
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:25.120]  the Ford Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation and he joins us right now
[2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:30.640]  from California thank you so much for coming on professor thank you Alex and
[2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:35.080]  welcome back from your vacation thank you sir well wow I mean in layman's
[2:12:35.080 --> 2:12:41.400]  terms where does this all begin well it begins in junior high school when I was
[2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:49.600]  a voted class clown and I discovered that in my academic career I discovered
[2:12:49.600 --> 2:12:54.000]  early on that I could either write an obscure article and publish it in an
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:59.080]  even more obscure academic journal that nobody reads and the real important
[2:12:59.080 --> 2:13:04.400]  issues of our day will just go unnoticed and I discovered that if I do a
[2:13:04.400 --> 2:13:10.160]  little bit of J. Perry and parody that I'm getting far more attention with the
[2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:15.480]  serious issues and that's been my modus operandi ever since in the classroom
[2:13:15.480 --> 2:13:23.480]  and there's some of it in my scholarship as well get into what you mean by this
[2:13:23.480 --> 2:13:30.560]  foundation driven cultural map let me give the exact quote here in search of
[2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:35.840]  alternatives to the dominant Foundation guided corporatist curriculum because
[2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:40.160]  I mean that's clearly what it is a fake left a fake right and then you also talk
[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:44.120]  about some of the new subcults that they're setting up kind of race cults
[2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:49.560]  pretty frightening stuff by the establishment break it down for us yes
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:52.640]  there's the race and ethnicity cults but importantly I don't know if we're
[2:13:52.640 --> 2:13:57.360]  going to be able to get into this there's also the GLBT agenda which has
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:03.200]  absolutely nothing to do with GBL or T people it's just a pretext in
[2:14:03.200 --> 2:14:09.320]  order to ride herd so to speak on the rest of the academic community but
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:13.640]  going to your question this really started to kick in right after World
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:21.320]  War two when the social scientists the behavioral scientists had compiled all
[2:14:21.320 --> 2:14:25.680]  this information they had gathered during World War two and by the way a lot of
[2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:29.200]  it was done on the backs of Asian Americans like Japanese Americans and
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:35.600]  the concentration camps were studied by a large number of mostly anthropologists
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:41.520]  and social scientists anyway all that information was compiled and passed on to
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:48.960]  the foundations and used as tools for a social control political manipulation
[2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:55.200]  mind control unit but the full spectrum as you refer to it of domination so what
[2:14:55.200 --> 2:15:01.760]  we're coming back with in response is full spectrum opposition Wow very well
[2:15:01.760 --> 2:15:06.400]  said in fact I want to get you back on on the whole you'll fake gay agenda versus
[2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:11.880]  you know real freedom out there and then also I know you're an expert separately
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:15.360]  and a lot of times are on national news and quoted in newspapers about what
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:18.640]  happened to Japanese Americans and others people forget about that that even
[2:15:18.640 --> 2:15:22.480]  in the rand corporation documents and others that I've seen they admit that
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:26.920]  the years of captivity and slave labor of the super hard-working smart Japanese
[2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:31.240]  Americans many of them fourth-fifth generation who were scooped up in
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:37.480]  slave while their sons fought in Europe us valiantly what has now become the
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:41.840]  model of how to round people up in fact how they're gonna use city buses to
[2:15:41.840 --> 2:15:45.280]  come pick up the political dissidents this time how they're gonna control the
[2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:49.760]  cities the Japanese and this country were the model of that yes we were the
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:54.800]  beta test and this there's a direct historical connection between what you
[2:15:54.800 --> 2:15:59.200]  just described and the FEMA network today it's not metaphorical it's
[2:15:59.200 --> 2:16:03.400]  literal it's political at the funding sources the administrative level it's
[2:16:03.400 --> 2:16:08.120]  it's very much consistent and the bad news that it's far far more extensive
[2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:12.600]  than it was during World War two and this time around it's aimed directly at
[2:16:12.600 --> 2:16:17.160]  all Americans regardless of your race ethnicity gender and even social class
[2:16:17.160 --> 2:16:22.440]  and that'll include even a lot of these professors who are smirking about some
[2:16:22.440 --> 2:16:26.200]  of these issues now maybe it'll take a few more to beat down on the street
[2:16:26.200 --> 2:16:30.760]  before they come to their senses that's right a lot of professors now are
[2:16:30.760 --> 2:16:34.520]  getting beat up for no reason on the street by the police it's really good
[2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:39.200]  it's a crazed system we're entering where do you want to begin because you're
[2:16:39.200 --> 2:16:43.600]  very eloquent and again understand the scientific technicals of this you're
[2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:49.560]  pretty much trained in this system well let's start on a positive note then
[2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:54.920]  degenerate from there just recently a team of researchers at the University of
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:17:00.080]  California Davis came out with a very important report in the an academic
[2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:04.960]  journal environmental health perspective it's available online and PDF form and
[2:17:04.960 --> 2:17:12.920]  it talks about the hazards of pesticides especially the hazards to pregnant
[2:17:12.920 --> 2:17:18.760]  women and young children autism exactly exactly you speak of this all the time
[2:17:18.760 --> 2:17:22.480]  and many refined guests speak to this issue as well so the University of
[2:17:22.480 --> 2:17:28.240]  California Davis does do some incredible research that's one part of it but in
[2:17:28.240 --> 2:17:33.720]  more recent times they've gone over into the dark side and it does did not bode
[2:17:33.720 --> 2:17:38.680]  well for us when big sister Janet de Palatano showed up as the president of
[2:17:38.680 --> 2:17:43.720]  the UC system directly after her her reign at the Department of Homeland
[2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:50.080]  Security this is the revelation of the method so to speak and I've also heard
[2:17:50.080 --> 2:17:54.720]  from colleagues and friends rumors that her real function in the sitting in the
[2:17:54.720 --> 2:18:00.360]  seat of the presidency the University of California is to rule as a governor of
[2:18:00.360 --> 2:18:09.000]  FEMA region number 10 unbelievable unbelievable but true and this is what
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:13.560]  that's bombshell let's stop right there again we have a prestigious top
[2:18:13.560 --> 2:18:17.440]  professor on right now political science you know it's true I mean I'm
[2:18:17.440 --> 2:18:21.640]  mainstream media says you're I mean you are prestigious and prolific saying you
[2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:25.960]  have sources in the University that are saying the word is this is really her
[2:18:25.960 --> 2:18:31.800]  cover to be governor of FEMA region 10 obviously the palm of the West Coast oh
[2:18:31.800 --> 2:18:37.080]  my gosh she is a regional governor oh tell us more about what you were told
[2:18:37.080 --> 2:18:41.520]  she is a pro console absolutely well she has no academic credentials I believe
[2:18:41.520 --> 2:18:45.800]  she has a law degree from the University of Virginia which is one of the better
[2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:51.800]  law schools but she has no administrative or academic credentials that
[2:18:51.800 --> 2:18:59.000]  that I'm aware of so what else can we infer that she is here for for
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:04.600]  nefarious purposes this part is speculative I'll preface whatever I'm
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:11.080]  saying that's a little bit with this caveat but the University of California has
[2:19:11.080 --> 2:19:16.760]  a pension fund that's worth about 41 to 45 billion dollars that's just the UC
[2:19:16.760 --> 2:19:21.520]  system and public institutions across the country I'm sure it's it's much much
[2:19:21.520 --> 2:19:28.040]  more than that anyway you can imagine that there are there are tons of wolves
[2:19:28.040 --> 2:19:33.600]  out there wolves of Wall Street was an awful movie by the way are just looking
[2:19:33.600 --> 2:19:36.560]  at the shots ready to get a hold of it and and they're going to be a lot of
[2:19:36.560 --> 2:19:40.720]  really smart people you know we have MDs we have a medical school we have we have
[2:19:40.720 --> 2:19:46.000]  a law school we have you know the usual run of PhDs and whatnot are going to be
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:52.240]  very very angry and they have resources in order to combat or to fight back the
[2:19:52.240 --> 2:19:56.960]  theft of their pension and you speak to this issue quite often I think this is
[2:19:56.960 --> 2:20:02.400]  this is the next plumb oh yeah they're getting UT ready to take their pensions
[2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:06.200]  as well so all these people that have gone along with this you know they're
[2:20:06.200 --> 2:20:11.480]  going to be the last to get their throat slit that's exactly it said we're
[2:20:11.480 --> 2:20:16.800]  verging on the night of the the long knives by the way the predecessor to
[2:20:16.800 --> 2:20:21.200]  Janet de Palatano is a guy named Mark Udoff just prior to coming to the
[2:20:21.200 --> 2:20:24.120]  University of California as president because what he was president of the
[2:20:24.120 --> 2:20:29.440]  University of Texas oh so they these people rotate in and out and after they've
[2:20:29.440 --> 2:20:33.360]  done their job they kind of slink away and they probably get jobs at the Ford
[2:20:33.360 --> 2:20:38.320]  Foundation again it's the foundations again which are the administrative and
[2:20:38.320 --> 2:20:43.120]  and funding sources for much of the start from the top because you're an
[2:20:43.120 --> 2:20:48.640]  expert in this and one of their scholars and so let's we should get Francis
[2:20:48.640 --> 2:20:52.320]  Boyle back on to he actually went to their secret Henry Kissinger training
[2:20:52.320 --> 2:20:56.160]  level for global governance and then expose them from the inside at Harvard
[2:20:56.160 --> 2:20:59.480]  and then the same thing with some of the other people we've had on from the
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:04.400]  actual meetings where you're actually you know given this intel so right now
[2:21:04.400 --> 2:21:08.280]  maybe from the top of the foundation pyramid for us and then tie it into the
[2:21:08.280 --> 2:21:12.320]  social engineering before I go on Francis Boyle is a really good example
[2:21:12.320 --> 2:21:16.880]  this is directed to my my colleagues in the in the higher education field my
[2:21:16.880 --> 2:21:21.440]  fellow professors Francis Boyle is a great example of someone who was tempted
[2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:25.880]  by the system who was tapped and was slated to become one of these
[2:21:25.880 --> 2:21:31.800]  of functionary these pro-consuls for the foundations but he refused that instead
[2:21:31.800 --> 2:21:37.240]  he decided to pursue the moral and ethical course anyway by the way you're
[2:21:37.240 --> 2:21:41.480]  talking about a imperial legate for those that don't know in history who
[2:21:41.480 --> 2:21:47.840]  literally speak you know as the mouth of the system who are really viceroys or
[2:21:47.840 --> 2:21:51.480]  governors and that's actually what Henry Kissinger and others have called
[2:21:51.480 --> 2:21:55.920]  themselves a bigner Brzezinski and and he was tapped for that and basically turned
[2:21:55.920 --> 2:22:00.560]  it down obviously Janet Napolitano and others didn't and that's how this system
[2:22:00.560 --> 2:22:03.880]  really works and that's why the political class goes along with it because
[2:22:03.880 --> 2:22:07.720]  they want to be governors they want to be sub governors of this new global
[2:22:07.720 --> 2:22:12.960]  system and but but if we expose it it's over for them it is and you know what
[2:22:12.960 --> 2:22:17.040]  this process begins at the undergraduate level it begins they lead institutions of
[2:22:17.040 --> 2:22:21.960]  higher education and what I've been discovering recently this is bombshell
[2:22:21.960 --> 2:22:26.760]  information as well this this is being coordinated by so-called student
[2:22:26.760 --> 2:22:32.200]  services there's been an incredible infusion of funding and hiring of these
[2:22:32.200 --> 2:22:38.760]  these weasels who are catering to students and the guys of student
[2:22:38.760 --> 2:22:43.440]  activism whatever single issue that they are involved with and find out which
[2:22:43.440 --> 2:22:48.320]  among them are the Slesias then they go to these student leadership conferences
[2:22:48.320 --> 2:22:52.800]  and there they learn neuro linguistic programming that Delphi take me and from
[2:22:52.800 --> 2:22:57.160]  there they observe and these people go up rise through the system and
[2:22:57.160 --> 2:23:00.880]  eventually they they might become the president of the University of California
[2:23:00.880 --> 2:23:07.880]  system unbelievable this is why it is so important that those of us who teach
[2:23:07.880 --> 2:23:14.160]  are aware of this new world order curriculum the theory and practice and
[2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:20.160]  this is not being addressed in academia at this point it is my purpose my single
[2:23:20.160 --> 2:23:25.800]  singular purpose professional purpose to bring this into the standard
[2:23:25.800 --> 2:23:31.640]  curriculum so it almost becomes a cliche it's going to be so and I believe this
[2:23:31.640 --> 2:23:36.520]  can happen because this is a really really receptive generation we're
[2:23:36.520 --> 2:23:40.160]  scratching their heads they're learning obsolete forms of knowledge
[2:23:40.160 --> 2:23:44.920]  information so-called theory with a capital T which also came out of the
[2:23:44.920 --> 2:23:51.120]  foundations that came out of the institutions like Yale this is why
[2:23:51.120 --> 2:23:55.920]  people are fleeing from the humanities because there is absolutely no
[2:23:55.920 --> 2:23:59.560]  relevance to their lives they don't even read fiction or literature they read
[2:23:59.560 --> 2:24:06.240]  theory about literature and short stories and poetry well that's right and
[2:24:06.240 --> 2:24:10.680]  by the way oh absolutely I mean the big foundation as you know admit that they
[2:24:10.680 --> 2:24:14.400]  have to take that you're the true critical thinking out the love of history
[2:24:14.400 --> 2:24:20.560]  the love of the humanities and make it synthetic and fake so that basically
[2:24:20.560 --> 2:24:23.760]  those systems die just like they infiltrated the media and the press
[2:24:23.760 --> 2:24:28.760]  bought it off to destroy it to just get rid of it and now literally have robots
[2:24:28.760 --> 2:24:33.680]  that just write press releases that's the program that's the plan give people
[2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:38.800]  obsolete degrees so they can implode the colleges after they've helped sell the
[2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:44.880]  people out and just create corporate technical schools that literally just
[2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:51.080]  create technicians very small groups of managers to then manage the system this
[2:24:51.080 --> 2:24:55.720]  is the destruction of the Renaissance the destruction of the love of art this
[2:24:55.720 --> 2:25:02.240]  is the evisceration of people being complex lovers of knowledge because a
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:06.360]  complex lover of knowledge is going to recognize the tyranny and it's not going
[2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:10.760]  to go along with it that's exactly right this is the specialist that you
[2:25:10.760 --> 2:25:16.440]  refer to it as the technocracy a lot of them at this point are coming from Asia
[2:25:16.440 --> 2:25:21.640]  they have absolutely no knowledge historical awareness of this process
[2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:27.640]  this is part of my job to educate them currently they're bringing in large
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:31.720]  numbers of people from mainland China undergrad at the undergraduate level and
[2:25:31.720 --> 2:25:39.760]  they're paying premium fees I had one student who finished two years at UC
[2:25:39.760 --> 2:25:46.160]  Davis from Vietnam and it's not a wealthy country yet over two years her
[2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:50.040]  family spent two hundred thousand dollars in order to send her to the
[2:25:50.040 --> 2:25:58.360]  University of California wow yeah and at the same time as we've been noting over
[2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:03.880]  the last few days the larger master plan they have a name for it it's called the
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:09.400]  2020 initiative yes this is the DC Davis and the plan there is to bring large
[2:26:09.400 --> 2:26:14.080]  numbers of illegal aliens who are now teenagers but in a few years will be
[2:26:14.080 --> 2:26:20.680]  undergraduates barely veteran unschooled in an American political culture and our
[2:26:20.680 --> 2:26:25.200]  rich heritage of freedom democracy individual liberty and constitutional
[2:26:25.200 --> 2:26:33.960]  guarantees who will be the next generation of CPS workers and emissaries
[2:26:33.960 --> 2:26:39.760]  for the larger welfare state unbelievable and I forget his name we had
[2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:44.200]  him on about two years ago but even liberal real liberal members of the
[2:26:44.200 --> 2:26:49.360]  Labor Party and others have come on the show and admitted no we brought
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:53.440]  immigrants in over the last 20 years from the former Soviet Union and they've
[2:26:53.440 --> 2:26:57.840]  made them the police and the CPS workers and they're now just disappearing kids
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:01.200]  they will do whatever they're told and a lot of them were brought in as
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:05.800]  teenagers and it turns out the model they pulled in England and the UK I'm
[2:27:05.800 --> 2:27:10.320]  getting chills right now literally folks is now the model here this is so
[2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:15.880]  creepy this is the domestic national security force just as big just as
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:19.600]  strong as our military that they're bringing in and again I have nothing
[2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:22.280]  against these young poor kids what are they gonna think being brought in at
[2:27:22.280 --> 2:27:27.480]  15 14 the government gives them everything just like the old Soviet Union
[2:27:27.480 --> 2:27:31.320]  used to take the orphans and make them be the tax police this is literally in
[2:27:31.320 --> 2:27:35.520]  the authoritarian model that comes right out of the old Soviet Union this is or
[2:27:35.520 --> 2:27:40.040]  right out of Nazi Germany Hitler youth I mean this is not a joke it's being
[2:27:40.040 --> 2:27:43.640]  rolled out right as we speak there's another dimension that this is well
[2:27:43.640 --> 2:27:49.240]  with the large numbers of younger undergraduates that are being cultivated
[2:27:49.240 --> 2:27:56.280]  for this larger welfare state system and that is ROTC I have a lot of students
[2:27:56.280 --> 2:28:03.320]  who can't make it financially and through the undergraduate degree program so
[2:28:03.320 --> 2:28:07.800]  they have to sign up for ROTC Reserve Officer Training Corps in order to pay
[2:28:07.800 --> 2:28:14.160]  for the tuition and and the books so as you know ROTC on these public at these
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:21.680]  public institutions are being trained to see the American public the so-called
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:26.440]  civilians as as the enemy as the as the major threat so you have that dimension
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:28.880]  as well
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:34.400]  well you're absolutely right this is a Department of Defense wow absolutely in
[2:28:34.400 --> 2:28:37.920]  fact while you were saying that I was on the button off air saying pull up the
[2:28:37.920 --> 2:28:41.320]  New York Times about the preparations for civil collapse just to back up
[2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:47.360]  everything you're saying please continue certainly yeah and a lot of the young
[2:28:47.360 --> 2:28:52.680]  people are used to the LHIFI system of governance as opposed to the Republican
[2:28:52.680 --> 2:28:58.000]  forms with a small R they're not used to our political culture and they'll you
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:04.680]  know I think do about anything in order to get over in society
[2:29:04.680 --> 2:29:12.800]  however this is not unique to immigrant students as well people of four or five
[2:29:12.800 --> 2:29:17.880]  generations have almost completely lost touch with our political traditions
[2:29:17.880 --> 2:29:23.920]  well I was about to say as bad as some of these dregs that they're bringing in on
[2:29:23.920 --> 2:29:28.480]  purpose so they can be malleable are compared to a lot of slovenly Americans
[2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:32.880]  I don't care what color they are it's just it's already so bad it's it's it's
[2:29:32.880 --> 2:29:38.080]  insane and I want to come back and talk as a political scientist where you think
[2:29:38.080 --> 2:29:42.280]  this is going professor and ways to stop it because they're gonna exploit these
[2:29:42.280 --> 2:29:46.560]  people like nobody else how do you reach out to them how are you being
[2:29:46.560 --> 2:29:51.440]  successful doing that we're on the March and are you being persecuted for it
[2:29:51.440 --> 2:29:57.240]  we're gonna ask him that Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:29:59.240 --> 2:30:03.800]  a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties
[2:30:03.800 --> 2:30:07.280]  this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water
[2:30:07.280 --> 2:30:11.240]  contaminate what are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking
[2:30:11.240 --> 2:30:14.960]  water it's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents my

[2:31:08.080 --> 2:31:12.080]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[2:31:12.080 --> 2:31:16.280]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[2:31:16.280 --> 2:31:20.160]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are

[2:31:31.480 --> 2:31:35.160]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to

[2:33:32.960 --> 2:33:36.920]  radio show versus others we bring in a lot of issues a lot of names a lot of
[2:33:36.920 --> 2:33:41.280]  terms you'll never hear anywhere but you see more of those like
[2:33:41.280 --> 2:33:50.120]  technocracy being brought into the common language as people discover what's
[2:33:50.120 --> 2:33:53.600]  going on and the establishment and so many publications that makes my head
[2:33:53.600 --> 2:33:57.280]  spin we've quoted a lot of them here admits that's their plan to dumb things
[2:33:57.280 --> 2:34:04.160]  down to where the public are like sheep and can't revolt against the practice of
[2:34:04.160 --> 2:34:08.400]  eating mutton to quote Bertrand Russell who is hailed as this incredible
[2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:12.200]  liberal and who they write all these books about who want a Nobel Prize but
[2:34:12.200 --> 2:34:16.160]  then you really read his writings that were technical not not best-selling
[2:34:16.160 --> 2:34:20.720]  books and the guy's an absolute monster who wanted nuclear war to reduce
[2:34:20.720 --> 2:34:26.240]  world population and stuff I mean it's like whoa whoa these people are as bad
[2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:31.240]  as Hitler and it's this elite attitude the public or scum and then a
[2:34:31.240 --> 2:34:36.080]  self-fulfilling prophecy to dumb us down so that they can make us the ignorant
[2:34:36.080 --> 2:34:45.280]  slaves they want we are going to become gods period feel like it get off you
[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:49.480]  don't have to contribute you don't have to participate if you're going to
[2:34:49.480 --> 2:34:57.600]  interfere with me becoming God I have big trouble well that's Richard seed
[2:34:57.600 --> 2:35:01.480]  physicist and you hear similar things out of Ray Kurzweil who I'm not even
[2:35:01.480 --> 2:35:05.080]  demonizing Ray Kurzweil says a lot of stuff I agree with the guys invented a
[2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:11.000]  bunch of stuff he's very smart a billionaire but all new tech on record
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:14.840]  has tracker systems to watch and control everything you do the light bulbs that
[2:35:14.840 --> 2:35:17.920]  have been out for five years are designed so they can send data down
[2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:21.680]  power line to track everything you're doing it's in the New York Times two
[2:35:21.680 --> 2:35:26.440]  years ago but then MSNBC attacks me and says I'm insane because I believe the
[2:35:26.440 --> 2:35:30.560]  dishwasher is watching you no I didn't say that portray us said that in Wired
[2:35:30.560 --> 2:35:35.080]  magazine yes I talked about it a decade before it was in the news because it was
[2:35:35.080 --> 2:35:39.560]  in the MIT quarterly it was in the Stanford Research Institute see that's
[2:35:39.560 --> 2:35:47.720]  what's so frustrating here is that 98% of this is public and then we're here
[2:35:47.720 --> 2:35:50.840]  trying to get people to understand it and they go oh I don't want to hear that
[2:35:50.840 --> 2:35:57.680]  that's scary but the good news is this has progressed so far that people realize
[2:35:57.680 --> 2:36:03.120]  that it's authoritarian and totalitarian and so they're starting to say no to it
[2:36:03.120 --> 2:36:07.200]  they're starting to realize that it's out of control and it's a giant quasi
[2:36:07.200 --> 2:36:12.840]  secretive program with a bunch of control freaks who say we're allowed to do
[2:36:12.840 --> 2:36:16.920]  what we want and build our world you better get out of our way and then it's
[2:36:16.920 --> 2:36:22.240]  a fundamentally anti-human world for a tiny elite I don't know how they think
[2:36:22.240 --> 2:36:25.680]  they're going to ever get all these benefits out of this horrible slave
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:29.040]  system they're building I look at how they try to implode Latin America and
[2:36:29.040 --> 2:36:34.720]  Africa to control them I see all this I want to empower Latin America and then
[2:36:34.720 --> 2:36:38.600]  Nancy Pelosi says you're racist if you don't totally open the border pay for
[2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:42.800]  all these people to come in who will on record become a permanent under
[2:36:42.800 --> 2:36:49.440]  political class and then the even even people with PhDs can't understand this
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:54.720]  when it's so simple how am I going to get somebody I can't even talk to because
[2:36:54.720 --> 2:37:00.080]  I don't speak Spanish well how am I going to wake them up I mean it's game
[2:37:00.080 --> 2:37:03.840]  over folks it's game over and and so I'm trying to shut up because he's being
[2:37:03.840 --> 2:37:07.400]  polite and letting me talk but I'll go on forever Professor Daryl Homamodo from
[2:37:07.400 --> 2:37:13.120]  the University joining us you see Davis.edu you can find his page there I
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:15.760]  mean you've got the floor for the rest of the segment I'm trying to shut up here
[2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:20.480]  go through how they're because there's a layman I see what they do they take
[2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:25.360]  everybody's basic rights black white Asian Hispanic most people kids I see
[2:37:25.360 --> 2:37:29.400]  are quote mix so the future that won't even matter the system injecting race
[2:37:29.400 --> 2:37:34.400]  sex issues region issues anti-male-female issues because they give you the
[2:37:34.400 --> 2:37:38.560]  fake right of not trusting each other and the systems the arbitrator you know
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:43.000]  the arbiter and the the referee and then oh we're gonna you know hype up
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:46.800]  we'll pay for your sex change we're gonna hype up that you can have a Hispanic
[2:37:46.800 --> 2:37:51.880]  America and we'll show the gringo and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and then
[2:37:51.880 --> 2:37:57.080]  the Ford Foundation's funding it and liberation theology and then how do you
[2:37:57.080 --> 2:38:00.880]  communicate to people about that how do you show them that it's
[2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:05.360]  Balkanization break it down for folks out there from your research and being an
[2:38:05.360 --> 2:38:10.080]  insider what's currently happening what's going on in the model area
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:15.280]  California for this system well what's happened is that what originally
[2:38:15.280 --> 2:38:20.600]  started as a very useful and valuable critique a way of understanding US
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:26.440]  national history from the perspective of immigration race ethnicity gender has
[2:38:26.440 --> 2:38:31.560]  become hijacked courtesy of the foundations against that start to
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:37.360]  subsidize it and weaponize these forms of information so now what was once a
[2:38:37.360 --> 2:38:43.360]  laboratory sources of knowledge have become oppressive and this is what your
[2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:49.080]  younger generation of potentially educated middle-class people are being
[2:38:49.080 --> 2:38:53.440]  subjected to so I want to shatter that paradigm I want to introduce other
[2:38:53.440 --> 2:38:58.120]  perspectives I call it the same convenience new world order theory
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:02.760]  that's my objective and I've been already introducing this into the
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:07.000]  classroom and this is where I've been running a file of the administration and
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:12.880]  my department and specific because they're locked into a 30 or 40 year old
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:19.360]  model based on race ethnicity and gender it no longer obtains it has zero
[2:39:19.360 --> 2:39:25.360]  practical or even empirical relevance to what's going on in the world now which
[2:39:25.360 --> 2:39:32.080]  seems to be going to hell in a hand basket so yeah it's it's information in
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:40.280]  education that that will win the day now one secret weapon so to speak that
[2:39:40.280 --> 2:39:48.600]  these the small stratum of power freaks have not really anticipated is that
[2:39:48.600 --> 2:39:53.680]  historically this is not just in the United States but globally historically
[2:39:53.680 --> 2:39:58.520]  there's never been a larger educated middle class these are people who have
[2:39:58.520 --> 2:40:03.880]  been to university and the people who have a college education and it's these
[2:40:03.880 --> 2:40:09.640]  people that I'm focusing on who only need to be pricked slightly for all these
[2:40:09.640 --> 2:40:16.240]  other connections and synapses to fire who will be won over to this this new
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:20.200]  level of understanding and this is happening constantly it's just it's
[2:40:20.200 --> 2:40:24.480]  multiplying it's just it's metastasizing if you will in a good way
[2:40:24.480 --> 2:40:28.720]  thanks to programs such as yours it's going to happen in the university as
[2:40:28.720 --> 2:40:33.640]  well I'm convinced of it but in order for that to take place some of us will
[2:40:33.640 --> 2:40:38.000]  have to take risks some of us will some of us will have to put our careers on
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:43.320]  the line some of us will have to get used to being mocked doesn't bother me as I
[2:40:43.320 --> 2:40:48.880]  told you I was I've always been the class clown one of my favorite intellectual
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:54.360]  heroes is the great Irish-American comedian George Carlin oh yeah I quote
[2:40:54.360 --> 2:41:00.000]  him all the time in class and he he understands the profound duality of
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:05.680]  humanity one of this great collection is called napalm and silly buddy all right
[2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:10.600]  both napalm and silly buddy came out of the same human consciousness it's that
[2:41:10.600 --> 2:41:15.160]  crazy so I want to move it more in the direction of the silly buddy and move
[2:41:15.160 --> 2:41:20.040]  away from the destructive technologies and as I lecture in class I have a lot
[2:41:20.040 --> 2:41:24.840]  of students who are in the sciences expectant scientists and engineers I'm
[2:41:24.840 --> 2:41:31.360]  telling them that the situation is so out of whack that you have careers
[2:41:31.360 --> 2:41:38.160]  guaranteed for you to undo the damage that has been brought by these power
[2:41:38.160 --> 2:41:45.120]  freaks to our environment to our bodies to our cites dehumanizing us you will
[2:41:45.120 --> 2:41:49.600]  have a guaranteed career if you understand their system and and create
[2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:55.720]  counter technologies counter literature oppositional forms of expression that you
[2:41:55.720 --> 2:42:01.080]  can cultivate at the university using their extensive resources and we can
[2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:07.480]  retake the American Republic we can regenerate this necrotic death culture
[2:42:07.480 --> 2:42:13.160]  that has been foisted upon us by MTV by the way you might not be aware of this
[2:42:13.160 --> 2:42:18.640]  I researched this because I've been a mob by these media there's a site called
[2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:25.640]  rate my professors and I score very low on that I think and I checked into it
[2:42:25.640 --> 2:42:32.480]  it's owned by MTV it's an entertainment vehicle that's being used in order to
[2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:41.080]  stigmatize me but it's not going to happen the Chancellor Kotei the mad
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:45.080]  gasser and I was there on that fateful Friday day when she called out the
[2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:52.880]  police to gas people expressing their their opposition to the direction of
[2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:57.520]  the university the mad gasser Linda Kotei by the way she's foreign born one
[2:42:57.520 --> 2:43:01.960]  of the strategies for the globalist is to put foreign-born people from
[2:43:01.960 --> 2:43:06.320]  anti-democratic societies like Greece into these top-level positions such as
[2:43:06.320 --> 2:43:10.320]  Chancellor of the University of California Davis because they're globalists
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:15.120]  they're fascist they're totalitarians they're authoritarians at minimum anyway
[2:43:15.120 --> 2:43:22.040]  Linda Kotei earlier this year sent me an extensive memorandum saying that she's
[2:43:22.040 --> 2:43:28.440]  going to put me on 25 percent salary reduction for six months so and I say
[2:43:28.440 --> 2:43:34.600]  this because a lot of people assume that so-called tenure is is absolute but
[2:43:34.600 --> 2:43:39.200]  there's many different ways to get you and one of them is death by a thousand
[2:43:39.200 --> 2:43:45.400]  cuts so I'm going to contest it and by the way if there are any labor attorneys
[2:43:45.400 --> 2:43:52.800]  out there people who are who are interested in making legal history because
[2:43:52.800 --> 2:43:58.200]  the University of California was also the site where the Bakke versus the US the
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:44:02.240]  UC Board of Regents was argued in front of the Supreme Court this could be bigger
[2:44:02.240 --> 2:44:07.320]  than Bakke because we are going to raise issues that go far beyond that of
[2:44:07.320 --> 2:44:11.080]  affirmative action we're going to go into the nature of the American Republic
[2:44:11.080 --> 2:44:16.480]  itself and the rule of the University of California California in destroying the
[2:44:16.480 --> 2:44:22.440]  American Republic professor Darryl Hamamoto is our guest and he again he's
[2:44:22.440 --> 2:44:28.560]  a well-known a political scientist and more cultural analyst and he's won
[2:44:28.560 --> 2:44:32.720]  major awards for his research and he basically has been going more and more
[2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:37.160]  public about what's really going on and and telling the young people the young
[2:44:37.160 --> 2:44:41.920]  adults there about the man behind the curtain and it's making them very
[2:44:41.920 --> 2:44:44.680]  unhappy so they're like hey we're going to cut your money buddy we're going to
[2:44:44.680 --> 2:44:49.400]  turn your lights off better do what you told and he is now going the opposite
[2:44:49.400 --> 2:44:54.280]  direction he's not a coward and what he's exposing here is that isn't left and
[2:44:54.280 --> 2:44:59.800]  right going on at the universities it is an authoritarianism that calls itself
[2:44:59.800 --> 2:45:03.280]  the left calls itself the right on the University's calls itself the left
[2:45:03.280 --> 2:45:07.840]  mainly that is incredibly oppressive and everyone should stand with him and
[2:45:07.840 --> 2:45:10.520]  even if they end up running him out of there down the road he'll have a best
[2:45:10.520 --> 2:45:14.120]  selling book in it and will become a dissonant professor but this is what
[2:45:14.120 --> 2:45:18.000]  freedom is all about this is what the animating struggle is all about and
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:22.840]  it's rewarding to do the right thing and even if doors close bigger doors in my
[2:45:22.840 --> 2:45:28.520]  experience will open or if people don't come to his aid and others aid the great
[2:45:28.520 --> 2:45:33.560]  corruption the great stagnation we already see spreading like a disease will
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:39.000]  intensify and you were speaking about how just knowing the knowledge I know
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:43.640]  from 20 years of this in business and I've done it some in business on the
[2:45:43.640 --> 2:45:49.120]  side you name it just incredible success I mean off record it's been off record
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:52.960]  I made a big deal about it I've consulted for some major corporations just
[2:45:52.960 --> 2:45:58.360]  to see what it would be like over the years and and even some major production
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:01.680]  firms I mean it's I've been in a movie produced by George Clooney was a major
[2:46:01.680 --> 2:46:06.800]  consultant on that about future charities to upgrade a Philip K. Dix film
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:09.080]  scanner darkly but I'm not going to get into a lot of it because I've signed
[2:46:09.080 --> 2:46:14.600]  non-disclosures at the level I'm at even the establishment not as a payoff but
[2:46:14.600 --> 2:46:18.080]  wants to come and see what's your view on this for a perspective because their
[2:46:18.080 --> 2:46:22.760]  own minions are so compartmentalized they don't get it just the not see only a
[2:46:22.760 --> 2:46:27.200]  very small group of less than 6,000 the Kissinger Group and I agree with it
[2:46:27.200 --> 2:46:32.320]  6,000 technocrats that's even low mid and high level run it only a few hundred at
[2:46:32.320 --> 2:46:36.560]  the top and so they don't want this knowledge known and what the professors
[2:46:36.560 --> 2:46:40.760]  reverse engineering and what I've reverse engineered from my perspective
[2:46:40.760 --> 2:46:45.720]  doesn't mean I have all the answers will bring them down but separately it can
[2:46:45.720 --> 2:46:50.360]  take the educations you've got that are only one spectrum you expand and
[2:46:50.360 --> 2:46:53.760]  basically square that expect from and then actually you're honest with
[2:46:53.760 --> 2:46:57.800]  yourself about how the real systems work start reading elite publications
[2:46:57.800 --> 2:47:00.600]  where they're trying to get their own technicians to understand how it works
[2:47:00.600 --> 2:47:05.400]  it is the most valuable education you can get and the minute people understand
[2:47:05.400 --> 2:47:10.320]  there's real knowledge they've told you doesn't exist that's that exists right
[2:47:10.320 --> 2:47:14.560]  behind the curtain in all the books they've written all their admissions you
[2:47:14.560 --> 2:47:20.480]  will then have the fire politically economically socially culturally of
[2:47:20.480 --> 2:47:25.800]  Prometheus that they're claiming they're selling real liberalism they're the
[2:47:25.800 --> 2:47:30.560]  opposite folks Thomas Jefferson's a liberal as I say every day big sis is
[2:47:30.560 --> 2:47:36.200]  not this professor I would call a real liberal okay Barack Obama is not a
[2:47:36.200 --> 2:47:41.200]  Boehner calls himself a conservative the guys a monster he's a betrayer and I'm
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:45.040]  sorry I'm ranting your professor but what you said is why they're after you
[2:47:45.040 --> 2:47:49.600]  because people know they're going into dead ends we show them hey we're not
[2:47:49.600 --> 2:47:54.120]  making the maps of the mind there are no maps experience it for yourself it's
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:57.840]  over for them of the real Renaissance as you said with this middle class it's
[2:47:57.840 --> 2:48:03.520]  left could be the detonation center for worldwide liberty to the stars and and
[2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:07.880]  that's what I want to see I want a hundred years from now for our children
[2:48:07.880 --> 2:48:12.000]  and great-grandchildren in progeny to be doing incredible things of their own
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:16.720]  free will and and that's what I desire and that's why I hate these technocrats
[2:48:16.720 --> 2:48:21.040]  so much because they would shudder the mind they would shudder perception they
[2:48:21.040 --> 2:48:25.960]  would shudder our potential so they could rule us I mean these people are
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:31.720]  disgusting they're absolutely disgusting and in my classes I tell my students I
[2:48:31.720 --> 2:48:37.320]  said I am here not just to instruct you but I'm here to honor your parents who
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:41.760]  sacrificed so much in order that you fill this seat here at this esteemed
[2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:46.040]  university it's an homage to their struggles as immigrants as refugees as
[2:48:46.040 --> 2:48:50.960]  fifth or sixth generation Americans and there's a third constituency besides you
[2:48:50.960 --> 2:48:55.360]  that's sitting in this classroom and that is your progeny your unborn children
[2:48:55.360 --> 2:49:01.160]  who will benefit from your learning acquired at this institution so I have
[2:49:01.160 --> 2:49:06.480]  three constituencies and by the way in Japanese language there's a character
[2:49:06.480 --> 2:49:13.040]  it's sensei and in Chinese it's sifu but it means there's a notion of
[2:49:13.040 --> 2:49:16.880]  generativity and that which comes before so that's that interlocking
[2:49:16.880 --> 2:49:23.760]  generativity and that that that connection with future generations that you
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:29.240]  speak of often that I am trying to communicate to the classroom and to the
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:32.920]  students in the classroom and in that way they can connect what they're
[2:49:32.920 --> 2:49:39.760]  learning from what's before them with the future as well as with the past that's
[2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:43.680]  that's one of my main pedagogical strategies well they're obviously scared
[2:49:43.680 --> 2:49:49.240]  of what you're doing and as you said once the genie is out of the bottle the
[2:49:49.240 --> 2:49:53.800]  genie is out of the bottle it's not going back I agree you can't unhear
[2:49:53.800 --> 2:49:58.520]  information you can't on your the truth you can't learn it it's the only you
[2:49:58.520 --> 2:50:02.320]  know if they get rid of me that more people are gonna be rolling forward and
[2:50:02.320 --> 2:50:06.580]  I think my appearance here is going to embolden a lot of my colleagues to step
[2:50:06.580 --> 2:50:10.040]  forward most of them are scared most of them are frightened most of them want to
[2:50:10.040 --> 2:50:15.280]  retire on a pension that won't be there when it's time for them to go so they
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:19.840]  have that we either fight now stand up now we're gonna lose everything we fight
[2:50:19.840 --> 2:50:25.080]  now but this this lead drawn a line in the sand and and it's do or die right
[2:50:25.080 --> 2:50:29.240]  here now well I want to come back in the final segment here professor and I
[2:50:29.240 --> 2:50:32.560]  want to invite you back soon to get into the specifics of the immigrant
[2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:38.560]  programming the L Beach you know all that programming that's going on and just
[2:50:38.560 --> 2:50:43.280]  look at every little angle of this from a different perspective so we can
[2:50:43.280 --> 2:50:46.000]  hopefully get people thinking for themselves I'll do a little bit of
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:50.680]  overdrive to go to Matt and George and Nathan and folks that have been holding
[2:50:50.680 --> 2:50:56.800]  but our guest professor Darryl Homamodo joins us right now he is already

[2:54:22.320 --> 2:54:25.680]  literally laugh at them and say you know do we live in authoritarian country
[2:54:25.680 --> 2:54:30.080]  why are you acting menacing to me and then they'll usually start backing off
[2:54:30.080 --> 2:54:35.520]  but if you cower or you blow up at them you're gonna get beat up and that's most
[2:54:35.520 --> 2:54:40.760]  police I run into honor the First Amendment now but more and more more
[2:54:40.760 --> 2:54:45.080]  they come after you and on average it is the quote left-wing controlled cities
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:48.720]  that were the police are becoming the most aggressive and vicious because
[2:54:48.720 --> 2:54:54.040]  they're not left-wing the system is using left cover to get away with
[2:54:54.040 --> 2:54:57.000]  everything they're doing I mean obviously there's real issues with
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:55:00.920]  people persecuting gay folks obviously there's real issues with immigrants
[2:55:00.920 --> 2:55:05.040]  being treated horrible and exploited they are exploited
[2:55:05.040 --> 2:55:07.720]  talk about Latin Americans all day because that's the majority but they're
[2:55:07.720 --> 2:55:13.280]  super hard-working people now Obama wants folks that aren't people that way
[2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:20.000]  they grab them 600 pounds folks in way 6x underwear to go directly on the
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:25.080]  welfare system directly to be controlled this is a total takeover and
[2:55:25.080 --> 2:55:28.280]  it's our final segment I want to invite him back whenever he wants to come
[2:55:28.280 --> 2:55:31.760]  next week that you know to really drill into what happens Japanese Americans
[2:55:31.760 --> 2:55:35.920]  and and break down that model that another interview about how they're
[2:55:35.920 --> 2:55:39.120]  trying to politicize people's sexual preference and trying to create a
[2:55:39.120 --> 2:55:44.600]  political underclass they control but also a political donating class get
[2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:49.640]  into the whole situation with the radicalization of Hispanics but professor
[2:55:49.640 --> 2:55:53.120]  Darryl Homamoto in closing what are other points you'd like to make about
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:56.480]  where all this is going what you think the ruling establishment's going to do
[2:55:56.480 --> 2:56:01.960]  because it's like two runaway trains headed for a collision well at the
[2:56:01.960 --> 2:56:06.480]  University of California there is a program they call it his fantasization
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:11.440]  and what they're doing right now is staffing key administrative upper level
[2:56:11.440 --> 2:56:15.760]  managerial administrative posts with primary Latinas not necessarily Latinos
[2:56:15.760 --> 2:56:19.360]  men that's it's the women and you're gonna see the pipe of their culture a lot
[2:56:19.360 --> 2:56:24.520]  of more Latina spokespersons for different agencies in order to get us
[2:56:24.520 --> 2:56:30.760]  acclimated to oppression from this emerging group that's being set up by
[2:56:30.760 --> 2:56:37.880]  the globalist by the way one of the the the blind spots that people of any
[2:56:37.880 --> 2:56:43.880]  ethnicity really is that they think that the United States of America it's a
[2:56:43.880 --> 2:56:48.880]  system of governance this society is going to be far more humane under
[2:56:48.880 --> 2:56:54.480]  Latino oppression as opposed to the Anglo oppression and as we know from the
[2:56:54.480 --> 2:56:58.960]  study of history it doesn't really work out that way I mean look at Mao Zedong
[2:56:58.960 --> 2:57:04.280]  oppressing his fellow Han people people of the same racial stock I mean that is
[2:57:04.280 --> 2:57:08.880]  the height of it is he and I think if there's one single area that has
[2:57:08.880 --> 2:57:15.680]  contributed to the silence of my my colleagues in academia it's the fact
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:19.520]  that their firm belief that a person a minority person is inherently going to
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:24.680]  be more fair to them and give them a square a fair deal now that that whole
[2:57:24.680 --> 2:57:30.880]  fallacy has been invalidated by Barry Sotoro aka Brock Hussain Obama so this
[2:57:30.880 --> 2:57:35.840]  time around they're going to give us a woman with a twist or someone from the
[2:57:35.840 --> 2:57:40.760]  GLBT community to see if they can game that that same strategy this time around
[2:57:40.760 --> 2:57:45.560]  though we're a lot more smart and we're not gonna we won't be fooled again to
[2:57:45.560 --> 2:57:52.160]  paraphrase the great English poet Pete Townsend well said and it really is
[2:57:52.160 --> 2:57:57.120]  scary that it's open but if you go back to the Roman slavery again they would
[2:57:57.120 --> 2:58:00.960]  have it was white women then mainly German slaves French slaves called
[2:58:00.960 --> 2:58:05.080]  Gauls at the time that they would bring the women in to be the oppressors of the
[2:58:05.080 --> 2:58:08.160]  slave men and would say you take care of them keep them in line we won't kill
[2:58:08.160 --> 2:58:11.280]  them and it was the same thing with black communities here and now they're
[2:58:11.280 --> 2:58:16.520]  gonna set women up in a fake feminism over men again it's just it history
[2:58:16.520 --> 2:58:22.520]  repeats itself it's imperial controlled and it's directly targeting men because
[2:58:22.520 --> 2:58:27.000]  men will end up wanting to be free statistically more so the men have to
[2:58:27.000 --> 2:58:30.560]  be gelded that's why most horses you get and ride are female it's just
[2:58:30.560 --> 2:58:34.000]  stallions give you a problem it's a targeting of men really is what it is
[2:58:34.000 --> 2:58:37.120]  nothing against women it just is a targeting of men by a hyper male

[2:59:55.720 --> 3:00:09.840]  Jones Broadcasting Network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[3:00:09.840 --> 3:00:17.640]  you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and
[3:00:17.640 --> 3:00:25.040]  now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones I went to the Caribbean do I do some
[3:00:25.040 --> 3:00:29.680]  free diving skin diving's the old name of it and things like that I was going
[3:00:29.680 --> 3:00:32.760]  through some photos and I realized it was like I was trying to recreate the
[3:00:32.760 --> 3:00:37.440]  Vladimir Putin calendar you know with me skin diving at about 40 feet which is
[3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:42.240]  not that deep we've got that image when I was on the wreck of the kitty wake a
[3:00:42.240 --> 3:00:46.560]  US destroyer will put that up on screen that's up on Twitter right now
[3:00:46.560 --> 3:00:52.760]  fighting tyranny on air land and sea and then there's one with me on a horse
[3:00:52.760 --> 3:00:58.400]  which we then photoshopped into planet of the apes that was Darren McBreen's idea
[3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:02.640]  and so I've decided I think let me put out a Alex Jones tough guy calendar
[3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:06.360]  because they're attacking men in that image so I think I'm gonna start
[3:01:06.360 --> 3:01:10.080]  promoting it just to rub it in their face yes girls I'm being somewhat
[3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:14.080]  sarcastic but I'm actually thinking about doing it as a stunt now what would
[3:01:14.080 --> 3:01:17.360]  sell better alien magnitude counter Alex Jones calendar I think we know which
[3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:22.640]  one I'm gonna stop right there let's go ahead and talk to Matt and Indiana
[3:01:22.640 --> 3:01:29.920]  Matt you're on the air welcome hey mr. Jones hey brother hey so just quickly
[3:01:29.920 --> 3:01:33.840]  anybody with the Android phone I had I went into my messaging and then I went
[3:01:33.840 --> 3:01:37.960]  into the settings and in the settings of my Android phone I have emergency
[3:01:37.960 --> 3:01:43.000]  alerts and in those emergency alerts I have extreme alerts severe alerts amber
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:47.560]  alerts all of which I can turn off but then at the very top I also have
[3:01:47.560 --> 3:01:52.880]  presidential alerts and those I cannot turn off yeah that's a great headline I
[3:01:52.880 --> 3:01:56.280]  saw that months ago one of my friends phones I said we need to do a headline
[3:01:56.280 --> 3:02:00.880]  you cannot you you cannot turn off Obama's phone calls or cannot turn off
[3:02:00.880 --> 3:02:05.160]  and and they admit I told people this a decade ago the president will just be
[3:02:05.160 --> 3:02:09.960]  contacting you constantly even with video messages and it wakes people up
[3:02:09.960 --> 3:02:13.280]  all the time that I know I mean I ended up just turning the phone off put in
[3:02:13.280 --> 3:02:16.760]  other room when all these alerts come on it turns the phone on even when it's
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:22.160]  off that's what alerted it to me because I'm sitting in here cooking dinner and
[3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:24.720]  all of a sudden my phone's going off I'm like oh well what's this oh it's an
[3:02:24.720 --> 3:02:27.560]  emergency alert so then I started looking into it well how can I turn this
[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:31.760]  off so I found the settings to turn everything else off but presidential
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:36.200]  alerts now what's so important that I need to be alerted by the president I
[3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:39.560]  mean that just tells you what kind of country you know we're living in living
[3:02:39.560 --> 3:02:42.760]  it I can see that in North Korea or something else but oh no no I mean I
[3:02:42.760 --> 3:02:46.680]  exactly something have a list of authoritarianism and you just go down the
[3:02:46.680 --> 3:02:50.240]  list and see we can't do it all brother you called in to warn us of this it
