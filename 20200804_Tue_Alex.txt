[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  and
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.340]  Now, what public safety looks like for us?
[05:13.340 --> 05:15.140]  It means her in charge of the police.
[05:15.140 --> 05:17.860]  You talk about frightening.
[05:17.860 --> 05:19.940]  You talk about delusional crazy people,
[05:19.940 --> 05:23.820]  all funded by Gates, the UN, replacement migration.
[05:23.820 --> 05:26.580]  This is just a nightmare scenario, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:26.580 --> 05:29.340]  And see, it's Stockholm syndrome to love it
[05:29.340 --> 05:32.860]  and think it's your friend and to go along with it
[05:32.860 --> 05:36.540]  when all it's doing is creating a post-human world.
[05:37.980 --> 05:39.900]  And that's why we're taught to hate ourselves.
[05:39.900 --> 05:41.780]  It's why we're taught that America sucks.
[05:41.780 --> 05:43.480]  It's why you're taught that humans are bad.
[05:43.480 --> 05:45.420]  It's so an evil group of people
[05:45.420 --> 05:48.700]  will have you just basically commit cultural suicide
[05:48.700 --> 05:51.100]  and stand down so they rule you,
[05:51.100 --> 05:52.460]  so they can get rid of you.
[05:52.460 --> 05:56.940]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:56.940 --> 05:59.740]  There's been a giant explosion in Beirut.
[05:59.740 --> 06:02.460]  The latest on that and so much more.
[06:02.460 --> 06:04.700]  Safe for lockdown being announced.
[06:04.700 --> 06:06.180]  This is the battle for humanity.
[06:06.180 --> 06:11.180]  This is the AI takeover.
[06:11.180 --> 06:12.540]  Been on air in 26 years.
[06:12.540 --> 06:14.700]  Starting about 24 years ago,
[06:14.700 --> 06:17.980]  I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors,
[06:17.980 --> 06:19.700]  producers, actors.
[06:19.700 --> 06:21.500]  They wanted to meet with me and they said,
[06:21.500 --> 06:23.380]  what is your formal education?
[06:23.380 --> 06:25.500]  And I said, well, really nothing but a few years of college.
[06:25.500 --> 06:28.660]  They said, well, how are you one of the best
[06:28.660 --> 06:32.060]  science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[06:32.060 --> 06:35.860]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable.
[06:35.860 --> 06:36.880]  We'd like you to be in movies.
[06:36.880 --> 06:38.100]  We'd like you to write with us.
[06:38.100 --> 06:40.060]  We'd like you to do voiceovers.
[06:40.060 --> 06:41.180]  You're just a Renaissance man.
[06:41.180 --> 06:42.580]  The folks know I was in some movies
[06:42.580 --> 06:44.420]  and Harry Shearer made statements like that
[06:44.420 --> 06:45.260]  and a lot of others.
[06:45.260 --> 06:46.220]  I'm not bragging.
[06:46.220 --> 06:47.220]  I kept explaining to them.
[06:47.220 --> 06:49.260]  I said, do you understand?
[06:49.260 --> 06:51.180]  I didn't come up with any of this.
[06:51.180 --> 06:54.060]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers
[06:54.060 --> 06:57.140]  and futurist documents and they would just laugh me
[06:57.140 --> 06:58.540]  and say, oh, no way.
[06:58.540 --> 07:00.340]  Then I would give them the documents.
[07:00.340 --> 07:02.900]  They would get very, very scared the next time I saw them
[07:02.900 --> 07:04.820]  in a few months and say, man, you're right.
[07:04.820 --> 07:05.940]  This is just hoping.
[07:05.940 --> 07:08.220]  Folks, I didn't make any of this up.
[07:08.220 --> 07:08.700]  OK?
[07:08.700 --> 07:09.340]  It's real.
[07:09.340 --> 07:09.860]  It's real.
[07:09.860 --> 07:22.460]  Newcastle
[07:22.460 --> 07:34.900]  It is Tuesday, August 4.
[07:34.900 --> 07:36.120]  The year is 2020.
[07:36.120 --> 07:43.120]  We are 90 Earth rotations out from this incredible election.
[07:43.120 --> 07:45.120]  Strap yourselves in.
[07:45.120 --> 07:53.120]  There's been a giant explosion in Beirut in a huge mushroom cloud that some thought might have been an atomic or hydrogen bomb going off.
[07:53.120 --> 07:59.120]  It could be seen from 30, 40 miles away, going as high as 40,000 feet in the air.
[07:59.120 --> 08:04.120]  And that incredible still shot from AFP TV viewers can see on screen.
[08:04.120 --> 08:08.120]  But the good news is it's bad news, but not that bad.
[08:08.120 --> 08:14.120]  There was a fire at the port, a fireworks factory blew up.
[08:14.120 --> 08:22.120]  And so that is what caused that very ominous looking explosion that obviously killed a lot of people.
[08:22.120 --> 08:27.120]  So it's bad news, but the good news is it was not a terrorist attack.
[08:27.120 --> 08:33.120]  Just 20 minutes ago, it was terrifying mystery blast shockwave filmed over Beirut. Now they know it's fireworks.
[08:33.120 --> 08:36.120]  The BBC is reporting.
[08:36.120 --> 08:41.120]  Now, let's get into it here.
[08:41.120 --> 08:44.120]  Let's lay out the news.
[08:44.120 --> 08:48.120]  You know, I think the best thing for me to do is something I did yesterday and I did a pretty good job.
[08:48.120 --> 08:53.120]  And that was in the first segment, doing nothing but reading headlines.
[08:53.120 --> 09:00.120]  And then coming back after that and getting into the headlines in specifics in the tail, because that just gives you the flavor of what's going on.
[09:00.120 --> 09:03.120]  So let's go ahead and do that right now.
[09:03.120 --> 09:10.120]  New York Times op-ed suggests scrapping the 2020 presidential debates.
[09:10.120 --> 09:16.120]  Because when you're running a corpse, you can't actually have it on television.
[09:16.120 --> 09:24.120]  Trump claims authority to issue order on mail in votes, executive order, associated press.
[09:24.120 --> 09:33.120]  Good news. Trump is registering more new votes than Democrats in key swing states, gatewaypundit.com.
[09:33.120 --> 09:47.120]  New Nevada law allows Democrats to enter nursing homes, Fox News is reporting, vote for dementia patients without their signature actual video of it and the law.
[09:47.120 --> 10:00.120]  Wow. It's all political. New Mexico dem governor says protest are okay, but knocking on doors or register voters is not the definition of hypocrisy and fraud.
[10:00.120 --> 10:05.120]  Trump questions Epstein suicide. Was he killed?
[10:05.120 --> 10:10.120]  Explained what he was talking about with gasoline Maxwell. He said he wishes her well. He doesn't want her to die.
[10:10.120 --> 10:13.120]  He wants her to live a long time so she can testify.
[10:13.120 --> 10:21.120]  Trump fires CEO of Tennessee Valley Authority for outsourcing jobs to foreign workers after meeting with US tech workers.
[10:21.120 --> 10:24.120]  Talk about listening to your base.
[10:24.120 --> 10:30.120]  Singapore attack visitors with electronic monitoring devices to ensure COVID-19 quarantine appliance.
[10:30.120 --> 10:36.120]  But don't worry, when you're in the country, they've got the database on your phone, which is the new order plan.
[10:36.120 --> 10:44.120]  Singapore will give residents wearable tokens that track the people they interact with in new effort to contain COVID-19.
[10:44.120 --> 10:51.120]  And now city parks in Austin are making you register and give them a digital number at the beginning of this to be able to use Barton Springs, other areas.
[10:51.120 --> 10:59.120]  I am going to lead a march where we go into Barton Springs and we swim and we'll probably get arrested because we're not anti-shooting at police or something.
[10:59.120 --> 11:03.120]  But we've got to start having our civil rights movement, our human rights movement against this, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:03.120 --> 11:09.120]  This is an admitted takeover where you have to be tracked to go outside.
[11:09.120 --> 11:12.120]  And remember who else was pushing this a month ago? This is Jerusalem Post.
[11:12.120 --> 11:17.120]  Benjamin Netanyahu suggests microchipping kids slammed by experts.
[11:17.120 --> 11:24.120]  Michael Gates is announcing it. Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on info.
[11:24.120 --> 11:28.120]  A big detailed report from Michael Snyder at infowars.com.
[11:28.120 --> 11:31.120]  Suggest you read that and share that because it all ties into this.
[11:31.120 --> 11:34.120]  And look at this photo. You're a TV viewer. Radio listeners can go to infowars.com.
[11:34.120 --> 11:36.120]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson article.
[11:36.120 --> 11:43.120]  Houston mayor orders $250 fines for people who refuse to wear masks.
[11:43.120 --> 11:47.120]  He wears a mask that says, I can't breathe on it.
[11:47.120 --> 11:51.120]  Even though major studies are coming out.
[11:51.120 --> 11:56.120]  On record showing that they don't help you. They don't keep you safe and they cause health problems.
[11:56.120 --> 11:59.120]  Like not being able to breathe.
[11:59.120 --> 12:05.120]  We have video where doctors report pharmacies are refusing to fill HCQ totally legal prescriptions.
[12:05.120 --> 12:09.120]  In Ohio and Michigan have reversed bans on it after outcry by doctors.
[12:09.120 --> 12:13.120]  But now the pharmacies are good little globalists.
[12:13.120 --> 12:18.120]  They're going to refuse the people with medical degrees because Bill Gates said so.
[12:18.120 --> 12:21.120]  He's not a doctor, but he does run them.
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.120]  AP Spain's new wave of infections hits the young middle age.
[12:25.120 --> 12:27.120]  You read in the statistics it's all made up.
[12:27.120 --> 12:32.120]  FDA shifting standards for Chinese face mask fuel confusion.
[12:32.120 --> 12:34.120]  I can't effing breathe under this thing.
[12:34.120 --> 12:36.120]  LSU linebacker thenifies flaw.
[12:36.120 --> 12:41.120]  Flaw is actually a space helmet in new coronavirus helmets.
[12:41.120 --> 12:45.120]  It's a space helmet without an oxygen tube.
[12:45.120 --> 12:51.120]  But if they can get us to wear a bag over our head and affix it ourselves, why not?
[12:51.120 --> 12:55.120]  You know they're laughing at you.
[12:55.120 --> 12:59.120]  Meanwhile, Trump says crazy Nancy Pelosi slow rolling coronavirus aid.
[12:59.120 --> 13:02.120]  Only interested in bailing out radical leftists, which she admits.
[13:02.120 --> 13:05.120]  She says everybody else is collateral damage.
[13:05.120 --> 13:09.120]  The leader of the American Communist Party has endorsed Biden.
[13:09.120 --> 13:13.120]  Then of course the really big news is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[13:13.120 --> 13:15.120]  There is a major move to crash the dollar.
[13:15.120 --> 13:18.120]  I'll explain what's behind that and how to stop it.
[13:18.120 --> 13:19.120]  And yes, we're fiat.
[13:19.120 --> 13:24.120]  Yes, we're over financial territory that we shouldn't be.
[13:24.120 --> 13:27.120]  But I'm going to explain the big picture and what's really going on.
[13:27.120 --> 13:30.120]  Why they have all these so-called conservatives out there saying America's over.
[13:30.120 --> 13:31.120]  The dollar's dead.
[13:31.120 --> 13:33.120]  You know, everything's going to collapse.
[13:33.120 --> 13:36.120]  It's because they're invested in China and they're invested with the globalist.
[13:36.120 --> 13:38.120]  Who's even more inflated than us.
[13:38.120 --> 13:41.120]  So I'll be explaining all that bottom of the hour.
[13:41.120 --> 13:43.120]  Back into the hydroxychloroquine area.
[13:43.120 --> 13:45.120]  You're going to really need to see these articles.
[13:45.120 --> 13:52.120]  COVID-19, Dr. Zelenko, 150,000 Americans and many more around the world are dead
[13:52.120 --> 13:58.120]  because HCQ stood in the way of making trillions for Fauci gates and others.
[13:58.120 --> 14:04.120]  These two charts should land Dr. Fauci in prison and shows the countries that use hydroxychloroquine
[14:04.120 --> 14:05.120]  had almost no deaths.
[14:05.120 --> 14:13.120]  Those that didn't use it had the highest deaths because it is a zinc deficiency in the cells,
[14:13.120 --> 14:15.120]  which the NIH website admits.
[14:15.120 --> 14:22.120]  Exclusive New York health commissioner, Zucker, won't provide number of elderly who went from nursing homes
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.120]  and then died in hospitals reportedly the only state not to gather this data.
[14:26.120 --> 14:29.120]  But we know they had the most deaths in any state in the nursing homes.
[14:29.120 --> 14:35.120]  The land with no face mask, Daily Mail, Holland's top scientists say there's no solid evidence
[14:35.120 --> 14:39.120]  covering work that they actually spread the disease and make you sick.
[14:39.120 --> 14:42.120]  And well, but then that's what the science shows.
[14:42.120 --> 14:47.120]  And of course they have some of the lowest numbers in the world, just like Sweden.
[14:47.120 --> 14:49.120]  But it's an act of submission.
[14:49.120 --> 14:50.120]  Unbelievable.
[14:50.120 --> 14:54.120]  A new interview, Bobby Kennedy Jr. claims, he doesn't claim, it's right there in the documents,
[14:54.120 --> 14:59.120]  Dr. Fauci will make millions on coronavirus vaccine and owns half of the patent.
[14:59.120 --> 15:01.120]  We reported that six months ago, folks.
[15:01.120 --> 15:09.120]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation own at least three patents, two of them with Fauci on a COVID-19
[15:09.120 --> 15:15.120]  type coming virus that's been developed for animals.
[15:15.120 --> 15:17.120]  But in the patent, it says we'll work in humans as well.
[15:17.120 --> 15:20.120]  Oh, it turns out they've already been doing some secret testing.
[15:20.120 --> 15:27.120]  Las Vegas gambler removed from famous Four Queens Casino in handcuffs after he went in
[15:27.120 --> 15:28.120]  without wearing a mask.
[15:28.120 --> 15:32.120]  But the illegal aliens come across with direct-resistant TB and a million point four die.
[15:32.120 --> 15:33.120]  But that's no big deal.
[15:33.120 --> 15:40.120]  The police want a virtue signal and grab someone not submitting properly.
[15:40.120 --> 15:46.120]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, lockdown 2.0 looks like harsher rules, deeper confusion.
[15:46.120 --> 15:51.120]  They're now admitting that Australia and Spain will be the model for the United States next.
[15:51.120 --> 15:56.120]  And they're going to be coming in your homes with the contact tracers.
[15:56.120 --> 16:02.120]  So the same group that says abolish the police, though, will have the police do their dirty work.
[16:02.120 --> 16:05.120]  And the UN says, oh, we're in for a rocky ride.
[16:05.120 --> 16:06.120]  Oh, it's only going to get worse.
[16:06.120 --> 16:07.120]  Coronavirus will never go away.
[16:07.120 --> 16:12.120]  Give up all your rights because they can take any death statistic they want and add it and rise COVID
[16:12.120 --> 16:19.120]  or lower COVID to lock you down when they want and make you accept total tracking, total control, total enslavement.
[16:19.120 --> 16:23.120]  We're going to go through more of this when we come back.
[16:23.120 --> 16:26.120]  I've only covered two of the stats.
[16:26.120 --> 16:30.120]  I have seven, eight other stacks here.
[16:30.120 --> 16:36.120]  And I think what I'll do is next segment, I'll finish up the hydroxychloroquine and the COVID-19 Worldwide
[16:36.120 --> 16:42.120]  Marshal Law Lockdown News, and then I'll get into the police stand-down news.
[16:42.120 --> 16:49.120]  Then I'll get into the UN power grab takeover news and I'll get into the election power grab news, the election fraud news,
[16:49.120 --> 16:57.120]  and then the bottom of the hour, the biggest new threat, the plan that's now admitted to crash the US dollar, destroy US dominance forever,
[16:57.120 --> 16:59.120]  and put communist China and the EU in the driver's seat.
[16:59.120 --> 17:04.120]  America and the world fighting against the new dark age of globalist tyranny.
[17:04.120 --> 17:05.120]  This couldn't be more critical.
[17:05.120 --> 17:09.120]  I'm Alex Jones, faithful to the United States.
[17:09.120 --> 17:21.120]  States cracking down on social gatherings says CNN because Fauci says if we don't, we'll see further surges in coronavirus positives
[17:21.120 --> 17:30.120]  because they're only ramping up the testing and because the tests have been designed at the Wuhan lab, it turns out, to be completely fraudulent.
[17:30.120 --> 17:42.120]  They cooked the whole thing up offshore in a communist dictatorship with Fauci, Bill Gates, and the Chai comms to be directed by the UN as a giant planetary power grab.
[17:42.120 --> 17:49.120]  And now it's all over the news that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital tattoos under your skin, and so has Google,
[17:49.120 --> 17:55.120]  and they're deploying them at the airports next year where you'll have to have it to be able to travel,
[17:55.120 --> 18:01.120]  oh, and then soon to leave your house or go in a grocery store, and the contact tracers work for Bill and Bill Gates and the Clintons,
[18:01.120 --> 18:04.120]  and they're going to come to your house and make sure you're inoculated.
[18:04.120 --> 18:08.120]  Yes, we're now inside the Mark of the Beast, resist to be enslaved.
[18:08.120 --> 18:16.120]  Another part of the Great Awakening that's taking place is people that haven't even been religious or Christian now see how evil is out in the open,
[18:16.120 --> 18:24.120]  how hundreds of churches have been burned in Europe and the US, hundreds of Christian icons have been burned, destroyed.
[18:24.120 --> 18:29.120]  Jesus has had their heads cut off all over the country, all over the Philippines, all over Europe.
[18:29.120 --> 18:32.120]  Virgin Mary's are getting torn down. I mean, crosses are being torn down.
[18:32.120 --> 18:39.120]  It's absolutely out of control, but people now understand that evil was always real. It is spiritual.
[18:39.120 --> 18:44.120]  And it was just waiting to make its move, building beneath the surface, and now it's emerged.
[18:44.120 --> 18:49.120]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it. I'm praying for America, I'm praying for you,
[18:49.120 --> 18:52.120]  and I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it.
[18:52.120 --> 18:57.120]  We need to come together and pray for even greater awakening, pray for Donald Trump to be protected,
[18:57.120 --> 19:05.120]  pray for him to win a landslide, and pray for the people under deception of the globalists to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[19:05.120 --> 19:29.120]  God bless you all. Please pray for him for us as well.
[19:29.120 --> 19:51.120]  Alex Jones, The Cure to Fake News, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[19:51.120 --> 19:59.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are Back Live Broadcasting Worldwide. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[19:59.120 --> 20:08.120]  And what I'm going to do for the rest of this segment is read through these headlines and break down what our enemies in the New World Order are doing
[20:08.120 --> 20:22.120]  and how they're building this giant cashless society system that tracks our every move and controls where we can do what we can do according to social engineering,
[20:22.120 --> 20:28.120]  which is designed to only tighten the news further.
[20:28.120 --> 20:39.120]  And so the more that we comply, the more that we submit, the worse things get.
[20:39.120 --> 20:51.120]  That's why they're announcing right now, oh, the UN's advising Australia and Spain on level four lockdown.
[20:51.120 --> 21:02.120]  And so the very bio weapons labs, the very UN program that dump this out on the planet, that owns the patents to the vaccines that standing at all this power and money in control
[21:02.120 --> 21:16.120]  are the very people that then censor all these medical doctors and all these scientists around the world that are simply coming out and reporting what's known real medical science.
[21:16.120 --> 21:31.120]  But see that known consensus by the actual professionals is under attack by the big tech technology that's merged with big pharma that is turning doctors into nothing but janitors
[21:31.120 --> 21:42.120]  who will oversee the robots and the computers and the AI systems that are programmed by the eugenicist to carry out the orderly extermination of the people of the earth.
[21:42.120 --> 21:58.120]  And so we've got a giant planetary Tuskegee level experiment going on against humanity right now.
[21:58.120 --> 22:07.120]  And you've got all these compliant sheeple that don't want to hear about how Fauci lied about everything that don't want to hear about how COVID was made in the lab,
[22:07.120 --> 22:16.120]  who don't want to hear about the contact tracing and the apps on the phones and who don't want to hear about the digital microchips and digital tattoos.
[22:16.120 --> 22:33.120]  They actually think that by submitting they are part of the power structure and that they are basking in the glow of the system when they're nothing but useful, idiot, schmuck, sucker, marks, fools, sheep.
[22:33.120 --> 22:42.120]  So again, when they come up to you and say, wear your mask, don't respond back because they're expecting you to do that and then they start yelling at you and don't listen.
[22:42.120 --> 22:48.120]  When they say, oh, you have nothing to say, you say, yes, I don't believe in cruelty to animals.
[22:48.120 --> 22:58.120]  And when they get mad at that and say, what are you saying, I'm a bitch, are you saying I'm a, no, I'm saying you're a sheep.
[22:58.120 --> 23:16.120]  Because when the system organizes the sheep in mob rule, in a giant stampede of lemmings, of cattle, to overrun us, we have a responsibility to tell those dumb cows that they better get out of your way.
[23:16.120 --> 23:20.120]  Because they're not going to listen to reason, they're not going to listen to science, they're not going to listen to facts.
[23:20.120 --> 23:30.120]  They're going to listen when they throw hot coffee on you, when you break their nose.
[23:30.120 --> 23:39.120]  They're going to listen when they come to your table and try to embarrass you when you go over and get in their face, because that's what it takes is standing up to them.
[23:39.120 --> 23:48.120]  When you bow down to sheeple, when you grovel to sheeple, it only makes them more emboldened.
[23:48.120 --> 23:59.120]  It only makes them more out of control, because finally they believe they can go out and have personal power over people, because they believe in the power of the sheep.
[23:59.120 --> 24:03.120]  Now, the crew is great. I kind of get in the zone here.
[24:03.120 --> 24:12.120]  And during the break, I was going to get some documents to do some research and I got talked to in the hall by my son, who brought up another story to me.
[24:12.120 --> 24:23.120]  And then I go back, he works here now, and he was like, look at this article, look at this story, and I just can't do it.
[24:23.120 --> 24:29.120]  Because I'm totally in the zone about this COVID thing, and I was loaded for bear to come in here and cover that.
[24:29.120 --> 24:32.120]  And now I just got distracted off.
[24:32.120 --> 24:36.120]  The rule is, don't talk to me in the hallway, folks. Everybody knows that.
[24:36.120 --> 24:48.120]  And I begged Rex to stop it, so I'll do it on air, and maybe he'll hear it that way.
[24:48.120 --> 24:53.120]  You know, I had my attention span destroyed by television, but it's nothing compared to young people now.
[24:53.120 --> 25:00.120]  And, you know, we sit here and we watch the enemy just wreck our minds and turn us against each other. It's just so damn sad.
[25:00.120 --> 25:04.120]  And, you know, the more prepared I get for a broadcast, the harder it is to do.
[25:04.120 --> 25:13.120]  Because I could talk for hours and hours and hours about one of these stories.
[25:13.120 --> 25:18.120]  And I just can't do it anymore.
[25:18.120 --> 25:22.120]  People think that I should be really happy right now because I've been vindicated.
[25:22.120 --> 25:31.120]  And I'm not happy about that because I'm sitting here watching scientific evil.
[25:31.120 --> 25:38.120]  Takeover society, takeover civilization.
[25:38.120 --> 25:46.120]  And I know it's all 100% certified, and the enemies that are running it say they want to kill me and my family.
[25:46.120 --> 25:56.120]  And even the most hardcore people that are awake, myself included, still don't take this as seriously as we should.
[25:56.120 --> 26:01.120]  It's outrageous to get into Barton Springs City Park. It's a damned up spring.
[26:01.120 --> 26:06.120]  They got downtown that I've been swimming in since I was born.
[26:06.120 --> 26:17.120]  That you've got to give them contact tracing info and your phone number and your driver's license so you can be contact traced when they test somebody else.
[26:17.120 --> 26:26.120]  And then they come up as infected. They can then count 15 random people around you under NIH UN guidelines.
[26:26.120 --> 26:29.120]  And then you get counted as having COVID.
[26:29.120 --> 26:36.120]  And again, it's all based on fraud because the system is a fraud and it wants you to accept total fraud.
[26:36.120 --> 26:38.120]  And so what do we do?
[26:38.120 --> 26:44.120]  I call for the lifeguards to all be fired. I call for Barton Springs to have its fences torn down.
[26:44.120 --> 26:49.120]  I call for the bureaucracy to be shut down. I call for the mayor to be gotten rid of.
[26:49.120 --> 26:51.120]  You know who isn't essential? That mayor.
[26:51.120 --> 26:57.120]  Anytime leftist globalists get control of your city, they ruin everything.
[26:57.120 --> 27:02.120]  They call in the homeless. They sell the fentanyl. There's feces everywhere.
[27:02.120 --> 27:11.120]  And then there's all these little city employees that line up and go along with the bureaucracy, including the police more and more around the country and the world.
[27:11.120 --> 27:17.120]  They enforce the fake mask ordinances and they enforce all the crap. They're not getting rid of the police.
[27:17.120 --> 27:34.120]  They're getting rid of the police doing regular police work now because now they're going to swing into being social workers that control and run our lives.
[27:34.120 --> 27:36.120]  And that's all.
[27:36.120 --> 27:42.120]  It's about controlling you and when they say jump, you ask how high.
[27:42.120 --> 27:45.120]  And so again, everything is about noncompliance now.
[27:45.120 --> 27:52.120]  I'm serious. They've broken the social contract. All blue cities in blue states are not American.
[27:52.120 --> 27:55.120]  They're globalist. They're enemies of the country. They don't believe it should exist.
[27:55.120 --> 28:00.120]  And they're nothing but criminals trying to bring it down and they see us as collateral damage, as Nancy Pelosi said.
[28:00.120 --> 28:02.120]  And that's it.
[28:02.120 --> 28:07.120]  We're trying to get refocused and come back. Stay with us.
[28:07.120 --> 28:17.120]  Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to introduce to you a new line of high quality products developed by my father, a retired dentist, Dr. David R. Jones.
[28:17.120 --> 28:27.120]  Dr. Jones Naturals, naturally fluoride free activated charcoal toothpaste, which cleans your teeth, freshens your breath and is enamel safe.
[28:27.120 --> 28:32.120]  This is a concentrated toothpaste. It doesn't have all the fillers. It is amazing.
[28:32.120 --> 28:37.120]  Folks have loved the other toothpaste that he's developed. If you like those, you're really going to love this.
[28:37.120 --> 28:41.120]  And there's also the high quality activated charcoal mouthwash.
[28:41.120 --> 28:50.120]  And then on top of that, eight other new products available at infowarstore.com with this new line, Dr. Jones Naturals.

[29:00.120 --> 29:21.120]  Again, my dad, who helped launch the M4, is now a major sponsor of the operation. Thanks dad for all your support.
[29:21.120 --> 29:30.120]  That's why info wars life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula, the new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation.

[30:08.120 --> 30:19.120]  He gives 57 year old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated and then died.
[30:19.120 --> 30:26.120]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report I said watch it'll be innovation, you know what's going to happen.
[30:26.120 --> 30:31.120]  It's a blue city, same story yet again, and they say her heart gave out.
[30:31.120 --> 30:39.120]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record when everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed.
[30:39.120 --> 30:49.120]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states? It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response.
[30:49.120 --> 30:59.120]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it will kill you, but all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[30:59.120 --> 31:03.120]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading.
[31:03.120 --> 31:32.120]  Don't end up like Vicki Gibbs or everyone.
[31:32.120 --> 31:42.120]  Remember this broadcast only exists because of your support, your word of mouth, and your prayers.
[31:42.120 --> 31:45.120]  Thank you again for joining us. I am Alex Jones, your host.
[31:45.120 --> 31:54.120]  All right. This is a very complex issue if you get into all the minutiae.
[31:54.120 --> 31:57.120]  And I've studied the minutiae in depth.
[31:57.120 --> 32:02.120]  I've had the top experts on over the years. You've heard them. And you're your own experts on this.
[32:02.120 --> 32:10.120]  But there is a consensus in the Trump White House and with Larry Kudlow and there's a consensus here in Info Wars.
[32:10.120 --> 32:15.120]  And I tend to open the phones up and have you call in if you disagree or agree.
[32:15.120 --> 32:23.120]  But here's the final equation. Here's the bottom line.
[32:23.120 --> 32:31.120]  You got an old cow you really like and you're not ever going to send it off to get it butchered.
[32:31.120 --> 32:40.120]  But one day it wanders out into the road and gets hit by an 18-wheeler and it breaks its neck.
[32:40.120 --> 32:49.120]  You might as well grab it, drag it over the barn with a tractor, cut it up, and feed it to your dogs as dog food or eat it yourself.
[32:49.120 --> 32:55.120]  And that's really the thinking here. And that's kind of a crude analogy that just popped in my head.
[32:55.120 --> 32:58.120]  There's much better allegories you can come up with.
[32:58.120 --> 33:05.120]  But my dad's dad would actually get attached to certain cows and would never sell them.
[33:05.120 --> 33:10.120]  And then the joke was, by the time he died of cancer, he had a whole herd of cows and wouldn't sell any of them.
[33:10.120 --> 33:13.120]  And they come over and eat pedum and stuff. We feed them range cubes.
[33:13.120 --> 33:24.120]  Let me just pull back here for a minute.
[33:24.120 --> 33:35.120]  You know, if I just rattle off stuff, it doesn't really have an effect, does it?
[33:35.120 --> 33:43.120]  No, it doesn't.
[33:43.120 --> 33:45.120]  I don't know what to say anymore.
[33:45.120 --> 33:59.120]  You know, the public is so ignorant about how the world works that these criminals can pull off these things against us
[33:59.120 --> 34:16.120]  and then we're unable to even respond to it because the public doesn't even understand the basics of how the economy, how finance, how markets work.
[34:16.120 --> 34:25.120]  We're witnessing a devastating planetary takeover right now by the most nasty people you can imagine.
[34:25.120 --> 34:36.120]  And the fact that they've got every major channel out there, not just here, but all over the world, saying America's over, America sucks, America's demoralized, the dollar's going to plunge,
[34:36.120 --> 34:42.120]  the U.S. won't even be a co-superpower to China. It will descend into civil war.
[34:42.120 --> 34:53.120]  And to know that that's their plan and the average American isn't 100% behind the president trying to stop it is nauseating.
[34:53.120 --> 35:04.120]  It's like you're flying in an airplane and one pilot has a heart attack and dies and the other pilot knows how to land the plane and crazy people on board want to kill the pilot.
[35:04.120 --> 35:11.120]  Or you're in a life raft and there's crazy people on board that are trying to punch holes in it while sharks are swimming around you.
[35:11.120 --> 35:20.120]  All because they've been taught it's cute, it's fun, it's fashionable to plunge the dollar, to burn down the police station, to destroy the country.
[35:20.120 --> 35:24.120]  And it's so dangerous.
[35:24.120 --> 35:32.120]  So I'm going to start over next segment because I'm going to need that map on the wall I've been asking for of their fake COVID system.
[35:32.120 --> 35:34.120]  But we'll do it next segment.
[35:34.120 --> 35:41.120]  Now, I may just have to leave today. This is not drama stuff.
[35:41.120 --> 35:48.120]  In fact, I'm going off air. This conference is done. I mean, seriously.
[35:48.120 --> 35:56.120]  Wow. Unbelievable. Let's go ahead and go to this special report.
[35:56.120 --> 36:10.120]  We'll see what happens. I'm going to have to push back other graphs I have for next time because I got to do this whole graph on COVID-19 here that I needed.
[36:10.120 --> 36:13.120]  Let's play clip 14. Thanks.
[36:13.120 --> 36:23.120]  And then after that, whatever you like.
[36:23.120 --> 36:36.120]  We learned that Mueller and the Clintons and all of them were involved suppressing information about themselves and how they were running these child molesting blackmail rings.
[36:36.120 --> 36:43.120]  That was being managed by the Clinton Obama era FBI at the top.
[36:43.120 --> 36:51.120]  And we also in the documents learned that they tried to have the FBI implicate Donald John Trump.
[36:51.120 --> 37:03.120]  Because as we've told you years ago, he was a confidential informant to the FBI in Palm Beach saying that the word is Epstein is engaged in criminal activity with underage girls.
[37:03.120 --> 37:10.120]  He was a fixture in Palm Beach. I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years.
[37:10.120 --> 37:21.120]  Epstein was actually banned from Mar-a-Lago according to court documents obtained by Inside Edition after Epstein was accused of sexually assaulting an underage girl at the club.
[37:21.120 --> 37:27.120]  Everybody knows Donald Trump doesn't like little girls. Donald Trump likes intimidating bombshell females.
[37:27.120 --> 37:34.120]  But these pedophiles, they want to suck the energy off these little girls, little boys. They want to be creepy.
[37:34.120 --> 37:43.120]  Weinstein's really gross. He likes to have underage girls clean, reportedly like skin growths under his belly and he has a vagina as well, reportedly.
[37:43.120 --> 37:54.120]  He's an aphrodite. I mean, if you imagine all of this, he makes 15-year-old girls start throwing up when he's all stinking and gross.
[37:54.120 --> 38:01.120]  And they have to go like pat on him and everything. And it's the same thing with Jeffrey Epstein. He has sexually deformed genitals.
[38:01.120 --> 38:09.120]  Is it true, sir, that you have what's been described as an egg-shaped penis?
[38:09.120 --> 38:20.120]  Epstein took my sexual innocence in front of a wall of framed photographs of him shaking hands and smiling at celebrities and political leaders.
[38:20.120 --> 38:23.120]  I was only 15 years old.
[38:23.120 --> 38:30.120]  You don't get in the globalist club unless you're really screwed up. They're fallen. They're diseased. They're inbred globalists.
[38:30.120 --> 38:36.120]  And that's why they don't like those of us that aren't. And why they want to make us twisted and fallen and ugly like them.
[38:36.120 --> 38:45.120]  Yet the British royalty all inbred as well. So it's all a bunch of inbred, hunchbacked demons who get all the power because they want the power.
[38:45.120 --> 38:47.120]  Because they don't have the power.
[38:47.120 --> 38:55.120]  Within hours of Jeffrey Epstein's apparent suicide, President Trump was retweeting a conspiracy theory linking Bill Clinton to his death.
[38:55.120 --> 38:59.120]  It was immediately picked up by Russian state media going viral.
[38:59.120 --> 39:03.120]  A Clinton spokesperson calling the tweet ridiculous and of course not true.
[39:03.120 --> 39:09.120]  Got a lot of problems coming up in my opinion with the famous island with Jeffrey Epstein. A lot of problems.
[39:09.120 --> 39:10.120]  You think it was over the line?
[39:10.120 --> 39:12.120]  I don't know because I don't know her, but it was nasty.
[39:12.120 --> 39:16.120]  You raised the question of Jeffrey Epstein in your remarks about a new Q&A.
[39:16.120 --> 39:21.120]  Well, you got a problem. I don't know, but that island was really a cesspool.
[39:21.120 --> 39:25.120]  There's no question about it. Just ask Prince Andrew. He'll tell you about it.
[39:25.120 --> 39:32.120]  I really like how Trump's attacking now. Don't wait until October. Attack. Launch everything now.
[39:32.120 --> 39:38.120]  Maxwell is in prison and so a lot of people want to know if she's going to turn in powerful people.
[39:38.120 --> 39:42.120]  Do you feel that she's going to turn in powerful men? How do you see that working out?
[39:42.120 --> 39:45.120]  I don't know. I haven't really been following it too much. I just wish her well.
[39:45.120 --> 39:50.120]  He said he wishes Gisling Maxwell well. You really don't want Trump wishing you well.
[39:50.120 --> 39:55.120]  When Trump starts wishing you well, you should feel a little angel of death flapping above you.
[39:57.120 --> 40:00.120]  All right, folks. Again, I'm not throwing a temper tantrum here.
[40:00.120 --> 40:09.120]  I am physically sick of looking at Fauci and Berks and Hillary and Biden in the New World Order and all their criminal activity
[40:09.120 --> 40:15.120]  and how they admit they're closing a tourniquet around our neck and how we'll never come out of lockdown
[40:15.120 --> 40:19.120]  and how they're going to put implantable chips in us. I'm seriously pissed.
[40:19.120 --> 40:24.120]  And now they've shut down parks all over Austin and say they've got to get registered and be COVID-tracked to do it.
[40:24.120 --> 40:30.120]  They're coming to our houses next. That's it, man. I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[40:30.120 --> 40:33.120]  That's it. It's time for serious civil disobedience.
[40:33.120 --> 40:37.120]  We should just open the phones out about what we should do with plans and I'm doing it today.
[40:37.120 --> 40:43.120]  I'm done. I'm done, man. I'm done. You people want a damn war, you're going to get one.
[40:43.120 --> 40:47.120]  I'm not going to sit here while you chain us up and then have your way with us.
[40:47.120 --> 40:50.120]  You globalist enemies, you pieces of criminal filth.
[40:50.120 --> 40:54.120]  You see, used to I let myself blow up on air and said I'm going to do it off air.
[40:54.120 --> 40:58.120]  No, I'm going to do it on air and then I'm going to do it physically out the streets.
[40:58.120 --> 41:05.120]  You murderer. You Bill Gates. You murder. Bill Gates, you're going to burn.
[41:05.120 --> 41:12.120]  It's finally here. Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.

[42:29.120 --> 42:34.120]  So, they claim for COVID, but of course it's really the Chinese Communist Social Score rollout.
[42:34.120 --> 42:42.120]  These people are sick, filthy criminals and they want total control over society with the official global ID system.
[42:42.120 --> 42:45.120]  That's why it's called the Clinton Global Initiative.
[42:45.120 --> 42:49.120]  But you can fight back with the privacy pockets at InfowarsStore.com.
[42:49.120 --> 43:00.120]  Little Faraday cages, little envelopes, put your phone in it and these dirty scumbag fascist pieces of garbage can't get all that data and rape you with that data.

[43:07.120 --> 43:17.120]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[43:17.120 --> 43:22.120]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[43:22.120 --> 43:33.120]  Super male vitality, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.

[43:50.120 --> 43:57.120]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[43:57.120 --> 44:00.120]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the InfowarsStore.
[44:00.120 --> 44:03.120]  Never been a better time than right now.
[44:03.120 --> 44:07.120]  Super male vitality at InfowarsStore.com.
[44:07.120 --> 44:16.120]  Human freedom. The Wild Wild West. The Renaissance. America.
[44:16.120 --> 44:26.120]  Human liberty. The West built all the freedom, all the choices, all the empowerment we see.
[44:26.120 --> 44:32.120]  The general population has been programmed that submission to tyranny brings them prosperity.
[44:32.120 --> 44:45.120]  Because the last 50 years under psychotic globalist control, they have taught us by successive approximation to bow down and each time be given a reward, a treat.
[44:45.120 --> 44:54.120]  But that's like training wild pigs to come eat out of your hand and finally one day you lead them into the barn and close the door and butcher them.
[44:54.120 --> 45:07.120]  We're now reaching that point in societal development where submission is death, where submission is the human species being destroyed forever on the altar of Satan.
[45:24.120 --> 45:47.120]  Every time we feel overwhelmed by the scientific terror that the New World Order are launching against us, remember, they want to be God, but they're not God.
[45:47.120 --> 45:54.120]  And their plans will always end up being destroyed in the end, but we the faithful have to go through it. That's part of the test.
[45:54.120 --> 46:05.120]  And so pray to God for guidance, pray for God for protection, but also pray for God for the strength and the will to be leaders and to stand against this.
[46:05.120 --> 46:13.120]  Last night this morning and getting in here to the office doing research for the show, I physically got angry and I've been trying to control it.
[46:13.120 --> 46:30.120]  But you know, it's normal to get angry when a group of multinational banks that have created the debt bubble are artificially putting us in to a collapse mode to have a global reset, which they will then blame on COVID-19 that they themselves released.
[46:30.120 --> 46:41.120]  COVID-19 isn't causing the global depression and the global reset out of which the new global casual society is openly emerging, exploding on the scene.
[46:41.120 --> 46:48.120]  COVID-19 hysteria is the well thought out Rockefeller Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation plans that are public.
[46:48.120 --> 46:57.120]  That's what's so incredible for the emergence of what they've already beta tested in communist China and across the Western world.
[46:57.120 --> 47:06.120]  And so when you read headlines like mass starvation, millions dying because of COVID, COVID didn't kill them, the lockdown did.
[47:06.120 --> 47:15.120]  COVID causing mass suicides, no, the lockdown caused mass suicides, and that's all a fact.
[47:15.120 --> 47:19.120]  A fact they over blew the death numbers 25 times what they said it'd be.
[47:19.120 --> 47:24.120]  A fact they use death numbers for all these other people that died of other things, even in the little shrunken number.
[47:24.120 --> 47:30.120]  It's fake upon fake upon fake, just like the fiat currencies they put out.
[47:30.120 --> 47:32.120]  So let me break this down.
[47:32.120 --> 47:45.120]  It is very one dimensional of these different so called conservative media pundits financial experts that go out and say America is going down, the dollar is dead.
[47:45.120 --> 47:46.120]  It's all over.
[47:46.120 --> 47:48.120]  Trump's done a terrible job.
[47:48.120 --> 47:50.120]  The stimulus packages were the wrong thing to do.
[47:50.120 --> 47:52.120]  The dollar is going down.
[47:52.120 --> 48:01.120]  It's over because we already inflated the currency past the point of return before Trump got in.
[48:01.120 --> 48:07.120]  We already had hundreds of trillions of dollars of fake debt globally that the new old order had signed us on to.
[48:07.120 --> 48:09.120]  They'd already done it.
[48:09.120 --> 48:11.120]  They were looking for the reset.
[48:11.120 --> 48:13.120]  They were going to have the bio release.
[48:13.120 --> 48:14.120]  They were going to have COVID-19.
[48:14.120 --> 48:16.120]  They were going to have the reset under Hillary.
[48:16.120 --> 48:18.120]  They now admit that.
[48:18.120 --> 48:29.120]  They admit it's a drill to blame the collapse and the starvation and the civil unrest and the death on the COVID while they come out in every financial publication and say the dollar is dead.
[48:29.120 --> 48:31.120]  America is over.
[48:31.120 --> 48:39.120]  Whoever ends up with the EU over inflating its currency, the communist Chinese over inflating their currency, they're all doing it.
[48:39.120 --> 48:54.120]  Whoever ends up with the dominant global currency who can flood the world with the most of their currency, who can be on top when it all goes down, will be in charge like after World War II and Bretton Woods for another 70, 80 years.
[48:54.120 --> 48:56.120]  And you can say it's a corrupt system.
[48:56.120 --> 48:57.120]  You can say it's fiat.
[48:57.120 --> 49:07.120]  The very Federal Reserve that set it up is getting rid of our hegemonic power now to give it to the chai comms and themselves completely.
[49:07.120 --> 49:09.120]  They're done with us.
[49:09.120 --> 49:12.120]  Like Darth Sidious done with Count Dooku.
[49:12.120 --> 49:15.120]  We're being flushed down the toilet.
[49:15.120 --> 49:25.120]  And then America will completely collapse into hell on earth, the likes of which you've never seen and they've already built the fire and lit the match.
[49:25.120 --> 49:36.120]  Oh, race war did it and COVID did it and America's systemic problems and America's done and America's finished and America's rotten and America was never good and America was never great.
[49:36.120 --> 49:37.120]  It'll never be great.
[49:37.120 --> 49:45.120]  And all the headlines about the eagles of the country and how it just was, you know, 248 years old and it's over and it's gone.
[49:45.120 --> 49:55.120]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times, LA Times, Washington Post, Newsweek, Time Magazine, Austin American Statesman, CBS News, NBC News, ABC News, we're done.
[49:55.120 --> 49:59.120]  We're over. We suck. We're terrible.
[49:59.120 --> 50:07.120]  That's globalist multinational corporations, the chai comms, the EU, Hollywood, all of it about to bring us down.
[50:07.120 --> 50:17.120]  They make us into massive, total, complete debt that we never emerged from again. And now COVID tracking on our phones that really track us in lifetime.
[50:17.120 --> 50:22.120]  And they admit even in the Wall Street Journal, everything you do is put in a secret credit score.
[50:22.120 --> 50:28.120]  What porn you visit, who you talk to, what you do, what you eat, what you drink, and they share it all illegally.
[50:28.120 --> 50:42.120]  And this is their coming out where you've got to sign up to go to the park or to leave your house and all these idiots wear their mask and get into it like their heroes because they're a bunch of lazy smucks that let us get into this position to begin with.
[50:42.120 --> 50:49.120]  And now they want to take us down with them all the way.
[50:49.120 --> 50:52.120]  So that's it.
[50:52.120 --> 50:58.120]  They're economically imploding us. They're culturally imploding us. They're spiritually imploding us.
[50:58.120 --> 51:08.120]  COVID House of Cards collapsing. Fauci called out over vaccine royalties. He didn't just lie about everything.
[51:08.120 --> 51:16.120]  He didn't just run the Wuhan lab, basically. He makes the money off of it with who? Bill and Melinda Gates.
[51:16.120 --> 51:29.120]  But you hear, oh, Bill Gates is a philanthropist. His money went tax-free 30 years ago, and he's quintupled it since then, just what we know of.
[51:29.120 --> 51:43.120]  Same thing with Warren Buffett, because the money is meant to be used in an alternate global government to carry out depopulation because they've taken the world over by fiat fraud a trillion times bigger than Bernie Madoff.
[51:43.120 --> 51:49.120]  So imagine if Bernie Madoff controlled governments and armies and militaries and national health services.
[51:49.120 --> 51:58.120]  When he was getting ready to bring his Ponzi scheme down, he would just release a bio weapon and use that as the cover for the whole new digital system,
[51:58.120 --> 52:10.120]  where your planetary medical tracking code on your phone or in a chip in your skin or in a bracelet or a face scan or a thumbprint is tied to everything you do in your job
[52:10.120 --> 52:21.120]  and where your digital money is put in if you perform the task, not just of your job, but socially, how you're supposed to behave.
[52:21.120 --> 52:28.120]  Take your eight-year-old son, have his testicles chopped off, $100,000 put in your credit box. They're talking about this.
[52:28.120 --> 52:37.120]  You decide to commit euthanasia at a certain point in five years to lower the carbon footprint of the earth. You'll be a hero, a million credits.
[52:37.120 --> 52:43.120]  This is their plan. This isn't some science fiction dystopia.
[52:43.120 --> 52:49.120]  Because we're like trained seals that for fish will do whatever we're told.
[52:49.120 --> 52:56.120]  Instead of, see, an animal doesn't understand the confines it's in, doesn't understand the false reality.
[52:56.120 --> 53:05.120]  You as a human can change your environment and you can understand that they're putting us into a cage, a false digital environment to make us weak for extermination.
[53:05.120 --> 53:11.120]  Instead, you can overcome it, not support it and begin to sabotage and smash it everywhere.
[53:11.120 --> 53:22.120]  Just like the globalist communist Satanists are smashing local government, police departments, the family, local schools, real infrastructure, anything that empowers people.
[53:22.120 --> 53:27.120]  Because none of that stuff's perfect, but we built it and it was good overall.
[53:27.120 --> 53:34.120]  It's being removed where there's no economy but the New World Order.
[53:34.120 --> 53:39.120]  Where all of the district attorneys are appointed by Soros in the New World Order.
[53:39.120 --> 53:47.120]  That's how they legalize pedophilia. That's how they legalize open Satanism because they are the law, they are the man.
[53:47.120 --> 54:00.120]  And they're just muscling in on the officers themselves to kill whatever pro-America culture was left there to break their will, run off the good guys and open the slots for their bad guys to go in so the real reign of terror starts.
[54:00.120 --> 54:10.120]  And if they're successful in those phases and we're actually having to fight the security apparatus of the Satanic New World Order, oh, we'll be the biggest criminals on earth fighting the police.
[54:10.120 --> 54:21.120]  Because they won't be the police then, they'll be the Stasi, they'll be the NKVD, they'll be the Gestapo, they'll be the sword of Satan.
[54:21.120 --> 54:27.120]  And so the globalists are fighting over the security apparatus.
[54:27.120 --> 54:36.120]  Oh, they got good people to go along with the security apparatus. It violates our rights for the bitter good because, you know, the good guys were in control of it and that's how we stop the bad guys.
[54:36.120 --> 54:54.120]  But notice now, the bad guys are almost in total control of a worldwide panopticon surveillance system, the likes of which Hitler couldn't even dream of and were inches away from falling under the control of these individuals and the system that's in place to be able to go to the park
[54:54.120 --> 55:04.120]  or go have a job or leave your house. And then, of course, if you can't leave your house, you're going to lose your house and you're going to be homeless.
[55:04.120 --> 55:12.120]  But if you're not in the right club and you're homeless, a group of vigilantes are going to come back as the police have been defunded and they're going to kill you.
[55:12.120 --> 55:19.120]  Because how they enforce the policing now is you do what the globalists want, you get credits. You don't do what they want, you get nothing.
[55:19.120 --> 55:24.120]  It doesn't matter what you own, what you had, what you did, it's going to be taken away from you.
[55:24.120 --> 55:28.120]  You're going to live in a modern globalist prison, the likes of which the planet's never seen.
[55:28.120 --> 55:36.120]  The dystopia that we are entering is nothing like anyone has ever dreamed of.
[55:36.120 --> 55:45.120]  And the police all over the world in most areas are serving the New World Order and are proving themselves good Satanists.
[55:45.120 --> 55:52.120]  So we're caught between the globalists and the communists and the police and the constabulary. It's groveling and saying, be nice to me.
[55:52.120 --> 56:17.120]  I'll get on my knees, I'll get on my belly, I'll arrest people for no mask.
[56:17.120 --> 56:24.120]  Gentlemen, they are putting this in every newspaper in the country and legitimizing the fact that if he can test the election in any way,
[56:24.120 --> 56:31.120]  when they say by default they are, that they're going to pull this. This is maximum, maximum alert. This is emergency alert.
[56:31.120 --> 56:36.120]  Yes, they've censored the Patriots off most of the Internet, but Band-Aught video is still there, the radio show is still there,
[56:36.120 --> 56:40.120]  and yes, we're getting about five times the traffic we were getting before the ban to the actual sites.
[56:40.120 --> 56:48.120]  But we need to get this message to other people outside of our audience. So tell everyone now about the martial law plan and the plan to get rid of Trump.
[56:48.120 --> 56:57.120]  It's all posted at Band-Aught video. Please, we can defeat these people if you take action. You are the answer. Please, please, please.
[56:57.120 --> 57:08.120]  Americans have had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[57:08.120 --> 57:15.120]  We don't appreciate the American way truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long.
[57:15.120 --> 57:25.120]  We just think that's how the rest of the world is. Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity
[57:25.120 --> 57:32.120]  and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented, and that's what made our modern world.
[57:32.120 --> 57:46.120]  We've now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists, who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command even if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[57:46.120 --> 57:55.120]  And that's what COVID-19 is, a global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity and against your future.
[57:55.120 --> 57:57.120]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[57:57.120 --> 58:02.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:02.120 --> 58:31.120]  All right, Jesse Lee Peterson, we've had an interview in years. He's super popular now. He was on Access TV when I was under 25 years ago. We'd air his stuff in Austin. He'd play some of our stuff out in California.
[58:31.120 --> 58:46.120]  He's going to be on air with us coming up in the third hour. I want to open the phones up, though, for a segment three, four and five of this hour for a specific issue.
[58:46.120 --> 58:54.120]  Bill Gates is coming at you with vaccines. They admit don't help you and that hurt almost everybody that take them and that he's going to have liability protection from.
[58:54.120 --> 59:01.120]  He's having bureaucracies and governments put in systems to make you take it to get on an airplane or rent a car or have a job.
[59:01.120 --> 59:09.120]  So he's going to assault you with tyranny and with a deadly vaccine that changes your very DNA. That's assault.
[59:09.120 --> 59:20.120]  If I tried to come to your house with a needle that admittedly a big percentage of the time would really hurt you, you'd have a right if I tried to jab it in me to physically defend yourself.
[59:20.120 --> 59:30.120]  But they're trying to blur the lines of all of that. We have to start discussing the rules of engagement here because this is assault. This is criminal. This is wrong.
[59:30.120 --> 59:40.120]  So here's the number to join us. 877-789-2539. 877-789-2539. And seriously, folks, we'll take like 10 calls. It's on that subject.
[59:40.120 --> 59:49.120]  What do we do about Bill Gates? What's the line of the sand? Or do we just tell him, you're my God, literally bend over and say, give me any shots you want and have convulsions while he smiles at you and you die?
[59:49.120 --> 59:59.120]  I mean, do we just submit to him and is he a God? And so he's our doctor that we can't say no to. He's our master. 877-789-2539.
[59:59.120 --> 1:00:04.120]  But here's while they abandon Alex Jones. This video is three years old. Here it is.
[1:00:04.120 --> 1:00:20.120]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas and U.S. resistance against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China ally with the big mega banks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:28.120]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure. The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood. The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities. This is all confirmed. This is not a drill.
[1:00:28.120 --> 1:00:40.120]  Check in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government. They've officially become state run. Apple 100%. Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[1:00:40.120 --> 1:00:51.120]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man. A demonized version of Alex Jones to do that. This is happening. This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship.
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:01:00.120]  Thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it. Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:13.120]  This is a tight traded dose reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation. In layman's terms they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[1:01:13.120 --> 1:01:27.120]  We adapt to being crushed with the low dosages of oppression. Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:44.120]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system. It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traders inside the major security agencies blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:54.120]  of the chai con slash big tech making combine emergency situation. I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering ramming it out as much as I can.
[1:01:54.120 --> 1:02:08.120]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us. So they take what I've said being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:21.120]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars and so they make me a murder of children and then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:34.120]  So even if I didn't sell out to them they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction. I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:46.120]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm. I have given you the transmission now break free.
[1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:56.120]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:03:05.120]  Thomas Jefferson. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:27.120]  The historical food is again available for shipping within three to four weeks. We have it. It's high quality, but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you. Some items are shipping in a week, some in four weeks. So they're staying three to four weeks. It's my patriot.
[1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:40.120]  Believe me, every angle I've looked at tells me that really, really serious times are ahead, whether Trump wins or loses. The globalists have already created a worldwide depression lock down to the planetary scale and it's only intensifying.
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:52.120]  This is one of the big boxes. You've got to get checked off. It's high quality, affordable food. My patriot has really good high quality food at a very affordable price and the packaging is the best you're going to find out there.
[1:03:52.120 --> 1:04:02.120]  Check it out for yourself at infowarstore.com and then the money that comes in that's extra helps us fund the information warfare operation that fights the globalist toe-to-toe.
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:24.120]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak. We think just let me think.
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:34.120]  Words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciation of the truth.
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:39.120]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:42.120]  You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You told me every television end longer.
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:50.120]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and depression. And where once you had the freedom to object, everything can speak as you saw fit.
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:57.120]  You now have sensors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and submitting your submachine.
[1:04:57.120 --> 1:05:05.120]  How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others. They will be held accountable.
[1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:11.120]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:25.120]  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror and disease? There were a myriad of problems which inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:34.120]  Fear got the best of you. And in your panic, you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Suttler. He promised you order. He promised you peace.
[1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:45.120]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[1:05:45.120 --> 1:06:14.120]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come. We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[1:06:14.120 --> 1:06:29.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. We're here into the second hour right now and we're looking at some of the graphs that came out in March with CDC numbers out of New York.
[1:06:29.120 --> 1:06:44.120]  Heart disease, cancer, accident strokes, Alzheimer's, flu, homicide, etc. were all put in the COVID-19 column and they all reported zero.
[1:06:44.120 --> 1:07:00.120]  No heart attacks, cancer, car accidents, Alzheimer's, flu, murders. Because from mid-March through mid-April, they just took those numbers and put them there.
[1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:14.120]  They were mirroring the year before's numbers and that's how these numbers worked very close year in, year out. But we didn't just want to go off of that.
[1:07:14.120 --> 1:07:29.120]  I hired a well-respected statistician here in Texas. There's an article dealing with it. Scandemic CDC stats show flu deaths dropped as COVID deaths increased.
[1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:40.120]  You see the numbers and you can click on those and go to the CDC and their own numbers that remember are also cooked inflating deaths.
[1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:47.120]  There's a lot of scams but these are their own numbers proving they're fraud. It's just even deeper than we can show you.
[1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:58.120]  Let's go ahead and go through some of these. Let's go to the new numbers from May and June and July and now going into August.
[1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:12.120]  Here's numbers for Arizona and you can see how they just say there's no longer any influenza deaths there.
[1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:18.120]  Nobody's dying of flu suddenly. They tell you, oh, we don't know why. Worldwide nobody's dying of flu. Must be wearing a mask.
[1:08:18.120 --> 1:08:23.120]  No, they just take the numbers. They don't count deaths as flu now. By the way, you read, they admit that's what they're doing.
[1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:34.120]  But there's the numbers. There's the graphs and they add it to the COVID-19. And notice how in graph after graph, as we go through U.S. states and other countries, it's the same thing.
[1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:39.120]  They almost mirror each other because it's fraudulent, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:45.120]  Now again, all of this is admitted that people that dive gunshot wounds are counted in skydiving accidents and cancer and the flu.
[1:08:45.120 --> 1:09:01.120]  But here it is state by state to see it. Here's a side by side with influenza deaths in Arizona, pneumonia deaths in Arizona, COVID-19 multiple causes of death, Arizona.
[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:14.120]  And you see how suddenly it all spikes when they flip that switch. And this really happened in May because they decided to start counting 15 people for every person that had COVID.
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:21.120]  They were going to count 15 people. They surmised have it. And that's why you see the skyrocketing numbers.
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:37.120]  Here's California. Just like the last graph you saw out of Arizona, influenza deaths suddenly completely end as the year starts.
[1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:48.120]  And then what happens? COVID deaths. And look at that. It almost matches because they simply moved the numbers over.
[1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:56.120]  Skipping ahead a few graphs. Let's look at Florida. Flu and COVID in Florida.
[1:09:56.120 --> 1:10:08.120]  And look how the flu during this peak time, during the year, suddenly completely drops and COVID shoots straight up.
[1:10:08.120 --> 1:10:17.120]  And it's the same thing over and over. Let's look at Texas. Let's skip a few graphs ahead.
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:24.120]  By the way, I was just sent more by the statistician around the world and around the U.S. and it's even more detailed than we thought.
[1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:29.120]  So we're drilling into it. It's a lot to absorb. I'm trying to get the statistician to come on air.
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:35.120]  We've used him before. He's well known. And he's gotten a lot of heat when he said who he was.
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:40.120]  You see how they fire all these doctors or take their YouTubes away when they speak out?
[1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:51.120]  Because science is under attack. They say, trust the science. Well, here's CDC's own numbers. And here's Texas.
[1:10:51.120 --> 1:11:04.120]  Underlying cause of death. No influenza deaths now because you've got to take that mountain range of flu death and you've now got to attribute it to that.
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:10.120]  The truth is they always exaggerate flu as well. Most of us just really old people who die old age. Their heart gives out whatever.
[1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:14.120]  They don't want to do an autopsy. They die a nursing home. They die under the knife at a hospital.
[1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:21.120]  They just say, oh, they didn't die from the surgery. They didn't die from the anesthesia. They died from flu.
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:27.120]  So now we don't hear about the fake 30,000 deaths of flu in the U.S. It's probably really like 5,000 every year.
[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:34.120]  Now it's attributed those fake deaths, those deaths for other things, to COVID. So they've been running this trick for a long time.
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:40.120]  Now, let me tell you from my own personal experience looking at statistics. What's really going on here?
[1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:46.120]  I know most people in my family who've died have died of pneumonia.
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:51.120]  My grandmother died of a lung infection at 92 a few years ago.
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:55.120]  My other grandmother from complications with her lungs.
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:12:00.120]  My great uncle, my uncle, my cousin, all of the last 10 years all died.
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:03.120]  I can keep talking about friends and family that died of pneumonia.
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:12.120]  The truth is, every fall and winter, the hospitals are filled with people dying of lung problems.
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:20.120]  And because of particular in the major studies and because of all these new viruses and things, pneumonia is getting worse and the drugs aren't working.
[1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:24.120]  So let me explain something. COVID-19 is real.
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:35.120]  And that there has been an underlying surge in new lung diseases and lung viruses across the world.
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:39.120]  The atmosphere has been manipulated. There is particularly in it.
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:47.120]  There are all these new viruses and almost all of them, swine flu, bird flu, SARS, COVID-19 come out of China.
[1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:55.120]  That's because it's so dirty, so cramped, so debilitated, such bad nutrition that just like a preschool, it's an incubator for disease.
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:13:01.120]  So there is major death from lung-borne diseases. My God.
[1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:04.120]  2019 is the latest numbers we have. Look it up.
[1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:15.120]  1.4 million people, 1.4 million people died in the United States from tuberculosis.
[1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:21.120]  And the number is set to be even higher because it's drug-resistant, people can't get treatment.
[1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:24.120]  They're dying and people are coming in across the border and aren't even being tested.
[1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:30.120]  And they're putting little kids in school with your kids and not even treating the little kids that are sick or your kids.
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:36.120]  They care if whether they were behind pain-linked fences when they came in at a facility being checked.
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:40.120]  That's why they said, okay, we won't even check them for medical problems anymore. We don't want to be racist.
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:45.120]  See, the globalists love disease. They love depopulation.
[1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:51.120]  And the numbers all show that. Influenza death's 12-week number goes down to almost zero COVID skyrockets.
[1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:56.120]  It's the same in every state, ladies and gentlemen, because they follow the United Nations edict.
[1:13:56.120 --> 1:14:03.120]  Then the CDC and NIH follow that because the doctors don't want to get in trouble. It's false policy. It's fraud.
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:10.120]  This is a Corona crisis self-reliance alert. If you're worried about the power grid and the current crisis
[1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:16.120]  and want to generate your own supply of off-the-grid electrical power, just in case, pay close attention.
[1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:22.120]  Here's why. A limited supply of solar backup generators will be available again in the next two weeks.
[1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:28.120]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical backup power when you get off the grid.
[1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:37.120]  Unlike gas generators, these solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:47.120]  Dangerous weather, social unrest, or overloaded grids this summer will not be a problem if you go to mysolarbackup.com and get your solar backup generator.
[1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:52.120]  We regret that supplies are limited and only available on a first-come, first-served basis.
[1:14:52.120 --> 1:15:03.120]  Check availability at mysolarbackup.com. Never suffer painful power outages again. Go to mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:15:22.120 --> 1:15:33.120]  Vegetables actually taste better. The name of the product is protogrow, a proprietary blend of bioactive superfoods for plants designed to produce rapid plant growth in record time,
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:39.120]  so much so that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:49.120]  It does this by combining powerful trace elements and micronutrients from seaweed extracts with a balanced blend of macronutrients from cold water fish.
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:56.120]  The result? Vegetables grow faster than ever because they now have the essential bioavailable nutrients they need.

[1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:23.120]  Imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020, the Democrats, as well as many Republican leaders will be calling for the United Nations WHO edict that all Americans wear masks be a, quote, federal order and mandate.
[1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:31.120]  Totally unconstitutional, annihilating states' rights. Think about that. A woman can kill her baby.
[1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:42.120]  You pay for illegal aliens' health care, but you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20-plus times less than what they said, even if you believe the official story.
[1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:51.120]  This is about the WHO. The globe was testing their power through the media, over the federal government, to set policy in the United States.
[1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:56.120]  This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the Paris Accord and all of it.
[1:16:56.120 --> 1:17:04.120]  And by the way, they admit that. They say, now your carbon's down, one way or another, you stupid Americans.
[1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:09.120]  There are a few reasons that the globalist launched this planetary lockdown.
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:17.120]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes. We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:30.120]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation. But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential.
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:39.120]  As we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:49.120]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into. It's been pre-planned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[1:17:49.120 --> 1:18:01.120]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:05.120]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:10.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:42.120]  How did it happen? Was it suicide? Was he killed? And I do wish you well. I'm not looking for anything bad for her. I'm not looking bad for anybody.
[1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:55.120]  And they took that and they said, such a big deal. But all it is, is her boyfriend died. He died in jail. Was he killed? Was it suicide? I do. I wish you well.
[1:18:55.120 --> 1:18:58.120]  Jeffrey Epstein in your remarks about the Q&A.
[1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:07.120]  He's got a problem. I don't know. But that island was really a cesspool. There's no question about it. Just ask Prince Andrew. He'll tell you about it.
[1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:14.120]  The island was an absolute cesspool. And he's been there for many times. Well, I can't say friends, but I know...
[1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:15.120]  You're friendly. You know them.
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:18.120]  They play at my clubs a lot. I have clubs and everybody likes to play at my clubs.
[1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:21.120]  Are you saying there's a political problem for her if she runs for president?
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:30.120]  It could be a political problem. Look, he could be a political problem. Right now, he's Teflon and right now, maybe not. But he could end up being a political problem.
[1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:41.120]  Bill Clinton. Nice guy. Got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island with Jeffrey Epstein. A lot of problems.
[1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:49.120]  So, there you go. They've made a big deal about him saying, oh, he wishes her well. Just like he wishes he's easy to ping well. He doesn't want her to die in jail.
[1:19:49.120 --> 1:20:01.120]  He's been very clear about that. There's no implication that Trump's connected to Epstein, but the media has pushed that continually while ignoring Bill Clinton on the flight manifest and all the witnesses.
[1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:14.120]  But shifting gears, and then we'll go to your phone calls back into COVID-19 and that whole fraud, pharmacies are refusing to fill HCQ prescriptions now.
[1:20:14.120 --> 1:20:18.120]  Because Dr. Gates says you're not allowed to have it here at this.
[1:20:18.120 --> 1:20:25.120]  Hey, everyone. I'm here at Morris Medical Center with my dad, Dr. Darryl R. Morris, the second DO.
[1:20:25.120 --> 1:20:31.120]  He has some things he would like to share and bring attention to in regards to how politics is affecting the medical world right now.
[1:20:31.120 --> 1:20:39.120]  Yesterday and the day before, there were many doctors who had press conference in Washington, DC about their successful treatment of the virus.
[1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:53.120]  One particularly is treated over 300 patients in the Houston area with diabetes, hypertension and COVID positive, and with massive success, treating with hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and the protocol with Zithromax,
[1:20:53.120 --> 1:21:06.120]  which is having good success in many practices across the country. But physicians are being shouted down and the media is not carrying it because it's not the mantra of what turns out to be the left media.
[1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:20.120]  It is clearly a hit on trying to hit on the president here. And those videos showing those physicians who were having successful treatment with that protocol has now been deleted from Twitter and Facebook,
[1:21:20.120 --> 1:21:30.120]  which you all probably know are left-leaning organizations. And that's just censorship and restricting the information flow in the United States.
[1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:40.120]  In our practice, I've written that same protocol for many of my patients that are at risk and the local pharmacies have refused to fill my prescription.
[1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:50.120]  I've had many patients on hydroxychloroquine for many years because I also treat lupus and for 20-plus years even on that medication with no side effects, no trouble whatsoever.
[1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:53.120]  You guys saved my life and you know you did.
[1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:58.120]  Dr. Anthony Fauci has said studies show the drug is ineffective at treating COVID.
[1:21:58.120 --> 1:22:11.120]  There's no reason to not utilize that protocol if it's indicated and not letting that information freely flow and refusing to utilize those protocols which are having success in other practices is just criminal.
[1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:17.120]  That clip enraged them.
[1:22:17.120 --> 1:22:37.120]  We learned that Mueller and the Clintons and all of them were involved suppressing information about themselves and how they were running these child molesting blackmail rings that was being managed by the Clinton Obama-era FBI at the top.
[1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:57.120]  And we also in the documents learned that they tried to have the FBI implicate Donald John Trump because, as we've told you years ago, he was a confidential informant to the FBI in Palm Beach saying that the word is Epstein is engaged in criminal activity with underage girls.
[1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:04.120]  He was a fixture in Palm Beach. I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years.
[1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:15.120]  Epstein was actually banned from Mar-a-Lago according to court documents obtained by Inside Edition after Epstein was accused of sexually assaulting an underage girl at the club.
[1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:21.120]  Everybody knows Donald Trump doesn't like little girls. Donald Trump likes intimidating bombshell females.
[1:23:21.120 --> 1:23:37.120]  But these pedophiles, they want to suck the energy off these little girls, little boys. They want to be creepy. Weinstein's really gross. He likes to have underage girls clean reportedly like skin growths under his belly and he has a vagina as well, reportedly.
[1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:51.120]  He's an aphrodite. I mean, can you imagine all of this? He makes 15-year-old girls start throwing up when he's all stinking and gross and they have to go pet on him and everything.
[1:23:51.120 --> 1:23:56.120]  And it's the same thing with Jeffrey Epstein. He has sexually deformed genitals.
[1:23:56.120 --> 1:24:04.120]  Is it true, sir, that you have what's been described as an egg-shaped penis?
[1:24:04.120 --> 1:24:17.120]  Epstein took my sexual innocence in front of a wall of framed photographs of him shaking hands and smiling at celebrities and political leaders. I was only 15 years old.
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:27.120]  You don't get in the globalist club unless you're really screwed up. They're fallen. They're diseased. They're inbred globalists. And that's why they don't like those of us that aren't.
[1:24:27.120 --> 1:24:41.120]  And why they want to make us twisted and fallen and ugly like them. Yet the British royalty all inbred as well. So it's all a bunch of inbred, hunchbacked demons who get all the power because they want the power, because they don't have the power.
[1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:53.120]  Within hours of Jeffrey Epstein's apparent suicide, President Trump was retweeting a conspiracy theory linking Bill Clinton to his death. It was immediately picked up by Russian state media going viral.
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:57.120]  A Clinton spokesperson calling the tweet ridiculous and, of course, not true.
[1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:03.120]  I've got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island with Jeffrey Epstein. A lot of problems.
[1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:04.120]  You think it was over the line?
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:06.120]  I don't know because I don't know her, but it was nasty.
[1:25:06.120 --> 1:25:10.120]  You raised the question of Jeffrey Epstein in your remarks about the Q&A.
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:12.120]  I think he's got a problem. I don't think the problem will be.
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:19.120]  I don't know, but that island was really a cesspool. There's no question about it. Just ask Prince Andrew. He'll tell you about it.
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:26.120]  I really like how Trump's attacking now. Don't wait until October. Attack, launch everything now.
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:36.120]  Maxwell is imprisoned, and so a lot of people want to know if she's going to turn in powerful people. Do you feel that she's going to turn in powerful men? How do you see that working out?
[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:40.120]  I don't know. I haven't really been following it too much. I just wish her well.
[1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:44.120]  He said he wishes Gisling Maxwell well. You really don't want Trump wishing you well.
[1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:50.120]  When Trump starts wishing you well, you should be a little angel of death flapping above you.
[1:25:50.120 --> 1:26:19.120]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe.
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:21.120]  You better believe you got one.
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:50.120]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:27:17.120]  The BBC is state-run media in the UK, and they've come out with a detailed article that's linked to an InfoWars.com saying you will have to have forced simulations multiple times a year to be able to travel.
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:27.120]  Robots will scan you when you land. You will have a digital tattoo under your skin to be able to enter the country, but it's going to be so easy and so cool and so fun.
[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:37.120]  The Microsoft website now officially has announced the digital tattoo. We exposed this six months ago, and Bill Gates was funding it, and they had hundreds of news articles attacking it saying it wasn't true.
[1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:48.120]  This is a tactic they used. First they announced it. We say it's a bad idea. They say, that's crazy. We didn't do it. They introduced the idea to you. Then they come back and announce it again, thinking you have no memory.
[1:27:48.120 --> 1:28:02.120]  This is a criminal takeover. This is the line in the sand. We must say no. We must expose the fraud of COVID-19. This entire house of evil is built on. I'm Alex Jones. Never surrender to tyranny. InfoWars.com.
[1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:14.120]  It's been on air in 26 years. Starting about 24 years ago, I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors, producers, actors. They wanted to meet with me, and they said, what is your formal education?
[1:28:14.120 --> 1:28:23.120]  And I said, well, really, nothing but a few years of college. They said, well, how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:33.120]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable. We'd like you to be in movies. We'd like you to write with us. We'd like you to do voiceovers. You're just a renaissance man.
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:42.120]  Folks know I was in some movies, and Harry Shearer made statements like that in a lot of others. I'm not practical. I kept explaining to them. I said, do you understand I had to come up with any of this?
[1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:56.120]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents, and they would just laugh at me and say, oh, no way. Then I would give them the documents. They would get very, very scared the next time I saw them in a few months and say, man, you're right.
[1:28:56.120 --> 1:29:01.120]  This is dystopic. Folks, I didn't make any of this up. OK, it's real. It's real.
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:16.120]  Where the hell did this water come from? Where did it come from? Where did it come from?

[1:30:00.740 --> 1:30:10.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:30:18.740 --> 1:30:23.740]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[1:30:23.740 --> 1:30:30.740]  You know, I decided to just go ahead and get rid of my regular radio microphone the rest of the week. I'm gonna wear this wireless
[1:30:31.740 --> 1:30:38.740]  Because I'm gonna be getting up with charts and guests and I'm gonna be standing on my head figuratively doing a lot of stuff here
[1:30:39.740 --> 1:30:46.740]  Big article up on infowarstore.com. Here's why liberals are buying guns. Guns sales up nearly 135% in July
[1:30:46.740 --> 1:30:54.740]  Matching the nationwide average increase of crime 135% funny how that works and all the liberals I know
[1:30:55.740 --> 1:31:01.740]  That I know personally have come to me and apologized and said look I was an old-fashioned Democrat
[1:31:02.740 --> 1:31:09.740]  I bought into the propaganda. I know they're evil now. No Republicans aren't perfect, but I understand that they're really truly evil and bad and I bought a gun
[1:31:09.740 --> 1:31:15.740]  And these are black people. These are white people. These are Hispanic folks
[1:31:18.740 --> 1:31:20.740]  And they just get it
[1:31:22.740 --> 1:31:25.740]  I'm gonna leave it at that they understand that
[1:31:26.740 --> 1:31:33.740]  Trump is the populist and that this country is under attack and the people trying to take it over do not want to empower people
[1:31:33.740 --> 1:31:35.740]  They want to enslave them
[1:31:35.740 --> 1:31:40.740]  Now I've been particularly wound up today and I've been a jerk behind the scenes, so I apologize the crew on here
[1:31:42.740 --> 1:31:47.740]  But I just got distracted today because I'm just so ready for this show so ready to cover all those
[1:31:48.740 --> 1:31:51.740]  And then my son's up here and Ted Anderson and I'm trying to work with again a great guy
[1:31:52.740 --> 1:31:59.740]  He's here and it's just there's all this stuff unfolding. I'm not complaining. It's just I get why the average person just tunes out politics
[1:31:59.740 --> 1:32:04.740]  As you know, it's corrupt. You know, it's out of control. What are you gonna do about it?
[1:32:04.740 --> 1:32:09.740]  And if you focus on it, it takes your life over like let me tell you I used to love football
[1:32:10.740 --> 1:32:17.740]  Basketball baseball my mom was a basketball fan and football fan, but I grew up with her
[1:32:18.740 --> 1:32:24.740]  Wasn't a big TV person, but when the Celtics were on man, she was in there watching and I'd sit there while you know
[1:32:24.740 --> 1:32:29.740]  She cooked dinner after dinner whatever you're watching the Celtics might have would be offering the book and you know Dallas Cowboys
[1:32:29.740 --> 1:32:36.740]  Every Sunday around the TV with a party at the house and I knew about the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Washington Redskins
[1:32:36.740 --> 1:32:45.740]  And the and the and I knew how much this football player weighed and what he ran the hundred in and I and the last time I got caught up in sports
[1:32:45.740 --> 1:32:53.740]  When the Red Sox went to the World Series and I ended up going down to a bar almost every night with one of my buddies feel my buddies and
[1:32:53.740 --> 1:33:00.740]  Eating food and drinking and having a great time and that was when I actually started drinking more heavily was when the Red Sox with the World Trade
[1:33:00.740 --> 1:33:04.740]  To the World Series not even a huge Red Sox fan was just really good baseball
[1:33:04.740 --> 1:33:14.740]  So I get why people don't want to tune into politics because if you learn about it then you get obsessed with it like sports
[1:33:14.740 --> 1:33:18.740]  But then the people that got obsessed with sports
[1:33:18.740 --> 1:33:24.740]  Now it's become political so you can't even hide there see how it works
[1:33:24.740 --> 1:33:35.740]  With the take of the knee and the Black Lives Matter and the Antifa crap and won't criticize China that's got millions in slave labor camps but America sucks
[1:33:35.740 --> 1:33:40.740]  And so really I get it
[1:33:40.740 --> 1:33:51.740]  There's nothing I want more than to run to some little cabin in the woods and just say screw it let somebody else deal with it and go to town once a week
[1:33:51.740 --> 1:34:00.740]  And just go for hikes with my dogs and my kids and but you know what they're coming to your little cabin in the woods
[1:34:00.740 --> 1:34:10.740]  They're not going to leave anybody alone I think everybody's got that now including me and there's this sick feeling in me now that I'm going to have to do something
[1:34:10.740 --> 1:34:14.740]  Because I've tried to do a lot with information
[1:34:14.740 --> 1:34:22.740]  But the minute they come at you and say you can't have a driver's license or fly on a plane or have a job or go into a store
[1:34:22.740 --> 1:34:32.740]  Unless you take this inoculation that they admit is deadly and that is run by a guy that says he wants to depopulate and he's not a doctor he's not my doctor
[1:34:32.740 --> 1:34:37.740]  So I ask the listeners right now I'm going to take your calls
[1:34:37.740 --> 1:34:51.740]  Bill Gates of the depopulation agenda he represents what do we do about them because finally today this morning my psyche clicked into gear about maybe I can't fix this with information
[1:34:51.740 --> 1:34:57.740]  And then the problem was I'm not somebody trying to be big and mean and powerful
[1:34:57.740 --> 1:35:14.740]  I'm trying to fix things but when that gears finally clicked in the place that gear is just saying you want to kill me and ain't going to happen you're the one that's going to pay
[1:35:14.740 --> 1:35:18.740]  And they know what they're doing because they know they're losing so they're pushing us in this position
[1:35:18.740 --> 1:35:27.740]  We need to be like Jesus and those that copied him Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King we need to not be violent offensively at this point
[1:35:27.740 --> 1:35:36.740]  But we better be active politically, spiritually, economically and culturally really aggressively right now because we're under physical assault
[1:35:36.740 --> 1:35:43.740]  And we're being oppressed and we better start doing civil disobedience
[1:35:43.740 --> 1:35:51.740]  That don't mean burning down the police station or beating up innocent people that means going into places without masks that means going into parks they've closed
[1:35:51.740 --> 1:36:00.740]  That means going to these globalist houses that means filing lawsuits that means get aggressive
[1:36:00.740 --> 1:36:09.740]  I apologize the crew behind the scenes I'm a little bit radioactive today and it's because I am radioactive ladies and gentlemen
[1:36:09.740 --> 1:36:17.740]  Any time I start sweating everybody knows that would be a good rant Jones is on today because it's literally my body starts counting down
[1:36:17.740 --> 1:36:25.740]  And starts making me like think about this and think how I do this and how I do that and it's just like wargaming at all and it's scary folks
[1:36:25.740 --> 1:36:33.740]  But I know you're all doing the same thing and we just really need to try to fix this as peacefully as possible
[1:36:33.740 --> 1:36:40.740]  I have a plug today I've been too upset you believe what we're doing in fullwarstore.com great products blow you away
[1:36:40.740 --> 1:36:51.740]  Let's go to the calls here we got Michael, Alex, Brian, Don, Jacob, Joseph, Shannon, Duncan, Oak, Shalim I always say is not name wrong I'm barely speaking English
[1:36:51.740 --> 1:36:53.740]  We'll go to everybody
[1:36:53.740 --> 1:37:03.740]  But what do we do when we're under assault what do you do when they're coming physically for you and locking you down and carrying out a again a dystopic nightmare on you
[1:37:03.740 --> 1:37:13.740]  What do you do at that point because Bill Gates wants powerful physical control over your body he wants that metaphysical control to not just rape you
[1:37:13.740 --> 1:37:25.740]  And physically spiritually get power over you he's got a vaccine that reprograms your very cells he's going to rape your ancestors and your very DNA and he's giggling and laughing about it
[1:37:25.740 --> 1:37:33.740]  And hiding in plain view and having all this media he bought and paid for sit there and say that you deserve it
[1:37:33.740 --> 1:37:39.740]  Which again is to gaslight you what are you going to do
[1:37:39.740 --> 1:37:42.740]  What do we do about Bill Gates trying to rape us
[1:37:42.740 --> 1:37:47.740]  Bill Gates is a rapist he wants to rape your DNA
[1:37:47.740 --> 1:37:50.740]  Joseph and Ireland you're on the air go ahead thanks for holding
[1:37:50.740 --> 1:37:52.740]  Hi Alex how are you
[1:37:52.740 --> 1:37:54.740]  I'm pretty pissed
[1:37:54.740 --> 1:38:14.740]  I don't want to come in here as some negative and but a good general recognizes where they are and I believe that I've said this before to you but this is the start of the coming to power of the antichrist next year we'll get really bad
[1:38:14.740 --> 1:38:22.740]  Where I'm getting my information from and I hope you don't mind me saying this but God is talking to people in the world
[1:38:22.740 --> 1:38:31.740]  Alex you're actually word for word on some of the stuff he's saying so you are being inspired
[1:38:31.740 --> 1:38:38.740]  But the antichrist is a man and I think you had a guy called Carlos on there a while back and this is what finally made me ring in
[1:38:38.740 --> 1:38:43.740]  He said the antichrist is a human spirit but the antichrist is a man he's going to reign over us
[1:38:43.740 --> 1:38:47.740]  Adult Hitler will be a teddy bear picnic compared to him
[1:38:47.740 --> 1:38:55.740]  Bill Gates is nothing but a minion bringing him in and I looked at Camilla Harris Pelosi and Hillary
[1:38:55.740 --> 1:39:03.740]  I'm looking at them there's a new lease of life in them they must have gone to some big satanic ritual and they're ready now to move to the next level
[1:39:03.740 --> 1:39:12.740]  And the real suppression is coming now this is the appeal I have to make all those who are listening I think most of them are Christian God fearing people
[1:39:12.740 --> 1:39:18.740]  But you can't say you believe in God and you're not praying because this is the only thing that's going to bring it to an end Alex's prayer
[1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:25.740]  Joseph I'm meant to open the show today with prayer and calling on God because if we try to fix it ourselves we get frustrated and enraged
[1:39:25.740 --> 1:39:31.740]  What do you think I should do when I just feel so angry that I can't defeat this I guess just give it to God
[1:39:31.740 --> 1:39:38.740]  Yeah absolutely Alex do you know what I mean I'm coming from the point of view and I'm not here to ram anything down anybody's talk
[1:39:38.740 --> 1:39:47.740]  Your own beliefs your beliefs right but I would say to you right offer up your frustration to God to Christ himself on the cross
[1:39:47.740 --> 1:39:53.740]  Because it is he who's only going to conquer the antichrist and bring his reign to an end to our prayers and our sufferings that's the reality
[1:39:53.740 --> 1:39:58.740]  All right powerful Joseph call back again more calls straight ahead I'm going to shut up take your calls
[1:39:58.740 --> 1:40:01.740]  Hey brothers
[1:40:01.740 --> 1:40:09.740]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com you can wear them out to political events you can trigger live darts
[1:40:09.740 --> 1:40:16.740]  But one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween
[1:40:16.740 --> 1:40:23.740]  But on top of that they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else
[1:40:23.740 --> 1:40:31.740]  It's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations and contact tracing of their openly announcing it's an act of submission
[1:40:31.740 --> 1:40:35.740]  It's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down
[1:40:35.740 --> 1:40:44.740]  But a big reason to wear these is then in the stores when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing
[1:40:44.740 --> 1:40:52.740]  And the M95 mask only control what's coming in not what's going out so they quote spread COVID-19 they don't protect from it
[1:40:52.740 --> 1:41:01.740]  So again it's a great way to throw it back at these control freaks faces you buy one for 9.95 you get four more free they're at cost infowarstore.com
[1:41:01.740 --> 1:41:09.740]  Another part of the great awakening that's taking place is people that haven't even been religious or Christian now see how evil is out in the open
[1:41:09.740 --> 1:41:16.740]  How hundreds of churches have been burned in Europe and the US hundreds of Christian icons have been burned destroyed
[1:41:16.740 --> 1:41:24.740]  Jesus has had their heads cut off all over the country all over the Philippines all over Europe Virgin Mary's are getting torn down I mean crosses are being torn down
[1:41:24.740 --> 1:41:36.740]  It's absolutely out of control but people now understand that evil was always real it is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move building beneath the surface and now it's emerged
[1:41:36.740 --> 1:41:44.740]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer I mean it I'm praying for America I'm praying for you and I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it
[1:41:44.740 --> 1:41:54.740]  We need to come together and pray for even greater awakening pray for Donald Trump to be protected pray for him to win a landslide and pray for the people under deception
[1:41:54.740 --> 1:42:01.740]  Of the globalist to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom God bless you all please pray for him for us as well
[1:42:01.740 --> 1:42:18.740]  Actually bought this in blocks UHF frequencies Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us not just tracking and recording our GPS location but recording audio and video as well with or without a battery

[1:44:25.740 --> 1:44:36.740]  There's an anti human AI takeover happening and whether you believe in the Bible the Antichrist Satan or not they've used it as a blueprint of control
[1:44:36.740 --> 1:44:45.740]  And I can't imagine being all the people that have attacked us over the years saying we were lying about this and now it's out the open
[1:44:45.740 --> 1:45:02.740]  You know I have again I'm almost ashamed of it I'm not bragging about it this with power comes corruption but I know a lot of big producers in Hollywood a lot of movie stars and I know people that have produced you know 50 major programs for HBO
[1:45:02.740 --> 1:45:09.740]  I know people that have produced 30 major movies yeah I mean I know and they're all like where do I move where do I go it's all collapsing
[1:45:09.740 --> 1:45:23.740]  People go oh look Hollywood's collapsing we're winning it was always to destabilize us and control us the globalists are making their move to kill the country they're not going to invest in it anymore
[1:45:23.740 --> 1:45:35.740]  The snakes already pulled its fangs out and slithered off we're in trouble and I don't say that to demoralize you I say that so you get pissed and realize we're in the fight of our lives
[1:45:35.740 --> 1:45:42.740]  I can talk to that last caller for an hour but we had to get him off because I want to go to your other calls at a Jesse Peterson joining us at 15 after
[1:45:42.740 --> 1:45:54.740]  Alright let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Pennsylvania and I'm asking everybody what do we do what's our line in the sand when Dr. Gates who isn't a doctor says this vaccine hurts you
[1:45:54.740 --> 1:46:02.740]  I have liability protection we're going to make you take it to have a job or get on an airplane
[1:46:02.740 --> 1:46:05.740]  Yep got me now yes sir Brian go ahead
[1:46:05.740 --> 1:46:10.740]  Good talking to you sir previous caller was actually right prayer number one
[1:46:10.740 --> 1:46:22.740]  Number two we're going to have to do the things that we're not doing and just stand up get out there we're going to have to get our own mob walking down the street saying no we're not taking the vaccine we're not going to go through with it
[1:46:22.740 --> 1:46:35.740]  and do our own marches we're going to have to it's tough because why aren't we doing it now we've gotten so accustomed to that three weeks of vacation air conditioning 200 channels on our satellite dish
[1:46:35.740 --> 1:46:44.740]  and we're just we're not doing what we need to do and hopefully that'll be the time when we can you know finally come to grips and do it get out there
[1:46:44.740 --> 1:46:58.740]  take our vacation days and use it as to go to DC get it marched together whatever it takes I don't know but I've become increasingly concerned about the vaccine because working in healthcare these last couple years with the flu vaccine
[1:46:58.740 --> 1:47:08.740]  slowly become where yeah you cannot take it you can still work no big deal yeah you cannot take it now you gotta wear you gotta wear a little tag when you get your flu vaccine
[1:47:08.740 --> 1:47:18.740]  oh you don't take it this year you gotta wear a mask if you don't take it it's going to be where I'm not going to be allowed to work I'm not going to be allowed to work
[1:47:18.740 --> 1:47:28.740]  well that's it they admit they're hurting us into this and again I'm sitting there last night already knew about this but my mom had her birthday so she had some of her friends over at my house my wife made dinner for them
[1:47:28.740 --> 1:47:42.740]  and she was like yeah I can't go to Barton's screens Barton brings anymore because I've got to give them my name my number my driver's license in case somebody else gets covered they got to tell me so they can track me
[1:47:42.740 --> 1:47:50.740]  that's all them training you to go to a park you've got to be enrolled medically with this tyranny God bless you I appreciate your call Brian
[1:47:50.740 --> 1:48:06.740]  Oak Sheila in South Dakota refused to comply occupy fighting back what do we do how do we stand up the gates because that's my question he's coming assaulting us he's a native American history with the smallpox blankets telling us he's a friend what do we do
[1:48:06.740 --> 1:48:23.740]  oh thank you Alex yes I got three points here first one as stated before when I called you many months ago for the first time what the grandfather spirits which I explained where angels told us is that people need to get out on the street it can even just be one person or a few and they need to go to
[1:48:23.740 --> 1:48:40.740]  you said we only have a few months to break this will the lockdown will last forever and so they people have to get to the city hall they have to get to the governor's matches they have to get to the House of Representatives in their states and they must occupy
[1:48:40.740 --> 1:48:50.740]  they can't just not agree to see how the New Mexico governor said liberals can protest conservatives can't she actually said that because that's because they fear that we should ignore everything they're saying
[1:48:50.740 --> 1:48:59.740]  yes well and here's the main point though people have to occupy they have to hold ground and refuse to go the next point
[1:48:59.740 --> 1:49:08.740]  now I had an interesting thing happen here when I was on the phone with you waiting I've had a lot of activists were going against me particularly from Luciferians
[1:49:08.740 --> 1:49:23.740]  someone tapped into my line and started saying bizarre things to me as I was on hold so I'm going to say it what needs to happen is that anybody that has a video or the information that's on Anthony Weiner's laptop they need to put it out on the internet
[1:49:23.740 --> 1:49:36.740]  raw and do it soon okay just like we saw with the George Floyd video we need to see it absolutely put out because we know they have all that child murder on video not just child rape
[1:49:36.740 --> 1:49:45.740]  exactly and then the last point is this one of the persons talked about prayer and that's true but the other side of prayer is repenting
[1:49:45.740 --> 1:49:57.740]  God is removing his hedge of protection around this country because people have not repented for the sins one of those sins is abortion the other sin and I know this is going to be hard for some people to hear
[1:49:57.740 --> 1:50:10.740]  but hundreds of treaties were made with Native American tribes in the name of God and they were broken and until we repent for these crimes God will not return the hedge of protection so these are the things that
[1:50:10.740 --> 1:50:27.740]  why do you think the Supreme Court then I tried to figure out that ruling on Oklahoma what's that about I haven't really come to my understanding of why they did that I think what they're trying to do within the system is they're trying to leverage the credibility of the indigenous
[1:50:27.740 --> 1:50:42.740]  plight to promote their own that's exactly to create more division they'll never actually get the land over yes and I want to say this most Native Americans are pro Americans very few native speakers that you see out there screaming and yelling do not represent us
[1:50:42.740 --> 1:50:57.740]  they're hijacking our identity hey almost everybody out in the state of America is totally dolled in and knows what's going on God bless you sir I can talk to that guy all day we got to get everybody else here as let's go ahead and talk to who's up next here let's talk to
[1:50:57.740 --> 1:51:11.740]  Zach in New Hampshire go ahead Zach you're on the air hey Alex you hear me sir pleasure to talk to you I got a few points first one I want to plug knock out this all the stuff that's going on is incredibly overwhelming and it's hard to say
[1:51:11.740 --> 1:51:23.740]  it's hard to sleep at night when you when you figure out what's going on for the first time so knock out a couple of those pills and you know set it on auto deliverance what I got in your sleep like a baby and you're charged up anyways
[1:51:23.740 --> 1:51:36.740]  not selling anymore just want to make a couple points people wear your Trump gear I know it's scary I know it's scary wear info or gear but wear it people have come up to me they've given me their phone numbers they have said thank you for wearing this thank you for not wearing a mask
[1:51:36.740 --> 1:51:47.740]  oh and folks get one of our t-shirts or a Trump t-shirt I'm not lying when I say you're signing on for an adventure and most of it's positive but after you shake 10 hands somebody drives by and tells you go to hell
[1:51:47.740 --> 1:51:59.740]  just waiting for that one Alex I haven't had that happen to me yet but I'm just waiting for it and it's given me just a lot of faith that you know you know we're overwhelmed and we're censored but it's just nice to see that the people are truly awake
[1:51:59.740 --> 1:52:10.740]  the other point I wanted to make was about the schools and the schools not really opening up at least here in New Hampshire there's a lot of drama around that 73% of the people in our town wanted the schools to open up as normal
[1:52:10.740 --> 1:52:21.740]  now I have a little inside information to the school system I know that there are emails between the school board that said they are going to go against whatever Trump and Betsy DeBos decide to do
[1:52:21.740 --> 1:52:30.740]  so what we're going to do is we're actually going to file Freedom of Information Act against all of these emails and we're going to collect every email in New Hampshire from the school board
[1:52:30.740 --> 1:52:40.740]  and so they didn't care about children they didn't care about education they didn't care about the system we all invested in they cared about political power to wage siege against America
[1:52:40.740 --> 1:52:52.740]  but I agree and this is the message to normal people guys don't be playing video games get off all the crap stop smoking dope and get to work you are eventually going to have kids the people that are listening to this that do not have families
[1:52:52.740 --> 1:53:00.740]  you will eventually have a family and it will all click you will realize your existence and your purpose and it's for the future of your children
[1:53:00.740 --> 1:53:12.740]  now the school are a joke McDonald's is essential I can go to McDonald's and get a big Mac the grocery store that employees high school students can employ high school students but these same students can't walk into the classroom in September
[1:53:12.740 --> 1:53:23.740]  well exactly Gates always wanted to get rid of the schools and the schools had problems but we built them we paid for them their assaults the police have problems but they're taking over all our institutions so the UN runs them
[1:53:23.740 --> 1:53:36.740]  no we take them back and now we know they need to be American institutions again start filing the freedom of information request people they are terrified of us and don't let them control your city you have to run for local office
[1:53:36.740 --> 1:53:47.740]  local town and city government I agree Zach we're out of time alright two more segments of calls and I'm going to get to Michael Alex Don, Jacob Shannon Duncan and Gator and then we've got Jesse Peterson on
[1:53:47.740 --> 1:53:56.740]  and there's so much other huge breaking news it's totally insane but we're going to come through this together if I don't plug we won't be here we have great products
[1:53:56.740 --> 1:54:11.740]  we have the reopen America back to school special that is the last special we were running but without the free shipping because we did the accounting and the math and we just can't fund ourselves with 50% off and the free shipping
[1:54:11.740 --> 1:54:22.740]  I mean some of the products like the privacy pocket we were making like $2 on so yeah you sell a thousand of them a day you make $2,000 it doesn't pay for things
[1:54:22.740 --> 1:54:34.740]  so you still get the privacy pocket in 1995 but not with the free shipping and all the supplements and all the rest of it the discounts are there but they're going to have to end because a bunch of these are close to selling out so take advantage of that sale
[1:54:34.740 --> 1:54:43.740]  I want to thank you all for funding us we don't get a big check we don't get any check from any global organization any big corporation any group we get money from you
[1:54:43.740 --> 1:54:50.740]  info wars you built this you did this but don't call and thank me I want to thank you
[1:54:50.740 --> 1:55:08.740]  whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory or not the globalist controllers do they constantly write about and talk about how they want to create a global crisis or a group of crises that force humans to quote evolve in a new better way
[1:55:08.740 --> 1:55:36.740]  that when you study how they actually want you to evolve you believe in that it is to stop having children emerge with silicon bodies and a post human future talk about psychotic talk about creepy talk about crazy but they need an event like COVID-19 to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose over its breathing tubes to set the precedent for the forced inoculations for the GMO for the 5G and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity as we know it
[1:55:36.740 --> 1:55:52.740]  that's why this is so evil their whole agenda for cashless society global government you in control getting us all into debt getting rid of local government think about all the facets of it the censorship the surveillance
[1:55:52.740 --> 1:56:16.740]  Vicki Gibbs 57 year old lesbian preacher in Houston went in with a cough got intubated and then died and as soon as I saw her face as soon as I saw the report I said watch it'll be innovation we know what's going to happen it's a blue city same story yet again and they say her heart gave out
[1:56:16.740 --> 1:56:39.740]  if you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 is a death sentence it's on record when everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states it's because they intubate them putting a tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response and if you do that with oxygen the doctors are on record saying it will kill you
[1:56:39.740 --> 1:56:51.740]  but all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders and the minute I saw this report today I knew what I would be reading don't end up like Vicki Gibbs or everyone
[1:57:10.740 --> 1:57:12.740]  I
[1:57:27.740 --> 1:57:30.740]  buddy welcome sir go ahead
[1:57:30.740 --> 1:57:35.740]  hey I need a t-shirt that says this honky ain't voting for no donkey
[1:57:35.740 --> 1:57:41.740]  okay I think it would be awesome but anyways hey listen
[1:57:41.740 --> 1:57:53.740]  some of your guests are hit spot on with saying you know we need to turn to Christ that's really the answer to all of our problems to to handle any solutions as far as Bill Gates goes
[1:57:53.740 --> 1:57:57.740]  I don't think we should have to worry
[1:57:57.740 --> 1:58:07.740]  about what he will be able to do to us because we have the Holy Spirit to protect us as long as we stay within the Holy Spirit we are having a hedge of protection around us
[1:58:07.740 --> 1:58:16.740]  sure what about all the children born to dumb parents that they let them give all these deadly vaccines to and then don't wonder why they're totally mentally retarded or have cancer five years later
[1:58:16.740 --> 1:58:25.740]  we have a job though to warn everybody else and yes this honky ain't working ain't voting for a donkey that's funny I just had really low audio couldn't really hear you if I could barely hear it
[1:58:25.740 --> 1:58:36.740]  so my issue is you're away don't let that go color your vision to think others are we have a responsibility to warn other people does that make sense
[1:58:36.740 --> 1:58:47.740]  yes but you are winning because everywhere I go people are talking about Pete the gate people are talking about adrenal chrome people are talking about the pedophile ring in places that I've never heard people talk about that before
[1:58:47.740 --> 1:59:02.740]  and then what is that a bedrock to the elite are the elite are maggots that are feeding on our children our spirit our future our children are us they are attacking humanity they're the enemy so when I say and I get what you're saying hey don't worry about Bill Gates
[1:59:02.740 --> 1:59:13.740]  people working up I'm saying if I was coming to your house with a shot that I said had an 80% chance of hurting you and I learned to make you take it you have a right to physically stop me
[1:59:13.740 --> 1:59:23.740]  he wants to pressure you saying oh you can't have a job or get on an airplane or have a life you don't it's the same thing as rape telling a woman I'm going to fire you if you don't have sex with me
[1:59:23.740 --> 1:59:31.740]  that's right whether you physically did it or use pressure to do it well he wants it's just not just raping a woman or a man he wants to hurt you
[1:59:31.740 --> 1:59:46.740]  what if the man told a woman work for him I'm going to rape you or I'm going to fire you want to feed your children don't you and by the way I've got hepatitis I'm going to give you hepatitis if you want your job
[1:59:46.740 --> 1:59:54.740]  well she has a right right then to stab him in the neck with a dagger I mean I tell my daughter some man tries to rape you kill him
[1:59:54.740 --> 2:00:04.740]  I mean seriously I'm not they're moving on us because they think we're pathetic and weak they think we're going to take people's crap and I'm just simply saying I'm not somebody shoots my mouth all about physical stuff
[2:00:04.740 --> 2:00:12.740]  I'm just metaphysically moving into a zone where I'm having real trouble not just being open about that you see what I'm saying
[2:00:12.740 --> 2:00:22.740]  yes but we have the spirit and we can win this fight I don't believe that you you said four years ago that we have five years what did you mean by that
[2:00:22.740 --> 2:00:39.740]  you know I said one day at the end of a show that they're going to attack a rock concert or music concert tonight at 10 o'clock and sometimes I just say stuff it just comes out of me and 99% of what I say is documented
[2:00:39.740 --> 2:00:47.740]  some of them just say stuff and then the FBI hostage rescue team called me the next day and they said well we looked at everything you have no connection to what happened here but how did you say that
[2:00:47.740 --> 2:01:00.740]  and I said I just said oh yeah we know you make a lot of money if you can control that and you know so we all have that and so I say things I say a lot of stuff I don't know why I say it but I mean every day I'm better but does that make sense
[2:01:00.740 --> 2:01:12.740]  yes it does and I think you're right I think we're at the last year of it and I think it's this is what God wants and this is what we read in revelations and there's nothing we could do to stop that
[2:01:12.740 --> 2:01:23.740]  the only thing we can do is turn to God but I agree our connection to God called that psychic power though is going to turn up like they think they've got surveillance on us and they're going to cut our food off and they're going to corner us

[2:03:41.740 --> 2:03:59.740]  Alex I would say no liability no shot if you believe in the shot Mr. Gates then you should accept liability for it if it's going to help us more than hurt it hurt us you should accept liability for the shot I'd also get Dr. Francis Boyle to establish a truth and truth and reconciliation committee on COVID-19
[2:03:59.740 --> 2:04:17.740]  where did this come from whoever comes forward first tells us where this came from and the truth story can be granted amnesty those who don't will be punished accordingly and those who die from the vaccine will be held to be direct the direct responsibility of the people that created
[2:04:17.740 --> 2:04:30.740]  that's what my dad always tells friends and family when schools try to pressure them to take shots it's not the law but they lie and say it is a and that's fine I have a waiver form that you accept liability any side effects just what they shut up real fast it's all intimidation they have
[2:04:30.740 --> 2:04:50.740]  bounties on how many kids get vaccinated absolutely and I just think that if he truly put up or shut up it's like in the movie Salem's lot where the vampire says your faith against my faith if you believe in this shot Mr. Satan Gates then you will accept financial liability
[2:04:50.740 --> 2:05:08.740]  you're supposedly a philanthropist but you're going to kill more people than you can afford how is that philanthropy by the way that was a great major TV movie kind of a ripoff of Nosferatu that was rewritten by Stephen King but he actually has the human handler that takes care of him
[2:05:08.740 --> 2:05:18.740]  he says the priest he goes put down your cross your will against my will you're absolutely right that's what we should say to them absolutely I think you're doing such an amazing
[2:05:18.740 --> 2:05:28.740]  wait I thank God for you I don't thank you Alex you've been given special gifts beyond anybody in America today and I thank Almighty God that you're here to wield them
[2:05:28.740 --> 2:05:40.740]  and I appreciate you it's you guys praying for me the only reason I'm trying to hold it together believe me it's not easy now I just everybody sees so much now I just see so much it's just like
[2:05:40.740 --> 2:05:56.740]  it's hard to handle I know you all see it too they want to overwhelm you for learned helplessness so we ball up and give up I don't ball up and give up I get angry and that's not good either so I pray to God every day to just give me the peace that King David talked about in that quiet place the most high so God bless you brother
[2:05:56.740 --> 2:06:06.740]  alright let's go take another call here who's been holding the longest now that would be Michael in Detroit Michigan go ahead
[2:06:06.740 --> 2:06:19.740]  hi Alex I want to say God bless you and everything that you do helping us keep the knowledge going but we're all in it together now brother they're coming with forced injections and implantable microchips
[2:06:19.740 --> 2:06:39.740]  well the first thing we need to do is we need to recognize that you're lighting a fire in us all and we need to take the information you give us the information we get from your website and keep core affiliated with your website and we need to wake other people up and then we need to get those people together and we need to go to these city halls
[2:06:39.740 --> 2:06:51.740]  we need to go to these governor's mansions we need to let them know that we know what's going on and we're not going to take it we know I agree you could be one person with a bullhorn at the governor's mansion but Austin's two million people
[2:06:51.740 --> 2:07:06.740]  if somebody every day I've been down there four times went down there and bullhorned him and said stop serve the new old order and read off statistics if somebody bullhorned Trump every day to say take action against the deep state it's that voice that will change everything
[2:07:06.740 --> 2:07:24.740]  that's true and I want to thank you because you helped me turn into God I turned my back on God for a long time and listening to you talk every day at noon it's helped me wake up it's helped me realize how much better is your life now turning towards God
[2:07:24.740 --> 2:07:43.740]  it's a lot better my relationships with people are a lot better my outlook on life is a lot better I don't have as much conflict in my life it's really it's eye opening it's almost kind of serious because you can feel the devil pulling your strings back sometimes and you've got to fight against it
[2:07:43.740 --> 2:07:49.740]  absolutely that's it's real God bless you thank you sir Alex in Florida you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:07:49.740 --> 2:07:54.740]  good morning Mr. Jones how you doing good brother go ahead
[2:07:54.740 --> 2:08:03.740]  so I've heard a lot of alluding to it from a lot of the previous callers and you just mentioned it yourself you've been to the governor's house four times
[2:08:03.740 --> 2:08:17.740]  we know where Gaith lives in Medina Washington how she lives in Washington DC you know you were talking about the rules and engagement how do we properly go against this I'm just spitballing here but you know they move left we move left
[2:08:17.740 --> 2:08:23.740]  they move right we move right why can't we go and storm and start bullholing bullhorning Mr. Gates's house
[2:08:23.740 --> 2:08:30.740]  well I'll tell you folks took over seeing in the headquarters this week in LA I don't want to be violent I don't want to kill cops I don't want to burn buildings down
[2:08:30.740 --> 2:08:41.740]  but I'll tell you right now I was up in Seattle a few years ago my wife wanted to visit some family that lives up there and we rented just a little cell boat rental
[2:08:41.740 --> 2:08:53.740]  and the guy pulls up a little bay and he goes there's Bill Gates's house and we have to be there while Bill Gates's family just happened to be there we didn't see Bill Gates but I can recognize this like 18 year old son out there
[2:08:53.740 --> 2:09:04.740]  and I was like a hundred yards from the dock and there was a son looking at us on the boat and I'd rented the boat for the day it wasn't that much you rent the boat for like a thousand bucks and they make you a filet mignon or whatever it was like four of us on the boat
[2:09:04.740 --> 2:09:12.740]  but I mean yeah I'm not calling for violence but we need to let him know that we he wants to stick something in us he says is going to make us sick
[2:09:12.740 --> 2:09:19.740]  well we're going to expose him for who he is and his agenda and then we're going to let him know that we're watching his ass
[2:09:19.740 --> 2:09:33.740]  yeah precisely I mean I've always believed that the next coming of a Christ was was going to be all of us embodying everything that he taught and you know the evil the left everybody involved with this they like to use fear that's the opposite of what Christ taught
[2:09:33.740 --> 2:09:44.740]  well they also tell Christians never be offensive and we don't kill people before they attack us but it says thou shalt not murder that means kill someone that's done nothing it doesn't say thou shalt not kill it's a it's a translation issue
[2:09:44.740 --> 2:09:55.740]  the Old Testament says enemies come to kill you rise up and kill them but you're absolutely right that that Christ went into the money changers and he beat them with a whip and kicked them and beat their ass
[2:09:55.740 --> 2:10:09.740]  and I'm not calling for that yet I'm just saying remember Christ went in there into a temple with you know a hundred priests they were unable to kick his ass he beat their ass didn't he gave people that little taste that oh I can do this too you understand
[2:10:09.740 --> 2:10:19.740]  exactly and he did it in the absence of fear he knew he was doing the right thing so we got their car we got the number I think we need to go straight to them they want to go and protest our White House we go and protest your mansion
[2:10:19.740 --> 2:10:30.740]  you want to protest and try to take out our police department we're going to be right there your gate giving it right back to you whatever you do we do rules of engagement we're mirroring you
[2:10:30.740 --> 2:10:41.740]  but there's no reason why with everything that we know we can't turn this around because the spark is coming that's going to light up all of us all around the world and we're going to just stand up and we're going to embody Christ and we're going to take over
[2:10:41.740 --> 2:10:53.740]  absolutely you know the Bible talks about it and some of the New Ages try to steal the term but it's real it's Christ awareness Christ spirit Christ consciousness and that means Christ spirit in us that's what they fear
[2:10:53.740 --> 2:10:57.740]  notice they fear Christ they fear Christ just the real deal
[2:10:57.740 --> 2:10:59.740]  sure is
[2:10:59.740 --> 2:11:07.740]  God bless you brother alright I may have to host a little bit the next hour because we got Jesse Lee Peterson a great guy I'm so happy to have coming up and then we've got
[2:11:07.740 --> 2:11:18.740]  Gator who I want to go to next and then Duncan and Steve and how and Pete and Don and Isaac but also tell you this we're going to take a lot more calls on the show and I'm going to do special shows to at night where we just take calls
[2:11:18.740 --> 2:11:27.740]  basically commercial free it'll be on radio and TV satellite folks that want to pick it up to be for everybody who wants to get on the internet for free as well let's take one more quick call we only get about a minute and a half
[2:11:27.740 --> 2:11:32.740]  let's talk to Patty in Wyoming Patty thanks for holding her on the air
[2:11:32.740 --> 2:11:34.740]  Hey Alex
[2:11:34.740 --> 2:11:36.740]  Hi Patty
[2:11:36.740 --> 2:11:40.740]  quickly I got a little bit of noise but can you hear me
[2:11:40.740 --> 2:11:44.740]  yeah how it works with the phone system is when it puts you on air it goes
[2:11:44.740 --> 2:11:46.740]  go ahead
[2:11:46.740 --> 2:11:58.740]  okay great so anyway how are we going to fight it we're going to fight it like Patriots have fought it throughout history all the way back to biblical time some of us will die some of us will lose families will lose property but will prevail
[2:11:58.740 --> 2:12:07.740]  we're seeing biblical in time prophecies come to pass God's in control he's calling out his army and we will win
[2:12:07.740 --> 2:12:19.740]  but you said the key we've got to be ready to lose everything like Job and die a necessary just who cares you serve the Satan and take implantable chips of Satan that's worse than death
[2:12:19.740 --> 2:12:22.740]  if you die on your
[2:12:22.740 --> 2:12:38.740]  Patty your phone's breaking up and I said this yesterday we need to get all the callers numbers and then actually for the first time ever it's my fault I never reminded her to do it actually call them the start of the show and get them on
[2:12:38.740 --> 2:12:52.740]  Patty's phone's breaking up but what she was saying was powerful who knows we'll get Jesse Peterson on and I'll probably go to your calls after that but I don't want to shortchange you and I don't want to leave the wrong way I'm sure how much time we have but Jesse Peterson's coming up
[2:12:52.740 --> 2:12:58.740]  I mean look the mark of the beast world governments here what are we going to do about it
[2:12:58.740 --> 2:13:13.740]  we close and lock our doors and windows at night not because we're doing anything wrong but because it's about privacy and it's about security and it's something that we do to protect ourselves going back thousands of years when we would post a dog or a century at the
[2:13:13.740 --> 2:13:27.740]  address of the village so we would know if predators or criminals were coming well big tech along with the federal government and other globalist organizations have been tracking everybody illegally for years with their cell phones but now the public is finally waiting up because the
[2:13:27.740 --> 2:13:35.740]  enemy has openly announced it's the fact and the Clinton Foundation global initiative with Chelsea is running the private system to spy on you and your family
[2:13:35.740 --> 2:13:49.740]  that's right the Democrats the globalists the chai comms they've all got our number they're tracking us in lifetime but with privacy pockets the best system at infowarstore.com you can protect yourself and your family by keeping your cell phone inside of the little pouch
[2:13:49.740 --> 2:13:57.740]  we're selling more of these in a day than we used to sell in a month because America and the world is waking up get yours at infowarstore.com and go stealth
[2:13:57.740 --> 2:14:07.740]  one of our best selling products is living defense and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic we've got a limited supply right now
[2:14:07.740 --> 2:14:13.740]  but it's selling out fast and I want those of you that haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself here just part of one testimonial
[2:14:13.740 --> 2:14:29.740]  I looked in January 2016 I went in a hospital I went to VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and I kept hearing doctor group and all you guys talking about living defense
[2:14:29.740 --> 2:14:43.740]  three days a man I had an internal digestive problem and something with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing you and doctor group and those commercials I said you know what I'm going to get me
[2:14:43.740 --> 2:14:55.740]  some of that freaking living defense now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional because they don't want you to have that stuff but I ordered it had it shipped to me I got it I hid it from the nurses I started taking it man that stuff changed my life it saved my life
[2:14:55.740 --> 2:15:01.740]  Alex Jones and info wars saved my life
[2:15:01.740 --> 2:15:29.740]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:15:29.740 --> 2:15:57.740]  good morning everybody
[2:15:57.740 --> 2:16:17.740]  this is doctor Lisa coach coming to you live from Tampa Florida where I continue to lead a large 8000 patient practice through the front lines of this COVID-19 pandemic I'm going to try to make it through this live without getting too upset but yesterday
[2:16:17.740 --> 2:16:37.740]  my colleagues were on Capitol Hill and these people I felt the connection so deeply because they are people who love and care for patients just like I do and they came out and they spoke about information that has been hidden from the public information that I've had to go underground to find
[2:16:37.740 --> 2:16:57.740]  I'm not a political person I just want to heal people I want to empower people I want you to be able to take care of yourselves and live a life the highest potential you ever can possibly achieve and that requires you being able to feel good it requires you being able to ask questions and these doctors have information
[2:16:57.740 --> 2:17:17.740]  why are these doctors being censored on YouTube who is doing that why what is their agenda why do we have to see more people die if you saw that woman with her heart on her sleeve she was begging the American people saying she didn't care what happened to her that the information has to be released
[2:17:17.740 --> 2:17:29.740]  I tell all of you doctors that are sitting down and watching Americans die you're like the good Nazi the good what the good Germans that watch Jews get killed and you do not speak up
[2:17:29.740 --> 2:17:41.740]  I believe I'm one of them if they come after me they threaten me they threaten to I mean I've gotten all kinds of threats or they're gonna report me to the bots they're gonna I say you know what I don't care I'm not gonna let Americans die
[2:17:41.740 --> 2:17:52.740]  and if this is the mountain if this is the hill where I get nailed on I will get nailed on it I don't care you can report me to the bots you can kill me you can do whatever but I'm not gonna let Americans die
[2:17:52.740 --> 2:18:07.740]  and today I'm here to say that America there is a cure for covid all this foolishness it's not does not need to happen there is a cure for covid there is a cure for covid it's called hydroxychloroquine it's called zinc it's called Zetromax
[2:18:07.740 --> 2:18:27.740]  oh that clip enraged them and that predominantly the biggest point that was given on this on during this newscast or press conference was that hydroxychloroquine which has been all over the place during this pandemic as soon as it started gaining momentum
[2:18:27.740 --> 2:18:46.740]  whether it was political reasons or because of the V word and and funding of a study that was shady and I've discussed this on the slide before they confirm that those studies and some of which were retracted from major journals who is allowing that to be published in the first place
[2:18:46.740 --> 2:18:53.740]  using hydroxychloroquine at four times the dose and then being able to say that it caused cardiac arrhythmia
[2:18:53.740 --> 2:18:58.740]  Dr. Anthony Fauci has said studies show the drug is ineffective at treating covid
[2:18:58.740 --> 2:19:11.740]  and now they're going in and pulling out peer reviewed studies going back years ago about hydroxychloroquine and they are taking it down because they are so upset that this is challenging them because they want you to take a forced inoculation
[2:19:11.740 --> 2:19:16.740]  so what the problem is in a lot of those studies they did very very high doses massive doses
[2:19:16.740 --> 2:19:27.740]  there's a preventive dose it's incredibly low it's a 200 milligram tablet of this pill twice a week there's no risk they've done studies this drug has been out for 65 years
[2:19:27.740 --> 2:19:35.740]  so why are we not giving that to our frontline workers why are we not giving that to our teachers why are we not giving that to the immunocompromised
[2:19:35.740 --> 2:19:43.740]  there are many thousands of physicians who have been silenced from telling the American people the good news about the situation that we can manage the virus
[2:19:43.740 --> 2:19:46.740]  you can kill me you can do whatever but I'm not going to let Americans die
[2:19:54.740 --> 2:20:02.740]  well he's been on with us years ago he's a frequent guest with Owen shroyer and he's always been popular since I do about him again more than 20 years ago
[2:20:02.740 --> 2:20:10.740]  but he's really white hot right now with a billions of views on YouTube other places Jesse Lee Peterson RebuildingTheMan.com
[2:20:10.740 --> 2:20:15.740]  and people don't know who Jesse Lee Peterson is they've been hot under a rock but he's the most courageous outspoken critic
[2:20:15.740 --> 2:20:21.740]  the civil rights establishment in America today raised without a father on a plantation near Tuskegee, Alabama
[2:20:21.740 --> 2:20:26.740]  and with Jim Crow era Peterson has lived a part of American history few have experienced
[2:20:26.740 --> 2:20:35.740]  that for spiritual transformation Peterson founded Bond a nationally recognized nonprofit organization dedicated to rebuilding the family by rebuilding the man
[2:20:35.740 --> 2:20:42.740]  Bond offers Sunday church services individual and family counseling monthly forums for men and women town hall and community forums
[2:20:42.740 --> 2:20:50.740]  an annual men's conference and the Bond Entrepreneurship Academy a program which helps aspiring young entrepreneurs start businesses
[2:20:50.740 --> 2:20:55.740]  Peterson is also a radio and TV personality talk show so I'm not going to go over it all he's been everywhere
[2:20:55.740 --> 2:21:02.740]  a Twitter JLP talk Jesse Lee Peterson.com RebuildingTheMan.com we've had more technical difficulties today we haven't last six months
[2:21:02.740 --> 2:21:09.740]  so I apologize getting him on late but he's at least here with us for the next two and a half segments thank you so much sir for being with us
[2:21:09.740 --> 2:21:14.740]  you've got a lot to cover today and just God bless you what do you want to cover first?
[2:21:14.740 --> 2:21:19.740]  Well number one I want to say thank you for having me on and Happy Men History Month.
[2:21:19.740 --> 2:21:30.740]  August is Men History Month this is our third year of celebrating it because men and boys are the most hated species on this side of heaven
[2:21:30.740 --> 2:21:38.740]  so we're bringing the attention to that so that men can wake up and take back control become back to their natural state of being
[2:21:38.740 --> 2:21:42.740]  so we've been rebuilding the family by rebuilding the man for the last 30 years.
[2:21:42.740 --> 2:21:48.740]  I should have said that you're really great at launching big movements and you pointed out this attack on men many many decades ago now it's out in the open
[2:21:48.740 --> 2:21:55.740]  you've talked about hey let's have white history month too and let's have man history month and let's have women history month
[2:21:55.740 --> 2:21:59.740]  let's actually celebrate the roles we all have instead of something Soros runs.
[2:21:59.740 --> 2:22:10.740]  That's right and July was White History Month and we started that three years ago because white people are the most hated species on this side of heaven
[2:22:10.740 --> 2:22:17.740]  and we see that now with the attack upon the president Donald Trump I call him the great white hope
[2:22:17.740 --> 2:22:26.740]  we see that with the attack upon white Americans today they've been knocked out, robbed, raped, murdered, their businesses have been destroyed
[2:22:26.740 --> 2:22:37.740]  and no one cares, no one says anything about it so we gotta remind people of white history because if it wasn't for white people there would be no America
[2:22:37.740 --> 2:22:43.740]  it was white folks who found it and created the greatest country on this side of heaven
[2:22:43.740 --> 2:22:49.740]  not blacks, not Mexicans, not Japanese, not Chinese, not Filipino but white people
[2:22:49.740 --> 2:22:58.740]  and we cannot afford Alex to let them erase white American history and create a false history that's what they're trying to do
[2:22:58.740 --> 2:23:04.740]  so we celebrate White History Month and July to remind the people how great this country is and who found it
[2:23:04.740 --> 2:23:09.740]  well you're doing really bold stuff because the idea of the Christian Renaissance is to empower everybody
[2:23:09.740 --> 2:23:17.740]  and that's why the globalists want to get rid of it because the real out of England banning slavery around the world they're really threatened by that
[2:23:17.740 --> 2:23:24.740]  absolutely and in America I have to say that if we don't stand up, we're gonna have it here, it's gonna get worse
[2:23:24.740 --> 2:23:30.740]  look what happened in South Africa white people are now under attack, they're being robbed, raped, murdered
[2:23:30.740 --> 2:23:38.740]  they're not even protected by the police force because they have redone the police forces over in South Africa
[2:23:38.740 --> 2:23:43.740]  and now white people don't have a chance, they're doing the exact same thing here
[2:23:43.740 --> 2:23:49.740]  white people are afraid to speak up for fear of being called racist, we have these radical black women
[2:23:49.740 --> 2:23:56.740]  and some men who will eat beta males, we have them in the power of men, police chiefs and
[2:23:56.740 --> 2:23:58.740]  stay right there Jesse, you're on fire, what do you got?

[2:26:01.740 --> 2:26:05.740]  I was about to introduce but some folks aren't so for those that aren't here they are
[2:26:05.740 --> 2:26:12.740]  activated charcoal and then another term enamel safe
[2:26:12.740 --> 2:26:19.740]  activated charcoal is the fastest growing type of toothpaste for a good reason
[2:26:19.740 --> 2:26:23.740]  it really really works well we've come up with the best activated charcoal toothpaste

[2:26:45.740 --> 2:26:48.740]  I've gone out before and gotten toothpaste that really made my teeth clean
[2:26:48.740 --> 2:26:54.740]  but eroded enamel up the top so I got into really safe healthy types of toothpaste
[2:26:54.740 --> 2:26:58.740]  that's what this is it's available at InfowarsStore.com
[2:27:25.740 --> 2:27:30.740]  Bill Gates and the Chai Combs to be directed by the UN as a giant planetary power grab
[2:27:30.740 --> 2:27:35.740]  and now it's all about the news that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital tattoos
[2:27:35.740 --> 2:27:41.740]  under your skin and so has Google and they're deploying them at the airports next year
[2:27:41.740 --> 2:27:45.740]  where you'll have to have it to be able to travel oh and then soon to leave your house
[2:27:45.740 --> 2:27:49.740]  or go in a grocery store and the contact tracers work for Bill and Melinda Gates
[2:27:49.740 --> 2:27:53.740]  and the Clintons and they're going to come to your house and make sure you're inoculated
[2:27:53.740 --> 2:27:57.740]  yes we're now inside the mark of the beast resist to be enslaved
[2:28:24.740 --> 2:28:28.740]  All right we got him on late because I have microphone problems today
[2:28:28.740 --> 2:28:32.740]  more than I've had in six months we never had problems a bunch of crazy stuff happened
[2:28:32.740 --> 2:28:35.740]  but they say when it rains it pours so he'll be with us 15 minutes to the next hour
[2:28:35.740 --> 2:28:38.740]  to get that full time with Jesse Lee Peterson which is always so precious
[2:28:38.740 --> 2:28:42.740]  then Paul Joseph Watson will take over from the United Kingdom but here he is with us
[2:28:42.740 --> 2:28:47.740]  love him I remember watching him 25 years ago when I first was seeing a show here in Austin
[2:28:47.740 --> 2:28:52.740]  on TV and of course now he's on radio and he made a lot of sense but he's like men are under attack
[2:28:52.740 --> 2:28:56.740]  families under attack but now you see how right he was
[2:28:56.740 --> 2:29:02.740]  and so I get so excited to see how incredibly successful he is today rebuilding the man.com
[2:29:02.740 --> 2:29:06.740]  and that's what unifies us is our families are under attack
[2:29:06.740 --> 2:29:10.740]  Black Lives Matter run by Planned Parenthood George Soros says in the nuclear family
[2:29:10.740 --> 2:29:13.740]  well that hurts all of us you couldn't do something worse
[2:29:13.740 --> 2:29:17.740]  and I see a huge awakening by black Americans particularly to this whole thing
[2:29:17.740 --> 2:29:21.740]  but you're the expert on what's happening right now so you have the floor my friend
[2:29:21.740 --> 2:29:25.740]  we've got a few segments to get into whatever you want to cover and what you want to talk about
[2:29:25.740 --> 2:29:30.740]  on this planet that's unfolding Democrats attempt to take down the president BLM Antifa
[2:29:30.740 --> 2:29:36.740]  the antidote to all the chaos the inner cities Jesse Lee Peterson my friend you've got the floor.
[2:29:36.740 --> 2:29:41.740]  Thank you Allison I appreciate it man thank you I do want to say that I'm stunned
[2:29:41.740 --> 2:29:45.740]  at what I see happening with this so-called Black Lives Matter
[2:29:45.740 --> 2:29:52.740]  I want to realize that Black Lives Matter is a far left liberal radical organization
[2:29:52.740 --> 2:29:58.740]  that was founded by fat black angry radical lesbians
[2:29:58.740 --> 2:30:04.740]  and I never I just never imagined that one day in a Christian nation
[2:30:04.740 --> 2:30:09.740]  that we would see police officers grow men and women
[2:30:09.740 --> 2:30:13.740]  bowing down to a bunch of fat black lesbians
[2:30:13.740 --> 2:30:17.740]  and that's mind blowing to see it these people hate God they hate the family
[2:30:17.740 --> 2:30:21.740]  they hate the nuclear family they hate the unborn children
[2:30:21.740 --> 2:30:27.740]  they hate white people they hate America they'll go around taking down statues and monuments
[2:30:27.740 --> 2:30:34.740]  and flags and things like that under this lie that America is a racist society
[2:30:34.740 --> 2:30:39.740]  it's just not true and it's not true that the police are going after black people
[2:30:39.740 --> 2:30:44.740]  the people who have been hurt by cops are those thugs who are resisting arrest
[2:30:44.740 --> 2:30:49.740]  who have been in jail before who have not been raised by good parents
[2:30:49.740 --> 2:30:54.740]  the cops are not going around and brutalize the decent black people
[2:30:54.740 --> 2:30:59.740]  because decent black people follow instructions when they're stopped by the cops
[2:30:59.740 --> 2:31:02.740]  and I can't believe that America is falling for this
[2:31:02.740 --> 2:31:07.740]  we got to realize that these people want to turn America into a socialist society
[2:31:07.740 --> 2:31:12.740]  and that's what these radical black so-called black life matter people are doing
[2:31:12.740 --> 2:31:15.740]  the words black life matter have no meaning
[2:31:15.740 --> 2:31:19.740]  they're there to manipulate and control and intimidate
[2:31:19.740 --> 2:31:22.740]  and I'm surprised to see white Americans falling for it
[2:31:22.740 --> 2:31:25.740]  I knew that white Americans had a problem with speaking up
[2:31:25.740 --> 2:31:31.740]  and I've been telling them for 30 years black people have suffered not because of Jim Crow
[2:31:31.740 --> 2:31:36.740]  not because of slavery not because of this phony idea of systemic racism
[2:31:36.740 --> 2:31:39.740]  black Americans are suffering those who are suffering
[2:31:39.740 --> 2:31:42.740]  are suffering due to the destruction of the parents
[2:31:42.740 --> 2:31:46.740]  they had no good parents and the father's not around
[2:31:46.740 --> 2:31:50.740]  and they have been blamed they are blaming white people for it
[2:31:50.740 --> 2:31:55.740]  Jesse Jackson and Lewis Farrakhan, Al Sharpton and all those people started
[2:31:55.740 --> 2:32:00.740]  this whole civil rights movement they started that crap 40 to 50 years ago
[2:32:00.740 --> 2:32:05.740]  and it's just gotten worse because they're not trying to rebuild the family
[2:32:05.740 --> 2:32:08.740]  they're not encouraging black to love all people
[2:32:08.740 --> 2:32:13.740]  I grew up in Alabama as you know Alice I grew up under the Jim Crow laws
[2:32:13.740 --> 2:32:17.740]  I grew up under the laws I remember for colors only sign for whites only
[2:32:17.740 --> 2:32:19.740]  but we were not taught to hate
[2:32:19.740 --> 2:32:23.740]  we were told that it's about them between good and evil right versus wrong
[2:32:23.740 --> 2:32:28.740]  there are people who are on the side of Satan and there are those who are on the side of God
[2:32:28.740 --> 2:32:34.740]  and you know all color all races and that we should treat people the way we would like to be treated
[2:32:34.740 --> 2:32:37.740]  I didn't hear all this crap about racism and all that
[2:32:37.740 --> 2:32:41.740]  that didn't start until the so-called civil rights movement started
[2:32:41.740 --> 2:32:43.740]  we should have never happened
[2:32:43.740 --> 2:32:46.740]  it was an awful mistake to have a civil rights movement
[2:32:46.740 --> 2:32:48.740]  let's not say things as civil rights
[2:32:48.740 --> 2:32:52.740]  and those people in the so-called civil rights movement
[2:32:52.740 --> 2:32:55.740]  they sold blacks over to the Democratic Party
[2:32:55.740 --> 2:32:57.740]  they sold them over to the government
[2:32:57.740 --> 2:33:01.740]  and they set themselves up as their leaders of black people
[2:33:01.740 --> 2:33:04.740]  and black people have gotten worse instead of getting better
[2:33:04.740 --> 2:33:06.740]  because they're not led by what is right
[2:33:06.740 --> 2:33:09.740]  let's be clear Christians had the abolition
[2:33:09.740 --> 2:33:11.740]  Christians tried to fix the wrongs
[2:33:11.740 --> 2:33:13.740]  and the Democrats who were running the slavery
[2:33:13.740 --> 2:33:15.740]  they just stepped in and took it over
[2:33:15.740 --> 2:33:17.740]  and created a new form of slavery right after it
[2:33:17.740 --> 2:33:21.740]  that's right because when I was growing up most black people
[2:33:21.740 --> 2:33:24.740]  all that I knew were Republicans they were not Democrats
[2:33:24.740 --> 2:33:27.740]  and the Jim Crow law was established by the Democratic Party
[2:33:27.740 --> 2:33:30.740]  we knew that and so we were Republicans
[2:33:30.740 --> 2:33:32.740]  and we were individual thinking
[2:33:32.740 --> 2:33:35.740]  and so they sold us over to the Democratic Party
[2:33:35.740 --> 2:33:38.740]  and blacks have been subbed to that party
[2:33:38.740 --> 2:33:39.740]  every since
[2:33:39.740 --> 2:33:41.740]  how did that trend come back?
[2:33:41.740 --> 2:33:45.740]  my grandfather came back from World War II, B-17 pilot
[2:33:45.740 --> 2:33:47.740]  and it was a big deal in the family
[2:33:47.740 --> 2:33:48.740]  not because they were racist
[2:33:48.740 --> 2:33:50.740]  but because everybody was Democrats in Texas
[2:33:50.740 --> 2:33:52.740]  he said I believe in racial equality
[2:33:52.740 --> 2:33:53.740]  and I believe in all this
[2:33:53.740 --> 2:33:54.740]  I'm gonna be a Republican
[2:33:54.740 --> 2:33:55.740]  he ran for office, won local office
[2:33:55.740 --> 2:33:57.740]  and then later everybody went Republican
[2:33:57.740 --> 2:33:58.740]  that was under Eisenhower
[2:33:58.740 --> 2:34:00.740]  but how did the switch happen where suddenly
[2:34:00.740 --> 2:34:02.740]  the party of Lincoln is the KKK
[2:34:02.740 --> 2:34:05.740]  and the party of the KKK is the party of Lincoln?
[2:34:05.740 --> 2:34:08.740]  well number one as I said
[2:34:08.740 --> 2:34:10.740]  Martin Luther King and all those guys
[2:34:10.740 --> 2:34:12.740]  sold the blacks to the Democratic Party
[2:34:12.740 --> 2:34:15.740]  and then the media and the race hustlers
[2:34:15.740 --> 2:34:18.740]  the black race hustlers start accusing the white part
[2:34:18.740 --> 2:34:20.740]  the Republican party of being white
[2:34:20.740 --> 2:34:22.740]  and they were saying things like
[2:34:22.740 --> 2:34:25.740]  all the Democrats went over to the Republican Party
[2:34:25.740 --> 2:34:28.740]  and those are the people who are controlling the blacks
[2:34:28.740 --> 2:34:29.740]  or hate the blacks
[2:34:29.740 --> 2:34:31.740]  and don't want them to be a part of the Republican Party
[2:34:31.740 --> 2:34:33.740]  and the blacks fail for it
[2:34:33.740 --> 2:34:35.740]  the media start lying to them
[2:34:35.740 --> 2:34:38.740]  and if you notice anyone in this country
[2:34:38.740 --> 2:34:40.740]  who want to cause destruction
[2:34:40.740 --> 2:34:42.740]  anytime you want to bring hate
[2:34:42.740 --> 2:34:44.740]  and destruction into this country
[2:34:44.740 --> 2:34:46.740]  all you have to do is hire a black
[2:34:46.740 --> 2:34:49.740]  the blacks would be happy to join forces with you
[2:34:49.740 --> 2:34:51.740]  if it's killing the unborn child
[2:34:51.740 --> 2:34:53.740]  if it's accepting same sex marriage
[2:34:53.740 --> 2:34:55.740]  if it's hating a marriage
[2:34:55.740 --> 2:34:57.740]  tearing down the flags and all that
[2:34:57.740 --> 2:34:59.740]  most, not all, not all, not all, not all, not all
[2:34:59.740 --> 2:35:02.740]  but most black people now on the side of evil
[2:35:02.740 --> 2:35:03.740]  rather than good
[2:35:03.740 --> 2:35:05.740]  it wasn't like that when I was born
[2:35:05.740 --> 2:35:08.740]  James not criticized China with 3 million Muslims
[2:35:08.740 --> 2:35:09.740]  and death camps
[2:35:09.740 --> 2:35:11.740]  a million Christians and Buddhists and death camps
[2:35:11.740 --> 2:35:12.740]  on record
[2:35:12.740 --> 2:35:13.740]  he won't say a word about that
[2:35:13.740 --> 2:35:16.740]  but he says America sucks
[2:35:16.740 --> 2:35:19.740]  yeah, Christianity is the most
[2:35:19.740 --> 2:35:21.740]  hated religion on this side of heaven
[2:35:21.740 --> 2:35:24.740]  and number one the blacks hate it
[2:35:24.740 --> 2:35:27.740]  because they've been told that it's the white man religion
[2:35:27.740 --> 2:35:29.740]  so because they hate white people
[2:35:29.740 --> 2:35:30.740]  they hate Christianity
[2:35:30.740 --> 2:35:32.740]  and I see that happening more and more
[2:35:32.740 --> 2:35:34.740]  in this country right now
[2:35:34.740 --> 2:35:36.740]  and you see around the world
[2:35:36.740 --> 2:35:38.740]  Christians are under attack
[2:35:38.740 --> 2:35:40.740]  and there's no discussion about it
[2:35:40.740 --> 2:35:42.740]  because it's the white man religion
[2:35:42.740 --> 2:35:45.740]  it's not true but that's what the people have been told
[2:35:45.740 --> 2:35:48.740]  that's why white Americans gotta start speaking up
[2:35:48.740 --> 2:35:49.740]  before it's too late
[2:35:49.740 --> 2:35:52.740]  if ever there were a time to speak up
[2:35:52.740 --> 2:35:53.740]  it's now
[2:35:53.740 --> 2:35:57.740]  look how they're doing this with the so-called Chinese virus thing
[2:35:57.740 --> 2:36:00.740]  this thing is not as bad as they're pretending
[2:36:00.740 --> 2:36:02.740]  but what the Democrats have realized
[2:36:02.740 --> 2:36:03.740]  and the right or Republicans
[2:36:03.740 --> 2:36:05.740]  is that they can control the people
[2:36:05.740 --> 2:36:07.740]  they can put a mask on
[2:36:07.740 --> 2:36:10.740]  they can make you stay home for months
[2:36:10.740 --> 2:36:11.740]  and lose your businesses
[2:36:11.740 --> 2:36:13.740]  and have to depend on the government
[2:36:13.740 --> 2:36:16.740]  they can tell you when and when not to
[2:36:16.740 --> 2:36:19.740]  they can teach you you're not essential
[2:36:19.740 --> 2:36:20.740]  all the big corporations are
[2:36:20.740 --> 2:36:21.740]  it's not about racism
[2:36:21.740 --> 2:36:23.740]  or inequity or a new class
[2:36:23.740 --> 2:36:25.740]  all these big companies are essential
[2:36:25.740 --> 2:36:26.740]  but we're not
[2:36:26.740 --> 2:36:27.740]  right
[2:36:27.740 --> 2:36:30.740]  and our business are probably more essential than theirs
[2:36:30.740 --> 2:36:32.740]  because we are small businesses
[2:36:32.740 --> 2:36:34.740]  and small businesses are very valuable
[2:36:34.740 --> 2:36:36.740]  to the communities
[2:36:36.740 --> 2:36:37.740]  to the neighborhoods
[2:36:37.740 --> 2:36:39.740]  and they don't want that around Alice
[2:36:39.740 --> 2:36:41.740]  they want to control us
[2:36:41.740 --> 2:36:44.740]  this is about getting President Trump out of the White House
[2:36:44.740 --> 2:36:46.740]  because if they can get rid of him
[2:36:46.740 --> 2:36:49.740]  then they can turn the country into a socialist society
[2:36:49.740 --> 2:36:52.740]  let's talk about what happens if they get rid of Trump
[2:36:52.740 --> 2:36:53.740]  but I agree with you
[2:36:53.740 --> 2:36:54.740]  when I'm driving through places now
[2:36:54.740 --> 2:36:56.740]  I just pull in little places and get stuff
[2:36:56.740 --> 2:36:58.740]  because they literally
[2:36:58.740 --> 2:36:59.740]  they say thank you for being here
[2:36:59.740 --> 2:37:00.740]  we're about to go bankrupt
[2:37:00.740 --> 2:37:03.740]  it's so obvious what's happening
[2:37:03.740 --> 2:37:04.740]  that's right
[2:37:04.740 --> 2:37:06.740]  if they get rid of President Trump
[2:37:06.740 --> 2:37:08.740]  and again I call him the very white hope
[2:37:08.740 --> 2:37:10.740]  we're going to have a socialist society
[2:37:10.740 --> 2:37:13.740]  white people homes and land
[2:37:13.740 --> 2:37:15.740]  and we'll be taken away from them
[2:37:15.740 --> 2:37:17.740]  and there will be no law to protect them from it
[2:37:17.740 --> 2:37:18.740]  they're going to ban
[2:37:18.740 --> 2:37:21.740]  they want to ban out a second amendment
[2:37:21.740 --> 2:37:22.740]  right to bear arm
[2:37:22.740 --> 2:37:24.740]  they don't want us speaking the truth
[2:37:24.740 --> 2:37:26.740]  they don't want a second opinion
[2:37:26.740 --> 2:37:27.740]  they don't want the truth out there
[2:37:27.740 --> 2:37:28.740]  they want the lie
[2:37:28.740 --> 2:37:30.740]  because the lie deceiving
[2:37:30.740 --> 2:37:31.740]  you can control people
[2:37:31.740 --> 2:37:32.740]  when you lie to them
[2:37:32.740 --> 2:37:33.740]  but if they're
[2:37:33.740 --> 2:37:35.740]  if people are above the truth
[2:37:35.740 --> 2:37:36.740]  you cannot control them
[2:37:36.740 --> 2:37:39.740]  and so that's all going to end
[2:37:39.740 --> 2:37:41.740]  if these people should take over
[2:37:41.740 --> 2:37:43.740]  we cannot let President Trump
[2:37:43.740 --> 2:37:45.740]  we cannot allow them
[2:37:45.740 --> 2:37:46.740]  you're absolutely right
[2:37:46.740 --> 2:37:48.740]  let's talk about it with Jesse Lee Peterson
[2:37:48.740 --> 2:37:49.740]  they're right back
[2:37:49.740 --> 2:38:12.740]  stay with us on Momic Shows

[2:38:57.740 --> 2:38:59.740]  I have never been so concerned
[2:38:59.740 --> 2:39:00.740]  about what's going on
[2:39:00.740 --> 2:39:02.740]  this is all martial law prepping
[2:39:02.740 --> 2:39:03.740]  martial law training
[2:39:03.740 --> 2:39:04.740]  and now they have activated
[2:39:04.740 --> 2:39:05.740]  the most criminal elements
[2:39:05.740 --> 2:39:06.740]  the deep state
[2:39:06.740 --> 2:39:07.740]  and Pelosi is bragging
[2:39:07.740 --> 2:39:08.740]  they're going to remove
[2:39:08.740 --> 2:39:11.740]  the president illegally with COG
[2:39:11.740 --> 2:39:13.740]  you cannot remove the president with COG
[2:39:13.740 --> 2:39:14.740]  you can remove the president
[2:39:14.740 --> 2:39:16.740]  25th amendment or impeachment
[2:39:16.740 --> 2:39:18.740]  they're saying they're going to do it
[2:39:18.740 --> 2:39:19.740]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:39:19.740 --> 2:39:21.740]  they are putting this in every newspaper in the country
[2:39:21.740 --> 2:39:23.740]  and legitimizing the fact
[2:39:23.740 --> 2:39:25.740]  that if he can test the election in any way
[2:39:25.740 --> 2:39:27.740]  when they say by default they are
[2:39:27.740 --> 2:39:28.740]  that they're going to pull this
[2:39:28.740 --> 2:39:31.740]  this is maximum, maximum alert
[2:39:31.740 --> 2:39:32.740]  this is emergency alert
[2:39:32.740 --> 2:39:34.740]  yes they've censored the patriots off most of the internet
[2:39:34.740 --> 2:39:36.740]  but banned video is still there
[2:39:36.740 --> 2:39:37.740]  the radio show is still there
[2:39:37.740 --> 2:39:39.740]  and yes we're getting about five times the traffic
[2:39:39.740 --> 2:39:40.740]  we were getting before the ban
[2:39:40.740 --> 2:39:41.740]  to the actual sites
[2:39:41.740 --> 2:39:43.740]  but we need to get this message
[2:39:43.740 --> 2:39:45.740]  to other people outside of our audience
[2:39:45.740 --> 2:39:48.740]  to tell everyone now about the martial law plan
[2:39:48.740 --> 2:39:49.740]  and the plan to get rid of Trump
[2:39:49.740 --> 2:39:51.740]  it's all posted at banned.video
[2:39:51.740 --> 2:39:53.740]  please we can defeat these people
[2:39:53.740 --> 2:39:54.740]  if you take action
[2:39:54.740 --> 2:39:55.740]  you are the answer
[2:39:55.740 --> 2:39:58.740]  please, please, please
[2:39:58.740 --> 2:40:00.740]  a lot of you have been listening
[2:40:00.740 --> 2:40:01.740]  for more than 20 years
[2:40:01.740 --> 2:40:03.740]  and if you go back to those shows
[2:40:03.740 --> 2:40:06.740]  we laid out the AI takeover plan
[2:40:06.740 --> 2:40:07.740]  the tracking of cell phones
[2:40:07.740 --> 2:40:10.740]  how programmed master computers
[2:40:10.740 --> 2:40:12.740]  would manipulate control society
[2:40:12.740 --> 2:40:14.740]  how they'd be able to not just predict
[2:40:14.740 --> 2:40:16.740]  large groups of human movements
[2:40:16.740 --> 2:40:17.740]  and activities
[2:40:17.740 --> 2:40:19.740]  but even predict what individuals would do
[2:40:19.740 --> 2:40:20.740]  and then once you could predict
[2:40:20.740 --> 2:40:22.740]  what individuals were going to be doing
[2:40:22.740 --> 2:40:24.740]  you could add stimuli
[2:40:24.740 --> 2:40:26.740]  through the AI systems
[2:40:26.740 --> 2:40:27.740]  through the computers
[2:40:27.740 --> 2:40:28.740]  through digital billboards
[2:40:28.740 --> 2:40:29.740]  through face scanning
[2:40:29.740 --> 2:40:31.740]  through the social credit score
[2:40:31.740 --> 2:40:32.740]  to control people
[2:40:32.740 --> 2:40:34.740]  and make them act like you wanted to
[2:40:34.740 --> 2:40:35.740]  but when we cover that
[2:40:35.740 --> 2:40:37.740]  the media would attack us and say
[2:40:37.740 --> 2:40:38.740]  we were making it up
[2:40:38.740 --> 2:40:39.740]  it was a conspiracy theory
[2:40:39.740 --> 2:40:42.740]  even though it was in the actual corporate level
[2:40:42.740 --> 2:40:44.740]  blueprint documents
[2:40:44.740 --> 2:40:46.740]  well the next level of the blueprint documents
[2:40:46.740 --> 2:40:48.740]  explained to us that they are setting up
[2:40:48.740 --> 2:40:49.740]  this control system
[2:40:49.740 --> 2:40:50.740]  to make humans obsolete
[2:40:50.740 --> 2:40:52.740]  and phase us out
[2:40:52.740 --> 2:40:54.740]  and it's something about a thousand times crazier
[2:40:54.740 --> 2:40:55.740]  than what Hitler planned
[2:40:55.740 --> 2:40:58.740]  so we might want to dismantle the system now
[2:40:58.740 --> 2:41:01.740]  it was in the telecommunications act of 1996
[2:41:01.740 --> 2:41:02.740]  that all new cell phones
[2:41:02.740 --> 2:41:05.740]  would track your GPS location
[2:41:05.740 --> 2:41:07.740]  I read from the federal law
[2:41:07.740 --> 2:41:08.740]  and listeners couldn't believe me
[2:41:08.740 --> 2:41:10.740]  because that was un-American
[2:41:10.740 --> 2:41:13.740]  now the media admits that almost every app
[2:41:13.740 --> 2:41:14.740]  and every company
[2:41:14.740 --> 2:41:16.740]  that are on Apple and Androids
[2:41:16.740 --> 2:41:18.740]  don't just track your location
[2:41:18.740 --> 2:41:19.740]  but your surfing history
[2:41:19.740 --> 2:41:20.740]  where you go
[2:41:20.740 --> 2:41:21.740]  who you talk to
[2:41:21.740 --> 2:41:22.740]  your relationships
[2:41:22.740 --> 2:41:25.740]  and they all share the data with each other
[2:41:25.740 --> 2:41:27.740]  of what you're doing on the apps as well
[2:41:27.740 --> 2:41:29.740]  including having apps turn on
[2:41:29.740 --> 2:41:31.740]  and listen to what you're saying
[2:41:31.740 --> 2:41:33.740]  just like Siri or Alexa do
[2:41:33.740 --> 2:41:35.740]  and then putting databases
[2:41:35.740 --> 2:41:37.740]  transcripts of everything you say
[2:41:37.740 --> 2:41:40.740]  into those systems to be saved forever
[2:41:40.740 --> 2:41:41.740]  your phone is spying on you
[2:41:41.740 --> 2:41:44.740]  and companies are generating secret surveillance scores
[2:41:44.740 --> 2:41:45.740]  based on information
[2:41:45.740 --> 2:41:48.740]  this is the global Chinese communist social credit score

[2:42:52.740 --> 2:42:55.740]  was saying earlier is they don't want history taught
[2:42:55.740 --> 2:42:57.740]  because if you look at the West
[2:42:57.740 --> 2:42:58.740]  who we've had our own problems
[2:42:58.740 --> 2:42:59.740]  Lord knows we're evil
[2:42:59.740 --> 2:43:00.740]  we're falling
[2:43:00.740 --> 2:43:02.740]  compared to other places
[2:43:02.740 --> 2:43:05.740]  we pioneered trying to stop slavery
[2:43:05.740 --> 2:43:08.740]  and pioneered empowering women and children
[2:43:08.740 --> 2:43:10.740]  everybody else
[2:43:10.740 --> 2:43:11.740]  Jesse Lee Peterson is here
[2:43:11.740 --> 2:43:13.740]  he's got some of the solutions
[2:43:13.740 --> 2:43:15.740]  he's reached over a billion people in his work
[2:43:15.740 --> 2:43:18.740]  the antidote to all the chaos in inner cities
[2:43:18.740 --> 2:43:20.740]  let's cut to the chase on that
[2:43:20.740 --> 2:43:21.740]  what do we need to do
[2:43:21.740 --> 2:43:23.740]  what does Trump need to do
[2:43:23.740 --> 2:43:24.740]  what do I need to do
[2:43:24.740 --> 2:43:27.740]  number one Alice is a really good question
[2:43:27.740 --> 2:43:29.740]  I remember I thought about it during the break
[2:43:29.740 --> 2:43:32.740]  when the way they took over black people
[2:43:32.740 --> 2:43:34.740]  the number one way they took over the lives
[2:43:34.740 --> 2:43:35.740]  of black Americans
[2:43:35.740 --> 2:43:37.740]  was to get rid of the fathers
[2:43:37.740 --> 2:43:38.740]  when I was growing up
[2:43:38.740 --> 2:43:41.740]  there were fathers and grandfathers around
[2:43:41.740 --> 2:43:44.740]  I grew up around my fathers and grandfathers
[2:43:44.740 --> 2:43:45.740]  but what happened was
[2:43:45.740 --> 2:43:47.740]  they worked on the black man
[2:43:47.740 --> 2:43:49.740]  until they finally got him out of the home
[2:43:49.740 --> 2:43:53.740]  and the government replaced the man inside the home
[2:43:53.740 --> 2:43:54.740]  and once they did that
[2:43:54.740 --> 2:43:56.740]  they took over the women and children
[2:43:56.740 --> 2:43:58.740]  and it's just not been the same since
[2:43:58.740 --> 2:44:00.740]  there's an order to life
[2:44:00.740 --> 2:44:01.740]  and that order
[2:44:01.740 --> 2:44:02.740]  whether we know it or not
[2:44:02.740 --> 2:44:04.740]  like it or not accepted or agreed to it
[2:44:04.740 --> 2:44:06.740]  God in Christ, Christ in man
[2:44:06.740 --> 2:44:09.740]  man over woman and woman over children
[2:44:09.740 --> 2:44:11.740]  the love come from God through Christ
[2:44:11.740 --> 2:44:13.740]  through the man through the woman to the children
[2:44:13.740 --> 2:44:14.740]  and that's a perfect order
[2:44:14.740 --> 2:44:16.740]  and that order works
[2:44:16.740 --> 2:44:18.740]  and you can't brainwash people
[2:44:18.740 --> 2:44:20.740]  and use them for your personal gain
[2:44:20.740 --> 2:44:22.740]  when they grow up under that order
[2:44:22.740 --> 2:44:24.740]  so let's talk about that
[2:44:24.740 --> 2:44:26.740]  and men are willing to die for their women
[2:44:26.740 --> 2:44:27.740]  die for their children
[2:44:27.740 --> 2:44:28.740]  doesn't mean the women don't have power
[2:44:28.740 --> 2:44:29.740]  but let's explain
[2:44:29.740 --> 2:44:30.740]  Hitler said
[2:44:30.740 --> 2:44:32.740]  first you get the women
[2:44:32.740 --> 2:44:33.740]  then you've got the children
[2:44:33.740 --> 2:44:34.740]  so follow the men
[2:44:34.740 --> 2:44:35.740]  my dad grew up in East Texas
[2:44:35.740 --> 2:44:37.740]  when Jim Crow and all that was going out
[2:44:37.740 --> 2:44:39.740]  and his dad was standing up to it
[2:44:39.740 --> 2:44:40.740]  but he said it was crazy
[2:44:40.740 --> 2:44:41.740]  he said
[2:44:41.740 --> 2:44:43.740]  we're not defending segregation
[2:44:43.740 --> 2:44:44.740]  but they replaced one thing
[2:44:44.740 --> 2:44:45.740]  with something even more evil
[2:44:45.740 --> 2:44:46.740]  black people he said
[2:44:46.740 --> 2:44:48.740]  dressed as sharp as anybody
[2:44:48.740 --> 2:44:50.740]  they owned hotels, businesses
[2:44:50.740 --> 2:44:52.740]  they were in charge of themselves
[2:44:52.740 --> 2:44:53.740]  under that oppression
[2:44:53.740 --> 2:44:55.740]  and as soon as the money came in
[2:44:55.740 --> 2:44:56.740]  to end the family
[2:44:56.740 --> 2:44:57.740]  it all disintegrated
[2:44:57.740 --> 2:44:59.740]  and of course the LBJ wrote letters bragging
[2:44:59.740 --> 2:45:00.740]  he said
[2:45:00.740 --> 2:45:02.740]  my great society will destroy the black people
[2:45:02.740 --> 2:45:04.740]  it'll make them slaves
[2:45:04.740 --> 2:45:06.740]  and so as soon as they got the men out
[2:45:06.740 --> 2:45:08.740]  which is the feminist message
[2:45:08.740 --> 2:45:09.740]  the black lives matter message
[2:45:09.740 --> 2:45:10.740]  get rid of Hitler family
[2:45:10.740 --> 2:45:12.740]  now it's a bunch of women and children
[2:45:12.740 --> 2:45:13.740]  the government can control
[2:45:13.740 --> 2:45:14.740]  I mean it's very obvious
[2:45:14.740 --> 2:45:16.740]  that when you're enslaving a group
[2:45:16.740 --> 2:45:17.740]  you don't want to have warriors
[2:45:17.740 --> 2:45:19.740]  men to defend them
[2:45:19.740 --> 2:45:20.740]  that's right
[2:45:20.740 --> 2:45:21.740]  anytime you're at war
[2:45:21.740 --> 2:45:23.740]  if you're attacked by another country
[2:45:23.740 --> 2:45:25.740]  they're gonna go after the men first
[2:45:25.740 --> 2:45:27.740]  because the power is in demand
[2:45:27.740 --> 2:45:28.740]  and they know that
[2:45:28.740 --> 2:45:30.740]  so they got to get rid of him
[2:45:30.740 --> 2:45:32.740]  and that's what they did to black Americans
[2:45:32.740 --> 2:45:34.740]  they replaced the man with government
[2:45:34.740 --> 2:45:35.740]  as you said
[2:45:35.740 --> 2:45:36.740]  and now it's been down here
[2:45:36.740 --> 2:45:38.740]  for black women and children
[2:45:38.740 --> 2:45:39.740]  if you notice Alice
[2:45:39.740 --> 2:45:41.740]  they're doing the same thing to the white man
[2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:43.740]  and I've been saying for years
[2:45:43.740 --> 2:45:44.740]  to white men
[2:45:44.740 --> 2:45:45.740]  you got to protect your family
[2:45:45.740 --> 2:45:46.740]  you got to speak up
[2:45:46.740 --> 2:45:48.740]  because they're trying to turn your family
[2:45:48.740 --> 2:45:49.740]  against you
[2:45:49.740 --> 2:45:51.740]  if they can get rid of the white man
[2:45:51.740 --> 2:45:53.740]  it's going to be easy to
[2:45:53.740 --> 2:45:54.740]  destroy the country
[2:45:54.740 --> 2:45:57.740]  if you talk to your wife and children
[2:45:57.740 --> 2:45:59.740]  before they get them about it
[2:45:59.740 --> 2:46:00.740]  they get it and come tell you
[2:46:00.740 --> 2:46:01.740]  but if you never know about it
[2:46:01.740 --> 2:46:03.740]  they're going to turn against you
[2:46:03.740 --> 2:46:05.740]  how do you get to where your wife and your children
[2:46:05.740 --> 2:46:06.740]  understand this
[2:46:06.740 --> 2:46:08.740]  you have to be right and do right
[2:46:08.740 --> 2:46:10.740]  you have to be a man of character
[2:46:10.740 --> 2:46:12.740]  and when your wife and kids see that
[2:46:12.740 --> 2:46:15.740]  they're going to see the light of God inside of you
[2:46:15.740 --> 2:46:17.740]  and that will draw them unto you
[2:46:17.740 --> 2:46:19.740]  and you can guide them in the right way
[2:46:19.740 --> 2:46:20.740]  so you got to be a servant
[2:46:20.740 --> 2:46:22.740]  you got to get them to do the right thing
[2:46:22.740 --> 2:46:23.740]  but you got to carry out the trash
[2:46:23.740 --> 2:46:24.740]  help them cook the dinner
[2:46:24.740 --> 2:46:25.740]  be there for them
[2:46:25.740 --> 2:46:26.740]  not just watch sports all day
[2:46:26.740 --> 2:46:28.740]  you got to serve them
[2:46:28.740 --> 2:46:29.740]  they'll serve you
[2:46:29.740 --> 2:46:30.740]  you got to be right
[2:46:30.740 --> 2:46:32.740]  in order for them to do right
[2:46:32.740 --> 2:46:34.740]  because if you're right
[2:46:34.740 --> 2:46:36.740]  women love men who love what's right
[2:46:36.740 --> 2:46:38.740]  with all their heart, soul and might
[2:46:38.740 --> 2:46:39.740]  they trust that kind of man
[2:46:39.740 --> 2:46:40.740]  and they will follow that man
[2:46:40.740 --> 2:46:42.740]  likewise the children will follow the mother
[2:46:42.740 --> 2:46:43.740]  things will be fine
[2:46:43.740 --> 2:46:46.740]  but if the man is not of righteousness
[2:46:46.740 --> 2:46:47.740]  if he's not right
[2:46:47.740 --> 2:46:49.740]  he's not going to be able to guide his wife
[2:46:49.740 --> 2:46:51.740]  and children in the right way to go
[2:46:51.740 --> 2:46:53.740]  and it's not about who's better than it
[2:46:53.740 --> 2:46:55.740]  it's just the order of God
[2:46:55.740 --> 2:46:57.740]  that's why he ordained a family
[2:46:57.740 --> 2:46:59.740]  he created man and woman
[2:46:59.740 --> 2:47:02.740]  and he married them under his umbrella
[2:47:02.740 --> 2:47:03.740]  so that he could guide them
[2:47:03.740 --> 2:47:05.740]  but when you break that order
[2:47:05.740 --> 2:47:06.740]  by getting rid of the man
[2:47:06.740 --> 2:47:08.740]  then there's no light
[2:47:08.740 --> 2:47:10.740]  there's no love there to protect the woman
[2:47:10.740 --> 2:47:11.740]  a woman need to know that
[2:47:11.740 --> 2:47:12.740]  when the man's gone
[2:47:12.740 --> 2:47:13.740]  whoever's in power is now
[2:47:13.740 --> 2:47:15.740]  whether it's Stalin, Hitler or Mao
[2:47:15.740 --> 2:47:16.740]  or Nancy Pelosi
[2:47:16.740 --> 2:47:18.740]  that's now your husband
[2:47:18.740 --> 2:47:19.740]  that's right
[2:47:19.740 --> 2:47:20.740]  and that's a raw husband
[2:47:20.740 --> 2:47:21.740]  you don't want that one
[2:47:21.740 --> 2:47:22.740]  we have to be
[2:47:22.740 --> 2:47:24.740]  we have to reestablish the family
[2:47:24.740 --> 2:47:26.740]  and I'm saying to white men
[2:47:26.740 --> 2:47:28.740]  you cannot give into this crap
[2:47:28.740 --> 2:47:30.740]  don't let them take over the minds
[2:47:30.740 --> 2:47:32.740]  and hearts of your children
[2:47:32.740 --> 2:47:33.740]  look what happened
[2:47:33.740 --> 2:47:35.740]  as they sent the kids off to school
[2:47:35.740 --> 2:47:38.740]  and now the white kids have become antifa
[2:47:38.740 --> 2:47:41.740]  they have no business being a part of antifa
[2:47:41.740 --> 2:47:43.740]  but the education system have turned them
[2:47:43.740 --> 2:47:44.740]  against the father
[2:47:44.740 --> 2:47:45.740]  against the family
[2:47:45.740 --> 2:47:47.740]  and now they love evil
[2:47:47.740 --> 2:47:48.740]  and hate good
[2:47:48.740 --> 2:47:50.740]  we've got to restore that family
[2:47:50.740 --> 2:47:52.740]  it's man and woman getting married
[2:47:52.740 --> 2:47:54.740]  having children, being there for your family
[2:47:54.740 --> 2:47:55.740]  and guiding them
[2:47:55.740 --> 2:47:57.740]  protecting them in the right way to go
[2:47:57.740 --> 2:47:59.740]  and don't let the educational system
[2:47:59.740 --> 2:48:01.740]  which is a government system
[2:48:01.740 --> 2:48:03.740]  corrupt the hearts and minds of your kids
[2:48:03.740 --> 2:48:05.740]  they have the kids having sex
[2:48:05.740 --> 2:48:07.740]  out of wet lot smoking pot
[2:48:07.740 --> 2:48:09.740]  they pushing everything that's wrong
[2:48:09.740 --> 2:48:11.740]  living together before marriage
[2:48:11.740 --> 2:48:14.740]  when they can destroy your character
[2:48:14.740 --> 2:48:16.740]  then you have nothing to stand on
[2:48:16.740 --> 2:48:17.740]  but when you are a man or woman
[2:48:17.740 --> 2:48:19.740]  or morality of character
[2:48:19.740 --> 2:48:21.740]  you have a solid foundation
[2:48:21.740 --> 2:48:23.740]  and you cannot be deceived
[2:48:23.740 --> 2:48:25.740]  by the children of the lie
[2:48:25.740 --> 2:48:27.740]  and the children of the lie deliver media
[2:48:27.740 --> 2:48:29.740]  the democratic party
[2:48:29.740 --> 2:48:30.740]  the black race hustlers
[2:48:30.740 --> 2:48:32.740]  the right old republicans
[2:48:32.740 --> 2:48:33.740]  and the never troppers
[2:48:33.740 --> 2:48:35.740]  they are the children of the lie
[2:48:35.740 --> 2:48:37.740]  they are feeding the minds of the children
[2:48:37.740 --> 2:48:39.740]  the parents should prevent that from happening
[2:48:39.740 --> 2:48:41.740]  Jesse Lee Peterson
[2:48:41.740 --> 2:48:43.740]  when you were first starting out
[2:48:43.740 --> 2:48:44.740]  I knew about you 25 years ago
[2:48:44.740 --> 2:48:45.740]  how long you been on there
[2:48:45.740 --> 2:48:47.740]  30 years now
[2:48:47.740 --> 2:48:48.740]  it's amazing
[2:48:48.740 --> 2:48:50.740]  well what you said is all prophetic
[2:48:50.740 --> 2:48:52.740]  it's happening now
[2:48:52.740 --> 2:48:54.740]  but a long time ago
[2:48:54.740 --> 2:48:55.740]  we were really under the gun
[2:48:55.740 --> 2:48:57.740]  people weren't listening to us now
[2:48:57.740 --> 2:48:58.740]  I don't want to be too positive
[2:48:58.740 --> 2:48:59.740]  but man people are really listening now
[2:48:59.740 --> 2:49:00.740]  aren't they
[2:49:00.740 --> 2:49:01.740]  people seem to get it
[2:49:01.740 --> 2:49:02.740]  women seem to get it
[2:49:02.740 --> 2:49:03.740]  men seem to get it
[2:49:03.740 --> 2:49:05.740]  but men just can't say they're the leader
[2:49:05.740 --> 2:49:06.740]  they gotta need to be the leader
[2:49:06.740 --> 2:49:08.740]  that means they're gonna work two jobs
[2:49:08.740 --> 2:49:10.740]  they're gonna take care of kids when they're sick
[2:49:10.740 --> 2:49:11.740]  they're gonna bust their ass
[2:49:11.740 --> 2:49:12.740]  I mean being a leader means
[2:49:12.740 --> 2:49:14.740]  you're gonna work your ass off
[2:49:14.740 --> 2:49:16.740]  not sit back and watch sports
[2:49:16.740 --> 2:49:17.740]  you have to be the example
[2:49:17.740 --> 2:49:19.740]  of what you want your family to become
[2:49:19.740 --> 2:49:21.740]  because they're looking at you
[2:49:21.740 --> 2:49:23.740]  and whatever you are is what they will become
[2:49:23.740 --> 2:49:25.740]  so the men have to be that
[2:49:25.740 --> 2:49:26.740]  and they have to be men
[2:49:26.740 --> 2:49:28.740]  it's okay to be men
[2:49:28.740 --> 2:49:30.740]  it's okay to be a man right
[2:49:30.740 --> 2:49:32.740]  and so we appointed them back to the soil
[2:49:32.740 --> 2:49:34.740]  they gotta return to the fathers
[2:49:34.740 --> 2:49:36.740]  they gotta forgive the mothers for the mistakes
[2:49:36.740 --> 2:49:37.740]  that they've made with them
[2:49:37.740 --> 2:49:38.740]  love their fathers
[2:49:38.740 --> 2:49:40.740]  and through the love of your earthly father
[2:49:40.740 --> 2:49:41.740]  you can love God
[2:49:41.740 --> 2:49:44.740]  and in that your nature will be created
[2:49:44.740 --> 2:49:45.740]  in the image of God
[2:49:45.740 --> 2:49:47.740]  and it would be amazing Alice
[2:49:47.740 --> 2:49:50.740]  when I was growing up under the Jeremy Crow laws
[2:49:50.740 --> 2:49:52.740]  I have an aunt who got married
[2:49:52.740 --> 2:49:54.740]  they had like 14 or 15 children
[2:49:54.740 --> 2:49:56.740]  they own their own land
[2:49:56.740 --> 2:49:59.740]  they sent all 14 or 15 years
[2:49:59.740 --> 2:50:01.740]  15 of their children to college
[2:50:01.740 --> 2:50:03.740]  they're all professionals
[2:50:03.740 --> 2:50:05.740]  even though I don't push college a lot
[2:50:05.740 --> 2:50:07.740]  I think that trade is better than college
[2:50:07.740 --> 2:50:08.740]  what you're saying is in an under an evil system
[2:50:08.740 --> 2:50:09.740]  that still had family
[2:50:09.740 --> 2:50:11.740]  they got stronger as Nietzsche said
[2:50:11.740 --> 2:50:13.740]  that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger
[2:50:13.740 --> 2:50:15.740]  they wanna make you a victim
[2:50:15.740 --> 2:50:17.740]  you come to them so they can run things
[2:50:17.740 --> 2:50:18.740]  and then you get nothing
[2:50:18.740 --> 2:50:22.740]  you're saying under Jim Crow Southern oppression
[2:50:22.740 --> 2:50:23.740]  they left the family alone
[2:50:23.740 --> 2:50:24.740]  you still got stronger
[2:50:24.740 --> 2:50:26.740]  but under their sneaky evil liberalism
[2:50:26.740 --> 2:50:28.740]  everybody dies
[2:50:28.740 --> 2:50:29.740]  absolutely
[2:50:29.740 --> 2:50:30.740]  my aunts and uncles
[2:50:30.740 --> 2:50:32.740]  when they all became young adults
[2:50:32.740 --> 2:50:35.740]  they moved off to other parts of Alabama
[2:50:35.740 --> 2:50:37.740]  Florida, Indiana, those places
[2:50:37.740 --> 2:50:39.740]  they got jobs
[2:50:39.740 --> 2:50:40.740]  they bought homes
[2:50:40.740 --> 2:50:41.740]  they got married
[2:50:41.740 --> 2:50:42.740]  they had families
[2:50:42.740 --> 2:50:43.740]  no one
[2:50:43.740 --> 2:50:45.740]  because they knew they were being oppressed
[2:50:45.740 --> 2:50:47.740]  so they decided to fight and be strong
[2:50:47.740 --> 2:50:49.740]  instead of saying I'm a loser
[2:50:49.740 --> 2:50:51.740]  I'm gonna roll over and die
[2:50:51.740 --> 2:50:52.740]  yeah but when we were growing up
[2:50:52.740 --> 2:50:54.740]  I didn't know anything about oppression
[2:50:54.740 --> 2:50:56.740]  we were not oppressed
[2:50:56.740 --> 2:50:57.740]  we love what was right
[2:50:57.740 --> 2:50:58.740]  we had families
[2:50:58.740 --> 2:51:00.740]  we were taught to work
[2:51:00.740 --> 2:51:01.740]  I was told from day one
[2:51:01.740 --> 2:51:03.740]  when I turned 18 years old
[2:51:03.740 --> 2:51:04.740]  I had to leave home
[2:51:04.740 --> 2:51:07.740]  so they taught me how to work
[2:51:07.740 --> 2:51:08.740]  how to be responsible
[2:51:08.740 --> 2:51:09.740]  how to save my money
[2:51:09.740 --> 2:51:11.740]  and so when I turned 18
[2:51:11.740 --> 2:51:13.740]  I remember my grandmother telling me Alice
[2:51:13.740 --> 2:51:15.740]  part of you when you're 18
[2:51:15.740 --> 2:51:16.740]  you're out of here
[2:51:16.740 --> 2:51:17.740]  I'm like where am I going
[2:51:17.740 --> 2:51:19.740]  she's like I don't know
[2:51:19.740 --> 2:51:20.740]  and I don't care
[2:51:20.740 --> 2:51:21.740]  you're out of here
[2:51:21.740 --> 2:51:22.740]  we were preparing you for it
[2:51:22.740 --> 2:51:23.740]  and when I turned 18
[2:51:23.740 --> 2:51:24.740]  I left home
[2:51:24.740 --> 2:51:25.740]  I haven't looked back
[2:51:25.740 --> 2:51:26.740]  I worked
[2:51:26.740 --> 2:51:27.740]  I went through a lot of stuff
[2:51:27.740 --> 2:51:28.740]  I agree
[2:51:28.740 --> 2:51:30.740]  I'm saying they say that's oppression
[2:51:30.740 --> 2:51:31.740]  we're not defending that system
[2:51:31.740 --> 2:51:32.740]  but at least that system was
[2:51:32.740 --> 2:51:33.740]  a human system
[2:51:33.740 --> 2:51:35.740]  that was making you strong
[2:51:35.740 --> 2:51:36.740]  and just think about the one now
[2:51:36.740 --> 2:51:37.740]  where people have three degrees
[2:51:37.740 --> 2:51:38.740]  but no job
[2:51:38.740 --> 2:51:40.740]  and they're just pissed off
[2:51:40.740 --> 2:51:41.740]  that's right
[2:51:41.740 --> 2:51:44.740]  that word wasn't even heard of man
[2:51:44.740 --> 2:51:45.740]  believe me
[2:51:45.740 --> 2:51:46.740]  because our parents
[2:51:46.740 --> 2:51:48.740]  and our grandparents were the example
[2:51:48.740 --> 2:51:51.740]  and so even though the Jim Crow laws were there
[2:51:51.740 --> 2:51:53.740]  we were not affected by those laws
[2:51:53.740 --> 2:51:55.740]  because whenever we wanted to visit
[2:51:55.740 --> 2:51:56.740]  whomever we wanted to visit
[2:51:56.740 --> 2:51:57.740]  white people, black people
[2:51:57.740 --> 2:51:58.740]  we didn't
[2:51:58.740 --> 2:51:59.740]  because all white people
[2:51:59.740 --> 2:52:01.740]  didn't go for the Jim Crow law
[2:52:01.740 --> 2:52:02.740]  it was just some
[2:52:02.740 --> 2:52:03.740]  not all
[2:52:03.740 --> 2:52:04.740]  and all black people
[2:52:04.740 --> 2:52:05.740]  were falling for it
[2:52:05.740 --> 2:52:06.740]  and hated white people
[2:52:06.740 --> 2:52:07.740]  maybe a few
[2:52:07.740 --> 2:52:08.740]  the point is you didn't take it
[2:52:08.740 --> 2:52:09.740]  your identity as a victim
[2:52:09.740 --> 2:52:11.740]  you decided to be successful
[2:52:11.740 --> 2:52:13.740]  that made you overcome
[2:52:13.740 --> 2:52:14.740]  that's right
[2:52:14.740 --> 2:52:15.740]  because I was raised in that way
[2:52:15.740 --> 2:52:17.740]  my family set that example
[2:52:17.740 --> 2:52:18.740]  and they taught me to work
[2:52:18.740 --> 2:52:19.740]  I bought my first home
[2:52:19.740 --> 2:52:21.740]  when I was 25 years old
[2:52:21.740 --> 2:52:22.740]  because that's what I was told
[2:52:22.740 --> 2:52:24.740]  that we were supposed to do as a adult
[2:52:24.740 --> 2:52:25.740]  you work
[2:52:25.740 --> 2:52:27.740]  you finish high school
[2:52:27.740 --> 2:52:28.740]  get a job
[2:52:28.740 --> 2:52:29.740]  buy yourself a home
[2:52:29.740 --> 2:52:30.740]  if you want a family
[2:52:30.740 --> 2:52:31.740]  get married
[2:52:31.740 --> 2:52:32.740]  and start a family
[2:52:32.740 --> 2:52:33.740]  it was in my system
[2:52:33.740 --> 2:52:34.740]  that's all I knew
[2:52:34.740 --> 2:52:36.740]  and that's the way my life went
[2:52:36.740 --> 2:52:37.740]  I didn't get married
[2:52:37.740 --> 2:52:38.740]  but I did everything else
[2:52:38.740 --> 2:52:39.740]  powerful
[2:52:39.740 --> 2:52:40.740]  and now Black Lives Matter
[2:52:40.740 --> 2:52:41.740]  says don't have a family
[2:52:41.740 --> 2:52:42.740]  we'll be right back
[2:52:42.740 --> 2:52:43.740]  with the fourth hour
[2:52:43.740 --> 2:53:09.740]  stay with us
[2:53:13.740 --> 2:53:15.740]  and that's what made our modern world
[2:53:15.740 --> 2:53:16.740]  that's now been hijacked
[2:53:16.740 --> 2:53:17.740]  by the technocrats
[2:53:17.740 --> 2:53:18.740]  by the globalists
[2:53:18.740 --> 2:53:19.740]  who say humans are ugly
[2:53:19.740 --> 2:53:20.740]  and bad for the earth
[2:53:20.740 --> 2:53:21.740]  and we need to be cold
[2:53:21.740 --> 2:53:22.740]  and dumb down
[2:53:22.740 --> 2:53:24.740]  and put into subgroups
[2:53:24.740 --> 2:53:26.740]  that the elites dominate, manipulate
[2:53:26.740 --> 2:53:27.740]  and command
[2:53:27.740 --> 2:53:28.740]  if we're even lucky enough
[2:53:28.740 --> 2:53:29.740]  to stay alive
[2:53:29.740 --> 2:53:31.740]  and that's what COVID-19 is
[2:53:31.740 --> 2:53:34.740]  a global UN Revolution
[2:53:34.740 --> 2:53:35.740]  against free humanity
[2:53:35.740 --> 2:53:36.740]  against your family
[2:53:36.740 --> 2:53:37.740]  against your family
[2:53:37.740 --> 2:53:38.740]  against your family
[2:53:38.740 --> 2:53:39.740]  against your family
[2:53:39.740 --> 2:53:40.740]  against your family
[2:53:40.740 --> 2:53:41.740]  against your family
[2:53:41.740 --> 2:53:42.740]  against your family
[2:53:42.740 --> 2:53:43.740]  against your family
[2:53:43.740 --> 2:53:44.740]  against prosperity
[2:53:44.740 --> 2:53:45.740]  and against your future
[2:53:45.740 --> 2:53:46.740]  if you don't stand up and fight
[2:53:46.740 --> 2:54:15.740]  what you get
[2:54:16.740 --> 2:54:17.740]  for an entire line
[2:54:17.740 --> 2:54:20.740]  of new cutting-edge products
[2:54:20.740 --> 2:54:21.740]  with the power
[2:54:21.740 --> 2:54:22.740]  to make your life better
[2:54:22.740 --> 2:54:24.740]  support the youth forward
[2:54:24.740 --> 2:54:25.740]  this cleans them up
[2:54:25.740 --> 2:54:27.740]  beautifully does an incredible job
[2:54:27.740 --> 2:54:28.740]  but doesn't damage your teeth
[2:54:28.740 --> 2:54:29.740]  and it's
[2:54:29.740 --> 2:54:30.740]  I believe you're gonna like this
[2:54:30.740 --> 2:54:31.740]  as much as the other toothpaste
[2:54:31.740 --> 2:54:32.740]  maybe even more
[2:54:32.740 --> 2:54:34.740]  over a year ago
[2:54:34.740 --> 2:54:35.740]  I tried charcoal toothpaste
[2:54:35.740 --> 2:54:36.740]  from a major brand
[2:54:36.740 --> 2:54:37.740]  and thought it was amazing
[2:54:37.740 --> 2:54:38.740]  and I went to my dad
[2:54:38.740 --> 2:54:39.740]  and people said
[2:54:39.740 --> 2:54:40.740]  I would like to put out a charcoal toothpaste
[2:54:40.740 --> 2:54:41.740]  it doesn't have all this silicon
[2:54:41.740 --> 2:54:42.740]  and all these fillers
[2:54:42.740 --> 2:54:43.740]  a very strong toothpaste
[2:54:43.740 --> 2:54:45.740]  you've never used anything like it
[2:54:45.740 --> 2:54:47.740]  get yours at m4store.com right now
[2:54:51.740 --> 2:54:54.740]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:55:06.740 --> 2:55:07.740]  welcome back Alex Jones
[2:55:07.740 --> 2:55:08.740]  here with Jesse Lee Peterson
[2:55:08.740 --> 2:55:10.740]  but to get you back to this point
[2:55:10.740 --> 2:55:11.740]  because I studied this actually
[2:55:11.740 --> 2:55:12.740]  and Peter said
[2:55:12.740 --> 2:55:13.740]  he was a fair con
[2:55:13.740 --> 2:55:14.740]  I disagree with a lot of what
[2:55:14.740 --> 2:55:15.740]  was fair con said
[2:55:15.740 --> 2:55:16.740]  one thing was fair con said was
[2:55:16.740 --> 2:55:18.740]  is that black Americans particularly
[2:55:18.740 --> 2:55:19.740]  should have their own banks
[2:55:19.740 --> 2:55:20.740]  their own grocery stores
[2:55:20.740 --> 2:55:22.740]  their own businesses
[2:55:22.740 --> 2:55:24.740]  for their own communities
[2:55:24.740 --> 2:55:25.740]  to have their own strengths
[2:55:25.740 --> 2:55:26.740]  and visit other people's businesses
[2:55:26.740 --> 2:55:27.740]  do that as well
[2:55:27.740 --> 2:55:29.740]  but if you really want to empower people
[2:55:29.740 --> 2:55:31.740]  don't get welfare from the government
[2:55:31.740 --> 2:55:32.740]  create your own society
[2:55:32.740 --> 2:55:33.740]  your own system
[2:55:33.740 --> 2:55:35.740]  and that's what
[2:55:35.740 --> 2:55:37.740]  segregation to Jim Crow created
[2:55:37.740 --> 2:55:38.740]  whether you were in Illinois
[2:55:38.740 --> 2:55:39.740]  or New York
[2:55:39.740 --> 2:55:40.740]  or North Carolina
[2:55:40.740 --> 2:55:41.740]  or Tennessee
[2:55:41.740 --> 2:55:42.740]  or Texas
[2:55:42.740 --> 2:55:44.740]  or Kentucky
[2:55:44.740 --> 2:55:45.740]  or Alabama
[2:55:45.740 --> 2:55:47.740]  was people actually
[2:55:47.740 --> 2:55:48.740]  got successful
[2:55:48.740 --> 2:55:50.740]  because they had their own system
[2:55:50.740 --> 2:55:51.740]  under globalism
[2:55:51.740 --> 2:55:52.740]  we didn't even have our own country
[2:55:52.740 --> 2:55:54.740]  we have the New World Order dictating
[2:55:54.740 --> 2:55:55.740]  Trump's trying to have us
[2:55:55.740 --> 2:55:56.740]  have our own country
[2:55:56.740 --> 2:55:57.740]  and Trump is
[2:55:57.740 --> 2:55:58.740]  believe me
[2:55:58.740 --> 2:55:59.740]  I know him well
[2:55:59.740 --> 2:56:00.740]  and his people
[2:56:00.740 --> 2:56:01.740]  he wants to empower everybody
[2:56:01.740 --> 2:56:02.740]  he doesn't want these divisions
[2:56:02.740 --> 2:56:03.740]  he wants to be the guy that
[2:56:03.740 --> 2:56:04.740]  turns it all around
[2:56:04.740 --> 2:56:05.740]  and brings us together
[2:56:05.740 --> 2:56:06.740]  and so you see the Democrats
[2:56:06.740 --> 2:56:07.740]  pushing the most racist
[2:56:07.740 --> 2:56:09.740]  divisionary systems
[2:56:09.740 --> 2:56:11.740]  I believe in America Jesse Lee Peterson
[2:56:11.740 --> 2:56:13.740]  I believe we're going to
[2:56:13.740 --> 2:56:14.740]  turn against this
[2:56:14.740 --> 2:56:15.740]  I believe Trump's going to win big
[2:56:15.740 --> 2:56:16.740]  what do you think?
[2:56:16.740 --> 2:56:17.740]  I believe so too
[2:56:17.740 --> 2:56:19.740]  I think that the Democrats
[2:56:19.740 --> 2:56:21.740]  are so angry and so blind
[2:56:21.740 --> 2:56:22.740]  that they can't see that
[2:56:22.740 --> 2:56:24.740]  they're exposing themselves
[2:56:24.740 --> 2:56:25.740]  and with all this violence
[2:56:25.740 --> 2:56:27.740]  and all these crime
[2:56:27.740 --> 2:56:28.740]  and stuff that's going on
[2:56:28.740 --> 2:56:30.740]  they are scaring people to death
[2:56:30.740 --> 2:56:31.740]  because they're revealing
[2:56:31.740 --> 2:56:33.740]  who they really are
[2:56:33.740 --> 2:56:35.740]  so I believe that the president
[2:56:35.740 --> 2:56:36.740]  will be re-elected
[2:56:36.740 --> 2:56:38.740]  another four more years
[2:56:38.740 --> 2:56:39.740]  and you mentioned the banks
[2:56:39.740 --> 2:56:40.740]  and things like that
[2:56:40.740 --> 2:56:42.740]  when you're in a community
[2:56:42.740 --> 2:56:44.740]  it's natural
[2:56:44.740 --> 2:56:46.740]  to start a business
[2:56:46.740 --> 2:56:47.740]  it's natural to have a bank
[2:56:47.740 --> 2:56:48.740]  to have a school
[2:56:48.740 --> 2:56:50.740]  to have a store
[2:56:50.740 --> 2:56:52.740]  that's what we did in Alabama
[2:56:52.740 --> 2:56:54.740]  but because black people
[2:56:54.740 --> 2:56:55.740]  and not all, not all, not all,
[2:56:55.740 --> 2:56:56.740]  not all, not all, not all,
[2:56:56.740 --> 2:56:57.740]  but most
[2:56:57.740 --> 2:56:58.740]  they have not
[2:56:58.740 --> 2:56:59.740]  the family have been destroyed
[2:56:59.740 --> 2:57:00.740]  so the fathers are not there
[2:57:00.740 --> 2:57:02.740]  to set that example
[2:57:02.740 --> 2:57:04.740]  if black people were not angry
[2:57:04.740 --> 2:57:06.740]  if they had families
[2:57:06.740 --> 2:57:08.740]  if their parents taught them
[2:57:08.740 --> 2:57:09.740]  to work
[2:57:09.740 --> 2:57:11.740]  you would naturally have businesses
[2:57:11.740 --> 2:57:13.740]  in the black community
[2:57:13.740 --> 2:57:15.740]  you would have the bad people to go there
[2:57:15.740 --> 2:57:17.740]  you would provide good services
[2:57:17.740 --> 2:57:19.740]  but because the men are not setting that example
[2:57:19.740 --> 2:57:21.740]  as they did when I was growing up
[2:57:21.740 --> 2:57:23.740]  the crime is out of control
[2:57:23.740 --> 2:57:25.740]  in the urban cities
[2:57:25.740 --> 2:57:27.740]  across the country
[2:57:27.740 --> 2:57:29.740]  black people are afraid
[2:57:29.740 --> 2:57:31.740]  to open a business because they're afraid
[2:57:31.740 --> 2:57:33.740]  of being robbed by other black people
[2:57:33.740 --> 2:57:35.740]  it's not the white person that they're afraid of
[2:57:35.740 --> 2:57:37.740]  it's the black that they're afraid of
[2:57:37.740 --> 2:57:39.740]  and so you don't have black businesses there
[2:57:39.740 --> 2:57:41.740]  because of that
[2:57:41.740 --> 2:57:43.740]  out of control crime
[2:57:43.740 --> 2:57:45.740]  and people are not working in a manner that
[2:57:45.740 --> 2:57:47.740]  they were working before the Chinese
[2:57:47.740 --> 2:57:49.740]  but they're not working and put it back
[2:57:49.740 --> 2:57:51.740]  but you naturally put back
[2:57:51.740 --> 2:57:53.740]  wherever you live
[2:57:53.740 --> 2:57:55.740]  it has nothing to do with racism
[2:57:55.740 --> 2:57:57.740]  what do you think the real numbers are
[2:57:57.740 --> 2:57:59.740]  with Kanye and all of it
[2:57:59.740 --> 2:58:01.740]  do you think black folks are waking up
[2:58:01.740 --> 2:58:03.740]  how do you think they're going to vote
[2:58:03.740 --> 2:58:05.740]  you're going to get more and more
[2:58:05.740 --> 2:58:07.740]  black people voted for the Republican party
[2:58:07.740 --> 2:58:09.740]  and we've gotten years
[2:58:09.740 --> 2:58:11.740]  in a long time
[2:58:11.740 --> 2:58:13.740]  because of President Trump
[2:58:13.740 --> 2:58:15.740]  and because of Kanye West
[2:58:15.740 --> 2:58:17.740]  that's why he's hated right now
[2:58:17.740 --> 2:58:19.740]  Kanye is influencing a lot of millennials
[2:58:19.740 --> 2:58:21.740]  I can tell you I know personally
[2:58:21.740 --> 2:58:23.740]  Kanye's awake he knows what's going on
[2:58:23.740 --> 2:58:25.740]  yes but they're trying to make him look crazy
[2:58:25.740 --> 2:58:27.740]  accusing him of being
[2:58:27.740 --> 2:58:29.740]  off because he's having an influence
[2:58:29.740 --> 2:58:31.740]  with then the black community
[2:58:31.740 --> 2:58:33.740]  because he's broken free from the plantation
[2:58:33.740 --> 2:58:35.740]  literally yes that's right
[2:58:35.740 --> 2:58:37.740]  he's pulling those black boats away
[2:58:37.740 --> 2:58:39.740]  from the Democratic Party
[2:58:39.740 --> 2:58:41.740]  and the worst thing that can happen to the Democratic Party
[2:58:41.740 --> 2:58:43.740]  is to lose black boats
[2:58:43.740 --> 2:58:45.740]  if they lose the black boats the party is over
[2:58:45.740 --> 2:58:47.740]  that's why they are
[2:58:47.740 --> 2:58:49.740]  trying to bring the Hispanics in and all that
[2:58:49.740 --> 2:58:51.740]  because they're trying to stay relevant
[2:58:51.740 --> 2:58:53.740]  if the blacks leave
[2:58:53.740 --> 2:58:55.740]  they won't be relevant and that's why they hate Kanye West
[2:58:55.740 --> 2:58:57.740]  or anyone who
[2:58:57.740 --> 2:58:59.740]  explores black people to wake up
[2:58:59.740 --> 2:59:01.740]  and I think if they have a COVID lockdown
[2:59:01.740 --> 2:59:03.740]  Trump everybody I know knows
[2:59:03.740 --> 2:59:05.740]  the Democrats did the lockdown and did this
[2:59:05.740 --> 2:59:07.740]  yeah and it's the Democratic
[2:59:07.740 --> 2:59:09.740]  states where you really can't
[2:59:09.740 --> 2:59:11.740]  move about if you listen to the Democrats
[2:59:11.740 --> 2:59:13.740]  because they don't want the Chinese
[2:59:13.740 --> 2:59:15.740]  virus to end they want it to be
[2:59:15.740 --> 2:59:17.740]  there they want to hold it there until
[2:59:17.740 --> 2:59:19.740]  election time so that
[2:59:19.740 --> 2:59:21.740]  they can blame as you said blame President Trump
[2:59:21.740 --> 2:59:23.740]  for it anything that
[2:59:23.740 --> 2:59:25.740]  the president is for it doesn't matter
[2:59:25.740 --> 2:59:27.740]  how good it is Alice
[2:59:27.740 --> 2:59:29.740]  anything the president is for they are
[2:59:29.740 --> 2:59:31.740]  against it Jesus Christ
[2:59:31.740 --> 2:59:33.740]  could come down and
[2:59:33.740 --> 2:59:35.740]  if the president is for him they're going to be against him
[2:59:35.740 --> 2:59:37.740]  but if the president say oh I don't
[2:59:37.740 --> 2:59:39.740]  like Jesus they'll be for him
[2:59:39.740 --> 2:59:41.740]  well that's why some say he came up with a vaccine
[2:59:41.740 --> 2:59:43.740]  was to get them to the back off of it looks
[2:59:43.740 --> 2:59:45.740]  like that's happening suddenly Democrats were
[2:59:45.740 --> 2:59:47.740]  against the vaccines they came out for it
[2:59:47.740 --> 2:59:49.740]  I'm like wow that's
[2:59:49.740 --> 2:59:51.740]  60 seconds just leave Peter to stay there
[2:59:51.740 --> 2:59:59.740]  66 reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown
[2:59:59.740 --> 3:00:01.740]  the number one reason is it serves
[3:00:01.740 --> 3:00:03.740]  every one of their purposes
[3:00:03.740 --> 3:00:05.740]  we've gone over those purposes
[3:00:05.740 --> 3:00:07.740]  many times here on air
[3:00:07.740 --> 3:00:09.740]  the casual society the surveillance system
[3:00:09.740 --> 3:00:11.740]  global government medical tyranny forced
[3:00:11.740 --> 3:00:13.740]  inoculation
[3:00:13.740 --> 3:00:15.740]  the most important facet is
[3:00:15.740 --> 3:00:17.740]  it teaches us that we are
[3:00:17.740 --> 3:00:19.740]  obsolete that we are
[3:00:19.740 --> 3:00:21.740]  non-essential
[3:00:21.740 --> 3:00:23.740]  as we begin to
[3:00:23.740 --> 3:00:25.740]  witness automation computers
[3:00:25.740 --> 3:00:27.740]  and robots take over
[3:00:27.740 --> 3:00:29.740]  the jobs that people once had
[3:00:29.740 --> 3:00:31.740]  by design
[3:00:31.740 --> 3:00:33.740]  this isn't like it's some advancement
[3:00:33.740 --> 3:00:35.740]  that we just fell into
[3:00:35.740 --> 3:00:37.740]  it's been preplanned organized
[3:00:37.740 --> 3:00:39.740]  globally and it's extremely
[3:00:39.740 --> 3:00:41.740]  predatory and through governmental
[3:00:41.740 --> 3:00:43.740]  actuaries and tax programs
[3:00:43.740 --> 3:00:45.740]  and regulations
[3:00:45.740 --> 3:00:47.740]  the central banks that control it all
[3:00:47.740 --> 3:00:49.740]  are able to pick the winners
[3:00:49.740 --> 3:00:51.740]  and the losers and consolidate power
[3:00:51.740 --> 3:00:53.740]  this is the truest form
[3:00:53.740 --> 3:00:55.740]  of technocracy fascism
[3:01:03.740 --> 3:01:05.740]  alright Paul Joseph Watson
[3:01:05.740 --> 3:01:07.740]  takes over in T-minus
[3:01:07.740 --> 3:01:09.740]  14 minutes
[3:01:09.740 --> 3:01:11.740]  right now the legendary
[3:01:11.740 --> 3:01:13.740]  Jesse Lee Peterson
[3:01:13.740 --> 3:01:15.740]  of jesseleapeterson.com
[3:01:15.740 --> 3:01:17.740]  is going to host a segment
[3:01:17.740 --> 3:01:19.740]  of Alex Jones he's agreed to do it
[3:01:19.740 --> 3:01:21.740]  he's taking over right now Jesse Lee Peterson
[3:01:21.740 --> 3:01:23.740]  so imagine this folks
[3:01:23.740 --> 3:01:25.740]  I am now sitting in the seat
[3:01:25.740 --> 3:01:27.740]  of Alex Jones
[3:01:27.740 --> 3:01:29.740]  it doesn't get any better than that
[3:01:29.740 --> 3:01:31.740]  that's amazing by the way I want you to know
[3:01:31.740 --> 3:01:33.740]  that I will battle and say spiritual battle
[3:01:33.740 --> 3:01:35.740]  it's a warfare between good
[3:01:35.740 --> 3:01:37.740]  and evil it's not about color
[3:01:37.740 --> 3:01:39.740]  it's not about men and women
[3:01:39.740 --> 3:01:41.740]  it's about right versus wrong
[3:01:41.740 --> 3:01:43.740]  it's not about racism
[3:01:43.740 --> 3:01:45.740]  no such thing as racism
[3:01:45.740 --> 3:01:47.740]  sexism homophobicism
[3:01:47.740 --> 3:01:48.740]  islamphobicism
[3:01:48.740 --> 3:01:49.740]  derby dadism
[3:01:49.740 --> 3:01:51.740]  or white supremacism
[3:01:51.740 --> 3:01:53.740]  or anti-semitism
[3:01:53.740 --> 3:01:55.740]  it's either right or wrong
[3:01:55.740 --> 3:01:57.740]  good or evil and that's what
[3:01:57.740 --> 3:01:59.740]  it's all about and for the men
[3:01:59.740 --> 3:02:01.740]  you have been given a responsibility
[3:02:01.740 --> 3:02:03.740]  by God
[3:02:03.740 --> 3:02:05.740]  to love Him with all your heart
[3:02:05.740 --> 3:02:07.740]  soul and might if you want a family
[3:02:07.740 --> 3:02:09.740]  get married love your wife and God
[3:02:09.740 --> 3:02:11.740]  your wife and children in the right way to go
[3:02:11.740 --> 3:02:13.740]  to protect them from evil
[3:02:13.740 --> 3:02:15.740]  but when you're not there
[3:02:15.740 --> 3:02:17.740]  and you're not guiding your family
[3:02:17.740 --> 3:02:19.740]  it's easy for the liars
[3:02:19.740 --> 3:02:21.740]  the children are not allowed to take over
[3:02:21.740 --> 3:02:23.740]  it's not about racism stop falling for the crap
[3:02:23.740 --> 3:02:25.740]  it's not about
[3:02:25.740 --> 3:02:27.740]  anti-semitism or sexism
[3:02:27.740 --> 3:02:29.740]  and all that ism
[3:02:29.740 --> 3:02:31.740]  it's about right versus wrong
[3:02:31.740 --> 3:02:33.740]  so we gotta rebuild the family
[3:02:33.740 --> 3:02:35.740]  men you gotta stand up because when you're we
[3:02:35.740 --> 3:02:37.740]  it's over for the family
[3:02:37.740 --> 3:02:39.740]  we gotta reestablish that family
[3:02:39.740 --> 3:02:41.740]  and this whole thing about Black Lives Matter
[3:02:41.740 --> 3:02:43.740]  means nothing to say the words
[3:02:43.740 --> 3:02:45.740]  Black Lives Matter
[3:02:45.740 --> 3:02:47.740]  means nothing it's just a form
[3:02:47.740 --> 3:02:49.740]  of controlling you
[3:02:49.740 --> 3:02:51.740]  as I said to Alice earlier
[3:02:51.740 --> 3:02:53.740]  I never imagined that one day we would have
[3:02:53.740 --> 3:02:55.740]  a see a day
[3:02:55.740 --> 3:02:57.740]  when grown Christian men
[3:02:57.740 --> 3:02:59.740]  and women police officers
[3:02:59.740 --> 3:03:01.740]  people from the armed forces are bowing
[3:03:01.740 --> 3:03:03.740]  down to far left
[3:03:03.740 --> 3:03:05.740]  liberal radical
[3:03:05.740 --> 3:03:07.740]  hateful fat black
[3:03:07.740 --> 3:03:09.740]  sexism
[3:03:09.740 --> 3:03:11.740]  I can't believe it
[3:03:11.740 --> 3:03:13.740]  that's amazing to see that
[3:03:13.740 --> 3:03:15.740]  we gotta stop these people
[3:03:15.740 --> 3:03:17.740]  literally burning down our cities
[3:03:17.740 --> 3:03:19.740]  our towns destroying businesses
[3:03:19.740 --> 3:03:21.740]  there have been black people
[3:03:21.740 --> 3:03:23.740]  who've died as a result of this terrorist
[3:03:23.740 --> 3:03:25.740]  attack upon America
[3:03:25.740 --> 3:03:27.740]  they don't care about life
[3:03:27.740 --> 3:03:29.740]  they don't care about people look at Chicago
[3:03:29.740 --> 3:03:31.740]  Chicago crime is through the roof
[3:03:31.740 --> 3:03:33.740]  and it's not about
[3:03:33.740 --> 3:03:35.740]  Florida either
[3:03:35.740 --> 3:03:37.740]  George Floyd
[3:03:37.740 --> 3:03:39.740]  we just saw a video this morning
[3:03:39.740 --> 3:03:41.740]  put out by the Daily Mail
[3:03:41.740 --> 3:03:43.740]  that George Floyd resisted
[3:03:43.740 --> 3:03:45.740]  arrest he resisted
[3:03:45.740 --> 3:03:47.740]  and that's why he's dead today
[3:03:47.740 --> 3:03:49.740]  it's not because of some police
[3:03:49.740 --> 3:03:51.740]  brutality or black
[3:03:51.740 --> 3:03:53.740]  people under attack by the white man
[3:03:53.740 --> 3:03:55.740]  or systemic racism
[3:03:55.740 --> 3:03:57.740]  Floyd resisted arrest
[3:03:57.740 --> 3:03:59.740]  and he's seen to be on some type of drug
[3:03:59.740 --> 3:04:01.740]  and it's been reported that he was high
[3:04:01.740 --> 3:04:03.740]  on something and so it was about
[3:04:03.740 --> 3:04:05.740]  that but they don't want you to know
[3:04:05.740 --> 3:04:07.740]  that because they want to use that
[3:04:07.740 --> 3:04:09.740]  to cry racism
[3:04:09.740 --> 3:04:11.740]  so that they can make you
[3:04:11.740 --> 3:04:13.740]  cause you to become afraid and not stand up
[3:04:13.740 --> 3:04:15.740]  for the country and for what is right
[3:04:15.740 --> 3:04:17.740]  we gotta stand together
[3:04:17.740 --> 3:04:19.740]  it's good against evil
[3:04:19.740 --> 3:04:21.740]  so you have to overcome evil
[3:04:21.740 --> 3:04:23.740]  and stand up with good
[3:04:23.740 --> 3:04:25.740]  and fight it otherwise
[3:04:25.740 --> 3:04:27.740]  it's over and men
[3:04:27.740 --> 3:04:29.740]  you are needed
[3:04:29.740 --> 3:04:31.740]  God and Christ, Christ and man
[3:04:31.740 --> 3:04:33.740]  man over woman over children
[3:04:33.740 --> 3:04:35.740]  there is no way else to go
[3:04:35.740 --> 3:04:37.740]  America is the
[3:04:37.740 --> 3:04:39.740]  greatest country on this
[3:04:39.740 --> 3:04:41.740]  side of heaven given to us by God
[3:04:41.740 --> 3:04:43.740]  we have to protect it
[3:04:43.740 --> 3:04:45.740]  all races are men and women
[3:04:45.740 --> 3:04:47.740]  we gotta stand up and protect our country
[3:04:47.740 --> 3:04:49.740]  there's no way else to go
[3:04:49.740 --> 3:04:51.740]  not that I'm aware of
[3:04:51.740 --> 3:04:53.740]  and we will have South Africa
[3:04:53.740 --> 3:04:55.740]  in America if you don't stand up
[3:04:55.740 --> 3:04:57.740]  they're coming for your land
[3:04:57.740 --> 3:04:59.740]  they're barren and taking your institutions
[3:04:59.740 --> 3:05:01.740]  schools and they're letting
[3:05:01.740 --> 3:05:03.740]  prisons out of jail
[3:05:03.740 --> 3:05:05.740]  they're coming for your land next
[3:05:05.740 --> 3:05:07.740]  because they see that you will not stand up
[3:05:07.740 --> 3:05:09.740]  and if you doubt me talk to some white people
[3:05:09.740 --> 3:05:11.740]  from South Africa
[3:05:11.740 --> 3:05:13.740]  and decent blacks from there and they know
[3:05:13.740 --> 3:05:15.740]  what's going on and some of them
[3:05:15.740 --> 3:05:17.740]  cannot believe that we're allowing it to happen
[3:05:17.740 --> 3:05:19.740]  in this country we gotta re-elect
[3:05:19.740 --> 3:05:21.740]  President Trump we have no other choice
[3:05:21.740 --> 3:05:23.740]  we gotta re-elect him
[3:05:23.740 --> 3:05:25.740]  we must rebuild the family
[3:05:25.740 --> 3:05:27.740]  men you gotta come out of your mama's closet
[3:05:27.740 --> 3:05:29.740]  out of your mama's basement
[3:05:29.740 --> 3:05:31.740]  go out and deal with life
[3:05:31.740 --> 3:05:33.740]  because the world needs you we gotta restore it
[3:05:33.740 --> 3:05:35.740]  so I want you to check us out
[3:05:35.740 --> 3:05:37.740]  at RebuildingTheMan.com
[3:05:37.740 --> 3:05:39.740]  I love what Alice is doing we need more of this
[3:05:39.740 --> 3:05:41.740]  he has a great team
[3:05:41.740 --> 3:05:43.740]  on his network we need more
[3:05:43.740 --> 3:05:45.740]  we gotta save this country
[3:05:45.740 --> 3:05:47.740]  if they get rid of Donald Trump
[3:05:47.740 --> 3:05:49.740]  then it's over for America
[3:05:49.740 --> 3:05:51.740]  because once they take over
[3:05:51.740 --> 3:05:53.740]  they are about power and wealth
[3:05:53.740 --> 3:05:55.740]  if you listen to them
[3:05:55.740 --> 3:05:57.740]  they're not about restoring the family
[3:05:57.740 --> 3:05:59.740]  they're not about getting rid of socialism
[3:05:59.740 --> 3:06:01.740]  they're about bringing in
[3:06:01.740 --> 3:06:03.740]  they're about tearing down
[3:06:03.740 --> 3:06:05.740]  the true history of America
[3:06:05.740 --> 3:06:07.740]  and bringing in a false history
[3:06:07.740 --> 3:06:09.740]  there's a school right now
[3:06:09.740 --> 3:06:11.740]  I mean there's a government
[3:06:11.740 --> 3:06:13.740]  I believe it's Michigan or somewhere
[3:06:13.740 --> 3:06:15.740]  they want to stop teaching history
[3:06:15.740 --> 3:06:17.740]  and bringing in a false history
[3:06:17.740 --> 3:06:19.740]  they want to teach about
[3:06:19.740 --> 3:06:21.740]  black slavery or something
[3:06:21.740 --> 3:06:23.740]  and LGBTQ
[3:06:23.740 --> 3:06:25.740]  they want to do everything they can
[3:06:25.740 --> 3:06:27.740]  to demoralize you
[3:06:27.740 --> 3:06:29.740]  and that's how they control you
[3:06:29.740 --> 3:06:31.740]  because you cannot control
[3:06:31.740 --> 3:06:33.740]  a more people or person
[3:06:33.740 --> 3:06:35.740]  you have to demoralize them
[3:06:35.740 --> 3:06:37.740]  in order to control them
[3:06:37.740 --> 3:06:39.740]  I'm talking with men and women
[3:06:39.740 --> 3:06:41.740]  from around the world
[3:06:41.740 --> 3:06:43.740]  all around the world
[3:06:43.740 --> 3:06:45.740]  and it's the same if you destroy that family
[3:06:45.740 --> 3:06:47.740]  you destroy the souls of the kids
[3:06:47.740 --> 3:06:49.740]  you can control them
[3:06:49.740 --> 3:06:51.740]  so we gotta take back our schools
[3:06:51.740 --> 3:06:53.740]  and yesterday I said you're taking over
[3:06:53.740 --> 3:06:55.740]  and I'm listening here riveted
[3:06:55.740 --> 3:06:57.740]  you're right Michigan and Illinois
[3:06:57.740 --> 3:06:59.740]  I was looking this morning a bunch of states
[3:06:59.740 --> 3:07:01.740]  are saying get rid of history period
[3:07:01.740 --> 3:07:03.740]  and if a bunch of multinational corporations
[3:07:03.740 --> 3:07:05.740]  that run slave camps in China
[3:07:05.740 --> 3:07:07.740]  like Apple and Nike
[3:07:07.740 --> 3:07:09.740]  if we'll hate ourselves they'll come in
[3:07:09.740 --> 3:07:11.740]  and take us over we don't stand up for ourselves
[3:07:11.740 --> 3:07:13.740]  and say no we're good we're not bad
[3:07:13.740 --> 3:07:15.740]  we're proud of America we have a great history
[3:07:15.740 --> 3:07:17.740]  all of us together how dare you
[3:07:17.740 --> 3:07:19.740]  I mean I see them trying
[3:07:19.740 --> 3:07:21.740]  to collapse America and the dollar
[3:07:21.740 --> 3:07:23.740]  and say the Chinese currency
[3:07:23.740 --> 3:07:25.740]  will be the new currency
[3:07:25.740 --> 3:07:27.740]  I mean these people
[3:07:27.740 --> 3:07:29.740]  are working against their own country
[3:07:29.740 --> 3:07:31.740]  even though most democrats aren't even
[3:07:31.740 --> 3:07:33.740]  gonna be successful if this happens
[3:07:33.740 --> 3:07:35.740]  it's gonna destroy them but somehow
[3:07:35.740 --> 3:07:37.740]  they were taught to hate a country
[3:07:37.740 --> 3:07:39.740]  that gave them so much
[3:07:39.740 --> 3:07:41.740]  people come here though from other countries
[3:07:41.740 --> 3:07:43.740]  and they're happy with all our problems
[3:07:43.740 --> 3:07:45.740]  we're still the best country on earth
[3:07:45.740 --> 3:07:47.740]  that's right man look at the basketball team
[3:07:47.740 --> 3:07:49.740]  they're going over to China
[3:07:49.740 --> 3:07:51.740]  and they're protecting China
[3:07:51.740 --> 3:07:53.740]  but they come back home to America
[3:07:53.740 --> 3:07:55.740]  and they kneel during the national anthem
[3:07:55.740 --> 3:07:57.740]  where's their love
[3:07:57.740 --> 3:07:59.740]  which country do they love better
[3:07:59.740 --> 3:08:01.740]  America or China
[3:08:01.740 --> 3:08:03.740]  we gotta stop supporting these teams
[3:08:03.740 --> 3:08:05.740]  maybe 15-20 black men
[3:08:05.740 --> 3:08:07.740]  are killed by cops wrong every year
[3:08:07.740 --> 3:08:09.740]  there are some bad cops that's sad we're against it
[3:08:09.740 --> 3:08:11.740]  you get hundreds of thousands of blacks killed
[3:08:11.740 --> 3:08:13.740]  you know by other blacks
[3:08:13.740 --> 3:08:15.740]  they don't care and it's all terrible
[3:08:15.740 --> 3:08:17.740]  and then literally all these millionaires bow down
[3:08:17.740 --> 3:08:19.740]  but they won't even
[3:08:19.740 --> 3:08:21.740]  criticize China with slave camps
[3:08:21.740 --> 3:08:23.740]  in any way how pathetic is that
[3:08:23.740 --> 3:08:25.740]  cause there's a thing
[3:08:25.740 --> 3:08:27.740]  it's not those black players fault
[3:08:27.740 --> 3:08:29.740]  it's the owners of the teams that put black lives matter
[3:08:29.740 --> 3:08:31.740]  on the court
[3:08:31.740 --> 3:08:33.740]  and are telling them to say that
[3:08:33.740 --> 3:08:35.740]  so they can hide their Chinese death camps
[3:08:35.740 --> 3:08:37.740]  under the guise of oh we're with black people
[3:08:37.740 --> 3:08:39.740]  so we're not racist that's all
[3:08:39.740 --> 3:08:41.740]  they're using black people as the shield
[3:08:41.740 --> 3:08:43.740]  for their evil communist support
[3:08:43.740 --> 3:08:45.740]  that's right that's why I said
[3:08:45.740 --> 3:08:47.740]  black people haven't always been that way
[3:08:47.740 --> 3:08:49.740]  they were on the side of good
[3:08:49.740 --> 3:08:51.740]  and I remember growing up that way
[3:08:51.740 --> 3:08:53.740]  but because they have been so demoralized
[3:08:53.740 --> 3:08:55.740]  the family have been destroyed
[3:08:55.740 --> 3:08:57.740]  my dad grew up with a lot of black folks
[3:08:57.740 --> 3:08:59.740]  in these taxes and so did I
[3:08:59.740 --> 3:09:01.740]  but they were like super Christian
[3:09:01.740 --> 3:09:03.740]  super successful and super neurotic
[3:09:03.740 --> 3:09:05.740]  about standing up for themselves
[3:09:05.740 --> 3:09:07.740]  and how did it
[3:09:07.740 --> 3:09:09.740]  totally shift like that
[3:09:09.740 --> 3:09:11.740]  well they did as I said
[3:09:11.740 --> 3:09:13.740]  the fathers out of the home
[3:09:13.740 --> 3:09:15.740]  and the blacks
[3:09:15.740 --> 3:09:17.740]  they start catering to the women and children
[3:09:17.740 --> 3:09:19.740]  by giving them free star, free government
[3:09:19.740 --> 3:09:21.740]  welfare check
[3:09:21.740 --> 3:09:23.740]  and this black race hustlers like Jesse Jackson
[3:09:23.740 --> 3:09:25.740]  and others became the head of the people
[3:09:25.740 --> 3:09:27.740]  they took the fathers out and it was over
[3:09:27.740 --> 3:09:29.740]  yes and if you pay attention
[3:09:29.740 --> 3:09:31.740]  that's what's happening to the white family as well
[3:09:31.740 --> 3:09:33.740]  oh yeah it's happening I know
[3:09:33.740 --> 3:09:35.740]  I guarantee you
[3:09:35.740 --> 3:09:37.740]  if those black guys that are kneeling
[3:09:37.740 --> 3:09:39.740]  if they had decent fathers
[3:09:39.740 --> 3:09:41.740]  and mothers in the home
[3:09:41.740 --> 3:09:43.740]  they would not be kneeling
[3:09:43.740 --> 3:09:45.740]  they would not be given into that type of evil
[3:09:45.740 --> 3:09:47.740]  they would love their country
[3:09:47.740 --> 3:09:49.740]  and all the way this is gonna end
[3:09:49.740 --> 3:09:51.740]  the sports fans
[3:09:51.740 --> 3:09:53.740]  they gotta stop supporting the sports
[3:09:53.740 --> 3:09:55.740]  they gotta stop pulling their money
[3:09:55.740 --> 3:09:57.740]  buying these people's stuff
[3:09:57.740 --> 3:09:59.740]  because as long as you pay them
[3:09:59.740 --> 3:10:01.740]  they never gonna do right
[3:10:01.740 --> 3:10:03.740]  but if you can let them see that they're wrong
[3:10:03.740 --> 3:10:05.740]  by not supporting them
[3:10:05.740 --> 3:10:07.740]  then a change will come
[3:10:07.740 --> 3:10:09.740]  and it's the big corporations
[3:10:09.740 --> 3:10:11.740]  out of line with China that killed five times
[3:10:11.740 --> 3:10:13.740]  what Hitler did telling us we're bad
[3:10:13.740 --> 3:10:15.740]  no you're bad communist China

[3:10:47.740 --> 3:10:49.740]  with Owen shroyer stay with us
[3:10:49.740 --> 3:10:51.740]  this to me
[3:10:51.740 --> 3:10:53.740]  it's 2am
[3:10:55.740 --> 3:10:57.740]  human freedom
[3:10:57.740 --> 3:10:59.740]  the wild wild west
[3:10:59.740 --> 3:11:01.740]  the renaissance
[3:11:01.740 --> 3:11:03.740]  America
[3:11:03.740 --> 3:11:05.740]  the liberty
[3:11:05.740 --> 3:11:07.740]  the west
[3:11:07.740 --> 3:11:09.740]  built all the freedom
[3:11:09.740 --> 3:11:11.740]  all the choices all the empowerment we see
[3:11:13.740 --> 3:11:15.740]  the general population has been
[3:11:15.740 --> 3:11:17.740]  programmed that submission to tyranny
[3:11:17.740 --> 3:11:19.740]  brings them prosperity
[3:11:19.740 --> 3:11:21.740]  because the last 50 years under
[3:11:21.740 --> 3:11:23.740]  psychotic globalist control
[3:11:23.740 --> 3:11:25.740]  they have taught us by successive
[3:11:25.740 --> 3:11:27.740]  approximation
[3:11:27.740 --> 3:11:29.740]  to bow down and each time be given
[3:11:29.740 --> 3:11:31.740]  a reward a treat
[3:11:31.740 --> 3:11:33.740]  but that's like training wild pigs
[3:11:33.740 --> 3:11:35.740]  to come eat out of your hand
[3:11:35.740 --> 3:11:37.740]  and finally one day you lead them
[3:11:37.740 --> 3:11:39.740]  into the barn and close the door
[3:11:39.740 --> 3:11:41.740]  and butcher them
[3:11:41.740 --> 3:11:43.740]  we're now reaching that point
[3:11:43.740 --> 3:11:45.740]  in societal development
[3:11:45.740 --> 3:11:47.740]  where submission is death
[3:11:47.740 --> 3:11:49.740]  where submission is
[3:11:49.740 --> 3:11:51.740]  the human species being destroyed
[3:11:51.740 --> 3:12:03.740]  forever on the altar of satan
[3:12:03.740 --> 3:12:05.740]  where the hell did this water come from
[3:12:05.740 --> 3:12:07.740]  where did it come from
[3:12:07.740 --> 3:12:09.740]  where did it come from
[3:12:09.740 --> 3:12:11.740]  where did it come from
[3:12:11.740 --> 3:12:13.740]  infowarstore.com

[3:12:49.740 --> 3:12:51.740]  other systems
[3:12:51.740 --> 3:13:19.740]  just don't compare
[3:13:19.740 --> 3:13:21.740]  and the scientific dictatorship
[3:13:21.740 --> 3:13:23.740]  of the elite continues to sink
[3:13:23.740 --> 3:13:25.740]  in its talons
[3:13:25.740 --> 3:13:27.740]  that fit deeper
[3:13:27.740 --> 3:13:29.740]  I'm here in Spain
[3:13:29.740 --> 3:13:31.740]  where the wearing of a face mask is mandatory
[3:13:31.740 --> 3:13:33.740]  not just inside public buildings
[3:13:33.740 --> 3:13:35.740]  not just inside
[3:13:35.740 --> 3:13:37.740]  any kind of building but even on the street
[3:13:37.740 --> 3:13:39.740]  it's the law you have to wear
[3:13:39.740 --> 3:13:41.740]  a face mask everywhere you go
[3:13:41.740 --> 3:13:43.740]  you can only take it off
[3:13:43.740 --> 3:13:45.740]  when you're eating at a restaurant
[3:13:45.740 --> 3:13:47.740]  basically even if you want to go to the toilet
[3:13:47.740 --> 3:13:49.740]  you have to put on a face mask
[3:13:49.740 --> 3:13:51.740]  to make that 20-yard journey
[3:13:51.740 --> 3:13:53.740]  to the toilet
[3:13:53.740 --> 3:13:55.740]  and who's going to be enforcing this new
[3:13:55.740 --> 3:13:57.740]  regime of face mask
[3:13:57.740 --> 3:13:59.740]  tyranny as Dr.
[3:13:59.740 --> 3:14:01.740]  Burks as we had the article yesterday
[3:14:01.740 --> 3:14:03.740]  now suggests that Americans may have to wear
[3:14:03.740 --> 3:14:05.740]  face masks inside their own
[3:14:05.740 --> 3:14:07.740]  homes who's going to enforce that
[3:14:07.740 --> 3:14:09.740]  who's going to enforce it inside
[3:14:09.740 --> 3:14:11.740]  travel hubs inside airports
[3:14:11.740 --> 3:14:13.740]  well it looks like it's going to be done
[3:14:13.740 --> 3:14:15.740]  by our artificially intelligent
[3:14:15.740 --> 3:14:17.740]  robotic friends
[3:14:17.740 --> 3:14:19.740]  we have a video regarding this
[3:14:19.740 --> 3:14:21.740]  which we're going to roll here in a second headline
[3:14:21.740 --> 3:14:23.740]  robot uses
[3:14:23.740 --> 3:14:25.740]  face scanning AI to ask people
[3:14:25.740 --> 3:14:27.740]  to wear a mask
[3:14:27.740 --> 3:14:29.740]  a robot normally used to provide customer
[3:14:29.740 --> 3:14:31.740]  service now has a new
[3:14:31.740 --> 3:14:33.740]  mission scanning your face with
[3:14:33.740 --> 3:14:35.740]  AI technology to check whether you're wearing
[3:14:35.740 --> 3:14:37.740]  a mask and asking you
[3:14:37.740 --> 3:14:39.740]  very nicely to put one
[3:14:39.740 --> 3:14:41.740]  on let's go ahead and roll the clip
[3:14:41.740 --> 3:14:45.740]  here it is
[3:15:11.740 --> 3:15:13.740]  thank you
[3:15:21.740 --> 3:15:23.740]  good morning
[3:15:23.740 --> 3:15:25.740]  I think one of you is not wearing a mask
[3:15:25.740 --> 3:15:27.740]  please make sure to take a mask
[3:15:27.740 --> 3:15:29.740]  from the table
[3:15:31.740 --> 3:15:33.740]  thank you
[3:15:33.740 --> 3:15:35.740]  thank you
[3:15:43.740 --> 3:15:45.740]  now that is soft
[3:15:45.740 --> 3:15:47.740]  thanks robotics Europe
[3:15:47.740 --> 3:15:49.740]  and if you're just hearing the audio you didn't see
[3:15:49.740 --> 3:15:51.740]  the video basically it's a video
[3:15:51.740 --> 3:15:53.740]  demonstration which shows the robot scanning
[3:15:53.740 --> 3:15:55.740]  people's faces and then telling individuals
[3:15:55.740 --> 3:15:57.740]  not wearing a mask to put one on
[3:15:57.740 --> 3:15:59.740]  while thanking those who have
[3:15:59.740 --> 3:16:01.740]  complied because as we know
[3:16:01.740 --> 3:16:03.740]  they're the good people
[3:16:03.740 --> 3:16:05.740]  they're the righteously indignant people
[3:16:05.740 --> 3:16:07.740]  and it also gives them an excuse as we've seen
[3:16:07.740 --> 3:16:09.740]  over the past couple of months now
[3:16:09.740 --> 3:16:11.740]  to viciously attack people
[3:16:11.740 --> 3:16:13.740]  in public or at least spit and scream
[3:16:13.740 --> 3:16:15.740]  in their face we're going to get into
[3:16:15.740 --> 3:16:17.740]  another story on that
[3:16:17.740 --> 3:16:19.740]  score later in the show
[3:16:19.740 --> 3:16:21.740]  but engadget reports using
[3:16:21.740 --> 3:16:23.740]  an image recognition AI
[3:16:23.740 --> 3:16:25.740]  and single shot detector pepper
[3:16:25.740 --> 3:16:27.740]  the cutesy robot
[3:16:27.740 --> 3:16:29.740]  can scan the faces of up to five people
[3:16:29.740 --> 3:16:31.740]  at once
[3:16:31.740 --> 3:16:33.740]  on pepper's tablet a green circle will appear
[3:16:33.740 --> 3:16:35.740]  around an image of anyone wearing a mask
[3:16:35.740 --> 3:16:37.740]  and a red circle will appear around the image
[3:16:37.740 --> 3:16:39.740]  of anyone without a mask
[3:16:39.740 --> 3:16:41.740]  which is very coincidentally the same
[3:16:41.740 --> 3:16:43.740]  technology that we saw
[3:16:43.740 --> 3:16:45.740]  in terms of gate analysis
[3:16:45.740 --> 3:16:47.740]  and facial recognition
[3:16:47.740 --> 3:16:49.740]  of people not properly engaging
[3:16:49.740 --> 3:16:51.740]  in social distancing
[3:16:51.740 --> 3:16:53.740]  you probably remember that video
[3:16:53.740 --> 3:16:55.740]  from a couple of months back where it shows
[3:16:55.740 --> 3:16:57.740]  an alert going off if people are walking
[3:16:57.740 --> 3:16:59.740]  close to one another
[3:16:59.740 --> 3:17:01.740]  which in turn mirrors the social credit
[3:17:01.740 --> 3:17:03.740]  score in China where if people
[3:17:03.740 --> 3:17:05.740]  for example jaywalk across the road
[3:17:05.740 --> 3:17:07.740]  too early a big red box appears
[3:17:07.740 --> 3:17:09.740]  around their head their face is
[3:17:09.740 --> 3:17:11.740]  scanned into the system
[3:17:11.740 --> 3:17:13.740]  and then maybe they'll be punished maybe they won't
[3:17:13.740 --> 3:17:15.740]  be able to buy train tickets
[3:17:15.740 --> 3:17:17.740]  airplane tickets maybe they won't be able
[3:17:17.740 --> 3:17:19.740]  to renew their drivers license
[3:17:19.740 --> 3:17:21.740]  use a bus use public transport whatsoever
[3:17:21.740 --> 3:17:23.740]  maybe they'll get their
[3:17:23.740 --> 3:17:25.740]  rights to use the internet taken away
[3:17:25.740 --> 3:17:27.740]  entirely because they've been
[3:17:27.740 --> 3:17:29.740]  very naughty boys and girls
[3:17:29.740 --> 3:17:31.740]  but the company
[3:17:31.740 --> 3:17:33.740]  in the case of this pepper
[3:17:33.740 --> 3:17:35.740]  AI robot asserts that
[3:17:35.740 --> 3:17:37.740]  no personal data is used or
[3:17:37.740 --> 3:17:39.740]  stored because of course you can
[3:17:39.740 --> 3:17:41.740]  trust giant giant corporations
[3:17:41.740 --> 3:17:43.740]  to securely store your data
[3:17:43.740 --> 3:17:45.740]  not gone wrong with that has it
[3:17:45.740 --> 3:17:47.740]  although face scanning technology is widely
[3:17:47.740 --> 3:17:49.740]  used by both companies and governments
[3:17:49.740 --> 3:17:51.740]  in dictatorial states like China
[3:17:51.740 --> 3:17:53.740]  to enforce compliance
[3:17:53.740 --> 3:17:55.740]  and punish social credit score dissidents
[3:17:55.740 --> 3:17:57.740]  as I just explained
[3:17:57.740 --> 3:17:59.740]  now of course
[3:17:59.740 --> 3:18:01.740]  this high priestess of the mask
[3:18:01.740 --> 3:18:03.740]  call is all being forced into place
[3:18:03.740 --> 3:18:05.740]  despite the fact that
[3:18:05.740 --> 3:18:07.740]  experts in numerous other countries
[3:18:07.740 --> 3:18:09.740]  such as the Netherlands and Sweden
[3:18:09.740 --> 3:18:11.740]  say that the masks are pointless
[3:18:11.740 --> 3:18:13.740]  and this is the point that I've made over
[3:18:13.740 --> 3:18:15.740]  and over again you will notice
[3:18:15.740 --> 3:18:17.740]  the people who wear the masks
[3:18:17.740 --> 3:18:19.740]  completely ignore social
[3:18:19.740 --> 3:18:21.740]  distancing to the point where they not
[3:18:21.740 --> 3:18:23.740]  only brush up against you
[3:18:23.740 --> 3:18:25.740]  they get right in your face and start
[3:18:25.740 --> 3:18:27.740]  spitting and snarling at you
[3:18:27.740 --> 3:18:29.740]  if you're not wearing a mask
[3:18:29.740 --> 3:18:31.740]  they're touching the mask
[3:18:31.740 --> 3:18:33.740]  they're adjusting it
[3:18:33.740 --> 3:18:35.740]  they're touching surfaces
[3:18:35.740 --> 3:18:37.740]  some people have argued that this mask
[3:18:37.740 --> 3:18:39.740]  compliance regime
[3:18:39.740 --> 3:18:41.740]  could actually be making coronavirus worse
[3:18:41.740 --> 3:18:43.740]  but experts in the Netherlands
[3:18:43.740 --> 3:18:45.740]  and Sweden have said that masks are
[3:18:45.740 --> 3:18:47.740]  basically pointless so I'm going to get
[3:18:47.740 --> 3:18:49.740]  onto that article in a minute
[3:18:49.740 --> 3:18:51.740]  and as I write in this article in a wider context
[3:18:51.740 --> 3:18:53.740]  the mask has become a symbol of compliance
[3:18:53.740 --> 3:18:55.740]  while also
[3:18:55.740 --> 3:18:57.740]  facilitating many to virtue signal
[3:18:57.740 --> 3:18:59.740]  and express righteously indignant and sometimes
[3:18:59.740 --> 3:19:01.740]  violent vitriol
[3:19:01.740 --> 3:19:03.740]  towards refuse nicks
[3:19:03.740 --> 3:19:05.740]  and in fact we have another case of that
[3:19:05.740 --> 3:19:07.740]  today this of course
[3:19:07.740 --> 3:19:09.740]  is part on the heels of numerous confrontations
[3:19:09.740 --> 3:19:11.740]  inside wallmarks inside supermarkets
[3:19:11.740 --> 3:19:13.740]  and of course the example
[3:19:13.740 --> 3:19:15.740]  in California where a couple trying
[3:19:15.740 --> 3:19:17.740]  to have a peaceful picnic in the park
[3:19:17.740 --> 3:19:19.740]  again completely on their own
[3:19:19.740 --> 3:19:21.740]  not near anyone
[3:19:21.740 --> 3:19:23.740]  were confronted
[3:19:23.740 --> 3:19:25.740]  and maced in the face
[3:19:25.740 --> 3:19:27.740]  by an elderly woman because they weren't wearing a mask
[3:19:27.740 --> 3:19:29.740]  didn't matter that they were in a park
[3:19:29.740 --> 3:19:31.740]  on their own trying to eat a picnic
[3:19:31.740 --> 3:19:33.740]  apparently now you have to wear a mask
[3:19:33.740 --> 3:19:35.740]  even while you're eating otherwise
[3:19:35.740 --> 3:19:37.740]  you might get maced in the face
[3:19:37.740 --> 3:19:39.740]  by a mask wearing NPC
[3:19:39.740 --> 3:19:41.740]  now we have this headline out of the UK
[3:19:41.740 --> 3:19:43.740]  London man with mask
[3:19:43.740 --> 3:19:45.740]  not fully covering his face
[3:19:45.740 --> 3:19:47.740]  a woman about not wearing mask
[3:19:47.740 --> 3:19:49.740]  and there's a video in this article
[3:19:49.740 --> 3:19:51.740]  a video shot in the London Underground
[3:19:51.740 --> 3:19:53.740]  shows a man wearing an ill-fitting mask
[3:19:53.740 --> 3:19:55.740]  that isn't even fully covering his mouth
[3:19:55.740 --> 3:19:57.740]  aggressively lecturing another woman for not
[3:19:57.740 --> 3:19:59.740]  wearing a mask
[3:19:59.740 --> 3:20:01.740]  so I was just minding my own business
[3:20:01.740 --> 3:20:03.740]  when the mask police came to attack
[3:20:03.740 --> 3:20:05.740]  tweeted the woman involved in the confrontation
[3:20:05.740 --> 3:20:07.740]  and he's
[3:20:07.740 --> 3:20:09.740]  effing and blinding
[3:20:09.740 --> 3:20:11.740]  he's screaming obscenities at her
[3:20:11.740 --> 3:20:13.740]  he's spitting and snarling as he walks up to her
[3:20:13.740 --> 3:20:15.740]  and he gets
[3:20:15.740 --> 3:20:17.740]  within the bounds of social distancing
[3:20:17.740 --> 3:20:19.740]  he's got some kind of
[3:20:19.740 --> 3:20:21.740]  dyed blue beard
[3:20:21.740 --> 3:20:23.740]  the mask isn't even covering his face
[3:20:23.740 --> 3:20:25.740]  his mouth is hanging out of the bottom
[3:20:25.740 --> 3:20:27.740]  of it and this is the guy
[3:20:27.740 --> 3:20:29.740]  who set himself up as the warden
[3:20:29.740 --> 3:20:31.740]  the warden for the other
[3:20:31.740 --> 3:20:33.740]  prisoners
[3:20:33.740 --> 3:20:35.740]  another commuter then attempts to intervene
[3:20:35.740 --> 3:20:37.740]  by saying leave her alone to which the blue bearded
[3:20:37.740 --> 3:20:39.740]  man responds no
[3:20:39.740 --> 3:20:41.740]  put an effing mask on
[3:20:41.740 --> 3:20:43.740]  so we see these
[3:20:43.740 --> 3:20:45.740]  confrontations every single day
[3:20:45.740 --> 3:20:47.740]  they only appear to be more violent
[3:20:47.740 --> 3:20:49.740]  they only appear to be escalating
[3:20:49.740 --> 3:20:51.740]  to an even greater degree
[3:20:51.740 --> 3:20:53.740]  of course we had the video yesterday of
[3:20:53.740 --> 3:20:55.740]  a couple
[3:20:55.740 --> 3:20:57.740]  the female partner
[3:20:57.740 --> 3:20:59.740]  threw a hot coffee on a man simply because
[3:20:59.740 --> 3:21:01.740]  they had a debate or an argument
[3:21:01.740 --> 3:21:03.740]  about mask wearing
[3:21:03.740 --> 3:21:05.740]  so these people literally feel emboldened
[3:21:05.740 --> 3:21:07.740]  because they're the good people right
[3:21:07.740 --> 3:21:09.740]  this is like the
[3:21:09.740 --> 3:21:11.740]  ARL version of virtue signaling
[3:21:11.740 --> 3:21:13.740]  I'm a good person
[3:21:13.740 --> 3:21:15.740]  I'm wearing the mask
[3:21:15.740 --> 3:21:17.740]  I'm conforming, I'm obeying
[3:21:17.740 --> 3:21:19.740]  I'm complying
[3:21:19.740 --> 3:21:21.740]  not only does that give me the right to strut around
[3:21:21.740 --> 3:21:23.740]  like I'm some kind of super class
[3:21:23.740 --> 3:21:25.740]  it gives me the right to get in your face
[3:21:25.740 --> 3:21:27.740]  and violently attack you
[3:21:27.740 --> 3:21:29.740]  this is how these people think
[3:21:29.740 --> 3:21:31.740]  and we're emboldening
[3:21:31.740 --> 3:21:33.740]  a society full of them
[3:21:33.740 --> 3:21:35.740]  and it's only going to get worse
[3:21:35.740 --> 3:21:37.740]  I'm going to talk about what's happening in the UK
[3:21:37.740 --> 3:21:39.740]  in the next segment where people are so
[3:21:39.740 --> 3:21:41.740]  panicked by coronavirus in some
[3:21:41.740 --> 3:21:43.740]  tourist hotspots
[3:21:43.740 --> 3:21:45.740]  they're literally leaping out of the way
[3:21:45.740 --> 3:21:47.740]  of people walking in the
[3:21:47.740 --> 3:21:49.740]  opposite direction
[3:21:49.740 --> 3:21:51.740]  we're going to get that some more
[3:21:51.740 --> 3:21:53.740]  on the other side of the break, summit.news don't go away
[3:21:53.740 --> 3:21:55.740]  historical food is again available
[3:21:55.740 --> 3:21:57.740]  for shipping within three to four weeks

[3:22:15.740 --> 3:22:17.740]  believe me, every angle I've looked at
[3:22:17.740 --> 3:22:19.740]  tells me that really, really serious
[3:22:19.740 --> 3:22:21.740]  times are ahead, whether Trump wins
[3:22:21.740 --> 3:22:23.740]  or loses, the globalists have already
[3:22:23.740 --> 3:22:25.740]  created a world by depression
[3:22:25.740 --> 3:22:27.740]  lockdowns on the planetary scale

[3:22:55.740 --> 3:22:57.740]  asthma, germs, toxins
[3:22:57.740 --> 3:22:59.740]  there are many reasons
[3:22:59.740 --> 3:23:01.740]  why we need to think about what is really in the air
[3:23:01.740 --> 3:23:03.740]  around us
[3:23:03.740 --> 3:23:05.740]  we may not be able to stop breathing

[3:23:53.740 --> 3:23:55.740]  starting about 24 years ago
[3:23:55.740 --> 3:23:57.740]  I began to get calls from major
[3:23:57.740 --> 3:23:59.740]  Hollywood directors producers
[3:23:59.740 --> 3:24:01.740]  actors they wanted to meet with me
[3:24:01.740 --> 3:24:03.740]  and they said what is your formal education
[3:24:03.740 --> 3:24:05.740]  I said well really nothing but
[3:24:05.740 --> 3:24:07.740]  a few years of college they said well
[3:24:07.740 --> 3:24:09.740]  how are you one of the best
[3:24:09.740 --> 3:24:11.740]  science fiction or cultural
[3:24:11.740 --> 3:24:13.740]  writers we've ever heard
[3:24:13.740 --> 3:24:15.740]  the stuff you come up with is just
[3:24:15.740 --> 3:24:17.740]  unbelievable we'd like you to be
[3:24:17.740 --> 3:24:19.740]  in movies we'd like you to write with us
[3:24:19.740 --> 3:24:21.740]  we'd like you to do voiceovers
[3:24:21.740 --> 3:24:23.740]  you're just a renaissance man and folks know I was in some
[3:24:23.740 --> 3:24:25.740]  movies and Harry Shearer made statements like that
[3:24:25.740 --> 3:24:27.740]  a lot of others I'm not bragging
[3:24:27.740 --> 3:24:29.740]  I kept explaining to them I said
[3:24:29.740 --> 3:24:31.740]  do you understand I didn't come up with any of this
[3:24:31.740 --> 3:24:33.740]  I'm reading globalist
[3:24:33.740 --> 3:24:35.740]  MIT white papers and
[3:24:35.740 --> 3:24:37.740]  futurist documents
[3:24:37.740 --> 3:24:39.740]  and they would just laugh me and say oh no way
[3:24:39.740 --> 3:24:41.740]  then I would give them the documents
[3:24:41.740 --> 3:24:43.740]  they would get very very scared the next time
[3:24:43.740 --> 3:24:45.740]  I saw them in a few months and say
[3:24:45.740 --> 3:24:47.740]  man you're right this is just topic
[3:24:47.740 --> 3:24:49.740]  folks I didn't make any of this up
[3:24:49.740 --> 3:24:55.740]  okay it's real it's real
[3:24:55.740 --> 3:25:20.740]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:25:20.740 --> 3:25:22.740]  now there is no population
[3:25:22.740 --> 3:25:24.740]  that has been more terrorized
[3:25:24.740 --> 3:25:26.740]  by COVID-19 hysteria
[3:25:26.740 --> 3:25:28.740]  than that
[3:25:28.740 --> 3:25:30.740]  in the United Kingdom
[3:25:30.740 --> 3:25:32.740]  there was an Ipsos morry poll recently
[3:25:32.740 --> 3:25:34.740]  which found that 68% of
[3:25:34.740 --> 3:25:36.740]  Brits were very concerned about the threat
[3:25:36.740 --> 3:25:38.740]  coronavirus poses to their health
[3:25:38.740 --> 3:25:40.740]  compared to 28% who were just
[3:25:40.740 --> 3:25:42.740]  fairly concerned but that's not
[3:25:42.740 --> 3:25:44.740]  the big enchilada here
[3:25:44.740 --> 3:25:46.740]  this is absolutely insane
[3:25:46.740 --> 3:25:48.740]  there was a separate survey
[3:25:48.740 --> 3:25:50.740]  and I'm reading here from the spiked
[3:25:50.740 --> 3:25:52.740]  article the British public
[3:25:52.740 --> 3:25:54.740]  has been terrorized
[3:25:54.740 --> 3:25:56.740]  there was a separate survey
[3:25:56.740 --> 3:25:58.740]  which found get this
[3:25:58.740 --> 3:26:00.740]  on average the British
[3:26:00.740 --> 3:26:02.740]  public believes 7%
[3:26:02.740 --> 3:26:04.740]  of the UK population
[3:26:04.740 --> 3:26:06.740]  has died from coronavirus
[3:26:06.740 --> 3:26:08.740]  that would amount to a death toll
[3:26:08.740 --> 3:26:12.740]  of nearly 5 million
[3:26:12.740 --> 3:26:14.740]  okay so the real
[3:26:14.740 --> 3:26:16.740]  figure of people who have died from
[3:26:16.740 --> 3:26:18.740]  coronavirus in the UK bearing in mind
[3:26:18.740 --> 3:26:20.740]  that according to the studies
[3:26:20.740 --> 3:26:22.740]  85% plus of them
[3:26:22.740 --> 3:26:24.740]  would have died anyway
[3:26:24.740 --> 3:26:26.740]  from other serious illnesses
[3:26:26.740 --> 3:26:28.740]  within a few weeks
[3:26:28.740 --> 3:26:30.740]  the official COVID-19 death toll
[3:26:30.740 --> 3:26:32.740]  in the UK is 50,000
[3:26:32.740 --> 3:26:34.740]  and yet the population
[3:26:34.740 --> 3:26:36.740]  of the country believes that
[3:26:36.740 --> 3:26:38.740]  5 million people have died
[3:26:38.740 --> 3:26:40.740]  from it
[3:26:40.740 --> 3:26:42.740]  how on earth do they believe that
[3:26:42.740 --> 3:26:44.740]  what's the explanation
[3:26:44.740 --> 3:26:46.740]  it's the constant drumbeat of terror
[3:26:46.740 --> 3:26:48.740]  hysteria and propaganda
[3:26:48.740 --> 3:26:50.740]  mainstream media
[3:26:50.740 --> 3:26:52.740]  to the point which I highlight
[3:26:52.740 --> 3:26:54.740]  in the article corona paranoia
[3:26:54.740 --> 3:26:56.740]  panicked UK resident
[3:26:56.740 --> 3:26:58.740]  describes leaping out of the way to avoid
[3:26:58.740 --> 3:27:00.740]  tourists
[3:27:00.740 --> 3:27:02.740]  to the point where people are afraid
[3:27:02.740 --> 3:27:04.740]  to leave their homes
[3:27:04.740 --> 3:27:06.740]  because they think that this second wave
[3:27:06.740 --> 3:27:08.740]  is already in effect and that this virus
[3:27:08.740 --> 3:27:10.740]  is raging and that it's already killed
[3:27:10.740 --> 3:27:12.740]  5 million people
[3:27:12.740 --> 3:27:14.740]  in the United Kingdom
[3:27:14.740 --> 3:27:16.740]  absolutely insane
[3:27:18.740 --> 3:27:20.740]  and this is the consensus viewpoint
[3:27:20.740 --> 3:27:22.740]  by the way every single poll
[3:27:22.740 --> 3:27:24.740]  that you look at finds
[3:27:24.740 --> 3:27:26.740]  75-80% plus of people
[3:27:26.740 --> 3:27:28.740]  not only want lockdown
[3:27:28.740 --> 3:27:30.740]  to continue they want it to be
[3:27:30.740 --> 3:27:32.740]  more draconian than it ever was
[3:27:32.740 --> 3:27:34.740]  in the first place
[3:27:34.740 --> 3:27:36.740]  I mean you've got to give the media credit
[3:27:36.740 --> 3:27:38.740]  they've really terrorized people to no extent
[3:27:38.740 --> 3:27:40.740]  with this corona
[3:27:40.740 --> 3:27:42.740]  paranoia and I'm going to get
[3:27:42.740 --> 3:27:44.740]  onto the actual
[3:27:44.740 --> 3:27:46.740]  average death figures in the UK
[3:27:46.740 --> 3:27:48.740]  which are below normal
[3:27:48.740 --> 3:27:50.740]  even including the Covid deaths
[3:27:50.740 --> 3:27:52.740]  but this story
[3:27:52.740 --> 3:27:54.740]  is funny to say the least
[3:27:54.740 --> 3:27:56.740]  corona paranoia panicked UK resident
[3:27:56.740 --> 3:27:58.740]  describes leaping out of the way to avoid tourists
[3:27:58.740 --> 3:28:00.740]  so you have a bunch of
[3:28:00.740 --> 3:28:02.740]  people from the UK
[3:28:02.740 --> 3:28:04.740]  avoiding travelling abroad
[3:28:04.740 --> 3:28:06.740]  because now our government has said that they'll have to
[3:28:06.740 --> 3:28:08.740]  quarantine for two weeks when they come back
[3:28:08.740 --> 3:28:10.740]  I'll have to do that personally
[3:28:10.740 --> 3:28:12.740]  because I'm coming back from Spain
[3:28:12.740 --> 3:28:14.740]  which within
[3:28:14.740 --> 3:28:16.740]  a tweet
[3:28:16.740 --> 3:28:18.740]  they put on the list of unsafe countries
[3:28:18.740 --> 3:28:20.740]  even though the UK has more corona virus
[3:28:20.740 --> 3:28:22.740]  cases than Spain
[3:28:22.740 --> 3:28:24.740]  so I've got to submit to a
[3:28:24.740 --> 3:28:26.740]  potential home visit
[3:28:26.740 --> 3:28:28.740]  from the scientific dictatorship when I get back
[3:28:28.740 --> 3:28:30.740]  to check that I'm
[3:28:30.740 --> 3:28:32.740]  squirreled away in my own home
[3:28:32.740 --> 3:28:34.740]  you're not even allowed to go out and buy groceries
[3:28:34.740 --> 3:28:36.740]  under this quarantine law
[3:28:36.740 --> 3:28:38.740]  you have to get somebody else to do it
[3:28:38.740 --> 3:28:40.740]  or you have to get them delivered
[3:28:40.740 --> 3:28:42.740]  you're not even allowed to go out and exercise for two weeks
[3:28:42.740 --> 3:28:44.740]  you're a literal house prisoner
[3:28:44.740 --> 3:28:46.740]  within your own home for two weeks
[3:28:46.740 --> 3:28:48.740]  I mean it wouldn't surprise me at this point
[3:28:48.740 --> 3:28:50.740]  if we start following the example of
[3:28:50.740 --> 3:28:52.740]  Singapore
[3:28:52.740 --> 3:28:54.740]  who yesterday announced that they would be putting
[3:28:54.740 --> 3:28:56.740]  tracker bracelets on people
[3:28:56.740 --> 3:28:58.740]  as if they were prisoners
[3:28:58.740 --> 3:29:00.740]  when they came into the country
[3:29:00.740 --> 3:29:02.740]  that's the next step
[3:29:02.740 --> 3:29:04.740]  so all these people from within the UK
[3:29:04.740 --> 3:29:06.740]  because they're so terrified of going abroad
[3:29:06.740 --> 3:29:08.740]  they're having staycations
[3:29:08.740 --> 3:29:10.740]  people from London
[3:29:10.740 --> 3:29:12.740]  and other major cities going out to the
[3:29:12.740 --> 3:29:14.740]  countryside areas to the seaside areas
[3:29:14.740 --> 3:29:16.740]  and much of the population
[3:29:16.740 --> 3:29:18.740]  the resident population
[3:29:18.740 --> 3:29:20.740]  in those tourist areas are so
[3:29:20.740 --> 3:29:22.740]  panicked at this influx
[3:29:22.740 --> 3:29:24.740]  of tourists which is not massive by the way
[3:29:24.740 --> 3:29:26.740]  it's probably slightly above normal
[3:29:26.740 --> 3:29:28.740]  standards but they're so panicked
[3:29:28.740 --> 3:29:30.740]  by seeing this wave
[3:29:30.740 --> 3:29:32.740]  of potential infected
[3:29:32.740 --> 3:29:34.740]  patients heading their way
[3:29:34.740 --> 3:29:36.740]  literally leaping out of the way
[3:29:36.740 --> 3:29:38.740]  in the street
[3:29:38.740 --> 3:29:40.740]  the independent report asserts
[3:29:40.740 --> 3:29:42.740]  that the general consensus
[3:29:42.740 --> 3:29:44.740]  amongst residents is abject fear
[3:29:44.740 --> 3:29:46.740]  of staycation tourists
[3:29:46.740 --> 3:29:48.740]  pouring into the region and infecting them
[3:29:48.740 --> 3:29:50.740]  with Covid-19
[3:29:50.740 --> 3:29:52.740]  despite the fact that daily deaths from the virus in the UK
[3:29:52.740 --> 3:29:54.740]  have slowed to a trickle
[3:29:54.740 --> 3:29:56.740]  complaining that visitors to the region
[3:29:56.740 --> 3:29:58.740]  were not properly social distancing
[3:29:58.740 --> 3:30:00.740]  and this is the region of Cornwall
[3:30:00.740 --> 3:30:02.740]  which is on the south coast of the United Kingdom
[3:30:02.740 --> 3:30:04.740]  one female resident described
[3:30:04.740 --> 3:30:06.740]  physically leaping out of the way
[3:30:06.740 --> 3:30:08.740]  of people in sheer terror
[3:30:08.740 --> 3:30:10.740]  she said
[3:30:10.740 --> 3:30:12.740]  my shielding is paused from today
[3:30:12.740 --> 3:30:14.740]  but I'm too scared to go out
[3:30:14.740 --> 3:30:16.740]  tried walking into town a couple of times
[3:30:16.740 --> 3:30:18.740]  but no social distancing at all
[3:30:18.740 --> 3:30:20.740]  I was constantly doubling back
[3:30:20.740 --> 3:30:22.740]  leaping out of the way
[3:30:22.740 --> 3:30:24.740]  and panicking just to keep my distance
[3:30:24.740 --> 3:30:26.740]  from the hordes it's horrifying
[3:30:26.740 --> 3:30:28.740]  horrifying
[3:30:32.740 --> 3:30:34.740]  she's literally indoctrinated herself
[3:30:34.740 --> 3:30:36.740]  by so much hysteria
[3:30:36.740 --> 3:30:38.740]  over the past 5-6 months
[3:30:38.740 --> 3:30:40.740]  that she's afraid of people walking
[3:30:40.740 --> 3:30:42.740]  towards her in the opposite direction
[3:30:42.740 --> 3:30:44.740]  even though most of them are now wearing
[3:30:44.740 --> 3:30:46.740]  masks anyway because you can't even go
[3:30:46.740 --> 3:30:48.740]  in a shop in the UK without wearing a mask
[3:30:48.740 --> 3:30:50.740]  another resident in St Ives
[3:30:50.740 --> 3:30:52.740]  said she was too scared
[3:30:52.740 --> 3:30:54.740]  to go food shopping
[3:30:54.740 --> 3:30:56.740]  due to more people visiting supermarkets
[3:30:56.740 --> 3:30:58.740]  and had told her children to avoid
[3:30:58.740 --> 3:31:00.740]  the main shopping street
[3:31:00.740 --> 3:31:02.740]  they see a perfect example on screen now of a Karen
[3:31:02.740 --> 3:31:04.740]  who is literally
[3:31:04.740 --> 3:31:06.740]  waving her walking sticks
[3:31:06.740 --> 3:31:08.740]  around in front of her
[3:31:08.740 --> 3:31:10.740]  as if she was going to swing a cat
[3:31:10.740 --> 3:31:12.740]  to get the appropriate distance and screaming at people
[3:31:12.740 --> 3:31:14.740]  to stay away from her
[3:31:14.740 --> 3:31:16.740]  this is abject mind control on a level
[3:31:16.740 --> 3:31:18.740]  I've never seen before
[3:31:18.740 --> 3:31:20.740]  and if they can get 80% of people
[3:31:20.740 --> 3:31:22.740]  in polls to support this
[3:31:22.740 --> 3:31:24.740]  a lighter version of this
[3:31:24.740 --> 3:31:26.740]  I mean we've got a lot of work to do
[3:31:26.740 --> 3:31:28.740]  the story illustrates
[3:31:28.740 --> 3:31:30.740]  how some have become so hysterical
[3:31:30.740 --> 3:31:32.740]  in response to the constant drumbeat of media
[3:31:32.740 --> 3:31:34.740]  alarmism surrounding coronavirus
[3:31:34.740 --> 3:31:36.740]  that they are literally terrified of other
[3:31:36.740 --> 3:31:38.740]  people coming anywhere near them
[3:31:38.740 --> 3:31:40.740]  and you've all probably had one of these experiences
[3:31:40.740 --> 3:31:42.740]  by now especially with people
[3:31:42.740 --> 3:31:44.740]  wearing masks
[3:31:44.740 --> 3:31:46.740]  who think they can just bowl into you apparently
[3:31:48.740 --> 3:31:50.740]  as I was in a restaurant trying to get past a person
[3:31:50.740 --> 3:31:52.740]  who politely asked them to move out of the way twice
[3:31:52.740 --> 3:31:54.740]  they didn't listen
[3:31:54.740 --> 3:31:56.740]  so I walked past them
[3:31:56.740 --> 3:31:58.740]  didn't even brush past them
[3:31:58.740 --> 3:32:00.740]  and what was the response
[3:32:00.740 --> 3:32:02.740]  snarling arrogance
[3:32:02.740 --> 3:32:04.740]  that's not social distancing
[3:32:04.740 --> 3:32:06.740]  meanwhile people are
[3:32:06.740 --> 3:32:08.740]  literally leaping out of the way
[3:32:08.740 --> 3:32:10.740]  people literally think that 5 million
[3:32:10.740 --> 3:32:12.740]  people in the United Kingdom
[3:32:12.740 --> 3:32:14.740]  have died from coronavirus
[3:32:14.740 --> 3:32:16.740]  it's actually 50,000 80%
[3:32:16.740 --> 3:32:18.740]  plus of whom would have died anyway
[3:32:18.740 --> 3:32:20.740]  yes every death is a tragedy
[3:32:20.740 --> 3:32:22.740]  but you have to consider that
[3:32:22.740 --> 3:32:24.740]  meanwhile
[3:32:24.740 --> 3:32:26.740]  the actual death figures in the UK
[3:32:26.740 --> 3:32:28.740]  on average are lower than normal
[3:32:28.740 --> 3:32:30.740]  including coronavirus
[3:32:30.740 --> 3:32:32.740]  this is out of lockdownskeptics.org
[3:32:32.740 --> 3:32:34.740]  deaths below 5 year average
[3:32:34.740 --> 3:32:36.740]  for 6 weeks in a row
[3:32:36.740 --> 3:32:38.740]  bearing in mind
[3:32:38.740 --> 3:32:40.740]  more people in the UK died during the
[3:32:40.740 --> 3:32:42.740]  2017-18 flu season
[3:32:42.740 --> 3:32:44.740]  than the whole coronavirus death toll
[3:32:44.740 --> 3:32:46.740]  from flu
[3:32:46.740 --> 3:32:48.740]  did we lock down our society
[3:32:48.740 --> 3:32:50.740]  did we cripple our economy
[3:32:50.740 --> 3:32:52.740]  did we grease the skids
[3:32:52.740 --> 3:32:54.740]  for this massive mental illness
[3:32:54.740 --> 3:32:56.740]  problem that's going to blow back
[3:32:56.740 --> 3:32:58.740]  in our faces time and time again
[3:32:58.740 --> 3:33:00.740]  no we didn't
[3:33:00.740 --> 3:33:02.740]  because as humans we have
[3:33:02.740 --> 3:33:04.740]  immune systems
[3:33:04.740 --> 3:33:06.740]  and old people unfortunately die
[3:33:06.740 --> 3:33:08.740]  but now apparently we can't accept that
[3:33:08.740 --> 3:33:10.740]  we no longer have immune systems
[3:33:10.740 --> 3:33:12.740]  and old people don't die
[3:33:12.740 --> 3:33:14.740]  today's ONS release
[3:33:14.740 --> 3:33:16.740]  of national statistics in the UK
[3:33:16.740 --> 3:33:18.740]  has deaths from novel coronavirus
[3:33:18.740 --> 3:33:20.740]  in England and Wales continuing to fall
[3:33:20.740 --> 3:33:22.740]  there are a total of
[3:33:22.740 --> 3:33:24.740]  8,891 deaths registered
[3:33:24.740 --> 3:33:26.740]  in England and Wales in the week
[3:33:26.740 --> 3:33:28.740]  to July 24th
[3:33:28.740 --> 3:33:30.740]  that's 161 fewer
[3:33:30.740 --> 3:33:32.740]  than the 5 year average
[3:33:32.740 --> 3:33:34.740]  of 9,052
[3:33:34.740 --> 3:33:36.740]  this is the 6th week
[3:33:36.740 --> 3:33:38.740]  in a row that deaths have been below
[3:33:38.740 --> 3:33:40.740]  the 5 year average
[3:33:40.740 --> 3:33:42.740]  they're out there in the media
[3:33:42.740 --> 3:33:44.740]  theoretically claiming that we're undergoing
[3:33:44.740 --> 3:33:46.740]  a second wave the government's
[3:33:46.740 --> 3:33:48.740]  locking down different cities
[3:33:48.740 --> 3:33:50.740]  from time to time
[3:33:50.740 --> 3:33:52.740]  places like Blackburn
[3:33:52.740 --> 3:33:54.740]  places in Manchester
[3:33:54.740 --> 3:33:56.740]  due to a tiny almost
[3:33:56.740 --> 3:33:58.740]  inconsequential spike in coronavirus cases
[3:33:58.740 --> 3:34:00.740]  almost all of which is accounted for
[3:34:00.740 --> 3:34:02.740]  because there's more testing
[3:34:02.740 --> 3:34:04.740]  of coronavirus
[3:34:04.740 --> 3:34:06.740]  and yet they're locking us down
[3:34:06.740 --> 3:34:08.740]  once again
[3:34:08.740 --> 3:34:10.740]  the screws are tightening
[3:34:10.740 --> 3:34:12.740]  the masks are going on
[3:34:12.740 --> 3:34:14.740]  and we have less average deaths
[3:34:14.740 --> 3:34:16.740]  than over a 5 year period
[3:34:16.740 --> 3:34:18.740]  absolutely incredible
[3:34:18.740 --> 3:34:20.740]  the success
[3:34:20.740 --> 3:34:22.740]  you have to hand it to the media
[3:34:22.740 --> 3:34:24.740]  they've had great success
[3:34:24.740 --> 3:34:26.740]  in absolutely terrorizing people
[3:34:26.740 --> 3:34:28.740]  over this virus
[3:34:28.740 --> 3:34:30.740]  which in the United Kingdom has killed
[3:34:30.740 --> 3:34:32.740]  less people than
[3:34:32.740 --> 3:34:34.740]  flu did in the 2017-18
[3:34:34.740 --> 3:34:36.740]  flu season
[3:34:36.740 --> 3:34:38.740]  yet we have a population
[3:34:38.740 --> 3:34:40.740]  of the drooling idiots
[3:34:40.740 --> 3:34:42.740]  who have swallowed this whole
[3:34:42.740 --> 3:34:44.740]  and literally believe that
[3:34:44.740 --> 3:34:46.740]  7% of the population has died
[3:34:46.740 --> 3:34:48.740]  from coronavirus
[3:34:48.740 --> 3:34:50.740]  absolutely incredible
[3:34:50.740 --> 3:34:52.740]  don't go away
[3:34:52.740 --> 3:34:54.740]  another part of the Great Awakening
[3:34:54.740 --> 3:34:56.740]  is people that haven't even been
[3:34:56.740 --> 3:34:58.740]  religious or Christian
[3:34:58.740 --> 3:35:00.740]  now see how evil is out in the open
[3:35:00.740 --> 3:35:02.740]  how hundreds of churches have been burned
[3:35:02.740 --> 3:35:04.740]  in Europe and the US
[3:35:04.740 --> 3:35:06.740]  hundreds of Christian icons
[3:35:06.740 --> 3:35:08.740]  have been destroyed
[3:35:08.740 --> 3:35:10.740]  Jesus has had their heads cut off
[3:35:10.740 --> 3:35:12.740]  all over the country
[3:35:12.740 --> 3:35:14.740]  all over the Philippines, all over Europe
[3:35:14.740 --> 3:35:16.740]  Virgin Mary's are getting torn down
[3:35:16.740 --> 3:35:18.740]  crosses are being torn down
[3:35:18.740 --> 3:35:20.740]  it's absolutely out of control
[3:35:20.740 --> 3:35:22.740]  but people now understand
[3:35:22.740 --> 3:35:24.740]  that evil is always real
[3:35:24.740 --> 3:35:26.740]  it is spiritual
[3:35:26.740 --> 3:35:28.740]  and it was just waiting to make its move
[3:35:28.740 --> 3:35:30.740]  building beneath the surface
[3:35:30.740 --> 3:35:32.740]  and now it's emerged
[3:35:32.740 --> 3:35:34.740]  that's why when I ask listeners and viewers
[3:35:34.740 --> 3:35:36.740]  that God hears it
[3:35:36.740 --> 3:35:38.740]  we need to come together and pray
[3:35:38.740 --> 3:35:40.740]  for Great Awakening
[3:35:40.740 --> 3:35:42.740]  pray for Donald Trump
[3:35:42.740 --> 3:35:44.740]  pray for him to win a landslide
[3:35:44.740 --> 3:35:46.740]  and pray for the people under deception
[3:35:46.740 --> 3:35:48.740]  of the globalist to awaken and join us
[3:35:48.740 --> 3:35:50.740]  in liberty and freedom
[3:35:50.740 --> 3:36:12.740]  I'm really really proud of the Dr. Jones Naturals

[3:36:36.740 --> 3:36:37.740]  over a year ago
[3:36:37.740 --> 3:36:39.740]  I tried charcoal toothpaste
[3:36:39.740 --> 3:36:41.740]  from a major brand and thought it was amazing
[3:36:41.740 --> 3:36:43.740]  and I went to my dad and people said
[3:36:43.740 --> 3:36:45.740]  I would like to put out a charcoal toothpaste
[3:36:45.740 --> 3:36:47.740]  that doesn't have all this silica and all these fillers
[3:36:47.740 --> 3:36:49.740]  I would never use anything like it

[3:36:56.740 --> 3:36:57.740]  a second cup of the day
[3:36:57.740 --> 3:36:59.740]  it's really strong I shouldn't do this
[3:36:59.740 --> 3:37:01.740]  because all work and no playmates
[3:37:01.740 --> 3:37:03.740]  would jack a really aggressive boy

[3:37:56.740 --> 3:37:58.740]  and they've come out with a detailed article
[3:37:58.740 --> 3:38:01.740]  it's linked to infowars.com saying
[3:38:01.740 --> 3:38:04.740]  you will have to have forced inoculations

[3:38:14.740 --> 3:38:15.740]  but it's going to be so easy
[3:38:15.740 --> 3:38:16.740]  and so cool and so fun
[3:38:16.740 --> 3:38:18.740]  the microsoft website
[3:38:18.740 --> 3:38:19.740]  now officially has announced
[3:38:19.740 --> 3:38:20.740]  the digital tattoo
[3:38:20.740 --> 3:38:22.740]  we exposed this six months ago
[3:38:22.740 --> 3:38:24.740]  now bill gates was funding it
[3:38:24.740 --> 3:38:25.740]  and they had hundreds of news articles
[3:38:25.740 --> 3:38:27.740]  attacking and saying it wasn't true
[3:38:27.740 --> 3:38:29.740]  this is a tactic they use
[3:38:29.740 --> 3:38:30.740]  first they announce it
[3:38:30.740 --> 3:38:31.740]  we say it's a bad idea
[3:38:31.740 --> 3:38:32.740]  they say that's crazy
[3:38:32.740 --> 3:38:33.740]  we didn't do it
[3:38:33.740 --> 3:38:34.740]  they introduce the idea to you
[3:38:34.740 --> 3:38:36.740]  then they come back and announce it again
[3:38:36.740 --> 3:38:38.740]  thinking you have no memory
[3:38:38.740 --> 3:38:40.740]  this is a criminal takeover
[3:38:40.740 --> 3:38:42.740]  this is the line in the sand
[3:38:42.740 --> 3:38:43.740]  we must say no
[3:38:43.740 --> 3:38:46.740]  we must expose the fraud of covid-19
[3:38:46.740 --> 3:38:48.740]  this entire house of evil is built on
[3:38:48.740 --> 3:38:49.740]  I'm alex jones

[3:39:21.740 --> 3:39:23.740]  why I wear my mask
[3:39:23.740 --> 3:39:25.740]  which is a kind of satirical take
[3:39:25.740 --> 3:39:26.740]  on all this
[3:39:26.740 --> 3:39:27.740]  before I get into some more
[3:39:27.740 --> 3:39:28.740]  final news stories

[3:39:34.740 --> 3:39:35.740]  despite the fact that the media
[3:39:35.740 --> 3:39:37.740]  apparently now thinks that humans
[3:39:37.740 --> 3:39:39.740]  don't have functioning immune systems
[3:39:39.740 --> 3:39:41.740]  it is still very necessary

[3:40:10.740 --> 3:40:11.740]  full of food
[3:40:11.740 --> 3:40:13.740]  the fact that you wouldn't even have a six

[3:40:58.740 --> 3:41:00.740]  I'm going to come back and talk about what's happening
[3:41:00.740 --> 3:41:02.740]  in Sweden what's happening
[3:41:02.740 --> 3:41:04.740]  in Australia with this lockdown but first
[3:41:04.740 --> 3:41:06.740]  going to go to this short video
[3:41:06.740 --> 3:41:08.740]  called why I wear my mask
[3:41:08.740 --> 3:41:10.740]  here it is
[3:41:10.740 --> 3:41:12.740]  oh my apologies
[3:41:12.740 --> 3:41:14.740]  I was wearing my mask
[3:41:14.740 --> 3:41:16.740]  because I just got back from a full day of being
[3:41:16.740 --> 3:41:18.740]  a good person I love my mask
[3:41:18.740 --> 3:41:20.740]  because it's a simple yet effective way to
[3:41:20.740 --> 3:41:22.740]  display my righteousness am I concerned
[3:41:22.740 --> 3:41:24.740]  that two children in China dropped dead because
[3:41:24.740 --> 3:41:26.740]  they were forced to wear masks in gym class
[3:41:26.740 --> 3:41:28.740]  nope am I concerned that we're creating
[3:41:28.740 --> 3:41:30.740]  a generation of children who will be socially
[3:41:30.740 --> 3:41:32.740]  awkward and conditioned to fear their fellow
[3:41:32.740 --> 3:41:34.740]  man no am I concerned that
[3:41:34.740 --> 3:41:36.740]  I'm contributing to an impending socialist
[3:41:36.740 --> 3:41:38.740]  technocracy that will enslave the global
[3:41:38.740 --> 3:41:40.740]  population not even a little bit
[3:41:40.740 --> 3:41:42.740]  am I concerned that my mask is symbolic
[3:41:42.740 --> 3:41:44.740]  of my compliance to the social conditioning
[3:41:44.740 --> 3:41:46.740]  that will eventually lead to the forced
[3:41:46.740 --> 3:41:48.740]  vaccination of every man woman and child on
[3:41:48.740 --> 3:41:50.740]  planet earth not a chance
[3:41:50.740 --> 3:41:52.740]  and why am I not concerned you ask
[3:41:52.740 --> 3:41:54.740]  I'm not concerned because I decided a long
[3:41:54.740 --> 3:41:56.740]  time ago that shallow and significant gestures
[3:41:56.740 --> 3:41:58.740]  are a much easier way to showcase
[3:41:58.740 --> 3:42:00.740]  my morality than actually being
[3:42:00.740 --> 3:42:02.740]  moral because in order to be a real good
[3:42:02.740 --> 3:42:04.740]  person I got to stand up to a real
[3:42:04.740 --> 3:42:06.740]  bad person and I don't like standing up
[3:42:06.740 --> 3:42:08.740]  to two or four anything I decided
[3:42:08.740 --> 3:42:10.740]  that it's much easier to trick my own mind
[3:42:10.740 --> 3:42:12.740]  to think in compliance as a virtue instead
[3:42:12.740 --> 3:42:14.740]  of what compliance actually is
[3:42:14.740 --> 3:42:16.740]  cowardice I prefer to float through life
[3:42:16.740 --> 3:42:18.740]  completely ignorant to the fact that every
[3:42:18.740 --> 3:42:20.740]  socialist takeover has always begun
[3:42:20.740 --> 3:42:22.740]  in the exact same way with government
[3:42:22.740 --> 3:42:24.740]  overreach public shaming censorship
[3:42:24.740 --> 3:42:26.740]  and a toilet paper shortage don't believe
[3:42:26.740 --> 3:42:28.740]  me Google toilet paper shortage
[3:42:28.740 --> 3:42:30.740]  in communist Russia did you think you were
[3:42:30.740 --> 3:42:32.740]  having a unique experience I prefer
[3:42:32.740 --> 3:42:34.740]  to pretend history never repeats itself
[3:42:34.740 --> 3:42:36.740]  so that I can stand by and turn a blind
[3:42:36.740 --> 3:42:38.740]  eye every time history repeats
[3:42:38.740 --> 3:42:40.740]  itself I prefer to call anyone who speaks
[3:42:40.740 --> 3:42:42.740]  up fights back or stands their ground
[3:42:42.740 --> 3:42:44.740]  a lunatic or a conspiracy theorist so
[3:42:44.740 --> 3:42:46.740]  that I don't feel obligated to do my own
[3:42:46.740 --> 3:42:48.740]  research research takes away from me time
[3:42:48.740 --> 3:42:50.740]  and lastly I prefer to put on my
[3:42:50.740 --> 3:42:52.740]  mask and stand among the sea of
[3:42:52.740 --> 3:42:54.740]  masks so that I never have to be seen
[3:42:54.740 --> 3:42:56.740]  be free or reveal the deep
[3:42:56.740 --> 3:42:58.740]  dark shadows that lurk within me
[3:43:00.740 --> 3:43:02.740]  just wear the damn mask you
[3:43:02.740 --> 3:43:04.740]  hear what they say just take the damn
[3:43:04.740 --> 3:43:06.740]  vaccine just take the damn
[3:43:06.740 --> 3:43:08.740]  microchip very very slippery slope
[3:43:08.740 --> 3:43:10.740]  isn't it and it's a slippery slope in
[3:43:10.740 --> 3:43:12.740]  Melbourne where they just
[3:43:12.740 --> 3:43:14.740]  had another draconian lockdown
[3:43:14.740 --> 3:43:16.740]  based again on a spike
[3:43:16.740 --> 3:43:18.740]  in cases which could be traced back
[3:43:18.740 --> 3:43:20.740]  to one particular incident
[3:43:20.740 --> 3:43:22.740]  it's not a widespread phenomenon
[3:43:22.740 --> 3:43:24.740]  and yet in Melbourne
[3:43:24.740 --> 3:43:26.740]  hundreds of police
[3:43:26.740 --> 3:43:28.740]  were deployed to surround tower
[3:43:28.740 --> 3:43:30.740]  blocks to enforce coronavirus
[3:43:30.740 --> 3:43:32.740]  lockdown and not just police
[3:43:32.740 --> 3:43:34.740]  from the images that I saw
[3:43:34.740 --> 3:43:36.740]  they had national guard out there
[3:43:36.740 --> 3:43:38.740]  within minutes of this government
[3:43:38.740 --> 3:43:40.740]  announcement they had
[3:43:40.740 --> 3:43:42.740]  literal police surrounding residential
[3:43:42.740 --> 3:43:44.740]  tower blocks to stop
[3:43:44.740 --> 3:43:46.740]  people escaping
[3:43:46.740 --> 3:43:48.740]  residents of the state of Victoria
[3:43:48.740 --> 3:43:50.740]  in which Melbourne is located
[3:43:50.740 --> 3:43:52.740]  were told quote where you
[3:43:52.740 --> 3:43:54.740]  slept last night is where you'll need to stay
[3:43:54.740 --> 3:43:56.740]  for the next six weeks
[3:43:56.740 --> 3:43:58.740]  so bad luck if you were staying in a
[3:43:58.740 --> 3:44:00.740]  hotel in Melbourne
[3:44:00.740 --> 3:44:02.740]  last week or earlier this week
[3:44:02.740 --> 3:44:04.740]  because you have to stay there
[3:44:04.740 --> 3:44:06.740]  for the next six weeks
[3:44:06.740 --> 3:44:08.740]  they have a curfew from 8pm to
[3:44:08.740 --> 3:44:10.740]  5am they have fines
[3:44:10.740 --> 3:44:12.740]  which have now been increased to
[3:44:12.740 --> 3:44:14.740]  five thousand dollars
[3:44:14.740 --> 3:44:16.740]  for flouting any of these
[3:44:16.740 --> 3:44:18.740]  new guidelines
[3:44:18.740 --> 3:44:20.740]  they have police equipped with number plate
[3:44:20.740 --> 3:44:22.740]  recognition cameras to catch
[3:44:22.740 --> 3:44:24.740]  and find anyone not complying with the new rules
[3:44:24.740 --> 3:44:26.740]  and now we have this headline
[3:44:26.740 --> 3:44:28.740]  Melbourne lockdown police can enter
[3:44:28.740 --> 3:44:30.740]  homes without a warrant to carry out
[3:44:30.740 --> 3:44:32.740]  spot checks
[3:44:32.740 --> 3:44:34.740]  and maybe we'll be seeing this in the
[3:44:34.740 --> 3:44:36.740]  United States soon given that
[3:44:36.740 --> 3:44:38.740]  we've started to hear noises about
[3:44:38.740 --> 3:44:40.740]  enforcing mask wearing indoors
[3:44:40.740 --> 3:44:42.740]  police in Melbourne Australia now have
[3:44:42.740 --> 3:44:44.740]  the power to enter people's homes without
[3:44:44.740 --> 3:44:46.740]  warrant and perform spot checks to enforce
[3:44:46.740 --> 3:44:48.740]  compliance with new
[3:44:48.740 --> 3:44:50.740]  coronavirus lockdown rules
[3:44:50.740 --> 3:44:52.740]  they declared a state of disaster
[3:44:52.740 --> 3:44:54.740]  in response to a spike in coronavirus
[3:44:54.740 --> 3:44:56.740]  virus cases
[3:44:56.740 --> 3:44:58.740]  and premier of the state Daniel Andrews
[3:44:58.740 --> 3:45:00.740]  told residents we can no longer have people
[3:45:00.740 --> 3:45:02.740]  simply out and about for no good reason whatsoever
[3:45:02.740 --> 3:45:04.740]  so the police
[3:45:04.740 --> 3:45:06.740]  literally now have the power in Australia
[3:45:06.740 --> 3:45:08.740]  to come to your house
[3:45:08.740 --> 3:45:10.740]  and check that you're in there
[3:45:10.740 --> 3:45:12.740]  check that you're basically under house arrest
[3:45:12.740 --> 3:45:14.740]  it's basic house arrest situation
[3:45:14.740 --> 3:45:16.740]  in Melbourne right now
[3:45:16.740 --> 3:45:18.740]  meanwhile in Sweden
[3:45:18.740 --> 3:45:20.740]  which didn't lock down at all
[3:45:20.740 --> 3:45:22.740]  and which actually trusted its citizens
[3:45:22.740 --> 3:45:24.740]  to carry out sensible advice at the
[3:45:24.740 --> 3:45:26.740]  peak of the coronavirus pandemic
[3:45:26.740 --> 3:45:28.740]  which the media said would be a
[3:45:28.740 --> 3:45:30.740]  complete disaster and lead
[3:45:30.740 --> 3:45:32.740]  to hundreds of thousands of deaths
[3:45:32.740 --> 3:45:34.740]  well look what happened we were right
[3:45:34.740 --> 3:45:36.740]  once again and Newsweek
[3:45:36.740 --> 3:45:38.740]  is having to admit it
[3:45:38.740 --> 3:45:40.740]  with the headline Sweden which had never had
[3:45:40.740 --> 3:45:42.740]  lockdown sees COVID-19
[3:45:42.740 --> 3:45:44.740]  cases plummet as rested the Europe
[3:45:44.740 --> 3:45:46.740]  suffers spike
[3:45:46.740 --> 3:45:48.740]  of course because they had
[3:45:48.740 --> 3:45:50.740]  general transmission which built
[3:45:50.740 --> 3:45:52.740]  up herd immunity
[3:45:52.740 --> 3:45:54.740]  says amid fears over a potential second wave
[3:45:54.740 --> 3:45:56.740]  of the novel coronavirus across Europe
[3:45:56.740 --> 3:45:58.740]  new infections in Sweden where full lockdown
[3:45:58.740 --> 3:46:00.740]  measures were not implemented
[3:46:00.740 --> 3:46:02.740]  have mostly declined since late
[3:46:02.740 --> 3:46:04.740]  June the number of new cases
[3:46:04.740 --> 3:46:06.740]  for 100,000 people in Sweden reported
[3:46:06.740 --> 3:46:08.740]  over the last 14 days
[3:46:08.740 --> 3:46:10.740]  since July 29
[3:46:10.740 --> 3:46:12.740]  dropped by 54%
[3:46:12.740 --> 3:46:14.740]  from the figure reported over 14 days
[3:46:14.740 --> 3:46:16.740]  prior to then according to the latest report
[3:46:16.740 --> 3:46:18.740]  Wednesday from the WHO
[3:46:18.740 --> 3:46:20.740]  so no lockdowns in Sweden
[3:46:20.740 --> 3:46:22.740]  no crippling
[3:46:22.740 --> 3:46:24.740]  of their economy
[3:46:24.740 --> 3:46:26.740]  no children out of school
[3:46:26.740 --> 3:46:28.740]  or at least very few which of course
[3:46:28.740 --> 3:46:30.740]  ruins their education makes them
[3:46:30.740 --> 3:46:32.740]  ill unhappy depressed
[3:46:32.740 --> 3:46:34.740]  makes their parents depressed
[3:46:34.740 --> 3:46:36.740]  really causes drastic harm
[3:46:36.740 --> 3:46:38.740]  when you keep children out of school for any length of time
[3:46:40.740 --> 3:46:42.740]  they didn't do any of that they didn't enforce
[3:46:42.740 --> 3:46:44.740]  the wearing of masks and now
[3:46:44.740 --> 3:46:46.740]  they are in a perfect position
[3:46:46.740 --> 3:46:48.740]  the rest of Europe
[3:46:48.740 --> 3:46:50.740]  apparently suffering a spike the actual
[3:46:50.740 --> 3:46:52.740]  spike is minimal but
[3:46:52.740 --> 3:46:54.740]  Sweden's cases are plummeting
[3:46:54.740 --> 3:46:56.740]  they did not lock down we were proven
[3:46:56.740 --> 3:46:58.740]  right once again
[3:47:00.740 --> 3:47:02.740]  Netherlands refuses to mandate masks
[3:47:02.740 --> 3:47:04.740]  Sweden says they are pointless I discussed that
[3:47:04.740 --> 3:47:06.740]  earlier the top epidemiologists in
[3:47:06.740 --> 3:47:08.740]  Sweden says that the masks are completely
[3:47:08.740 --> 3:47:10.740]  pointless government of the Netherlands
[3:47:10.740 --> 3:47:12.740]  says it's not going to enforce it because
[3:47:12.740 --> 3:47:14.740]  doesn't have any benefit whatsoever
[3:47:14.740 --> 3:47:16.740]  meanwhile in the UK and the US
[3:47:16.740 --> 3:47:18.740]  we have
[3:47:18.740 --> 3:47:20.740]  literally walking around screaming
[3:47:20.740 --> 3:47:22.740]  spitting snot on people's faces
[3:47:22.740 --> 3:47:24.740]  macing them in the face
[3:47:24.740 --> 3:47:26.740]  throwing coffee over them
[3:47:26.740 --> 3:47:28.740]  for not being the good people
[3:47:28.740 --> 3:47:30.740]  absolutely incredible
[3:47:30.740 --> 3:47:32.740]  shifting topics
[3:47:32.740 --> 3:47:34.740]  Breitbart reports migrant boats
[3:47:34.740 --> 3:47:36.740]  shadowed into British waters by friendships
[3:47:36.740 --> 3:47:38.740]  friendships were seen
[3:47:38.740 --> 3:47:40.740]  apparently escorting illegal migrants
[3:47:40.740 --> 3:47:42.740]  in small boats across the English Channel
[3:47:42.740 --> 3:47:44.740]  again on Tuesday
[3:47:44.740 --> 3:47:46.740]  we've had
[3:47:46.740 --> 3:47:48.740]  3,000 of these migrants
[3:47:48.740 --> 3:47:50.740]  enter into the country this year alone
[3:47:50.740 --> 3:47:52.740]  meanwhile we're being told we have to
[3:47:52.740 --> 3:47:54.740]  quarantine and be under house arrest
[3:47:54.740 --> 3:47:56.740]  if we come back from holiday in Spain
[3:47:56.740 --> 3:47:58.740]  but our own government
[3:47:58.740 --> 3:48:00.740]  which supposedly was elected to reduce
[3:48:00.740 --> 3:48:02.740]  immigration is literally providing
[3:48:02.740 --> 3:48:04.740]  a taxi service
[3:48:04.740 --> 3:48:06.740]  for migrants of unknown origin
[3:48:06.740 --> 3:48:08.740]  unknown documentation
[3:48:08.740 --> 3:48:10.740]  to flood into the country on a daily
[3:48:10.740 --> 3:48:12.740]  basis and nothing is being
[3:48:12.740 --> 3:48:14.740]  done about it
[3:48:14.740 --> 3:48:16.740]  why is that important?
[3:48:16.740 --> 3:48:18.740]  well because in numerous cases
[3:48:18.740 --> 3:48:20.740]  migrants who exploited the refugee
[3:48:20.740 --> 3:48:22.740]  wave to get into Europe went on to
[3:48:22.740 --> 3:48:24.740]  commit massive terror attacks
[3:48:24.740 --> 3:48:26.740]  which killed a bunch of people
[3:48:26.740 --> 3:48:28.740]  I flashed back
[3:48:28.740 --> 3:48:30.740]  to this headline navy rescued
[3:48:30.740 --> 3:48:32.740]  Manchester bomber Salman Abadi
[3:48:32.740 --> 3:48:34.740]  from war-torn Libya 3 days before
[3:48:34.740 --> 3:48:36.740]  deadly terror attack
[3:48:36.740 --> 3:48:38.740]  this was the guy
[3:48:38.740 --> 3:48:40.740]  who literally bombed a pop concert
[3:48:40.740 --> 3:48:42.740]  full of children
[3:48:42.740 --> 3:48:44.740]  massacring dozens
[3:48:44.740 --> 3:48:46.740]  we rescued him by boat
[3:48:46.740 --> 3:48:48.740]  from Libya
[3:48:48.740 --> 3:48:50.740]  this is what happens
[3:48:50.740 --> 3:48:52.740]  another headline
[3:48:52.740 --> 3:48:54.740]  7 of the 9G had is involved in the Paris
[3:48:54.740 --> 3:48:56.740]  terror attacks entered Europe through
[3:48:56.740 --> 3:48:58.740]  Hungary pretending to be refugees
[3:48:58.740 --> 3:49:00.740]  headline out of CNN
[3:49:00.740 --> 3:49:02.740]  and this was all admitted
[3:49:02.740 --> 3:49:04.740]  back in 2016
[3:49:04.740 --> 3:49:06.740]  they probably wouldn't admit to it now
[3:49:06.740 --> 3:49:08.740]  passport linked to terrorists
[3:49:08.740 --> 3:49:10.740]  complicate Syrian refugee crisis
[3:49:10.740 --> 3:49:12.740]  they found a passport
[3:49:12.740 --> 3:49:14.740]  used by one of the bombers
[3:49:14.740 --> 3:49:16.740]  in Paris
[3:49:16.740 --> 3:49:18.740]  that horrific attack which killed what?
[3:49:18.740 --> 3:49:20.740]  200 people
[3:49:20.740 --> 3:49:22.740]  and it was obviously a refugee
[3:49:22.740 --> 3:49:24.740]  he did a fake test all in a passport
[3:49:24.740 --> 3:49:26.740]  where importing these people
[3:49:26.740 --> 3:49:28.740]  our supposedly conservative government
[3:49:28.740 --> 3:49:30.740]  on a daily basis
[3:49:30.740 --> 3:49:32.740]  meanwhile they're telling us we have to quarantine
[3:49:32.740 --> 3:49:34.740]  under house arrest
[3:49:34.740 --> 3:49:36.740]  that's going to wrap it up for the show
[3:49:36.740 --> 3:49:38.740]  summit.news coming up next
[3:49:38.740 --> 3:50:06.740]  don't go away.
