[00:30.000 --> 00:59.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, June 18th, 2019, and one of the top news stories
[00:59.960 --> 01:05.560]  in the United States, not just here, but also in Europe, is the headline of headlines,
[01:05.560 --> 01:14.280]  the fake news coup de grace, the fake news finale, in my view, but it'll only get worse,
[01:14.280 --> 01:15.280]  obviously.
[01:15.280 --> 01:16.920]  They've reached new heights.
[01:16.920 --> 01:20.960]  Alex Jones sent child porn to Sandy Hook families.
[01:20.960 --> 01:27.480]  Boy, that would be a better idea to commit suicide than to do that, wouldn't it?
[01:27.480 --> 01:33.720]  And then, hundreds of articles, both the local papers here in Central Texas, San Antonio,
[01:33.720 --> 01:44.240]  Austin, America statesmen, front-paged Alex Jones sent child porn to the Sandy Hook families.
[01:44.240 --> 01:46.080]  Total lie.
[01:46.080 --> 01:51.680]  That's after dozens of publications over the weekend reported that we were the victims
[01:51.680 --> 01:58.240]  of someone sending hidden, coded child porn embedded in an email that had nothing to do
[01:58.240 --> 02:07.240]  with sex or anything else that was never opened until we were subpoenaed by the Democrat
[02:07.240 --> 02:13.040]  party lawyers in Connecticut.
[02:13.040 --> 02:21.160]  And reportedly, they went to the FBI seeking my indictment and reportedly are still seeking
[02:21.160 --> 02:24.440]  it, saying, I transmitted child porn.
[02:24.440 --> 02:30.720]  I've talked to five famous criminal lawyers today and they say, unprecedented, no one
[02:30.720 --> 02:35.860]  would ever indict you for that, but they're trying because they don't have their Sandy
[02:35.860 --> 02:36.860]  Hook case.
[02:36.860 --> 02:37.860]  It's fallen apart.
[02:37.860 --> 02:41.240]  It's all based in lies and they're panicking.
[02:41.240 --> 02:45.720]  Now dredgerport.com over the weekend linked to my video breaking this down, the reward
[02:45.720 --> 02:49.280]  I offered.
[02:49.280 --> 02:51.160]  And I have the heart for current.
[02:51.160 --> 02:58.280]  I have all of the news articles right here where the FBI says I'm the victim, that this
[02:58.280 --> 03:01.360]  is a very common practice.
[03:01.360 --> 03:05.320]  I've talked to a lot of famous people I know who people tried to set up by sending them
[03:05.320 --> 03:10.600]  stuff that says, oh, here's photos of us on vacation and then it's child porn.
[03:10.600 --> 03:14.040]  We don't open attachments that we don't know who they're coming from.
[03:14.040 --> 03:19.640]  We've had to call the FBI when we found this before and it's just routine and they pass
[03:19.640 --> 03:25.040]  you on to an organization that tracks that anyone that's run a big web company or anything
[03:25.040 --> 03:28.240]  that has a lot of traffic has been sent this garbage.
[03:28.240 --> 03:31.800]  What's crazy is that the news came out over the weekend.
[03:31.800 --> 03:33.240]  We were the victim.
[03:33.240 --> 03:34.720]  Even the Daily Beast reported it.
[03:34.720 --> 03:39.520]  It was in it was in USA today all over.
[03:39.520 --> 03:49.560]  Then Monday afternoon it hits Jones with files sent this to the families and the young Turks
[03:49.560 --> 03:50.560]  and others.
[03:50.560 --> 03:51.560]  I saw the video this morning.
[03:51.560 --> 03:55.360]  They said Jones is going down for child porn good.
[03:55.360 --> 03:56.520]  It's the end of him.
[03:56.520 --> 04:03.360]  The commenters were yeah, glad he's getting arrested that pedophile.
[04:03.360 --> 04:07.040]  Well, isn't that just amazing?
[04:07.040 --> 04:10.800]  The young Turks removed the video.
[04:10.800 --> 04:13.600]  We need anyone that has it on a DVR to get it to us.
[04:13.600 --> 04:15.600]  We intend to file suit on them.
[04:15.600 --> 04:17.360]  This morning I was talking to our lawyers.
[04:17.360 --> 04:21.240]  That is the absolute defamation to destroy us.
[04:21.240 --> 04:25.040]  They said to take us off air, but they removed it.
[04:25.040 --> 04:32.800]  ABC News, the Associated Press, they're all changing their headlines now.
[04:32.800 --> 04:38.240]  They're all changing their headlines now because they all wrote articles not even telling the
[04:38.240 --> 04:41.480]  public that it was e-mail sent to us.
[04:41.480 --> 04:44.600]  They just said I sent child porn.
[04:44.600 --> 04:45.600]  Understand this.
[04:45.600 --> 04:48.400]  This means next level lying.
[04:48.400 --> 04:50.400]  Next level lying.
[04:50.400 --> 04:57.560]  You understand this is criminal defamation to destroy the First Amendment.
[04:57.560 --> 05:09.760]  So, the Info Wars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[05:09.760 --> 05:14.680]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[05:14.680 --> 05:15.680]  one another.
[05:15.680 --> 05:20.320]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[05:20.320 --> 05:25.120]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[05:25.120 --> 05:29.320]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[05:29.320 --> 05:33.680]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[05:33.680 --> 05:35.000]  in supporting Info Wars.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.320]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50
[05:39.320 --> 05:43.200]  a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate
[05:43.200 --> 05:44.200]  driven model.
[05:44.200 --> 05:48.440]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support
[05:48.440 --> 05:52.560]  letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[05:52.560 --> 05:57.320]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration
[05:57.320 --> 06:03.760]  of free press and free speech with free markets.
[06:03.760 --> 06:10.440]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[06:10.440 --> 06:15.280]  the Info War.
[06:15.280 --> 06:22.040]  I have agonized the last six months coming to you with this message because I don't like
[06:22.040 --> 06:27.760]  to let the enemy know their hardness, but there comes a time in a war when you're winning
[06:27.760 --> 06:35.320]  the war, but as a battalion or a platoon or an army, you're losing and you got a call
[06:35.320 --> 06:38.160]  for reinforcements, you got a call for help.
[06:38.160 --> 06:42.120]  There's a lot of things people don't know about behind the scenes.
[06:42.120 --> 06:46.240]  It's been rough and sometimes I do melt down.
[06:46.240 --> 06:51.560]  Sometimes I've subconsciously shuttered rage and it like a volcano comes out and that only
[06:51.560 --> 06:54.800]  happens every once in a while and I've told the crew when that happens from now on, we
[06:54.800 --> 06:55.920]  just go to rebroadcast.
[06:55.920 --> 07:00.640]  That's a default position because I know our enemies are criminals.
[07:00.640 --> 07:01.640]  I know they're bad people.
[07:01.640 --> 07:06.480]  I know they've joined evil on purpose and I'm sick of them posing as if they're the
[07:06.480 --> 07:14.280]  good guys saying we are the bad guys.
[07:14.280 --> 07:21.400]  There is so much incredible news here today that I almost don't want to start with myself,
[07:21.400 --> 07:22.760]  even though it's a top news story.
[07:22.760 --> 07:25.640]  It's one of the top stories in the country.
[07:25.640 --> 07:31.640]  It is a planned premeditated operation to take us off the air because they've been losing
[07:31.640 --> 07:37.160]  their long-term strategic plan to bankrupt us with fake lawsuits and their lawsuits have
[07:37.160 --> 07:42.760]  been being proven fraudulent, even though some of them have procedurally moved forward.
[07:42.760 --> 07:46.680]  So they've shifted to clandestine operations, other things that I'm not at liberty to get
[07:46.680 --> 07:52.360]  into on air at this point, but I am facing embedded stay-behind networks in the Justice
[07:52.360 --> 07:55.680]  Department and in the CIA and other agencies.
[07:55.680 --> 08:02.600]  Now, there's only minority groups, small groups doing this, but they're in a lot of power
[08:02.600 --> 08:04.160]  positions still.
[08:04.160 --> 08:07.760]  Trump has not been able to get them all out because of traitors below him that will lie
[08:07.760 --> 08:13.520]  to him and say that somebody's good or such and such is bad.
[08:13.520 --> 08:18.000]  That said, though, there is organically so many good people in the FBI, in the Justice
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.160]  Department, in the bureaucracy who've just been doing their jobs.
[08:23.160 --> 08:27.040]  They are now becoming activated and they are now taking action.
[08:27.040 --> 08:32.200]  There have been 14-fold the arrest of pedophiles since Trump got in.
[08:32.200 --> 08:39.600]  Hillary's former top fundraiser just got busted trafficking in child porn.
[08:39.600 --> 08:47.640]  We've got this FBI agent that got caught setting up the governor in Missouri, just got arrested.
[08:47.640 --> 08:54.160]  So it's every few hours they're getting busted and the human traffickers are getting busted
[08:54.160 --> 08:58.480]  and the narcotics traffickers are getting busted and the MS-13's getting busted and
[08:58.480 --> 08:59.680]  this country's on the move.
[08:59.680 --> 09:03.960]  That's why the Democrats in the deep state are flipping out.
[09:03.960 --> 09:09.760]  Joe Biden has come out and said that we need a physical revolution against America.
[09:09.760 --> 09:10.760]  That's coming up.
[09:10.760 --> 09:16.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, we're in the middle of a revolution to take our country back
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  from criminals.
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.920]  Okay, so people ask, why am I so happy most of the time when we're being persecuted?
[09:22.920 --> 09:24.680]  It means that we're really over the target.
[09:24.680 --> 09:25.920]  It's not fun.
[09:25.920 --> 09:31.440]  It makes me angry, but there's also a real sense of satisfaction that when every TV station
[09:31.440 --> 09:38.040]  in the country, every major news outlet and every major paper, every paper in Texas, I've
[09:38.040 --> 09:41.360]  got family calling from Houston and Dallas and San Antonio.
[09:41.360 --> 09:46.760]  In some cases, I'm on the front of the newspaper as a child pornographer.
[09:46.760 --> 09:50.040]  Now, that's okay.
[09:50.040 --> 09:52.640]  It's not true.
[09:52.640 --> 09:55.560]  They said George Washington was a lot of bad stuff and I'm not comparing myself to George
[09:55.560 --> 09:56.560]  Washington.
[09:56.560 --> 10:06.480]  So, we were sent 12 emails that were in the trash folder that the Democrats subpoenaed
[10:06.480 --> 10:11.640]  with keywords that had hidden child porn links in it so that we would never find it.
[10:11.640 --> 10:12.840]  It was hidden links.
[10:12.840 --> 10:15.800]  The FBI said that.
[10:15.800 --> 10:18.000]  And then they tried to get the judge a few months ago.
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.920]  We've been in court seven times battling them in Connecticut on discovery.
[10:21.920 --> 10:27.000]  They tried to get the judge to order us to open all the attachments.
[10:27.000 --> 10:28.600]  That's like telling somebody to play Russian roulette.
[10:28.600 --> 10:32.360]  We don't open attachments unless we know who sent them.
[10:32.360 --> 10:38.080]  I've called the FBI out six, seven, I forget times when that people sent us child porn.
[10:38.080 --> 10:42.680]  It's not illegal if you open it and didn't know it was in it.
[10:42.680 --> 10:44.040]  We've called them before.
[10:44.040 --> 10:45.040]  They know that.
[10:45.040 --> 10:47.960]  I've been into the FBI about this stuff.
[10:47.960 --> 10:52.120]  They're like, hey, man, we're busy, just go here.
[10:52.120 --> 10:57.160]  So the headline is, Jones sent documents out of the clear blue sky to these poor Sandy
[10:57.160 --> 10:59.520]  Hook parents.
[10:59.520 --> 11:04.400]  According to the lawyers, one of them is a former federal prosecutor, a Democrat, of
[11:04.400 --> 11:05.400]  course.
[11:05.400 --> 11:10.120]  And they have been taking this material and taking it to the FBI and from our sources
[11:10.120 --> 11:11.760]  we're getting it ready for the news.
[11:11.760 --> 11:14.520]  I'm not saying they planted the email.
[11:14.520 --> 11:16.360]  I'm saying somebody planted it.
[11:16.360 --> 11:20.080]  We're going to find who they are, but I am angry at those individuals.
[11:20.080 --> 11:21.080]  But not physically.
[11:21.080 --> 11:25.480]  When I make statements about whoever planted it and I say I want to see their head on the
[11:25.480 --> 11:32.200]  pike, that is figurative and I have no record of ever attacking anybody offensively or any
[11:32.200 --> 11:33.200]  criminal record.
[11:33.200 --> 11:38.200]  But nevertheless, they're in court right now calling for all sorts of sanctions on me and
[11:38.200 --> 11:41.160]  they're trying to get criminal charges against me and all the rest of it.
[11:41.160 --> 11:44.280]  It's all a badge of honor, okay?
[11:44.280 --> 11:45.280]  It's all a badge of honor.
[11:45.280 --> 11:48.080]  And none of what they've said, it's all a fraud.
[11:48.080 --> 11:51.760]  It's all a lie and they know it.
[11:51.760 --> 11:55.360]  But think about that long and hard.
[11:55.360 --> 12:01.040]  We get sent needle in a haystack, invisible needle in a haystack.
[12:01.040 --> 12:08.680]  Imagine if you owned a bookstore and had 20,000 books in it and you ordered a couple of books
[12:08.680 --> 12:15.120]  and one of them had a postcard of child porn slipped in it and a week after the book arrives
[12:15.120 --> 12:19.360]  the police come in and say we got told there's a postcard in this exact book over here and
[12:19.360 --> 12:20.720]  they go and open it.
[12:20.720 --> 12:24.880]  You would say to the police, who told you that was there?
[12:24.880 --> 12:27.200]  That's your suspect.
[12:27.200 --> 12:30.880]  This is 101, deduction, my dear Watson.
[12:30.880 --> 12:38.960]  On what planet would I send child porn to the people the Democratic Party are using to
[12:38.960 --> 12:40.120]  try to destroy me?
[12:40.120 --> 12:42.560]  I mean, again, why not just commit suicide?
[12:42.560 --> 12:43.560]  I would never do that.
[12:43.560 --> 12:44.560]  I didn't do that.
[12:44.560 --> 12:48.800]  But if you read the hundreds of articles, and I'm going to show you dozens of them here,
[12:48.800 --> 12:56.280]  type in my name in to Google News, it says lawyers for the Sandy Hook family say Jones
[12:56.280 --> 13:03.240]  sent the families and or them child porn on documents.
[13:03.240 --> 13:09.040]  Now, you could say technically in some twisted way that's one-tenth true.
[13:09.040 --> 13:10.040]  I didn't send it.
[13:10.040 --> 13:12.120]  Two law firms reviewed it.
[13:12.120 --> 13:15.920]  It was hidden only a computer scientist would find it.
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.800]  The links didn't say what they were by name.
[13:17.800 --> 13:18.800]  We never opened it.
[13:18.800 --> 13:29.880]  They're in court right now in Connecticut in New Haven saying that I was knew this or
[13:29.880 --> 13:34.480]  I was flagrantly negligent and that I should have opened all the attachments.
[13:34.480 --> 13:39.880]  Yeah, they first wanted 9.6 million emails since Sandy Hook, all of them.
[13:39.880 --> 13:45.760]  We fought them to the expense of $100,000 in legal fees just for that to not give them
[13:45.760 --> 13:47.200]  all your emails.
[13:47.200 --> 13:50.360]  She wanted 57,000, the judge did.
[13:50.360 --> 13:54.600]  Then they wanted the metadata, all that weird squiggly stuff that nobody can read.
[13:54.600 --> 14:00.200]  That was then gone over and they found what was in those links, those links that were
[14:00.200 --> 14:03.560]  named something else on there.
[14:03.560 --> 14:06.960]  So we got out ahead of it.
[14:06.960 --> 14:11.200]  Then we said what the FBI had told us that we were the victim and the media ran with
[14:11.200 --> 14:17.480]  the truth and then somebody up higher said we can't have this, put out the headline Jones
[14:17.480 --> 14:19.920]  sent child porn to the Sandy Hook families.
[14:19.920 --> 14:24.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, just this weekend, the New York Times said that Trump ordered giant
[14:24.480 --> 14:28.680]  cyber attacks to bring down the Russian power grid, a total act of war.
[14:28.680 --> 14:32.600]  Trump came out and said it's treason, none of it's true.
[14:32.600 --> 14:34.720]  My point is this isn't just me.
[14:34.720 --> 14:38.080]  The left and the globalist have gone completely insane.
[14:38.080 --> 14:44.680]  Instead of telling whopper lies, they're telling super dangerous criminal lies now.
[14:44.680 --> 14:48.360]  Trying to get us into wars, leaking this info.
[14:48.360 --> 14:50.720]  They have thrown all reason to the wind.
[14:50.720 --> 14:55.760]  They are mad dog crazy.
[14:55.760 --> 14:57.840]  And so it is bigger than Alex Jones.
[14:57.840 --> 14:58.840]  It's bigger than America.
[14:58.840 --> 14:59.840]  It's bigger than Trump.
[14:59.840 --> 15:00.840]  It's bigger than you.
[15:00.840 --> 15:07.840]  It's about the whole world and it's about the truth and it's about people trying to
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.760]  get me indicted for emails.
[15:11.760 --> 15:14.440]  We never opened anybody could email you anything.
[15:14.440 --> 15:16.600]  People get this crap all the time.
[15:16.600 --> 15:20.400]  People with small email accounts get this stuff.
[15:20.400 --> 15:25.720]  It's well known and they then thought hell, we got 9 million emails.
[15:25.720 --> 15:27.240]  This is what I think is going on.
[15:27.240 --> 15:29.840]  We're going to find something and you know what, isn't it funny?
[15:29.840 --> 15:31.640]  They found it under Sandy Hook.
[15:31.640 --> 15:33.760]  Isn't that just cute?
[15:33.760 --> 15:37.600]  And secret links to child porn and then it's my fault.
[15:37.600 --> 15:38.600]  I did it.
[15:38.600 --> 15:39.600]  Really?
[15:39.600 --> 15:43.800]  That's like saying if somebody mailed you child porn, you thought it was junk mail, didn't
[15:43.800 --> 15:49.640]  open it, didn't recognize it, threw it away and then oh, somebody calls the cops and says
[15:49.640 --> 15:52.720]  there's child porn in your trash because they're sitting across the street with binoculars.
[15:52.720 --> 15:55.120]  Who do the cops then talk to?
[15:55.120 --> 15:59.440]  Me or the guys across the street?

[16:24.000 --> 16:25.520]  bank of the Mississippi.
[16:25.520 --> 16:29.360]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[16:29.360 --> 16:33.120]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[16:33.120 --> 16:37.480]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory.

[20:03.000 --> 20:28.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:28.280 --> 20:52.360]  Okay, there is so many child porn busts and actual bust of people trafficking children
[20:52.360 --> 20:54.040]  happening right now.
[20:54.040 --> 20:59.080]  It's about 5,000 the last week and we mentioned it last week but there's been new big busts
[20:59.080 --> 21:02.480]  so I'm asking the crew to print me those articles.
[21:02.480 --> 21:11.000]  Crime boss closing arguments in the NXIVM trial, Satanism, Mexico Child Trafficking,
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.600]  Hillary Schumer and Gillibrand Ties.
[21:15.600 --> 21:21.880]  Now that's mainstream news, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:21.880 --> 21:24.320]  That's coming up next hour.
[21:24.320 --> 21:31.160]  Why do you think they ran this child porn story on me today and yesterday?
[21:31.160 --> 21:36.520]  Because when this came out in the trial, yesterday morning, they began to crap brick factories.
[21:36.520 --> 21:39.760]  What did I tell you?
[21:39.760 --> 21:44.440]  That organization was involved in before it was even in the news, branding women, shaining
[21:44.440 --> 21:46.800]  them down, Satanism, starving them to death.
[21:46.800 --> 21:53.000]  I said they like to make the women emaciated to hurt the power of femininity and then of
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.960]  course they reportedly killed a lot of few of them.
[21:55.960 --> 22:03.000]  Oh, I told you all about that at Harvey Weinstein and do you remember the news?
[22:03.000 --> 22:07.000]  Even the Huffington Post said Alex Jones has defamed Harvey Weinstein and claims he's
[22:07.000 --> 22:12.120]  tied to cults in New York and California into Mexico.
[22:12.120 --> 22:18.920]  I was told that by law enforcement and by Army special operations individuals in the
[22:18.920 --> 22:21.920]  CIA.
[22:21.920 --> 22:28.560]  I was given specific briefings so that I would have credibility six months later when it broke.
[22:28.560 --> 22:34.120]  Yes, yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:34.120 --> 22:39.880]  It's not about the sex, it's about the humiliation, it's a form of psychic vampirism and they
[22:39.880 --> 22:47.840]  know I have their number and they are pissed and so magically we got sent child porn we
[22:47.840 --> 22:53.320]  never opened and the FBI admits it but the press picked that up this weekend but it's
[22:53.320 --> 23:01.560]  been under the rug now and you transform it into Alex Jones is the child porn man.
[23:01.560 --> 23:07.960]  I have my head high and I know the Lib Tards will be on the street, it'll be the new thing.
[23:07.960 --> 23:12.440]  Child pervert and I'll be like, oh really, you're the ones that want to legalize sex
[23:12.440 --> 23:16.240]  with kids, you're the ones at the gay pride parades everywhere with eight-year-old shaking
[23:16.240 --> 23:20.560]  their asses, you're the ones with the little drag queen kids admitting you want to sexualize
[23:20.560 --> 23:29.640]  them, you know that it's your God that wants to hurt kids, I'm on the other team, bucko.
[23:29.640 --> 23:36.200]  You know damn well, you will know a tree by its fruits, you guys endorse and support this
[23:36.200 --> 23:45.000]  and you're all getting arrested for actually having dead kids on you and now it's all gonna
[23:45.000 --> 23:56.360]  come out, the whole house of cards is starting to fall, you think the NXIVM cult is the only
[23:56.360 --> 24:07.960]  one and that little Alistair Crowley sigil, a cult symbol they put on those women, unbelievable.
[24:07.960 --> 24:15.960]  They're all drowned in the lakes of blood, that's figurative in literary from that literal
[24:15.960 --> 24:25.400]  literary from Robert E. Howard and his writings about Tulsa Doom and his mountain of power,
[24:25.400 --> 24:30.880]  these are a diagram such as this for me which is then remade into Conan the Barbarian written
[24:30.880 --> 24:41.240]  by who, Millis and Stone, if you watch that movie you get it underground under a mountain
[24:41.240 --> 24:51.080]  Satanist chopping up and eating women and children but first they have sex with them
[24:51.080 --> 24:55.360]  and Hollywood didn't want that movie released they were mad about it and said it was fascist
[24:55.360 --> 25:08.880]  and anti-gay, very interesting which means anti-pito, I'm sorry I'm digressing, when
[25:08.880 --> 25:13.840]  we come back Robert Barnes constitutional lawyer will be joining us to talk about the
[25:13.840 --> 25:19.280]  next phase he was up all night long and we're getting ready to already follow some suits
[25:19.280 --> 25:23.960]  it takes money to do that but these are not come out of the park suits now against the
[25:23.960 --> 25:29.920]  young Turks and others who did remove their video that's not enough they have to state
[25:29.920 --> 25:33.400]  what the FBI stated they have to state with the Harper current stated that I am the victim
[25:33.400 --> 25:37.320]  of child porn and that they got up there and didn't say it was an email nothing they said
[25:37.320 --> 25:43.720]  this lunatic mailed child porn to the families and then they cut together me yelling and
[25:43.720 --> 25:51.480]  screaming about it deceptively Alex Jones sent lawyers for Sandy Hook families child
[25:51.480 --> 26:01.600]  pornography filings say Wall Street Journal oh does it tell you that we never opened it
[26:01.600 --> 26:06.240]  and that the lawyers specifically asked for it and they had to scan it to find the secret
[26:06.240 --> 26:11.280]  links or that they wanted the court to order us to open all attachments and give us all
[26:11.280 --> 26:17.760]  attachments ordering us to go through all our emails and open attachments when we don't
[26:17.760 --> 26:23.720]  do that and I told Norm Pattison I told them all Norm's a good guy and I said Norm they
[26:23.720 --> 26:28.360]  already know there's something in there that we don't know about this is parallel construction
[26:28.360 --> 26:34.560]  I said you watch he was here the week before this happened I said they're not winning these
[26:34.560 --> 26:40.040]  cases and I said we're getting diverted by these we're getting we're getting manipulated
[26:40.040 --> 26:48.960]  and we're winning these cases too easily these aren't the sabotage traps and Norm last night
[26:48.960 --> 26:53.880]  was a great guy he just said I've never seen anything like it I'm speechless he said I've
[26:53.880 --> 26:58.880]  been doing this 35 40 years he's a top criminal lawyer you see him all the news civil rights
[26:58.880 --> 27:03.480]  lawyer first amendment where he says I've never seen it like this they know they've talked
[27:03.480 --> 27:08.040]  to the FBI they know that you didn't do this and they're all going forward and they're
[27:08.040 --> 27:15.640]  trying to get him indicted now saying he sent child porn he said I defend murderers and
[27:15.640 --> 27:19.080]  I don't get any pressure with you it's the end of the world because it's taking Trump's
[27:19.080 --> 27:25.000]  base out it's taking the first amendment out and they are in Connecticut and in Travis

[27:40.920 --> 27:45.080]  and I'll never back down I'll never surrender in the face of this but I could feel it in
[27:45.080 --> 27:52.040]  the last few weeks and I told you I said you know for six months we've been losing money

[32:22.440 --> 32:26.400]  support before and thanks for keeping us afloat but this is the real SOS if you don't buy
[32:26.400 --> 32:31.280]  a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting info wars will be shut down
[32:31.280 --> 32:35.880]  not just crippled and so we've reached that point it'll make the enemy happy but you know
[32:35.880 --> 32:39.840]  whatever we have was good so many of their attacks we've gone through so much because
[32:39.840 --> 32:44.720]  of your support you have you have been there but let me tell you they are pissed they haven't
[32:44.720 --> 32:49.200]  been successful and they're giving us their full assault so we need your prayers your
[32:49.200 --> 32:54.760]  financial support and your word of mouth now and info wars store.com it's your fight decide
[32:54.760 --> 33:21.720]  whether or not you want info wars to continue because we could be shut down.
[33:21.720 --> 33:39.080]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones.
[33:39.080 --> 33:45.000]  This is it ladies and gentlemen not a drill not a game I have a three inch stack of mainstream
[33:45.000 --> 33:58.200]  news articles about this sex cult in XIVM that we first reported on and Satanism Mexico
[33:58.200 --> 34:03.440]  child kidnapping and trafficking into the US for the Democrats to literally gobble Hillary
[34:03.440 --> 34:12.280]  Schumer Gillibrand ties this is the reality I want to bring Robert Barnes on the show
[34:12.280 --> 34:16.680]  constitutional lawyer civil rights lawyer very successful free speech lawyer he represents
[34:16.680 --> 34:21.760]  me on a bunch of cases the Democrats and their operatives have brought the Sandy Hook cases
[34:21.760 --> 34:27.360]  in Texas Norm Pattis also a very competent top lawyer representing me in Connecticut
[34:27.360 --> 34:32.200]  he's in court right now where they're trying to claim that I threatened violence against
[34:32.200 --> 34:36.320]  their lawyers which wasn't true I said I'd like to see whoever sent us the child porn's
[34:36.320 --> 34:41.640]  head on a pike that's a figurative statement you know like if I catch the you know my son
[34:41.640 --> 34:46.400]  sneaking the car out again I'm gonna kill him but they're up there trying to haul me
[34:46.400 --> 34:50.800]  up to Connecticut make me be there for depositions in the courthouse like I'm a criminal all of
[34:50.800 --> 34:56.680]  this for the theater of the media all of this with the timeline so I want to go through
[34:56.680 --> 35:04.240]  the timeline of this fraud and the fact that Robert I see this as signifying a major insane
[35:04.240 --> 35:09.560]  escalation from going from whopper lies to just gargantuan super dangerous lies and
[35:09.560 --> 35:13.680]  so they can beta test this on me it's gonna be used on Trump and others they've already
[35:13.680 --> 35:18.960]  tried this stuff on Trump and anybody at Trump hotel or Trump towers or anybody could have
[35:18.960 --> 35:23.200]  someone send email that you never even open that's in your junk box that has another name
[35:23.200 --> 35:29.640]  with hidden links they didn't even say child porn and then people magically you know folks
[35:29.640 --> 35:35.480]  that can find invisible needles and haystacks they sue you and ask for those emails that
[35:35.480 --> 35:40.240]  you never read send them to the FBI and a low and behold the FBI says we're the victim
[35:40.240 --> 35:47.400]  that comes out in the new Saturday and then suddenly on Monday hundreds of major publications
[35:47.400 --> 35:53.040]  when I say hundreds it's in the thousands German news Russian news French news US news
[35:53.040 --> 35:57.800]  everything from the New York Times to the Wall Street Journal the LA Times Alex Jones
[35:57.800 --> 36:05.560]  sent child porn to the family's what a monster my gosh none of it's true but none of them
[36:05.560 --> 36:11.800]  even picked up what the FBI said now suddenly the young Turks that were the worst they said
[36:11.800 --> 36:16.680]  that I knowingly sent child porn and that my was over and I was gonna go to jail now
[36:16.680 --> 36:20.000]  they've since removed that video I know you may have something to do with it but we need
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.480]  somebody to find it and send it to us at showtipsinforce.com because I watched it early this morning
[36:24.480 --> 36:30.480]  with my mouth hanging open because they knew the truth they said he sent them files hope
[36:30.480 --> 36:34.600]  you know he's a criminal oh he knew he did it he's a pervert and the left all doing
[36:34.600 --> 36:40.520]  this while we're closing in on Hillary 5,000 arrested pedophiles the last two weeks just
[36:40.520 --> 36:46.560]  incredible things going on Trump delivering on that with the backdrop of war in Iran and
[36:46.560 --> 36:51.240]  the and Jerusalem Post report in the US is preparing to strike Biden saying he advocates
[36:51.240 --> 36:57.240]  physical revolution there is just so much to cover we'll go a little bit in the next
[36:57.240 --> 37:02.080]  hour but just you give people big picture of why this is so important this isn't about
[37:02.080 --> 37:08.760]  Alex Jones I think this signifies a huge escalation of lying and recklessness so far that even
[37:08.760 --> 37:17.040]  ABC News and others had headlines saying Alex Jones loses Sandy Hook ABC News then they changed
[37:17.040 --> 37:22.400]  it my picture's on there I'm not even in this lawsuit but they still say parents have big
[37:22.400 --> 37:28.680]  win with me in there so so so and Trump is attacking Russia the New York Times says trying
[37:28.680 --> 37:33.120]  to start a war none of it's true he called it treason I think they're going into a hysteria
[37:33.120 --> 37:38.440]  point right now what do you think's happening Robert Barnes well clearly you were the victim
[37:38.440 --> 37:44.360]  of the sabotage campaign that was intended to to create a false story of the kind that
[37:44.360 --> 37:49.840]  went viral so a lot of people are targeted that are prominent people prominent individuals
[37:49.840 --> 37:55.160]  for political reasons by people who send them various illicit materials and the goals to
[37:55.160 --> 38:01.080]  entrap them into some sort of criminal condom here what happened is the you had probably
[38:01.080 --> 38:06.000]  left his trolls disguising their email communications as Sandy Hook related communications over the
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.240]  years sending stuff in and because you had the wise policy is the policy everybody should
[38:11.240 --> 38:17.120]  have the policy that like John Podesta managed not to have of do not open emails that you
[38:17.120 --> 38:20.840]  do not know the person who's sending it to you and definitely do not open attachments
[38:20.840 --> 38:26.280]  of any email and so at info wars that no none of those emails were ever open so you go through
[38:26.280 --> 38:30.440]  a court process where the court requires discovery to be turned over including a bunch of emails
[38:30.440 --> 38:36.120]  that you never read never saw never opened never looked at and they in the process of
[38:36.120 --> 38:41.960]  the lawyers reviewing it they discovered that people had been trying to sabotage you by sending
[38:41.960 --> 38:47.200]  you illicit materials the FBI reviews all of it and sees that you were completely the
[38:47.200 --> 38:53.920]  victim they research in all of those aspects so the attempt to set you up failed but so
[38:53.920 --> 39:00.320]  what they do next is the media goes out in lies about what took place so that the deal
[39:00.320 --> 39:07.200]  of the a wide range of press coverage yesterday including NBC News ABC News the Washington
[39:07.200 --> 39:12.080]  Post in part but particularly egregious the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.880]  put out false headlines fake news headlines that said that they knew were false that the
[39:17.880 --> 39:23.440]  core of their story revealed was fault that the actual substantive content of the story
[39:23.440 --> 39:28.400]  acknowledges that you were the victim acknowledges that you didn't send anything to anybody that
[39:28.400 --> 39:32.720]  was illicit in any way shape or form and that their headline was false was particularly
[39:32.720 --> 39:37.880]  noteworthy about the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal's defamation and lies
[39:37.880 --> 39:43.600]  and libel is that the substantive content of the story is only available to paying subscribers
[39:43.600 --> 39:48.480]  so 95% of the people who saw that headline could not even read the substantive content
[39:48.480 --> 39:53.600]  of the story to note the headline was completely and utterly false that's why I put them on
[39:53.600 --> 39:58.400]  notice in a wide range of other people on notice yesterday that this was lies that this was
[39:58.400 --> 40:03.600]  liable that if they didn't correct or retract they could face suit the Guardian went the
[40:03.600 --> 40:10.520]  big UK publication went one step further and said that you said illicit materials and to
[40:10.520 --> 40:15.320]  the families of Sandy Hook so it's completely utterly totally false at a whole new level
[40:15.320 --> 40:20.200]  of fault so they all knew it was false they all knew it was fake news you know you had
[40:20.200 --> 40:25.000]  even people on the left acknowledging very quickly that this was inaccurate false stories
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.720]  that were being reported and yet here you have these I mean there it says Alex Jones
[40:30.720 --> 40:36.280]  sent victims totally false totally false there's not an iota of credibility to it and the laws
[40:36.280 --> 40:42.520]  in the UK are even broader and stronger in terms of libel law so unless there's immediate
[40:42.520 --> 40:48.200]  effective corrections taken by these big institutional papers the Guardian is going to get sued the
[40:48.200 --> 40:53.640]  Wall Street Journal is going to get sued the New York Times is going to get sued the these
[40:53.640 --> 40:59.360]  publications need to make that they're so aggressive and by the way by the way I don't
[40:59.360 --> 41:03.720]  have a lot of money okay we were not able to expand right now but I know we've got some
[41:03.720 --> 41:08.000]  big donors and things coming on the line will be announcing that in July also there's going
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.800]  to be some other things going on so we're already planning an offensive we have to on
[41:11.800 --> 41:16.720]  this I mean then this is this is cut and dry did you reach out to the young Turks because
[41:16.720 --> 41:20.920]  this morning at like six a.m. I watched a horrifying ten minute piece of just vicious
[41:20.920 --> 41:25.280]  that I'm a pedophile I need to be taken off air I'll soon be arrested I knowingly sent
[41:25.280 --> 41:29.840]  them child porn they it was just incredible not mentioning emails anything or that I was
[41:29.840 --> 41:33.480]  the victim and then now they've removed the video everywhere but they need to retract
[41:33.480 --> 41:38.640]  and say that this was not true yes that's correct the so the young Turks has issued
[41:38.640 --> 41:42.920]  some corrections even a list of Milano yesterday quickly issued a correct so the I mean you
[41:42.920 --> 41:47.600]  had people who in the Covington case didn't issue corrections who did so here realizing
[41:47.600 --> 41:52.200]  how egregious the lie was but you had some big institutional press refused to do so on
[41:52.200 --> 41:57.840]  a quick basis and so the yeah you're right the the only way in which to make this litigation
[41:57.840 --> 42:02.200]  work is the is that there's going to be an independent organization that is going to
[42:02.200 --> 42:06.920]  be started that's going to be founded that will be announced late next week that is going
[42:06.920 --> 42:12.480]  to be designed to crowdfund and publicly fund this kind of litigation so we can equal
[42:12.480 --> 42:18.200]  the playing field we can even it out in such a way that the the the powerful institutions
[42:18.200 --> 42:25.400]  cannot continue to de-platform de-fame libel engage in lawfare selectively and discriminately
[42:25.400 --> 42:30.880]  it will in favor of a political class that only wants its own opinions to ever be heard
[42:30.880 --> 42:33.840]  all right Bob stay right there I want to come back and ask you why you think they're so
[42:33.840 --> 42:39.080]  bold to run with things like this and what you think it signifies next and the fact
[42:39.080 --> 42:43.400]  that the lawyers on the other side are up there reportedly trying to get me indicted
[42:43.400 --> 42:48.960]  on multiple charges of transmitting child porn and threatening them which I never did
[42:48.960 --> 42:52.760]  what does that signify Robert Barnes straight ahead I'm Alex Jones all the other big global
[42:52.760 --> 43:02.080]  news coming up and your phone calls please stay with us what you have witnessed is the
[43:02.080 --> 43:09.680]  biggest development in free speech in the western world history this is a digital AI

[43:35.240 --> 43:41.520]  pro human pro sovereign pro family populist organization so they thought first they come
[43:41.520 --> 43:47.560]  for Alex Jones then when people say okay take him off the air everyone else like dominoes
[43:47.560 --> 43:52.520]  would fall the way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a
[43:52.520 --> 43:57.200]  standard of freedom and free speech understand that they believe they can take us down they'll

[47:37.040 --> 47:41.080]  calling for a violent revolution aoc as I even got to the new city council woman in
[47:41.080 --> 47:45.120]  denver saying any means necessary we're gonna play that later it's been a week I'm gonna
[47:45.120 --> 47:51.360]  get to it we have called islamic call to prayers in major cities from dallas to brooklyn new
[47:51.360 --> 47:57.120]  york blasting out at decibels that nobody else is allowed to we have massive crime waves
[47:57.120 --> 48:02.960]  all over the place by legal aliens abola is admittedly escaping africa now that's in the
[48:02.960 --> 48:07.640]  news there's just so much happening and then meanwhile the wall street journal the new
[48:07.640 --> 48:14.040]  york times others are putting out headlines behind paywalls where it just says alex jones
[48:14.040 --> 48:17.920]  sent child porn to sandy hook families but you can't read it and then little bitty at
[48:17.920 --> 48:21.680]  the bottom of every one of these articles that I saw in the senate when express news
[48:21.680 --> 48:28.360]  the austrian statesman it says the fbi says that emails were sent to jones and that he
[48:28.360 --> 48:32.760]  had never opened them that he's the victim but they do it at the bottom knowing full
[48:32.760 --> 48:40.360]  well in conscious organized fraud that almost no one reads the whole article that people
[48:40.360 --> 48:46.880]  most people over half just look at headlines now around 75% only read a paragraph or two
[48:46.880 --> 48:52.120]  and maybe 25% depending on the paper of the demographic actually read the whole article
[48:52.120 --> 48:56.920]  so you've been even read the article you've been reading reading reading reading and
[48:56.920 --> 49:02.280]  then you after all these pages of demonization oh by the way he didn't do it but by then
[49:02.280 --> 49:07.680]  it's already out and the vitriol by the leftist we're gonna arrest you you're going to jail
[49:07.680 --> 49:12.560]  you're gonna get swat teamed I mean they because when they say russia gates real or when they
[49:12.560 --> 49:16.440]  say you're really a nazi or they say you're a child pornographer must be true but see
[49:16.440 --> 49:23.440]  in court the un and hillary and and and all these organizations have been caught in massive
[49:23.440 --> 49:30.720]  child trafficking hillary's first job as a lawyer she chose was to represent brutal child
[49:30.720 --> 49:35.560]  rapist or seven men raped an 11 year old girl they grabbed off her bicycle in broad
[49:35.560 --> 49:39.880]  daylight kidnapped her for a day and raped her so bad I've covered the court case of
[49:39.880 --> 49:47.400]  the victim here caved her face in you name it that they smashed her cervix and she had
[49:47.400 --> 49:52.200]  a prolapse was just getting the medical stuff they could never have sex or children again
[49:52.200 --> 50:01.360]  seven men drinking whiskey rich guys raped her until her insides came out that's a roadside
[50:01.360 --> 50:07.320]  hysterectomy now that's hillary made jokes we play the audio about how funny it was and
[50:07.320 --> 50:13.960]  how much fun it was so remember that and remember that somebody's got to stand up to these people
[50:13.960 --> 50:18.160]  and I've got a whole document cam shop at TV viewers look at hillary hanging out with
[50:18.160 --> 50:24.440]  all the people from the nexum cult and I told you with satanism I told you with child trafficking
[50:24.440 --> 50:30.000]  it's all come out in court you see going back to Bob Barnes with us 30 minutes the next
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.360]  hour then we're gonna open the phones up constitutional lawyer you just started getting
[50:33.360 --> 50:37.480]  into a list of the more more egregious and I've got a big stack up to go over here we
[50:37.480 --> 50:41.920]  to put them on notice obviously but what do you make by the brazenness obviously a decision
[50:41.920 --> 50:47.840]  has been made on top to just all attack at once a trump everybody and just tell bigger
[50:47.840 --> 50:52.160]  lies and just billionaires are behind it so they don't care if they lose cases or they're
[50:52.160 --> 50:56.760]  planning a violent overthrow so it won't matter I mean this is this is me a very dangerous
[50:56.760 --> 51:01.400]  climate and escalation we've seen not just with us but on every front the lies are just
[51:01.400 --> 51:05.240]  getting bigger and bigger trying to start wars with Russia saying we attacked Russia's
[51:05.240 --> 51:12.480]  power grid and then Trump says it's not true I mean this this is is this a civil war well
[51:12.480 --> 51:17.040]  I mean it's it's I see it as a dying decaying institutions that are losing their gatekeeper
[51:17.040 --> 51:22.560]  power across the country and across the world people like the New York Times and the Washington
[51:22.560 --> 51:27.200]  Post and the Wall Street Journal and these big publications and these big media institutions
[51:27.200 --> 51:33.440]  and the big network media and CNN are accustomed to determine being the gatekeeper to decide
[51:33.440 --> 51:37.960]  what news and what views people are allowed to hear and have and what's happened over
[51:37.960 --> 51:43.800]  the past half decade or so is that that power has disappeared and organizations like info
[51:43.800 --> 51:49.160]  wars independent press independent journalists of a wide range of ideological inclination
[51:49.160 --> 51:53.920]  across the ideological spectrum have replaced them and they have become more trustworthy
[51:53.920 --> 51:58.160]  more reliable more credible in the eyes of the public opinion and the eyes of the public
[51:58.160 --> 52:02.360]  in general because of their proven track record than the institutional press which has such
[52:02.360 --> 52:06.640]  a long history of a litany of lies that they got away with in the past simply because they
[52:06.640 --> 52:11.800]  had monopolized or in the equivalent thereof economic power and so there's no need to
[52:11.800 --> 52:16.800]  de-platform people unless you see those people as a threat there's no need to defame people
[52:16.800 --> 52:20.720]  unless I totally concur with what you're saying so it's it's a panic that all the lies and
[52:20.720 --> 52:24.680]  corruption didn't work the intimidation didn't work the bullying didn't work so now they're
[52:24.680 --> 52:29.280]  just going to go total thermonuclear and destroy not just their own credibility which they
[52:29.280 --> 52:34.560]  don't have they now know they don't have credibility they're more on kamikaze emissions
[52:34.560 --> 52:39.640]  exactly it's the way most dying empires react to any form of successful resistance right
[52:39.640 --> 52:44.880]  at the peak of the resistance is when you see the empires you unleash everything to
[52:44.880 --> 52:49.280]  try to quash that challenger of that contest and that's what's happening here I mean here
[52:49.280 --> 52:53.360]  I mean for particularly the New York Times of the Wall Street Journal here the they knew
[52:53.360 --> 52:58.560]  that most people could not even read the article if they wanted to so aside from the fact that
[52:58.560 --> 53:02.760]  you're not allowed to libel in your headline and then hide the truth in an article that's
[53:02.760 --> 53:08.000]  been established law for a long time here they knew that 90% of the people would not
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.320]  be able to read the article because they're not paid subscribers to the New York Times
[53:12.320 --> 53:18.440]  of the Wall Street Journal so it was clickbait that was intentionally and deliberately false
[53:18.440 --> 53:22.360]  there's been recent studies and surveys that have shown that over the last three years
[53:22.360 --> 53:26.840]  the New York Times Wall Street Journal and others have exploded in the kind of coverage
[53:26.840 --> 53:32.360]  they focused on leftist ideological ideas in terms and that the they're creating a clickbait
[53:32.360 --> 53:37.000]  culture in order to try to compete in the social media world and they're radicalizing
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.080]  the left and instead they're talking about how the rights being radicalized when they
[53:41.080 --> 53:46.200]  have been busy radicalizing the left and so they the attempts to defame and smear you
[53:46.200 --> 53:51.240]  are simply the youth that the template they want to use to defame and smear all dissident
[53:51.240 --> 53:56.280]  voices so the dissident voices won't be listened to by the public by the audience that's right
[53:56.280 --> 54:01.800]  it's a total threat as well let me ask you this because I've talked to norm paterson
[54:01.800 --> 54:05.080]  others and they say that they're up there trying to get me indicted in Connecticut you
[54:05.080 --> 54:08.320]  looked at what I said and what I did I've talked to other defense lawyers today they
[54:08.320 --> 54:13.240]  said that's just asinine and they even try to politically blow up in their face both
[54:13.240 --> 54:18.360]  for saying I sent child porn which I didn't and secondarily it was reviewed by law firms
[54:18.360 --> 54:22.920]  and sent it was hidden the FBI said that there's no way we could find it was found in metadata
[54:22.920 --> 54:27.320]  that the other side got and ran through some complex computer scanner to find the hidden
[54:27.320 --> 54:32.040]  stuff so we're sent hidden messages and they're in the civil area saying I should be sanctioned
[54:32.040 --> 54:36.440]  because we didn't reasonably screen these emails you know when they wanted millions of them
[54:36.440 --> 54:41.080]  and they ended up getting fifty seven thousand it's it's it's just insane and I want listeners
[54:41.080 --> 54:46.360]  to understand how impossible it is to comply with this type of garbage but what are you
[54:46.360 --> 54:51.560]  got level expecting out of them so I mean I assume the court will be reasonable the
[54:51.560 --> 54:55.640]  court has been throughout the whole protocol and procedures so far the plaintiff's position
[54:55.640 --> 55:00.920]  is the plaintiff's counsel their position is in my view without a legal basis they were
[55:00.920 --> 55:07.800]  the ones that demanded expedited rush massive amounts of disco so when I and other people
[55:07.800 --> 55:13.560]  put up an argument that hey we need time to review this information that 99.9% of it doesn't have
[55:13.560 --> 55:19.080]  any real relevance or pertinence if we would be allowed time to screen out they went eight they
[55:19.080 --> 55:24.120]  went nuts that they started screaming to the courts that hey this is delay this is inappropriate
[55:24.120 --> 55:29.640]  so it was at their demand at their insistence that metadata get turned over they wanted every
[55:29.640 --> 55:35.800]  email you'd ever been it had ever been sent to you so trying to shift the blame to to to you
[55:35.800 --> 55:40.520]  or anyone else is just ludicrous given the scope of what of their own behavior they were the ones
[55:40.520 --> 55:45.800]  that have demanded more invasive discovery that has ever been required of any media defendant
[55:45.800 --> 55:51.000]  in any comparable case in american legal history they demanded that and then after they did that
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.760]  they got it after they received it they were the ones who located information that the fact that
[55:56.760 --> 56:03.080]  you are the victim of a scam by people and this is going to be the next wave of leftist troll
[56:03.080 --> 56:08.040]  behavior the uh if you look at them they were encouraging leftist trolls uh the various aspects
[56:08.040 --> 56:12.280]  in the media and various political adversaries of yours were advocating that they go on your
[56:12.280 --> 56:16.440]  instagram account when you were still allowed to have one uh and try to put comments in there to
[56:16.440 --> 56:21.400]  try to trigger uh a uh facebook or instagram to tell you they even said here's the blueprint he's
[56:21.400 --> 56:26.200]  only got four percent nazi comments at 30 he'll be banned they said let's get let's get busy
[56:26.200 --> 56:29.320]  that was in business insider we're gonna go to break come back with you and get into big picture
[56:29.320 --> 56:32.760]  here and where you think the next level of this goes and how you think they're going to go after

[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:25.960]  so
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.560]  constitutional lawyer my lawyer robert barnes is on the line with us right now
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:37.240]  this is an attempt to take out the first amendment and to overshadow all of the child
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:42.360]  trafficking murder satanism that hillary's connected to that's coming out in the news today
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:46.200]  we'll cover that at the bottom of the hour after barnes leaves us will open the phones up as well
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.040]  the barns i wanted in this segment the next are going through the forensics of this and
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.680]  you were concurring with with with our separate analyses doc of a camp shot police for tv viewers
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:01.080]  the connecticut post a second tier organization is the progenitor and where the lawyers from
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:07.160]  democratic party this former federal prosecutor went to to first plant the fake headline so that it
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:13.400]  would then give i guess fence the fraud uh and allow the other publications to just go off that
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.960]  lawyers for san jose family say alex jones sent them child porn then they go through it all despite
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:23.080]  the fact two days before it was in dozens of publications including the hartford current
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.560]  alex jones offers one million reward as fbi investigates child pornography
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.200]  planted on the info war server goes on to say we were found to be the victims and that this was
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:37.560]  unintentional and it goes on from there so we had this in all these different publications even buzz
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:46.200]  feed uh or the daily beast got it right and biz pack review i mean dozens but then two days later
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:51.960]  they hit us with the total fraud that i'm sending out child porn this is incredibly
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:56.440]  premeditated how would they do this when when what really happened was known and then not even
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:01.960]  mention or say there's two stories they just go with the fraud and what's notable about this is
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:08.200]  the lawyers in their uh court paperwork never said what all these headlines claim so the uh
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:12.440]  that there was no support from that from the actual lawyer statement so unless the lawyers
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:17.400]  said something outside of court different than their court proceedings uh in which case the
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.800]  lawyers did that and the lawyers made factually false statements but it appears that the media
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:27.000]  just conjured us up on its own and originated with the kinetic post the kinetic post is a second
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.280]  here publication it's not considered a serious publication in Connecticut many that does draw
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:37.560]  way back to when i went to school in Connecticut and so the idea that uh anyone would pay attention
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:42.520]  to kinetic post when the Hartford current had already reported days before what the actual
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:49.240]  situation left is what put all these big newspapers and big media uh and big influential social media
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:53.800]  celebrities on notice that they had easy note definitely the big institutional press there
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:59.160]  is simply no excuse whatsoever for the New York Times to run that headline when they know that
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:04.120]  the Hartford current the only respected publication uh and it's still a liberal publication but
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.240]  much more respected publication had already had already debunked this days before so for
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:14.680]  them to to run it they use it as a pretext an excuse they needed some local publication to
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:19.400]  print some headline that they could then piggyback off of so they could repeat the lie and have the
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:23.640]  lie spread around the world before the truth could get its pants on and that's precisely what the
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.360]  institutional press did in fact i was going to start the broadcast today to say that a lie goes
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.120]  halfway around the world for the truth to put its pants on mark twain because that's exactly
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:36.280]  what's happening and i'm not putting a good face on this but when we come back but i'm seeing massive
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:42.920]  backlash even from mainline liberals uh understanding that this is a very dangerous fraud to set
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.240]  somebody up because anybody could be emailed child porn you don't open it and then and then
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.200]  and then the democrats want to put you in jail that i mean all there's not a major person or
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.440]  celebrity or media person that hasn't received illicit materials that somebody tried to set
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:00.600]  them up with and it's been they become an increasing phenomenon particularly with the
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:05.320]  social media leftist trolls who try to do this repeatedly for example in the case of uh mike
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:11.960]  sernovich they actually went and created doctored video fake video saying he beat his baby exactly
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:16.840]  so that that's their one of the easiest ways to try to set people up and by the way the democrats
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:22.200]  hail that guy and promote him and then they praise him for making fake videos about myself
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:28.200]  sernovich everybody these are vicious evil videos that the news even picks up exactly it's something
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:32.360]  anybody can be vulnerable to at any given point the other point i think broadly is this that
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:37.800]  everybody's now having to ask the question given that this was a complete fabrication by the most
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:44.040]  powerful institutional press in our country and in the world about you and sandy hope what other
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:49.480]  lies have been told about you or you and sandy hope for you in general over the past five

[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:46.840]  ladies and gentlemen i have had hundreds of phone calls from family and others
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:52.680]  this yesterday afternoon saying how are you taking it we know you're a good man we know it's not true
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.520]  i've had a lot of famous media people call me and say we got your back we know it's a lie
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.840]  and we've even seen people like elissa malano come out and say what's happening to me is not
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:04.920]  true but a bunch of other big liberals are saying hey the daily beast reported in the
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:11.000]  heart for current reported last week uh that alex jones was sent secret child porn under the name
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:18.520]  sandy hook and it was hidden and embedded and when they sued him and did discovery and demanded
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.920]  all these emails they went and found it and took it to the fbi and the fbi said that we were the
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:28.600]  victim well that just wasn't done of fit with the medium because that broke on a friday they didn't
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:37.400]  control it and so the talking point went out especially because the nxivm next to him trial
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:44.600]  is going on right now and what's it say crime boss closing arguments in the trial satanism
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:53.880]  mexico child trafficking helary schumer and gillibrand ties and then the larita express and
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:02.920]  winstein and all the rest of it and epstein and weiner and you know the list just go bill clinton
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:09.000]  the list goes on and on this is how you get in the club you know in traditional mafias you had to
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.240]  kill people get make your bones but that's not enough to bind you so more corrupt gangs say
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:19.080]  you got to knock over a liquor store owner and shoot them for no reason then really nasty gangs
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:26.280]  say you got to kill a kid or kill a grandma muslim gangs say you got to dump acid on a little girl's
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:33.480]  face well with these clubs you got to at least have sex with kids and then pass that you got to
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:40.200]  strangle them and murder them now they don't like the fact i talk about that so you see what's going
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:45.320]  on everybody's putting two and two together and i say everybody everybody but big national corporate
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:49.960]  media and people are blown away they're shocked by this everybody knows we're advocates for children
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:56.200]  we're advocates for the unborn we're not the type like jerry sandusky who ran a children's care system
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:00.840]  and for celebrities to come visit with disadvantaged kids who'd already been raped
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:06.200]  that was a leasing out children for sex it's well known and blackmail part of the sick cult
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.360]  will cover this after barns leaves us bottom of the hour the phones are open robert barns
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:14.600]  recapping getting into other angles of this again i don't want to talk about myself all day
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:20.360]  listeners need to understand this and you agree this signifies with all the other news we're seeing
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:26.200]  next level lying of a dying corporate media who wants to take us with them and i just want
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:31.480]  listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this and we're seeing
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:37.560]  a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50 off but we make only like five ten dollars on
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:42.200]  higher marked up and stuff we're making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:47.720]  moving a ton of it okay but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:51.800]  twenty thousand dollars that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:57.080]  so we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars a product i want to expand
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:03.160]  not contract and for six months we've not just been a standstill the enemy's been winning and
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:12.760]  i've labored on this i have labored and labored and labored and labored on this
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.880]  because i'm always totally truthful with you but that doesn't mean i don't hold some things back
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:24.520]  sometimes just because it's it's it's something that's nuanced of i like to be expanding i like
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.760]  to be winning i like to be fighting and we are winning the info war that's why we're so hated
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:34.920]  but we need to be retreaded we need to be uh tuned up we need to be fixed up you know use a cheesy
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:39.560]  thing like the enterprise goes out and gets shot up in one movie and the next movie starts
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.240]  since they're in dry dock it's been repaired we never have time to get into dry dock we got a lot
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:50.360]  of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us then they're really going to plant child porn
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.760]  on us then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else i mean biden's calling for violence
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:58.680]  we'll play that clip two at the bottom of the arm the democrats now are going into a full
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:05.160]  revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the chicom so go to infowarstore.com now something
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:13.320]  i want to announce here most of these subscribe deals like uh oh there's a whole bunch of them out
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:19.960]  there where you can go and support people or support projects and you can go fun concepts or ideas
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:24.680]  we've tried to do all those and we've been banned from as you know we've been black balled and banned
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:31.640]  almost everywhere because we're telling the truth subscribestar.com takes less than five percent
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:37.080]  and they've been paying paul watson and others who are not able to pay as much anymore that's the
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:42.040]  real process here and so but paul has been doing so well on his that finally he's going to be able
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:47.240]  to get a few other writers some camera people and build a modest studio but it still takes a lot of
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:53.560]  money to do that modest studios hundreds of thousands of dollars so and see i'm trying to
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:59.960]  replicate as fast as possible because i want to beat these people it's not about me but literally
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.680]  if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:11.720]  your word of mouth you're unstoppable we're unstoppable together i called a lot of people
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.840]  this morning and last night i said please do videos talking about how i've been framed that's
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:21.560]  the wavelength we need to overpower the sensors and the big corporate media this is a fight about
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:26.520]  whether or not they can go from saying there's wmds and iraq to saying i'm sending child porn out
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:31.640]  when they know it's not true and the fbi says it's not true that's the evil of these individuals
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:38.280]  but you can overpower them so subscribe star dot com forward slash alex jones document cam shot
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:46.120]  there you go subscribe star dot com forward slash alex jones please go there even if it's five dollars
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:50.920]  a month that'll be added because listen if i sell a hundred thousand dollars with a product but it's
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:56.840]  on sale and we only make 15 thousand dollars or 20 thousand dollars that doesn't fund something like
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:02.360]  this operation but if something on subscribe star where i get 95 percent of it that's real
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:07.640]  money that i know that when you subscribe you can cancel any time that i can budget to hire people
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:13.080]  and do things and pay for gas for an rv for more reporters to drive around the country and
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:18.440]  and you know cheap hotel rooms and hire more people this is the fight we're in info war store
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.800]  dot com huge sales right now that's a great way to donate but subscribe star dot com forward slash
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:28.680]  alex jones and i'm encouraging all my reporters to start their own subscribe stars you know that
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:33.080]  way they can augment that way they can start their own website that way no matter what we
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:39.000]  replicate the enemy loses so yes we're in that type of countdown mode here where we hope to move on to
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.760]  the future but it's that serious it's that hardcore but i've seen massive support before i even asked
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.000]  for it yesterday people know what to do i want to send a strong message to the enemy i want to raise
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.880]  a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:59.000]  will stand with us and i will never back down you have my commitment this only gives me more energy
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this and we will stand
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.600]  against them we're going to break with one more segment with mr barnes but start getting into what
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.240]  you're going to cover next segment about it a lot of the left is now admitting this has gone too far
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:16.520]  trying to plant lies that trump attacks russia to start a war a lot of the left is starting to wake up
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:22.520]  and going wait a minute we're almost under a spell no doubt i think everybody read this thinking oh
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:27.480]  wow they we finally even got alex jones we're going to be the end of alex jones there as you saw
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:31.560]  that as you mentioned the people at the young turks and other people were talking about prison
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:36.040]  going to be locked up there were blue checkmark people on twitter talking about the animals were
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:41.560]  going to be eating out of your corpse that kind of mentality and language and lingo was being used
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.960]  and then they read the substance of the article those that had access to it not most people didn't
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:51.000]  but those that did realize oh my goodness the entire thing is fake it's entirely fake news
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.480]  the headline is fake news it's totally false this is someone who is the victim that they're trying
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:15:01.240]  to portray as a perpetrator it was completely insane and absurd the level at which they went
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:05.240]  and when people realize that it then raised questions because what you had been pointing
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:08.920]  out what info wars have been pointing out what various members of the dissident press have been
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:13.720]  pointing out is this is exactly what they've been doing for years and decade they've been doing it
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.400]  not only for you they've been doing it about anybody in the independent space who raises
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.840]  questions about whether it's bogus wars or bogus politics or other illicit activity being covered
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.800]  up by those and in places of institutional power willing to challenge and question establishment
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:33.080]  narratives that often do more harm than good those those attributes that now people have to
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.720]  rethink everything they've previously thought so you have people on the left thinking wow if I could
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.920]  completely buy into a totally false headline shared by all these institutional members of the press
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:47.240]  shared by some of the biggest most well-respected members of the institutional press and I was
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:52.200]  completely taken for a ride by it what else might I have been wrong about what else about

[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:43.800]  a lot of winning big cases robert barnes and then i'm gonna get into all the big giant bust
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:48.280]  around the country of huge pedophile rings that no one's been giving any coverage that are tied
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:52.280]  to hillary clinton mainstream news though but it's not getting any coverage and said you're
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:56.920]  hearing about how i sent child porn all over the news one of the top stories in the country is
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:04.200]  that i sent child porn to the sandy hook families all of that is a lie from every damn angle recapping
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:09.560]  that robert barnes and other key points that you have in your repertoire on your radar screen
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.800]  so i mean no doubt what happened here was the an attempt by leftist trolls
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:23.400]  to sabotage info wars by sending obscene images that info wars was not even aware of
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:29.720]  that was ultimately uncovered and discovered the fbi reviewed it recognized info wars as the victim
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:34.840]  of what took place and then the and media reports initially accurately reported this
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:40.040]  in the heart for current and elsewhere and then institutional media went about with a massive
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:46.360]  scale lie and libel campaign falsely accusing you of sending child porn to people which is a
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:50.440]  very ridiculous all the way across the board which they knew to be factually false which they
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:55.880]  knew to be a complete lie and libel and the truth they hid and buried in stories often behind pay
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:01.400]  walls that 95 of the people could not access or look at so that's the core story is an attempt
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:06.040]  to frame you first that failed because the fbi discovered that this was in fact an attempt to
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:10.280]  frame you this was all false you had never seen this you'd never reviewed this you'd never looked
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:15.480]  at this you would never possess this you had never sent this you had never shared this the the fbi
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:19.960]  itself went through an extensive review to determine that determine that alex jones and info
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:26.280]  wars were innocent were the victim of a crime by likely leftist people who are sending hidden
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:32.840]  child porn to info wars in the hope that it would be uh falsely blamed on info wars and the and then
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:37.960]  you have the leftist media and the institutional media deliberately spreading lies and libel that
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:43.000]  they know are lies and libel with their false headlines and fake tweets around the world to
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:48.760]  try to defame and destroy alex jones and info and their goal was really ultimately to go at the
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:55.320]  audience that's what all of this has been about normally you think about most people the audience
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:59.560]  itself can think about this if they were accused of this in a headline tomorrow what would their
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:04.760]  future be will their economic future be will their personal future be it would usually be wiped out
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:09.160]  because by the time the truth came out everybody would have already destroyed and wrecked a reputation
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:13.720]  and so they assume the same effect that happened here that's why you have the new york times lying
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:17.400]  and libeling that's why you have the wall street journal lying and libeling that's why you have
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:22.840]  nbc news lying and libeling is because their goal is to scare and intimidate the audience
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:27.560]  from having any association with you and people who don't know you and half the country has never
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:33.080]  heard the name alex jove they or doesn't really know who you are to be introduced to you to be
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:38.600]  through these false libelist that's right they're inoculating them against me with lies and fraud
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.080]  what about the next angle info wars host alex jones accused of threatening sandy hook lawyers
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:48.840]  at her child porn is found in his electronic files against cnbc they go around the world
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:55.560]  to never say it was email sent to us it's found in his files no it's not my files when somebody
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:24:01.240]  sends it to me and then they subpoena it and then i mean this is a magic trick and there's hundreds
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:07.160]  and hundreds of these articles all with the same quarterbacking media consultant you imagine if these
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.000]  suits keep going when we find out who the media consulting companies are with these lawyers
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.120]  and who's setting all this up because it's all scripted when you look at how the media handled
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:21.640]  this it has the attributes of a scripted storyline that the media wanted to tell and the media knew
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:25.800]  that they were lying they knew that they were libeling from the get go so the and they know
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:30.520]  that these other stories that they're trying to say are false so the the the lawyers complaints
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:34.840]  about your free speech and this is a continuous pattern of some of the lawyers involved in these
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:41.160]  matters so simply do not believe in free speech rights uh and and want to use the lawsuit to
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:46.120]  suppress your speech they want to be they're using the lawsuit the media is using the lawsuits in
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:51.080]  order to lie and libel you and and now the some of the lawyers are trying to use the lawsuit in
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:57.880]  order to try to silence your speech by misinterpreting and and misrepresenting what really took place
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:02.840]  so the they know that from that from watching the entire video broadcast anybody who watched it
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:07.560]  saw that you were very upset at the people who tried to frame and sabotage you by sending by
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.240]  sending these illicit images to you and being part of something they would have those illicit
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:16.120]  images in the first place and again let's pull back here for a moment and this is just one example
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:21.880]  saying that trump hates all mexicans it's not true saying that trump loves white supremacists
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:27.320]  not true uh he was saying there's a press on both sides that were fine people nobody deserved to be
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:35.880]  you know be hurt like this all of this craziness that is unfolding and saying that trump attacked
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.200]  russia in the last two months and brought down their power grid or sabotaged it that's an act of
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:44.600]  war and then trump says it didn't happen and they're using fake leaks at the new york times to do it
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:50.520]  i mean this is beyond low-key level sabotage now this is like a trillion gremlins got dumped into
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:56.840]  the newsrooms of america and they're just so crazy who's giving them the orders just to engage in such
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:02.920]  criminal levels of fraud well i think the level of behavior that shows the degree of their recklessness
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:08.920]  when the media lies the the consequence of people's lives get lost that's the reality of that's the
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:15.000]  long history of because the the media lies about war about Stalin about Castro you look at just the
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.480]  new york time and the degrees of lies and libel they've spread over 80 years of extraordinary
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:24.200]  and now the cuttings of kids and the smoliting and and the gulf of tonkin not happening and
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:28.840]  my own listeners even though i said that iranians may have attacked us no one believes that i mean
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:34.040]  even mainstream news doesn't believe so so it's a crisis of credibility they don't have any credibility
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:38.440]  they keep trying to destroy myself and others that do have credibility with the with the people
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.480]  it's just not working so what do they do next it's it's gonna be constant level of lies and
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:48.520]  libel it's what they did to the president 2016 is what's happening to you at on a different scale
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:52.680]  now in the sense that they had all these people come out of the woodwork make a bunch of accusations
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:58.360]  against them that had no uh no or limited factual merit to them and led to his sort of whole reputation
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:02.200]  being cart and feathered before he could restore it they've done this repeatedly and they're gonna
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:07.000]  keep doing it and and unfortunately they tend to do it in areas where it has the greatest consequence
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.440]  areas that can provoke war world war different war i mean trying to create a conflict with russia
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:17.560]  as they have been trying to do now for three years is extraordinarily dangerous and risky
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:23.720]  the way in which iran is being handled uh has all kinds of risk attended to it if people don't
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:30.920]  believe that whatever we actually not to mention offensive war is evil oh precisely exactly so i
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:35.560]  mean that these are people that have a long notorious history of promoting violence in
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:40.920]  various parts of the world by lies and libels about what's taking place particularly about foreign
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:45.000]  countries and foreign places that most americans don't have their own and now they're running out of
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:51.400]  bullets so so how far will this go on because i see their mega lies getting even crazier is is
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:56.840]  actually hurting them even faster it is but they're the kind of people that are gonna self
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:02.280]  destruct fast because of the way in which they operate the main mistake they've made is underestimating
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:07.000]  the american public the american public can see through this the american public can recognize
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.040]  that they've been deceived so frequently that they're not willing or ready to buy any lies that
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:16.040]  could lead us to war again exactly robert you're doing an incredible job and i think that alarm

[01:32:53.360 --> 01:33:01.000]  You know, there's, what things go websites, you just go there.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:11.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:17.600]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.200]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:26.680]  Well, so does he, live from the M4Wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:30.760]  Well, we're in the thick of it now, ladies and gentlemen, we're restoring the Republic,
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:34.880]  a lot of good things are happening, record numbers of pedophiles and globalists are
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:40.200]  being arrested, but they are trying to fire back some of our own medicine to us, of course
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.640]  it's all a fraud, it's not going to work.
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:45.680]  Thanks to your prayers and providence and support, thank you.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:50.440]  Okay, I just spent an hour and a half mainly talking about how they're trying to crucify
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:58.720]  me upside down, and the fact that I am not glad my grandparents are dead, but it's good
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:02.400]  that they're not here to see this, because people don't trust the mainstream media and
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:06.720]  they didn't trust the mainstream media, but it would still be very painful to them to
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:11.520]  see headlines like have been put out that are total frauds.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:15.800]  But this is at a level that the mainstream media used to engage in to invade a country.
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:20.080]  So it shows how their power has been weakened that they're trying to turn a nationalist
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:22.360]  folk icon, that's how they see me.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:27.160]  They call me the prophet of the Tea Party, the guy out in the wilderness that foreshadowed
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:32.760]  all this, and they know that I'm just another wave of patriot that came along right as things
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:37.240]  were building towards this, and I had your support.
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:44.600]  You had my support, but they are working around the clock to take us off the air.
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:49.520]  And if you look at all the videos out there, every day it's a Democrat, a prominent member
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:58.000]  of Congress, a new city council person that's elected Denver, or even Joe Biden saying it's
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.760]  time for physical revolution.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:05.560]  That means any means necessary, that means communist revolution run by offshore banks.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.240]  Well, yeah, they funded the communist in China, and China is the model.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:14.840]  So it's ultra rich people offshore that don't pay taxes that want to overthrow just a middle
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:17.560]  class and working people having something.
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.440]  They want a post-industrial world.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:24.800]  They want to dictate everything to you, and they're rolling out their whole world government
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:25.800]  right now.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:31.160]  Joe Biden, real physical revolution to push through his political agenda.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.520]  Real physical.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.520]  That means physical.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:34.520]  That means force.
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.120]  That means violence.
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.800]  Imagine if a Republican had said this.
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.160]  They're claiming Trump's the violent woman.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:42.000]  He's just carrying out the law.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.800]  So here's the top of the headlines we have.
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:52.720]  World War III imminent, deep state desperate for war with Iran and Russia.
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:58.040]  Jerusalem Post, U.S. bombing of Iran will be massive, but will be limited to a specific
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:35:59.040]  target.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:09.560]  U.N. officials say U.S. planning tactical assault.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:10.560]  Think about that.
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:15.240]  U.N. official says U.S. planning tactical assault on Iran as Trump sends troops to the
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:17.320]  Middle East.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:18.320]  Think about that.
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:22.920]  Meanwhile, Trump threatens to deport millions beginning of next week.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:25.640]  We've already got millions the last year that came in totally illegally.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:29.680]  If people don't see them deported, it will signal to everybody else that you can come
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:33.920]  here and get away with it and get everything free.
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.360]  That's coming up.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.560]  And we told you this a while back a couple years ago.
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.560]  Now it's official.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.360]  Facebook announces creation of digital currency.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:46.920]  Even mainstream news calls it incredibly authoritarian and next level invasion of privacy, tracking
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:52.840]  everything you buy, everything you do outside of Facebook, and then penalizing you in live
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:58.000]  time by demonetizing or devaluing your currency depending on your behavior.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:05.200]  This is the gold standard of the Chinese social score or the mark of the beast.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:12.520]  Dawn of Libra, Facebook's most dangerous surveillance disrupting the world.
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:16.040]  They already got all these little assistance systems in your house, and they announced
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.680]  last week we're watching and listening to you.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:25.720]  If you say something racist, you'll pay outside of Facebook, off platform.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:32.880]  I mean, this is one giant open air reeducation camp, and notice how everything's more fantastical
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:35.160]  than we can even imagine just suddenly.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.760]  That's how tyrannies work.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:46.840]  They build up, they prepare, they line up, they probe, they launch, and Zuckerberg looks
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:50.720]  like a gray alien that has a wig on.
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:51.960]  He looks like a robot.
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:38:02.280]  He looks like data from Star Trek, and the whole thing's a giant cult with 2.4 billion
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:06.440]  members that are going to abuse and use, and all the big banks and governments say Facebook's
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.920]  allowed to do it.
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:08.920]  Nobody else can.
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:14.400]  Well, I saw that coming a long time ago, and they think everybody's going to feverishly
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:19.720]  run and invest, but let's get back to the threats of violence on your phone calls.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:24.600]  Here's Joe Biden advocates real physical revolution to push through his political agenda.
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:28.480]  Talk about dog whistles, baby.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.240]  This is one you can hear.
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:33.080]  That's the declaration of physical war.
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:34.080]  Here it is.
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:38.320]  And so, folks, look, if you start off with an ocean, there's nothing you can do, well,
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:42.920]  might y'all go home then, man, or let's start a real physical revolution if you're talking
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:48.880]  about it, because we have to be able to change what we're doing within our system.
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.960]  So you see that poor people's campaign?
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:51.960]  That's antifung.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:57.000]  And that's Soros funded, and that's the radical Communist Party.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  So this is a guy that rips poor people off his whole life as a total scammer.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  Okay.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.800]  Again, I mentioned this last week, never got to the clip, but here it is, Denver councilmember
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:13.480]  wins with promised to impose communism by any means necessary.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:19.760]  Candia said to Banca, if I'm saying that right, won a runoff race last week against former
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:25.600]  Denver city council president, Albus Brooks, and she did it by promising to implement communist
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:27.720]  policies by any means necessary.
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:33.120]  This means the overthrow of the government, grabbing your bank account, grabbing your
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:37.520]  company, grabbing your factory, organizing your kids to go work in work brigades with
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:42.280]  them, and then promoting your children and others if they tattle on you.
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:45.160]  But see, Facebook's going to make it so easy.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:48.920]  That's why Google's moving into the Stasi's former headquarters in East Germany, and that's
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:55.600]  why five years ago Facebook began hiring former Stasi commanders.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:04.800]  So yes, pure crystalline evil, pure.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:10.520]  And I think listeners understand now that I put a stoic face on all this and said, hey,
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:12.000]  you don't support us, we'll be shut down.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.320]  Hey, there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes you don't know about.
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:21.520]  And now everybody's like, whoa, you're in every paper in the country saying you sent
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:26.480]  a child pornography out, but the local papers and others admitted that somebody sent you
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:29.920]  an email you never opened, and then they wanted it through discovery and went right
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:33.720]  there to the hidden information, and then the news put it out like that.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:34.720]  That's incredible.
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:36.120]  Anybody could get sent that.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.120]  People do all the time.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:38.120]  You never even opened it.
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:39.120]  The FBI admits it.
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:43.880]  But see, the gloves were taken off a while back, folks.
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:45.320]  Now they've got the knives out.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:48.120]  You have to understand something.
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:50.840]  They're going all the way.
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:53.360]  We have infiltrated Antifa meetings.
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:54.360]  They're funded heavily.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:56.440]  They're run by the University of Texas here in Austin.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:00.120]  The Chinese government has a Confucius organization that just got outlawed that was actually
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.120]  commanding it.
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:08.120]  Chinese military officers commanding armed thug brigades on the streets of Austin all
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:10.640]  over the country.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.920]  And MS-13 run by the Democrats, and Hezbollah signed on the Democrats.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.680]  I mean, we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:17.680]  Hillary was supposed to get in.
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:20.680]  They were supposed to start a race war, and they were supposed to have all their parables
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:24.120]  in their military groups right out of the Weatherman Handbook take over.
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:26.520]  And you say, well, that doesn't make sense.
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:27.520]  That's crazy.
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:28.520]  That's bold.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:29.520]  Well, you know what?
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:30.520]  They took China that way.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:34.320]  They took a lot of other places that way, and they're going to try it here.
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:38.800]  And they're going to try to paralyze people fighting back if we go to a hot revolution
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:42.960]  by saying you're a racist, because they've tried to make it along racial lines so that
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:48.240]  minorities, or the majority in most areas, don't feel like they could be part of Americana.
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:54.200]  They inflict the psychic wound on them to be successful and have freedom and own a gun.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:42:03.040]  And to be happy is white and is evil, and has to get its systems shut down.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:10.040]  So again, I want to be very, very, very, very clear with everybody, I want to be very, very
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:14.440]  clear with everybody about all of this.
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:20.040]  We're going into the season of war, and they have been inches from shutting down the final
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:25.120]  mega-counts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:28.720]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:30.240]  We need it in here.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.240]  We need to be provisioned.
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:36.720]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:37.720]  fearlessly.
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:42.560]  I'm loving every minute of this, because I know I'm getting under their skin, I'm bloody
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:47.280]  and then I'm up politically, I'm banging heads with them, and they can't help but attack
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:49.640]  back with lies, and that just brings more people here.
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:55.720]  So I'm in one hell of a fight, and so are you, and I need war bonds, I need gas, I need
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:58.720]  ammo politically now.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:03.400]  In Howard, the most banned network in the world.
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:07.760]  Tom and Texas police officer on the border talks about MS-13 and more.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:08.760]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:09.760]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.760]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:12.760]  Thank you for your products.
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:17.640]  I have the InfoWars decals on outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sport the shirts,
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:18.640]  all the equipment.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:20.280]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:21.280]  God bless you, brother.
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:25.080]  And I have three or four InfoWars bumper stickers in my glove box right now, I hand
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.400]  out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:29.400]  You're our only hope, brother.
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:31.760]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:35.040]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:39.520]  All of our best sellers, Alphapower, Violent Mental Fusion, BioTrux Selenium, X-Tube,
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:44.760]  Rainforest Plus, Supermode Vitality, DNA Force Plus, Superblue, Products, Toothpaste, 4-5
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:49.040]  Equinole Silver, Iodine, Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver, Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus,
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.920]  it goes on and on and on.
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:53.640]  Check it all out and know, funding us will change the world.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:57.520]  All of it, we're coming through the storm thanks to you.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:02.360]  InfoWars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:04.040]  the last year or so.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:08.720]  It's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:15.240]  I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to stumble up on deck as the captain
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:20.760]  of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking, I've begged for your support before and thanks
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:24.920]  for keeping us afloat, but this is the real SOS, if you don't buy a bunch of products
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:30.240]  and spread the word and keep fighting, InfoWars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:31.240]  And so we've reached that point.
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:35.920]  It'll make the enemy happy, but you know whatever, we have withstood so many of their attacks,
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.840]  we've gone through so much because of your support, you have been there.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.560]  But let me tell you, they are pissed, they haven't been successful and they're giving
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:48.280]  us their full assault, so we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.760]  now at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:51.760]  It's your fight.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:45:07.600]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:12.520]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:13.520]  one another.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:17.760]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:22.920]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:27.160]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:31.520]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:32.520]  and supporting InfoWars.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:37.160]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:41.000]  a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:46.200]  driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech,
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:50.560]  letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:55.160]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:46:00.280]  of free press and free speech with free markets.
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:02.280]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:03.280]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:04.280]  You are the man, Alex.
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:05.800]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:06.800]  I'm so excited.
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:07.800]  I'm such a big fan.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.000]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.600]  I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:18.280]  The bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth.
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:22.600]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:23.600]  It tastes like oval theme.
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:24.600]  It tastes like oval theme.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:25.600]  It tastes like oval theme.
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:26.600]  It tastes like oval theme.
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:27.600]  Like good.
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:30.640]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:35.040]  My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride free toothpaste.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:39.640]  I've used the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:40.640]  that as well.
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:43.160]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:44.160]  I'm thanking you.
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:48.880]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:51.240]  the two bone broth, it is next level.
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:52.240]  It really is good.
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:53.240]  So thank you.
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:47:02.000]  I feel great since I've been taking it, thank you.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:19.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:32.600]  Man, I see some great points that callers are making.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:37.080]  We don't screen your calls except where you're calling from and that you got a good phone.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:45.920]  But you can volunteer comments and it's Bregan Canada, Alex Jones being attacked, Kenyon,
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:51.320]  the Antitrust lawsuit, Facebook, Google, Big Tech breakup, Andrew, Drag Queen shows, child
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:56.920]  porn attacks, Kim in North Carolina, Russia to Trump, Sandy Hook to Alex Jones.
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:57.920]  That's a good point.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:02.800]  Jack in Wisconsin comments on Trump censorship, fake news, Jeff in Canada, false accusations
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:11.040]  and attacks, Stan Indiana making America great again, Trump comments, Leah, Illinois, a trucker
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:15.720]  on Trump and the border topic, Charlie, Twitter bannings, Internet censorship.
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.720]  That's just some of the calls.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:19.600]  By the way, I heard about this Sunday.
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:25.080]  He was on Stephanopoulos and then I looked for it yesterday but I got blindsided by the
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:28.280]  massive attack of lies against us.
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:32.720]  The attempt to totally destroy me and have this huge hoax that everybody believes, you
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.280]  know, that I've done these horrible things I didn't do.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:39.640]  Even though I've been in the news, I didn't and I was the victim.
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:45.160]  We have searched the official archives of ABC yesterday and today.
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.880]  We've looked online.
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:53.160]  They aired it live but they cut it out.
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:58.240]  Now we have the transcript but think about this, the president said he thinks he knows
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:48:59.240]  who's behind 9-11.
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:02.960]  Of course, he's got all the classified info he knows.
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:08.960]  He let the deep state know he knows who they worked with but they still don't back down.
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:11.000]  He just can't believe it.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.240]  So the story's on newswars.com, that's newswars.com.
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:17.840]  Trump, I think I know who was behind 9-11.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:23.120]  Later in the next hour, I'm going to get to this huge story and we're going to get into
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:24.120]  the huge announcements.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:29.240]  Are we really going to be attacking Iran and what Facebook's digital currency means and
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:30.240]  why?
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:31.480]  Look at dredgerport.com.
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:36.560]  Top computer analyst are saying it is the biggest invasion of privacy, the most dangerous
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:42.280]  authoritarianism, the planet's ever seen because when you use their currency, it tracks everything
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:58.680]  you buy in a chain all the way through its life everywhere, unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable.
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:00.960]  So and what's it going to look like with Trump deporting millions?
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:06.800]  Again, he has to or it just sets the precedent that everybody's to just come in and say,
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:07.800]  stay here.
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:14.280]  This is crazy, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:20.800]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Kim, Kim in North Carolina.
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:21.800]  Thanks for calling.
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:22.800]  Hello.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:23.800]  Hi, Kim.
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:24.800]  Thank you for calling.
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:25.800]  Hi, Alex.
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:28.520]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:30.960]  I want to say first of all, I'm a Christian woman.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:31.960]  I'm a black woman.
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:36.320]  I'm a conservative woman and I'm a Republican woman.
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:42.800]  And when I think about what they're doing to President Trump with Russia, Russia, Russia,
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:47.000]  trying to drum it into the people's minds and trying to brainwash people where they're
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:53.680]  doing the same thing with you and Sandy Hook, it's the same thing because they're trying
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.680]  to drum it into people that you are Sandy Hook.
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:50:59.960]  Again, this is the way you're supposed to be labeled.
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:05.680]  This is the way people are supposed to see you and this is a brainwashing technique for
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:13.200]  unsuspected people.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:16.760]  I should hire you as my PR spokesperson because you just crystallized what I've been trying
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:18.600]  to say in an hour and a half.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:19.600]  This is brainwashing.
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:20.600]  This is a technique.
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:24.200]  And now because the Sandy Hook doesn't work, well, we'll just attach child porn to it.
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:26.080]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:28.640]  And again, I believe it's parallel construction from the beginning.
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:32.440]  I'm not saying the lawyers involved are doing the parallel construction, but it's where
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:34.960]  you know something's been planted.
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:39.600]  You know something's there, but you did it illegally, so you've got to use another investigation
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:42.080]  to then get it in discovery and then you put it out.
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:43.080]  Make sense?
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:44.080]  Yes.
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:46.640]  And I'm still waiting to become a member of your podcast team.
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:48.160]  We discussed it.
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:49.160]  And also...
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:50.160]  Oh, yeah.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:53.600]  Anytime there's an awesome caller and I said this three, four years ago and we got held
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:54.600]  up.
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:55.600]  We've got a list of about 10 people.
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:56.600]  They're part of a podcast.
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:58.400]  Give us your name and number again, sweetie.
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:02.360]  And I apologize because I'm always trying to launch new stuff and they've kind of kept
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:05.000]  me tied down and I apologize.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.640]  And I'm telling the people, wake up.
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:07.640]  Don't fall for it.
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:08.640]  It's a trick.
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:09.800]  It's a trap.
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:14.920]  Use your God-given senses and know that the enemy is...
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:20.640]  He's basically backed up in a corner and he's trying every single thing that he can to come
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:21.640]  and bring.
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:22.640]  It's a spiritual warfare.
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:23.640]  That's what it is.
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:25.160]  It's not natural.
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:27.600]  It's spiritual for our kids.
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:32.800]  And also in Luke 7, 2, it says that we would be better for them to throw, be thrown into
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:37.920]  the sea with a millstone around their neck than for one of the little ones to stumble.
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:43.240]  Kim, I've been talking for years about launching this podcast with our best callers and we
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:46.600]  got a list of about 10 people and I bet your name is still on the computer, but give us
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:47.920]  your full name and info again.
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:51.680]  And I'm going to commit, I'm going to give it to our lead producer to just launch the
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.360]  once a week podcast for two hours with the callers, you know, call it the people show
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:00.400]  or something, the callers show or something and we'll get it launched because I don't
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:01.800]  know about a couple other shows.
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:05.400]  It's just so hard to get it lined out in the midst of this, but I'm not complaining.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:06.680]  We're going to get it done.
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:07.680]  And God bless you, man.
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.040]  I appreciate your call.
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.360]  Folks get her full info again right now.
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:11.360]  Thank you, John.
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:12.360]  John's in there running the phones.
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.360]  Doing a great job.
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:15.360]  She's absolutely right.
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:20.960]  You know, when you experience the spiritual battle, when you're in Seattle or you're
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:26.120]  in LA or you're in Austin in a liberal area and people literally, they don't just do it
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:29.560]  because they think you're a Christian and it messes with you.
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:34.360]  We've shown you hundreds of these videos, the, you know, I mean, some of the ones down
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:41.680]  in Houston where the guys like Satan look at you and we're going to tell babies.
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:46.160]  And then you walk around a corner and another one goes, Oh, yes, Satan's in control.
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:49.320]  It's like agent Smith can jump in person after person in the matrix.
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:50.480]  It's exactly like that.
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:54.840]  The Bible talks about like crisis going along and a demon's jumping from person to person
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:55.840]  as he goes to the town.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:59.480]  The same demons hopping and different people saying, Oh, yes, you're going to die.
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:00.480]  You're dead.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:01.480]  Oh, I'm going to get you.
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:02.480]  He goes to the next street.
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:07.200]  Oh, and you're like, Whoa.
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:11.280]  When you experience these people, ladies and gentlemen, it's unbelievable.
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:13.160]  They're beyond NPCs.
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:17.960]  They're demonic NPCs.
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:21.000]  And you've got to experience it.
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.400]  It's unbelievable.
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:25.600]  And you see it.
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:30.200]  And that's why I'm begging people to pray for our operation, the name of Jesus Christ,
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:31.600]  because the enemy flees from that.
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:32.600]  It's real.
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:33.600]  Great points, ma'am.
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:34.600]  Thank you so much.
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:35.600]  Let's get Kim's info.
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:36.600]  Okay.
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:38.160]  I'm going to launch that caller podcast show.
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:39.160]  It's a great idea.
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:40.400]  I've been talking about it for five years.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:41.400]  That's the first thing on our list.
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:42.880]  That's the first thing we're going to do.
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:43.880]  Okay.
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:46.920]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:54.400]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Jack in Wisconsin.
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:55.400]  Jack here on the air.
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:56.400]  Thanks for holding.
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:00.400]  Hi, Mr. Chris Kalasian, Mr. Head of the Curve.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:06.800]  I think a lot of the clown games with what you're experiencing now with Sandy Hook and
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:15.320]  fake news and the Q stuff, coursey stuff is a typical old trick.
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:20.080]  And not only you, but Trump is also experiencing it.
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:25.480]  And it's very important, I think, to have a positive energy and attitude when dealing
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:28.600]  with it because it affects the outcome.
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:36.400]  And also, in general, if you're up against nowadays in reality politics, if you're up
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:43.240]  against an enemy, and optically, it looks like such a grandiose enemy, the defeat, when
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:46.120]  it's knocked out, it's much more glorious.
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:47.120]  Absolutely.
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:52.840]  I just got a text from Norm Pattis, and I see the headlines coming in.
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:56.040]  And again, Norm had to be in another courtroom today and couldn't be there.
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:57.800]  So he had to have one of his other lawyers in it.
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:59.640]  And this is how they're going to spend it one way or the other.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:04.320]  It's this judge that sat there and demanded all our raw emails, then demanded metadata
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:08.360]  on unopened emails, so this could be trawled through.
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:10.080]  And now I get mad and upset.
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:13.800]  Other lawyers act like I'm threatening them when I'm saying I'm angry, whoever planted
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:15.520]  this.
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:18.640]  Judge says, apology from Alex Jones' lawyer in Sandy Hook case falls short.
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:20.600]  I'm not apologizing for any of this stuff.
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:21.600]  I'm done.
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:24.240]  And it goes on.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:28.120]  The lawyer for conspiracy theorists and info wars host Alex Jones apologizes for Jones
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:32.160]  claiming that Sandy Hook families tried to frame him with child pornography.
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:33.160]  That's not.
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:34.840]  I never said that the families did that.
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:36.760]  See how this stuff works, man?
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:37.760]  You go back and watch.
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:42.720]  I didn't say it was the families.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:44.440]  This is just, I'm so sick of this.
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:45.760]  I'm going up to Connecticut.
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:46.920]  That's it, man.
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:47.920]  I am.
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:49.800]  So it just, it never ends.
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:50.800]  Go ahead.
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:55.720]  You know, you have to stand up for yourself and have faith in God.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:57:00.360]  You know, and also you should have, you should have fun doing this because honestly, if you
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:04.920]  look at your entire life history, everything you've done has been building up to this point.
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:07.920]  It's your time now, your player in this.
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:08.920]  It's a good.
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:10.480]  I just want to defeat these people.
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:11.480]  God bless you.
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:12.480]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:13.480]  Just stay there.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:14.480]  I'll come back to you, Jack.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:16.680]  Here's the thing I'm saying.
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:22.240]  Alex Jones faces off with the families today, USA Today, all this crap I'm facing off with
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:23.240]  the families.
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:25.120]  No, I'm facing off the Democratic Party lawyers.
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:26.120]  And so they make it.
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:33.800]  Alex since child porn to the families, no, I didn't or Jones's lawyer apologizes that
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:36.000]  Jones says the family sent it.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.360]  Who knows if that's even true, but if that lawyer did say that, I'm pissed that that's
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:41.360]  how this works.
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:49.240]  Man, it's just all BS and these judges take whatever MSN says as if God did it.
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:54.000]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:53.560]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:58.760]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:05.560]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:11.440]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:14.760]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:19.680]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:24.760]  of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:25.760]  symptoms.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:31.240]  Pollin block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine, in fact, current research
[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:36.000]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.160]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:42.880]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:51.440]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:57.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:57.280 --> 02:00:02.040]  Breaking news out of Silicon Valley, Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy
[02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:04.000]  theorists and alt-right figures.
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.760]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:11.840]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:14.800]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:19.600]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Lewis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:28.600]  of them were designated dangerous individuals, dangerous individuals, dangerous individuals
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:29.600]  and organizations.
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:38.480]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous, dangerous like hurting other
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:42.680]  people or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:47.240]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:49.000]  How dangerous is infowars?
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:53.520]  What is the difference right at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and infowars.com?
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:56.200]  Infowars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:58.720]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:01.400]  Infowars' content is useful to him.
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:03.280]  Infowars' personalities align with him.
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:07.160]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted, I think they are horrible
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:08.160]  for our society.
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:12.240]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:17.240]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal view.
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:21.680]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:26.200]  highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:31.720]  and we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist, primarily to violate
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:35.080]  our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:39.480]  Screw your rules, your rules go against our values and they are patently un-American.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:44.400]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions, he's prescribing which political
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:46.720]  opinions you're allowed to have.
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:49.320]  We need a digital fill of riots.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:53.200]  They are becoming the public square and they control how we interact with each other and
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:56.760]  if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:00.360]  companies, you are absolutely insane and you are part of the problem.
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:04.640]  You are a bad person, you should be censored off the internet, bad, yes, get out of here
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:05.640]  Alex.
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:08.800]  Infowars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:10.160]  at Trump's Twitter feed.
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:16.040]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:19.240]  say, the Infowars president.
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:23.520]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:29.040]  Okay, I'm going to come back with your calls in the next segment, I'm going to play a few
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:35.520]  minutes of the intro of a video up on infowars.com with the joke title, Alex Jones runs the French
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:39.240]  caliphate out of his office, but France pretty much is run by the Muslims now, so that's
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:43.480]  why I said that, but they were here to cover, Sandy Hook were very deceptive about what
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:47.800]  they were here to cover, so I ended up having an argument with them and then they basically
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:49.800]  said they were going to leave, so I said, yeah, get out.
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:52.920]  Here's a few minutes of the video that's up on infowars.com.
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:58.720]  A French film crew approached Alex Jones for an interview under the guise of the conversation
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:03.920]  being about how freedom of speech differs between Europe and America.
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:09.960]  But prior to their arrival, our sources alerted us that their intentions were very different.
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:24.200]  Here is the full interaction.
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:41.320]  Again, Megan Kelly came to town two years ago to get me to talk about Sandy Hook and
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:44.320]  then she edited the whole thing together and she's going to be involved in these upcoming
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:45.320]  suits if they continue on.
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:46.320]  A total deception and all media doesn't know.
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:49.720]  John Ronson came here and we actually taped the entire interview with him, he's not important
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:52.160]  enough to put it out, which has been too busy.
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:56.720]  But we taped the hour-long interview I did with him, they got well down to four minutes
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:00.200]  for NPR where nothing I said made any sense.
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:03.920]  So now I figured they're so arrogant, they're going to still edit it together, but we're
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:08.760]  going to have what they actually twisted just like we're going to have with Megan Kelly
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:11.960]  in the lawsuit with their actual raw tapes.
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:16.280]  And more and more, this is the key, is you tape corporate media, mainstream media, so
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:20.760]  that when they try to edit what you said deceptively, they get caught.
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:24.760]  But they still think they're in power, they still think they have all control and so they
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:25.760]  still do it.
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:29.680]  And I guarantee you, this is a hit piece, they're going to say, why'd you make the man commit
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:34.240]  suicide, not true, why'd you harass the families, it didn't happen, they're going to say all
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:35.240]  that and they're out of the picture.
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:40.680]  All off-camera in this video that's up on infowars.com, Alex Jones destroys Islamic Caliphate
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:41.680]  from France.
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:42.680]  That's not even mine.
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:46.680]  I'm going to head watch Coopie, I think I'm going to make it more clear.
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:51.000]  I'm going to put the report which national French music that is, I think you can kind
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:56.680]  of rush that one out, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:05:01.480]  Infowars and free speech, and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:07.840]  the last year or so, it's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane.
[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:13.440]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:18.880]  deck as the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking, I've begged for your
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:22.840]  support before and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real SOS, if you don't buy
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:27.880]  a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, infowars will be shut down,
[02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:28.880]  not just crippled.
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:33.080]  And so we've reached that point, it'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we
[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:37.560]  have withstood so many of their attacks, we've gone through so much because of your support,
[02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:42.280]  you have been there, but let me tell you, they are pissed, they haven't been successful,
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:46.600]  and they're giving us their full assault, so we need your prayers, your financial support
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:49.840]  and your word of mouth now at infowarscore.com.
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:54.080]  It's your fight, decide whether or not you want infowars to continue, because we could
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:06:22.360]  be shut down.
[02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:35.920]  That's the way it works, and how the system operates, and you know, how the layer of skull
[02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:42.200]  and bones is just filled with people that have been installed because they serve evil,
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:46.360]  is a real honor to face.
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:51.800]  I am blessed to be in this position and I have no doubt that they're going to sanction
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:55.200]  me and make up more stuff I didn't do.
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:58.920]  And because they're losing these cases, what they've said about me isn't true.
[02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:01.920]  And so they're just going to continue to replace it with more lies.
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:05.120]  But in the end, it's all going to come out.
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:09.760]  Now, I'm going to continue with your phone calls.
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:13.600]  And then towards the end of the hour, I'm going to hit all the big arrests of pedophiles
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:16.360]  around the country, actually trafficking in children.
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:19.400]  Now it ties to Hillary Clinton and so much more.
[02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:21.280]  So that's all coming up.
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:27.420]  But I wanted to get to an important report here that ties into Facebook, announces creation
[02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:33.040]  of digital currency, drugsreport.com, has top analysts saying this is the greatest threat
[02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:34.120]  to privacy ever.
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:40.240]  This is show out of control, tracking through the blockchain everywhere that money goes,
[02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:44.640]  everything you ever do, so you can penalize people for their political actions, their
[02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:48.800]  religious actions, you name it, it's a total surveillance system where you can make people's
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:51.640]  currencies worth more if they're good little servants.
[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:52.960]  It is the mark of the beast.
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:55.560]  It is the communist Chinese social credit score.
[02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:56.560]  It is incredible.
[02:07:56.560 --> 02:08:01.280]  And they don't want us here on air covering this because it's all coming in like a flood
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:04.240]  and people are resisting it.
[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:08.440]  You know, people used to watch TV, but now the TV's watch you and big brothers sitting
[02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:10.560]  right next to you in your home.
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:11.560]  Here it is.
[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:21.720]  You remember 20 years ago when I got a visit from a former high level NSA engineer who
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:27.760]  worked for Time Warner and he said, open up the scientific Atlantic cable box.
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:28.760]  Here's the manual.
[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:29.880]  There's a microphone.
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:35.400]  It gets keywords and reports it all back to the national security agency.
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:43.720]  Now three days after I showed people this on television, they had people come attack
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:50.800]  me in a parking lot and say, we're going to kill you if you keep talking about this.
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:56.920]  Now that was 20 years ago or so, maybe more.
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:09:06.640]  Today, remember like seven years ago, the head of the CIA at the time said your appliances
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:09.640]  are listening and watching to you.
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:12.800]  It was a large magazine article.
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:16.880]  Now there's over a hundred home assist devices with cameras and microphones that are on
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:18.520]  all the time.
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:23.480]  And it was six years ago, seven years ago, it was an info wars.com article, we first
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:24.480]  broke it.
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:30.440]  Sam's son came out and said, smart TVs, we're selling audio and video of you and your house.
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:32.440]  So watch what you do.
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:34.000]  Don't have sex in front of the television.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.640]  Well, my God, it's in the damn bedroom.
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:38.840]  And don't say things you shouldn't say.
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:41.840]  And that's what Eric Schmidt said from Google at the same time.
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:45.440]  He said, oh, yeah, everything you're doing is being watched on the internet.
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:46.440]  Watch what you do.
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:51.240]  Well, Facebook has its system in your house that's beyond the TV screen.
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:52.240]  It's always on.
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:57.600]  It tracks you, they call it portal and again, they've all got these, but here's the new
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:58.600]  big enchilada.
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:03.320]  And see, I was in the middle of this, you know, I said within five years, two months
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:09.720]  ago when this happened, I said within five years, everyone will be watched by these portals
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:12.560]  and it'll be the law they've got to be in your house, basically, because they're already
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:16.720]  proposing that for your security, of course, or they'll be tax incentives if you do have
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:17.720]  it.
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:18.960]  And all the cars will be quasi driverless.
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:19.960]  That's already happening.
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:23.120]  The phone already says, oh, you're driving, you got to tell it, oh, you're not, even though
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:24.120]  you know you are.
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:25.600]  AI is already watching you.
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.760]  So this is just the AI phase in of our minders, of our little guardian devils.
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:35.280]  And then it came out a couple months ago that they said, well, Alex Jones actually isn't
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:36.280]  anti-Semitic.
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:40.040]  They shouldn't ban me even if I was, and he hasn't done any things they say.
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:46.640]  These were internal emails that Business Insider published, but they said, if 30% of the comments
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:50.520]  on his Facebook page are anti-Semitic, we'll ban him.
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:53.600]  Well, that was a message for the left to all go see anti-Semitic things.
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:55.680]  And then they went, oh, it hit 30%.
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:59.160]  He's now banned for life as a hateful bad person.
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:02.960]  And it was even put on my banking record with G2.
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:06.360]  So when Facebook says you're bad, man, it goes on your banking record.
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:09.040]  Even though I've got great credit, didn't matter.
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:11.160]  We have the internal G2 reports.
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:15.680]  It just says perfect credit, perfect everything, but somebody said he was hateful, so his life's
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:16.680]  over.
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:17.680]  Do not loan to him.
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:18.680]  His ego.
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:19.680]  He goes to the gulag.
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:20.680]  We'll be filing suit very, very soon.
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:21.680]  I keep warning him.
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:22.680]  No response back.
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:23.680]  Okay.
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:24.680]  All right.
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:26.160]  There you go then.
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:27.880]  So here's the new story.
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:33.200]  Here's the big trillion pound enchilada with chili con carne sauce on top and shredded
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:36.040]  cheese and onions, but it's got cyanide loaded into it.
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:37.040]  So enjoy it.
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:43.760]  It says in there that we have devices listening and watching you in your home.
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:46.160]  It's actually in the article.
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:48.080]  This is Facebook admits this.
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:53.280]  There is exclusive Facebook process to label you an agent of hate revealed.
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:12:00.760]  It says, well, this is from their email that they're not, they're very proud of this now.
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:07.160]  That Facebook is watching and listening to you and everyone you talk to and is listening
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:12.520]  to you in your house and watching you and it's been recording you.
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:17.600]  And so even if you said something racist or bad privately years ago, they're now going
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:23.880]  to have AI scan that and you're going to be kicked off Facebook or, oh, don't worry.
[02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:29.680]  They're going to give you a directive to mitigate so they don't tell the world and your credit
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:30.680]  score.
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:31.680]  You're a bad person.
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:32.680]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:33.680]  It's all been announced.
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:39.200]  They also say they're going to sue you because in your terms of service, you agree to not
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:43.080]  be a hateful bad person or doing these things.
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:47.680]  But if anyone ever reports you or there's a recording or they hear you in your house
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:53.960]  do it, you've contractually agreed it's bad and they're going to sue you for contractual
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:54.960]  violation.
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:00.200]  Now, folks, this is like 500 times worse than 1984.
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:01.680]  This isn't science fiction.
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:29.240]  This is scientific dystopia now.
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:38.240]  In 2018 in the United States of America, tech giants Facebook, Apple and Google have deemed
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:44.880]  the information coming from Alex Jones to be too dangerous for public consumption and
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:49.280]  have forbidden him from having a voice.
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:58.160]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive, but if you can get through all
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:04.240]  that to explore what he's been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:10.960]  wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life changing.
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:11.960]  He predicted 9-11.
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:17.640]  And if there was an outside threat like a bin lad who was a known CIA asset in the 80s,
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:20.960]  he's the boogeyman they need and this was a welly and phony system.
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:29.560]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony and bohemian grove.
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:37.240]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalist prison
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:41.040]  planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:48.920]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg group at all.
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:53.840]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:54.840]  Valley.
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.440]  They falsely edited him.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:03.880]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:10.280]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:21.160]  And now he's being deep platformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:25.720]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:29.600]  And then we get hit, say, even no longer use our software.
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:32.440]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:34.120]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:35.440]  They just killed our stream.
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:36.440]  Really?
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:37.440]  Yep.
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:41.240]  Americans are actually celebrating this.
[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:45.240]  This is America.
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:48.240]  This is America in 2018.
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:55.640]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away?

[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:02.720]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:04.720]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:06.400]  You need survivalist camps.

[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:31.840]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:34.840]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.

[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:42.120]  All right, the last segment, I heard a few special reports because they've been produced
[02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:47.400]  and we're important, but also I had to talk to some lawyers in Connecticut not to find
[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:48.400]  out the latest salvo.
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:49.920]  And we know how this works.
[02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:52.960]  We know who to sue.
[02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:56.120]  It's the Connecticut Post.
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:21:01.760]  They're the ones that put out the big disinformation statements that then the rest of the media
[02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:06.400]  picks up and then the judge, whether she's ignorant or whatever, goes with it as if it
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:10.400]  came out of the mouth of God.
[02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:17.400]  And so they're there saying that offered a million dollars for the head of this lawyer.
[02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:22.560]  When I said there's a reward for who sent us the child porn and we don't know who it
[02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:30.240]  is and it's clear that I'm mad at them because of the discovery process, but I'm not calling
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:32.160]  for violence against them.
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:33.160]  But that doesn't matter.
[02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:38.240]  They clip and they paste and they manipulate and they go in because again, I'm the bad
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:39.240]  guy.
[02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:40.240]  Look at this headline.
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:48.080]  The apology from Alex Jones' lawyer in Sandy Case Hook falls short.
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:49.080]  So what does it say again?
[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:52.040]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:55.000]  And then it goes to say that I said the families did it.
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000]  They always hide behind the families.
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:02.120]  I never said the families sent that in.
[02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:05.800]  I said it's very, very suspicious and I said I'm going to find out who did it and I'm
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:10.560]  going to see their head on a pike, that's a figure of speech, but it won't matter.
[02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:15.160]  Won't matter because all the blue bloods up in Connecticut are going to show that loud
[02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:23.480]  mouth dumb Texan that they'll put me under the jail because old Hillary didn't get elected.
[02:22:23.480 --> 02:22:24.480]  That's how it works.
[02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:25.480]  Well, guess what?
[02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:27.040]  Old Hillary's in a lot of trouble.
[02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:33.800]  So that's how this stuff works and it's all going to come out and no one is buying that
[02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:35.920]  I sent child born to the families.
[02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:37.960]  No one.
[02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:42.480]  It's just more of the mainstream media committing political and cultural suicide.
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:50.200]  Oh, he said we're going to kill ourselves another threat.
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:56.120]  The truth is I've been here with a French crew was already mad at them.
[02:22:56.120 --> 02:23:00.800]  That was going on behind the scenes during the breaks.
[02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:09.320]  And the truth is I said I think it's suspicious and that that stuff was planted by somebody.
[02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:10.320]  That's why I'm offering a reward.
[02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:23.560]  But oh, the Connecticut Post, they said I was talking about this Maddy guy because his
[02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:28.760]  article was sitting there and I was banging the table and his face was on the table.
[02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:29.760]  Give me a break.
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:33.640]  I'm banging the table when my face is on it.
[02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:36.080]  Does that mean I'm going to get Alex Jones?
[02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:38.080]  Give me a break.
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:41.080]  It's unbelievable.
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:45.640]  No, I blame them for going to the FBI, not going to the FBI, but going there and I'm
[02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:50.320]  told trying to get me indicted when I talked to all the defense lawyers and people sending
[02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:51.320]  you child porn.
[02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:53.480]  You don't open as a crime.
[02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:57.720]  And then they want millions of emails turned over and say, oh, we didn't do diligence
[02:23:57.720 --> 02:23:59.840]  on opening every attachment.
[02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:01.800]  I'm not opening any attachments.
[02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:04.000]  That judge orders me to open attachments.
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:08.200]  I'm not doing it so you can then charge me with opening child porn.
[02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:09.200]  It's not happening.
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:13.120]  I'm not walking the plank, even though you think I'm some dumb country bumpkin that just
[02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:19.600]  fell off a turnip truck yesterday when it's all said and done, this is going to come out.
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:26.320]  But I almost had a cerebral hemorrhage during that one minute break at the five after when
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:31.840]  I was reading the news article that my lawyer apologized for me threatening the families.
[02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:33.760]  But I didn't do that.
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:34.880]  And then I call up Norm.
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:38.560]  That's not what the transcript says, but I do have some of the transcript of the judge
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:40.880]  going along with it.
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.120]  And that's what I face.
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:43.120]  But you know what?
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:44.120]  I'm not a loser.
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:45.400]  I'm a winner.
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:48.240]  That's what happens when you fight evil.
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:52.960]  That's what happens when you're effective against evil.
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:56.000]  And so we all have to face evil every generation.
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.200]  Most of these people just go along to get along or they're ignorant.
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:00.080]  Most of them aren't evil.
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:01.760]  All these lawyers aren't bad people, probably.
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:07.280]  They just believe they're following the self-righteous path to big media and success at everything
[02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:11.560]  else if they just can get Alex Jones, the evil homeland character.
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:20.880]  And I blow up every once in a while and my hyperbole swears over and gets confusing.
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:25.440]  And then I clarify in the same broadcast and the next day, long before they do all this
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:33.280]  stuff, and I say, whoever planted it, I'm going to get you.
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:34.280]  And they say, that's me.
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:36.920]  He threatened me, sanctioned him.
[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:38.160]  And how do we get him?
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:44.400]  Well, we'll say he sent porn to the families and we'll say child porn, child exploitation,
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:45.400]  child rape.
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:50.120]  Oh, and then we'll say, then we'll say he said they planted it.
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:54.160]  Hell, first it's, I supposedly said the lawyers did what I didn't say that.
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:55.720]  Now it's the families.
[02:25:55.720 --> 02:26:00.160]  Hell, they'll probably say tomorrow I blame the dead children next.
[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:03.960]  Or maybe the dead hero teacher that tried to protect them that these lawyers sued.
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:05.920]  Maybe they'll say I blame her.
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:12.760]  Hell, make up whatever you want, Connecticut Post and Daniel Tepper will look into who
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:15.200]  this guy is.
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:19.600]  But you know, lies go halfway around the world before the truth puts its pants on, Mark Twain.
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:21.720]  But the truth will come out.
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:26.080]  And this isn't communist China, we're going to have your big victory over the people.
[02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:27.080]  This is America.
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:29.080]  And I believe you're going to fail.
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:32.400]  I believe your globalist plan is going to go down.
[02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:36.840]  And Trump has come out and said he's ready to expose 9-11 and who really did it and so
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:37.840]  much more.
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:39.800]  And the truth is humanity is coming up for air.
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:46.000]  I'm going to go to break and I promise I'm going to go to Jack, Jeff, Stan, Lee, Bob,
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:50.200]  Kenyon first after Jack and then Craig when I got a hurry, I'm going to get you and just
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:52.880]  be ready, boom, boom, boom.
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:58.120]  And then I'll get into all this other news, but it's just incredible to watch how they'll
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:02.920]  use a third rate rag like the CT post.
[02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:07.680]  They'll put out whatever dribble the Democrats want.
[02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:13.520]  And then that regurgitated group of lies is then spread everywhere to all the mainstream
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:18.720]  media baby birds who then repeat it and add more bull to it and they all pass it around
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:20.320]  to everybody.
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:23.960]  But the good news is the young Turks and a bunch of others took it down and others changed
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:28.800]  their headlines because it's lawsuit heaven.
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:35.720]  Now Norm Pattis is in the middle of all this.
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:39.440]  He had to be in another court, couldn't be there for me today, he had his other lawyer
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:40.440]  there.
[02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:41.440]  And I know there's this approach.
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:44.680]  It's like Roger Stone's lawyer goes in with Roger Stone, just tweeted something out from
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:51.160]  a fact sheet about the judge and how she was funded by the Democrats and appointed by Obama.
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:53.400]  Now she was the hanging judge.
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:55.400]  And then Roger's like, I did nothing wrong.
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:28:00.480]  That's just a, you know, Celtic cross or whatever, what you was, his lawyer goes, oh, we apologize
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:01.480]  your honor.
[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:03.360]  Oh, for what Roger did.
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:04.360]  It's terrible.
[02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:07.600]  And then she totally gags him.
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:08.600]  It's unbelievable.
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:09.600]  And that's what they want.
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:12.440]  They want a gag so they can say I'm a child molester.
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:13.840]  Well, guess what?
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:15.920]  It's not going to work.
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:23.200]  I'm not going to sit here while people tell me that I got to take your lies anymore.
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:26.440]  Whatever happens, I'm not backing down any of this crap.
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:32.480]  It's illegal, it's unlawful, it's tyrannical and everybody with a brain that operates knows
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:33.480]  it.
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:34.480]  But I'll tell you this.
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:35.480]  I can find them better.
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:41.760]  Infowarsstore.com, store-wide free shipping, 50% off, double patriot points, same Infowars
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:42.760]  special.
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:43.760]  This is the bad meme.
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:44.760]  This is the emergency.
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:48.600]  This is when we need the financial support so that I can absolutely defeat them on every
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:52.040]  front with the best offensive lawsuits and more.
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:53.040]  Now is the time.
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:55.160]  Flood me with money and I'll keep fighting.
[02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:59.720]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:01.640]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:03.360]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:08.800]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:09.920]  my life.
[02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:15.160]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:20.360]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:23.480]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.

[02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:55.560]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[02:31:55.560 --> 02:32:00.920]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are
[02:32:00.920 --> 02:32:05.000]  control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:10.120]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:13.760]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:18.280]  third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[02:32:18.280 --> 02:32:21.280]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:26.560]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:30.880]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality

[02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:44.800]  and pay for this fight.
[02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:48.720]  They're in Connecticut right now cooking up lies about me to have me arrested, it's
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:52.440]  now hitting the news because they can't beat us.
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:56.480]  They cannot beat us with their fake lawsuits, but they think they're going to lynch me up
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:57.480]  there.
[02:33:57.480 --> 02:33:58.480]  That's the way it works, that's fine too.
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:03.440]  I'm going to go on to the end telling the truth and exposing these globalist demons.
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:08.120]  Okay, we're going to go back to your phone calls, Jack held over and I'm going to hurry
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:09.680]  now because I know I'll get behind.
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:14.240]  What was the other point you wanted to make Jack from Wisconsin?
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:18.720]  I wanted to recommend, I don't know if you saw it though, back in the day it was an older
[02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:25.200]  movie series, episode series, four by three ratio called Wild Palms, do you remember that
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:26.200]  one?
[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:27.200]  No, I don't.
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:32.440]  I'd recommend seeing it, that's a good template for a lot of the clown games and you're feeling
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:38.520]  a lot of frustration and sometimes rage about, since you're ahead of the curve, about people
[02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:44.560]  not waking up, waking up people and most difficultly, waking up people who are pretending to be
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:45.560]  asleep.
[02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:49.080]  And there's a delay, there's a delay we all have to deal with.
[02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:53.080]  Oh, you just said it, a lot of people know what's going on and choose to ignore it or
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:54.080]  join it.
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:35:00.520]  They eat the blue pill, they love the blue pill, you know, like Huxley said, but I'll
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:03.200]  let you get the other callers, I don't want to chat your ear off.
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:05.280]  No, you're awesome brother, thank you.
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:10.480]  No, I mean, I legitimately got mad on Friday, it was the fourth hour of arguing with these
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:13.960]  French reporters and I just kind of conflate and mix everything together.
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:17.680]  I don't, I'm mad at them persecuting me and I'm mad whoever planted it and I think it's
[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:22.040]  suspicious that they went and found all these hidden links and they're trying to spin it.
[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:25.520]  You know, like, like I knew what was going on, an email, somebody sent me that we never
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:30.280]  opened and so I just blow up and I say, whoever has done this, I want to, I want to get you
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:35.000]  busted, you know, big reward, I want to see your head on a pipe, that's figurative.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.160]  And because of the nature of the fact that they're losing these suits and everything
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:43.440]  they say isn't true, they're like, ah, bonanza, now we'll misrepresent this, but it's all
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:44.960]  going to come out.
[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:49.400]  They're trying to get me charged for emails that I was sent about Sandy Hook death-threading
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:55.800]  me that I never opened, that had hidden links in them that they then found.
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:36:01.520]  I think they're scared, not these particular lawyers, but the whole system that whoever
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:05.800]  did sent this is part of the establishment.
[02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:10.640]  And look, it's a $100,000 reward because the legal way to do it is you can't say $100,000
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:14.720]  for arrest, a million for reward because then people might say testimony that isn't true
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:18.080]  for the conviction, plus I don't have a million dollars extra laying around here.
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:22.720]  So I was mad, I was wild, you know, that's how I am ever once in a while.
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:26.760]  And I told the crew when I started exhibiting that, it might happen once a year, last time
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:30.520]  I thought Trump was going to go to war with Syria and started bombing, you know, I flipped
[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:31.520]  out.
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:38.160]  That was in a webcast, so it wasn't as bad, but I mean, I'm real folks, I really care,
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:39.160]  this stuff gets to me.
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:44.640]  The thing is, I'm usually really focused at nothing, but it's all getting compartmentalized.
[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:48.040]  It's all getting stuck right over here like a volcano.
[02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:49.200]  And it was too much.
[02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:54.320]  These French, and I love French people, but the Smarmy ones, the leftist ones, the anti-gun
[02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:59.160]  ones, you know, creeping around here that I hadn't really even green lighted being here
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:03.160]  and then Norm's plane was late, so he wasn't here with them.
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:04.160]  And I just blew up.
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:07.880]  And I blew up at them too, because they're getting in my face later.
[02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:13.680]  That video's up on infowars.com, and at just a certain point, they're liars.
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:15.960]  They said they weren't coming here for what they said.
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:19.880]  I had their emails, so I kept just making the joke, go back to your, you know, Islamic
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:22.600]  Caliphate of France.
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:24.760]  They're all just sellouts, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:27.280]  There's Norm finally got their latest plane was delayed.
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:31.360]  And so I blew up at them and then I go blow up on air, because it's like once you like
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:37.800]  the fuse, man, once the volcano goes off, you know, that's the end of it.
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:45.760]  And anyways, you got our security people here at the office.
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:46.760]  That's enough of that.
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:47.760]  Let's get back to the calls.
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:50.560]  Like I said, Stan Indiana, thank you for holding.
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:51.680]  I really appreciate that.
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:52.680]  I respect you.
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:53.680]  Sorry you had to hold.
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:54.680]  Go ahead, Stan.
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:55.680]  Hello.
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:01.040]  Hey, you know, Stan, your ground is, you know, that's what you got to do.
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:02.920]  You're doing a good job of it.
[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:06.360]  I'm trying, brother, but it's gotten down to being framed now for child porn.
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:07.360]  You know, it's it's like.
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:08.360]  Yeah.
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:10.320]  We always know that's one of their last weapons ahead of killing you.
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:11.320]  Yeah.
[02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:15.960]  Lying and deceiving and trying to project some image of you that is just something that you've
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:21.840]  worked against all your life, maybe anything they can and all they have is words.
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:23.800]  I don't really want to get too often.
[02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:24.800]  No, no, sir.
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:25.800]  You sound like a wise man.
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:26.800]  Go ahead.
[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:27.800]  Make whatever points you want.
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:30.920]  Well, you know, make it get my America great again is what I called about.
[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:36.600]  We need to really look back and reflect upon what we've lost and what we've lost is we've
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:43.640]  lost a lot of integrity in our country because wisdom, awareness is not being allowed with
[02:38:43.640 --> 02:38:46.960]  this lack of information that you're being criticized for.
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:51.080]  And this started as, as a result, as I understand, I'm sure you'll agree.
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:56.960]  After the World War II, our country was overthrown in a lot more ways than it was just from the
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:57.960]  Civil War.
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:02.320]  And yes, we were overthrown in the Civil War in many ways.
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:03.320]  Yes.
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:07.600]  American men don't have say so anymore, and that's one of the problems, especially if
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:09.600]  they're wise and aware.
[02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:10.600]  And let's be clear.
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:15.160]  It isn't like women then run things, evil corrupt men remove good men out of the process
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:18.560]  so there's no leadership and then they rule a nation of slaves.
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:19.560]  Right.
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:23.640]  They become, and it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman, if you're wise and aware,
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:26.280]  they're going to attack you.
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:27.280]  If you want to represent...
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:28.280]  Oh, I agree.
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:31.840]  It doesn't mean that women can't be great leaders or my grandmother sure were.
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:36.280]  My mother is, and I'll say this, the women ain't what they used to be, the men aren't
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:41.040]  what they used to be, and you're absolutely right, but they have targeted people that
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:42.040]  have integrity.
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:45.120]  It's why real Christians are the number one enemy because they know that we're not going
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:46.280]  to take their system.
[02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:52.240]  They seem to be gruminium out of the legislation passed to allow certain people to go through
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:56.040]  college with what I'd consider a failing gradeboard average.
[02:39:56.040 --> 02:40:00.360]  The electronic grading systems put in at the same time the electronic voting machine was
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:01.360]  put in.
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:02.840]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:07.720]  What's happening is, they're putting a nation of morons in charge so that the global is
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:09.200]  going to control them.
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:11.760]  That's how they do it.
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:16.600]  One more point I wanted to make, while I was waiting, I come up with something that I probably
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:18.720]  ought to mention.
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:24.280]  I don't know if you remember it, but there was supposedly a British couple that was maybe
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:26.880]  a Russian double agent.
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:32.120]  They worked back and forth that were killed in Europe, believe it or not, in England.
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:36.000]  They were killed with a Russian chemical agent supposedly.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:44.560]  This was blamed upon Russia by your counterpart, your opponent, I should say, the fake media.
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:50.680]  As a result of that, certain economic sanctions were applied toward Russia.
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:57.520]  Russia may be seeing that as a part of an attack against them.
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:58.520]  They said they died.
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:40:59.520]  They didn't die.
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:02.880]  There was a chemical agent there in the little grocery store, and then they said they were
[02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:03.880]  dead.
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:09.760]  They weren't even dead because they were defectors over, so they played part in the whole deal.
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:12.760]  The fake news is so much on the other side.
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:17.440]  We make mistakes and we blow gaskets, but we're not trying to lie to folks.
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:18.440]  Stand amazing points.
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:21.240]  In fact, if you want to give us your name and number, we're going to launch it the next
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:22.240]  two weeks.
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:24.920]  In case I get arrested anyways, I have a plan.
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:29.000]  We're going to have guest hosts and people, but also we're going to have round table listeners
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:33.680]  every day that get to co-host part of the show and the rest of it, because I am having
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:35.720]  to prepare for no longer being on the air.
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:39.000]  I don't want to have to get to that point, but we've put in a hell of a fight against
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:42.720]  the enemy, and I tend to be here another 10 years, but this is dark, dark days, folks,
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:44.920]  and people don't know what's going on behind the scenes and things.
[02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:47.600]  I can't really fill you in, but thank you so much, sir.
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:48.600]  I appreciate your call.
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:53.560]  We can also make this show, if I'm killed or arrested, more of a Washington Journal
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:57.600]  type show and then have one hour Washington Journal, just taking your calls, just like
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:41:58.920]  they do it, just covering news.
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:41:59.920]  What do you think?
[02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:00.920]  What do you think?
[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:04.320]  And then having a guest, a person that comes in, we've got, oh, and we've got David, and
[02:42:04.320 --> 02:42:08.320]  I intend infowars to continue on, and we're set up a lot of things here, but I'm telling
[02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:15.680]  you that there's a destruction order out on me come hook or crook to get me, and it's
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:16.680]  clear.
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:18.800]  Because they're pulling all the stops out, and I'm not a victim.
[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:19.800]  I asked for this.
[02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:21.000]  I prayed for this.
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.080]  I asked to be put in a position to take on the globalist.
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:24.560]  I asked to change things.
[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:28.440]  I asked to try to, you know, have God make me a vessel, and I promised God, because God,
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:33.720]  I mean, I tried to pray to God 30 years ago, I kind of feel that block in the God, but
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:37.720]  the more you put yourself in a line, the more there's no separation, and I can just instantly
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:38.720]  connect to God.
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:42.920]  I'm always connected to God, and God showed me, said, this is not going to be fun.
[02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:43.920]  Your name's going to be destroyed.
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:47.320]  You're going to ultimately be destroyed, but you're going to do great things, or you're
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:48.320]  ready.
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:49.320]  And I said, yes.
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:52.320]  God said, well, I'm going to start putting weight on you and see what you can take, and
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:54.320]  I've learned to take a lot of pressure.
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:42:57.320]  They've not shut down our speech.
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:02.200]  We're at infowars.com and newswars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants.
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:06.040]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air.
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:09.800]  It was so good to see you on, you know, the iTunes or on YouTube.
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:11.200]  Are you coming back?
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:12.200]  We're at infowars.com.
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:14.200]  We're at newswars.com.
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:16.480]  Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news.
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:17.480]  We have our own videos.
[02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:18.480]  We have our own articles.
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:22.280]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, infowars is still
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:23.280]  checking along.
[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:25.520]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news today.
[02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:26.520]  infowars.com.
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:27.520]  Woo!
[02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:28.520]  Where are you?
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:29.520]  I'm at infowars.com.
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:30.520]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:31.520]  There you go.
[02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:41.360]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:45.160]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:46.160]  Anybody can use it.
[02:43:46.160 --> 02:43:47.160]  Reupload and do whatever you want.
[02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:50.160]  People go to infowars.com and newswars.com.
[02:43:50.160 --> 02:43:51.160]  That's where they find it.
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:55.040]  You know, there's what things go websites and you just go there.
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:59.080]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:04.320]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:07.200]  It literally dumps the population down.
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:11.360]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:14.120]  gone through two permutations.
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:18.240]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:20.200]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:25.480]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:26.480]  incredible.
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:31.400]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:33.680]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:38.320]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:45.200]  other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:46.200]  bioavailable.
[02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:50.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:51.800]  discovery.
[02:44:51.800 --> 02:45:21.080]  So we're here at UX3, now available at m4slife.com.
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:25.920]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged, the human body
[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:29.840]  gets clogged just like that and you may be experiencing back up too.

[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:26.160]  I am now experiencing what only President Trump has experienced or only what a nation
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:29.760]  about to be invaded that's being lied about as experienced.
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:36.160]  Headlines are coming in by the minute that are complete lies.
[02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:43.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, the top Twitter story in trending and also when you search my name
[02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:50.280]  is Father of Sandy Hook Victim wins defamation lawsuit against Alex Jones.
[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:56.160]  It goes on to say I wrote a book called Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:47:58.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is totally insane.
[02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:00.640]  No one's won a lawsuit.
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:02.760]  I did not write that book.
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:04.520]  I think they're getting ready to start a war or something.
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:06.000]  I'm actually getting chills right now.
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:09.800]  I mean, they're saying that I threatened to kill a lawyer.
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:10.800]  Never did that.
[02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:12.600]  They're saying I'm sending child porn out.
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:20.240]  I mean, what in the world is going on here?
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:25.920]  I've got transcripts of a judge in Connecticut saying that I blame the families of Sandy
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:31.080]  Hook for the child porn somebody emailed us that the FBI says I'm the victim on.
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:32.400]  Never did any such thing.
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:36.920]  But this judge believes whatever Koskoff and Koskoff says is democratic law firm like they
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:37.920]  are God.
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:39.920]  Look at the document cam shot.
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:44.360]  Father of Sandy Hook victim wins defamation lawsuit against Alex Jones.
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:50.480]  It goes on to say authors James Fetzer and Mike Palsak.
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:51.960]  What in the hell?
[02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:59.240]  But they know no one's reading below the headline.
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:01.200]  This is galactic level.
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:02.200]  Look at this one.
[02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:06.080]  Judge says apology from Alex Jones as lawyer in Sandy Hook case fall short.
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:09.360]  It goes on to say that I said the families sent me the child porn.
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:12.200]  I never said that.
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:18.040]  The same author says lawyers for Sandy Hook family say Jones sent them child porn.
[02:49:18.040 --> 02:49:19.040]  Total lie.
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:24.880]  I mean, I don't even feel guilty because you know, even if it was a false accusation,
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:27.440]  you still kind of feel embarrassed or bad.
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:30.440]  I'm living in the twilight zone.
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:34.960]  Forget Rod Serling being able to come up with something like this.
[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:44.280]  I'm living in Captain Kangaroo, Queen of Hearts, Alice in Wonderland, one who flew
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:46.440]  over the cuckoo's nest.
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:48.360]  I am living in crazy.
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:50.040]  And by the way, it's not just that one.
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:51.280]  There's a bunch of other art.
[02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:59.000]  This is the top of Twitter that I again, they're doing what they believe in is like this weird
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:03.760]  Harry Potter magic because they're into the occult, they call it lesser magic.
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:07.720]  They believe if they say I lose lawsuits, it makes it happen because people then just
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:12.640]  believe I'm already convicted next level.
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:13.640]  Get Barnes on.
[02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:14.640]  I know Watson's taken over.
[02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:19.560]  Pat is in court right now where the judge is trying to figure out how to put me in jail.
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:20.560]  Wow.
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:25.240]  I mean, you know, I won't make it out of that jail.
[02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:27.240]  I mean, they've got their plan.
[02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:28.360]  They've got it set up.
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:33.640]  They think they know what they're doing and I'll go willingly, but I will not commit
[02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:35.800]  suicide in their jail.
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:37.000]  Remember that.
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.200]  I will never commit suicide.
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:41.560]  They'll say witnesses say Jones hung himself.
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:42.560]  It's not true.
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:43.560]  It's a lie.
[02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:45.480]  I'm telling you, that's where this is going.
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:47.160]  They've told me we're going to get you.
[02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:49.840]  We're going to kill you in emails that I never read.
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:51.440]  And then there's hidden child porn in it.
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:53.880]  For what you said about Sandy Hook, we're going to kill you, Jones.
[02:50:53.880 --> 02:50:59.360]  I never opened it, but it sucked up into Sandy Hook.
[02:50:59.360 --> 02:51:01.400]  And then I say, I'm suspicious of this.
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:06.400]  There's a big reward out and they say, oh my God, boy, we'll teach you Texans.
[02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:08.640]  We'll teach you dirty dogs.
[02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:11.000]  A good trick.
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:17.160]  You think your big mouth leader is going to take our power?
[02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:19.160]  Never.
[02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:21.160]  Good.
[02:51:21.160 --> 02:51:23.160]  Good.
[02:51:23.160 --> 02:51:25.160]  Good.
[02:51:25.160 --> 02:51:33.920]  It's treason then, man, these people are unbelievable.
[02:51:33.920 --> 02:51:35.360]  They're just starting to one up each other.
[02:51:35.360 --> 02:51:37.000]  Well, let's say he lost a lawsuit.
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:38.480]  Yeah, let's say you wrote a book.
[02:51:38.480 --> 02:51:40.280]  Yeah, that'll be good.
[02:51:40.280 --> 02:51:42.160]  Let's say he said the families are sin.
[02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:44.920]  He said family's child porn even better.
[02:51:44.920 --> 02:51:46.480]  Let's say he said they framed him.
[02:51:46.480 --> 02:51:48.760]  Yeah, that's the thing to do.
[02:51:48.760 --> 02:51:49.760]  What else can we make up?
[02:51:49.760 --> 02:51:50.760]  I don't know.
[02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:55.000]  I mean, just imagine demonic gremlins running around, trying to what do we do?
[02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:58.200]  Our master Hillary says he must be defeated.
[02:51:58.200 --> 02:52:00.320]  We were all going to be powerful.
[02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:06.480]  We were going to feast on America's carcass politically, but he got in the way.
[02:52:06.480 --> 02:52:08.680]  It is he who brought forth the Trump.
[02:52:08.680 --> 02:52:12.240]  It is he who conjured our enemy, that's what they say.
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:13.560]  He's the mad prophet.
[02:52:13.560 --> 02:52:14.720]  He's the one to take out.
[02:52:14.720 --> 02:52:15.720]  Get him.
[02:52:15.720 --> 02:52:16.720]  Get him.
[02:52:16.720 --> 02:52:17.720]  Get him.
[02:52:17.720 --> 02:52:18.720]  Get him.
[02:52:18.720 --> 02:52:19.720]  Get him.
[02:52:19.720 --> 02:52:35.720]  Oh, the little banshees roar, but do they think they've baited me?
[02:52:35.720 --> 02:52:40.040]  You see, I think I'm following a little bit more advanced augura than you, my friends.
[02:52:40.040 --> 02:52:42.480]  See, I'm not a Satanist.
[02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:48.960]  I'm not a little worldly pimp of the establishment I'm self-made, and I don't care about myself
[02:52:48.960 --> 02:52:51.240]  in the final equation.
[02:52:51.240 --> 02:52:54.920]  I care about bringing you down, and down you'll be brought.
[02:52:54.920 --> 02:52:57.200]  We still got a lot of phone lines.
[02:52:57.200 --> 02:53:00.600]  The great Paul Watts is lined up and ready to take over.
[02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:05.080]  And we're in treacherous waters, and I would like this operation to continue.
[02:53:05.080 --> 02:53:09.000]  So I'm going to leave it this ago to your phone calls, infowarstore.com, storewife50%
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:14.840]  off, double-patriot points, and, ladies and gentlemen, free shipping.
[02:53:14.840 --> 02:53:17.320]  And we don't make a lot of money off each order, but a lot of times we get a ton of
[02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:20.880]  orders, and it funds things, and I'm kind of stuck in this canard because you guys love
[02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:21.880]  big discounts.
[02:53:21.880 --> 02:53:22.880]  So there it is.
[02:53:22.880 --> 02:53:27.600]  I've launched other things like subscribestarter.com, Fortress Less Alex Jones, we get subscribed
[02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:31.800]  through a third-party system that's known for not censoring $5, $20 a month and did
[02:53:31.800 --> 02:53:36.080]  not worry about it, cancel any time to help fund our operations because we're having to
[02:53:36.080 --> 02:53:38.240]  expand out because of all the attacks.
[02:53:38.240 --> 02:53:41.280]  Obviously, we need major funding, so thank you all.
[02:53:41.280 --> 02:53:44.680]  Infowarstore.com is the key place to go.
[02:53:44.680 --> 02:53:51.080]  Big sales going right now, but this is the SOS, and we are just, you know, there's a
[02:53:51.080 --> 02:53:54.120]  certain thrill when you're in the middle of a fight, so I'll be honest, I'm thrilled
[02:53:54.120 --> 02:53:57.120]  right now.
[02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:02.320]  It'll get your eyes focused, get everything a little frosty, a little crispy, a little
[02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:03.960]  sparkly, you know?
[02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:12.600]  But I can tell when the wings of the Valkyries and the wings of the devil are all a little
[02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:18.280]  bit windy, a little bit, a little bit eyesore on, focused on us, oh, yes, right down on
[02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:23.680]  us, and that's good because while I'm getting torn limb from limb, and we need to extend
[02:54:23.680 --> 02:54:28.640]  this out as long as possible, the enemies being held up by me, they think it's the other
[02:54:28.640 --> 02:54:31.760]  way around, and by you.
[02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:35.560]  And so we're on the front line, we're the tip of the spear, I'm your probe that you're
[02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:40.020]  sending into the enemy area, and I'm getting key data back, and I've had a lot of victories
[02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:45.520]  thanks to you, and I just want to keep churning data out, churning data out as I melt into
[02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:48.800]  the surrounding territory.
[02:54:48.800 --> 02:54:54.960]  And just, I want to be that fulcrum, I want to be a fulcrum and an example to others like
[02:54:54.960 --> 02:55:00.680]  Colonel Travis, I'm going all the way, committed, smiling right into the face of death, a pure
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:04.520]  Americana, and saluting you all no matter where you live or where you're from, if you love
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:08.600]  freedom, we're brothers and sisters in this epic fight, and nothing good comes without
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:13.520]  cost, and this is an amazing time to be alive, so all their false victories come from systems
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:18.440]  of fraud, and it's their own defeats, their courts that say kill babies, their systems
[02:55:18.440 --> 02:55:23.200]  that do all this, it's all alive, and we're going to win.
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:28.720]  Okay, let's take it on their call, who's been holding the longest here?
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:32.320]  Kenyon in Ohio, thank you for holding, you're a real trooper, thank you, go ahead.
[02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:39.640]  Yeah, I would just like to talk about the timing of these power grids and this electronic
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:44.560]  espionage, right at the time that antitrust lawsuits are going on, I don't think that
[02:55:44.560 --> 02:55:49.240]  it's coincidence, I think because of the fact that these agencies act as a segue for
[02:55:49.240 --> 02:55:53.400]  these government agencies, these intergovernment agencies to commit, I mean, the tech industry
[02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:58.840]  has brought with espionage, it has been for the last 20 years, and when they start to
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:02.400]  investigate for these antitrust lawsuits, what they're going to uncover is not just the racketeering
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:05.840]  you've been talking about, I think it's the fact that you had that segment on Benny was
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:09.400]  really good, because it played right into what I was going to say, they're using these
[02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:13.440]  agencies to play governments against each other, to play their citizens off against
[02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:17.760]  one another, to use these big tech systems, and you know they're involved in it, they're
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:22.160]  involved in espionage all across the board, and if antitrust lawsuits start to lead into
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:27.080]  the other litigations, they're going to find out it's going to open the whole canard, it's
[02:56:27.080 --> 02:56:30.600]  going to erupt, because they're going to show how you've been talking for years how big
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:35.720]  government, and this, you know, the use of these tech companies to instill global governance
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:36.720]  over us.
[02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:39.880]  And that's their own words, you know, when I had dinner with William Benny, and we were
[02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:46.240]  followed, and people got, I mean, like real NSA type security guys came in, like sat down
[02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:49.440]  near us and were listening to our every word, and of course Benny knew it, he didn't tell
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:54.840]  me anything secret, but that guy knows the big secrets, he was the real head of the NSA,
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:58.960]  he created all this, and he'll tell you, he didn't like to talk about on air, he doesn't
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:04.560]  like to look like a victim, but they poisoned him the day he secretly testified to the Senate,
[02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:09.720]  and almost killed him, his legs basically fell off, he was in good shape, almost, but
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:13.760]  he was tough, tough liver, tough guy, man, if you know him in person, you can tell us
[02:57:13.760 --> 02:57:19.080]  the tough guy, and reportedly the poison they gave him would have killed ten men, didn't
[02:57:19.080 --> 02:57:24.640]  kill him, so hey, I've been poisoned one time, it wasn't that bad, it was arsenic, but I got
[02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:28.320]  over it, that was like 20 years ago, I learned to not leave drinks out of events, I was at,
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:32.640]  but he got poisoned with something far worse, and he lived through it, so he's a real hero,
[02:57:32.640 --> 02:57:36.200]  and I think about heroes, man, I admire it, somebody like William Benny, that's a real
[02:57:36.200 --> 02:57:41.000]  tough guy right there, he's got a brain right up there in lights, he'll be right back with
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:45.880]  more of your calls, stay with us.

[02:58:48.000 --> 02:59:05.440]  Like in New Jersey, you're on the air, thanks for calling Mike.
[02:59:05.440 --> 02:59:28.120]  Thank you so much for that as well.
[02:59:28.120 --> 02:59:31.240]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products to keep me from the air, I'm thanking
[02:59:31.240 --> 02:59:36.520]  you, but yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,

[02:59:39.880 --> 02:59:49.800]  I feel great since I've been taking it, thank you.
[02:59:49.800 --> 03:00:09.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:16.200]  This is it boys, toe-to-toe to globalists, I love it, I can't help it, it's a great
[03:00:16.200 --> 03:00:21.000]  feature, because there's pedophiles of devil worshipers, no, we're breathing down their
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:24.720]  throats, breathing down them.
[03:00:24.720 --> 03:00:30.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, is it time for me to shave my head, I'm not doing a
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:36.280]  come over, I got some hair on top, but it's, look at this, not like Trump though, I guess
[03:00:36.280 --> 03:00:41.400]  he's got the big thing going on there, I don't know, so I'm taking your phone calls
[03:00:41.400 --> 03:00:50.400]  here, a little bit serious, Paul Watson's taking over.
[03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:53.760]  You guys realize they're now writing articles, I just lost a lawsuit for a book I didn't
[03:00:53.760 --> 03:00:57.480]  write that I'm not in a lawsuit, and it's all over the news, it's top story on Twitter,
[03:00:57.480 --> 03:01:01.040]  because earlier they thought, oh, it's just the top Alex Jones search, no, I was shown
[03:01:01.040 --> 03:01:08.280]  earlier, it's in the top trending, I lost the lawsuit on Sandy Hook, and then they're
[03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:13.160]  going to announce that the judge is going to call for my arrest, I just heard that earlier.
[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:18.280]  Boy, they didn't like me putting out a bounty for whoever tried to plant that child porn
[03:01:18.280 --> 03:01:24.440]  on us, that really scared the old folks there at Scullin' Bones, didn't it, that got the
[03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:31.480]  dire here running down their legs, Santa Ana told Travis, yo, we're going to kill everybody
[03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:36.680]  of you, don't give us quarter and give up, and he said, well, no quarter given, none
[03:01:36.680 --> 03:01:45.960]  taken, victory or death, and you know what that means, don't you?
[03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:54.720]  Victory or death, death, death isn't the power of the devil, death is the power of the living,
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:02:01.760]  we control death and life, the devil pretends he controls death, we control death, I love
[03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:08.200]  that and Lord of the Rings, a Christian allegory written by J. R. R. Tolkien, which you then
[03:02:08.200 --> 03:02:12.920]  see in the movie out of the book, when they're there at the white city, they're fighting
[03:02:12.920 --> 03:02:17.720]  the big ringwraith king, the witch king, and all the rest of it, and the Norsemen show
[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:24.760]  up as the dooshecks at the moment that they're about to be defeated, and what is their cry?
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:34.160]  Death with their swords, death, death, charging their swords up with death, not a threat physically
[03:02:34.160 --> 03:02:40.480]  but death to your system, death, death is ours, we wield death, the living have strength,
[03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:48.840]  not the dead, death, and then pledging yourself to death if you need to, giving yourself up
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:55.080]  for others, it's the evil, the devil worshipers that fear death, not us, that's why they
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:59.320]  try to act like they own death and they have death and they're in charge, no you're not
[03:02:59.320 --> 03:03:04.320]  in charge of death, it's us the living that have children, and to have a child is to know
[03:03:04.320 --> 03:03:10.040]  they're going to die someday, to give life is to give death, and to fight evil is to
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:15.800]  give life and to give death, we bring life, we bring death, we are men, we are women,
[03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:22.000]  we are the humans, we are the planet, we are God's creation, we are the future, not you,
[03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:29.360]  so you fear death, we do not fear death, try to see if you can find it on YouTube, Lord
[03:03:29.360 --> 03:03:41.880]  of the Rings, death, death chant, that's powerful, there's nothing more living than that, there's
[03:03:41.880 --> 03:03:49.720]  nothing more pro-life than men saying we're ready to die for life, and then holding up
[03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:57.880]  your sword and chanting death, committed to death for life, committed to go all the way,
[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:09.280]  death, death, death, death, we don't fear death, our soul is eternal with Christ, Christ has
[03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:18.360]  the keys to hell and death, we have the keys to hell and death, we have the real power,
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:24.600]  the real ownership of the planet, we have the real providence, we have been given the
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:31.200]  authority, we have the contract, we have the name, we have the will, we have the genetics,
[03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:38.160]  we have the history, we rule the planet, not Satan, and Satan is about to be evicted because
[03:04:38.160 --> 03:04:54.600]  we hold the keys through Christ to hell and death, death, death.
[03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:59.360]  Info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[03:04:59.360 --> 03:05:06.160]  the last year or so, it's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane, and I keep
[03:05:06.160 --> 03:05:12.240]  trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to stumble up on deck as the captain
[03:05:12.240 --> 03:05:17.720]  of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking, I've begged for your support before and thanks
[03:05:17.720 --> 03:05:21.880]  for keeping us afloat, but this is the real SOS, if you don't buy a bunch of products
[03:05:21.880 --> 03:05:27.240]  and spread the word and keep fighting, info wars will be shut down, not just cripple.
[03:05:27.240 --> 03:05:30.920]  And so we've reached that point, it'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we
[03:05:30.920 --> 03:05:35.480]  have withstood so many of their attacks, we've gone through so much because of your support,
[03:05:35.480 --> 03:05:40.200]  you have been there, but let me tell you, they are pissed, they haven't been successful,
[03:05:40.200 --> 03:05:44.480]  and they're giving us their full assault, so we need your prayers, your financial support
[03:05:44.480 --> 03:05:47.760]  and your word of mouth now at infowarscore.com.
[03:05:47.760 --> 03:05:51.960]  It's your fight, decide whether or not you want info wars to continue because we could
[03:05:51.960 --> 03:06:12.400]  be shut down.
[03:06:12.400 --> 03:06:16.600]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:16.600 --> 03:06:23.600]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:06:23.600 --> 03:06:40.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide, a few more calls and Paul Watson
[03:06:40.680 --> 03:06:49.360]  is taking over real fast and I apologize, I got to hurry these up RJ you're on the air
[03:06:49.360 --> 03:06:50.360]  from New Jersey.
[03:06:50.360 --> 03:06:51.360]  Thanks for holding.
[03:06:51.360 --> 03:06:52.360]  Go ahead.
[03:06:52.360 --> 03:06:55.360]  I just want to say real quick, I spent about $4,500 with the use since October.
[03:06:55.360 --> 03:06:56.360]  Thank you.
[03:06:56.360 --> 03:07:01.760]  The X2 Secret 12 every day, the coffee is amazing, Turbo Force is amazing, the bars are literally
[03:07:01.760 --> 03:07:08.480]  candy bars that are good for you, the t-shirts are super quality, but even though I've spent
[03:07:08.480 --> 03:07:14.120]  this much since when I want to get to, I still am paycheck to paycheck, I can't necessarily
[03:07:14.120 --> 03:07:20.640]  afford a monthly product purchase like every month, and I buy a lot of it and bulk to save
[03:07:20.640 --> 03:07:25.480]  as much as I can, so I can't necessarily spend that much every month, but I could afford
[03:07:25.480 --> 03:07:33.640]  $3.99 or $4.99 or $5.99 monthly subscription to something, but I would want to get something
[03:07:33.640 --> 03:07:40.320]  like to prove that when I look back, this is really the fight for like of our time.
[03:07:40.320 --> 03:07:45.320]  No, you're right, we should have a weekly podcast that's only for subscribers, that's
[03:07:45.320 --> 03:07:50.840]  on key analysis and things, so people want to support us, get that weekly special say
[03:07:50.840 --> 03:07:55.200]  podcast subscription or something, that people really need that, we need to do that absolutely,
[03:07:55.200 --> 03:07:57.160]  in fact that's a great idea.
[03:07:57.160 --> 03:08:01.120]  I have an even cheaper and easier idea for you that makes even more money.
[03:08:01.120 --> 03:08:02.120]  Tell me.
[03:08:02.120 --> 03:08:08.520]  I have a bad, a monthly bad, a campaign bad, I had my skin in the game, they cost 50 cents
[03:08:08.520 --> 03:08:14.000]  to make in bulk for two inch bads, and you could have just the failing event of the month
[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:15.000]  like the coming...
[03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:18.360]  Sure, we could spend a dollar and have a nicer tote bag or something that has a message
[03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:21.920]  on it, and then people get those every month, and then you can kind of leave them at grocery
[03:08:21.920 --> 03:08:26.400]  stores, nobody, the average leftist won't know what newswars.com is, so everybody gets
[03:08:26.400 --> 03:08:30.720]  like a monthly subscription tote bag that comes, and then you use some, give away others,
[03:08:30.720 --> 03:08:32.920]  that is a genius idea.
[03:08:32.920 --> 03:08:39.240]  Yeah, and just $4.99 for one bag each month, just of a different thing that I could, and
[03:08:39.240 --> 03:08:44.240]  then you could sell like a bomber jacket or a vest for a $50 markup, and the aim here,
[03:08:44.240 --> 03:08:47.840]  let me just make the aim before you, because I know I get cut off once you start...
[03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:50.840]  No, no, brother.
[03:08:50.840 --> 03:08:57.760]  You do one of these 72-hour broadcasts for a month, for a telephone, until you've got
[03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:03.040]  a million subscribers, Patriots, Vanguard subscribers, that if you...
[03:09:03.040 --> 03:09:04.040]  No, you're right, that's how you do it.
[03:09:04.040 --> 03:09:05.040]  You make it a big deal.
[03:09:05.040 --> 03:09:07.520]  I've noticed how the new internet works, I'm kind of behind the curve.
[03:09:07.520 --> 03:09:11.480]  You just hype it all the time about your subscribers, call them out, have them on.
[03:09:11.480 --> 03:09:14.880]  That's what we've got to do to crush this, because they're trying to have me arrested
[03:09:14.880 --> 03:09:15.880]  now.
[03:09:15.880 --> 03:09:16.880]  I mean, it is...
[03:09:16.880 --> 03:09:20.440]  Can you believe they're saying, I lost the Sandy Hook suits for a book I wrote?
[03:09:20.440 --> 03:09:21.440]  None of that's even true.
[03:09:21.440 --> 03:09:23.640]  I didn't write a book, didn't lose a suit.
[03:09:23.640 --> 03:09:26.440]  I mean, they've gone completely cuckoo, man.
[03:09:26.440 --> 03:09:33.840]  I just read that you lost a suit to my family and that you owe me money, so pay up.
[03:09:33.840 --> 03:09:36.320]  This is ridiculous what they're doing to you.
[03:09:36.320 --> 03:09:37.680]  I don't even know what to do at this point.
[03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:39.400]  I don't feel sorry for myself.
[03:09:39.400 --> 03:09:44.080]  Actually it's like, they think Americans are so dumb that they're saying, I'm sending
[03:09:44.080 --> 03:09:48.680]  child porn when I'm not, and then I lost a lawsuit, and now they've got a judge convinced
[03:09:48.680 --> 03:09:51.120]  who says she's going to have me arrested.
[03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:52.120]  That's what the word is.
[03:09:52.120 --> 03:09:56.440]  This is entering cuckoo land, total cuckoo land.
[03:09:56.440 --> 03:10:00.040]  So whatever, man, I'm being abused by the system because I'm a patriot.
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:01.040]  Great points.
[03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:02.040]  RJ, you're a genius.
[03:10:02.040 --> 03:10:05.560]  Yeah, because a lot of grocery stores around the country, plus it's smart to do.
[03:10:05.560 --> 03:10:09.600]  I mean, I'm not into a lot of fake environmental stuff, but I do organic farming and not having
[03:10:09.600 --> 03:10:13.680]  toxic waste or overfishing, all the reasonable conservation stuff.
[03:10:13.680 --> 03:10:16.840]  And even when I go to grocery stores that try to not have you do it, I try to bring
[03:10:16.840 --> 03:10:21.400]  my own six or seven bags, but it's usually got some commie crap on it or you buy them
[03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:22.560]  at the store.
[03:10:22.560 --> 03:10:28.000]  What about nicely made, but cheap and inexpensive bags with info wars will probably get you
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:29.000]  attacked in some areas.
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.480]  So maybe a news wars.com or maybe whatever.
[03:10:31.480 --> 03:10:35.120]  And then you kind of have extra bags, leave them places.
[03:10:35.120 --> 03:10:36.320]  People are going to use them.
[03:10:36.320 --> 03:10:38.320]  It's a walking billboard.
[03:10:38.320 --> 03:10:41.640]  We're going to, well, other folks are launching some other sites soon.
[03:10:41.640 --> 03:10:44.120]  We're very excited about that.
[03:10:44.120 --> 03:10:46.840]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[03:10:46.840 --> 03:10:48.240]  Let's talk to Leah in Illinois.
[03:10:48.240 --> 03:10:53.680]  Leah, you've been a real trooper holding, go ahead, Hi, Alex, thanks for taking my
[03:10:53.680 --> 03:10:54.680]  call.
[03:10:54.680 --> 03:10:55.680]  Thank you.
[03:10:55.680 --> 03:10:58.920]  I wanted to talk about the border.
[03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:04.040]  I voted for Trump and he makes me so mad.
[03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:09.400]  You know, I could just scream all the time, you know, here on what he's doing.
[03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:17.360]  Now, what I want to say is I'm starting to think that Trump is a Trojan horse.
[03:11:17.360 --> 03:11:22.720]  And the reason I say that Obama destroyed this country, he took a lot of our freedoms
[03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:25.760]  away and just destroyed it.
[03:11:25.760 --> 03:11:26.760]  Okay.
[03:11:26.760 --> 03:11:32.560]  The president is put in office for, first of all, to protect the nation.
[03:11:32.560 --> 03:11:39.720]  Then, you know, economic is very important, but Trump only cares about the economics.
[03:11:39.720 --> 03:11:43.400]  We did not hire Trump for economic growth.
[03:11:43.400 --> 03:11:47.960]  We hired him to protect this country and to protect our rights.
[03:11:47.960 --> 03:11:49.800]  Our First Amendment's gone.
[03:11:49.800 --> 03:11:52.200]  Our second is almost gone.
[03:11:52.200 --> 03:11:55.560]  Our religious rights are gone and they're going.
[03:11:55.560 --> 03:12:02.520]  Now, you tell me, the most important thing going in this nation that is going to be taken
[03:12:02.520 --> 03:12:06.880]  away from us, he's not doing nothing.
[03:12:06.880 --> 03:12:10.000]  Oh, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, I think you're legitimate on the free speech.
[03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:13.640]  He's starting to do something with the colleges, he's done a little bit, not enough.
[03:12:13.640 --> 03:12:17.800]  The 5G is really bad, but standing up to China's 5G is really good.
[03:12:17.800 --> 03:12:21.000]  He says he's going to try to deport millions starting next week.
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:22.520]  You understand he's not a dictator.
[03:12:22.520 --> 03:12:24.520]  He didn't get the funding from Congress.
[03:12:24.520 --> 03:12:26.040]  He asked for 12 plus billion.
[03:12:26.040 --> 03:12:32.120]  He got 1.3 billion, or was it 1.5, I forget, the point is he got a pittance.
[03:12:32.120 --> 03:12:36.880]  He doesn't have, he's always going to declare a real emergency and the basically the Insurrection
[03:12:36.880 --> 03:12:39.080]  Act and do something on that front.
[03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:42.760]  So the Democrats and the globalists rushed Europe six years ago.
[03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:46.960]  They rushed us once Trump got in to make him look weak on the border.
[03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:50.600]  So just like the border patrol is overwhelmed, Trump is overwhelmed.
[03:12:50.600 --> 03:12:54.840]  So I don't think that area that Ann Coulter and others have been attacking him on and
[03:12:54.840 --> 03:12:57.480]  also saw Michael Savage, who I respect attacking there.
[03:12:57.480 --> 03:13:02.720]  I just imagine Hillary, Trump has mutiny and insurrection going on with people not doing
[03:13:02.720 --> 03:13:05.080]  what he says.
[03:13:05.080 --> 03:13:09.680]  When he came out though and said we might try to restrict silencers or suppressors,
[03:13:09.680 --> 03:13:11.400]  those are barely used in crime.
[03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:12.560]  It's a slippery slope.
[03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:15.080]  That is a lie in the sand.
[03:13:15.080 --> 03:13:18.440]  But ma'am, look at the media attacking him.
[03:13:18.440 --> 03:13:20.320]  Look at the lawsuits against him.
[03:13:20.320 --> 03:13:21.720]  Look at the attacks.
[03:13:21.720 --> 03:13:27.400]  They were not, when we got Trump elected, when you got Trump elected, they went ape.
[03:13:27.400 --> 03:13:31.000]  So let me tell you, they're legitimately pissed, okay?
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:38.320]  Yes, I agree with that, but my question, Alex, to you, you know more about the Posse
[03:13:38.320 --> 03:13:39.820]  Comitatus.
[03:13:39.820 --> 03:13:42.920]  Why can't he not take all of our military?
[03:13:42.920 --> 03:13:43.920]  We got him hanging out.
[03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:48.080]  Well ma'am, Posse Comitatus is against U.S. citizens and then you can't do it.
[03:13:48.080 --> 03:13:53.120]  I am 100% for full militarization of the borders because this country is under globalist attack.
[03:13:53.120 --> 03:13:56.280]  That is constitutional and I support it 110%.
[03:13:56.280 --> 03:13:57.280]  I appreciate your call.
[03:13:57.280 --> 03:13:58.640]  I understand your frustration.
[03:13:58.640 --> 03:14:00.280]  He's not a dictator, ma'am.
[03:14:00.280 --> 03:14:01.280]  He's surrounded.
[03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:03.120]  They're trying to start a war with Russia.
[03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:04.120]  They're trying to false flag.
[03:14:04.120 --> 03:14:05.560]  Can you imagine Trump's job?
[03:14:05.560 --> 03:14:09.640]  He's up 18, 20 hours a day and he can't, and I'm just, I'm not second.
[03:14:09.640 --> 03:14:11.920]  I get on his butt when he says something out of his mouth.
[03:14:11.920 --> 03:14:12.920]  I know it's not true.
[03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:13.920]  And he doesn't.
[03:14:13.920 --> 03:14:19.440]  And I'll turn on him like a, like a feral, you know, dog.
[03:14:19.440 --> 03:14:22.800]  If he ever really crosses anybody, don't make any mistake about that.
[03:14:22.800 --> 03:14:25.000]  My role is not to trump it, it's to the truth.
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:26.480]  But let me tell you, he's for real.
[03:14:26.480 --> 03:14:27.480]  Doesn't mean he's perfect.
[03:14:27.480 --> 03:14:28.480]  He is.
[03:14:28.480 --> 03:14:31.160]  Look, I apologize to Andrew and Craig.
[03:14:31.160 --> 03:14:33.000]  They had great points to make, but we're out of time.
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:36.000]  Paul Wasam's got to take over, but Craig, real fast in Canada.
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  You've got a good point.
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:38.000]  Go ahead.
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:39.000]  Yes, sir.
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:40.000]  I'm with you.
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  You are.
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:42.000]  We got about a minute.
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:47.280]  Well, I believe what's happened to you is, uh, therefore us versus the state is that
[03:14:47.280 --> 03:14:53.320]  you've been, you've, uh, managed to become a, uh, a metaphysical messenger like Socrates
[03:14:53.320 --> 03:14:56.320]  and St. George that they were arrested for challenging hermetic state God.
[03:14:56.320 --> 03:15:01.600]  They're challenging their hermetic new mental alchemy state gods of climate change, anti,
[03:15:01.600 --> 03:15:08.640]  not being anti abortion or, or, or, and anti Christian is what I meant of their new mental
[03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:09.640]  alchemy bro.
[03:15:09.640 --> 03:15:10.800]  It's just, you're just like Socrates.
[03:15:10.800 --> 03:15:13.680]  They're going to, they're going to, we all got to stand together.
[03:15:13.680 --> 03:15:18.040]  Socrates, St. George, Alex, Jones, Christ, throw, throw them all in there, man.
[03:15:18.040 --> 03:15:19.040]  And I'm, I'm with the bus.
[03:15:19.040 --> 03:15:20.040]  I waited a long time.
[03:15:20.040 --> 03:15:21.040]  I'm with the bone broth.
[03:15:21.040 --> 03:15:22.040]  DNA force.
[03:15:22.040 --> 03:15:23.040]  Ultra 12 love you.
[03:15:23.040 --> 03:15:24.040]  Thank you.
[03:15:24.040 --> 03:15:25.040]  Well, sounds like you're on fire.
[03:15:25.040 --> 03:15:26.040]  Call me back.
[03:15:26.040 --> 03:15:27.040]  I took a bunch of Paul's time.
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:28.040]  And it's wrong.
[03:15:28.040 --> 03:15:29.040]  He's, he's ready to go.
[03:15:29.040 --> 03:15:30.040]  Whatever you do.
[03:15:30.040 --> 03:15:34.240]  Thank you for spreading the word and don't believe a damn thing they say about me because
[03:15:34.240 --> 03:15:37.360]  I can't wait to hear what Paul says when he gets to this.
[03:15:37.360 --> 03:15:43.960]  They are now saying I lost the Sandy Hook lawsuits for a book I wrote.
[03:15:43.960 --> 03:15:47.160]  And then the article, they say somebody else wrote the book and I wasn't sued.
[03:15:47.160 --> 03:15:48.640]  I've never seen lies this big.
[03:15:48.640 --> 03:15:52.000]  I don't even know what, what they're getting ready to do.
[03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:54.360]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.360 --> 03:15:58.280]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.

[03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:02.800]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:02.800 --> 03:16:06.040]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[03:16:06.040 --> 03:16:08.320]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[03:16:29.160 --> 03:16:32.160]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.160 --> 03:16:38.120]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.120 --> 03:16:41.920]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:41.920 --> 03:16:42.920]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:42.920 --> 03:16:44.480]  Who do we fight for?

[03:20:11.080 --> 03:20:18.640]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now,
[03:20:18.640 --> 03:20:21.080]  your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:21.080 --> 03:20:29.680]  Finally, our live support out of the Alex Jones show. Got some interesting information
[03:20:29.680 --> 03:20:34.080]  coming up, which I'll probably go to in the next segment. And I'm going to put out a video
[03:20:34.080 --> 03:20:40.600]  on this later today. We've featured before these role-playing games, things like Steve
[03:20:40.600 --> 03:20:46.760]  Jackson's The Illuminati, the game in the past, and how they were eerily prescient about
[03:20:46.760 --> 03:20:54.000]  predicting future events and future cultural trends decades in advance. And in fact, this
[03:20:54.000 --> 03:20:59.560]  segues into what's happening now, because there's a new video game coming out next
[03:20:59.560 --> 03:21:08.860]  year called Cyberpunk 2077 or Cyberpunk 2070, I think it's called. And it features Keanu
[03:21:08.860 --> 03:21:17.400]  Reeves as one of the characters in the game, Cyberpunk 2077. That's coming out next year.
[03:21:17.400 --> 03:21:21.840]  It's already getting a lot of press. The trailer for this video game has already been out for
[03:21:21.840 --> 03:21:28.640]  weeks, I think. And the woke progressive cult is not happy about it. And I think the reason
[03:21:28.640 --> 03:21:36.960]  they're not happy about it is because of what it's based on, which is Cyberpunk 2020. And
[03:21:36.960 --> 03:21:42.680]  again, I'm going to pull this into an email, a YouTube video, sorry, later on today, which
[03:21:42.680 --> 03:21:49.600]  was a 1988. So we're talking 31 years ago, tabletop role-playing game, the second version
[03:21:49.600 --> 03:21:58.120]  of which was set in a fictional 2020. Now, the main themes of this game pertain to futuristic
[03:21:58.120 --> 03:22:04.480]  weaponry, futuristic transport and transhumanism. As you see a glimpse of in this clip here,
[03:22:04.480 --> 03:22:11.600]  this is the video game that's coming out next year. But this tabletop game, this RPG from
[03:22:11.600 --> 03:22:17.960]  1988 was incredibly prescient, because it predicted many of the cultural trends that
[03:22:17.960 --> 03:22:24.400]  we're seeing today, one year before 2020. And this started going viral on Twitter a few
[03:22:24.400 --> 03:22:30.880]  days ago. So I kind of looked into the background of this and it revealed way more than anyone
[03:22:30.880 --> 03:22:38.320]  else found about it. So in the rulebook to this Cyberpunk 2020 RPG, the original was
[03:22:38.320 --> 03:22:45.640]  1988, they had an updated rulebook released in 1994. And this is what they predicted
[03:22:45.640 --> 03:22:52.280]  about what life and society would be like in 2020. Listen to this and understand that
[03:22:52.280 --> 03:23:00.040]  it was written nearly 30 years ago. The headline is diversity and unity. It says it is now
[03:23:00.040 --> 03:23:06.640]  accepted among historical scholars that in the decades before the collapse, America suffered
[03:23:06.640 --> 03:23:14.680]  from the sicknesses of racism and quote, cultural identity. Everyone wanted to be seen as special.
[03:23:14.680 --> 03:23:19.600]  Every group had to be equal or to be preferably better than its neighbors and fought to protect
[03:23:19.600 --> 03:23:24.680]  its special rights. If anyone had something that someone else wanted, they were painted
[03:23:24.680 --> 03:23:31.360]  as racist, sexist, elitist or worse. This divisive me first attitude eventually tore
[03:23:31.360 --> 03:23:37.600]  the fabric of American culture apart and caused it to self destruct in a fireball of competing
[03:23:37.600 --> 03:23:45.440]  ideologies, none of which truly recognized each other's validity. Diversity led inexorably
[03:23:45.440 --> 03:23:53.320]  to anarchy. That is from the 1994 rulebook to a game created in 1988, 30 years ago, Cyberpunk
[03:23:53.320 --> 03:24:01.960]  2020. Very prescient given our current obsession with identity politics, given the sanctification
[03:24:01.960 --> 03:24:09.720]  of victimhood status as some kind of special achievement that is being exploited to impose
[03:24:09.720 --> 03:24:14.760]  cultural and political hegemony. The most recent example, of course, which we saw with
[03:24:14.760 --> 03:24:21.720]  the attempted de-platforming of Steven Crowder last week, when a gay man, a self-professed
[03:24:21.720 --> 03:24:29.840]  queer wonk, according to his own Twitter handle, tried to exploit his identity politics to
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:35.800]  silence and censor Steven Crowder. They were talking about how diversity would be used
[03:24:35.800 --> 03:24:42.400]  to rip American culture apart 30 years ago in this game and how these competing ideologies
[03:24:42.400 --> 03:24:49.280]  of identity politics would again be used as a wedge issue to exert political and cultural
[03:24:49.280 --> 03:24:57.440]  hegemony. That was in the rulebook. That circulated on Twitter a few days ago. I read the entire
[03:24:57.440 --> 03:25:05.080]  skimmed through it, at least the entire 270 page rulebook from the Cyberpunk 2020 RPG game
[03:25:05.080 --> 03:25:12.080]  and it predicted a lot more aside from that. In fact, you could go back to the 1988 rulebook
[03:25:12.080 --> 03:25:19.160]  where it predicted, quote, a Great Britain swamped by mass immigration. These are quotes
[03:25:19.160 --> 03:25:26.480]  leading to streets almost explosively as dangerous as the United States. Now, it was last year
[03:25:26.480 --> 03:25:33.960]  that London overtook New York in terms of violent crime per capita. Of course, we've
[03:25:33.960 --> 03:25:40.960]  got soaring violent crime across the country up 19% in the UK. Police say they will no
[03:25:40.960 --> 03:25:46.000]  longer attend burglaries or breakings, but they're going to arrest people for mean tweets.
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:51.900]  You have knife crimes so bad in London. And in fact, someone was kicked to death literally
[03:25:51.900 --> 03:25:56.520]  five minutes from where I live last week. Three people were killed in the immediate
[03:25:56.520 --> 03:26:03.520]  area in which I live over the past two weeks. And now we have Somali immigrants who live
[03:26:03.520 --> 03:26:09.840]  in London who are being sent back to Somalia by their parents because it's safer than London.
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:19.840]  That's how bad it is in the United Kingdom. And this game predicted it 31 years ago. They
[03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:25.620]  also predicted the rise of the Me First worldview, again exemplified today by this exploding
[03:26:25.620 --> 03:26:31.920]  narcissism driven by social media addiction. They also foresaw a future, and this again
[03:26:31.920 --> 03:26:37.280]  is another quote, in which entertainment has become generic and a conglomeration of TV
[03:26:37.280 --> 03:26:41.560]  networks would emerge to deliver hundreds of channels that produce a product which is
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:48.440]  quote, bland, mindless, and caters to the lowest possible denominator. That kind of
[03:26:48.440 --> 03:26:54.520]  rings a bell too, doesn't it, with the degeneration of culture. They also predicted the decline
[03:26:54.520 --> 03:26:58.280]  of traditional media platforms. They said printed newspapers and magazines would fade
[03:26:58.280 --> 03:27:06.840]  into oblivion. That's happening has been for years. Now this cyberpunk 2020 game was derived
[03:27:06.840 --> 03:27:13.480]  from a 1986 sci-fi novel called Hardwired. And in both Hardwired and Cyberpunk, ruthless
[03:27:13.480 --> 03:27:19.480]  corporations have created vast monopolies, amassed more power than countries, and everyone
[03:27:19.480 --> 03:27:25.440]  is completely dependent on them. Listen to this quote from the 1988 rulebook. Quote,
[03:27:25.440 --> 03:27:31.240]  dissenting opinions and independent productions are usually buried under an avalanche of media
[03:27:31.240 --> 03:27:37.960]  hype or worse co-opted or destroyed by the vicious competitive practices of major media
[03:27:37.960 --> 03:27:46.400]  corpse. And what do we see today? We see major media corpse, conglomerating, monopolizing,
[03:27:46.400 --> 03:27:55.120]  and crushing dissenting opinions in the form of Facebook, Instagram, Mark Zuckerberg, etc.
[03:27:55.120 --> 03:28:00.240]  So all along the line, they got it bang on the money. And on that subject of dissenting
[03:28:00.240 --> 03:28:05.520]  opinions being silenced by people like Mark Zuckerberg, somebody tried to post this 1988
[03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:11.760]  rulebook on Reddit. Under the title, in the original Cyberpunk 2020 rulebook, diversity
[03:28:11.760 --> 03:28:17.800]  was the downfall of America. Now, of course, we don't live in an age where dissenting opinions
[03:28:17.800 --> 03:28:24.840]  are silenced by mega corpse, do we? Oh yeah, we do. The Reddit post was immediately removed.
[03:28:24.840 --> 03:28:31.000]  So it's actually quite amazing how prescient this RPG was. And it's about to be developed
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:39.440]  into a brand new video game starring Keanu Reeves. And the progressive woke cult is definitely
[03:28:39.440 --> 03:28:46.480]  not happy about it. And I'll finish up on that in the next segment about Cyberpunk 2020,
[03:28:46.480 --> 03:28:53.440]  an amazingly prescient game. This is the Alex Jones show live in 4Wars.com. We'll be back.
[03:28:53.440 --> 03:28:59.440]  This is the first time I've ever seen a video of a person with a heart disease.

[03:31:55.680 --> 03:32:03.200]  is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world history. This is a digital
[03:32:03.200 --> 03:32:16.000]  AI enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or info wars.com. This is Nazi
[03:32:16.000 --> 03:32:21.800]  Germany level. This is racketeering. This is cartels. Mr. President, we need your help.
[03:32:21.800 --> 03:32:28.480]  We need it now. You can take on big tech. They saw info wars as a dominant independent
[03:32:28.480 --> 03:32:35.200]  anti war pro human pro sovereign pro family populist organization. So they thought first
[03:32:35.200 --> 03:32:40.760]  they come for Alex Jones. Then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone
[03:32:40.760 --> 03:32:45.440]  else like dominoes would fall. The way to fight back is to support info wars now more
[03:32:45.440 --> 03:32:49.880]  than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech understand that they believe
[03:32:49.880 --> 03:32:57.280]  they can take us down. They'll take everybody else down.
[03:32:57.280 --> 03:33:22.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. So just to wrap up, I was talking about the
[03:33:22.800 --> 03:33:31.560]  eerily accurate predictions of cyberpunk 2020 1988 tabletop RPG that predicted identity
[03:33:31.560 --> 03:33:37.760]  politics and diversity would be the downfall of America. The creators of this game must
[03:33:37.760 --> 03:33:42.520]  have been pretty racist, right? I mean, come on. We know diversity is a strength after
[03:33:42.520 --> 03:33:48.240]  all. Yeah, it was created by Mike Pondsmith, a black guy. So try harder with that one.
[03:33:48.240 --> 03:33:53.920]  But the woke progressive cult is very upset about it because it's about to be made into
[03:33:53.920 --> 03:34:01.340]  a new video game and updated version cyberpunk 2077 starring Keanu Reeves is one of the characters
[03:34:01.340 --> 03:34:08.400]  in the video game. And in this game, based on the original, we have transhumanism, we
[03:34:08.400 --> 03:34:14.880]  have augmentation of the body with cyber technology. Now in the game, the characters that take
[03:34:14.880 --> 03:34:21.560]  on this cyber technology that implant microchips into their bodies, etc. They have an ensuing
[03:34:21.560 --> 03:34:29.000]  loss of humanity. They become more synthetic, more robotic. And there's a task in the video
[03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:36.000]  game where they have to rescue a naked woman in a bathtub. But they're kind of disgusted
[03:34:36.000 --> 03:34:42.720]  by her because she's so augmented with cyber technology that she's kind of more cyborg
[03:34:42.720 --> 03:34:47.880]  than human at that point. And so they make this point in the video game, even though
[03:34:47.880 --> 03:34:54.160]  they rescue the woman that they're quite disgusted to the extent that she's been cyber augmented.
[03:34:54.160 --> 03:34:59.640]  And of course, the leftist, the progressives that hijacked the video game industry, which
[03:34:59.640 --> 03:35:05.120]  is what the gamergate controversy was all about, are not very happy about it. And in
[03:35:05.120 --> 03:35:10.760]  fact, in the video, which I'm going to post after I get off the show here, I'm going to
[03:35:10.760 --> 03:35:15.520]  highlight the people who are complaining about it. But this game is going to get some heat.
[03:35:15.520 --> 03:35:20.400]  I can bet that when it comes out, it doesn't even come out until April next year, that
[03:35:20.400 --> 03:35:26.600]  it's going to get some heat. Because if it remains true to the dystopian world depicted
[03:35:26.600 --> 03:35:32.400]  by its original creators, the cultural thought police are going to come after it. Because
[03:35:32.400 --> 03:35:39.200]  again, it was eerily prescient in predicting the identity politics and diversity, as well
[03:35:39.200 --> 03:35:44.600]  as transhumanism and our obsession with technology would be the downfall of society. So look
[03:35:44.600 --> 03:35:51.920]  out for that video after I get off the show here about Cyberpunk 2020. Now, speaking of
[03:35:51.920 --> 03:35:58.760]  videos, I put out a video a couple of days ago called Modernity. And it was about basically
[03:35:58.760 --> 03:36:04.240]  how many gay people are not fans of gay pride parades. In fact, we had a story the other
[03:36:04.240 --> 03:36:13.600]  day upon Summit.News, video showing child twerking at gay pride parade causes outrage.
[03:36:13.600 --> 03:36:19.240]  This was a video of a kid who can be no older than about 10, he's probably about eight or
[03:36:19.240 --> 03:36:26.600]  nine, twerking, thrusting his hips back and forward, squatting, shaking his buttocks.
[03:36:26.600 --> 03:36:31.680]  You all know the dance. It went viral on Twitter, got over a million views. And we've had so
[03:36:31.680 --> 03:36:39.040]  much of this news over the past few days. We had this also on Friday. Desmond is amazing's
[03:36:39.040 --> 03:36:44.760]  mother defends decision to allow 12 year old drag kid to perform at gay bar for tips. She
[03:36:44.760 --> 03:36:49.920]  actually went on Australian television, the mother of this poor child who is a victim,
[03:36:49.920 --> 03:36:55.880]  he can feel nothing but sympathy for him and defended the fact that they made him perform
[03:36:55.880 --> 03:37:01.660]  at a gay nightclub for tips with men throwing money at him by saying she doesn't know what
[03:37:01.660 --> 03:37:07.760]  the controversy was about. I mean, who could even think there would be a controversy about
[03:37:07.760 --> 03:37:12.120]  allowing a 12 year old boy to perform in a gay club while men threw money at him? There's
[03:37:12.120 --> 03:37:17.760]  nothing controversial about that. Only in a completely degenerate society is there nothing
[03:37:17.760 --> 03:37:24.000]  controversial about that. Of course, we've got drag queen story times, which Desmond
[03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:30.560]  is amazing has been involved in across the country now increasing and going global. Even
[03:37:30.560 --> 03:37:36.960]  after it turned out that 32 year old Albert Garza, who was involved in drag queen story
[03:37:36.960 --> 03:37:43.360]  time was a registered sex offender convicted of assaulting an eight year old boy in 2008.
[03:37:43.360 --> 03:37:48.520]  In fact, we were on the forefront of revealing that when it happened a couple of months ago,
[03:37:48.520 --> 03:37:55.680]  I think it was. So you've got his mother going on television saying that it's not controversial
[03:37:55.680 --> 03:38:00.600]  to make a 12 year old boy dance around on stage a gay nightclub while men throw money
[03:38:00.600 --> 03:38:06.440]  at him. That's perfectly normal if you live in a sick society. We have this story out
[03:38:06.440 --> 03:38:10.920]  of Brazil, which is absolutely horrific. And it only gets worse the more you learn about
[03:38:10.920 --> 03:38:18.780]  it. So there was a lesbian couple in Brazil that basically kidnapped their son, ran away
[03:38:18.780 --> 03:38:24.680]  with him, the father had lost custody, but they just ran away with him and tried to perform
[03:38:24.680 --> 03:38:34.360]  a forced gender reassignment surgery on a poor nine year old boy. Now, if there are children
[03:38:34.360 --> 03:38:41.700]  listening, it's probably time to shut this off because this is absolutely horrific.
[03:38:41.700 --> 03:38:45.560]  Gasly new details have emerged about the tragic case of the Brazilian boy who was subjected
[03:38:45.560 --> 03:38:52.640]  to forced gender reassignment surgery by a lesbian couple who later beheaded him. And
[03:38:52.640 --> 03:39:00.720]  this gets into the fact that it's a statistical reality that adopted children who are adopted
[03:39:00.720 --> 03:39:07.360]  by gay and lesbian parents across the world are more likely to be abused. It's just a
[03:39:07.360 --> 03:39:11.920]  fact. I'm sorry. It's one of those hate facts that if you actually tweeted that you get
[03:39:11.920 --> 03:39:16.880]  banned on Twitter, but I'm going to say it right now, it is a fact that children who
[03:39:16.880 --> 03:39:23.200]  are adopted by gay couples are way more likely to be abused. In fact, in some countries I
[03:39:23.200 --> 03:39:28.080]  learned that in Italy, it's completely banned. But it's being allowed more and more in many
[03:39:28.080 --> 03:39:33.560]  other countries. And again, that's not to say all gay couples abuse children. In fact,
[03:39:33.560 --> 03:39:41.680]  someone posted a statistic or sent it to me on a DM on Twitter claiming that 92% of gay
[03:39:41.680 --> 03:39:47.320]  couples abuse children when they had custody of them, which is again, that's obviously
[03:39:47.320 --> 03:39:54.800]  incorrect. But it's true that they are statistically overrepresented in the abuse of children when
[03:39:54.800 --> 03:39:59.760]  they adopt children. And this is the most brutal extreme example of abuse that you could
[03:39:59.760 --> 03:40:06.720]  ever imagine. Nine year old Ruan Maycom was murdered by his mother, Rosano de Silva Candido
[03:40:06.720 --> 03:40:14.160]  and her partner, lesbian partner, Cassila Damasquino on May 31. Now I knew that they'd
[03:40:14.160 --> 03:40:18.280]  murdered him. I knew that they'd stabbed him to death. I knew that they tried to perform
[03:40:18.280 --> 03:40:24.440]  a gender reassignment operation. But then yesterday I found out the full details because
[03:40:24.440 --> 03:40:29.800]  they confessed to it after a few days. They were on the run from the police. They told
[03:40:29.800 --> 03:40:35.560]  the police what they'd done. So the mother of this child decided that the child wanted
[03:40:35.560 --> 03:40:41.120]  to become a girl again, imposing her warped identity politics on the child. They ripped
[03:40:41.120 --> 03:40:47.240]  off the boy's penis. And bear in mind this poor kid survived for about a year after all
[03:40:47.240 --> 03:40:53.480]  this before they basically put him out of his misery. They ripped off the boy's penis
[03:40:53.480 --> 03:40:59.280]  and sold on a fake female sex organ. Because again, he wanted to be a girl according to
[03:40:59.280 --> 03:41:07.320]  them. They scraped the boy's skin off his face. Now he survived after this botched macabre
[03:41:07.320 --> 03:41:14.240]  operation, this doctor Mengele style operation for about a year. And in the end, they just,
[03:41:14.240 --> 03:41:20.920]  they tried to gouge his eyes out with a knife. The reason given by this mother was because
[03:41:20.920 --> 03:41:28.600]  he reminded her of her father who allegedly abused her. Absolutely horrific. Again, going
[03:41:28.600 --> 03:41:33.800]  to the point that the abuse of children only leads to more abuse generations later on down
[03:41:33.800 --> 03:41:39.840]  the line, which is not to excuse what she did because it was absolutely horrific. Candido
[03:41:39.840 --> 03:41:45.000]  said she felt hatred and no love for the boy because he was quote a burden and a hindrance
[03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:53.280]  to her lesbian relationship. They tried to burn his body on a barbecue. And when that
[03:41:53.280 --> 03:42:01.440]  failed, hastily stuffed his remains in a suitcase and dumped them in a sewer. Now the father
[03:42:01.440 --> 03:42:05.520]  had been trying to warn about what they were going to do to him after they'd already performed
[03:42:05.520 --> 03:42:11.160]  this botched gender reassignment surgery a year before he tried to warn people on social
[03:42:11.160 --> 03:42:15.400]  media. He tried to get custody back. He tried to warn the authorities nothing happened until
[03:42:15.400 --> 03:42:20.360]  they literally stabbed him a dozen times, tried to gouge his eyes out. This is what
[03:42:20.360 --> 03:42:26.680]  the police chief said in this area of Brazil. Quote, she killed her son, quartered, decapitated,
[03:42:26.680 --> 03:42:32.120]  plucked to the skin and tried to get rid of the body. It was a very terrible case. Yeah.
[03:42:32.120 --> 03:42:37.360]  Understatement of the century. So you're only going to see more of this. There are literally
[03:42:37.360 --> 03:42:42.560]  10 times the amount of gender reassignment operations going on against children in the
[03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:47.920]  United Kingdom by these warped parents who are trying to impose their warped ideology.
[03:42:47.920 --> 03:42:54.520]  It's absolutely brutal. It has to stop. We'll be back info wars.com info wars and free
[03:42:54.520 --> 03:43:00.240]  speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so. It's
[03:43:00.240 --> 03:43:05.160]  it's it's Orwellian. It's it's biblical. It's it's authoritarian. It's insane. And I keep
[03:43:05.160 --> 03:43:10.840]  trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the
[03:43:10.840 --> 03:43:16.440]  captain of this operation and say, Hey, we're sinking. I've begged for your support before
[03:43:16.440 --> 03:43:20.040]  and thanks for keeping us afloat. But this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch

[03:43:26.240 --> 03:43:29.800]  And so we've reached that point. It'll make the enemy happy. But you know, whatever, we

[03:46:01.120 --> 03:46:07.120]  The vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, the vitamins, the minerals, the amino, amino,
[03:46:07.120 --> 03:46:12.440]  the vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, the vitamins, the minerals, that's turbo
[03:46:12.440 --> 03:46:39.920]  force.
[03:46:39.920 --> 03:46:44.720]  A lot of it are in my brain, they're working good right now, good right now, good right, good right, good right now
[03:46:44.720 --> 03:46:47.920]  We work out, left level verbal force, verbal force
[03:46:47.920 --> 03:46:51.420]  We work out, left level verbal, it's verbal force
[03:46:51.420 --> 03:47:13.420]  And get official
[03:47:13.420 --> 03:47:17.420]  Live from the Infowars.com Studios
[03:47:17.420 --> 03:47:26.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Paul Joseph Watson
[03:47:26.420 --> 03:47:38.420]  It's kind of ghastly irony that the mainstream media would stoop to the lowest of the low to try and de-platform shut down Infowars.com
[03:47:38.420 --> 03:47:50.420]  With the outrageous hoax fake news that Alex Jones sent child porn to Sandy Hook lawyers when he was the victim of receiving child porn in an obvious attempt to set him up
[03:47:50.420 --> 03:48:00.420]  I mean this network has worked harder than no other network in trying to expose these international pedo gangs that abuse children
[03:48:00.420 --> 03:48:05.420]  We've been talking about that for well over a decade, we talk about it on a regular basis
[03:48:05.420 --> 03:48:09.420]  We talk about how kids like Desmond is amazing at victims
[03:48:09.420 --> 03:48:13.420]  We talk about this horrific case in Brazil
[03:48:13.420 --> 03:48:24.420]  I mean I made videos on this years ago pointing out that whenever the pedo networks, whenever it goes to court, whenever they actually get busted
[03:48:24.420 --> 03:48:29.420]  Whenever the procurer of these children gets put up in court
[03:48:29.420 --> 03:48:41.420]  He always fingers international elitists, he fingers politicians, judges, police chiefs, entertainers as having been involved in the abuse of these children
[03:48:41.420 --> 03:48:50.420]  You can go through almost every high profile pedo case internationally and it always goes to the top, to the very top
[03:48:50.420 --> 03:48:53.420]  We've exhaustively exposed that
[03:48:53.420 --> 03:49:00.420]  So for the media now to try and drag Alex Jones through the mud for such an obvious fake news hoax
[03:49:00.420 --> 03:49:05.420]  The claim that he sent child porn when he was the victim of that is absolutely disgraceful
[03:49:05.420 --> 03:49:12.420]  But again it shows how desperate they are to drag us down which is why we need your support more than ever
[03:49:12.420 --> 03:49:19.420]  And we've got a big special on InfowarsStore.com which is Save Infowars Emergency Special

[03:50:18.420 --> 03:50:25.420]  Now I just broke about an hour ago a new victim of me too
[03:50:25.420 --> 03:50:28.420]  Probably a deserved victim in this case
[03:50:28.420 --> 03:50:34.420]  Headline on bright bar, eight women accused Hollywood screenwriter Max Landis of sexual and emotional abuse
[03:50:34.420 --> 03:50:41.420]  Eight women have come forward to accuse Hollywood screenwriter direct Max Landis of sexual and emotional abuse
[03:50:41.420 --> 03:50:44.420]  The Daily Beast detailed in an investigation published Tuesday
[03:50:44.420 --> 03:50:53.420]  Landis, who is the son of beloved Hollywood director John Landis, allegedly engaged in a pattern of emotional, physical and sexual abuse spanning over a decade
[03:50:53.420 --> 03:50:55.420]  The outlet reported
[03:50:55.420 --> 03:51:06.420]  This is what one of the alleged victims claimed about Max Landis that he is quote, a serial rapist, gaslighter, a physical and psychological abuser
[03:51:06.420 --> 03:51:13.420]  Who tormented me for six years long after our romantic relationship, both directly and behind my back
[03:51:13.420 --> 03:51:18.420]  One of Landis ex-girlfriend going under the name of Julie told the media
[03:51:18.420 --> 03:51:24.420]  She said, I didn't realize that I had been raped consistently and deliberately by this man for two years until today when I wrote it down
[03:51:24.420 --> 03:51:30.420]  So there's been a whole slew of allegations by eight different women against him
[03:51:30.420 --> 03:51:32.420]  And guess what?
[03:51:32.420 --> 03:51:37.420]  It turns out that Max Landis is a big male feminist
[03:51:37.420 --> 03:51:40.420]  Well, imagine my shock
[03:51:40.420 --> 03:51:43.420]  In almost every single case
[03:51:43.420 --> 03:51:49.420]  Which we've documented with these Me Too Exposes both in the US and the United Kingdom
[03:51:49.420 --> 03:51:52.420]  They always proclaim publicly
[03:51:52.420 --> 03:51:57.420]  How much they love women, how much they fight for women's rights
[03:51:57.420 --> 03:52:02.420]  How much they despise the misogynistic trash on the right
[03:52:02.420 --> 03:52:08.420]  And they always turn out to be the biggest emotional and sexual abusers of women
[03:52:08.420 --> 03:52:17.420]  Always be very wary of people who virtue signal that hard about how much they support women
[03:52:17.420 --> 03:52:26.420]  How much of a male feminist they are because we flash back to this from the Daily Beast again from February
[03:52:26.420 --> 03:52:34.420]  Screenwriter Max Landis stages his Me Too comeback with a girl power action movie
[03:52:34.420 --> 03:52:45.420]  So he created a girl power male feminist movie to try and smooth over his feminist credibility
[03:52:45.420 --> 03:52:51.420]  After some allegations had already emerged earlier this year and now those allegations have got way worse
[03:52:51.420 --> 03:52:55.420]  Again, eight women accusing him of being a serial abuser
[03:52:55.420 --> 03:53:01.420]  This is a guy who virtue signaled about how much of a feminist he was for years on end
[03:53:01.420 --> 03:53:07.420]  To the point where he literally made a feminist movie, an action film about girl power
[03:53:07.420 --> 03:53:16.420]  They always turn out, it's always the male feminist, isn't it, who turn out to be the biggest sexual abusers
[03:53:16.420 --> 03:53:18.420]  Absolutely incredible
[03:53:18.420 --> 03:53:28.420]  Meanwhile in the UK, which I mentioned before, you've now got over a thousand children, some as young as three
[03:53:28.420 --> 03:53:37.420]  Being referred to clinics for sex, gender reassignment operations or at least treatment in terms of hormone blockers
[03:53:37.420 --> 03:53:43.420]  Nobody's interested in that, nobody's interested in the industrial scale grooming of kids across the United Kingdom
[03:53:43.420 --> 03:53:49.420]  Or FGM, of which there'd been one prosecution in the entire history of the country
[03:53:49.420 --> 03:53:55.420]  What the police are concerned about now in the UK is far right, extremism, headline
[03:53:55.420 --> 03:54:02.420]  The UK police help script sole poppers to deter far right extremism
[03:54:02.420 --> 03:54:09.420]  According to a report by the London Times, officers from the government's Prevent Radicalization Programme
[03:54:09.420 --> 03:54:15.420]  Who, by the way, have visited schools if kids go on the UKIP website that happened
[03:54:15.420 --> 03:54:23.420]  Are advising Channel 4's Hollyoaks on a storyline involving one of the main characters getting sucked into far right violence
[03:54:23.420 --> 03:54:30.420]  They have a plot on this sole popper, which is aimed at teenagers and 20-somethings
[03:54:30.420 --> 03:54:34.420]  Where this character gets sucked into a far right extremist group
[03:54:34.420 --> 03:54:41.420]  And the government and police officers are helping the production crew of this television show write the script
[03:54:41.420 --> 03:54:47.420]  To spread greater awareness of the help available to those most at risk
[03:54:47.420 --> 03:54:55.420]  Now I'm not seeing many plots on UK sole poppers that deal with Islamic extremism
[03:54:55.420 --> 03:54:59.420]  Given what happened in Manchester, given what happened on Westminster Bridge
[03:54:59.420 --> 03:55:02.420]  Given what happened on London Bridge
[03:55:02.420 --> 03:55:07.420]  Given what happened a few months ago where another Islamic terrorist tried to run a bunch of people over in a truck
[03:55:07.420 --> 03:55:09.420]  Again, near Parliament
[03:55:09.420 --> 03:55:19.420]  Not seeing a lot of anti-radicalization work in terms of UK police scripting shows about Islamic extremism
[03:55:19.420 --> 03:55:26.420]  Of course, this has coincided with a surge in the country's violent crime rate, which rose 19% in single year
[03:55:26.420 --> 03:55:28.420]  Those are the official numbers, probably way higher
[03:55:28.420 --> 03:55:31.420]  We've got a knife crime epidemic
[03:55:31.420 --> 03:55:38.420]  Literally three people were murdered in the one mile radius where I live over the past week
[03:55:38.420 --> 03:55:43.420]  Some of it is gang on gang, some of it is completely innocent people
[03:55:43.420 --> 03:55:47.420]  Five minutes from where I live, walking distance
[03:55:47.420 --> 03:55:51.420]  A guy left his motorbike outside a restaurant
[03:55:51.420 --> 03:55:57.420]  This gang of youths was stealing bike, he went out to confront them, they kicked him to death
[03:55:57.420 --> 03:56:03.420]  That is now a regular occurrence on the streets of London every single day
[03:56:03.420 --> 03:56:13.420]  Police who are understaffed, under-budgeted, are being told to go and visit people for their Facebook posts
[03:56:13.420 --> 03:56:19.420]  And now they're helping to write the scripts of soap operas to combat far-right extremism
[03:56:19.420 --> 03:56:31.420]  Well, at the same time, saying that they don't have any time or resources to attend to low level crimes like burglaries and break-ins due to funding cuts
[03:56:31.420 --> 03:56:35.420]  Plenty of time to police mean tweets
[03:56:35.420 --> 03:56:38.420]  And write soap opera scripts
[03:56:38.420 --> 03:56:45.420]  Meanwhile, a professor in the UK said Rory Stewart is an establishment spy tasked with destroying Brexit
[03:56:45.420 --> 03:56:49.420]  So it looks like Boris Johnson is the favourite to become the next prime minister
[03:56:49.420 --> 03:56:54.420]  But from out of nowhere, we have this establishment creature called Rory Stewart
[03:56:54.420 --> 03:57:02.420]  Who it turns out had been recruited by MI6 at Oxford University, suddenly now he's a man of the people
[03:57:02.420 --> 03:57:10.420]  The left wing and the Remainers on the right, the establishment Tories are all getting behind him
[03:57:10.420 --> 03:57:15.420]  And suddenly he's the second favourite in the race to become the next UK prime minister
[03:57:15.420 --> 03:57:17.420]  Out of nowhere
[03:57:17.420 --> 03:57:25.420]  So a professor from London School of Economics has said that he's a spy who is literally being installed in this leadership contest
[03:57:25.420 --> 03:57:33.420]  To derail, destroy, subvert, Brexit, and the mass media of course loves him
[03:57:33.420 --> 03:57:37.420]  That's going to wrap it up for the show, coming up next is War Room with Owen Shroyer
[03:57:37.420 --> 03:57:40.420]  Go to infowarsstore.com and breaking news at infowars.com
[03:57:40.420 --> 03:57:48.420]  That's going to wrap it up
[03:58:11.420 --> 03:58:13.420]  If I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word
[03:58:13.420 --> 03:58:16.420]  You're our only hope brother, I'm telling you, you're more important than I am
[03:58:16.420 --> 03:58:41.420]  It's people like you on the ground as you know that's boots on the ground
[03:58:41.420 --> 03:59:00.420]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function
[03:59:00.420 --> 03:59:09.420]  In the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[03:59:09.420 --> 03:59:20.420]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[03:59:20.420 --> 03:59:25.420]  Polymblock is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine
[03:59:25.420 --> 03:59:35.420]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[03:59:35.420 --> 03:59:43.420]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe, head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Polymblock chewable tablets
