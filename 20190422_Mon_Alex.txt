[00:00.000 --> 00:18.880]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18.880 --> 00:23.740]  The field of anti-Trump presidential campaign buffoonery is upon us.
[00:23.740 --> 00:29.780]  As the field of 18 hubris-riddled lecturers of hypocrisy currently take the national stage
[00:29.780 --> 00:36.280]  to whine about half-baked propaganda cooked to a burnt crisp by their cohorts in the mainstream
[00:36.280 --> 00:37.280]  media.
[00:37.280 --> 00:47.640]  I learned right here on these streets that you can't make progress by dividing people.
[00:47.640 --> 00:56.080]  You can't make progress by stoking fear or setting us one against the other.
[00:56.080 --> 01:07.360]  And that's why I'm here today, to tell a different story than Make America Great Again.
[01:07.360 --> 01:12.120]  Because there's a myth being sold to industrial and rural communities.
[01:12.120 --> 01:16.280]  The myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back.
[01:16.280 --> 01:20.320]  It comes from people who think the only way to speak to communities like ours is through
[01:20.320 --> 01:23.120]  resentment and nostalgia.
[01:23.120 --> 01:27.880]  They're selling an impossible promise of returning to a bygone era that was never as great as
[01:27.880 --> 01:31.760]  advertised to begin with.
[01:31.760 --> 01:32.760]  What is demographic socialism?
[01:32.760 --> 01:33.760]  Fair question.
[01:33.760 --> 01:34.760]  Okay.
[01:34.760 --> 01:35.760]  So let's talk about it.
[01:35.760 --> 01:39.080]  What's the punishment for people who don't hand in their guns?
[01:39.080 --> 01:40.360]  Do they go to jail?
[01:40.360 --> 01:45.200]  Well, Jake, they would, but I also offer an alternative which would be to keep them at
[01:45.200 --> 01:47.080]  a hunting club or a shooting range.
[01:47.080 --> 01:51.840]  Their speeches, aside from the whippering lies and politically correct pandering, fall
[01:51.840 --> 01:56.160]  short of what Americans historically expect on the campaign trail.
[01:56.160 --> 02:01.160]  For example, Bull Moose, Teddy Roosevelt, who had once given a 90 minute speech after
[02:01.160 --> 02:06.560]  being shot in the chest at close range, said this about America's immigration quandary.
[02:06.560 --> 02:11.360]  We should insist if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and
[02:11.360 --> 02:17.280]  assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else.
[02:17.280 --> 02:23.000]  Or it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.240]  or origin.
[02:24.240 --> 02:30.000]  But this is predicated upon the person's becoming in every facet an American and nothing
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.240]  but an American.
[02:31.240 --> 02:33.920]  There can be no divided allegiance here.
[02:33.920 --> 02:39.920]  Any man who says he is an American but something else also isn't an American at all.
[02:39.920 --> 02:43.280]  We have room for but one flag, the American flag.
[02:43.280 --> 02:48.600]  We have room for but one language here and that is the English language and we have room
[02:48.600 --> 02:54.800]  for but one's sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people, Theodore Roosevelt.
[02:54.800 --> 02:59.680]  Teddy Roosevelt would be appalled at the foreign interests in meddling and at the handful
[02:59.680 --> 03:05.080]  of money changers actually supporting this lackluster buffet of windbags.
[03:05.080 --> 03:08.960]  Now Lester Land looks a lot like the United States.
[03:08.960 --> 03:15.520]  Like the United States it has about 311 million people and of that 311 million people it turns
[03:15.520 --> 03:20.120]  out 144,000 are called Lester.
[03:20.120 --> 03:26.480]  So 144,000 are called Lester which means about.05% is named Lester.
[03:26.480 --> 03:30.240]  Now Lester's and Lester Land have this extraordinary power.
[03:30.240 --> 03:33.520]  There are two elections, every election cycle in Lester Land.
[03:33.520 --> 03:35.760]  One is called the general election.
[03:35.760 --> 03:41.320]  The other is called the Lester election and in the general election it's the citizens
[03:41.320 --> 03:45.360]  who get to vote but in the Lester election it's the Lester's who get to vote and here's
[03:45.360 --> 03:53.160]  the trick, in order to run in the general election you must do extremely well in the
[03:53.160 --> 03:54.160]  Lester election.
[03:54.160 --> 03:57.000]  You don't necessarily have to win but you must do extremely well.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.200]  Now what can we say about democracy in Lester Land?
[04:01.200 --> 04:06.240]  What we can say number one is the Supreme Court said in Citizens United that people have the
[04:06.240 --> 04:12.280]  ultimate influence over elected officials because after all there is a general election
[04:12.280 --> 04:17.200]  but only after the Lester's have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in
[04:17.200 --> 04:22.520]  the general election and number two obviously this dependence upon the Lester's is going
[04:22.520 --> 04:28.800]  to produce a subtle understated we could say camouflaged bending to keep the Lester's
[04:28.800 --> 04:29.800]  happy.
[04:29.800 --> 04:36.280]  Okay so we have a democracy no doubt but it's dependent upon the Lester's and dependent
[04:36.280 --> 04:42.680]  upon the people it has a competing dependencies we could say conflicting dependencies depending
[04:42.680 --> 04:46.560]  upon who the Lester's are.
[04:46.560 --> 04:52.320]  President Trump rose above the competition in 2016 because he spoke directly to the people.
[04:52.320 --> 04:58.480]  The Democrats have tied themselves to a message of socialism, U.S. constitutional loading
[04:58.480 --> 05:00.480]  and division.
[05:00.480 --> 05:03.960]  Well I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners this was
[05:03.960 --> 05:07.320]  going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore 20 year
[05:07.320 --> 05:11.240]  and a half fight but we have the original producer the original crystal source the
[05:11.240 --> 05:16.400]  best atomic iodine in the world X2 is back we got it this deal just happened about a
[05:16.400 --> 05:20.880]  month ago we rushed it into production it's been bottled the labels are being put on
[05:20.880 --> 05:26.000]  today and that it's going to be on an 18 wheeler right here to Austin from the plant in the
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.200]  Rockies and it's going to be shipped out to you be sure and sign up for auto ship and
[05:30.200 --> 05:35.080]  an additional 10 percent off the 25 percent off celebration of the fact that we got it
[05:35.080 --> 05:40.240]  back and we're relaunching it research the iodine conspiracy find out why it's so important
[05:40.240 --> 05:43.960]  find out what the globalists don't want you to have the good halogen you have the bad
[05:43.960 --> 05:50.920]  halogens at infowarstore.com that's the umbrella site in force life.com she writes the supplements
[05:50.920 --> 05:58.680]  and this is the King Daddy ladies and gentlemen it is X2 original now back at infowarstore.com
[06:20.920 --> 06:33.160]  it's Monday April 22nd 2019 Earth Day I'm your host Alex Jones thank you so much for
[06:33.160 --> 06:40.840]  joining us we are lined up and ready to launch out of the gates a very important transmission
[06:40.840 --> 06:47.000]  I want to break down today later in the hour what Earth Day is really all about who launched
[06:47.000 --> 06:53.280]  it what the globalist plan is and how it's a cover for the globalist to take the planet
[06:53.280 --> 06:58.880]  over to take control of all life on the planet and to basically create an artificial system
[06:58.880 --> 07:07.160]  in their own words a technocracy that the geneticists control and basically overwrite
[07:07.160 --> 07:16.240]  with nanotech which will change the very makeup of the planet forever or boil down it means
[07:16.240 --> 07:23.040]  playing God remember the Johnny Depp movie came out a few years ago about transcending
[07:23.040 --> 07:30.520]  and he becomes the AI and then he disperses himself into dust into the clouds to then
[07:30.520 --> 07:37.480]  replicate and take control of the matter of the planet and he is a savior it's called
[07:37.480 --> 07:47.000]  transcendence that's their goal that's their end game is a post-human future it's been
[07:47.000 --> 07:53.240]  the plan it is the plan and whether they can do it or not it doesn't matter it shows
[07:53.240 --> 08:01.000]  the truly evil spirit that's running them and it ties into the spirit of death we're
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.600]  going to break down at the bottom of the hour I'm going to get into all this at the bottom
[08:03.600 --> 08:10.160]  of the hour and just incredible statements by the pig like creature the mayor of New
[08:10.160 --> 08:21.880]  York wrecking that once fine city de Blasio he has come out and announced a plan that
[08:21.880 --> 08:28.080]  will completely bankrupt New York I mean if you thought the exodus was bad with 42% of
[08:28.080 --> 08:33.160]  the population polled saying they plan to leave within one year in the middle class
[08:33.160 --> 08:38.120]  evacuating will wait till you hear this he says they're basically going to tear down
[08:38.120 --> 08:43.040]  all the buildings and make everybody retrofit for them because quote glass and steel is
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.000]  bad for the earth you know like why would they do that because it's all about destroying
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.640]  prosperity how do you think we're supposed to operate when China has no environmental
[08:55.640 --> 09:00.640]  standards and we have all these environmental standards and then crazy stuff like you can't
[09:00.640 --> 09:05.720]  have carbon dioxide come out of a chimney or out of your car it's a toxin no it's not
[09:05.720 --> 09:13.880]  it's what plants breathe so you put those selective ball and change on just a few European
[09:13.880 --> 09:19.320]  and Western countries and it's game over financially that's all this is is economic warfare and
[09:19.320 --> 09:22.800]  sabotage we're going to break that down as I said it all ties together at the bottom
[09:22.800 --> 09:32.240]  of the hour obviously when we come back in the next segment I'm loaded for bear on Sri
[09:32.240 --> 09:37.920]  Lanka and I was just watching Fox News before went live and they were reporting we don't
[09:37.920 --> 09:43.640]  know if it's Islamic terror they know who the bombers were they knew their names are
[09:43.640 --> 09:48.080]  they were people allowed out of the country to go fight in Syria and were allowed back
[09:48.080 --> 09:56.000]  in they said in speeches we're going to blow you up and kill you but notice we can't say
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.280]  it's Muslims and so the BBC and Al Jazeera they're saying it's a Islamophobia this was
[10:03.280 --> 10:09.800]  not Islam and you go well of course it was Islam I know but they just changed the subject
[10:09.800 --> 10:13.880]  it's like saying if you don't want the TPP to run your country or the EU to take control
[10:13.880 --> 10:17.160]  of the world while you're anti-Semitic you're like what's that to do with Jews well why
[10:17.160 --> 10:25.280]  do you they they inject that to change the subject so don't be anti-Islam I had nothing
[10:25.280 --> 10:32.440]  to do with these guys taking credit for it and all the rest of it going in and stuffing
[10:32.440 --> 10:39.080]  himself at the all you could eat Easter buffet and then blowing up the Christians churches
[10:39.080 --> 10:44.720]  have become the number one target in the world according to the UN there's a 300% increase
[10:44.720 --> 10:50.720]  the last decade in churches being blown up an attack but it's always Muslims attacking
[10:50.720 --> 10:57.600]  but it's not Islam that's right but then a white guy goes in and attacks poor Muslims
[10:57.600 --> 11:04.480]  and just this attack in Sri Lanka was 400 times bigger 400% bigger and it's all white
[11:04.480 --> 11:09.080]  people's fault it's Christians fault it's the West fault and women wear burkas and they
[11:09.080 --> 11:18.240]  go to daily calls of prayer the police apologize for being white and on and on and on and Christians
[11:18.240 --> 11:23.120]  and you know this guy was the Christian apologize to Islam where are the Islamic leaders to
[11:23.120 --> 11:33.360]  crying this where are they I think there's one imam has come out that's better than nothing
[11:33.360 --> 11:40.280]  but we have a gentleman joining us in the third hour today Zachary Lee clown he's been
[11:40.280 --> 11:44.720]  in the military smart guy has a lot of great connections he's been one of the sources on
[11:44.720 --> 11:49.440]  air because he does know a lot of people I'll just leave it at that I've had some other
[11:49.440 --> 11:56.320]  contacts and with some of the same folks and he's been a Muslim and he's also been in the
[11:56.320 --> 12:04.400]  military and been been hurt in in firefights but fighting radical Islam but he's also witnessed
[12:04.400 --> 12:09.440]  government sponsored terror which we know has been allowed to take place we know there
[12:09.440 --> 12:16.360]  is a role of the globalist arm of the CIA trying to radicalize Islam and pushing the
[12:16.360 --> 12:21.960]  most radical elements like Hillary turning in the Arab Spring all these jihadis loose
[12:21.960 --> 12:27.880]  on our allies and overthrowing moderate regimes so yes he's right when he says hey there's
[12:27.880 --> 12:33.040]  something bigger behind all this so he's a Muslim his family come he's from a prominent
[12:33.040 --> 12:38.080]  family in Morocco he's an American he's an army veteran he's a smart guy he'll give us
[12:38.080 --> 12:44.840]  his perspective on that and we'll also have open phones as well Ian the second and third
[12:44.840 --> 12:51.520]  hour but going into third hour with Zachary joining us and then we also have will Johnson
[12:51.520 --> 12:57.280]  United America first dot com the great work he does hosting the fourth hour and then the
[12:57.280 --> 13:01.200]  war room with Owen Schreuer there's a lot of other stuff too that I'm obviously gonna
[13:01.200 --> 13:07.400]  get to you know I mentioned this yesterday I never got to it Washington state is trying
[13:07.400 --> 13:13.680]  to legalize literal soylent green and if we don't know what that is I'll get into that
[13:13.680 --> 13:21.120]  when I get into the whole Earth Day situation at the bottom of the hour also Mexican troops
[13:21.120 --> 13:27.440]  as you know we now know we do they had a confrontation with US military last week but now we know
[13:27.440 --> 13:32.960]  that they actually disarmed them on the US side of the border and gave them orders and
[13:32.960 --> 13:39.960]  so that's now the point that our country's gotten to Mexico isn't careful we'll have
[13:39.960 --> 13:45.360]  to go down to Mexico City like we've done a couple other times and blow up all the government
[13:45.360 --> 13:52.120]  buildings with the US Marines but this is really becoming a problem Mexico is completely
[13:52.120 --> 13:58.240]  out of control and belligerent most of the military is run by the cartels and the Democrats
[13:58.240 --> 14:06.920]  are trying to politically marry us into this whole thing they're trying to merge basically
[14:06.920 --> 14:14.880]  into NS 13 and like Pelosi said we're all God's children okay I'm gonna announce two
[14:14.880 --> 14:25.240]  things here that are very important obviously we're ending the 50% off apparel sale tomorrow

[19:43.760 --> 19:47.560]  mean i don't know what's going to happen to me in the future i mean all i know is i want

[19:52.640 --> 19:57.080]  that i've experienced not these devil worshipers they're cold and failed and feels like being
[19:57.080 --> 20:13.280]  a tomb i want life i want jesus you're listening to the alex jones show from the front lines
[20:13.280 --> 20:31.040]  of the information war it's alex jones you can set your watch by the week of easter starting
[20:31.040 --> 20:38.080]  on palm sunday every year since i became a newshound i've noticed that there are bombings
[20:38.080 --> 20:46.000]  all over the world shootings stabbings at christian churches by muslims and you know
[20:46.000 --> 20:49.560]  back when i was a teenager reading about it the newspaper seeing it on the news they said
[20:49.560 --> 20:55.000]  it's islamic extremist terrorist but then obama got in office and he said that's not
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.640]  islam isis isn't islam al qaeda is not islam even though he was funding them and the muslim
[21:00.640 --> 21:07.040]  brotherhood was running them and he said so that's not islam actually it's a very strong
[21:07.040 --> 21:19.480]  form of orthodox wahhabist mecca based original islam it's as islamic as jesus is christian
[21:19.480 --> 21:29.440]  that's fact and the argument that this isn't islam is just a way to distract and cause
[21:29.440 --> 21:38.880]  a debate about that instead of the reality you can go watch the debos meetings on television
[21:38.880 --> 21:43.600]  they're announcing world government world taxes technocracies they say we want to get
[21:43.600 --> 21:49.920]  rid of elected governments and then i play clips of world leaders saying we want world
[21:49.920 --> 21:57.920]  government and they have national news say jones is making it up there's no such thing
[21:57.920 --> 22:03.680]  that's all these globalists do so i can show you hours of muslims tearing down crosses
[22:03.680 --> 22:08.240]  crucifying people upside down throwing gays off buildings and by the way these are all
[22:08.240 --> 22:14.720]  the governments that obama supported obama supported put in these radicals in and so
[22:14.720 --> 22:20.720]  that doesn't give credence to there's a bigger power manipulating islam and putting the radicals
[22:20.720 --> 22:30.000]  in charge and we have a guest coming on jackery clay won in the third hour to look at the
[22:30.000 --> 22:40.000]  bigger picture but let's look at the facts here the story is linked up on drugs report
[22:40.000 --> 22:46.680]  dot com right up on the left hand side it's an info wars dot com posting of the great
[22:46.680 --> 22:52.240]  work of mr schneider fact let's go in fours dot com and click through to his site so
[22:52.240 --> 23:00.320]  folks that churches have become the number one target for hate attacks on average of
[23:00.320 --> 23:15.280]  105 every single month and and the united nations and the united nations admits that
[23:15.280 --> 23:21.960]  over half of all religious attacks and terror attacks in the world are christians being
[23:21.960 --> 23:30.560]  attacked churches have become the number one target for hate attacks on average of 105
[23:30.560 --> 23:43.880]  every single month that's the facts meanwhile when i go through the news that's out there
[23:43.880 --> 23:48.280]  the reportage relonka suicide bomber anyone who disagrees with muslim should be killed
[23:48.280 --> 23:57.560]  he shot the video days before the police were looking for him and others who admittedly
[23:57.560 --> 24:04.000]  detonated suicide bombs but they're still saying we don't know if it's muslims these
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.200]  guys had fought in syria they've been allowed back in the country they said they were going
[24:09.200 --> 24:15.000]  to kill everybody it happened and the media won't say it's islamic again think about how
[24:15.000 --> 24:22.960]  wild that is it just boggles the mind and then it gets worse our own greg reese noticed
[24:22.960 --> 24:31.160]  this last night he put a report up on info wars dot com easter worshippers obama and
[24:31.160 --> 24:35.800]  hillary refused to use the word christian had to shrink lanka attacks but use the word
[24:35.800 --> 24:44.120]  muslim and islam in every tweet about the tragic events in christ church new zealot here's
[24:44.120 --> 24:51.080]  greg reese's report both president obama and hillary clinton found it impossible to say
[24:51.080 --> 24:59.020]  the words radical islam radical islamic terrorists and he won't even mention the word and nor
[24:59.020 --> 25:04.120]  will president obama he won't use the term or speak anything negative about islam and
[25:04.120 --> 25:09.840]  i consider part of my responsibility as president united states to fight against negative stereotypes
[25:09.840 --> 25:15.480]  of islam wherever they appear and now after the horrible terrorist attacks in shrillanka
[25:15.480 --> 25:23.240]  strangely they cannot seem to use the word christian obama clinton and abc news have
[25:23.240 --> 25:29.840]  all used the word easter worshipper as if an anti christian pr firm is feeding them
[25:29.840 --> 25:36.320]  all talking points strange at this point it really just seems obvious what side these
[25:36.320 --> 25:48.320]  people are all working for another key report by greg reese he put another five minute report
[25:48.320 --> 25:54.920]  out yesterday that is extremely powerful dealing with the history of islam that will air in
[25:54.920 --> 26:01.080]  the third hour today and debate but here's paul joseph watson's article today easter worshippers
[26:01.080 --> 26:07.080]  obama and hillary refused to use the word christian after shrillanka attacks i remember
[26:07.080 --> 26:10.440]  20 years ago hearing about the war on christmas and i didn't believe it then i heard about
[26:10.440 --> 26:14.040]  public schools in texas wouldn't let kids hand out christmas cards even though that's
[26:14.040 --> 26:19.920]  their free speech you just can't have the school officially pushing it but the left
[26:19.920 --> 26:25.520]  just presses that separation church and state to the end of the first amendment and then
[26:25.520 --> 26:29.040]  now they take down nativity scenes everywhere they're pulling down crosses in europe off
[26:29.040 --> 26:33.120]  churches because it offends muslims they're in idly they're covering christian tombstones
[26:33.120 --> 26:39.920]  because the muslims get mad and tear them down i mean this is just wild it's inciting
[26:39.920 --> 26:45.200]  the most radical muslims to believe that they can literally just piss on europe piss on america
[26:45.200 --> 26:53.360]  in in some ritual of dominance and then easter worshippers in your face can't say christian
[26:53.360 --> 27:03.120]  worshippers christ worshippers christian means christ no you have to call it something else
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.880]  it's amazing it'd be like calling muslims ramadan worshippers
[27:10.880 --> 27:18.160]  but it's all about a race and christianity remember what sort of happened a few years ago
[27:19.520 --> 27:26.400]  google apple and all the other leftist sites removed christian holidays from the calendars
[27:27.040 --> 27:35.440]  palm sunday easter they started calling it winter holiday winter vacation
[27:35.440 --> 27:45.200]  so that they're removing any sign of it in your face and rubbing your noses in it
[27:46.560 --> 27:50.960]  over 200 people die and they won't even say they were christian they won't even say their identity
[27:50.960 --> 27:56.240]  they won't even say they were targeted they just erased them they call them easter worshippers and
[27:56.240 --> 28:01.760]  now leftist in buzzfeed and others are calling for a modern roof on notre dame that conservatives
[28:01.760 --> 28:09.760]  will hate that's not christian that story's up on info wars dot com as well with so much more and
[28:09.760 --> 28:15.280]  oh look at this headline of the daily mail hundreds hurt anyway to whitewash it hundreds hurt as
[28:15.280 --> 28:22.160]  blast hit shri lanka churches arms and legs hundreds dead hundreds five of their lives did you hear
[28:22.160 --> 28:33.440]  they scraped their knee those easter worshippers and shri lanka and intelligence and others said on
[28:33.440 --> 28:39.760]  april fourth brace for terror attacks and they named the islamic caliphate organization and of
[28:39.760 --> 28:44.000]  course the groups took credit but our own media won't tell you that each one do we know who did it
[28:44.640 --> 28:47.920]  foxes earlier is like some think it might have been radical muslims we're not sure though
[28:47.920 --> 28:54.240]  no hell could have been christians you know christians don't like those easter worshippers
[28:54.880 --> 29:00.560]  they didn't feel that far but they were like no one knows who did it no one knows heart disease is
[29:00.560 --> 29:06.080]  on the rise clogged arteries high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected

[33:20.560 --> 33:38.880]  from the infowar.com studios it's alex jones ain't nothing gonna make it happen
[33:50.880 --> 33:54.000]  i love that fire all your guns at once
[34:08.160 --> 34:10.480]  it's hard to turn stephen wolf off we gotta get serious and do it
[34:12.400 --> 34:20.240]  so it's earth day 2019 what is earth day it was literally created just like the un
[34:20.240 --> 34:26.720]  and over 50 other organizations by the robber barons by the rockefellers by british intelligence
[34:27.920 --> 34:33.600]  and it's about organizing the planet under corporate regulations that they're exempt from
[34:34.640 --> 34:41.040]  and not letting certain countries have industry but others can and having carbon taxes on the west
[34:41.040 --> 34:50.000]  that are surveilled by supercomputers to control every aspect of our lives and so basically it's
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.640]  the establishment saying we're the saviors of the earth and we're going to decide how you
[34:54.640 --> 34:58.720]  live and what you do we're going to tell you're having too many kids we're going to tell you
[34:58.720 --> 35:03.360]  carbon dioxide is bad we're going to tell you capitalism is bad oh but we're the big mega rich
[35:03.360 --> 35:09.520]  capitalist who have surveillance capitalism and crony capitalism which is really just globalism
[35:10.160 --> 35:15.520]  destroying you and then it teaches don't be competitive don't be rugged don't be strong
[35:15.520 --> 35:22.400]  uh be placid be a follower don't have children don't have a life force don't have a will
[35:22.400 --> 35:28.880]  don't have a destiny be good little compliant minions so that the globalist can control the
[35:28.880 --> 35:35.920]  future so they can choose the future and so they can chart their course because you're not just
[35:35.920 --> 35:41.200]  riding along with them as they domesticate you like a pig you know pigs are the smartest
[35:41.200 --> 35:48.560]  domesticated animal undoubtedly every study but you know you come out for a year or so and you
[35:48.560 --> 35:55.360]  feed a piglet after it's not suckling anymore on the sal on its mommy maybe that sal's not a little
[35:55.360 --> 36:00.160]  old too you kind of sell her to get turned into bacon and hot dogs and everything and sausage
[36:01.040 --> 36:04.960]  they don't notice even she's squealing as you kick her into the back of a car kick her in the back
[36:04.960 --> 36:09.360]  of a trailer with a couple other pigs to go get slaughtered hung up by their feet their
[36:09.360 --> 36:14.240]  throat slit and they squeal and kick and everything else and pigs right next to it don't care they
[36:14.240 --> 36:19.200]  just want some food because they're a lower animal because they don't stick up for each other now a
[36:19.200 --> 36:26.000]  wild boar would stick up for other members of its group and i guess a group of monkeys is a troop a
[36:26.000 --> 36:33.280]  bunch of dogs is a pack what is a group of pigs i know i know a group of crows is a murder
[36:33.280 --> 36:40.640]  what's a gaggle all that old English is really interesting what's a group of pigs the definition
[36:40.640 --> 36:49.120]  of a group of pigs it's a what a drift so you have a whole drift of pigs i mean you can even
[36:49.120 --> 36:56.320]  take a pig you can't do this with horses and you and dogs dogs don't like this either because
[36:56.320 --> 37:01.440]  they're actually you know try to stick together a little bit but you can take a pig right into
[37:01.440 --> 37:07.520]  a squeeze shoot 20 feet from other pigs and you can put the chains around the back of its legs
[37:07.520 --> 37:17.040]  tighten them up and then hit that winch that usually it's an air winch and go right there
[37:17.040 --> 37:22.000]  and then that coming with that knife and that blood just was right there that sucker is kicking
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.600]  and dying and it makes the meat better to get that blood out but a lot of places pull the blood
[37:27.600 --> 37:30.880]  to sell that too it just gets put into blood sausage these things but you know what i'm digressing
[37:30.880 --> 37:36.400]  i want to explain leftist and trendies there though this is very important you're giving that pig
[37:36.400 --> 37:40.320]  pieces of watermelon you're giving that pig all the leftovers you know you're taking care of that
[37:40.320 --> 37:48.560]  pig it squeals with the light when it sees you it it's just so excited and it doesn't care if
[37:48.560 --> 37:54.480]  you kill the other pigs right in front of it in fact it'll eat its buddies it'll eat its brother
[37:54.480 --> 38:00.400]  or sister if you fall down and break your neck in a pig pen they're gonna eat you oh they're
[38:00.400 --> 38:04.640]  gonna walk right over like a big old vampire and just bite right under tear your throat out
[38:12.480 --> 38:17.120]  people think you call somebody that's bad a pig meaning they're greedy no no you call them a pig
[38:18.160 --> 38:26.400]  because they'll sell you out in a second that's why you call somebody a pig because they're disloyal
[38:26.400 --> 38:33.120]  you have a pig 20 years and pet it every day give it kisses and feed its strawberries it'll
[38:33.120 --> 38:42.320]  kill you the minute you fall down and get hurt now back to earth day because that's what this is
[38:42.320 --> 38:46.400]  you've got all these liberals and trendies and you go to Whole Foods and it's all these big racks
[38:46.400 --> 38:53.600]  of magazines saying oh austerity being poor is so good and oh not competing and not having children
[38:53.600 --> 38:59.920]  is so beautiful and and i've got big stacks of it in the in the news today how altruistic and high
[38:59.920 --> 39:06.080]  and mighty it is but what it is is they've taught total selfishness the average millennial is the
[39:06.080 --> 39:12.880]  most selfish criminal individual who will lie cheat steal virtue signal and i'm not saying all
[39:12.880 --> 39:19.920]  millennials are bad but it's scientifically known that millennials don't want a car they don't want
[39:19.920 --> 39:24.800]  a boyfriend or girlfriend they don't want to give a charity they don't want to work hard they don't
[39:24.800 --> 39:31.200]  want to exercise they just want to walk around and pose in front of each other and act like
[39:31.200 --> 39:36.640]  they're high and mighty and then be approving to each other and tell you oh the good job you've
[39:36.640 --> 39:41.920]  done for the right type of light bulb or the right type of kale you're eating or or so it's
[39:41.920 --> 39:50.320]  all a bunch of empty alone people going around virtues signaling to each other a bunch of pigs
[39:50.320 --> 39:54.560]  and so that's all this is and so the system packs them on the head and is just getting
[39:54.560 --> 40:02.880]  in position to be the post human era they got seduced by the technology they got sucked in
[40:02.880 --> 40:08.640]  they didn't get warned they got programmed now generation z is different because the millennials
[40:08.640 --> 40:17.440]  and the leftist above them they are programming and being so mean to z that z is becoming right
[40:17.440 --> 40:24.800]  wing z is becoming libertarian z is the becoming pro-life because humans are designed that when
[40:24.800 --> 40:32.960]  you've got bad leadership you rebel against it but the millennials are just the self-satisfied
[40:32.960 --> 40:39.520]  nerds that want to be in the club and so they've decided they've built their club and and and see
[40:39.520 --> 40:45.360]  we don't want to be in their club so they're upset and so they're trying to make us be in the club
[40:46.480 --> 40:51.600]  you guys how they do this so quickly you train them with television culture primary education
[40:51.600 --> 40:57.600]  secondary education they bring in the vast majority very soft very placid latchkey kids
[40:57.600 --> 41:04.000]  who in the last 30 years stopped playing sports stopped playing outside or they got participation
[41:04.000 --> 41:10.320]  trophies dodgeball was banned running and wrestling was banned if you got in a fistfight you went to
[41:10.320 --> 41:18.480]  jail before i mean it was encouraged by the coaches for us to have fistfights but see now it's all
[41:18.480 --> 41:24.320]  changed and so you have these domesticated people but they still have never worked out their aggression
[41:24.320 --> 41:28.800]  they've never gone through rites of passage so they're like arrested development five-year-old
[41:28.800 --> 41:35.760]  spoiled rotten kids but they've been told by the system you're successful if you do what we say
[41:36.720 --> 41:40.400]  so they're the group that commits the most suicide they're the group that they're dying
[41:41.280 --> 41:48.080]  they're dying and if you walk down the street and you look at a group of millennials they look like
[41:48.080 --> 41:56.400]  somebody sucked their soul out they're gone and their fertility is lowering and their IQs are
[41:56.400 --> 42:01.440]  lowering and they have way more neurological disorders and it's not their fault they've been
[42:01.440 --> 42:07.760]  hit with massive loads of synthetic chemical and plant-based estrogen and they've been hit by the
[42:07.760 --> 42:12.960]  entire system but then they've been told all their inclinations and their weaknesses are actually
[42:12.960 --> 42:20.160]  good traits so they would adapt to being enslaved and adapt to the new mutinogens and believe that
[42:20.160 --> 42:27.280]  their new state was actually a superior one because the hollywood system told him it was
[42:27.920 --> 42:34.560]  they are the definition of chomps now when we return i'm going to get into the evidence of this
[42:34.560 --> 42:40.800]  and where the green plan goes and what's going to happen to the chomps just like the former head
[42:40.800 --> 42:47.120]  of facebook said we designed it to make you depressed and alone and trendy trendy means oppressed
[42:47.120 --> 42:52.480]  and alone and desperate and scared a follower that thinks they're free and thinks they're part
[42:52.480 --> 42:55.920]  of the ruling class that's all when trump got in it scared him so much because they're supposed to

[47:05.840 --> 47:20.800]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[47:20.800 --> 47:31.440]  it's the real escape from new york
[47:37.680 --> 47:43.440]  if you just joined us i was laying out how the system literally brainwashed
[47:43.440 --> 47:49.680]  more than half of the millennial generation to want communism and socialism living in the lap
[47:50.880 --> 47:54.000]  of decadent pre-collapse capitalism
[47:56.480 --> 48:02.960]  and now new york in major polls that several studies i've got articles here out of the new
[48:02.960 --> 48:11.040]  york post so she depressed up to 42 percent 41.7 percent of thousands polls say they can't afford
[48:11.040 --> 48:18.720]  to live in new york and plan to leave in the next year and what is the establishment's answer
[48:18.720 --> 48:25.360]  bringing more unskilled laborers for jobs that don't exist but don't worry spain had their economy
[48:25.360 --> 48:30.240]  bankrupted in the last 20 years with a quote green economy of tearing down buildings they set out a
[48:30.240 --> 48:36.240]  carbon footprint uh getting rid of using oil trying to use windmills they're now in a permanent
[48:36.240 --> 48:44.320]  depression with people under 30 and almost 50 percent unemployment and a permanent system of
[48:44.320 --> 48:50.160]  basically revolution that's the same thing but don't worry de Blasio is part of earth day it's
[48:50.160 --> 48:57.040]  all interconnected came out and announced things that i mean if you thought free healthcare and
[48:57.040 --> 49:03.440]  free welfare for those that don't even want to work like aoc said and special bathroom stalls for
[49:03.440 --> 49:08.240]  cows to suck the methane out of their feces and put it into mine shafts this is going to hurt the
[49:08.240 --> 49:15.840]  earth i'm not kidding if you think free healthcare and free education and no taxes uh and reparations
[49:17.040 --> 49:23.440]  and free education i forgot that one if you thought that wouldn't bankrupt things and make the other
[49:23.440 --> 49:30.480]  people paying for it go broke aoc just said it doesn't matter where the money comes from we'll
[49:30.480 --> 49:37.360]  just do it wow after all the earth can end in 12 years if we don't give her all the power
[49:38.000 --> 49:44.320]  same thing Beethoven's saying we'll play that in a moment but first de Blasio he's up there in a city
[49:45.360 --> 49:49.840]  that just since he got in has piles of trash everywhere rats everywhere everybody i know
[49:49.840 --> 49:55.040]  says don't go back to new york it was pretty good under juliani it's a great city a lot of history a
[49:55.040 --> 49:59.920]  lot of energy but let me tell you everybody i know says that they came and go to new york now
[49:59.920 --> 50:05.760]  they say it's falling apart again just like it was in the eighties and de Blasio just like
[50:05.760 --> 50:13.200]  new york's own Hugo Chavez is presiding over the same thing just like chicago is falling apart just
[50:13.200 --> 50:22.160]  like san francisco or seattle or portland or la they do it on purpose they want to collapse
[50:22.160 --> 50:27.200]  things to buy it all up for themselves then they'll clean it up later they think but it's a process
[50:27.200 --> 50:32.400]  they carry out so here's the Blasio saying they're going to make every building retrofit and do giant
[50:32.400 --> 50:38.080]  construction projects that'll bankrupt them that'll only drive up the rents that cost more here it is
[50:38.720 --> 50:45.040]  so we have our own green new deal it's three very basic ideas one the biggest source of emissions
[50:45.040 --> 50:51.440]  in new york city is buildings we're putting clear strong mandates the first of any major city on
[50:51.440 --> 50:56.080]  the earth to say to building owners you got to clean up your act you got a retrofit you got to
[50:56.080 --> 51:01.440]  save energy if you don't do it by 2030 there will be serious fines as high as a million dollars or
[51:01.440 --> 51:06.640]  more for the biggest buildings and this mandate is going to guarantee that we reduce emissions we're
[51:06.640 --> 51:13.200]  going to ban the classic glass and steel skyscrapers which are incredibly inefficient if someone wants
[51:13.200 --> 51:16.560]  to build one of those things they can take a whole lot of steps to make it energy efficient but we're
[51:16.560 --> 51:20.960]  not going to allow what we used to see in the past and the city of new york the government
[51:20.960 --> 51:27.360]  which uses about as much energy in a year as do the people and the businesses of the state of
[51:27.360 --> 51:33.440]  vermont we are going to get all of our energy from renewable sources in the next five years
[51:35.440 --> 51:39.200]  so these are the big broad strokes for the plan they could have wide impact these are
[51:39.200 --> 51:45.600]  it's civic decisions but this is okay i can't listen anymore of it the full clips on on news wars.com
[51:45.600 --> 51:53.840]  you understand you heard him say the first city in the world this is designed to bankrupt us
[51:53.840 --> 51:59.760]  india mexico china and 160 plus other third world countries they're not going to make any of these
[51:59.760 --> 52:05.840]  changes by the way toxic waste being dumped in the ocean is bad splicing humans and animals
[52:05.840 --> 52:10.720]  is bad having terminator seeds now in hundreds of variety of plants where the plants don't produce
[52:10.720 --> 52:16.400]  seeds anymore that can make new plants having giant nuclear reactors everywhere having giant
[52:16.400 --> 52:21.040]  cern reactors they admit could blow the planet up literally they go well it could cause a black hole
[52:21.040 --> 52:26.320]  or a giant explosion i mean what do you think slamming uranium and plutonium together does
[52:26.320 --> 52:34.400]  they're doing that at cern and thousands of other insane things so what is this it's a scientific
[52:34.400 --> 52:38.640]  takeover they believe the planet is obsolete they believe they're going to merge with machines
[52:38.640 --> 52:44.960]  they're mad scientist they're testing everything on everyone right now and the breakaway civilization
[52:44.960 --> 52:50.720]  is a tax exempt regulatory exempt diplomatic community above the law but it's making all
[52:50.720 --> 52:57.520]  of us be under massive regulations and massive control the un exempts itself from carbon taxes
[52:57.520 --> 53:03.600]  the eu bureaucracy exempts itself and they'll all be exempt as well so let me see a cop car it says
[53:03.600 --> 53:11.120]  tax exempt okay fine that's the cop car but the point is these are corporate rulers who are tax exempt
[53:14.000 --> 53:19.120]  think about that think about that long and think about that hard ladies and gentlemen
[53:19.760 --> 53:24.400]  so they get all the benefits of the taxes and regulations but none of the cost
[53:26.480 --> 53:29.920]  they call sorrows a philanthropist they call David Rockefeller philanthropist they put their
[53:29.920 --> 53:37.120]  money in tax-free foundations they pay no tax they know what they're doing they're monsters
[53:37.840 --> 53:42.880]  and so here's some of the articles right here 14 reasons millennials are having fewer babies
[53:42.880 --> 53:48.800]  it's for the earth it's cool they have more fun kids are trouble that's liberal trendyism kids suck
[53:49.520 --> 53:53.280]  oh but they want but they love children so much the ones they're unable to abort
[53:53.280 --> 54:00.800]  they keep the babies comfortable little blood boy for some millennials climate change clock ticks
[54:00.800 --> 54:06.960]  louder than biological and that's another article NBC news don't have children for the earth but bring

[54:19.920 --> 54:25.760]  to export our worst millennials are having less sex than each generation in 60 years here's why it
[54:25.760 --> 54:31.920]  matters la times yep they told the truth they want anybody to pay for their social security

[56:02.320 --> 56:06.960]  kill them they're just being put into a little kind of little oh play ping pong drink beer
[56:07.760 --> 56:13.200]  where the ruling class while you're being prepared for humanity to be made obsolescent
[56:13.200 --> 56:18.640]  but the ai's first buying you off kind of stinging like a spider or a wasp does biting you first
[56:18.640 --> 56:23.280]  to neutralize you so it can then tie you up in the web and then take its time on you
[56:24.400 --> 56:28.880]  before you're ground up and use for fertilizer for whatever so they don't want cars anymore oh they

[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:15.920]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:33.280]  this current trajectory there will be people who can no longer live in the cities that they call
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:39.680]  home today there is food grown in this country that will no longer prosper in these soils there is
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.240]  going to be massive migration of tens or hundreds of millions of people from countries that are
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:51.440]  literally uninhabitable or underwater that are above the sea right now this is our final chance
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:58.560]  the scientists are absolutely unanimous on this that we have no more than 12 years to take incredibly
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:05.520]  bold action on this crisis the crisis that could at its worst lead to extinction i think that the
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:13.120]  part of it that is generational is that millennials and people and you know gen z and all these folks
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:19.600]  that come after us are looking up and we're like the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:29.200]  address climate change and your biggest issue is your your biggest issue is how are we going to pay
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:39.280]  for it and like this is the war this is our world war two this is our world war two so it's
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:45.200]  earth day 2019 total you and fraud about a global government taking control of every aspect of her
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.960]  lives and shutting down the west but putting no regulations on common China and others this is our
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:56.160]  world war two this is our world war four the cold war was world war three i agree with the cia on
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:03.520]  that world war four is an economic war being carried out and when you look at the hillbott cult
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:08.160]  they were a bunch of computer programmers out in silicon valley they were prominent
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:14.160]  and they said you must be gay you must cut your genitals off and you must wear Nike tennis shoes
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:19.120]  and drink vodka and barbecues and fly up to the comet because the world's going to end
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:27.040]  in 12 years they were saying 12 years and then you could fly up to the comet is their only chance
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:33.440]  to get to spaceship jim jones told him the world was going to end in a decade and you need to drink
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:39.760]  that kool-aid right now to get beamed up to jesus and so when you see the new democratic talking
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:46.320]  point that the earth is going to be gone or we're all going to be dead in 12 years i mean algor in
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:53.200]  2003 and 2004 when it came out with an inconvenient load of baloney he said that major coastal cities
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:03:01.280]  would be several feet underwater by 2017 and the northern and southern ice caps would be completely
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:09.840]  melted now the northern and southern ice caps are the largest ever recorded you know why we've
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:16.000]  only had satellites up there that got good readings for 50 years so in the last 50 years
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.880]  this is what happens in the summer if you're too many of you can see it in the summer the taps get
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.360]  smaller because a lot of it melts in the summer and then the winter they get bigger
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:36.080]  but what's being recorded in the winter is the largest ice caps for the arctic that's in the
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:44.000]  north and the Antarctic in the south the largest ever recorded but they'll point every year in the
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.120]  summer in the arctic by august it's the opposite the Antarctic it's reversed and they'll go look
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:57.040]  it's collapsing the giant glaciers are collapsing glaciers always are collapsing
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.720]  and the last ice age 15 000 years ago you're wondering why you're out in the middle of a
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:08.000]  field like Iowa and they'll just be a giant boulder and a bunch of round rocks everywhere mixed in
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.680]  with the soil that's because glaciers came through over all those millennium and ground those rocks
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:20.960]  into perfect and those will be rocks from canada that are a thousand miles south in in areas of
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:25.840]  kansas is where the ice age basically stopped is up by the oklahoma border
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.480]  you'll just be driving along and there's just big round boulders everywhere because that pushed it
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:35.600]  all down that's what they do they go look they're melting in the summer run for the hills we're all
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:45.040]  dead god help us we're all dead in 12 years this is jim jones cult garbage and they're just brainwashing
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:52.080]  it's like it didn't work saying the cities would flood in in in 10 years like gore said well then
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:05:00.480]  just say the world ends just do whatever they say or you're dead i want to say brain force is great
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:07.120]  i want to say turbo force is amazing it is but if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.760]  is it the fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what i'm talking about fish oil
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:18.240]  is liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there you've got the children's you've
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:22.320]  got the adults you've got the krill oil if you're gonna get the full effect the fish oil and the
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.480]  children's are really strong they don't give you the burpees but krill oils is the best and it'll
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:30.320]  give you the damn burps and i'm sorry you want something like this you don't get stuff for free
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.040]  the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good it in my view i'm not a medical statement here but let me
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.920]  tell you something i eat five droplets of krill oil before i go to bed i'm seeing santa claus that
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:51.280]  night so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:55.680]  but you notice i just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie to you i just
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:07.120]  can't do it
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:19.760]  the world is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those who look on and do nothing
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:26.640]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance we now take you live
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:56.080]  to the central texas commence center it's alex jones
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:03.600]  all right we have a lot of stunning big breaking news and quite frankly so much of it has come in
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:13.120]  that i'm going to try to refocus because this news is so momentous and come back in about five
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.120]  minutes after this key report and cover it i was going to post report next hour but it's a very
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:22.400]  important report i'm going to play it now and then i'm going to give you the new breaking news that
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:29.840]  has just come out that just went live on news wars dot com and info wars dot com and paul's new
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:35.840]  great site that i'm really really proud of summit dot news and again paul still writes for us we're
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:42.800]  good buddies i want to explain this it my idea a years ago was paul you need to do your own thing
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:48.480]  part of the time so you feel good about it so you have fun so your own personality because you've
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.040]  been working with me 19 years and i can tell sometimes you don't want to be in my shadow and
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.200]  you're not in my shadow and sometimes you get penalized because of all the demonization i've
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:03.840]  been under i'd like you to be your own person which he took like a duck to water over or a fish to
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:10.720]  water and he's like well but yeah i don't even plug summit then because uh you know that's mine
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:15.280]  and i don't want any help on it and i just and it's very successful it's had millions of visitors
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:20.480]  in just the first three weeks but uh no i i am going to plug it and i am proud of it because
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:25.680]  that's what real leadership is is building the next generation and the next generation
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:30.560]  and seeing them launch things and it's a good looking site like for TV viewers click on one of
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:38.720]  the articles really good nice design i'm gonna have paul to redesign info wars for me but that's
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:44.480]  what it's all about there's a lot of news at summit dot news that is not on info wars dot com
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:50.800]  or news wars dot com so please bookmark that and here's the even better part about it which is a
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:57.440]  i foresaw that he platforming coming paul doing his own thing and out there that gets around all
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:02.400]  the censors and controllers more and so it's not getting censored on twitter or facebook are blocked
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:07.200]  and and so they want to try to censor it they'll have to make up their new story about paul but
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.960]  they don't just get to attach it to me because i have nothing to do with it oh the fact that
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.200]  you know paul's sitting in the nest and he's already done a lot of good stuff and i just kind
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:21.040]  of came over and just kicked him out of the nest because that's what i want to do look i'll be honest
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:29.680]  to the audience i don't want to be doing this in 10 years and it's not that i'm even lazy it's that
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:34.720]  this is all i do i sleep i have dreams about the new world order all i do is fight them but you know

[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.840]  feel good now let's go ahead and go to greg rees's report and we'll be back with the really big news
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:50.800]  stay with us islam is an ideology based on the teachings of the quran and the hadith while it
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:57.280]  is taught that the quran is the literal word of god as taught by the prophet muhammad we know that
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:04.720]  it was written after muhammad died it was assembled and officially released during the first three
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:13.760]  caliphates by a priest class of islamic warlords curiously several of the symbols chosen to
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:21.360]  represent islam were prominent symbols in the roman catholic church such as the babelonian symbol
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:33.440]  for ball the all-seeing eye the seal of melchizedek and the virgin mother a good muslim is expected
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:41.200]  to accept the quran and the hadith as the word of god and to emulate muhammad as the perfect man
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:48.480]  and as you study these books to learn how muhammad lived his life you will learn that the great
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:58.400]  prophet was a slave owner a spousal abuser a pedophile and a polygamist the quran will teach
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:06.480]  you to fight and enslave all non-believers and to never be friends with jews or christians
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:14.800]  the quran will teach you that going to war against jews and christians is virtuous and that war is
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:27.200]  deceit according to islam lying to non-believers is a virtue lying is such a virtue in islam
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:34.880]  that there are four different varieties taught takia for example is a lie to advance the cause
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:43.760]  of islam by gaining the trust of non-believers when muhammad died the islamic priest class
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:50.880]  made it their priority to subjugate all muslims to murder rape and enslave the non-believers
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:13:02.800]  and establish severe islamic law in every land on earth over the next 1400 years millions of
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:10.800]  christians and jews were taken as slaves judeo christian societies were destroyed and replaced
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:18.560]  with islam when roam finally retaliated they ultimately failed to take back the holy lands
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:25.840]  the crusades were brief and mild compared to the islamic caliphates and yet most americans hear
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:32.800]  all about the crusades but nothing about the islamic caliphates we are often told there is no such
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:41.920]  thing as jihad this should be alarming to anyone outside of islam the islamic ideology of conquest
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:50.800]  has inspired other monsters in history when the kkk was reformed in 1915 it was modeled after islam
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:58.000]  and their doctrine was named the chloran which according to clan traditions means chloran
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:05.600]  during world war two the nazi ss converted to islam and aligned themselves with the muslim
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:12.800]  brotherhood with much help from barack obama the muslim brotherhood has infiltrated the democratic
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:21.680]  party in america ilhan omar roshida talib and keith ellison identify themselves with islam
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:28.560]  they were sworn into congress using the koran which means they can legally lie to the american
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:35.440]  people so long as it benefits islam they are openly aligned with organizations that support

[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:15.760]  civilian non-believers is justified moderate muslims claim the koran is misunderstood and that
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:22.480]  inspiring jihad is not its purpose but the difference between a religion that accidentally
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:30.480]  inspires mass murder and one that deliberately inspires mass murder is meaningless islam
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:37.120]  will never stop and eventually the need to defend our american way of life will outweigh

[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:49.120]  cover but i want to open the phones up for first-time callers who are muslims
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:55.120]  and who think i'm wrong about all these islamic attacks and who think maybe shri lanka wasn't
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:01.040]  muslims like cnn saying seriously because i have a gentleman who i respect i know who he is i know
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:06.720]  people that actually know him who's in the army decorated and injured the military uh they plan
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:11.200]  to set him up in the ford hood thing he exposed that ci operation i don't know if i can go this far
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:15.840]  he does know a lot of people that i know uh who i was able to confirm uh and i'm just gonna leave it
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:22.400]  at that we're gonna have zachary clay won joining us and you know he's maraca and comes from a
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:29.280]  prominent family and of course places like maraca or places like jordan they leave christians alone
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:33.520]  and they're more cultured and all the rest of it and i get north africa's barbarous the middle east
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:39.280]  and so the whole world's been barbarous but he was trying to get on the show yesterday when i was
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:42.800]  you know going after islam and how the left's allied with it and you know covering up these
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.280]  attacks and saying hey what about the cia and the left always funding radical islam and i'm like
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:53.520]  well you got me there that's true that's been going on pre trump and trump's been trying to stop that
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:59.200]  and get saudi arabia to quit it and so he is a smart guy from the inside i mean he knows a lot of
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:04.480]  famous people whose names i'm not you know wanting to name and by famous i mean interesting people
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:11.680]  in the military interesting people in politics interesting people in space exploration i mean i
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:18.160]  mean people like louis fair con just one name i can say but a lot of others so he's an interesting
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:23.200]  guy and he has given us a lot of good information that that wasn't classified but then tied him with
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:30.400]  the stuff already had so he's a smart guy um it's just that i mean i think we should not show the
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:37.680]  other side but but but get a perspective on what is it like to be a muslim who doesn't want to blow
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.760]  people up and kill people and who doesn't want to do this stuff to women because there are a lot of
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:48.320]  muslims that are like that and and you call them i guess heretics or or or maybe not the thing is a
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:54.480]  lot of muslims will call them heretics and come after them so i want to open the phones up specifically
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:59.600]  for muslims you could be kind of american black muslims that's have a different vein you could be
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:05.440]  a sufti you could be a shia you could be a suni i think that's pretty much all the big groups alawite
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:14.480]  i mean i guess suni's 79 shei it's like 19 percent you got another two percent that's other groups
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:19.760]  i think i got that right so i've studied this more than your average your average person but
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:24.800]  don't know as much as somebody like zachery clay won he'll be joining us
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:32.800]  that's coming up but i want to hit these other stories here in just a moment uh some good news
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:41.760]  though that's also some bad news you know that info wars was number one in the news app on apple
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:46.480]  and so they just banned it you still get it on android and then if they banned that you still
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:51.840]  got it on that phone till you upgrade it that's at info wars dot com forward slash show info
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:24:01.600]  wars dot com forward slash out but you know that but take cloud tv with a k that obviously owns
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:08.960]  a lot of other stations programs and things that trump's been promoting like one american news
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:18.960]  network and things and it is trending the fastest growing portal to tv and the internet
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:26.880]  we launched a new page as you know a few months ago on
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:34.320]  a site that only has like 30 something million users but it was still a lot of users because we were
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:40.400]  very very high up with our old page we built seven years ago uh but we're going to number one
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:47.520]  number one in 20 trending but number one in news uh with our rocu system and all that was
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:50.880]  was just them putting our icon up and then linking through to our stream we send them
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.760]  so they're selling a box they're selling a subscription they're they're making money
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.280]  off our content but oh the media said that's one last place he's on we've got to ban that
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.360]  well cloud tv called me up and they said you know you're on with us
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.600]  and they said you're already only been with us a year you're already like number two
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:22.160]  out of thousands of feeds rt the blaze everybody well we're now been number one and what's happening
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:31.520]  is that it's just expanding out from there it's just expanding out from there where we're growing
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:36.080]  to where we're going to be have more viewers than everybody on there basically at current growth
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:41.200]  rates and for whatever reason that's what happens with any tv station or radio station or system we go on
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.560]  so that's an exciting thing it's not about oh look we're number one on another platform
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:58.400]  it's that the public wants this it shows the globalist propaganda and brainwashing
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:02.800]  isn't working that's the good news is this is a real poll or a real gauge
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:11.520]  and it shows us what's really happening so here's the toll free number to join us if you are a

[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.040]  listener you owe it to yourself your family and anyone else who just wants to be aware of the
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:04.800]  memory holing via 1984 of the dominant operating system that made us so successful
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:14.000]  go to info wars.com or news wars.com to see jamie white's article that links to a tweet by
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.560]  paul watson evidence shows google's shocking deletion of christianity by the way apple's
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:26.800]  done this they're all doing it tech giant celebrates earth day but completely snubs
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:36.800]  east or sunday and notice they then use the symbol of the sun when the sun's coming back into
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:44.160]  easter and you click on it it's a whole video let's do that about the sun and about the equinox and
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:49.600]  all the rest of it they'll take the most obscure leftist and make a whole big deal about it with
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:56.560]  the google doodle but christian holidays now are expunged and erased and then the clintons the
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:03.920]  obamas all of them say oh we're so sorry easter worshipers got hurt by terrorists but they won't
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:12.320]  say muslims and maybe we should just click on the doodle right there that's a play button right
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:19.840]  there in the middle yeah let's let's let's see the propaganda nothing to do with christianity
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:26.000]  nothing to do with christ it's a pelican the wall the wandering albatross
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:33.680]  so when you click on earth day you you learn about the pelican and how it's in danger if you
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:38.240]  don't give your rights up to the Rothschilds or to the clintons or the globalists you're all dead
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:44.080]  to aoc the earth is gone in 12 years we're all dead in 12 years just just just do what they say
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:50.480]  and so paul and it's in the article and put that on screen because my eyes are okay but
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:54.800]  they're not that good anymore to read this has all these different holidays that the google's just
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:40:00.160]  made up and they'll show muslim holidays and they'll show buddhist holidays and they'll show but they
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:07.200]  don't show christian holidays no no no no no sir they'll show japanese holidays they'll
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:14.400]  show chinese holidays but they won't show a christian holiday because google is anti christian google
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:22.720]  is evil stories up on info wars dot com tech giant google celebrated the globalist created
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:29.600]  earth day on its homepage on monday but chose to ignore eastern sunday christianity's holiest day
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:36.320]  when christ rose again i forget the keys to hell and death what does that tell you like what is it
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:43.040]  about christianity that google covers up islamic terror google covers everything up but not christianity
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:51.120]  it just puts it into the phantom zone rather than show a cross even colored eggs or even
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:55.520]  eastern bunny google showed nothing on its homepage acknowledging the eastern holiday
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:00.480]  but it sure made the effort to celebrate earth day which promotes the idea that humans are the
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:06.800]  scourge of the planet google's decision to ignore eastern is blatant and obvious when you consider
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:11.440]  the litany of obscure and little known holidays google chose to celebrate such as
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:21.360]  dunga sina's 73rd birthday teacher's day and the 100th anniversary of baowans
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:28.800]  all said google which acknowledges earth day in a myriad of other obscure days chose to
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:35.280]  acknowledge did not choose to acknowledge easter precisely nothing and that's what they do of course
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:38.480]  this is part of the establishment's larger campaign to arrest christianity from history
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.040]  and the cultural consciousness for example former president obama and presidential
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:48.080]  loser hillary clinton referred to the hundreds of christian victims of shri lankan easter bombings
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:54.880]  as easter worshipers all in unison dehumanizing christians additionally just look out the media
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:00.640]  covered the shri lankan terror attacks versus the christ church attack where they downplayed
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:05.440]  islam's role with the bombings but then blamed all white people for the mass shooting in new

[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:16.320]  recently and and and just i mean what do you make for most muslim countries being nine nine percent
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:23.360]  muslim i mean that's just that's just what they want like like you you you've mentioned it before i
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:32.480]  don't disagree with you they just only want muslim in their country well you know lebanon
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:36.000]  used to be majority christian and then and then they the christians live side by side of muslims
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.560]  but you know there's been an exponential increase in attacks on christians in lebanon now
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:48.720]  what is it there's been a we put the headline back up um i don't just believe the bbc but it
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.360]  but it's true that there's been exponential lebanon christian village hit by multiple suicide
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:58.800]  attacks so you're right that you could say lebanon's almost a model of christians and muslims living
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:04.000]  in in somewhat peace comparatively but that's now that's now stopping i'm sure that did actually
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.600]  happen it was most likely an outsider i know lebanese people you never hear of uh of any any
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:14.400]  not only lebanese just shia they really don't do that now i agree with that it's usually people
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:19.920]  funded what out of saudi arabia or wherever or iran that come in and and i agree it's always
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:25.360]  those groups but how are they then able to come into these muslim areas and get muslims to then
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:31.920]  basically go along with the radical takeover i mean they really just brainwash you see you see
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:37.520]  what the radical muslims do they target they target famous rich people young guys from london
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:41.120]  they bring them in they just brainwash and they tell them this is the religion when it's just a
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:46.160]  lie it's just it's just not how it goes down but what you're saying is true the cia the leptis
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:52.560]  foundations have been going out for 50 years and handing out millions of textbooks to is to arabic
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:57.600]  children teaching them four plus four you know four hand grenades plus four machine guns equals
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:02.800]  kill the infidel so why do you think the west if you agree with me has been actually trying to
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:12.160]  radicalize islam the west doesn't isn't here in america i mean certain globalist groups have been
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:20.400]  trying to radicalize islam you know man they just they probably just think that they want
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:24.800]  the they just need one religion in the world and that's just not going to happen well that's the
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:28.800]  albert pike plan is actually get christians and muslims to kill each other and then bringing
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:32.880]  the lucifer religion that i think you're on target there i think you're on target i think i
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:37.200]  overcompensate because the media defends radical islam so much it covers up for it that it makes
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:43.840]  me attack anybody that's a muslim and i'm just going with my gut here but i but i do see a larger
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:50.080]  hidden hand manipulating it thank you haddie who's up next here
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:58.000]  here is muslim from lebanon uh yeah let's go and we'll go to moan a minute but iran
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:03.920]  iran excuse me from texas uh you're on the air go ahead what's your view on all this
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:12.000]  hello hi hello um first of all i just want to thank you for having me on here thank you and
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:17.280]  yes and i just you know and it's crazy because for a very long time i've been listening to you
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:23.200]  and when it comes to politics the left and all the newer orders that i read some of your work
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:29.760]  i agree with you but when it comes to i guess it's mainly from your other co-hosts like joseph
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:36.880]  paul watson where they kind of they have they have slandered and demonized my religion into
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:45.120]  simply as a cult but as i as i as i've been on articles commenting many people um you know beyond
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:49.760]  the comments and um kind of you know just cannot challenge you just having a dialogue
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:55.040]  just trying to show that hey i practice my religion i read my read the quran the students
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:54:03.120]  i read to all that stuff for so long and i i see no i see no i see nothing nothing evil so it just
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:10.240]  dawned upon me well that's the paradox why do you think oh i mean obama did fund the
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:15.200]  era of spring to put isis and al-qaeda in charge of all these countries that were not against the us
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:21.120]  and let people live in peace i mean i see the the left trying to fund radical hardcore
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:24.800]  aggressive islam that's just going to cause a world war and everybody killing each other
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:28.880]  i mean maybe you disagree with that but i mean do you have any comments on the left's alliance with
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:37.600]  expansionist islam yes um my take on it is i i would say it all started from 1948
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:41.680]  when they founded israel the whole point because when you because when you look at
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:46.560]  but even before then the middle east wasn't that it wasn't as dismantled as it is now
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:51.840]  but soon you added israel i had none against you i love you i have to do this i know i do
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:57.040]  a sprint when you add when you add that the zionist state and their whole goal is to
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:05.040]  control and consume all of all of the lebanon area which is the lebanon palestine um jordan
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:11.120]  is serious area then that's kind of how it started like i guess in my in my perspective
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:17.680]  it's like this whole tired judeo christ judeo christian type of alliance of um bless bless
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:21.680]  ron you've said something very true here and i'm not against israel itself what you said's true
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:26.720]  people are asking me because it came out in roth child documents that came out in wikileaks
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:32.480]  that soros wants to basically break israel up but have a huge war that consumes the middle east
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:38.880]  and people emailed me and they called me and you know i saw the news well wait jones is saying
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:44.720]  that the roth childs are against netanyahu they publicly tried to finance against him
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:50.160]  they own the economist magazine saying saying that bb's the devil whether you like netanyahu
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:54.320]  or hating there's different factions in israel and the point is he just wants israel to be
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:58.720]  there and successful the roth childs have a plan to destabilize the middle east they
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:04.000]  believe bring in world government out of the crisis and make a world government form around
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:10.320]  that it gets very biblical and very occultic and but it's actually true uh that that that that that
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:15.360]  their plan is to use israel to destabilize and trigger a world war it gets into albert pike
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:21.760]  and all the rest of it it's crazy and this still like in this kind of alibi further
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:27.200]  and it kind of goes that's like what happened after nine eleven um when as soon as nine eleven
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:32.080]  happened we wanted we went straight into the invasion of iraq and we you know we we already
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:35.680]  knew what happened before and then that was used to destabilize the middle east and then bring in
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:40.720]  the arab spring and the collapse of the european borders and then and then you what you happen
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:47.600]  is you have a generation of iraq and syrian youths who don't who they like they see america as the
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:52.720]  enemy because you simply have because you see the america no i get it and pnax says it clash of
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:59.120]  civilizations go in attack the muslims kill a bunch of them and then get them to attack us
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:07.360]  i agree with you so what do we do about that honestly my thing is we need to we need to separate
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:15.760]  this barbaric occultic psychopathic form of islam which these people who use who use my religion
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:22.240]  as a political agendic ways we need to separate that from that to what is i'm truly is the same
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:27.040]  religion that i practice the religion i've read about same same that you know my you know my my
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:31.520]  own uncle read about that's what we need to do it got to perform what people have blurred between
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:35.520]  iran you're really smart you're you're you're so i said change my mind about this and i meant

[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  you
[01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:16.000]  you
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:28.000]  you
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:46.160]  all right aram is a muslim he's calling in from texas
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:50.560]  and and he's saying these terror attacks are not his religion
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:56.080]  and then i get he can argue look at the islamic countries being invaded i see all that and i've
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:02.400]  been against that offensively people shouldn't do that and we'll talk about the cia and other
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:07.360]  groups that have famously been caught funding radical islam so what's the larger plan for
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:11.440]  this clash of civilizations that dick cheney wrote a back in the wrote about
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:20.240]  about the peanut documents back in 2000 so continuing aram with our points go ahead
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:26.480]  um yes you know and like i was a one time i was saying that i was thinking like what's the ultimate
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:32.880]  goal and i said like well you think about it this this is less this is satanic the satanic
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:41.840]  um Lutheran um no no no um no luciferan um type of um like lumen i kind of all this all these little
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:48.720]  these little secret societies the whole their whole goal is to like is to um corrupt almost
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:55.040]  all these religions to end up fighting each other and to make them the worst that they ever is um
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:00.000]  and as you noticed it with christ church they even tell you or charlie manson tried to kill
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.600]  people and blame it on black people to cause a race war yeah and it's the same thing with this guy
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:10.960]  at christ church he said he wants a class of civilizations so what do you think comes out of
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:20.320]  that though i see you know i like when company well what happened in christ church was a um
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:25.840]  it was it was a horrific you know the horrific it was a horrific shock and the whole you know
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:31.760]  whole muslim world who you know whether they were you know hypocrites or transfers say that they
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:37.360]  they are muslims but of course they're not and those are true muslims they feel sad but then
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:42.800]  you look at what happened in Sri Lanka what happened to the Notre Dame cathedral i personally
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:47.200]  was sad about that you know when when when those when these killings happen i stand with my christian
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:52.000]  brothers and my sister so you know because they would do the same thing for me hopefully you know
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:57.120]  and that's the whole point that in meeting that's the whole point it needs to happen
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:01.120]  because you got you got too many elitists too many higher powers trying to
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:08.480]  well we know this we know this why do you think google and apple are banning christianity and
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:13.680]  just removing it from the history books because there is an anti christian bent in the left and
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:18.160]  that's why they're supporting radical islam is because they want it to go after christianity
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:25.360]  i guess i'll say that's the same i guess the same thing as they they want christians to go after
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:30.240]  muslims um you know just sure so it's like it's it's it's like from russia with love where there's
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:36.400]  the three chinese fighting fish uh and and the the smart one waits till the others almost kill
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:41.120]  each other and then he goes in and takes them out i mean that really is there is definitely
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:49.600]  a evil black hand or a unseen hand definitely manipulating this class of civilizations i mean
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:54.640]  have you read what albert pike wrote about how they're going to cause world a world war between
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:58.560]  muslims and christians and then out of that the true religion luciferianism supposedly you're
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:04.320]  going to take over i haven't read his actual work but i've heard but i've read many about
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:10.800]  only biographies of him and to know yes that is um it's a true agenda you know he was the founder of
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:16.160]  the kkk yes there's a lot of weirdness going on there all right i appreciate your call
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:21.120]  or um interesting points and i just want to give people a fair shake here because here's the
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:25.520]  i don't want to kill muslims i don't want to go over there and wipe people out but when george
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:30.160]  soros is funding open borders and bringing people in and then they they're saying well this guy's
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:36.080]  a muslims he's allowed to rape a ten-year-old girl it's the left's the cucking infatuation
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:40.480]  with the worst people that are in islam but there are people that say they're christian that are bad
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:44.400]  what if they were all protected by the left and christians could do whatever they wanted it it's
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:48.720]  you know christianity is under attack no one can deny it the question is why
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:52.480]  more your calls and our special guests straight ahead stay with us we'll get to everybody

[02:07:55.600 --> 02:08:00.480]  buddhist and human being on this planet i have several points to make but it centers around this
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:08.080]  this is a class of civilizations in order to pin us against each other so we beat each other up
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:15.520]  and the ai takeover takes over okay humans beat each other up and technology continues to progress
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:20.320]  i have many points to make i could tell you everything the history i have the timeline
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:24.640]  but this is not a debate well i'm sure folks want to hold some they'll be fine people gotta go they

[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:41.520]  and i'm just gonna go ahead and say it i'm gonna say these things i may be in trouble i may not
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:47.680]  i'm gonna marry you say it go go okay first first and foremost the first contact with osama
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:54.240]  bin laden was in 1979 when he was a new graduate from the university at jeta he got in touch with
[02:08:54.240 --> 02:09:00.000]  the u.s embassy in ankara turkey with the help of the cia and the u.s armed forces intelligence
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.600]  services he began to organize in the early 1980s and networked to raise money to recruit fighters
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:11.280]  for the afghan mujahideens when they were fighting within soviets he did that from a city in pashwar
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:16.800]  in pakistan bordering afghanistan parts of these activities were financed with production and sales
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:22.640]  of morphe the base of harrowing this was the beginning of today al-qaeda the base network led
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:29.520]  by bin laden indeed the chickens are coming home to roost for the cia and the us bosses so let's
[02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:35.200]  just go back to the mujahideen where this all started i understand what's going on with radical
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:40.800]  islam but let's not play this game we have selective amnesia did we forget about 9 11
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:46.880]  where are the wmds did we forget about libya where is that what about the creation of ices
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:53.600]  out of libya how about the two billion dollars worth of cash on palates on a c 130 going to iran
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:59.520]  there are several sects of islam several sects don't put a blanket on it there's different types
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:03.760]  there's islamic fundamentalists there's puritans there's traditionals there's modernist there's
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:08.160]  secularists there's african-american nation of islamist there's mystic sufi muslims there's
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:14.000]  refugees there's folk and popular muslims uh you know i don't blame uh baptist and lutherans for
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:18.720]  what the catholic church is doing this is a class of civilizations and the only people who are
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:24.160]  profiting profiting from this are the architects they want us to do this we're beating each other
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:30.480]  up we're degrading each other and the ai systems taking over people need to wake up muslim christian
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:35.520]  jew buddhist i don't give a damn our blood types are the same we are human beings and we could get
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:41.200]  into the ci operations because it's very relevant they're in afghanistan where's oh where's oh
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:45.600]  where's harrowing made afghanistan what do we have in this country i don't care if you're white black
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:49.520]  in the in the back hills of west virginia there's an opioid epidemic now that's what trump's trying
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:55.040]  to get out of afghanistan you're absolutely right this is deep this is deep we're all in the same
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:59.360]  stadium looking at the same game you might be looking at it we're looking at the same god if we
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:04.080]  want to play politics if we want to play checkers that's fine these guys who i'm talking to talking
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:08.960]  to are playing chess so we could get into it i got a i got a lot to get into and i'm gonna start

[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:33.920]  just keep going the tweets from barack obama and hillary clinton maybe the most despicable thing i've
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:42.400]  ever seen in my life you two snakes in the grass created that mess in libya created ices the stabilized
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:48.480]  continually uh syria and what was going on and i was at the ford hood shooting my name's zack really
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:53.040]  claw on you know who i am how's it going who's saying i know what happened you marched us down
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:58.560]  old r inside road you marched us back behind three core and you stood up and you saluted those boots
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:04.320]  those people who you gunned down you're a snake i don't care i don't care what they do i'm not
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:10.320]  going to see my family muslims are people muslims are in this country muslims are doctors police
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:19.440]  officers uh paramedics teachers neighbors widows mothers in need we're human beings this is low
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:25.520]  level stuff they we're going to the moon we're going multi-planetary and they want us to kill
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:31.440]  each other this is cia architecture and that piece i saw by greg reese pissed me off i know he's a
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:37.440]  good guy i'm not mad at him but showing planes hitting buildings showing ices fighters and
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:43.920]  showing the kkk give me a break who's underneath those hoods listen if i want to go and nitpick
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:49.760]  out of the quran we could go into the bible going to exodus 21 seven dash eight we could start nitpicking
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:54.800]  what are we doing to each other everything is a good guy you're a good we're all giving
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:59.280]  him respect come on this is this this ain't right man this is like we we got to stick together
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:03.760]  well it's good because he got you mad now you're being articulate you're a smart guy they gotta
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:06.880]  talk to on the phone sometimes so she'll continue to make your points we'll come back and take more
[02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:12.080]  calls but i agree with you that there's a globalist force trying to put the most radical out of control
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:16.880]  muslims in charge trying to create a class of civilizations what's the end game of that i agree
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:23.040]  we're all killing each other while the globalists have a breakaway civilization important people
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:28.080]  speak about saudi arabia and iran in the same sentence as muslims are you out of your mind one
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:36.400]  is shia and one is shiai they hate each other they're not the same thing obama on a c 130 without
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:42.400]  the u.s treasury knowing about it flew two billion dollars into iran trump stopped the deal and now
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:47.760]  we have kin king ben salam in the white house who's from saudi arabia buying bowling and
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:52.720]  raytheon products they're different things and your guys are using an umbrella statement it's a
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:57.440]  problem no no i know it's i mean i know that there's different groups well my whole point is i look
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:02.320]  at a map from the founding of islam and i see it taking the world over and i see once the countries
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:07.040]  are islamic they're almost 100 islamic and i don't see that under other systems i mean an
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:12.320]  earlier caller goes well people just choose to be under islam once it becomes a majority well
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:19.760]  yeah because they get killed but this is this is this is preposterous it's 2019 things are changing
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:24.480]  this is not this is listen we can't nitpick do you want me to make a five-minute piece about how
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:28.240]  cushy and it's terrible that would that would that that piece i'm sure you could show burning at
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:34.400]  the stake and you know wars and i get it i could show exodus 21 seven i could i'm not going to do
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:39.120]  that it was a different time it was a different time we guess guess what we used to also have
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:44.240]  slavery now we don't like what are we doing here we're fine i mean i think there needs to be a
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:50.800]  reformation christianity's gone from reformation and now being a leftist monster and it's not even
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:55.840]  christian anymore and then i see islam has not had a reformation other than the most radical forms
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:15:02.720]  of it is the reformation and i see the globalist cia trying to cause a radical reformation in
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:09.040]  islam to turn it into a weapon system i do see that and here and here's the big enchilada and
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:18.000]  this is a good term to use do you have you ever heard of a al pastor the taco yes okay so al pastor
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:23.840]  is a taco it just developed in central mexico that is based on shawarma and it was meat brought by
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:30.640]  lebanese immigrants to mexico let me tell you something arabs look a lot like mexicans okay so
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:35.280]  there is a crisis on the border because you got fundamentalist gangs coming through that border
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:41.600]  and we're so focused on rattle you know demonizing a religion and you're about to get a swarm but if
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:45.600]  we could work together we can we could nix this i've been a part of it i know what happened at

[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:12.000]  we'll give you his facebook up on screen here in a moment as well and see we're getting the
[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:18.000]  other perspective here on what's happening and what's going on let's go ahead now and let's
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:25.040]  take a phone call from mo in texas you're on the air mo go ahead hello can you hear me i can welcome
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:30.480]  you're on the air thank you uh can the can your man riding shotgun hear me as well he's gonna i
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:38.240]  want to kind of have a debate with him i think you might like this okay go ahead okay well uh
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:44.480]  basically to summarize your hundred percent right that these people are stealing religion they're
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:49.920]  thieves of religion for for example well everyone calls the illuminati but basically the point is
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:56.880]  is that uh you know international banking and usury was outlawed for christians and muslims
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:22:02.080]  for a while but then they switched and they started giving international uh banking a try and taking
[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:07.360]  loans in order to start off they took a loan from the existing international banking order
[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:12.240]  and so basically they are all connected 100 percent they're friends and they work together
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:23.680]  together 100 the the vatican the mecca based islam probably also turkey as well as the uh left wing
[02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:30.800]  zionist and just real quick if i can remember it says in the old testament if you don't work then
[02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:36.800]  you don't get to eat so how can you be a jew and believe in communism it doesn't make any sense and
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:43.680]  then also remember it says in the bible that no man lives and doesn't sin and yet the vatican
[02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:49.120]  says the pope is infallible doesn't make any sense and then on top of the pope said last year that
[02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:54.720]  there is no hell exactly that's obviously against the bible so those are fake no offense but that
[02:22:54.720 --> 02:22:58.880]  is a fake christian organization there's a lot of good catholic there's a lot of good muslim there's
[02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:03.120]  a lot of good jews no i totally agree with what you're saying exactly it's true you can't judge
[02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:07.680]  muslims you can't judge jews you can't judge catholics christians whatever because they're
[02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:12.160]  good people in all those groups but the leadership is what i'm saying is bad i mean the vatican
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:19.360]  right now is literally run by a guy that protects pedophiles 100 so basically what is going on right
[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:25.040]  now is first of all the all the muslims out there i want you to understand something
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:30.800]  when you if you're a muslim that means you believe in the quran it says in the quran
[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:36.080]  that muhammad is dead it doesn't say that muhammad went to heaven and it doesn't say muhammad ever
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:42.880]  breathed life into anything and it doesn't say muhammad is coming back however in the quran
[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:49.280]  it says that jesus is still alive that jesus is the word of god that jesus is the spirit of god
[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:54.720]  and that jesus is alive and that jesus is coming back and to to judge the world not only that this
[02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:58.240]  is that so then why do we see these different muslim groups blowing up churches and throwing
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:04.560]  down crosses they are fake muslims the same way there are fake jews and there are fake christians
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:08.560]  the real that's us so our strategy you keep asking so what are we going to do what we're
[02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:13.600]  going to do what we need to do is we need to instead of saying that we are against muslims
[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:18.880]  we need to say hey it says in the quran that you're supposed to believe in jesus well it does
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:22.800]  say that i appreciate your call i'm impressed by these muslim college i'll just be honest
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:25.840]  uh the way they're forming their points everything and i've actually read the quran it does say that
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:32.720]  that and i agree with what our guest is saying zachery claywon is that the globalists think
[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:36.960]  we're obsolete and say ai's taking over they're gonna get rid of everybody i mean that is a fact
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:42.800]  smartphones are making our kids not have relationships is it everyone's dying everyone's
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:47.440]  getting autism everyone's getting cancer at record rates there is a greater evil above all this i
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:52.720]  just don't want to watch the leftist defense of radical islam and its expansion and then the constant
[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:58.960]  hatred of christianity that's where i then uh go on the rampage against uh what i see islam uh as
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:04.080]  today but exactly what he said that was pretty smart caller absolutely a smart carline is correct
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:09.200]  i mean come on we're we're a family we're a human being family everyone has had dysfunction in a
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:14.320]  family an aunt here a brother here a kid there listen we went our separate ways at the at the

[02:29:50.640 --> 02:30:02.240]  it's too late 800 213 92 64 there is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist
[02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:08.640]  pro-free market pro-western speech all across the world and i don't want to say i'm honored but in a
[02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:14.800]  way i am to have been chosen first last year to be the platform then they set the precedent now if
[02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:20.800]  you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert they take you off the internet
[02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:26.880]  now google announced just today that they're not going to take christian advertising of most types
[02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:32.880]  on their platform because it upsets the san francisco google employees our country in the world more
[02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:40.480]  and more is in the grip of anti-free speech hyper leftist anti-human transhumanists who literally
[02:30:40.480 --> 02:30:46.880]  think they own and run our lives and if we keep bowing to these cults the cancer that is san francisco
[02:30:46.880 --> 02:30:52.000]  and many of these big universities is going to be the operating system of the planet humanity must
[02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:59.760]  awaken and say no to these control freaks i want to say brain force is great i want to say turbo
[02:30:59.760 --> 02:31:06.400]  force is amazing it is but if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish
[02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:11.760]  oil is better than it and that's an example of what i'm talking about fish oil is liquid energy
[02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:17.360]  brain body heart the cleanest the best out there we've got the children's we've got the adults we've
[02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:21.360]  got the krill oil if you're gonna get the full effect the fish oil and the children's are really
[02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:25.600]  strong they don't give you the burpees but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps
[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:30.400]  and i'm sorry you want something like this you don't get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic
[02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:33.680]  it's so good in my view i'm not a human medical statement here but let me tell you something
[02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:38.320]  i eat five culottes of krill oil before i go to bed i'm seeing santa claus that night
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:44.640]  so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is
[02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:51.120]  so we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice i'm just obsessed because whatever
[02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:58.560]  the best is we've got i just can't lie to you i just can't do it there are thousands of ideologies
[02:31:58.560 --> 02:32:03.200]  out there hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist
[02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:09.040]  info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist that's why the globalists are obsessed
[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:14.960]  with it trying to shut it down i didn't invent all this i went and researched the renaissance americana
[02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:19.920]  and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's
[02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:25.360]  super popular like it's always been that's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so
[02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:30.800]  desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night that's since chills up my spine
[02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:35.520]  so whatever you do continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products at
[02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:40.080]  info wars store dot com by spreading the articles by spreading the videos and by praying for this
[02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:45.280]  operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment for myself and the
[02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:51.360]  whole info wars family i want to thank all of you for what you've done because without you info wars
[02:32:51.360 --> 02:33:07.280]  it's nothing you are the info war and i salute you you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:07.280 --> 02:33:22.320]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones you keep saying you've got something
[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:31.760]  for me something you call love but confess but here's the bottom line
[02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:36.880]  any powerful belief system or institution is going to get corrupted in use for power
[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:44.880]  those are different phases of islam christianity judaism but we know there is this godless
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:52.240]  transhumanist system that is actually not godless they believe in the devil and their god wants the
[02:33:52.240 --> 02:34:00.160]  end of the family into humanity so i'll give islam this and it goes to extremes but it's muslims in
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:05.920]  europe getting the sex education of five year olds teaching them how to give blowjobs literally banned
[02:34:05.920 --> 02:34:12.960]  some muslims protesting and saying no and it is the muslims that are standing up against drag queen
[02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:18.080]  story times and stuff like that so that's that old paradox though here's the left that wants to
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:25.200]  sexualize kids and then they're sitting there promoting islam even the most radical forms of it
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:34.480]  that would kill them just for sex out of wedlock or whatever so it's all just a big giant mess
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:39.920]  but there's no doubt the left is anti christian so it sees islam in all its forms and permutations
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:47.680]  very diverse as something it wants to overwrite the west with this is not going to go well i can
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:55.760]  tell you it's going to be very explosive our guest is here with us zachary clay won whistleblower
[02:34:57.280 --> 02:35:02.640]  rambo dot z aq on facebook and i wanted to be able to continue but these callers have been
[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:10.640]  really holding patiently so let's go to abdull and then amar and e and everybody else abdull thanks
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:18.400]  for holding her on the air go ahead hi good day sir hi welcome thank you for having me on yeah i just
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:23.440]  want to phone as a muslim to validate some of the things you've been saying and endorse some of the
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:28.960]  things you've been saying your because the biggest issue right now is what you said about muslim
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:34.640]  leadership not speaking out against this type of things that are going on and the atrocities and
[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:40.000]  they need to be put on blast because there's a whole there's a whole network not just in the UK
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:46.800]  but particularly in your country to do with the universities yeah i think uh Berkeley and all
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:55.840]  them places them where there is an intellectual elite within the academic muslim world and they've
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:36:02.240]  had a program going on for at least i know for at least 30 years here in england because 30 years
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:07.440]  ago he was taking his show called the man's coming over to england talking about you know setting up
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:12.800]  a muslim community isn't it and it is a big program i don't want to go into all the geopolitical
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:17.920]  issues around you're saying the leftist is is commandeering the the the image yeah yeah look
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:24.000]  for a long time man long time they've been doing it long time and at the end of the day i think
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:29.920]  it's like like we're all judicial watching all that that's done you know all christians are not
[02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:36.080]  donate muslims all muslims donate christians yeah and i think what we're getting here is
[02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:42.640]  and the proof is there the left is taking over islam radicalizing it and using it as an operating
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:47.680]  system of dominance i think that's where you're going don't hang up but i want to get zack's
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:53.040]  taking what we're saying here is that i i think this is extraordinary i think this is the type
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:37:00.960]  of constructive conversation that needed to occur uh this is imperative and it's point blank look at
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:06.960]  the money just follow the money how you know the most radical forms of this how are they able to
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:15.120]  operate where did the money come from look at it we funded what the moderate rebels that became what
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:23.280]  ices ices so follow the money it's not these low look listen if you go to downtown los angeles
[02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:28.480]  south side of chicago there's crips there's ns 13 but those are terrorist organizations they just
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:33.760]  happen to be americans so when they're used geopolitically as chess pieces it's different
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:40.960]  this is a geopolitical fact that the the globalist and then the leftist and even under bush
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:46.720]  the right wing is using islam where the wmd's and putting the most radical ones in for a larger
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:52.000]  system so so obdual from the uk what do you think yeah this is this is what the only
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:57.200]  point i want to make because i'm nobody i've just compelled to form because i've heard a lot
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:03.120]  listen to what you said and and that's the man really who's in a position to fisticate enough
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:08.080]  has got the connections and knows the networks of the people who are doing all this is that they
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:14.000]  need to be put on blast and the so-called muslim intellectuals and theological intellectuals who
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:19.360]  say oh islam is a peaceful religion the prophet never done this shows because i know it's dead
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:26.080]  in the in islam about the prophet never done any offensive violence the prophet uh disassociated
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:30.960]  himself with people who chop people's heads off let's just expand on this let's just expand on this
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:34.960]  england lets ices fighters come back and gives them better treatment than veterans
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:41.040]  so the people running england want to protect these worst forms of islam you could say then
[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:49.040]  to basically slander islam allow that to expand like brennan converted to it and then use that
[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:54.080]  evil form of islam to have the west rise up and smash it in a giant war and that's clearly
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:39:00.160]  where they're going thanks for the call jack a quick comment for another call this is extraordinary
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:10.000]  i think this conversation is uh is going to be um wow i'm kind of overwhelmed i'm a little emotional
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:13.840]  right now this is exactly the conversation that needed to happen as i was watching that piece
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:18.560]  yesterday i know you guys were coming from a good place but i'm like the picture needs to be painted
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:24.160]  because we're human beings and as we fight each other and we degrade each other technology is
[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:29.120]  advancing and i know we're losing our humanity we're losing our genetics we're all dying right
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:36.000]  now it's true we're this we had to counterbalance the leftist cover-up with something that invokes
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.960]  and shows the dirty side of something to then have the debate they know the muslims will fight
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:45.680]  their warriors they know the americans will fight their warriors so when you get the two
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:51.200]  toughest individuals on the planet to fight it's over the chinese have no conscious they have the
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:56.640]  they just want consumerism they just want money but it's going to move to an ai movement we have
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:40:01.280]  to have that's right and ai is threatened by people that are spiritual and care about ideology over
[02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:05.840]  things exactly the consumerist and another thing wrong with things folks when you worship it it's
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:11.280]  evil those that only want materialism are threatened by christians muslims real jews and others
[02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:18.080]  that actually care about ideas those tweets by barack obama and hillary clinton are like uh
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:22.880]  i don't know like that might be the most evil thing i've ever seen what do you think about
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:28.880]  i'm all calling an easter worshipers listen let me tell you something that guy i have a problem
[02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:33.920]  with that guy and secret service listen i i read my oath of enlistment i'm i'm not a threat to
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:39.200]  anybody those two people need to be tried for treason and not just then there's a lot of them
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:45.520]  and i'm dead serious this is not this they they attempted to ruin this country because their
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:50.400]  karmatic balance is off and they got caught and i know trump knows what i'm saying it's difficult
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:55.200]  to operate in that space but believe me these people are not our friends i witnessed it at
[02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:59.600]  fort hood on several occasions and i fought back and i don't know what's going to happen to me but
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:05.200]  i'm not putting up with it it's not it's not okay it's not okay well never i mean they are helping
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:10.400]  stage terror attacks okay who's up home the next longest here we'll go to a mar next but it's ian
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:14.800]  right now in arizona you're on the air you say you're a muslim convert currently christian
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:21.760]  on islamic terror whatever that tells what that means uh no i think he just i think he just uh
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:26.400]  miss wrote it down i just said that i wanted to talk about the the terror attacks actually uh
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:33.520]  alex i wanted to talk about two or three things one i want to kind of uh we uh just kind of say
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:36.960]  some of the same things that some of the other callers said and i did want to talk about the
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:39.840]  bombing that just happened sure you go ahead and start we'll come back to you after the break and
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:47.120]  i promise we'll get to a mar it's a chef and a showmer go ahead okay thank you uh and i wanted
[02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:50.560]  to say too zack man i was just wondering when i was gonna hear from you again you're one of my
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:55.600]  favorite favorite guests that alex has on but uh the first thing i want to say but we were talking
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:42:00.880]  about uh earlier which we're talking about with some of the other callers about jesus i uh i used
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:06.800]  to be a muslim also muslim for eight years and the same even i mean like you said it's real complex
[02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:11.200]  there's different you have different the left and the right different versions of the same thing
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:17.200]  but one thing that i noticed was that jesus is the most mentioned person in the quran and like you
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:23.360]  said jesus has spoke of in the quran as being a sinless man and being this uh you know even
[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:27.600]  though they just try to call him a prophet when you read the quran and you read it several times
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:33.600]  you can't help but notice that jesus is like i don't want to say more powerful but yeah he's
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:37.920]  he's that guy you know what i mean and so even the quran admits that so that was one thing that
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:42.160]  i wanted to validate that the caller had said earlier uh i've read the quran too i know it's
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:45.440]  true a and don't hang up you'll give you about a minute or something on the side and i promise a

[02:46:55.600 --> 02:47:06.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:21.680]  you are either with the republic or against it resistance to titans is obedience to god it's alex
[02:47:21.680 --> 02:47:26.800]  jones let's hear from bridget gabriel who will go back to our muslim callers and we've an active
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:30.640]  military fellow that must argue with jack but here's what she had to say in front of the un
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:38.080]  there are 1.2 billion muslims in the world today of course not all of them are radicals the majority
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:46.080]  of them are peaceful people the radicals are estimated to be between 15 to 25 percent according
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:53.120]  to all intelligent services around the world that leaves 75 percent of them peaceful people
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:59.520]  but when you look at 15 to 25 percent of the world muslim population you're looking at 180 million
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:06.640]  to 300 million people dedicated to the destruction of western civilization that is as big of the
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:14.080]  united states so why should we worry about the radicals 15 to 25 percent because it is the radicals
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:19.920]  that kill because it is the radicals that behead and massacre when you look throughout history
[02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:26.000]  when you look at all the lessons of history most germans were peaceful yet the nazis drove the
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:33.840]  agenda and as a result 60 million people died almost 14 million in concentration camps six
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:46.080]  million were jews the peaceful majority were irrelevant i just judge the treebots fruits
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:51.280]  and islam's expanding the left's allied with it i was against invading those countries i'm against
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:55.440]  putting the radicals in i totally oppose the law i see there's a global agenda manipulating it
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:49:00.320]  doesn't matter somebody's got a hatchet and it controls islam the globalist habit in its hand
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:05.840]  it's still the hatchet's hitting me upside the head i'd like to get my hands around the globalist
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:10.560]  throat even more than i'd rather get my hands around that hatchet and i get that islam's a big
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:14.320]  powerful religion so it's being controlled and it's like who's driving it the globalists are
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:18.320]  taking all the muslims into the seminaries and turning them into these globalist muslims which
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:23.440]  is incredibly bad i don't and i didn't say we'd have callers that disagree today but i'm gonna
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:28.880]  let schmini get in here a little while but i promise to go to uh chief in new york but first amaran
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:36.640]  georgia then sona in oklahoma uh and uh i guess i held ian over to finish his point uh with zack
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:40.800]  and we're gonna do 15 minutes the next hour our next guest host is fine with that he's awesome
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:45.360]  so will johnson coming up but he understands it overdrafts and dumps i go over so i want to keep
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:50.000]  this debate going it's very interesting i think very informative ian other points from arizona as a
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:56.320]  muslim convert who went back to christianity go ahead yes sir thank you alec and uh i just really
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:50:01.520]  wanted to get your guys take on this too so i believe that these bombings are i don't want to
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:06.000]  just say they're you know muslim terror attack but most likely they are but what i want to say is
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:09.920]  it's the same pattern the same way they're trying to make the divide and conquer what you guys were
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:15.440]  saying earlier between african-americans and white people and all the racism in mexicans at home and
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:20.240]  blaming it on trump is the same way now where all these bombings are trying to get muslim against
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:25.040]  and i'm not saying there's not already division in religion no there's real problems people do
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:30.560]  there are bad people on all sides but exactly it's being exacerbated exactly it's it's it's that
[02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:35.760]  time and we and we all know one thing i wanted to say too alec my last point was this i know this
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:40.960]  stupid thing with the with the jewish debate always people try to say either you're still or
[02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:45.520]  you're against them or this and that my point i wanted to say is this man i love all people
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:50.000]  and i don't think anything i don't have any hate for jews but one thing that i do understand
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:55.440]  what i think some of it comes from but i never hear a caller uh eloquated is that i don't have
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:59.680]  any problem with the jews but as far as their religion goes we know that they're the ones that
[02:50:59.680 --> 02:51:06.960]  do not uh accept that messiah ever came and if you rerevelations it tells us that when this
[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:11.280]  antichrist comes there's going to be the people that are waiting for messiah to come who will
[02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:15.520]  accept him as messiah and let him sit on the throne in the temple mount so i don't have a
[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:20.320]  problem with jews but i mean if i go by the bible as a christian i gotta see that they're gonna be
[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:24.240]  well there are a lot of messianic jews and the bible says they'll convert at the end but
[02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:29.200]  you're right that islam accepts jesus and judieism doesn't and so that's that's a
[02:51:29.200 --> 02:51:32.880]  that's why we have open phones this is a real debate this isn't we're not running a cult here
[02:51:32.880 --> 02:51:36.960]  we don't have talking points we're having an open discussion about the real world but just like
[02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:41.920]  islam's diverse judieism is very diverse it's like christianity thank you so much ian really
[02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:47.920]  this is a powerful discussion i gotta say muslims are really calling in and are very well spoken
[02:51:47.920 --> 02:51:51.760]  compared to most type debates we have we have great callers but usually it's like military
[02:51:51.760 --> 02:51:56.240]  police are well spoken or if you call firefighters they call in or farmers it's all real technical
[02:51:56.240 --> 02:52:01.600]  i gotta say zack the muslims on the show have been very articulate well absolutely we're just
[02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:05.280]  human beings we're you know we don't need to be classified as anything but i'm just gonna take
[02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:09.600]  a shot because columbus did listen man you need to hire me i don't care if i'm sweeping the floor
[02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:14.240]  i don't even need the income i just want to utilize the studio for a podcast we need to make
[02:52:14.240 --> 02:52:19.200]  this happen i've contributed a lot the people want it what do you say well you know we have
[02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:23.760]  to talk about that you're a smart guy and i like different debates and things but you know the problem
[02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:28.960]  is is this is a long distance race so anybody has to be if you do a show you have to always do it
[02:52:28.960 --> 02:52:33.520]  and always you know always take action and always execute we'll see we'll talk about it we're having
[02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:39.440]  a good debate here um let's uh i said i go to amar first we'll go to amar amar and georgia then
[02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:45.360]  christopher amar and georgia thanks for holding go ahead uh yeah hi i actually called because
[02:52:45.360 --> 02:52:50.480]  i want to hear the phone so your phone sounds like somebody's beating a hammer on it so just
[02:52:51.040 --> 02:52:59.680]  back off of it for a minute and start over all right is that better yes uh yeah i wanted to
[02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:04.240]  actually like reaffirm some of the stuff you said i disagree with several of the callers uh
[02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:09.600]  i don't i don't know how accurate the prompter was for my information i'm not in bosnia i was born
[02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:16.720]  there and forced to come to united states as a refugee after the civil war and uh it wasn't
[02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:22.560]  actually the service that prompted that it was the muslims putting on live national broadcasts
[02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:28.800]  that any children of a mixed family which i was because my father was a muslim and my mother was
[02:53:28.800 --> 02:53:35.760]  a surgeon uh would be killed and so my stepdad because my father had already been killed picked
[02:53:35.760 --> 02:53:40.320]  us up and we left for america and we came here and now we live here and now we're citizens
[02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:46.080]  and the thing is a lot of the stuff that uh everyone tries to push about is when being
[02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:52.640]  with appease it's not it was founded on violence it was spread through violence a thousand years of
[02:53:52.640 --> 02:53:59.600]  islamic conquest is how the uh religion was initially spread mostly over northern africa and
[02:53:59.600 --> 02:54:06.480]  my people the fog that went close to a thousand years fighting them and being enslaved by them
[02:54:06.480 --> 02:54:10.400]  and being pillaged well let me let let me raise this i would watch things like 15 years ago like
[02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:16.640]  kingdom of heaven by ridley scott and it's like the the the the the the templars are bad and the
[02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:20.400]  christians are bad and they didn't invaded the middle east well they didn't tell you it took
[02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:26.160]  400 years to push to that point and turn things around we were being invaded and so i knew history
[02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:30.880]  but i knew it wasn't really taught popularly so it was very irritating to only show one snapshot
[02:54:30.880 --> 02:54:34.960]  of what was going on with the templars at one spot where they finally got turned back
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:42.080]  instead of what really went on so i'd seen hollywood coddling islam and coddling history and then
[02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:46.720]  knowing i wasn't for the serbs i didn't know anything about serbia when the clintons were
[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:51.360]  bombing belgrade with du i studied it then and learned wait the unit midst the muslim started
[02:54:51.360 --> 02:54:57.200]  it with the croats teamed up with them they killed double what the serbs did and then i'm always only
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:55:02.560]  hearing about how those horrible serbs killed these poor muslims well i mean those serbs stopped over
[02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:09.280]  a hundred islamic invasions into uh kosovo now it's muslim now it's albanian it was captured
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:14.720]  so i appreciate your call uh and i'm sad to hear you had your your family killed we have more shows
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:21.040]  on this but zachery that's the other side of this what do you say that oh what i say is
[02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:27.440]  there's a chess board right and there's pieces and then you have players so what this individual
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:33.360]  is talking about is pieces on the chess board i'm talking about the players there's levels to this
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:40.000]  there's no no you're right geopolitically the luciferian globalists want to co-opt islam
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:45.120]  um the different elements of islam think that it's going to co-opt it those are the elites being
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:50.880]  players then you've got the people under it that are just being used this this goes so deep
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:58.800]  we're going multi-planetary if we had a quote unquote alien invasion do you think uh it matters
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:04.560]  whether you're from uh the congo or no people would stop fighting overnight we'll get a blood
[02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:10.560]  transfusion they are playing us against each other there are chess pieces and there are chess players
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:14.000]  i need people to know that and these people don't even know how to play chess they're playing
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:17.440]  checkers and they don't even know how to play checkers i know but but at the same time why is
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:22.080]  the left than trying to defend the most radical virulent forms of islam you're saying to to make
[02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:28.160]  it build up to create a crisis so they have a big war so it's complete chaos and they come in as a
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:35.040]  savior and and as we degrade technology advances the trajectory that technology is on is imperative
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:41.120]  it's going to continue it's gaining consciousness and like i said on several calls before we're
[02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:47.760]  going to have a human future or an ai future period evolution works like that this is Darwinism but
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:52.240]  they're using it and the globalists have decided we're in a post-human era stay there do 50 more

[03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:17.360]  muslims in kenya is amazing um and and especially down in mabasa where it's 80
[03:01:17.360 --> 03:01:25.200]  percent muslim um they've they've lived in perfect harmony with christian community for hundreds of
[03:01:25.200 --> 03:01:34.640]  years and these are that really because they're they're really just canyons the the left isn't
[03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:43.280]  sabotaging things but they are they are the swahili tribe yep okay ken kenya is 44 tribes
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:56.320]  and the swahili are the muslim tribe in kenya yep now sufi muslim when osha bob came down from
[03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:06.160]  into northern into northern kenya um what happened was the muslims there the muslim women
[03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:14.240]  and they brought scarves out for all the christian women and and they hid them among themselves
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:22.320]  and they said no there are no christians here love this guy well sure so you're seeing
[03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:26.240]  there's areas where muslims and christians are living in peace i've shown me here i appreciate
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:31.920]  your call you want to comment on that sac yeah no kidding that that's how it should go when there's
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:37.680]  no uh you know military industrial complex cia back sabotage that's exactly how it goes
[03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:43.200]  that's exactly how human beings exist there's arbitrary lines that they call borders in these
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:47.040]  countries but what the gentleman was saying kenya is a beautiful example morocco is a beautiful
[03:02:47.040 --> 03:02:54.000]  example when the military industrial complex cia this sort of a globalist sort of agenda is not
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:59.360]  implemented in these countries it's harmony would you imagine that would you imagine that
[03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:07.360]  that it's sabotage it's psychological warfare these people are demonic we're religious we
[03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:11.760]  cannot fight against each other these are abrahamic religions i don't care if you're jew christian
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:17.440]  or muslim listen i'm not perfect i'm outside the i'm outside the uh the realm of all that now i
[03:03:17.440 --> 03:03:23.200]  guess that you call me intellectual or buddhist or whatever i don't care um but i observe it and
[03:03:23.200 --> 03:03:28.480]  i have the timeline this individual is correct when it's not sabotage guess what people happen
[03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:32.720]  to get along well sure there's definitely globalist forces manipulating something and you're right the
[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:39.040]  ai is lowering our q it's people aren't getting married they're not having sex they're not lived
[03:03:39.040 --> 03:03:45.520]  they're dying the the tv's the smartphones are killing us that's the big threat hold on let's i mean
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:50.880]  it's this easy this is this is not this is not a conspiracy this is this is from the state department
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:59.600]  the first contact with bin laden was in 1979 they knew who he was super wealthy they backed him to fight
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:04.800]  then the soviets that then they were called muja hadin tom hanks did a great movie called charlie
[03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:10.080]  wilson's war and now all of a sudden they're all kaita and they're these big bad people and guess
[03:04:10.080 --> 03:04:15.040]  what you know what grows there poppy you know what poppy is morphean you know what morphean is
[03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:19.520]  heroin it's destroying this country and they're doing it on a purpose and they're and now they're

[03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:29.280]  we know where technology is going let's just let's let's fix this man sure i understand but the point
[03:04:29.280 --> 03:04:34.000]  is the globalists are putting the bad radicals in charge and opening the gate and then telling
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:37.520]  all of us to put up with it's why people are pissed we need muslims to point out what's happening
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:42.960]  and say it's wrong if we're not going to have the class of civilizations omar in germany and

[03:05:02.880 --> 03:05:08.720]  iq it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the
[03:05:08.720 --> 03:05:15.120]  best iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was
[03:05:15.120 --> 03:05:19.520]  pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[03:05:19.520 --> 03:05:25.840]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought ux2 that's been incredible now
[03:05:25.840 --> 03:05:30.880]  due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[03:05:30.880 --> 03:05:36.080]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[03:05:36.080 --> 03:05:42.560]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges
[03:05:42.560 --> 03:05:48.880]  it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see

[03:07:33.360 --> 03:07:38.160]  like the whole world is wrong when a church gets blown up because what happened to our
[03:07:38.160 --> 03:07:43.680]  longhouses how do you think our people felt when we were chased from our homelands and
[03:07:43.680 --> 03:07:48.640]  what happened all the enslavement that went on i mean you can't deny that bro you you can't
[03:07:48.640 --> 03:07:55.440]  like i mean i and we're listen we're not perfect either but for you guys to sit there and complain
[03:07:55.440 --> 03:08:01.200]  about churches being blown up don't don't sit there don't know not act like we didn't have
[03:08:01.200 --> 03:08:09.680]  stuff done to us chief here's the deal here's the deal chief i 100 agree with you and when when
[03:08:09.680 --> 03:08:16.320]  that church christ church had that attack on that mosque killed 49 people i said it was horrible
[03:08:16.320 --> 03:08:21.440]  it was terrible and i want and i and and but everybody put on hajibs and you know we're all
[03:08:21.440 --> 03:08:26.080]  guilty i said no don't say all westerners are guilty but just say that's not a nice thing to do
[03:08:26.080 --> 03:08:31.360]  and it's wrong then christians get blown up and obama and hillary won't even call them christians
[03:08:31.360 --> 03:08:37.440]  they call them easter worshippers so and you said you're not without sin either well you you're
[03:08:37.440 --> 03:08:42.400]  not to blame for what your ancestors did people showed up here one tribe would try to get you
[03:08:42.400 --> 03:08:47.200]  to fight the other tribe it was it was they got tribal stuff just like the whites you know
[03:08:47.200 --> 03:08:51.840]  would were fighting each other against the french and the and the and the and the english i mean
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:57.360]  humans are humans as zach was saying but no i totally get your point that you know you had
[03:08:57.360 --> 03:09:02.480]  the british handing out smallpox blankets the native american women and children i wouldn't do that
[03:09:02.480 --> 03:09:07.840]  so some really barbarous evil sneaky stuff was done by the west that native americans
[03:09:08.480 --> 03:09:13.280]  told sure why would fight you and try to kill you but they wouldn't give you disease on purpose
[03:09:13.280 --> 03:09:18.880]  they thought that was bad luck and sneaky and pissing so i would say in some ways the west was
[03:09:18.880 --> 03:09:22.480]  more low down the native americans it's actually true and i'm a little bit of american me so
[03:09:22.480 --> 03:09:27.600]  i don't think they're gonna judge that i don't see it as a as you know some superiority that
[03:09:27.600 --> 03:09:31.840]  that the quote west to feed the native americans native americans aren't defeated their genetics
[03:09:31.840 --> 03:09:35.120]  are all over this continent they're all over the world but but but i hear what you're saying
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:40.800]  anything else chief i'm not a socialist either and i don't like that what i think we as made
[03:09:40.800 --> 03:09:46.000]  was because we're the first people here i think we should get some stuff for free not everything
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:51.520]  but anytime you get stuff for free it domesticates anybody if you said i want to claim to national
[03:09:51.520 --> 03:09:56.320]  parks or something and it wasn't some tribal council that got it i would be against individual
[03:09:56.320 --> 03:10:02.080]  people like say you know 30 percent or something native blood would get a piece of a of a national
[03:10:02.080 --> 03:10:06.560]  park or something i mean i think you could say that but i think just saying oh we're gonna
[03:10:06.560 --> 03:10:11.440]  have tribal managers giving you stuff that creates the horrible nightmares that we see on reservations
[03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:16.240]  god bless you i appreciate your call just like you domesticate humans just like domesticate
[03:10:16.240 --> 03:10:21.280]  animals why don't you feed animals at the park it makes them domesticated you don't want to do it
[03:10:21.280 --> 03:10:25.920]  humans need to work for what they get what's been done to what's left of native americans is is
[03:10:25.920 --> 03:10:31.120]  scary but after reservations out west man it's scary and you learn what the amount of money
[03:10:31.120 --> 03:10:35.520]  they're getting it's like wow what's what happened here it's all just really sad uh you want to
[03:10:35.520 --> 03:10:42.640]  say anything zach yeah uh chief a brother and i'm gonna say this from chief tecumseh
[03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:48.560]  so live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart trouble no one of us takes
[03:10:48.560 --> 03:10:55.440]  more calls here uh let's talk to omar in germany former muslim now christian on the islam terra
[03:10:55.440 --> 03:11:01.920]  topic go ahead omar you're on the air hey hey alex big fan over here like me my friends
[03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:08.320]  uh we just wanted to ask you a couple of questions i wanted to ask you what do you think about the
[03:11:08.320 --> 03:11:14.880]  fact that our force is corrupting religions not just not not just let's say islam with all the
[03:11:15.440 --> 03:11:21.600]  destabilization of all the secular leaders like kadasi uh what's he called um uh
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:29.200]  asad and and and them yeah and what do you think about the fact that for instance judeism was also
[03:11:29.200 --> 03:11:35.440]  some hijacked with the talmud and this fake jewish supremacy you know well there's no doubt that people
[03:11:35.440 --> 03:11:40.480]  go why are these all these different jewish groups well you got the old testament and then you've
[03:11:40.480 --> 03:11:45.440]  got all these different things that have been written by different rabbinical groups that that
[03:11:45.440 --> 03:11:55.200]  are that are very different ideas so so yeah it's it's definitely a a mess no i was just wondering
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:12:00.640]  how do we overcome this fact because by virtue of destroying all of these religions by destroying
[03:12:00.640 --> 03:12:06.160]  pious people by them are to not hang up on you either
[03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:16.240]  uh by destroying religious people how do we deal with you know this disruption in religion
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:20.400]  generally no no i hear you the globalists want to get rid of people that care about the spiritual
[03:12:20.400 --> 03:12:24.160]  because they want to control us and the spiritual is the next level and i think that is the big
[03:12:24.160 --> 03:12:29.360]  debate it's a whole nother hour show three hour show what do you do to transcend the attack on
[03:12:29.360 --> 03:12:36.720]  real spirituality i appreciate your call uh let's talk to shona in oklahoma female muslim
[03:12:36.720 --> 03:12:44.800]  perspective go ahead shona thanks for holding uh hi uh my name is sanna sanna go ahead um well uh
[03:12:45.520 --> 03:12:54.080]  i want to start off by saying um muslim christians jews we all know that there's one true fact we
[03:12:54.080 --> 03:13:02.000]  all worship the same god you know for muslims in arabic the word allah means god therefore when
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:08.640]  somebody says oh you guys believe in allah not the one true god allah means god i just want to
[03:13:08.640 --> 03:13:16.160]  clarify that and when i'm talking about terrorism how uh i guess one of the callers said that that
[03:13:16.160 --> 03:13:21.040]  islam was based on violence and it and it's always been violent there's a story i want to
[03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:26.560]  tell you that i heard from one of my friends who did allama course means she learned about islam
[03:13:26.560 --> 03:13:31.440]  so much that she told me the story it's about the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam
[03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:37.600]  there was a time where war was inflicted uh with him and his people and they were fighting
[03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:44.320]  fight they were at war against a group of people i do not remember who that was and i remember the
[03:13:44.320 --> 03:13:50.480]  prophet was hurt really bad he was struck on top of his head and i guess he had blood was
[03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:56.320]  streaming down his face and islamidus believed that the prophet was the favorite prophet of
[03:13:56.960 --> 03:14:04.160]  of god so he he declared if a drop of blood was to drop the prophet's drop of blood was to drop
[03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:09.520]  on that land he will kill everybody on that land he will destroy the land he will literally tear it
[03:14:09.520 --> 03:14:15.360]  apart if his prophet blood was to splatter on that earth but you know what the prophet did
[03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:21.040]  he took his hand he cupped it on his face to make sure no blood would drop on that land
[03:14:21.040 --> 03:14:26.560]  it wasn't to protect just the muslims who are fighting in the war but it was to protect everybody
[03:14:26.560 --> 03:14:32.080]  else if islam was all about terrorism all about violence why would the sure no i understand well
[03:14:32.080 --> 03:14:35.840]  there's also when you conquer somebody then you do a little gracious thing to look like you know
[03:14:35.840 --> 03:14:40.640]  it's okay you've been defeated but i hear what you're saying real quick jane new york jay currently
[03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:46.480]  practicing muslim go ahead you're on the air i agree with irwan who said that the the hit piece
[03:14:46.480 --> 03:14:52.080]  on islam was not the best way to get people to your side i think that first thing i'm not trying
[03:14:52.080 --> 03:14:57.520]  to get people to my side we're putting out stuff here no i i think you should try and do more like
[03:14:57.520 --> 03:15:08.240]  a mexit like what kandis owens is doing and try to convince people to try to convince people
[03:15:08.240 --> 03:15:19.680]  to uh join not join you but join the info wars well here's the deal we you know there's all this

[03:19:59.760 --> 03:20:14.800]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:20:18.960 --> 03:20:24.240]  islamic terrorists attacked a number of luxury hotels and catholic churches in shrill anchor
[03:20:24.240 --> 03:20:31.360]  killing 290 people and injuring 500 more why did hillary clinton react to the christ
[03:20:31.360 --> 03:20:37.840]  church mosque massacre by specifically offering condolences to the muslim community and calling
[03:20:37.840 --> 03:20:43.280]  out islamophobia yet when it came to offering condolences to the scores of catholics killed
[03:20:43.280 --> 03:20:50.080]  in shrill anchor she specifically avoided using the term christians instead calling them
[03:20:50.080 --> 03:20:56.560]  easter worshipers why did barack obama react to the christ church mosque massacre by specifically
[03:20:56.560 --> 03:21:02.320]  offering condolences to the muslim community yet when it came to offering condolences to the scores
[03:21:02.320 --> 03:21:07.680]  of catholics killed in shrill anchor he specifically avoided using the term christians
[03:21:07.680 --> 03:21:13.920]  instead calling them easter worshipers why does the media also routinely use the term
[03:21:13.920 --> 03:21:21.040]  easter worshipers instead of christians why is there such a reticence to use the c word why
[03:21:21.040 --> 03:21:28.800]  was cnn more mythed about trump's tweet typo than obama and hillary refusing to use the word christians
[03:21:32.080 --> 03:21:37.440]  he left the tweet up for more than 20 minutes why does the most persecuted religious group in
[03:21:37.440 --> 03:21:44.080]  the world receive the least sympathy from world leaders and the media after each devastating
[03:21:44.080 --> 03:21:52.720]  attack 105 christian churches or buildings are attacked or burned every month an average of 345
[03:21:52.720 --> 03:21:59.120]  christians are killed for faith related reasons every single month the shrill anchor attacks
[03:21:59.120 --> 03:22:04.240]  killed nearly six times as many people as the christ church mosque massacre and this isn't some
[03:22:04.240 --> 03:22:09.440]  kind of grisly competition both attacks were horrendous but are we going to see world leaders
[03:22:09.440 --> 03:22:15.200]  donning crucifixes and making special speeches in support of the christian community or will this
[03:22:15.200 --> 03:22:22.160]  entire story be forgotten about by the media and by much of the world within 48 hours will all those
[03:22:22.160 --> 03:22:26.800]  liberals who poured out their soul after the new zealom mosque attack now change their flags in
[03:22:26.800 --> 03:22:32.160]  solidarity with shrill anchor christian community hold fundraisers and condemn islamists who carried
[03:22:32.160 --> 03:22:37.440]  out this attack why does some leftists who collectively blame all white people or all
[03:22:37.440 --> 03:22:43.120]  conservatives after every anti-muslim attack choose not to denounce islamic terror attacks
[03:22:43.120 --> 03:22:49.120]  but when they occur to blame the victims this left-wing journalist responded to a barbaric
[03:22:49.120 --> 03:22:55.440]  islamic terror attack which targeted christians by blaming christian missionaries have we now
[03:22:55.440 --> 03:23:00.800]  reached the stage where the fault lies not with the islamic terrorist who blew himself up but
[03:23:00.800 --> 03:23:06.640]  with the people who may have offended him in what kind of messed up clown world does that kind of
[03:23:06.640 --> 03:23:14.000]  rhetoric make any sense why did cbs news report the perpetrators as religious extremists and not
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:20.800]  muslim extremists why did it take the media over a day to report the patently obvious that this
[03:23:20.800 --> 03:23:25.920]  was an islamic terror attack why did the shrill-anchin government demand that its people not even ask
[03:23:25.920 --> 03:23:31.280]  who was behind the attacks do they not deserve to know why does the western media routinely
[03:23:31.280 --> 03:23:37.440]  hype the threat posed by right-wing extremism yet routinely downplay the threat posed by islamic
[03:23:37.440 --> 03:23:42.720]  extremism when the threat posed by islamic extremism is clearly far greater one of the
[03:23:42.720 --> 03:23:48.720]  alleged suicide bombers in shrill anchor has been identified as islamic extremist zaran hasheem
[03:23:48.720 --> 03:23:54.480]  he previously posted a video in which he stated that quote anyone who disagrees with muslims
[03:23:54.480 --> 03:23:59.760]  should be killed why was this video allowed to circulate by youtube which routinely removes
[03:23:59.760 --> 03:24:06.640]  or restricts conservative content for little more than being politically incorrect why did aljazeera
[03:24:06.640 --> 03:24:14.160]  journalist saif khalid claim that reporting hasheem's name was islamophobic is it now islamophobic
[03:24:14.160 --> 03:24:20.240]  to accurately state that the suicide bombers in shrill anchor were muslims imagine if christians
[03:24:20.240 --> 03:24:26.000]  targeted mosques during ramadan and tried to kill as many muslims as possible there'd be a global
[03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:32.080]  outcry there'd be weeks of mourning there'd be permanent recriminations shrill anchor nearly
[03:24:32.080 --> 03:24:54.000]  300 dead 500 injured and by the end of this week it will be a footnote why please click the big
[03:24:54.000 --> 03:24:59.360]  red button to subscribe it really helps me when you do that all right hello my name is will johnson
[03:24:59.360 --> 03:25:05.040]  i am sitting in for alex jones for the remainder of this hour thank you for sticking around we're
[03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:09.040]  going to continue with the phone lines but first i just want to talk a little bit about what's
[03:25:09.040 --> 03:25:13.840]  happening in the world and what's everything that's been going on and everyone is glued to the tube to
[03:25:13.840 --> 03:25:18.960]  watch it except for the liberal media one thing i noticed is on the liberal media and i watched a
[03:25:18.960 --> 03:25:23.280]  communist news network just to see what they're talking about just to see what they're saying
[03:25:23.280 --> 03:25:29.600]  and sure enough they did talk about what happened in shrill anchor just to see what was happening
[03:25:29.600 --> 03:25:35.920]  you know to make it look like they're reporting on the news but then they dropped it you know what
[03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:42.160]  what happened in new zealand they were talking about what happened in new zealand 24 7 day in
[03:25:42.160 --> 03:25:46.800]  and day out they would not give it a rest because they wanted to make it look like some kind of way
[03:25:46.800 --> 03:25:53.760]  president trump was involved or as president trump may have influenced this monster to go into this
[03:25:53.760 --> 03:25:59.600]  monster kill these people but the communist news network they talked about a little bit but then
[03:25:59.600 --> 03:26:07.120]  they moved back over to the whole collusion delusion with the mother report see most of the time if
[03:26:07.120 --> 03:26:13.360]  there's something that happens if an event takes place what they will do is they will drill it
[03:26:13.360 --> 03:26:18.880]  down drill it down but if it's something that they don't like they will make sure they bring back to
[03:26:18.880 --> 03:26:27.280]  the surface the subject that they want people to think about what's more important over 300 people
[03:26:27.280 --> 03:26:36.880]  dying versus a report that should have never taken place which what is more important what should
[03:26:36.880 --> 03:26:43.520]  what should the liberal media should be talking about more than any other and the communist news
[03:26:43.520 --> 03:26:49.120]  network they're okay with not talking about it the way they should see they don't want people to
[03:26:49.120 --> 03:26:55.600]  realize that christians across the world are being persecuted they don't want people to realize that
[03:26:55.600 --> 03:27:01.760]  and if it was the other way around for example like new zealand like i just mentioned they would
[03:27:01.760 --> 03:27:08.320]  talk about it 24-7 it's it's really a no-brainer but they find it more important to try to take out
[03:27:08.320 --> 03:27:14.320]  the president of the united states than it is to address the issues about christians being attacked
[03:27:14.320 --> 03:27:22.240]  across the planet it is a horrible time we are living in the end times we are living in the
[03:27:22.240 --> 03:27:27.360]  end times you don't hear a lot of people especially in the mainstream media talk about that but all
[03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:30.960]  these different events taking place and you have people in the past they always say well you know
[03:27:30.960 --> 03:27:37.440]  we've always had these things takes place of course we've had violence but it's never been
[03:27:38.080 --> 03:27:45.360]  a time like it is now where we have the earthquakes and we have the the the changing of minds of
[03:27:45.360 --> 03:27:51.920]  little children to believe something else where we have people believing that they can be something
[03:27:51.920 --> 03:27:56.960]  simply because they feel that way or they're pushing this whole agenda on the rest of us
[03:27:56.960 --> 03:28:03.520]  that demonizes if we don't believe what they believe it's it's it's not like it's ever been
[03:28:03.520 --> 03:28:08.960]  before and what's happening over in the middle east and happening in these other countries
[03:28:08.960 --> 03:28:15.360]  it should be a wake-up call to everybody that we are living in a time like no other time before
[03:28:16.880 --> 03:28:24.560]  we've got to wake up we've got to wake up now one thing i want to talk about before we go to

[03:34:07.280 --> 03:34:13.840]  scripted or anything this is my personal experience with taking it one of the things that i realized
[03:34:13.840 --> 03:34:21.920]  taking this was how much energy it actually gave me and how it made me feel after taking it it's almost
[03:34:22.640 --> 03:34:28.640]  it's remarkable it's amazing how you can put so much happiness in a small bottle that's the only
[03:34:28.640 --> 03:34:37.040]  way i can describe it i mean it's almost it's like happiness in a bottle and now i understand why it
[03:34:37.040 --> 03:34:45.520]  sold out before and why it was so hard to get x2 i mean this is it's remarkable i mean i can't
[03:34:45.520 --> 03:34:50.480]  really believe exactly how he did it and how they got it in the bottle like that but okay
[03:34:50.480 --> 03:34:55.440]  but anyways i just had to talk about it because it's wonderful it is a wonderful product this

[03:35:10.880 --> 03:35:16.800]  let me read this to you real quick one thing that i was looking at and i truly believe like i was
[03:35:16.800 --> 03:35:22.080]  saying before we went to the break that we are in the end times and it was it was told that this
[03:35:22.080 --> 03:35:30.000]  was going to happen so let me show you this jesus said then they will deliver you up to
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:37.760]  tribulation and kill you and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake and then many
[03:35:37.760 --> 03:35:47.120]  will be offended will betray one another and will hate one another then many false prophets will
[03:35:47.120 --> 03:35:58.320]  rise up and deceive many and because lawlessness will abound and love for many love of many will
[03:35:58.320 --> 03:36:09.280]  grow cold that's exactly exactly why i say we're in the end times because we're experiencing this
[03:36:09.280 --> 03:36:18.480]  right now we're seeing this right now you know i saw another report where 11 people 11 christians
[03:36:18.480 --> 03:36:23.680]  a day are being killed because they believe in christ throughout the world 11 a day that's over
[03:36:23.680 --> 03:36:31.520]  4 000 people a year simply because of your beliefs in christ but the liberal media doesn't want to
[03:36:31.520 --> 03:36:40.240]  talk about that all right so let's go with i believe that's jenny jenny from california want to talk
[03:36:40.240 --> 03:36:47.520]  about christianity yeah i just have a method for your viewers i just wanted to let you know that
[03:36:48.640 --> 03:36:54.240]  you know christ the redeemer has returned and i saw him in a vision on friday afternoon on good
[03:36:54.240 --> 03:37:01.680]  friday he was wearing his crown of thorns and then he returned back to me on sunday um to see
[03:37:01.680 --> 03:37:10.960]  love and joy you know we're just like but you're not for basic you know he's not forgotten yeah
[03:37:10.960 --> 03:37:15.280]  i i'm completely with you you're you're you're breaking up there you might want to call back
[03:37:15.280 --> 03:37:21.680]  in with a better reception but you know what jesus jesus is is coming back i truly believe that and
[03:37:21.680 --> 03:37:27.920]  everything that we see happening going on in the world there's no way around it i mean either i like
[03:37:27.920 --> 03:37:35.920]  to say this either the bible is a script and people are using it to follow it or it's true it's one of
[03:37:35.920 --> 03:37:40.640]  the other because the things the events that's supposed to take take place in the bible is
[03:37:40.640 --> 03:37:46.560]  actually happening right now all right let's go with brandon from texas talking about the east or
[03:37:46.560 --> 03:37:54.080]  bombing how's it going brandon hey well can you hear me yes sir awesome hey i just wanted to first
[03:37:54.080 --> 03:37:59.680]  off i want to say uh alpha power take that thing i take it every day and i feel alive and great
[03:38:00.400 --> 03:38:07.040]  oh yes but also i'm a christian i live in texas right now and uh when you first signed on you
[03:38:07.040 --> 03:38:13.600]  were talking about how uh the liberal media was talking attributing the christ church
[03:38:13.600 --> 03:38:20.080]  um shooting to donald trump mm-hmm and and his rhetoric and everything what do you think about
[03:38:20.080 --> 03:38:26.720]  like maybe uh illan omar's rhetoric or resheda tolead's rhetoric i mean i don't like playing
[03:38:26.720 --> 03:38:33.600]  the blame game here and i think it's a very dangerous game to play but i mean donald trump's
[03:38:33.600 --> 03:38:40.640]  rhetoric isn't exactly as uh radical i would say well you know they'd like to say that donald
[03:38:40.640 --> 03:38:46.080]  trump's rhetoric is because he's putting the american people first and when you have resheda
[03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:53.920]  tolead and illan omar they basically are anti-semitic and well i believe it was illan omar just
[03:38:53.920 --> 03:38:59.440]  actually put a tweet out there saying you know you know goodwill to people who said celebrating
[03:38:59.440 --> 03:39:05.280]  the easter weekend etc etc and i think personally she was just pandering and you know muslims are
[03:39:05.280 --> 03:39:11.760]  called to lie to people just to make people believe that they are good in a certain sense right
[03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:18.240]  so i don't i don't believe anything that they're saying uh they've got those four different lies
[03:39:18.240 --> 03:39:22.800]  that they can tell on the islamic religion i don't remember exactly what they were but you know one
[03:39:22.800 --> 03:39:29.200]  of them is to kind of preserve the islamic belief and then it's just crazy yeah they're
[03:39:29.200 --> 03:39:36.000]  called to do it they're called to do it and you know what and they take pride in doing it in deceiving
[03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:42.480]  the infidel would have you right and i i really don't like uh playing the blame game and everything
[03:39:42.480 --> 03:39:48.240]  but i remember i was probably about eight years old when 9-11 happened so it's still a little it's
[03:39:48.240 --> 03:39:55.040]  a little hazy my memory but i remember it and i remember after that um i think it was al-qaeda
[03:39:55.040 --> 03:40:01.200]  or some terrorist organizations were sending in videos and i remember specifically been saying
[03:40:01.200 --> 03:40:07.120]  that they were going to destroy us from within yeah they've constantly you know what they've
[03:40:07.120 --> 03:40:13.360]  constantly doing it and now we have roshida to lead and ilhan omar and you know the liberals
[03:40:13.360 --> 03:40:18.320]  the leftists the democrats they're completely complicit with it because if you notice every
[03:40:18.320 --> 03:40:24.000]  time something came up that were ilhan omar roshida to lead did something or says something that
[03:40:24.000 --> 03:40:30.560]  you know most cases people would go this is not proper this is not correct but they didn't do that
[03:40:30.560 --> 03:40:37.680]  the democrats jumped on board to protect them to help them so i mean it's it's it's remarkable and
[03:40:37.680 --> 03:40:42.960]  i think it was the taliban that was sending videos because i remember a whole bunch of videos and
[03:40:42.960 --> 03:40:48.800]  other stuff talking and songs come out hey mr taliban taliban banana and then all this stuff
[03:40:48.800 --> 03:40:55.040]  is crazy hey i want to thank you for the call brandon let's go with brad from texas
[03:40:56.960 --> 03:41:03.440]  hey how you doing brad how's it going man good good thanks for calling what i wanted to talk
[03:41:03.440 --> 03:41:10.240]  about today is quite interesting because um us jews are celebrating Passover and this was the
[03:41:10.240 --> 03:41:15.760]  holiday where moses led our ancestors out of egypt to the promised land to modern day israel
[03:41:15.760 --> 03:41:22.800]  mm-hmm and i think this is interesting because in moses was told by god that you're gonna face
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:31.520]  the enemies of emilek of midian the canonites and the philistines and i think that's so prophetic
[03:41:31.520 --> 03:41:37.920]  because all those nations today if you look at what they make it's it's uh jordan syria
[03:41:37.920 --> 03:41:48.720]  um uh the arab territories in um israel mm-hmm and in the end i and i see ezekiel chapter 38
[03:41:48.720 --> 03:41:54.400]  and it says in the word of the lord came to me saying son of man said i faced against gog
[03:41:54.400 --> 03:42:00.960]  of the land of may gog and that's that's believed to be in christian and jewish end times either
[03:42:00.960 --> 03:42:06.880]  russia or turkey and you know right now in the middle east that there's a coalition with russia
[03:42:06.880 --> 03:42:14.720]  turkey and iran and then ezekiel chapter um 38 verse 5 it says the coalition will be made of
[03:42:14.720 --> 03:42:21.840]  haras kush putt and may gog haras is persia kush and putt are other muslim countries in north
[03:42:21.840 --> 03:42:27.600]  africa and may gog is either believed to be russia or turkey so i've heard that may god may god has
[03:42:27.600 --> 03:42:33.360]  been known to be uh called uh russia and i i've heard that quite often and you're absolutely
[03:42:33.360 --> 03:42:38.720]  correct and what we're seeing is the end time we're seeing it happen it's all about to come
[03:42:38.720 --> 03:42:43.760]  to a head and remember president trump just did a lot for israel and the muslim community doesn't
[03:42:43.760 --> 03:42:48.240]  like it hey my name is will johnson this is the info wars i'm filling in for alex jones for the
[03:42:48.240 --> 03:42:56.080]  last hour we'll be right back after this break living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it
[03:42:56.080 --> 03:43:01.760]  really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[03:43:01.760 --> 03:43:08.320]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[03:43:08.320 --> 03:43:14.880]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[03:43:14.880 --> 03:43:21.600]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[03:43:21.600 --> 03:43:27.760]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[03:43:27.760 --> 03:43:33.600]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:43:33.600 --> 03:43:40.400]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure
[03:43:40.400 --> 03:43:46.560]  raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate
[03:43:46.560 --> 03:43:53.360]  a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it i've got
[03:43:53.360 --> 03:44:00.960]  a big announcement to make we've got four or five positions in it and a bunch of very exciting

[03:47:32.800 --> 03:47:36.560]  are full we're gonna try to get through some of these really quick but i want to point out
[03:47:36.560 --> 03:47:42.960]  something really quick too when i mentioned earlier that there was 11 christians every day
[03:47:42.960 --> 03:47:47.920]  are being killed simply because they believe in christ that's it to give one to give just a few
[03:47:47.920 --> 03:47:53.200]  examples i mean the list is long but just to give a few examples one of his north korea christianity
[03:47:53.200 --> 03:48:00.080]  is the number one enemy of the state this is ridiculous in afghanistan christianity is not
[03:48:00.080 --> 03:48:07.120]  even permitted right so and where where the liberals had on all this you know they're they're
[03:48:07.120 --> 03:48:13.680]  complicit with the two do you remember hillary clinton said that christianity is the problem
[03:48:14.320 --> 03:48:19.040]  in america do you remember that i'm wanting to have many people remember that we have to think
[03:48:19.040 --> 03:48:24.640]  about it and another thing where is the pope on all of this think about that where is the pope
[03:48:24.640 --> 03:48:32.560]  on all this okay let's go back to the phone lines here let's go with uh let's see let's go with david

[03:48:55.600 --> 03:49:00.880]  i always kick around the idea that i had heard once that the second coming of christ would
[03:49:00.880 --> 03:49:08.240]  symbolize the fall of the church and then would the second coming of christ at that point be the
[03:49:08.240 --> 03:49:13.680]  coming of a physical being or the awakening of christ consciousness within a person well you know
[03:49:13.680 --> 03:49:18.880]  what the physical church the physical church is already falling you have the physical church today
[03:49:18.880 --> 03:49:23.040]  where it even says in the bible talks about homosexuality you have churches today that
[03:49:23.040 --> 03:49:28.720]  is openly supporting homosexuality and they're encouraging their congregation to embrace it
[03:49:28.720 --> 03:49:32.640]  we're seeing it today and the churches today in america don't even speak out against all
[03:49:32.640 --> 03:49:38.160]  of the abortion that's taking place we're seeing that right now today and it is happening
[03:49:38.160 --> 03:49:45.520]  absolutely believe that yeah absolutely hey thank you for the car i'm gonna try to get to
[03:49:45.520 --> 03:49:50.560]  somebody's really quick because uh we have a lot in here i want to try to get to as many as possible

[03:50:15.360 --> 03:50:21.360]  did the thing about um what Easter worship there's one a lot of crap oh yeah oh yeah it doesn't make
[03:50:21.360 --> 03:50:30.480]  like i mean i grew up as a professing christian i uh in this the christian reform church but um
[03:50:30.480 --> 03:50:39.840]  um but i totally agree like i'm not known i don't necessarily uh take alex jones's views on christian
[03:50:39.840 --> 03:50:48.240]  but but i agree there is a huge attack on christian and and why and i get frustrated when i speak
[03:50:48.240 --> 03:50:53.440]  why aren't christians talking about this why aren't christians speaking up you know you know
[03:50:53.440 --> 03:50:57.200]  it you know what you're absolutely right and it's the same thing what i just mentioned have the
[03:50:57.200 --> 03:51:02.800]  the churches aren't talking about uh the the homosexuality and how is infiltrating the
[03:51:02.800 --> 03:51:07.600]  churches and how come they're not talking about the abortion uh that's just another example
[03:51:07.600 --> 03:51:12.080]  every church in america should be screaming out right now about how christians across the
[03:51:12.080 --> 03:51:17.360]  planet are being killed they should be talking about it and for the most part they don't because
[03:51:17.360 --> 03:51:22.400]  they don't want to run off the people in their church they feel that if they sit that they talk
[03:51:22.400 --> 03:51:28.320]  about these things that are so touchy sensitive that they're gonna leave you're christian or you're
[03:51:28.320 --> 03:51:33.760]  not i mean it doesn't make any sense it's one or the other okay i want to thank you for the call

[03:51:53.600 --> 03:51:57.280]  the speakers there and the reason why i'm going because of the way the tech companies the way
[03:51:57.280 --> 03:52:02.640]  the liberal media the way the whole censorship against conservatives the censorship against
[03:52:02.640 --> 03:52:08.320]  info wars we need to bring it to attention and how i don't like how these politicians
[03:52:08.320 --> 03:52:12.960]  are not addressing the issue like they should be now you have ted cruz he'll come out and he's he's
[03:52:12.960 --> 03:52:18.480]  done hearings where he talked about the censorship and he addressed it with facebook and twitter
[03:52:18.480 --> 03:52:25.360]  but not enough is being done not enough and with 2020 coming we most definitely need to be
[03:52:25.360 --> 03:52:31.360]  hitting on it and i will be there in san francisco on may 3rd to contact uh devin newness
[03:52:31.360 --> 03:52:35.920]  he's a california representative in the area here and he's had his uh free speech suppressed
[03:52:37.120 --> 03:52:41.840]  trying to get him to come would be a good idea yeah he actually has a lawsuit with twitter
[03:52:41.840 --> 03:52:46.640]  which personally i don't think is enough i think he needs to be one billion but hey thanks for the

[03:53:15.280 --> 03:53:20.400]  that's what like the real anti christ is going to uh pretend to save you from the anti christ
[03:53:20.400 --> 03:53:26.640]  tends to be christ right so yeah well see yeah you know there are many anti christ and i truly
[03:53:26.640 --> 03:53:32.000]  believe that obama is one of them there are many anti christ but there is one anti christ

[03:54:46.800 --> 03:54:51.120]  started studying their history and jesus smith claimed to be bigger than jesus

[03:55:21.280 --> 03:55:27.040]  led me on yeah uh i think we should uh redefine a religion that it should be a metric that we
[03:55:27.040 --> 03:55:32.000]  measure religion by that it should teach you to peacefully coexist with other people of other
[03:55:32.000 --> 03:55:37.440]  faith if it doesn't teach you that it's not a religion it's a war plan it's an infiltration
[03:55:37.440 --> 03:55:44.080]  plan it's it's a deception so islam should lose its tax-free uh benefit status all around the
[03:55:44.080 --> 03:55:48.640]  western world all those mosques should be taxed on property taxes and then we got to hit him in
