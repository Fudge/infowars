[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting world-wide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:26.000 --> 00:48.000]  This is where men are made, and it's in these historic times where men become heroes and legends.
[00:48.000 --> 00:59.000]  What will you say when your ancestors and your lineage asks you what you did in these great times?
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  You know, there's so much going on right now. There's so many different ways that you can impact the world.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  It doesn't even have to be in politics. You could start a garden and teach other people how to garden.
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  You could raise awareness about the negative side effects of the wireless and cell phone technology.
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  You don't even have to step into the nasty ring of politics to change the world.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  So what are you doing right now in these historic times?
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  Now, this is a cigar.
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.000]  Now, me personally, I like to smoke cigars. What do you like to do with cigars, Bill?
[01:41.000 --> 01:49.000]  If Monica Lewinsky says that you used a cigar as a sexual aid with her in the Oval Office area, would she be lying?
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.000]  Yes, no, or a wrong answer?
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.000]  I will revert to my former statement.
[01:54.000 --> 02:03.000]  If Monica Lewinsky says that you had phone sex with her, would she be lying?
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  Well, that is at least in general terms, I think, is covered by my statement.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  I address that in my statement, and I don't believe this.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  Let me define phone sex for purposes of my question.
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.000]  Phone sex occurs when a party to a phone conversation masturbates while the other party is talking in a sexually explicit manner.
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.000]  And the question is, if Monica Lewinsky says that you had phone sex with her, would she be lying?
[02:28.000 --> 02:37.000]  I think that is covered by my statement.
[02:37.000 --> 02:48.000]  So, there you go. Apparently, Bill Clinton, well, let's just say if Bill Clinton offers you a cigar, you might want to turn it down.
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  There he is, though. Good old Bill.
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.000]  Now, I've got my Bill Clinton rape t-shirt on. Can we get a look at this? Let me just move over here.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  There you go, right there. Right there.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  Now, this used to be sold at infowarstore.com, but we're sold out.
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  There are other t-shirts you can get at infowarstore.com right now that will soon be sold out once in a lifetime type of purchase, a Bill Clinton rape t-shirt, right here.
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  Now, why am I talking about Bill Clinton?
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  Now, Bill Clinton is on a book tour right now.
[03:16.000 --> 03:30.000]  This disgraced bum of a president, a bum, a white trash, hick bum, who made a mockery of the White House, didn't know how to properly use a cigar,
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  and somehow, magically, maybe it was a magic wand.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  The media never gave Bill a hard time.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  The Me Too movement.
[03:40.000 --> 03:48.000]  There was no Me Too movement during Bill Clinton when he was settling rape cases, when he was flying on the Lolita Express with Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  No. No. But.
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.000]  Now they're saying, is Bill Clinton finally having his Me Too movement? Is it finally catching up to Bill?
[04:01.000 --> 04:14.000]  Well, I don't know, but when Bill Clinton goes to a book tour now, he's got people that stand up and say, Bill, what were you doing on the Lolita Express 26 times?
[04:14.000 --> 04:23.000]  So Bill Clinton is in Austin, Texas tonight, and Infowars is having a Me Too protest, hashtag Me Too protest outside of the Bass Concert Hall.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  So join me tonight.
[04:25.000 --> 04:37.000]  Put on your favorite Bill Clinton rape t-shirt, head on down to the Bass Concert Hall in Austin, Texas, and stand outside the crowd to let them know that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  And he's settled rape cases.
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  And he's flown on the Lolita Express with a sexual offender, Jeffrey Epstein.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  Bill and Hillary Clinton, tight friends with Harvey Weinstein, big donor of the Democrat Party.
[04:49.000 --> 04:55.000]  We're not going to let Bill Clinton come to Austin, Texas and not let the people of Austin know who Bill Clinton really is.
[04:55.000 --> 05:20.000]  We'll be back on the other side with Alex Jones. Don't go anywhere.

[06:15.000 --> 06:19.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, they've been trying to tell you that being pro-America was a bad thing.
[06:19.000 --> 06:24.000]  Being nationalist was a bad thing and you're causing the climate to change and kill the earth.
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.000]  You're causing all the bad things to happen because you're an American patriot.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  Well, no, we're not buying that anymore. Trump's not buying that anymore.
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  Trump goes to the G Summit, stands up for American nationalism and American pride.
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.000]  Here's Alex Jones with the latest report.
[06:39.000 --> 06:52.000]  We're live, we're broadcasting worldwide. It is a momentous day right now and the whole world is on the edge of its seat.
[06:52.000 --> 07:00.000]  We've actually been studying geopolitical systems and different power structures. The entire globalist paradigm is being overthrown.
[07:00.000 --> 07:11.000]  In a moment, I'm going to show you globalist leaders, George Soros and others, admitting they are suffering Napoleon Bonaparte level defeats the Battle of Waterloo.
[07:11.000 --> 07:21.000]  This is devastating and turning back the clock on their world government tyranny 60 years and accelerating us towards the new Renaissance.
[07:21.000 --> 07:30.000]  I'm going to let people in on some analysis that I haven't told anybody yet, but I think now is the time.
[07:30.000 --> 07:38.000]  And this is so sophisticated that I haven't really talked about it because it's so complex, but it's also so simple.
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  The United States created globalism. It created what is known as the New World Order.
[07:43.000 --> 07:56.000]  The Barbarians manipulated our ruling class intelligentsia into doing it after World War I and World War II with the League of Nations and the UN in the name of stopping World War.
[07:56.000 --> 08:06.000]  But then in the last few decades, the intelligentsia and the families that went along with it, most of them are evil, they realized that the whole thing was a giant fraud and a huge lie.
[08:06.000 --> 08:14.000]  And then globalism was really a plan to destroy nation states, consolidate control and destroy every level of independence.
[08:14.000 --> 08:27.000]  And so basically the robber barons set up the global corporate governance to be commanded from England, the U.S. and Europe, and to depopulate the Third World to be run out of the West.
[08:27.000 --> 08:42.000]  But they meant to dominate the West at the same time. Instead, Trump and U.S. intelligence agencies and other patriots in the U.K. are moving forward, ladies and gentlemen, in a big way to roll that back up,
[08:42.000 --> 08:50.000]  to take control of those systems that were set up for the betterment of the planet and for real open free trade and real peace.
[08:50.000 --> 09:03.000]  And so the promise that the globalists first sold but were lying about, they wanted the power for themselves, is now being taken control of and then Trump is being a very square dealer with all of these people.
[09:03.000 --> 09:15.000]  And he is just point blank talking to them and being honest about the whole plan and saying, we just want to deal with you from a straightforward position.
[09:15.000 --> 09:23.000]  And that's why you see it all coming out. That's why two years ago you saw in the Financial Times of London and all the other top globalist publications that if Trump got elected,
[09:23.000 --> 09:32.000]  it would be the final domino falling to bring down their corporate world government. That's anti-free market. That's not liberal. That's not open and free.
[09:32.000 --> 09:41.000]  It says it's all those things. It's the opposite. It's total centralization in their own words. So you see WikiLeaks come out from U.S. intelligence, not the Russians.
[09:41.000 --> 09:48.000]  And now you've seen Trump, now that he's proven Russia was a fraud and that Spygate is real, saying we should have the Russians in the G8.
[09:48.000 --> 10:00.000]  Obama set up the fall of Ukraine overthrowing it and triggered the Russians having to come in to take control of the area they've had for 500 years where Russia was founded in the area of eastern Ukraine.
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  All of this is now accelerating as the economy comes back, as sovereignty comes back, as political correctness begins to get its back broken.
[10:07.000 --> 10:16.000]  It had to happen because we were going into the endgame of globalism, breaking up families, bankrupting people, making people poor, taking full control.
[10:16.000 --> 10:25.000]  Now from a Machiavellian view, you could say this was all set up and sold to the world to make China and all these other countries think they'd be part of the world government and dominate the U.S.
[10:25.000 --> 10:34.000]  But really it was a globalist corporate plan to infiltrate them for their final take down. That's not what was really being planned.
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.000]  The globalists were double-crossing us, moving everything to China. China was breaking all its agreements about military expansion.
[10:39.000 --> 10:45.000]  They were supposed to get the Panama Canal, all the Deepwater ports, all the major trade, 98% of the rare earth minerals.
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.000]  They were to dominate that, kind of the globalist rollerball model of the interconnected, interdependent world.
[10:50.000 --> 10:57.000]  The U.S. was to be this big global military police power, but deindustrialized. These were all mainline CFR agreements.
[10:57.000 --> 11:06.000]  But we were betrayed at every point by the authoritarian EU, that's the new Soviet Union, by the communist Chinese who are the biggest mass murders in history.
[11:06.000 --> 11:18.000]  Hollywood sold out to them because the left has a hatred for America and a hatred for Christians and a hatred for the West because they want to dominate it because it's more powerful and more beautiful than they are with their sick demonic culture of globalism.
[11:18.000 --> 11:32.000]  And so they openly want to destroy that, so that sickness inside globalism kept sabotaging even the better aims of globalism because it was always sabotaging the West that was the progenitor and the fount of all their great success.
[11:32.000 --> 11:48.000]  So that's been recognized, the cancer of the leftist Saul Olensky communist globalism founded by the big foundations, funded by the Rockefellers and others, and their beef with Christianity and their beef with the West and their beef wanting to dominate it, subvert it and control it.
[11:48.000 --> 12:02.000]  As an act of dominance because the West is so much open, so beautiful, so great, so productive, they can't compete with an open free market society. They are monopoly men, as John D. Rockefeller the first said, and competition is a sin.
[12:02.000 --> 12:10.000]  So I'm going to show you amazing photos and amazing articles here for a few minutes that will totally and absolutely blow you away. We're checking out of this hotel right now.
[12:10.000 --> 12:23.000]  Was that the car getting here? Okay, tell them we'll be there. And so I'm going to finish this up real quick, but more is coming tonight. I know it's already, you know, eight, nine o'clock at night, you know, in the United States.
[12:23.000 --> 12:32.000]  I'm out here in the Pacific Ocean with my family, but I'm working the whole time because history is happening. But let's go ahead and go to this right now.
[12:32.000 --> 12:44.000]  Now, a picture tells a trillion words. The media is trying to spin this to make it look like, oh, Trump made them come to him and oh, Merkel tweeted this. This is the EU globalist.
[12:44.000 --> 12:58.000]  Their bureaucracy is unelected, allied with the Vatican, allied with radical Islam, invading Europe as their open plan, lined up against Japan, South Korea, leaders from Eastern Europe over here,
[12:58.000 --> 13:07.000]  and Trump. And Trump's there with his arms crossed saying, I don't care what you say, you invaded Ukraine, you overthrew Ukraine,
[13:07.000 --> 13:17.000]  but you made the Russians come into Eastern Ukraine, an area that they've controlled for 500 years. That's where Russia was founded. That's your fault. Things wouldn't have happened like this if I would have been president.
[13:17.000 --> 13:23.000]  And it shows how these people were set up by the globalist in the United States after World War II with the Marshall Plan.
[13:23.000 --> 13:30.000]  They were totally under U.S. control, but then we had our power, our money, our infrastructure transferred to them. We've been paying for Europe for 65 years.
[13:30.000 --> 13:41.000]  They were set up as the socialist globalist utopia, supposedly to be our example, paid for by the robber barons that had full control of their nations when we took control of it with the Marshall Plan.
[13:41.000 --> 13:53.000]  The Soros is called for Marshall Plan for Europe again. Trillions of dollars through him after he triggered the fall of the elected president of Ukraine, which he bragged about on Fareed Zakaria's program on CNN.
[13:53.000 --> 14:00.000]  So there it is. They're all basically on their knees to the king, and the media is calling him the king. Time magazine is coming out.
[14:00.000 --> 14:10.000]  He's not a king in that he's not elected. He's a king in that he is the final breath and maybe a new breath, a new lease on life for the West, if we accept it and take it.
[14:10.000 --> 14:17.000]  Using the real power, the real influence the U.S. had before it was fully transferred to the communist Chinese and destroyed.
[14:17.000 --> 14:25.000]  So Trump is grabbing, with the liberty movement, victory from the jaws of defeat, and all of you that are against America, all of you that hate flyover country,
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  Bill Maher last night saying he hopes America falls apart and goes bankrupt. He actually said that. He says he hopes the economy crashes to stop this,
[14:32.000 --> 14:40.000]  because these are all sympathizers and globalists hired and brought in and put in place to go along with the collaboration. You have to hate America to be part of this.
[14:40.000 --> 14:47.000]  Why should we sell out America? Why should we implode it? Why should we turn it over to the communist Chinese all because they work with the Rockefellers?
[14:47.000 --> 14:55.000]  In 1949, our government put him in power. That's all declassified. So here's some of the other articles. Here's Drudge Report.
[14:55.000 --> 15:04.000]  Soros. Everything has gone wrong. He says he's living in his own bubble. That's right. You're living in your own bubble.
[15:04.000 --> 15:11.000]  You thought you'd have a global corporate private government. He's a major Rothschild agent, and that you'd loot all these countries through oligarchs you controlled,
[15:11.000 --> 15:19.000]  and that you'd always be tax exempt, and you'd be above the law, and you'd have diplomatic immunity, and then your son would be on TV at Alistair Crowley Rituals.
[15:19.000 --> 15:26.000]  Half the Google images are in Alistair Crowley Rituals, and you'd be involved in all this horrible crap and funding cop killing and funding racism,
[15:26.000 --> 15:33.000]  and you'd bully me and sue me and shut us all up, and you'd bully Hungary and you'd bully Poland and you'd bully everywhere, every election.
[15:33.000 --> 15:41.000]  From Italy to you name it, they're overthrowing you. They're turning against you. You thought you'd march in 10 million Islamic age men the last six years,
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  and then march in 20 million after that and let them rape and kill and say it's okay and use political correctness.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  You may have some of the Stockholm syndrome people going along with it.
[15:49.000 --> 15:57.000]  Alright, that's Alex Jones breaking it all down again. Trump standing up for America to the globalist. You've seen the famous memes. It's glorious.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones.
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we haven't in Fuller's life. It'd take hours.
[16:05.000 --> 16:14.000]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[16:14.000 --> 16:22.000]  It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months. It's got the preglonone. That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.

[19:37.000 --> 19:50.000]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit, and it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[19:50.000 --> 20:11.000]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[20:20.000 --> 20:42.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[20:42.000 --> 20:50.000]  All right, and we're going back to Alex Jones, who's breaking down the latest from the G7 Summit.
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  One magnificent photo sums up Donald Trump's G7 visit.
[21:16.000 --> 21:25.000]  They try to spin it like this shows Trump is weak. No, in negotiation, they have no cards. They're bankrupt. They're a joke. We're in the best political position, the best in composition.
[21:25.000 --> 21:36.000]  They were planning on dictating like the unelected head of EU Yunker, the Nazi air said, I'll destroy Trump in one year. The Communist Chinese president a year and a half ago went to Davos and said, I will defeat America with you.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  They all signed on.
[21:38.000 --> 21:49.000]  So this is the alignment of power. Communist China, with all of our industry and jobs moved there by globalist design, they all brag about the Chinese century is over for America for 50 years.
[21:49.000 --> 22:04.000]  China, a billion, 800 million radical Islamists, the EU, unelected bureaucracy, Hollywood and the big banks, but none of that means anything when populations know you're authoritarian frauds.
[22:04.000 --> 22:11.000]  So there it all is, ladies and gentlemen, and that's up on Real Alex Jones on Twitter. Please retweet that image.
[22:11.000 --> 22:22.000]  This image tells everybody what they should know, understand what's happening to Soros, understand that they understand that, yes, we are the rise of anti-establishment.
[22:22.000 --> 22:35.000]  You know what's scaring them in Italy and Brazil? They have coalition governments forming of liberals and conservatives against Soros, against globalism, against foreign banks, against these foreign outside groups running our lives.
[22:35.000 --> 22:45.000]  It is simply over the top that this is happening. People get, wait, foreign megabanks that don't pay taxes are telling me about women's issues and telling me about gay rights.
[22:45.000 --> 22:52.000]  And while they bring in radical Muslims that throw us off buildings, wait, wait, the economy's coming back and how did Trump do this?
[22:52.000 --> 23:01.000]  Because there were artificial systems meant to make us poor, to control us, study feudalism, search that term. Well, this is neo feudalism.
[23:01.000 --> 23:08.000]  This is neo feudalism. This is a new system in their own words of the ancient system.
[23:08.000 --> 23:16.000]  As Soros says, he recently minted the rise of President Trump, the anti-established parties across the globe, saying everything that could go wrong has gone wrong.
[23:16.000 --> 23:20.000]  Soros made the comment and interviewed the Washington Post.
[23:20.000 --> 23:32.000]  This is a guy that overthrew more than 15 countries, looted their treasuries. He was known as a total criminal to the 90s, and then he spent billions in PR about what a great, wonderful person he is.
[23:32.000 --> 23:45.000]  Look, hey Trump, what magic wand do you have to get us past a 3% growth rate? High unemployment, gone, record low unemployment, bad trade deals, gone.
[23:45.000 --> 23:53.000]  Paris Climate Accord, total fraud, one-sided for the West, gone. High taxes, regulations massively cut. Obama's legacy, boom, boom.
[23:53.000 --> 24:01.000]  And for the next act, Hillary levitated into prison. Hillary for prison. Who launched that program? Yours truly.
[24:01.000 --> 24:14.000]  So people ask, how are we doing this? It's a want for freedom and a renaissance. And it's in corporations, it's in private individuals, it's in churches, it's in families of every race, color, and creed.
[24:14.000 --> 24:26.000]  It beats in the human breast the desire. And it is in U.S. intelligence agencies and British intelligence agencies and foreign intelligence agencies, not at the top, but at every other level that know the truth.
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.000]  The globalists thought they'd use the Internet to control us and track us, and they got great power and made trillions off of it.
[24:31.000 --> 24:39.000]  But we woke up in the process, and humanity has bigger plans than the Rockefellers, and all these people that are already dead and are in the ash pit of history.
[24:39.000 --> 24:47.000]  Their whole program thought we were such country bumpkins that we couldn't grasp big multinational systems ruling our lives from afar through different layers of bureaucracy.
[24:47.000 --> 24:55.000]  We had 1776 over a faraway king, and fake courts ruling over us. America's instincts are against this.
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.000]  And that's all I am is America's instinct coming back. And you look at that photo of Trump.
[25:01.000 --> 25:07.000]  He left, he was there a day and a half, he left just hours ago, and he said, trade war with all of you that have one-sided deals.
[25:07.000 --> 25:14.000]  He said, you say we're putting in tariffs? Canada, you've got massive tariffs. Germany, you've got double the tariffs. France, you've got tariffs.
[25:14.000 --> 25:20.000]  You cut those tariffs by half, or we're going to have a trade war. Oh my God, you can't do that. We have no tariffs.
[25:20.000 --> 25:27.000]  They have a tariff. If it's a $30,000 car we sell, it's $60,000 when it translates to euros. Same as the dollar.
[25:27.000 --> 25:34.000]  The euro's a little bit below the dollar. I mean, it's double. We don't put any damn tariffs on it.
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  Germany puts emission standards that the EU does that we can't even follow, and then they don't follow them themselves.
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  It's all called a screw job. China's got dozens of ghost cities that millions of people could live in.
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.000]  They're just building giant highways and maglev rails everywhere off our money, off the $900 billion.
[25:50.000 --> 26:03.000]  And Fareed Zakaria goes on. Bill Maher goes, Trump just hates Chinese people. No, he hates communist ally with our globalist controllers screwing us over.
[26:03.000 --> 26:10.000]  And that's all these guys have got. Parlang, America in 1955, had half the world's wealth and was 4% of the world's population.
[26:10.000 --> 26:19.000]  96% had the other half. People go, oh my God, redistributed. We could have distributed our ideas of capitalism to them, the better sections of it,
[26:19.000 --> 26:26.000]  and freed everything, and even lowered population. That's in the world population report the UN put out. In 49, they knew all this.
[26:26.000 --> 26:34.000]  But they decided on this path to exploit the third world, balloon giant populations, then turn them as leftist ideology against the West,
[26:34.000 --> 26:42.000]  and in reverse colonization bring down the West, but have globalist corporations above the law separate from those corporations and separate from those systems above the law.
[26:42.000 --> 26:52.000]  And Trump is destroying it all with precision, with the patriots backing him and the original global plan of 1776 worldwide.
[26:52.000 --> 26:59.000]  But to lead that plan, America has to come back to dominance. We have to come back as an example of telling the truth where people can trust us.
[26:59.000 --> 27:06.000]  Suddenly everybody wants to do deals with us again, because we're not treacherous, and then we could export our ideas and our technology and all the stuff we've suppressed.
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.000]  Because the globalists have been holding back. They didn't give China one-tenth of what we got. I mean, America is the place.
[27:12.000 --> 27:20.000]  It's divine right, ladies and gentlemen. It's real. It's providence. It is manifest destiny. And Info Wars is part of that manifest destiny,
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.000]  that I would start Info Wars, that I would come out of Texas, that I would do all this without any people behind me or anything.
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.000]  But now it's all synced up, like they say on Bill Maher. I'm synced up with Trump because they are freaked out,
[27:31.000 --> 27:37.000]  because I can tell you what Trump's going to say before he says it, because it's all part of a mission that's next level.
[27:37.000 --> 27:44.000]  We don't have to write it down. We don't have to do anything. It's already there. The Japanese and the Koreans, South Koreans, everybody else,
[27:44.000 --> 27:53.000]  to line up against Trump. And when all the globalists in the EU and the Communist Chinese came over in that photo, they've already drawn the battle lines.
[27:53.000 --> 27:59.000]  They already know the truth. Here it is. The battle lines are drawn, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:59.000 --> 28:08.000]  The battle lines are drawn with Eastern Europe, the Japanese, the South Koreans, everybody with Trump in the United States,
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.000]  with the unelected EU and the Chinese Chinese. There's wider videos of Chinese communists.
[28:13.000 --> 28:20.000]  Anyways, it's all there. And the battle lines are drawn, ladies and gentlemen, and people are going to decide what side they're on.
[28:20.000 --> 28:27.000]  All we want is fairness. All we want is free market. All we want is an open society and not to be overthrown by the guy that calls his group,
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  the open society, because it's the opposite. Soros is a devil. Whatever he says, it's the opposite.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's it for this live transmission. Trump is delivering. He's representing America.
[28:37.000 --> 28:42.000]  But by doing that, it's killing the big global parasite. It's set up as an end goal.
[28:42.000 --> 28:49.000]  Okay, of course, that's not it for the live Sunday show here. That was Alex recording live earlier, breaking the G7 down.
[28:49.000 --> 28:55.000]  We'll be right back on the other side where Alex breaks down the information that he's been receiving on Anthony Bourdain.
[28:55.000 --> 29:20.000]  You're not going to want to miss this.
[29:26.000 --> 29:32.000]  If you don't know what it's done for me and so many others for stamina, focus, libido, it does so many things.
[29:32.000 --> 29:38.000]  X2, even though we're having trouble sourcing the deep earth crystals of the good halogen iodine,
[29:38.000 --> 29:45.000]  I am blowing out the stockpile of it we have at least for another few days at 50% off.
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.000]  And then after that, it's going to go back to full price until we secure more of it.

[32:03.000 --> 32:11.000]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including
[32:11.000 --> 32:17.000]  promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[32:17.000 --> 32:26.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[32:26.000 --> 32:34.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[32:34.000 --> 32:37.000]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[32:37.000 --> 32:41.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[32:41.000 --> 32:46.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[32:46.000 --> 32:51.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[32:51.000 --> 32:54.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[32:54.000 --> 33:00.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[33:25.000 --> 33:29.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:37.000 --> 33:49.000]  This gentleman Alex Jones here live broadcasting from my hotel room with an emergency transmission update that is absolutely critical.
[33:49.000 --> 33:56.000]  Now, I want to be clear. I got up because I'm here in Hawaii at about 4 a.m.
[33:56.000 --> 34:07.000]  and I noticed that an army source of mine had sent me a link that Anthony Bordeaux had just died
[34:07.000 --> 34:14.000]  and that they were saying it was a suicide out of the gates and that that was suspicious when they say something's a suicide when it's first announced.
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.000]  They always say police are looking into it, at least for a day or so, and then you hear suicide.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  Whenever you hear it right away, it's very suspicious.
[34:21.000 --> 34:32.000]  An individual I was talking to has been in the highest levels of security details, protecting Hillary Clinton, George W. Bush, you name it,
[34:32.000 --> 34:37.000]  and he thought it was very, very suspicious. Bordeaux knew a lot of secrets.
[34:37.000 --> 34:44.000]  He had become very, very famous first writing, a tell all book about the secrets of being a top chef.
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.000]  But I tweeted out that, hey, if I commit suicide, I didn't commit suicide, I was killed.
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.000]  I said he was enemies more and more with the Clintons, but I said he also said bad things about Trump.
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.000]  He'd serve him hemlock as a joke.
[34:57.000 --> 35:00.000]  But Bordeaux was the only successful person on CNN.
[35:00.000 --> 35:08.000]  Ordain was a superstar internationally and really respected. He was becoming really good friends with Elon Musk.
[35:08.000 --> 35:18.000]  Well, I got a emergency phone call from one of the producers saying one of our best sources wants to talk to you.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  He's really upset and it all clicked.
[35:20.000 --> 35:28.000]  I went, oh my God, he told me off air months ago and on air just a few weeks ago that you'd look for other big Hollywood icon type people.
[35:28.000 --> 35:35.000]  He told me off air Anthony Bordeaux saying that he had helped produce with Elon Musk.
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  This individual works with SpaceX in other areas.
[35:39.000 --> 35:49.000]  This piece with Bordeaux and that Bordeaux had been challenged by Elon Musk to go public and to talk about his experiences and what he knew.
[35:49.000 --> 35:58.000]  And to basically do a full Kanye, a fully woke. And so I knew about this and then it totally clicked.
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  This was about like six in the morning, Hawaii time of that time to wake up.
[36:02.000 --> 36:08.000]  So I wrote a bunch of notes here. You can see some of them are on hotel coasters.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  And these are the notes that the gentleman basically laid out to me.
[36:11.000 --> 36:24.000]  I know the gentleman is his family is well known and wealthy, to say the least, and he has been involved in armies, special operations, armies, psychological operations.
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  And he's even said I can say who he is now.
[36:26.000 --> 36:32.000]  But at this point, I said, I'll give you some time to cool off before we do that.
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  Right now, he told me this about an hour and a half ago right now.
[36:35.000 --> 36:45.000]  He's in hot water with folks, but we had to do this in case they try to kill him or myself because here's the bottom line.
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.000]  Ordain was 61 years old, he had a happy nine year old daughter.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  He'd just gotten remarried. He'd never been happier.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  He had been friends with Elon Musk for a long time.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  He was becoming best friends with Musk.
[36:55.000 --> 37:03.000]  Musk is fully awake to globalism, the New World Order, the whole brainwashing system, the post human system they're trying to set up.
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.000]  He's been saying everything that I told you 20 years ago when I put an end game 11 years ago.
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  Not because he's following what I said, but because that's what the globalist are planning.
[37:10.000 --> 37:16.000]  He's been let in at the highest levels into their meetings because he's a high IQ guy and a multi-billionaire.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  And now he's under Soros attack and others trying to hostile takeover.
[37:20.000 --> 37:30.000]  So they were in Marrakesh, Morocco two months ago, kicking off the taping of his new season 0.0 as the production company he owns his own show.
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.000]  And Musk and him had already been hanging out there in Morocco for four or five days,
[37:36.000 --> 37:48.000]  really discussing what was happening, what was going on up on this big vista where they had this high tech science lab connected to some of the leaders of Morocco.
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.000]  And so they're out there doing the shoot.
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.000]  You'll remember a few months ago when one of our guests was from Morocco.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  That was all going on then in Morocco then.
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  And they were discussing all these things and he was really deprogramming him.
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.000]  And Anthony Bordeaux was kind of coming out of his shell, the Kanye West thing that started to happen.
[38:09.000 --> 38:18.000]  And then more of his shows became this whole woke thing globally to what was happening in a pro human future and pro space exploration,
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.000]  not a post industrial world, not a globalist depopulation planet.
[38:23.000 --> 38:30.000]  Not this thing where the AI gods take over that Musk and others warned about that Google and others are embracing and saying humans are bad.
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  We need to post human world.
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.000]  So Bordeaux has been anti-Trump, anti-Hillary, anti-Winstein.
[38:37.000 --> 38:44.000]  He's really written things about Henry Kissinger that are true that are very bold for somebody who's respected by liberals.
[38:44.000 --> 38:51.000]  And it's because he was seen as somebody even more than Kanye West who could double Trump's numbers with black voters.
[38:51.000 --> 38:58.000]  He was seen as somebody to be the final domino to fall because he's so respected by liberals out there.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  And he was showing signs of a conscience.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  He was realizing what was happening.
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.000]  He was aware of all the government sex trafficking and the things that were going on.
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  And he was beginning to talk about working that into his show.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  He was working that into his show.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  And the word has come down now.
[39:14.000 --> 39:21.000]  We actually have the almost 12 minute video clip that is the episode in Morocco.
[39:21.000 --> 39:28.000]  But the 12 minutes sit down in the 45 minute hour long episode of the 45 minutes is actual program, actual show.
[39:28.000 --> 39:33.000]  Our sources have the 11 minute 50 second clip.
[39:33.000 --> 39:42.000]  If they ever think that they're going to now grab it and make it all a retrospective about Bourdain and mix in his old episodes and change it.
[39:42.000 --> 39:48.000]  They got nothing coming because Bourdain had final cut, but his company didn't.
[39:48.000 --> 39:55.000]  And so just like Stanley Kubrick put out eyes wide shut, when he had the final cut done, he had final cut power, but he refused to cut 24 minutes.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  He died instantly.
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.000]  And I've talked to his daughter who was his protege and the stuff she told me was off record.
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.000]  But let me just tell you, it all fits together.
[40:05.000 --> 40:13.000]  I've also talked to the linens and what they told me is off record, but it all fits together just for my information.
[40:13.000 --> 40:20.000]  But I almost at this point almost don't want to know stuff in confidence anymore because like the Narls Barkley song.
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.000]  Well, I was crazy not because I didn't know anything because I knew too much.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  So that's all going on.
[40:26.000 --> 40:32.000]  So I'm seeing is one of the only venues where people could actually get this stuff out where people aren't scared.
[40:32.000 --> 40:37.000]  And I've been told by the Pentagon and other patriots the highest levels that they fear Trump.
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  They fear Donald Trump Jr. They fear Matt Drudge.
[40:40.000 --> 40:46.000]  They feared Anthony because he was starting to wake up to what was going on with some financial with the left and others.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  And internationally he was such a star.
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  And they fear yours truly.
[40:52.000 --> 41:01.000]  And it's not like I'm proud to be saying this is very dangerous position to be in, but they really fear almost more than anybody except Trump right now.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  Elon Musk and Elon needs to go public.
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.000]  I've already been saying that he's been going public against the media.
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  He's been going public against the AI takeover plan.
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  But Elon, this was a message to Elon Musk.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  This is the takeaway.
[41:15.000 --> 41:23.000]  Anthony Order was getting ready to go public and said he was pro-human, bring the parties together, don't hate Trump.
[41:23.000 --> 41:24.000]  Let's work together.
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  Let's have a human future.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  Let's not be a neugenics.
[41:27.000 --> 41:32.000]  I think Elon Musk message of truth and Alex Jones message because it's just the truth.
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  Kanye West.
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  In fact, he specifically talked about the bigger plan.
[41:36.000 --> 41:43.000]  So when I was at Lewis Farrakhan's house two years ago, he goes, you know, Kanye comes by and he likes a bigger plan.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  And they looked at me because I hadn't been let in on the code word yet.
[41:46.000 --> 41:57.000]  And Farrakhan said what you want about it is a major game changer, tea person, just like Bordeaux could be or, you know, any of these people.
[41:57.000 --> 42:04.000]  So it's just absolutely mind boggling right now to know this is going on.
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  Know this is happening.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  I'm going to try to be calm and come back from break.

[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  I was on this trip with my kids for eight days, but we don't have a future if I don't do this.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  So I will be here as much as I need to be.
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  I'm very humbled to be in this position to have this type of information, but I have talked to the folks at SpaceX.
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.000]  I have talked to people inside my organization right there at the top of it.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  And I am breaking down to you what is going on here.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  CNN will absolutely be in dreaded fear that we...
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  I mean, I was asked today, I said, should we release the 11 minute 50 second clip?
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  And I said, let's hold off while you're hot right now, while you're upset.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  I'm not going to say you are yet. They already know who you are.

[47:03.000 --> 47:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:11.000 --> 47:23.000]  But the word is already is that they're going to grab these episodes because there's this big awakening already happening.
[47:23.000 --> 47:29.000]  It hit a catalyst in Morocco a few months ago and then now it chain reaction into this.
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  It's all happening everywhere across the world.
[47:31.000 --> 47:37.000]  But as these prominent people begin to wake up and go with humanity and go with life and go with pro-human,
[47:37.000 --> 47:43.000]  there's an absolute panic by the globalists going on in there trying to send a message by going after Bourdain.
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  You can clearly see that the threat in everybody else.
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  We'll be right back on the other side of this break.
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.000]  This is an emergency global transmission newswords.com.
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  We will continue to go in through and beyond no matter what the cost may be.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  We'll go on to the end to quote Winston Churchill.
[48:00.000 --> 48:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live global Friday transmission.
[48:06.000 --> 48:15.000]  Anthony Bourdain was one of the number one hosts in the world.
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  The only success CNN had, he was branching out.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  He was planning to do programs on child trafficking, human sex trafficking.
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  He had become best friends with Elon Musk.
[48:24.000 --> 48:33.000]  He had spent close to a week in Morocco two months ago at a private home with a scientific research facility.
[48:33.000 --> 48:38.000]  And we have the 11 minute 52nd clip that they want cut out.
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  We're able to bring that to you.
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  It's been offered to us, but we're not going to air that here at this point.
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  The CNN or anybody says we're lying about this.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  We'll drop the hammer on you.
[48:49.000 --> 48:50.000]  I won't drop the hammer on you.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  Somebody's going to drop the hammer on you.
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  They didn't want this clip to come out.
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  They didn't want this information to come out.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  He was calling for a global awakening.
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  He was understanding that Democrats are actually pro-war.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  They've been funding ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.000]  He understood that the Republican establishment was just as bad as well.
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.000]  And that all these people claiming they were liberals weren't really liberals.
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.000]  And that Trump had a bigger plan, a new Renaissance plan.
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.000]  And Elon Musk had convinced him of this.
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.000]  And so Bourdain was preparing, just like Kanye West and just like Kim Kardashian,
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  to begin to reach out to Trump.
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.000]  It's like she came to the White House last week on getting black people out of prison
[49:29.000 --> 49:35.000]  who were given racist sentences because of what color they were.
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.000]  She had the perfect way for her to reach out and show that Trump's good and have him
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  move towards getting those laws changed, which he's now announced.
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  The Clintons got it passed in 94 saying blacks were animals
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  and it needed to be made to heal like dogs.
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  Remember that?
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  Well, Trump thinks that's wrong.
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  And so all this was about to happen.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  And Bourdain was aware of what was happening.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  And the Clintons were failing.
[49:59.000 --> 50:00.000]  They were falling.
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  He was starting to come out and criticizing Hillary.
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.000]  He was starting to come out and criticize others like Weinstein.
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.000]  And he was about to become not a conservative, not even a nationalist.
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  He's a true international guy, but in a good sense.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  He really wants, he wanted peace and love.
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  He's spoken out against Kissinger.
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  He's spoken out against you.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  He said, I'll serve him locked to Trump back when he was buying in the bull.
[50:22.000 --> 50:29.000]  But he was getting ready via, via what was happening with Elon Musk to be a real
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  leader and to go meet with Trump and to go public.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  That's really the big news here.
[50:33.000 --> 50:37.000]  And now he's died mysteriously in a hotel room, a crappy hotel room.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  Right when he just got remarried.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  Right when he has a nine year old daughter that's so happy.
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.000]  Right when he told Elon Musk and others that he's the happiest he's ever been.
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  This magically happens ladies and gentlemen.
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  The only guy, only guy successful in their entire system.
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  And everybody liked him because he had a little bit of humanity to him,
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.000]  compared to somebody like Wolf Blitzer, somebody like Brian Stelter,
[50:59.000 --> 51:00.000]  somebody like Hillary Clinton.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  Now he's dead.
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  Now he's dead.
[51:03.000 --> 51:08.000]  And they just say, boom, suicide, boom, move on.
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  Boom, that's it.
[51:09.000 --> 51:10.000]  Just don't look at it.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  Don't have a discussion, nothing to see here.
[51:12.000 --> 51:13.000]  That is ridiculous.
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.000]  I have, from SpaceX sources, as I'm sitting there,
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  ready to go have breakfast with my children,
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.000]  because I'm six hours ahead from the East Coast,
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  five hours ahead from Central,
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  three hours ahead from Pacific,
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  four hours ahead from Mountain.
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  It's 903 here where I'm at 904.
[51:34.000 --> 51:37.000]  And when I come back, I'm just going to read these notes to you.
[51:37.000 --> 51:42.000]  I wrote, I've got one, two, three, four, five, six.
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  I see seven pages of notes.
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  One of them is a coaster.
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  And it says, culture will speak from the dead.
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  I dare them to say it's open and shut.
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  Also, they said it was critical to play the clip,
[51:56.000 --> 51:57.000]  but I never told you guys to do this,
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  of Bourdain and Obama in Vietnam.
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  When they first sit down and talk,
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  how much Bourdain didn't like Obama,
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  and some of the things he told Elon Musk,
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  they knew that Bourdain knew things
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.000]  that he wasn't supposed to know.
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.000]  And they didn't even tell me everything.
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  This is super dangerous.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  I'm risking my life even telling you this stuff,
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  and that we have the clue.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  Go ahead and try me CNN.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  We'll drop the hammer on you so fast.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  We'll be back stay with us.
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  The strange days are going to try to destroy us.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  The question is, will we let that happen?
[52:30.000 --> 52:33.000]  Dr. Nick Begich, a scientist, researcher,
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  major native lands leader,
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  his brother, former U.S. senator,
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  his father, famous congressman,
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  so much for the civil rights movement,
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  Moore, who died very mysteriously.
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  He's about to take over.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  I wanted to just let you know that
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  I'm on vacation with family.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  I got a very desperate call from one of the producers
[52:51.000 --> 52:56.000]  at one of our top Pentagon SpaceX sources,
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  had called us,
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  and that he had already told me
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  that he'd take a special report in Morocco
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.000]  with Elon Musk that it was with Anthony Bourdain.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  But at six o'clock in the morning then when this happened,
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  it's nine o'clock now when I first got this news,
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  and then it all started to click.
[53:14.000 --> 53:17.000]  So I called our source back and he went over the whole thing.
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.000]  He was there.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  It was obviously, they know who it is on the inside.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  It was at his home with his family,
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  and there in Morocco with their big facility.
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  And of course, when it comes out who he is,
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  by those who basically runs Morocco.
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  And so you've got Elon Musk
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  and you've got Anthony Bourdain
[53:35.000 --> 53:39.000]  at this big facility overlooking the vista on the ocean.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  And they spent days out there,
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  and Musk is already really good friends with,
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  or was good friends with Mr. Bourdain.
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  And of course, Musk is telling you everything.
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  I tell you, world government, AI takeover.
[53:51.000 --> 53:52.000]  We got to stop it.
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  They plan to get rid of humans.
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  The decision's been made.
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  We got to struggle against it.
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  The media's lying to you.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  They're your enemies.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  They want to stop human progress.
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.000]  And so let me just read to you the notes
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.000]  that I was given.
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  And again, I was already told this months ago.
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  Also, Ashton Kutcher.
[54:09.000 --> 54:12.000]  He was about to go public in all of this.
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.000]  I was told a month before she went to the line house
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  about the same source that they call it...
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  Well, they have several terms for it,
[54:24.000 --> 54:28.000]  but full spectrum reality.
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  They have a lot of terms.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  Full spectrum drama.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  Where Trump and others in the Patriot leadership
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.000]  recruited Kanye five years ago
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  when they decided to make this move.
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  The military was going to carry out a coup against Obama
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  because he was signing us over the Chinese.
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  They did the Office of Personnel Management Act,
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  21 million names of all our spies,
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  all our people, all their families.
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  The keys of the kingdom.
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  Apple's now moved there,
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  giving them all the keys to all Apple users.
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  You're a cloud code.
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.000]  That's Reuters.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  I mean, we're already pretty much been taken over
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.000]  by the Chinese.
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  They're not Hollywood.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  They're taken over the universities.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  I mean, it is mega level.
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  The last dish effort was made with Trump.
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  He reached out to Kanye.
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  He reached out to Kim Kardashian.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  She was on the fence.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  Kanye went with it.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  That's why they locked him up in a mental institution
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  about a year and a half ago.
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  He was going to already launch this,
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  but they had let him go.
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  They did that whole act where they can say something's wrong with you
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  and then grab you for a few days.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  He was in there, but he powered through it.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  He's a great hero.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  He has managed everything to lose.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  He stood up because he has everything to gain.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  And so all of that unfolded.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  And so,
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  you've got SpaceX.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  You've got Elon Musk that represents kind of the good
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  faction in NASA that wants to have a pro-human future.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  He doesn't want to suppress a lot of social technologies.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  I told you at the inauguration before Trump spoke
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  that he would talk about unlocking the secrets of the universe.
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  And that he would call for the secret medical technologies.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  They've been suppressed.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  He's not moving forward with that.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  I'm on record because I have the sources,
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  but I want to be honest with you.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  It's metaphysical.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  I have sources, but we all know already.
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  So we're already finishing each other's sentences.
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  That's why they hate us.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  We are plugged in to the internet
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  of the human mind,
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  the human destiny, the human will,
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  what humanity wants.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  And so, yes, we scientifically look at stuff.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  Yes, we talk to each other.
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  Yes, but we're already synced up,
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  just like Bill Martin said last Friday.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  Alex Jones and Donald Trump are soulmates.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  And it's true, we're all soulmates.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  There's billions of people that are soulmates
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  with black skin, with white skin, with red skin,
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  with yellow skin, with pink skin,
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  with sunburn skin.
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  We are all together in this big quest
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  and this love of humanity, the love of our ancestors,
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  the love of the Great Quest.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  And there's people that want to satanically block that
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  and still the future, and it's not happening.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  So I'm going to go to Dr. Nick Begich after the break
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  or just a minute, but let me just give you these notes.
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  Culture will speak
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  from the dead.
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  They've opened and shut, said that he died.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  It's preposterous.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  Mordain was not having any of it.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  He was ready to stand against it.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  He was finally convinced by Elon Musk
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  of what was really going on
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  and shown the proof.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  The proof of the child trafficking
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  and things that he'd seen himself
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  that didn't put Tudor together
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  is what made him have nightmares
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  and basically break down.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  He came out of the depression
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  and wouldn't talk about what he was going to do except saying
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  he liked what Kanye had done
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  and was planning to go public
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  and wanted to perhaps even meet with Trump
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  publicly to say we should have unity and world peace.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  He liked the fact that he,
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  that Trump wants to work with Russia
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  and the fact that he understood that
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  Mordain understood that that was all made up.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  Mordain didn't like the pressure.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  He was put under by CNN
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  to come out.
[57:46.000 --> 57:51.000]  Both is quick and too basic.
[58:17.000 --> 58:18.000]  Leading competitors
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  have a procurement level of 3%.
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  From there we've got dozens and dozens
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  and dozens of other game changing products
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  that you and your family will absolutely love
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  and will help support the broadcast.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  It is critical that you go to
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  infowarstore.com
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  and look at some of those items for yourself
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  whether it's water filtration, air filtration,
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  non-GMO heirloom seeds,
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  X2, it's all there

[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  or oral cleansing formula
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  just a small spray will help you stay clean

[59:47.000 --> 59:50.000]  that's infowarslife.com
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  The piggy bank that everybody's robbing
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  and that ends.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  At the top of the list was the issue of trade
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  very important subject
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  because the United States has been taking advantage of
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  for decades and decades
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  and we can't do that anymore.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  We had extremely productive discussions
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  on the need to have fair and reciprocal
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  meaning the same.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  People can't charge us 270%
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  and we charge them nothing
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  that doesn't work anymore.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  I made a lot of statements
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  having to do with clarity.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  We want and expect other nations
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  to provide fair market access
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  to American exports
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  and that we will take whatever steps
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  necessary to protect American industry
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  and workers from unfair foreign trading
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  practices of which really there are many
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  but we're getting them straightened out
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  slowly but surely.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  I think they are starting to be committed
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  to a much more fair trade situation
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  for the United States
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  because it has been treated very, very unfairly
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  and I don't blame other leaders for that.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  I blame our past leaders.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  There was no reason that this should have happened.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  No tariffs.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  In other words, let's say Canada
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  where we have tremendous tariffs
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  the United States pays tremendous tariffs
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  and dairy, as an example, 270%
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  nobody knows that.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  We pay nothing. We don't want to pay anything.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  Why should we pay?
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  We have to, ultimately, that's what you want.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  You want a tariff free,
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  you want no barriers
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  and you want no subsidies
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  because you have some cases where
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  countries are subsidizing industries
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  and that's not fair.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  I mean, we have India where some of the tariffs
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  are 100%
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  and we charge nothing.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  We can't do that
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  and so we are talking to many countries
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  we're talking to all countries
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  and it's going to stop
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  and I don't blame these people
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  but I will blame them if they don't act smart
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  and do what they have to do
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  because they have no choice.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  I'll be honest with you, they have no choice.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  They're either going to make the trade fair
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  because our farmers
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  have been hurt.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  You look at our farmers, for 15 years
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  the graph is going just like this, down.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Our farmers have been hurt,
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  our workers have been hurt,
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  our companies have moved out
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  and moved to Mexico and other countries
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  including Canada.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  Now, we are going to fix that situation
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  and if it's not fixed
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  we're not going to deal with these countries
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  but the relationship that I've had
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  is great, so you can tell that
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  to your fake friends at CNN
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  the relationship that I've had
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  with the people
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  the leaders of these countries
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  has been, I would really rate it
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  on a scale of 0 to 10
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  I would rate it at 10.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  As an example, the European Union
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  is brutal to the United States
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  they don't take
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  and they understand that, they know it
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  when I'm telling them, they're smiling at me
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  you know, it's like the gig is up
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  it's like the gig is up
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  they're not trying to, there's nothing they can say
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  they can't believe they got away with it
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  I asked a top person in China
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  how did it get so bad
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  he looked at me and said
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  nobody ever talked to us
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  President Trump even called
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  for the re-admittance of Russia to the G7
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  thus making it the G8
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Russia had been suspended from the group
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  in 2014 due to the annexation
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  of Crimea from the Ukraine
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  members were against that idea
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  I would rather see Russia in
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  the G8 as opposed to the G7
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  I would say that the G8
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  is a more meaningful group
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  than the G7
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  President Trump then left the G7
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  for Singapore on a mission to
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  negotiate peace with Kim Jong-un
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  of North Korea
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  Meanwhile, Russian President
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Vladimir Putin has tasked
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  Austria with the possibility
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  of being the meeting place between
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  President Trump and the Russian leader
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  as Chancellor Merkel's plea
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  for a new world order
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  sounds off the globalist panic
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  to despair
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  John Bowne reporting for
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  KTVU
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  Well, we employed a series of tests
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  for heavy metals, alkalinity
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  and pH
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  What we learned was that there was in fact
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  acidity in the rainwater
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  Next, we tested the water from our
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  Alexa pure gravity filter
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  and not only were the heavy metal levels
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  within safe measure
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  but the pH was also restored
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  to optimal levels
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  raises the pH of the water
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  and acid rain can contaminate
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  a rainwater supply
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  system will purify it
[1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  Waging war on corruption
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:06.000]  It's Alex Jones
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  Coming to you live from the
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  front lines of the Info War
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  And now, your host
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  Owen Troyer
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  Alright ladies and gentlemen
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  Some of the headlines
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  today
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  It's going to be a big week ahead
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  with
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  Trump and
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  Kim Jong Un meeting in Singapore
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  That's going to be huge
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  You've got
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  Soros freaking out right now
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  That Trump is actually winning
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  You have John Brennan
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  saying that Trump
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  is a temporary aberration
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  So yes, the people in control
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  of the country is a temporary aberration
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  according to John Brennan
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  No, you and the scum like
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  you are the temporary aberration
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  John Brennan
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  So you've got all of that going on
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  You know, this is
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  actually an interesting recipe here
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  The Democrats are saying in order to run
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  for president in 2020
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  you have to be registered to the Democrat Party
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  So that strikes Bernie Sanders out
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  So if Bernie Sanders runs as an independent
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  Trump has the easiest path to victory
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  of presidential elections
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  But I'm already expecting that to happen
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  Folks, we are about to protest Bill Clinton
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  and it's all possible with your support

[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  And we are about to protest Bill Clinton
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  outside Bass Concert Hall
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  on a response to Bill Maher
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  You want to have a good future
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  If you want to have a shot at controlling your own destiny
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  you want to listen to me right now very carefully
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  Globalism is a form
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  of modern serfdom
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  in their own white papers, their own admissions
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  as even in the WikiLeaks
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  But Bill Maher and others are now being honest
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  They're coming out and saying they want to crash
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  the U.S. economy
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  to defeat
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  the operations that Donald Trump is
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  running right now
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  Even in their policies before this
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  is to implode our economy
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  They want us dependent
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  They don't want us to be upwardly mobile
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  because they can't compete with a true capitalist
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  to open free market society
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  They want a crony capitalist society
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  where the ultra-elites decide the winners
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  That's why all the top billionaires
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  All the top guys that make like 12 billion a day
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  like Jeff Bezos
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  are anti-free market, anti-middle class
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  anti-family
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  Bloomberg came out and said
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  there's no way more taxes
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  when he escapes 99% of his taxes
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  in offshore corporations
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  Look it up
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  So here is Bill Maher the eugenicist
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  Bill Maher the globalist
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  the man of the people saying he wants America
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  to implode
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  Can I ask about the economy
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  because this economy is going pretty well
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  We have to...what?
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  Why is that funny?
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  It is going well for now
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  For now, right
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  I feel like the bottom has to fall out
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  at some point and by the way, I'm hoping for it
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  because I think one way you get rid of Trump
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  is a crashing economy
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  so please bring on the recession
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  Sorry if that hurts people
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  but it's either root for a recession
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  or you lose your democracy
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  I've told you thousands of times
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  they want to, quote, crash the economy
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  and now they say it to your face
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  as if that's a good thing for you
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  but then he elaborated in the same program
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  about to show you some clips
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  This management of Trump has done this
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  and it's hurting America's power worldwide
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  No, that's the stolen power of America
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  parlayed into the global corporations
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  that are tax-exempt
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  and that power is coming to an end
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  Come with me
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  What I did not predict
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  was that the United States
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  would sort of abdicate leadership
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  of its position
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  because I argued the United States would still be incredibly powerful
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  it would set the agenda
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  it represented the values
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  and it had a way of being able to be the leader
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  and this shift where the United States
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  has decided to literally
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  just walk away from its own creation
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  I mean, people forget
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  this was the world that FDR and Harry Truman
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  built after World War II
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  and to see, you know, the Europeans
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  they say it's sort of surprised
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  because they don't quite understand it
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  they're like, wait, you built this house
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  and now you want to set it on fire
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  OC Farid
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  and the CFR and the media told us
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  that the country was over
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  it was the communist-Chinese century
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  they told us it was over
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  but see, now it's not over
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  so they spin that as if it's a bad thing for America
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  here's the truth
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  and they admit it in their own economic papers
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  building first-world economies
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  pulls up the third world
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  lowering first-world economies does not pull up the third world
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  that's the line of globalism
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  and so having one side of trade deals
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  destroying the US as a long-term trading partner
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  to India and China and Mexico
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  actually then degrades the whole global economy
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  and that's what the globalists admit
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  they want a post-industrial
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  austere world
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  with poor people worldwide
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  with a tiny elite tax-exempt
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  with diplomatic community who've broken away
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  in a breakaway civilization
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  and the world is learning the real political system
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  they're having elections all over the world
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  throwing the globalist out
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  throwing the IMF, the World Bank out
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  these are predators
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  that want a poor world they control
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  and they give Nigeria a $1 billion loan
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  in 1965
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  Nigeria's now paid almost $100 billion
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  back for that
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  and still owes $20-something billion
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  off the first billion, look it up
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  is that a good deal for Africa? No
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  and when somebody like Muammar Gaddafi
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  comes along and helps Africa
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  and builds it up and works with the West
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  for eight years they set him up and killing
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  but all these so-called liberals
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  center and after they care about you
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  they're really political monsters
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  they're economic hitmen
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  for the globalists that want to consolidate
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  the world economy and don't want
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  a free market to compete with
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  I'm less surprised that a Trump could
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  rise, I mean that's happened in countries
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  where as how quickly
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  the Republican party
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  just completely got behind him
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  it reminds me of
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  the Neanderthals
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  really, I love ancient
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  archaeology and that kind of stuff
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  you have the humans and the Neanderthals
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  who are sharing the planet
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  from about 100,000 BC
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  to about 40,000 BC
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  and then suddenly no more Neanderthals
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  I think because humans
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  they figured out
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  the blowgun
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  so they could kill you from 10 feet away
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  I'm getting this from the movie quest for fire
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  but I think
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  that
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  but it's like there's Neanderthals
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  and then suddenly the fossil gone
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  and that's kind of what happened to the Republicans
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  I think they were just there
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  and then they suddenly disappeared
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  what you just saw is another incredible example
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  of total spin
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  it's like last week when Bill Maher said
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  the FBI wasn't spying on you Trump
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  they were watching you because you're a Russian trader
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  well this week he says
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  oh just like Neanderthal
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  got extincted by Cro Magnon
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  the Republican party
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  is now extinct it's actually exploding
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  and growing everywhere as the populist
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  nationalist movement takes it over
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  as is happening all over the world
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  as humanity awakens to you guys
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  and so we're now aware of your globalist game plan
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  so you are in check mate
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  that's what's happening
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  it's globalism, it's the Democratic party
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  and it's coastal elitism
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  that people are fleeing
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  in record numbers from New York, New Jersey, California
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  you name it to get away
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  from your draconian out of control policies
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  it is your systems of collectivism
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  controlled by crony capitalists
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  that is coming to an end
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  the Republican party is having new life
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  breathed into it because the blue blood scum
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  that also want to keep America's poor
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  is being removed
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  America's return will lead the world
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  into a new boom
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  just like we did during the 1950s
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  America's demise will lead America
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  and the world into
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  a new dark age ladies and gentlemen
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  and we're not going to put up with it
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  we're on the march, the globalists are on the run
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  Soros is getting kicked out of Europe
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  he's voting to throw out the globalist
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  we're winning and scum like Bill Maher
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  hope that you're stupid
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  and hope that they can prey on you and manipulate you
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  those of you that buy in to his propaganda
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  are being conned whether you like it or not
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  and it's time to get past the cognitive distance
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  and admit that
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  Trump was able to defeat the globalists
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  and all their propaganda
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  Trump's been able to turn the economy around in a year and a half
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  because he knows what he's doing
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  and he's advised by very, very smart people
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  so your claims that things are getting so much better by accident
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  flies in the face of reality
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  we are economically
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  politically, culturally and spiritually
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  kicking your ass globalist
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  humanity is now awake
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  sleeping giant is now in your face
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  and is no longer sleeping
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  Alex Jones with newswars.com
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  and it's time for humanity to stand up
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  in the info war
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  and say I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  but you want to fight
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  you better believe you got one
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  from the front lines
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  of the information war
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  it's Alex Jones
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  as the years go by it gets harder and harder

[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  with changes in diet

[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  amino acids, vitamins and minerals

[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  that's why info wars life
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  the new platinum standard

[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  2533139 and thank you all
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  for helping fund the second American Global Revolution
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  infowarslife is bringing you
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  a breakthrough in modern medicine
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  introducing pollen block
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  we have found an extraordinary
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  new natural way to alleviate
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  seasonal distress symptoms
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  including promoting clear nasal
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  and sinus passageways
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  eye comfort and respiratory function
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  in the 1960s
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  researchers in France
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  experienced less seasonal
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  immune and inflammatory responses
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  they began studying this effect
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  in published trials and decades later
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  we now have the fruit of this research
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  a fast-acting, chewable
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  tablet that helps alleviate
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  seasonal distress symptoms
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  pollen block is natural and effective
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  it is not an antihistamine
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  in fact, current research has found
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  that it actually acts by blocking
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  the activity of triptase
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  and inflammatory responses in the body
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  nation of Australia
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  you're on the air worldwide, thanks for holding
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  Hey, Alex, mate
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  I've been following you since I was 14
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  and I'm 32 now
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  I remember back when info wars and prison planet
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  it was just blue text on a white screen
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  and I had to load down the page
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  on my dial up into there
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  and all the DVDs and followed all your guests
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  and I've been using your product since
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  the first iteration of survival shield
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  and since then I'm on the X2
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  the super male vitality, the caveman
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  the real red pill, micro ZX
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  body, it's all amazing
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  Thank you, brother! Yeah, and I wanted to say
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  that by following you so much
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  it's like you're just detoxing the mind
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  the spirit and it's just the more
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  you know God, the more you fear God
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  but the more you chase God
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  and I wanted to say that it's an un-understand
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  side-by-side with you, the crew
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  and the listeners out there, 1776 World War
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  You know how it seems bad
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  and it's chaotic
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  and the enemy's going crazy
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  Well, when you step with your heel
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  on the head of a snake, what happens
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  the rest of that snake's body
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  rides around, wraps around your leg
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  goes crazy causing chaos
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  but it's death throws
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  that's really the key, it's death throws
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  because your heel is still on that snake's head
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  it doesn't matter what the rest of its body is doing
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  its head is pinned and it's over for that snake
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  that's what we're seeing the Illuminati doing
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  That's a beautiful analogy, that's amazing
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  They are riding around in pain
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  and they're going crazy and you see all this chaos
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  because they're in their death rows
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  we're literally witnessing the Illuminati's death rows
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  it's grab your popcorn time
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  sit back, relax, pray to God
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  and enjoy the show
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  We're here with John Abiskaran
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  he's a Coptic Christian
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  and he was breaking down
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  the prophecies of Mark Taylor
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  who in 2011
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  was documented in 2012
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  in major Christian magazines
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  predicting that Donald J. Trump
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  would become the 45th president of the United States
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  and that it would signal
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  a major global revival
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  and I've talked to so many great pastors
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  that I really respect
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  like Rodney Howard Brown and others
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  and they've talked about this fact and now that you see
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  Trump delivering on the mass
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  arrest of pedophiles worldwide
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  delivering on the return of our republic
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  for Christian rights
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  it is unprecedented
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  you have the Pope who's not a real Catholic
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  but a Jesuit globalist
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  openly calling for the end of Christianity
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  open borders to Islam
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  not defending Christians being slaughtered
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  all over Africa and the Middle East
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  this is biblical times
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  but John, he was here with his children
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  I was here with my children
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  we're here in the Middle Pacific Ocean
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  in the newest land on the earth
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  last touched by God here
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  very charismatic, very passionate
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  so I wanted him from another angle
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  just to get into the current state we are
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  how we're witnessing
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  prophecy right now
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  and what an amazing time this is
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  and I hope he'll repeat the things he said
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  in the last few hours to me
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  but he's got the floor right now
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  to lay this out to you
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  thank you Alex
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  thank you very much
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  great to be here
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  so basically what I was talking with Alex
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  really the heart of the matter
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  of what's really going on here
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  why the whole establishment is against Donald Trump
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  it's not because they don't like him
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  and they don't like his personality
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  they got a beef with him, no no no no
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  because they understand what's really going on
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  with Donald Trump
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  you see, Donald Trump, according to this prophecy
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  that came out back in 2011, look it up
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  Mark Taylor, just look up Trump prophecies
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  it's going to open up a whole world to what's really going on here
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  so basically
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  imagine if I came to you, Alex
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  A in 2024, whatever the next election
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  in a few years Eddie Murphy is going to run
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  and win and be president
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  that's out of left field, you'd be like what are you talking about
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  it's the same thing as if somebody said
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  Donald Trump is going to win
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  and the purpose of it is, and if you look up the prophecy
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  you'll see what it was
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  you see, the New World Order, the Illuminati
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  they've been wanting to make a one-world government
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  the problem is that there's a big boy in the way
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  it's called America and our Constitution
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  which is protecting us
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  so what you saw for the last several years
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  is that they've all been on the same page, the agenda
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  to bring America down to its knees
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  to the level of the rest of the world
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  in order for them to implement a one-world government
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  you can't deal with a big boy in the neighborhood like America
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  it's in the way, the West too
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  the West has to fall, America has to fall
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  for them to make a one-world government
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  now, you know that God's a nationalist
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  and Satan is a globalist
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  and I can prove it to you right now
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  it's the Tower of Babel story
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  that was the first one-world government in the ancient world
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  and they wanted to build a tower
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  to smash the throne of God and de-thrown God
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  idiots, whatever, Nimrods, fine
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  but the point is, this world first one-world government
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  what did God do to stop it?
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  He smote them with the different languages
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  instantly creating the different nations of the world
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  he wants to separate it into different nations
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  he's basically saying look
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  we're going to have a one-world government
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  in heaven, in my kingdom
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  but while you're on earth and Satan's running around
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  I want you to separate it into nations
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  because when you get together with a one-world government
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  you become arrogant and do stupid stuff
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  what happened in the ancient world
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  with the Tower of Babel under Nimrod
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  and that's what's happening what they're trying to do now
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  the New World Order, the Illuminati, whatever you want to call it
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  they are Luciferians
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  straight up and they want to make a one-world government
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  in order for the Antichrist to take his seat
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  see, they know the Bible better than you and me
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  and they're trying to make things happen
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  in order for the Antichrist to take his seat
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  however God
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  has made his move
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  and what that is, is he brought in this guy
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  out of left field, the last person we would have ever expected
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  to be president
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  Donald Trump and he prepared Donald Trump
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  his entire life for this job
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  the job of dismantling the Illuminati
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  think about it, look at all that's been happening
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  no man could go through what this man went through
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  and is going through now with the entire world
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  the entire establishment against him like this
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  and with all the money and power
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  and elitism trying to stop him
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  this man should have been dead a long time ago
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  and he certainly shouldn't be president
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  the fact that he's president alone, we witnessed a miracle
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  that's all
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  it had to be a miracle for him to win
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  I mean they were cheating in the elections
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  everything was against him
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  the entire media and everything and somehow he still wins
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  that alone is a hint that it was an act of God
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  Hillary's on camera
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  they couldn't believe it
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  nobody could believe it
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  as you're speaking right now
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  a rainbow has disappeared
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  suddenly an act of God and in the last few seconds
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  that's pretty cool
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  because God's around, he's doing everything
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  and he's in the trenches right now
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  what's really going on is a lot of fun
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  because you get to watch God
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  dismantle the Illuminati
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  before your eyes
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  and he's using Donald Trump like a blunt force object
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  Donald Trump is basically
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  an agent for God
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  it's not that it's Donald Trump doing everything
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  it's God doing everything using Donald Trump
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  even Newt Gingrich, I don't know if you guys saw this interview
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  during the election they asked Newt Gingrich
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  how come both sides are against Donald Trump
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  including the Republicans
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  I mean aren't the Republicans risking Hillary winning
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  and in a moment
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  where God seemed to have zapped
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  Newt Gingrich
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  tell the truth, he did
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  look at his words, he said well that's because
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  Donald Trump was never initiated
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  he was never part of the club
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  he was never part of the secret society
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  he was never part of the Illuminati
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  but then Newt Gingrich said
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  however, he knows everything that
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  goes on in the club
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  and that's why everybody that's in the club is afraid
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  you see the reason why they're against him
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  is because they hate him
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  they don't like his personality
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  the fact that they call him orange or whatever
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  all this stuff, that's nothing
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  that's why
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  this is a spiritual thing
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  even the demons that these people are possessed with
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  they can't stand it
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  they understand exactly what's going on
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  that Donald Trump was sent and anointed by God
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  to dismantle the Illuminati
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  now you might ask yourself why
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  because a lot of people think that America is under judgment
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  and that it deserves judgment
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  all you see
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  we have an example in the Bible of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  which received judgment and was destroyed
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  but there's another city in our nation
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  in the Bible that we should concern ourselves
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  or think about
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  Nineveh, remember the story of Jonah in the whale
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  and Jonah went and told the people of Nineveh
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  and they actually repented
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  America is Nineveh
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  not Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  and America is anointed by God
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  think about it, it was created in the last
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  in the recent times of our timeline
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  and it was built up in the neighborhood
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  I mean it's only 200 years old
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  it's like God preserved it for the end
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  and it's used and it's the only country in the history
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  of existence created
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  in the name of the Judeo-Christian Bible
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  the forefathers
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  our forefathers of this great country
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  they mentioned in their memoirs
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  look it up, when they were writing the constitution
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  they had an open Bible there and they got every idea
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  for the constitution straight out of the Bible
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  inalienable rights, what's that?
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  it was a radical idea at the time
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  that was given to you directly from God
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  and only God could take away those rights
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  before that your rights was given to you by
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  the government or the king
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  but no, not in America
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  in America your rights are given to you by God
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  whether you believe in God or not
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  that's the case
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  however
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  the enemy's been attacking
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  you see, there's people in this world
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  that are jealous of America, that hate America
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  that don't want America to be America
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  but they could never come at his head strong
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  in this economy in the world
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  they could never come at his in conventional terms
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  and attack his head on in a battle or in a war
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  no, no, no, no, no
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  no, no, no
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:59.240]  No, no,
[1:29:59.240 --> 1:30:08.920]  no, no, no,
[1:30:08.920 --> 1:30:14.200]  It is you, the Info Warriors, across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[1:30:14.200 --> 1:30:18.080]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:22.960]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:23.960]  You are the Info War.
[1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:29.040]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[1:30:29.040 --> 1:30:34.120]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[1:30:34.120 --> 1:30:39.960]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[1:30:39.960 --> 1:30:45.520]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[1:30:45.520 --> 1:30:48.760]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[1:30:48.760 --> 1:30:55.000]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:58.160]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:02.520]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[1:31:02.520 --> 1:31:07.280]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[1:31:07.280 --> 1:31:08.800]  to detoxify the body.
[1:31:08.800 --> 1:31:13.680]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[1:31:13.680 --> 1:31:15.200]  It's made in the USA.
[1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:20.120]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[1:31:20.120 --> 1:31:21.960]  the body and it supports the Info War.
[1:31:21.960 --> 1:31:24.200]  It is a classical 360 win.
[1:31:24.200 --> 1:31:27.760]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[1:31:27.760 --> 1:31:32.640]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:33.640]  you can possibly get.
[1:31:33.640 --> 1:31:37.560]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[1:31:37.560 --> 1:31:42.600]  country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[1:31:42.600 --> 1:31:47.840]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[1:31:47.840 --> 1:31:50.520]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[1:31:50.520 --> 1:31:53.840]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[1:31:53.840 --> 1:32:00.840]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and InfoWarsLife.com.
