[00:00.000 --> 00:08.220]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:08.220 --> 00:12.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:12.660 --> 00:20.900]  It is Sunday, the 23rd day of September 2012.
[00:20.900 --> 00:24.820]  We're going to be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central,
[00:24.820 --> 00:27.020]  5 to 7 Eastern.
[00:27.020 --> 00:31.200]  We have a very important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:31.200 --> 00:37.620]  Coming up after the break, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura will join us.
[00:37.620 --> 00:43.360]  He recently made headlines on CNN saying every war starts with a false flag.
[00:43.360 --> 00:46.120]  That is coming up.
[00:46.120 --> 00:49.760]  Then Lenin LaRouge, love him or hate him, he's always informative.
[00:49.760 --> 00:53.720]  He says World War III is a distinct possibility, a lot of top brasses that as well, he'll be
[00:53.720 --> 00:54.720]  joining us.
[00:54.720 --> 00:59.140]  Lenin Dinesh D'Souza, the guy that's got one of the top documentaries in history out
[00:59.140 --> 01:04.820]  right now, 2016 Obama's America, he is going to be joining us as well.
[01:04.820 --> 01:09.480]  Even if you've heard Jesse Ventura or you've heard Dinesh D'Souza or you've heard good
[01:09.480 --> 01:13.360]  old Alex Jones, spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:13.360 --> 01:18.520]  Look, I know a lot of my regular listeners know as much as I do or even more.
[01:18.520 --> 01:20.000]  You guys correct me all the time.
[01:20.000 --> 01:21.500]  You give me a lot of key intel.
[01:21.500 --> 01:22.500]  I get calls.
[01:22.500 --> 01:23.500]  Why would you cover this?
[01:23.500 --> 01:24.500]  Well, I didn't know.
[01:24.500 --> 01:28.760]  So, you know, I'm all working no place.
[01:28.760 --> 01:30.440]  That makes Jack a pretty irritable boy.
[01:30.440 --> 01:33.400]  I don't really think it makes me dull, but I'm trying my best here.
[01:33.400 --> 01:38.720]  So again, thank you all for joining us on this Sunday transmission.
[01:38.720 --> 01:44.160]  Last week we saw a federal judge reinstate under an emergency request of the U.S. military.
[01:44.160 --> 01:45.880]  That means Obama.
[01:45.880 --> 01:49.360]  He runs them to reinstate the secret arrest of U.S. citizens.
[01:49.360 --> 01:52.340]  I thought I'd cover this right now.
[01:52.340 --> 01:56.960]  Federal judge reinstates unconstitutional NDAA.
[01:56.960 --> 02:02.520]  Earlier this week, a federal judge in New York, Raymond Lawyer, ran of the Obama administration.
[02:02.520 --> 02:04.040]  That means globalist operatives.
[02:04.040 --> 02:10.720]  An emergency stay of the temporarily blocks a ruling by U.S. district judge Kathleen Forrest
[02:10.720 --> 02:13.960]  last week blocking the NDAA.
[02:13.960 --> 02:16.920]  Lawyer offered no explanation or rationale for the temporary stay.
[02:16.920 --> 02:20.760]  However, the Justice Department has asked that appeals court to block the injunction
[02:20.760 --> 02:22.720]  political reported last night.
[02:22.720 --> 02:28.040]  The Obama administration characterized the ruling by Forrest as unconstitutional.
[02:28.040 --> 02:29.040]  Isn't that nice?
[02:29.040 --> 02:32.120]  It's unconstitutional to say you can't secretly be arrested.
[02:32.120 --> 02:36.400]  Justice Department said the ruling was unprecedented and argued that the executive has the right
[02:36.400 --> 02:40.680]  under the Constitution to deny anyone indefinitely to detain anyone.
[02:40.680 --> 02:41.680]  Let me say this again.
[02:41.680 --> 02:44.800]  The Justice Department said that the ruling was unprecedented.
[02:44.800 --> 02:51.480]  We're Hitler, woohoo, and argued that the executive has the right under the Constitution
[02:51.480 --> 02:58.520]  to detain anyone indefinitely without due process, permanently, taken away forever.
[02:58.520 --> 03:00.960]  Off with their heads.
[03:00.960 --> 03:04.200]  That's what America is about.
[03:04.200 --> 03:07.520]  The Fifth Amendment specifically mentions due process of law.
[03:07.520 --> 03:09.240]  Yeah, habeas corpus.
[03:09.240 --> 03:13.960]  The NDAA also violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment saying that
[03:13.960 --> 03:17.220]  all people be treated the same under law.
[03:17.220 --> 03:21.280]  The federal government argues the National Defense Authorization Act did not expand its
[03:21.280 --> 03:27.600]  authority beyond what already existed under the 2001 authorization for military force
[03:27.600 --> 03:31.560]  as interpreted by judges in Guantanamo Bay, habeas corpus cases.
[03:31.560 --> 03:36.800]  Oh, the judge is the military appoints at a torture camp.
[03:36.800 --> 03:41.440]  This pernicious law poses one of the greatest threats to civil liberties in our nation's
[03:41.440 --> 03:44.960]  history, writes Brian T. Troutman.
[03:44.960 --> 03:52.200]  Under the AUMF, this law can be used by authorities to detain forever anyone the government considers
[03:52.200 --> 03:56.960]  a threat to national security and stability, potentially even demonstrators and protesters
[03:56.960 --> 03:58.960]  exercising their First Amendment rights.
[03:58.960 --> 04:03.720]  And as we go to break, I'll say this, what was in the news two weeks ago at the Democratic
[04:03.720 --> 04:06.640]  National Convention?
[04:06.640 --> 04:14.160]  Civil demonstrators were arrested driving cars to get out of them and go protest and
[04:14.160 --> 04:21.480]  held and the feds said to the judges, please hold them indefinitely because protesting
[04:21.480 --> 04:24.560]  is quote, low level terrorism.
[04:24.560 --> 04:29.560]  And they presented the judge, not in the Department of Justice, but a Department of Defense operating
[04:29.560 --> 04:31.480]  domestically.
[04:31.480 --> 04:35.520]  Anybody knows third world countries and dictatorships of the military operating domestically that
[04:35.520 --> 04:38.880]  the military wanted these citizens held.
[04:38.880 --> 04:41.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, the NSA is already spying on you.
[04:41.920 --> 04:43.520]  We already live in glass houses.
[04:43.520 --> 04:47.520]  They're already putting cancer viruses in our vaccines and fluoride in our water.
[04:47.520 --> 04:50.040]  And now they say they want to disappear us.
[04:50.040 --> 04:55.720]  All I say is thank God for the Second Amendment to defend ourselves defensively if these tyrants
[04:55.720 --> 05:00.200]  try to round us all up.
[05:00.200 --> 05:04.120]  Sick of the globalist, eugenicist control freaks, adding poison to your water and laughing
[05:04.120 --> 05:05.800]  as you get sick and die.
[05:05.800 --> 05:08.000]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.600]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none
[05:12.600 --> 05:17.160]  is ProPure and it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[05:17.160 --> 05:20.640]  Its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth.
[05:20.640 --> 05:22.320]  There's no priming required.
[05:22.320 --> 05:28.800]  It's NSF 42 certified optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95% easy to set up
[05:28.800 --> 05:29.800]  and use.
[05:29.800 --> 05:34.280]  They don't require electricity, purify water from lakes, streams, ponds and wells.
[05:34.280 --> 05:37.520]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals which is key.
[05:37.520 --> 05:41.800]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[05:41.800 --> 05:44.480]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[05:44.480 --> 05:46.480]  It's what my family uses.
[05:46.480 --> 05:51.120]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure but if you add the promo code water

[06:20.840 --> 06:25.480]  Well former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest, of course number one New York
[06:25.480 --> 06:27.480]  Times bestseller as well.
[06:27.480 --> 06:32.440]  His new book I think is one of the best I've ever read, Democrats and Reblublekens.
[06:32.440 --> 06:33.640]  No more gangs in government.
[06:33.640 --> 06:35.640]  We're going to be breaking that down first today.
[06:35.640 --> 06:38.000]  Then we're going to talk about the good news.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.960]  That's right, they announced last week we had Tyrell his son on as one of the producers
[06:40.960 --> 06:46.000]  of the show and one of the stars of third season with Sean Stone, Oliver Stone's son.
[06:46.000 --> 06:47.160]  They're finally going to air it.
[06:47.160 --> 06:52.440]  I thought they weren't after, you know, blocking it airing for about eight, nine months.
[06:52.440 --> 06:53.440]  So we'll talk about that.
[06:53.440 --> 06:56.600]  We'll talk about LCI Ada being put in Libya and Syria.
[06:56.600 --> 07:01.320]  Now we've got to invade because they're blowing up our embassies and killing people.
[07:01.320 --> 07:05.760]  And then we'll also get into his take on the New World Order being announced openly.
[07:05.760 --> 07:10.400]  We're going to play some clips of the news saying that and get his take on 2012 and all
[07:10.400 --> 07:11.400]  this hubbub.
[07:11.400 --> 07:17.480]  All right, continuing though, I want to get in with him into this report right here.
[07:17.480 --> 07:21.640]  U.S. sends two warships to Libyan coast.
[07:21.640 --> 07:29.160]  Again, two U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers were sent towards the coast of Libya, following
[07:29.160 --> 07:34.880]  the killing of U.S. Ambassador to Libya and three consulate employees, Fox News reported
[07:34.880 --> 07:42.560]  citing unnamed military officials, Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were
[07:42.560 --> 07:50.680]  killed on Tuesday after the diplomatic facility in Benghazi was attacked by an armed mob angry
[07:50.680 --> 07:57.080]  over a U.S. production film that is said to be insulting to Islam's Prophet Muhammad.
[07:57.080 --> 07:58.400]  Now think about that.
[07:58.400 --> 08:05.760]  And then this film looks like a total and complete shy-op at every single level.
[08:05.760 --> 08:12.120]  Continuing consulate attack NATO Stooges now ludicrously point finger at Qaddafi loyalists
[08:12.120 --> 08:17.160]  lame attempt to shift blame away from U.S.-backed extremists.
[08:17.160 --> 08:21.920]  So now they're trying to claim that these are groups loyal to Qaddafi or that it's Iranians.
[08:21.920 --> 08:25.520]  It's admitted Wahhabist al-Qaeda that's been doing this.
[08:25.520 --> 08:31.400]  I mean, that's even admitted in the British press and the German press and other outfits.
[08:31.400 --> 08:33.560]  This is not debatable.
[08:33.560 --> 08:36.080]  This is not debatable what's going on.
[08:36.080 --> 08:42.240]  But we now have Governor Ventura getting into his new book, Democrybs and Reblublekens.
[08:42.240 --> 08:43.240]  Gov, good to have you with us.
[08:43.240 --> 08:44.240]  Hi, Alex.
[08:44.240 --> 08:45.240]  It was a pleasure.
[08:45.240 --> 08:46.960]  It's just good to have you here now.
[08:46.960 --> 08:48.360]  It's good to hear your voice.
[08:48.360 --> 08:51.680]  Well, I tell you, your book couldn't come out at a better time.
[08:51.680 --> 08:52.680]  Tell us.
[08:52.680 --> 08:55.760]  It's an excellent book, but tell us why you wrote this new bestseller.
[08:55.760 --> 09:00.760]  Well, I wrote it because I want people to understand that we have a completely broken
[09:00.760 --> 09:04.840]  system created by the Democrats and Republicans.
[09:04.840 --> 09:08.320]  It's a system based completely on bribery.
[09:08.320 --> 09:13.480]  If you do bribery in the private sector, of course, you go to jail, but it's alive and
[09:13.480 --> 09:16.560]  well in our political arena because that's how it works.
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.400]  If you don't grease the palm of the congressman or senator, you're not going to get an audience
[09:21.400 --> 09:22.400]  with them.
[09:22.400 --> 09:25.280]  It's just money talks, and you know what else works.
[09:25.280 --> 09:31.320]  Well, you're right about that, and it's becoming more and more evident that Romney and Obama
[09:31.320 --> 09:33.760]  are bought and paid for by the same interest.
[09:33.760 --> 09:39.680]  So where do you see it going once one of these stooges gets back in, and the globalists just
[09:39.680 --> 09:40.680]  continue this takeover?
[09:40.680 --> 09:43.080]  Well, I think it'll just continue on.
[09:43.080 --> 09:44.080]  That's the thing.
[09:44.080 --> 09:48.720]  They always like to tell you if you vote for a third party candidate, you're wasting
[09:48.720 --> 09:49.720]  your vote.
[09:49.720 --> 09:50.720]  You've heard that, Alex.
[09:50.720 --> 09:51.720]  Yes.
[09:51.720 --> 09:56.040]  You've got to reverse that and say that if you vote for a Democrat or Republican, you're
[09:56.040 --> 09:59.920]  wasting your vote because you're going to get the same government.
[09:59.920 --> 10:02.200]  It does not matter with these two.
[10:02.200 --> 10:04.400]  As you stated, they're both bought and paid for.
[10:04.400 --> 10:09.000]  If you go to their two conventions, you'll see the same lobbyists there with trunks
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.760]  full of money, paying them a laugh, and so it makes no difference who wins because we
[10:14.760 --> 10:19.720]  will have the same policies, and I fully expect as soon as the election's over that
[10:19.720 --> 10:22.760]  within a year or so we're going to be out war in Iran.
[10:22.760 --> 10:27.600]  Let's get into that right now because we were talking before we went on air about the fact
[10:27.600 --> 10:33.160]  that they admittedly put Al Qaeda in Libya and Syria, the NATO's funding them, and then
[10:33.160 --> 10:36.280]  the Wahhabis shoot up and kill the ambassador.
[10:36.280 --> 10:40.000]  They're attacking our embassies, and now they're dispatching Marines and warships and
[10:40.000 --> 10:46.080]  predator drones to deal with the Saudi Arabian jihadis our government put in there.
[10:46.080 --> 10:49.400]  I mean, this is even crazy for the New World Order.
[10:49.400 --> 10:56.000]  You know, everyone likes to hold Ronald Reagan up on that pillar, and let's go back to Ronald
[10:56.000 --> 10:57.000]  Reagan.
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.640]  You remember when the Marines were attacking Lebanon that time and they killed at the barracks,
[11:01.640 --> 11:03.320]  they killed like 200 of them?
[11:03.320 --> 11:04.320]  Yes.
[11:04.320 --> 11:06.760]  Did Ronald Reagan start a war?
[11:06.760 --> 11:07.760]  Absolutely not.
[11:07.760 --> 11:12.440]  He got the hell out of there, and that's my view on this.
[11:12.440 --> 11:17.520]  If these countries don't want us there, then let's leave, and let's leave with our foreign
[11:17.520 --> 11:18.520]  aid.
[11:18.520 --> 11:23.000]  I can't believe today, and there's where I stand with Ron Paul completely.
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.840]  We need to cut off foreign aid to any foreign country, and we need to do it for not only
[11:28.840 --> 11:31.400]  those reasons, but the economic reasons.
[11:31.400 --> 11:33.880]  Alex, our country's broke.
[11:33.880 --> 11:36.360]  Now let's put that in layman's terms.
[11:36.360 --> 11:41.560]  It would be like if you were losing your house because you couldn't make mortgage payments,
[11:41.560 --> 11:46.800]  and you're going to lose your car because you can't make car payments, and yet your
[11:46.800 --> 11:52.120]  cousin Joe from California calls you and wants to need 500 bucks and you send it to
[11:52.120 --> 11:53.120]  him.
[11:53.120 --> 11:54.120]  I mean, our country's broke.
[11:54.120 --> 11:57.400]  How can we possibly give out foreign aid?
[11:57.400 --> 12:01.720]  But as you covered in your TV show with the Wall Street Insiders, they're just loaning
[12:01.720 --> 12:05.600]  us fiat made up digits, so why not get us in more debt?
[12:05.600 --> 12:08.840]  The big megabanks, they stand again by countries being in debt.
[12:08.840 --> 12:14.720]  Oh yeah, but I mean, as far as on a political front, if I became president, there would
[12:14.720 --> 12:16.920]  be no foreign aid.
[12:16.920 --> 12:24.080]  I would close every international base and bring all our troops home, and I would have
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.960]  courage enough to carve into that defense budget because it is so belated.
[12:29.960 --> 12:34.880]  You notice that when they talk about cutting government and cutting government spending,
[12:34.880 --> 12:38.200]  it's never the defense budget, is it?
[12:38.200 --> 12:39.960]  And how many countries do we have troops in?
[12:39.960 --> 12:40.960]  It's like 165.
[12:40.960 --> 12:41.960]  Yeah, it's absurd.
[12:41.960 --> 12:46.360]  We're an empire and every empire fails.
[12:46.360 --> 12:50.440]  I mean, you'd think somebody would read the history of the Roman Empire and realize, wait
[12:50.440 --> 12:54.840]  a minute, we're going right down that path ourselves and there's no difference to it.
[12:54.840 --> 12:56.760]  Why is it going to be any different now?
[12:56.760 --> 13:02.200]  If these countries don't want us there, these Muslim countries, then let's get the hell
[13:02.200 --> 13:03.200]  out of there.
[13:03.200 --> 13:05.200]  Let's see, that's just it.
[13:05.200 --> 13:09.120]  We're there because our corporations want to be there.
[13:09.120 --> 13:12.880]  And the corporations run the United States of America now.
[13:12.880 --> 13:18.400]  It ain't the politicians that call the shots, it's corporate board heads that do it.
[13:18.400 --> 13:24.520]  And it's total corporate welfare that multinational corporations give paltry sums of money to
[13:24.520 --> 13:28.920]  politicians and then they commit our money, our treasure, our blood, our young men and
[13:28.920 --> 13:34.600]  women to go into these countries and then antagonize all these people.
[13:34.600 --> 13:37.640]  It's just amazing and we're paying for all of it.
[13:37.640 --> 13:45.720]  You know, it's in my book, Alex, did you know that most of the big multinational corporations
[13:45.720 --> 13:49.640]  spend more money on lobbyists than they pay in taxes?
[13:49.640 --> 13:50.640]  Yes.
[13:50.640 --> 13:52.800]  Isn't that our outrage?
[13:52.800 --> 13:59.440]  They spend more money on lobbying and getting our elected officials into their back pocket
[13:59.440 --> 14:04.600]  than what they do paying taxes to our government to run it.
[14:04.600 --> 14:08.960]  We pay the taxes and they make the decisions.
[14:08.960 --> 14:09.960]  What do you see happening?
[14:09.960 --> 14:15.680]  I mean, I understand it's rearranging deck chairs in the Titanic, but it looks to me
[14:15.680 --> 14:19.920]  like Romney is probably going to end up getting in there.
[14:19.920 --> 14:20.920]  What's your take on that statement?
[14:20.920 --> 14:22.320]  Well, I don't think so.
[14:22.320 --> 14:24.880]  Not after the blunder he made today.
[14:24.880 --> 14:29.520]  The latest polls now have Obama had 50 to 43.
[14:29.520 --> 14:30.680]  I did see that.
[14:30.680 --> 14:37.000]  Because Romney turned it political and attacked Obama when this tragedy happened to over in
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.040]  Libya and all that stuff, where they sort of worked to bring the country together and
[14:43.040 --> 14:48.440]  instead Romney went ahead and drove the axe through the divide and he blamed it all on
[14:48.440 --> 14:53.360]  Obama and all of that and the public reacted very negative.
[14:53.360 --> 14:57.880]  Even a lot of the big leagues in his own Republican party said he blew it.
[14:57.880 --> 15:02.000]  And the latest polls now show Obama with a strong seven point lead.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  Sure.
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.000]  Well, that's John McCain.
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.120]  John McCain went with this ambassador to actually stir it all up over there and fund
[15:10.120 --> 15:11.560]  Al Qaeda going in.
[15:11.560 --> 15:13.880]  So he has a stake in this not coming out.
[15:13.880 --> 15:20.920]  I'm not defending Romney, but the issue here is it was Mr. Peace Prize that has helped
[15:20.920 --> 15:24.240]  start all these wars using jihadis.
[15:24.240 --> 15:29.240]  And so I can see why the power structure doesn't like the fact that Romney brought that up.
[15:29.240 --> 15:30.240]  But I agree with you.
[15:30.240 --> 15:34.560]  Romney was pulling ahead until this new event, but election is still like 50 something days
[15:34.560 --> 15:35.560]  away.
[15:35.560 --> 15:36.560]  Yeah, it is.
[15:36.560 --> 15:42.440]  And you know, but I'll tell you that I can't believe the short memory people have.
[15:42.440 --> 15:46.320]  I mean, everything's about the economy and jobs, right?
[15:46.320 --> 15:49.520]  That's the big thing that they think the election's over.
[15:49.520 --> 15:50.520]  Yes.
[15:50.520 --> 15:51.520]  Well, who ruined the economy?
[15:51.520 --> 15:53.760]  It was the Republicans.
[15:53.760 --> 15:56.440]  Don't touch that dial or that mouse.
[15:56.440 --> 16:00.360]  We'll be right back after these important messages.
[16:00.360 --> 16:05.600]  Have you ever thought about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly self-reliant?

[16:17.040 --> 16:21.120]  gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, home security and more.

[17:00.240 --> 17:04.640]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest
[17:04.640 --> 17:05.840]  half year on record.
[17:05.840 --> 17:11.280]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions, not only corn but soy, alfalfa,
[17:11.280 --> 17:14.720]  fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[17:14.720 --> 17:18.720]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[17:18.720 --> 17:19.720]  food prices.
[17:19.720 --> 17:24.400]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting
[17:24.400 --> 17:27.360]  your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[17:27.360 --> 17:31.240]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[17:31.240 --> 17:32.880]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[17:32.880 --> 17:37.040]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[17:37.040 --> 17:41.600]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods, the fact is you can eat at any time
[17:41.600 --> 17:45.640]  to save money today, and because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices
[17:45.640 --> 17:47.440]  and avoiding the rising food cost.
[17:47.440 --> 17:53.240]  Don't wait, call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.

[18:00.040 --> 18:03.760]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative, but
[18:03.760 --> 18:05.720]  not all silver is equal.
[18:05.720 --> 18:09.320]  SilverSoul is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred
[18:09.320 --> 18:12.160]  times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[18:12.160 --> 18:16.000]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.520]  SilverSoul resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria
[18:20.520 --> 18:23.760]  and viruses, enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[18:23.760 --> 18:28.200]  SilverSoul is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial
[18:28.200 --> 18:30.840]  bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[18:30.840 --> 18:35.120]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is highly effective against viruses, bacteria's
[18:35.120 --> 18:36.560]  molds and yeasts.
[18:36.560 --> 18:40.840]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation, arm
[18:40.840 --> 18:43.000]  yourself with supernatural silver.
[18:43.000 --> 18:47.600]  SilverSoul liquid and gel are perfect for on-the-go emergency preparedness and can provide protection
[18:47.600 --> 18:49.000]  at home, school, or work.

[20:25.400 --> 20:34.120]  If you want total security, go to prison.
[20:34.120 --> 20:36.680]  There you're fed clothes, given medical care, and so on.
[20:36.680 --> 20:41.200]  The only thing lacking is freedom, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and he said that at Columbia
[20:41.200 --> 20:42.200]  University in a speech.
[20:42.200 --> 20:43.200]  You need to look that up.
[20:43.200 --> 20:47.320]  So that backs up with Governor Ventura saying right there in its common sense, his new book,
[20:47.320 --> 20:51.760]  Democrats and Republicans, is available no more Gangs of Government excellent book at
[20:51.760 --> 21:02.360]  mfowarstore.com, American conspiracies and 63 documents, the government doesn't want
[21:02.360 --> 21:06.680]  you to read, which is probably my favorite because it's all little factoids and photos
[21:06.680 --> 21:07.680]  and documents.
[21:07.680 --> 21:13.040]  All those at mfowarstore.com or mfowarshop.com will also get you there, but his books are
[21:13.040 --> 21:18.760]  in bookstores everywhere as well, and sure, you may know all this stuff for a lot of it.
[21:18.760 --> 21:21.600]  Get the book, read it, and give it to a friend.
[21:21.600 --> 21:24.400]  That's how we're going to wake people up, and there certainly is an awakening.
[21:24.400 --> 21:27.280]  I think that's what the police state buildup is in response to.
[21:27.280 --> 21:28.680]  So Governor, let's talk about the show.
[21:28.680 --> 21:31.120]  I mean, it got held up for seven, eight months.
[21:31.120 --> 21:33.080]  Give us your take on why that happened.
[21:33.080 --> 21:37.520]  Now it's back on Wednesdays, which we think, obviously, I think you agree is a better night.
[21:37.520 --> 21:41.840]  And then give us a sneak peek on some of the other episodes that are going to be in there.
[21:41.840 --> 21:46.040]  Well, you know, I can't tell you why it got held up, Alex.
[21:46.040 --> 21:52.320]  We finished them on time in November of last year, like we always do, and all they said
[21:52.320 --> 21:57.880]  was what was editing, and they dragged their feet, dragged their feet, and they finally
[21:57.880 --> 21:58.880]  got around.
[21:58.880 --> 22:04.120]  And two weeks ago, I went and did my voiceover work on four of them, and I still have to get
[22:04.120 --> 22:10.400]  back and do voiceover on the final three, but, you know, I'll do them probably as the
[22:10.400 --> 22:15.440]  show starts breaking on television or whatever right before, in October or whatever, so they'll
[22:15.440 --> 22:16.440]  be done on time.
[22:16.440 --> 22:19.640]  But I can't tell you why they waited that long.
[22:19.640 --> 22:22.640]  Maybe it's because they wanted to release it during the election cycle.
[22:22.640 --> 22:23.640]  I don't know.
[22:23.640 --> 22:25.600]  You know, maybe that was what they had in mind.
[22:25.600 --> 22:30.440]  They never told me, right, we weren't normally on in the winter like we always are, but I
[22:30.440 --> 22:32.480]  don't mind being on in the furrow right now.
[22:32.480 --> 22:36.240]  I think it's a great time slot that they moved us back to Wednesday.
[22:36.240 --> 22:39.760]  It was a huge mistake when they moved us from Wednesday to Friday.
[22:39.760 --> 22:44.440]  Friday is the worst night you could ever have on the second year, but now we're back
[22:44.440 --> 22:52.080]  to Wednesday at 10 Eastern, 9 Central, and we're doing some pretty wild shows.
[22:52.080 --> 22:56.120]  We do one that's very interesting, does the United States have a death rate?
[22:56.120 --> 22:59.760]  And of course, that gets sent to Tesla.
[22:59.760 --> 23:06.160]  We also do one on, are they trying to create a humanity, meaning a half monkey, half man
[23:06.160 --> 23:07.160]  person?
[23:07.160 --> 23:13.960]  So there's some wild stuff that we look into this year, and I have a new team on board.
[23:13.960 --> 23:20.480]  We brought on Sean Stone, who is the son of Oliver Stone, the great film producer.
[23:20.480 --> 23:26.240]  And Sean's a graduate of Princeton University, a very, very bright kid, and he fits perfect
[23:26.240 --> 23:32.120]  into our show because it's right down his alley because he's a huge studier of the Illuminati
[23:32.120 --> 23:33.120]  and all that stuff.
[23:33.120 --> 23:34.640]  He knows it inside and out.
[23:34.640 --> 23:38.880]  Now, he has amazing understanding, getting a chance to hang out with him quite a bit.
[23:38.880 --> 23:39.880]  They're on the shoots.
[23:39.880 --> 23:42.640]  And of course, Tyrell's knocking it out of the park as well.
[23:42.640 --> 23:47.000]  I just can't wait to see the episodes because, I mean, I was there in part of some of the
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.520]  investigations, but I haven't seen any of it.
[23:49.520 --> 23:50.520]  Have you seen any of it?
[23:50.520 --> 23:53.520]  Yeah, I've seen four shows, the ones I've voiced over.
[23:53.520 --> 23:57.920]  Yeah, I've seen them completely right now, what there'll be except minus my voiceover
[23:57.920 --> 24:02.080]  and a few small little edits that they'll have to do to tighten it up a little bit.
[24:02.080 --> 24:05.600]  But I've seen four of the shows and three of them I have not seen yet.
[24:05.600 --> 24:08.880]  What would you say about this season compared to the other seasons?
[24:08.880 --> 24:15.040]  I'd say this season it's even more bizarre and I think this season is going to be even
[24:15.040 --> 24:20.880]  more entertaining for people to watch because we also get into your buddy, Ike.
[24:20.880 --> 24:23.000]  Ike, so whatever his name is.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.400]  Yeah, I wish you guys wouldn't have got into it.
[24:26.400 --> 24:27.400]  Tell us what happened.
[24:27.400 --> 24:33.920]  Well, you know, I wouldn't have did it except it was on Time Magazine's top 10 conspiracies.
[24:33.920 --> 24:35.720]  I mean, people believe this.
[24:35.720 --> 24:41.560]  You know, we're also there to show the conspiracy, but we're also there to show if the conspiracy
[24:41.560 --> 24:43.600]  we believe is a fraud.
[24:43.600 --> 24:44.600]  You know, we play both sides.
[24:44.600 --> 24:48.480]  So you don't believe the queen is a five and a half foot reptoid?
[24:48.480 --> 24:50.280]  Do I believe it?
[24:50.280 --> 24:51.280]  Yeah.
[24:51.280 --> 24:56.520]  No, but I'll tell you, it's very intriguing and entertaining, Alex, because, you know,
[24:56.520 --> 25:04.080]  when you go back to ancient times, why do royal carvings and pictures on caves and stuff
[25:04.080 --> 25:06.600]  are so reptiles who rock upright?
[25:06.600 --> 25:08.840]  No, I know, it's kind of like the movie.
[25:08.840 --> 25:12.000]  It's very intriguing if you look at the birth of Christianity.
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.000]  Okay.
[25:13.000 --> 25:20.080]  How did Christianity start allegedly, according to the Bible, a man, a woman and a talking
[25:20.080 --> 25:21.080]  snake?
[25:21.080 --> 25:23.080]  Well, a snake's a reptile, isn't it?
[25:23.080 --> 25:28.400]  And then when you get into the fact that all of our brains have a certain person that's
[25:28.400 --> 25:35.320]  reptilian, which means to tell me I believe in evolution, that means that we are the same
[25:35.320 --> 25:37.320]  if you go back far enough.
[25:37.320 --> 25:40.920]  Well, who's to say that they died or not?
[25:40.920 --> 25:43.920]  Jesse, maybe you are a reptoid, shape-shifter.
[25:43.920 --> 25:45.920]  Well, I don't know.
[25:45.920 --> 25:49.400]  I could always swim pretty good and reptiles usually can swim.
[25:49.400 --> 25:52.560]  Hey, I was inviting you down here to Barton Springs.
[25:52.560 --> 25:53.560]  You'd love it.
[25:53.560 --> 25:54.560]  Tell us about the surfing.
[25:54.560 --> 26:00.520]  Well, surfing is fine, my wife's now doing a lot of panels for a thing, she's doing it
[26:00.520 --> 26:01.520]  more than I am.
[26:01.520 --> 26:07.760]  Wait till you hear this one, though, Alex, this beats Earl in the United States of America.
[26:07.760 --> 26:15.360]  In Minnesota, right, you have to license a surfboard.
[26:15.360 --> 26:16.360]  Can you believe that?
[26:16.360 --> 26:19.880]  And they require you to wear a life jacket.
[26:19.880 --> 26:25.960]  Now, if Laird Hamilton, the greatest big wave surfer in the world, who rides 40-foot waves
[26:25.960 --> 26:34.960]  and he also paddles for us, if he came to Minnesota to do a lesson thing or whatever,
[26:34.960 --> 26:39.640]  he would be required to license his surfboard and wear a life jacket.
[26:39.640 --> 26:45.640]  That's something I want to get your take on, because this nanny state is their real takeover
[26:45.640 --> 26:46.640]  system.
[26:46.640 --> 26:51.080]  Now, were they're not letting children run at school recess, they've gotten rid of dodgeball,
[26:51.080 --> 26:57.200]  touch football, and now in a suburb of Houston in the country, a woman in a rural area on
[26:57.200 --> 27:03.280]  a cul-de-sac, her kids were riding on bicycles and scooters, the police arrested her and
[27:03.280 --> 27:05.920]  said kids cannot be in a cul-de-sac.
[27:05.920 --> 27:08.280]  I mean, this nanny state is pure tyranny.
[27:08.280 --> 27:09.280]  It's awful.
[27:09.280 --> 27:14.080]  You know, but, you know, there's a reason I was governor, Alex, you know, I.
[27:14.080 --> 27:15.080]  Why?
[27:15.080 --> 27:18.080]  Because I figured out of the way around it, Minnesota.
[27:18.080 --> 27:23.240]  I brought, when I was there to practice, I brought surfboards and I did not license
[27:23.240 --> 27:24.240]  my surfboard.
[27:24.240 --> 27:25.880]  You know how I got around it?
[27:25.880 --> 27:29.480]  Well, when you license it, you have to give them an address.
[27:29.480 --> 27:35.480]  Well, I gave them my address in Mexico, so I didn't have to license my boards and the
[27:35.480 --> 27:36.720]  guy said, yep, that'll work.
[27:36.720 --> 27:41.520]  He said, as long as the address you give me on the sales thing is outside of the state
[27:41.520 --> 27:45.320]  of Minnesota, you do not have to pay for a license.
[27:45.320 --> 27:48.720]  And people should always look for those loopholes because the establishment always puts those
[27:48.720 --> 27:49.800]  in there for themselves.
[27:49.800 --> 27:56.040]  I was buying a small one-man tiny kayak for one of my children at Academy a few months
[27:56.040 --> 28:01.280]  ago and they got in my face, not rudely, but you know, hey, the state police want this,
[28:01.280 --> 28:02.280]  you need to register this.
[28:02.280 --> 28:03.280]  And I said, is it the law?
[28:03.280 --> 28:06.080]  And they said, no, but the police want it.
[28:06.080 --> 28:08.760]  And I said, what, am I going to use it to blow up the dam?
[28:08.760 --> 28:10.440]  And I said, fine, I'm not buying it.
[28:10.440 --> 28:12.040]  And they said, fine, you're not getting it.
[28:12.040 --> 28:15.560]  I started walking out and the manager goes, no, no, no, you can have it.
[28:15.560 --> 28:19.440]  And Governor, we're talking about a $200 little cheap plastic kayak.
[28:19.440 --> 28:24.200]  I mean, what type of country is this where they want me to register my kayak?
[28:24.200 --> 28:27.880]  The same country that I have to register a surfboard.
[28:27.880 --> 28:32.720]  And get this, Alex, there's no serial numbers on a surfboard.
[28:32.720 --> 28:37.520]  So therefore, how do they know the license of this surfboard even belongs to me?
[28:37.520 --> 28:39.720]  What about saying you got to wear a life preserver?
[28:39.720 --> 28:42.960]  Well, I'll put it to you this way.
[28:42.960 --> 28:47.640]  If you throw it up on the beaches of Hawaii, the beaches of California, the beaches of
[28:47.640 --> 29:02.600]  Mexico, the surf beaches, if you're wearing a life jacket, they probably string you up.

[31:00.160 --> 31:04.560]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest
[31:04.560 --> 31:05.760]  half year on record.
[31:05.760 --> 31:09.320]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[31:09.320 --> 31:14.640]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[31:14.640 --> 31:18.640]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[31:18.640 --> 31:19.640]  food prices.
[31:19.640 --> 31:24.280]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting
[31:24.280 --> 31:27.280]  your own supply of foods from E-Foods Direct now.
[31:27.280 --> 31:31.160]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, E-Foods will have to raise prices too.
[31:31.160 --> 31:32.800]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[31:32.800 --> 31:36.960]  I recently increased my supply from E-Foods Direct because we've all known this was coming.

[31:44.040 --> 31:47.360]  years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.

[33:01.240 --> 33:04.960]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[33:04.960 --> 33:09.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:09.160 --> 33:16.240]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:16.240 --> 33:17.960]  You want to stop tyranny?
[33:17.960 --> 33:28.160]  Well so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:28.160 --> 33:44.440]  Revolution calling, my friends, revolution calling, but what kind of revolution do we
[33:44.440 --> 33:45.440]  speak?
[33:45.440 --> 33:49.920]  Will it be a socialist, communist or fascist revolution?
[33:49.920 --> 33:53.800]  That's what the globalists hope as they injure the collapse of our society that they'll be
[33:53.800 --> 33:57.800]  able to sell us on radical tyranny as a solution.
[33:57.800 --> 34:01.560]  No I want to restore the republic of our forebears.
[34:01.560 --> 34:05.200]  Of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin.
[34:05.200 --> 34:07.560]  That's what I want to restore.
[34:07.560 --> 34:12.480]  Thank you for joining us on this worldwide Sunday transmission, the 23rd of September
[34:12.480 --> 34:13.480]  2012.
[34:13.480 --> 34:19.280]  Here is Jesse Ventura, former governor of Minnesota.
[34:19.280 --> 34:26.880]  Well listen, I was down at the Texas coast just three or four months ago for my parents
[34:26.880 --> 34:27.880]  birthdays.
[34:27.880 --> 34:28.880]  They want to go down there.
[34:28.880 --> 34:34.200]  It was a total nanny state, now they have like these beach rangers coming up and harassing
[34:34.200 --> 34:37.720]  you and saying, look out if you go back in there, there's rattlesnakes and just, I mean
[34:37.720 --> 34:41.080]  I've been going there my whole life and never had any interaction.
[34:41.080 --> 34:45.240]  Now it's total interaction over and over again like it was a comedy or-
[34:45.240 --> 34:49.840]  Alex, why do you think I live half the year in Mexico?
[34:49.840 --> 34:53.320]  Mexico doesn't bother you with nonsense like that.
[34:53.320 --> 34:59.320]  If you go out and kill yourself doing something, well the Mexican people, they're very religious.
[34:59.320 --> 35:04.440]  They will probably say a prayer for you and they will feel bad for you, but ultimately
[35:04.440 --> 35:08.040]  they're going to say, what a knucklehead he does, why did he do that?
[35:08.040 --> 35:10.040]  Exactly, but that's what I'm talking about.
[35:10.040 --> 35:14.760]  But to finish the brief story, I actually saw people hinder each other because now all
[35:14.760 --> 35:20.400]  the dogs, including Labradors, in lakes and in the ocean are wearing these big life jackets
[35:20.400 --> 35:24.880]  and I saw a woman come over to people that had some dogs and said, you ought to have
[35:24.880 --> 35:26.560]  your dog in a life jacket.
[35:26.560 --> 35:31.280]  This new nanny state where people come and tell you what to do, not just the cops, what
[35:31.280 --> 35:32.720]  is going on in this country?
[35:32.720 --> 35:36.000]  I can only go back to the latter, Alex.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.440]  Everybody's drinking fluoridated water, which of course we are, no fluoride is the major
[35:40.440 --> 35:42.440]  ingredient to Prozac.
[35:42.440 --> 35:46.960]  And that's the only answer I can give you, they're dumbing themselves down and they're
[35:46.960 --> 35:50.520]  getting us docile because they're drinking Prozac water.
[35:50.520 --> 35:54.040]  By the way, they call you a conspiracy theorist for having that incredible episode, one of
[35:54.040 --> 35:57.040]  my favorite last year on that, Governor Ventura.
[35:57.040 --> 36:02.400]  But the Harvard study came out two months ago and they looked at more than 20 studies
[36:02.400 --> 36:07.800]  and said it's conclusive, fluoride, sodium fluoride in the water, it's actually an acid,
[36:07.800 --> 36:10.640]  they were moving electrons so it's worse, that's why it's so bad.
[36:10.640 --> 36:15.600]  It is toxic, it causes cancer and it lowers IQ massively.
[36:15.600 --> 36:19.120]  So it's not debatable now, so why is it still in our water, Governor?
[36:19.120 --> 36:25.000]  Exactly, why did they put it in the water in the first place when you find out the Nazis
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.720]  were the first ones to put fluoride in the water, so we're following some beautiful Nazi
[36:30.720 --> 36:31.720]  type thinking.
[36:31.720 --> 36:37.080]  Exactly, I want to know why in Austin where I live, because I've seen the film, when doctors
[36:37.080 --> 36:40.200]  go and speak to the council, the mayor laughs at them.
[36:40.200 --> 36:44.280]  I mean, I'm telling you, it is outrageous that they're doing this to us and they think
[36:44.280 --> 36:45.280]  it's funny.
[36:45.280 --> 36:51.800]  I don't know how you got me, and well, Brainerd, Minnesota, Brainerd, Minnesota voted their
[36:51.800 --> 36:57.200]  city council to not fluoridate the water, the federal government came in and made them.
[36:57.200 --> 37:01.440]  Yeah, and since one of the feds doing that in New Jersey, Minnesota and Texas, I've seen
[37:01.440 --> 37:03.800]  now where the feds are ordering it.
[37:03.800 --> 37:09.440]  Oh, absolutely, Brainerd, Minnesota, their mayor and council voted that their public
[37:09.440 --> 37:14.000]  water, that they did not want fluoride in their water, and the federal government came
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.400]  in and told them, oh, no, you're putting fluoride in the water, so you don't even get
[37:19.400 --> 37:20.400]  a choice anymore.
[37:20.400 --> 37:21.400]  It's unbelievable.
[37:21.400 --> 37:25.240]  I mean, it is just such tyranny that we're seeing.
[37:25.240 --> 37:27.920]  Speaking of that, I want to go to a few phone calls, Governor, but-
[37:27.920 --> 37:33.880]  Before you go, Alex, I've got hot news for you, and I'll tell you this for all your listeners.
[37:33.880 --> 37:34.880]  Please.
[37:34.880 --> 37:40.720]  I stated that if a grassroots campaign took place across America, grassroots and didn't
[37:40.720 --> 37:48.160]  request any money, if they got me ballot access in all 50 states, and if the grassroots
[37:48.160 --> 37:54.560]  campaign could guarantee that I would be in the debate, that I will give serious consideration
[37:54.560 --> 37:57.080]  2016 of running for president.
[37:57.080 --> 37:58.080]  Are you breaking that here?
[37:58.080 --> 38:01.560]  Well, I've said it a couple places, but you're pretty well there.
[38:01.560 --> 38:04.600]  They are the same day, so you're hearing it the same day.
[38:04.600 --> 38:05.600]  Wow.
[38:05.600 --> 38:07.920]  Well, thank you for announcing that, because our show-
[38:07.920 --> 38:11.640]  So, it's up to the people of the United States of America.
[38:11.640 --> 38:19.040]  If they run across this great land of ours, get me ballot access in all 50 states, and
[38:19.040 --> 38:22.040]  then raise enough hell to ensure that I get-
[38:22.040 --> 38:23.840]  Look at it this way, Alex.
[38:23.840 --> 38:28.560]  They always tell us that competition is tremendous in the private sector, right?
[38:28.560 --> 38:29.560]  It's good-gap competition.
[38:29.560 --> 38:33.200]  How come there's no competition in the public sector?
[38:33.200 --> 38:35.000]  Why do we only get two choices?
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.600]  Why, for 20 years, have we not seen a third voice in a presidential election?
[38:39.600 --> 38:41.080]  Okay, Governor, let me stop you.
[38:41.080 --> 38:42.080]  This is a big deal.
[38:42.080 --> 38:47.400]  We've been talking for 40 minutes here, and now you dropped this bombshell on us.
[38:47.400 --> 38:49.560]  So, I want to officially have your statement here.
[38:49.560 --> 38:51.640]  So, let me give you the floor for a few minutes.
[38:51.640 --> 38:56.160]  Please start over and make the announcement, because my show's big enough that it'll probably
[38:56.160 --> 38:58.600]  end up breaking nationally here that you said on this show.
[38:58.600 --> 39:00.800]  So, Governor Ventura, please make your announcement.
[39:00.800 --> 39:06.760]  Well, I said that if a grassroots effort, not a money effort, I don't want millions
[39:06.760 --> 39:12.280]  of dollars raised, and I don't want to do all that, but if there's a grassroots blue-collar
[39:12.280 --> 39:18.800]  effort out there, and people do the legwork to get Jesse Ventura on the 2016 ballot for
[39:18.800 --> 39:25.520]  president, and if they can likewise guarantee me, because I've got to be in the debates,
[39:25.520 --> 39:29.520]  I won't do it if I can't have an opportunity to win.
[39:29.520 --> 39:34.880]  And the only way you can have an opportunity to win is you must be included in the debates.
[39:34.880 --> 39:41.680]  If they can guarantee me the debates and guarantee me ballot access in our 50 states, I will
[39:41.680 --> 39:47.440]  give very strong consideration to running for president in 2016 as a complete independent
[39:47.440 --> 39:48.440]  with no party.
[39:48.440 --> 39:49.440]  Wow.
[39:49.440 --> 39:54.600]  So, you're announcing here today on the radio that you will run for president.
[39:54.600 --> 39:59.040]  That's amazing, because we've all been disheartened by the fact that Ron Paul didn't go third
[39:59.040 --> 40:04.760]  party, that he didn't challenge Mitt Romney more, as we've now learned from one of their
[40:04.760 --> 40:09.000]  campaign people, that they made the decision not to do that in Michigan months and months
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.680]  and months ago, and we need somebody third party to inject real issues.
[40:13.680 --> 40:16.600]  Well, I don't want to even be a third party, Alex.
[40:16.600 --> 40:22.520]  I'm talking about Jesse Ventura as a governor, Ventura as an individual, not even a party,
[40:22.520 --> 40:28.720]  me as an individual, because my book advocates the abolishment of political parties, so
[40:28.720 --> 40:31.680]  I do not want to be aligned with any party.
[40:31.680 --> 40:37.240]  So you are a 100% independent, and you're saying get ballot access in-
[40:37.240 --> 40:42.960]  Get me ballot access in all 50 states, and I think Puerto Rico, don't they vote through?
[40:42.960 --> 40:43.960]  Yes.
[40:43.960 --> 40:46.400]  What's the timeframe on that, though?
[40:46.400 --> 40:51.560]  Get me ballot access in all 50 states to where I'll be on the ballot in all 50 states and
[40:51.560 --> 40:55.200]  guarantee me that I can participate in the debates.
[40:55.200 --> 41:00.600]  I will then give heavy consideration to running when I see that's in place.
[41:00.600 --> 41:05.320]  When did you make this decision that you would throw your hat in the 2012 presidential
[41:05.320 --> 41:06.320]  race?
[41:06.320 --> 41:07.320]  2016.
[41:07.320 --> 41:09.320]  But the 2016 one, not this one.
[41:09.320 --> 41:12.880]  No, no, I understand that, but I mean, when did you make the decision in 2012?
[41:12.880 --> 41:18.240]  Well, I just kept looking at the whole situation and realizing that something needs to be done
[41:18.240 --> 41:24.120]  to defeat and destroy this two-party as rough-native, but at the two-party dictatorship.
[41:24.120 --> 41:31.120]  And again, I'm up for challenges, and I think it would be just a riled affair to actually
[41:31.120 --> 41:35.960]  be a legitimate candidate for president and be part of no political party.
[41:35.960 --> 41:41.440]  Well, we need someone who's got the personality, the background, and the understanding to do
[41:41.440 --> 41:42.960]  it, and there is no one out there.
[41:42.960 --> 41:50.120]  Ron Paul is going to be too old, and there's no one else who even has the integrity.
[41:50.120 --> 41:54.040]  I don't agree with every single one of your political stances, but I know that you're
[41:54.040 --> 41:57.120]  a real guy who cares about freedom and who can't be bought.
[41:57.120 --> 42:00.960]  I mean, I've studied what you did as governor, why the whole system came after you, why the
[42:00.960 --> 42:04.640]  whole media turned against you, and it was because you couldn't be bought by special
[42:04.640 --> 42:07.200]  interest, and that's what we need is somebody with integrity.
[42:07.200 --> 42:08.880]  So that's very, very exciting, though.
[42:08.880 --> 42:09.880]  Governor, so you're saying-
[42:09.880 --> 42:11.720]  You know what's interesting, Alex?
[42:11.720 --> 42:16.600]  When I was governor, I didn't expect any PAC money or anything at all, no special interest
[42:16.600 --> 42:17.600]  money.
[42:17.600 --> 42:22.480]  Did you know for four years in office, I never met once with the lobbyist.
[42:22.480 --> 42:26.840]  I was banned from my office, I told my staff, I said, I don't need to meet with the lobbyist.
[42:26.840 --> 42:34.160]  I said, they didn't elect me, so therefore they get no audience with me.
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.440]  Whether you agree with everything Ventura says or not, you've got to respect the fact
[42:38.440 --> 42:41.200]  that he truly stands for what he believes in and has integrity.
[42:41.200 --> 42:46.440]  We're going to go to break and come back with Lyndon LaRouche, who just had his 90th birthday

[45:52.760 --> 45:54.920]  the scourge that is vaccines.

[47:19.200 --> 47:44.480]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, for the balance of the hour, we're going to be
[47:44.480 --> 47:46.400]  joined by Lyndon LaRouche here in a moment.
[47:46.400 --> 47:51.600]  If you don't know who he is, look into who he really is, not who the media says he is.
[47:51.600 --> 47:57.280]  Very interesting person with an amazing historical perspective and I hear he's got a birthday.
[47:57.280 --> 47:58.680]  Has he already had it or is it tomorrow?
[47:58.680 --> 48:02.360]  We're going to find out from the man himself, I guess I could go to Wikipedia and find out
[48:02.360 --> 48:03.840]  but so much of what they say is wrong.
[48:03.840 --> 48:09.960]  We're going to be having Lyndon LaRouche on here in just a moment from his offices to
[48:09.960 --> 48:12.920]  break down what's happening in the world and here's just an example.
[48:12.920 --> 48:20.280]  U.N., armed intervention may be necessary in Syria, that is a official U.N. press release.
[48:20.280 --> 48:22.160]  Well there already is armed intervention.
[48:22.160 --> 48:27.280]  The West has been sending in Al Qaeda and others and that is now admitted, what we told
[48:27.280 --> 48:30.360]  you eight months ago and the latest thing started, we told you a year and a half ago
[48:30.360 --> 48:33.040]  the Libya thing was started as a pretext.
[48:33.040 --> 48:39.400]  And now Iran is sending elite troops to aid al-Assad's regime in Syria, that's the London
[48:39.400 --> 48:43.520]  telegraph and that's official out of Iran as well.
[48:43.520 --> 48:50.640]  So this is a full-blown proxy war, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:50.640 --> 48:55.160]  Barak hints the U.S. would join Israel in Iran's strike.
[48:55.160 --> 48:59.000]  We share the challenge through our timetables, they're not the same.
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.440]  The defense minister says a pre-Rashashana political event.
[49:03.440 --> 49:08.840]  Defense minister Ehud Barak appeared to hint last night that he believed the United States
[49:08.840 --> 49:13.440]  would join Israel in a strike on Iran to prevent the Islamic Republic from obtaining nuclear
[49:13.440 --> 49:14.440]  weapons.
[49:14.440 --> 49:15.880]  So it's all moving towards that.
[49:15.880 --> 49:20.680]  Israel says differences remain between U.S. and Iran, that's Fox News.
[49:20.680 --> 49:24.360]  Canada closes embassy in Iran, that's a big sign.
[49:24.360 --> 49:28.080]  Intelligence committee chair describes explosive confrontation between Netanyahu and American
[49:28.080 --> 49:31.360]  ambassador, complete with yelling and screaming at each other.
[49:31.360 --> 49:35.320]  Venezuela grabs U.S. ships and it has arms, that's Forbes.
[49:35.320 --> 49:38.360]  The point is things are going into hypergear.
[49:38.360 --> 49:45.840]  Obama's talking about signing a executive order right now to go ahead and have the Pentagon
[49:45.840 --> 49:50.360]  take over the Internet, even CBS News says it's draconian, anti-free speech, I mean when
[49:50.360 --> 49:53.240]  they're saying that, you know you're in trouble.
[49:53.240 --> 49:57.680]  In the backdrop, Europe has been downgraded by Moody's to negative outlook, they're coming
[49:57.680 --> 50:03.080]  out with a super bond that'll just put people more into debt to the oligarch banks.
[50:03.080 --> 50:09.960]  All of this is happening and that's why we've got Lyndon LaRouche joining us because he was
[50:09.960 --> 50:12.920]  called by, you look this up, I remember hearing this a couple of years ago, I looked it up
[50:12.920 --> 50:17.640]  as in the Washington Post, it was true, the CIA director back in the 80s called him the
[50:17.640 --> 50:23.560]  best intelligence, private intelligence operation in the world, national security council, members
[50:23.560 --> 50:28.560]  said similar things, he used to land for weekly meetings himself and by helicopter at the
[50:28.560 --> 50:34.120]  CIA command center, Ronald Reagan read his information and people got jealous, George
[50:34.120 --> 50:39.160]  Herbert Walker had him set up and put in prison.
[50:39.160 --> 50:43.600]  I mean just amazing the type of stuff that they do and it doesn't mean that I agree with
[50:43.600 --> 50:49.560]  all of Lyndon LaRouche's solutions but his historical perspective is dead on and the
[50:49.560 --> 50:52.920]  more I learn in my own research, the more I learn how right he is, which has become
[50:52.920 --> 50:58.920]  a big media event, that Jones is a LaRouchean and what I am is a seeker of truth, that's
[50:58.920 --> 51:04.880]  what I'm seeking out and that's why he's here with us and sir I hear that you are just
[51:04.880 --> 51:09.080]  about 90 years old, if you count nine months and your mother's womb I guess over 90 but
[51:09.080 --> 51:14.800]  I tell you don't look a day above 75, what's your secret to longevity, longevity?
[51:14.800 --> 51:19.240]  I don't know maybe there's some virtue there somewhere or some reward for something I had
[51:19.240 --> 51:25.840]  done or not done, I just enjoy doing what I do and I feel committed to what I'm doing.
[51:25.840 --> 51:26.840]  What is your birthday?
[51:26.840 --> 51:27.840]  Is it today or tomorrow?
[51:27.840 --> 51:28.840]  Tomorrow is tomorrow.
[51:28.840 --> 51:32.560]  Wow so you'll be 90 years old on September 8th?
[51:32.560 --> 51:33.560]  Yep.
[51:33.560 --> 51:35.680]  Well happy birthday.
[51:35.680 --> 51:36.680]  Thank you.
[51:36.680 --> 51:40.000]  No one can say that you've sat around on your hind end for 90 years.
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.360]  No, a lot of other places but not that.
[51:45.360 --> 51:49.840]  Wow, let's get into world events first, I do want to speak a little bit about Lenin
[51:49.840 --> 51:53.160]  LaRouche today and also open the phones up at the bottom of the hour, people that have
[51:53.160 --> 51:59.880]  questions or comments for you but I just read over a snapshot of news today, I see the world
[51:59.880 --> 52:05.680]  lining up like we saw before the first two world wars, am I wrong intellectually historically
[52:05.680 --> 52:10.440]  but also in my gut feeling the serious tremors in the force?
[52:10.440 --> 52:15.160]  I think there are only two major sources of threat.
[52:15.160 --> 52:20.600]  One is the British monarchy and the other is the British monarchy's puppet which is
[52:20.600 --> 52:22.200]  Obama.
[52:22.200 --> 52:28.480]  The situation is that as the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States have shown they
[52:28.480 --> 52:37.520]  understand that any war that breaks out now such as in the Middle East or elsewhere will
[52:37.520 --> 52:45.440]  be a thermonuclear war, there may be other minor things and conflicts which are going
[52:45.440 --> 52:51.160]  on but anytime the force comes in and someone says we're going to start the attack it's
[52:51.160 --> 52:57.400]  going to be a full global attack and it's going to be thermonuclear and the question
[52:57.400 --> 53:04.240]  is will anybody survive eventually not merely out of the war because you forget the Soviet
[53:04.240 --> 53:11.240]  or Russian and Chinese capabilities which are very significant and against the United
[53:11.240 --> 53:17.360]  States and Britain and something from France which is the other side and these forces are
[53:17.360 --> 53:24.000]  going to go against each other on a thermonuclear basis from the get go and that means that
[53:24.000 --> 53:29.960]  our submarines, our major submarines are going to launch in their time, it's going
[53:29.960 --> 53:36.600]  to be a full launch, probably one or two rounds, maybe with an hour and a half it's all over
[53:36.600 --> 53:38.800]  and the world looks pretty dead.
[53:38.800 --> 53:45.440]  So we're at a point where the idea of simple war or war breaking out or incidents leading
[53:45.440 --> 53:48.840]  to war is not going to happen.
[53:48.840 --> 53:56.440]  What's happened is Russia and China have made a very firm commitment not to start a war
[53:56.440 --> 53:59.880]  but also to defend against it.
[53:59.880 --> 54:03.160]  Most people in the United States want no part of this.
[54:03.160 --> 54:10.040]  The only person really behind it is the President Obama and Obama's with the Queen but most
[54:10.040 --> 54:13.920]  of the people in Britain are not for this nonsense either.
[54:13.920 --> 54:18.920]  So we're on the verge of the worst kind of warfare one could imagine which would break
[54:18.920 --> 54:23.880]  out very suddenly with very little warning on any part.
[54:23.880 --> 54:28.240]  And services such as the U.S. services would understand and know that this is going on
[54:28.240 --> 54:29.240]  immediately.
[54:29.240 --> 54:34.680]  Let me stop you there sir because what you're saying is obviously right on target but people
[54:34.680 --> 54:38.920]  may not understand the last two Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the last three heads of
[54:38.920 --> 54:44.360]  SENTCOM as you know, people can look this up, journalists can look this up, have refused
[54:44.360 --> 54:47.840]  to attack Iran saying it would bring in China and Russia.
[54:47.840 --> 54:51.680]  Now they've sent the fleets over to Minnish China and they think that that's going to
[54:51.680 --> 54:57.280]  allow this attack but now even Dempsey who's been known as not as smart as his predecessors
[54:57.280 --> 55:02.040]  has been convinced and came out as you know last week and said, hey, I mean the exact
[55:02.040 --> 55:06.240]  quote it was a headline was, do not blame us when Israel strikes and don't think we're
[55:06.240 --> 55:07.240]  supporting it.
[55:07.240 --> 55:12.440]  So that type, I mean to have Chairman of the Joint Chiefs saying that shows that the military
[55:12.440 --> 55:18.480]  establishment who love wars, I mean that's what they do and they love to be commanded
[55:18.480 --> 55:23.720]  off the war generally are saying do not do this, I mean how significant is that?
[55:23.720 --> 55:28.520]  That signifies a mutiny within the saner sectors of the power structure.
[55:28.520 --> 55:32.200]  I'm not sure the word mutiny is the right term.
[55:32.200 --> 55:37.600]  The point is because nothing that the Joint Chiefs and others are doing to that effect
[55:37.600 --> 55:39.680]  is a violation of anything on their part.
[55:39.680 --> 55:46.440]  Sure, I mean that's the wrong term, it's a sanity call, it's a, what would you call
[55:46.440 --> 55:47.440]  it then?
[55:47.440 --> 55:51.520]  Well, the point is you've got to throw this president out of office, even though he's
[55:51.520 --> 55:56.240]  just been nominated, I don't think it's going to stick and he's not in a winning position
[55:56.240 --> 55:57.240]  right now.
[55:57.240 --> 56:01.120]  But what does it mean inside the government where you have so many connections to have
[56:01.120 --> 56:06.440]  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs come out and say something countervailing what the
[56:06.440 --> 56:09.440]  president and certain sectors of Israel are pushing?
[56:09.440 --> 56:15.040]  Yeah, but the Joint Chiefs are operating within their powers of government and the president
[56:15.040 --> 56:23.280]  doesn't dare challenge that directly because the president is not a popular president.
[56:23.280 --> 56:26.640]  Am I right to say that it's seismic though, I mean how big of a deal is it to have the
[56:26.640 --> 56:29.840]  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs come out and say that and it gets almost no press?
[56:29.840 --> 56:34.040]  Are you talking about, if you're a member of the Joint Chiefs and you're a patriot
[56:34.040 --> 56:39.440]  as I am, you're not going to play games and guessing games or anything with this policy.
[56:39.440 --> 56:47.840]  We know that any major war that breaks out on this planet will be a thermonuclear war.
[56:47.840 --> 56:50.380]  There are no minor wars possible.
[56:50.380 --> 56:55.360]  You cannot have a continuation of the war with the Middle East at all.
[56:55.360 --> 56:59.520]  Any such war will lead to thermonuclear war immediately.
[56:59.520 --> 57:04.240]  And that means that within about an hour and a half most of the world is dead.
[57:04.240 --> 57:07.200]  No sane head of government will launch it.
[57:07.200 --> 57:11.080]  But I think there are some people who are not so sane, including our current president,
[57:11.080 --> 57:17.960]  but don't assume that with all the boula-boula that he's going to win this election.
[57:17.960 --> 57:24.040]  Right now he's running as a loser, not because the other guys are smart, but because he is
[57:24.040 --> 57:29.280]  so bad and he's losing anything resembling friends and supporters at a rapid rate.
[57:29.280 --> 57:33.840]  Again, you have a lot of connections inside the Pentagon, CIA, you name it.
[57:33.840 --> 57:39.960]  I want to get their take on where this is going, other October surprises that this regime
[57:39.960 --> 57:46.520]  could pull, and how we do avert kicking off a wider war in the Middle East.
[57:46.520 --> 58:13.640]  The Big Proxy War is already on.
[58:13.640 --> 58:29.640]  The
[58:29.640 --> 58:34.640]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it stores for 25 years,
[58:34.640 --> 58:37.640]  you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[58:37.640 --> 58:42.640]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[58:42.640 --> 58:47.640]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.

[59:14.640 --> 59:17.640]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.

[59:20.640 --> 59:23.640]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[59:23.640 --> 59:26.640]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.

[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:31.640]  I hope we don't have a nuclear war so I can still go out and hear people like Jimmy Vaughan play.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.640]  Down with Big Brother.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:40.640]  Alright, going back now to Lennon Marouge, who's with us for the balance of the hour.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.640]  Very honored to have him.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.640]  The toll-free number to join is if you've got any questions or comments for him coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.640]  There's a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.640]  800-259-9231, first-time callers for Lennon Marouge.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.640]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:02.640]  Again, with all of your sources, I remember you were on a couple of years ago when you said it was building up to this.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.640]  Now we're here.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:13.640]  The power structure that thinks it can have this war, that's trying to overthrow Russia with proxy groups and political groups, the George Soros types.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:22.640]  What do they think they're doing? Because then I have neocon groups come out and say, I'm bad and anti-American because I don't want to have war and I'm not supporting Obama.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.640]  So it's elements of the conservative groups and the so-called Obama people.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:37.640]  I mean, I'm bad, you're bad because we don't want to have a giant war that even the top military in the news said will probably lead to a war with Russia or China.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.640]  I mean, how are we bad for not wanting World War III?
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:48.640]  The point is, I think that the powers that be are really do not intend to have a thermonuclear war.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:57.640]  They intend to have a limited kind of conflict, hope that they can break up resistance and take over and then kill people.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:04.640]  Now the best way to kill people is being done in the United States by those interests who have shut off the food supply.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:17.640]  Those who are insisting like this president on cutting out food consumption in an area where we are going running short of the food necessary to meet people and he's trying to turn it into gasoline or something of that sort.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:30.640]  It's the attempt to use bluff threats, even terrible threats, exemplary cruelties, these kinds of things, trying to break the will of nation after nation,
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:37.640]  the way we unconstitutionally got into a war in Libya, which was a violation of our constitution.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:44.640]  And it's that wear and tear process, working on people's nerves and trying to drive them, intimidate them and so forth.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.640]  And the problem we have here is you see it in the election campaign.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.640]  Now Obama is not winning the election right now.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.640]  Now I don't know what's going to happen in the future, that's a different matter.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:03:02.640]  The game is the bluff, intimidation that daily, weekly murders this president is doing without any constitutional authorization for it.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.640]  We have the evidence to throw him out of office.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:09.640]  With the problem we have a weakness in the Republican side on this thing as well as the problems on the Democratic side.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:15.640]  Well as you point out, Congressman Jones from North Carolina has introduced the legislation to begin the impeachment.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:22.640]  Obama says that NATO and other groups command our military and that Congress should just sit down and shut up.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.640]  Well I think the truth of the matter is that there are some of us in the United States who are influential.
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:37.640]  As you know, there are limited number of people who are really influential in the sense that they can push things in a direction which is say positive or the other way.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.640]  And it's a limited number of people.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.640]  The rest of them tend to follow pressures put upon them.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:48.640]  And I think we're at the point that the really responsible layers in the United States,
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.640]  apart from the very much frightened and quiet one,
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:56.640]  are the poverty of our people, the suffering of our people that belong beyond anything.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.640]  This is worse than the great depression.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.640]  And our people are suffering this under this president in particular.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:10.640]  I mean the deliberate action by him in cutting down the food supply in order to make more gasoline,
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.640]  in order to starve farmers and others to death, that's the kind of thing you're dealing with right now.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:21.640]  And if we get our act together as a nation, together with other nations who you may not like,
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.640]  but will cooperate with us on this, that cooperation can settle this matter.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:30.640]  The problem is we haven't gotten that organized well enough together right now.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:30.640]  Amazing.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:36.640]  Lyndon LaRouche is our guest and you can also visit their website, LaRouchePak.com
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.640]  or also LaRouchePub.com.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.640]  Lyndon LaRouche will be with us on the other side to take phone calls.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.640]  Before we do that, I want to ask him what else is front and center on his radar.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.640]  I've got some articles from their site I want to go over.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:53.640]  And I want to look at the economy in more detail, the state of the economy,
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:05:16.640]  what's happening with the euro, where he sees the goller going straight ahead.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.640]  Silver Soul is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.640]  and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.640]  It can be used internally as well as topically
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.640]  and is highly effective against viruses, bacteria, molds, and yeasts.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.640]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation,
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.640]  arm yourself with supernatural silver.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.640]  Silver Soul liquid and gel are perfect for on-the-go emergency preparedness
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.640]  and can provide protection at home, school, or work.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.640]  Go to supernaturalsilver.com and be prepared for any emergency.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.640]  Remember the promo code Alex says for 20% off.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:59.640]  That's www.supernaturalsilver.com and like us on Facebook.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.640]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:23.640]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:30.640]  Well, he turns Night Amara, Lyndon LaRouche, and he is with us on the line.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.640]  Right now, your phone calls are coming up.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:38.640]  Lyndon, finishing up with all of your contacts in the Defense Department,
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:42.640]  in the CIA, everywhere else, and even the Washington Post admits
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.640]  you have amazing contacts.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.640]  And you were here over a year ago saying that the military didn't want to do this,
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:52.640]  and so much of what you've talked about has now come out in mainstream media.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:57.640]  So tell us what else is going on from your contacts that we're not aware of,
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:06.640]  that we don't know about, that's happening inside of the power structure.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.640]  Well, let's just take the things that don't get discussed
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.640]  in one way or the other, at least not in a significant way.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.640]  Let's take the case of curiosity.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:25.640]  We launched a successful flight of this instrument to Mars,
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:29.640]  and that may seem just like it's something very spectacular.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:32.640]  It got a lot of support from people, a lot of sympathy.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:37.640]  It was done in defiance of Obama, and that's important.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.640]  Now, the issue here is this.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:48.640]  The problems we're talking about on politics are not so much the real issues for the long term.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:55.640]  The great danger that we're facing is the danger from rocks in space.
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.640]  Now, this issue has been around for a long time.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.640]  Edward Teller, the famous Edward Teller who is now deceased,
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.640]  was a key sponsor of this effort to deal with this problem.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:10.640]  It is an actual serious threat to mankind.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:17.640]  Now, we have over periods of time, we have these giant rocks hitting different parts of the planet
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:23.640]  and taking out areas such as the equivalent of entire city areas, metropolitan cities, things like that.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:28.640]  But once in a while, you get in the history of mankind, not in terms of living history of mankind,
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.640]  but of the territory.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.640]  You get a one big rock, hits the earth, and everybody on earth dies,
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.640]  or everything on earth is sent to die.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.640]  It may come back later.
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:46.640]  So we're now at a point where the key issue before us in terms of defense of nations
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.640]  is the defense of earth from these rocks.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.640]  And the increase of the danger of that source is notable.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.640]  So therefore, we've got to do something about it.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.640]  And what happened was, by putting this thing over the president's strongest objections
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:07.640]  to put this thing on Mars, on curiosity, on Mars,
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:14.640]  we set into place an absolutely indispensable mechanism by which at the speed of light,
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.640]  which is the communication between us and Mars,
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:26.640]  we can determine things and make decisions and plan actions which will enable us now
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.640]  to realize what Edward Teller tried to deal with while he was still alive,
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:37.640]  the danger of rocks from the area of Jupiter down into so forth.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.640]  Well, that's right.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.640]  When they saw Schumacher and Levy crash into one of the gas giants and they did calculations,
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:48.640]  we know now that every few thousand years we get hit by big rocks, every hundred or a thousand or so,
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:52.640]  we get hit by these big mega rocks, every million or so, ones that kill most life on the planet.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:57.640]  And it just shows that the, why does the current ruling elite,
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:01.640]  because we've had corrupt elites before, but they wanted to build things, they wanted to advance things,
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:07.640]  they wanted to, I mean, even old colonialism, depending on the variant, did some good.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.640]  Overall, it was bad.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:19.640]  But now I see things like the new Obama 2012 film with Dinesh D'Souza coming out,
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:24.640]  and he's there saying Obama is a anti-colonialist.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.640]  That's why he wants to destroy the West.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:34.640]  But really, he's one of these British monarchy monopoly globalists that is actually trying to destroy the old hearts of empire.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:41.640]  They're in a type of Malthusian de-evolution program against the old nation states.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.640]  How would you quantify that?
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.640]  I would quantify that by the British monarchy's quantification.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:54.640]  Reduce the human population presently estimated in the range of seven billion persons to one billion persons in a short order.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.640]  And that's the British policy.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.640]  That's the policy of Obama.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.640]  Oh, he hasn't put it in exactly those terms, but that's what it is.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.640]  What has he done?
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.640]  We don't have production of food anymore.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.640]  We are destroying food supplies as they're being produced by turning them into chemical fuels.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:17.640]  So we are actually in a process of a small group of people, really.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.640]  It's not a big crowd.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.640]  It's a small group of people.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.640]  But our people have been so crushed.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.640]  Most people in the United States are crushed.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.640]  Their existence is being crushed.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:41.640]  And since the past three generations, or the past three administrations, the rate of destruction of our economy is horrible.
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:48.640]  So the real issue is to get back to a real economy, which means we have to get rid of this hyperinflation.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.640]  And that can be done by one law.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.640]  We could get rid of the whole hyperinflation.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.640]  Bring back Glass-Tiggle.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.640]  Let me ask you this question, because I know you're a historian in this area.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:07.640]  I mean, this is a Venetian black nobility, Balkanization form of welfare developed between the city-states in what is Italy today.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.640]  We know that it's exported to England.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.640]  That then becomes the model of empire.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.640]  But get us into the minds of these people.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.640]  Why do they want to not have a space program?
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.640]  Why do they want to make people poor?
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.640]  Why are they so evil?
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.640]  Well, take the case of the Roman Empire.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:29.640]  The Roman Empire died, and all these empire systems have died.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.640]  They've died out of their own self-destruction beforehand.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.640]  Byzantium, the same kind of thing.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.640]  The old Venetian system, again, the same thing.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.640]  The Dark Ages were the old system.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:46.640]  Then you had a revival of the same kind of system, which came up with the Anglo-Dutch version, which was called the New Venetian Party.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:53.640]  The New Venetian Party was then established the British monarchy and established it as an empire.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:13:01.640]  Therefore, you have a history of this tradition, of this kind of system, of what we call the oligarchical system,
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:08.640]  comes up where a few people are tried by various means to control the planet or large parts of it,
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.640]  and do a general destructive thing.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:16.640]  The problem has been that, despite our Constitution, and despite our intention,
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.640]  and the intention of some other countries to this effect,
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:24.640]  we have not been able to secure an actual system of government,
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:29.640]  which conforms to what our intention was in creating the United States.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.640]  Even the United States was unable, during much of its history,
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:38.640]  to avoid being crushed and gobbled up by oligarchical influences.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.640]  And that's the same thing now.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:47.640]  You have a very small minority of the influential part of the populations of various nations
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:52.640]  who are now raising hell against literally, against human species.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:58.640]  And this old thing is there, and we have somehow lost the guts to get rid of it.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.640]  Because what you see with the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States,
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.640]  and you see with similar institutions in Europe and in other parts of the world,
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:12.640]  that we do have the implicit ability to mobilize the kind of reforms,
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:18.640]  which could be readily applied now, to give us a system of global nation states,
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:22.640]  which would be, they might not all agree with each other,
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.640]  but we have a way of living together as nation states.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:33.640]  Briefly, before we go to calls, sir, can we get your take on the current state of the economy
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:37.640]  and what's happening in Europe and where you see all of that going?
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.640]  We're on the verge of an actual disintegration of the world economy.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:44.640]  A chain reaction kind of breakdown.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.640]  If this policy continues, if Obama were to continue as president,
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.640]  I can assure you that you would not have civilization on this planet.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.640]  So the Republicans aren't doing anything good,
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:00.640]  but Obama is something with his foreign influences,
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.640]  which is the greatest threat to the existence of the United States and other nations
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:07.640]  that I know of on this planet today.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:13.640]  Okay folks, stay there, we'll be right back with more of this interview with Lenin LaRouche.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:16:05.640]  If you want an American company with American products

[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:24.640]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.640]  by getting your own supply of foods from Eat Foods Direct now.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.640]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, Eat Foods will have to raise prices too.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.640]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:37.640]  I recently increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.640]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.

[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:47.640]  If you've been in stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.

[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:30.640]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance,
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.640]  nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.

[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.640]  and what most Silver Solution Manufacturers are producing,

[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:28.640]  What did you make of his statement telling entrepreneurs and scientists
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.640]  and inventors that you didn't build that?
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.640]  I mean, that was a calculated statement.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.640]  What is the point of a statement like that?
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.640]  Well, the man lies. There's no truth in him.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.640]  He's a pathological case. As a matter of fact, as I've described him,
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.640]  if you look back in history, he's a guy somebody picked up as a reasonable,
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:50.640]  wise guy, dirty trick as an echo of the Neo-Emperor Nero.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:54.640]  And if you read the history, the detailed history of the Emperor Nero,
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:59.640]  and you look at the mentality of this president, you find the two things concur.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:05.640]  They coincide. But somebody and some people got the bright idea of taking this character
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:11.640]  and by means which I wouldn't call exactly legal, got him picked as a president
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:15.640]  and stuck him in office and you see what he's done since being in office.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:20.640]  He's done everything indirectly as imitations to some degree.
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:24.640]  Adolf Hitler, in the sense of similar kinds of things were done
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:28.640]  and were done by the Neo-Emperor Nero and a few other creeps in between there.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.640]  Well, yeah, trying to shut down most our coal power plants,
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:38.640]  trying to pass carbon taxes, trying to end free speech,
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:41.640]  arresting journalists who talk to whistleblowers,
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.640]  and charging whistleblowers with the Espionage Act. I had Chris Edges,
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:50.640]  the renowned Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist on, who's a very respected quote liberal,
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.640]  and he said Obama is much worse than Bush.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:57.640]  And we can say, well, Bush, Obama are puppets.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:03.640]  But whatever oligarchy team is behind him is our raving lunatics
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:06.640]  because there is a madness of power.
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.640]  I mean, we tend to look at elites and say they know what they're doing.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:11.640]  There's a method of the madness.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.640]  But you talk about Nero or Caligula, those are good examples.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.640]  I mean, it really is. They're so disconnected.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.640]  It's like what's coming out at the Justice Department,
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.640]  and these women are resigning now.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:24.640]  So that Lynn's credence and a lot of other suits are getting filed.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:30.640]  The bizarre sexual escapades, the dressed up in dominatrix outfits,
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:35.640]  calling men into their offices, doing things on air I can't even mention.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.640]  This is a group of lunatics.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.640]  Fair term.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.640]  So what do you expect them to do to try to hold on to power?
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.640]  Because you're right.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.640]  You know, big Democrats like Hillary aren't going,
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:49.640]  Rahm Emanuel left early from the convention this week.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.640]  You know, even, was it Newsweek or was it Time came out and said,
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.640]  hit the road, Obama?
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:59.640]  I mean, it does look like a lot of the power structure is moving away from Obama.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.640]  Why is that?
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.640]  Well, essentially they know that.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:05.640]  But the part of it is the way the control works.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:10.640]  The control works through a few very powerful, also financially powerful people
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:16.640]  in various parts of the world who are able to lure other people
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.640]  into going along with this kind of stuff.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:20.640]  You see, many people, for example,
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.640]  we don't have any industries left in the United States today.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:27.640]  They were taken away, taken away in the past dozen years, especially.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:31.640]  So people feel powerless.
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:35.640]  Many people are going to die of starvation, actually, in the United States.
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:40.640]  And for other reasons, the situation of our people is hopeless,
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.640]  and yet it's very difficult to mobilize the people to defend themselves.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:48.640]  Well, yeah, we've got 47 million people, roughly, on food stamps.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:51.640]  You've got just all these other economic numbers
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.640]  that show we're really in a depression for four years.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.640]  You've got crime exploding,
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:58.640]  but the mainstream media tries to put a cover on it
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.640]  and say, oh, we left a recession four years ago.
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:05.640]  It's almost a Marie Antoinette let them eat cake
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:09.640]  while the Obama administration does everything it can,
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:15.640]  with Economics 101, to hurt poor people while posing as their savior.
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:20.640]  Imagine if we didn't have the people on the welfare cards,
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.640]  the digital food stamp cards,
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.640]  having 47 million people on the street at soup lines,
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:28.640]  what that would look like every day.
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:32.640]  Well, the problem is that our government has failed us.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.640]  Our political parties have failed us.
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:38.640]  The political parties go along to get along.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.640]  That's their slogan, and this has been a charge for that for a long time.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.640]  This slogan of the Senate, the slogan of the Congress,
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.640]  go along to get along.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.640]  And the rule that generally rules the congressional system,
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:55.640]  our representative system is that piece of corruption called go along to get along,
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.640]  which is the motto of the Congress.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:01.640]  And as long as we allow the Congress to go along to get along,
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:08.640]  and thus refusing to challenge their colleagues in the Congress to get this crap out,
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:11.640]  then we get this kind of government.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.640]  I know what's happening historically, and I want your brief take on this,
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.640]  and we're going to go to Col. Sir.
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:19.640]  So many times you mentioned Nero and others.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:24.640]  When they have all this power, the people in control at the very top
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:27.640]  start almost flirting with disaster,
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:33.640]  almost tempting it in their indolence, in their spoiled rottenness.
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:38.640]  It's like a moth to flame, and they play with destruction.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.640]  They flirt with it, and then bring it.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.640]  That's the case of history.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:48.640]  What we know of human history, we know that this kind of phenomenon
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.640]  is the source of all corruptions.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:55.640]  It's something which becomes a kind of a mass movement of self-corruption.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.640]  And those things have happened.
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.640]  Whole nations and even empires have disintegrated under that kind of corruption.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:07.640]  We have not yet succeeded, except in a few exceptional terms,
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:12.640]  especially in trying to do that with the North American development of our system.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.640]  But even our system then became corrupted in the same way.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.640]  Look, when Time Magazine writer Joel Stein makes fun of aborted babies,
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.640]  and I've covered it before you got on,
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.640]  and says we should have a beauty pageant of dead babies,
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:32.640]  and this is Time Magazine, it's reached a level of just insane Romans
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:37.640]  running around doing the types of things that Nero did at parties.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:41.640]  And it just shows that these are lunatics.
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.640]  Let's go to phone calls.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.640]  Joe in South Carolina, you're on the air with Lyndon LaRouche.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.640]  Go ahead.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:48.640]  Yes, thank you very much.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.640]  Mr. LaRouche, two points.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:54.640]  One, you talk about trying to mobilize the people to fix things here,
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.640]  get rid of people like Obama.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:00.640]  When we have something like the GOP that clearly doesn't want to fix the problem,
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.640]  obviously, because if they really wanted to get rid of Obama,
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:07.640]  they'd put someone like Ron Paul or the like of that as the candidate,
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.640]  because you pull all the Republicans, you pull a lot of independents,
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:14.640]  you pull a lot of other people that support that kind of character,
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:17.640]  and would get rid of someone like Obama and start fixing the problem.
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.640]  So we don't even have a political party that A, has the clout,
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:27.640]  and then B, the second point is that our electoral system is rigged to a certain extent.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:31.640]  There needs to be a question here, because we don't have a lot of time.
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.640]  The bottom line is he's saying the power structure itself
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:39.640]  is beginning to ignore the corrupt elements at the top,
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:44.640]  and that's the real revolution, is the velvet restoration of intellectually
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:48.640]  not complying, not going along, and speaking out against the system.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.640]  I mean, is that what you're getting at, Lyndon?
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:54.640]  Well, no, specifically what happens is when many people start to suffer
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:59.640]  and there's not enough to go along, then some people decide that,
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:03.640]  well, somebody have to survive, and we have to survive.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:06.640]  Unfortunately, other people will have to go.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:09.640]  And when that policy comes in, and that practice comes in,
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.640]  that's what you've got right now.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:15.640]  You've got that attitude within many parts of the public.
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:19.640]  You've got people in desperate conditions, and nothing is being done.
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:24.640]  And the president who's doing this to them, the worst president we had in our history,
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:30.640]  this president, is actually the engineer who's being given the support
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.640]  to carry out just exactly those policies.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:37.640]  Amazing. All right, we're going to come back, talk to Brad Listing on XM-166,
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:41.640]  talk to Scott Joseph Anthony, with quick questions, folks.
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:45.640]  You can, for Linda LaRouge, I mean, with kind of a speech about how we're in trouble,
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.640]  the political system's corrupt.
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.640]  Yeah, we've been talking about that for 40 minutes, 45 minutes.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.640]  I mean, we know that. I'm not saying the caller's a bad caller.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:29:04.640]  It's just that, yes, exactly, we have an insane ruling elite.

[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:41.640]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:44.640]  Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:46.640]  It's what my family uses.

[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:08.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:19.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:22.640]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:26.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:35.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:45.640]  Alright, coming up, we've got Dinesh DeSousa, author of the book that has been turned into the big blockbuster hit.
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:50.640]  Obama 2016, Obama's America.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:56.640]  We have, of course, the U.S. Ambassador to Libya killed Dettard and the Hammer, drug around.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:01.640]  And here is the latest out of CNN just out a few minutes ago.
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:04.640]  U.S. using drones to look for targets tied to attack.
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:08.640]  U.S. official says, looking for Jihadist.
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:13.640]  So they put him in and then now want to go claim they're going to kill him.
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:18.640]  They'll probably just kill somebody else they want to get rid of and blame it on him.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:21.640]  But pretty amazing to see all of this going on.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:28.640]  And a Marine unit has been dispatched to secure consulate in Benghazi after attack.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:33.640]  So it is definitely, it is definitely heating up right now.
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:39.640]  We'll be getting to more of that coming up throughout the broadcast today.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:43.640]  We will also continue breaking down other news.
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:45.640]  This is something we've been covering a lot now.
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:49.640]  Even children in your backyard, the police are coming and taking you to jail.
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:53.640]  Or a mother with her children in a cul-de-sac on scooters.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:55.640]  You're just not allowed to do that.
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:59.640]  The neighbor called when the neighbor on the snitch calls, the police come and arrest you.
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:03.640]  If you're an old man cleaning a gun in your backyard in the country, your neighbor sees it from 200 yards away.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:04.640]  You're going to jail.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:05.640]  The cops don't care.
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:07.640]  They're like, well, we better pick you up for psychological reasons.
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:12.640]  Because if a snitch calls, we've got to empower that snitch that they're God.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:17.640]  So if he even needs a Supreme Court now, you could just have a snitch busy body neighbor.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:20.640]  You know, just, you know, just announce the sun won't come up in the morning.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.640]  And, you know, they've got to like send a neutron beam at the sun to blow it up or something
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.640]  because he can't let it come up in the morning.
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.640]  If a snitch says it isn't coming up, you know, we've got to stop it.
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:33.640]  I mean, my point is that like these snitches are God.
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.640]  It's sad to our folks.
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:39.640]  But what's not sad tire is mom sues police over arrest.
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:40.640]  Laporte, Texas.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:46.640]  Stay at home mom from Laporte has filed a lawsuit against the city's police department and an unknown officer in one of her neighbors.
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:47.640]  Good.
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:50.640]  Tammy Cooper said she was wrongfully accused of endangering.
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.640]  Yeah, they should charge the neighbor with a false report with the cops.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:54.640]  I mean, where's the common sense here?
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:36:03.640]  Tammy Cooper said she was wrongly accused of endangering her children and was even forced to spend the night in jail all because she let her kids play outside.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:10.640]  In a cul-de-sac, in a rural area as she sat in a lawn chair and they dropped the charges, but it just shows the insanity.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.640]  Now, this is a short little segment, so I won't go to him now.
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:16.640]  We're going to go to break and we've got him to next to Suza.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:28.640]  Very excited about this interview because, as you know, a few weeks ago, I went and saw the new film by writer and director 2016, Obama's America.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:31.640]  And he, of course, works in the Reagan White House.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:43.640]  We'll give you his bio when we come back here in just a moment, but it gets into the psychology of why they want to lower the standard of living in the Western world, which is an admitted policy.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:49.640]  I mean, they pushed the Copenhagen tax three years ago in Denmark when they were over there.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:53.640]  They pushed that whole UN program saying they wanted to lower our standard, not build up the third world.
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:56.640]  They want to block its development as well.
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:05.640]  And it all ties into this whole agenda 21, the whole nine yards, so we're going to go to break here in a moment and come back with Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.640]  And again, he's in the news today.
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:22.640]  Deadline Hollywood is reporting that the 2016 Obama's America filmmaker reacts to President Slam looking for network to air before elections as mainstream media refusing coverage.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:28.640]  Well, I mean, if Dinesh D'Souza just wanted to make money, that's probably a good thing is that the theaters are still packed.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:39.640]  Dinesh D'Souza is the maker and a writer and director, and it's based on his book 2016 Obama's America that the system fought to even get the theaters.
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:43.640]  I went and saw it was very impressed with the quality of the production.
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:52.640]  I disagree with a few things in it and we'll get into that with Dinesh D'Souza who joins us until the bottom of the hour.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:38:01.640]  Of course, he worked in the Reagan White House as a World Affairs, you know, advisor and a policy analyst.
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:05.640]  And he is a bestselling author and journalist and he joins us now.
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.640]  Thank you for coming on the show, Dinesh.
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:10.640]  It's a great pleasure to be on.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:14.640]  Okay, so wow, tell us about the huge success of the film and where you're going.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.640]  Well, the film has become absolutely huge.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:23.640]  It started in the summer as a small film showing initially a single theater in Houston, Texas.
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:27.640]  Then it went to four theaters, expanded out to about a hundred.
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:30.640]  But it did so well in those hundred theaters and it jumped to a thousand theaters.
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.640]  It's now in two thousand theaters.
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:39.640]  So it's pretty much any American who wants to see the film can find it on our website, which is just 2016themovie.com.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:42.640]  We'll allow you to see a trailer and see where it's playing.
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:46.640]  The film has now become just surpassed two of Michael Moore's films,
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:51.640]  Sicko and Burling for Columbine, and also our film called An Inconvenient Truth.
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:56.640]  So we are now remarkably the second most successful political documentary of our time.
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:57.640]  Simply amazing.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:03.640]  It shows people are desperate for something than the mainstream pap they're being fed,
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:06.640]  certainly trailblazing in a big way here.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:10.640]  Dinesh, the basic thesis for those that don't know is that what?
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.640]  Obama is a global wealth redistributor?
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:14.640]  Yes.
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:20.640]  You know, many people think that Obama is a wealth redistributor in America, and he is.
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:23.640]  So when they talk about the one percent and ninety-nine percent,
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:26.640]  they think that Obama means in the United States.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:28.640]  But Obama's a global guy.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:31.640]  I mean, remember, here's a guy who grew up in part in Indonesia,
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:34.640]  made multiple trips to Pakistan, to Kenya.
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:38.640]  So Obama looks at all this from the world point of view.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:41.640]  And I think when he thinks of the one percent and ninety-nine percent,
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:44.640]  he puts all of America in the one percent.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:47.640]  And there are ninety-nine hungry nations encircling America,
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:50.640]  all of whom want America's standard of living,
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.640]  America's wealth, America's power, and so on.
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.640]  So Obama is not just recycling money in the United States.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:02.640]  He's also transferring large amounts of wealth from America to the rest of the world.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:06.640]  Dinesh, I want to get into the fact that you're in the news today
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:09.640]  talking about trying to get your film on television.
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:10.640]  Break that down.
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:13.640]  I see Deadline Hollywood reports.
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:18.640]  Exclusive 2016, Obama's America filmmaker reacts to President Slam.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.640]  And he's looking for a network to air before elections,
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:23.640]  says mainstream media, refusing coverage.
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:25.640]  Elaborate on that, Dinesh.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:26.640]  Well, it's been kind of loud.
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:28.640]  Do you remember when Michael Moore made his films?
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.640]  This guy was everywhere.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.640]  He was covered by the networks. He was on all the Sunday shows.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:36.640]  He was covered widely in the newspapers and so on.
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:39.640]  Our film, for a long time, was being ignored by the White House
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:42.640]  and lots of mainstream outlets just weren't covering it.
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.640]  They were just pretending like it didn't exist.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.640]  We're in a political season.
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:49.640]  This is the most successful political documentary of the year by far.
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:52.640]  And yet, it was getting no coverage at all.
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:53.640]  So this is peculiar.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:56.640]  And I think part of it was there was a sense that this documentary
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:00.640]  has harmful new information that might cause people
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:02.640]  to change their mind about Obama.
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.640]  So let's not cover it and let's pretend it doesn't exist.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.640]  Now the White House has figured out that they're like,
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640]  this has gotten too big.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.640]  We can't ignore it.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:10.640]  It's everywhere.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:12.640]  So they've come out blasting it.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.640]  But what a clumsy enough to blast it is.
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:17.640]  Because they're alleging all these errors in the film
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:21.640]  that are actually not errors, but they're easily provable.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:24.640]  And so I'm very happy to get into this one-on-one debate
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:25.640]  with Barack Obama.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:28.640]  I know it's a debate that I'm not worried that I'm going to lose.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:33.640]  Now continuing here with the success of the film,
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.640]  do you think it is having a major bearing on the election?
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:42.640]  Or could it be something that actually causes people to wake up
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:46.640]  to what Obama's doing and swing the election over to Romney?
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.640]  Well, the film isn't political in that way.
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:52.640]  I mean, it's not a film that's sort of just downward for Obama.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:55.640]  In fact, the bigger issue here is the American dream.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:58.640]  And in the film we contrast two dreams,
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:00.640]  the American dream and Obama's dream.
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:01.640]  You know, I'm an immigrant.
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:03.640]  I grew up in India.
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:05.640]  And so my dream is the American dream.
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:07.640]  You know, I believe in a society of merit,
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:10.640]  a society in which free markets generate wealth.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:13.640]  America is, of course, for good and for freedom in the world.
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:15.640]  That's my American dream.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.640]  Well, Obama has a different dream,
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:19.640]  and it's the dream from his father.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:21.640]  That's the title of his autobiography.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:24.640]  And so in the film we go and find out who was his father.
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.640]  What was his father's dream?
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:28.640]  And it turns out to be a third-world dream.
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:30.640]  In some ways, an anti-American dream.
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:34.640]  Certainly, it's a dream of reducing America's influence in the world,
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:37.640]  treating America, if you will, as a rogue nation.
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:41.640]  So in some ways, yeah, it is true that Obama holds these ideas,
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:43.640]  but they're righter than Obama.
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.640]  They're, in fact, believed by many people in Riyadh and Jakarta
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:48.640]  and Rio de Janeiro.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:51.640]  It's just that we've never had a president of the United States
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:53.640]  who holds these views.
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:43:19.640]  We'll be back with more with filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza straight ahead.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:26.640]  This is the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:28.640]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is,
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:30.640]  this is the film for you.

[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:39.640]  None dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen,
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:41.640]  the book that woke me up.
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:43.640]  We're also carrying behind-the-green-mask
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:45.640]  You and Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:48.640]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:51.640]  The greater good, the most professional and up-to-date film
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:54.640]  I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.640]  These titles and a lot more

[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.640]  and laughing as you get sick and die?

[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:26.640]  Alright my friends we are back.
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:32.440]  And more of the amazing interview I did with filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza in his new documentary,
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:35.520]  which has been the number one film this year in documentary, number two documentary of
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.400]  all time, Obama's America 2016.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.400]  Here it is.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:49.360]  Dinesh, D'Souza, maker of the second biggest political documentary in all time, 26 million
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:50.360]  grossed in a month.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:53.320]  It's going to be the theaters another month and a half, then go to DVD.
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.720]  Look, I think your film is a masterpiece.
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:56.720]  I mean, it's cinematic.
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:57.720]  Leave the style.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:59.160]  I'm a filmmaker myself.
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:02.160]  The Obama deception is free online for folks that want to watch that.
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:07.360]  I mean, I was impressed with what you brought to the table because most political documentaries
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:09.640]  are at about a fourth grade level.
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:13.440]  And I'm not insulting your film, but yours is, you know, at a eighth grade, tenth grade
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.440]  level.
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:18.520]  And I guess in media, they say, keep it at about a fourth grade level.
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:24.040]  But I mean, you actually tackle issues of globalism that, well, there's one point in
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:28.480]  the film, if I'm wrong where you say, and show the evidence that it's not that they
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:32.800]  want to build up the third world, they want to bring us down to that level.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:33.800]  And that's a big deal.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:36.560]  Yeah, with Obama, it's not about building up.
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:40.920]  I mean, he's like, he rarely even talks that much about the inner city or about the poor.
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:45.360]  He gets excited when he's pulling down the rich, that's his target.
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:50.480]  And that's when, when you begin to see Obama's, you know, his voice rises and he gets animated
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:51.480]  and so on.
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:53.720]  So, ultimately, this is about leveling down.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:54.720]  I agree.
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:59.160]  And it also, but not just wealth, he's also leveling American power.
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:03.240]  I think he doesn't like a world in which one country, America, is the sole superpower.
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:07.840]  He'd like to see Russia come up, China come up, India come up, Brazil come up.
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:12.640]  He wants to see a multipolar world in which there are many countries sharing power.
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:16.480]  And by the way, many countries that have a roughly equal number of nuclear weapons,
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:21.560]  that's why he's spending less time trying to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:25.000]  and more time trying to slash the American nuclear arsenal.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  Let me say this to you.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.680]  I mean, obviously you've worked inside the Republican White House of Ronald Reagan.
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:32.280]  I think it's fair to say you're a Republican operative.
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.880]  No, no, no, that's not fair to say.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:39.640]  I mean, I worked in the Reagan White House in my mid-20s, I mean, I'm 51 years old and
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:40.640]  the president of a college.
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:45.200]  So I just want to say I'm, I'm a conservative, but I mean, I have nothing to do with Ramney
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:46.200]  or the RNC.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.200]  I'm not a Republican.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:48.200]  Okay.
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:49.200]  Well, the now that you've said that, I respect that.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.080]  And again, I haven't gone over your LinkedIn bio because of the time, but you're obviously
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:54.720]  a scholar as well.
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:55.720]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:59.280]  Ramney is the worst Republican I have ever seen.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:01.920]  Obviously, I don't have to list everything.
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:07.560]  When he was actually a governor, abortion, open borders, restrictions of guns, carbon
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:10.360]  taxes, wrote the Obama plan.
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:15.400]  I mean, all of this, my issue is that I want Obama out of there.
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:18.200]  I don't want him to not be facing a reelection.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:22.040]  I mean, even if Romney is going to be bad, at least he'll be facing a reelection.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:25.880]  So I am saying, okay, I see people that want to support Romney.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.520]  My issue is this.
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:33.560]  What will you do if Romney gets in and continues what some of these monopoly capitalists want
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:38.480]  that have been financing Obama who want tyranny, not liberty, who don't want to free market?
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:42.840]  What are you going to do to Mitt Romney if he gets in and continues what Obama's been
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:43.840]  doing?
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.880]  Hey, listen, don't give me any ideas, I may have to make another film.
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:51.760]  But look, I don't know about Romney.
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:53.600]  As you know, we don't mention Romney in the film.
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:54.920]  This really is a referendum.
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:57.120]  I think this election is a referendum on Obama.
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:01.400]  If I had to say what this election is about, I'd even say it's about Obama versus Obama.
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:02.400]  Right?
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:07.160]  There's the cellular Obama, the mythical Obama that was put out in 2008, the unifier,
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.160]  the healer, the centrist.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:09.160]  I claim that that Obama does not exist.
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:10.160]  And then there's the real Obama.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:17.440]  The guy in the right house, the guy who can't change, the guy who can't move to the center,
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:22.920]  the guy who has been affirmed in his mind by a combination of radicals, revolutionaries,
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:27.200]  in one case, a former communist and domestic terrorist, Bill Ayers, I mean, these were
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:28.200]  his buddies.
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:29.200]  These are the guys.
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:30.200]  This is the real Obama.
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:33.680]  So it's a matter of, does America want to have the real Obama?
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:34.680]  Wow.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:38.440]  So you're saying, you're saying all the communist pornographers and weirdos that he lived with
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:44.360]  and was associated with, you're saying that wasn't just his foundation cover as a leftist.
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:53.040]  You're saying he really is a real globalist, Marxist, Leninist, de-industrializing crazyman.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:55.320]  Well, here's what I'm saying.
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:58.320]  You know, Frank Marshall Davis was introduced to him by his grandfather.
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:02.960]  So all right, I'll say that that was somebody that his grandfather brought him in front
[01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:03.960]  of.
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:07.400]  And he was only 10 years old when he met Frank Marshall Davis, but every other guy, the
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:13.520]  Palestinian radical, Edward Said, the Brazilian socialist hunger at Harvard Law School, Bill
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:18.680]  Ayers, the incendiary preacher, Jeremiah Wright, I mean, Obama didn't bump into these guys.
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:19.680]  He slapped them out.
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:20.680]  No, I understand.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:27.320]  Because he wanted to hang around radical revolutionary guys who he imagined to be surrogate fathers,
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:29.520]  kind of like his real dad who ran around.
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:34.600]  Let me raise this in the five minutes we've got left with a Dinesh D'Souza here, the maker
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:40.960]  of 2016, Obama's America, which is an amazing film, Dinesh, looking at this then, if he's
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:45.480]  as bad as you say, and I think the evidence is there, the Fast and Furious, a false flag
[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:51.040]  against the Second Amendment, the list goes on and on, we've got all these Obama advisors
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:55.320]  in the Financial Times of London, you name it, saying, don't worry if he's down in the
[01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:58.800]  polls, they'll be an event we're going to blame on their enemies.
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:03.040]  They don't say they're going to stage it, but they imply don't worry something's coming.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:06.840]  I'm sure you've seen that in the news because it's been pushed for two years.
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:09.280]  Are you concerned he could pull an October surprise?
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:10.280]  Not so much.
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:11.280]  I mean, he could.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:12.280]  That's a possibility.
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:18.600]  What I really do in the film and my work is I say, I don't even need to go there.
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:21.280]  I don't even need to speculate about what he could do.
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:26.520]  I'm just going to look at what he has done, and I'm going to extrapolate out to what happens
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:32.040]  if he just keeps doing that over the next four years, so he's added $5 trillion in debt.
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:37.080]  Let's say he adds another $5 trillion, a very cautious and reasonable estimate, then America
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:42.520]  will be $20 trillion in debt, and $10 trillion of that will have been added by one man, Obama.
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:46.120]  And then I said, wait a minute, why would one guy want to do that?
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:51.040]  Why would someone want to saddle his country with almost unrepayable debt?
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:52.040]  And then I offer a theory.
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:56.840]  I said, well, maybe he sees debt as a way to settle America's colonial debt.
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:58.920]  It's kind of like we are the rest of the world.
[01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:03.240]  I can't get a foreign aid program passed that would transfer trillions of dollars in
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:07.480]  wealth, but I can achieve the same effect, because if our children and grandchildren have
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:12.120]  to pay back all this debt, and some of that debt is owed to Koreanies and to Saudis and
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:17.560]  to Chinese, well, that's another way to transfer larger trillions of dollars outside the United
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:19.440]  States to all these other countries.
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:24.040]  But, again, I go back to the issue, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, I mean, you look at the
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:29.800]  list of people that are not just supporting Obama, they supported all of his policies.
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:31.400]  They are financing everything he wants.
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:38.640]  I'm saying these globalists, we need conservatives and libertarians to recognize that there are
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:40.280]  two different groups of capitalists.
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:45.320]  They're the free market capitalists, they're the monopoly capitalists who want tyranny,
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:49.800]  who don't want freedom, who don't want us to have choice, who are working through big
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:54.360]  government types like Obama to convert us to an authoritarian system.
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:59.800]  That's all I'm saying, is that all this corruption and globalism didn't just start with Obama.
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:04.960]  Yes, I agree with that, and even as I mentioned that, you know, you're well aware, I'm well
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:10.960]  aware that Reagan added $200 billion a year, and that Bush, of course, was a big spender.
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:16.000]  He, Bush's largest deficit was half a trillion, but again, keep things in perspective.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:21.280]  His smallest deficit is more than double that, it's a trillion dollars.
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:26.240]  And so, I think what Obama's done is just lift things to a sort of complete and unacceptable
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:27.800]  new level.
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:34.280]  I hear you, I hear you, it just makes me so upset to see this country and the TSA sticking
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:38.880]  their hands down our pants, looking for bin Laden, while NATO and our own government is
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:44.120]  putting al-Qaeda in as the main shock force in Libya and Syria.
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:49.520]  It's just, it's so scary to see what both parties have become, the torture, the secret
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:52.520]  arrest, the wars, all of it.
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:56.120]  And I cover all that in the Obama deception I made it three and a half years ago.
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:57.520]  It's all come true, unfortunately.
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:01.680]  All right, well, we're going to go to break here and I'll talk to you as we go to break
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:06.680]  and as you leave us and then I'll find a PO box or something to send the film to you.
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:10.840]  Because, I mean, I get it, Obama's really bad, but I think he's a manifestation of how
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:13.320]  far along this globalist line we've gotten.
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:18.440]  Do you think Obama, in closing, may backfire on the establishment and may cause a pendulum
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:20.440]  swing back towards liberty?
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:23.240]  I, well, I certainly hope so.
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:28.400]  I mean, I hope that people are using this sort of intense interest in politics that will
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:33.120]  be generated this year to think about what's happened to the American dream and, you know,
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:36.160]  is this American era, which began in 1945?
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:42.520]  We never even got into, you didn't build that.
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:46.400]  You know, I agree with Dinesh this is that Obama is a collectivist.
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:52.040]  In fact, Obama is now out in video saying, quote, I actually believe in redistribution.
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:57.200]  The media is attacking Mitt Romney, saying that he's wrong to say that it's a bad idea
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:58.920]  to have half the public on welfare.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:03.320]  We're in a lot of trouble because the system can get enough people dependent.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:06.800]  They will vote to take our guns, our private property, everything else.
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:10.560]  The problem is, I don't think Mitt Romney will actually follow his rhetoric of a free
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.920]  market American type system.
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:17.000]  But regardless, we're putting the info out here and hopefully we can get this country
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.760]  back on the right track.
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:23.840]  I'll see you all tomorrow back on the radio, 11 a.m. central, 12 noon Eastern with a weekday
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.800]  edition of the Alex Jones show.
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:43.760]  Until then, be safe.
