[00:00.000 --> 00:26.560]  Just minutes ago Biden concluded a statement he made from the White House where he declared
[00:26.560 --> 00:32.320]  total war on our infrastructure in the American people but couched it in a rescued package.
[00:33.840 --> 00:39.680]  It'd be like taking your child out to the edge of a cliff that's a thousand feet tall and
[00:40.480 --> 00:43.760]  throwing them off the edge of the cliff and then once they bounce dead at the bottom
[00:44.480 --> 00:51.840]  throwing a parachute package satchel out so that it falls and bounces next to their dead body.
[00:51.840 --> 00:57.360]  Or it's like shooting somebody in the head with a shotgun and giving them a bandaid.
[00:58.560 --> 01:04.400]  We'll play the clip part of it coming up next segment. This is all a concerted UN
[01:04.400 --> 01:09.680]  global government Bill and Melinda Gates CHICOM plan. It's all exactly choreographed, laid out,
[01:09.680 --> 01:15.120]  planned. All those special transmission tomorrow at 3 p.m. Central and commercial free laying out
[01:15.120 --> 01:20.560]  the most critical documents that were discovered in this operation. But I mean here's just an
[01:20.560 --> 01:32.160]  example. I told you back last year before GZPING even announced it that communist China was going
[01:32.160 --> 01:37.760]  to be at the heart of the global social credit score through QR codes for you to leave your house,
[01:37.760 --> 01:42.400]  buy or sell, get on a train, a plane, have a job, get on an airplane, you name it.
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.760]  And then GZPING a few months later came out and said, yes, he's running it with a UN.
[01:47.760 --> 01:55.120]  It is now official that the UN is preparing China to run the global QR system. Oh and don't worry,
[01:55.120 --> 01:58.960]  that way they're all standardized and we're all safe. So you're going to have internal
[01:58.960 --> 02:03.120]  passports worldwide dictated by the UN and the communist Chinese.
[02:06.320 --> 02:11.920]  Data firm head. China has asked Wahoo to let it run global vaccine passport system.
[02:11.920 --> 02:16.160]  Kind of like the US created the internet so we ran ICANN. Now that's been given to the UN.
[02:16.160 --> 02:19.680]  Well, the UN is in control of this. Bill Gates is in control of the UN
[02:20.640 --> 02:24.240]  and now they're going to have China at ministry. You think, oh, that'll never happen. Oh, really?
[02:25.040 --> 02:28.000]  Remember three years ago, I made a big deal about it and that's what Tim Cook said,
[02:28.000 --> 02:34.640]  Jones must be any platform now. Reuters had an article saying Chinese intelligence runs Apple
[02:34.640 --> 02:37.920]  and the executive said, that's what happens when you're in China. They now officially have moved
[02:37.920 --> 02:43.520]  there to have tax exemption completely on corporate income tax. So Apple's new base is not Seattle,
[02:43.520 --> 02:52.640]  Washington or Silicon Valley in California. It is Beijing. It is Peking. It is communist China.
[02:53.520 --> 03:01.200]  It is Shanghai. And they said in the article, yeah, there it is. Apple's data shows deep
[03:01.200 --> 03:05.760]  independence on China as Trump tariffs loom. And they say in there that the code keys to every
[03:05.760 --> 03:12.480]  laptop, every desktop, every phone are held by the CCP. And the article says it's no big deal.
[03:12.480 --> 03:18.160]  And I was told I was banned a week after that. And Tim Cook said this is incredible because I
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.560]  actually got that Trump, the Reuters article. I got it to him through a Fox TV host.
[03:24.720 --> 03:32.640]  And boy, did they get pissed. That was the last straw. When Trump said, excuse me, Apple has
[03:32.640 --> 03:38.240]  codes in China to everybody's phones, including mine. He called Tim Cook on the phone, I was told.
[03:38.240 --> 03:45.840]  And Tim Cook went into a rage later. So I've gotten pieces of it from every angle.
[03:46.640 --> 03:50.400]  So it's just unbelievable. It is the battle over Obama's internet surrender.
[03:51.760 --> 03:54.880]  That was the Wall Street Journal five years ago. Print me that article, please. I've
[03:54.880 --> 03:57.360]  forgotten about that. I mean, I mentioned it, but I forgot to get articles about it.
[03:58.320 --> 04:00.240]  So that's where we're at, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:02.960 --> 04:06.240]  There's the BBC reporting what I'm telling you. So I'm going to explain this again.
[04:06.240 --> 04:12.080]  Worldwide, last March, in every restaurant on the planet that was computerized, you went in,
[04:12.080 --> 04:16.960]  they said no more menus, scan a QR code. That is to habituate you for the new global system
[04:16.960 --> 04:20.640]  that's a QR code. Then they're going to claim problems with that and demand a face scan,
[04:20.640 --> 04:24.880]  which they're now already announcing. So China will run a global database with the UN,
[04:24.880 --> 04:28.960]  controlling everywhere you go, what you do, checkmate we're taking over. And our Trojan
[04:28.960 --> 04:33.040]  Horse government, run by the FBI, the Justice Department, and all these lawyers that have
[04:33.040 --> 04:39.280]  sold us out and Biden are doing it now with enjoyment. And the border is being collapsed.
[04:39.280 --> 04:45.120]  Everything's being done by design. We're live teleproport free. It's Friday, April 2. The year
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.360]  is 2021. Drew Hernandez is about to go down to the border this weekend. We'll be watching his
[04:49.360 --> 04:52.720]  coverage. Great reporter. He'll be a few hours, a third hour. I'm going to put the phones up
[04:52.720 --> 04:57.680]  later in this hour and the second hour. We have another amazing guest toes coming up in the fourth
[04:57.680 --> 05:02.480]  hour. The globalists are purposely collapsing our world. They're creating insecurity.
[05:02.480 --> 05:08.320]  Crying, war, and famine. All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready
[05:08.320 --> 05:13.920]  for ourselves and our family's sakes, but also our community. And citizenstronghold.com is the
[05:13.920 --> 05:18.800]  best place to go to get high quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find. Again,

[06:11.280 --> 06:17.120]  Job created in the first two months in any administration history, but we still have a long
[06:17.120 --> 06:23.120]  way to go to get our economy back on track after the worst economic and job crisis in nearly a
[06:23.120 --> 06:30.640]  century. But my message to the American people is this. Help is here. Opportunity is coming.
[06:31.360 --> 06:40.080]  And a long last there's hope for so many families, so many families. Credit for this progress belongs
[06:40.080 --> 06:44.800]  not to me, but to the American people. Hard work in women and men who have struggled through this
[06:44.800 --> 06:50.800]  pandemic, never given up and are determined to get the country back on track as well as their
[06:50.800 --> 06:58.320]  families. But I think it's also reflection of two things we're doing here. First, the new economic
[06:58.320 --> 07:03.600]  strategy we've launched, one focused on building from the bottom up in the middle out and one that
[07:03.600 --> 07:11.360]  puts government on the side of working people and that rewards work, not wealth. When we invest in
[07:11.360 --> 07:17.440]  the American people, it's not just those at the top that make our economy grow. They're the ones
[07:17.440 --> 07:23.840]  that make it grow. Ordinary Americans. We saw the economy gain traction in March as the American
[07:23.840 --> 07:29.440]  rescue plan moved and got passed, bringing new hope to our country. We're going to continue
[07:30.080 --> 07:38.800]  to implement that law in the weeks ahead. It is Friday, April 2, 2021. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[07:38.800 --> 07:46.560]  We're going to analyze the statements that Biden just concluded giving there at the White House,
[07:47.680 --> 07:53.920]  the puppet in chief. Everything they're doing is to demoralize the country, to kill the pipelines,
[07:53.920 --> 07:59.280]  to jack up gas prices, to put in a huge new tax increase that will make even more jobs,
[07:59.280 --> 08:05.200]  leave the country. Everything they're doing is to destroy the very existence of this nation.
[08:05.200 --> 08:12.320]  We are under total economic war. Friday live, Biden pledges to destroy America's racist highways.
[08:12.320 --> 08:17.680]  I'm not joking. While China unveils plan to administer global vaccine passports,
[08:19.520 --> 08:22.960]  think about the magnitude of how we're being conquered, not just by the UN,
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.840]  but by the Communist Chinese. And I'm going to lay all of this out for you today.
[08:27.840 --> 08:35.600]  Biden's infrastructure bill includes 20 billion to destroy highways for being racist.
[08:36.240 --> 08:44.480]  In New York City, the loop around the city will be destroyed. The loop around New Orleans destroyed.
[08:44.480 --> 08:49.200]  The giant new highway they're building in North Houston that everybody desperately needs.
[08:51.920 --> 08:55.680]  He just signed an order. They're not going to build it. It's already halfway built.
[08:55.680 --> 09:03.280]  Total devastation. I mean, this is just... B-52 bombers couldn't do this much damage to us.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.400]  It's a total shutdown of the country. It is a Gen. of 21, a Gen. of 2030.
[09:10.400 --> 09:14.560]  It is the great reset. It is the post-industrial world. Meanwhile, China is building giant,
[09:14.560 --> 09:19.200]  empty ghost cities that could house millions, giant bridges, the biggest in the world,
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.960]  just trillions of investment, and everything is going back to the one-sided trade deal where you
[09:24.960 --> 09:31.120]  cannot operate here. Biden has pledged to shut down the remaining coal power plants in the nation,
[09:31.120 --> 09:36.240]  and that we're preparing to have consistent rolling blackouts and just the total collapse of the
[09:36.240 --> 09:43.600]  country. You will not be able to do business here. This is called siege. The oldest form of war is to
[09:43.600 --> 09:48.880]  isolate and turn people's energy off, their water off, their food off, and then they're going to have
[09:48.880 --> 09:53.120]  this whole fight over the scraps the whole time telling us they're here to help, they're here to
[09:53.120 --> 09:57.360]  help, they're here to help, they're here to help. It's like reaching out for somebody's hand. You've
[09:57.360 --> 10:00.400]  already knocked them off the cliff, they're hanging on by their fingers. You come and say,
[10:00.400 --> 10:06.400]  let me help you, and you start stepping on their fingers. And to watch this speech was just blood
[10:06.400 --> 10:16.640]  curdling evil. Look, I didn't predict any of this. People are going to go pull clips from a year ago.
[10:16.640 --> 10:24.400]  They're going to go pull clips from 14 months ago, back in February. And they're going to say,
[10:25.840 --> 10:30.000]  Jones said it came out of the Wuhan lab, Jones said it was a chimera, Jones said Bill Gates was
[10:30.000 --> 10:36.560]  behind it, because it was all on record then. There were major debates in hundreds of sign of
[10:36.560 --> 10:42.000]  publications that I've seen hundreds, probably thousands, saying you can't have gain of function
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.760]  viruses being made at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. So they moved it to Wuhan and Fauci and Gates ran
[10:47.760 --> 10:53.360]  it, 11 programs. You can't make up that the World Fact-Checking Group comes out of the Wuhan
[10:53.360 --> 10:57.760]  lab, but they actually fact-checked American, European internet, Australian internet, African
[10:57.760 --> 11:05.360]  internet, global internet through Wuhan lab. They launched the attack of a simulant virus
[11:05.360 --> 11:09.920]  that does kill people, but it's only the precursor to the real virus they're going to release.
[11:09.920 --> 11:14.080]  And I told you that Bill Gates has now said that. It's back in the news today. They say, oh,
[11:14.080 --> 11:18.160]  how much deadlier type is coming. Don't worry, you're going to wish for the days of COVID.
[11:18.160 --> 11:23.360]  And this was all just a drill to lock us down and make sure we behave when they hit us with a real
[11:23.360 --> 11:29.360]  weapon. And so you either wake up to the horror we're in and you say no to it and we fight back
[11:29.360 --> 11:33.920]  against it politically, culturally, economically, and then defensively of need because we are being
[11:33.920 --> 11:39.680]  assaulted or we submit and die. But make no mistake, this is a civilization ending,
[11:39.680 --> 11:44.560]  nasty population culling program. The globalists believe they're carrying out an act of pre-age
[11:44.560 --> 11:53.680]  to save the earth. So let me just show you these headlines. Data firm head. China has asked who to
[11:53.680 --> 11:59.680]  let it run global vaccine passport system. The chairman of the data firm, Panda, claims,
[11:59.680 --> 12:04.560]  well, he doesn't claim. Paul's just watching an article. Paul's great. But yeah, he's not claiming
[12:04.560 --> 12:09.600]  it's fact. The China has asked the World Health Organization to appoint Beijing to oversee the
[12:09.600 --> 12:16.640]  global vaccine passport system. An ominous prospect giving China's social credit score system operates.
[12:17.520 --> 12:23.440]  Their interview with the integral business investment conference, Nick Hudson, explained
[12:23.440 --> 12:28.080]  why this was such a chilling development saying he was worried about the fabric of society and the
[12:28.080 --> 12:34.800]  future of his children. China is petitioning the World Health Organization to appoint it to run the
[12:34.800 --> 12:39.840]  global immune passport program. Now, if that doesn't scare the living daylights out of you,
[12:39.840 --> 12:43.840]  I don't know what will, said Hudson. This kind of centralization, this kind of control,
[12:43.840 --> 12:47.440]  social credit systems we need to push back against this stuff because it's coming.
[12:48.480 --> 12:53.360]  It's not coming. It's here. Well, let me see because, you know, oh, it's claimed by this guy
[12:53.360 --> 13:01.440]  who's involved in it. No. Here's CNN, November 23rd last year. China's Xi Jinping is pushing for
[13:01.440 --> 13:06.640]  global COVID QR code. He may struggle to convince the world. They're always making, oh, don't worry.
[13:06.640 --> 13:10.560]  It's coming, but don't worry. It's always the same tactic. He's already running it with the UN. They
[13:10.560 --> 13:15.360]  already own it. The globalists put Xi Jinping in charge. The globalists put the UN in charge. The
[13:15.360 --> 13:20.640]  Rockefellers did it all. Here it is. Okay. You read the article. They admit they're setting it up in
[13:20.640 --> 13:26.640]  petition to do it. Chinese president Xi Jinping pushes for QR code, base global travel system, MSN.
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.840]  China trying to use COVID fears to launch global tracking system for humans.
[13:33.520 --> 13:39.360]  There it all is. So it's not just draconian and bad. They're getting all the corporations that
[13:39.360 --> 13:45.120]  already teamed up with China to do it outside of even our government. And just like with big tech,
[13:45.120 --> 13:49.120]  running the country, censoring everybody, censoring the president, helping steal the election,
[13:49.120 --> 13:54.160]  Congress will sit there and the governors will sit there with their thumbs. You know where,
[13:54.800 --> 14:02.960]  while this happens. Give everyone a barcode. China is trying to use COVID fears to launch
[14:02.960 --> 14:12.560]  global tracking system, CBN. And now here we are, and it's all unfolding right now. That's why when
[14:12.560 --> 14:17.520]  you go to a restaurant and they have a QR code, or they go, would you like to do the touchless
[14:17.520 --> 14:23.520]  pay for COVID? It's all mental illness. It's all garbage. The same number of people died roughly
[14:23.520 --> 14:31.680]  in 2020, died in 2019. If you had population increase, actually the number of deaths went down
[14:31.680 --> 14:36.800]  because somebody was driving cars was a lot less automobile accidents. And that's all borne out
[14:36.800 --> 14:42.880]  by the numbers. That's all borne out by the numbers. But we just sit here and we put up with this.
[14:42.880 --> 14:47.360]  But yeah, if you're in the dark, not getting vitamin D, not getting zinc, not getting leafy vegetables,
[14:47.360 --> 14:51.920]  not getting any of that, yeah, anything will kill you. You will die. And I know everybody knows
[14:51.920 --> 14:55.840]  that, but we've got to explain it to everybody else and say, hey, let's stop complying and it's
[14:55.840 --> 15:02.960]  starting to happen. We're going to go to break. I'm going to come back and get more into the next
[15:02.960 --> 15:07.040]  real assault they're getting ready to launch. I told you they are. Now they're admitting it. I
[15:07.040 --> 15:11.600]  know their mind. I know their operations. But first, before I hit this incredible stack of news,
[15:11.600 --> 15:14.960]  CNN says you shouldn't be allowed to leave your house unless you take whatever vaccines Bill
[15:14.960 --> 15:19.200]  Gates says. Well, they say, oh, don't worry about the side effects of the death. It's worth it.
[15:21.360 --> 15:28.880]  That's all coming up. But first, I want to hit racist highways and Joe Biden and the speech he
[15:28.880 --> 15:34.720]  just gave about how he's rescuing you and he's saving you with a $1,400 check. Many people
[15:34.720 --> 15:41.840]  ought to work for a year. Oh, but $1,400. That's one he's a hero like Superman with a red cape.
[15:41.840 --> 15:46.000]  I mean, except he looks like an old dead corpse. Looks like a kind of a dead Superman, but all
[15:46.000 --> 15:53.600]  shriveled like the mummy man, mummy man. And he's the chai-com up it. We'll be right back to lay it
[15:53.600 --> 16:01.040]  out for you. I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast. I love it on
[16:01.040 --> 16:05.680]  their 27 years. Only the last year or so have I said that. But let me tell you, the new world
[16:05.680 --> 16:10.160]  orders breathing down our neck. The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're
[16:10.160 --> 16:14.800]  doing everything they can to shut us down. So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air
[16:14.800 --> 16:18.720]  and please support the local station you're listening to as well. At the same time,

[16:30.320 --> 16:35.440]  your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you
[16:35.440 --> 16:40.960]  don't support us. So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,

[18:20.560 --> 18:27.680]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars. So this is not a joke,
[18:29.360 --> 18:34.640]  this is real. They've shut down the Keystone pipeline, it cost tens of millions of dollars
[18:34.640 --> 18:40.240]  to build, and it was going to literally buoy the entire U.S. economy and have our oil exports
[18:40.240 --> 18:43.200]  be completely dominant for the next 20 years. That's been shut off.
[18:43.200 --> 18:50.880]  And the left is saying they've got all these bills to destroy our dams and our hydroelectric
[18:50.880 --> 18:53.600]  facilities that create electricity, they're shutting down all the coal power plants,
[18:54.400 --> 18:57.600]  they're devaluing the dollar, they're announcing we're not open for business,
[18:57.600 --> 19:02.880]  they're announcing huge new tax increases, which will stall the economy out even faster.
[19:03.600 --> 19:08.400]  They ordered these illegal lockdowns that have bankrupted half of the small businesses in the
[19:08.400 --> 19:13.440]  U.S., most of which will never come back. In fact, some numbers are even worse than that. But here's
[19:13.440 --> 19:22.240]  Biden saying he's going to save you and that it's a loving hand, $1,400 for what's happened to you.
[19:22.240 --> 19:26.320]  So you got a couple thousand dollars for the first six months, now you get $1,400 for the next,
[19:26.320 --> 19:33.120]  and you go into debt, you get to pay it back yourself. This is the Uniform Social Credit
[19:33.120 --> 19:38.480]  score. This is the universal guaranteed basic income to totally control you. That's what the head
[19:38.480 --> 19:42.000]  of the Federal Reserve says they want. And who's the head of the Federal Reserve? They're the head
[19:42.000 --> 19:48.000]  of the private, foreign, European banking consortium that hijacked this country in 1913. Hard to
[19:48.000 --> 19:55.920]  believe now, 108 years ago. Seems like yesterday we had the 110th anniversary of that. So these
[19:55.920 --> 20:02.400]  people want us under their control just like in Venezuela or just like in Argentina or just
[20:02.400 --> 20:08.160]  like in North Korea. They're doing it by design. Give people some freedom, same population, same
[20:08.160 --> 20:12.080]  people, same culture. You get South Korea rich and powerful, but just a little bit of freedom.
[20:12.080 --> 20:17.600]  No freedom, hell on earth. It's a decision by these people, and it's so cynical. Look at these
[20:17.600 --> 20:24.160]  headlines on infowars.com. Biden infrastructure bill includes $20 billion to destroy highways
[20:24.160 --> 20:30.240]  for being racist. Now, if you're not aware of this, I'm not joking. Here's some of the headlines.
[20:30.240 --> 20:35.680]  Here's out of the news Gazette. Biden administration made target racist highways. That was December.
[20:36.960 --> 20:42.320]  Woman called for highway removal in a black neighborhood. Oh, my God. One person calls for
[20:42.320 --> 20:46.640]  a statue to come down. One person calls for a cross to come down. One person calls for a highway
[20:46.640 --> 20:52.880]  to come down. The White House singled it out in its infrastructure plan as racists. And they're
[20:52.880 --> 20:57.440]  announcing the big giant highway that brings all the jobs to the neighborhood and people can get
[20:57.440 --> 21:04.560]  around the town will be destroyed. I mean, I shouldn't laugh at this. This is so evil, ladies
[21:04.560 --> 21:12.160]  and gentlemen. LA freeways are the most racist California monuments, LA times. In June of last
[21:12.160 --> 21:18.000]  year, they said get rid of the highways. Yeah. You couldn't destroy the state faster. Absolutely.
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.760]  Don't let people get anywhere or go anywhere. They want you locked in your neighborhood.
[21:21.760 --> 21:28.720]  That's the LA times. No money. No Biden infrastructure money for racist LA freeway
[21:28.720 --> 21:33.520]  expansion. And then it shows all the traffic. Yes, it's terrible if a highway comes through and
[21:33.520 --> 21:38.800]  tells you pays you double what it's worth for your house. Yes, do not expand anything shut down
[21:38.800 --> 21:45.600]  while China explodes. Look, at least racist pillars. Biden infrastructure plan tackles
[21:45.600 --> 21:55.040]  historic racial inequities. Racist Texas highway boondoggle dealt blow by booty plugs H, which
[21:55.040 --> 22:02.480]  should be booty judges FHWA. This is real news, folks. This is real news articles.
[22:02.480 --> 22:09.200]  Booty judge wants you to have to pay a tax by the mile on top of everything else. Again,
[22:09.200 --> 22:17.040]  but China doesn't do that. Everything to shut you down. Everything to destroy you. That's the
[22:17.040 --> 22:23.520]  name of the game. But don't worry, Biden is saving you. Here he is just 30 minutes ago,
[22:23.520 --> 22:29.920]  giving a speech from the White House. When we invest in the American people, it's not just those
[22:29.920 --> 22:36.080]  at the top that make our economy grow. They're the ones that make it grow. Ordinary Americans.
[22:36.080 --> 22:42.240]  We saw the economy gain traction in March as the American rescue plan moved and got passed,
[22:42.240 --> 22:48.080]  bringing new hope to our country. And we're going to continue to implement that law in the weeks
[22:48.080 --> 22:57.440]  ahead. By April 7, next week, over 130 million households will have gotten their $1,400 per
[22:57.440 --> 23:02.720]  person rescue check. All right, boss. Funds. How gracious. Oh my gosh, you lock them down,
[23:02.720 --> 23:06.480]  you bankrupt them, you have police horses, attack them, but all the big box scores are open,
[23:06.480 --> 23:11.120]  all the big techs are open. They all double, triple profits. But now you're going to get a check.
[23:12.480 --> 23:16.640]  You're all learning how to be slaves now. Like you're like a slave that I'm a hold of a ship
[23:16.640 --> 23:21.280]  and the slave master gives you an apple maybe once on the travel over so you don't die.
[23:21.280 --> 23:25.680]  Here's an apple. Here, let's go back. Local communities to put educators,
[23:25.680 --> 23:33.600]  health care workers, home health care aides, police, firefighters, sanitary workers back on the job.
[23:34.800 --> 23:40.560]  They're getting more aid for small businesses. We're also going to hang on open sign again on
[23:40.560 --> 23:48.000]  the door to rehire folks that had to be let go. And the months ahead, a new child care tax credit
[23:48.000 --> 23:53.680]  will cut taxes and provide help to millions of families with young children. There's nothing,
[23:53.680 --> 23:58.000]  nothing. I know you're tired of hearing me say this, but I mean, there's nothing the American
[23:58.000 --> 24:03.920]  people cannot do if we give them a chance. And the American Rescue Plan does precisely that
[24:04.560 --> 24:12.880]  for hardworking middle class folks at long last. Secondly, today's report also reflects the progress
[24:12.880 --> 24:18.960]  we've made on my other key priority, getting the American people vaccinated. We've turned around
[24:18.960 --> 24:25.600]  a slow moving vaccination program and to being the envy of the world. Yesterday, we set an
[24:25.600 --> 24:31.760]  all time record for Thursday vaccinations. And that's enough for this. I was going to shut it
[24:31.760 --> 24:37.200]  down. Thank you. He goes on and on to say, I'm saving you. I'm helping you. You're helping yourself.
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.040]  We're going to hang signs up saying you're reopened. Really, you've been bankrupt. You're
[24:41.040 --> 24:44.560]  gone. You've had to move from your town, maybe in with your parents, your parents have moved in
[24:44.560 --> 24:50.240]  with you. Maybe your kids have moved in with you. You lost that lease. You've got bad credit now,
[24:50.240 --> 24:55.760]  but it's okay. We're going to hang a sign back up. He's going to give you help. He's going to send
[24:55.760 --> 25:02.720]  you some money. China created more billionaires than all the billionaires combined last year.
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.840]  China took over the planet. China quadrupled its Belt and Road. First it had doubled it,
[25:07.840 --> 25:15.760]  but now it's highways and it's trains into Europe. We are in cardiac arrest. And all these idiots
[25:15.760 --> 25:20.880]  are virtue signaling wearing their little mask. And Biden's now petitioning the governors to never
[25:20.880 --> 25:26.240]  take the damn mask off because it's a symbol of the death shroud over our face forever.
[25:28.160 --> 25:31.120]  Tucker Carlson got to do it last night. Did a great job. We'll place some of that and we come
[25:31.120 --> 25:35.040]  back and I'm going to look at the infrastructure shutdown and what governors and states and we,
[25:35.040 --> 25:41.040]  the people, can do to say no to this. But the idea of we shut your economy down and now we're
[25:41.040 --> 25:46.160]  going to save you. And oh, we're going to get money down into your towns to get you reopened
[25:46.160 --> 25:50.160]  when none of it's designed to do that. And they know that it's killed people's habits of going
[25:50.160 --> 25:57.760]  out and it's fundamentally shifted the collapse of Main Street even faster. And they even admit
[25:57.760 --> 26:01.760]  Klaus Schwab and others. They did it all on purpose and brag how they did it and said now
[26:01.760 --> 26:07.280]  that the public submitted, the real bio weapons are coming to save the earth. I've got them quoting
[26:07.280 --> 26:11.680]  how it's going to be so good. How we're not going to have a bunch of people around anymore. And
[26:11.680 --> 26:16.720]  we're just here getting ready for this, reading where these psychos have projected all this out
[26:16.720 --> 26:22.560]  and have all these war games. And tomorrow, 3 p.m., I'm coming in to tape it before,
[26:22.560 --> 26:26.480]  add a bunch of documents, graphics, all of it. I'm going to show you the compending of this
[26:26.480 --> 26:30.800]  and new documents that are incredible, that are wargaming out what already happened,
[26:30.800 --> 26:35.520]  what's currently happening, and what's coming from John Hopkins. That is tomorrow. But they want
[26:35.520 --> 26:40.080]  to wage war on independent businesses, on small businesses, on independent media. It's a war on
[26:40.080 --> 26:44.240]  the people. It's a war on freedom because you can't have an America left when the rest of the world
[26:44.240 --> 26:48.160]  is under tyranny. And you can't have info wars on the air if you're going to sell this tyranny.
[26:48.160 --> 26:51.360]  You're going to gaslight people. That's why we got to keep info wars on the air.
[26:51.360 --> 27:03.840]  Look, I've proven that info wars information is some of the best in the world. It's just
[27:03.840 --> 27:08.640]  absolutely on target. The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate.
[27:08.640 --> 27:12.960]  They want to keep you in the dark. I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered
[27:12.960 --> 27:16.720]  because I know that John F Kennedy was right. Raising tide raises all ships.
[27:16.720 --> 27:24.160]  Now, the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have at infowarstore.com are

[27:58.960 --> 28:02.640]  Granny do right. Granny do right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[28:02.640 --> 28:08.240]  Yeah. And first of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the
[28:08.240 --> 28:13.200]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with
[28:13.200 --> 28:19.200]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[28:19.200 --> 28:24.320]  years, my skin is just really gorgeous. Actually, people think I'm 55 years old.
[28:25.520 --> 28:30.240]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what
[28:30.240 --> 28:34.880]  I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it,
[28:34.880 --> 28:40.240]  I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing,
[28:40.240 --> 28:44.640]  okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't
[28:45.600 --> 28:51.120]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore. You know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully and it
[28:51.120 --> 28:58.960]  really has totally cleared up my skin. Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers
[28:58.960 --> 29:05.760]  that promote free speech and freedom of association. And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost
[29:05.760 --> 29:10.160]  all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime
[29:10.160 --> 29:14.960]  racketeering. That's why they've been massively expanding their services. So whether you have
[29:14.960 --> 29:19.440]  domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other
[29:19.440 --> 29:25.760]  major service, they've got it all and they're expanding. And if you go to info wars domains.com
[29:25.760 --> 29:32.160]  and follow that link, you get all their services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up for
[29:32.160 --> 29:37.600]  a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war. And then we get 5% as well for any
[29:37.600 --> 29:43.120]  servers or any other type of services that you get from them. So it's a win win as we build a true
[29:43.120 --> 29:47.520]  open free internet again, because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[29:47.520 --> 29:58.720]  So info wars domains.com. The revolution starts there info wars domains.com. Take action now.
[30:17.760 --> 30:34.720]  We are living in such an incredibly historic time.
[30:36.320 --> 30:40.800]  The globalists call it the end of history. They call it the end of the human system.
[30:40.800 --> 30:50.080]  They call it the final revolution. That's based on dumbing humanity down,
[30:50.080 --> 30:54.800]  destroying our genetics and rendering us obsolete so that they the technocrats
[30:56.000 --> 30:59.760]  can rebuild humanity in their God's image.
[31:04.880 --> 31:09.520]  Why did Genghis Khan take over so many civilizations and kill so many millions of people because he
[31:09.520 --> 31:14.160]  wanted to dominate and control everybody? Why did Hitler do what he did? Why did Stalin do what he
[31:14.160 --> 31:19.440]  did? Why did Mao Zedong do what he did? Why did Lenin do what he did? Why did Julius Caesar do what
[31:19.440 --> 31:25.200]  he did? Well, he was protecting their frontiers. The Romans you could say in many cases were not
[31:25.200 --> 31:31.840]  as tyrannical as the modern tyrants, but they did still take over. But this is like the Romans
[31:31.840 --> 31:38.400]  taking over where they bring you civilization and technology and the aqueducts. This is a
[31:38.400 --> 31:45.120]  post-human anti-technology system that uses technology to enslave and domesticate and
[31:45.120 --> 31:51.280]  then finally annihilate humanity. It is the final revolution. And to watch the once free nations of
[31:51.280 --> 31:58.400]  Europe, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada dismantled in front of us and destroyed
[31:59.120 --> 32:04.800]  and the pipeline shut down and the roads being demolished and the dams being destroyed and
[32:04.800 --> 32:09.040]  the children's minds being annihilated and the open pedophilia and open satanism.
[32:11.280 --> 32:16.880]  This isn't just some economic weapon cooked up by Hollywood and the Chinese. This is what they
[32:16.880 --> 32:24.080]  like to do and they're doing it to us in an act of raw power and domination. And we sit here with
[32:24.080 --> 32:33.600]  our open free society model in a daze as it moves so quickly. Ten years ago we were going five miles
[32:33.600 --> 32:44.640]  an hour. Five years ago we were going 50 miles an hour. Three years ago we were going 100 miles
[32:44.640 --> 32:52.560]  an hour. Two years ago we were going 200 miles an hour. A year ago we were going 500 miles an hour
[32:53.280 --> 32:59.680]  and now we're going 10,000 miles an hour down the rattle and we're going to go a million miles
[32:59.680 --> 33:04.560]  an hour and two million miles an hour and a billion miles an hour right into hell, ladies and
[33:04.560 --> 33:10.720]  gentlemen. That's how tyranny works. It builds up, it gets its confidence going, people submit and
[33:10.720 --> 33:18.160]  like dominoes, boom, kills everybody. Then John Hopkins, I'll cover it tomorrow, has got it all
[33:18.160 --> 33:22.720]  laid out, how the collapse is going to work, how there are going to be so many brain damaged people
[33:22.720 --> 33:26.400]  from these vaccines that society will shut down and we're just going to have big mass
[33:26.400 --> 33:30.880]  reclamation centers right out of soil and green where we're just killing people around the clock.
[33:30.880 --> 33:34.720]  Young people, old people, you just sign the paperwork, roll your son in, your daughter in,
[33:34.720 --> 33:39.360]  your mama, your daddy, 20 years old, 30 years old, 60 years old because they could have just given
[33:39.360 --> 33:42.400]  them something that killed them right away, that'd be too obvious you'd fight back or something that
[33:42.400 --> 33:46.560]  kills you on the road but instantly when you finally die, no they want it to be something that
[33:46.560 --> 33:59.360]  wipes you out. They want it to be something that weighs on everyone. They want the sorrow and the
[33:59.360 --> 34:04.960]  pain and the breakdown and have the big medical system suck everything out of you, squeezing
[34:04.960 --> 34:13.840]  you dry before they blast you out of the dust. I'll show you the John Hopkins documents tomorrow
[34:13.840 --> 34:20.240]  and the Rockefeller Foundation documents tomorrow, 3 p.m. central because I'm not going to name this
[34:20.880 --> 34:28.480]  thing until we get to it and cover it properly but that's what all this is. Oh, the pipeline's evil.
[34:28.480 --> 34:34.160]  Oh, the highway's racist. Oh, math is racist. Remember that? Oh, two plus two equals wherever
[34:34.160 --> 34:39.520]  you want. Oh, the family's racist. Oh, yes, that's an evil white Christian thing. Oh, really?
[34:39.520 --> 34:46.480]  No institution can stand that isn't their institution and their institution's mission is
[34:46.480 --> 34:56.800]  your destruction, right out of hell. They have whole government programs that push that math
[34:56.800 --> 35:02.720]  is racist because it requires a right answer. That's right. They're even saying mathematics is
[35:02.720 --> 35:06.720]  inherently evil because they don't want the public to have reason. They want a bunch of
[35:06.720 --> 35:13.680]  superstitious, mindless, leftist idiots imagining racism everywhere when it's the globalist that
[35:13.680 --> 35:22.400]  are anti-human overall. And so we're all busy fighting with each other in the twilight of our
[35:22.400 --> 35:28.400]  existence with a bizarre death cult, exterminous cult in control but there's always that element
[35:28.400 --> 35:35.280]  of humanity that ends up during decadent cycles taking control and then engaging in a mass calling
[35:35.280 --> 35:40.240]  and you could say there's a group above them that use this group to bring
[35:42.000 --> 35:50.400]  pittance and to bring strength back to the body politic, a dialectic of destruction,
[35:51.200 --> 35:56.800]  a symphony of destruction and then rebirth. But that is not what this is. This is the final
[35:56.800 --> 36:02.800]  revolution. So here's Tucker Carlson for a few minutes talking about the racist highways and
[36:02.800 --> 36:11.520]  Biden's already listed. The North Houston, South Texas Highway Expansion Project almost done like
[36:11.520 --> 36:20.000]  the Keystone Pipeline. The big highways loop around New Orleans and it's actually in the news
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.920]  they go, look, the highway's above you. It's your black. It's above you. It's racist. Talking to
[36:25.920 --> 36:29.840]  you like they think you're pygmies or something. Well, if you take somebody's picture, it steals
[36:29.840 --> 36:35.840]  the soul. And yeah, we'll get rid of that highway and you'll be prosperous. Yes, yes.
[36:37.840 --> 36:42.960]  What foreign enemy could get us to do this? Well, the globalists, that's our foreign enemy.
[36:42.960 --> 36:50.640]  And here we are. And New York, he listed, Biden listed highways, got to be rid of the big loop
[36:50.640 --> 36:56.160]  in New York. I mean, you can't get on that loop and just drive where you want from a job. I mean,
[36:56.160 --> 37:00.400]  that's racist to have that freedom to travel and you got to all be packed in those subways.
[37:00.400 --> 37:05.280]  We can be gang raped or thrown in front of the tracks. It's so racist to have a car and be able
[37:05.280 --> 37:09.360]  to kind of do your own thing. You don't let slaves do that. I mean, you don't let them leave their
[37:09.360 --> 37:14.960]  house. They're under house arrest. AP said we need permanent house arrest two days ago. CNN said
[37:14.960 --> 37:20.320]  use the vaccine to control. We don't need all this freedom. They're the good guys. They're CNN.
[37:20.320 --> 37:26.480]  We need to be locked up in our houses. Yes. Cuomo said on CNN, if your 11 year old daughter
[37:26.480 --> 37:31.200]  doesn't like seeing a man's genitals in a shower, she's a bigot. Well, it's a gift for your 11 year
[37:31.200 --> 37:36.080]  old daughter to have the volleyball coach that says she's a female that's a biological male
[37:36.080 --> 37:40.000]  in the shower with your daughter, like Cuomo said. Here's part of Tucker talking about it.
[37:41.280 --> 37:48.000]  Flying cars, teleport machines, sadly not, but we are going to modernize those highways.
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.360]  And honestly, a lot of them could use it. But what does modernizing highways mean exactly?
[37:53.360 --> 37:57.360]  What are the details in that? Well, the Washington Post gave us some idea. According to the paper,
[37:57.360 --> 38:02.480]  an activist called Amy Stelly has been demanding the removal, not the building, the removal of a
[38:02.480 --> 38:06.400]  highway in New Orleans that cuts through her neighborhood. She thinks that highway called
[38:06.400 --> 38:12.480]  the Claiborne Expressway is bad. It's an eyesore and it contributes to pollution in her neighborhood.
[38:12.480 --> 38:16.400]  And for years, she's demanded that local leaders get rid of it, but they've refused. People use
[38:16.400 --> 38:20.720]  it. It's an important stretch of road in New Orleans. But now the White House and Joe Biden's
[38:20.720 --> 38:26.320]  infrastructure plan have decided that highway is an example of, quote, historic inequity.
[38:27.200 --> 38:30.000]  And that can be solved by billions of new spending. In other words,
[38:30.000 --> 38:36.160]  it's a racist highway. So you've got to pay to tear it down. Amy Stelly was enthused by this.
[38:36.160 --> 38:41.200]  I'm Florence, she said. I'm thrilled to hear President Biden call out the Claiborne Expressway
[38:41.200 --> 38:48.720]  as a racist highway. Yeah, a not just racist, sexist and transphobic too. That highway is a
[38:48.720 --> 38:52.880]  Jim Crow dog whistle for white supremacy, not to mention QAnon insurrections.
[38:53.920 --> 38:59.520]  Got to tear it down. Expect a lot more highways to meet that face. Fate. People who believe highways
[38:59.520 --> 39:02.960]  or racists are going to get tens of billions of dollars as part of this plan, as long as they're
[39:02.960 --> 39:07.920]  on what the Biden administration calls underserved communities. The entirety of this infrastructure
[39:07.920 --> 39:12.880]  plan looks more like a mashup of intersectional theory from Wesley and some kind of South African
[39:12.880 --> 39:17.760]  style spoil system. We saw a taste of that earlier this year when Joe Biden sent billions of dollars
[39:17.760 --> 39:23.040]  to African American farmers in this country purely because of how they look. Now that's illegal.
[39:23.040 --> 39:28.240]  It's immoral. It's completely divisive, but it's just the beginning. In his infrastructure bill,
[39:28.240 --> 39:33.840]  Joe Biden calls pretty strongly for sending 25 billion to historically black universities,
[39:33.840 --> 39:38.000]  another, quote, minority serving institutions for research and development. Now, you may think
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.200]  it's a good idea. You should have to explain why, but it's not infrastructure. He'd also like to
[39:43.200 --> 39:47.440]  eliminate, quote, it's all told or pandering while they want to kill you with the poison vaccines.
[39:47.440 --> 39:51.280]  We'll be right back on the side of the latest kind of information. I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[39:54.320 --> 40:00.160]  The equation is very simple. The mega banks control the media. They control big pharma.
[40:00.160 --> 40:06.800]  They control academia. They control the military industrial complex. They control big tech
[40:07.840 --> 40:13.440]  and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute
[40:13.440 --> 40:20.640]  total despotism and dehumanization. It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that
[40:20.640 --> 40:25.440]  ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[40:25.440 --> 40:31.840]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down and
[40:31.840 --> 40:39.120]  use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens
[40:39.120 --> 40:44.320]  their monopoly of control. That's why they target info wars because we understand the
[40:44.320 --> 40:49.280]  keys to defeating them. But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info
[40:49.280 --> 40:56.240]  wars, so we double your efforts. We're all in this together. In the early 1990s, it was a really
[40:56.240 --> 41:04.720]  funny movie that came out called Wayne's World. Even before I had an access to a show in the
[41:04.720 --> 41:10.800]  mid-1990s, I wouldn't call that movie and thought, man, that was fun. In fact, you speak out and have
[41:10.800 --> 41:15.200]  your own ideas and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real. Well,
[41:15.200 --> 41:22.000]  what do they say in Wayne's World? We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Every day when I cover these
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.320]  huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or so real,
[41:26.320 --> 41:29.760]  but I'm trying to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right and most of the time we do.
[41:29.760 --> 41:35.440]  The globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you. They enjoy destroying humanity.
[41:35.440 --> 41:41.040]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them. That for me is really
[41:41.040 --> 41:47.600]  set down and disgusting. So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole Info Wars crew that we
[41:47.600 --> 41:52.080]  will never join the globalists. We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're
[41:52.080 --> 42:00.000]  all in this together. I knew Trump was in battle. I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by
[42:00.640 --> 42:07.360]  double-talking agents of the enemy. And a lot of people just couldn't believe it. They're like,
[42:07.360 --> 42:12.640]  oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess. He's invincible. And I understand why people learn to believe that
[42:12.640 --> 42:16.400]  because this is scary what's going on with the global government and the New World War. And
[42:16.400 --> 42:19.440]  now that people hold up the fact that that's real, they want somebody to come save them from.
[42:20.080 --> 42:24.960]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried. My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled
[42:24.960 --> 42:29.440]  or quadrupled depending on the drug once Biden signed that executive order. We pay the most
[42:29.440 --> 42:33.760]  of anybody in the world. That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed,
[42:33.760 --> 42:38.640]  and now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything else. But
[42:38.640 --> 42:43.600]  what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking
[42:43.600 --> 42:48.480]  him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal
[42:48.480 --> 42:54.880]  activity because the fix is in, folks. The swamp is deep. Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[42:54.880 --> 42:59.920]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked about
[42:59.920 --> 43:03.760]  has happened just like we said it would. And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care
[43:03.760 --> 43:08.080]  about that. I care about beating the New World Order. And it's because we have so much credibility,
[43:08.080 --> 43:12.480]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer. And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff
[43:12.480 --> 43:16.960]  they're doing to us for a lot of reasons. I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[43:16.960 --> 43:21.840]  We're going to see this through the end. We're going to stay on air as long as we can. So please
[43:21.840 --> 43:26.000]  pray for us and please buy the products and then forwardstore.com. They're great products,
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.720]  plus they fund the operation. So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[43:30.720 --> 43:34.880]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom
[43:34.880 --> 43:40.000]  and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth. That's why the globalists
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.240]  are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[43:44.240 --> 43:47.440]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[43:47.440 --> 43:51.440]  Download everything we've done. You can find and save it because who knows how long we're going
[43:51.440 --> 43:56.720]  to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[43:57.920 --> 44:00.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:00.720 --> 44:20.480]  Welcome back to the dreaded Alex Jones show. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[44:23.120 --> 44:29.360]  Coming up, Hunter Biden, the fount of truth came out and said, basically, yeah, the laptop's me.
[44:29.360 --> 44:32.320]  In bed with my niece naked, smoke and crack.
[44:34.880 --> 44:40.960]  Chinese sex slaves. It's all me. And NPR has done a retraction. They said, okay, we said it wasn't
[44:40.960 --> 44:47.280]  real, even though Biden never denied it. Twitter, of course, restricted the New York Post and
[44:47.280 --> 44:52.640]  everybody else. It didn't matter. There were thousands of videos and thousands of emails
[44:52.640 --> 45:00.960]  and thousands of photos of him having sex with underage girls. He's Hunter Biden,
[45:00.960 --> 45:07.200]  the smartest guy the puppet president knows. But Matt Yates with no proof why he's got to be removed.
[45:08.800 --> 45:12.720]  While they're saying he might have given a 22-year-old girl $1,000 one time.
[45:15.680 --> 45:19.360]  And maybe she flew in a commercial flight with him. So that's sex trafficking.
[45:19.360 --> 45:24.320]  Of course, he's not only to express flying to Caribbean Island. And now we're learning it's
[45:24.320 --> 45:29.600]  not a 17-year-old girl, but it's okay. Because Tim Cook grows death camps.
[45:30.960 --> 45:35.360]  They're the moral media. They're going to get that Matt Yates. Matt Yates is something real.
[45:35.360 --> 45:38.320]  I'd throw him out of the bus. It's like that. But that's not what happened here.
[45:39.760 --> 45:45.200]  I've also gotten to experience them doing it to me. But of course, I said, go ahead, publish all
[45:45.200 --> 45:52.640]  your lies. And of course, they don't. But with Yates, they hate him so much that they went ahead
[45:52.640 --> 45:58.960]  and went with it because they believe they have dominance over the Internet so people can't respond.
[46:04.960 --> 46:11.040]  Coming up next hour, I'm going to play Hunter Biden on TV going, oh, yeah, that's probably my
[46:11.040 --> 46:18.400]  laptop, you know. Election's over. He stole the election. Now you can just kind of, all right,
[46:18.400 --> 46:25.520]  demystify it. Yeah, I like to, you know, get in bed with my niece. You know, she's 12 at the time.
[46:26.240 --> 46:32.560]  Yeah, you know, we posed our genitals out. It's no big deal. I mean, it's trendy. He's a Biden.
[46:33.440 --> 46:39.360]  He's the smartest man Joe Biden knows. So again, and if you talk about him, you're attacking his
[46:39.360 --> 46:43.680]  veteran other son that died bow. So don't do that. Remember, Trump talking about the laptop,
[46:43.680 --> 46:50.640]  you know, your son's laptop, shut up about my military son that died. Yeah, good argument.
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.280]  That's coming up. Oh, and they now tell us about the executive order.
[46:57.280 --> 47:00.560]  Big Reuters article, what he's going to do with the executive order, how he's going to get your
[47:00.560 --> 47:04.320]  guns, how he's going to swat team you. That's all coming up next hour. I mean, this is the
[47:04.320 --> 47:11.520]  biggest fault. We're just sitting here talking about it. And even Ted Cruz and other people like
[47:14.160 --> 47:19.040]  Senator Paul are still just all kind of calm. Like, yeah, well, you know, you might want to
[47:19.040 --> 47:25.360]  take the mask off. It's all theater. And yeah, the border's got a crisis. Instead of like, we're
[47:25.360 --> 47:30.640]  under UN, global government, attacking his populism, we're having our industry shut down.
[47:30.640 --> 47:35.600]  The opposite of what Trump did, we're under military corporate attack. We should be saying that
[47:35.600 --> 47:39.360]  instead they're purchasing the military, preparing them to go after anybody that's
[47:39.360 --> 47:42.880]  conservative. In fact, the latest manual as you know, came out on Monday.
[47:44.720 --> 47:48.960]  I never even covered it. You know, it came out five days ago that in the training manuals,
[47:48.960 --> 47:54.240]  they tell them, oh, it's not just the proud boys and the oathkeepers that are Nazis now.
[47:54.240 --> 47:58.880]  It's not just Alex Jones is a Nazi. It's not just Trump that's bad or make America great again,
[47:58.880 --> 48:06.160]  hatch any conservative partisanship. Oh, so you can't be like, I'm pro live, I'm pro gun, I'm pro
[48:06.160 --> 48:13.040]  America. Exactly. Yeah, the military said they hired a super SJW to run it, that you will basically
[48:13.040 --> 48:22.240]  not be conservative. Of course, that's how this works. Well, I'm for, I'm for banning the KKK
[48:22.240 --> 48:25.680]  speech because you know, they're bad people. Yeah, nobody listens to them. But once you let
[48:25.680 --> 48:32.800]  them ban their speech, baby, they banned everybody else's. Yeah, people ask, well, conservatives
[48:32.800 --> 48:38.160]  be listed as radicals. And this week, they said, indeed, here's the search engine new Pentagon
[48:38.160 --> 48:45.680]  anti racism training, no partisanship. So that's all coming up as well. Next hour.
[48:47.600 --> 48:50.960]  Let me do this. And then I'll hit the COVID news. And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the big news
[48:50.960 --> 48:56.080]  I'll be like tomorrow, just a prelude to that, a hors d'oeuvre, a opening shot, as they say,
[48:56.720 --> 49:04.960]  pun intended. God gave you everything you need to operate. Oxygen and water are essential. Food
[49:04.960 --> 49:08.160]  is essential because it has vitamins and minerals in it and trace elements. If you don't have it,
[49:08.160 --> 49:13.760]  you die. Everybody knows that cold starvation. Well, we're in a system with a lot of food,
[49:13.760 --> 49:17.520]  but a lot of it doesn't have real vitamins or real minerals or real amino acids. That's why I
[49:17.520 --> 49:23.840]  supplement other supplement. Vitamin mineral fusion, vitamin mineral fusion formula, a liquid,
[49:24.400 --> 49:29.680]  total multivitamin mineral with amino acids taste great. Great for children, old people, young
[49:29.680 --> 49:34.720]  people, much higher level of absorption because you drink it, saliva gets into it, that breaks it
[49:34.720 --> 49:39.200]  down further. So important, especially for older folks that have malabsorption issues in their
[49:39.200 --> 49:44.160]  guts. It is a best seller. We always sell out of it. We can't even keep it in stock. It's hard to
[49:44.160 --> 49:48.800]  get the organic ingredients, and so people say, well, just up the amount you order. Why is it
[49:48.800 --> 49:53.440]  always sold out? We can't. We got a very small order. And again, at current sales rates, it'll
[49:53.440 --> 49:57.760]  be sold out in the middle of next week. Despite that, I've got more to come in for a while. I've
[49:57.760 --> 50:03.040]  got it at 40% off. Vitamin mineral fusion, it's funding our operation. You need it. Take a scoop
[50:03.040 --> 50:06.640]  of it, two scoops of it, put it in a pitcher of water, stir it up, have it there for your wife,
[50:06.640 --> 50:09.840]  your husband, your kids. It's great for your employees. It makes a great gift as well.
[50:10.480 --> 50:13.200]  Don't just get people to tune into the show. Give them the gift of hell,
[50:13.200 --> 50:16.800]  say to your mom, your dad, your neighbor. Hey, why don't you take a liquid vitamin?
[50:16.800 --> 50:22.800]  It tastes great. Liquid mineral. Well, vitamin mineral fusion is there, and it is a best seller.
[50:22.800 --> 50:26.080]  People love it. It's way stronger than knockout. I'm not competing with knockout. They're two
[50:26.080 --> 50:30.160]  different formulas, but knockout has one milligram of melatonin. This has four, and it's the same
[50:30.160 --> 50:34.720]  with all the other ingredients. It's probably five times stronger than knockout. Knockout's strong.
[50:35.600 --> 50:40.480]  Down and out. The liquid's still available, but we have rocket rest. It's the powdered version,
[50:40.480 --> 50:45.120]  extremely strong. Some folks like powder better than they like liquid. It's the strongest one we've
[50:45.120 --> 50:50.720]  got, a total dosage, and it's got everything in it. Rocket rest, mac and stock at Dr. Jones

[51:29.040 --> 51:36.400]  order as well at infowarstore.com. Okay, I always tend to obsess over COVID because that's their big
[51:36.400 --> 51:42.160]  takeover, foot in the door, crowbar in the door, takeover system, like a mosquito
[51:42.160 --> 51:46.720]  comes and puts its proboscis into you and sucks your blood. I mean, that's the point of entry.
[51:46.720 --> 51:53.920]  That's how they're raping you, raping us. So, what I'll do is this. I want to get to the
[51:53.920 --> 51:58.000]  Hunter Biden news. I want to get to the gun grabbing news because that's important, and then I'm
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.520]  going to hit this warn detail, but here's some of the headlines for you. You can probably put the
[52:01.520 --> 52:07.200]  pieces together yourself. Paul Joseph Watson article, professor says COVID-19 will be like a fond
[52:07.200 --> 52:11.200]  caress in comparison to the next pandemic. And, of course, the professor is tied in with a globalist
[52:11.200 --> 52:14.800]  so he knows what he's talking about. Bill Gates is saying the same thing. This is all just a drill
[52:14.800 --> 52:18.720]  to lock you down before they hit you with the real weapon. So, I would get ready for that.
[52:19.920 --> 52:23.440]  CNN demands no freedoms. That's a quote for Americans without vaccination.
[52:24.720 --> 52:28.080]  Don't freak out, though, says CNN. Side effects like convulsing or
[52:28.080 --> 52:32.320]  bleeding and having ulcers all over your body are no big deal. So, enjoy.
[52:33.200 --> 52:36.880]  Death is a side effect, too. You should enjoy it. Professor says, again, though, that you're
[52:36.880 --> 52:41.360]  going to love the next one that's coming. They have a video of a woman knocked unconscious
[52:41.360 --> 52:47.600]  by a police horse during brutal lockdown in Brussels, Belgium. She saw April Fool's saying
[52:47.600 --> 52:53.280]  there'd be a party at the park, and so she went there. So, a giant Clydesdale ran her over
[52:53.280 --> 53:00.720]  and almost killed her. What heroes keeping everyone safe? Imagine if any other cop did
[53:00.720 --> 53:04.320]  that, but she's white, so it's okay, too. I mean, she's a white devil. It's white cops.
[53:04.880 --> 53:09.040]  And so, a giant horse just full, runs her over. She doesn't even know they're there,
[53:09.680 --> 53:13.120]  and those police need to be charged with attempted murder, but they won't because they work for
[53:13.120 --> 53:17.520]  the murdering globalists, totally locking us down, totally dominating us, putting us under
[53:17.520 --> 53:23.280]  permanent martial law until we accept a global, cashless world ID, social credit score run by
[53:23.280 --> 53:28.560]  China now officially announced. Just a total nightmare, maximum evil. The banks have bought
[53:28.560 --> 53:32.400]  off your leaders. We need a peaceful revolution against these people, but they're going to
[53:32.400 --> 53:37.120]  start a violent one first, with their guns, with their horses. And then any time the cops try to
[53:37.120 --> 53:43.040]  be good in the city and stand up, they activate the Black Lives Matter Soros Group to have white
[53:43.040 --> 53:48.880]  groups go out and start a race war and try to trick blacks into it. So yeah, show that footage
[53:48.880 --> 53:52.960]  again. The woman has no idea even what's behind her. She's not even looking at them, and they're
[53:52.960 --> 53:57.120]  like, well, they're told, believe me, they're told back at the police station, you go out,
[53:57.120 --> 54:02.480]  you dominate, you let folks know what's going on, and just boom, Clydesdale right over you.
[54:04.880 --> 54:10.640]  They're heroes protecting us from COVID, came out of the Wuhan lab, cooked up by Bill Gates
[54:10.640 --> 54:14.560]  and all of them. Boom, we'll show you, lady. They'll probably get a commendation, be saluted
[54:14.560 --> 54:18.320]  by the news, because if they can run over women, if they can kill children in front of you,
[54:18.320 --> 54:22.480]  they can do it all. How dare them come out and get signed? How dare them not stay in their houses?
[54:22.480 --> 54:27.360]  How dare them? How dare them not stay in there and die and learn how to be prisoners under these
[54:27.360 --> 54:34.720]  Nazi monster scum? Don't worry, they're getting rewards right now. She might die. Police will be
[54:34.720 --> 54:40.000]  saluted as good officers that told about of the Muslims. Yep, that's the traitors in Europe,
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.680]  sell their own countries out. The police are the enemy in Europe and in the U.K.

[55:44.880 --> 55:49.280]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker. Hey Alex, welcome.
[55:49.280 --> 55:54.400]  Would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[55:54.400 --> 55:59.280]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay? I'm a double amputee
[55:59.280 --> 56:05.920]  and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away. A living defense saved my life.
[56:05.920 --> 56:11.760]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back.
[56:11.760 --> 56:18.160]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew
[56:18.160 --> 56:26.000]  24 verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be
[56:26.000 --> 56:32.880]  hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
[56:32.880 --> 56:38.080]  and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at brother. And that's because God's name
[56:38.080 --> 56:42.320]  is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because
[56:42.320 --> 57:10.560]  God created this country. All right, I got so much coming up on their plan to take our guns.
[57:10.560 --> 57:15.280]  It's now official. You have announcements on what Biden's going to do coming up next segment.
[57:15.280 --> 57:20.480]  Hunter Biden admits the laptop was real. Oh, wow. Has it been to tell us that him
[57:20.480 --> 57:24.960]  in bed naked with his knees and all the rest of it. NPR and others have had new retractions.
[57:24.960 --> 57:30.160]  It's hilarious. That's coming up next segment. But here's part of Greg Reese's latest montage
[57:30.160 --> 57:36.640]  of reports from the border. They just got back yesterday. This is the criminal pipeline proving
[57:36.640 --> 57:41.200]  the massive felonies being committed by the O Biden administration. I hope you share it from
[57:41.200 --> 57:52.880]  man on video. The mainstream media has been talking about a surge at the border. But the real story
[57:52.880 --> 58:00.080]  is a massive illegal immigration pipeline run by the Biden administration. We witnessed it running
[58:00.080 --> 58:08.400]  nonstop in McAllen, Texas. First border patrol delivers busloads of illegal immigrants to a
[58:08.400 --> 58:16.800]  secured tent processing center on the corner of US business 83 and West 15th Street. We are told
[58:16.800 --> 58:23.840]  by sources well over a thousand each night in this area alone. And what we witnessed during the day
[58:23.840 --> 58:29.920]  certainly substantiates this number. We were told by a driver of their operation that they are
[58:29.920 --> 58:38.000]  being tested for covid 19 at this processing center. They all leave with manila envelopes in hand.
[58:38.960 --> 58:44.960]  Those that do test positive for covid are driven to one of the several hotels who have contracted
[58:44.960 --> 58:50.400]  with the federal government to act as covid quarantine shelters where they will quarantine
[58:50.400 --> 58:57.360]  for seven days before being released into the US. And the rest are either bust or walk down the
[58:57.360 --> 59:03.360]  street to the humanitarian respite center operated by Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley
[59:04.080 --> 59:08.320]  where they are brought in through the front door with their manila envelopes inspected.
[59:09.040 --> 59:15.760]  They are housed given bags of clothing and are then sent off through the back door to various
[59:15.760 --> 59:23.440]  US cities via bus and airplane. It's a nonstop flowing pipeline. Those that take the bus are
[59:23.440 --> 59:28.880]  led across the street to the bus station and the rest are given rides to the airport where they
[59:28.880 --> 59:35.120]  present border patrol and TSA with the paperwork inside their manila envelopes and set off to
[59:35.120 --> 59:42.640]  various US cities where they are either meeting up with some other government agency NGO or perhaps
[59:42.640 --> 59:49.120]  even Mexican cartels operating within the US. It is the biggest illegal immigration smuggling
[59:49.120 --> 59:55.600]  operation in US history and it is being run by the federal government on behalf of the United
[59:55.600 --> 1:00:01.440]  Nations to destroy all American liberties and put us under the boot for a thousand years.
[1:00:02.960 --> 1:00:05.200]  For Infowars.com this is Greg Rees.
[1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:14.720]  Well the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left
[1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:20.240]  doesn't like at least in government but there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor
[1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:26.400]  what you say and think and that's corporations. The left have wised up to this. If you want to stop
[1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:32.720]  someone from telling the truth use companies to do it. The social media giants and they are.
[1:00:32.720 --> 1:00:38.000]  For many on the left the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them prevent them from
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:41.840]  speaking. So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the
[1:00:41.840 --> 1:00:46.640]  radio show host Alex Jones. There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational
[1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:51.680]  corporations in Big Tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices. There's also
[1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:57.120]  guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying can you ban this person.
[1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:02.480]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist but this week Alex Jones' content
[1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:07.200]  will be a little harder to find. Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending
[1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:11.680]  the First Amendment but instead attack dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down
[1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:17.360]  independent free press working with Big Tech. People know what's true they can smell it.
[1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:25.120]  Infowars the most banned network in the world. In a free country everyone can be heard.
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:41.040]  Inter-Talitarian societies only the powerful can be heard.
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:56.960]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world. They are creating insecurity,
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:02.880]  crying, war and famine. All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready
[1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:08.160]  for ourselves and our family's sakes but also our community. And citizensstronghold.com

[1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:28.960]  Live from the Infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones and it's coming with the contact tracers.
[1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:36.400]  It's coming with the poison vaccine. It's coming with the death. Horsemen are drawing nearer.
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:45.600]  Leather steeds they ride. They come to take your life onto the dead of night.
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:57.360]  You see the four horsemen ride. So choose your fate. Choose which side you're on now. Choose wisely.
[1:03:57.360 --> 1:04:05.040]  You've been dying since the day you were born. You know it's all been planned.
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:11.680]  So stop letting them be in control. Choose a destiny. All right let's get into it right now.
[1:04:18.160 --> 1:04:21.120]  I do want to give the number out and get your take on
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:26.800]  all this information that we've been covering so far. Biden as they try to
[1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:32.080]  force the United States under water. Complete our bankruptcy. Complete the economic cultural
[1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:37.360]  conquering. Their own white papers admit they're doing this but then have him up there saying
[1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:42.880]  I'm rescuing you. I'm saving you. I love you. I mean what's the analogy?
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:50.240]  Eating a steak and saying I'm saving the cow. I'm loving the cow. I'm caressing the cow.
[1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:57.440]  Having cows come into a slaughterhouse while you butcher them and you tell them I love you.
[1:04:57.440 --> 1:05:03.360]  I love you. I love you while you slit their throats. I mean it's just insane.
[1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:09.520]  And then you look at the garbage that rules over us. The garbage that the
[1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:14.160]  Bidens and the Obamas and the Clintons and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and
[1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:22.320]  the Bill Gates of the world. These anti-human trash that literally suck the essence and life
[1:05:22.320 --> 1:05:27.440]  force out of our children and we just sit there and let them do it because they give us a virtue
[1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:32.880]  signal of a mask in a social distance to show how good we are like moron children
[1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:38.880]  following their nonsensical orders and they create a vaccine for the common cold which
[1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:42.320]  they've never been able to do because it doesn't work. Now they go it doesn't work. They'll have
[1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:49.120]  dozens of shots a year and never go out again and never have freedom. CNN, AP, Reuters all oh
[1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:54.480]  we're never going to leave again. We're obsolete. We need to die. The human age is over. Looking
[1:05:54.480 --> 1:06:02.160]  forward to the end of humanity. We need to stay on lockdown. It's so moral. And it's people writing
[1:06:02.160 --> 1:06:08.400]  for Reuters and AP and all this who are caught out partying at the beach who are caught not
[1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:13.840]  following all this. They're just paid to tell us to do it so their bosses will keep paying them.
[1:06:16.400 --> 1:06:21.200]  And that's really the most important point is everyone going along with this for money
[1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:27.520]  is what's empowering this because at the end the globalists will get submission. They will get their
[1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:36.560]  post-human world. They will get their takeover. So I've got a big stack of news right here. Let
[1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:43.600]  me hit this first then I'll hit the NPR stuff and Biden's laptop and the retractions and the rest of
[1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:48.640]  it where they have to admit now that oh the thousands of photos and videos of him in bed with
[1:06:48.640 --> 1:06:54.480]  his niece with the heart on that's real. You mean all the audio tapes of him going oh I work for
[1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:59.680]  Chinese intelligence and the head of Chinese intelligence the richest man in the world disappears
[1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:06.800]  yelling bomb a guy. And I don't know what to do. The southern district is investigating me and my
[1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:19.200]  daddy. My daddy. Man I've played that clip probably 50 times. It's a damn crackhead.
[1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:26.480]  They used to protect it and up there the laptop is fake. None of it's true.
[1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:35.440]  Why there's no Chinese intelligence running the bitons. He just said on CNN oh China can
[1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:41.840]  kill all the Uyghurs and he can take over Hong Kong and then Chinese troops are taken over.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:48.640]  Absolutely insane. But then we've got this that I want to take your calls on.
[1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:52.880]  The gun grab it's not gun control it's people control.
[1:07:52.880 --> 1:07:58.000]  They want to get their race for they want all their crown they want to break down society but
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:02.320]  they know we can organize with the governor or legislature and start taking states back and
[1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:08.560]  getting law and order back in place and then they'd have a problem. And so they're targeting
[1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:16.560]  all the patriot leaders and they're going after the guns and here it all is right here overhead
[1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:25.280]  shop place. Biden White House tries to craft gun executive orders that can't be undone. Reuters
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:32.080]  and the national post picked it up. There's a bunch of different variants of this Reuters article.
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:35.920]  You're just gonna say that some are like four pages long. Some are a page long. There's different
[1:08:35.920 --> 1:08:40.800]  variants. They put different newspapers but I've got a whole stack of them right here for you.
[1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:47.520]  And they say there oh we're just going to call gun parts guns and just arrest everybody that has
[1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:52.000]  gun parts and we're just going to prosecute all the gun shops. We're going to sue all the gun
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.400]  stores and say you can do that and the gun manufacturers and we're going to shut down all
[1:08:56.400 --> 1:09:04.240]  the gun shows and we're going to basically just wage war on everybody and put tens of
[1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:10.080]  billions of dollars more into the ATF and that's just the beginning. And we're not just going
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:17.520]  to ban the bump stocks. We're going to ban anything that's an accessory to it. You can read all this
[1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:22.880]  crap for yourself but basically it is a total assault of the Second Amendment and oh the most
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:30.240]  important part is they're calling it rulemaking. So the White House is telling AP oh we call it
[1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:35.520]  rulemaking so it's not a law. We're going to tell the ATF to basically interpret any gun parts as
[1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:40.960]  firearms and that they're illegal not just to sell but to have and then we're going to start
[1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:45.600]  swat teaming everybody. So start a civil war again whatever they can do to bring the country down
[1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:48.400]  get as many cops killed as possible. I mean that's what they're going to do.
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:55.280]  So Biden White House tries to craft gun control orders that can't be undone oh
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:00.720]  just like he didn't sign executive order because judges would overturn it to have an open border
[1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:05.600]  when no law has been passed. He can't supersede the law so he just doesn't have an executive order.
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:09.360]  He just opens them up and says surge the border and then orders the border patrol
[1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:17.280]  to help commit crime and help commit smuggling. So the total free number to join us is 877-789-2539
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:24.160]  877-789-2539 long-time callers first-time callers you agree and disagree. I don't care just have
[1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:32.720]  a good clean phone to be ready to talk to me 877-789-2539 877-789 Alex and if you are unable
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:40.480]  to call a toll free number some folks outside the country country code and 512-646-1776.
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:45.040]  All right let's continue. President Biden will sign executive order on gun control soon
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:51.360]  and again they say it's going to be basically outside of law it'll be regulatory
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:55.040]  they're going to make law via the agency and make them judge dread.
[1:10:56.960 --> 1:11:00.320]  So it's whatever they want. White House confirms Biden will sign gun control second
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:05.280]  of the borders very soon. They're coming for your guns. White House confirms Biden will
[1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:07.440]  sign gun control executive orders.
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:19.840]  NPR issues stunning Miocopo when we come back though after claiming Hunter Biden laptop story
[1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:27.280]  was discredited by intelligence that magic word like oh intelligence on HN says Trump's invincible

[1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:32.880]  take a journey to the bright midnight well i've definitely done that the black sunshine
[1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:37.440]  i'm rolling
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:41.440]  summer born
[1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:48.960]  others are born to the endless night
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:56.240]  but not everybody that can see darkness joins it
[1:15:56.240 --> 1:16:04.000]  end of the night all right let's go ahead and lay it out
[1:16:07.760 --> 1:16:10.720]  everyone knew the hunter biden laptop was real
[1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:20.160]  and the entire corporate media the entire big tech industry suppressed everybody from president
[1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:27.360]  trump to info wars to the president's family to the new york post everybody got suppressed
[1:16:28.240 --> 1:16:34.720]  and it was thousands of videos i went and looked at it and i was not comfortable looking at it
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:39.680]  because it was uh clearly underage girls and i told the crew i said i'm not asking any of you
[1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:44.160]  even under journalistic ads where we can look at stuff like that but i said i'm not asking anybody
[1:16:44.160 --> 1:16:48.000]  to look i told people i said the fact if you do it do it in your own stuff i don't i don't want to
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:53.920]  done here some folks did look at it it's him screwing little girls and stuff so i mean are they are
[1:16:53.920 --> 1:16:59.840]  they 18 i'm like they're about 14 and they said bevel his niece you know fuller you know showing
[1:16:59.840 --> 1:17:06.000]  off them naked it's trophy photos some covered sweat i mean it's i mean i did look at that and
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:11.120]  that was enough i said okay i'm not gonna stare at this dude with his 13 year old niece you know
[1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:16.080]  after they get done having sex i mean this is sick ladies and gentlemen and this is what the whole
[1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:22.400]  and then we got his sister's diary about you know joe joe banging the hell out of her i mean this is
[1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:28.720]  some horrible stuff ladies and gentlemen this is some really i mean that's who they are they're
[1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:33.680]  pedophiles of course they abuse their children and then they abuse their children most pedophiles
[1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:38.960]  were abused that's what the whole drag queen story time and all this is is they create more of their
[1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:44.400]  people and of course pedophilia is at the bottom of it because almost everybody that's quote in
[1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:53.600]  that lifestyle was abused the child and it's sick and so mpr has been forced to issue a stunning
[1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:59.280]  mea culpa after claiming hunter biden laptop story was discredited by intelligence the new
[1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:07.600]  york post reports and again these are just the placeholders of the cfr of the deep state of the
[1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:14.480]  chai comms they want a fully compromised daughtering joke pedophile can't keep his hands off kids in
[1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:20.880]  public totally exposed to demoralize us and just throw it in our face and then all the horrible
[1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:28.320]  stuff that happens will be blamed on joe biden and not the people behind him so i don't like joe
[1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:34.320]  biden i can't stand him but you know he's being set up and i can't help but just wish he'd wake up
[1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:39.520]  and stand up for the country because old-fashioned thugs would get control of something like america
[1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:44.320]  go why am i going to wreck this thing like somebody gave me the keys to a giant yacht you know i'm
[1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:50.400]  jealous of this yacht i think i'll run it up on the beach and burn it but that is these people's
[1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:54.320]  syndrome trumps like we're not going to wreck this damn thing we can take the whole world over
[1:18:54.320 --> 1:19:00.960]  promote freedom with this they're like no no no no no no no we can't have a freedom example
[1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:07.680]  to the rest of the world we don't want 1950 on steroids we want destruction we want venezuela
[1:19:07.680 --> 1:19:14.400]  on steroids we want north korea on steroids we want gg ping and communist china on steroids so
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:21.040]  here he is billions from barisma that go to all these different companies hundreds of millions
[1:19:21.040 --> 1:19:27.440]  to his dad his brothers his uncles all this happens he's a total cokehead kicked out of the navy
[1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:32.720]  and the media defends him knowing it's a real laptop and now because the system wants to keep
[1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:36.400]  pressure on the family to get whatever they want you know the chinese have got all the evidence
[1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:41.040]  but but what is hunter throwing goes you know the russians might have been involved in stealing my
[1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:49.040]  laptop though oh it might be my laptop but the ro the russians you mean you're on the damn thing
[1:19:49.040 --> 1:20:02.320]  recorded whining about how you work for chinese intelligence it's china took this country over
[1:20:02.320 --> 1:20:08.320]  buddy of the russians took it over like this i'd be absolutely at their throats they're just not
[1:20:08.320 --> 1:20:14.720]  that hungry they're not doing that but look at him look at that scarecrow look of him the smartest
[1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:21.760]  guy his dad knows you must not know a lot of smart people here he is was that your laptop for real i
[1:20:21.760 --> 1:20:25.520]  don't know i know but you know that this is i really don't know okay the answer is you don't
[1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:31.200]  know yes or no if the laptop i don't have any idea i had no idea it could have been yours of course
[1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:35.600]  certainly it there could be a laptop out there that was stolen from me there could be that i was
[1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:41.680]  hacked it could be that that was the that it was russian intelligence it could be that it was stolen
[1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:48.800]  from look at those eyes those are renfield eyes those are the eyes of a child that was raped
[1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:53.360]  those are the eyes of a soulless person those are the eyes of a slave now let's pull up brian
[1:20:53.360 --> 1:20:58.400]  stelter eyes please that's the opposite that's a predator and joe's got the predator eyes the
[1:20:58.400 --> 1:21:03.520]  hunter doesn't and of course hunter's been abused and that that the whole family got raped that's
[1:21:03.520 --> 1:21:10.560]  what they do they must hurt children and he's got that wide open stare of a trillion miles because
[1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:17.280]  he's gone folks all his innocence everything destroyed the synapses burnout he's fried and the
[1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:21.680]  sister inner inner inner diarrhea which they confirm is real she's like i was raped so bad i won't
[1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:25.680]  say by who probably my dad that i had to start taking drugs and getting drunk at a very young age
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:29.520]  because i just the things they did to me i can't talk about and the things they did to the rest of
[1:21:29.520 --> 1:21:38.000]  my family we can't talk about you know what those kids see they see a face looks just like that
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:46.160]  you're a two-year-old baby tied down at that black mass you're about to have your blood
[1:21:46.160 --> 1:21:52.800]  drunk for the next 12 hours till you die screaming for your mommy you see a face that looks just like
[1:21:52.800 --> 1:21:57.280]  that i'm not saying brian stelter kills babies i'm not saying as a child molester i'm saying if i
[1:21:57.280 --> 1:22:02.560]  was gonna cast for a movie for a devil worship or high priest that rapes and murders babies it'd
[1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:10.400]  be brian stelter he doesn't even know what he looks like does he he's ready to play penny wise

[1:22:19.200 --> 1:22:26.880]  speech our children our country our prosperity and everything else we ever were if our enemies
[1:22:26.880 --> 1:22:32.720]  were space aliens their ships landed out would come thousands of stelters that's what i would expect
[1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:38.560]  them to look like they're little spaces hopping off hungrily attacking us these are all allegories
[1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:45.840]  obviously brian stelter is inhabited by a very evil spirit you can see it boiling over
[1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:54.480]  a very weak spirit standard it's an infantry model of these creatures i've studied them too long
[1:22:54.480 --> 1:23:00.160]  that's the basic private model but he's still one of them all right when we come back ladies and

[1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:55.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:26:55.440 --> 1:27:02.320]  so
[1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:19.280]  well this is just breaking as we speak green shot at the us capital these are initial reports
[1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:25.360]  that came out minutes ago two officers reportedly shot and the shooter reportedly shot capital
[1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:32.480]  police suspects in custody you know we saw that car jacking as the man was tasered and
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:37.520]  smashed on his accelerator and crashed and the the mayor said that he deserved it because he
[1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:41.680]  should have had his car locked he was an uber driver picking up the women that the 15 and
[1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:48.160]  13 year old girls that killed him but again that was swept into the rug because it was black on
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:53.280]  asian if this happens to be a q and on person or somebody else or a white person you know they're
[1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:57.760]  going to call the greatest attacks is pearl harbor and i mean hell of actually two cops got shot
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:01.600]  that's more than happened at the whole capital insurrection they'll call this like end of the
[1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:06.080]  world total destruction but where our hearts do go out to everybody that's had a problem here
[1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:12.080]  including the officers we hope they're okay but building is now being locked down of course and
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:16.640]  they're all just panicking and just totally freaking out but meanwhile hundreds are shot every
[1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:23.360]  few days hundreds in in chicago in dallas in houston and no one even cares while all of that is
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:28.000]  going on so we'll continue to track this my point is they pick and choose what they want to tell us
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  this big deal like obama said a white supremacist misogynist attack the boulder facility the boulder
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:39.840]  grocery store when it came out it was an islamicist who loved obama hated trump and america it the
[1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:46.560]  story ended so if if if this is a gangbanger or something it'll all disappear if they can pin it
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:52.720]  if the guys got fox news on his browser uh or or they're connected to you know ever search my
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:56.960]  website even though my site's or you know our shows one of the top shows out there it's a it
[1:28:56.960 --> 1:29:01.440]  maybe you watch bill marb won't be bill marr's fault but it was me it'll be my fault even though
[1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:05.200]  we're calling for peace but but let's go ahead and play that footage where you go to your calls
[1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:10.160]  of that carjacking they don't want you to hear about because there's the military martial law
[1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:14.800]  and it didn't stop these young women from doing this so again the idea that troops on the streets
[1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:23.280]  protects you from crime is asinine i mean if i wanted to actually get guns in the military i could
[1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:27.920]  very very quickly with a ball peen hammer so actually having troops and armored vehicles
[1:29:27.920 --> 1:29:32.960]  and weapons around and you know caches of hang grenades actually makes it easier for an insurrection
[1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:37.520]  but that's real warfare let's not actually talk about real warfare or anything hey just follow
[1:29:37.520 --> 1:29:41.520]  the military home and get into weapons you want plus they're busy demonizing that very military
[1:29:41.520 --> 1:29:44.560]  because they know they're an outside globalist force but again they're the ones that want to
[1:29:44.560 --> 1:29:48.560]  get you ready for martial law while at the same time demonizing our military here it is
[1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:59.280]  uh
[1:30:11.920 --> 1:30:15.680]  she's still in their car horrible footage she shoots down the road for radio listeners
[1:30:15.680 --> 1:30:21.120]  crashes into a roll about seven miles down and it's thrown out and dead women crawl out call
[1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:26.000]  themselves victims the military begins worshiping them because they're black oh my god you're black
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:31.760]  worship you worship you worship you all you've been attacked by an asian oh my god
[1:30:33.200 --> 1:30:36.240]  and then they run down the street and again it's horrible footage he's dead
[1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:42.240]  and they're crying and victims we were just tasering him i mean come on come on man
[1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:44.320]  and there you go
[1:30:46.880 --> 1:30:48.640]  yeah go ahead and play the audio people will hear this
[1:30:53.280 --> 1:30:58.320]  the troops say i'm good give the women medals there he is dead well he's a man he deserves it
[1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:13.760]  so there's the martial law you don't hear about that because he doesn't have the narrative we're
[1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:17.280]  going to see what happens with this latest shooting two officers down because again one officer
[1:31:17.280 --> 1:31:21.920]  having a heart attack days later and dying was as big as pearl harbor as big as 9-11
[1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:26.640]  i mean just total total terror total evil hundreds of people walking between the velvet
[1:31:26.640 --> 1:31:31.280]  rubs being charged as you know terrorists and everything insurrection uh they've got
[1:31:31.280 --> 1:31:34.640]  literally thousands of people on twitter salivating calling for my rest
[1:31:36.240 --> 1:31:40.720]  hell they'll probably blame this on me i don't know it's funny slips on a banana pill it's my fault
[1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:48.880]  but here you go all right i want to go to your phone calls now we got steve we got frank we got
[1:31:48.880 --> 1:31:53.440]  michael we got bob we got carlos we got spencer we got mike we got perry we got zack we got cd we
[1:31:53.440 --> 1:32:02.000]  got lauren we're going to move quick through these calls let's talk to frank in new york frank thanks
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:06.640]  for calling hey alex how are you it's been three years since i haven't called you how you been
[1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:12.400]  man i'm just watching all of it come true man it's really freaking me out it is and unfortunately
[1:32:12.400 --> 1:32:17.520]  you see i'm Dominican just that and i've actually spoken to a lot of my community as far as what's
[1:32:17.520 --> 1:32:22.320]  going on with the open border situation i told them about if anybody gets in i'm telling you they're
[1:32:22.320 --> 1:32:26.320]  gonna open up the borders and not only that but i actually even showed them a document the club of
[1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:30.960]  rome you know when they want to buy the works of frank kingdoms that's part of open borders i show
[1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:35.840]  them the document they basically laughed at me say this is not true this is all conspiracy theory
[1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:40.880]  and to this day they say that they have to come because unfortunately in their countries they're
[1:32:40.880 --> 1:32:45.520]  suffering so there's no other place to go but i'm telling them that you know what's crazy about this
[1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:51.520]  is that the club of rome was the precursor to devos claus wab was trained by it they copy what the
[1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:57.120]  bible says but they say the bible isn't real three super regions ten kings of the earth all
[1:32:57.120 --> 1:33:01.920]  give their power to the antichrist in the official un plan they get rid of all the nation states and
[1:33:01.920 --> 1:33:07.520]  then create ten kingdoms smashing countries together but then having little subregions
[1:33:07.520 --> 1:33:11.040]  throughout them everybody divided and conquered i mean it is quite the plan
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:17.600]  do you think about the un un was created because of the of the club of rome basically to to give
[1:33:17.600 --> 1:33:22.080]  the antichrist his power that's what the un was created but besides the point is that i'm just fed
[1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:26.240]  up with with my Hispanic community unfortunately they've been watching too much delinoso univision
[1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:31.200]  it's the equivalent of cnn and msnbc the same propaganda garbage that you hear on those channels
[1:33:31.200 --> 1:33:35.440]  it's very frustrating i like i'm telling you my wife well brother just keep warning them and listen
[1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:40.240]  tell people don't take the vaccine when they get really really sick they're going to believe you

[1:33:44.640 --> 1:33:48.560]  vaccine i talked to crew members here that had family that took it almost killed them
[1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:53.760]  i talked to the nanny i know one of her friends almost died he's been in bed for six days he might

[1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:47.600]  let's go ahead and talk to spencer in louisiana obama excuse me oh biden says he's coming for
[1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:52.640]  the guns what do you think i think that would be the worst decision he could ever make in his whole
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:56.160]  four years or two years or however long he lived through his term
[1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:00.160]  but what do you make of all this they're certainly making their move
[1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:07.120]  well i live in louisiana i live in louisiana for 30 years and one of the first things they teach you
[1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:14.000]  as a child is gun safety and i owned guns and i've never shot anyone never thought about it
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:19.200]  and i could tell you this i know a lot of people you come for their guns that's when the next civil
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:23.440]  war starts they will die with that gun in their hands no but do you understand what i'm saying
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:27.760]  brother is they want to trigger it against the local police who they're gonna have go take the guns
[1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:32.560]  the chinese want the civil war i agree we can't turn them in but we've got to educate the police
[1:35:32.560 --> 1:35:37.200]  and military not to be part of this and we've got to try to not get this civil war started you
[1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:42.560]  know we know that's 1776 started when the british came to take the guns yeah i don't i don't want
[1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:45.840]  it to happen either i mean i don't i don't want anyone to die well how do we thread the needle
[1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:51.680]  then i mean we need to be exposing the rockefellers the rothschilds bill gates we need to be exposing
[1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:57.680]  who's behind all this we need to be exposing soros right i mean we need to be exposing the
[1:35:57.680 --> 1:36:02.640]  fact that they're doing this on purpose and that that's why i share your links i tell everyone

[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:39.680]  then steven everybody else we're taking your calls in about 15 minutes drew her nandes is
[1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:43.680]  visiting us here in austin great reporter he's about to go down to the border he'll be back in
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:50.480]  studio with us coming up 15 minutes the next hour stay with us the equation is very simple
[1:36:50.480 --> 1:36:58.240]  the mega banks control the media they control big pharma they control academia they control
[1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:04.320]  the military industrial complex they control big tech and everywhere that they have been in control
[1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:11.840]  in the third world they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it is the
[1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:17.680]  western christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights
[1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:22.160]  and so much more that actually threatens them so because they can't defeat that empowering
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:29.840]  ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy
[1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:36.160]  human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly some control that's why they
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:41.440]  target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them but the only way our transmission
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:46.960]  gets out is if you promote info wars and they have that video so we double your efforts we're all in
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:54.160]  this together as negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be you have to
[1:37:54.160 --> 1:38:03.360]  understand that this is all a test this experience this life on this planet is a reckoning it's god
[1:38:04.240 --> 1:38:08.960]  giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:15.200]  eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come down to that so as sad as things
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:19.520]  are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the world as well and realize that god
[1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:25.840]  is the author of our consciousness god is the author of us having our own will god is the
[1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:32.480]  author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing when you look at mainstream
[1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:38.640]  media in hollywood and this whole evil culture in washington dc and fauci and the and the mass cult
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:42.720]  it's all about dominating your free will it's all about telling you you're dirty you're ugly
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:47.360]  you're in bed because satan hates you because you're made in the image of god the creator of the

[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:20.400]  russia's foreign minister labroth has gone public saying that there is a communist chinese cultural
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:24.880]  revolution taking place in the u.s and they want to bring down the u.s using a race war in the whole
[1:41:24.880 --> 1:41:29.520]  world's in grave danger that's what putin's former chief of staff also said a month ago
[1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:35.520]  but labroth is like right up there number two got a putin his most trusted advisor and of course
[1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:40.080]  he's saying what's really going on he goes on to basically explain as a soros chi-com attack on

[1:41:50.080 --> 1:41:56.640]  the u.s links up with russia geopolitically it's over those two countries could dominate the world
[1:41:56.640 --> 1:42:03.200]  for good and a new golden age but alas we know that's not how it works right anybody can read
[1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:09.280]  revelation the dragon the whole war that happens we all know it unfolds so uh the truth is is that
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:14.240]  we're going to be laying this out after i take some more phone calls ahead of a special guest
[1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:20.160]  Hernandez was on fire yesterday so i'm gonna get him back in studio with us uh but right now let's go
[1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:26.800]  to carlos in canada carlos welcome to the airways go ahead thank you alex your comments on labroth
[1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:34.080]  are very relevant and timely um actually as a matter of fact if you remember um president trump
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:38.880]  was once friendly to where it's up wouldn't talk to him about 20 minutes and i got him a lot of
[1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:45.600]  trouble and i always thought wait a second you know why why why the opposition imagine if there
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:51.920]  would have been a a bridge link between alaska and russia you would have been able to connect
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:58.080]  four continents do you realize that four that would make the chinese belt and road look like a
[1:42:58.080 --> 1:43:04.960]  sandbox and that would make america and american companies that were led by real people but they
[1:43:04.960 --> 1:43:10.320]  don't want the investment in russia and so or america so that's why no that's right the other
[1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:18.640]  thing i want to mention to you that uh relating to the virus three years ago okay the police wanted
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:25.040]  to have the authority to take dna from prisoners some felons so that they were able to keep a
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:30.480]  record and make a database you look at the newspapers oh could we have perfect point i
[1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:35.200]  thought that this morning the police can't have a database of our phones where we go and they shouldn't
[1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:42.960]  but communist china is officially going to run the world un uh vaccine passport system this is insane
[1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:50.720]  well now every time somebody has these q-tips put up their nose or other parts of their body
[1:43:50.720 --> 1:43:57.280]  they're getting the dna sample which is creating a worldwide database for the kind of research
[1:43:57.280 --> 1:44:02.240]  that they need to selectively eliminate and which we know we know ancestry and the other
[1:44:02.240 --> 1:44:07.280]  big companies have been caught their real job is actually getting a dna sample they wanted to
[1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:12.160]  get in directly what they couldn't get directly and the other thing that i wanted to mention to you
[1:44:12.160 --> 1:44:17.440]  is that they've been taking samples from the microbiome on the rear end of the human being
[1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:24.640]  okay there's no point in looking for viruses there okay that's for another another kind of
[1:44:24.640 --> 1:44:29.680]  of bacterial if you want to call it or i know you're a smart scientist so let's just say we call
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:34.080]  a long time people don't know let me ask you this carlos you got a few minutes here what are you
[1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:37.840]  obviously i'm going to cover this john hopkins document tomorrow that admits we're in a simulation
[1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:42.320]  takeover the vaccines are going to make a lot of people sick it's a society collapsing weapon it's so
[1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:47.040]  incredible what is their big in game why are they so savage why are they moving ahead with
[1:44:47.040 --> 1:44:52.880]  something so incredibly dangerous and committing these giant mass crimes because what the people
[1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:59.840]  don't realize and this is good friday to think about it this is an anti-christian worldwide movement
[1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:06.400]  it is led by individuals who are not christians or exactly the u.s is taking more vaccines than
[1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:10.880]  anybody else and predominantly it's christian countries being hit by this you're exactly right
[1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:18.240]  correct and it's the principle of the principles of jesus of nazareth those principles that say
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:25.200]  clearly listen you have a spiritual life give to god what belongs to god live in your spirit that is
[1:45:25.200 --> 1:45:30.880]  your way to eternity meanwhile these people are materialism people these are people that worship
[1:45:30.880 --> 1:45:36.560]  money these are the anti christ some people go galactic and say that they're martians i don't
[1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:42.080]  think so these are human beings who are simply living under a different philosophy that started
[1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:49.040]  in 1733 alex we know about that it was a call of the 12 people the 12 bankers that decided
[1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:55.280]  that they with their 13 member who call a meeting to order in 1733 that they were going to do away
[1:45:55.280 --> 1:46:01.040]  with empire they were going to do away with christian religion and they created an inversion
[1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:06.960]  the opposite of god was satan and the opposite of uh jesus was the anti christ and the opposite
[1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:13.360]  of the holy spirit was surveillance and when these two if you want to call it triangles
[1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:18.560]  superimposed on the other and an inversion that's when these people found their 666 and that's where
[1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:24.640]  they went on to destroy the world well i know this it's it's definitely an ancient battle
[1:46:24.640 --> 1:46:29.840]  with different permutations and manifestations of it but uh there are definitely groups and
[1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:33.840]  organizations believe they have a right to rule everybody and they are definitely engaging in
[1:46:33.840 --> 1:46:41.280]  extreme evil um how would you call this football game right now i mean how many quarters are we in
[1:46:41.280 --> 1:46:49.120]  how's the game going uh president trump was a godsend because he was an american naïve enough
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:56.080]  not to even to trust his son-in-law believer or not okay poor man all right he he probably has
[1:46:56.080 --> 1:47:02.720]  time not to reflect on what was really done to him okay but but he was an innocent american patriot
[1:47:02.720 --> 1:47:08.400]  the kind of the kind the most dangerous individual for anyone because he's american patriot and my
[1:47:08.400 --> 1:47:13.680]  advice to him and what i call this period of time is the reset the reset was to undo everything
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:19.040]  that trump did because he with one word he could take all those christians you know these people
[1:47:19.040 --> 1:47:24.480]  are coming from latin america they're bringing in the border think about it they're mostly catholic
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:29.360]  they're mostly uh latin americans that's right the whole system attacks christianity because
[1:47:29.360 --> 1:47:33.920]  whether you believe it's real or not and i know it is it is a unifying force that will challenge
[1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:39.360]  the antichrist system that's post-human and god's system is pro-human the devil system is anti-human
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:46.160]  look out for the antichrist all right because that's who's really behind this think about it
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:51.520]  these people who are trying to make these moves look at them clearly they are they rule by the
[1:47:51.520 --> 1:47:56.720]  and the antichrist has two two dimensions with christians don't have alex one is is that they're
[1:47:56.720 --> 1:48:00.880]  they think of themselves as better than you so they can subvert you well they have a distinct
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:09.680]  they enjoy hurting people go ahead carls i mean i'm saying you're right they enjoy hurting people
[1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:15.520]  continue they're exceptional and they are above the law so they think that you're inferior and
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:20.800]  they're superior christians don't think like that they don't they shouldn't they have been taught to
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:26.400]  to equal everybody okay the other the other element is that they think that they're exceptional
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:30.720]  when you hear the word exceptional think about it that's not christian that's anti christ
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:36.320]  and when you hear the word you know i'm better than you or i'm supreme or i'm chosen or whatever
[1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:41.920]  word they use okay because these people who are easiest talk like that run away from them
[1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:45.440]  because those people don't have your best interests are hard exactly they create an
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:49.760]  inversion it's quote fighting racism and all this when they actually create it all and make it
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:54.720]  about what color you are instead of your soul and what you stand for it is just openly satanic
[1:48:54.720 --> 1:49:02.480]  and if you recognize that it's the moment to say are you christian do you believe in jesus
[1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:09.280]  of nazareth you believe in eternal life uh if you're muslim the muslims accept jesus of nazareth
[1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:15.360]  as a as a as a as a prophet they they are they accept the virgin as his mother they have no
[1:49:15.360 --> 1:49:22.000]  objection to jesus of nazareth okay but whoever objects to jesus is an anti christ think about it
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:27.440]  well by very definition i appreciate your call and in folks i'm here to tell you
[1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:32.080]  you've been taught by these atheists that oh it's all bs and a fool believes in the spiritual realm
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:39.760]  the globalists are all luciferians and satanists under them i've been around them i know okay
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:48.480]  and you see it all around you now but it's satanism period but you've got the mansion you've got the
[1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:54.000]  car you have sex the beautiful woman but it's empty it's like the cheesy movie um pirates of caribbean
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:59.120]  where the pirates drink the wine but it just goes through them they eat the food they have the sex
[1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:05.520]  but none of it's good it's it's bad man it's bad it's real too and and these people are like mummies
[1:50:06.080 --> 1:50:12.080]  and that's why joe biden is their leader he looks like a damn dead body that they dug up in egypt
[1:50:12.080 --> 1:50:18.240]  or something that's dried out been dead for 5000 years because man he is a manifestation of death
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:25.520]  they could have put some leader in there they wanted you to feel bad they wanted you to see this
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:32.320]  for yourself they want to they want to have you just absolutely feel weak and and and but don't
[1:50:32.320 --> 1:50:37.680]  don't do that what did trump do you're great you're amazing we're gonna do great what do they say
[1:50:37.680 --> 1:50:42.400]  oh we suck we're horrible highways are racist better be a little black kid highways are white

[1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:46.960]  hey Alex welcome would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason
[1:52:46.960 --> 1:52:50.960]  and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold of you
[1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:57.920]  for a year okay i'm a double amputee and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go
[1:52:57.920 --> 1:53:04.400]  away uh living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me
[1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:10.560]  living defense brought me back i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where
[1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:17.760]  we are right now this is Matthew 24 verse nine then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:24.640]  and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many
[1:53:24.640 --> 1:53:30.480]  be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother
[1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:35.280]  and that's because god's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's
[1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:48.960]  why the enemy hates it because god created this country you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:48.960 --> 1:53:50.960]  you
[1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:08.080]  steven in pennsylvania thank you for calling you're on the alex jones show welcome
[1:54:08.880 --> 1:54:17.200]  hey alex um let's let's put some evidence on the table um they're trying to get us to commit
[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:23.360]  spiritual adultery by breaking our covenant with the lord and contracting with them now you have
[1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:29.760]  brought up uh trump's inauguration speech and i look at it as an offer because he says that
[1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:40.640]  he's giving back the power to the people and january 6 to me is uh acceptance uh that property
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:48.800]  was originally named roam maryland and that was the year of jubilee at his inauguration address
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:56.240]  as per uh johnson con but the issue is the mistake that we're making is it's crucial to
[1:54:56.240 --> 1:55:02.640]  rebut their presumption they're presuming we're property of congress now there's either an article
[1:55:02.640 --> 1:55:09.520]  four section four uh constitutional republic guaranteed borders etc or we're in article
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:16.160]  four section uh article four that's right the social contract has been broken this is a foreign
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:20.720]  government and trump said it's your country if you want it take it back we're transferring the
[1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:26.320]  power back to you he had to have and yes january six overall was peaceful and that's what scared
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:32.560]  them so bad it was a partial exercise of our freedom a partial exercise in the middle of them
[1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:37.200]  still in the election from us and that's what upset them so much and i agree with you yeah but
[1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:44.320]  the issue is is that they're de facto congress creating the birth certificate and the whole
[1:55:44.320 --> 1:55:51.520]  stealing of the um stealing of our our our sweat equity the 14th amendment you discussed all that
[1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:57.360]  with adam had asked that it was one of the most important interviews that you've ever done now the
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:06.160]  issue is uh um you know we have some really big uh issues that trump owns the original post office
[1:56:06.160 --> 1:56:15.040]  and it's been brought out that the wars are between post office and um um you know this whole thing
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:23.040]  is about the legal fictions of uh that congress created to our birth certificate that we're
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:31.360]  representing that all caps name so so like you said over and over we're operating under color
[1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:41.200]  of law color of law and until and unless we uh refute their presumptions and stop representing
[1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:48.080]  that all caps name now you can you can find an explanation of that uh at adavon rents uh article
[1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:53.280]  number 73 she really really gets into it and sent notices beautiful brother gotta jump your
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:58.000]  buddy in but thank you steven all right let's talk to zack in florida go ahead zack
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:05.360]  alex what's going on brother i'm happy to talk to you go ahead i've been listening to you since
[1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:10.080]  i was in middle school and you've helped me wake up just about every employee that i have working
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:15.520]  with me and i also every one of my family their links and videos they literally have made a complete
[1:57:15.520 --> 1:57:19.760]  change throughout coronavirus and woke up to everything that is you've really been talking
[1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:24.560]  about for years but i just wanted to give a quick experience a quick layout of my experience with
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:30.800]  covid um i lost my job twice i lost two different jobs in the last year because of covid i now have
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:37.760]  another one um my mom lost her job i had to move back in with my parents across state had to go
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:42.800]  through all this and i just wanted to lay out a message for young people to say even if you lose
[1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:48.960]  your job or they're trying to lock you in your house or whatever it is we are still young and we
[1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:54.800]  have all of the energy all of the power against this old decrepit system that will not tie us down
[1:57:54.800 --> 1:58:00.240]  the future and we will overcome this 100 percent hold on i'm gonna hold you over result your message
[1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:04.880]  to be heard by by by the next segment because some states don't care this first five minutes
[1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:10.240]  they wanted to moralize us they want to break our will they want to straightjack us
[1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:15.680]  into this global id to be able to buy and sell it businesses and and china's gonna run it so

[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:55.920]  done now let's take action together and take down the globalist news analysis reports it's the alex
[1:59:55.920 --> 2:00:10.400]  jones show the mainstream media has been talking about a surge at the border but the real story
[2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:17.600]  is a massive illegal immigration pipeline run by the biden administration we witnessed it running
[2:00:17.600 --> 2:00:25.920]  non-stop in mcallin texas first border patrol delivers bus loads of illegal immigrants to a
[2:00:25.920 --> 2:00:34.480]  secured tent processing center on the corner of us business 83 and west 15th street we are told by
[2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:41.360]  sources well over a thousand each night in this area alone and what we witnessed during the day
[2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:47.440]  certainly substantiates this number we were told by a driver of their operation that they are
[2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:55.120]  being tested for co vid 19 at this processing center they all leave with manila envelopes in
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:01:01.840]  hand those that do test positive for co vid are driven to one of the several hotels who have
[2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:07.920]  contracted with the federal government to act as co vid quarantine shelters where they will quarantine
[2:01:07.920 --> 2:01:14.800]  for seven days before being released into the us and the rest are either bust or walk down the
[2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:20.800]  street to the humanitarian respite center operated by catholic charities of the real grand valley
[2:01:21.520 --> 2:01:25.760]  where they are brought in through the front door with their manila envelopes inspected
[2:01:26.480 --> 2:01:33.200]  they are housed given bags of clothing and are then sent off through the back door to various
[2:01:33.200 --> 2:01:40.880]  us cities via bus and airplane it's a non-stop flowing pipeline those that take the bus are
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:46.160]  led across the street to the bus station and the rest are given rides to the airport where
[2:01:46.160 --> 2:01:51.920]  they present border patrol and tsa with the paperwork inside their manila envelopes and
[2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:57.200]  set off to various us cities where they are either meeting up with some other government agency
[2:01:57.920 --> 2:02:06.080]  angio or perhaps even mexican cartels operating within the us it is the biggest illegal immigration
[2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:12.640]  smuggling operation in us history and it is being run by the federal government on behalf of the
[2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:18.880]  united nations to destroy all american liberties and put us under the boot for a thousand years
[2:02:20.400 --> 2:02:22.640]  for info wars dot com this is greg rees
[2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:32.640]  that is just a two and a half minute out of this world powerful video report of your radio
[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:38.720]  listener it's a band on video click the left hand corner the three lines it opens up all the pages
[2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:45.680]  you find the greg rees section also the southern border crisis section and it has 200 and something
[2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:55.200]  thousand views i mean come on folks that needs 20 million views i got text messages from well-known
[2:02:55.200 --> 2:02:59.280]  people in government and other areas like oh this is a great report i'm like
[2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:06.960]  then promote it take our bug off just get it out but no and i and i understand it you know you can't
[2:03:07.840 --> 2:03:13.120]  it's like the big secret oh this is a hot show and everybody tunes in and but but but you can't
[2:03:13.120 --> 2:03:17.600]  promote it oh no you're getting trouble that's why they're always banning another person and they
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:22.480]  wait and ban somebody else so everybody behaves themselves keeps their heads down and now steven
[2:03:22.480 --> 2:03:27.920]  crowder's being basically banned off youtube and they're going to move on to the next person
[2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:34.960]  after that the next person instead of us banding together and saying no but zack called in i he got
[2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:38.960]  cut off by a break some stations might not have heard him he was on that first five minutes you
[2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:44.480]  were giving out a positive message that don't let him demoralize this bankrupting our jobs don't let
[2:03:44.480 --> 2:03:48.640]  him make you feel not essential don't feel bad just because they've shut you down they're at war
[2:03:48.640 --> 2:03:54.160]  with you because of who your ancestors are your christian ethos and we must come together and support
[2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:59.760]  the farmers market and support the local farmers and support the local metal urges and support the
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:07.280]  local schools it now more than ever and all of us are hypocrites i need to do it more myself but i tell
[2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:13.520]  you they have gone through our computer systems and they have found everything we use to broadcast
[2:04:15.360 --> 2:04:20.560]  in every week or so some new thing that we you know we had to operate of the thousands of pieces
[2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:24.960]  of technology gets taken away but now most the time we've already moved away from everybody
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:29.520]  before it even happens we'll have the mainline thing as a backup they go oh because of who you
[2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:34.800]  are we're taking that away just happened this week we went oh really watch this flipped it our own
[2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:43.680]  thing on and now we're not going to give them money so yeah dc's right that which doesn't kill
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:49.200]  you only makes you stronger if you decide to push back and get stronger if you decide to be the victim
[2:04:49.200 --> 2:04:53.760]  and oh look what happened to you and everything then you're going to lose your body shuts down
[2:04:54.880 --> 2:05:00.560]  but when you say god i need help i want to be good and i want to be strong and i want you
[2:05:00.560 --> 2:05:06.560]  to rise me up man god listens but god doesn't like cowards and god doesn't like victims
[2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:12.240]  sure we all get victimized bad things have been done to us all but you know i'll tell you i'm not
[2:05:12.240 --> 2:05:16.560]  a masochist i don't like pain i like pleasure i like to give it to but i'll tell you something right
[2:05:16.560 --> 2:05:22.400]  now all the things that were done to me when i was growing up i never blamed god but now i appreciate it
[2:05:23.200 --> 2:05:26.960]  because i wouldn't be who i was today if i hadn't been the things done to me and i've had horrible
[2:05:26.960 --> 2:05:32.480]  things done to me horrible things i look back on it was the best thing ever every damn piece of that
[2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:40.720]  pain was so good because now i can take a lot more pain i couldn't do this if i hadn't been put
[2:05:40.720 --> 2:05:47.040]  to the fire like a sword that the samurais are hammering together and stretching it and that steel
[2:05:47.040 --> 2:05:53.360]  for months and years is bashing it and banging it out at the end of the day i'm certainly worse
[2:05:53.360 --> 2:05:58.000]  for wear and my eyes point different directions sometimes but it doesn't matter because i'm still
[2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:03.680]  rolling forward like a big battering ram on fire to take down the enemy and i just appreciate you
[2:06:03.680 --> 2:06:08.080]  all keep me in the fight let's go to zack zack finish up your point restate what you were saying i
[2:06:08.080 --> 2:06:13.200]  appreciate you holding about not letting them get our spirits down yeah man so i was just
[2:06:13.200 --> 2:06:19.680]  uh laying out my experience um throughout this whole thing as a 22 year old surfer from florida
[2:06:20.320 --> 2:06:25.120]  uh i completely make every dollar that i have and support myself until uh
[2:06:25.760 --> 2:06:30.640]  corona came i lost my job twice and you know whatever but my message really is just
[2:06:31.520 --> 2:06:35.440]  for all young people and especially young people but everyone is just
[2:06:35.440 --> 2:06:43.440]  just say no to the system and say yes to life and reality say yes to going outside in real
[2:06:43.440 --> 2:06:50.800]  community say no to twitter and vaccine say yes to organic food and investing in yourself and
[2:06:50.800 --> 2:06:57.920]  making good decisions away from all the media away from any influences negative because imagine me
[2:06:57.920 --> 2:07:02.000]  in europe where they ride women down with clivesdale horses that try to get sun
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:09.360]  and imagine here i couldn't i me and my family couldn't go to church i couldn't go to work
[2:07:09.360 --> 2:07:14.640]  but there's people rioting all summer it's just a total inversion of reality and if you just
[2:07:15.280 --> 2:07:19.520]  let it suck you in like it does most young people because of social media and stuff and
[2:07:19.520 --> 2:07:25.840]  you'll just get confused and far away from yourself and nature and the true spirit of life and love
[2:07:27.840 --> 2:07:31.520]  absolutely brother and as long as we go out and stare at the stars that god made
[2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:36.240]  a hugger father hugger mother hugger children as long as we have that we have everything
[2:07:36.240 --> 2:07:39.680]  and you know i mean i never cared about hollywood ever cared about things but i thought they were
[2:07:39.680 --> 2:07:45.120]  kind of interesting now i see it all as bondage i mean it's not just that we don't want the world
[2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:50.560]  we're repelled by it does that make sense yeah totally it's like you see in that video of the
[2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:56.160]  two girls with the uber driver horrible horrible uh incident where the girl gets out of the car
[2:07:56.160 --> 2:08:00.640]  and immediately says my car or my phone is in there talking about her phone being in the car
[2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:05.760]  while there's literally a man that yeah she just killed somebody she just killed somebody
[2:08:05.760 --> 2:08:11.120]  her phone in the car though so that is just totally where i feel like my generation is where
[2:08:11.120 --> 2:08:15.840]  it's like something insanely happen insane could be happening right beside him and if you take
[2:08:15.840 --> 2:08:20.160]  pictures and comment on it rather than take action and help or do anything you know this
[2:08:20.160 --> 2:08:27.680]  thing happened this weekend i was in a restaurant and i would i left my phone and forgot and i came
[2:08:27.680 --> 2:08:31.600]  right back in to get it and these women were like oh you got it you got it and they were like oh
[2:08:31.600 --> 2:08:35.680]  oh yeah they have it they have their and when the and when the waiter handed me the phone they went
[2:08:35.680 --> 2:08:42.320]  oh and we're like literally like pooping uh that it was like a worship of the damn thing have you
[2:08:42.320 --> 2:08:47.840]  seen this yeah it's horrible and that's how my i even have a younger sister and they're even worse
[2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:52.480]  it seems like i don't know we just have to dig ourselves out of the pit of technology
[2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:57.360]  ruling over us and just realize that life is more valuable you know like there's better things
[2:08:57.840 --> 2:09:02.080]  well just you know my mother told me this we were at the beach staring out at sunset she said you
[2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:07.920]  know all the computers all the science the world can't have us see beauty in that sun and these waves
[2:09:07.920 --> 2:09:13.680]  and rejoicing to be in this creation god made this is worship of god we don't worship the creation
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:18.400]  but this is our connection to god god made this we're creation of god we are in this pantheon
[2:09:18.400 --> 2:09:23.760]  of god and it was it was the most profound thing i ever heard it was totally true and it was literally
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:30.000]  where this all a giant cathedral to god all a giant system for us to rejoice and come together
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:35.680]  and be together and have experience and consciousness just thank god worship god thank you god thank you
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:39.520]  for consciousness thank you for everything you've done thank you for everything you've done for us
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:48.560]  thank you thank you thank you for life thank you for your son jesus epic is one of only a handful
[2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:56.160]  of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association and they know that big tech
[2:09:56.160 --> 2:10:01.280]  is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized
[2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:06.320]  crime racketeering that's why they've been massively expanding their services so whether you have
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:10.800]  domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other
[2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:16.160]  major service they've got it all and they're expanding and if you go to info wars domains
[2:10:16.160 --> 2:10:22.560]  dot com and follow that link you get all their services at the lowest price and 25 percent of
[2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:27.600]  your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war and then we get five
[2:10:27.600 --> 2:10:32.800]  percent as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them so it's a win
[2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:37.760]  win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists are destroying what was
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:44.480]  open to what was free so info wars domains dot com the revolution starts there info wars domains
[2:10:44.480 --> 2:10:52.080]  dot com take action now the equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control
[2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:59.440]  big pharma they control academia they control the military industrial complex they control big tech
[2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:06.080]  and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:13.600]  total despotism and dehumanization it is the western christian idea of human freedom that ended
[2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:18.480]  slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them so because
[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:24.880]  they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and use
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:31.920]  the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their
[2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:37.840]  monopolies of control that's why they target info wars because we understand the key to defeating
[2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:43.600]  them but the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video
[2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:45.760]  so we double your efforts we're all in this together
[2:11:45.760 --> 2:11:52.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:11:52.160 --> 2:12:04.560]  so
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:28.560]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:34.080]  well drew her name does this here with us in studio he's going down to the border this weekend
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:37.680]  we're gonna probably be going down there on monday or so maybe earlier but easter's here but
[2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:43.280]  he's here working hard great reporter great work connoisseur in other areas but a great christian
[2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:49.120]  and and obviously you hear the passionate speech and so i wanted to get him on for at least a few
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:55.120]  segments today ahead of who supposed to fourth hour very popular last friday when he hosted the
[2:12:55.120 --> 2:13:01.680]  fourth hour stew peters is coming up as well ahead of owens shroyer and the war room but you were
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:06.000]  you were saying yeah let's get into the border but also some of the culture war stuff and some of
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:10.320]  the things that are going on as they put us onto this virtual economy tell us about it yeah i mean
[2:13:10.320 --> 2:13:14.720]  i'm pretty sure your your viewers are familiar with bad baby you know she's the catch me outside
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:21.040]  girl that was on dr phil when extremely viral totally depraved uh she made an only fans and
[2:13:21.040 --> 2:13:25.200]  for those of you that don't know what only fans is it's basically like a virtual little webcam
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:31.840]  where people could pay hundreds thousands of dollars to watch you naked uh she just turned 18
[2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:37.600]  about uh like seven days ago and uh she made her only fans and within six hours made a million
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:41.840]  dollars out so you can only imagine the pedophiles that were just hey guys don't pull up the naked
[2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:46.080]  footage obviously but pull up bad baby because i don't even follow culture a lot but i vaguely know
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:53.680]  that is pull up dr a bad baby from dr phil yeah there it is and so again the idea here is it's
[2:13:53.680 --> 2:13:57.760]  like porn yeah porn actresses in the 70s were making millions of dollars from the millions of
[2:13:57.760 --> 2:14:01.200]  million dollars now that everybody got involved then at the whole bottom fell out and porn doesn't
[2:14:01.200 --> 2:14:05.360]  have any money in it well now that everybody's going to only fans okay she makes a bunch of money
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:09.680]  a bunch of others will jump on it then they'll make nothing this is all it's all satanism works
[2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:12.960]  they all like promote this everybody rushes there but then it all falls apart and it's
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:18.320]  totally degrading to women right i mean in this in this individual was was a child like seven days
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:23.440]  ago she just turned 18 so you can only imagine like the pedophiles that have just been waiting
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:29.120]  sitting and just waiting to see this person uh completely naked and and people it's it's
[2:14:29.120 --> 2:14:33.040]  demoralization alex that's exactly what we're saying it's not because you have ardor literature
[2:14:33.040 --> 2:14:36.160]  it's nothing it's because you're giving up your youth to us yeah you're selling your soul and they
[2:14:36.160 --> 2:14:40.800]  want this they want to see children naked even though she just turned 18 they're getting everything
[2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:45.360]  that they've dreamed of and what they wanted this is a complete demoralization of the culture and it's
[2:14:45.360 --> 2:14:49.840]  going to continue to get worse and worse and worse and i think i think the majority of our
[2:14:49.840 --> 2:14:57.280]  institutions alex have been completely demoralized from disney nicolodian mainstream media hollywood
[2:14:57.280 --> 2:15:02.480]  movies music and the key is it's not that we're shocked she's naked yeah it's that there everyone's
[2:15:02.480 --> 2:15:07.680]  taught to sell yourself out to the system the only value you have is giving up your intimacy
[2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:12.320]  to something that isn't intimate giving it up to the iris of a camera for a bunch of slums if it
[2:15:12.320 --> 2:15:17.840]  alex things continue to get worse and worse and worse the the the the desensitizing the demoralizing
[2:15:17.840 --> 2:15:23.280]  they they want us to accept these things as normal they want you to think it's normal that little
[2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:28.560]  nozz is making a music video staging himself getting sodomized and from the entire world
[2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:33.760]  that they want you to think that it's not a stripper poll well then here's the deal blacks are the
[2:15:33.760 --> 2:15:40.160]  model of the globalist takeover and you know about uh the the great society they did social studies
[2:15:40.160 --> 2:15:46.080]  they they came to president uh who's a kkk member linda maize johnson and this is on record and they
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:49.840]  said hey the blacks are all republican and they're they're he goes well i'm not gonna let i'm not
[2:15:49.840 --> 2:15:53.280]  gonna quote it was a medial take it out of context say i said it but he called them in words and
[2:15:53.280 --> 2:15:57.040]  said they're up he always he said i'll have him vote and we're democrat 100 years break up their
[2:15:57.040 --> 2:16:01.200]  families pay the women not to have men in the house and we'll we'll break them up it's the same
[2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:06.240]  thing here that's the microcosm of every community now black lives matter says get rid of the nuclear
[2:16:06.240 --> 2:16:11.120]  family and get black men to have their jitters cut off i mean that's obviously a cult that
[2:16:11.120 --> 2:16:15.440]  wants to destroy you and that that's that's that's what that's what the the the the the black rapper
[2:16:15.440 --> 2:16:20.160]  haven't sectioned but that's that's a per that music video is a perfect representation roll that
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:26.000]  roll that where he talks perfect representation of what the radical left of what the global elites
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:30.320]  the radical democrats have been doing to the black community for decades
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:35.600]  sodomizing these communities literally taking advantage of them using them making them famous
[2:16:35.600 --> 2:16:39.040]  throwing them hundreds of thousands of dollars oh say making them think that they're actually worth
[2:16:39.040 --> 2:16:42.960]  something but they continue to use them for their political gain and their political purposes
[2:16:42.960 --> 2:16:47.360]  and right now i think the democrat party is shifting from the black community now to the
[2:16:47.360 --> 2:16:52.160]  hispanic community because now they're the biggest non-white voting block uh as of 2020 this is just
[2:16:52.160 --> 2:16:57.280]  a snake puts him into a trance they have gay sex then he rides a stripper pole down to hell
[2:16:57.840 --> 2:17:03.920]  is sodomized by satan and then he kills satan and becomes satan and they want you to think that
[2:17:03.920 --> 2:17:09.280]  this is normal and it's interesting because this is and when i say biblically now he's transformed
[2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:14.800]  now he's a trainee yep and they want you to think that these things are normal and when i say this
[2:17:14.800 --> 2:17:19.440]  is biblically accurate it's it's it's accurate in the sense where he stages it in the garden of
[2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:23.680]  eating the tree of knowledges in the background the serpent rolls up and it's interesting because
[2:17:23.680 --> 2:17:29.200]  they change it in front instead of adam and eve it's just him that's their message there is no
[2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:34.720]  male there is no female it's just him that's what they do this is pure blasphemy and it's not surprising
[2:17:34.720 --> 2:17:39.600]  but this is what the the satanists they want they want kids like this they want because this goes
[2:17:39.600 --> 2:17:44.240]  on tiktok alex and then you have millions of kids that stage little dances after this thinking that
[2:17:44.240 --> 2:17:50.480]  luciferianism is normal is absolutely normal and we know that it's not but this is the continuation
[2:17:50.480 --> 2:17:55.600]  of the demoralization there it is he's riding down to hell and by the way so milie syris uh she
[2:17:55.600 --> 2:18:01.440]  looks like a dead crackhead or something wearing the devil shoes that the guys find the phone it's
[2:18:01.440 --> 2:18:07.040]  on infowars.com milie syris wearing the satan shoes that then he's pushing these these fake
[2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:14.560]  nikes and she looks like a total slave she was on joe rogan she sounded like a a brain dead crackhead
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:19.040]  this is what satan does for you and again it's milie syris's dad that's putting this guy out
[2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:23.280]  definitely a satan yeah they're they're they're useful idiots they're used by satan himself
[2:18:23.280 --> 2:18:27.360]  and look at that it's just it's just total depra that is literally total depravity that is what
[2:18:27.360 --> 2:18:32.720]  the democrat party is doing and has done to the black community for decades and what's even worse
[2:18:32.720 --> 2:18:37.600]  is i don't know james charles you know who's james charles is right alex the the gay guy that's the
[2:18:37.600 --> 2:18:42.560]  makeup artist and he's totally huge i actually don't but it zoom in on this guy's go ahead okay
[2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:49.440]  james charles right has openly admitted he has millions of subscribers millions of subscribers
[2:18:49.440 --> 2:18:54.960]  on youtube he's openly admitted it broke last night that james charles admitted that he's

[2:19:00.160 --> 2:19:05.920]  a day while you and while you alex and steven krauter and americans that are speaking out against
[2:19:05.920 --> 2:19:11.760]  these things get silenced on a daily on a weekly on a monthly basis but they let openly admitted
[2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:18.320]  pedophiles like james charles be on their platforms exactly and they're debasing a black man having
[2:19:18.320 --> 2:19:24.640]  him be raped by satan as if this is cute oh but he killed satan this is so sick it's completely
[2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:29.600]  demoralized you just said it so so so so now they're openly just mainlining pedophilia yeah
[2:19:29.600 --> 2:19:35.680]  absolutely you guys can look it up james charles openly admitted that he's sexting underage little
[2:19:35.680 --> 2:19:40.560]  boys and this guy reaches millions of people i didn't know the name but i've seen that yeah
[2:19:40.560 --> 2:19:47.440]  millions of people on youtube on a daily on a weekly basis yet alex jones is scary too scary
[2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:51.840]  for youtube yet steven krauter is too scary and too dangerous and a threat to youtube
[2:19:51.840 --> 2:19:55.760]  conservatives or anyone that's speaking truth even some leftists that are speaking truth are
[2:19:55.760 --> 2:20:00.720]  getting censored on youtube but james charles is totally normal and who do they target alex
[2:20:01.280 --> 2:20:06.480]  the kids drew age lives on twitter for now well man you're a great talk show host i mean i knew
[2:20:06.480 --> 2:20:10.320]  when you were a guest on dirkoz get that guy back home that you were too busy come on but now that
[2:20:10.320 --> 2:20:14.080]  you're here you are a natural talk show host brother you're kicking ass well i appreciate it
[2:20:14.080 --> 2:20:17.760]  we're on fire for god you know what's going on absolutely it's out in the open now though isn't
[2:20:17.760 --> 2:20:22.720]  yeah it's out in the open and i think the demoralization the depravity is at its total depravity
[2:20:22.720 --> 2:20:26.880]  when you read the bible these things are no surprise because this is what the bible has
[2:20:26.880 --> 2:20:31.760]  indicated where a society will be when we get to that place talk about that so where do we go next
[2:20:31.760 --> 2:20:36.880]  on the timeline history repeats itself over and over again we're now entering the bottom of a cycle
[2:20:36.880 --> 2:20:41.120]  what comes next get ready folks because this is going to get nasty we'll be right back with
[2:20:41.120 --> 2:20:47.360]  your hernan does i'm alex jones info wars dot com i'm not going to sit here and waste your time
[2:20:47.360 --> 2:20:54.800]  or my time and rattle off the successes info wars has had if you're paying attention you know we've
[2:20:54.800 --> 2:21:03.040]  done together but i'll tell you this the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying
[2:21:03.040 --> 2:21:08.720]  to destroy all independent forms of media they're trying to shutter and silence human resistance
[2:21:08.720 --> 2:21:14.240]  so now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[2:21:14.240 --> 2:21:18.480]  and everything you warned your friends and family about surrounds be true so it's now that your
[2:21:18.480 --> 2:21:25.120]  credibility is way up the power structure should have silenced those of us that they can't but up
[2:21:25.120 --> 2:21:32.720]  to all of us to not let them silence any of us we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity
[2:21:32.720 --> 2:21:38.560]  and setting on free speech we have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that
[2:21:38.560 --> 2:21:48.400]  long dark night doesn't come so be the tolerbearers you are the new world order is a planetary
[2:21:48.400 --> 2:21:56.560]  corporate plan for world government but world government is only the control grid now inner
[2:21:56.560 --> 2:22:02.720]  members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality
[2:22:02.720 --> 2:22:09.200]  but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms
[2:22:09.760 --> 2:22:15.760]  that's why they say carbon is bad they are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet
[2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:22.000]  they are playing god they believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:29.040]  that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation i know this sounds insane
[2:22:29.040 --> 2:22:36.160]  but if you read the writings of the globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have
[2:22:36.160 --> 2:22:43.280]  been given the information to say no to this plan this is the end of all life on earth as we know it
[2:22:43.280 --> 2:22:53.360]  this is the alien takeover of earth granny do right granny do right thanks for holding her on
[2:22:53.360 --> 2:22:59.280]  the ear go ahead challenge first of all let me say i love your products i am a granny and um for
[2:22:59.280 --> 2:23:04.480]  all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded
[2:23:04.480 --> 2:23:10.560]  up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple
[2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:18.320]  of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already
[2:23:18.320 --> 2:23:22.640]  taking your other supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do
[2:23:22.640 --> 2:23:26.800]  because i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it and it
[2:23:26.800 --> 2:23:32.800]  doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time i started noticing okay you know
[2:23:32.800 --> 2:23:38.080]  this is the ticket this is working this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put
[2:23:38.080 --> 2:23:43.840]  it on derma blend anymore you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally
[2:23:43.840 --> 2:23:51.040]  cleared up my skin the people are awakening they're taking control of their own environment
[2:23:51.040 --> 2:23:56.400]  cell phones are an amazing tool really they're a super computer that's handheld but big tech
[2:23:56.400 --> 2:24:01.840]  large corporations hackers governments foreign governments the chai comms especially are using
[2:24:01.840 --> 2:24:07.760]  this to steal your data to share your data to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up
[2:24:07.760 --> 2:24:13.680]  billions of people's data they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements
[2:24:13.680 --> 2:24:20.880]  cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their ai takeover in their own
[2:24:20.880 --> 2:24:25.440]  words they admit it show i've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that
[2:24:25.440 --> 2:24:29.760]  for more than a decade and now the units have gotten really lightweight they're faraday cages
[2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:34.480]  they just look like a cloth envelope they work absolutely great and it just gives you that
[2:24:34.480 --> 2:24:39.920]  security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and
[2:24:39.920 --> 2:24:43.520]  don't want big brother to know what you're up to because it's other business get yours at info
[2:24:43.520 --> 2:24:55.360]  or store dot com today you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:24:55.360 --> 2:25:05.200]  you
[2:25:06.720 --> 2:25:14.880]  everybody knows that the days are loaded everybody rolls with their fingers
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:18.480]  to her nanda's investigative journalists here with us he's about to go on the border starting
[2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:22.480]  tomorrow we'll have coverage of all of that throughout the weekend but another thing is
[2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:28.160]  this is stereo some car some little car ran into one of the checkpoints they've got in dc
[2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:32.560]  and so they said oh shooting has happened two officers shot that okay what the shooting
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:38.720]  a vehicle rammed it and i was just during the break they're in the coffee room uh and fox
[2:25:38.720 --> 2:25:45.200]  news was on and chris wallace was on there talking about well this is post 9 11 you know we can't
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:49.840]  ever get rid of the military and police at dc now after what happened to capital it's post 9 11
[2:25:49.840 --> 2:25:54.800]  11 oh yeah one guy had a heart attack two days later they killed four citizens and so now it's
[2:25:54.800 --> 2:26:01.280]  big national news you think a car wrecking in china is is news but here it's like look how dangerous
[2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:08.640]  it is imagine if there's ever a real bioweapon imagine there's ever a real attack we have been
[2:26:08.640 --> 2:26:15.120]  taught to be total ninnies so here's a fox news and the cowardly behavior going on because uh injury
[2:26:15.120 --> 2:26:20.160]  or harm obviously he injured a couple of capital police officers but here we go again
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:27.440]  yeah uh and interestingly enough yesterday coincidentally for a power player they're
[2:26:27.440 --> 2:26:33.360]  going to run in a couple of weeks i interviewed karin gibson she is the new senate sergeant at
[2:26:33.360 --> 2:26:38.080]  arms the person in charge of security for the senate and one of the people in charge of security
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:42.640]  for the capital and several of the things that she said to me yesterday john for this piece
[2:26:42.640 --> 2:26:48.560]  that we're going to run in a couple of weeks really uh have some resonance with regard to what
[2:26:48.560 --> 2:26:55.360]  we're we're seeing here first of all she was called on she was a lieutenant general in the army
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:27:00.880]  she was in the army from more than 30 years particularly in the intelligence working around
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:06.400]  the world leading intelligence operations in afghanistan iraq a number of other places in
[2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:12.800]  south korea uh she was then put on the capital review board to review what happened on january
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:18.640]  6th and they came out with several recommendations some of which have started to be implemented
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:24.800]  they asked for 800 more capital police officers to help beef up security around the capital
[2:27:24.800 --> 2:27:30.240]  they asked for mobile fencing that would be easier to erect and put up to protect the
[2:27:30.240 --> 2:27:36.800]  capital grounds and they also asked uh and and they plan to implement it that is easier for them
[2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:42.240]  to summon the national guard the dc national guard to come protect the capital uh in the case of
[2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:48.480]  another riot or insurrection obviously this was something different than that um one of the other
[2:27:48.480 --> 2:27:53.920]  things that she said to me was that they have and as mark myrnath reported this they have begun to
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:58.960]  take down a lot of the fencing around the capital and in fact a week or so ago you wouldn't have
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:04.880]  been able to get anywhere near as close to the capital as this assailant was able to get in his
[2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:10.800]  car uh and and they've also reduced substantially the number of national guard around the capital
[2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:14.960]  although there are still as they were reporting there's still a much heavier number than there
[2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:20.640]  were before january 6th but one of the things that the sergeant arms general gibson said to me
[2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:27.120]  was that you know there's a constant balance because on the one hand your job one is to secure
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:32.960]  the capital to secure the safety of our elected representatives but if that's job one job one
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:40.640]  a is to provide public access so that members of the general public voters who have elected these
[2:28:40.640 --> 2:28:47.040]  these leaders can come at least see and in some cases interact uh with their leaders and so that
[2:28:47.040 --> 2:28:53.440]  balance between security and public access uh is one that they always have to negotiate i said well
[2:28:53.440 --> 2:28:58.800]  are things going to ever get back to the where they were before january 6th then general gibson
[2:28:58.800 --> 2:29:04.320]  said no they won't we're gonna try it'll be a lot less conspicuous than it is now but we want
[2:29:04.320 --> 2:29:11.760]  to make uh while we we provide access to the their elected leaders for members of the american
[2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:17.120]  public uh we're not going to be able to go back and she said like after 9 11 you know once you
[2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:25.280]  start to impose security uh string you know contingencies you never go back entirely on them
[2:29:25.280 --> 2:29:28.800]  and then i thought okay so let's stop there he goes on because that was the point i actually
[2:29:28.800 --> 2:29:32.240]  caught at the point i wanted i'm not mad as it was a longer clip and i wanted to get to
[2:29:32.240 --> 2:29:36.560]  but he goes on and on like this is the way it is it's normal we need 10 000 troops and it's
[2:29:36.560 --> 2:29:39.600]  going to be hidden and we're gonna and we're gonna have checkpoints everywhere else too if
[2:29:39.600 --> 2:29:43.760]  you're but the border's wide open you know none of this holds water drew her name that's yeah you
[2:29:43.760 --> 2:29:47.600]  know it's interesting that you hear him say this because this is what they've been saying since
[2:29:47.600 --> 2:29:52.880]  january 6 comparing what happened at the capital to 9 11 which in my opinion is absolutely absurd
[2:29:52.880 --> 2:29:58.400]  and a slap in the face to a lot of american families uh and you know exactly why but how is
[2:29:58.400 --> 2:30:03.120]  it within minutes the national guard wrap this up within minutes they're out there but our southern
[2:30:03.120 --> 2:30:08.000]  border is completely open our southern border is completely open to cartels terrorists people coming
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:13.760]  across mass graves hundreds of thousands dead burning babies being killed but you never see that
[2:30:13.760 --> 2:30:18.080]  but oh my god oh by the way it's a black guy so they're gonna shut this down quick the white guy
[2:30:18.080 --> 2:30:22.160]  be the end of the world yeah black guy yeah because yeah if it's a black guy they're gonna shut it down
[2:30:22.160 --> 2:30:27.120]  quick but this is they want to train the public this is what this is what third world country
[2:30:27.120 --> 2:30:33.280]  authoritarian regimes do they save this is exactly how they act they save their resources for themselves
[2:30:33.280 --> 2:30:38.400]  alex but they don't use them for the people they'll protect themselves in their own capitals or
[2:30:38.400 --> 2:30:43.280]  their own homes their own mansions they have their own state police just like in minnesota
[2:30:43.280 --> 2:30:47.920]  minneapolis got rid of the police half and then hired themselves 24 hours to do it again and the
[2:30:47.920 --> 2:30:52.480]  people are begging for them to come back because the people realize it's a stupid thing to defund
[2:30:52.480 --> 2:30:58.800]  the police it's not a smart thing but right now this is what authoritarians do and as you said
[2:30:58.800 --> 2:31:03.360]  the primary is exploded in dc because all the cops are guarding the capital like it's about to be
[2:31:03.360 --> 2:31:08.720]  attacked the capital is fortified alex you like look at that that thing is fortified compared
[2:31:08.720 --> 2:31:13.040]  to the united states southern border where you have ranchers you have americans living on the
[2:31:13.040 --> 2:31:17.920]  southern border some of these americans have been shot and killed by some of these cartels
[2:31:17.920 --> 2:31:22.800]  but we can't have joe biden get his butt up to finish the southern border to have a rally with
[2:31:22.800 --> 2:31:26.720]  a million people again and they got scared they wanted troops then you have to build that up for
[2:31:26.720 --> 2:31:31.440]  weeks they act like any minute 300 000 people are going to show up in a pack yeah because people
[2:31:31.440 --> 2:31:37.200]  need to realize that they only use these resources for themselves when it benefits themselves
[2:31:37.200 --> 2:31:41.760]  they don't care about the american people they look at this the guy crashed the car so they just
[2:31:41.760 --> 2:31:46.400]  put riot police look at that that's more secure than the southern border the wicked flea when
[2:31:46.400 --> 2:31:51.760]  alex alex when we go to a car crash let's all get the riot police we go down there go go to
[2:31:51.760 --> 2:31:56.240]  that oh you guys can't move it but look at that there are more national guard there in front
[2:31:56.240 --> 2:32:01.440]  of the capital than there are on some sections at the united states southern border right now
[2:32:01.440 --> 2:32:07.040]  this is pathetic i mean wow so a dude turns down the wrong street crashes his vehicle
[2:32:07.040 --> 2:32:13.520]  and it's total hysteria total because they want people to be engineered to freak out and lose their
[2:32:13.520 --> 2:32:17.920]  minds and to think that it's normal to have martial law on americans and then meanwhile
[2:32:17.920 --> 2:32:23.280]  chris wallis is like it'll never go back to normal now once you have something it never goes back
[2:32:23.280 --> 2:32:27.840]  yeah there is there the new story you're not essential you can't ever go outside this is the
[2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:31.680]  world that we've given you this is the new world right now in the united states of america the
[2:32:31.680 --> 2:32:36.560]  lockdowns aren't going away joe biden is out talking to the press again which is a nightmare but
[2:32:36.560 --> 2:32:40.160]  he's telling people come on you got to do your part don't don't make it we don't even know if this guy
[2:32:40.160 --> 2:32:45.680]  had diabetes and just crashed his car yeah who knows he was drunk like oh my god a car crashed
[2:32:45.680 --> 2:32:50.080]  into the world sleep they just want to bring us into the third world alex they want to bring
[2:32:50.080 --> 2:32:54.800]  us into the fourth world they want to continue that the next stage is demoralization but that's
[2:32:54.800 --> 2:32:59.440]  where we're at but the next stage is destabilization those days are coming we haven't seen anything yet
[2:32:59.440 --> 2:33:03.760]  alex well that's why they have all the tent cities that's all of us getting us ready yeah they want
[2:33:03.760 --> 2:33:09.280]  to prepare the public for people to realize that our outages you know yeah all the optics all the

[2:35:53.280 --> 2:35:59.360]  of conquest one bases its power on having strong enlightened focused people with an ethos and a
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:06.320]  culture and ingenuity art and skill and strength the other is based on the massive number of slaves
[2:36:06.320 --> 2:36:13.600]  it controls with a tiny elite above it america is transferring out of a system based on the ethos
[2:36:13.600 --> 2:36:19.040]  of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery that's why the globalists
[2:36:19.040 --> 2:36:23.760]  tell us america was founded on slavery when it wasn't they point out one of our evils so they
[2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:28.880]  can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters a global permanent lockdown is here

[2:39:16.400 --> 2:39:21.760]  drew her nandes at drew h liable on twitter but stew peters is another powerful talk show host
[2:39:21.760 --> 2:39:25.760]  he'll be hosted the fourth hour i'm gonna try to jam in a few calls and the next little no man's
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:32.160]  land segment for those that are holding we got some bad news suspect dead a capital police officer
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:36.800]  stabbed another injured at their car rams into barrier outside building so now we're getting a
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:41.840]  clear picture of what happened first they said a shooting a ramming then it was just a ramming now
[2:39:41.840 --> 2:39:47.120]  we learned probably a mentally ill person he was a black man probably mentally ill like it was a
[2:39:47.120 --> 2:39:51.760]  white dude randomly ramming something stabbed but we probably say he's mentally ill uh and that's
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:57.920]  why you have armed people to stop bad people uh and so there you go but they are on every channel
[2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:04.320]  acting like the us just got hit with nuclear weapons and again as you said drew her nandes
[2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:10.400]  this is the third worldization of america yeah the next step is destabilization that's where america
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:16.400]  is going next we've been completely demoralized uh we've accepted uh that in the culture we've
[2:40:16.400 --> 2:40:21.360]  accepted not only accepted but we celebrate the murdering of babies inside of the womb uh right
[2:40:21.360 --> 2:40:25.760]  now people are getting a glimpse of what's taking place at the southern border babies are being thrown
[2:40:25.760 --> 2:40:30.560]  off of 14 foot border walls and being left in the desert by themselves uh and the radical left
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:35.920]  is completely silent uh right now the american people are completely demoralized uh not all of
[2:40:35.920 --> 2:40:39.120]  you out there that are listening but you guys know who i'm talking about but the mainstream
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:44.800]  culture has been completely demoralized so now when they start moving into these areas of destabilizing
[2:40:44.800 --> 2:40:48.720]  the country uh through the federal government whether it's through politics or whether it's
[2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:53.360]  through natural disaster whatever it may be uh the american people are going to be so freaked out
[2:40:53.360 --> 2:40:59.360]  but they're now engineered to run to the federal government or the state uh to protect them and
[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:02.800]  that's what's scary is bill gates and all these globalists are in the news again today saying
[2:41:02.800 --> 2:41:07.600]  oh a real weapon's coming you'll have real death soon which i predicted on how they work so we're
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:12.480]  all scared of like a overhyped virus as bad as the flu imagine when they release a real thing
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:17.360]  yeah i mean they're even here in texas they lifted the mandate right they lifted the mandate but
[2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:23.680]  businesses are still afraid of getting it canceled because people are still afraid i was getting
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:27.040]  dental work done this morning and the and the dentist is like no we know it's all bull we know
[2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:31.120]  the statistics none of us got sick yeah we know it's crap but still we wear the mask and still
[2:41:31.120 --> 2:41:34.400]  we fist bump and i said just shake my hand he goes yeah okay i shook my hand yeah but i'm like
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:39.200]  you gotta tell others to stop it's the lawyers saying do this we have liability the idea now
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:43.680]  that we're all guilty for what we breathe on people statistically we know if we don't breathe on
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:47.200]  people we don't have an immune system yeah they're probably gonna tax the oxygen next alex that's
[2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:53.200]  what herd immunity is all of us breathing on each other we're all together oh we got a capital
[2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:58.800]  update look they're all wearing masks all virtue signaling yeah here go ahead and fade the audio
[2:41:58.800 --> 2:42:08.880]  up let's hear this let's hear this i mean rammed his car into two of our officers and then hit the
[2:42:08.880 --> 2:42:18.640]  north barricade barrier assets time the suspect accident the vehicle with a knife in hand our
[2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:26.800]  officers then engage that suspect uh he did not respond to verbal commands the suspect did start
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:35.280]  lunging toward us capital police officers at which at which time uh us capital police officers
[2:42:35.280 --> 2:42:45.840]  fired upon the suspect at this time uh the suspect has been pronounced deceased two us
[2:42:45.840 --> 2:42:53.360]  capital police officers were transported to two different hospitals and it is with a very very
[2:42:53.360 --> 2:43:04.960]  heavy heart that i announced one of our officers has succumbed to his injuries we are okay so here's
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:10.000]  the footage of the black man that supposedly did a shot and kill okay obviously mentally ill we're
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:16.560]  gonna oh it's a black supremacist to kill the white people no but if this was a white dude
[2:43:16.560 --> 2:43:20.560]  oh my god you you would you would you would you would hear from the banning of knives group
[2:43:20.560 --> 2:43:25.280]  not only that they're going to blame this on white supremacy somehow someway uh i mean even
[2:43:25.280 --> 2:43:30.640]  vox everything that's going on with uh how the numbers are coming out that black americans the
[2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:35.680]  black community is increasingly committing more crimes against asian americans which is a literal
[2:43:35.680 --> 2:43:40.000]  fact oh i saw mainstream news where they're saying white still caused that yeah here's exactly vox
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:45.280]  news is coming out and saying that it's white supremacy that black people are increasing in
[2:43:45.280 --> 2:43:49.280]  their own american nationalism and they're committing more hate crimes against asians
[2:43:49.280 --> 2:43:55.040]  but the point i'm trying to make is this stuff like this is probably going to end up being blamed
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:43:58.720]  on white supremacy because that's all they can do how much you want to bet at least one of the cops
[2:43:58.720 --> 2:44:03.280]  is black is half the dc cops are black or more i mean this is obviously not a racial attack yeah
[2:44:03.280 --> 2:44:08.400]  it's i don't i mean we'll we'll find out when the story comes out but i'm waiting to see how the
[2:44:08.400 --> 2:44:13.520]  mainstream media is going to spin this it's either going to be because of white supremacy or it's
[2:44:13.520 --> 2:44:17.600]  they're going to make them out to be some kind of trump supporter also we'll see we'll see you
[2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:24.320]  can never hear what these people are you can't hear there's a freaking mask over her face yeah like
[2:44:24.320 --> 2:44:27.280]  like used to they pull the mask down to talk on mic now they don't even do that because you got a
[2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:32.480]  version signal yeah yeah they want you to just speak through a mask they want you to sit down and be
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:36.480]  just completely doing what you're told to do and that's what they want they want you to just be
[2:44:36.480 --> 2:44:41.440]  good little children a good little boy a good little girl or whatever you identify as and sit down
[2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:46.000]  and just accept what we tell you while they shut down the country while they give the jobs to china
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:49.280]  while they shut down the cold power plants while they shut down the keystone pipeline while they
[2:44:49.280 --> 2:44:53.760]  say highways are racist she always thought you wanted highways coming by your house because it
[2:44:53.760 --> 2:44:57.520]  upped your property value yeah i mean everywhere i live's got a damn highway i don't look i go
[2:44:57.520 --> 2:45:02.800]  that's a highway that's because i it's a racist yeah a border wall was racist until trump was
[2:45:02.800 --> 2:45:07.600]  finally out of office right and now they have it up at the capital it's more secure than the southern
[2:45:07.600 --> 2:45:12.400]  border and it's it's it's just so ridiculous and i just wonder how people that are watching because
[2:45:12.400 --> 2:45:16.320]  i know a lot of people watch you alex that that don't disagree necessarily and i just want to
[2:45:16.320 --> 2:45:20.160]  kind of ask them like how can you not see through this stuff by now how can you not sit here and
[2:45:20.160 --> 2:45:26.000]  watch this and just absolutely just discern and declare finally like this is a load of crap i'm
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:29.920]  not talking about what just happened at the capital i'm talking about their rhetoric i'm talking about
[2:45:29.920 --> 2:45:34.160]  their optics i'm talking about the way that they all of it all of it let's play the video this is
[2:45:34.160 --> 2:45:39.680]  a white supremacist attack father and son have a shootout in lana tv viewers will see this shocking
[2:45:39.680 --> 2:45:46.480]  kkk attack uh here here here here's the kkk attack it's clip one actual kkk attack here it is
[2:45:47.200 --> 2:45:51.760]  knew at six tonight a kawaita county father tells deputies he confronted his son about
[2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:58.560]  having a gun in his pocket and he says rather than turn it over his son opened fire on him it was all
[2:45:58.560 --> 2:46:03.120]  caught on the family's home security camera as you saw there alfax says doug evans has more on
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:10.960]  the story now from kawaita county deputies say the surveillance video starts with mario clark
[2:46:10.960 --> 2:46:16.240]  leaving his father's house the father behind him pointing a weapon at his son the father then
[2:46:16.240 --> 2:46:22.560]  flinches ducks and runs for cover after a shot is fired in his direction deputies say the family
[2:46:22.560 --> 2:46:27.680]  shootout started when the 26 year old mario clark arrived at his father's house with a gun in his
[2:46:27.680 --> 2:46:32.880]  pocket a gun his father did not want in his that's another we now know the story came there demanding
[2:46:32.880 --> 2:46:37.280]  stuff with a gun the dad pulled a gun to get out of here he shot at his own father it's a it's a
[2:46:37.280 --> 2:46:43.840]  black family my only point is is that this is evil this is america falling apart and and and and
[2:46:43.840 --> 2:46:49.120]  again they're trying to project race war into this that's not what's happening yeah they want to
[2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:53.920]  demonize white people that's what this is uh they don't want to talk about black on black crime which
[2:46:53.920 --> 2:46:59.120]  was skyrocketing under the first uh african-american president brock obama by the way that's a fact
[2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:04.800]  under obama's fbi black on black crime statistics we're proving this uh but this is an attack on
[2:47:04.800 --> 2:47:10.240]  white people alex they want to demonize a race of people this is what adolf hitler did to the jews
[2:47:10.240 --> 2:47:14.400]  and this is what the woke supremacists are doing right now to white people they want to demonize
[2:47:14.400 --> 2:47:18.720]  them because they have revenge in their hearts because of what took place 200 300 years ago
[2:47:18.720 --> 2:47:24.240]  and they want to continue to do this even to white people alex that that don't see color that can
[2:47:24.240 --> 2:47:30.720]  care less about race but they still do it because somehow racism and slavery was their fault and
[2:47:30.720 --> 2:47:35.280]  they want to do this it's intentional it's intentional china's running death camps for muslims
[2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:39.360]  christians and buddhists and and and and if and if they give a hundred million dollars from tim
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:43.280]  cook to change the subject of whites and blacks killing each other they win yeah because the
[2:47:43.280 --> 2:47:46.720]  vast majority of black people on race the same with white people as anybody we all just want
[2:47:46.720 --> 2:47:51.040]  prosperity but if they can make it all about that they win yeah and jesus warned about this in
[2:47:51.040 --> 2:47:56.400]  matthew chapter 24 he said in the last days we would see kingdom rise against kingdom and nation
[2:47:56.400 --> 2:48:00.400]  rise against nation and when you read the word nation in greek he's talking about ethnos these
[2:48:00.400 --> 2:48:05.040]  are ethnic race wars so i want to warn people stay away from this stuff because if you get
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:09.760]  engaged in a race war you're you're really dabbling into what the devil's plans are here in the last
[2:48:09.760 --> 2:48:14.240]  days and we're seeing it right now in real time i put a video out of the day saying satanism equals
[2:48:14.240 --> 2:48:18.320]  race war yeah because we're all humans and if satan can trick us to fight with each other when
[2:48:18.320 --> 2:48:23.680]  we're all children of god the devil wins yeah and the devil is literally winning and that really is
[2:48:23.680 --> 2:48:27.600]  true every race of humans we're all connected we're all the same species but we're different
[2:48:28.160 --> 2:48:32.640]  we're different nations tribes yeah and that's what a nation is and they can trick us into that
[2:48:32.640 --> 2:48:38.560]  the devil wins yeah because he wants to get people period he wants to get he has come to steal kill
[2:48:38.560 --> 2:48:43.440]  and destroy whether you're white whether you're black whether you're brown it doesn't matter
[2:48:43.440 --> 2:48:48.160]  he wants you to die as an unbeliever so you never hear the gospel and know of christ
[2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:54.240]  so that you go straight to hell even if it's over your race people worship their race especially
[2:48:54.240 --> 2:48:59.200]  black lives matter right now they worship their skin color more than anything else in the universe
[2:48:59.200 --> 2:49:04.080]  right now and they just play into satan's hands it goes on but the big tell is don't have a family
[2:49:04.080 --> 2:49:08.000]  don't have kids yeah yeah they want to oh worship your race but don't have kids yeah and especially
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:11.600]  you know especially there's a lot of pastors right i'm very passionate against this because you have
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:16.320]  a lot of pastors a lot of christians not all of them but people that actually buy into the black

[2:50:51.680 --> 2:50:58.240]  have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away uh living defense saved my life they had me
[2:50:58.240 --> 2:51:04.400]  on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back i wanted to
[2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:10.880]  just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew 24 verse
[2:51:10.880 --> 2:51:18.560]  nine then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all
[2:51:18.560 --> 2:51:25.040]  nations for my name sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall
[2:51:25.040 --> 2:51:30.320]  hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the founding
[2:51:30.320 --> 2:51:34.960]  of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because god created this
[2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:52.400]  country you're listening to the alex jones show

[2:52:22.160 --> 2:52:27.040]  go ahead tell us your idea today okay my take on this is we're concentrating too much on what
[2:52:27.040 --> 2:52:30.400]  they're doing and not enough on what we're doing and i'm talking to patriots christians and
[2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:34.960]  conservatives where are your children all day long how did we get here you couldn't have done
[2:52:34.960 --> 2:52:39.680]  what they've done in this society if you didn't have mass institutionalized brainwashing going
[2:52:39.680 --> 2:52:44.480]  on and you can't do that when you have small community schools or local families you know
[2:52:44.480 --> 2:52:50.240]  working together kathleen austin fits solari.com she said loan to each other you know get together
[2:52:50.240 --> 2:52:54.080]  trade with each other we need to make our own platforms you got michael indellan there now
[2:52:54.080 --> 2:53:00.000]  with the new tv um my daughters are signing up with you with epic uh this is how we do it why
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:04.640]  is our content still on youtube so they can make money why are you still dealing with twitter when
[2:53:04.640 --> 2:53:10.000]  they're telling you you're not allowed to talk it's our own fault so we can stop this and i totally
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:14.560]  agree we everybody should use those platforms to direct every one of the new platform now
[2:53:14.560 --> 2:53:18.480]  i totally agree the problem is if you do the infrastructure that went into starting a big
[2:53:18.480 --> 2:53:23.760]  multimedia system they hit the software providers they hit the hardware providers they go through
[2:53:23.760 --> 2:53:27.440]  and find out who we buy equipment from and then a year in they go sorry we're not gonna update
[2:53:27.440 --> 2:53:32.320]  your your hardware we go but we have a contract they go after your contract i mean believe me it's
[2:53:32.320 --> 2:53:38.480]  it's it's it's it's harder than it looks is all i'm saying 3d me is the movement we need to get
[2:53:38.480 --> 2:53:42.960]  back to touching the earth and touching each other and and holding the baby and and and and
[2:53:42.960 --> 2:53:47.520]  planting the plants and living real life and living our life on a computer and real can you
[2:53:47.520 --> 2:53:53.040]  please talk to guy named kelby smith his advocates dot org you've got to break those contracts i
[2:53:53.040 --> 2:53:59.120]  lived this life i lived it without even breaking the contract because as i speak to each sheriff or
[2:53:59.120 --> 2:54:06.160]  whoever cps i say the truth and the truth does stand but my point is if we would you know the
[2:54:06.160 --> 2:54:11.600]  guy mentioned ala daft the reason that ala daft case was dropped it was a silver case a little
[2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:16.880]  silver case down there in texas because it was a drug law that they were using to prosecute it said
[2:54:16.880 --> 2:54:25.040]  man and other animals that's a 14th amendment little c citizen shadow that is not a man a
[2:54:25.040 --> 2:54:30.720]  child of the living god created by i'll guarantee you this new communist chinese world idea they're
[2:54:30.720 --> 2:54:34.000]  trying to put us under is definitely that the next level thank you lauren gotta move quick to

[2:54:48.160 --> 2:54:54.400]  twisted mind twisted people twisted taste twisted tongue and twisted food uh uh what's on my mind
[2:54:54.400 --> 2:55:03.760]  is this rs and the government abuse of power have the power of tax to destroy this is what's
[2:55:03.760 --> 2:55:09.760]  happening put me 10 000 rs agents down on the bottom put me five thousand at every airport
[2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:16.560]  and every person come through be single printed we'll stop this purely real quick that's a great
[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:20.400]  point if they just put the irs agents on everybody they they had the border cleaned up real quick
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:27.520]  wouldn't we yes sir you better believe it they clean up well and they put us in court that
[2:55:27.520 --> 2:55:33.440]  not even mandated by a federal government that's a great point so your point was cds you don't
[2:55:33.440 --> 2:55:38.880]  screen joe biden racism hypocrisy what's the hypocrisy i think everything biden does is a
[2:55:38.880 --> 2:55:45.520]  hypocrisy yes sir and uh he's a fugitive don't forget the word fugitive because everybody
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:49.680]  in washington dc is a fugitive right now that's why they're surrounded if you protect them
[2:55:49.680 --> 2:55:56.160]  fugitive and you got fugitive they'd be glad to go to washington dc and they would take it down
[2:55:56.160 --> 2:56:00.960]  but not only that alex we don't want to take down washington dc we just want to make sure
[2:56:00.960 --> 2:56:06.720]  that our property and our rights and our wages and our life and our family and our inheritance
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:11.920]  you protect it cds a great point call me again i'm sorry to david jj and seth call it back tomorrow
[2:56:11.920 --> 2:56:16.560]  go to the heather line that our guest house might take over but there's no doubt they know they
[2:56:16.560 --> 2:56:19.760]  stole the election there's no doubt they know they're in trouble there's no doubt they know
[2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:24.960]  they're blackmailed by the communist chinese this is a giant mess and so we don't want violence we
[2:56:24.960 --> 2:56:29.120]  want to just get the truth out and and save this country they want to trick us into bungalows
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:32.720]  that's the only chance they got a winning and that's not a chance at all so a lot of key
[2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:38.880]  stuff coming up ladies and gentlemen war room with elin shroyer in about 55 minutes we've got the
[2:56:38.880 --> 2:56:47.360]  guest host stew peters straight ahead on the other side stay with us humanity has been domesticated
[2:56:47.360 --> 2:56:52.800]  by and large the population has been trained to submit do what you're told that's all gonna pass
[2:56:52.800 --> 2:56:57.200]  but if you study authoritarians if you study the globalists you understand that they reach a point
[2:56:57.200 --> 2:57:02.000]  where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold being totally enslaved
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:06.480]  and because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid they are now making that move
[2:57:06.480 --> 2:57:11.040]  and they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third
[2:57:11.040 --> 2:57:17.360]  world that the un will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crises under such a load
[2:57:17.360 --> 2:57:22.640]  capitulate to the un whatever agreements they want us to sign hoping that they will stop the flood
[2:57:22.640 --> 2:57:28.720]  of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing coveted or climate change as the un and claus
[2:57:28.720 --> 2:57:34.800]  wobbers saying and bill gates is saying but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the un and
[2:57:34.800 --> 2:57:40.480]  bill gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more imf and world bank money
[2:57:40.480 --> 2:57:44.640]  and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist
[2:57:44.640 --> 2:57:46.640]  the
[2:57:58.320 --> 2:58:04.880]  voice media dot com today looking for real real truth in the absence of any integrity in reporting
[2:58:04.880 --> 2:58:10.960]  by today's media finding a story about top news journalist lester holt now admitting the news
[2:58:10.960 --> 2:58:17.200]  media quote doesn't actually report the news lester where have you been are you are you just now
[2:58:17.200 --> 2:58:22.880]  admitting what us honest truth-seeking real life red pill people have known all along i mean
[2:58:22.880 --> 2:58:27.600]  i didn't see this in person but according to the article uh that i don't have any problems
[2:58:27.600 --> 2:58:34.080]  believing uh lester holt actually says quote i think it's become clear that fairness is overrated
[2:58:34.080 --> 2:58:39.520]  the idea that we should always give two sides equal weight and merit does not reflect the world
[2:58:39.520 --> 2:58:44.480]  we find ourselves in hey folks welcome back to the ouch joneshow my name is stu peters maybe
[2:58:44.480 --> 2:58:49.520]  lester is on to something there i mean uh let's not be shocked folks we do the same thing over here
[2:58:50.400 --> 2:58:54.640]  don't we discredit the narrative of lester holt and his so-called major broadcast network over
[2:58:54.640 --> 2:58:59.920]  there at nbc i mean we know that they're hacks we know it's almost comical to watch as these lying
[2:58:59.920 --> 2:59:04.560]  drive by feminized worthless cucks have nothing to talk about since the political assassination
[2:59:04.560 --> 2:59:10.080]  of president donald trump since the coup d'etat by nancy polosi chuck schumer and the radical
[2:59:10.080 --> 2:59:15.120]  progressive aiming at depopulation killing off christians and patriots killing their own babies
[2:59:15.120 --> 2:59:20.640]  and injecting poison into every one of us to accomplish their goals uh as old lester or any
[2:59:20.640 --> 2:59:27.120]  one of these neutered and demasculinized uh order takers demasculinized there it is order takers
[2:59:27.760 --> 2:59:32.320]  ever dared to question the installed regime about the push for this vaccination what about the
[2:59:32.320 --> 2:59:38.000]  passports the attack on the uh first amendment the tax hikes like nothing we've seen since the 1940s
[2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:44.240]  the confiscation of guns the transgender flag flying at the white house during holy week this is
[2:59:44.240 --> 2:59:50.160]  this is a directed attack has less sold less over there has he ever put on his makeup and sat down
[2:59:50.160 --> 2:59:54.400]  in front of biden to ask any real questions how about the rest of the media i mean other than
[2:59:54.400 --> 2:59:59.360]  hard-hitting stuff about favorite colors flavors of ice cream and how to get the dogs to stop
[2:59:59.360 --> 3:00:05.200]  defecating on the white house floor has the media reported on the record increase of sex
[3:00:05.200 --> 3:00:10.560]  offenders crossing the border as confirmed by a border patrol agent now we saw yesterday project
[3:00:10.560 --> 3:00:16.960]  veritas interviewed that agent uh who claimed that leak government documents show a record spike
[3:00:16.960 --> 3:00:22.320]  in sex offender encounters at the border james o keith who was congratulated by president trump
[3:00:22.320 --> 3:00:28.160]  recently he released the video on wednesday uh or excuse me i guess it was yesterday thursday in
[3:00:28.160 --> 3:00:33.440]  which the agent explained that there's been an increase in sex offenders since the start of the
[3:00:33.440 --> 3:00:40.240]  covid 19 pandemic the big distraction the fear tactic used to take the attention away from a
[3:00:40.240 --> 3:00:46.720]  stolen election which didn't work because we all know the politicized flu being used to control us
[3:00:46.720 --> 3:00:53.680]  without any of us ever really questioning anything which isn't working because we all know the virus
[3:00:53.680 --> 3:00:59.200]  that virtually everyone who legitimately has it survives over 99.8 but they've tried to pull the
[3:00:59.200 --> 3:01:04.400]  wool over the eyes of unsuspecting americans by lying about the infection rate which isn't working
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:11.040]  because we all know not only arresting law-abiding citizens in the name of health and safety but
[3:01:11.040 --> 3:01:16.320]  now taking our kids away from us if we resist muzzling ourselves with suffocating burkas
[3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:22.400]  and in florida the open state actually seizing a business we'll get more into that as we'll talk
[3:01:22.400 --> 3:01:27.680]  to a man whose whole life has been turned upside down he's been arrested three times his wife has
[3:01:27.680 --> 3:01:32.240]  been arrested the media by the way hasn't touched any of this they've never broken a single law
[3:01:33.440 --> 3:01:37.280]  it's coming up in just a little bit here on the alex joneshow at bandness.tv and more
[3:01:37.280 --> 3:01:43.600]  as we continue to peel back the rind of protection meant to cover the fruit of truth as liberals
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:49.120]  desperately try to insert themselves i think between your eyes retina and your brain as if
[3:01:49.120 --> 3:01:54.960]  to somehow disrupt a logical process of thought when you know what you're seeing and you know
[3:01:54.960 --> 3:01:59.200]  what you're hearing we'll talk with this guy mike carnival is his name today uh as he's standing in
[3:01:59.200 --> 3:02:03.280]  the face of tyranny he's fighting back really fighting isn't just a trending hashtag or cute
[3:02:03.280 --> 3:02:08.400]  saying anymore people we really need to take this seriously also the most banned individual on the
[3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:12.720]  face of the planet i don't think alex jones would even argue that laura lumer is even more banned
[3:02:12.720 --> 3:02:18.320]  than this network this program than that man uh this is going on in florida folks the open state
[3:02:18.320 --> 3:02:23.840]  how are command staffs and law enforcement agencies getting away with this brown shirt like attack on
[3:02:23.840 --> 3:02:30.320]  free citizens in america how is the judiciary doing this in a state where ron disantis has led
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:36.400]  the common sense charge supported the great awakening i want to talk to lumer about that
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:42.000]  she's uh she's running in the 21st district of florida as a congressional candidate and i hope she
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:46.640]  has answers again folks my name is stew peters here in the alex joneshow the unafraid america
[3:02:46.640 --> 3:02:50.800]  first patriot who will never ignore a vetted whistleblower and will die on the hill of truth
[3:02:50.800 --> 3:02:54.800]  before i cave to any political pressure banning threats of removal or deplatforming and even
[3:02:54.800 --> 3:02:59.280]  the death threats folks you can always count on me uh and you can find me at red voice media dot
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:03.440]  com to bring it real and raw by the way if you have a story that you think that i need to hear

[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:11.840]  if you so wish coming up in just a few minutes we're going to talk to that man in florida who's
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:17.120]  been arrested three times his wife has been arrested the assault on mike carnaval has continued as
[3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:22.080]  corrupt judges and police command staffs have been allowed to violate the fundamental constitutional
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:27.200]  rights guaranteed to every american here in our supposedly free republic again he's lost literally
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:32.880]  everything the media will tell you nothing about it they'll tell you uh that uh mike carnaval is
[3:03:32.880 --> 3:03:37.760]  dangerous that you and i are dangerous just like him we believe in the america first way of thinking
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:43.760]  any one of us would die in a second before we would give up our freedom because we're patriots
[3:03:44.560 --> 3:03:50.880]  and that won't be tolerated in this authoritarian transformation looking to castrate and neuter
[3:03:50.880 --> 3:03:56.000]  anyone with a voice of opposition against the radicals that are toppling our entire political
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:04:01.440]  system this isn't about democrats anymore because true democrats don't really exist
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:08.160]  we republicans either checks and balances are totally gone and this once free country has fallen
[3:04:08.160 --> 3:04:13.360]  to stolen elections all over the place not just in the presidency but in senate races right on down
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:18.400]  to the state and local elections that were fraudulently schemed no different than in other
[3:04:18.400 --> 3:04:23.120]  totalitarian ruled third world countries where dictatorships have gone on check for years take
[3:04:23.120 --> 3:04:28.640]  venezuela for instance using the same exact technology in that country to install leadership
[3:04:28.640 --> 3:04:34.400]  for decades and we have it right here these weak republicans are running around the border right now
[3:04:34.960 --> 3:04:39.520]  pretending that they recognize a crisis ladies and gentlemen they spent years in control with
[3:04:39.520 --> 3:04:45.280]  the majority of power in our federal government and didn't do a damn thing they carried the flag
[3:04:45.280 --> 3:04:51.360]  for president trump in the wide open for the public to see but behind closed doors they were
[3:04:51.360 --> 3:04:56.560]  just as responsible for his political assassination as those that we want to point a finger at now
[3:04:56.560 --> 3:05:02.960]  these fake phonies stood up in front of the entire country and certified a stolen election they did
[3:05:02.960 --> 3:05:08.960]  that and we're all just expected to move forward just move away from the 2020 coup led by radical
[3:05:08.960 --> 3:05:13.680]  terrorists that have now infiltrated our government system we've been warned about this and those of
[3:05:13.680 --> 3:05:20.800]  us with a platform have spent decades warning you all about it the distractions of civil war like
[3:05:20.800 --> 3:05:24.800]  alex was talking about like his previous guest was talking about coming up next in the war room
[3:05:24.800 --> 3:05:30.160]  with oan shroyer as well this is this is baiting this is this is exactly what they want us to do
[3:05:30.800 --> 3:05:35.680]  the distractions of of civil war and division the distractions of transgenderism and acceptance
[3:05:35.680 --> 3:05:41.840]  critical race theory and fun hashtags like systemic racism it's meant for nothing more
[3:05:41.840 --> 3:05:48.480]  than to divide us folks because we all know it's a lie we know and we understand that the united
[3:05:48.480 --> 3:05:52.720]  states of america is the greatest republic on the face of the planet but the left doesn't want you
[3:05:52.720 --> 3:05:58.160]  to ever admit that instead they want you to feel guilt and shame for being a white christian or
[3:05:58.160 --> 3:06:03.120]  someone that stands for freedom and liberty there's just no way around being subjected to that attack
[3:06:03.120 --> 3:06:08.000]  unless you admit that you're a racist denounce your testosterone or denounce your love of country
[3:06:08.720 --> 3:06:14.560]  you're supposed to idly sit by well child pedophilia and sex trafficking of our kids is taking
[3:06:14.560 --> 3:06:20.800]  place right in front of our eyes it's happening in hollywood but we still support them and they're
[3:06:20.800 --> 3:06:26.560]  being protected by washington dc because of the inflation of bribery study up on that the inflation
[3:06:26.560 --> 3:06:32.320]  of bribery look that up they all have photographic evidence of one another participating in criminal
[3:06:32.320 --> 3:06:36.800]  activity and the most horrific activity you can imagine as it relates to our kids the most precious
[3:06:36.800 --> 3:06:41.760]  gifts from god they're not trying to hide it they're not they're not trying to roadblock
[3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:47.440]  they're getting away with it because nobody has the testicular fortitude to name names
[3:06:47.440 --> 3:06:53.600]  and come forward with what they have folks i'm talking to you i'm begging you if you have it give
[3:06:53.600 --> 3:06:58.160]  it to me i'll do it i'll take that flag i'll run that evidence all the way up that pole i'll show the
[3:06:58.160 --> 3:07:02.480]  world and i will die on that hill alone if need be but i cannot sit by any longer while our kids
[3:07:02.480 --> 3:07:06.720]  are indoctrinated in school and told that they're somehow closely related to the devil because they're
[3:07:06.720 --> 3:07:11.120]  white they believe in god they love our country they embrace freedom they enjoy spending time with
[3:07:11.120 --> 3:07:15.600]  mommy and daddy they prefer the opposite sex and they don't want to wear a mask while they play sports
[3:07:15.600 --> 3:07:19.920]  or sit in a classroom where they're supposed to be objectively learning about our history
[3:07:19.920 --> 3:07:25.120]  mathematics science and learning how to navigate a social environment make friends and enjoy the
[3:07:25.120 --> 3:07:29.920]  innocence of a childhood this is all going on right here and the assault isn't just limited
[3:07:29.920 --> 3:07:34.240]  to the classroom indoctrination it's coming for you it's coming for mainstream america it's coming
[3:07:34.240 --> 3:07:38.640]  for the backbone of the united states economy it's coming for the small business and anybody else
[3:07:38.640 --> 3:07:42.960]  who previously succeeded on their own without the hand of the government we'll talk to one next
[3:07:42.960 --> 3:07:51.040]  epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association
[3:07:51.040 --> 3:07:55.120]  and they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies
[3:07:55.120 --> 3:08:00.400]  and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering that's why they've been massively
[3:08:00.400 --> 3:08:04.880]  expanding their services so whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want
[3:08:04.880 --> 3:08:09.840]  help building a website or want servers or any other major service they've got it all and they're
[3:08:09.840 --> 3:08:16.240]  expanding and if you go to info wars domains dot com and follow that link you get all their services
[3:08:16.240 --> 3:08:22.480]  at the lowest price and 25 percent of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to
[3:08:22.480 --> 3:08:27.680]  fund the info war then we get five percent as well for any servers or any other type of services
[3:08:27.680 --> 3:08:32.560]  that you get from them so it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because
[3:08:32.560 --> 3:08:38.560]  the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free so info wars domains dot com the
[3:08:38.560 --> 3:08:45.280]  revolution starts there info wars domains dot com take action now the equation is very simple
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:53.120]  the bank of banks control the media they control big pharma they control academia they control the
[3:08:53.120 --> 3:08:59.200]  military industrial complex they control big tech and everywhere that they have been in control
[3:08:59.760 --> 3:09:05.360]  in the third world they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization
[3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:11.920]  it is the western christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[3:09:11.920 --> 3:09:16.160]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them so because they can't defeat
[3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:23.760]  that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and use the idea of equality
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:29.600]  to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly so control
[3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:34.880]  that's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them
[3:09:34.880 --> 3:09:40.240]  but the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video
[3:09:40.240 --> 3:09:42.400]  so we double your efforts we're all in this together
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:48.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:09:48.640 --> 3:10:04.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:10.480]  well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[3:10:10.480 --> 3:10:17.840]  i don't know you're coming here stew peters here on the alex jones show ban this dot tv
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:22.080]  you can find me more of me at red voice media dot com it's kind of like stew peters tv over
[3:10:22.080 --> 3:10:26.720]  there i was just talking about the assault on our kids but it's not just limited to the classroom
[3:10:26.720 --> 3:10:31.920]  indoctrination that some in the media will dare to talk about specifically well i guess just alex
[3:10:31.920 --> 3:10:37.840]  and myself but this is this is massive well thought out scientifically planned attack
[3:10:37.840 --> 3:10:44.800]  to choke out the alpha male and to get us out of the way for their final phase of this takeover
[3:10:44.800 --> 3:10:49.840]  just look around at everything crumbling the things that we see the stuff that has us standing in
[3:10:49.840 --> 3:10:55.120]  front of the mirror trying to convince ourselves that we aren't crazy and how the normal level headed
[3:10:55.680 --> 3:11:00.960]  critically thinking sane adult is dealing with all of this nonsense and now imagine being a child
[3:11:01.680 --> 3:11:07.200]  with absolutely no clue and trying to process why are we locked down why can't we see our
[3:11:07.200 --> 3:11:11.840]  families where's grandma and grandpa forced into oxygen depriving muzzles and taught to resist my
[3:11:11.840 --> 3:11:16.160]  whiteness become a traitor to the whites and strive for the ultimate achievement as i'm pushed
[3:11:16.160 --> 3:11:21.520]  to this transformation into white abolitionists they're actually teaching our kids right out in
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:26.800]  the wide open that whites should be abolished removed gone taken away from the classroom taken
[3:11:26.800 --> 3:11:31.360]  out of the workplace sports teams and the country white people should be eradicated from the world
[3:11:31.360 --> 3:11:38.400]  completely and until that goal is achieved there will be hell to pay you could pay for it by going
[3:11:38.400 --> 3:11:41.920]  to jail you could pay for it with fines and sanctions you could lose your business millions
[3:11:41.920 --> 3:11:48.240]  of dollars are being raked in by these criminal liars like this ebram kendi a man that grew up
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:11:52.000]  with both of his parents in the home they're nicely retired now their ministers in their community
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:56.320]  they had nice incomes kendi was able to go to private school for most of his life and then
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:12:01.040]  went to elite schools for a post-secondary education where he received multiple degrees i think a
[3:12:01.040 --> 3:12:06.640]  couple of bs degrees and a master's degree the guy is a professor at boston college he's married
[3:12:06.640 --> 3:12:12.320]  to a doctor he's never struggled for a single day in his life he's never wanted for anything
[3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:17.360]  but he's a victim he's been held back due to nothing other than the color of his skin and he
[3:12:17.360 --> 3:12:24.160]  struggles to stay barely surviving or get by in the ghetto all the fault of his former white
[3:12:24.160 --> 3:12:29.520]  classmates the white people in our society and white cops especially white cops are probably
[3:12:29.520 --> 3:12:33.280]  what has oppressed him for his entire life which is why he's a millionaire making regular appearances
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:37.840]  on big major broadcast networks as he enriches himself at the cost of real impoverished black
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:42.480]  lives in real struggling neighborhoods where real mothers are struggling to raise their kids due
[3:12:42.480 --> 3:12:46.960]  to the intentional failed liberal policies that have been carefully designed to keep them under
[3:12:46.960 --> 3:12:50.640]  the thumb of the government that they look up to for help on the first day of every month and
[3:12:50.640 --> 3:12:56.080]  don't you dare vote for that republican because all of that will go away and if you're struggling too
[3:12:56.080 --> 3:13:00.160]  much let's hold your hand we can go to that clinic where the taxpayers will fund the murder of your
[3:13:00.160 --> 3:13:04.000]  unborn child we can't bring another one here and by the way don't have kids anymore we're going to
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:09.360]  replace them with immigrants we're at a point where i think the option of becoming two states
[3:13:09.360 --> 3:13:14.800]  really isn't that far fetched uh this has been this has actually been talked about and although
[3:13:14.800 --> 3:13:19.120]  i would have previously said this was total lunacy i mean let's think about what these two
[3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:22.480]  states might look like and you can make the determination about where you would like to live
[3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:27.760]  if you're on one hand you would have a mask the rest of your life okay you would stay away from
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:31.600]  your family you'd apologize for your whiteness or just rid of white people all together we discuss
[3:13:31.600 --> 3:13:37.520]  that you'll always have a safe place to cry the majority of what you work for will go to the
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:42.720]  government right so that they can develop programs and initiate things and then those programs will
[3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:49.040]  in turn tell you what to think where to shop what to buy what sports teams to support when to take
[3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:53.520]  a knee when you're allowed to go to the game how many people you're allowed to gather with at any
[3:13:53.520 --> 3:13:58.320]  given time what sex you're gonna be don't forget that uh just because you were allowed the privilege
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:02.960]  to be born here into our state that doesn't mean that just because you were born with a penis that
[3:14:02.960 --> 3:14:08.800]  you're able to keep it or stay a male you will embrace these new hormones we're going to inject
[3:14:08.800 --> 3:14:13.120]  you with them and there's no need to call the police because oh they don't exist the police
[3:14:13.120 --> 3:14:18.960]  have been defunded here they're gone but these social workers will help you they'll help work
[3:14:18.960 --> 3:14:24.800]  out your differences of which you should have none because we have all the answers for you
[3:14:26.160 --> 3:14:30.080]  just refer to the notes there that we handed you during your education camp at camp covet
[3:14:30.800 --> 3:14:36.000]  and these light bulbs uh that that you'll install in your home they were made from the earth right
[3:14:36.800 --> 3:14:40.560]  at the expense of everyone else here no need for a private sector job because everything
[3:14:40.560 --> 3:14:45.520]  is formed by the government which protects you and your country with pregnant pilots flying
[3:14:45.520 --> 3:14:50.560]  in pink jets with vaccine bombs made from earth and sea friendly recycled materials by immigrants
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:55.120]  in third world countries that by the way you will be supporting i mean come on what does this really
[3:14:55.120 --> 3:14:59.280]  look like can we imagine a world like that of course not nobody wants to live like that and
[3:14:59.280 --> 3:15:04.720]  anyone that tells you that they do is mentally castrated they've already been owned by these people
[3:15:05.520 --> 3:15:09.520]  or they're just so damn stupid they can't embrace reality either way they need a mental
[3:15:09.520 --> 3:15:13.600]  health evaluation and we have to get back to the truth we have to get back to understanding
[3:15:13.600 --> 3:15:16.800]  that we're going to be forced to take the helm take control of these people
[3:15:17.600 --> 3:15:22.320]  or they're going to continue to run us over we're going to talk with mike carnavale now he's been
[3:15:22.320 --> 3:15:26.880]  run over by these ideologues in broward county florida the open state he's been arrested three
[3:15:26.880 --> 3:15:32.720]  times but it didn't stop there this is shocking folks mike carnavale welcome to the alex jones
[3:15:32.720 --> 3:15:38.560]  show here at ban this dot tv and we appreciate you coming thank you for having me you're in
[3:15:38.560 --> 3:15:43.920]  broward county florida you're a gym owner uh you were shut down by the original mandates
[3:15:43.920 --> 3:15:48.000]  and restrictions you decided that you were going to stay open you have been arrested not once not
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:53.600]  twice but three times your wife has been arrested you have never broken one single law take us through
[3:15:53.600 --> 3:16:01.520]  this so broward county reopened with some bizarre guidelines which i was following due to optics
[3:16:01.520 --> 3:16:06.720]  but the more we seem to comply in corrupt broward county the further they went when they
[3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:12.080]  mandated facial coverings during strenuous fitness activities that's when i put my foot down and i
[3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:17.200]  said i will not be enforcing this it's a manipulation of government and it's a travesty of public health
[3:16:17.760 --> 3:16:21.200]  so they were asking you to make the people inside of your gym wear masks while they were
[3:16:21.200 --> 3:16:25.440]  exerting themselves while they were working out in the name of public health it's really
[3:16:25.440 --> 3:16:30.800]  unbelievable it's hard to believe but this is what public health was in 2020 going into this
[3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:34.960]  now we want your healthy so we're going to make you cover up your face while you go and increase
[3:16:34.960 --> 3:16:39.920]  your heart rate and uh and sprint and do cardio and lift weights we're going to make you wear these
[3:16:39.920 --> 3:16:43.600]  these masks that you can't you can't breathe so you decide that you're not going to enforce it
[3:16:43.600 --> 3:16:48.480]  next thing you know the brown shirts are at your door what happens so i filed a lawsuit
[3:16:48.480 --> 3:16:54.720]  with anthony sabbatini against broward county 24 hours later in direct retaliation to my civil
[3:16:54.720 --> 3:17:00.640]  lawsuit police were sent to my gym to close me down respectfully i told them that i wouldn't be
[3:17:00.640 --> 3:17:06.080]  complying and i left in handcuffs that day you said that you had a seven-hour standoff with
[3:17:06.080 --> 3:17:11.040]  these people what do you mean by a standoff what does that mean so it was it was a uh an ongoing
[3:17:11.040 --> 3:17:14.800]  negotiation back and forth where i was telling them that i wasn't going to be closing under any
[3:17:14.800 --> 3:17:20.480]  circumstances and they were of the mindset that they could convince me to close and when they
[3:17:20.480 --> 3:17:24.480]  realized that it was coming to a head that's when they pulled the plug on it and they took me out
[3:17:24.480 --> 3:17:30.000]  in handcuffs it was an all-day affair and it ended up with me leaving then they come back a second
[3:17:30.000 --> 3:17:36.000]  time they tell you that you have to remain closed for 24 hours you you closed for 24 hours you go
[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:40.400]  back to this place you're open again they come back a second time and they arrest you then they
[3:17:40.400 --> 3:17:44.560]  come back a third time now on the third time where it gets really interesting you had actually taken
[3:17:44.560 --> 3:17:49.040]  you and your employees there had taken the equipment from the inside of your gym and you moved it
[3:17:49.040 --> 3:17:55.760]  outside outdoors you're outside now and the police come by again and now this time they arrest you
[3:17:55.760 --> 3:18:01.760]  and your wife in about 20 seconds take us through that so in an effort to be diplomatic we pulled
[3:18:01.760 --> 3:18:06.560]  our equipment outside and that's not good enough for the loony left uh there's no negotiating with
[3:18:06.560 --> 3:18:11.040]  this people there's no meeting them halfway they won't stop until there's absolutely nothing left
[3:18:11.040 --> 3:18:15.920]  to our rights they arrested me they arrested my wife in one of the most grotesque unconstitutional
[3:18:15.920 --> 3:18:22.080]  things you'll ever see in your life yeah and it doesn't stop there uh with your story which is why
[3:18:22.080 --> 3:18:25.360]  i want to hold you over i hope you have time to come back because i'm running up against a hard
[3:18:25.360 --> 3:18:31.040]  break here i gotta pay some bills but mike carnaval is your entire life has been turned upside down
[3:18:31.040 --> 3:18:35.760]  arrested not once not twice but three times your wife was been arrested you never had a previous
[3:18:35.760 --> 3:18:40.800]  criminal history and the next step that they would take is going to shock you coming up next in the
[3:18:40.800 --> 3:18:46.880]  alice jones show you know listeners call into the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:18:47.600 --> 3:18:53.200]  because i sit there and i beg you for support constantly for prayer for financial support
[3:18:53.200 --> 3:18:58.160]  and for word of mouth and then we're all this together and i you know it gets old having to

[3:19:11.040 --> 3:19:15.440]  they've crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order
[3:19:15.440 --> 3:19:19.920]  comes out in the open our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken off there that's

[3:20:38.080 --> 3:20:48.560]  i've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air about looking at the world
[3:20:48.560 --> 3:20:52.640]  from the perspective of the globalist that the public's so dumbed down that they don't care
[3:20:52.640 --> 3:20:56.720]  that we're stealing their future from them that we're poisoning them that we're sterilizing them
[3:20:56.720 --> 3:21:01.920]  that they deserve to be killed yes that's the position of the globalist they play god and
[3:21:01.920 --> 3:21:08.400]  they think because we don't stand up they have a right to do this to us you know i've told you that
[3:21:08.400 --> 3:21:12.640]  the globalists have tried to hire me they try to get me to join them but metaphysically at a spiritual
[3:21:12.640 --> 3:21:18.640]  level i have the holy spirit i'm connection with gods and i know that god does not like that so i
[3:21:18.640 --> 3:21:24.480]  cannot join the enemy but i'll tell you at a selfish level i get very very mad at people
[3:21:24.480 --> 3:21:28.560]  that go along with the system believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power on them
[3:21:28.560 --> 3:21:34.160]  whether you're just a steel worker or a school teacher or a Henry Kissinger you're not god
[3:21:35.040 --> 3:21:40.080]  and treating other people like they're animals and you're god is something that the real god
[3:21:40.080 --> 3:21:45.600]  of the universe doesn't like and that's a fact you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very
[3:21:45.600 --> 3:21:50.400]  better sweet everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we
[3:21:50.400 --> 3:21:53.600]  have a lot of credibility but i don't care about that i care about beating the new world order
[3:21:53.600 --> 3:21:58.880]  and it's because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much longer
[3:21:58.880 --> 3:22:02.640]  and i don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't
[3:22:02.640 --> 3:22:06.640]  tell you what's going on but let's just say this we're going to see this through the end
[3:22:06.640 --> 3:22:11.840]  we're gonna stay on air as long as we can so please pray for us and please buy the products

[3:22:57.680 --> 3:23:05.120]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex
[3:23:05.120 --> 3:23:13.840]  jones and welcome back to the alex jones show my name is stew peters ban this dot tv you can find
[3:23:13.840 --> 3:23:18.720]  more of stew peters at red voice media dot com we're talking with mike carnaval he was arrested
[3:23:18.720 --> 3:23:23.280]  not once not twice but three times his wife was arrested never previously had a criminal history
[3:23:23.280 --> 3:23:28.240]  he embraces law enforcement he supports them backs the blue never really broke any laws
[3:23:29.040 --> 3:23:34.880]  but that's not where the assault stopped now if you don't fall in line with the tyrannical left
[3:23:34.880 --> 3:23:40.160]  if you don't fall in line with the with the regime they're going to come after your pocket books
[3:23:40.160 --> 3:23:42.960]  they're going to come after you in any way that you can our next guest is going to talk about
[3:23:42.960 --> 3:23:47.680]  that as well laura loomer who has been so banned it's unbelievable they've come after her pocket
[3:23:47.680 --> 3:23:52.320]  books it's way it's unprecedented the way that they have attacked laura loomer but this is all
[3:23:52.320 --> 3:23:56.560]  interestingly enough going on in florida where the state is supposed to be open ronda santhas has
[3:23:56.560 --> 3:24:03.280]  really pioneered and led the country kind of giving an example of look we can do this we can be open
[3:24:03.280 --> 3:24:07.440]  right we can be working out we can have the restaurants open we can take these masks off
[3:24:07.440 --> 3:24:11.680]  and when you look around at the rest of the country as far as infection rates are concerned and
[3:24:11.680 --> 3:24:16.720]  florida being one of the most elderly populated states in the entire union but yet we're not
[3:24:16.720 --> 3:24:21.360]  stepping over bodies like cordwood down there people aren't just falling over dead the narrative
[3:24:21.360 --> 3:24:26.400]  being more and more disproven every single day but that didn't stop them from coming after you
[3:24:27.120 --> 3:24:32.080]  and uh so when they three in jail the first time they said yeah you're going to close your business
[3:24:32.080 --> 3:24:36.080]  for 24 hours and they they came back they three in jail a second time now you're going to close it
[3:24:36.080 --> 3:24:40.080]  for 96 hours and then they came back a third time and they told you you're going to close this thing
[3:24:40.080 --> 3:24:46.800]  down for a week now they have done the unthinkable mike carnival joining us back on the alice jon show
[3:24:46.800 --> 3:24:51.760]  mike tell us what they have done now so after they arrested me for the third time that's when
[3:24:51.760 --> 3:24:57.360]  governor ronda santhas put out his right to work order and it was seemingly over but the looney
[3:24:57.360 --> 3:25:02.320]  left and brawler connie continues to push the envelope and skirt gray areas of the law and of
[3:25:02.320 --> 3:25:08.320]  executive orders what they did was they filed a writ of possession using the landlord of my
[3:25:08.320 --> 3:25:14.160]  building to leverage me out of my business judge natasha deprimo who was seen on a political flyer
[3:25:14.160 --> 3:25:19.760]  with congresswoman debbie wasam and sheltz signed off on the writ of possession leveraging me out
[3:25:19.760 --> 3:25:25.200]  of my life savings and everything i've ever worked for in my entire life okay so now in this inside
[3:25:25.200 --> 3:25:29.920]  of the gym presumably you have equipment that you own uh or that you're leasing or something like
[3:25:29.920 --> 3:25:33.600]  that what happens to every possession that's inside of there certainly you were allowed to go back
[3:25:33.600 --> 3:25:37.440]  and get that so that you can liquidate that and try to salvage some of your financial with all
[3:25:38.800 --> 3:25:43.520]  so i had over a quarter million dollars worth of equipment in that that uh building that i own
[3:25:43.520 --> 3:25:49.680]  outright i was not able to recover any of it and i had the police called on me just trying to receive
[3:25:49.680 --> 3:25:54.560]  personal chateau from the property and uh the whole thing is an absolute travesty it's a real
[3:25:54.560 --> 3:26:01.520]  dystopian nightmare in corrupt rower county okay so uh this natasha deprimo you say that you uh
[3:26:01.520 --> 3:26:06.800]  found her on some sort of a political flyer with debbie wasam and sheltz this was a uh what kind of
[3:26:06.800 --> 3:26:12.080]  a flyer was this i mean who is she aligning herself with or judges really allowed to do this i mean
[3:26:12.080 --> 3:26:15.040]  are they allowed to just be out there i mean they're elected representatives but they can
[3:26:15.040 --> 3:26:20.880]  align politically out there on campaign ads yeah that's correct the uh the campaign laws
[3:26:20.880 --> 3:26:26.240]  that they violate in corrupt rower county is just absolutely never ending it was a democratic flyer
[3:26:26.240 --> 3:26:31.840]  with judges commissioners and congress people alike and uh the whole thing is highly illegal
[3:26:31.840 --> 3:26:38.160]  top to bottom the game is rigged in brod okay we have covered brod county i know that alex
[3:26:38.160 --> 3:26:44.880]  has covered brod county as well we talked with a woman there who had her child taken away from her
[3:26:44.880 --> 3:26:49.600]  her child was taken away from her in the name of health and safety as these tyrants took over to
[3:26:49.600 --> 3:26:54.480]  control down there that was judge dale c cohen who then had to recuse himself after taking uh
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:26:58.880]  melanie michael joseph's son from her in the name of health and safety and this was because of a
[3:26:58.880 --> 3:27:04.800]  facebook post where she had her her mask off she was outdoors and this was pre-mandate time
[3:27:04.800 --> 3:27:08.720]  so i want to you touched on something interesting mike you talked about the governor signing the
[3:27:08.720 --> 3:27:15.760]  right to work act what does that exactly mean so long story short that order says that you cannot
[3:27:15.760 --> 3:27:23.840]  close or find small business due to covet restrictions that's what it means okay so any uh any restrictions
[3:27:23.840 --> 3:27:28.560]  that were violated i'm reading here that uh previous violations or current violations would be
[3:27:28.560 --> 3:27:34.880]  forgiven any sanctions that were previously uh handed out would be forgiven and then any business
[3:27:34.880 --> 3:27:40.240]  in the future that violates any of these previous restrictions that were then lifted by this right
[3:27:40.240 --> 3:27:48.160]  to work uh would not take place is that correct that is correct uh but braver county they misinterpret
[3:27:48.160 --> 3:27:53.600]  these orders and they uh they misread them and they interpret them however they they care to please
[3:27:53.600 --> 3:27:59.840]  to do so and that's what they're doing that's what they're doing what's next for my carnival
[3:28:01.040 --> 3:28:06.400]  so i have a calendar call coming up on may 18th they'll be selecting jurors and things of that
[3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:11.360]  nature down the line and it's eventually going to trial and if you continue to follow the story
[3:28:11.360 --> 3:28:18.080]  go to mike carnival.com to follow the story we're gonna see just how corrupt braver county is
[3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:24.480]  it's absolutely top to bottom now you've looked at you've looked at jail time already so you were
[3:28:24.480 --> 3:28:30.080]  jailed uh on three three separate occasions here yeah the first time you were brought there overnight
[3:28:30.080 --> 3:28:35.360]  now uh i'm looking here and it doesn't appear that you have been arraigned on any charges it
[3:28:35.360 --> 3:28:40.080]  doesn't look like they uh you've even had an appearance before the court no omnibus hearing
[3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:45.840]  no hearing to discuss these charges so what actually have you been charged with failure to
[3:28:45.840 --> 3:28:51.680]  comply with an emergency order is the official charge it's it's similar to some type of hurricane
[3:28:51.680 --> 3:28:55.680]  disaster preparedness order it's a total manipulation of government there's nothing
[3:28:55.680 --> 3:29:01.520]  constitutional or legal about it but it doesn't stop the loony left in braver county from weaponizing
[3:29:01.520 --> 3:29:07.840]  the judicial system against me with it they had to look for a law something uh that i'm speculating
[3:29:07.840 --> 3:29:13.360]  was put into act or enacted many many years ago for a purpose completely different like you said
[3:29:13.360 --> 3:29:19.920]  hurricane preparedness maybe you don't follow the evacuation evacuation mandate maybe you stay in
[3:29:19.920 --> 3:29:24.480]  place when you're not supposed to or don't when you are supposed to and so this is what they've
[3:29:24.480 --> 3:29:28.480]  done they had to dig really deep in the statute book to find something to charge you with so on
[3:29:28.480 --> 3:29:33.120]  all three occasions that you went to jail you still have yet to actually be in court to address
[3:29:33.120 --> 3:29:39.840]  these these uh charges or face your accuser i just had my first court case last month on a zoom
[3:29:39.840 --> 3:29:46.400]  call i do not consent to a trial on a zoom call it is out of my hands at this point and yeah that's
[3:29:46.400 --> 3:29:52.320]  correct have you sought legal representation has anybody uh had your back throughout any of this
[3:29:53.120 --> 3:29:57.440]  so attorney quarry stroller in palm beach county is one of the only criminal defense
[3:29:57.440 --> 3:30:01.360]  attorneys who wanted to fight corrupt brawler county all the way to the end which is an alignment
[3:30:01.360 --> 3:30:06.480]  with my values i spoke to probably nine other attorneys they all wanted me to take the 10 day
[3:30:06.480 --> 3:30:11.520]  plea deal that brawler county was offering me i will not be negotiating with the radical left
[3:30:11.520 --> 3:30:16.800]  and i won't be taking a plea deal for the crime of me operating my small business so they're
[3:30:16.800 --> 3:30:21.200]  they're telling you okay this this will all go away if you just do 10 days in jail 10 days in
[3:30:21.200 --> 3:30:26.320]  jail for violating this emergency declaration is what they're saying is that right that's correct
[3:30:26.320 --> 3:30:31.520]  stew they really want that headline you know jail owner uh 10 days in jail they uh business owner
[3:30:31.520 --> 3:30:35.760]  10 days in jail they want that headline and they're not going to get it they're not going to get it
[3:30:35.760 --> 3:30:43.360]  from me okay so what is this 180 days this six months in prison that you're supposedly looking at
[3:30:44.800 --> 3:30:51.600]  so the maximum penalty is 60 days in jail per violation as you have discussed i have been arrested
[3:30:51.600 --> 3:30:56.880]  three times now so 60 times three that's what i'm looking at i'm looking at six months in jail
[3:30:57.520 --> 3:31:02.400]  for not enforcing facial coverings during strenuous activities at the gym this is a
[3:31:02.400 --> 3:31:07.120]  public health issue this is a small business issue and i want to thank everyone out there for
[3:31:07.120 --> 3:31:12.560]  understanding that i will be backing down under absolutely no circumstances have you thought about
[3:31:12.560 --> 3:31:19.840]  running for office you know uh it's it's i don't i don't rule that out but at this moment in time
[3:31:19.840 --> 3:31:24.160]  we're going to just go one day at a time sometimes stew i'm even one hour at a time over here i'm
[3:31:24.160 --> 3:31:28.880]  trying to get through this criminal case but i'm very open-minded all right where can people go

[3:37:14.800 --> 3:37:19.440]  you can find the unafraid truth that i report on every single day again red voice media dot com
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:24.080]  we appreciate humbly appreciate all the traffic and increase that we've seen over there we really
[3:37:24.080 --> 3:37:28.800]  appreciate it and i and we know that you do as well really hard to find real news which is why
[3:37:28.800 --> 3:37:32.800]  you're here at bandness dot tv and why we're seeing you over at red voice media dot com it's no
[3:37:32.800 --> 3:37:38.000]  surprise to me that people are hungry and thirsty for the truth laura lumar you know that name
[3:37:38.640 --> 3:37:42.560]  you know that name because she is a congressional candidate she's an america first candidate she
[3:37:42.560 --> 3:37:49.920]  stands boldly on her own too now she's been deep platform even alex jones will agree i he's probably
[3:37:49.920 --> 3:37:54.320]  laughing as he's listening to this but he'll probably agree that laura lumar has been more
[3:37:54.320 --> 3:37:59.920]  aggressively banned and was first banned uh prior to his uh prolific ban but the aggressive
[3:37:59.920 --> 3:38:03.840]  deplatforming of journalist and congressional candidate laura lumar as i'm reading in this
[3:38:04.400 --> 3:38:09.680]  article from right now this is breaking uh by big tech entities spreading throughout the corporate
[3:38:09.680 --> 3:38:14.880]  apparatus youtube recently removed lumars ability to make public posts on the google-owned
[3:38:14.880 --> 3:38:18.720]  video streaming device that's no surprise to us but while she is used to being jerked around by
[3:38:18.720 --> 3:38:24.720]  tech monopolies other corporations are beginning to join the trend the financial system is starting
[3:38:24.720 --> 3:38:29.920]  the blacklist lumar and other dissidents while the republican establishment lines their pockets
[3:38:29.920 --> 3:38:36.080]  and looks the other way laura lumar joins us now uh laura what is going on here now you've been
[3:38:36.080 --> 3:38:41.200]  financially blacklisted and the establishment again running away showing their weakness
[3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:46.800]  yeah we'll see thanks for having me look it's just another one of those random coincidences
[3:38:46.800 --> 3:38:51.840]  right that just happened to affect conservatives and it just happened to be the case when i was
[3:38:51.840 --> 3:38:58.640]  speaking uh in tallahassee at the florida state capital addressing a grassroots activist and
[3:38:58.640 --> 3:39:03.440]  also a bunch of florida lawmakers including governor disdantis and florida's attorney general
[3:39:03.440 --> 3:39:10.720]  ashley moody about the issue of tech censorship specifically in relation to governor disdantis
[3:39:10.720 --> 3:39:16.640]  has newly proposed tech legislation and uh you know i've been very outspoken about the tech legislation
[3:39:16.640 --> 3:39:21.840]  here in florida i think it's a good first step to create flagship legislation for other states to
[3:39:21.840 --> 3:39:26.160]  follow but it's imperfect which is why i proposed amendments and some of the amendments that i
[3:39:26.160 --> 3:39:32.800]  proposed of course were having it retroactively protect people like myself and donald trump
[3:39:32.800 --> 3:39:37.120]  uh candidates who were previously banned prior to running for office and then in the case of
[3:39:37.120 --> 3:39:42.400]  donald trump if he decides to run in 2024 but another thing that i think needs to be amendment
[3:39:42.400 --> 3:39:47.360]  amended is uh payment processors that needs to include penalties for payment processors and
[3:39:47.360 --> 3:39:53.200]  financial institutions that debank or discriminate against and ban people and in particular i mentioned
[3:39:53.200 --> 3:39:58.960]  strikes which recently banned president donald trump moments after i gave my speech the same
[3:39:58.960 --> 3:40:03.680]  exact day it's almost as if they were listening to my speech i was banned by stripes and this is
[3:40:03.680 --> 3:40:09.040]  extremely problematic okay why is it for those of you who don't know what stripe is it's a uh
[3:40:09.040 --> 3:40:14.480]  it's a dominant payment processor and it's also the payment processors that's used by a lot of
[3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:21.120]  conservative non-profits and organizations including the rnc and the gop and the nrcc and
[3:40:21.120 --> 3:40:26.640]  stripe recently banned president donald trump why does this matter well they just banned me as well
[3:40:26.640 --> 3:40:32.480]  and i want to know why is the gop using a payment processor that is banning the leader of the republican
[3:40:32.480 --> 3:40:37.760]  party i think that the republican party needs to put their foot down and say we will absolutely
[3:40:37.760 --> 3:40:42.400]  not be using payment processors or companies that are in the business of deplatforming and
[3:40:42.400 --> 3:40:47.600]  a winred is going to be using stripes well then i think the party needs to switch over to maybe
[3:40:47.600 --> 3:40:52.000]  anodot right or some of these other sites that are note that are not going to be using stripes
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:57.600]  because we can't be supporting uh processors like stripes if they're going to be discriminating
[3:40:57.600 --> 3:41:02.240]  against conservatives it's an abomination and the gop start putting their money where their mouths
[3:41:02.240 --> 3:41:06.880]  is we're talking about the same group of people that completely walked away from president donald
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:12.000]  j trump you can't tell me laura that this surprises you especially not you oh come on yeah i'm not
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:15.440]  surprised look these are the same people that threw me under the bus when i ran for congress and
[3:41:15.440 --> 3:41:20.880]  president trump's home district even though president trump endorsed me and voted for me i'm the only
[3:41:20.880 --> 3:41:24.800]  congressional candidate in the country that can say that trump not only endorsed them but also
[3:41:24.800 --> 3:41:29.840]  voted for them and you know another story just came out today um along the lines i think it's
[3:41:29.840 --> 3:41:34.800]  the same story that you read not only are they not speaking up about the financial blacklisting
[3:41:34.800 --> 3:41:39.680]  but also the telecommunication blacklisting here in palm beach county where i'm running for congress
[3:41:39.680 --> 3:41:45.200]  and where i live contrast has monopoly if you didn't know this 90 percent of the people in palm
[3:41:45.200 --> 3:41:51.200]  beach county live in homeowners or condors associations and there's a requirement a contract
[3:41:51.200 --> 3:41:55.760]  you could say with these homeowners and condo associations that says that if you live in one
[3:41:55.760 --> 3:42:01.680]  of them you have to have contrast affinity well my opponents lowest frankle radical obstructionist
[3:42:01.680 --> 3:42:07.600]  democrat is one of 32 members of congress that own stock in contrast not only did contrast donate
[3:42:07.600 --> 3:42:13.680]  to her campaign she owns stocks the president of contrast was the first person to hold a multi-million
[3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:18.960]  dollar fundraiser for joe biden and as we know donald trump has engaged in a feud with contrast
[3:42:18.960 --> 3:42:25.040]  he refers to them as concast we look at hevin mccarthy's fpc report while his top donor in 2019
[3:42:25.040 --> 3:42:30.720]  and 2020 was concast and so this is a huge problem in the gop where they're campaigning against
[3:42:30.720 --> 3:42:35.680]  cancel culture and against big tech but their fpc reports show that they're actually getting money
[3:42:35.680 --> 3:42:40.240]  from the same people who are deplatforming gop candidates and america first fire brands like
[3:42:40.240 --> 3:42:44.560]  myself yeah we're going to have to be really careful about that because this america first
[3:42:44.560 --> 3:42:48.000]  movement is really growing and they're going to see that they're going to suck on it like leeches
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:52.480]  they're going to try to attract themselves to it and attach themselves to it uh you know we have
[3:42:52.480 --> 3:42:56.720]  republicans a name only you're going to have america first in name only uh and they're fake
[3:42:56.720 --> 3:43:02.480]  they're phony and they they it's the same they would be like jerry kushner approved type candidates
[3:43:02.480 --> 3:43:07.920]  i guess is the way that i would put it well you know look you already have fake america first
[3:43:07.920 --> 3:43:11.680]  candidates that are running they're just throwing america first up on their website but they're not
[3:43:11.680 --> 3:43:19.280]  actually america first right but um but look this is this is where people need to stop donating to
[3:43:19.280 --> 3:43:24.160]  the gop they need to stop donating to the rnc and only give their money to candidates directly
[3:43:24.160 --> 3:43:29.280]  because there is no way for you to know if your money is going to your candidate of choice when
[3:43:29.280 --> 3:43:33.840]  you donate to win red or when you donate to the party and to just to give you a breakdown of the
[3:43:33.840 --> 3:43:40.640]  financials and you can see what a scam this is the nrcc which is supposed to fund congressional
[3:43:40.640 --> 3:43:46.080]  candidates and republicans running for office to take back the house they raised over 200 million
[3:43:46.080 --> 3:43:51.200]  dollars last election cycle okay the max donation that they could have given each candidate was
[3:43:51.200 --> 3:43:57.040]  five thousand dollars they had enough money to basically give each republican running
[3:43:57.040 --> 3:44:02.880]  um you know nearly half a million dollars that they really wanted to they only gave 81 candidates
[3:44:03.600 --> 3:44:08.800]  five thousand dollars if you do the math that's less than half a million dollars where the hell
[3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:14.240]  did the rest of the 199 million dollars go i would like to know i i think that there needs to be an
[3:44:14.240 --> 3:44:19.200]  audit i think there needs to be an audit and and people need to find out and they need to name names
[3:44:19.200 --> 3:44:22.720]  and these people need to be held accountable accountable because until they are this is only
[3:44:22.720 --> 3:44:27.600]  going to continue and until people are held accountable for these election frauds the same
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:32.960]  thing is going to happen and i although i know that you receive a ton of support it's going to be
[3:44:32.960 --> 3:44:36.720]  hard for you to prove that you've garnered that support if everything continues to get stolen
[3:44:36.720 --> 3:44:41.280]  away from you and then again at the ballot box uh we're running out of time but i want to touch
[3:44:41.280 --> 3:44:45.040]  on this because you originally joined me on patriotically correct over at red voice media
[3:44:45.040 --> 3:44:50.320]  discussing a jihadist attack uh and then of course it was not covered by the mainstream media you
[3:44:50.320 --> 3:44:56.800]  covered it very well uh you broke that news on on my show and then also uh we see a an immigrant
[3:44:56.800 --> 3:45:01.040]  that gunned down four innocent people well six people four of them dead two of them injured
[3:45:01.040 --> 3:45:05.440]  including a small child in orange county uh that guy is not being talked about in the mainstream
[3:45:05.440 --> 3:45:10.640]  media we know why that is and then today helicopters landing on the east front of the capital uh we've
[3:45:10.640 --> 3:45:14.880]  got reports of cops being shot there's a knife-wielding guy and why do you suppose Laura Loomer that
[3:45:14.880 --> 3:45:22.720]  this was not covered probably because it has all of the classic signs of a vehicular jihadist attack
[3:45:22.720 --> 3:45:28.640]  okay today is good friday it's Easter weekend it's also the end of Passover this is a Judeo-Christian
[3:45:28.640 --> 3:45:34.560]  country you have a car ramming uh an individual who is not white okay we have the story up at
[3:45:34.560 --> 3:45:39.520]  loomer.com he is not white i have the screenshot so they can't be screaming white supremacy white
[3:45:39.520 --> 3:45:47.280]  supremacy uh ramps his car into a barricade uh during a Judeo-Christian uh high holiday weekend
[3:45:47.280 --> 3:45:52.000]  and then takes a gun out and takes a knife out kills a police officer i mean these are the these
[3:45:52.000 --> 3:45:58.480]  are the same vehicular jihadi attack styles uh and and somatics that you see in places like
[3:45:58.480 --> 3:46:04.960]  europe or even in new york city um halloween of 2017 when you had an Islamic terrorist ram a car
[3:46:04.960 --> 3:46:08.880]  into a bike lane and then he took a knife out and took a gun out and started shouting a
[3:46:08.880 --> 3:46:12.960]  lot to walk bar and then during the press conference one of the reporters asked did he
[3:46:12.960 --> 3:46:18.800]  scream anything and the that's when they ended the press conference and so look um they they're
[3:46:18.800 --> 3:46:23.440]  already calling him a lone wolf the media is already saying that he was mentally ill because
[3:46:23.440 --> 3:46:29.920]  they can't they cannot say Islamist jihad they cannot say vehicular jihad right because that
[3:46:29.920 --> 3:46:34.720]  would be oh Islamophobia the great hoax of Islamophobia that exists in this country because
[3:46:34.720 --> 3:46:39.200]  we're not allowed to speak truth about the real terror threat in this country and it's not white
[3:46:39.200 --> 3:46:46.720]  supremacy i'll tell you that not white supremacy laura loomer you can find her at loomer 2022.com

[3:47:05.280 --> 3:47:11.200]  years as well as these mass shootings and of course if the suspect is not a white person is not a
[3:47:11.200 --> 3:47:15.920]  conservative is not a patriot is not a trump supporter you're never going to see them in
