[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Aboarded babies incinerated to eat in UK hospitals.
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.220]  Silent green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[00:16.220 --> 00:21.960]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals
[00:21.960 --> 00:22.960]  in the UK.
[00:22.960 --> 00:27.000]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[00:27.000 --> 00:32.000]  That is the secret of Silent Green.
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.000]  A powdered flesh from dead babies.
[00:35.000 --> 00:37.000]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  Because of its enormous popularity, Silent Green is in short supply.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  Remember, Tuesday is Silent Green Day.
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  The supply of Silent Green has been exhausted.
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.000]  You must evacuate the area.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  Today is Tuesday.
[00:53.000 --> 00:59.000]  The private court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group company,
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for and the flavoring.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  But we already know.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  So enjoy the flavor.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.000]  I'm for regular suicide.
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.000]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient,
[01:23.000 --> 01:31.000]  would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that credit for medical costs?
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  But that's called the death panel.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[01:35.000 --> 01:49.000]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.000]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  It will do it to its descendants.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards,
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  on the puzzlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  The scoops are on their way.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  The scoops are on their way.
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  You're going to stop them?
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.000]  Stop them!
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  This is Soylent Green.
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  Soylent Green is people!
[02:38.000 --> 02:46.000]  We're told by Vice President Joe Biden that we need to just allow any children in the world to come here
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  and that they're all our children and that we have to pay for them and let them be wards of the state
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  to be political operatives and voters to bring us into slavery to a greater degree.
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.000]  But then they do everything they can to kill babies before they're born.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  And the global is through everything they can to stop the industrialization of the third world
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  and to keep people in squalor.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  They are the last individuals to have some fake moral high ground,
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  but that's the weapon they used on the ill-informed, shabby, western population
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  who is tragically hip and tragically ignorant.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  And in most cases, aren't even conscious human beings in my view now.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  The globalists have turned them into dehumanized vessels that they wanted all along.
[03:35.000 --> 03:42.000]  They have been turned into artificially conscious biological androids, as I call them.
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, 8-8.
[03:45.000 --> 03:53.000]  It was back in 2008 on 8-8 when the Olympics kicked off that they tried to take
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  Russian-held areas of Georgia since the end of World War II and start a war.
[03:57.000 --> 03:58.000]  That failed.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  The globalists have been more successful in Ukraine.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  That does not mean, again, Russia is some paragon of goodness.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  They're now coming in with the Internet ID in Russia,
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  something the Communist Chinese have and something Obama wants.
[04:13.000 --> 04:20.000]  So there, there's our precious pootie-poot doing things like that.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  We've got a big broadcast obviously lined up for you today.
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  My cousin, Buckley Hammond, will be in studio coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  He grew up in Guatemala.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  He's a Guatemalan citizen, dual citizenship of the U.S., speaks fluent Spanish.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  He can tell you what the wondrous third world is like and what our children,
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  because there are, they don't belong to Guatemala.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  They belong to you.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  You're going to pay for them.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  And then they're also going to be wards of the state.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  Then Mark Dice is going to pop in with a bunch of new stuff he's been working on.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.000]  Media commentator.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  And then a libertarian running for office in Texas is a really smart lawyer
[04:57.000 --> 05:26.000]  who's going to be joining us as well in studio.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  This is not a low grade formula.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  within a base of DINI's water for your preparedness storage
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  or your home kitchen.
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  Purchase your bottle of infowarslife.com, silver bullet colloidal silver today
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  and find other ways to use it.
[05:50.000 --> 06:01.000]  This is Leanne McAdoo for infowarslife.com.
[06:01.000 --> 06:05.000]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, master herbologist and chief formulator
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.000]  behind the infowarslife products.
[06:07.000 --> 06:10.000]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking
[06:10.000 --> 06:11.000]  superfemale vitality?
[06:11.000 --> 06:15.000]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from super male vitality
[06:15.000 --> 06:21.000]  from emails to even excited callers on the radio.
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[06:23.000 --> 06:27.000]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body,
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000]  superfemale vitality, delivers 10 key herbs that work synergistically
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  to revitalize the unique biology of women.
[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  When he brought me home, the bottle's superfemale.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  I had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.000]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  Our relationship, all I can say is that it's a lot better now.
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  I've just started taking superfemale vitality from infowarslife.com.
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  Supplies are limited, so secure yours today at infowarslife.com,
[06:55.000 --> 07:22.000]  infowarsstore.com, or dial 1-888-253-3139.
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate,
[07:27.000 --> 07:28.000]  and many others.
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water.
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances,
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[07:46.000 --> 07:47.000]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.000]  It's good water.
[07:48.000 --> 07:49.000]  Refreshing.
[07:49.000 --> 07:50.000]  It's good.

[08:12.000 --> 08:30.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this eighth day of August.
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  2014, this is our live Friday edition.
[08:39.000 --> 08:48.000]  I will be in studio this Sunday, 4-6 p.m. Central, live from the infowars.com news center,
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  deep in the heart of Texas, coming to you from FEMA Region 6, from Austin.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  Wow, where to begin yet again?
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  Mark Dice, media commentator with a lot of Breaking Intels joining us.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  We also have other guests coming on later in the transmission as well.
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  My cousin Buckley Hammond will be in studio.
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  He was born and grew up in Guatemala.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  He has dual Guatemalan citizenship.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  And I thought you should hear from him just the stories of living in Guatemala,
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  I guess, until he was 6 or 7 years old.
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.000]  And just routinely, the market being blown up, cars being machined off the road.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  His brother kidnapped.
[09:30.000 --> 09:38.000]  This is what it's like to live in a middle class area with your own property in Guatemala.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  So we're going to hear all about that coming up.
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  And of course, Joe Biden says all children in the world are our children.
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  He means Democratic Party's children.
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  And they must be brought into the state, raised by the state, and given positions in the state.
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  They are that national security force, just as big, just as strong as our military.
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.000]  And a bunch of White House run Democratic Party websites.
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.000]  And news services came out when I talked about that a few weeks ago with our guest who was on air.
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  And said, oh, look how crazy they are claiming these kids are a political force to take over like a Hitler youth.
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  That's in the future.
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.000]  That's what major political scientists at UC Davis and others are saying.
[10:21.000 --> 10:27.000]  But more importantly, that's what the Ford Foundation said back in the 60s.
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  They were going to do with Henry Ford's money after he'd been gone a while was to break the country up and do just what's happening.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  We've been warning of it.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  So we've got all the latest news on that a clip coming up.
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  Border Patrol agent, senior agent, these people are coming here to do horrible things.
[10:43.000 --> 10:52.000]  And that integrates in with another clip mainstream media says Americans against wide open borders are anti immigration.
[10:52.000 --> 10:59.000]  Now, we just don't want to lose our citizenship and become total vassals of this new world order.
[10:59.000 --> 11:09.000]  Just like I'm against this Pacific Treaty, this Asian Pacific Treaty that's got 30 parts, only one part's been released that ends internet freedom.
[11:09.000 --> 11:19.000]  And it allows corporations that run the treaty and are setting up the new global government to merge with the EU and the North American Union to control everything.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  And the treaty is secret.
[11:21.000 --> 11:32.000]  By the way, Australians in their news at least are freaking out about this and just put a new government in and are repealing the carbon tax.
[11:32.000 --> 11:46.000]  And I'm not saying there's some paragon because they've gone deeper down the rattle in some ways than we have under globalism, but they're freaking out over their government secretly signing on to treaties that they're not allowed to see.
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.000]  I mean, that is the definition of a totalitarian system.
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  And they boil it down to, oh, you don't like children, huh?
[11:58.000 --> 12:07.000]  Here we go. There's the headline. Boom. July 17th, Australia becomes first developed nation repeal carbon tax.
[12:07.000 --> 12:22.000]  He pledged to get rid of it last year. He got elected in the landslide and the system already taps his phone and knows this, but I have it from three different high level sources that their new leader in Australia wants to restore their second amendment, their right to guns,
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  his anti-new world order, and wants prosperity for their country the old fashioned way.
[12:28.000 --> 12:46.000]  Just got chills, folks. Very exciting to have closet info warriors out there all over the place who are not going to put up with this garbage anymore, who aren't going to pay the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and the UN, their carbon tax, who want prosperity like America used to want.
[12:46.000 --> 12:55.000]  These victories get me so excited because we can turn this around. I still know we can.
[12:55.000 --> 13:08.000]  Yes, the West is corrupt. Yes, the world is declining. Yes, there's a lot of problems, but we've got to try to fix things because it's too serious if we let the full collapse happen.
[13:08.000 --> 13:26.000]  It's too horrible. And we've got to struggle even in the collapse so that people know we struggled and we tried to fix things so we build systems at a micro level that can be duplicated to try to restore civilization, restore honor, and an age of chivalry to go to the stars.
[13:26.000 --> 13:38.000]  And to let our children and grandchildren enjoy the true fruits of technology, the life extension, and to allow all this high tech to develop true transparency and culture.
[13:38.000 --> 13:48.000]  And it could be a new golden age, ladies and gentlemen, instead of the globalist new age, dark age counterfeit system of total enslavement.
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  See, the new world order always has counterfeits within counterfeits, and I'm going to get to all the huge news.
[13:54.000 --> 14:02.000]  The Illuminati founded in the 1770s was set up long before 1776.
[14:02.000 --> 14:09.000]  In Germany and France, on record, is a real organization, real society.
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  And it has vestigial organizations today that I'm going to break down here in a moment.
[14:14.000 --> 14:30.000]  But they went out and, of course, a letter carrier got struck with lightning with high level, decompartmentalized command level orders from Adam Weishaupt for Illuminati leaders in Germany and France, only about 14 of them.
[14:30.000 --> 14:42.000]  To pose as freedom lovers, to pose as people that wanted to bring in a system of renaissance, to pose as folks that wanted to overthrow the corrupt monarchies.
[14:42.000 --> 14:56.000]  When in truth, all Adam Weishaupt and others wanted was to overthrow the existing order to bring in their order of 1984 literal total oppression, trampled and being trampled upon.
[14:56.000 --> 15:05.000]  So you go to the technicals, those of us that really want liberty and freedom, you could call the Illuminati.
[15:05.000 --> 15:14.000]  Because we're the type of people who just want freedom and family rights and the right to self-defense and individualism.
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.000]  Well, the globalists came in, the proto-globalists, the Jacobins of 250 years ago.
[15:20.000 --> 15:27.000]  They saw a renaissance leading to revolution all over the world to bring in a new expanded renaissance.
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  So they simply tried to hijack the revolutionary fervor that was already there.
[15:32.000 --> 15:43.000]  Where have you seen that before? Real beef with Russia in Ukraine? Globalists hijack that, bringing a George Soros EU takeover system.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  To replace one tyranny with one even far worse.
[15:46.000 --> 15:54.000]  A lot of Arabs want freedom across the Middle East. They're tired of being oppressed, they're tired of whatever different issues they're dealing with.
[15:54.000 --> 16:02.000]  Come in with Google and Facebook and Twitter, game the revolution, put Al Qaeda light and IS and Muslim Brotherhood in control,
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.000]  to bring down all the existing systems that had stability and freedom compared to what they now have.
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.000]  And brand it as freedom.
[16:11.000 --> 16:16.000]  So that's why I've said before and people have taken out a context as they do, I don't care, I expect liars to do that.
[16:16.000 --> 16:23.000]  Fine, people will then see that, come here and find the truth.
[16:23.000 --> 16:28.000]  That you could say that, yes, George Washington was in the Illuminati.
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  You could say I'm in the Illuminati, but I don't go to any secret meetings.
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  I'm not a part of any secret organization.
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  But I believe in human illumination.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  I believe in light.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  I believe in freedom.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  I believe in justice.
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  I believe in transparency.
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.000]  I believe in the right of free association.
[16:53.000 --> 17:01.000]  And George Washington and many got sucked into the Illuminati on record for a few years.
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  But then they turned against it.
[17:03.000 --> 17:11.000]  And George Washington turned against the French Illuminist and wrote scores of letters that are public that you can read at the Library of Congress.
[17:11.000 --> 17:17.000]  Just type in George Washington's letters, the Illuminati, click Google images, and you'll see hundreds of copies.
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.000]  You can follow the links to the Library of Congress.
[17:22.000 --> 17:31.000]  I've actually gone to the Library of Congress and been allowed in because they have them on display in his papers and was allowed to even look at them six years ago.
[17:31.000 --> 17:46.000]  I have looked through the glass at his letters, saying how evil the Illuminati is, how they hijack Liberty movements, how they're there to really bring in a tyranny to overthrow one tyranny to replace it with one far worse.
[17:46.000 --> 17:53.000]  So again, the reason I bring that up is they're masters of infiltrating.
[17:53.000 --> 18:00.000]  They're masters of hijacking things.
[18:00.000 --> 18:11.000]  But in the end, they don't deliver like Obama claiming all this change or Bush claiming he wouldn't be involved in foreign entanglements and wanted to cut the government or Bill Clinton.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  They all work for the same combine.
[18:13.000 --> 18:20.000]  The headlines CNN poll trust in government at all time low.
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.000]  Remember info wars dot com last week.
[18:23.000 --> 18:28.000]  Linking the foreign news and foreign documents.
[18:28.000 --> 18:38.000]  Showing that the Ebola outbreak was already a pandemic, and then it was being covered up and then drudge report dot com link to our story.
[18:38.000 --> 18:51.000]  And then it was forced to be picked up and now the head of Good Samaritan was on C-SPAN criticizing drudge saying yes it's true it's a pandemic but drudge shouldn't be telling people about it.
[18:51.000 --> 18:57.000]  Yeah, let's not tell people so they could get prepared in case something happens.
[18:57.000 --> 19:01.000]  Let's keep people in the dark, you see.
[19:01.000 --> 19:14.000]  That's what the Illuminati does. The bad Illuminati, the real Illuminati is they say they're trying to protect you by keeping you in the dark.
[19:14.000 --> 19:24.000]  And now they've got people testifying in Congress that drudge report dot com linked to info wars dot com.
[19:24.000 --> 19:32.000]  And other articles some of them mainstream proving there was a cover up and then they admit yes there was a cover up.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  But we're bad for telling the truth.
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.000]  Meanwhile the UN has now come out and said Ebola is an international health emergency World Health Organization.
[19:40.000 --> 19:45.000]  So sorry we told you about it a week and three days before it was mainstream.
[19:45.000 --> 19:46.000]  I apologize.
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.000]  And you know sorry about everything else too.
[19:49.000 --> 19:58.000]  We've got a drudge link to our article in our video that we first found and made go viral of the cop saying I don't have to follow the Constitution because Obama doesn't.
[19:58.000 --> 20:01.000]  That's now on CNN Fox News you name it and the cop has resigned.
[20:01.000 --> 20:06.000]  Summer is here and nothing looks better than tanned skin and white teeth.

[21:00.000 --> 21:07.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[21:07.000 --> 21:15.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[21:20.000 --> 21:23.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[21:27.000 --> 21:32.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[21:32.000 --> 21:42.000]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[21:42.000 --> 21:47.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[21:47.000 --> 21:53.000]  The new InfoWarsLive Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  One of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[22:07.000 --> 22:08.000]  I get it.
[22:08.000 --> 22:17.000]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social security would be there for you.
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  That's not what's happening.
[22:19.000 --> 22:27.000]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[22:34.000 --> 22:40.000]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[22:44.000 --> 22:45.000]  You should too.
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.000]  Find out what they know.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well.

[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  800-686-2237.
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  That's 800-686-2237.

[23:33.000 --> 23:38.000]  The package includes three books and seven DVD programs which cover biblical miracles and prophecy.
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.000]  The Shroud of Turn, the Third Secret of Fatima, what really happened to the Catholic Church and more.
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  Call 800-513-0029.
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  That's 800-513-0029.
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  Or go to VaticanCatholic.com.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  That's VaticanCatholic.com.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  800-513-0029.
[23:56.000 --> 24:25.000]  VaticanCatholic.com.
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.000]  And again, I'm not saying Ebola's going to come kill us here or even going to break out here.
[24:31.000 --> 24:41.000]  All I know is that they've never brought it in someone who's a vector who has contaminated and can spread it to the United States, to Spain, to Germany.
[24:41.000 --> 24:50.000]  And there's a lot of weird PSYOP stuff going on in some big genetic engineering companies we're looking at with these vaccines and treatments.
[24:50.000 --> 25:03.000]  That this may be the primer for a contrived outbreak or something down the road to try to make literally hundreds of billions of dollars off of an Ebola vaccine that they can then piggyback something else into.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  And the reason we say that, they've done this before.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  They've been caught adding stuff to vaccines.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  They've been caught releasing things before.
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  I mean, it's been declassified. Everybody knows about that.
[25:14.000 --> 25:32.000]  The H1N1 was a viral simulant for a genetically engineered dialed down virus to simulate flu spread the year before they officially released it and called it a pandemic when it wasn't a pandemic.
[25:32.000 --> 25:40.000]  Then they rolled out the vaccine that had incredible health problems and lowered immune systems according to the Canadian government.
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  Then I had Wolfgang, I think it was Wudar gone. I'm going from memory.
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.000]  The head of the EU Commission checked that for me because there's two different Wolfgangs.
[25:49.000 --> 25:58.000]  I mean, I conflated one of them to say that it was genetically engineered and that they'd looked at it and that it was all a big staged event.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  Well, here's this headline.
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  Samaritan's Perth chief admitt Ebola out of control.
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.000]  In a close quote, slams Drudge for reporting it.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  I look at the Drudge report.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  It can drive a lot of panic.
[26:18.000 --> 26:27.000]  So we have Geraldo Rivera and we have congressional testimony bashing the Drudge report.
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  And again, why do I defend the Drudge report so much?
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.000]  It's not just that Matt Drudge is a trailblazer and links to our news stories that keep being proven to be accurate.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  And he believed in us and did the research and knows we're at least trying to get it right.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  We make mistakes sometimes.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  So we're in the same boat in many respects and we're libertarian paleoconservatives.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  I think it's fair to say.
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  Constitutionalist.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  But we're in the same boat.
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  If they can take down Drudge, you got the Pentagon talking about them.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  You got them. White House doing it, they can take everybody down.
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  And it just shows how the elite aren't all powerful.
[27:02.000 --> 27:10.000]  That Drudge was linking to German newspapers, French newspapers, infowars.com.
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  Analyst experts coming out and saying they're covering up the Ebola.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  It was credible what we were saying.
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.000]  It's been confirmed today by the World Health Organization that yes, it's a pandemic.
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  Yes, it's a crisis.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  Yes, it's worse than we thought.
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  Well, it's come out, they were covering it up.
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  We were right.
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  These articles ran last week, early last week, middle of last week, through the weekend.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  Geraldo Rivera freaked out.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  A bunch of people freaked out.
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  But we're just reporting the truth.
[27:42.000 --> 27:45.000]  And now they admit we're correct, but Drudge is bad.
[27:45.000 --> 27:51.000]  And again, Drudge is now the figurehead of independent non-state-run media.
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  You've got to pick one figurehead worldwide, like Ron Paul's the figurehead of libertarianism.
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  Matt Drudge is the figurehead, but also there's a real person behind it.
[28:00.000 --> 28:08.000]  But still the symbol, the flag of internet freedom, libertarian type ideas.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  So they're all hating him.
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  We have to recognize that because we have power, because we're effective.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  I want you to know the good news.
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  The government has the lowest approval rating ever. I'm going to cover that after the break.
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  Let's go to this Good Samaritan clip.
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  Again, I will say that Ebola is out of control in West Africa.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  And we are starting to see panic now around the world.
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.000]  People want to know.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  I don't know about you folks.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  I look at the Drudge report.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  You can drive a lot of panic.
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  And you know, there's a guy in New York, there's a woman in England.
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  There's six people had been tested in the United States.
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.000]  There are reports that there are 340 Peace Corps workers coming back.
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.000]  I greatly appreciate the help of the CDC.
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  They have, in fact, Dr. Frieden and I personally have spoken.
[28:55.000 --> 29:02.000]  And they have, in fact, help articulate their procedures and protocols for Americans returning into this country.
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.000]  And we are grateful for that.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  While our live beer.
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  You know, I don't think he's even so much bashing Drudge as the media spun it that way.
[29:11.000 --> 29:14.000]  But the issue is drive a lot of panic.
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  And then they go on to admit, but it is spreading.
[29:17.000 --> 29:18.000]  It is getting worse.
[29:18.000 --> 29:23.000]  Ebola, an international health emergency, World Health Organization, are they driving panic?
[29:23.000 --> 29:30.000]  The UN Health Agency is calling for global response to the West Africa epidemic to stop and reverse the spread of the disease.
[29:30.000 --> 29:37.000]  What they really don't like is that infowars.com, DrudgeReport.com and others know what's going on.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  We break the stuff first.
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  And then it doesn't allow them to control the narrative.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  That's what they're really upset about.
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  Not that we're causing panic.
[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  We're trying to cause a response to stop the crisis getting worse.
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  We're on the march.
[29:51.000 --> 29:52.000]  We want stability.
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  We want a future.
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.000]  Alex Jones.
[29:55.000 --> 29:56.000]  We want our freedom back.
[29:56.000 --> 29:57.000]  We want our freedom back.
[29:57.000 --> 29:59.000]  We don't like Big Brother.
[30:01.000 --> 30:08.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxified.
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.000]  People know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[30:12.000 --> 30:17.000]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[30:17.000 --> 30:20.000]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[30:25.000 --> 30:33.000]  Then about a year ago he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[30:33.000 --> 30:38.000]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[30:42.000 --> 30:51.000]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[30:51.000 --> 30:55.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.

[31:01.000 --> 31:03.000]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[31:03.000 --> 31:11.000]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals
[31:11.000 --> 31:19.000]  sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[31:19.000 --> 31:23.000]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say that was good stuff.
[31:23.000 --> 31:34.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[31:34.000 --> 31:40.000]  Super male vitality by infowarslife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[33:21.000 --> 33:50.000]  We're here live. I'm your host Alex Jones, my cousin Buckley Hammond, who grew up the first five, six, seven years.
[33:50.000 --> 33:57.000]  I don't know if his life in Guatemala is just going to give you a little perspective of what it was like then.
[33:57.000 --> 34:04.000]  Now it's rated even worse. And that's where the majority of this new wave of 17% of them are children.
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.000]  But if it's a 50 year old serial killer, you're not allowed to stop them.
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  Even if they've been deported six times, you got to let them come back and murder a Border Patrol agent and his father,
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.000]  who are fishing right in front of their mother just to take their wallet.
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  That's the funny thing. These folks come out of Mexico and Latin America.
[34:23.000 --> 34:28.000]  They mainly prey on other Hispanics. But if you don't want Hispanic Americans being murdered in mass,
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  or being fed on by drug gangs, you're racist.
[34:31.000 --> 34:37.000]  So we're going to talk to Buckley Hammond, my cousin who helped start Infowars, 19 years ago,
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.000]  who now has come back to the team last year. He's here with us. That's coming up in a few minutes.
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.000]  But here's the headline. Border Patrol Agent. These people are coming here to do horrible things.
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.000]  Here's the clubs.
[34:48.000 --> 34:56.000]  So if we can't go out and do our job, and we're going to practice this policy of catch and release where Border Patrol catch people,
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.000]  these are not people that are just coming here to work as the so-called line is fed to us.
[35:02.000 --> 35:10.000]  These people are coming here to do horrible things. And I think the murder of Agent Vega shows what these people are capable of.
[35:10.000 --> 35:18.000]  And so we have this situation where we catch them, and then when they're turned over to ICE, they are being ordered to be released.
[35:18.000 --> 35:28.000]  And how is that an effective border strategy? And how any politician, the president included, can justify that is beyond me.
[35:28.000 --> 35:34.000]  And again, our clip system has been jittering a bit lately. We're going to get to the bottom of that.
[35:34.000 --> 35:41.000]  We're not editing these clips. They're just jumping around. But you got the basics of what he was saying there.
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.000]  You know, it's not our in-house video produced clips and news that are jittering.
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  I think it's the way we're downloading them. I think you're going to find the issue there.
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.000]  Continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, theMFallWars.com news.
[35:54.000 --> 36:01.000]  Mainstream media, though, is saying Americans against wide open borders are anti-immigration.
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  But no other civilized country has opened its borders as widely as America has.
[36:05.000 --> 36:16.000]  Kit Daniels breaks it down. What KVEOTV is reporting that anyone, including ranchers that are being robbed on a weekly basis,
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.000]  who doesn't want to have open borders, is basically a racist.
[36:22.000 --> 36:31.000]  So this is the mindlessness of it. And then you've got the dumbed-down propaganda of people like the vice president a few days ago saying,
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  these are all our children.
[36:35.000 --> 36:43.000]  Meanwhile, they made a deal a year ago in Guatemala to bring these people in and to allow Guatemala to allow people from Central and South America to come through.
[36:43.000 --> 36:54.000]  And Mexico has a deal now on record, an international racketeering, smuggling, drug-travelling, money laundering deal with the Obama administration
[36:54.000 --> 37:05.000]  to let their people through and turn the Border Patrol into a conveyor belt to deliver the illegals and to bust them anywhere they want to go in the country.
[37:05.000 --> 37:15.000]  17% is the latest numbers in the new Border Patrol report that leaked last week, pointing out that thousands are from Ebola-stricken countries.
[37:15.000 --> 37:20.000]  Thousands more from Al-Qaeda and IS-linked countries.
[37:20.000 --> 37:26.000]  And again, I'm not wringing my hands in fear of the Ebola. It just shows the recklessness.
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  I'm not wringing my hands in fear of the Al-Qaeda people, even if they were to blow up a bunch of stuff.
[37:30.000 --> 37:38.000]  Okay, it kills a few thousand people. I'm sad that happens. Statistically, cars, cancer, heart attacks, electrocution, drowning.
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  It's all much more dangerous. It's like I'm not scared of great white sharks.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  It's a terrible way to get killed, but I mean, five people a year on average get killed by it.
[37:46.000 --> 37:54.000]  The point is, it shows the whole war on terror is a facade and an excuse to bring in a police state that takes all of our rights.
[37:54.000 --> 38:01.000]  So let's go to that clip because I mentioned Biden again yesterday saying this and saw a comment on YouTube saying I was a liar.
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  He hadn't said this, so here's the clip.
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.000]  These are not somebody else's kids. These are our kids.
[38:09.000 --> 38:17.000]  These are the children that lift the national ambitions of each of these countries aloft.
[38:17.000 --> 38:30.000]  And it's a tragedy for the countries who are losing them and for us not being able to solve every one of their problems.
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  Oh, you can't abort all of them.
[38:34.000 --> 38:45.000]  And now all the conservatives and Christians and Christian conservative libertarians and constitutionalists that are against aborting nine month old babies
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  that could just be delivered and instantly adopted up.
[38:49.000 --> 38:55.000]  And the mother could be paid 50 to $200,000 by the adoption agency for the healthy baby.
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  Blonde-haired blue-eyed babies, 400 grand.
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  Black-haired green-eyed babies, 500, 600 grand.
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  Hispanic babies, 150 grand.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  Black babies, 50 grand.
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.000]  I'm sad that's just the market. I think all the babies are worth the same.
[39:11.000 --> 39:17.000]  It's come out the CPS has quotas on kids that the adoption agencies want and they end up getting money for it.
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.000]  It's a huge criminal racket. Most of the CPS are actually private guilds and groups.
[39:22.000 --> 39:29.000]  There are some people that work in the foster system and aren't even bad, but at the top, it's big spiders running the operation.
[39:29.000 --> 39:35.000]  And no one's going to cry out for those kids or the kids having radiation tested on them or pesticides tested on them.
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.000]  They even comes out in New York Daily News. Nobody gets in trouble killing little black kids with pesticides.
[39:40.000 --> 39:49.000]  No one tells the women that if they call the phone number on those billboards that Catholic charities and others put up that say, you know,
[39:49.000 --> 39:59.000]  pregnant scared that you'll end up getting everything paid for to have your baby and money at the end of it.
[39:59.000 --> 40:07.000]  You just go in, you get an abortion that doubles your chances of different types of uterine cancer, all sorts of other issues.
[40:07.000 --> 40:15.000]  No one tells you that. And oh, it's because Joe Biden loves the children.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  Don't we have a video of the birth of Joe Biden? Can you guys cue that up?
[40:20.000 --> 40:26.000]  John Bown knows where it's at. It's the birth of Obama, I think, caught on tape is the name of it.
[40:26.000 --> 40:32.000]  And it's satire, but we cue that up. We can play it.
[40:32.000 --> 40:41.000]  The point is they could care less about these kids and they have no moral high ground when plus 17% of the illegals pouring in are the kids.
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  We're going to talk about what the borders like here in a moment with Buckley Hammond.
[40:44.000 --> 40:52.000]  First off, you've already started to hear rave reviews about DNA force. We won't get more of it for 10 weeks.
[40:52.000 --> 41:09.000]  We're going as fast as we can. This is our proprietary blend of the true, organic, made America, not synthetic, patented, known things like PPQ and CoQ10 and a bunch of other stuff where one ingredient in the bottle costs us 40 bucks.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  That's why it's $130.
[41:11.000 --> 41:22.000]  For me, it was the Narnie that is good, high powered, neutral medical type stuff is $600 to $1,000. So that gives you an idea of why it's sold out in one day.
[41:22.000 --> 41:30.000]  We're going to get a lot more of it next time if we're able to. We're working on that right now because this stuff is basically pharmaceutical grade.
[41:30.000 --> 41:39.000]  That's what they call it, nutraceutical. I've been on it a few months, incredible response. Other people in the office are on it, they're coming going, man, that stuff's even more amazing.
[41:39.000 --> 41:47.000]  We don't have it. We don't have this little gym either yet for a few months because we're busy getting the patent pending and trademarking it and stuff.
[41:47.000 --> 41:57.000]  But this is something entirely new that no one else has that I've been taking. And people said my eyes look clearer, unanimous because I'd lead a very stressful life.
[41:57.000 --> 42:16.000]  Sorry, both these things are unavailable at m4slife.com. But what is available is survival shield, super nascent iodine, the only source sold anywhere from deep beneath the earth between 7 and 12,000 feet, pure purple crystals that are then aerosolized.
[42:16.000 --> 42:29.000]  I forget the term of it when you take a solid and turn it into a gas like this where it actually, it's an interesting term. My dad was talking about this morning and we have video of it on a hot plate there of your TV viewer.
[42:29.000 --> 42:40.000]  The crystals that we have been with the proprietary system mixed into the organic palm oil and they just take the gas and mix it into the organic palm oil.
[42:40.000 --> 42:50.000]  And it is just unbelievable what it does in the body, just going through the body detoxifying, grabbing onto the bad halogens like fluoride and bromine and bromide.
[42:50.000 --> 43:03.000]  It's simply incredible. And we have X2 for $29.95. Leading competitors are double the price, half the strength. That was with the old iodine survival shield that I think is better for kids.
[43:03.000 --> 43:16.000]  Consulting physicians is not as strong. This stuff is just, there's nothing like it. X2. And it helps fund infowars and our operation.
[43:16.000 --> 43:24.000]  And I take it morning, noon and night. Now, I did go through the detoxing the first two, three weeks when I took it, I was warned about that.
[43:24.000 --> 43:35.000]  But then after that, it's just like clarity. It's amazing. Absolutely amazing. From my perspective, what I had happened with myself, friends and family, you've heard the reviews.
[43:35.000 --> 43:47.000]  Bottom line, tri-X2, tri-survival shield, tri-fluoride shield, tri-lung cleanse with all the key essential oils concentrated, organic, three shots in the mouth.
[43:47.000 --> 43:55.000]  Then you inhale just a little bit in the lungs. Amazing what it does when I have a sore throat or my larynx is worn out. We still have some of that.
[43:55.000 --> 44:05.000]  The colloidal silver-silver bullet is almost sold out. It'll probably be a month until we get more of it in. Proprietary, powerful, nano-silver, $19.95.
[44:05.000 --> 44:17.000]  It's just relabeled from one of the biggest high quality manufacturers out there in a large food company. Organic food operation sells the same thing for $29.95.
[44:17.000 --> 44:27.000]  Just to give you an example of what we do. The highest quality slash the prices. Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[44:27.000 --> 44:35.000]  And guys, I don't have much water left in here. Do me a favor. Give me some water so I can... Oh, my cousin's got over. He's got some water here so I can mix this up. Thank you, bro.
[44:35.000 --> 44:49.000]  And I'm going to take my noontime dose. Ah, delicious. Infowarslife.com. Take the challenge 888-253-3139.
[44:49.000 --> 45:03.000]  Now, my cousin grew up in Guatemala. I'll have him tell you the story and just hit some of the high points or low points. Beautiful country.
[45:03.000 --> 45:14.000]  He got to see volcanoes erupting. Interesting people. Just south of Mexico. Used to be part of Mexico, but Santa Ana made them mad so they broke away like Texas did.
[45:14.000 --> 45:24.000]  He was such a thug, increasing taxes, trying to take their guns. He grew up there because my aunt and uncle were down there working on...
[45:24.000 --> 45:30.000]  I guess they bought property and had a coffee plantation. But the issue was a lot of his Vietnam buddies were moving down there, so he moved down there.
[45:30.000 --> 45:39.000]  And he can tell you the rest of the story of what Guatemala's like. And by the way, he was there in the 70s and early 80s when it was bad.
[45:39.000 --> 45:47.000]  It is now, by every metric, much worse, an absolute hellhole. Beautiful place, but a green hell.
[45:47.000 --> 45:54.000]  And Buckley Hammond, one of the original Infowars, now back on the team after a decade in Chicago, up there working for big TV.
[45:54.000 --> 46:05.000]  Buckley, tell folks, even once you're going to break down, I know some of the stories, your brother kidnapped all of it, go through those stories for people so they understand what's coming up here.
[46:05.000 --> 46:11.000]  And that Joe Biden says there are children. It's our responsibility. Can't take care of your kids. You're going bankrupt.
[46:11.000 --> 46:19.000]  Have trouble getting off work to pick your kids up at school. Doesn't matter. These are your kids. The whole world's your responsibility or you're racist.
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  So, Buckley Hammond.
[46:21.000 --> 46:26.000]  Exactly. First of all, let me just say that the whole magnitude of this experience isn't lost on me.
[46:26.000 --> 46:39.000]  I'm really, really happy to be here talking to you and talking to your more than 3 million daily listeners that, to me, represent the core of a new renaissance of a new field of thought in the world that we're spreading liberty.
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  And I'm really excited to be here. So let me just get that out of the way.
[46:42.000 --> 46:48.000]  Regarding Guatemala, you know, it's a really long and interesting subject.
[46:48.000 --> 46:59.000]  And you could pour over books and read Wikipedia articles and et cetera about it all day long. And it's just been a century of conflict down there.
[46:59.000 --> 47:07.000]  And when you're talking about the violence that is occurring down there now, unfortunately, that's not a new phenomenon.
[47:07.000 --> 47:17.000]  And there's a duality to this that I think is really important to understand is that, yes, it has always been very violent down there, but the nature of the violence has changed.
[47:17.000 --> 47:24.000]  If you go all the way back into the history of Guatemala, obviously it was colonized by the Spaniards and the Spaniards were there for a long time.
[47:24.000 --> 47:30.000]  They brought a lot of really positive, interesting things to the culture. Their architecture is still there and it's really gorgeous and beautiful.
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.000]  But, you know, they did, all the Indians were basically their indentured servants.
[47:35.000 --> 47:41.000]  And you had everything that is, you know, endemic to most of the colonial experiences around the world.
[47:41.000 --> 47:50.000]  And in the 1950s, and this is a story that every conspiracy theorist should know because it's not a theory. It's an actual fact.
[47:50.000 --> 47:51.000]  C.I.Coon.
[47:51.000 --> 47:58.000]  Exactly. In the 1950s, United Fruit, with the help of the CIA, deposed a president named Jacobo Arbenz.
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  And they basically just went in there just exactly like the globalists are doing now.
[48:02.000 --> 48:08.000]  But it was a lot more brazen because they just came in with their guns and they just took control of the whole situation.
[48:08.000 --> 48:17.000]  So that people like Bob Dole of, you know, Chiquita Banana, which is now, which was United Fruit, could get their way.
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.000]  You know, they just marched in there with guns and just made whatever they needed to happen happen.
[48:21.000 --> 48:33.000]  And so I would highly suggest that people go and read about that because that's a really, really interesting and really just open naked view into the nascent globalists' sort of power structure.
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  And it's easy to say, oh, that's terrible. People let them do it. Now they're doing it to us.
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  Absolutely. They're turning it around.
[48:39.000 --> 48:51.000]  And then, you know, the sad thing is that after that happened, in the 1950s, and then from 1960s, there has been a civil war in Guatemala from the 1960s all the way through to 1996.
[48:51.000 --> 48:58.000]  Now that is 36 years, 36 years that the country has been wracked, you know, with a violent, violent civil war.
[48:58.000 --> 49:17.000]  And the majority of that is basically just this revolving door of people in power and leftist and socialist and actually communist like Russian supported insurgents, you know, that were attacking a government that was backed by the CIA in the United States.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  And it just went back and forth and back and forth.
[49:19.000 --> 49:25.000]  So the country is just riddled with, you know, bloodletting that's been going on for generations.
[49:25.000 --> 49:35.000]  Now what is significant about that is the fact that now, you know, now the civil war is supposedly over, right?
[49:35.000 --> 49:42.000]  But what has happened is you've had generations and generations of people who have known nothing but violence and have been wracked back and forth by violence.
[49:42.000 --> 49:52.000]  And basically all the power structures of the day are like the police and any sort of way to keep civil calm has been almost completely deconstructed.
[49:52.000 --> 50:08.000]  So at this stage right now, Guatemala is instead of having two forces that are sort of fighting each other, it's become an absolute cesspool of horrific, absolute horrific violence against, you know, the people themselves.
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  It's anarchy. What all these anarchists want is Guatemala.
[50:12.000 --> 50:18.000]  This is what government devolves into an absolute nightmare instead of a very small constitutional government.
[50:18.000 --> 50:26.000]  Exactly. And there's an article that I read a long time ago and I went back and I looked it up again and it was just very startling and very visceral.
[50:26.000 --> 50:32.000]  And it really, it really sort of details the horror that these people live through on a daily basis.
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.000]  And it was in the New Republic and it's called the most dangerous job in the world.
[50:36.000 --> 50:46.000]  And basically it's a story about how 900 Guatemalan bus drivers were killed by thugs and gangsters and murderers over the course of a year.
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  And I would highly suggest people go and read that. I think it's 900.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  And again, that's what's coming here because it's not just Guatemala.
[50:52.000 --> 51:01.000]  All of Central and South America is descending into road warrior frothing insanity and our government is saying, come on, come up here.

[53:00.000 --> 53:05.000]  It seems that everywhere you turn to these days, people are talking about the health benefits of silver.
[53:05.000 --> 53:14.000]  But don't be fooled into believing all silver is the same. Only one silver solution has been clinically shown to be hundreds of times stronger than colloidal or ionic silver.
[53:14.000 --> 53:21.000]  That's supernatural silver. It can be used internally as a powerful immune system enhancer to fight off bacteria and viruses.

[54:26.000 --> 54:35.000]  You can say, oh, it's for children all day. Bull. Buckley, get back into the 900 bus drivers killed in one year to the point of buses just stop moving.
[54:35.000 --> 54:43.000]  This is the insanity of an unstable country where people only know how to rob and steal when the country goes completely bad.
[54:43.000 --> 54:53.000]  And now the crime rate is exploding across the Southwest as the crime wave out of Central and South America conduits up through Mexico in a deliberate plan.
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.000]  Buckley, break down the stories.
[54:54.000 --> 55:02.000]  Well, you're right. You know, when, when violence gets to that level, it just creates a, it's like your body like locking down in toxic shock.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  You know, it just, nothing can work.
[55:04.000 --> 55:13.000]  How can bus drivers and people who drive trucks with products in the back and make it from point A to point B, you know, without, without being robbed at gunpoint.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  And so it's a really, really vicious circumstance.
[55:16.000 --> 55:22.000]  And one of the things that I'd like to do is just sort of relate a couple of stories that happened to me personally when I was growing up in Guatemala.
[55:22.000 --> 55:30.000]  I was born in 1974 in Guatemala City in the Aurora hospital down there.
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  I lived there for, tell us about 11 years old.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  We came back in 1986.
[55:36.000 --> 55:42.000]  And the first story that I'm going to tell is about some friends of my parents.
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.000]  And this was before I was even a one year old.
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.000]  It was the woman's name was Elsa Schuman and the little boy.
[55:48.000 --> 55:53.000]  His name was Jonas and he was my friend, you know, I like little, little pre toddler babies will be clear.
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.000]  Your dad was down there as a missionary and ran a Christian school too.
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  Exactly.
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  And so one day they went downtown.
[56:00.000 --> 56:07.000]  The wife and the young, young boy went downtown to go to the market and a bomb was a bomb exploded nearby them.
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  And they were, they were both severely injured.
[56:10.000 --> 56:18.000]  The little boy Jonas died and the mother gave my mom a teddy bear that I have kept with me my whole life.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  It's been in my bed for my whole life.
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  And that's to be a sort of reminder of where I came from.
[56:23.000 --> 56:34.000]  And it's a, it's a, it's a really stark reminder that, you know, children and everybody else is, is a danger in as collateral collateral damage in this war.
[56:34.000 --> 56:35.000]  You know,
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  Was that a loving communist bomb that killed him?
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  Absolutely.
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  It was a loving communist bomb.
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  So another story was that my mom and I were downtown at one point going to the market.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  It was the bank.
[56:46.000 --> 56:52.000]  If I remember correctly, we were in the bank and a bomb blew up a car bomb blew up outside the, you know, all the plaster was coming off.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  The walls, et cetera.
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.000]  I remember that very clearly.
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.000]  So I very nearly was in one of those circumstances too.
[56:58.000 --> 57:07.000]  Another story that I have is that we used to drive together all together on a, on a, in a sort of armored car to go to school.
[57:07.000 --> 57:18.000]  And one time we were coming off of an exit on a, on a highway, much like a circular, you know, like a, like when you come off the exit and you have to turn around a circular way to go down.
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  And there was a big shootout in front of us. It was an assassination.
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  A bunch of people just shot the car in front of us.
[57:25.000 --> 57:28.000]  And our driver drove off the road, went off-roading and drove off.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  And we just saw the aftermath of that.
[57:30.000 --> 57:38.000]  And I remember my mom reminded me this, today, this morning that when we were driving around, she used to play a game where she would say duck.
[57:38.000 --> 57:47.000]  And we would all have to duck, you know, and it was really just preparing us for the next time that there was, you know, a fuselade of bullets and guns.
[57:47.000 --> 57:50.000]  And of course, guns were banned there, but it was a total hellhole.
[57:50.000 --> 57:51.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  Just like Mexico.
[57:53.000 --> 58:01.000]  And once a civil war, a mafia war breaks out, once we accept a gangster culture, you don't hardly ever come back.
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  You cannot Christians all day in America.
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.000]  It hadn't been perfect, but we've been a lot more stable than other nations.
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  That's what made the wealth.
[58:09.000 --> 58:15.000]  And now we're converting to a gangster culture and our government wants it to happen.
[58:15.000 --> 58:18.000]  There are more of these stories when we come back Buckley Hammond in the next hour.
[58:18.000 --> 58:24.000]  But first off, in the 30 seconds we've got left, why do you think the system wants to do this here?
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.000]  Well, I think they want to implode it from the inside.
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  I mean, it's like injecting a cancer.
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.000]  It's like putting polonium inside of somebody's body, you know?
[58:32.000 --> 58:39.000]  If you take people that have lived in that circumstance and you put them inside of a normal society, we're soft.
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  See, I want to hear about this when we come back.
[58:41.000 --> 58:42.000]  That's powerful.
[58:42.000 --> 58:43.000]  Thank you for listening.
[58:43.000 --> 58:47.000]  This is racist when he was in the bombs and the baby died.
[58:47.000 --> 59:16.000]  And he doesn't love it. He should want to.
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[59:22.000 --> 59:27.000]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years.
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.000]  And I'm still fighting.
[59:28.000 --> 59:31.000]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  The Info War is worldwide.
[59:33.000 --> 59:37.000]  Tell your friends about Info Wars and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.
[59:37.000 --> 59:41.000]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact.
[59:41.000 --> 59:48.000]  Step up and take your friends and family to infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv and planetinfowars.com.
[59:48.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  The truth will set them free.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  Guys, when we come back in the next segment, I'm going to finish up with Buckley.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  And then we're going to get into what I haven't covered yet in detail.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  Hundreds reported killed after U.S. bombs, IS, IS position in Iraq.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  They were poised to take the air bull in the autonomous region of Kurdistan.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  I'm going to explain what's really going on here.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  Guys, print me the airlift of EVIL, MSNBC, BBC articles from 2001.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  I want to just show people that there.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  This is totally staged, totally fake.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  We're going to break that down.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  Buckley, continuing, and you're going to tell some more of the stories in the next segment.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  And then finish up with your big picture.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  You want to get into the whole refugee situation and decipher that.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  But some of the other stories of what you saw in Guatemala.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  Well, you know, there was beyond what I experienced personally,
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  and I can only tell those stories from my perspective.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  I know that there was a lot of fear in Guatemala regarding recriminations
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  and different people who would attack other people.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  And then just straight up.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  People would tattle, though, to send the government at you, those stories.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  Absolutely.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  They tried to claim your ham radio stuff was terrorist or something.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  Yeah, my dad had been a ham radio since he was young.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  Youngest kind of Texas ever, I think in the country.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  Exactly.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  He was one of the youngest people to ever get a ham radio license.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  And obviously he operated a ham radio down there where they would do what's called a phone patch
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  where someone from up here could call someone with a ham radio and relay it down to him.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  And so people could talk internationally on the phone.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  This was before the internet, before international phone lines even went down
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  to third world countries like Guatemala or were reliable.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  But yeah, that's true.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  People would say that he was working for the CIA,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  or they would say that he was working for the other side.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  And it was just a very convoluted thing.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  And he literally, the government literally came and confiscated all of his equipment
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  and made him shut down his ham radio operation.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  And he was really just an enthusiast.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  He would collect CQ cards, which is basically when ham radio people talk to each other.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  They send each other a card to prove that it happened.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  And he had it from all over the world, Africa, the Faroe Islands, Pitcairn Islands,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  which was a very, that was a really cool one.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  So he talked to people all around the world doing that.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  Did the Pitcairn where the bounty went?
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  Exactly. That's the mutiny on the bounty.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  So what that really underscores is that even when you have a society like that
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  and you have a government that is literally all-encompassing and militarized to the hilt
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  that when people don't like you or they have any sort of personal grudge
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  or there's a bad circumstance that, you know, they can make up stories.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  They can say that you were doing this and doing that.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  And it's already starting to happen here in the United States.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  You know, there's lots of recriminations that can fly around,
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  especially when there is, you know, that you have a government that is really militarized.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  And so that was a, yeah, that was an interesting example.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  I didn't even really thought about that.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  And once governments get like this, it always makes it explode and get worse.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  It doesn't make it get better. And the war on drugs is fueling it as well.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  Absolutely. One of the stories that, two of the stories I wanted to tell
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  and they're interesting from two perspectives is that my brother,
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  who just passed away earlier this year, was actually kidnapped twice in Guatemala
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  when he was a young child.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  And the reason why I said it from two perspectives is because the first time that he was kidnapped,
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  he was kidnapped by criminals who wanted to ransom.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  They basically saw a white kid that they could snatch up and they took him away
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  and they demanded a ransom.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  And luckily we got him back, you know, and the second time that my brother was kidnapped
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  was for political reasons, oddly enough.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  We were familiar with some people that were in the government there in Guatemala
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  and he was kidnapped and basically they were demanding the release of some prisoners
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  that they had for his release. And the story goes is that they made the exchange
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  but then they followed the people back to where their safe house was
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  and then they attacked the safe house and when they busted into the safe house
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  they found plans to basically attack the neighborhood that we lived in
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  which was full of military people and lots of different, you know, middle to upper class people.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  I want to hear about this. Tell the whole story when we get back
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  as this gets wilder and wilder, the heaven that is Central and South America.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  The Info Wars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2 ounce bottle

[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  Coming up in about five minutes, I will break down the latest on Obama supposedly attacking IS
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  or ISIS, ISIS. We told you that was coming for a while.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  We're going to break it all down.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  Coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  But first off, going back to my cousin, Buckley Hammond, who works at InfoWars.com,
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  you'll see his name on camera and in production and in graphics and music on my first film,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  destroyed by design and the next four films as well.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  And he's just back at the InfoWars base here.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  22 years ago, he would help me because he had a recording studio and stuff
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  and was already a successful DJ by the time he was out of high school.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  He would help me record commercials to then send to radio stations and say,
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  hey, I want to come there and cut commercials for you.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  And they'd laugh at me and stuff, but a few years later they weren't laughing anymore.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  So they're going to do mock radio shows.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  And then I went and turned to an access television.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  The rest is history, but here you are.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  So the first 11 years of your life growing up in Guatemala.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  And so your dad's down there as a school administrator.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  And he also, you guys bought some proper growing coffee and a lot of his buddies have moved down there after Vietnam.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  So there was a lot of government people there as well.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  And even I don't flu some planes for some folks.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  His other job was he was a pilot.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  You're in this government district.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  Start back over with these stories of how wondrous Guatemala was then.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  And then now what it's devolved into even worse.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  Well, the second story of my brother being kidnapped,
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  basically he was kidnapped by the Gediados,
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  which are the insurgent, military insurgent, left-wing military insurgents.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  And their plan was that they wanted to have some of their cronies released from prison that had been captured.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  So that was what their demands were.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  And when they did the exchange with Peter and the prisoners,
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  the intelligence services or something followed the Gediados back to where their safe house was.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  And then they assaulted the safe house and they came in.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  They assaulted the safe house.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  And when they went in, they saw all these plans laid out on a table.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  I mean, it's so ridiculous. It sounds like a movie.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  But they busted in and they found all these plans laid out on the table
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  where there was an assault and an attack that was just imminently about to happen in the neighborhood that we lived in.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  And so basically they were going to come back around and capture a lot more people.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  It was almost like they got too greedy.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  And so they basically, they marshaled a bunch of people and came into our neighborhood
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  and all the military was there and they were hiding behind our walls.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  In Guatemala, you have like four to six foot walls around everybody's house.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  And the assault happened and literally inside of while we were inside of our house
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  and we were lying on the ground.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  So we were staying below the, you know, the bullets.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  There was a big assault that happened in my backyard.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  The insurgents tried to come in and the military rebuffed them.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  And I mean, there was a, there were a lot of casualties.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  I was young and it was really chaotic and I can't really remember it the way that you would remember a scene from a movie or something like that.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  I do remember the whole experience and the circumstance.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  So the bottom line is, is that for a number of different reasons, whether it was criminal or whether it was political,
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  the turmoil in Guatemala is just, it was very vicious back in those days.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  But in one sense it was sort of directed, it was directed, you know, towards one side to the other, you know,
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  and the people were kind of in the middle.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  And now that has devolved into this absolute, you know, brutal anarchy where people are just running around,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  you know, murdering other people.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  And there's, there's all kinds of criminal behavior in the context of, you know, drugs and, and power.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  And you were talking about the article earlier when we put it on screen,
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  mainstream news article about 900 dead bus drivers in one year.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  Exactly. And that, I mean, that under,
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  Don't just take the wallet off the bus driver, just shoot him in the head.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  Well, I think that a lot of what that is is they charge extortion.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  So if you are a person that can't protect yourself, they don't have the ability to have guns in Guatemala
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  because just like Mexico, you know, they don't have the second.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  I told the story of the Mexican army pulling over the bus and taking all the guys money.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  Exactly.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  And him getting on crying.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  So if you can't protect yourself, this is the.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  But if I don't want to live like that, I'm a racist.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  Exactly.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  This is a perfect example of why the Second Amendment is important because if you can't protect yourself.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  But these people come up, get in the Democratic Party and are voting 90 plus percent of the time to take my guns on record.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  Absolutely.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  And the Mexican TV says, take our guns.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  And we'll turn them all in under political correctness.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  I'm telling you, I mean, this country is a joke now.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  It's an ideology that's clearly being pushed by those that want to control you.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  Because if you, if you have the capability to defend yourself, then you won't be robbed.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  I mean, it's just as, that's just as clear as day.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  And if people, they always say, you know, an armed society is a polite society.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  Well, what you have down there is the absolute inverse.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  It's a savage, brutal society with, you know, zero respect for life and zero compassion for other people.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  And what's interesting to me is that, you know, when this whole, we're talking about all of this because of the whole open border circumstance, right?
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  And the main group now is Guatemalans.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  Exactly.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  Or as Biden calls them, our children.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  And, you know, it's Guatemala and it's El Salvador and it's Honduras.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  And those are all the, they're all the poorest, like worst circumstances in Central America.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  And, you know, probably in this hemisphere, literally, I mean, there's some bad stuff that happens down in South America.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  But it is utterly lawless.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  And what is happening to me that is so, it's incredulous.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  I was saying incredible, but I was totally incredulous when I heard what was happening with them allowing all these people to come across.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  And to me, the issue is, is that the Liberals are going to paint this as, oh, let's be compassionate to these people.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  Let's, you know, they're just children that are, you know, children that are running from a war-torn circumstance and that they're, you know, that they're refugees.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  Well, in a sense, yes, that's true.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  But this has been going on for 36 years.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  It's not like it just started.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  So to me, that compassion rings utterly hollow because they're only saying that now in the context of the circumstance of these borders being opened.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  And they're letting all these thugs with tattoos all over their faces that would kill your kid for no reason at all whatsoever.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  It's mind-blowing.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  I mean, because in Guatemala and Mexico now, it's literal devil cults that are into total death and corruption and into dying young.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  And they just find a Border Patrol agent and his dad fishing and kill him in front of the mother for no reason.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  Not even because they were Border Patrol.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  They just wanted to rob him.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  And it's just, it's like, oh, you're so wonderful.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  We love you.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  And Robert Rodriguez says, la reconquista, la reconquista.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  As he lives, you know, he's got hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  Well, it's unconscionable.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  And it's just crazy town.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  It's unconscionable and it's utterly immoral.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  It's one of the most evil things that can happen on the face of the earth is to give power to people like that and let them ravage
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  the society.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  And, you know, I have to say that, you know, Guatemala is my home country.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  And I love the people down there.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  They are beautiful.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  They're hardworking.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  They're amazing, wonderful people with huge open hearts.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  They're fantastic people.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  And it just breaks my heart that this is happening to them.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  But they're fed on by a criminal class.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  And the way to help them is not to let them come across the border and become welfare recipients and under that power,
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  but to help them with self-determination, help them be able to get up by their bootstraps
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  and change what's happening inside of those countries by our influence,
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  which is what the USA through the CIA has been doing the absolute opposite of that for 36 years.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  So we are at fault to some degree with what is happening down there,
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  but it's not going to be fixed by letting them all come up here and take advantage of the system that we have.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  Well, especially when it's Akron and the Chicago mob,
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  literally planning to use them as mules and just exploit them and run fake tax returns through them.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  I mean, the Democratic Party literally is an organized crime syndicate.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  I mean, they run the rackets, everything.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  The thing that is one of the biggest ironies of this whole thing to me is that I just came from 10 years in Chicago,
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  is that Rahm Emanuel said, send them up here.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  Send them to Chicago!
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  You know what? First of all, Chicago can't even keep what's going on with themselves together.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  Chicago has one of the highest murder rates in the country.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  In the world.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  It's a beautiful, wonderful, amazing, gorgeous city, and I love it to death.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  But you got to fix your own house before you start inviting all this into your house.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  It's just so ludicrous. It doesn't make any sense to me at all whatsoever, from any perspective.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  And we're on the radio in Chicago, and they're great people.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  And one neighborhood's safe and nice, the next neighborhood's a literal, but it's just creeping in everywhere.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  The Democrats really are just, and I'm not glorifying Republicans, they've got all their own corruption problems.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  But the Democrats themselves really are deviants, Buckley.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  I mean, and by deviants, they really like screwing stuff up.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  They're the type of people that you'd invite to a party who would get up and crap in the punch bowl.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  I mean, I'm really serious.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  Yeah, absolutely. I believe that's true. And if you look at what's happening in Chicago,
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  if you look at a sort of a heat map of where all the murders have occurred in Chicago,
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  they're basically west of the city and then south, southwest of the city.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  And those are the two major Hispanic and black populations.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  So when you go down there and you actually drive through all these neighborhoods and you talk to these people,
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  you see that the vast majority of those people are on welfare.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  The vast majority of those people are trapped inside of that system,
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  and they are not going to self-determinate out of that because they're in a very vicious cycle.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  And that's what the liberals want to promote.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  They want to bring all these people up from Guatemala that are in a hellhole and put them into that system.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  Well, it'll kind of be a cherry on top then.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  Well, yeah, I guess so.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  But it just, if you back away from all the hysteria,
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  you pull out, you pull away from all the politics of everything else, it's irrational.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  And the only way that it could be rationalized is if they were looking for more people to control,
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  but to have more people that were dependent upon the state,
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  because it doesn't make any sense in any other...
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  Well, they admit it's clowered in heaven.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  It's a Gen 21. It's wrecked the country.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  Exactly.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  I mean, I was reading, we're in Chicago, all these new taxes Emmanuel put in,
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  something like when you sell your place, it's double the tax and just harassing everyone.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  And I mean, that's the model they want us to live under.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  Exactly. It's horrific.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  I mean, the taxes in Chicago are, I think they are literally the highest in the country.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  And let me tell you, like, downtown is gorgeous.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  They put out beautiful flowers and they really manicure it and everything else.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  But that city is utterly and literally one of the most corrupt cities in the United States.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  And it's an incubator for what the liberal policies...
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  And they run attacks against the Second Amendment out of there.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  It's an evil fortress of scum in government attacking anything good in the country.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  Exactly.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  Buckley Hammond, thanks for coming in.

[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?

[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  That's 888-622-37.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  In late 2001 they had generals and colonels, a colonel in special forces
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  told the San Francisco Chronicle first and one guy got kicked out of the army over it
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  because they said we would just bomb in placements of 12 and 14 year old conscripts
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  in front of Kabul and other areas.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  We would shell them and kill these little kids once we got there.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  We were not allowed to attack real al-Qaeda Taliban bases.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  They would then literally wait for us when we got there
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  and we would pay them in gold and load them on C-130s.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  This is one of the times of London had this about the gold
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  and fly them over the mountains to Pakistani intelligence.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  And I've had the former head of Pakistani intelligence, Hamid Ghulon
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  who won't talk to anybody else in the west,
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  who's the former head of the Pakistani intelligence
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  and ran the CIA operations there over defeating the Russians.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  And he concurs with my analysis. This is exactly what happened, okay?
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  So they fly them over to start the operation to destabilize Pakistan
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  and give the less than excuse to attack Pakistan.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  And then to stir up the rest of the radical Muslims there.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  So I'm going to explain. This is like putting fire ants in somebody's bed, okay?
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  That's what they do. They pour al-Qaeda in.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  They pour Akhani network people in. They pour.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  Then they give them Saudi funding. That's on record.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  And then they run around killing everybody,
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  but they don't want them getting into the Kurd area, the Shiite area.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  The deal, the triple cross with Iran and Saudi Arabia
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  is to divide up Iraq in three parts.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  Kurds get part of it. The IS gets a new part of it
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  to run their attacks into Syria forever.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  They're plausible in liability and give US weapons to them and other weapons.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  And then the Iranian Shiites get part of the south and east bordering Iran.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  That's what's going on. It's pure evil butchering the country,
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  deindustrializing it, killing over a million Iraqis,
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  all our troops dying, shutting it down,
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  and now turning it over to people that are killing every Christian in the nation.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  But when they start to get too far into the Kurd areas,
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  and we're going to blow up the dam and take the oil fields, oh, now Obama,
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  because he doesn't run them. He funds them and opens the door for them.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  When they start getting into the oil fields, oh, sorry,
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  you can have these oil fields to get your weapons and overthrow Syria.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  And diminish Jordan and all our supposed allies who our government's trying to overthrow.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  Egypt, Jordan, all of them. Al Qaeda's attacking Jordan now.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  Al Qaeda's attacking, I mean, because if the leaders were suit and ties
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  and women are somewhat free and you go to movie theaters and there's food on the shelves
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  and it's stable, the globalists don't want that.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  Just like they're shipping in people from failed third world nations here.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  They want to de-stabilize everything and screw everything up.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  It's called world government. That's what this is, and there's been heat on Obama,
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  not fighting him, so he's done this bombing as well.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  Totally fake.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  Probably bomb-dimpty buildings.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  Alex Jones and the GPM radio network.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  Total crap. Total bull.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000]  Like Clinton bombing that aspirin factory in Nigeria.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  Remember that?
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself,
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  than even outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000]  chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  back against.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  The new InfoWarsLife Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll 3-888-2533139.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:10.000]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  available.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine,
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000]  environmentally clean conditions.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:30.000]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  deep in the earth.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000]  Experience the new formula.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  Experience the ancient purity.

[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:08.000]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:33.000]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:39.000]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  We're here at the tip of the spear when it comes to promoting truth, justice the American way,
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  worldwide, the true spirit of 1776, not the counterfeit Illuminati spirit of 1776.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  And I started out the broadcast today talking about George Washington, who is one of the greatest men
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  who's ever led, if you know his true story, just an incredible person of integrity, of strength,
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  across the board of stamina, of endurance, of leadership, of male prowess.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  And he fought the Illuminati.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  You can read his letters, George Washington's letters on the Illuminati,
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  trying to take over Masonry in the United States, trying to control a revolution,
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  make it like the bloody French Revolution that came a few years later in 1800 or so that he predicted.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  A lot of people project that on the founding fathers and it's more sophisticated.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  It was a lot of Christians.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  It was a lot of deus, theus, a lot of different people that came together,
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  but it was a renaissance against all forms of oppression.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  And so there was a fake revolution in France out of the Illuminati to bring that in.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  Now, Katy Perry, and in fact, guys, I've got a stack of articles out there.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  I forgot to bring in when you bring me the Katy Perry articles in.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  Thank you.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  Katy Perry came out in a cover story in Rolling Stone last week.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  And I've had her dad on the show.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  She, of course, was married to Russell Brand.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  And Russell Brand has been on the show a few times and said he is a listener.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  He tried to get him back on.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  I like Russell.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  I think he's a real person.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  I don't agree with everything he says.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  He doesn't agree with me on everything.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  But he's a true seeker and they would listen to the show.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  That's part of their awakening.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  He got more away from wanting to be Illuminati.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  He asked, she got more into it.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  And I'm going to leave it at that because I was able to get to know Katy Perry's dad
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  because he's a pastor and friends with Dave Mustaine, of course, of Megadeth.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  But long story short, there really isn't an Illuminati.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  There is an Illuminati mindset, but the original Illuminati did exist.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  I've talked to high level movie stars and government people who have told me that they
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  have been part of sex orgy magic rituals under government facilities in places like London.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  Eyes wide shut stuff, but they're not killing anybody.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  But it's basically, you've seen the Rothschild photos that ended up getting one of them died
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  and it got released last year or so of images of dead babies and people wearing masks and
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  gassels.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  I mean, that stuff really goes on folks.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  And of course, I know some of the folks in the Kubrick family and they were really exposing
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  some stuff there.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  I'm just going to leave it at that as well.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  But John Lennon, before he died, was waking up to all this and did some songs about it.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  I'm not allowed to talk about that either.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  It's going to stop right there.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  But a lot of people confided in me.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  Pretty amazing information that not specific names or anything.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  I don't want to hit team to come kill me.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  The whole point is, is that there are these subgroups that carry it on.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  But really, satanic rituals, Luciferian rituals is more about hyping themselves up and being
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  willing to doing bizarre things.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  And that's the opposite of who George Washington was, a deep, devout Christian who spoke up
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  against it and fought it.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  But when Katy Perry comes out and says, People's Fam and the Illuminati and they mentioned
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  infowars.com in the news article, but I'm not, but I'd like to be part of it.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  That's what she's saying.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  They're adopting it as an archetype or as an image.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  We're almost every Super Bowl or almost every Grammy or Emmy.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  There's big pyramids, women as witches, fire shooting out, ritualized sex magic.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  Why is the elite showing this now?
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  Why are they pushing this now?
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  Why are they promoting this now?
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  Well, it's because they're trying to bring their great work in.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  I remember on the year 2000, they were going to cap the pyramid at Yeeza and then they said
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  this elite group on PBS they reported had decided the great work was not done yet and
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  they weren't going to cap it.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  But what is that great work?
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  Mark Dice has written a whole bunch of best-selling books on it.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  He's got a new book coming out.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  A lot of research on the Illuminati and we'll have Mark about 5-10 minutes into the next
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  hour.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  We have a guest coming in studio, a great lawyer friend of mine.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  But before we go any further, I want to give you the floor to break this down for people
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  because when you talk about the Illuminati, people that used to join the Illuminati at
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  the outer levels were the best people in society believing it was a renaissance.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  But in the inner group, it was actually about overthrowing all orders and trampling and
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  being trampled on and evil for evil's sake, turning the sky into fire, things like that.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  Extremely nihilistic, pro-death, pit-of-hell type garbage.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  That's my view on it.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  But they're just flaunting this.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Oh, you people think there's an Illuminati.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  Well, we want to join it.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  So it exists, but it doesn't exist and we're discredited and Weird Al Yankovic comes out
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  and makes fun of us.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  As it's all in our face, this is an attempt, I think, to roll out the next level of this.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  Mark Dice of markdice.com.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  Appreciate it.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  Yeah, five years ago, hardly anybody knew about the Illuminati or the only people who did
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  were in Patriot circles like your listeners and people had to seek out the truth to find
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  the Illuminati.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  But through social media, with Facebook and Twitter becoming so popular, the word has
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  gotten out Dan Brown's popular book, Angels and Demons was partially responsible for this,
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  but whitewashing the Illuminati, making them seem as if they were the good guys.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  And so we have an interesting scenario today where it went from being a very secretive
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  society to hardly anybody knowing about it.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  Only a few people had written books about it, too.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  Now, everybody supposedly thinks they know about it and it's become a part of pop culture.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  As you said, the cover of Rolling Stone this week is Katy Perry with an Illuminati eye
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  earring.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.500]  And in the article, they mentioned Info Wars, and she says, yeah, she wants to be a part
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:09.500]  of the Illuminati.
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:14.000]  And it's interesting, most people, the pop culture maniacs, believe that the Illuminati
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  is just a secret society of celebrities.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  And of course, in this Babylonian fallen society, that's the number one goal of most
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  people.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.500]  And it serves two purposes.
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:28.000]  It serves to condition the masses that their controllers are cool.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  They're the ultimate power structure that the little peon public want to be a part of.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  But this is also serving to help externalize the hierarchy because, as we know, the one
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  world coming religion is going to be that of Luciferianism or Satanism.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  And they're all building up this big new old order Orwellian police state unified currency
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.500]  to unleash this global messiah who will announce that he is God.
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:57.000]  This is a fulfillment of various prophecies and various religions.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.500]  And so when this ultimately happens, it could be 30 years.
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:01.500]  It could be 50 years.
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:09.000]  It seems that we're in the final few pages of this experiment because of these pop stars
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.500]  promoting the Illuminati as cool, promoting Satanism as cool.
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:17.000]  I mean, we have Kesha literally posting satanic pentagrams on our Facebook page, drinking
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.500]  out of a heart, drinking blood out of a heart on stage.
[01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:27.500]  And this global Masonic messiah, this counterfeit Christ will be hailed as the new king of the
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:34.000]  world as unveiling this royal secret of the secret societies, which is ultimately that
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  they have been worshiping Lucifer.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  And it's interesting to see this pop culture Illuminati brand sort of muddy the water so
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.500]  much that most people have no idea about the real Illuminati.
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:50.000]  You mentioned some of the real actual history of it in the past.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.500]  Adam Weissop, the founder of the Bavarian Illuminati, the very southern state in Germany where he
[01:41:55.500 --> 01:42:00.500]  founded this really modernized the ancient mystery school secret society.
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:01.500]  He was a communist.
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:08.300]  I mean, he was a tyrant, a scumbag, unlike our founding fathers who wrote out their grievances
[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:12.500]  on paper, signed their name to it and sent it to the king.
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:18.600]  Adam Weissop took a different approach and that was to deceive other people that he supposedly
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:24.540]  was helping with his Illuminati organization and we can get into some of the actual writings
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:25.540]  I could read.
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:26.540]  Adam Yeah, let's talk about that.
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:30.340]  Because I've read those and I mean, they're public, it's in Cyclopedia Britannica, but
[01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:34.780]  you've gone out and dug out the actual manuscripts that have larger quotes, how they would manipulate
[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:38.420]  the best in society to believe the Illuminati had this great goal.
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:42.740]  Well, if we want to help the immigrant children, turn your guns in for the children.
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:47.380]  But in truth, their plan was the overthrow of reality itself and the destruction of human
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:49.380]  lives.
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:54.260]  Everything we see today, it's been modernized, but it has roots back to this cabal, is Adam
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:55.260]  Weissop's cabal.
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:59.020]  And you know, the people that go to Wikipedia for a source say, oh, well, it was it was
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:02.420]  abolished and disintegrated in 1787.
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:03.860]  That's what Wikipedia says.
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:09.340]  Well, there was actually a fourth edict by the Duke of Bavaria issued and edict is an
[01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:15.220]  act of law denouncing the Illuminati and he wrote out these several edicts calling for
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:20.180]  them to be arrested and saying that anybody else associated with them would be imprisoned,
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:21.180]  etc.
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:27.980]  But after the supposed mainstream historians of the Wikipedia unreliable page says that
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:34.940]  they were extinguished three years later in 1790, the Duke of Bavaria issued a fourth
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:40.180]  edict where he actually said that they were continuing to expand.
[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:42.060]  I mean, I could read some of the edict here.
[01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:47.340]  George Washington wrote parcels of letters to crying their their infiltration of the
[01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:54.220]  U.S. military as after he was president after he retired and their infiltration of masonry.
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:58.980]  And that was after they were supposedly extinguished and the person who took over the Illuminati
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:05.380]  after Adam Weissop had fled Bavaria was a man named JJ C. Bode, Johann Bode.
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:07.740]  And his journal has been published.
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:13.460]  And he met with some high-level masons in France and introduced in his own journal,
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:18.420]  he says, that he introduced the Illuminati into Masonic lodges into what he called they
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:23.780]  renamed it the Philadelphes and into the Jacobin Society, as you had mentioned earlier.
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:30.180]  And so he literally imported the Illuminar export of the Illuminati into France to prepare
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:34.940]  for the French Revolution, of course, that's called a conspiracy theory today.
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:38.980]  And many people will point to George Washington being a mason, many of the founding fathers
[01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:41.780]  say, well, George Washington was a master mason.
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:47.220]  Well, a master mason, as you know, Alex, is only a third level, has nothing to do even
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:48.220]  with the Scottish right.
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:49.220]  Well, exactly.
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:52.300]  Plus, I'm not even defending masonry, but I mean, I've had a lot of family that were
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:55.180]  high-level masons, the best people you could imagine.
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:45:02.660]  It was giant ancient mystery schools that went back to King Solomon's temple and beyond.
[01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:07.980]  And so within masonry and the higher degrees are basically all the secret pre-Christian
[01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:10.660]  stuff, including Judaic.
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:14.780]  So if you really want to get into it, it's Egyptian and Judaic, and it actually gets
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:18.260]  into the white priesthood of Egypt.
[01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:19.860]  And then you have kind of the Sith.
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:22.540]  That's the Star Wars modern cosmologies.
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:25.940]  You have the Sith that are the dark side of it.
[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:28.140]  And then you have the Jedis that are the good side of it.
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:31.260]  And of course, that's New Agey because it's the old age.
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:32.260]  It's ancient.
[01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:33.540]  I'm not even defending it.
[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:36.460]  It's just that it wasn't something to supplant Christianity.
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:39.620]  It was the masons that built most of the cathedrals in Europe.
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:46.820]  It's that it always had that Illuminati Sith vein in it, and then it was reflowering under
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:49.460]  the Jacobins and under Adam Weisop.
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:55.340]  Manly P. Hall, 33rd degree mason, considered to be masonry's greatest philosopher by the
[01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:59.540]  governing body of Freemasonry, wrote in his book, The Secret Teachings of All Ages, which
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:05.820]  your viewers can see is here on my shelf, that he believed that the secret societies,
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:09.780]  the mystery schools, got taken over, like you said, you'd call them the Sith, making
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:17.300]  it Star Wars reference, but got taken over by corrupt men that hijacked these really
[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:23.660]  just early fraternities, early universities, and then kept everybody out of the way, kept
[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:31.620]  everybody dumbed down, and it's a perversion, really, of the ancient and early sciences.
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:35.860]  In many masonic books themselves, I mean, they will admit that Freemasonry is a secret
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:40.340]  society within a secret society.
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:44.340]  If you read the original writings, I hated history in school, but I've come to love
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:46.780]  it in the last 10 years or so.
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:51.580]  They try to make it as boring as possible and only create division with it, and basically
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:53.860]  teach baloney.
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:57.460]  If you actually look, people talking about the Illuminati of this, and it's becoming
[01:46:57.460 --> 01:47:02.220]  a joke, really, if you search social media, because so many people think they know about
[01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:03.220]  it.
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:06.740]  Oh, yeah, it's a big pickup line now for like 18-year-old women to tell them, hey, come
[01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:10.620]  and have sex with me, and I'll teach you about the Illuminati, and then the idiots doing
[01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:15.820]  it have no idea it's like people pretending to be Nigerian princes.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:21.100]  I have people from Nigeria contacting me because there's people out there offering to join
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:22.900]  the Illuminati and charging money.
[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:27.540]  We had a big figure, an infomercial guy out here in America that sold memberships basically
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:32.780]  and said that a secret council of former Illuminati members joined him, and you could learn the
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:35.140]  Illuminati secrets for $1,000.
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:36.140]  But the real…
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:41.140]  That was Kevin Trudeau, by the way, who I had no idea five, six years ago when he wanted
[01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:42.140]  to come on the show on the air.
[01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:46.620]  I knew him from promoting Herbs and his book, and hey, y'all have a right to sell a book.
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:51.740]  I had no idea his other books literally said that, and then he said he saw aliens at Area
[01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:57.140]  51 and that the aliens talked to him, and I went to dinner with him, and he said, yes,
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:58.140]  I saw the aliens.
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:01.700]  And I said, dude, you're full of bull, I can tell your line, and I left, and I'm not
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:05.380]  throwing him under the bus, it's just that, yeah, he's another one of these guys.
[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:09.220]  Yeah, I used to be a big fan of Kevin Trudeau and have a lot of respect for him as well.
[01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:12.580]  No, no, he wrote some good books that I read, but he also wrote Pure Crap.
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:13.580]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:18.380]  Yeah, he was a slick talking salesman, and unfortunately, he went off the rail and tried
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:22.820]  to take advantage of this Illuminati hype, and the global information network that he
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:30.700]  started, JIN, was $1,000 to join in $150 a month to supposedly learn the insider Illuminati
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:33.700]  secrets from supposed members that have defected.
[01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:34.700]  And who knows?
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:39.020]  Maybe he believes you're telling the truth, he saw the aliens at Area 51 and saw the little
[01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:41.180]  dead bodies, and I'm not trying to even attack him.
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:43.660]  The point is, I was just backing up what you said.
[01:48:43.660 --> 01:48:47.940]  Yeah, I didn't want to throw him under the bus either, but the point is that in this
[01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:53.780]  pop culture mania, the real core Illuminati, the facts have almost gotten buried.
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:58.660]  My book, The Illuminati, Facts and Fiction, came out in 2009, five years ago, before it
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:03.140]  really started getting to get out of control, and if you really want to know the truth and
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:07.020]  the core of the Illuminati, you can look and find their actual original writings.
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:14.460]  In fact, you republished proofs of this conspiracy that I read when I was 15 years old, and my
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:18.460]  dad had an original copy about 100 years old, or not an original, it would be 200 years
[01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:24.380]  old, but he had a reprint from 1898 or something that I read all about the Illuminati.
[01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:30.420]  Yeah, a science professor called Natural Philosophy back then named John Robison published
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:36.100]  a book which is still available today, I republished it, Proofs of a Conspiracy, and he included
[01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:38.620]  many of the original confiscated writings.
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:43.300]  I mean, it's incredible because back then there was obviously no radio, no television,
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:48.740]  but there were bookstores and magazines and newspapers, and I mean, straight from Adam
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:53.940]  Weissop's own pen, he wrote, by establishing reading societies and subscription libraries
[01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:58.500]  and taking these under our direction, and supplying them through our labors, we may
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:01.780]  turn the public mind whichever way we want.
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:07.340]  In a like manner, we will obtain influence in the military academies, the printing houses,
[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:12.660]  bookseller shops, and in short, all offices which have any effect in either forming or
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:16.140]  managing or directing the mind of man.
[01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:21.620]  We will get the literary journals, we will take carefully timed pieces, meaning articles,
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:27.460]  to make citizens and the princes a little more noticed for certain little slips, meaning
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:29.300]  to use the media to attack the people.
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:33.340]  I mean, he even wrote about using feminism to break down the family, and this was over
[01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:34.340]  200 years ago.
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:38.380]  There's no way of influencing men so powerfully as by the means of women.
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:39.620]  These should be our chief study.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:43.780]  We should insinuate ourselves in their good opinion, use hints of emancipation from the
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:48.860]  tyranny of public opinion, and of standing up for themselves, and they will be serving
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:52.380]  us with zeal without even knowing it.
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:59.700]  And now Madonna and Katy Perry kneel to the Illuminati and beg to be given mittens on
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:01.380]  the plain of southern England.
[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:05.860]  Summer is here, and nothing looks better than tanned skin and white teeth.
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:11.180]  Hi, I'm Jonathan Greenhut, the CEO of Power Swabs, and if you want to have whiter teeth

[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:03.540]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:09.020]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhog and his team of patriots over at MyPatriots supply.
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:12.340]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:16.460]  direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick
[01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:17.460]  buck.
[01:52:17.460 --> 01:52:21.420]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:25.420]  MyPatriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:30.700]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men
[01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:31.700]  and women.
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:36.700]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach, and that's why I stock MyPantry
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:39.900]  with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriots supply.
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:45.100]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:51.540]  storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:54.580]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:57.220]  Do business with someone who shares your values.

[01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:05.940]  We travel so much and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind.
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:11.820]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional
[01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:15.180]  burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:20.220]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me a great peace of mind to set my fake TV near
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:24.740]  a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching
[01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:27.580]  TV when I'm actually away from home.
[01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:32.140]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:36.420]  And they're so easy to use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go, plus they're
[01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:39.860]  so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:43.340]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with pre-shipping.
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:50.380]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5 FAKE TV or go to faketv.com.
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:56.900]  That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[01:53:56.900 --> 01:54:12.700]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:40.700]  It's a great radio interview, a lot of great constitutional information.
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:45.900]  He was a cop for a long time in Austin, and I ran into him at a concert a while back.
[01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:49.180]  But the point is, is that he's going to be in studio with us, talking about a lot of
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:51.100]  different issues.
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:55.540]  Before we go any further, we've got five minutes left here and five minutes the next segment
[01:54:55.540 --> 01:55:00.020]  with Mark Dice, so I want to invite back again very, very soon.
[01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:05.740]  But when you look at what he was just reading Adam Weishaupt's letters there that are public
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:10.060]  and that the German government was able to get and confirm, it's all the things we see
[01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:11.060]  today.
[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:13.840]  This is an Illuminati conspiracy.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.860]  This is their program of human control.
[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:21.660]  People ask, well, its roots go back to Germany and France, but where is it today?
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:26.220]  Well, there's clear evidence they founded Skull and Bones at Yale, and I want Mark who's
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:28.020]  an expert on that to speak to that.
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:30.180]  It then founded CIA.
[01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:31.900]  That's indisputable.
[01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:41.060]  And even major directors put out movies like The Good Shepherd where it shows a king doing
[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:47.220]  satanic rituals dressed up as death with him bathing in feces and being urinated on.
[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:53.820]  Now, I mean, let me tell you, that's just when they're 20 years old folks.
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:56.820]  And it just gets crazier from there.
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:59.460]  So let's get into that, Mark Dice.
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:03.700]  What are the errors to the Illuminati today, more on Skull and Bones and other areas?
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:08.020]  Because when you see Katy Perry people, they're groveling, I guess, to make the Illuminati
[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:14.860]  the new royalty, which they claim they wanted to overthrow, but now they're becoming, worshipping
[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:15.860]  them.
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:22.220]  Yeah, you can see a clear line in history from the Illuminati to Skull and Bones, to
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:27.060]  the Council on Foreign Relations founded in 1921, which your audience is familiar with,
[01:56:27.060 --> 01:56:31.140]  the general public thinks it's a committee in Congress, to the Bilderberg group, which
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:34.140]  supposedly just didn't exist for 60 years.
[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:38.740]  And then, well, now it does exist, but it's just not important to the Bohemian Grove.
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:44.020]  But there's a couple interesting direct connections between the Skull and Bones Society over there
[01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:48.540]  at Yale University and the original Bavarian Illuminati in Germany.
[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:52.180]  Most people familiar a little bit with Skull and Bones, of course, it's just said to be
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:56.340]  a fraternity, even though the members don't join until they're a senior.
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:57:01.220]  It's actually a senior society gearing them for a postgraduate network, but you'll never
[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:02.780]  hear that in the mainstream press.
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:05.060]  It's just a fraternity of rich kids.
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:11.780]  So Skull and Bones founded in 1832 coincidentally enough, but directly after one of the founders,
[01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:16.900]  William Huntington Russell, was studying over in Germany abroad, just around that same time
[01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:22.140]  that the Illuminati went deeper into hiding, was expanding their activity and their membership.
[01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:27.980]  So we have one of the founding members of Skull and Bones again, a senior society, studying
[01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:33.660]  in Germany where the Illuminati is active, comes over, found Skull and Bones, the first
[01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:39.580]  secret society at Yale University, the first senior society, who, of course, their symbols
[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:43.220]  are all of death and devil worship, but that's not the only connection.
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:45.220]  We have a break-in.
[01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:51.180]  Somebody broke in, some students broke into the Skull and Bones headquarters in 1876,
[01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:53.740]  and they called themselves File and Claw.
[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:55.460]  They published a newsletter.
[01:57:55.460 --> 01:58:00.620]  They used the file and filed away some of the security bars in the headquarters there,
[01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:06.320]  where, by the way, the members have a session every Thursday night and every Sunday night
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:12.340]  to prep them for their positions potentially within the power structure.
[01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:13.780]  No alcohol is served, of course.
[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:14.780]  It's not a party.
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:17.780]  It's a preparatory school for the elite, invisible empire.
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:20.260]  We can get more into it on the other side of the break.
[01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:26.100]  That's right, and of course, if your son may have five kids, but this son looks like
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:29.500]  a good prospect, you're sending him, if he doesn't like to worship Satan and have orgies
[01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:34.340]  with males and females, he's not going to be ready to cut babies' hearts out later.
[01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:38.260]  And again, cutting a baby's heart out just gets you ready to burn a country down.
[01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:40.260]  Hail Satan, they say.
[01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:42.820]  Well, not me, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:48.300]  You can see Satan's world, open borders, Ebola being promoted, dollar being devalued,
[01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:55.020]  abortion gaps, city of Austin tap water versus filtered city of Austin tap water.
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:56.420]  I didn't taste dirt in it.
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:57.780]  God knows what's in this.
[01:58:57.780 --> 01:59:01.900]  These people just sampled city of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:07.220]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered for the Crow Pure G2.0 filtration
[01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:08.220]  system.
[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:09.220]  That one is better.
[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:10.220]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:11.220]  Yep.
[01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:12.220]  I know what it tastes like.
[01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:13.220]  It's good water.
[01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:17.540]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:18.540]  others.
[01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:22.620]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including
[01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:25.420]  tooth decay, lower in IQ, and even cancer.
[01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:28.140]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:34.020]  The Crow Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:36.020]  tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:37.540]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:38.540]  It's good water.
[01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:39.540]  Refreshing.
[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:40.540]  It's good.

[01:43:25.120 --> 02:00:42.140]  but I want to talk about what these students found when they broke into
[02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:43.540]  the skull and bones headquarters.
[02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:46.500]  And I certainly don't advocate burglary, but this is what happened.
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:52.140]  They broke into this headquarters in 1876, wrote a newsletter, published it, spread it
[02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:53.420]  around campus.
[02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:58.260]  And inside this headquarters, which has no windows where they meet every Thursday and
[02:00:58.260 --> 02:01:03.180]  Sunday night for sessions to prepare them for their positions where no alcohol again
[02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:07.140]  is served because, you know, just taking over the world's serious business, they found a
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:12.060]  plaque on the wall written in German that was given to them by their German brothers.
[02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:18.380]  They also found a plaque with four human skulls, a picture of four human skulls, and below
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:20.460]  it was written in German.
[02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:21.700]  Which one is the king?
[02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:23.000]  Which one is the beggar?
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.180]  Which one is the wise man?
[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:26.100]  And which one is the fool?
[02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:30.060]  And so many people may not understand what that means, but if you read John Robeson's
[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:35.140]  book, one of the first, the first book really written about the Illuminati in English, again
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:40.700]  covering the original confiscated writings that were confiscated on three different occasions
[02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:47.220]  in Germany, he explained one of the induction rituals to a particular level of the Bavarian
[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:48.220]  German Illuminati.
[02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:54.140]  And a candidate was shown a skull and asked whether it was a king, a wise man, a beggar,
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.220]  or a fool.
[02:01:55.220 --> 02:01:59.540]  And then the answer to the riddle is to them, they said, well, it doesn't matter because
[02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:01.300]  all is the same in death.
[02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:04.940]  And what that means to them is they don't believe in any sort of an afterlife, it's
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:07.420]  a social Darwinistic philosophy.
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:11.780]  And so we have the founder of skull and bones studying in Germany where the Illuminati is
[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:17.460]  active, when the Illuminati is expanding, first expanding, coming back, starting a secret
[02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:23.340]  society that became so powerful and presidents, starting the CIA, starting the American educational
[02:02:23.340 --> 02:02:28.060]  society, the historical society, et cetera, you know, just largely responsible for starting
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:30.300]  all these bogus wars based on lies.
[02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:34.980]  So we have this group with the same goals, the same symbols, the same rituals, the same
[02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:39.140]  language, I mean, by the way, they eat off of Adolf Hitler's silverware reportedly during
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:40.420]  their Sunday session.
[02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:46.740]  So it's not just a conspiracy theory, it's not a fraternity, it's this clear indications
[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:52.260]  that they were directly connected to the skull and bone or to the Bavarian German Illuminati.
[02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:56.460]  Of course, they kneel down and kiss a human skull and are given a new name and mostly
[02:02:56.460 --> 02:03:03.220]  demonic names like Long Devil or Beelzebub or Baal as they're reborn into this brotherhood
[02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:09.660]  of death, which teaches them the secret of Satanism, the royal secret, which is their
[02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:14.620]  philosophy, which is carried on in secret, which now we have, again, being promoted in
[02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:20.740]  the mainstream by pop stars, you know, just promoting Satanism as cool as we can see.
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:26.140]  Christianity is completely under assault, you know, it's fine to criticize and blaspheme
[02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:32.220]  and defame Jesus and Christianity, but you can't criticize certain other religions, otherwise
[02:03:32.220 --> 02:03:34.060]  bad things will happen to your career.
[02:03:34.060 --> 02:03:40.380]  Katy Perry, by the way, of course, you know, scrubbed a necklace that was considered blasphemous
[02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:44.820]  to the Muslims in her, you know, Illuminati themed dark horse, dark horse of the apocalypse
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:49.580]  music video because Muslims started a petition because she used black magic and destroyed
[02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:54.820]  a figure who had an all-law penance, you know, God in Arabic.
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:58.380]  So they bow down to that, but of course, it's cool for her to be burning Christians
[02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:03.260]  at the stake during her Grammy performance as well, and, you know, it was interesting.
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:07.300]  Last month, the Bohemian Grove happened another, you know, just an offshoot of this, you know,
[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:10.660]  Satanic brotherhood, this invisible empire.
[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:15.420]  Of course, not a word in any of the mainstream press, as you know, the Bilderberg group slowly
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:19.940]  has been covered a little bit because they can't, they can't cover it up with social
[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:24.460]  media, with shows like yours, it would be obvious at this point that there is a coverup.
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:28.540]  So occasionally, last couple of years, we've seen a little bit in the mainstream about
[02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:29.540]  the Bilderberg group.
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:33.620]  It is somewhat easy to dismiss it as, oh, it's just a private meeting.
[02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:36.820]  Don't worry about the fact that we haven't mentioned it for the last 60 years.
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:40.100]  But not a word of the Bohemian Grove because, well, how do you possibly explain the cremation
[02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:42.980]  of care when you see the photos of the video, which you, of course, face to face with God?
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:47.820]  Or Henry Kissinger in drag, bending over, doing something.
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:51.580]  And I've seen that there, a photo of that hanging on a tree when I was there, while
[02:04:51.580 --> 02:04:54.980]  Kissinger was there, and it was horrifying.
[02:04:54.980 --> 02:04:56.980]  Mark Dice, markdice.com, great job.
[02:04:56.980 --> 02:04:57.980]  We'll have you back up soon.
[02:04:57.980 --> 02:04:58.980]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:04.980]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:07.860]  much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:12.660]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:16.980]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:22.580]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group, you now know it as survival shield,
[02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:25.580]  true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:29.220]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to
[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:33.060]  come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:37.460]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:42.300]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:46.420]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com.
[02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:50.900]  The radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:55.220]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.

[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:08.420]  This is alert.
[02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:09.420]  Security.
[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:10.420]  Alert.
[02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:11.420]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:06:11.420 --> 02:06:12.420]  Analysis.
[02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:16.420]  Infowars building independent media operation.
[02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:20.420]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:06:20.420 --> 02:06:22.420]  Prime Directive discredit Alex Jones.
[02:06:22.420 --> 02:06:25.420]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[02:06:25.420 --> 02:06:28.420]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Infowars.
[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:31.420]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:33.420]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:35.420]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:37.420]  They are never going to stop.
[02:06:37.420 --> 02:06:41.420]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:53.420]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy.
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:56.420]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:06:56.420 --> 02:06:57.420]  Electrally.
[02:06:57.420 --> 02:06:58.420]  It's begun.
[02:06:58.420 --> 02:07:00.420]  You can fail it.
[02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:04.420]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself.
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:08.420]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:11.420]  Not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:07:11.420 --> 02:07:15.420]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:20.420]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:24.420]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:07:24.420 --> 02:07:28.420]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:32.420]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:07:32.420 --> 02:07:37.420]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:42.420]  in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[02:07:42.420 --> 02:07:46.420]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:53.420]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:07:53.420 --> 02:08:14.420]  For more information, now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:17.420]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:17.420 --> 02:08:24.420]  This is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:08:24.420 --> 02:08:30.420]  I don't want to be there, in your arms and not yours.
[02:08:30.420 --> 02:08:34.420]  I don't want to be in your British hell.
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:36.420]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:41.420]  We're here Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central and then I return live.
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:48.420]  I'll be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Shuntful Standard Time in this studio covering all the important news.
[02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:58.420]  I'll be on the nightly news tonight 7 o'clock central doing a special report detailing and documenting what I spent 10 minutes on in the last hour.
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:03.420]  Getting into the fact that Al Qaeda is called IS now or ISIS.
[02:09:03.420 --> 02:09:05.420]  They're being protected.
[02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:10.420]  They're giving a third of the country of Iraq to them but they started taking over current areas.
[02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:16.420]  So now they've been bombed and that lets Obama act like NATO and others aren't funding them.
[02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:26.420]  So again, this is a great example of full spectrum dominance and how the system controls the drug trade, controls the money laundering and then bust the little people.
[02:09:26.420 --> 02:09:28.420]  Just like they run the terrorism.
[02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:39.420]  Now the terrorists are real and that threat does go on but it's way overblown and it's protected and shepherded and allowed to thrive as a pretext for the military industrial complex.
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:42.420]  It was declassified in 1972.
[02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:47.420]  Congressional hearings hit in 1997 with a CIA inspector general.
[02:09:47.420 --> 02:09:51.420]  I watched those hearings live on C-SPAN, played clips of it on the radio that night.
[02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:53.420]  It was huge.
[02:09:53.420 --> 02:10:02.420]  It was on none of the news but it was on C-SPAN them admitting yes, we've been shipping most of the cocaine in for decades and then we distributed it on the streets and we're going to stop now.
[02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:07.420]  Now when in Vietnam they were shipping in most of the opium out of Vietnam and then they're going to stop now.
[02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:21.420]  In Iraq they're growing the opium and making the troops grow it and then it gets shipped in and if you get caught with it or your kid gets on it or you get caught with synthetic stuff from your doctor and that you go out because you got back pain, you're going to go to jail.
[02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:22.420]  That's a disease.
[02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:23.420]  That's abuse.
[02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:28.420]  That's not a reason to put some money in prison but we have the biggest prison population in the world.
[02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:30.420]  Three million people behind bars any one time.
[02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:32.420]  There's seven million in the system.
[02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:34.420]  That's more than communist China.
[02:10:34.420 --> 02:10:41.420]  Well meanwhile the borders wide open, illegals are pouring in in mass and they can be felons and they're released.
[02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:43.420]  It's just crazy town.
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:45.420]  And the average cop I know totally agrees with me.
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:46.420]  It's totally freaked out.
[02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:56.420]  I've had Travis County prosecutors come to my office tell me about all the stuff that's going on, how they want decriminalization, how it's the big prisons lobbying for all these drug laws to keep people in the system.
[02:10:56.420 --> 02:11:08.420]  And yeah, you can use drug laws to get criminals that are doing other really bad stuff, robbing people and stuff, but the drug trade keeps the price up and that's what lets the higher level dealers basically profit from all this.
[02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:11.420]  And Jamie Malaysia is an amazing guy.
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:16.420]  I've known him for three or four years but I've seen his billboards and heard him on the radio.
[02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:30.420]  And if you live in Texas, you know about the DWI dude who fights back against the police state that we have in this country where they're taking blood without warrants on the side of the highway all under federal grants.
[02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:32.420]  And this is happening all over the country.
[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:39.420]  And of course he wrote a book that became a really big seller breaking all this down that we sell it at info or store.com.
[02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:42.420]  But he's with us because he's thrown his hat in the ring.
[02:11:42.420 --> 02:11:52.420]  Even if he doesn't win, he'll inject sanity and we appreciate that into the debates that are on TV, into all the radio interviews he'll do.
[02:11:52.420 --> 02:12:09.420]  I mean, it's really exciting to see this type of stuff going on when you get into the libertarian realm, trying to not just get tea party people elected, but folks you could call kind of Republican on some issues, Democrat on others,
[02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:13.420]  but really just an old-fashioned Texas guy who wants freedom.
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:16.420]  So he's a really good guy and Jamie joins us.
[02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:20.420]  DWIdude.com is his main law firm site.
[02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:25.420]  You can find out about his 2014 run for Texas Attorney General there.
[02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:33.420]  And again, it's important for him because he's a smart guy, well-spoken, has the facts, is a former police officer from Austin.
[02:12:33.420 --> 02:12:43.420]  Most of the guys that work for him are former police officers and he's one of the most successful law firms in the country defending people from violations of their constitutional rights.
[02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:49.420]  When you pull up to Arde Sveta's and Art's a nice guy, but still he's doing stuff, getting federal grants, I'm against.
[02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:51.420]  Just like when he wants gun control.
[02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:54.420]  Mr. Malaysia is not for that. We'll get his view on that.
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:56.420]  It's unconstitutional.
[02:12:56.420 --> 02:12:58.420]  I need to show signs of being impaired.
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:12:59.420]  I need to be driving recklessly.
[02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:03.420]  I don't need to have a breathalyzer shoved in my face.
[02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:06.420]  I mean, that's not America, folks, and it doesn't keep us safe.
[02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:12.420]  And mad and others are just used to expand the police state, not actually stop the dangerous drunk drivers that are out there.
[02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:14.420]  Now, my rant's done.
[02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:16.420]  I just know some stations join us in the third hour.
[02:13:16.420 --> 02:13:23.420]  DWIdude.com and he's a criminal justice system for 35 years.
[02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:27.420]  He has a true passion for defending people's legal rights.
[02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:37.420]  Jamie has been able to win the so-called unwinnable cases or bring more experienced training and desire to the courtroom than the state or any other lawyers can.
[02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:41.420]  He's testified as an expert witness in felony cases and on drug alcohol issues.
[02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:48.420]  He's also assisted other attorneys in DWI cases reduced due to his analysis of the police officer performance.
[02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:54.420]  Jamie truly believes that you shouldn't have to pay for DWI or criminal conviction for the rest of your life.
[02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:56.420]  And he joins us now.
[02:13:56.420 --> 02:14:03.420]  That's quite a rant, Jamie, but you're here running as the libertarian candidate for Texas Attorney General.
[02:14:03.420 --> 02:14:10.420]  And I think you bring a lot of balance to the extreme left that's up there and the extreme good old boy right.
[02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:18.420]  I see a Texas case here where a guy that made pot brownies is facing seven years to more for making pot brownies for his buddies.
[02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:21.420]  I mean, that's not the kind of country I want to live in.
[02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:28.420]  I don't want to live in a country where when somebody drives in with Colorado plates, the state police pull them over because we think they got dope in the car.
[02:14:28.420 --> 02:14:35.420]  I talk to cops. I say, look, Bank of America, Wells Fargo on record, Wacovia, laundering hundreds of billions in drug money.
[02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:39.420]  Here's the news article. Why don't you go after them?
[02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:43.420]  I mean, they're owning the aircraft, running the flights, getting the weapons.
[02:14:43.420 --> 02:14:45.420]  They're like, well, we're not allowed to go after them.
[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:52.420]  We go after a teenager dumb enough to be driving around with it with a half ounce of marijuana in their car and then it wrecks their life.
[02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:54.420]  Sucks them into the system. Modern slavery.
[02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:56.420]  Jamie Balasia, thanks for coming in.
[02:14:56.420 --> 02:14:59.420]  Appreciate it. It's wonderful to be here.
[02:14:59.420 --> 02:15:02.420]  Now, I was thinking about things my dad told me when I was growing up.
[02:15:02.420 --> 02:15:08.420]  And one of the things he really insisted on us living by was you don't kick somebody when they're down.
[02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:12.420]  And when somebody pays the price for something, the slate's clean.
[02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:18.420]  It's time to give him a fresh shot and a fresh chance at something that I was reading on your TV screen.
[02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:20.420]  Then he said, slavery still exists.
[02:15:20.420 --> 02:15:25.420]  And I was thinking about in the criminal justice system, you know, we put them in chains.
[02:15:25.420 --> 02:15:27.420]  We lock them up in cages.
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:30.420]  It sounds an awful lot like the old slavery routine.
[02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:38.420]  One of the things that never fails to amaze me is when you consider the voting patterns of the minorities in our country,
[02:15:38.420 --> 02:15:44.420]  what has the Democratic Party or the Democrat Party done for minorities?
[02:15:44.420 --> 02:15:53.420]  Except in some ways, loosely enslaved them mentally and psychologically and just repeating the same old thing over and over again.
[02:15:53.420 --> 02:15:57.420]  I was talking to a woman in Dallas.
[02:15:57.420 --> 02:16:06.420]  She's an African American advocate for civil rights reform and especially her son was basically murdered by the Dallas Police Department.
[02:16:06.420 --> 02:16:16.420]  If you read the story and I asked her on a podcast, I said, why do the minorities insist on repeating to vote for the Democratic?
[02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:22.420]  I mean, the Democrat candidate in these elections, what have the Democrats done for you?
[02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:28.420]  And I said, the Libertarian Party were for less government, were for freedom, were for decriminalizing marijuana.
[02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:33.420]  So we stopped locking up all the young blacks and destroying their futures with a drug conviction.
[02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:40.420]  And the more we talked by the end of the conversation, she told me that not only was she in support of me for a Texas Attorney General,
[02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:48.420]  but she was going to tell all of her friends to go and look at my website and to consider voting for a change from the same old thing.
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:55.420]  I told her, I said, you know, the Republicans, all the successful Republicans I know, when I knew them in college, they were all smoking weed.
[02:16:55.420 --> 02:17:00.420]  They didn't get busted. They didn't get put in jail. They didn't lose their college financial aid.
[02:17:00.420 --> 02:17:05.420]  They didn't lose their careers. And look at the man in the White House.
[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:09.420]  He was hot box and all over Hawaii and everywhere else he went.
[02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:11.420]  He was on cocaine, they basically admit.
[02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:18.420]  Yeah, especially at Harvard. I think that was most of the work he did, not writing on any kind of a student newspaper.
[02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:24.420]  It was just partying. So why are they holding us to a double standard? Why are they ruining kids' futures?
[02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:28.420]  The issue of forfeiture you were talking about.
[02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:38.420]  You know, if these people are sincere about stopping addictive behavior, then why don't we earmark 50 to 75% of all the forfeiture funds
[02:17:38.420 --> 02:17:44.420]  and that they must not go to law enforcement and not to the district attorney's office and not to the DEA.
[02:17:44.420 --> 02:17:47.420]  But let's put them in job training for people who are in prison.
[02:17:47.420 --> 02:17:53.420]  Let's put them in drug rehab centers to help people instead of locking them up and destroying their future.
[02:17:53.420 --> 02:17:57.420]  Let's give them some training and get them a future.
[02:17:57.420 --> 02:18:05.420]  You tell that to the narcotics officers that 50 to 75% of the money they seize is not going back into their pockets
[02:18:05.420 --> 02:18:10.420]  and not allowing them to drive fancy cars that they seize, they'll stop doing that type of work.
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:19.420]  And that's why they don't go after the big boys, talk to your local, you know, so-called drug dealers here in Austin
[02:18:19.420 --> 02:18:24.420]  and find out how many of them can go down to cocaine and fly up a plane of drugs.
[02:18:24.420 --> 02:18:28.420]  How many of them can go to the Middle East and bring back heroin? None of them.
[02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:32.420]  They can't go into Mexico and bring back boatloads of pot.
[02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:35.420]  They're not the ones that are bringing the drugs into this country.
[02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:39.420]  It's the higher interest like you talk about.
[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:42.420]  And it's so transparent and now all the polls show across the country.
[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:48.420]  America is turning against the drug war, it's over, but the establishment is still trying to push it.
[02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:50.420]  Where do you see all this going?
[02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:59.420]  Well, as a police officer, if I pull over 15 cars for a traffic violation, which I can make one up
[02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:04.420]  or I can just wait, anybody's going to violate a traffic law if you follow them more than a couple of miles.
[02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:10.420]  Be it weaving in your lane or touching the line or failing to signal our defective light,
[02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:16.420]  non-dangerous activity, something that's not going to, like you talk about the reckless driving, non-reckless driving.
[02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:20.420]  So, I pull over 15 cars in a row and on all 15, I tell them,
[02:19:20.420 --> 02:19:22.420]  how to smell marijuana? I want to search your car.
[02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:26.420]  By law, I'm getting in your car if I smelled marijuana.
[02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:30.420]  Well, I search 15 cars and I find one blunt in one car.
[02:19:30.420 --> 02:19:34.420]  Well, I don't write 15 reports. I write one report.
[02:19:34.420 --> 02:19:38.420]  Later on over a year period, you look at my reports, it's like, this Bellagia guy,
[02:19:38.420 --> 02:19:41.420]  he, every time he smells marijuana, he finds something.
[02:19:41.420 --> 02:19:43.420]  He's 100% accurate.
[02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:49.420]  Well, actually, I'm not. I'm well under 10% on, but that's my excuse to search your car.
[02:19:49.420 --> 02:19:53.420]  Jamie Bellagia, stay with us and that's what irritates me because, you know,
[02:19:53.420 --> 02:19:55.420]  I don't have this stuff in my car or whatever and they were wanting to search.
[02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:59.420]  I'm like, hey, this is supposed to be a free country plus the government ships in the hard drugs.
[02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:24.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:55.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:20:55.420 --> 02:21:21.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:21:21.420 --> 02:21:47.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:21:47.420 --> 02:22:13.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:22:13.420 --> 02:22:39.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:22:39.420 --> 02:23:05.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:23:05.420 --> 02:23:29.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:23:29.420 --> 02:23:58.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:23:59.420 --> 02:24:28.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:24:28.420 --> 02:24:50.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:24:50.420 --> 02:25:16.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:25:16.420 --> 02:25:42.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:25:42.420 --> 02:26:08.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:26:08.420 --> 02:26:34.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:26:34.420 --> 02:27:02.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:27:02.420 --> 02:27:28.420]  It's all a fraud.

[02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:38.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:29:38.420 --> 02:30:04.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:30:04.420 --> 02:30:30.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:56.420]  It's all a fraud.

[02:34:28.420 --> 02:34:54.420]  It's all a fraud.
[02:34:54.420 --> 02:35:20.420]  It's all a fraud.
