[00:00.000 --> 00:13.420]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.420 --> 00:22.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.160 --> 00:37.280]  I cannot fail I will not fail I have got to cover all of this news that I've been
[00:37.280 --> 00:42.560]  chomping at the bit last night this morning and today to cover here we've
[00:42.560 --> 00:47.760]  got Syrian girl who by the way with her family was ousted by the Assad regime
[00:47.760 --> 00:52.120]  decades ago that's now on record that she is in Australia she's been on
[00:52.120 --> 00:55.040]  national television over there in debate so we can tell you where she's coming
[00:55.040 --> 01:01.440]  from and she is who she says she is and she a year ago came out and laid out
[01:01.440 --> 01:05.520]  what was really gonna happen 21 months into this our so-called government
[01:05.520 --> 01:12.200]  banker run is launching al-qaeda attacks and there's US aircraft carriers
[01:12.200 --> 01:18.080]  British ships you name it French the Germans have announced that they are
[01:18.080 --> 01:23.520]  massing troops German cabinet decides to send troops to Turkey Syria border it's
[01:23.520 --> 01:31.280]  on folks an incredible Western started proxy war using al-qaeda to destabilize
[01:31.280 --> 01:36.760]  the country and they're getting ready to invade and the US and Russians have
[01:36.760 --> 01:41.040]  been meeting because there are Russian Spitznats on record there fighting US
[01:41.040 --> 01:47.920]  and British and other Arab special forces backed by al-qaeda in proxy
[01:47.920 --> 01:54.360]  battles this is amazing you know 2012 is coming up the end of the world to 21st
[01:54.360 --> 01:58.000]  and I've always said it's pure bull but there's a lot of analysts saying this
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.200]  could spark a nuclear war kind of like south of Saudi abkhazia Georgia situation
[02:03.200 --> 02:09.800]  back in 2008 on 888 so I mean this is crazy and it looks like the Russians
[02:09.800 --> 02:16.560]  may back down and pull out and if that happens Assad is gonna run and it's
[02:16.560 --> 02:18.960]  we're gonna hand the country over to al-qaeda they're gonna kill all the
[02:18.960 --> 02:22.400]  Christians and it will not be on the news or it'll be the back of the paper
[02:22.400 --> 02:26.320]  like oh too bad they're murdering the al-await Muslim minority and the
[02:26.320 --> 02:31.760]  Christians on the Jews that were there for 3,000 years in Damascus they're
[02:31.760 --> 02:36.800]  being killed too and that's what's going on I mean it is so crazy but the
[02:36.800 --> 02:40.560]  general public can't find their state capital doesn't know the three branches
[02:40.560 --> 02:45.800]  of government most high school seniors don't know who the first president was
[02:45.800 --> 02:49.680]  you know they do those national polls every year so when you're dealing with
[02:49.680 --> 02:56.880]  a drooling idiot the government runs al-qaeda to take over the country slaughter
[02:56.880 --> 03:02.640]  people it's so immoral and again Syrian girl her family was run out of there by
[03:02.640 --> 03:11.880]  Assad's daddy she hates him she's a Sunni Assad's are the minority al-awaits
[03:13.560 --> 03:21.720]  oh it's so unbelievable but but I like it to being blind you know if you're
[03:21.720 --> 03:29.080]  visually impaired you can't see something and if you can see you're
[03:29.080 --> 03:32.320]  going look I'm telling you that there's a blue sky right there well I've been
[03:32.320 --> 03:35.240]  blind my whole life I don't know what a blue sky looks like describe it to me
[03:35.240 --> 03:38.640]  Alex and it's the same thing with the general public except I'm going hey
[03:38.640 --> 03:42.360]  this is going on here it's all admitted oh conspiracy theory because thinking and
[03:42.360 --> 03:46.840]  being involved in being informed that's a conspiracy theory in fact now a lot of
[03:46.840 --> 03:50.800]  people think it's weird to be able to talk proficiently and have a big
[03:50.800 --> 03:56.360]  vocabulary they think you're showing off when you use varied semantical
[03:56.360 --> 04:06.680]  combinations to try to describe the true tenor and palette of a development they
[04:06.680 --> 04:11.560]  think that's showing off it understand that the reality is so multifaceted
[04:11.560 --> 04:20.080]  multivariate that even the greatest verbal prose cannot describe the
[04:20.080 --> 04:30.560]  incredible five-cent three-dimensional interface that takes us to the heights
[04:30.560 --> 04:36.320]  of wisdom now I said I must cover it all that's coming up at the bottom of the

[08:54.920 --> 09:00.240]  of three million people or more I am blessed to be here and honored okay
[09:00.240 --> 09:05.600]  Lord Monkton from the big UN conference thrown out got the internal documents
[09:05.600 --> 09:12.240]  as usual you cannot hype up how big it was three years ago when he got the
[09:12.240 --> 09:15.400]  Copenhagen document which was confirmed a week later to be accurate and
[09:15.400 --> 09:21.120]  destroyed the global convention that was going to set up the carbon tax it was
[09:21.120 --> 09:29.160]  a Star Wars episode for Death Star destruction event and I actually went
[09:29.160 --> 09:32.360]  ahead and get champagne and popped it on air when all that happened people are
[09:32.360 --> 09:35.760]  like why are you getting so excited I said watch and that was the turning of
[09:35.760 --> 09:39.640]  the tide we are routing them now but they don't care we're routing them
[09:39.640 --> 09:44.600]  intellectually and in the process worldwide and they now admit that but
[09:44.600 --> 09:47.840]  they don't care they're still in charge they're rolling forward but now it's
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.480]  clearly dictatorial Congress didn't pass the carbon tax they didn't get what
[09:52.480 --> 09:57.600]  they wanted now they're having to do it with executive fiat worldwide so
[09:57.600 --> 10:03.560]  Monkton's got more incredibly important data he'll be breaking with us coming up
[10:03.560 --> 10:11.120]  joining us from the global UN conference that is in the second hour
[10:11.120 --> 10:19.600]  today amazing information coming up with Lord Monkton a former Thatcher
[10:19.600 --> 10:23.000]  advisor Lord Monkton a victim from UN climate summit after challenging global
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.640]  warming escorted from the hall and security officers stripped him of his
[10:26.640 --> 10:34.440]  UN credentials and this is he is again at the UN conference in Qatar we are
[10:34.440 --> 10:39.000]  going to be breaking that down UN summit transforming your kids into climate
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.520]  change agents how they're going to try to push the new carbon tax program he's
[10:44.520 --> 10:48.960]  been ferreting out those documents they literally I've seen video of it they've
[10:48.960 --> 10:55.640]  had police assault him from behind before they just absolutely hate his guts
[10:55.640 --> 11:03.720]  he wouldn't let him into the one in South Africa so he parachuted in
[11:03.720 --> 11:09.560]  German South Africa what six months ago so I mean it's just unbelievable he's
[11:09.560 --> 11:14.240]  going to be joining us coming up and we've got Syrian girl hey she's coming up
[11:14.240 --> 11:19.440]  at the bottom of the hour report NATO military intervention in Syria imminent
[11:19.440 --> 11:23.440]  it looks like Russia's starting to blink special forces mass and preparation
[11:23.440 --> 11:30.560]  for final assault German cabinet decides to send troops to Turkey Syria border and
[11:30.560 --> 11:33.680]  I guess the German the Germans were allies with the Turks back in World
[11:33.680 --> 11:40.280]  War one so it is on it is on and looks like Assad may flee because they are
[11:40.280 --> 11:46.000]  preparing after 21 months for the physical invasion to install al-Qaeda in
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.040]  control of Syria and slaughter all Christians all minority Muslims and
[11:50.040 --> 11:55.600]  Jews and it's ongoing just cutting their heads off throwing them off roofs tens of
[11:55.600 --> 11:58.320]  thousands of missiles given to al-Qaeda they swear to use them against the
[11:58.320 --> 12:01.360]  United States and of course the globalists love that because they'll
[12:01.360 --> 12:04.600]  take all of our rights when they shoot down the aircraft and currently unless
[12:04.600 --> 12:08.280]  we expose this I am predicting that there's a very good chance they're
[12:08.280 --> 12:11.640]  going to start shooting down European and US aircraft and the media the
[12:11.640 --> 12:17.440]  the the prostitute media will not even point out when this happens so that hey
[12:17.440 --> 12:22.440]  wait a minute our government gave them the missiles that's why they killed the
[12:22.440 --> 12:26.680]  ambassador they just had a big cash they gave to the Turks Turkish ambassador
[12:26.680 --> 12:31.240]  left and they go alright send an al-Qaeda wipe out those special forces and the
[12:31.240 --> 12:33.880]  ambassador that just transferred the missiles no they're just getting rid
[12:33.880 --> 12:38.200]  of him and of course the troops you know the al-Qaeda they send al-Qaeda and
[12:38.200 --> 12:41.280]  just under orders to kill them that was the al-Qaeda they send in was the head
[12:41.280 --> 12:45.880]  of security in Benghazi it's all on record they just got rid of the you know
[12:45.880 --> 12:51.760]  the bag men what you do tell you handle it so NATO
[12:51.760 --> 12:56.720]  edging towards Syria intervention Russia says that is out right now I'm being
[12:56.720 --> 13:00.840]  reported by Al Jazeera and others so it's on edging towards intervention like
[13:00.840 --> 13:05.200]  oh it's been going on it's too sad yes Assad I think I heard him on Fox News
[13:05.200 --> 13:09.200]  radio this morning going well the activists say Assad's attacking them
[13:09.200 --> 13:14.600]  again implying they're not like al-Qaeda with rocket launchers backed up by US
[13:14.600 --> 13:20.200]  special forces just blowing up airports attacking airports blowing up
[13:20.200 --> 13:25.920]  infrastructure TV stations power plants shutting down their cell phone systems
[13:25.920 --> 13:31.920]  and saying Assad's doing it I mean it is house-to-house absolute war Turkey
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.920]  firing in with their huge howitzers across the border opening up al-Qaeda
[13:36.920 --> 13:46.000]  injection ports Russia says NATO a patriot move is step in involvement in
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.720]  Syria moving Patriot missiles in yeah it's it's all crazy and saying we've
[13:49.720 --> 13:55.000]  got to attack or they've got chemical weapons that's coming up I'm surprised
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  on him calling palgo show some people some anthrax and say look at these
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.440]  mobile trucks we found for making anthrax they could go to James weapons
[14:01.440 --> 14:06.280]  quarterly and they knew it was 1970s because the US paid for it British
[14:06.280 --> 14:12.480]  hydrogen balloon trucks to put hydrogen balloons up with with video cameras on
[14:12.480 --> 14:17.440]  them so I'm also about US systems for the Iran-Iraq war you send them up to 10
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.800]  thousand feet on a cable with video cameras and then that directs artillery
[14:22.800 --> 14:30.000]  in the Iran-Iraq war they sold it to them it's hydrogen trucks balloon trucks
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.720]  they use them on the border here and they told you it was an anthrax machine
[14:34.720 --> 14:39.160]  yeah day one we went and looked at it went and looked in James weapons
[14:39.160 --> 14:44.520]  quarterly anybody can do it and guess what there they were by the way we were
[14:44.520 --> 14:49.400]  some of the first to break that it broke kind of simultaneously okay wow let me
[14:49.400 --> 14:52.800]  just run through the headlines here that I will cover in detail in the third
[14:52.800 --> 14:58.880]  hour let's just start here of all the things cat parasite toxoplasma uses
[14:58.880 --> 15:03.320]  Trojan horse to infect human brain and may cause suicidal thoughts and risk
[15:03.320 --> 15:06.360]  taking they've known this for thousands of years that's where the old that's
[15:06.360 --> 15:09.880]  London independent that's the media is always reporting something that's
[15:09.880 --> 15:14.000]  actually well known like we discovered the Atlantic Ocean is salty but that was
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.200]  the old thing of witches having cats and cats being unlucky was because you
[15:20.200 --> 15:23.280]  would get the parasite which was rampant at that time because they didn't have
[15:23.280 --> 15:27.360]  you know veterinary clinics but then they killed all the cats seeing them as
[15:27.360 --> 15:31.600]  bad luck and then the rats went crazy with the fleas with a bubonic plague and
[15:31.600 --> 15:36.520]  well you know what happened the rest is history so I'm not saying cats or I'm
[15:36.520 --> 15:40.560]  not saying I believe in the wives tell the point is cats are cute cats are nice
[15:40.560 --> 15:44.720]  I don't like them because they carry the parasite and I've always known that I
[15:44.720 --> 15:49.600]  mean it's well known folks that a lot of the depression and mental illness and
[15:49.600 --> 15:53.760]  the massive skyrocketing of schizophrenia in this country is heavy metal
[15:53.760 --> 15:58.720]  toxification no mad as a hatter people that worked in the clothiers back in
[15:58.720 --> 16:02.440]  England staining things with different colors full of lead and mercury and stuff
[16:02.440 --> 16:08.200]  mad as a hatter schizophrenia massive birth defects they would just say oh
[16:08.200 --> 16:12.720]  you're mentally ill you have bad gene pool no you're toxic but the other big
[16:12.720 --> 16:17.040]  one in the studies and there's a new study out now just came out yesterday is
[16:17.040 --> 16:25.680]  this little parasite amoeba type thing in your brain that knows how to program
[16:25.680 --> 16:29.640]  your brain okay so a little microorganism can do that you by the way you know
[16:29.640 --> 16:33.000]  they're the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is studying this and a bunch
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.960]  of others you know why because they can use it as another trojan once it takes
[16:35.960 --> 16:41.800]  over and then they can have a program on the trojan this is called nanotech and
[16:41.800 --> 16:45.840]  this is the new wave the new vaccines where you're never upset again never
[16:45.840 --> 16:49.240]  want to drink again never want to smoke cigarettes again never want to use drugs
[16:49.240 --> 16:53.360]  again because it goes in and reprograms your brain oh oh yeah they've had that
[16:53.360 --> 16:56.040]  for about 15 years by the way there's clear evidence it's already being used
[16:56.040 --> 17:00.400]  on the population go get your flu shot one of our people becoming total zombies
[17:00.400 --> 17:04.720]  because folks it's you know yeah well we actually had top scientist on who found
[17:04.720 --> 17:07.840]  that a year before the flu outbreak three years ago that they hyped so much the
[17:07.840 --> 17:11.920]  H1N1 that they were putting out carrier tracker viruses that didn't give you the
[17:11.920 --> 17:16.720]  flu but changed brain chemistry folks we're being hit right now we're entering
[17:16.720 --> 17:21.640]  total fantasy land okay I mean I mean this is Buck Rogers okay I mean but
[17:21.640 --> 17:25.680]  it's crazy hundreds of thousands of genetically modified mosquitoes said to
[17:25.680 --> 17:29.800]  be released in Florida Keys and an experiment to fight denig fever and I
[17:29.800 --> 17:33.160]  had the head of a company on a few months ago about this and they admit
[17:33.160 --> 17:37.920]  guess what you know mosquitoes Bill Gates who talked about this are perfect
[17:37.920 --> 17:42.920]  to force you to take vaccines they've said so you can't escape it because the
[17:42.920 --> 17:45.560]  mosquito you know a mosquito gets your blood right they don't just slurp up
[17:45.560 --> 17:51.040]  your blood but the platelets that clog their proboscis they inject their saliva
[17:51.040 --> 17:58.240]  a powerful acid to liquefy the cells before slurping that's why mosquitoes
[17:58.240 --> 18:02.000]  are perfect to carry bio weapons but this that's not what this company's doing
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.720]  they say they say they just want to you know have these mosquitoes breed out the
[18:05.720 --> 18:10.480]  other mosquitoes but they're there you have it's on I mentioned that for him
[18:10.480 --> 18:15.160]  Costa Rica now battling Monsanto over GMO corn trying to force that into the

[18:18.720 --> 18:22.720]  doses of meats for human consumption natural news is reporting and because
[18:22.720 --> 18:26.240]  the radiation levels going up from Fukushima here and then the winds blow
[18:26.240 --> 18:30.360]  right into the US from Japan that's why they fire bomb us with those balloons
[18:30.360 --> 18:34.360]  hundreds of them that they'd send over with explosives timed in the trade when
[18:34.360 --> 18:39.080]  to drop in the Midwest and blow up I haven't fired apartments just where on
[18:39.080 --> 18:42.200]  they look out for him with spotters and we're able to deal with the problem

[24:42.520 --> 24:47.000]  crime syndicates the groups that publicly run the giant money laundering
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.600]  operations hundreds of billions a year Wells Fargo gets caught nobody gets in
[24:50.600 --> 24:55.440]  trouble continues it along with Wacovia they're the people that create the
[24:55.440 --> 25:00.200]  derivatives and have the government sign on to it so they want us up at 80%
[25:00.200 --> 25:05.320]  taxes like France they said that's the model they're all exempt offshore they
[25:05.320 --> 25:09.520]  don't pay taxes are almost no taxes and that's all on record even they get
[25:09.520 --> 25:14.760]  government bailouts they don't pay taxes you pay taxes just like Howard Dean said
[25:14.760 --> 25:21.120]  we've got that clip coming up that oh not just not just the rich people
[25:21.120 --> 25:26.600]  everybody needs to pay more taxes and I told you this would happen you see they
[25:26.600 --> 25:30.760]  have the Republicans come out and go we're only for 990 billion in new taxes
[25:30.760 --> 25:38.240]  not 1.6 billion Obama a year and you know we're only for retroactive for this
[25:38.240 --> 25:44.400]  tax back one year not three oh they're talking about that and there's not
[25:44.400 --> 25:47.560]  getting rid of the deduction on your mortgage I mean there that that's
[25:47.560 --> 25:54.280]  another 600 billion and it's all the Washington Post on Monday Republicans
[25:54.280 --> 25:58.680]  make their fiscal cliff counteroffer which if a Democrat was calling for it
[25:58.680 --> 26:02.800]  you know Republicans would go chop off a cliff now now that's quote the loyal
[26:02.800 --> 26:07.800]  opposition that Obama basically calls for triple that and dozens of new taxes
[26:07.800 --> 26:13.080]  on top of the 3.8 healthcare tax on all major investments I mean it goes on and
[26:13.080 --> 26:20.160]  on and the general moron public especially Obama supporters folks as soon
[26:20.160 --> 26:23.280]  as Obamacare goes in they're gonna say that the unemployment problem has been
[26:23.280 --> 26:27.080]  fixed because they're gonna count people that get cut to 20 hours a week part
[26:27.080 --> 26:30.600]  time so they don't have to employers enough to pay for the Obamacare little
[26:30.600 --> 26:36.960]  bankrupt them they'll just count people getting two or three jobs as new
[26:36.960 --> 26:44.800]  people getting total jobs and it's just incredible what this is gonna do to the
[26:44.800 --> 26:49.840]  poorest Americans and they're so dumbed down that that they actually think
[26:49.840 --> 26:54.360]  Obama works for them and wanted to give them some rich guys money the rich guys
[26:54.360 --> 26:59.440]  run Obama you idiots that's why they're rich they're inside scammers and they
[26:59.440 --> 27:03.240]  want to shut down productive middle-class that actually hire people and
[27:03.240 --> 27:06.240]  actually go to nice restaurants and actually get their hair done and actually

[27:37.320 --> 27:42.880]  ahead and have an orderly surrender he's hoping to lead his fractured GOP to an
[27:42.880 --> 27:49.640]  orderly surrender and they may go ahead and vote to just give Obama give Obama
[27:49.640 --> 27:54.080]  control over the power of the purse on the debt limit and the dictatorship is
[27:54.080 --> 28:03.920]  pretty much complete I mean wow wow because the bankers want that folks the

[35:02.800 --> 35:06.560]  there but maybe watching from a hilltop okay so I'll run up and say hi to folks
[35:06.560 --> 35:09.400]  but I'm not gonna be the center of attention I really want to just get my
[35:09.400 --> 35:15.640]  reporters out there doing events so yes I will I will make an appearance
[35:15.640 --> 35:20.520]  sometime during me you know 11 to 1 or so when it's going on out there and again
[35:20.520 --> 35:25.360]  this is about you coming out with your drone your drone mob to protest the
[35:25.360 --> 35:29.960]  drones it is a drone protest and I know a lot of media is gonna be out there local
[35:29.960 --> 35:35.160]  TV and stuff and so bring your aircraft you know you name it helicopters
[35:35.160 --> 35:40.240]  professional drones you name it as long as they don't fly above 400 feet if the
[35:40.240 --> 35:44.200]  cops try to say you can't fly RC aircraft out there that's not true and
[35:44.200 --> 35:47.600]  that's what all these new drones are the switch blades the rest of it is just
[35:47.600 --> 35:51.880]  small drones and below 400 feet there's no regulations the police go out there
[35:51.880 --> 35:55.000]  and do it people do it all the time so it'll be a whole another media issue if
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.360]  they try to say something it'll be outside of law as usual so come on out
[36:00.360 --> 36:05.400]  and be part of it kicks off around 11 a.m. tomorrow and we'll run through about
[36:05.400 --> 36:12.320]  1 p.m. the drone mob tomorrow Zilker Park Austin Texas press release up at
[36:12.320 --> 36:17.080]  info wars.com we'll retweet it at the real Alex Jones on Twitter and the
[36:17.080 --> 36:21.840]  hashtag is Drone Mob and you can also find it over at prison planet on
[36:21.840 --> 36:26.200]  Twitter at prison planet okay there you go look forward to seeing everybody out
[36:26.200 --> 36:32.480]  there speaking of drone news video a black helicopter goes autonomous is that
[36:32.480 --> 36:38.080]  a popular science and now they are going to make the black hawks robot don't
[36:38.080 --> 36:42.080]  need humans anymore and the passengers jets are going to be robot told you
[36:42.080 --> 36:46.480]  that England's now moving to that last week and the cars that now most states
[36:46.480 --> 36:50.040]  are passing laws to allow robot cars and they're already saying as I predict
[36:50.040 --> 36:56.840]  those and how they operate that they are going to say that robot cars are
[36:56.840 --> 37:02.440]  safer and then make robots drive you so the total takeover of our society is
[37:02.440 --> 37:07.320]  here and also we broke this in 2006 because Google put out a press release
[37:07.320 --> 37:13.520]  and it was so incredible it's kind of like earlier this year when the big
[37:13.520 --> 37:17.680]  journal of bioethics the big prestigious one published a report saying
[37:17.680 --> 37:20.440]  killed children up to age three even though they're healthy the state or
[37:20.440 --> 37:22.960]  parents be able to kill children and that's actually what they're moving
[37:22.960 --> 37:26.600]  towards you know the death panels the kids not want to just kill them use them
[37:26.600 --> 37:29.760]  for body parts go ahead and gut them they talk you know there's a lot of money
[37:29.760 --> 37:33.480]  can be made out of got them up to 500 grand on a baby parts a lot of rich
[37:33.480 --> 37:37.160]  people pay to get those parts for their kids so it's it's it's a you know they
[37:37.160 --> 37:40.840]  don't want to just butcher hogs and pigs and stuff and you know cows the
[37:40.840 --> 37:44.600]  chickens I mean you know New World Order wants to render up some humans
[37:44.600 --> 37:50.320]  cloud Atlas go all the way so that's the plan and we are human resources as
[37:50.320 --> 37:55.640]  they call us in our face we're too stupid to know what that means and anyways
[37:55.640 --> 37:59.120]  people didn't believe it for about four days and then people actually went and
[37:59.120 --> 38:02.240]  read the journal and said oh it's real it became national news international
[38:02.240 --> 38:05.800]  news it's kind of like when we got Homeland Security and my reports and
[38:05.800 --> 38:09.440]  gun owners are terrorists we're gonna be you know hunted down and veterans are
[38:09.440 --> 38:12.400]  the number one terrorist and people didn't believe that Ron Paul's office
[38:12.400 --> 38:17.720]  said well we we you know they got called and they said well that can't be five
[38:17.720 --> 38:20.360]  days later though they actually went and found out it was real and the FBI
[38:20.360 --> 38:23.840]  admitted it was real and then the governor you know had to come out and
[38:23.840 --> 38:26.560]  say well actually I support this you know one of the states where they'd
[38:26.560 --> 38:31.720]  issued the federal report there in Missouri so you know when I'm telling you
[38:31.720 --> 38:37.840]  all this you know I'm sorry the truth is a stranger than fiction but this is
[38:37.840 --> 38:45.580]  what's going on and the globalist brag that Bill Joy and 2000 and the April
[38:45.580 --> 38:49.080]  issue of Wired Magazine why the future doesn't need us you know multi-billionaire
[38:49.080 --> 38:52.800]  some microsystems owner founder he said I went to the globalist you know meeting
[38:52.800 --> 38:56.640]  we we said do we let everybody just party and have fun and or do we kill
[38:56.640 --> 39:02.400]  everybody because we don't need you anymore I mean you're you've always
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.520]  been cheap but now now you're a you know we want the world for ourselves and he
[39:07.520 --> 39:10.600]  said you know I kind of think we shouldn't get rid of everybody oh let's
[39:10.600 --> 39:13.960]  try one more time to get Bill Joy on the show I've talked about him so much I
[39:13.960 --> 39:20.560]  guarantee you he'll he at least knows who we are the other founder of it was on
[39:20.560 --> 39:23.760]  PBS one time I saw him he said I look forward everybody having microchips
[39:23.760 --> 39:28.640]  in him so folks this isn't a game okay this isn't a game and the discussion's
[39:28.640 --> 39:32.560]  being made and the decision's been made to go ahead and kill everybody but
[39:32.560 --> 39:36.640]  they've got a poison is slowly to the point of everybody's so drug that they
[39:36.640 --> 39:40.480]  don't notice half the public's got cancer or people can't talk anymore or
[39:40.480 --> 39:44.680]  people can't focus and and then it's just you know the slow the government
[39:44.680 --> 39:49.240]  will find why why this is happening but never does and we all just get used to
[39:49.240 --> 39:53.240]  it we're just slowly being trained and all these movies are coming out about
[39:53.240 --> 39:58.200]  the end of humanity and how beautiful it's gonna be and they've come in told a
[39:58.200 --> 40:01.720]  lot of the elitist you know the Brad Pitt types and Angelina Jolie join us
[40:01.720 --> 40:04.480]  or you're not gonna be part of the club so they're out there and try to help
[40:04.480 --> 40:07.480]  everybody get ready for this and you know I just think it's really really
[40:07.480 --> 40:11.040]  horrible you know but I'm an extremist you know I am actually read the White
[40:11.040 --> 40:14.480]  House science ours you know books he's written all four of them you know weird
[40:14.480 --> 40:18.240]  and do reports on it show you Reese says they're gonna put stuff in the water to
[40:18.240 --> 40:22.640]  sterilize you and that was 35 years ago you know which they've been doing I kind
[40:22.640 --> 40:25.840]  of sets me a little bit sometimes so that's all coming up for the next 20
[40:25.840 --> 40:33.600]  minutes we are joined by Syrian girl and Syrian girl comes from a former ruling
[40:33.600 --> 40:38.480]  class family that was deposed by a bath as coup by Assad's father she's a hundred
[40:38.480 --> 40:42.520]  percent Syrian to the core and a career student also a model from what I've seen
[40:42.520 --> 40:48.480]  and her YouTube channel is youtube.com for slash user Syrian girl partisan so
[40:48.480 --> 40:55.280]  her family was run out of there by Assad's dictator father and she's on
[40:55.280 --> 40:58.400]  national TV now so her identity is confirmed you know in debates about
[40:58.400 --> 41:02.640]  this on Australian television so we could tell you where she's at now and
[41:02.640 --> 41:07.080]  she's been speaking out for close to a year the proxy war using al-Qaeda has
[41:07.080 --> 41:13.360]  been happening for 21 months and now today the Germans have voted to mass
[41:13.360 --> 41:17.560]  troops on the border where u.s. British French and others are there's
[41:17.560 --> 41:21.960]  aircraft carrier mass three amphibious landers French landing ships German
[41:21.960 --> 41:27.560]  landing ships there off the med as well the Russians are now coming to the
[41:27.560 --> 41:30.960]  table because they're in a proxy war with Spitznets with us special forces
[41:30.960 --> 41:34.920]  side-by-side with al-Qaeda they are chopping Christians heads off throwing
[41:34.920 --> 41:38.360]  them off buildings burning up and blowing up churches killing the Jewish
[41:38.360 --> 41:44.440]  minority and killing a minority Alawites which the Assad family's part of
[41:44.440 --> 41:49.640]  and here's Syrian girl who is Sunni but not the al-Qaeda type that's 80% you
[41:49.640 --> 41:52.880]  know the 80% Sunni a small group is al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia they're
[41:52.880 --> 41:58.000]  there CFR McClatchy news covered it yesterday with the headlines that yes
[41:58.000 --> 42:04.280]  al-Qaeda is leading the charge of the attack and now it's coming to a head
[42:04.280 --> 42:07.840]  and next stop is then Iran that's what I'm gonna get rid of Syria first this is
[42:07.840 --> 42:11.720]  an incredible war crime and it also speaks to the fact that the West is in
[42:11.720 --> 42:16.400]  a catatonic brain dead state the general public that our governments are
[42:16.400 --> 42:21.840]  running al-Qaeda in a giant proxy war takedown artillery being fired in
[42:21.840 --> 42:28.160]  continually off and on by Turkey just unbelievable full-out war it's not
[42:28.160 --> 42:31.680]  coming war is now Syrian girl thank you so much for joining us you've got the
[42:31.680 --> 42:35.760]  floor right down the history of this and exactly exactly I mean I mean this is
[42:35.760 --> 42:39.760]  so bad even though you were thrown out by the Assad's you care about your
[42:39.760 --> 42:42.480]  country and it being handed over to al-Qaeda so you're speaking out and
[42:42.480 --> 42:46.040]  everything you've warned us about has now come true you've been proven to be an
[42:46.040 --> 42:50.800]  amazing source tell us what's happening well thanks so much Alex Jones for the
[42:50.800 --> 42:58.840]  intro and having me on well you know my family wasn't so much kicked out but you
[42:58.840 --> 43:04.000]  could definitely say that they were kicked out of government but we're not
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  kicked out of the country though though we left you know because there was
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.880]  problems inside the country no one can say that there wasn't any corruption in
[43:12.880 --> 43:17.120]  the government and you can't say that there wasn't a dictatorship but at the
[43:17.120 --> 43:22.680]  same time you know Syria wasn't it's not as bad as they're trying to make it look
[43:22.680 --> 43:29.760]  like with constant torture of children and all these tsunami of lies as was
[43:29.760 --> 43:33.920]  described by the Foreign Minister against the country and I think it's
[43:33.920 --> 43:41.920]  obvious that NATO powers have been for the last two years now trying in their
[43:41.920 --> 43:48.120]  media and in their vocalization by the government like Clinton and Obama at the
[43:48.120 --> 43:53.360]  UN trying to stir up the tension inside Syria trying to create a civil war
[43:53.360 --> 43:59.160]  divide and conquer and eventually you know they hope to create a Libya scenario
[43:59.160 --> 44:05.120]  where they depose the government there to install an extremist Wahhabist regime
[44:05.120 --> 44:10.720]  the Wahhabis are the this minority sect of crazies that you were talking about
[44:10.720 --> 44:16.120]  that have the same ideology as Al Qaeda and you know as you as we've talked
[44:16.120 --> 44:22.200]  about previously Al Qaeda is something that the US created themselves and
[44:22.200 --> 44:27.760]  something that many believe with mounds of evidence that it's something that
[44:27.760 --> 44:32.400]  they've always controlled and they control now but in Syria and using them
[44:32.400 --> 44:39.800]  as proxy armies basically in Libya and Syria and now even the CFR the LA
[44:39.800 --> 44:42.840]  Times McClatchy newspapers I'm gonna show some of these on screen for TV
[44:42.840 --> 44:48.720]  viewers people can just type McClatchy Al Qaeda in or LA Times Al Qaeda or US you
[44:48.720 --> 44:53.040]  know running Al Qaeda or helping Al Qaeda in Syria they're giving them missiles
[44:53.040 --> 44:58.760]  anti-aircraft missiles thousands of them and Al Qaeda was in the news in
[44:58.760 --> 45:03.160]  McClatchy two days ago saying we're gonna come to America next and blow up
[45:03.160 --> 45:07.800]  your aircraft and and when they blow up our aircraft the government will use
[45:07.800 --> 45:12.040]  this Syrian girl to take my rights because the public is in such a coma I
[45:12.040 --> 45:17.320]  mean it's so obvious they're using Al Qaeda to take over everywhere it's just
[45:17.320 --> 45:21.840]  amazing what is your take on the build-up now and the open talk of physical
[45:21.840 --> 45:25.880]  NATO troops we know are there in proxy like they were in Libya and they're
[45:25.880 --> 45:32.040]  you know advising now actually invading well you know I think with the terrorist
[45:32.040 --> 45:38.040]  groups in Syria it's very funny now see after two years of their terrorist activity
[45:38.040 --> 45:42.880]  the US is now it becomes so obvious that they'd have to come out and say oh wait
[45:42.880 --> 45:46.920]  yeah they are a terrorist group and this is to provide plausible deniability and
[45:46.920 --> 45:51.680]  of course they're going to probably use these groups later to maybe create another
[45:51.680 --> 45:57.840]  9-11 you know potentially the US people would be sick of these wars and they'd
[45:57.840 --> 46:03.480]  have to be shown that they'd be under attack you know again so I think that
[46:03.480 --> 46:09.320]  it's a perpetual cycle and we can see that you know they use the same technique
[46:09.320 --> 46:13.720]  in Afghanistan they're using in Syria now by funding terrorism they're also using
[46:13.720 --> 46:19.600]  the same talking points that they have in Iraq by talking about chemical weapons
[46:19.600 --> 46:24.880]  being used by a big bad dictator you know we heard all that ten years ago so
[46:24.880 --> 46:32.480]  about the buildup against Syria I think at this point that a lot of it is just
[46:32.480 --> 46:37.400]  psychological warfare you know you see in the media stuff about the USS Eisenhower
[46:37.400 --> 46:44.480]  being off the coast but I believe that the USS Eisenhower is actually going to
[46:44.480 --> 46:51.720]  go home early so I still I believe that a lot of what's in the media is trying to
[46:51.720 --> 46:58.760]  build up such a fear and hysteria inside Syria to cause defections and to make
[46:58.760 --> 47:03.640]  people stop fighting but I don't think it's going to work because people see
[47:03.640 --> 47:08.520]  that the army is still fighting and when the army isn't backing down you know the
[47:08.520 --> 47:13.200]  army is still united and strong the people will be too so on the ground in
[47:13.200 --> 47:16.800]  Syria I think that the army is still making gains like they did in Daria
[47:16.800 --> 47:23.120]  recently and they successfully defeated a an attempt to control the Damascus
[47:23.120 --> 47:29.200]  airport so what you see in the media of the US you know building saying as it's
[47:29.200 --> 47:33.840]  about to fall that's not what's actually happening on the ground and maybe this is
[47:33.840 --> 47:38.760]  a dangerous situation for the US because they really need Syria to fall in order
[47:38.760 --> 47:45.440]  for their the globalists to control the whole world basically it's that domino
[47:45.440 --> 47:50.400]  that needs to fall so there's a disconnect between what's happening on
[47:50.400 --> 47:53.840]  the ground in Syria and what you're hearing in the media I don't think we're
[47:53.840 --> 47:58.120]  at the point yet that they're actually going to do a physical attack I think
[47:58.120 --> 48:01.600]  that it's still at this point psychological war so you're saying it's
[48:01.600 --> 48:05.040]  more psychological warfare as they've been doing in the past you were on about
[48:05.040 --> 48:09.360]  six months ago and you you know you said that look they're gonna try to claim
[48:09.360 --> 48:12.980]  that Assad's gonna use his legal lawful which other governments have chemical
[48:12.980 --> 48:17.520]  weapons never invaded never detect anybody never used them and that they
[48:17.520 --> 48:21.480]  and that they would have al-Qaeda maybe launch him at Turkey or somebody and
[48:21.480 --> 48:26.160]  then we've already know they caught US made mortars being fired by al-Qaeda on
[48:26.160 --> 48:32.120]  the border into Turkey so Turkey could then blast out hundreds of square miles
[48:32.120 --> 48:36.080]  of areas with how it serves to insert more troops in now German troops are
[48:36.080 --> 48:42.240]  massing to invade unbelievable and now Obama warned Syria about using chemical
[48:42.240 --> 48:46.800]  weapons threatens consequences and then magically some chemical weapons get used
[48:46.800 --> 48:54.560]  and oh we've got to invade now same WMD garbage over and over again absolutely
[48:54.560 --> 48:59.560]  and they don't even need to launch chemical weapons at Turkey they can just
[48:59.560 --> 49:05.440]  let the insurgents or terrorists inside Syria use the chemical weapons
[49:05.440 --> 49:10.960]  themselves and actually there was a video that came out of supposedly of
[49:10.960 --> 49:16.160]  these FSA terrorists mixing chemicals mixing a gas and killing some rabbits
[49:16.160 --> 49:19.720]  they filmed themselves and they said next it will be the otherwise that are
[49:19.720 --> 49:24.720]  going to be gas like this so the chemicals that they were used were from
[49:24.720 --> 49:28.920]  Turkey and we know that Turkey's been smuggling arms into Syria so it's
[49:28.920 --> 49:34.840]  absolutely there's a potential to for them to just carry out a chemical weapons
[49:34.840 --> 49:39.480]  attack and use that as a pretext for intervention they're looking for a way
[49:39.480 --> 49:46.440]  in always you know they're they're setting up all of the they're setting

[55:27.680 --> 55:32.840]  back to Syrian girl look this is they're only getting away with this because the
[55:32.840 --> 55:37.880]  public doesn't know what planet they're on in the west a total decadence it is
[55:37.880 --> 55:42.800]  but the governing class it shows how really evil they are to go in and
[55:42.800 --> 55:48.400]  engage in religious and ethnic cleansing using al-Qaeda and Saudi
[55:48.400 --> 55:54.240]  Arabian jihadis you know blowing up the churches all of it so where do you see
[55:54.240 --> 55:57.920]  this proxy war going if it's gone to stalemate and what do you make of the
[55:57.920 --> 56:02.840]  patriot missiles being rolled in and the rest of its Syrian girl well I think the
[56:02.840 --> 56:08.320]  patriot missiles was it's a step to create that no-fly zone buffer zone that
[56:08.320 --> 56:14.360]  they keep talking about obviously because their proxy insertion army isn't
[56:14.360 --> 56:19.040]  getting the results that they hope for after two years they need to protect them
[56:19.040 --> 56:26.280]  from air assault the patriot missiles a step to that but on the other hand the
[56:26.280 --> 56:31.160]  more that the u.s. arms their side because it's like a proxy war as you
[56:31.160 --> 56:36.320]  say Russia's going to arm the other side and this is unverified reports but in
[56:36.320 --> 56:41.880]  Lebanese media the magazine made in reported that Russia's has given Syria
[56:41.880 --> 56:47.040]  a scanner missiles in response to the patriot missiles so again it's like
[56:47.040 --> 56:52.280]  steps towards a third world war I know that in media Russia you can't really
[56:52.280 --> 56:58.280]  read which way it's going but I think that it's very plausible that Syria now
[56:58.280 --> 57:03.800]  has a scanner missiles in its words because where else for the reports come
[57:03.800 --> 57:10.400]  from I think that it's very dangerous situation for the world to be in for
[57:10.400 --> 57:15.120]  everybody who's concerned because Syria isn't Libya as people say Syria does
[57:15.120 --> 57:21.640]  have the potential to really cause damage to its enemies and I think in some
[57:21.640 --> 57:26.920]  ways you know NATO and the powers that we know that and they're afraid of that
[57:26.920 --> 57:32.440]  how long can from your well research of you and talking to your family who's
[57:32.440 --> 57:36.600]  been in government there how long can Syria hold out against the Al Qaeda
[57:36.600 --> 57:43.520]  brigades and US special forces well if things stays they are now it can hold
[57:43.520 --> 57:50.120]  out maybe indefinitely you know and that's also sad to say because the
[57:50.120 --> 57:55.040]  destruction of Syria is going to be ongoing and but at the end if things are
[57:55.040 --> 57:59.480]  as they are now Syria will emerge victorious that's why they need to
[57:59.480 --> 58:04.800]  change the rules of the game that's why they need to inject a no-fly zone and
[58:04.800 --> 58:10.160]  talk about maybe troops being in or launching some kind of offensive on
[58:10.160 --> 58:15.360]  Syria because as it is now they're losing well by the way that I agree and
[58:15.360 --> 58:20.080]  when you get even mainstream news going why are we backing Al Qaeda you have a
[58:20.080 --> 58:23.880]  America would just wake up and be moral in Europe shame on the French they're
[58:23.880 --> 58:29.160]  the ones leading this I mean just absolutely disgusting and I'm no fan of
[58:29.160 --> 58:35.000]  Assad I mean you know they kicked your family out of government I mean I the
[58:35.000 --> 58:39.160]  point is is that it's so evil to be doing this and to give Al Qaeda those
[58:39.160 --> 58:41.560]  missiles
[58:41.560 --> 58:49.960]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[59:05.080 --> 59:08.920]  economic results of the presidential election this perfect storm is a huge

[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.680]  this country is just getting crazy they're taking Christmas trees crosses
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:38.240]  down everywhere our government runs al-Qaeda they're gonna launch giant new
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.760]  taxes on everybody to pay the foreign banks Syrian girl they got five minutes
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:45.880]  left before Lord Monckton comes on I know you are really an expert on all
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.480]  this where where do you see it all going and what are other points you'd like to
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:55.280]  relate to people well I want to relate to people you know I think in the US
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:01.080]  media all they hear about is government atrocities in Syria and I want to say
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.600]  you know straight up when you create a civil war in a country of course there's
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.280]  gonna be some casualties create caused by both sides you have the army and these
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.800]  ever say and they're both heavily armed and of course this is absolutely true
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:20.680]  but the media the mainstream media is not pointing to the atrocities that are
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:26.520]  being committed by these FSA terrorists and because it shows that these people
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:31.480]  are no alternative they're not democratic at all I mean for example they
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.360]  got together all the groups and declared openly that they don't want a
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.760]  democracy they want to impose sharia law on Syria and even though sharia is a
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:46.760]  sharia is a Muslim country that doesn't necessarily mean that they all want to be
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:52.960]  forced to live under someone's some else's version of Islam so in Idlib where
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.560]  the FSA are all concentrated right now is it's one of the outskirts suburbs of
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.720]  Aleppo they've actually opened up morality courts already and they're
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:07.480]  already you know sort of pushing people around and telling them how they should
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.280]  worship their God basically and to get into the atrocities also this week
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:18.280]  recently they there's been video that's come out of them executing unarmed
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:24.520]  prisoners and you know this is supposed to be the new democratic free Syria that
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:28.160]  they're pushing on Syria and you better believe when the Syrian army gets
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.440]  captured and they get killed they're gonna fight really hard too and I hear it
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.480]  anytime they fight back it's called atrocities and there's never a
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.960]  discussion of al-Qaeda going in on record and telling fathers we're gonna
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.240]  kill your family if you don't go suicide bomb I mean that's on record this is so
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:48.680]  evil well there's been so many car bombings in the masques in them in the
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.320]  in the area that don't see any fighting you see all these car bombings happening
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:59.240]  and I think that also you know these FSA people they they're pushing people out
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:04.440]  of their homes and their birth they actually have been burning stores because
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.880]  they don't want to see stores open they want to see people striking and
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:12.680]  shutting the basically shutting the country down my family back home told me
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.560]  that they only get now they get six hours electricity switch stuff because they
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:23.600]  attack the power stations also you know they lost mortars that peaceful areas and
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:29.200]  recently killed nine students and a teacher because of the mortars so also
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.840]  when they burn but the people you know there's they're still very resilient when
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:37.080]  they've burnt all these stores they've gone into the areas that are controlled
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.000]  by the army and set up the stores again in a makeshift way and you can see
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:48.800]  videos of that on a website called Syrian use CC they it's just very courageous
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.920]  and heartwarming to see people you know still going strong in the economy still
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.640]  going that's what I was gonna ask you what about the Syrians themselves from
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.480]  when I've been reading in the foreign news they're really even people that
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.520]  didn't like a saw that are starting to rally around them because they
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.800]  understand how their whole country's about to be handed over to al-Qaeda
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:12.800]  absolutely al-Qaeda and the globalists so Syrian people putting aside what you
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.120]  believe of your government when your country is directly under attack and
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.320]  your families are threatened you have to rely on your army to defend you and
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.800]  Syrian people you know no matter what they think of their government they're
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.280]  gonna support the soldiers that are not going out and attacking other nations
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.880]  but they're defending the home now yeah the Syrians are fighting hard against
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:38.480]  special forces of at least 10 nations backing al-Qaeda brigades it is
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.640]  unbelievable and our troops are standing by the CIA is there advising them
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.720]  burning churches no one's ever kicked the Christian church in 2,000 years out
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:52.680]  of Syria but the US government is under neural water control pure evil Syrian

[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:39.520]  christopher montan who is out of all the great people out there fighting the
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:43.600]  globalist collectivist using the environmental movement to take control
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.680]  of the industrial world and destroy it so they can consolidate power he is at
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:51.920]  the tip of the spear it was three years ago with the Copenhagen event that he
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:55.880]  was able to get the secret document that they planted double the taxes on the
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.360]  third world or right at double what they'd be on the west and then it was a
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:03.040]  total collectivist takeover to give 100 trillion basically as london guardian
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:07.800]  reported also the london telegraph reported 100 trillion in global taxes
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.520]  over the next decade now congress then shot down obama's carbon taxes he's
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.680]  still going ahead by executive fiat but that makes them lose the moral high
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:22.920]  ground and here's a climate depot dot com report on this thatcher advisor lord
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:26.920]  montan evicted from un climate summit at the challenging global warming
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:31.600]  escorted from the hall and security officer stripped him of his un
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:36.000]  credentials long turn to the UN the 16 years we have been coming to these
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.800]  conferences there has been no global warming calls to deport montan from
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:46.680]  UN conference in Qatar and he always the reason they hate him is there's good
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:52.080]  people in all major governments and they know that massive carbon taxes on
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:57.840]  african latin-american asian european russian chinese governments are are
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.240]  designed to be selectively enforced and and just shut down society it's a
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.560]  eugenics based weapons system and montan's an expert on that can break it
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:10.840]  down as website science public policy dot org and so he always gets the
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:14.400]  documents and i know he's gotten some information now that he's gonna be able
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:18.480]  to reveal to us as well but first he's been assaulted on video from behind for
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:24.080]  no reason by a police officer he's been thrown out in durban south africa he had
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.440]  to parachute in and people on radio think i'm joking about that as you go
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:34.560]  find just lord montan parachutes and the climate summit but you don't play some
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:39.000]  that if you're watching us at info wars news calm but the point is is also new
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.040]  american that william f. jasper's reporting on it a UN summit transforming
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.040]  your kids in a quote climate change agents as al gore has called for previously
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:53.080]  so they're there calling for all this right now also calling to restrict your
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:57.720]  internet just the UN is an incredibly authoritarian organization even the
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:01.880]  new york times admits they send in UN troops to kill people in africa and
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:06.200]  latin america to get them off their land to give it to major corporations it's
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:12.560]  just a but oh movie stars say it's loving you know if angeline joe lee says
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:17.000]  the UN's good why it must be she cares about us she's not a snake-eyed demon or

[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.600]  we're showing him skydiving into the conference a few months ago lord
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.960]  montan is a knowledge of science and politics behind global warming is noted
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:53.840]  for its breadth and depth and he has traveled and lectured and continents
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:59.040]  worldwide and he joins us now or montan via skype joining us thank you sir for
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.560]  coming on you've got the floor until we go to break please give us a report on
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:08.760]  what the criminal authoritarians are up to right now well first of all alex i
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:14.680]  have to put my own hand up here because what i did was a little naughty i was
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.760]  sitting in a very comfortable seat where normally the delegation from burma
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:23.840]  would sit and i just happen to have got to the meeting half an hour early because
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.600]  i wanted to to go through some of the documents that were coming out from the
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.960]  un at that stage of the of the conference and then gradually the room
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.920]  filled up around me and the delegation from burma didn't appear and so at the
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.640]  very last moment really just very much on the spur of the moment i decided to
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.920]  signify to the chair that i would quite like to say something and was
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:52.200]  acknowledged so i said three things i said one very respectfully very polite i
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:57.960]  said one there's been no global warming for 16 years two even if there had been
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:04.280]  it would be a great deal cheaper to do nothing about it now spend nothing now
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:10.720]  and adapt in a focused way later if and when any consequences of warming that
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.840]  might be adverse actually appeared and three that perhaps we now need an
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:21.680]  independent scientific review of what the these conferences were doing to make
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.440]  sure we were still headed in the right direction and that was all i said and it
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.480]  took me no longer than that to say it it was 45 seconds in the official record
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:38.600]  and then i got up to go and was immediately approached by a un policeman
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:43.160]  there are hundreds of them always at these conferences toting trunctions and
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.920]  mobile phones and other bits of kid and he said you stay there and then
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.520]  eventually another policeman came and they said come with us and we went
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:57.600]  outside into the balmy night and there an enormous gathering of various un
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:03.320]  officials appeared murmuring into their telephones and eventually a very tall
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.520]  character in a suit who i think was the un head of security said that i would be
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:14.080]  escorted off the premises and out i went into the night so it's a
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.960]  storm in a tea cup frankly and i did i've got to admit alex behave just a
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:24.120]  little bit improperly but on the other hand the three things i said in that
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:30.040]  45 seconds when i had the floor would not have been heard by any of the
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:34.520]  delegates otherwise and all three of them are sensible points there hasn't
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:40.200]  been any global warming for 16 years on any measure and the attempts to deny
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:44.120]  this on the part of the conference and several previous conferences really are
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:48.680]  becoming a painfully embarrassing likewise it is now becoming apparent
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:53.640]  that it really is many times more expensive to try to stop global warming
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:58.240]  than simply to let it happen and adapt to it as the human race is very good at
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.360]  doing and certainly now there is a case given this long period without warming
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.120]  and that we now begin to know more about the huge cost of trying to get
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:12.200]  relatively small changes in the amount of CO2 that's admitted to the atmosphere
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:17.440]  it is time that there was a proper independent scientific review not done
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.800]  by the UN's climate panel but by a completely different group all right
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:25.760]  let me just interject interject here Lord Monckton a question because this is
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:30.000]  important obviously look we know it's all a fraud in the 60s and 70s they said
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.440]  it was gonna be global cooling by 2000 we didn't give them all our money and
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.720]  they're always you know scripting it where they're the planet savior and you
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:41.880]  kill yourself basically or be their slave and worship them for it and then
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:47.560]  they'll take good care of you they know it's all a fraud what is the new evil
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:51.760]  coming out of this conference because Obama says he's gonna try to ram through
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:56.320]  carbon taxes without Congress I know that's happening
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.840]  far with that frankly because unless Congress votes for carbon taxes that is
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:05.440]  something that the EPA really can't get away with on its own if it tried it
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.320]  really would risk what I think it's beginning to risk anyway which is
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.600]  outright abolition the next time Republicans take the presidency you know
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:19.120]  it has become a monster now and the best thing for the environment apart from
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:23.520]  anything else would be a certain if a freedom would be to sweep it away all
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:30.560]  together abolish it and reallocate the enormous sure so what are they up to
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:33.640]  there you're there you always have breaking angelities what's the new
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:40.120]  first thing is they have agreed to carry on with the Kyoto protocol which
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:44.520]  actually expires on December the 31st and they're going to enter into what is
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:49.840]  called a second commitment period where various nations make promises about how
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:54.680]  much they will cut co2 emissions promises that they will not in fact keep
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:17:01.400]  on the longer term cooperative action as is the cold word for gradual introduction
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:06.080]  of if you like worldwide slavery and over taxation to line the UN's pockets
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.360]  there is less agreement and they're still wrestling with that but the Kyoto
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:14.120]  protocol they've managed to kind of revive the corpse a little bit it's a
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.760]  bit of a zombie but they have done that so there is still going to be more
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:24.800]  spending on this but what is notable is that the tone of desperation is now
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:30.120]  growing I mean they do now know if only because I told them that there's been no
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:34.480]  global warming for 16 years and some of them the brighter ones will go back and
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:39.240]  check that with their scientists and their scientists like ours will try to
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:43.960]  lie about it but in the end the truth is there hasn't been any global warming for
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:49.240]  16 years and that's a long time given the enormous extra amounts of co2 that
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.200]  are going into the atmosphere the other breaking news is that China is now
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:58.600]  growing its co2 emissions so fast that at the current rates of growth you could
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:04.120]  close the West down altogether and the pre-existing rates of annual increase in
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:08.360]  the co2 content of the atmosphere would simply continue the West is now
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:13.920]  actually irrelevant to all this even if there were a scientific problem because
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:19.200]  of China India Indonesia Russia South Africa Brazil and other developing
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:24.080]  countries all of whom are rapidly increasing their consumption of fossil
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.480]  fuels in order to make their people prosperous by giving them fossil fuel
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:32.080]  electricity the cheapest way to make them prosperous and therefore the
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:36.680]  cheapest way to make sure that eventually those populations stabilize
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:41.560]  and that actually is a great benefit to the environment provided we let these
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:46.880]  poorer countries grow and so far there is nothing no suggestion in these
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:51.760]  conferences that the developing countries should be stopped from growing
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:56.480]  but you've only got to start doing the numbers to realize that China several
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.840]  years ago now overtook the United States as the world's biggest emitter it now
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:06.520]  is coming very close to emitting about a third of all the co2 in the world and
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:10.240]  this is growing and growing all the time India is beginning to grow of course
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:14.640]  Indonesia as well Brazil likewise these are huge countries with enormous
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:18.120]  populations and between them they account for getting out of half the
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:22.280]  world's population and if they are not in any way bound to reduce their

[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:31.760]  really doesn't matter what we do so insanity is piled upon insanity piled

[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:12.320]  Lord Monkson joins us here on the broadcast talk about what the UN's doing
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:16.360]  getting better folks have to understand that yes politically they even admit it
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:22.240]  now since the climate gate stuff came out since the planned to shut down the
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.880]  third world came out the death sentence that politically people are turning
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.400]  against them but they're in charge they don't care so how do we deal with this
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:33.960]  paradox Lord Marks I want to get more into what's happening at that conference
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:37.440]  I'm reading there's calls to deport you out of the country now I want to find out
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:43.520]  first there's any truth to that but how do we deal with these authoritarians
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:48.760]  because you rightfully say the tide is turned against them decidedly but they
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:54.440]  don't care so so so how do you deal with that paradox what you do is you do what
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:25:00.600]  I did you go to them and you tell them the truth and if okay I spoke out of
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:05.600]  turn at a meeting where observers weren't supposed to speak well tough luck
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:10.440]  there was no other way that anyone there would listen to what I said and they
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:15.680]  did listen because once I got my third point out I spoke for 45 seconds that's
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:20.640]  what all this is about and at the end of that 45 seconds they were screaming and
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:26.000]  howling with rage and the UN interestingly in editing the tape before
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.080]  allowing it to go out has cut out all the howling and screaming and hooting it
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:35.600]  doesn't want anyone to realize that this is essentially a bear garden where
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:41.320]  everybody has been schooled so to only believe the same thing and if somebody
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:45.680]  like me does get in and tell them the truth they really really don't like it
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:50.720]  so that the simple thing Alex is to do what you do and do what I do to get out
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:56.360]  there and just go on telling the truth until everybody realizes it is the
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:02.320]  truth and their difficulty now is that our predictions yours and mine that
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:06.400]  global warming really wasn't going to be all it was cracked up to be are coming
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:11.160]  true 16 years without global warming that was the message that I put all
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.920]  around the conference over and over again and finally in this plenary
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:19.920]  session where they were all there I told them exactly what the situation was no
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:24.080]  global warming for 16 years that's basically the end of the scare in any
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:29.920]  rational organization there would be no more of this talk of carbon taxes or
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:35.720]  cap and trade or regulations or UN taking world power or children as you say
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:41.560]  Alex you must talk about this being schooled to tell on their parents you
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:46.000]  know my parents turned on the light in their bedroom half an hour before they
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.680]  got up that was a waste of electricity and we're going to report them to the
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:53.920]  climate police that's the kind of thing that used to go on in communist Russia
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:58.040]  and they set up websites and Al Gore has gone to kids we played it and said do
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:02.400]  this they are the state is trying to take our children over while while these
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:06.560]  elitists fly around their private jets and stay in five-star resorts the
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:11.240]  stewed with hookers I mean it's just that they are a group of organized crime
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:16.240]  masquerading as earth savers it's such a joke like bank robbers showing up
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:20.360]  saying hands up give us the money out of the till we're saving the earth I mean
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:26.000]  when does the madness end they are government what is really happening here
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.960]  Alex is a very very interesting phenomenon it has been fascinating to
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:35.960]  watch it at closed courses over the last few years and that is that these
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:43.120]  people the the governing elite worldwide are beginning to form a sort of unity
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:47.800]  they're becoming a single organization and the mission of that organization is
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:55.640]  to preserve and enhance their own powers pay perks privileges and pensions at
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:01.200]  the expense of the rest of us and we are merely now their slaves and if you go
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:07.240]  back to feudal England at that time the serfs only had to work three months of
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:12.160]  the year for their masters but now if you pay ordinary rates of taxation in
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:16.440]  America or Britain or most Western countries you're already having to work
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:20.840]  more like five or six months of the year if you're my son you count all the taxes
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:25.840]  it's like eight months of the year that's right and we're more slaves now than
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.000]  we ever would have been under the feudal system this is how far it's gone and
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.800]  now they're saying they want more did you hear the head of the Democratic
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:38.360]  Party Howard Dean come out and say that the poor need to pay more too well
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.680]  that's the things in that that's a very interesting mission after all of them
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:47.200]  teasing Romney for wanting to spare the rich from taxation now the real truth
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:52.480]  comes out which is that you can allow the rich to pay no tax tax at all and it
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.400]  wouldn't make any difference to the country's revenues because there are too
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:01.240]  few rich people to matter what matters the majority of the population your
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:05.840]  average Joe taxpayer that's where the state gets nearly all of its money from
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.520]  and those are the people that have to pay more in order to balance the budget
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:15.760]  after these predators and raiders all of whom gather here at these conferences
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:21.000]  wherever there's a grass skirt they'll be there in order to find new and exotic
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.680]  ways of telling us how we've got and they exempt themselves and most these
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:29.360]  countries from the taxes stay there Lord Monkton don't mean to cut you off but
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.160]  the music cuts off your skype there we're gonna come right back with Lord
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.440]  Monkton to get more into this and have him finish his point they got cut off
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:38.760]  there did you know the EU bureaucrats don't pay taxes because they make the
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:43.800]  rules man these people are incredible thousands and thousands of them are
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:48.680]  paid more than the British Prime Minister we'll be right back stay with us

[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:41.080]  I don't care I tell you I don't care I'm a human being I exist if I speak one
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:46.280]  for a lot that thought lives even after I'm shoveled in my grave
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:53.600]  delusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you inject into your veins to make you
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:57.920]  think you have a strength when you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:03.760]  spindly limbs and a green and the strength has no use for your crime
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:12.040]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:19.720]  Monday through Friday 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern we are blasting out on XM 166
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:26.200]  over 140 AM and FM affiliates global shortwave world service WWCR 100,000
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:32.480]  watts and audio streams video streams at prisonplanet.tv and info wars.com
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:36.920]  by the website called prisonplanet.tv or prisonplanet.com because the
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:40.720]  globalists in their own words say they're constructing a prison planet of
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:45.280]  four and by authoritarians our Constitution and Bill of Rights is of
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.720]  four and by the people based on the Magna Carta that Lord Moncton was
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:53.080]  foreshadowing earlier you know people don't know that in England the
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:57.880]  Parliament first voted to not have war with the colonies and the king had to
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:01.160]  go in there and convince them they had to do it but the ideas that we saw
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:08.760]  spring here in 1776 actually came out of a 500 year fight in England that had
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:12.920]  been happening for the rights of man and here we are today if you have any
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:16.280]  education any understanding of authoritarianism this is what we're
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.960]  facing before we go back to Lord Moncton I want to and your phone calls I want
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:23.760]  to show you some articles here now I talked about this six years ago Paul
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.960]  Watson wrote an article about its LinkedIn and Verizon follows Google and
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:32.400]  turning phones and TVs into wiretaps in force first broke story of invasive
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:37.600]  spying six years ago it's already going on here is the Daily Mail the TV box that
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:41.800]  can detect when you're cuddling on the sofa and show you an advert for condoms
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.640]  system uses motion sensors microphones and thermal imaging this is going on all
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:51.360]  the new cars all the new video game consoles connect Microsoft all of it
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:57.640]  cameras to view viewers described by campaign as a privacy nightmare and you
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:00.800]  know Google won't even let you turn it off you know I first reported on this
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:11.360]  almost seven years ago people didn't believe it people didn't believe it even
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.320]  though we had a link to Google and a press release to shareholders now they
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:20.320]  admit and but you know the NSA admits and and the Brits are doing this to
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:24.840]  Europe's doing it they say well it's okay that your computer and your cell
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:29.120]  phone listens to you even when it's off that's by global regulations it's
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:32.360]  installed on all of them told you about that 96 when the first started the
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:37.640]  telecommunications act ladies and gentlemen the magnitude of this is just
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:44.240]  off the charts they they say well it's an AI computer recording keywords
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:48.640]  checking it for advertising and other things but government says oh we don't
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:51.360]  come look at it once the computer says you did something wrong and then that's
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:54.920]  probable cause so you pre-listen and then the computer because it's a
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:58.960]  computer it's okay they say it's not personal and then a person goes and looks
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.840]  at what's all recorded and the and the former top NSA officials have been
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:05.680]  coming out as you know the last two weeks saying everything's recorded
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.280]  everything's listened to well I knew that until communications act same thing in
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:13.240]  Europe in the mid 90s they put this in with all the manufacturers and the
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:18.160]  regulations it have all this what's how we knew Lord Monty I want to get back
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:20.720]  into the UN and where it's going and take calls and we're getting into rain
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:25.520]  washing kids but they are building this Panopticon spy system that makes
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:35.320]  Orwell's nightmare look like Valhalla you know a heavenly heavenly plane and here
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:40.760]  we are it's all racing ahead and it's all engineered by the military industrial
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:46.120]  complex that Eisenhower warned us about where does it end how does it end I mean
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:51.120]  you read the British Ministry of Defense report in 2007 you know saying what
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.440]  the world will be like in the next 10 years and it describes the world the
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:59.800]  resources cut off a post industrial system reeducation centers same thing
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:04.000]  with our army prospectuses I mean the elite they don't tell the army the whole
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.040]  story when you know what the policy planners are doing you understand why
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:11.360]  they're telling the army get ready for this as if it's just going to happen on
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:14.240]  its own why are these because you know these people better than anybody you've
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:16.320]  worked in the highest levels of government you've been around these
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:21.400]  globalists constantly what is the sycophantic desire for hellish
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:28.280]  tyranny well what is it in these people it's very very strange because in the
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:32.240]  past in Britain when we were the first country in the world to install machinery
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:38.880]  to listen to every telephone call we actually did it before the second world
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:43.880]  the sky went down we're going to reconnect to get him to talk about this
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:47.200]  this is so important I mean I have three children a lot of you have children
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:53.040]  folks this is all admitted now okay we'll see if we can reconnect to him over
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.560]  in the Middle East no in the globalists he's over in Qatar they'll
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:59.440]  probably they probably I mean they're trying to throw him out of the country
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:05.480]  right now we'll get him back on I just the person whom you're trying to read
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:10.360]  all right he probably doesn't know he's disconnected he's probably still talking
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:17.200]  just he pretty connecting or sending him a Skype message I mean there's got to be
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:23.200]  there's got to be a way out of this I mean and I know what it is I see these
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:28.960]  full-grown men who don't talk to each other act real opium most men especially
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.080]  if they're mid-level executives or whatever you know think they're rich or
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:35.760]  whatever as they make 200 grand a year that real quiet they're real serious
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:42.840]  it's all about their aura of how powerful they are and you know acting
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.040]  cool and acting strong and they don't have lives they do their business they
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:51.800]  go play golf they go watch a football game and they and you're not real
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:56.120]  people you're just programmed by the culture and you think you're gonna get
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:01.640]  ahead by not being involved you should be charging around the world if you have
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:06.040]  the money fighting the globalists like Lord Moncton and I mean this is serious
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:11.440]  people they are they are shutting down our society and there are enemies we
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:14.200]  have to take this serious Lord Moncton you got cut off when you were talking
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:20.520]  about Britain was the first place to put in the total surveillance grid at the
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:24.720]  NSA systems based off of please continue sir we did this before the Second
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:29.680]  World War every telephone call was then listened to individually that's how we
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:35.120]  were able to round up every single German agent in the UK bar one and the
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.120]  story of that one is a very interesting one that I'll tell you one day it hasn't
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:44.080]  come out in the official histories yet but there after we were the first to
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:48.920]  develop these computers that could listen to every telephone call look for
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:53.680]  key words alert operators listen to this one listen to that one so that there
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:57.040]  could be complete surveillance and interestingly in those days in the
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:02.600]  1960s and 70s it was the left who were saying this was outrageous it shouldn't
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:06.760]  happen this was the world being taken over by the military industrial complex
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.960]  exactly as you say Eisenhower warned about in his in his farewell speech as
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:16.760]  president and yet now it's the left that are arguing for these things and the
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.560]  right that are saying this has all gone too far has been an astonishing turn
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:25.320]  round in political outlook but of course the left are always more numerous in
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:31.520]  government because the left are believers in regulating and controlling and spying
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:36.080]  on everybody else they always have been that's what 1984 by George Orwell was
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:40.920]  all about your television screen watching you big brother is watching you
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:46.400]  he was the first to see that this is exactly what would come and here we are
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:52.360]  already with every computer such as mine with a little camera I looking out at
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:57.800]  you what I do Alex and this views them is you just stick a little piece of tape
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.480]  over that when you're not actually using the camera and they can't see through
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:06.040]  that so there are oh that's what I do listen 15 years ago I'd have family at
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:10.600]  the house and have the webcam covered or the camera on the screen covered and
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:14.360]  they'd say you're crazy why are you doing that or other people it's because I was
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:19.520]  reading the patents I knew they were I've talked to people who 25 years ago had
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:25.240]  government programs hiding microphones in TVs being sent out to the public this
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:30.360]  has been going on for so long and now they're building giant spy bases
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:34.640]  everywhere and they're admitting that they're spying on patriots people that
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:40.360]  don't want a Soviet model what is really happening is that you've got the
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:45.680]  governing class worldwide ganging up on the ordinary people worldwide this is a
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:50.240]  completely new phenomenon the idea of governments and keep an eye on what
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:55.000]  their people are doing is not new what is new is that this is totalitarian in
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.640]  every sense it's the entire governing class trying to make sure that people
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:04.920]  like you and me are shut down and excluded I mean the sheer anger when I
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:12.280]  spoke for 45 seconds and told those UN delegates three things they wouldn't have
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.000]  heard from anybody else they didn't believe them because they'd never heard
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:22.920]  them before they were furious because just for once one had got through the
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:29.720]  cordon of cotton wool that surrounds them and they were made to listen whether
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:34.880]  they like it liked it or not I didn't shout I wasn't rude I quietly said what
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:40.360]  I wanted to say and then stopped it only took 45 seconds out of their session
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:45.400]  and what do they do they banned me from the conference if I had said the opposite
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:49.160]  they wouldn't even what about these reports they may try to throw you out
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:53.560]  of the country well they can try but they're not going to get very far with
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:44:00.280]  that frankly so all of that sort of thing you know the UN has a nice little
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:05.560]  deal with each country it goes to that if the UN withdraws the credentials and
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.840]  it's the kind of country where your visa is dependent on having the credentials
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:15.960]  then they think they can get away with saying well you know if you're here
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:20.640]  beyond midnight then you'll be arrested by the country that's the host country
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:23.800]  and you go to jail because you're an illegal immigrant this is the kind of
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:30.160]  thing they do try on but here I am still in the gulf it didn't work and I don't
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:33.480]  you know I don't get worried by that sort of thing because I can play the
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:37.960]  bureaucratic game frankly better than they can so that that that sort of thing
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:45.120]  just doesn't work but certainly they are incandescent with fury not because I
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:50.640]  spoke for 45 seconds and pretended to be the Republic of Burma no because that
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:55.880]  was perfectly harmless and it was only 45 seconds what annoyed them was what I
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:45:01.720]  said and who I said and just add something here before he got a call these
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:05.840]  were national negotiating delegates these were the people right at the top of
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:10.280]  the tree on this whole climate scan and for the first time they were told what
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:14.720]  nobody had told them before no global warming for 16 years it can't be said
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:18.840]  often enough all right I want to go to some phone calls here but getting back
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:24.480]  to the total spying government tries to make everything it does secret and then
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:28.560]  exempt itself from what it does to us but the answer to bring these people
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:34.800]  down is expose them everyone get active everyone go confront people everybody
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:40.000]  go speak at city council everybody go testify the legislative hearings any
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.640]  citizen that wants to can get into these these are on the record fire the
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:48.280]  truth at them at every angle and as things get worse and worse under their
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:55.200]  system everyone's going to know it's them all we've got to do is call them out
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:00.240]  thousands of times never stopping our irresistible force and we will
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:04.520]  politically rip their arms out of their sockets folks if you've ever been in a
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:08.080]  fight and you know you're going to win it when you just click into that mode of
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:12.080]  I'm going to win this and folks you've got to decide we're going to beat these
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:16.320]  people you've got to just irresistibly reach out and never stop attacking them
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:21.080]  in little ways all of us together can move mountains Lord Monkton comment on
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:25.160]  that and ways to crush these authoritarian sick of ant tyrants that are
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:30.040]  beyond 1984 and then I want to go to some phone calls you can do this is the
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:34.920]  first thing always use an old mobile phone they don't have all this fancy
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:38.600]  new technology built in because they will before the laws will pass so there
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:43.000]  are various ways you can kind of get partly or even completely off the net
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.920]  where they can see what you're doing funny enough I first came across this
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:51.000]  years ago when I wrote up the quite by accident a piece for a column I used to
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.320]  write for the evening standard saying that I'd come across some people in the
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:59.640]  remotest Yorkshire Dales in the middle of the countryside who had been to say
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:03.480]  they're packed to see their Paris priest to get some financial advice and he'd
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:07.120]  said do it this way and that way and then you won't end up paying too much tax on
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:10.560]  it and they said oh no that that doesn't make any difference to us it's all yes
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.880]  it does you know you have to do it this way rather than that way I said no it
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:17.440]  doesn't make any difference to us you see we haven't joined and this particular
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:20.960]  household none of its members had a birth certificate they didn't have a
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:24.360]  telephone they weren't on the electricity they generated their own
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:29.360]  nobody knew they existed they were running a very successful farm they paid no
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:34.640]  tax at all because they were completely off the net and when I wrote about this
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:38.400]  because I was quite intrigued that such a thing was even possible this end of the
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:43.940]  21st century the Treasury the UK Treasury was absolutely furious with
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:48.960]  me for writing this because they said it would give other people ideas so you do
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:52.440]  have particularly in a country as wide as the United States with lots of open
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:57.840]  spaces the ability simply to drop off the net and disappear and some people are
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:02.360]  beginning I mean I spoke to an eminent dentist from Texas the other day who
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:07.760]  had made elaborate preparations to do exactly that people are I think now
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:14.760]  rightly worried by the scale on which are ever dumber but ever more grasping
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:20.560]  and ambitious governing class is trying to take everything over and is destroying
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:24.960]  our economy as it does so but of course that we know that where that will
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.640]  ultimately lead yes they can impose dictatorship on us for a bit but then as
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:34.960]  it always does with dictatorships the money will run out they will collapse
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:39.480]  freedom will come back and because we've been through yet another round of
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:45.080]  dictatorship we will learn still further and that's the historical cycle and the
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:49.600]  globalist as you know admit that and they say they're studying show their
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:53.000]  authoritarianism will not go through that cycle they call it the final
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.120]  revolution of people want to look up that term now expanding on this issue I
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:01.440]  have found with government and other systems it's all bluster it's all the
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:06.560]  image that every spy is James Bond and every bureaucrat is invincible and the
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:11.320]  public's all just scared and cowardly I have found that when I want to sneak in
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:15.680]  Bohemian Grove or I want to end I mean I just walked into a federal building just
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:19.080]  said open the gate and walked in the other day and they freaked out once I
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:22.040]  got in there but the I'm gonna show that next week we haven't got the video
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:26.960]  edited yet it was like 30 minutes of it my point is people just don't know the
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:31.000]  power that an individual has when you know you're in the right we are
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.760]  incredibly powerful individuals Lord Moncton well I think that's true I mean
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:40.160]  if you look at the sort of noises I have been trying to make on the climate over
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:44.240]  the last few years I wouldn't say I'm a lone voice there are perhaps a dozen
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:47.960]  other gallant people who are spending a lot of time on this and getting
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:52.960]  themselves home but there aren't many of us who are really outspoken on this and
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:57.320]  certainly very few who are willing to take the risk of doing what I did at the
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:01.760]  UN yesterday and calling them out in public and saying look come on this
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:06.680]  you've got the science wrong you need to rethink this the fact is that it does
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:10.880]  carry an enormous amount of weight of course you know I can imagine that all
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.760]  my friends are going to be in touch with the serious minded ones and say don't
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.600]  you realize what a fool you've made yourself look but all the other people
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:23.080]  are saying well nobody else is saying anything to stop this nonsense and if
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:27.080]  this is the only way to get it through it's not exactly as though I'd thrown a
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:32.640]  bomb or something all I'd done was to take 45 seconds of their time and they've
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:36.360]  been there for two weeks already so I don't think they minded very much what
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:41.480]  they minded was what I said because they hadn't heard it before and the
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:46.280]  important thing is therefore to make sure that you write to your congressmen
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:51.200]  your senators you telephone them even if you end up speaking to a staffer this
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:54.680]  does get through in the end that's right stay there Lord Moncton call
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:59.680]  straight ahead for two short segments in a jam-packed third hour stay with us
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:04.200]  if you've ever wanted to be able to produce boiling hot water any time
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:07.920]  anywhere with absolutely no power whatsoever then this is going to be the
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:11.600]  most important message you'll ever hear here's why there's a brand new self
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:15.200]  reliance product available that makes producing piping hot water in any

[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:06.280]  hey there Frank Bates here have you heard about the weird device that could
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:12.040]  wipe out 280 million Americans this is really scary stuff defense experts
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:16.760]  warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known in fact
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:20.320]  just a few weeks ago former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:23.800]  op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:28.200]  can't believe that more people aren't talking about this it may be because the
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:32.160]  liberals and the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:37.360]  created a free video at weird device dot com that exposes this threat and blows
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:42.240]  the doors off a conspiracy go watch the shocking video at weird device dot com
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:47.640]  right now to discover exactly what it is plus discover the number one way you and

[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:19.280]  the interest is up and the stock market's down and you only get mugged if
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:22.280]  you go downtown

[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:40.880]  all right Lord Moncton is our guest I'm Alex Jones our host and we've got to
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:43.880]  get in a pair of sizes of taking over our society that's the bottom line of
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:47.840]  what's happening we're gonna go ahead and go to some of your phone calls here
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:54.680]  right now let's talk to Julio in Illinois listing on 15 30 AM WCKG that's in
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:55:01.400]  Chicago welcome to the airwaves Julio go ahead Aloha and Lord Moncton thank you
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:06.440]  for all of your work over the years exposing this fraud and these mad
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:10.560]  scientists that's what they are and Lord Moncton I have a question for you it's
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:16.400]  quite clear that you know people know what they're what they're doing and as
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:20.520]  of late with Hurricane Sandy or as they call it Superstorm Sandy they're trying
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:23.960]  to take advantage of this one of the heads of NASA wrote in the London
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:28.640]  Telegraph that now we need carbon taxes because we're going to see more extreme
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:33.520]  weather they have to they have what they call climate engineering these mad
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:37.600]  scientists want to manipulate the weather in their own words to help curb
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:42.280]  climate change do they discuss any of this in Doha or were they discussing ways
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:48.880]  to expose extreme weather to carbon taxes doing all of these things are on the
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:53.480]  agenda they're still very keen on what they call carbon capture and storage
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:58.280]  which has not been proven to work and would probably be quite dangerous as
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:03.640]  well as wickedly expensive and wasteful of fossil fuels because you use 40%
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:08.840]  more fossil fuel if you want to shove the carbon dioxide back into the ground
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:12.840]  after it's emitted when you burn it so they've been discussing all of these
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:18.120]  things and geoengineering hasn't really been featured that much at this
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:23.960]  particular conference because it's begun to seem just pretty kooky and one of the
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:29.160]  things that they're quite worried about here is the kookiness of a number of
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:31.880]  people that get attracted to these conferences I mean there was a there
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:37.880]  was a person who was visually marketing a perpetual motion power station which I
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:42.640]  had had looked at last year by a nuclear physicist I knew in South Africa when I
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:46.040]  was at the Durban conference and he asked the one question is it a closed
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:49.040]  system they said yes he said he said in that case it's a perpetual motion
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:53.480]  machine it wouldn't work and all these cooks are now turning up here saying we
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:57.040]  can geoengineer we can do this we can do that just give us a few trillion and
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:02.400]  we'll do it for you and even the delegates here who are pretty scientifically
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:07.520]  illiterate it has to be said are beginning to realize that some of these
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:11.560]  scientists are just looking to make themselves rich without delivering
[01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:14.600]  anything in return they are the old-fashioned as the economists call
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:19.880]  them rent seekers so no I think geoengineering is gradually disappearing
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:24.440]  off the radar we've got to keep an eye because they'll keep trying but I don't
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:30.160]  think it's the major danger I think the major danger is of taxation and
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:36.680]  regulation and interference with how much electricity you can use and when
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:41.720]  you can use it and they're very cleverly marketing this by calling them smart
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:47.800]  metering the smart grid it's something you hear Al Gore talking about and you
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:51.320]  know if he's talking about it's going to be bad and it's a surveillance grid where
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:54.560]  it watches everything in your house all the new appliances are coming out to
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:58:00.600]  interface with it these people are it's be it's like ten times 1984 with a bunch
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:06.160]  of weird tempering ninnies but but I guess they're not like Hitler whether
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:10.120]  in a uniform or Napoleon so people aren't threatened by it they just
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:17.880]  hover around all day it's very very clever the presentation it's all for
[01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:22.000]  your own good we're saving the planet it's good for the environment the kids
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.440]  are joining in you know it's all touchy-feely it's very emotional but in
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:31.560]  fact it's very dangerous because they are trying to go for ever more control
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:37.600]  over every aspect of our lives but there are ways to sir we got to go to break
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:48.840]  stay with us you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today

[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:16.120]  air hello mr. Jones and Lord Monkton the first Merry Christmas to both you and your families I was just wondering Lord Monkton if you thought the new reverse technology they're
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:22.920]  going to use is going to be like the total way to get that green text in implemented
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:28.440]  because you know everyone has to use like a cell phone or their computer even
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:33.960]  their television their appliances you know is that something that is behind the
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:39.160]  scenes that you know the you've investigated that's let me try to get a
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:43.400]  question out of that you're saying I've got the question go ahead I've got the
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:47.840]  question let me let me say it the question is can they use all these new
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:52.520]  technologies that we now spend so much our time talking to each other with in
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:56.320]  order to control us monitor us learn about us tell us instructions turn off
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:00.640]  our electricity yes they can and they will if they think they can get away
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:07.640]  with it but the great thing is that as people become more aware of this there
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:12.360]  are things that can be done about it you can retrofit your devices with
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:17.400]  additional devices that filter out their ability to watch you listen to you
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:22.600]  control you turn off your electricity etc and we can invent and install these
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:27.760]  devices faster than they can pass laws saying we're not allowed to and in the
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:32.840]  end we will simply get the better of them by out technologizing them the
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:38.440]  great thing is what they're trying to do is actually wildly ambitious and with
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:43.240]  very very simple precautions you can prevent them doing it for instance the
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:47.280]  two guys who invented pretty good privacy which is a form of encoding and
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:51.480]  encrypting your emails they use the thing called a trapdoor cipher which was a
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:57.160]  very nice advanced concept in mathematics which prevented the
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:02.920]  authorities from being able to decode the emails of people who use this
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:08.400]  particular system and that's the first of many such devices and possibilities
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:12.080]  that are now beginning to come on to the market it's going to be a huge growth
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:19.520]  industry when people realize just how unfree they could be made if they were
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:25.000]  to allow these devices which now as Alex is saying have these built-in abilities
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.720]  to communicate with the center let's get a little more Lord Monckton Frank and
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:35.040]  Louisiana you're on the air listening on short life yes you know we know that
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:39.040]  these globalists are a diabolical mindset and they're godless missing
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:44.280]  tropes and I remember the 90s Catherine Bertini of the UN World Fruit Group came
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:49.400]  out and said that food is a weapon we use it to control people for this we do
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:53.960]  not apologize what is Lord Monckton think about this and has he seen any of that
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:59.040]  coming up well indeed this is exactly what has been going on and even from
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:04.400]  within the UN there isn't there are now concerns about this kind of flagrant
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:09.360]  interference by the UN in of course chiefly the lives of poor people in the
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:14.240]  poorer countries and the UN's right to food rapporteur
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:25.680]  her Jean Ziegler said in 2007 that the biofuels scam was a crime against
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:31.520]  humanity he said when people are you know when millions are starving the
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:36.720]  diversion of food to biofuels is a crime against them they themselves are
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:40.560]  beginning to realize that this is wrong and that is why I went into that
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:45.520]  well well said Lord Monckton great job great job they're fighting for us
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:51.160]  scienceandpublicpolicy.org that's the correct site right that's the one

[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:35.760]  going to have the premiere of a video we're not we're still not telling everybody
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:39.680]  his name yet because mama mama and ready for my son to be a hundred percent
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:44.800]  public yet I'm a ten-year-old son but this was his idea from listening to the
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:51.840]  show and we're gonna play coming up in a little while the the the premiere of a
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:58.920]  my son on air with terrorism 101 but first off the bad news I predicted it
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:02.560]  wasn't hard to predict the big mega banks want your money the middle class
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:08.560]  and poor people and that's why the Democrats are now saying led by Mr. Dean
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:12.000]  will play that clip later that the poor people need to pay more money to well
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.200]  don't worry you will you're gonna get cut from 40 hours of 30 or 20 hours and
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:19.200]  you'll have to get a second or third job and they'll say oh look there's more
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:23.680]  jobs in the economy people are getting more jobs it is so horrible it's designed
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:28.440]  to make it where you can't get out of you know poverty and then become working
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:33.320]  class and then become upper blue collar and then become lower middle class it's
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:37.680]  one authoritarians have always thought to do in every regime is freeze the
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:40.400]  classes and get rid of the middle class and it's it's just it's gonna be
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:44.720]  devastating we've already lost about half our wealth the last 30 years they've
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:48.720]  erased things back to the 50s level that's been out major statistics last
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:51.880]  month they got double the number of people on food stamps now as you know
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:56.880]  and here's the Washington Post headline Republicans wave the white flag and they
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:00.640]  say one of Boehner's lieutenants Pete Roscombe of Illinois stepped up to the
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:06.240]  microphone essentially pleading for the president to show mercy and he said and
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:13.320]  it goes on to say that right now he's hoping to lead that is Boehner the
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:17.840]  fraxis GOP to an orderly surrender and they're talking about giving Obama
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:24.720]  unlimited money and giving the power of the purse to Obama so I mean this is the
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:31.200]  total move in a dictatorship I mean it's really really happening and and the
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:35.560]  other Republicans are like 990 billion in tax increases get rid of 600 billion
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:43.520]  in in write-offs just devastating we agree with your 3.8 percent tax on all
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:48.400]  investments devastating we agree to this we agree to that we agree to get rid of
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:54.440]  the home exemption the tax write-off I mean it the country is gonna go into
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:59.240]  cardiac arrest and that's the plan and then the government will be your saver
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:02.280]  with more welfare and more food stamps and there'll be a hundred million on
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:10.400]  food stamps to be informed and to watch this and to have Obama supporters I
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:14.680]  see the YouTube videos of them we get calls from them they giggle they laugh
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:20.320]  they go you lost you wanted Romney and I'm like Romney was up by the same people
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:23.080]  and a placeholder the Republicans are sold out the same people they're gonna
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:26.880]  go along with Obama no they're not you scum racist in fact the funniest thing
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:31.040]  ever is it info wars.com you guys punch up my screen please yeah it's still up

[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:39.680]  up so I can read the name of the artist this is the funniest cartoon I've seen a
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:43.760]  long time it shows a donkey at the optometrist you know looking through the
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:49.280]  eye machine through different lenses to see what type of prescription the donkey
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:54.840]  in a suit the Democratic Party needs and they're looking at the wall you know
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:58.680]  that normally has letters in it and he's looking through the lens machine and
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:04.280]  Uncle Sam is the optometrist the doctor and it says we are 16 trillion in debt
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:11.840]  it's 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 in debt and he's pointing at it and what is
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:19.560]  the donkey saying he's reading what is the donkey saying he's reading he says
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:27.120]  he sees the word racist exactly true you're a Ku Klux Klan member if you
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:30.320]  own a gun that's what they're now putting out on Fox Sports and then they
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:33.520]  have them on national TV and people agree with it that's right it's racist
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:37.000]  yeah yeah gun gun or should phrase it yeah the Ku Klux Klan doesn't want us to
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.480]  you know take the guns the Ku Klux Klan literally got the first gun laws passed
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:47.720]  in the South on record on record I was like hey we're in deep debt we this is
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:51.480]  not sustainable mega banks want us bankrupt we get they're loaning us zeros

[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:48.280]  anyways oh man oh man all right enough of that our own reporter David Ortiz
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:52.840]  doing a great job went out and did this piece because now they're talking about
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:59.400]  in the news they're talking about bringing things like Black Friday to the
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:03.160]  day of Christmas and the day after Christmas more hysteria so the Black
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:07.440]  Friday is Asian fighting over Chinese slave goods and turns out it's one of
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:10.960]  the worst days of the year to go shopping cuz they they they increase the
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:14.120]  prices the week before then lower it then or they even just up prices and
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:17.440]  people think well this is that and they'll go fight over just anything women
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:22.320]  fighting people stampeding well I wish they'd stampede for freedom I wish they'd
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:26.520]  stampede to read a book I wish they'd stampede to be you know smart enough to
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:32.160]  wipe their own rear ends let's go ahead and go to his piece here it is
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:43.400]  the immense popularity of Black Friday and the introduction of Thanksgiving day
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:47.760]  shopping this year is prompting many Americans to question the mental health
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:52.400]  of people who participate in these events the success of Thanksgiving day
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:56.640]  shopping has also prompted many media outlets to hint that Christmas day
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:01.080]  shopping could be introduced to the public in coming years we asked local
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:04.800]  austinites would they think of this prospect okay do you want a Black
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:13.200]  Friday Christmas no no no why not because you have 364 other days to
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:18.600]  shop and I don't think people should shop on Christmas Day absolutely not I
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:22.520]  believe that Black Friday for Thanksgiving is already enough for the
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:28.080]  American consumer and Black Friday Christmas will destroy everything
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:37.360]  really Christmas is about finally destroy it for real no why not first of
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:42.840]  all you know what it is absolutely not I think that that would ruin Christmas it
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:48.040]  just would to make it its own holiday would be I don't know I don't like it
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:54.200]  that'd be awesome yes definitely I think it would help I mean if they want to be
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:57.560]  open go for it I'm not gonna be out there shopping so I'll be with family
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:16:01.240]  hanging out at home relaxing what are your thoughts when you see videos of
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:07.080]  people trampling each other for Rachi products white trash
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:13.600]  never number one stand in that line number two I would never like trample
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:17.400]  over people to get something at Walmart I feel like there's not connect they
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:24.280]  lost all connection with humans and they see humans as sort of just a roadblock
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:28.680]  in their in their their life I guess they they're just completely closed off to
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:34.360]  others and just really simple minded well I think it's funny like I said
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:42.920]  people get trampled you think it's funny well it's kind of hard for me to say
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:47.400]  because I'm one of them sometimes it's kind of an adrenaline rush to see you
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:51.280]  know they have five products at this price and there's 20 people going for
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:55.560]  it you know who can it's like who can win the trophy well I'm working in
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:59.320]  medical field and we had a lot of people that actually had broken bones
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:05.400]  because of Black Friday you know they got the TV but they had a $4,000
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:08.640]  doctor bill to go along with it according to the National Retail
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:13.720]  Federation stores that were open this past Thanksgiving Day experienced a 22
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:18.120]  percent increase in profits over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend according
[02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:22.600]  to the Wall Street Journal in past years many retail stores were also closed
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:26.680]  from Memorial Day 4th of July and Labor Day what do you think of the fact that
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:30.480]  a lot of experts say that the discounts on Black Friday aren't even that great I
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:35.080]  agree totally agree they're not that great they just make you spend more
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:40.680]  money so they're not that good you can get the same discounts if you just watch
[02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:45.320]  the ads and look online I didn't know that that's pretty interesting though I
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:50.400]  didn't know that either I mean the first the first toy that I ever got from
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:54.600]  Black Friday was the Game Boy Color and it was like $40 when we got it at the
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:59.480]  time that was something that cost $200 so I always thought Black Friday was a
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:04.240]  great deal there's the Black Friday desicion of society boost holiday morale
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:08.400]  or hurt holiday morale in your opinion I don't know if it boosts or hurts but
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:12.600]  it certainly changes the focus and that's the problem I mean it can boost it
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:17.040]  it can because I mean it's kind of a family thing a lot of families make it
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:22.120]  an event to go and get everyone together so in a way it can create like a family
[02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:27.240]  thing for Info Wars Nightly News I'm David Ortiz

[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:27.040]  hello your friendly neighborhood patriot here for an episode of how terrorism really works
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:44.040]  first off our terrorist group needs a scary name can you say LCI ADA let's try again
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:51.840]  LCI ADA ah it does roll off the tongue LCI ADA it's a perfect name now let's say
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:57.640]  the green piece here represents the terrorists a terrorist then move into
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:04.880]  Pakistan or Afghanistan or whatever Stan is not under banker control the media
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:10.080]  then joins in to hype up the terror threat dry hands with impunity from
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:20.880]  safety once the terror threat is established the banksters puppets
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:24.640]  send in the troops to take out the terrorists they put in there in the
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:29.400]  first place then the bankers install their own dictator to take control of
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:36.320]  the resources and oppress the people as a bonus the banks wire the black ops and
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:41.000]  intelligence agencies will then hit the drugs back into the host country so they
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:45.960]  can imprison their own citizens for using the drugs make huge profits selling
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:50.600]  the drugs which finance other terror operations around the globe and the
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:54.920]  carry on the top is billions upon billions made on money laundering
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:27:00.560]  operations for the bankers in a sense you watching as this opium is being
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:05.120]  grown I know it grinds at your gut how do you deal with it what are you doing
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:09.640]  about it well frankly this is a part of their culture so while it might grind in
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:14.720]  my gut it's what they do and if the citizens of the host country gets wise
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:19.680]  to these schemes or gets uppity the banks via media will hype in nuclear
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:25.280]  terror threat or the underwear bomber or Christmas tree bomber any excuse to take
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:31.560]  the American people's rights well that just about wraps it up for terrorism
[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:37.240]  101 how terrorism really works I'm your friendly neighborhood patriot and now

[02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:49.640]  excerpt of the full 50-minute Joe Rogan interview because you know waking Joe Rogan up to the
[02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:52.840]  New World Order is gonna be a powerful tool because he's one of the most popular people
[02:33:52.840 --> 02:33:58.920]  out there in the culture you know that isn't a zombie like Lindsay Lohan or something.
[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:05.960]  He's a really smart guy and you know Joe my first name 14 years ago you know didn't buy
[02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:09.720]  into a lot of this stuff he didn't trust the government but he's he's really woken up a lot
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:17.400]  and he's a really funny smart guy but you know at the same time it's an it's important to try to
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:21.640]  get converts to what's happening with the New World Order out there like Ventura didn't believe
[02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:27.400]  me five years ago they were putting cancer viruses in the vaccines now he does and by the way Ventura
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:34.440]  is on Monday let's go ahead and go to a phone call here Ted in Tennessee you're on the air sir welcome
[02:34:35.240 --> 02:34:42.120]  hello Alex how are you today good my friend okay I have a simple little question but I have a few
[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:47.720]  statements to go ahead of it the federal reserve which is not part of the United States government
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:54.840]  leases its money to the federal government the income tax that we pay does not actually benefit
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:35:02.200]  the United States government but pays the lease on the currency that we use since the elite or the
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:11.800]  top 2% use the money and basically have abused that money to the point that it's been devalued
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:19.240]  because the federal reserve keeps putting more money in to cover their butts basically why not
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:29.000]  just raise the the elite or top 2% the amount that the money becomes devalued so therefore
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:36.920]  not just raise their money 39% but go back as you said earlier going back to the 1950s rate
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:45.320]  put them back to the 90% and put then therefore making the money cover or their money's use
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:54.200]  putting it back to the value that we were at at that time of making the money something that is
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:59.720]  of a value that we can understand sure sure sir I mean we have to kick the mafia out that runs it
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:04.840]  but let me just explain something number one to say that the top 2% if you make over a quarter
[02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:10.200]  million dollars a year in the top 2% okay people making a quarter million a million five million
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:15.800]  a year are not even near the ultra rich who are billionaires controlling leverage trillions
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:22.280]  to take over the bankers created over a thousand five hundred trillion they control a fraud which
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:28.680]  they then had government sign on to they got investments invested in toxic fraud and then
[02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:34.120]  instead of saying triage it oh it's now infected everything so you've got to let us run things
[02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:38.520]  instead of them going to jail and we'll try to prop this up but there's no way to prop it up it's
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:44.120]  designed to consolidate everything so it is the top I've seen the number broken down there's less
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:50.280]  than 6,000 top globalist minions there's less than 20 elite families I mean I told people I did the
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:56.360]  research decades ago and now it's mainstream news the Rockefellers and Rothschilds in 2000s merged
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:01.320]  their banks now they've merged this year their private holdings well they were the Rockefellers
[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:08.600]  were always Rothschild agents and so this is what we're talking about here and so it's it's
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:15.160]  I mean do the math out of out of seven million three hundred million people if there's less than
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:22.600]  a few thousand it's not even point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine I mean it's it's it's okay
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:27.160]  and and and then they convince everybody rich people are the guy driving a nice new Corvette
[02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:31.800]  that lives in a million dollar house that's the guy that has a pool for the construction company
[02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:37.240]  to build that's the guy that goes and buys stuff at Dillerts that's the guy that goes out and buys
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:42.360]  a car that's the guy that puts kids through college that's who you want instead they tell the poor
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:49.400]  dumb down mass of people that's the reason you're poor is that guy all right so I hear you great
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:53.240]  question I appreciate your call let me go to this Joe Rogan piece right now and then I'll come back
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:57.400]  and go to your calls because I don't want to wait I just tried to tweet it out on Twitter to go out
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:38:02.600]  I don't see it here on my Twitter I did that yeah because I sent it out and then it didn't even do
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:09.320]  anything on my phone so I'm gonna try to retweet it right now I'm a holy mackerel but again we
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:13.080]  bleeped out some of the racy stuff some people on YouTube are like why'd you bleep it because we're
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:18.520]  going to air it on the radio and plus we're held to such a high standard on YouTube that they will
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:23.560]  shut our channel down for a community guidelines violation everybody else can cuss but I suppose
[02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:28.440]  I don't want to you know and I'm not judging people like kids we're talking about not using
[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:34.360]  King's English it's just funny you know I'm on AM and FM stations and the FCC will come and will
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:40.520]  give me a $4,000 fine and then a $50,000 fine and then a million dollar fine like Howard Stern
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:44.360]  so that's that's why these are bleeped I mean it's just the children on the internet that's
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:49.880]  what they're going hey I want to hear the cussing you know again it's cut out none of that even
[02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:53.880]  matters it's just I don't want to debate or to discuss it here's this great interview with Joe
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:59.000]  and I'm calling this excerpt Joe Rogan on government conspiracies here it is
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:10.600]  at your gut level Joe what do you think about the middle I'm right I don't know you know first of
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:16.520]  all I think that being a position that I think whenever you talk about any any the intense
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:25.800]  military operation like that those guys those those Navy SEALs that did that was Navy SEALs yes
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:32.760]  those are some of the best on the planet I mean I I have a lot of respect for someone's ability
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:39.160]  fortitude character discipline the type of discipline involved in being a Navy SEAL I have
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:46.600]  a tremendous amount of respect for those type of human beings but what I what I don't necessarily
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:52.040]  trust is the people that make the decisions that put these guys into certain positions
[02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:59.560]  it's them that I trust implicitly like I understand the kind of discipline that it takes to be elite
[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:06.040]  at anything and when you're in an elite at something as life or death as being a Navy SEAL
[02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:13.160]  you're a bad period so I don't ever want to say anything that's disrespectful to anybody that's
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:22.920]  in that position because I I I respect their intentions 100% but it sounds like a silly story
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:27.160]  like everybody says this guy's been dead for a long time they said they've been logged I mean
[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:33.880]  I I see all these different people who've said that bin Laden had already been dead I don't know
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:40.120]  I wasn't there I have no information other than some that I read the newspaper or watch on TV
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:45.000]  but the official stories turn up don't be true and I what it seems like they lie about everything
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:53.400]  we're ready to do this seven what seven minutes good I seven minutes I actually talked I'm not
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:59.240]  gonna get a whole story but hey guys on ABC I'll be in Texas yeah turned up I'm gonna give too much
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:05.000]  away my family knows him he's not insulting sexual his body from a few that lived uh-huh the helicopter
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:09.560]  they blew up a helicopter that night they went in killed a target brought it out blew the helicopter
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:14.120]  up told the SEALs that was bin Laden the helicopters they got away and then the other SEALs got mad
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:19.880]  they blew up remember the SEALs uh-huh six the helicopter blew up a month later and the SEALs
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:25.880]  said someone man you're saying SEALs attacked other SEALs no no no what I'm saying is they send a
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:30.680]  bunch of helicopters right to kill a target right they're told get this target right right
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:36.440]  they bring bin Laden's body onto the helicopter it blew up right they blew it up then the rest of
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:42.040]  SEAL team six complained about it and most of them died and blew up they killed most people on the
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:48.200]  raid oh remember a month later the SEAL helicopters yeah I thought that was just another unrelated
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:53.080]  incident that was uh just part of like what they're doing over there is incredibly dangerous
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:57.640]  no it is but they blew it but that was the biggest loss in in the entire afghan war right but that
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:02.120]  is it's it'll be this or a real connection between those two I talked to the SEAL and he said we
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:07.080]  believe al-qaeda put a bomb on the plane on the helicopter or the or the government did
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:10.840]  but it could have been that they just got shot down too right is that possible well they said
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:15.240]  they never they're in war but they never but that was the biggest loss of SEALs the entire
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:19.800]  but sometimes that I saw shit goes down remember that scud missile that landed on that uh the
[02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:24.680]  the barracks in the first Iraq war there was like no deaths up until that very few deaths
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:28.920]  and then this one scud missile got through and killed a bunch of people and then that was that one
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:36.280]  big event I mean big events do happen but I mean my whole point is the fake situation room photo
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:41.880]  that later that was fake the burying at sea well yeah it seems like a silly story but the problem
[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:47.960]  is they this is the real problem the only reason why I should even be saying something like this
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:51.960]  the only reason why you should qualify when you say something like that like it seems like a silly
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:58.360]  story but this is this is my my reason for saying this I've saw the Jessica Lynch story
[02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:04.120]  which was the the girl who was injured in the Iraq war they said that they had to go in and
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:09.480]  rescue her and there was a gunfight and they rescued her and she said that that no such thing
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:15.960]  ever happened and she got in a lot of trouble and took a lot of heat by refuting the the official
[02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:23.640]  statement they tried to manufacture a narrative about what about Pat Tillman yes exactly that's
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:29.480]  two things well Pat Tillman the bottom line is whatever happened with him he was killed by
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:35.080]  friendly fire now that's not what was in the initial report the initial reports of his death were
[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:39.640]  that he had died in defending his country the corner wouldn't lie and said it was homicide
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:44.840]  well I mean was it homicide or was it a friendly fire I think there's a lot of
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:48.840]  confusion when you're in a war they shot him in a distance that he begged for his life I came up
[02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:52.600]  and triple tapped him right in the forehead but how do you know that though if you weren't but if
[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:58.760]  you weren't there corners report yeah but see man how do you unless you were there unless you saw
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:03.320]  how it happened the corners report it's going to show you guys shot no no no I hear you it's just
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:07.400]  when you have a history of Pat was sending letters back to his family said I'm going to go public on
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:13.080]  the war on drugs this whole thing's a fraud it's a lie and then he magically dies and I've just
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:17.960]  learned how their MO works but no no I hear you but it is but your what your possibility what you're
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:24.440]  saying is that is that's in the game too it's possible I didn't talk to his brother and I
[02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:29.800]  said his brother's hardcore man I saw his brother at the reading at his funeral where he was talking
[02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:36.280]  about how Pat didn't believe in God and Pat's dead you know and it was like it was really intense
[02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:42.920]  it was really intense and his story is a strange one I mean it's a guy who you know this square
[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:50.120]  jawed uber handsome super powerful athlete who decides who's going to defend his country like
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:56.440]  that football was secondary in his mind too I mean he was a real patriot I mean this is a guy who
[02:44:56.440 --> 02:45:02.520]  really abandoned this multi-million dollar lucrative career as a professional athlete
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:08.520]  to go and defend his country I mean that is a powerful human being that cannot be denied
[02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:12.920]  so it was a fraud was going to come back and speak now yeah and and was strong enough to
[02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:18.360]  realize that he had been duped and didn't you know look he's a dangerous guy to have against you
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:23.960]  and I think that the system you know doesn't like people like that and does that mean that he was
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:29.720]  murdered no because I think war is hell and I think horrible things happen in war and I think
[02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:34.440]  it's very possible that he could have accidentally gotten Joe you gotta go out in three minutes so
[02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:39.160]  let's just get this three minutes ladies and gentlemen before the new world order shuts this
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:46.440]  place down I remember meeting you like a 1998-99 14 years ago whatever it was and you were like
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:50.760]  yeah I know a lot of this is true but you're going too far with that has not a lot of what I talked
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:55.560]  about listen man I will tell you this and I give you credit for this all the time I there's a lot
[02:45:55.560 --> 02:46:01.320]  of things that used to say back in the 90s I thought you were crazy you were just ahead of your time
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:07.400]  you were way ahead of the curve you were way ahead of the curve on a lot of that was just massive
[02:46:07.960 --> 02:46:16.760]  conspiracy theory nonsense in the 1990s stuff that people would say there's no way the government
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:22.760]  would ever do something like indefinite suspension or detention rather of American civilians with
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:29.400]  no trial they would never do that completely unconstitutional boom there it is that your
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:37.160]  your video I I recommend this video all the time to people 9-11 the road to tyranny when you show
[02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:44.440]  that the world trade organization in Seattle was clearly invaded by agent provocateurs who are
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:50.120]  most likely military people you saw their their militants police spoke out there the military
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:55.160]  grade shoes the fact they weren't able to arrest these guys they had to let them go all that stuff
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:47:00.600]  that you showed all these people came into a nonviolent protest and became violent and then
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:05.160]  turned it into something that the police had to respond to I mean it's I never even thought that
[02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:11.560]  that would be in the the menu of the military I would have never believed it would and then
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:18.440]  many years after I met you the Freedom of Information Act documents for Operation Northwood
[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:24.360]  were released that was way after I met you years years later and I remember wow I remember reading
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:29.720]  that going like Alex Alex isn't crazy at all like they really planned on blowing up civilian
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:34.840]  jetliners they were gonna have a drone jetliner and blame it on Cuba and get us to go to war
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:39.800]  with Cuba they were gonna do all sorts of crazy things like that was really in the in the menu
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:46.760]  for you know the 1960s like that I thought you were bananas with some of this stuff you were
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:50.760]  talking about and a lot of that stuff that you were talking about has turned out to be
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:56.520]  absolutely a hundred percent true I gotta go on stage and do comedy give me a great job thank you
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:01.960]  brother thanks very much hey but hey like to tell the secret it was all in ran corporation
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:07.800]  documents they admitted it yeah they dragged her doing this job that's why I freak out all right
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:16.760]  that is kind of the end of the interview uh right there and on the subject of uh this stuff being
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:22.040]  admitted it was all admitted back then it wasn't that I was guessing all of this
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:31.240]  I mean they've done thousands and thousands of declassified studies some studies individually
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:36.760]  had over a hundred thousand people involved in them or they would radiate school kids say

[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:48.920]  radiation into them you know just unbelievable and there's thousands of things like that and then
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:55.320]  it's in the us code that they can kill you if it's for law enforcement or research purposes
[02:48:55.320 --> 02:48:59.880]  with radiation guns and everything else and it's all there oh you're like oh yeah what's the
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:06.440]  source on that us code total 50 chapter 32 subsection 1528 paragraph b people like little
