[00:00.000 --> 00:26.400]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:26.400 --> 00:34.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Eyes of March, March
[00:34.400 --> 00:39.120]  15th, 2022 broadcast.
[00:39.120 --> 00:49.400]  It was more than 2,000 years ago that Julius Caesar, the first Emperor of Rome, was stabbed
[00:49.400 --> 00:55.240]  to death inside the Roman Senate, and this has been seen as a very dangerous, unlucky
[00:55.240 --> 01:02.360]  day ever since then, and if you look at the continuation of the czars, which basically
[01:02.360 --> 01:08.600]  means the king or the Caesar in Russian, Russia particularly, more than any other country
[01:08.600 --> 01:14.040]  in modern history, but it's a 1,000-year-old civilization, kills its leaders when they
[01:14.040 --> 01:16.400]  fail.
[01:16.400 --> 01:24.080]  All systems do this, to some extent, but the Russians are the most extreme proximity
[01:24.080 --> 01:27.880]  to this, and there's a very good chance, that's why Lindsey Graham is out there talking
[01:27.880 --> 01:31.120]  about how people need to kill Putin.
[01:31.120 --> 01:36.160]  He's not just saying that for no reason, he's encouraging Russians to kill Putin.
[01:36.160 --> 01:40.600]  Obviously, this is all spiraling out of control, Putin is now not just arresting his spy
[01:40.600 --> 01:46.880]  chiefs for others, other reports of battlefield executions, of troops that don't follow
[01:46.880 --> 01:52.160]  orders, because what you have here is NATO starting a war, proxy war with Russia, so
[01:52.160 --> 01:59.160]  Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and really George Soros, yes, starting a war with Russia, Russia
[01:59.160 --> 02:05.720]  had a reason to do this, I'm not defending them going in, but then once Putin comes in
[02:05.720 --> 02:11.480]  and his armies bog down, because there's basically, they're fighting Slavic peoples
[02:11.480 --> 02:16.400]  that are where Russia was started, it'd be like asking people in Texas to go kill people
[02:16.400 --> 02:22.920]  in Oklahoma, or be like asking people in New York to go kill people in New Jersey, you're
[02:22.920 --> 02:27.400]  like, well, my aunt and uncle live in New Jersey, what are you going to be doing?
[02:27.400 --> 02:34.600]  Ukraine's more than 60% ethnic Russian, the rest is more Germanic type groups in the West,
[02:34.600 --> 02:39.040]  but they're all intermarrying, and I don't let listeners understand all this, it's just
[02:39.040 --> 02:50.000]  that having Putin tied down now, and definitely he was unable to pay off enough of the Ukrainian
[02:50.000 --> 02:57.800]  military, and the resistance like his generals in his KGB foreign head told him, that's what
[02:57.800 --> 03:02.080]  I said previously, I said, well, if it goes quickly, it means they pay off the opposition,
[03:02.080 --> 03:06.400]  that's what you do, it looks like they didn't do a good job of that, and so now he's in
[03:06.400 --> 03:11.040]  a no win situation, where if he doesn't win this, he'll be killed, though you'll hear
[03:11.040 --> 03:18.560]  he's had a stroke, or a heart attack, or a helicopter crash, and if, or a jet crash,
[03:18.560 --> 03:24.280]  or if he does continue to push, there'll be massive civilian casualties, and that will
[03:24.280 --> 03:30.200]  be more and more of a pretext for NATO to publicly come in, not just with all the US
[03:30.200 --> 03:37.560]  and British, and Scottish, and German, and French special forces that are on the ground,
[03:37.560 --> 03:44.000]  both former and current active duty fighting the little green men, that's what they call
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.320]  the Russians, because the Russians have denied that they've been in Eastern Ukraine the
[03:47.320 --> 03:53.440]  last eight years, and of course they have been there, and US troops, and European troops,
[03:53.440 --> 03:57.880]  and Russian troops, have been killing each other for at least eight years in a proxy
[03:57.880 --> 04:04.600]  war, and Putin's tired of that, and I understand the reason he went in, but it is extremely
[04:04.600 --> 04:09.840]  dangerous gamble, and he walked into a trap, and he said that now, they've put the people
[04:09.840 --> 04:14.800]  in house arrest, and said they told me that they had already cleaned out the opposition,
[04:14.800 --> 04:18.600]  that they were going to fold, so now we're in a world where it isn't about being on Russia's
[04:18.600 --> 04:22.280]  side, or Ukraine's side, or the US side, or the EU side, it's about being on the side
[04:22.280 --> 04:28.120]  of survival, and we have, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Gutierrez, will
[04:28.120 --> 04:32.440]  play this clip when we come back next segment, saying we're on the verge of nuclear war,
[04:32.440 --> 04:38.280]  and we are, and I've talked to some of the top minds out there, just the last 24 hours,
[04:38.280 --> 04:44.480]  face to face, I'm not going to get any names or anything, that's why I'm here in Los Angeles,
[04:44.480 --> 04:49.280]  and I've got a real consensus from some of the top brains on the planet, again that will
[04:49.280 --> 04:54.560]  all be off record, but it's, the different scenarios run from bad to worse, we'll be
[04:54.560 --> 05:23.560]  laying it all out here today, MFullWars.com, tomorrow's news.
[05:23.560 --> 05:48.880]  Thank you.
[05:48.880 --> 05:55.920]  360 win is it funds the operation. I need funds to run the operation. You need to be healthy. We need to stay on air
[05:55.920 --> 05:57.920]  It's a match made in heaven
[06:05.640 --> 06:10.760]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[06:10.760 --> 06:23.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live March 15th
[06:24.480 --> 06:32.680]  2022 global transmission. I have not ducked out of Austin the last few days for a vacation. I
[06:34.400 --> 06:36.400]  Am here in Los Angeles, California
[06:36.400 --> 06:41.560]  Talking to quite a few very interesting and important folks
[06:41.560 --> 06:46.880]  And I've had a chance to talk to who I consider some of the sharpest minds in the world
[06:47.680 --> 06:51.720]  In the last way for hours in really lengthy summit meetings
[06:52.400 --> 06:54.400]  I would call it to try to brainstorm
[06:55.040 --> 06:59.160]  How to avert situation in Russia. This has got a lot of serious people
[07:00.160 --> 07:01.720]  strongly considering
[07:01.720 --> 07:03.560]  Decamping and
[07:03.560 --> 07:05.560]  evacuating to the southern hemisphere
[07:06.200 --> 07:08.760]  So a lot of people have already done that
[07:09.120 --> 07:14.680]  So when I tell you that some of the most powerful people in the world have been doing that that is not something I read the newspaper though
[07:14.680 --> 07:16.440]  I told you about
[07:16.440 --> 07:21.920]  Redoubts being built before I read the news now they admit it. I'm telling you currently there is a
[07:24.800 --> 07:29.880]  Major debate going on all the world by the intelligentsia both in government and in corporations
[07:29.880 --> 07:36.400]  About what the next moves need to be and there's a real sense that since the Cuban missile crisis
[07:36.400 --> 07:38.000]  We've not been in this much danger
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.080]  And we're in more days now as the weapons are much more prolific and much more sophisticated and much more harder to stop
[07:43.680 --> 07:47.880]  And I would say we have worse leadership now. We said what you want about John F Kennedy
[07:47.880 --> 07:54.080]  He was smart and he did a lot of research and had a good team around him Kamala Harris and Joe Biden
[07:54.080 --> 07:56.080]  Do not know what damn planet they are on
[07:56.560 --> 07:58.160]  and so
[07:58.160 --> 08:03.520]  When I get back to Austin tomorrow, I would have to write some notes really collect this and they really come to my
[08:03.640 --> 08:08.440]  Decisions about what's what we need to do what we stand for in Ukraine and where this is all going
[08:08.440 --> 08:10.440]  But I think the bottom line is we need to de-escalate
[08:10.680 --> 08:12.680]  Give Putin a way out
[08:14.600 --> 08:20.400]  Space-saving so that the Russians government will assassinating was that's what the Russians do the leader fails
[08:21.440 --> 08:26.160]  And where they don't keep escalating the war where NATO gets drawn in
[08:26.160 --> 08:28.560]  Because some of the Ukrainians or others
[08:29.200 --> 08:30.320]  the
[08:30.320 --> 08:36.840]  Thorosites might stage a chemical or biological false flag and say the Russians have done it in fact
[08:36.840 --> 08:41.880]  They've been pre-programming that for the last three weeks and now they're saying the Russians are going to imminently
[08:41.880 --> 08:47.400]  You see all the news. They'll need me to tell you this launch a chemical or biological attack
[08:48.200 --> 08:55.040]  Well, that would be the pretext for so the maniacs the darker forces of the globalist pantheon
[08:55.040 --> 08:57.920]  To get this big wider war
[08:57.920 --> 09:03.160]  they want and the basic knockout a lot of civilization and then use that to bring in the global
[09:03.320 --> 09:10.080]  Technocracy and tyranny and robots on the back of that. So first they're softening up the infrastructure setting down the grids
[09:11.600 --> 09:15.360]  starving the third world annihilating the supply chain
[09:17.000 --> 09:23.740]  Introducing the idea of an ID to buy and sell a global social credit score and then have a limited nuclear war
[09:23.740 --> 09:25.740]  They think they could have
[09:26.140 --> 09:29.100]  Which then brings in so much destabilization. It's the cover
[09:30.300 --> 09:32.300]  For all the billions that are going to die
[09:33.580 --> 09:34.580]  from
[09:34.580 --> 09:43.260]  These MRNA injections which absolutely attack the double helix of the day and absolutely do turn off the regeneration system
[09:44.060 --> 09:46.060]  of humans
[09:46.260 --> 09:52.300]  And so that's where we are. This is a very sophisticated attack and again if I was interdimensional aliens
[09:52.300 --> 09:59.660]  And it destroyed other civilizations that were developing. This is just how I do it that fits in the Bible's cosmology of this fallen one
[09:59.660 --> 10:02.500]  That's ancient and and manipulates humans
[10:03.140 --> 10:09.700]  The only reason I take you there is 99% of this we know what's going on that last one percent of what's happening doesn't make sense
[10:10.540 --> 10:14.580]  Why why would the globalists want to do this? Why would they want to kill billions people?
[10:14.580 --> 10:21.340]  Why would they want to knock much the planet back to the Stone Age and only have compartmentalized high technology reservations?
[10:21.340 --> 10:23.340]  for themselves in the future and
[10:24.180 --> 10:29.380]  They say it's basically as soon as they think they've got life extension. They're gonna start killing the jury of the public
[10:30.300 --> 10:37.060]  But they again understand they can't get away with that it was dramatic and open like a vaccine you take you die right away
[10:37.060 --> 10:40.140]  Nobody would take it if it kills you slowly then they think they can do it
[10:40.540 --> 10:46.260]  But then that's not enough you need something to really destabilize and collapse civilization. So they talk about
[10:46.260 --> 10:50.060]  Depopulation by the year 2030 and
[10:50.620 --> 10:57.100]  William Shatner says I've met with the top people everyone's about to die the cataclysm here a few months ago when you see
[10:57.540 --> 11:03.860]  Beto O'Rourke and you see AOC all saying the same thing too bad will all be dead in 2030
[11:04.700 --> 11:09.980]  It's coming. We're all dead. They're not being read into the whole program. They're being told. Hey, this is coming
[11:09.980 --> 11:15.780]  You better get in line with us if you're gonna survive in bunkers all the globalists that execute a plan that brings us into collapse
[11:15.780 --> 11:17.780]  So here is Secretary General
[11:18.220 --> 11:20.220]  of the United Nations
[11:20.740 --> 11:27.140]  Antonio Gutierrez talking about the fact this is bone-chilling and we just got a lot closer to nuclear war
[11:28.100 --> 11:32.660]  Finally further escalation of the war whether by accident or design
[11:33.700 --> 11:35.700]  threatens all of humanity
[11:36.340 --> 11:40.620]  Raising the alert of Russian nuclear forces is a bone-chilling development
[11:40.620 --> 11:47.940]  The prospect of nuclear conflict once unthinkable is now back within the realm of possibility
[11:49.060 --> 11:53.780]  The security and safety of nuclear facilities must also be preserved
[11:54.540 --> 12:01.220]  It's time to stop the order unleashed on the people of Ukraine and get on the pass of diplomacy and peace
[12:03.900 --> 12:05.900]  So let's let's talk about this
[12:05.900 --> 12:11.820]  They're absolutely right. The time is to talk about deals. The time is to talk about an armistice
[12:12.020 --> 12:16.480]  The time is to talk about just like we did with the end of the Korean War or the ceasefire
[12:16.780 --> 12:22.760]  Have a demilitarized zone that's in that eastern area and the Russians want there's always been part of Russia and in this now
[12:23.500 --> 12:31.460]  NATO started this. I'm not glad about Russia's response. The point is is that Russia's been manipulated into this who now knows he's been trapped
[12:31.460 --> 12:36.580]  And there are some smarter roots and forces that understand this is too dangerous
[12:36.580 --> 12:41.540]  There are other global forces as I said I'm going to push this in total war then meanwhile
[12:42.660 --> 12:46.300]  Meanwhile, Halsey Gabbard and myself and people like Tucker Carlson
[12:47.020 --> 12:51.180]  Are going look here's the bio labs that have the equivalent of bio weapons in them
[12:51.180 --> 12:55.940]  And here's the UN admitting that they need to be destroyed and these are left over from the Soviet Union
[12:55.940 --> 12:57.940]  But the updated Peter Dazik
[12:57.940 --> 13:01.460]  As usual is involved and he's Ukrainian
[13:02.140 --> 13:07.180]  And all of this is happening and we need to get rid of these and it said they go Mitt Romney says no
[13:07.540 --> 13:14.540]  Arrest Halsey Gabbard's I mean the view CNN all of them a BC they're saying arrest her. She's a terrorist
[13:14.540 --> 13:21.700]  She's a traitor. She's all these horrible names because she's an army veteran and knows about chemical and biological weapons
[13:21.700 --> 13:27.380]  And it's publicly admitted that these things are there, but the media said they weren't there
[13:27.380 --> 13:30.540]  So at the same time they're saying, okay, the labs are safe. We got them
[13:30.540 --> 13:34.980]  But the Russians got two of the 25 so now we need to stop them from releasing a bio weapon
[13:34.980 --> 13:41.020]  But the bio weapons don't exist Tucker Carlson last night. I watched this morning. It's just like this isn't even about Russia
[13:41.020 --> 13:46.260]  It's even about Ukraine. This is about insanity. It's like saying Alex Jones is not wearing a black shirt
[13:46.260 --> 13:50.100]  And I'm wearing a black shirt on TV or Alex Jones is not holding a cup of coffee to see it
[13:50.100 --> 13:51.860]  And I've got the cup right here
[13:51.860 --> 13:57.940]  Or I'll show it's not holding an iPhone is here or I'll show it's not have a black microphone in front of me and I do have a
[13:57.940 --> 13:59.660]  Black microphone for me folks
[13:59.660 --> 14:03.100]  So, you know, this is not a bag of sugar in my hands. Well, yes, it is
[14:03.740 --> 14:11.340]  So so this is the frustration here is that they're just gaslighting everybody like not just oh Tulsi Gabbard's is a liar
[14:12.100 --> 14:14.100]  But the Tulsi Gabbard's
[14:14.260 --> 14:18.820]  Is it is a traitor because she had going well of course there's labs
[14:18.820 --> 14:22.020]  Because they want that double think of two plus two equals whatever they say
[14:22.300 --> 14:25.020]  So we're gonna go to break here and I'm gonna come back and play some of these clips
[14:25.020 --> 14:30.100]  Oh, it has got a lot to cover as well today. Oh and take a sound and tell us some of what you got coming up today
[14:30.660 --> 14:36.060]  Well, Alex the news is breaking in such rapid fashion now just since we've been on air
[14:36.780 --> 14:38.780]  two big news stories developing
[14:39.260 --> 14:45.620]  With the failed attempt by Jake Sullivan to get diplomacy with China and Saudi Arabia
[14:45.620 --> 14:51.180]  Now China and Saudi Arabia are discussing switching to the Yuan to make international purchases
[14:51.180 --> 14:53.580]  Specifically with gas and oil instead of the US dollar
[14:53.580 --> 15:00.780]  I mean you want to talk about the US collapsing folks our lifestyle of prosperity and having a house with two stories and a pool in
[15:00.780 --> 15:07.940]  The backyard and having barbecues on the weekend gone if that happens forget about it and now Zelensky has come out and said
[15:09.140 --> 15:14.340]  Ukraine has no plans to join NATO so the Cogs are starting to click here and
[15:14.340 --> 15:16.940]  It looks like for the most part
[15:17.340 --> 15:21.740]  The West with Biden and Harris are the ones kind of being pushed back into submission
[15:21.900 --> 15:25.780]  And now the struggle with Putin and Ukraine is gonna become the real issue
[15:25.900 --> 15:32.740]  But it but it appears that the latest developments are that Biden Harris sit down shut up or America's gonna be crushed in all of this
[15:33.980 --> 15:37.180]  That is exactly what's happening and in fact I wanted to get into that
[15:37.180 --> 15:38.660]  I'm glad you just brought that up
[15:38.660 --> 15:46.500]  We'll cover that when we come back because even on the Guardian points out these oil sanctions on Europe will bankrupt them and cause a great
[15:46.500 --> 15:48.940]  Depression already are it's not hurting the Russians
[15:48.940 --> 15:52.060]  They'll just make more money where they do sell the oil and then again
[15:52.060 --> 15:56.820]  There's darker globalist forces manipulating this whole thing to collapse civilization. It's the info
[15:57.500 --> 16:00.780]  It's hard to believe that we're already in to March
[16:01.980 --> 16:07.380]  2022 and in the month of February we had a very popular sale that was going of our
[16:07.380 --> 16:14.300]  Flagship product the X3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every
[16:14.580 --> 16:16.020]  electrochemical
[16:16.020 --> 16:20.620]  Cellular activity in your body your immune system your stamina your libido
[16:21.020 --> 16:27.340]  So much and the majority of the population the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine out there
[16:27.340 --> 16:33.420]  So we had on sell 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have or is it gonna come in for a long time?
[16:33.420 --> 16:39.340]  So I took it back to full process. I was thinking you know what we need the funds in now to stay on air
[16:39.500 --> 16:46.100]  Plus this is a great product everybody needs so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience
[16:46.100 --> 16:53.860]  Of yourself and support the broadcast. I'm gonna keep it at 50% off until it sells out get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com
[16:54.460 --> 16:56.460]  For 50% off
[16:56.460 --> 17:04.780]  It has been noted by many a historian the first casualty of war is the truth and the next big casualty
[17:05.140 --> 17:07.140]  Isn't even the people that die
[17:07.740 --> 17:09.740]  No, that invariably follows
[17:09.820 --> 17:12.300]  but first there is the crackdown on
[17:13.140 --> 17:21.020]  populations basic liberty and speech and massive censorship and now across the world from the United States to Europe
[17:22.100 --> 17:24.900]  Legislations being introduced that if you
[17:24.900 --> 17:26.900]  Amplify
[17:27.540 --> 17:29.540]  Equal pro-russian
[17:29.860 --> 17:31.860]  Information you can be censored
[17:32.340 --> 17:37.300]  You can be arrested you can be a prisoner and of course now Canada's under this legislation
[17:38.020 --> 17:43.460]  That if you have a fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage
[17:43.740 --> 17:47.300]  In hate speech online that you will be censored and arrested
[17:48.060 --> 17:52.620]  Ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalist around the world
[17:52.620 --> 17:56.180]  Against humanity that makes them forwards.com more important than ever
[17:57.180 --> 18:02.260]  the globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID
[18:02.740 --> 18:04.340]  biomedical tyranny
[18:04.340 --> 18:10.100]  Lockdowns until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext
[18:10.740 --> 18:13.340]  Permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[18:13.900 --> 18:16.380]  Anybody that speaks out against their lives
[18:16.380 --> 18:22.940]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers
[18:23.380 --> 18:30.420]  Now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[18:30.420 --> 18:34.740]  Corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever
[18:35.060 --> 18:40.540]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover like Canada
[18:40.540 --> 18:48.580]  They've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia
[18:48.580 --> 18:56.300]  So pray for these folks big-time. It's a very serious situation and stay tuned into info wars comm because truth is absolutely paramount
[18:59.140 --> 19:03.340]  If you only knew the power of the dark side
[19:04.300 --> 19:07.140]  Join Bill Gates and together
[19:07.140 --> 19:10.180]  We will defeat humanity
[19:11.100 --> 19:15.820]  Then our God save the reward us with eternal life
[19:17.100 --> 19:20.380]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists
[19:21.660 --> 19:29.300]  They must first play God. They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system
[19:29.300 --> 19:34.380]  And in a way, they're right if we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us
[19:34.380 --> 19:39.380]  Destroy our children's futures. The evidence is overwhelming and out in the open. We really
[19:39.980 --> 19:41.980]  Deserve what's happened to us
[19:42.300 --> 19:44.300]  So I asked you now
[19:44.300 --> 19:52.020]  Are you going to step up and expose the new order even more? I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts
[19:52.420 --> 19:55.980]  The front lines the fight is info wars.com
[19:55.980 --> 20:04.260]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones
[20:17.420 --> 20:21.580]  Ladies and gentlemen again, we are back live on this Tuesday March 15
[20:21.580 --> 20:25.340]  2022 transmission of Troyer's riding shotgun with me
[20:25.340 --> 20:29.780]  I'll be here with you most of the hour that I will be fully taking over here today
[20:29.780 --> 20:31.780]  but going back to what you just said oh and
[20:32.420 --> 20:36.300]  Absolutely that news was just breaking as we went live. That is huge
[20:36.820 --> 20:41.020]  We have Saudi Arabia saying they may just go ahead and take Chinese money
[20:42.180 --> 20:44.700]  Instead of taking the dollar and to explain this
[20:44.700 --> 20:52.020]  If you go back to Bretman's at the World War two where it was decided that the dollar would be the world reserve currency that the purchase of
[20:52.020 --> 21:00.140]  Oil would be made in around the world if the US loses that and in China the second largest oil user in the world
[21:01.700 --> 21:07.260]  Stops using dollars that means the beginning of the end of the dollar 90% of world
[21:08.340 --> 21:12.060]  Money transfer and oil transfers just 20 years ago was the dollar
[21:12.060 --> 21:21.260]  It's only 62% last time I checked last week now and that will accelerate it once you get 50% people will basically leave the dollar
[21:22.420 --> 21:29.940]  No one has devalued their currency over the long period as bad as we have and ever had their currency survive
[21:29.940 --> 21:31.940]  But China's been
[21:32.300 --> 21:38.820]  Evaluating as well even faster than us but for not as long the EU's been doing it faster than us but not as long
[21:38.820 --> 21:44.820]  So again, we've been doing it for a long time, you know a dollar a hundred years ago would buy you a lavish meal and
[21:45.460 --> 21:53.220]  You know horse carriage ride back home, and you know probably a love for breath local store now as it gets you so
[21:53.900 --> 21:56.180]  We all see what's going on and happening here
[21:56.180 --> 22:02.940]  And they want a global reset all the central banks say the new global digital systems coming and it'll be a mix of all the currencies
[22:02.940 --> 22:06.580]  They've got to have an excuse to plunge it first and learn I say three weeks ago
[22:06.580 --> 22:14.100]  I said this war if they put big sanctions on Russia and then on China will lead to leaving the dollar China and Russia are
[22:15.380 --> 22:17.380]  Obviously double dealings international level
[22:18.140 --> 22:20.140]  the debauched group only under pressure
[22:20.700 --> 22:22.300]  decoupled from
[22:22.300 --> 22:27.540]  Putin they have it from Xi Jinping and so China is the long-term big winner out of this
[22:27.660 --> 22:32.620]  China is the beta test for the police state that 37 million people back under lockdown
[22:33.220 --> 22:35.740]  in China as just a martial law drill
[22:35.740 --> 22:40.700]  Well, we're here in LA and some of the crew when I was at meetings trying to go to the comedy store
[22:40.700 --> 22:45.540]  And they said no vaccine that you can't come in even though it's not the law happened a bunch of other places
[22:45.820 --> 22:49.260]  So, you know, there's that tyranny over arching
[22:49.540 --> 22:55.900]  But Putin is running into a lot more opposition than they thought there's massive western special forces there
[22:56.340 --> 22:58.180]  British special forces
[22:58.180 --> 23:04.580]  well recently out of the military just got killed a couple hundred foreign soldiers got
[23:04.580 --> 23:11.060]  Wounded when 30 got killed just in one barracks that they set for an international
[23:12.340 --> 23:15.980]  Soldier in who's really a Russian spy. He just called in
[23:16.740 --> 23:18.020]  rocket attacks
[23:18.020 --> 23:26.900]  On to the the facility. So this is a sh dash t-show at every level and only can get worse. It's Ron Paul rope
[23:27.420 --> 23:28.700]  just
[23:28.700 --> 23:36.460]  Few days ago in a big article. We had it in four words.com. Is the is the United States by administration willing to fight Putin to the last
[23:36.780 --> 23:39.260]  Ukrainian because really that's what this is
[23:40.100 --> 23:46.700]  Putin the globalist over through their government over through the Ukrainian elected government started all these fights put in the troops
[23:46.700 --> 23:50.940]  Put in the weapons to set up Russia. So that's bad Russia taking the bait is bad
[23:50.940 --> 23:56.540]  And now Russia beginning to lose his back is they're not going to give up and it's just going to escalate from there
[23:56.540 --> 24:00.940]  So I've basically gone over that even again as I said the one in Guardian you can look this up today
[24:01.580 --> 24:03.100]  Says that
[24:03.100 --> 24:08.980]  Basically, there'll be a depression and the Germans will go bankrupt in a year at current rates of energy prices
[24:09.620 --> 24:14.900]  Because the left thinks or tells people. Oh, don't worry of gases $10 a gallon like it is
[24:15.980 --> 24:19.540]  $9 a gallon in Chicago $7 a gallon in most areas, California
[24:19.780 --> 24:21.820]  Don't worry because you'll just use electric
[24:21.820 --> 24:26.780]  Well, electric almost all comes from coal and natural gas less than 10% from
[24:28.220 --> 24:36.380]  Turbines and of course hydroelectric hydroelectric is the best but the last been destroying hydroelectric everywhere
[24:37.420 --> 24:40.300]  And tearing out and not updating them because oh they hurt fish
[24:40.780 --> 24:46.460]  Just lie after lie after lie after lie so and I've got some important clips
[24:47.100 --> 24:49.100]  dealing really with the police state
[24:49.100 --> 24:53.100]  Now unfolding when we come back, but I wanted you to get more into all those news stories
[24:53.100 --> 24:55.580]  You've got the time to this and get your angle on it
[24:55.580 --> 25:00.700]  But to say Tucker Carlson is guilty of treason to have a US senator say that
[25:01.420 --> 25:05.580]  Tulsi Gabbard's is is a hundred times worse than what
[25:06.140 --> 25:08.140]  people like of course
[25:08.860 --> 25:11.660]  McCarthy did I mean this is so dangerous
[25:12.300 --> 25:15.420]  And now they're censoring anybody that even shows the Russian perspective
[25:15.420 --> 25:21.580]  I mean they're calling for us to be censored even though I'm just trying to have peace and trying to really just talk about all the different issues
[25:21.580 --> 25:22.940]  Of what this is really doing
[25:22.940 --> 25:28.700]  I'm pro-america a hundred percent the people that drove this war and started this are the ones that are about to kill the dollar
[25:29.020 --> 25:32.940]  And destroy our senator living which is now already happening. You know, I told people two years ago
[25:32.940 --> 25:35.980]  You better get horrible food the lockdowns are going to go on and off forever
[25:36.300 --> 25:40.860]  They're going to try to shut down, you know family farms. You better get your horrible food. It's going to run out
[25:41.580 --> 25:43.580]  My patriot has not been a month behind
[25:43.580 --> 25:49.740]  In their history. They've got the biggest company in the u.s. The best they are now a few weeks behind
[25:50.220 --> 25:55.020]  And they're telling people that uh, but they told us. Yeah, don't even really plug
[25:55.580 --> 26:01.660]  Um, I mean we because we're just so far behind they'd rather be able to catch up and not be like other food companies
[26:01.820 --> 26:05.740]  That are always a few months behind. Well, they're already a few weeks behind in preparadox.com
[26:06.220 --> 26:10.700]  Everybody got their orders in you know, a month or so ago was really smart because now it's gotten right to you
[26:10.700 --> 26:16.540]  Uh, so this is very serious folks. The supply chains are breaking down. This is by design
[26:16.860 --> 26:20.780]  Cloud Schwab said they would do it. I'm not I'm not just blaming them now
[26:21.580 --> 26:26.300]  Because I don't like them. They said post industrial world. You will own nothing. You will have nothing. You will like it
[26:26.460 --> 26:28.780]  This is how they break our back. It's how they get control of us
[26:28.780 --> 26:34.140]  So everybody this spring should be even if you live in apartments or whatever going up getting seeds planting tomatoes
[26:34.140 --> 26:39.100]  Planning potatoes planning beans planning brussel sprouts planning eggplant. We my parents
[26:39.100 --> 26:41.100]  have a garden
[26:41.660 --> 26:43.660]  That is a half acre
[26:44.780 --> 26:47.660]  That just in south austin so many brussel sprouts
[26:48.140 --> 26:50.940]  So many peppers hot peppers sweet peppers
[26:51.500 --> 26:56.300]  Uh, so many corn sometimes they grow that I mean just everything tomatoes
[26:56.780 --> 27:00.300]  And whenever I go there to eat they're always just getting it out of their yard
[27:00.860 --> 27:05.900]  And and and that's what we've got to start understanding is the globalist want to take away the prosperity
[27:05.900 --> 27:10.300]  They want to have an excuse to do it while they pose the savers. So if we point out they started the war
[27:10.540 --> 27:16.780]  There's a group above it hurting america and russia and ukraine if we point out the 360 full spectrum dominant system
[27:17.260 --> 27:23.260]  Then we can all think like a globalist but from the perspective of knowing how they're operating and stopping them
[27:23.580 --> 27:25.900]  So this is life and death to understand the sound of your death
[27:26.460 --> 27:31.820]  On that our senator living has already slipped massively. We're more in depth than ever and we're going over the edge right now
[27:31.820 --> 27:35.740]  Well, and that's the whole operating system of the great reset
[27:35.820 --> 27:41.660]  It's to take things that we in the west have quite frankly taken for granted in the last couple generations
[27:42.300 --> 27:47.180]  Staples having the ability to put gas in your vehicle and travel wherever you want whenever you want
[27:47.420 --> 27:54.380]  Having the ability to own a piece of land or have a house that you own and and maybe a nice barbecue pit or a pool in the backyard
[27:54.380 --> 27:57.740]  Or having a school to send your kids to or having a fridge full of food
[27:57.740 --> 28:04.780]  Maybe even having an extra fridge in the garage all these things that have been staples and accessible for americans in the past decades
[28:05.100 --> 28:11.820]  All that's going to go away and that's really what the great reset is about but getting back to the shifting back to ukraine alex
[28:12.540 --> 28:19.260]  You know zalinsky. I think is kind of in his final final moments here. He's going to be addressing congress tomorrow morning
[28:19.740 --> 28:25.580]  Um, I believe at 8 a.m. Central time 9 a.m. Eastern. It's probably going to be kind of his final plea
[28:25.580 --> 28:29.660]  I think he realized that he's stepped into it here. He double crossed putin
[28:30.220 --> 28:34.860]  And made a deal with the globalist and now they've stabbed him in the back and even germany is saying no
[28:34.860 --> 28:40.380]  We're not going to sanction russia. So it's it's really just a mess and I think world leaders are now saying all right
[28:40.380 --> 28:44.380]  You know what? It's why the u.n. Is saying you know what? We don't want nuclear war. Let's step back
[28:44.620 --> 28:49.980]  I think putin's going to have a victory in ukraine or it's going to be all out war and they'll either try to
[28:49.980 --> 28:56.700]  Assassinate him or they'll nuke ukraine or do a cyber attack or chemical attack and blame putin to set up for a larger escalation
[28:57.820 --> 29:00.860]  It's hard to believe that we're already into march
[29:01.580 --> 29:04.300]  2022 and in the month of february
[29:04.300 --> 29:09.260]  We had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product x3
[29:09.740 --> 29:15.580]  That has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical
[29:15.580 --> 29:20.780]  Cellular activity in your body your immune system your stamina your libido
[29:21.260 --> 29:26.940]  So much and the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine

[31:08.940 --> 31:10.460]  Before I start out on a run
[31:10.540 --> 31:17.100]  I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going you know besides the energy turbo force
[31:17.580 --> 31:22.860]  It is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin c to keep me healthy and the essential b vitamins

[31:44.060 --> 31:48.460]  So I can get back to the training even if you are not crazy enough to take on a marathon
[31:48.780 --> 31:53.420]  Good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day
[31:53.740 --> 31:56.700]  And sore less can keep you moving and feeling great at any age
[31:56.700 --> 32:04.700]  U.N. run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from australia to the united states from canada to germany
[32:04.780 --> 32:10.860]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[32:11.100 --> 32:17.820]  Taking people away into the night to their facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their
[32:18.140 --> 32:23.580]  Shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety
[32:23.580 --> 32:27.260]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back
[32:27.500 --> 32:32.540]  Is to get high quality faraday cages many of which are made here in america and are very compliant
[32:32.700 --> 32:36.700]  Meaning u.s. Government military grade at info war store dot com

[33:51.260 --> 33:54.860]  We're trying to break down the latest news out of ukraine, but it's developing so quickly alex
[33:55.420 --> 33:57.420]  I have a feeling though
[33:57.420 --> 34:01.980]  We're gonna have a lot clearer picture of what this is going to look like after this week and weekend
[34:02.380 --> 34:07.340]  Because something's going to have to give either russia is going to step up their attacks in ukraine
[34:07.340 --> 34:13.980]  Or the world is going to basically put america into a corner to say back off and then they'll just have their way
[34:14.700 --> 34:20.860]  With the eu and or nato and russia and ukraine figuring it out, but you know what what i'm seeing alex is
[34:22.620 --> 34:26.780]  With zolensky coming to congress with all the propaganda in the media
[34:27.260 --> 34:31.340]  With china saudi arabia talking about using the uan instead of the dollar
[34:31.340 --> 34:36.700]  And now they're saying oh look china's economy is crashing and oh look russia's economy is crashing
[34:37.340 --> 34:39.900]  The world elites have intentionally done this to the planet
[34:40.300 --> 34:46.140]  Now they're trying to find their easiest way out and it's going to be the people the just common citizen of this planet
[34:46.140 --> 34:49.340]  That's going to pay the toll. That's what we want to avoid here
[34:50.940 --> 34:54.300]  Well very well said oh and that's exactly what's going on and so
[34:55.020 --> 35:00.060]  People need to understand i'm not being neutral on this because i want to be on everybody's side
[35:00.060 --> 35:02.860]  It's the opposite our listeners in general
[35:04.220 --> 35:10.300]  Hate the democratic party hate the globalist hate george soros and they should and they are pro-putin because they see it as
[35:10.700 --> 35:15.100]  Well, you know, he hates the globalist too. He's under globalist attacks that he must be good
[35:16.220 --> 35:19.020]  All i'm saying is is that he's walked into a trap
[35:19.660 --> 35:23.740]  And the globalist wanted him to do this and now it's driven russia into china's arms
[35:24.060 --> 35:28.620]  And china's now saying they are going to ship weapons to the russians including weaponized drones
[35:28.620 --> 35:32.380]  Uh, and i'm talking about the big ones like you knock off some of our predators
[35:33.420 --> 35:35.900]  so all of this is going on and
[35:37.260 --> 35:40.620]  The globalists have bitten off a little bit more than they could chew they wanted to
[35:41.100 --> 35:44.940]  Push russia around they wanted to be able to take over they figured they would put russia in a trap
[35:45.660 --> 35:47.660]  But now it's accelerating
[35:47.740 --> 35:49.740]  The collapse of the dollar so fast
[35:50.140 --> 35:55.660]  That there are a lot of different powerful forces that now want what a resolution of this
[35:55.660 --> 36:00.860]  But there are a lot of globalist forces that wanted to continue to get worse and make no mistake
[36:00.940 --> 36:04.540]  A lot of those globalist forces are in russia. You notice that all these oligarchs
[36:04.860 --> 36:11.180]  I think it's 14 of them 14 of the 30 or so oligarchs are russian jews
[36:12.060 --> 36:14.060]  And it's being reported
[36:14.060 --> 36:17.500]  There's an article on info wars.com about it that they have fled
[36:18.220 --> 36:20.300]  To israel and it's in mainstream news
[36:21.100 --> 36:22.620]  that
[36:22.620 --> 36:29.020]  So they can get around the sanctions they have now suddenly said. Oh, no, actually. We've got israeli passports and now the israeli government
[36:29.500 --> 36:31.260]  And others have come out and said
[36:31.260 --> 36:36.620]  Basically, it's anti-semitic if you put sanctions on them. So the reason I raise that point is
[36:37.500 --> 36:41.820]  To just show how it's all interconnected. There's rough. There's american connections to russia
[36:41.900 --> 36:45.340]  There's russian connections to ukraine russian connections to israel
[36:45.820 --> 36:47.340]  And it's it
[36:47.340 --> 36:53.660]  And it's it's like russia's like america in that it's got its democrats and it's got its conservatives and it's got
[36:54.060 --> 36:56.300]  You know all these different factions and groups as well
[36:56.380 --> 37:00.140]  It's not like to russia that we think of a back installment time or something
[37:00.620 --> 37:03.100]  Uh, and so puke really doesn't even have full control
[37:04.220 --> 37:08.780]  Shown by him launching this war and it's not going the way he thought. You know, these governments are
[37:09.820 --> 37:12.780]  Incomplete the world's so big. It's so complex
[37:12.780 --> 37:19.020]  Uh, is the u.s. government more incompetent than russia? Yes. Is our military a lot more competent than russia?
[37:19.020 --> 37:24.860]  Yeah, because the u.s. Military is going all the time and has super high-tech systems of coordination
[37:25.260 --> 37:28.540]  And the russians don't have that the chinese have more of that than the russians
[37:28.860 --> 37:31.100]  And now that the chinese are coming into the proxy war
[37:31.740 --> 37:33.180]  That's why you're seeing the u.n
[37:33.660 --> 37:40.780]  And and and they come on. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa because they dumped a thousand drones in there with their equivalent of hellfires
[37:40.780 --> 37:47.020]  That the u.s. Is allowed to be a transfer of that technology. It's going to get a lot more serious a lot quicker, but
[37:48.460 --> 37:53.980]  A larger takeaway is just the fact that everything we see the russian government doing censoring people
[37:54.220 --> 37:58.540]  They're now starting to do here and when you've got a military veteran in a former member of congress
[37:58.780 --> 38:02.220]  Who's has the most popular polling numbers of any democrat?
[38:02.540 --> 38:08.700]  Tulsi gabber's just going. Yeah, these these chemical labs these bio labs are important and we need them shut down
[38:08.700 --> 38:16.220]  The u.n. Even said that they're like you're crazy. They don't exist when they're on record existing. That's a big problem. So let's play
[38:17.020 --> 38:19.020]  Let's play this clip. Let's play tulsi
[38:20.060 --> 38:21.660]  Gabbers responds
[38:21.660 --> 38:28.700]  And then we'll play, uh, you know tucker making the point that you know, they're treating tulsi gabbers like she's alex shones because alex shones questions things
[38:29.420 --> 38:31.900]  As well. So let's just let let's play tulsi
[38:32.700 --> 38:37.340]  In her responses. Let's play the the tucker gabber to jones clip right after that
[38:37.340 --> 38:39.340]  Senator romney
[38:39.980 --> 38:44.380]  You've called me a treasonous liar simply for stating the fact that there are over
[38:45.020 --> 38:51.500]  25 u.s. funded bio labs in ukraine, which if breached would release and spread deadly pathogens
[38:51.980 --> 38:58.700]  Across the united states and the world and therefore they must be secured so that we can prevent any new pandemics from occurring
[38:59.740 --> 39:01.180]  Now bizarrely
[39:01.180 --> 39:07.820]  You claim that securing these labs or even calling for securing these labs is treasonous and will lead to a loss of life
[39:08.540 --> 39:14.460]  When the exact opposite is obviously true the spread of pathogens is what will cause the loss of life
[39:15.100 --> 39:17.260]  Not the prevention of such a spread
[39:18.700 --> 39:24.220]  So senator romney, please provide evidence that what i've said is not true and treasonous
[39:24.220 --> 39:31.100]  And if you cannot you should do the honorable thing apologize resign from the u.s. Senate
[39:32.540 --> 39:39.500]  Evidence of the existence of these bio labs in ukraine their vulnerability and therefore the need to take immediate action to secure them
[39:39.900 --> 39:41.900]  is beyond dispute
[39:42.060 --> 39:51.180]  Just the other day the state departments victoria newland acknowledged that these labs that contain dangerous pathogens exist in ukraine in her testimony to the u.s. Senate
[39:51.180 --> 39:53.260]  ukraine has a
[39:54.940 --> 39:57.980]  Biological research facilities
[39:58.780 --> 40:03.900]  Which in fact we are now quite concerned russian troops russian forces
[40:04.540 --> 40:06.540]  May be seeking to
[40:07.340 --> 40:11.980]  Gain control of so we are working with the ukrainians on how they can
[40:12.780 --> 40:17.980]  Prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of
[40:17.980 --> 40:23.900]  Russian forces should they approach in a pentagon fact sheet dated march 11th
[40:23.900 --> 40:29.980]  There are numerous statements that both directly and indirectly confirm the existence of these bio labs
[40:31.100 --> 40:37.900]  The united states through btrp has invested approximately 200 million dollars in ukraine since 2005
[40:38.460 --> 40:44.060]  supporting 46 ukrainian laboratories health facilities and diagnostic sites
[40:44.060 --> 40:48.700]  On cbs face the nation on march 13th cbs national security correspondent
[40:48.700 --> 40:53.340]  David martin said that he'd spoken to a pentagon official just that morning who told him
[40:53.820 --> 40:57.500]  They're concerned about the existence of these bio labs in ukraine
[40:58.060 --> 41:01.980]  The concern is that the russians will seize one of these
[41:02.460 --> 41:07.340]  Biomedical research facilities that ukraine has where they do research on
[41:08.140 --> 41:10.140]  deadly pathogens like
[41:10.220 --> 41:12.220]  botulism and
[41:12.220 --> 41:14.220]  and anthrax
[41:14.220 --> 41:16.220]  Sees one of those facilities
[41:16.460 --> 41:22.060]  Weaponized the pathogen and then blame it on ukraine and the u.s. Because the u.s.
[41:22.540 --> 41:27.740]  Has been providing support for some of the research being done in those facilities
[41:28.620 --> 41:33.580]  Now in april of 2020 in refuting russia's accusations that the u.s.
[41:33.580 --> 41:36.940]  Was using bio labs in ukraine to develop biological weapons
[41:36.940 --> 41:42.540]  The u.s. Embassy in ukraine acknowledged that there are u.s. Funded labs in ukraine
[41:43.100 --> 41:46.540]  working with pathogens for vaccines and other peaceful purposes
[41:47.660 --> 41:51.180]  In a cnn fact check on march 10th 2022
[41:51.900 --> 41:55.980]  There are u.s. Funded bio labs in ukraine that much is true
[41:56.780 --> 42:01.740]  Furthermore according to the dod. There are two bio labs in ukraine that have been under russian control
[42:02.140 --> 42:04.140]  for quite some time
[42:04.140 --> 42:10.540]  Russia illegally took possession of two ukrainian owned laboratories that btrp upgraded in
[42:11.340 --> 42:15.980]  2014 and continues to deny ukrainian access to these facilities
[42:16.380 --> 42:18.860]  So senator romney you have a choice
[42:19.820 --> 42:26.460]  Out of pride continue to deny the truth or admit that you're wrong apologize and resign
[42:26.460 --> 42:33.580]  Aloha and remember that without the truth we can be neither safe nor free
[42:35.980 --> 42:37.900]  You know you can say what you want about her
[42:38.380 --> 42:43.980]  But I mean she just comes off as like an angel and I know she's went to class law school and I know
[42:44.540 --> 42:48.300]  But I mean she could also turn back towards the light and I judge a tree by its fruits
[42:48.860 --> 42:53.900]  Uh, and you know, she's becoming more pro-life. She's all the way there. She's becoming pro-second amendment
[42:53.900 --> 42:57.260]  Uh, I can tell you the republicans the highest levels are scarier
[42:58.300 --> 43:01.340]  It's hard to believe that we're already into march
[43:02.060 --> 43:04.700]  2022 and in the month of february
[43:04.780 --> 43:09.740]  We had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product x3
[43:10.140 --> 43:14.780]  That has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every
[43:15.580 --> 43:16.700]  electrochemical
[43:16.700 --> 43:21.260]  Cellular activity in your body your immune system your stamina your libido
[43:21.260 --> 43:27.820]  So much and the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine output
[43:27.900 --> 43:31.900]  So we had on sale 50% off that we sold more than half of what we have
[43:32.380 --> 43:37.580]  Or is it going to come in for a long time? So I took it back to full process. I was just thinking, you know what?
[43:37.900 --> 43:42.140]  We need the funds in now to stay on air plus this is the right product everybody needs
[43:42.540 --> 43:48.380]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence get x3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast
[43:48.380 --> 43:56.540]  I'm going to keep it at 50 off until it sells out get x3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50 off
[43:58.060 --> 44:05.740]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food
[44:05.820 --> 44:07.260]  It's all come out
[44:07.260 --> 44:12.220]  And they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and we
[44:12.700 --> 44:16.620]  Are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much
[44:16.620 --> 44:23.180]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy. Is it true?
[44:24.940 --> 44:30.300]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless
[44:30.780 --> 44:36.380]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because
[44:37.180 --> 44:41.980]  They know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world
[44:41.980 --> 44:47.020]  Who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars on the air now more than ever
[44:47.420 --> 44:49.420]  Because even you don't believe in god
[44:49.580 --> 44:56.300]  What the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast
[44:56.300 --> 44:58.060]  They just announced

[47:57.260 --> 48:02.540]  So you can make your own decisions. We really just try to tell you the truth and do our best research and we're best guests on
[48:03.500 --> 48:05.500]  and we have a
[48:05.500 --> 48:11.500]  Really good track record compared to any other media outlet out there of having accuracy and I can tell you
[48:12.380 --> 48:15.020]  But that's recognized by governments and corporations
[48:15.660 --> 48:17.500]  around the world
[48:17.500 --> 48:23.740]  And and so when I tell you that it's it's it's not to toot our horn and so listers and others and also foolish leftists that
[48:24.140 --> 48:27.260]  Just make fun of us and think that that keeps people from the truth or
[48:27.740 --> 48:33.180]  Uh, that that demonizes us. It's just not working. Uh, and praise god their attempts to
[48:34.620 --> 48:38.620]  Shut down any real debate or long-term conversation about the new world war has failed
[48:38.620 --> 48:43.420]  And so now the globalist denying that bio labs exist in ukraine that were us funded
[48:43.420 --> 48:47.660]  It just makes them look like bigger liars. It doesn't work anymore. The gaslighting or denying
[48:47.660 --> 48:52.060]  There's a world government being formed or denying the democrats are trying to sexualize children
[48:52.220 --> 48:53.660]  The governor sannis
[48:53.660 --> 48:58.140]  tries to you know pass a law that you don't teach seven-year-olds how to get blowjobs. I mean, I'm sorry
[48:58.300 --> 49:03.100]  That's what they teach sex and the seven-year-olds. They teach little boys. They're girls and girls are boys
[49:03.900 --> 49:05.900]  And even bill marr said last weekend
[49:06.220 --> 49:09.340]  Uh, he said you shouldn't be targeting children about sex talk
[49:09.340 --> 49:13.340]  Anyway, they're children that's sexualizing children. That's pedophilia
[49:13.980 --> 49:17.260]  and and and I mean the sickening footage that oh and in the crew god
[49:17.900 --> 49:19.900]  this weekend in austin
[49:19.900 --> 49:22.220]  Of people saying we want access to the kids
[49:22.620 --> 49:25.260]  We're going to let them decide what sex they are when they're five years old
[49:25.420 --> 49:29.820]  These are other people adults wanting access to your children in schools and culture
[49:30.220 --> 49:32.700]  To talk about their sexual future and who they are
[49:33.420 --> 49:37.340]  I mean, if somebody's 18 and they want to go be kinky and do much of weird stuff that's their deal
[49:37.340 --> 49:40.060]  But leave the freaking kids alone
[49:41.500 --> 49:48.220]  Hands off the kids. So the left has lost even bill marr get damned scum and I mean, I tell you I've never seen such spilt
[49:48.860 --> 49:51.660]  such weak demonic sacks of garbage
[49:52.380 --> 49:53.580]  as
[49:53.580 --> 49:55.820]  these people that want to sexualize children
[49:56.300 --> 50:00.620]  Uh, these uh, these these these pedophile enablers. I'm not saying they're all pedophiles
[50:01.180 --> 50:03.660]  Uh, but I would imagine if you went and ran the plates
[50:03.660 --> 50:09.660]  Uh of that crowd out there that you would find some really scary stuff and I'm I'm the guy that pioneered
[50:09.660 --> 50:12.700]  I'm not bragging. I just think common sense stuff to go to drag queen story time
[50:13.740 --> 50:15.740]  Have people hire pi's
[50:15.740 --> 50:18.060]  Or off duty. Uh, we've done it ourselves before
[50:18.540 --> 50:23.740]  Uh, and just go around the plates of these people and then uh, oh this person's a convicted rapist of an eight-year-old
[50:23.900 --> 50:25.900]  This guy's a convicted rapist of a six-year-old
[50:25.900 --> 50:34.540]  This guy's a two-time rapist. You know what we call the police and they go grab them and they go back to prison
[50:34.540 --> 50:39.100]  And since we don't see a lot of drag queen story telling more because people go, oh run their damper. Yeah, run
[50:39.660 --> 50:45.740]  Their plates send them to jail. Of course dudes in clown outfits. They want to bounce your five-year-old on their leg
[50:46.300 --> 50:53.500]  Are statistically gonna I mean we said openly run the san francisco gay choirs days because they were going
[50:53.500 --> 50:58.540]  We're gonna meet your children. We'll have them. We'll take them. We're gonna do stuff to them
[50:59.900 --> 51:01.900]  Everybody said run their names and it was like
[51:07.100 --> 51:09.260]  I mean this this is what we're dealing with here, so
[51:10.940 --> 51:17.100]  I mean you talk about this just and then the useful idiots that actually just believe they're fighting for rights and their civil rights activists
[51:18.380 --> 51:20.380]  Because MSNBC called them
[51:20.380 --> 51:25.580]  So the wheels are coming off the new old order their whole system is falling apart and we are in an incredible time in history
[51:25.580 --> 51:29.820]  Let me do this right now before these cliffs and the no one takes over. It does a splendid job

[53:09.980 --> 53:14.700]  Your whole body your thyroid that is 50 percent off today is the last day
[53:15.100 --> 53:20.300]  So take advantage of that. Let's get back to that clip. I mentioned that I'm going to hand the baton over to the great
[53:20.700 --> 53:24.140]  Oh, shroyer. Here is, uh, carlson explaining
[53:25.260 --> 53:29.980]  It's like a 16 minute clip ended out in two and a half minutes that oh my god, tulsi gabberge is evil
[53:29.980 --> 53:36.940]  She's alex jones because she's pointing out real things that are admitted and they're trying to gaslight us and saying it doesn't exist
[53:36.940 --> 53:40.540]  Well separately they go we've got to save these labs from the russians
[53:40.700 --> 53:44.620]  These have deadly bio weapons in them, but we don't have any labs and they don't exist
[53:44.860 --> 53:49.260]  Tulsi gabberge is guilty of treason with a u.s senator saying that no mr
[53:49.900 --> 53:54.780]  No, no mr. Romney, you are the one you warmongering neocon lying fraud
[53:55.180 --> 54:02.620]  You are the enemy of america. You are the one engaged in treason against our first amendment and that all I can say is I pray to god
[54:02.620 --> 54:09.500]  Uh that that mit romney all of these times be exposed. Okay. Here's the clip indeed by mentioning nato
[54:10.380 --> 54:14.700]  A topic that is completely off limits in american media is lens. He may have gone too far
[54:15.820 --> 54:21.900]  Daily in every possible venue. We are told that nato is paradoxically both have been central importance to the united states
[54:22.380 --> 54:24.380]  And at the same time irrelevant
[54:24.860 --> 54:26.860]  To what happens in eastern europe
[54:27.500 --> 54:30.380]  Sound insane. Well, then you can still think clearly
[54:30.380 --> 54:37.020]  Yeah, she hates our country because she's worried that a pathogen might escape from a bio lab
[54:37.580 --> 54:39.580]  and hurt people
[54:39.980 --> 54:45.180]  There's no recent precedent for that. So she's clearly listening to alex jones too much and she's treasonous
[54:45.580 --> 54:50.940]  Actually, everything that tulsi gabberge said as you know is true from a republican issue. It's not a democrat issue
[54:51.020 --> 54:56.300]  It's a factual issue and even in war truth is a defense. In fact, it's the only defense. Is it true?
[54:56.620 --> 54:58.620]  And in a free country, you can speak the truth
[54:58.620 --> 55:03.180]  Really they used to arrest people for saying stuff like this
[55:03.820 --> 55:08.620]  When did they arrest people for saying stuff like this and who is they exactly?
[55:09.180 --> 55:14.220]  Well, the former caron aleen johnson didn't tell us she kept it big because that way it's a lot more threatening
[55:14.540 --> 55:18.540]  And maybe you will shut up and again, we hesitate to show clips from that show as an IQ killer
[55:18.860 --> 55:22.940]  They don't care about ukraine a lot of these people any more than they cared about george floyd
[55:23.660 --> 55:25.660]  They use tragedy
[55:25.660 --> 55:30.540]  george floyd's death the tragic invasion of ukraine for domestic political purposes
[55:31.020 --> 55:33.980]  This has unleashed something really dark in the united states
[55:35.260 --> 55:37.820]  In order to make wise decisions, you have to be rational
[55:38.620 --> 55:39.900]  thoughtful
[55:39.900 --> 55:41.900]  forward-thinking and calm
[55:42.220 --> 55:44.220]  And they're the opposite of all of those things
[55:44.700 --> 55:47.100]  So they tell us that cuten is mentally ill
[55:47.980 --> 55:51.260]  We can't assess that contrary to what you may have heard. We don't text with cuten
[55:51.260 --> 55:58.460]  But if that's true, and it certainly may be true almost nobody in the russian government seems to have anticipated the invasion of ukraine
[55:58.540 --> 56:00.780]  So he's clearly volatile at the least
[56:02.620 --> 56:04.620]  Why would you ever?
[56:04.860 --> 56:11.980]  Risk getting into a full-blown war with a volatile crazy person who has thousands of nuclear weapons
[56:12.060 --> 56:14.060]  What would happen if you did that?
[56:14.060 --> 56:16.860]  Maybe we think beyond today just for a moment
[56:17.580 --> 56:18.860]  But no one in
[56:18.860 --> 56:23.260]  As american borders don't matter, but ukraine's borders are so important. We will risk nuclear war for them
[56:23.980 --> 56:25.980]  You can't say that enough because it's real
[56:29.100 --> 56:29.820]  Very powerful
[56:29.820 --> 56:34.860]  We've got some other tucker carlson clips that we were gonna be playing as well. In fact, i've got time
[56:35.660 --> 56:38.460]  To get to one of those we'll cover that in the last segment
[56:39.100 --> 56:43.820]  Coming up here in just a moment. Oh, and what else are you going to be covering the next few hours of the broadcast?
[56:43.820 --> 56:53.340]  My goodness, uh, just a loaded news desk here, alex. Let's not forget about the ongoing globalist operation of depopulation with these vaccines
[56:53.820 --> 57:01.180]  And it's just sad fauci's putting himself back into the news as is the ceo of fies are saying you need more vaccines
[57:01.180 --> 57:04.540]  We're gonna have at least four. We're never gonna be out of this pandemic
[57:05.100 --> 57:12.780]  Meanwhile, you have the same thing happening dies suddenly blood clots children having strokes. Oh, it's normal nothing to see here
[57:12.780 --> 57:17.260]  Even though in multiple countries now including thailand and vancouver
[57:17.900 --> 57:19.900]  health officials are actually
[57:19.900 --> 57:25.580]  Taking a step back and saying wait a second. We need to reevaluate these vaccines. We need to pause these vaccines
[57:25.740 --> 57:30.140]  They're even doing massive payouts for vaccine injuries. Uh, that's just one step of it
[57:30.300 --> 57:35.340]  We've got another clinton associate getting a busted for pedophilia. We've got another democrat
[57:35.340 --> 57:41.740]  Uh mayor candidate getting busted for pedophilia. I mean, it's just it's everywhere alex. It's the info war. It never stops
[57:48.540 --> 57:50.540]  Two of our best-selling products are back in stock
[57:51.180 --> 57:52.940]  infowar store.com
[57:52.940 --> 57:57.740]  And they will sell out in the next three four months before I get more the product in if I sell it at full price
[57:58.300 --> 58:01.980]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or son
[58:01.980 --> 58:06.780]  Or getting x3 to try the products and see how amazing they are
[58:06.860 --> 58:11.900]  And I believe you will then get hooked on them like myself my family and the crew are
[58:12.380 --> 58:16.300]  So again, both these products are back in stock both x3 and winter sun
[58:16.620 --> 58:21.980]  They are 50 off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price
[58:22.380 --> 58:24.780]  I would estimate in less than a month
[58:25.260 --> 58:29.660]  So this is your chance to get x3 and experience the good halogens or some of the bad halogens
[58:29.660 --> 58:34.540]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin d3 with vitamin k for your muses as well
[58:34.860 --> 58:40.700]  They're amazing and they're an info war store.com. The reason this is 360 win is it funds the operation
[58:41.420 --> 58:46.380]  I need funds to run the operation. You need to be healthy. We need to stay on air. It's a match made in heaven
[58:48.300 --> 58:55.420]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large
[58:55.420 --> 59:02.460]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep, we could all use more of our new sleep support formula down and out

[59:21.500 --> 59:26.380]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it
[59:26.620 --> 59:30.460]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower
[59:30.620 --> 59:37.020]  Which was traditionally used by native americans like the cherries who used it for its relaxing qualities
[59:37.260 --> 59:43.180]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out

[1:00:10.300 --> 1:00:15.580]  I'm very blessed and thankful that we have a new warrior. I'm very blessed and thankful the amazing crew
[1:00:15.580 --> 1:00:24.540]  And oh and shroyer and just a fabulous job. They're doing I didn't get a chance to listen to the show yesterday when I got home last night
[1:00:24.940 --> 1:00:30.940]  I watched about an hour of the second hour and it just really breaks me apart of this organization and I want the listeners to know
[1:00:31.900 --> 1:00:33.900]  When I tell you this i'm not passing you
[1:00:34.060 --> 1:00:37.020]  You are the reason this is all happened and as owens keeps saying
[1:00:37.820 --> 1:00:39.820]  We were all born for this
[1:00:39.980 --> 1:00:41.980]  An info wars was met at this time
[1:00:41.980 --> 1:00:45.260]  We really have a brain crust of knowledge and research
[1:00:46.140 --> 1:00:49.260]  To independently face down the new world order and I can tell you
[1:00:49.740 --> 1:00:54.860]  It is getting to the highest levels of corporations and governments everywhere because when they hear our show
[1:00:55.660 --> 1:00:58.860]  They know the information is the same stuff. They're getting briefed on secretly
[1:00:59.260 --> 1:01:05.580]  But we've reverse engineered it and we also have different perspectives than what these intelligence agencies that are controlled by globalists
[1:01:05.820 --> 1:01:08.780]  Are telling them and so I cannot stress enough to all of you
[1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:13.660]  How important the work is we've done here and why the enemy hates us so much and it's so mad at us
[1:01:14.060 --> 1:01:19.260]  And it's only your action and your prayers and your financial support that's done this so so
[1:01:19.820 --> 1:01:23.020]  We're in trouble the world's in trouble. We got a fighting chance. Thanks to you
[1:01:23.500 --> 1:01:28.780]  And I cannot thank the viewers unless there's enough. I want to salute you and only just tell you god bless you
[1:01:29.020 --> 1:01:34.940]  Here's another clip I wanted to get to on tucker and the bio labs then the great owens shroyer will take over the balance of transmission
[1:01:35.260 --> 1:01:37.260]  No, I want to ask listeners again
[1:01:37.260 --> 1:01:40.860]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless
[1:01:40.940 --> 1:01:46.780]  But you've got to count the propaganda by remembering to tell everybody about the clips the shows the articles the videos
[1:01:46.780 --> 1:01:51.420]  And then tell them to share it and tell them to tell those they tell to share it and that completes the chain reaction
[1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:53.740]  Here's tucker carlson that owens shroyer takes over
[1:01:54.220 --> 1:02:00.700]  You know if you take three steps back the problem with the debate that we're having over ukraine and russia particularly
[1:02:01.020 --> 1:02:06.380]  With bio labs in ukraine isn't that people disagree about what the facts are?
[1:02:06.380 --> 1:02:13.980]  It's that nobody involved seems to be able to think clearly think rationally think empirically
[1:02:14.700 --> 1:02:20.540]  Everyone seems to have gone crazy and that's bad because the people who have gone crazy are the ones making all of the decisions
[1:02:20.540 --> 1:02:23.020]  So it's not really about this specific issue
[1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:26.860]  It's about our leader's capacity to lead
[1:02:27.820 --> 1:02:30.060]  But the bio weapons story is just a perfect illustration
[1:02:30.060 --> 1:02:36.380]  So we just talked to tulsi gabbert who was denounced as treasonous and potentially a murderer by a sitting u.s. center
[1:02:36.380 --> 1:02:38.380]  Admittedly it was mit romney, but he spoke for many
[1:02:39.180 --> 1:02:46.060]  Because she said look toria newland under secretary of state has said under oath. There are bio labs in ukraine
[1:02:47.500 --> 1:02:50.540]  And the contents of those labs because it's a war zone
[1:02:50.860 --> 1:02:55.580]  They haven't been secured could wind up in the wrong hands to which tulsi gabbert said holy smokes. This is a big deal
[1:02:55.580 --> 1:02:57.580]  I serve in the u.s. Army. We don't want that
[1:02:57.580 --> 1:03:03.260]  By the way, we know that bio labs can sometimes cause massive problems for the world. I think we've just seen that
[1:03:04.220 --> 1:03:06.220]  So then so that was tulsi gabbert's point
[1:03:06.860 --> 1:03:11.660]  The new york times was quick to denounce us for even talking about the subject. Oh
[1:03:12.300 --> 1:03:17.260]  Don't call them bio weapons. We never alleged the united states was making bio weapons. We don't know that
[1:03:17.660 --> 1:03:19.660]  What we said is what's factually true
[1:03:20.380 --> 1:03:25.260]  Which is there are stores we learn this from the u.s. government of soviet era bio weapons
[1:03:25.260 --> 1:03:28.780]  In ukraine that for some reason have not yet been destroyed
[1:03:30.220 --> 1:03:32.220]  That's a huge problem potentially
[1:03:32.780 --> 1:03:36.780]  And the new york times admitted that in their attack of us. Here's the quote. We'll just put it up
[1:03:36.940 --> 1:03:39.260]  Mr. Pope. This is robert popu runs the program
[1:03:39.740 --> 1:03:46.140]  Had warned that russia's invasion of ukraine made damaged laboratories in the country that conduct research and disease surveillance
[1:03:46.300 --> 1:03:48.300]  And are supported by the united states
[1:03:48.300 --> 1:03:55.420]  He noted that some of the facilities may contain pathogens once used for soviet era bio weapons programs
[1:03:55.820 --> 1:03:59.900]  But he emphasized the ukraine labs did not have the ability to manufacture bio labs. Okay
[1:04:00.940 --> 1:04:02.940]  Well, we quoted him too
[1:04:03.260 --> 1:04:05.100]  That's true
[1:04:05.100 --> 1:04:12.780]  And it's terrifying and if we can't respond to it because everyone's afraid of being called a tool of a foreign country people who are trying
[1:04:13.180 --> 1:04:16.780]  They're very hardest with the greatest level of sincerity to protect the united states
[1:04:16.780 --> 1:04:19.260]  Then we have lost the threat
[1:04:19.900 --> 1:04:21.900]  Then we can't lead the world. We can't even lead our own country
[1:04:22.780 --> 1:04:25.100]  If people like that are in charge
[1:04:28.860 --> 1:04:30.300]  So there you have it
[1:04:30.300 --> 1:04:36.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, and you know why they're coming after tucker carlson and gut felled and then I got another clip from fox news
[1:04:36.620 --> 1:04:42.780]  Where rachel campos duffy is just trying to tell the truth about ukraine and then you see the war hawks that sit next to
[1:04:42.780 --> 1:04:48.700]  On the couch shaking their heads like no, that's not the narrative. That's not the narrative and it's always the same people
[1:04:48.700 --> 1:04:54.460]  I notice it's always the same people at fox news never seen a war. They didn't want someone else to die in
[1:04:57.340 --> 1:05:00.380]  It's hard to believe that we're already into march
[1:05:01.020 --> 1:05:03.740]  2022 and in the month of february
[1:05:03.740 --> 1:05:08.700]  We had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product x3
[1:05:08.700 --> 1:05:13.740]  That's all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every
[1:05:14.700 --> 1:05:15.500]  electrochemical
[1:05:15.500 --> 1:05:20.300]  Cellular activity in your body your immune system your stamina your libido
[1:05:20.860 --> 1:05:26.940]  So much and the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine output
[1:05:26.940 --> 1:05:30.940]  So we had on sell 50% off but we sold more than half of what we have
[1:05:31.420 --> 1:05:36.620]  Or isn't going to come in for a long time. So I took it back to full process. I was thinking, you know what?
[1:05:36.620 --> 1:05:41.180]  We need the funds in now to stay on air. Plus, this is a great product everybody needs
[1:05:41.580 --> 1:05:47.340]  So incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get x3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast
[1:05:47.340 --> 1:06:06.700]  I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out get x3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off
[1:06:07.420 --> 1:06:15.420]  You found it the tip of the spear. It is the alex joneshow with oen shoya
[1:06:15.420 --> 1:06:22.620]  Glad honored to be sitting here in the info wars world headquarters in austin texas
[1:06:23.580 --> 1:06:27.260]  Guest hosting the alex joneshow. He has departed now
[1:06:27.820 --> 1:06:32.380]  And so I kind of want to hit a reset button here on the transmission and tell you what's coming up, but
[1:06:33.180 --> 1:06:35.180]  Let me quickly just tease
[1:06:35.340 --> 1:06:37.340]  alex is going to be
[1:06:37.340 --> 1:06:41.420]  On a couple exciting podcasts. I'm not sure when they're supposed to be
[1:06:41.420 --> 1:06:48.860]  published, but he'll be recording two very exciting podcasts this afternoon at least two and
[1:06:50.300 --> 1:06:53.180]  I'm looking forward to when those do go public
[1:06:54.540 --> 1:06:59.900]  But let me just tell you coming up today. We still have shone stone
[1:07:00.460 --> 1:07:02.460]  Who's going to be in studio?
[1:07:02.780 --> 1:07:04.780]  and I want to continue to cover the
[1:07:05.820 --> 1:07:08.940]  Documentary his father made award-winning filmmaker
[1:07:08.940 --> 1:07:17.260]  Ukraine on fire that they're trying to censor right now because it gets into the political corruption in ukraine including the western's involvement
[1:07:18.300 --> 1:07:20.300]  Which is really kind of the big?
[1:07:21.500 --> 1:07:23.500]  Hitch here is that
[1:07:25.900 --> 1:07:34.140]  Yeah, we live in a global economy and and everything's kind of connected, but it's a fragile delicate balance
[1:07:34.140 --> 1:07:40.140]  Did everybody kind of wants to keep into intact you would think unless you wanted to collapse the world economy so
[1:07:41.420 --> 1:07:43.420]  why
[1:07:44.940 --> 1:07:46.940]  Are
[1:07:46.940 --> 1:07:52.140]  U.S. Interests so involved in ukraine well, that's because our corrupt politicians like the bidens and
[1:07:52.940 --> 1:07:56.220]  Pelosi's and others have been using ukraine as a criminal
[1:07:56.940 --> 1:07:58.940]  operating front
[1:07:58.940 --> 1:08:05.580]  And so now the american people have to suffer and get involved with a potential larger conflict because of our corrupt leaders again
[1:08:06.540 --> 1:08:08.540]  And so i'm just sick of that
[1:08:09.180 --> 1:08:17.740]  I don't want the corrupt biden crime family and its crimes in ukraine to drag my country into a war it has no involvement in otherwise
[1:08:19.100 --> 1:08:21.100]  But we'll get into that and more with shone stone
[1:08:21.820 --> 1:08:25.500]  Coming up in the next hour and then wane allen root
[1:08:26.220 --> 1:08:27.420]  hosting
[1:08:27.420 --> 1:08:29.420]  The fourth hour
[1:08:29.900 --> 1:08:33.500]  I'm not sure when i'm going to be able to get to all this news on my desk
[1:08:34.300 --> 1:08:41.420]  If i'm going to be able to do it on the alex joneshow or if i'm imagining most of it's going to be held over to the war room
[1:08:41.500 --> 1:08:43.500]  Then i'm hosting today as well
[1:08:44.380 --> 1:08:50.380]  But i've got more news uh in regards to what's going on in ukraine. I'm going to get to that stack
[1:08:51.980 --> 1:08:57.180]  Let's not forget about the current operation that's underway with the population control and the medical tyranny
[1:08:57.180 --> 1:08:59.180]  with the vaccines
[1:09:00.620 --> 1:09:03.340]  I mean folks they're trying to act like it's normal
[1:09:04.620 --> 1:09:08.780]  For teenagers and healthy 20 year olds many of them athletes
[1:09:09.980 --> 1:09:14.380]  To now be suffering from strokes and heart attacks and sudden death
[1:09:16.780 --> 1:09:22.700]  And meanwhile you've got fauci and the feiser ceo saying more vaccines more vaccines more more more
[1:09:22.700 --> 1:09:27.660]  Meanwhile, even people that took maybe their first dose or second dose are saying well
[1:09:28.220 --> 1:09:33.980]  Wait a second. It's unlimited doses now. I just did this to get along. I just did this because I got pressured by my family
[1:09:33.980 --> 1:09:35.980]  I just did this to get because I got pressured by my
[1:09:36.620 --> 1:09:40.860]  Employer I just did this because you told me I'd get back to normal if we all just did this. I was a team player
[1:09:41.660 --> 1:09:46.060]  Now you're telling me that I've just joined on to your medical tyranny system. No, no, no, no
[1:09:47.020 --> 1:09:48.620]  But that's what's going on
[1:09:48.620 --> 1:09:53.100]  Um, I've got this stack of important political news that's happening in america that needs to be covered
[1:09:53.500 --> 1:09:59.340]  I've got a stack of cultural news. I've got uh, you know, there is a trucker convoy in dc by the way
[1:10:00.140 --> 1:10:06.060]  We barely have covered it. Uh, recently just because of all the other bigger news, but I mean, there's a trucker convoy in dc
[1:10:07.660 --> 1:10:09.660]  and
[1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:15.340]  It's kind of my understanding and I've talked to people who've been covering it. I've talked to a few people in it that that basically
[1:10:15.340 --> 1:10:18.940]  They're kind of playing ball with law enforcement
[1:10:19.660 --> 1:10:20.940]  and
[1:10:20.940 --> 1:10:26.220]  They've really had their convoy handicapped by law enforcement that they want to cooperate with
[1:10:26.940 --> 1:10:28.940]  So I think that's why
[1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:32.700]  any interested media has kind of backed off the coverage because
[1:10:33.740 --> 1:10:39.900]  I'm not trying to slight these people. I salute them. I pray for them and I say godspeed on your mission for america, but
[1:10:40.620 --> 1:10:43.180]  They did kind of buckle to the dc
[1:10:43.180 --> 1:10:48.060]  Law enforcement and so it's kind of been a bit of a neutered
[1:10:49.180 --> 1:10:52.300]  Convoy if you will I don't mean that as a disrespect or a slight
[1:10:52.860 --> 1:10:56.620]  I'm just telling you that's kind of in the case, but it looks like they might be ramping it up
[1:10:56.700 --> 1:10:58.700]  So we may be getting into some of that
[1:10:59.980 --> 1:11:03.900]  Uh, just hilarious news quite frankly with the left's current
[1:11:05.100 --> 1:11:09.420]  Cultural revolution of of the new religion of how gay you are
[1:11:09.420 --> 1:11:16.060]  It's like a new priest class of who's the gayester or who who can who can have more sexual reassignment surgeries
[1:11:16.540 --> 1:11:20.780]  It's just madness and then just being openly bigoted in the classroom
[1:11:21.100 --> 1:11:26.940]  Where they're now intentionally segregating white students and black students and telling the white students you're bad
[1:11:27.340 --> 1:11:33.900]  And then encouraging the black students to bully the white students so they can say oh see this is what your ancestors did
[1:11:33.980 --> 1:11:35.740]  you deserve this
[1:11:35.740 --> 1:11:37.740]  we're talking about
[1:11:37.740 --> 1:11:39.740]  middle school kids that
[1:11:39.900 --> 1:11:42.780]  Are maybe just learning about this part of american history
[1:11:43.260 --> 1:11:46.060]  Probably can't even really properly understand it
[1:11:46.620 --> 1:11:49.820]  But oh, they're gonna they're gonna really make this country racist again
[1:11:49.820 --> 1:11:56.220]  That's the democrat party the same democrat party of bull Connor that stood in the way of schoolhouse doors with with whips
[1:11:56.460 --> 1:11:59.340]  So if a black person tried to go in that democrat would whip them
[1:11:59.820 --> 1:12:03.820]  That's the democrat party, baby. That's the party of slavery
[1:12:03.820 --> 1:12:09.260]  Oh, but they want you to forget about that. They always complain like oh jefferson davis
[1:12:09.260 --> 1:12:16.300]  You know, let's remove jefferson davis from school buildings and streets and statues jefferson davis was a democrat
[1:12:16.860 --> 1:12:19.580]  But i digress from that so we'll have that coming up
[1:12:20.540 --> 1:12:22.540]  and then
[1:12:23.100 --> 1:12:25.260]  What is going on in chicago?
[1:12:27.100 --> 1:12:30.380]  Lori lightfoot in chicago is a cartoon character
[1:12:30.380 --> 1:12:37.740]  I mean you thought this beetle juice clone had reached full levels of insanity. Uh, not quite
[1:12:38.300 --> 1:12:41.660]  uh beetle juice lightfoot is getting more insane as the days go on so
[1:12:43.180 --> 1:12:46.380]  All that and more coming up. I'm gonna just really become a news
[1:12:47.340 --> 1:12:49.340]  reading machine
[1:12:49.420 --> 1:12:53.580]  On the other side of this break. Yeah, there's your new lori lightfoot that just dropped. Look at that drip
[1:12:53.580 --> 1:12:59.900]  Oh my god, but aside from her looking like beetle juice and and dressing like a goon
[1:13:00.780 --> 1:13:02.540]  um
[1:13:02.540 --> 1:13:07.580]  She's threatening. She's threatening workers in chicago that won't get a vaccine and she says oh
[1:13:09.020 --> 1:13:15.820]  We're not firing people that won't get a vaccine. We're just gonna make sure you can't get a paycheck. Oh, okay. Yeah
[1:13:15.820 --> 1:13:22.540]  Yeah, sure you are. We're not here to murder you. We're just gonna stab you in the neck until you bleed to death
[1:13:23.900 --> 1:13:25.580]  All right
[1:13:25.580 --> 1:13:27.580]  So all that's coming up, but you know what?
[1:13:27.580 --> 1:13:34.220]  Let's do this real quick. Nancy Pelosi has interests in ukraine with her her corrupt crime family. She she's a mafia child
[1:13:34.940 --> 1:13:38.860]  And she's running for office again. Now you tell me if this woman
[1:13:39.660 --> 1:13:41.340]  in clip two
[1:13:41.340 --> 1:13:49.180]  Looks and sounds like a sane individual that has her, you know, what together or if this sounds like a deteriorating
[1:13:50.060 --> 1:13:52.060]  psychopath
[1:13:52.060 --> 1:13:57.820]  That needs to be removed from any positions of power if a family cared about or they'd probably put her in, you know, some sort of
[1:13:58.620 --> 1:14:00.540]  Care in her own home. I mean they've got enough money
[1:14:00.540 --> 1:14:05.420]  They can just build a whole home for her if they needed to you tell me how Nancy Pelosi sounds here in clip two
[1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:08.700]  But they know that we can't go there
[1:14:08.700 --> 1:14:10.700]  Uh, the
[1:14:10.780 --> 1:14:12.780]  Putin is trying to
[1:14:13.340 --> 1:14:15.340]  Bait the trap so that
[1:14:15.340 --> 1:14:19.660]  We go in and that's the beginning could be the beginning of world war three
[1:14:20.220 --> 1:14:25.900]  A Putin totally irresponsible using weapons that are not allowed under the Geneva connect convention
[1:14:26.300 --> 1:14:29.420]  Putin who threatens chemical use of chemical weapons
[1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:35.500]  Nuclear and the rest so they know that we can't but it's the ask now
[1:14:36.300 --> 1:14:38.300]  He was this morning
[1:14:38.300 --> 1:14:42.460]  More let's if we can't have an if we can't have a no-fly zone
[1:14:43.020 --> 1:14:44.220]  Let us
[1:14:44.220 --> 1:14:47.180]  Have our own and we need the airplanes to come in
[1:14:50.300 --> 1:14:56.140]  No, no, no, no this morning he was less on the on the ask for the
[1:14:58.540 --> 1:15:03.180]  That policy more on let us do it help us get the planes
[1:15:03.180 --> 1:15:10.540]  But also there is a school of thought that thinks the anti aircraft missiles and the rest are a very important way
[1:15:11.100 --> 1:15:15.740]  Myself when I see that that those tanks at 40 miles of tanks
[1:15:17.660 --> 1:15:20.540]  I'd like to take out those tanks. I mean I I think that air
[1:15:21.420 --> 1:15:24.860]  Them having more planes might be useful, but that I'm not a
[1:15:25.740 --> 1:15:27.340]  military
[1:15:27.340 --> 1:15:29.100]  strategist
[1:15:29.100 --> 1:15:34.780]  We hope that we will be able to get up to a place. I hope you asked me how I hope that we can get to a place
[1:15:35.260 --> 1:15:36.460]  where the
[1:15:36.460 --> 1:15:39.580]  Migs which are the kinds of planes. They've been framed on
[1:15:40.700 --> 1:15:42.700]  Can go to ukraine
[1:15:43.820 --> 1:15:49.020]  The f16s especially if we have an excess of them can backfill for Poland
[1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:55.260]  Nancy Pelosi the poster child for term limits and uh, I guess what I'll call abused
[1:15:55.260 --> 1:15:58.700]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal
[1:15:59.340 --> 1:16:01.500]  for all our great info wars listeners and viewers

[1:17:00.460 --> 1:17:07.660]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press free speech means the free and public
[1:17:08.220 --> 1:17:10.700]  expression of opinions without censorship
[1:17:11.260 --> 1:17:13.660]  interference and restraint by the government
[1:17:13.660 --> 1:17:20.380]  231 years later free speech across america is under chronic and insidious attack

[1:17:54.460 --> 1:17:56.860]  It has been noted by many a historian
[1:17:57.420 --> 1:18:00.220]  The first casualty of war is the truth
[1:18:00.860 --> 1:18:02.860]  Then the next big casualty
[1:18:02.940 --> 1:18:04.940]  Isn't even the people that died
[1:18:05.660 --> 1:18:07.660]  No, that invariably follows
[1:18:07.660 --> 1:18:13.740]  But first there is the crackdown on populations basic liberty and speech
[1:18:14.220 --> 1:18:18.780]  And massive censorship and now across the world from the united states to europe
[1:18:19.420 --> 1:18:21.420]  legislations being introduced
[1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:23.740]  that if you

[1:18:31.580 --> 1:18:35.340]  You can be a prisoner and of course now canada's introduced legislation
[1:18:35.340 --> 1:18:41.100]  That if you have a thought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage

[1:20:13.740 --> 1:20:15.740]  Oh
[1:20:25.740 --> 1:20:32.620]  I want to mention a couple things and we're gonna change lanes quickly and just cover some other news and then get back into the conflict in ukraine
[1:20:33.740 --> 1:20:36.700]  With shon stone coming into studio to discuss this
[1:20:37.260 --> 1:20:41.980]  Uh, but a couple things that that need to be mentioned at least here today and they won't get the full focus
[1:20:41.980 --> 1:20:43.980]  But they need to be mentioned
[1:20:44.300 --> 1:20:47.500]  You do have a trucker convoy in dc that's getting bigger
[1:20:48.140 --> 1:20:56.700]  And basically for a couple hours a day they just drive the dc beltway and they've caused a bunch of traffic and some locals are complaining but um
[1:20:59.740 --> 1:21:06.060]  Again i'm not trying to sound sliding or or disrespectful to the convoy in dc right now that is not my intention
[1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:09.900]  I'm just telling you the reason why it's not getting much coverage and not press is because
[1:21:09.900 --> 1:21:17.260]  To me the demands that they've listed have not really been that hardcore or publicly made
[1:21:17.980 --> 1:21:21.340]  uh, obviously there's a blackout on the news coverage and
[1:21:21.980 --> 1:21:25.820]  The leaders of it have been doing everything possible to cooperate with law enforcement
[1:21:26.300 --> 1:21:28.300]  I guess to avoid a similar situation
[1:21:28.700 --> 1:21:34.540]  As what happened in canada with people getting their bank accounts removed and people getting arrested and disappeared and everything
[1:21:34.540 --> 1:21:42.300]  Uh, not to mention with the current democrat party in power already with hundreds of political prisoners being tortured. So i understand that
[1:21:43.180 --> 1:21:46.220]  Um, but it's worth mentioning there is a trucker convoy
[1:21:46.300 --> 1:21:50.700]  It is happening in dc for about four or five hours a day clogging up the dc beltway
[1:21:51.180 --> 1:21:53.180]  And uh, that's kind of the status there
[1:21:53.500 --> 1:22:02.140]  There's also another convoy in canada that's going on right now that is actually starting to get a little more headway and a little more news coverage
[1:22:02.140 --> 1:22:04.140]  And it's the same story
[1:22:04.700 --> 1:22:09.900]  Uh, they want to get rid of the vaccine mandates get rid of all the lockdowns and mask mandates
[1:22:10.380 --> 1:22:15.900]  And uh, they've actually moved into british columbia now. So it's not centered in in ottawa as much
[1:22:16.380 --> 1:22:19.260]  Uh, so a continuation of the canadian
[1:22:20.380 --> 1:22:25.420]  Freedom convoy is happening in canada. So those are two developing stories
[1:22:25.420 --> 1:22:31.660]  We're not going to focus on today, but it's worth you knowing that those things are happening
[1:22:32.780 --> 1:22:34.620]  also
[1:22:34.620 --> 1:22:37.020]  And you know, maybe we should focus more on this
[1:22:37.820 --> 1:22:42.140]  It's not my intention today. I don't have a big stack of news on this. I could if I wanted to
[1:22:43.180 --> 1:22:45.180]  There is a all out
[1:22:46.300 --> 1:22:51.980]  War going on at the southern border with the mexican cartels and and in some cases
[1:22:52.780 --> 1:22:54.780]  border patrol agents
[1:22:54.780 --> 1:23:03.100]  They're finding stash houses of young little girls at the southern border stash houses of young little girls being trafficked into sex
[1:23:04.460 --> 1:23:07.740]  Uh, they're finding at certain parts of the border
[1:23:09.740 --> 1:23:13.740]  I mean folks, it's it's the same old stuff evidence of drug abuse evidence of
[1:23:14.700 --> 1:23:18.860]  Child sex trafficking evidence of sex trafficking evidence of human trafficking
[1:23:19.580 --> 1:23:22.140]  Uh evidence of just illegal immigration
[1:23:22.140 --> 1:23:28.780]  And then the cartels are down there doing god knows what dead bodies being found everywhere whole whole
[1:23:29.340 --> 1:23:36.460]  Buildings just being burnt to the ground overnight. The cartels running around shooting guns into the air. So, I mean, it's like it's wild
[1:23:37.820 --> 1:23:40.700]  it is wild and
[1:23:41.740 --> 1:23:46.700]  It's not really getting any coverage at all. Some of the videos coming out of there are just absolutely insane
[1:23:46.700 --> 1:23:52.140]  But again, they're finding dead children's bodies. I mean folks. It is just it is just bad
[1:23:52.780 --> 1:23:54.780]  um, but meanwhile
[1:23:55.580 --> 1:23:57.580]  Of course with the open southern border
[1:23:58.620 --> 1:24:03.020]  You have russians and ukrainians joining in on the fun
[1:24:03.660 --> 1:24:07.420]  of crossing the southern border illegally to come into this country and get the
[1:24:08.780 --> 1:24:10.780]  Billions of dollars that we pay
[1:24:10.780 --> 1:24:16.060]  For this illegal immigration to go on. So just know
[1:24:17.820 --> 1:24:23.580]  The southern border is still out of control and maybe even worse than it's ever been where it appears
[1:24:25.500 --> 1:24:29.740]  The the best of my analysis is that there's now turf wars happening
[1:24:30.540 --> 1:24:33.420]  between cartel groups and maybe even like
[1:24:34.140 --> 1:24:37.260]  corrupt members of the mexican border patrol or the us border patrol
[1:24:37.260 --> 1:24:40.780]  I'm not trying to be disrespectful. I think they're good people. I'm just saying
[1:24:41.500 --> 1:24:45.980]  It I mean it looks like there's like full-on turf wars going on at the southern border
[1:24:47.420 --> 1:24:50.940]  And and and there's dead bodies piling up and there's human sex
[1:24:51.500 --> 1:24:57.100]  operations getting busted and there's just massive fires and complexes burning down
[1:24:57.900 --> 1:25:03.340]  So, you know, that's might be a bigger threat to us than what's going on in ukraine
[1:25:04.140 --> 1:25:05.580]  that is
[1:25:05.580 --> 1:25:11.660]  Except for the fact that we've got our corrupt politicians like biden and pelosi and romney and others that have their interests in ukraine
[1:25:11.660 --> 1:25:14.460]  So we have to get dragged into that conflict now
[1:25:19.260 --> 1:25:25.820]  Yeah, folks i'm telling you it's just wild the crew pulling up some of these headlines mexican cartel gunman attacks us consulate building new york texas
[1:25:26.460 --> 1:25:29.820]  It's getting wild down there ladies and gentlemen
[1:25:30.620 --> 1:25:33.100]  It is getting wild down there
[1:25:34.140 --> 1:25:35.500]  um
[1:25:35.500 --> 1:25:40.940]  Let's do this and i'm going to come back and get into some of this latest vaccine news and stuff
[1:25:42.140 --> 1:25:47.100]  But um, you know, here's another example on fox news. Here's rachel campos stuffy
[1:25:47.660 --> 1:25:55.260]  Who's just trying to be neutral on the ukraine rusher situation and and not go along with the fox talking points and there's brian killmead
[1:25:55.980 --> 1:26:01.340]  Who look brian killmead says some good stuff every once in a while, but but i'm i'm i'm a media
[1:26:01.340 --> 1:26:06.540]  I call me a media critic really i'm like addicted to media i see brian killmead all the time
[1:26:06.700 --> 1:26:09.580]  He's a neocon. He's a conservative establishment hack
[1:26:10.380 --> 1:26:14.860]  He'll do what he's told if he's told the barker sit and so listen as rachel campos stuff
[1:26:14.860 --> 1:26:20.860]  He tries to be neutral in the ukraine rusher situation and there's neocon brian killmead shaking his head trying to cut her off
[1:26:21.100 --> 1:26:26.140]  Like he's in the new he wants to be the next sean hannity warhawk. I wonder how much money he has invested in these
[1:26:26.140 --> 1:26:30.700]  Uh weapons manufacturers stocks, but here it is on fox news just last night
[1:26:31.420 --> 1:26:36.220]  I don't know if you look at that map and and the areas that they have that you say could end up in this peace agreement
[1:26:36.220 --> 1:26:38.620]  That's true and that's why we should have never provoked them
[1:26:38.620 --> 1:26:45.660]  I mean they made very clear that there was a red line the red line was a neutrality for ukraine that they could not enter nato
[1:26:45.900 --> 1:26:49.740]  And in the end when they get this if they get this peace agreement in the end
[1:26:49.980 --> 1:26:52.380]  That's probably going to end up being the case anyway
[1:26:52.380 --> 1:26:57.340]  No, I bet 10. I bet I bet you that one of the conditions will have to be that ukraine
[1:26:57.740 --> 1:27:05.180]  You know promise to remain neutral will not be part of nato. I'll tell you what you can never give into what russia wants other nations to do
[1:27:05.740 --> 1:27:12.300]  Uh, you you decide they're gonna decide to go to nato go into the european union when they're at there at european society that wants that
[1:27:12.460 --> 1:27:18.860]  Well, we have it we have a Monroe doctrine and I think we would be very concerned about this kind of action in our hemisphere
[1:27:19.180 --> 1:27:20.780]  I think he said
[1:27:20.780 --> 1:27:23.020]  Keep it neutral and and in the end
[1:27:23.740 --> 1:27:27.260]  Probably ukraine is going to lose more land because of this again
[1:27:28.220 --> 1:27:32.140]  The the main problem here as you see and as we discussed well
[1:27:32.460 --> 1:27:38.700]  No, actually the main problem is still china and now we've created a bigger block china and russia together
[1:27:38.860 --> 1:27:42.060]  This is why our policy makers aren't thinking long term
[1:27:42.700 --> 1:27:47.820]  Provoking this this war has brought our two enemies closer together. They provoke the war
[1:27:47.820 --> 1:27:54.620]  Well, they had a red line and we had an agreement in november with a security line in other countries rachel
[1:27:54.620 --> 1:28:00.140]  It's not up to them to make a red. So that's good. So so here's what i'm just saying here is that
[1:28:01.580 --> 1:28:03.260]  I watch
[1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:09.020]  10 12 hours media listen talk radio read news stories every day. I don't forget this stuff
[1:28:10.780 --> 1:28:12.780]  brian killmeade is a hack
[1:28:12.940 --> 1:28:15.820]  brian killmeade told you trump would never win he bashed trump for years
[1:28:15.820 --> 1:28:20.780]  brian killmeade makes millions of dollars with a fox news talk radio show and going on fox news
[1:28:21.020 --> 1:28:23.020]  He's a conservative neocon hack
[1:28:23.420 --> 1:28:27.020]  He's he's a goblin and and you know what i'm sad that that's the case
[1:28:27.100 --> 1:28:28.620]  I want brian kill me to be a good person
[1:28:28.620 --> 1:28:34.060]  But you see he's got a parrot the fox news neocon talking points. Putin the bad guy
[1:28:35.020 --> 1:28:41.100]  Putin the bad guy ukraine the good guy and and all rachel rachel duffy is saying is the truth there
[1:28:41.100 --> 1:28:47.820]  It's all she's saying is the truth, but you see the two neocon plants there on fox news can't let her finish the statement
[1:28:48.140 --> 1:28:54.940]  Without keeping up the narrative that oh, it's all putin. It's all russia. We need to save ukraine no matter how many other people die in this war
[1:28:56.220 --> 1:28:59.260]  It's hard to believe that we're already into march
[1:29:00.380 --> 1:29:02.620]  2022 and in the month of february
[1:29:02.620 --> 1:29:07.580]  We had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product x3
[1:29:07.580 --> 1:29:12.620]  And that's all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every
[1:29:13.180 --> 1:29:14.380]  electrochemical
[1:29:14.380 --> 1:29:19.180]  Cellular activity in your body your immune system your stamina your libido
[1:29:19.740 --> 1:29:25.900]  So much and the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine out there
[1:29:25.900 --> 1:29:31.820]  So we had on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have or isn't going to come in for a long time
[1:29:32.220 --> 1:29:34.220]  So I took it back to full price
[1:29:34.220 --> 1:29:37.820]  So I was just thinking you know what we need the funds in now to stand on air
[1:29:38.140 --> 1:29:40.140]  Plus this is a great product everybody needs
[1:29:40.540 --> 1:29:46.300]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get x3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast
[1:29:46.700 --> 1:29:54.460]  I'm going to keep it at 50 off until it sells out get x3 right now exclusively at info war store dot com for 50 off
[1:29:56.380 --> 1:29:58.860]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal
[1:29:59.500 --> 1:30:01.660]  for all our great info wars listeners and viewers
[1:30:01.660 --> 1:30:06.780]  If you will simply get x3 with all three types of good iodine
[1:30:07.100 --> 1:30:11.500]  That boost your immune system and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level
[1:30:12.060 --> 1:30:19.420]  It will change your life. It will invigorate you. It will empower you almost everyone has iodine deficiency look into it
[1:30:19.660 --> 1:30:22.380]  For yourself. It's the opposite of fluoride. It's the good
[1:30:22.380 --> 1:30:31.260]  How it's and then your purchase of x3 funds our operation now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because the lockdowns
[1:30:31.500 --> 1:30:33.020]  And supply chain breakouts
[1:30:33.020 --> 1:30:35.020]  We were sold out of x3 for a long time
[1:30:35.340 --> 1:30:41.580]  And I had it on sale for 50 off a lot of folks were getting it and I was thinking you know what I'm going to bring it back on sale again
[1:30:41.660 --> 1:30:45.580]  Just until it sells out because even though we won't make as much money in the long run
[1:30:45.660 --> 1:30:50.300]  A lot of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on air
[1:30:50.300 --> 1:30:54.380]  See your x3 right now at 50% off at infowarstore.com
[1:30:55.340 --> 1:31:00.940]  Micah, california. Thanks for calling. I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research
[1:31:01.100 --> 1:31:06.060]  Now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation the u.s. Government gain of function
[1:31:06.300 --> 1:31:09.500]  deliberative process and research funding pause on
[1:31:10.060 --> 1:31:16.300]  Selected gain of function research involving influenza mers and dars viruses does nothing about stars like viruses
[1:31:16.300 --> 1:31:22.380]  And it's a research funding pause. It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition. It's when you come to a four-way intersection
[1:31:22.380 --> 1:31:25.660]  There's the stop sign you stop you look both ways and then you proceed
[1:31:25.740 --> 1:31:30.300]  And so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function
[1:31:30.300 --> 1:31:34.780]  But they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research
[1:31:34.860 --> 1:31:40.460]  So, you know rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right. They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function
[1:31:40.460 --> 1:31:46.060]  You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself. That's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic life
[1:31:46.060 --> 1:31:51.020]  Forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition, it's still a gain of function
[1:31:51.100 --> 1:31:54.940]  You're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people. Thank you Mike. We love you
[1:31:55.580 --> 1:31:59.500]  There is very little contemporary study in the world
[1:32:00.220 --> 1:32:02.220]  of the planet's ruling class
[1:32:02.380 --> 1:32:04.860]  Not in communist china not in mexico
[1:32:05.500 --> 1:32:07.500]  Not in the united states not anywhere
[1:32:08.140 --> 1:32:10.140]  Is there a real study
[1:32:10.300 --> 1:32:12.700]  Of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design
[1:32:12.700 --> 1:32:18.780]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[1:32:19.580 --> 1:32:22.220]  That look in to say the anglo-american establishment
[1:32:22.700 --> 1:32:28.540]  The sound of the builder bird group the trilateral commission of the united nations the whole project of the rock shawls and the rock folks
[1:32:29.420 --> 1:32:34.380]  Until 10 years ago the media said the control corporate media the builder bird group didn't exist
[1:32:35.180 --> 1:32:37.740]  Well, now the builder bird group is public in its former head
[1:32:37.740 --> 1:32:43.740]  The control of the steering committee is called Schwab and he has set up the great reset at global government
[1:32:44.140 --> 1:32:48.140]  And if as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on
[1:32:48.860 --> 1:32:54.700]  About the second thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover. We don't have a shot. We do expose them. We can beat em easily
[1:32:54.700 --> 1:33:06.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[1:33:16.940 --> 1:33:19.580]  You found it the tip of the spear
[1:33:19.580 --> 1:33:24.940]  Here it is the alex joneshow with owen shroyer
[1:33:26.700 --> 1:33:37.740]  If you take life, do you know what's you let's not forget about the current global operation medical tyranny medical industrial complex
[1:33:39.340 --> 1:33:41.660]  World government depopulation agenda
[1:33:41.660 --> 1:33:52.220]  That was the root of the kovat 19 outbreak and then the vaccines that followed. So let's cover the latest on that situation. You have
[1:33:53.420 --> 1:33:56.860]  Millions now going into lockdown in china again
[1:33:57.740 --> 1:34:03.420]  um, i've seen numbers from 17 million to 30 million and more so i mean who knows the actual numbers but
[1:34:04.140 --> 1:34:09.500]  Um fox con has halted iphone production at factories in shenzhen due to lockdown
[1:34:09.500 --> 1:34:13.900]  So you've got big lockdowns happening again in china they they were at
[1:34:14.860 --> 1:34:20.380]  Like they were averaging 50 to 100 kovat cases a day
[1:34:21.180 --> 1:34:25.740]  For like a year and then all of a sudden overnight it was 50 000 cases in one day
[1:34:25.740 --> 1:34:28.940]  So something's going on in china the lockdowns are back
[1:34:28.940 --> 1:34:39.260]  And if we're operating on the same timetable as kovat that means they would be reintroducing these lockdowns in about three months in america
[1:34:40.380 --> 1:34:48.940]  However, i think the democrats are going to do everything they can to try to avoid that until after the midterm elections
[1:34:50.220 --> 1:34:53.500]  When either it'll be a dead duck party because they lose
[1:34:54.300 --> 1:34:56.060]  congress
[1:34:56.060 --> 1:35:01.900]  Or they'll be more empowered and charged than ever to destroy the american way of life
[1:35:02.700 --> 1:35:06.620]  And they'll really clamp down with the lockdowns either way i would expect it after the midterms
[1:35:06.700 --> 1:35:09.980]  But the timetable might be moving too quickly for them
[1:35:10.540 --> 1:35:16.700]  And so we'll see what they have to do and it could be the same thing we saw with oh the democrats now want to fund the police
[1:35:16.780 --> 1:35:22.140]  Oh, yes, we forgot for five years you chanted defund the police and actually did defund the police in many of these cities
[1:35:22.300 --> 1:35:24.300]  They're having record crime outbreaks
[1:35:24.380 --> 1:35:25.900]  but uh, oh
[1:35:25.900 --> 1:35:27.900]  And just think about this too
[1:35:30.540 --> 1:35:32.540]  You saw record crime
[1:35:33.180 --> 1:35:35.180]  in the year 2021
[1:35:36.380 --> 1:35:43.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're not even a quarter of the way through the year 2022 and and we're already on pace to shatter the record crime
[1:35:43.580 --> 1:35:45.580]  We saw last year
[1:35:46.300 --> 1:35:52.060]  So i mean it's it's getting real bad in these democrat run cities folks. I mean real bad
[1:35:52.620 --> 1:35:54.300]  i mean new york
[1:35:54.300 --> 1:35:56.300]  san francisco dc
[1:35:56.940 --> 1:35:58.940]  chicago
[1:36:01.340 --> 1:36:02.780]  Moving on
[1:36:02.780 --> 1:36:09.740]  Los angeles teachers union forcing students to keep wearing masks even though the mandate is over they will never stop torturing your kids
[1:36:09.900 --> 1:36:11.900]  They love it
[1:36:12.220 --> 1:36:15.820]  Breathe in your own carbon emissions. Just die
[1:36:16.860 --> 1:36:20.460]  Wear that face muzzle forever. I mean these people are such a joke man
[1:36:20.460 --> 1:36:24.860]  They really will never take off their mask and I love this piece of art
[1:36:26.940 --> 1:36:29.820]  And it's a woman in a mask and the mask says
[1:36:31.900 --> 1:36:36.700]  I'm just not ready to accept that everything I believed was a lie
[1:36:38.220 --> 1:36:44.860]  Well, will you ever be ready to accept that or will you live the lie forever? I guess that is the choice
[1:36:45.580 --> 1:36:47.580]  They have to make
[1:36:47.580 --> 1:36:52.140]  It's easier to fool a man than for a man to admit
[1:36:52.220 --> 1:36:55.740]  He was fooled and that's what you're seeing right now with these
[1:36:56.540 --> 1:37:00.380]  Libs walking around with their face masks for the rest of their lives taking
[1:37:00.940 --> 1:37:02.940]  five six seven vaccines till they die
[1:37:03.980 --> 1:37:05.980]  Uh, really a sad thing
[1:37:06.700 --> 1:37:09.100]  thailand pays out 45 million
[1:37:09.900 --> 1:37:10.780]  to
[1:37:10.780 --> 1:37:14.700]  16 000 people following covid 19 adverse reactions
[1:37:14.700 --> 1:37:17.660]  Ah safe and effective. They said safe and effective
[1:37:18.780 --> 1:37:24.140]  More tricks from the cdc child flu deaths continued to mysteriously disappear in 2021
[1:37:24.380 --> 1:37:28.700]  So they could ramp up covid death numbers and abuse children. Yeah the um
[1:37:30.860 --> 1:37:35.420]  The flu disappeared there is no flu anymore. It's all covid and and I forget
[1:37:36.700 --> 1:37:41.100]  It was some mainstream leptis publication that had the headline recently
[1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:44.860]  Did the pcr tests?
[1:37:46.380 --> 1:37:52.540]  Give us false covid numbers that inflated the fear and the pandemic and it's like
[1:37:53.340 --> 1:37:59.020]  Whoa, you just figured that one out, huh? Wow, you guys are really slow
[1:37:59.740 --> 1:38:01.740]  It'd be like if you were running
[1:38:02.220 --> 1:38:04.220]  a race
[1:38:05.260 --> 1:38:10.780]  And everybody finishes up the race and it's it's post race and there's an award ceremony or you know
[1:38:10.780 --> 1:38:15.580]  People are having lunch or whatever and then somebody finishes the race and you're like, whoa, you were still out there running
[1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:18.940]  Oh, we finished hours ago. You just finished. Where have you been?
[1:38:19.740 --> 1:38:22.940]  That seems to be the left on every issue these days
[1:38:24.300 --> 1:38:26.300]  top doctor at vancouver coastal health
[1:38:27.820 --> 1:38:34.460]  Says covid 19 vaccine is not effective at preventing infection or transmission of any of the variant variants
[1:38:34.460 --> 1:38:40.540]  And it's time to just drop all covid restrictions all together. By the way, uh, Pfizer's admitting that too, but we'll have that in a second
[1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:44.780]  Here's the side effects. They want to act like don't exist even though they're all public now
[1:38:45.420 --> 1:38:47.660]  Stroke rates are increasing among young people
[1:38:48.460 --> 1:38:50.460]  That's npr
[1:38:50.460 --> 1:38:55.340]  Stroke rates are increasing among young people. What is the controlled variable?
[1:38:56.700 --> 1:39:00.300]  What is the controlled variable on the entire population if you were to say
[1:39:00.300 --> 1:39:04.380]  Four years ago compared to now. Well, it would be the vaccine
[1:39:05.900 --> 1:39:09.580]  Why are you seeing young people having strokes and blood clots and heart attacks?
[1:39:10.460 --> 1:39:15.740]  I don't know. What's the difference between now and four years ago? Well, they're all getting this experimental
[1:39:16.780 --> 1:39:18.860]  injection
[1:39:18.860 --> 1:39:20.860]  but
[1:39:25.900 --> 1:39:27.900]  That's what npr is really saying
[1:39:27.900 --> 1:39:32.300]  Shh the vaccines are causing strokes. Shh. Don't tell anyone
[1:39:33.260 --> 1:39:37.820]  We promoted it and we didn't say the side effects. We probably need to go to jail for that, but just
[1:39:40.460 --> 1:39:46.860]  Number two female golfer kelly or nelly corda undergoing treatment for blood clot
[1:39:48.860 --> 1:39:51.340]  What is she like 30 years old or less?
[1:39:53.180 --> 1:39:55.180]  Great athlete good shape
[1:39:55.340 --> 1:39:57.020]  blood clot
[1:39:57.020 --> 1:40:00.860]  And hey, I don't want like I don't want to sit here and think this is all from the vaccine
[1:40:00.860 --> 1:40:03.820]  But it's odd how this is all happening all of a sudden
[1:40:05.580 --> 1:40:07.580]  Just a coincidence. I'm sure
[1:40:07.580 --> 1:40:12.940]  Knoxville teacher and basketball coach dies suddenly dies suddenly 28 years old
[1:40:14.220 --> 1:40:16.220]  dies suddenly
[1:40:19.900 --> 1:40:21.900]  Dies suddenly is now a
[1:40:23.180 --> 1:40:25.180]  top search term
[1:40:25.180 --> 1:40:28.700]  On google because of stories like these
[1:40:31.340 --> 1:40:35.660]  And they never want to tell you what's going on they all want to cover it up
[1:40:37.100 --> 1:40:41.020]  And again, do we know for sure this is from a vaccine?
[1:40:42.780 --> 1:40:48.620]  We may never know because they're not doing a proper investigation or honest coverage of this stuff
[1:40:48.620 --> 1:40:54.380]  But it's another dies suddenly. It's another young person with a stroke. It's another young person with a heart attack
[1:40:55.180 --> 1:40:58.700]  And by the way, I'm seeing accounts like this all the time now
[1:40:59.260 --> 1:41:01.420]  People saying I got the vaccine. I got two
[1:41:02.060 --> 1:41:06.060]  Uh, I was told how great it was. I used to be an extreme athlete. It used to be a mountain biker
[1:41:06.060 --> 1:41:10.460]  I used to be a mountain climber. I used to be a tennis player. I used to be a cross fit athlete
[1:41:10.460 --> 1:41:15.260]  And now I can't do anything because I'm constantly undergoing treatments for vaccine side effects
[1:41:15.260 --> 1:41:18.380]  But here's Anthony Fauci. He says more vaccines are the answer
[1:41:19.260 --> 1:41:24.140]  And we'll never be out of this. That's called medical tyranny. That's called fascism
[1:41:24.300 --> 1:41:29.980]  That's called you've been conquered by the medical industrial complex and Anthony Fauci promoting the death clot shot
[1:41:30.700 --> 1:41:38.540]  Pfizer ceo pushes forth booster in live interview with face to nation while admitting it doesn't stop infection
[1:41:39.180 --> 1:41:40.940]  Isn't that fun?
[1:41:40.940 --> 1:41:45.420]  Oh, yeah, this doesn't stop infection. But you should get four five six. You should take him forever
[1:41:45.740 --> 1:41:50.860]  Meanwhile, kairi erving who's been fighting back back against these mandates. This is how insane it is in new york
[1:41:51.180 --> 1:41:53.980]  kairi erving is not allowed to play basketball
[1:41:55.020 --> 1:41:57.020]  for the brooklyn nets
[1:41:58.940 --> 1:42:05.660]  Because he hasn't taken a vaccine so he's not allowed to even go and be a part of the team activities
[1:42:05.660 --> 1:42:12.300]  When they're playing in brooklyn, but you know what he can do he can purchase a ticket
[1:42:12.940 --> 1:42:14.940]  and attend the ball game
[1:42:15.660 --> 1:42:19.660]  Without being vaccinated and without a mask, but he can't play in the game
[1:42:20.220 --> 1:42:26.940]  So as a troll he bought tickets. Well, I guess technically it's his family season tickets and he went and sat
[1:42:27.500 --> 1:42:29.500]  in his season tickets
[1:42:29.820 --> 1:42:32.540]  But he can't play in the game total clown world
[1:42:32.540 --> 1:42:34.540]  Now see
[1:42:35.980 --> 1:42:41.020]  I'll have to come back to this but folks they're saying oh look at all these side effects from coveted, you know
[1:42:42.060 --> 1:42:48.300]  Brain damage lung damage tissue damage weakness sex drive damage all this stuff and they say oh the vaccine's the answer
[1:42:48.620 --> 1:42:52.060]  Why aren't we mad at the people that made this virus?
[1:42:52.700 --> 1:42:55.900]  That's where the attention should be who made this death

[1:47:19.420 --> 1:47:21.420]  Right
[1:47:29.980 --> 1:47:34.700]  All right, we're about to be joined in the next hour by shone stone in studio to talk about
[1:47:36.300 --> 1:47:41.660]  The relevance now even more relevant than ever his father's documentary ukraine on fire
[1:47:41.660 --> 1:47:48.540]  And then also on the war room we're going to be joined by an individual who is stationed in ukraine covering the events who wants to give us a
[1:47:48.540 --> 1:47:50.540]  first-hand account of what he
[1:47:50.540 --> 1:47:52.540]  sees
[1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:55.020]  Before we do that. Let me kind of prime this
[1:47:56.060 --> 1:48:00.220]  With the latest news and headlines from ukraine here. So
[1:48:01.260 --> 1:48:06.060]  You saw the u.n. head warning. It's bone chilling the possibility of now a nuclear conflict
[1:48:07.100 --> 1:48:09.100]  And and here's how I kind of see this going
[1:48:09.100 --> 1:48:14.300]  Because you have to kind of psychoanalyze the people involved and then
[1:48:15.420 --> 1:48:17.420]  If if possible
[1:48:17.580 --> 1:48:19.740]  And it's a challenge. Maybe not too many can do
[1:48:20.860 --> 1:48:26.700]  But if possible try to put yourself into their mindset to understand what they're thinking where they're coming from
[1:48:28.460 --> 1:48:32.060]  The globalists don't want to inherit a poisoned planet
[1:48:33.340 --> 1:48:36.460]  And so really the thought and concept of nuclear war is
[1:48:36.460 --> 1:48:44.780]  Basically just been a gun. They've held to the people's heads. I don't think they actually want nuclear war now. I understand you could
[1:48:46.220 --> 1:48:48.220]  Retort that and say
[1:48:48.780 --> 1:48:53.820]  Well, why do they do hundreds if not thousands of nuclear weapons tests around the planet if that's the case?
[1:48:53.820 --> 1:48:59.820]  Well, they don't do that in their backyard. They don't do that in the areas that they plan on conquering
[1:49:01.340 --> 1:49:03.340]  But nonetheless
[1:49:03.340 --> 1:49:09.900]  If they wanted to wipe out a billion people, they wouldn't do it with a nuke. They would do it with a bioweapon
[1:49:10.780 --> 1:49:12.780]  Like a virus or a vaccine
[1:49:14.300 --> 1:49:19.260]  And so that's why the bioweapons labs in ukraine is such an important story
[1:49:19.980 --> 1:49:25.500]  And that's why I think the chinese and the russians now are calling it out. Granted, you can sit here and say, hey
[1:49:25.500 --> 1:49:28.780]  Well, what about chinese biolabs? Okay, perfectly fair
[1:49:28.780 --> 1:49:32.780]  Contradictory stance to call out there from china
[1:49:33.740 --> 1:49:39.020]  But it's them working with western interests to do it anyway and the obvious question should be this
[1:49:40.460 --> 1:49:42.460]  Why in the hell?
[1:49:43.020 --> 1:49:45.020]  Does the u.s?
[1:49:45.420 --> 1:49:48.540]  Have biological labs in ukraine. Why would we be doing that in ukraine?
[1:49:49.580 --> 1:49:51.580]  Why would we be doing that on russia's doorstep?
[1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:57.900]  Well, it's a complex answer, but the same goes for the u.s.
[1:49:57.900 --> 1:50:00.940]  Complex answer, but the simple answer is because it's illegal here
[1:50:01.900 --> 1:50:04.540]  You can't do that research here. That's illegal
[1:50:05.580 --> 1:50:13.820]  And it was barack obama that spearheaded it in 2005 and 2014 to take all the illegal biological research
[1:50:13.980 --> 1:50:21.740]  And station it in ukraine and station it in china, which is on russia's front porch and back porch
[1:50:21.740 --> 1:50:29.100]  You combine that with the nato gun being pointed at russia's head for the last couple of decades
[1:50:30.220 --> 1:50:32.860]  Now you see why putin has run out of patience, but see
[1:50:34.380 --> 1:50:38.940]  They don't want nuclear war they'd rather kill off billions of people with a biological weapon
[1:50:39.500 --> 1:50:41.660]  And i don't think putin is on board with that
[1:50:42.380 --> 1:50:46.860]  That's why he's moving in through ukraine to get nato off of his front porch
[1:50:46.860 --> 1:50:52.780]  That's why he's moving in on these bio labs so that they can't be released on the planet
[1:50:54.140 --> 1:50:56.380]  And and oh, but you're not allowed to say that
[1:50:57.100 --> 1:51:00.700]  Because the globalist interest in ukraine and the globalist interest
[1:51:01.980 --> 1:51:05.020]  Of eugenics in this on this planet
[1:51:06.220 --> 1:51:09.180]  Cannot have any truth about putin coming out
[1:51:09.740 --> 1:51:12.540]  putin can be the most evil dictator in the world
[1:51:12.540 --> 1:51:17.740]  If he says we don't want biological labs in our front yard
[1:51:18.460 --> 1:51:20.940]  We're going to report on it. I don't care how many
[1:51:21.580 --> 1:51:28.140]  Times mit romney or or the view or these hosts on cnn and msnbc say we have to be arrested for our free speech
[1:51:29.660 --> 1:51:34.460]  Now an interesting development and and i'm going to get it actually i'm going to save this for shon stone
[1:51:34.700 --> 1:51:35.820]  There was a woman
[1:51:35.820 --> 1:51:40.700]  Well, I think is in court today or tomorrow who went on a russian tv broadcast
[1:51:40.700 --> 1:51:42.940]  And had a no-war sign
[1:51:45.420 --> 1:51:50.460]  My first instinct was this is straight-up propaganda and she's some sort of agent
[1:51:51.500 --> 1:51:54.460]  And and there's more evidence pouring in that that's the case
[1:51:55.100 --> 1:52:00.060]  But let me just put that on hold get into that with shon stone. I'd like his take on that. Here's some of the other headlines
[1:52:01.180 --> 1:52:07.020]  So linsky has now made a statement saying ukraine won't join nato. Will that lower the temperature in the region?
[1:52:07.020 --> 1:52:10.300]  ukrainian president zalinsky will also be addressing
[1:52:10.860 --> 1:52:12.860]  US congress tomorrow morning
[1:52:12.860 --> 1:52:17.980]  So that's going to be big. Is this going to be him begging and pleading or is this going to be him saying?
[1:52:18.540 --> 1:52:20.540]  Please stop. You're making things worse
[1:52:21.100 --> 1:52:23.100]  That's coming up tomorrow
[1:52:23.100 --> 1:52:27.980]  Russia has now sanctioned the us in a turn of events and you know what?
[1:52:28.540 --> 1:52:30.540]  It's the corrupt leaders of our country
[1:52:31.500 --> 1:52:33.500]  joe biden
[1:52:33.500 --> 1:52:35.020]  tony blinkin
[1:52:35.020 --> 1:52:37.020]  tony blinkin
[1:52:37.100 --> 1:52:38.460]  Lloyd austin
[1:52:38.460 --> 1:52:44.780]  Other administration officials and I believe there might even be a little clinton action in there as well. Yes, hillary clinton, too
[1:52:46.380 --> 1:52:51.420]  Uh gen sake jake sullivan the cia director mark milley
[1:52:52.220 --> 1:52:54.220]  so, you know
[1:52:54.300 --> 1:52:56.300]  I can hate putin or I can love putin
[1:52:56.860 --> 1:53:01.020]  Putin is not even in the top one hundred when it comes to
[1:53:01.020 --> 1:53:07.340]  Enemies of america. Putin is not even in the top 100 when it comes to threats to america sovereignty. He's not
[1:53:07.740 --> 1:53:14.060]  That's a fictional tale that you're being told by our corrupt media and politicians
[1:53:14.460 --> 1:53:20.620]  You know, who's a much bigger threat hillary clinton? You know, who's a much bigger threat joe biden gen sake?
[1:53:21.420 --> 1:53:23.980]  uh, tony blinkin and and the list goes on so
[1:53:25.180 --> 1:53:29.180]  Now putin is sanctioned all those people so again, I could hate putin
[1:53:29.180 --> 1:53:33.180]  I could say putin is the biggest dictator worse warmonger on the planet
[1:53:33.820 --> 1:53:35.820]  but boy, he seems to be
[1:53:36.780 --> 1:53:38.700]  Going after the worst
[1:53:38.700 --> 1:53:43.180]  Americans he's going after the most corrupt elements of the american political regime
[1:53:43.820 --> 1:53:48.380]  So at the very least I would scratch my head and say well, that's an interesting development
[1:53:49.900 --> 1:53:53.020]  If you had a list of 100 people that are the biggest threat to america
[1:53:53.500 --> 1:53:55.500]  Putin just sanctioned 15 of them
[1:53:55.500 --> 1:53:59.100]  And he's not even cracking the top 100
[1:54:01.420 --> 1:54:08.300]  So what does that really mean probably just more symbolic than anything else? I don't think it's gonna matter anything's gonna happen to them
[1:54:08.940 --> 1:54:15.660]  Uh, but what if putin came in here? What if putin invaded america and said i'm coming in to arrest the biden's and the clinton's
[1:54:17.740 --> 1:54:21.260]  And away that's kind of what he did in ukraine folks, but uh moving on
[1:54:21.260 --> 1:54:27.020]  Biden advisor wars china will face consequences if it helps russia evade sanctions
[1:54:27.500 --> 1:54:29.500]  Jake sullivan, let me tell you something this
[1:54:30.140 --> 1:54:32.140]  Sniveling weasel
[1:54:32.300 --> 1:54:34.300]  This sniveling dweeb
[1:54:34.860 --> 1:54:38.060]  Jake sullivan is a is an embarrassment
[1:54:39.420 --> 1:54:43.180]  The chinese delegation laughed jake sullivan out of the room
[1:54:44.780 --> 1:54:48.540]  So a nothing a nitwit a zero a ratfink
[1:54:48.540 --> 1:54:52.540]  Jake sullivan after failing in negotiations with china
[1:54:53.260 --> 1:54:55.500]  Just way over his head. I mean that's like taking a
[1:54:56.460 --> 1:55:01.900]  That's like taking a 10-year-old peewee football player and telling him to go play quarterback
[1:55:02.300 --> 1:55:07.820]  For the los angeles rams. I mean that's a joke. He's gonna get sacked. He's gonna fumble. You're gonna lose the game
[1:55:08.060 --> 1:55:14.220]  That's the equivalent of sending jake sullivan to go have diplomatic conversations with china. They laugh
[1:55:14.220 --> 1:55:19.100]  So now so so jake sullivan is to add to his stupidity
[1:55:19.820 --> 1:55:23.980]  He comes back home and he says china better cooperate
[1:55:24.700 --> 1:55:26.700]  Or it will face consequences
[1:55:27.100 --> 1:55:29.820]  further pushing china into russia's arms
[1:55:32.220 --> 1:55:34.220]  What a
[1:55:34.220 --> 1:55:36.220]  Fool
[1:55:36.220 --> 1:55:41.500]  Jake sullivan is a bigger threat to this country than latimer putin and he's now been sanctioned by putin
[1:55:41.500 --> 1:55:48.860]  Yeah, you think that's smart after you've embarrassed yourself and diplomatic negotiations with china to then come back and threaten china
[1:55:50.060 --> 1:55:52.060]  What an idiot
[1:55:54.940 --> 1:56:00.540]  Saudi Arabia invites china jid china jid to visit kingdom amid strained u.s relations. Good job sullivan
[1:56:01.260 --> 1:56:03.260]  Oh, and and what are they discussing?
[1:56:05.820 --> 1:56:07.820]  Purchasing oil
[1:56:07.980 --> 1:56:09.980]  Without the u.s. Docs
[1:56:09.980 --> 1:56:14.620]  Without the u.s. Dollar, but with the chinese yuan. Good job jake sullivan
[1:56:17.340 --> 1:56:24.540]  So when you see the value of the u.s. Dollar tank and you see foreign nations no longer purchasing oil with the u.s. Dollar
[1:56:25.020 --> 1:56:30.460]  You can thank jake sullivan for that way to go jake sullivan way to go biden administration
[1:56:32.460 --> 1:56:36.620]  You like traveling around the world and the strength of the u.s. Dollar that's gone
[1:56:36.620 --> 1:56:44.940]  You like the prosperity of of of living in america. That's gone and you can thank jake sullivan for it
[1:56:47.100 --> 1:56:51.820]  Americans can't afford gas congress just gave itself a 21% raise can you imagine that
[1:56:52.460 --> 1:56:58.620]  Can you imagine the boldness of congress to give itself a raise in these times it shows you how evil they are
[1:56:58.620 --> 1:57:06.380]  By the way, it was only a small handful of republicans that voted against it. I think it was like 20-some republicans that voted against it
[1:57:07.180 --> 1:57:10.300]  But the rest voted to give themselves a raise now
[1:57:12.060 --> 1:57:19.260]  Like the annual salary of a house member just went from 174,000 to 200,000 dollars
[1:57:19.260 --> 1:57:24.140]  Do you think there do you think they deserve 200,000 dollars a year as they crush this country?
[1:57:24.140 --> 1:57:31.180]  Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. All right. I'm gonna finish up with this coverage in the next short segment
[1:57:31.660 --> 1:57:33.660]  And then shan stone joins me
[1:57:34.140 --> 1:57:40.140]  In studio, but just know folks jake sullivan just butchered international relations
[1:57:40.620 --> 1:57:44.380]  With china and now congress is stealing more money from us
[1:57:45.100 --> 1:57:48.300]  It's hard to believe that we're already into march
[1:57:48.780 --> 1:57:51.660]  2022 and in the month of february
[1:57:51.660 --> 1:57:57.900]  And in the month of february, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product x3
[1:57:58.380 --> 1:58:02.940]  That has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every
[1:58:03.660 --> 1:58:04.780]  electrochemical
[1:58:04.780 --> 1:58:09.500]  Cellular activity in your body your immune system your stamina your libido
[1:58:09.980 --> 1:58:16.140]  So much and the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine output
[1:58:16.140 --> 1:58:22.220]  So we have on sale 50 off, but we sold more than half of what we have or isn't going to come in for a long time
[1:58:22.460 --> 1:58:28.140]  So I took it back to full process. I was just thinking you know what we need to funds in now to stay on air
[1:58:28.460 --> 1:58:30.460]  Plus this is the right product everybody needs
[1:58:30.860 --> 1:58:36.620]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get x3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast
[1:58:37.020 --> 1:58:44.860]  I'm going to keep it at 50 off until it sells out get x3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50 off
[1:58:44.860 --> 1:58:47.980]  It has been noted by many a historian
[1:58:48.620 --> 1:58:51.420]  The first casualty of war is the truth
[1:58:52.060 --> 1:58:54.060]  Then the next big casualty
[1:58:54.140 --> 1:58:56.140]  Is it even the people that die?
[1:58:56.780 --> 1:58:58.780]  No, that invariably follows
[1:58:58.940 --> 1:59:04.940]  But first there is the crackdown on populations basic liberty and speech
[1:59:05.420 --> 1:59:09.980]  And massive censorship and now across the world from the united states to europe
[1:59:10.540 --> 1:59:12.540]  Legislations being introduced
[1:59:12.540 --> 1:59:14.540]  That if you
[1:59:14.620 --> 1:59:16.140]  amplify
[1:59:16.140 --> 1:59:20.540]  Any quote pro-russian information you can be censored
[1:59:21.340 --> 1:59:22.780]  You can be arrested
[1:59:22.780 --> 1:59:26.460]  You can be a prisoner and of course now Canada's under this legislation
[1:59:27.020 --> 1:59:28.540]  That if you have a
[1:59:28.540 --> 1:59:32.220]  Fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage
[1:59:32.780 --> 1:59:36.380]  In hate speech online that you will be censored and arrested
[1:59:36.380 --> 1:59:42.540]  Ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity
[1:59:42.780 --> 1:59:45.020]  That makes info wars.com more important than ever
[1:59:48.780 --> 1:59:52.780]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:00:00.460 --> 2:00:04.860]  Take the highway to the end of the night
[2:00:04.860 --> 2:00:06.860]  End of the night
[2:00:06.860 --> 2:00:08.860]  End of the night
[2:00:08.860 --> 2:00:10.860]  End of the night
[2:00:10.860 --> 2:00:12.860]  Continuing here with the latest
[2:00:14.860 --> 2:00:16.860]  Out of Ukraine
[2:00:16.860 --> 2:00:18.860]  I'm telling you folks
[2:00:18.860 --> 2:00:26.860]  It's uh here's the problem is that the western media and our politicians are so corrupted and they've lied about pretty much everything
[2:00:26.860 --> 2:00:30.860]  Out of Ukraine for the last three weeks or or what have you
[2:00:30.860 --> 2:00:32.860]  and
[2:00:32.860 --> 2:00:36.460]  Now you're starting to see some of the truth come out
[2:00:36.940 --> 2:00:44.300]  And it's just been egg on the face of the biden administration from the biolabs to the migs with poland and germany
[2:00:45.260 --> 2:00:49.260]  To the sanctions not working to the oil prices going up
[2:00:49.820 --> 2:00:51.820]  And and now even EU
[2:00:52.700 --> 2:00:55.020]  Countries are saying uh, yeah, we're we're not
[2:00:56.540 --> 2:01:01.580]  We're not doing santa russia stuff that the us is trying to do to us. We're not doing it
[2:01:01.580 --> 2:01:03.580]  And it's more trump was right
[2:01:05.580 --> 2:01:11.580]  Boycott of russian gas and oil could cause mass poverty in germany. So germany is saying we're out
[2:01:12.540 --> 2:01:18.140]  We're not we're not getting involved in this ukrainian conflict. We're not getting involved in sanctions. We're out and and that's kind of
[2:01:19.100 --> 2:01:22.700]  Germany typically sets the standard for the EU
[2:01:23.900 --> 2:01:26.780]  In response to this type of international stuff
[2:01:27.660 --> 2:01:29.660]  So that means the EU's out
[2:01:29.660 --> 2:01:32.780]  And you still have seen nothing from nato
[2:01:33.020 --> 2:01:38.540]  So I think nato is a complete non factor in all of this except for putin wanting to get rid of them on his doorstep
[2:01:39.660 --> 2:01:47.980]  So they keep saying oh russia's losing russia's russia's doomed russia can't feed its troops russia can't put gas in its vehicles russia's done
[2:01:50.300 --> 2:01:52.300]  There where's your evidence of that
[2:01:52.300 --> 2:01:58.700]  Quite frankly, I don't really see anybody winning except that russia is taking the territories at once
[2:02:00.300 --> 2:02:03.580]  And the sanctions aren't really doing a damn thing
[2:02:04.300 --> 2:02:06.300]  And it's western leaders
[2:02:07.420 --> 2:02:12.140]  And the by the administration that has the egg on their face looking like the lying
[2:02:13.100 --> 2:02:15.100]  Stooges that they are
[2:02:15.100 --> 2:02:18.700]  So it's just more egg on the face of the american media
[2:02:19.660 --> 2:02:22.460]  And of the biden administration
[2:02:23.660 --> 2:02:33.100]  But so see you're seeing these stories come out. Oh china's being devastated china. Oh russia's devastated towards 100 billion dollar default nightmare folks
[2:02:35.100 --> 2:02:39.660]  The u.s. Government is what 30 trillion in debt now. I mean the numbers just insane
[2:02:39.660 --> 2:02:44.860]  So all these nations are in financial ruin. It's it's mutually agreed
[2:02:47.260 --> 2:02:51.820]  It's like the the credit bubble the debt bubble. It's just so massive
[2:02:52.460 --> 2:02:58.460]  That that all the countries have agreed and I guess the IMF is just gonna say okay. Well, everybody's just gonna live in debt for the rest of eternity
[2:02:59.260 --> 2:03:00.780]  Or
[2:03:00.780 --> 2:03:02.780]  They're gonna have the world great reset
[2:03:02.780 --> 2:03:04.780]  And they're gonna have the world great reset
[2:03:04.780 --> 2:03:10.380]  which is the case and so all I think vladimir putin is thinking is
[2:03:12.060 --> 2:03:14.060]  Okay, you're gonna do a great reset
[2:03:14.060 --> 2:03:19.820]  We're gonna do a great reset, but it's gonna be the russian great reset and we're gonna strategically
[2:03:20.940 --> 2:03:22.940]  Move into ukraine
[2:03:22.940 --> 2:03:29.820]  So that when we do the russian reset we're much better off than if we went under the new world order great reset
[2:03:29.820 --> 2:03:34.700]  Our leaders aren't thinking that our leaders are willing to let america get crushed by the great reset
[2:03:35.420 --> 2:03:39.100]  Putin doesn't seem to have that same mentality towards his people
[2:03:40.460 --> 2:03:43.580]  adam kinsinger is a total wuss bag
[2:03:44.460 --> 2:03:46.460]  Tucker Carlson invited him on his show
[2:03:47.020 --> 2:03:50.540]  And he rejected and then went on to twitter to say
[2:03:51.580 --> 2:03:54.060]  Tucker Carlson is an agent of vladimir putin
[2:03:54.060 --> 2:03:59.420]  And he only cares about the ukrainian people. I'm not even kidding you. That's what adam kinsinger said in his statement. So
[2:04:00.380 --> 2:04:03.020]  More proof that adam kinsinger is just a complete hack
[2:04:06.220 --> 2:04:12.540]  Russian spies infiltrated ukraine's international volunteers to launch missile attack folks. I gotta tell you
[2:04:13.820 --> 2:04:17.900]  There's there's false flags happening in ukraine. I mean, let's just call it what it is
[2:04:18.780 --> 2:04:20.780]  There's obviously a russian invasion
[2:04:20.780 --> 2:04:24.540]  There's obviously skirmishes. There's obviously bombs and missiles and everything, but
[2:04:25.260 --> 2:04:28.140]  There are false flag attacks that they're blaming russia
[2:04:28.780 --> 2:04:32.460]  And it's proxy groups. It's infiltrators. It's spies
[2:04:33.900 --> 2:04:35.900]  And it's odd too. You see all these
[2:04:37.260 --> 2:04:44.140]  Civilian buildings getting bombed or it's like the missiles miss the building and maybe blow out a side of it or hit the ground and blow out some windows
[2:04:44.700 --> 2:04:46.700]  Who's really doing that?
[2:04:47.340 --> 2:04:49.340]  Who is acting as a spy?
[2:04:49.340 --> 2:04:53.260]  Who is actually doing that in ukraine?
[2:04:57.900 --> 2:04:59.900]  Two of our best-selling products are back in stock
[2:05:00.540 --> 2:05:07.100]  Then fullwarstore.com and they will sell out in the next three four months before I get more of the product in if I sell it at full price
[2:05:07.580 --> 2:05:11.340]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or son
[2:05:11.660 --> 2:05:16.860]  Or getting x3 to try the products and see how amazing they are and I believe
[2:05:16.860 --> 2:05:22.220]  He will then get hooked on them by myself and my family and the crew are so again
[2:05:22.300 --> 2:05:25.660]  Both these products are back in stock both x3 and winter sun
[2:05:25.980 --> 2:05:31.340]  They are 50 off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price
[2:05:31.740 --> 2:05:34.140]  I would estimate in less than a month
[2:05:34.620 --> 2:05:39.020]  So this is your chance to get x3 and experience the good halogens or some of the bad halogens
[2:05:39.260 --> 2:05:43.820]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin d3 with vitamin k for your immune system as well
[2:05:43.820 --> 2:05:50.060]  They're amazing and they're an info war store.com. The reason this is 360 win is it funds the operation
[2:05:50.700 --> 2:05:55.740]  I need funds to run the operation. You need to be healthy. We need to stay on air. It's a match made in heaven
[2:05:55.740 --> 2:06:17.340]  Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the alex joneshow and now your host owin shroyer
[2:06:25.740 --> 2:06:41.100]  All right, folks, we're having a
[2:06:41.820 --> 2:06:45.500]  A bit of a schedule realignment here. I think due to some
[2:06:47.340 --> 2:06:53.820]  Time zone confusion plus the ridiculousness of daylight savings time, which just needs to be ended at this point
[2:06:53.820 --> 2:06:55.500]  It's just a complete joke
[2:06:55.500 --> 2:06:57.020]  but
[2:06:57.020 --> 2:06:58.380]  Aside from that
[2:06:58.380 --> 2:07:02.140]  Sean stone is a little bit delayed and so he will be in studio
[2:07:02.220 --> 2:07:07.260]  Hopefully at 130 is what we're hoping now and then and then we're just going to have him back on in studio for the war room
[2:07:07.580 --> 2:07:11.340]  And and since i'm mentioning that we got huge guests coming up on the war room today
[2:07:11.340 --> 2:07:15.820]  We've got an individual who's in ukraine wants to give us on the ground reporting from there
[2:07:16.620 --> 2:07:18.140]  Sean stone as well
[2:07:18.140 --> 2:07:24.940]  Tyler nixon attorney is going to be joining us to discuss all kinds of different legal issues including a disgusting case ladies and gentlemen
[2:07:24.940 --> 2:07:27.820]  That that i really want to make a big deal of and i know i've been covering it for a week
[2:07:27.820 --> 2:07:33.180]  But it needs to be a much bigger deal than it is where democrats can now get away with murder
[2:07:35.260 --> 2:07:42.380]  You think that sounds and that sounds extreme. Yeah, i ain't lying folks democrats can now get away with murder as long as you kill
[2:07:42.380 --> 2:07:45.900]  A trump supporter in cold blood. Yeah, that's how bad it is in this country now
[2:07:45.900 --> 2:07:49.100]  That's how bad the left has become in this country
[2:07:50.620 --> 2:07:56.140]  From their street thug goon criminals to their sorrows operatives in the judicial system
[2:07:56.780 --> 2:08:00.780]  Democrats can now get away with murder if they kill in cold blood a trump supporter
[2:08:00.780 --> 2:08:06.380]  It's a ritualistic thing for them now. So i would expect it to continue since they continue to get away with it
[2:08:07.020 --> 2:08:09.020]  and then
[2:08:09.100 --> 2:08:14.860]  Savannah Hernandez will be joining us. She was at the pro pedophile rally here in austin texas
[2:08:14.860 --> 2:08:18.140]  And then they were out again at georgia tech yesterday
[2:08:18.940 --> 2:08:20.940]  It's this new phenomenon folks
[2:08:21.260 --> 2:08:29.100]  Trans kids trans rights. It's all fake. There's no such thing as trans kids. There's no such thing as trans rights
[2:08:29.260 --> 2:08:32.620]  It's this made-up thing by the left to virtue signal as a victim
[2:08:33.420 --> 2:08:35.500]  Where there is where there is nothing to be had there
[2:08:36.220 --> 2:08:41.660]  It's a empty shell of a protest, but they're at it again. So we'll get the latest on that too
[2:08:41.660 --> 2:08:49.740]  We're on air because of your support at info wars store.com and and we are happy to announce
[2:08:51.020 --> 2:08:55.820]  Back in stock a very popular item that always sells out
[2:08:56.460 --> 2:09:02.380]  I mean this thing usually sells out within a week or a month of us getting it back in stock. It's back in stock today
[2:09:04.140 --> 2:09:07.820]  Vitamin d3 with calcium gummies
[2:09:07.820 --> 2:09:11.580]  Back in stock at info wars.com
[2:09:12.620 --> 2:09:15.740]  Kids love these folks kids love these
[2:09:16.380 --> 2:09:18.220]  And let me just tell you
[2:09:18.220 --> 2:09:20.940]  They're intentionally blocking out the sun
[2:09:21.580 --> 2:09:27.580]  By spraying chemicals into the air. You may remember now even cnn is admitting that's an ongoing operation
[2:09:28.220 --> 2:09:32.860]  So you have globalists that want to stop you from getting the essential
[2:09:32.860 --> 2:09:37.340]  Rays from the sun. That's vitamin d3
[2:09:38.460 --> 2:09:40.460]  That's how disgusting
[2:09:40.620 --> 2:09:49.820]  That's how despicable our government is they intentionally try to block out the sun with cloud seeding and and geoengineering and chemtrailing
[2:09:50.060 --> 2:09:54.700]  Which now even cnn admits has been going on since the 1940s. So you may notice
[2:09:55.020 --> 2:10:00.540]  Hey, how come I never see the sun anymore? How come these lines are always in the sky and then I don't see the sun for two days
[2:10:00.540 --> 2:10:02.860]  It's all by design folks
[2:10:03.500 --> 2:10:07.900]  The people that are trying to conquer this planet are trying to block you from getting the essential
[2:10:08.860 --> 2:10:13.180]  Vitamin d3 from the sun's rays the giver of life
[2:10:14.300 --> 2:10:16.780]  That's why ancient civilizations worshiped the sun
[2:10:18.140 --> 2:10:21.820]  And so the disgusting globalists want to block it out
[2:10:22.780 --> 2:10:29.420]  But we have the answer vitamin d3 with calcium gummies at info wars store.com and telling you kids love these good for adults too
[2:10:29.420 --> 2:10:30.780]  Obviously
[2:10:30.780 --> 2:10:37.420]  And they're finally back in stock at info wars store.com and we are glad to make that announcement
[2:10:38.060 --> 2:10:39.820]  today
[2:10:39.820 --> 2:10:41.820]  all right
[2:10:44.220 --> 2:10:46.620]  All right, let's uh
[2:10:49.100 --> 2:10:52.300]  Finish up here with some of this ukraine news and then get to some other stuff
[2:10:52.300 --> 2:11:03.500]  Fox news uh camera man pierre zakhrawinsky zakhrawinsky. I'm sorry. I'm not intentionally mispronounced that it's a tough one
[2:11:04.300 --> 2:11:06.780]  um has died in ukraine
[2:11:07.820 --> 2:11:13.100]  And I believe this is the third american either journalist or camera man to have died in ukraine now
[2:11:14.300 --> 2:11:19.580]  And um, you know, they blamed russia on the first one and it ended up being ukraine
[2:11:19.580 --> 2:11:25.180]  So it's probably the same case here. This individual is probably killed by uh, ukrainian fire
[2:11:25.420 --> 2:11:29.020]  Just like the other individual, but they haven't really committed to a narrative there, but you know
[2:11:30.460 --> 2:11:32.460]  How does that make you feel adam kinsinger?
[2:11:34.620 --> 2:11:37.100]  How does that make you feel lindsey graham?
[2:11:38.140 --> 2:11:41.740]  americans are now dying in ukraine because of your
[2:11:42.300 --> 2:11:45.340]  Warmongering and you promoting of them being over there
[2:11:45.340 --> 2:11:49.900]  I hope that makes you feels really good. So more blood
[2:11:51.580 --> 2:11:56.940]  More blood on the hands of the neocons and the neolibs promoting this war with ukraine
[2:11:57.580 --> 2:12:04.220]  Promoting americans to go over there. By the way, british shoulders have been killed too. They blamed russia that might end up being ukraine as well
[2:12:04.300 --> 2:12:09.100]  That's just how it goes folks. Just everything they say ends up being a lie. So sorry that that's the
[2:12:09.980 --> 2:12:13.500]  uh intellectual approach I take to this maybe not the healthiest
[2:12:13.500 --> 2:12:18.700]  But uh, that's just been what has how the story has unfolded every time
[2:12:19.260 --> 2:12:23.020]  It's whatever they say the opposite ends up being true. So they say oh
[2:12:23.500 --> 2:12:28.540]  Russia killed this new york times journalist and then it's oh never mind. It was a spy in ukraine killed them
[2:12:30.460 --> 2:12:32.460]  But regardless of that
[2:12:33.260 --> 2:12:38.380]  I hope all the neocons and the neolibs that have been promoting this war and promoting people going over there
[2:12:38.380 --> 2:12:44.220]  I hope you feel good with all that blood on your hands or maybe you can't even see all the blood on your hands because of all the
[2:12:44.220 --> 2:12:48.940]  Money you've made investing in the defense contractor companies stocks
[2:12:51.180 --> 2:12:54.060]  Because that's what it's all about folks because they're addicted to it
[2:12:55.420 --> 2:13:02.700]  They're addicted to it and they need those stocks to take off so they can cash out and buy a new vacation home
[2:13:03.020 --> 2:13:05.020]  And it makes me sick
[2:13:05.020 --> 2:13:11.900]  How's the u.s. Military doing though by the way, well this might give you an idea
[2:13:13.020 --> 2:13:16.700]  The Undersecretary of the Air Force Gina Ortiz Jones
[2:13:18.780 --> 2:13:24.940]  Reporting for duty great conversation with our lgbtq initiatives team
[2:13:24.940 --> 2:13:36.540]  An lgbtq initiatives team in the u.s. Army you have got to be freaking kidding me
[2:13:38.380 --> 2:13:41.340]  You think china has a lgbtq initiatives team
[2:13:42.460 --> 2:13:45.580]  Do you think russia has an lgbtq initiatives team?
[2:13:47.020 --> 2:13:49.020]  Ha
[2:13:49.580 --> 2:13:51.660]  Know that out
[2:13:51.660 --> 2:13:53.660]  No, they don't
[2:13:53.660 --> 2:13:58.300]  But see this is all about the conquering of america. This is all about the conquering of our military
[2:13:59.260 --> 2:14:02.700]  And replacing hard patriotic men and women
[2:14:03.340 --> 2:14:05.340]  with foppish
[2:14:05.420 --> 2:14:07.020]  gays
[2:14:07.020 --> 2:14:10.700]  Who get in there to diversity diversify the military?
[2:14:11.260 --> 2:14:14.140]  No combat experience not even the will to fight
[2:14:14.780 --> 2:14:16.940]  I mean you you can sit here and say
[2:14:18.860 --> 2:14:21.980]  I mean look, I'll be perfectly honest because I know the type
[2:14:21.980 --> 2:14:27.580]  There's people that get involved in the u.s. Military because they like to fight
[2:14:28.860 --> 2:14:31.820]  And they want to channel that energy into uh
[2:14:32.780 --> 2:14:36.700]  Into being in the army and then going off to fight and that's what they like
[2:14:38.140 --> 2:14:40.140]  Well, let me tell you you could say that's dangerous
[2:14:40.700 --> 2:14:47.980]  That is 10 billion times better than to have somebody going into the military so they can make it more gay
[2:14:47.980 --> 2:14:56.780]  Or they can promote transsexuals in the military and launch lgbtq initiatives team. What a joke
[2:14:58.700 --> 2:15:00.700]  That's our military
[2:15:00.940 --> 2:15:05.580]  That's general milley. That's loyde austin sanctioned by vladimir putin
[2:15:06.460 --> 2:15:13.340]  So so think about it like this vladimir putin is doing more to drain the swamp in america than anybody here is
[2:15:13.340 --> 2:15:19.900]  I mean you could even say vladimir putin has done more than donald trump to drain the swamp
[2:15:22.060 --> 2:15:24.300]  I don't remember trump going after these people
[2:15:25.580 --> 2:15:28.940]  He took their abuse for four years and took no action
[2:15:29.980 --> 2:15:32.940]  Putin has actually taken action against these criminal scum bags
[2:15:34.140 --> 2:15:35.820]  But don't worry guys
[2:15:35.820 --> 2:15:40.220]  Don't worry the big big bad gay army is going to defeat
[2:15:40.220 --> 2:15:46.940]  The chinese and the russian militaries which are which are clearly getting closer to a strong military alliance
[2:15:47.980 --> 2:15:53.820]  Uh, but don't worry the big gay army of milley and austin. They'll be there to rescue. Yeah, right?
[2:15:56.620 --> 2:15:59.340]  So I did it I signed up for the austin marathon
[2:15:59.500 --> 2:16:05.500]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for info wars
[2:16:05.500 --> 2:16:11.980]  Store.com before I start out on a run. I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy
[2:16:11.980 --> 2:16:15.260]  I need to get going, you know besides the energy turbo force
[2:16:15.660 --> 2:16:21.020]  It is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin c to keep me healthy and the essential b vitamins
[2:16:21.180 --> 2:16:27.500]  Plus the amino acids for sustained energy giving me the best chance at getting through the training and then every day now
[2:16:27.580 --> 2:16:29.340]  I'm taking dr. Jones
[2:16:29.340 --> 2:16:35.900]  Soros, I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now
[2:16:35.900 --> 2:16:41.980]  Plus inflammation support and extra flexibility the quick release capsules help me recover fast
[2:16:42.220 --> 2:16:46.620]  So I can get back to the training even if you are not crazy enough to take on a marathon
[2:16:46.860 --> 2:16:51.500]  Good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day
[2:16:51.900 --> 2:16:54.860]  And soros can keep you moving and feeling great at any age
[2:16:54.860 --> 2:17:03.260]  Jacob and ohio welcome go ahead. Hey, how's it going alex? Good, uh, great last caller

[2:17:45.580 --> 2:17:48.860]  So just number one for you. Oh, it definitely works. It's not a joke
[2:17:48.860 --> 2:17:50.860]  Yeah, absolutely
[2:17:55.100 --> 2:17:57.660]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming
[2:17:57.820 --> 2:18:02.860]  They're here all over the world from australia to the united states from canada to germany
[2:18:03.020 --> 2:18:08.540]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases
[2:18:08.620 --> 2:18:15.980]  Actually taking people away into the night to their facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their
[2:18:15.980 --> 2:18:21.740]  Shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety
[2:18:21.900 --> 2:18:25.340]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back
[2:18:25.580 --> 2:18:30.620]  Is to get high quality faraday cages many of which are made here in america and are very compliant
[2:18:30.780 --> 2:18:34.860]  Meaning us government military grade at info war store dot com
[2:18:34.940 --> 2:18:40.460]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit info war store dot com
[2:18:40.700 --> 2:18:45.180]  Again, we have big backpacks. We have special dry bags. We've got them for cell phones

[2:18:50.380 --> 2:18:55.100]  So protect your privacy today and supporting info war at info war store dot com
[2:18:56.140 --> 2:19:02.380]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their covet biomedical tyranny
[2:19:03.020 --> 2:19:06.380]  Lockdowns until the populations rebelled
[2:19:06.780 --> 2:19:11.980]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[2:19:11.980 --> 2:19:15.180]  Anybody that speaks out against their lives
[2:19:15.740 --> 2:19:19.180]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others
[2:19:19.740 --> 2:19:21.740]  Coming public and whistleblowers
[2:19:22.380 --> 2:19:30.060]  Now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover
[2:19:30.700 --> 2:19:33.500]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever
[2:19:34.060 --> 2:19:39.180]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover like canada
[2:19:39.180 --> 2:19:43.900]  But they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in ontario
[2:19:44.460 --> 2:19:49.100]  And other areas of the world are following suit like australia. So pray for these folks big time
[2:19:49.340 --> 2:19:55.020]  It's a very serious situation and stay tuned into info wars dot com because truth is absolutely paramount
[2:19:55.020 --> 2:20:10.940]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[2:20:25.980 --> 2:20:31.980]  I want to take a look at some of the political news happening in america here
[2:20:33.820 --> 2:20:37.500]  Before we are joined by an in-studio guest coming up rand paul
[2:20:39.180 --> 2:20:44.300]  Introducing the fauci amendment to prevent health dictatorship. Thank you rand paul
[2:20:45.020 --> 2:20:48.780]  Next it's time for fauci to be tried in a criminal court of law
[2:20:49.260 --> 2:20:53.260]  Not just lying under oath but crimes against humanity for his involvement
[2:20:53.260 --> 2:20:55.260]  In the wuhan lab
[2:20:56.380 --> 2:20:59.420]  And in all of the destructive policies that he promoted
[2:21:00.620 --> 2:21:03.660]  From vaccine mandates mass mandates lockdowns and everything else
[2:21:04.220 --> 2:21:11.340]  Uh, I wish fauci would just go away, but since he won't maybe there needs to be criminal trials
[2:21:11.420 --> 2:21:14.780]  So that we have to put him into a jail cell for all of his crimes
[2:21:14.860 --> 2:21:17.660]  But it does appear that the reason why fauci is protected
[2:21:17.660 --> 2:21:30.780]  Is fauci is not a health care bureaucrat fauci is not doctor fauci of the n i h or whatever it is
[2:21:31.260 --> 2:21:37.420]  Fauci is actually the head of the us biological weapons program and that's why he's being protected
[2:21:38.620 --> 2:21:43.260]  Fauci is the head it appears to me that fauci is the head of the us biological weapons program
[2:21:43.260 --> 2:21:47.420]  Posing as a health bureaucrat and uh
[2:21:48.220 --> 2:21:52.940]  Well, it's it's it's just it's time for a full investigation to be done to anthony fauci with the crimes
[2:21:52.940 --> 2:21:54.940]  He's committed against humanity for decades now
[2:21:56.380 --> 2:22:00.620]  Democrat midterm chief sean patrick maloney. We are the problem
[2:22:01.740 --> 2:22:07.420]  We are the problem. Yes, uh, non radicalized democrats that aren't fully
[2:22:07.420 --> 2:22:14.620]  Communist leftist uh progressives etc are realizing that their party is dead
[2:22:15.100 --> 2:22:20.780]  If it continues to go the way of defund the police major crimes censorship war
[2:22:22.140 --> 2:22:24.380]  And just quite frankly complete insanity
[2:22:25.500 --> 2:22:27.500]  So that's why centrist or or
[2:22:29.020 --> 2:22:32.700]  Non insane democrats are saying hey, we got to check ourselves because
[2:22:33.660 --> 2:22:35.660]  We're wrecking ourselves here
[2:22:35.660 --> 2:22:39.740]  The real answer is to just abandon the democrat party and just let it die
[2:22:40.460 --> 2:22:46.300]  Uh, because the democrat party has been the biggest terror group in the united states of america for over a century
[2:22:47.660 --> 2:22:54.220]  I mean, i'm not going to sit here and and and go into civil war history, but uh, you know, it was democrats that uh
[2:22:55.340 --> 2:22:58.220]  Went after fort sumpter and again. I'm not going to get into all that stuff
[2:22:58.220 --> 2:23:04.300]  But it's democrats with the the kkk it's uh democrats like bill ares blowing up government buildings
[2:23:04.300 --> 2:23:07.500]  It's democrats that burn cities to the ground and the riots of 2020
[2:23:07.500 --> 2:23:09.500]  So i mean, you know, you just go on it's always the democrats
[2:23:09.900 --> 2:23:13.020]  Uh destroying public parks and ripping statues down
[2:23:14.140 --> 2:23:20.380]  Killing millions of babies always democrats, but see they're protected. They're protected. They're a protected class now
[2:23:21.500 --> 2:23:28.540]  Only conservatives in america can be punished by law enforcement now democrats literally get away with murder
[2:23:29.660 --> 2:23:33.260]  But uh, oh you were on the wrong piece of cement on january 6th
[2:23:33.260 --> 2:23:39.340]  Uh, or not even in dc. They're coming after you. Oh, you question the 2020 election and they make sure to put it there
[2:23:39.900 --> 2:23:44.780]  Uh, mayorkas only if you question the 2020 election. Can you be subject to being called a terrorist?
[2:23:45.020 --> 2:23:50.780]  Oh, you don't like vaccine mandates. You're a terrorist. It's it's the biden administration wanting to make all
[2:23:51.660 --> 2:23:53.660]  its political opposition
[2:23:53.660 --> 2:23:56.860]  Terrorists so that they can put us all in jail ladies and gentlemen
[2:23:57.180 --> 2:24:00.140]  Believe me when i tell you because i'm at the top of their list
[2:24:00.140 --> 2:24:09.100]  I've got the democrat party and the federal government sucking on my stuck on clawing at my back sucking at my neck like a freaking vampire
[2:24:10.700 --> 2:24:14.140]  Trust me. It's not fun, but they're coming for you next
[2:24:15.740 --> 2:24:23.260]  No integrity 60 minutes commits journalism fraud in dishonest expose on wisconsin election investigation. Yeah, the state
[2:24:23.260 --> 2:24:30.780]  Uh legislators in wisconsin have basically said, yeah, biden didn't win here. Clearly election theft. Here's all the evidence
[2:24:30.780 --> 2:24:33.020]  I mean folks they've they they voted to
[2:24:33.660 --> 2:24:39.820]  Decertify the election now. This is at the state level so it's not where it needs to be fully and i'm not saying it's going to matter in time
[2:24:41.340 --> 2:24:44.460]  That's kind of a long shot miracle if you will
[2:24:45.100 --> 2:24:51.820]  But uh, no the state legislator there in wisconsin has 100 decided that biden did not win the state
[2:24:51.820 --> 2:24:53.820]  And there was election fraud rampant
[2:24:54.140 --> 2:24:59.740]  But oh oh see now the biden administration says i'm a terrorist because i'm actually covering that news
[2:24:59.980 --> 2:25:06.060]  That's how dictatorships work. That's how authoritarianism works. That's the democrat party
[2:25:07.580 --> 2:25:13.980]  Florida fires a warning shot at democrat ballot track traffickers state will make possession of more than two voter ballots of felony
[2:25:14.300 --> 2:25:19.260]  And democrats are pushing back on this. Well, why would that be because they cheat? It's really that simple
[2:25:19.260 --> 2:25:23.180]  Why don't democrats like voter id laws because they cheat?
[2:25:23.660 --> 2:25:28.380]  Why don't vote? Why don't democrats like ending vote harvesting laws because the democrats cheat?
[2:25:29.020 --> 2:25:33.260]  It's always republicans trying to have fair and free elections. The democrats are always the ones cheating
[2:25:33.820 --> 2:25:38.780]  It's an interesting concept. Do you really think nancy polosi wins any election fairly?
[2:25:38.940 --> 2:25:42.860]  Do you really think joe biden wins an election fairly? Come on
[2:25:42.860 --> 2:25:48.460]  Come on. It's time to stop thinking santa claus exists folks santa claus is not real
[2:25:50.780 --> 2:25:56.860]  Polosi argues spending trillions of dollars lowers national debt and blames global inflation on putin
[2:25:57.180 --> 2:26:00.700]  Nancy polosi is so hopped up on drugs or alcohol or both
[2:26:00.780 --> 2:26:06.940]  I can't tell or or maybe she's just that out of her mind now in her old age with all the history of drug abuse
[2:26:07.500 --> 2:26:10.540]  This woman is a danger. This woman is a threat to this country in the world
[2:26:10.540 --> 2:26:15.180]  And we played the clip of her earlier folks. She is just it is not good
[2:26:16.300 --> 2:26:23.180]  It is just not good. That is an insane psychotic dingbat who's calling for war with russia
[2:26:25.420 --> 2:26:29.660]  Oh, but see they go after trump they subpoena my family
[2:26:30.060 --> 2:26:34.940]  I never even went into the capital on january 6 never touched a police officer never touched a barrier
[2:26:34.940 --> 2:26:40.060]  Never did a damn thing and they subpoena me and they subpoena my family
[2:26:41.580 --> 2:26:45.340]  But nancy polosi claims that she has sovereign immunity
[2:26:45.900 --> 2:26:51.820]  And so she's not going to be turning over any of her emails in regards to january 6. Well, what does that mean?
[2:26:51.900 --> 2:26:53.900]  That means polosi has something to hide
[2:26:54.700 --> 2:27:01.660]  What does polosi have to hide polosi is hiding the fact that she'd been communicating with the democrat mayor of dc
[2:27:01.660 --> 2:27:04.940]  mariel bowser about standing down the police
[2:27:05.500 --> 2:27:10.460]  Taking police off the force that day and making sure the national guard couldn't be in dc
[2:27:10.780 --> 2:27:15.260]  So they could run their operation on january 6th cause a bunch of violence
[2:27:15.900 --> 2:27:20.380]  Break into the capital play the victim and then try to conquer america that way
[2:27:21.180 --> 2:27:26.780]  And that's what they did and that's why nancy nancy polosi is not turning over her emails, but then
[2:27:26.780 --> 2:27:34.060]  My family gets subpoenaed to turn over all of our electronic communications when my family has nothing to do with any of this
[2:27:35.260 --> 2:27:40.380]  But see they know they they they've looked up and down me folks. I mean, I've gotten the whole proctology exam
[2:27:40.540 --> 2:27:45.020]  There's nothing here. You know, there's nothing here. So what you're gonna go after my family now
[2:27:45.020 --> 2:27:51.820]  But oh polosi gets sovereign immunity. Trump though doesn't who was the president and there's actually laws on the books
[2:27:51.820 --> 2:27:57.740]  That give trump immunity to these investigations and they say nope. We're gonna come after you with the new york attorney general
[2:27:57.740 --> 2:28:01.180]  We're gonna come after you at the southern district court. We're gonna come after you with congress
[2:28:01.180 --> 2:28:05.580]  We're gonna come after you with january 6th committee. We're gonna come after trump and he gets no immunity
[2:28:05.820 --> 2:28:08.780]  But that corrupt lying bat witch
[2:28:09.580 --> 2:28:16.140]  Nancy polosi claims that she has sovereign immunity because she wants to cover up the fact that she was involved in the whole thing
[2:28:16.380 --> 2:28:20.940]  And she and mariel bowser were organizing the entire january 6th thing
[2:28:20.940 --> 2:28:22.940]  It wasn't trump
[2:28:23.260 --> 2:28:28.780]  It wasn't alex jones. It wasn't general flin. It wasn't roger stone. It wasn't the proud boys
[2:28:28.780 --> 2:28:34.940]  It wasn't the oath keepers. No, it was the democrat party. I guarantee you
[2:28:35.500 --> 2:28:42.140]  It was the democrat party is the only phone records or emails that you could find with any
[2:28:43.100 --> 2:28:48.780]  preconceived notions of violence on january 6th or any premeditated activities on january 6th
[2:28:48.780 --> 2:28:52.460]  They've searched everywhere folks. They can't find it. You know where they haven't searched yet
[2:28:52.940 --> 2:28:54.940]  Nancy polosi mariel bowser that
[2:28:56.060 --> 2:28:58.540]  alex jones here with a very simple proposal
[2:28:59.180 --> 2:29:01.340]  for all our great info wars listeners and viewers
[2:29:02.220 --> 2:29:06.460]  If you will simply get x3 with all three types of good iodine
[2:29:06.780 --> 2:29:11.180]  That boosts your immune system and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level

[2:29:27.020 --> 2:29:32.380]  Now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because the lockdowns and supply chain breakdowns
[2:29:32.700 --> 2:29:34.700]  We were sold out of x3 for a long time
[2:29:35.100 --> 2:29:39.340]  And I had it on silver 50 off a lot of folks were getting it and I was thinking you know what?
[2:29:39.420 --> 2:29:42.460]  I'm going to bring it back on sale again just until it sells out
[2:29:43.020 --> 2:29:46.700]  Because even though we won't make as much money in the long run a lot of folks need this product

[2:29:54.940 --> 2:29:55.980]  With the world awakening

[2:29:59.580 --> 2:30:03.260]  And I have all of an idea that something everybody can do with every listener can do
[2:30:03.260 --> 2:30:07.900]  I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to uh, you know hang the banners over highway to managing a
[2:30:07.980 --> 2:30:12.620]  Chattano and keep the light up man up. It says Alex Jones is right info wars.com
[2:30:12.620 --> 2:30:17.820]  Or we stand with the truckers arrest out or whatever brother. I'm so glad you called elaborate on this
[2:30:17.980 --> 2:30:24.380]  Yes, now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car
[2:30:24.540 --> 2:30:31.180]  Or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction. What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[2:30:31.260 --> 2:30:33.260]  I have a few ideas
[2:30:33.260 --> 2:30:38.620]  Just before you call a farm arrest out arrest out swap the vaccine is poison. There's tons of things
[2:30:38.700 --> 2:30:45.340]  I say just keep it short keep it concise. I agree arrest Fauci arrest bill gates. The covet backs is poison beautiful
[2:30:45.420 --> 2:30:49.580]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be effective. So that's what i'm calling about
[2:30:49.660 --> 2:30:54.620]  God bless you chris in Atlanta. I really really appreciate you calling us today. Thank you so much

[2:33:39.740 --> 2:33:42.940]  With a piece of tape over my mouth. I got arrested and spent
[2:33:42.940 --> 2:33:47.340]  More than a day in jail. I think it was 27 hours when all all said and done
[2:33:48.620 --> 2:33:50.460]  but uh
[2:33:50.460 --> 2:33:51.900]  Liberal activists

[2:34:11.500 --> 2:34:15.740]  Look at some of more of the latest news here out of america
[2:34:17.340 --> 2:34:22.140]  Layed off keystone pipeline workers shred biden for his lies about american oil production
[2:34:22.140 --> 2:34:26.700]  I'm sick of hearing this is putin's price hike just like the other day on the war room
[2:34:26.700 --> 2:34:32.220]  I opened up the phone lines. We had people that work in the oil industry come in say this is bs. Everything biden administration saying is a lie
[2:34:33.020 --> 2:34:35.900]  But an in studio guest on sunday breaking it all down, too
[2:34:35.900 --> 2:34:42.540]  And so you can only lie to the people so much until your your lies are so flagrant
[2:34:43.180 --> 2:34:50.460]  And so wide reaching that there's thousands or millions of americans that know you're lying because they're involved in the lie
[2:34:50.620 --> 2:34:52.620]  And and you're lying about them
[2:34:52.780 --> 2:34:58.140]  And that's what the globalist uh threshold has been crossed now. That's what the democrat
[2:34:58.620 --> 2:35:03.660]  Lie threshold has been crossed. I mean it's like january 6th millions of people were there on january 6th
[2:35:03.660 --> 2:35:05.660]  They know everything being reported about his lie
[2:35:07.020 --> 2:35:11.980]  People go to trump rallies and then they tuned into the news a trump rally was a violent riot
[2:35:11.980 --> 2:35:19.980]  And they were like i was just there as 20 000 people peacefully chanting usa. What are you talking about the media are liars our politicians are liars
[2:35:21.180 --> 2:35:27.420]  And no, it's not the putin price hike. It's not putin inflation. It's biden inflation. It's the biden gas pump
[2:35:27.580 --> 2:35:29.820]  I mean folks. I don't know what it's like in your areas
[2:35:29.820 --> 2:35:35.020]  And i was thinking about doing this, but it's it's like maybe it's too late
[2:35:37.500 --> 2:35:41.500]  When trump got out of office and and i'm ballparking here
[2:35:43.020 --> 2:35:46.380]  Gas was about two dollars and fifty cents
[2:35:48.940 --> 2:35:51.980]  Gas was about two dollars and fifty cents when trump left office
[2:35:53.180 --> 2:35:55.180]  When biden got into office
[2:35:55.180 --> 2:36:00.380]  And this is in texas a year later. It was up to three dollars and fifty cents
[2:36:01.660 --> 2:36:07.020]  Now in the last four months. It's up to four dollars and fifty cents
[2:36:08.780 --> 2:36:12.700]  And i'm so glad you guys put this up just i'm in sync with the crew because i was gonna say
[2:36:13.580 --> 2:36:19.420]  It used to be like for the last year. I'd see uh, i'd see the biden. I did that sticker
[2:36:20.620 --> 2:36:24.460]  On the gas pump maybe one every ten times i fill up ladies and gentlemen
[2:36:24.460 --> 2:36:29.980]  Every single time i go to fill up my gas tank now. There's a biden sticker
[2:36:30.540 --> 2:36:35.580]  I did that on the gas pump or you can tell somebody has removed four or five of them
[2:36:36.940 --> 2:36:41.260]  Somebody just scraping them off a gas station employee just scraping them off it but you can see that they're there
[2:36:42.300 --> 2:36:45.340]  I've also seen people write on sharpie at the gas station
[2:36:46.060 --> 2:36:49.740]  biden did this because i guess they're sick of their stickers being removed
[2:36:50.620 --> 2:36:52.860]  So america knows what's going on
[2:36:52.860 --> 2:36:59.180]  They're not they're not falling for the putin bogeyman lies of the corporate press
[2:37:00.380 --> 2:37:02.380]  They know what's going on
[2:37:03.740 --> 2:37:06.460]  And and now people are even starting to notice that hey
[2:37:07.340 --> 2:37:12.620]  How come the price of gasoline is going up so much? It's not accurately going along with the price of oil
[2:37:12.620 --> 2:37:14.620]  Well, I think there's a couple reasons for that
[2:37:15.740 --> 2:37:20.380]  I think gas companies are trying to make up for the massive losses that biden has caused
[2:37:20.380 --> 2:37:26.940]  By stalling the new oil production. They suffered probably billions of dollars in losses because of that
[2:37:26.940 --> 2:37:29.900]  So now they're trying to make it up by increasing gas prices
[2:37:30.460 --> 2:37:32.460]  And I also think that
[2:37:33.260 --> 2:37:35.260]  It's more of a futures thing
[2:37:35.420 --> 2:37:39.740]  Where they're anticipating the price of gas and the price of oil is going to go up per barrel
[2:37:40.860 --> 2:37:47.500]  Astronomically considering how the whole world is basically being leveraged against biden not against pudin see that's the big lie
[2:37:47.500 --> 2:37:50.620]  The media wants you to think the world is being leveraged against pudin
[2:37:50.860 --> 2:37:55.020]  It's the exact opposite the world is being leveraged against biden folks
[2:37:56.140 --> 2:37:57.260]  so
[2:37:57.260 --> 2:38:00.540]  I think american gas companies are saying biden's about to
[2:38:02.060 --> 2:38:04.060]  F us up the butt
[2:38:04.060 --> 2:38:10.300]  So we got to put gas out as expensive as we possibly can right now because we're about to bit get crushed
[2:38:11.340 --> 2:38:13.340]  Folks you have democrats
[2:38:13.340 --> 2:38:21.180]  Today in congress who are trying to get a vote to ban all u.s. Oil
[2:38:21.740 --> 2:38:22.700]  I mean
[2:38:22.700 --> 2:38:25.660]  So yeah, and you don't think gas prices are gonna go up
[2:38:26.620 --> 2:38:29.580]  With the democrats saying they're gonna shut down u.s. Oil
[2:38:31.340 --> 2:38:35.900]  You're gonna see $10 a gallon gasoline. I would say by the end of the year who knows might be sooner than that
[2:38:35.980 --> 2:38:37.980]  I don't want to see that
[2:38:37.980 --> 2:38:42.540]  But it's this big joke where biden says we want to drill oil
[2:38:42.700 --> 2:38:45.820]  We're drilling more oil than ever and then in his campaign
[2:38:45.820 --> 2:38:50.460]  He says he's gonna end oil and you have democrats wanting to have a vote on the house right now
[2:38:50.940 --> 2:38:52.940]  They're demanding and guys plug it in
[2:38:53.660 --> 2:38:54.620]  but
[2:38:54.620 --> 2:39:01.180]  House democrats are demanding biden declare a climate emergency and end all oil production in america
[2:39:03.020 --> 2:39:05.980]  You don't think the oil and gas companies see that and and think
[2:39:05.980 --> 2:39:07.980]  Okay, well, we're about to be crushed
[2:39:08.620 --> 2:39:11.980]  I gotta sell oil at top dollar because I don't have a choice now
[2:39:13.260 --> 2:39:15.260]  It's not a charity folks
[2:39:18.780 --> 2:39:23.580]  But then there's the media telling you oh the whole world is being leveraged against putin
[2:39:24.300 --> 2:39:27.980]  Maybe china likes putin. Maybe they don't maybe saudi arabia likes putin. Maybe they don't
[2:39:28.620 --> 2:39:30.620]  Maybe saudi arabia likes china. Maybe they don't
[2:39:31.020 --> 2:39:33.020]  They're all against biden
[2:39:33.020 --> 2:39:39.580]  They don't take biden's phone calls. They don't invite biden for diplomatic conversations. They kick
[2:39:40.220 --> 2:39:44.620]  biden's diplomats like jake sullivan out and spit on him on the way out
[2:39:46.860 --> 2:39:51.340]  That's how pathetic biden's administration is and joe biden and kamal harasar. It's a joke
[2:39:51.900 --> 2:39:55.180]  Where is biden by the way? Yeah, anybody heard from biden recently? I mean whether
[2:39:57.020 --> 2:40:02.060]  No, the world is being leveraged against biden and america folks and you're being lied to about it
[2:40:02.060 --> 2:40:04.060]  and
[2:40:04.460 --> 2:40:06.460]  I'm telling you the big shoe to drop
[2:40:07.500 --> 2:40:12.540]  And it's not a shoe. It's a it's a steel-toed boot size 20
[2:40:13.580 --> 2:40:15.580]  if
[2:40:15.820 --> 2:40:20.300]  Saudi Arabia and china start doing oil deals using the chinese yuan
[2:40:22.860 --> 2:40:29.180]  That's the biggest loss in a u.s. Presidency's history in in modern-day history. I can't think of a bigger loss in that
[2:40:29.180 --> 2:40:31.020]  I really can't
[2:40:31.020 --> 2:40:34.460]  I mean you can talk about the devastation of the afghanistan pullout
[2:40:35.260 --> 2:40:41.820]  Uh, and so many other things folks if that happens the united states leverage on this planet and the power of the u.s
[2:40:41.900 --> 2:40:44.540]  dollar is gone overnight
[2:40:46.300 --> 2:40:50.540]  You really think the world is being leveraged against putin. You're an idiot
[2:40:51.180 --> 2:40:56.460]  The world is being leveraged against biden and all biden had to do all the u.s
[2:40:56.540 --> 2:41:00.060]  Had to do all our media had to do was just back off
[2:41:00.060 --> 2:41:01.420]  That's all
[2:41:01.420 --> 2:41:03.420]  That's all they had to do
[2:41:03.580 --> 2:41:08.220]  But no, we have to deal with with neocon freaks like lindsay graham
[2:41:08.860 --> 2:41:11.980]  Calling for the assassination of putin. We have to deal with
[2:41:12.620 --> 2:41:17.180]  Neolib freaks like nancy polosi calling for bombing russia
[2:41:18.700 --> 2:41:23.580]  You don't think china and saudi arabia sees biden and polosi and lindsay graham and says
[2:41:23.580 --> 2:41:29.340]  Huh, why would we deal with these freaks? Why would we deal with these liars?
[2:41:29.900 --> 2:41:33.500]  Let's just cut the us out entirely. Let's never deal with biden's
[2:41:33.660 --> 2:41:37.500]  Let's never deal with these corrupt bastards ever again, and that's what they're gonna do
[2:41:39.980 --> 2:41:47.500]  And then there's the u.s media telling you oh biden's winning biden's so great the world's being leveraged against putin wrong
[2:41:48.620 --> 2:41:51.660]  Wrong and you're about to find out the hard way
[2:41:51.660 --> 2:41:55.900]  Oh, but see here's what here's what happens in america
[2:41:59.660 --> 2:42:03.420]  Black student behind racist graffiti at rochester girl's school
[2:42:03.660 --> 2:42:08.220]  So it happens again another fake hate crime, you know because racism is so prevalent in this country
[2:42:08.220 --> 2:42:16.460]  We have to fake hate crimes like justy smallette who still thinks he's gonna be killed in prison saying he's not suicidal making comments to his family
[2:42:17.900 --> 2:42:20.620]  So a black girl goes onto a school board
[2:42:20.620 --> 2:42:25.820]  And and writes a bunch of n words and racist tropes and then accuses the school of a hate crime
[2:42:25.980 --> 2:42:28.220]  They investigate turns out she was the one that did it
[2:42:29.420 --> 2:42:30.860]  nice
[2:42:30.860 --> 2:42:34.460]  That's the maturity level of america. That's where america is at right now
[2:42:36.540 --> 2:42:41.100]  Man, oh man, we're being crushed our politicians are feckless criminals
[2:42:42.300 --> 2:42:44.300]  And and much of our
[2:42:44.300 --> 2:42:51.900]  citizenry is I mean, what do you even call somebody that fakes a hate crime like this just total scumbags
[2:42:52.300 --> 2:42:54.300]  ignoramuses brainwashed
[2:42:54.940 --> 2:42:57.100]  two of our best-selling products are back in stock
[2:42:57.420 --> 2:42:59.420]  in fullwarstore.com
[2:42:59.420 --> 2:43:04.300]  And they will sell out in the next three four months before I get more of the product in if I sell it at full price
[2:43:04.780 --> 2:43:09.900]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or son or getting x3
[2:43:09.900 --> 2:43:15.260]  To try the products and see how amazing they are and I believe you will then get hooked on them
[2:43:15.500 --> 2:43:20.300]  Like myself my family and the crew are so again, both these products are back in stock
[2:43:20.620 --> 2:43:22.620]  Both x3 and one or son
[2:43:22.620 --> 2:43:28.060]  They are 50% off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price
[2:43:28.060 --> 2:43:30.780]  I would estimate in less than a month
[2:43:30.780 --> 2:43:35.660]  So this is your chance to get x3 and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens
[2:43:35.660 --> 2:43:38.220]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin d3
[2:43:38.220 --> 2:43:40.220]  with vitamin k for your immune system as well
[2:43:40.220 --> 2:43:42.220]  They're amazing and they're an infowarstore.com
[2:43:42.220 --> 2:43:46.220]  The reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation
[2:43:46.220 --> 2:43:48.220]  I need funds to run the operation
[2:43:48.220 --> 2:43:52.220]  You need to be healthy. We need to stay on air. It's a match made in heaven
[2:43:56.220 --> 2:44:00.220]  Granny do right. Granny do right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead
[2:44:00.220 --> 2:44:04.220]  Challenge first of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny
[2:44:04.220 --> 2:44:10.220]  And for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me
[2:44:10.220 --> 2:44:14.220]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called
[2:44:14.220 --> 2:44:20.220]  But since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually
[2:44:20.220 --> 2:44:22.220]  People think I'm 55 years old
[2:44:24.220 --> 2:44:26.220]  And I was already taking your other supplements
[2:44:26.220 --> 2:44:31.220]  But I thought you know well maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[2:44:31.220 --> 2:44:35.220]  But when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately
[2:44:35.220 --> 2:44:39.220]  But you know over a period of time I started noticing
[2:44:39.220 --> 2:44:43.220]  Okay, you know this is the ticket. This is working. This is wonderful, you know
[2:44:43.220 --> 2:44:47.220]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know
[2:44:47.220 --> 2:44:53.220]  So anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[2:44:53.220 --> 2:44:59.220]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia
[2:44:59.220 --> 2:45:02.220]  To the United States, from Canada to Germany
[2:45:02.220 --> 2:45:05.220]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go
[2:45:05.220 --> 2:45:08.220]  And then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[2:45:08.220 --> 2:45:12.220]  Taking people away into the night to their facilities
[2:45:12.220 --> 2:45:16.220]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process
[2:45:16.220 --> 2:45:21.220]  Where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety
[2:45:21.220 --> 2:45:23.220]  This is nothing less than martial law
[2:45:23.220 --> 2:45:27.220]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages
[2:45:27.220 --> 2:45:30.220]  Many of which are made here in America and are very compliant
[2:45:30.220 --> 2:45:34.220]  Meaning US government military grade at infowarstore.com

[2:46:21.220 --> 2:46:29.220]  Garamaseed, which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries

[2:46:56.220 --> 2:47:01.220]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order
[2:47:01.220 --> 2:47:03.220]  It's Alex Jones
[2:47:03.220 --> 2:47:16.220]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones show, Sean Stone in studio with me now for one segment
[2:47:16.220 --> 2:47:21.220]  He'll be back on the war room with Wayne Allen Root coming up in the fourth hour
[2:47:21.220 --> 2:47:26.220]  And your father put out a great documentary, Ukraine on Fire
[2:47:26.220 --> 2:47:33.220]  It recently got banned on a bunch of platforms, so we put it up at Band Out video, I think it's encroaching a million views now
[2:47:33.220 --> 2:47:37.220]  I was able to watch about half of it the other night and it made sense to me why they banned it
[2:47:37.220 --> 2:47:41.220]  It came out in 2016 and you watch this
[2:47:41.220 --> 2:47:47.220]  And you realize Ukraine has long been embedded with corruption, political corruption, money laundering, all this stuff
[2:47:47.220 --> 2:47:50.220]  And you watch it and you realize, wait a second
[2:47:50.220 --> 2:47:58.220]  I'm not going to pass judgment on the people of Ukraine or Ukraine good or bad, but there was clearly widespread political corruption there
[2:47:58.220 --> 2:48:03.220]  And they don't want this information to be known, look, even Victoria Newland on the cover of it
[2:48:03.220 --> 2:48:09.220]  They don't want this information to be known now because all the propaganda they're putting out about Ukraine is put to rest
[2:48:09.220 --> 2:48:13.220]  If you simply watch this documentary which came out six years ago
[2:48:13.220 --> 2:48:20.220]  It was the first of two documentaries and so YouTube did essentially by flagging it or banning it
[2:48:20.220 --> 2:48:25.220]  You can't ban content in this day and age, thankfully we have the alternative sources now
[2:48:25.220 --> 2:48:30.220]  We have the rumbles and the ban video and countless other outlets that we can get it through
[2:48:30.220 --> 2:48:33.220]  And it's just impossible to censor people the way they would like to
[2:48:33.220 --> 2:48:38.220]  In fact what it did I think was make it even more attractive and more appealing and more of interest
[2:48:38.220 --> 2:48:45.220]  And say, well, you're censoring these guys after you censored Dr. Malone and all these other people last year threatened to censor Joe Rogan last year
[2:48:45.220 --> 2:48:49.220]  I think a lot of people have been waking up in this past two years, thankfully
[2:48:49.220 --> 2:48:57.220]  And I feel like those that didn't wake up with COVID will never wake up because it's, you know, if you're being forced to be masked, muzzled, forced to be vaccinated
[2:48:57.220 --> 2:49:01.220]  And you don't think that there's anything wrong with that? Well, you don't really belong in a free country
[2:49:01.220 --> 2:49:06.220]  But I think those that really have become skeptical and realizing, well, the censorship is a real thing
[2:49:06.220 --> 2:49:10.220]  This documentary being banned, hey, that should stoke a little bit of curiosity in you
[2:49:10.220 --> 2:49:16.220]  And you start to realize, as you said, that this is a, you know, the denazification that Putin is talking about
[2:49:16.220 --> 2:49:23.220]  I just say, well, watch Ukraine on fire, it explains to you, you know, how much we brought, we allowed this, not just we as in the U.S.
[2:49:23.220 --> 2:49:26.220]  Because we were arming Ukraine through this time period initially
[2:49:26.220 --> 2:49:33.220]  We said we didn't want to arm them because there were these neo-Nazi groups like as of battalion that were incorporated into the military
[2:49:33.220 --> 2:49:38.220]  And we said, well, you know, we can't arm these guys, they're Nazis, but then all of a sudden we shifted by 2016
[2:49:38.220 --> 2:49:43.220]  And we continued to arm and continued to basically push for the armaments of Ukraine
[2:49:43.220 --> 2:49:50.220]  And you sit there and go, well, you know, you can say all you want that Ukraine is as a, you know, a pacifist country, a peaceful country
[2:49:50.220 --> 2:49:56.220]  But they've been arming themselves very much like a NATO, like a, you know, the next step being NATO
[2:49:56.220 --> 2:50:00.220]  But they've been arming themselves like a part of NATO with all this weaponry and whatnot
[2:50:00.220 --> 2:50:03.220]  So it's not like they were just sitting there, you know, peacefully minding their own business
[2:50:03.220 --> 2:50:07.220]  They were preparing themselves in a very anti-Russian slant since 2014
[2:50:07.220 --> 2:50:12.220]  And that's the point, this is a country Ukraine that 100 years ago you would have called Kiev Russia
[2:50:12.220 --> 2:50:19.220]  It was part of Russia 100 years ago, so don't, we can't fool ourselves and just say, you know, Russia is just ambitious in trying to conquer the world
[2:50:19.220 --> 2:50:25.220]  No, there's a very particular relationship Russia has, a lot of the population is Russian, Russian descent, Russian language
[2:50:25.220 --> 2:50:30.220]  So there's a very close relationship between Ukraine and Russia
[2:50:30.220 --> 2:50:34.220]  And since 2014 we have been pushing along with Europe, along with the Soros factions
[2:50:34.220 --> 2:50:37.220]  Pushing to basically make Ukraine anti-Russian
[2:50:37.220 --> 2:50:42.220]  And listen, if Mexico became anti-American tomorrow, cut off relationships economically with us
[2:50:42.220 --> 2:50:47.220]  Started bringing Russian or Chinese weapons and missiles and things like this to Mexico
[2:50:47.220 --> 2:50:49.220]  You don't think we'd be pissed off?
[2:50:49.220 --> 2:50:55.220]  And really it's actually worse with the Ukraine situation because as you said, that was actually part of Russia at one point
[2:50:55.220 --> 2:51:02.220]  And I don't think it's a coincidence that one of the last things that happened in Congress under Obama was
[2:51:02.220 --> 2:51:05.220]  They solidified that, yes, we're going to arm these Nazis
[2:51:05.220 --> 2:51:10.220]  I mean, that was one of the things Congress approved arming Nazis in Ukraine, it was mainstream news at the time
[2:51:10.220 --> 2:51:13.220]  That was one of the last things Congress did on the Obama administration
[2:51:13.220 --> 2:51:15.220]  I don't think that was coincidental
[2:51:15.220 --> 2:51:20.220]  No, no, no, of course not, because we're fine with the, you know, again, NATO
[2:51:20.220 --> 2:51:27.220]  Think about the origins of NATO and how much of it was designed based on the Nazi apparatus, the Nazi Eastern Front apparatus
[2:51:27.220 --> 2:51:31.220]  I mean, people who studied the CIA are familiar with a guy named Reinhard Gehlen, right?
[2:51:31.220 --> 2:51:37.220]  And Gehlen being basically one of the chief officers of the Nazis on the Eastern Front, their intel guy
[2:51:37.220 --> 2:51:41.220]  And he became a major architect of the CIA under Dulles
[2:51:41.220 --> 2:51:49.220]  Of course, I mean, Dulles and these guys, Alan Dulles and company, I mean, they were working to bring the money to Hitler
[2:51:49.220 --> 2:51:57.220]  They were lawyers that were helping the banks and the standard oils and all these different groups here in America to do deals with the Nazis
[2:51:57.220 --> 2:52:02.220]  So, it's not like we were anti-Nazi, there were a lot of Anglo-Americans that were pushing for Hitler to go East
[2:52:02.220 --> 2:52:08.220]  Since the beginning of the Nazi Party, since Hitler's rise to power, this whole Anglo-American faction
[2:52:08.220 --> 2:52:16.220]  I think about my New World Order book was actually gearing Hitler against the Russians, against, you know, the Stalin's Soviet Union at the time
[2:52:16.220 --> 2:52:23.220]  And so the Russians don't forget this, they know exactly what a lot of the Western powers have been, you know, the intention of the Western powers has been
[2:52:23.220 --> 2:52:31.220]  basically anti-Russia since the turn of, not even the turn of the century, since the 19th century, since the British were allying with the Turks against them in the Crimean War
[2:52:31.220 --> 2:52:43.220]  And then all through the 20th century, really, with post-World War I when, again, they started developing the German rearmament after the First World War to fight Russia
[2:52:43.220 --> 2:52:46.220]  So the Russians haven't forgotten, they know what the West is doing
[2:52:46.220 --> 2:52:53.220]  Well, and the foresight, whether intentional or not, of this documentary is so amazing, it's almost as if they kind of missed this
[2:52:53.220 --> 2:53:04.220]  I think they probably wished they would have censored that documentary probably a year ago before all of this because their censorship post the most recent struggle in Ukraine has actually just made more eyes on it
[2:53:04.220 --> 2:53:11.220]  I mean, it's got over a million views on banned-out video, I'm sure more people have watched it in the last year than the year prior and the year prior to that
[2:53:11.220 --> 2:53:16.220]  So it's almost like they kind of missed this, they hit the censorship button on that documentary a little too late
[2:53:16.220 --> 2:53:28.220]  But I mean, talk about the foresight of the documentary, I mean, did your father put that out because he saw this coming? Or was it just his interest in the story of Ukraine that made him want to do that documentary?
[2:53:28.220 --> 2:53:34.220]  No, the director of the documentary is Igor Laputinok, who's a Ukrainian Russian, he's from Ukraine in the Soviet era
[2:53:34.220 --> 2:53:42.220]  And basically, he and my father both understood what happened in 2014 with Maidan was a color revolution, right?
[2:53:42.220 --> 2:53:50.220]  I mean, Soros, we all remember this in the 2000s, Soros's fingerprints were all over these color revolutions in various former Soviet countries
[2:53:50.220 --> 2:53:57.220]  And also in North Africa, right, in Egypt and places like this, all these different Arab springs, you know, color revolutions
[2:53:57.220 --> 2:54:03.220]  And it was always being designed very much with the interests of the West, you know, in alignment with the interests of the West
[2:54:03.220 --> 2:54:13.220]  So when it happened in 2014, Igor as the director and my father as the executive producer, you know, wanted to tell a story to explain to people that this is, you know
[2:54:13.220 --> 2:54:18.220]  This could be a very dangerous situation because of Ukraine's history with vis-a-vis Russia
[2:54:18.220 --> 2:54:22.220]  Russia in 2008, Putin said, Georgia and Ukraine cannot become NATO countries
[2:54:22.220 --> 2:54:30.220]  They surrendered, you know, what, over a dozen new countries to NATO and, you know, since they followed the Soviet Union when basically the West said, we're not going to expand NATO
[2:54:30.220 --> 2:54:36.220]  NATO is an anti-Russian organization, the Soviet Union collapsed. Why are we pushing NATO further with against the weakened Russia?
[2:54:36.220 --> 2:54:43.220]  We should have probably just said, look, let's make peace, let's work to have trade and various agreements to, you know, bring stabilize the region
[2:54:43.220 --> 2:54:49.220]  Instead, they continue to push armaments, right, arm sales, it's big money to, you know, promote, again, defense against Russia
[2:54:49.220 --> 2:54:54.220]  And they kept pushing and pushing and Putin in 2008 said, Georgia and Ukraine is a red line
[2:54:54.220 --> 2:55:03.220]  But 2014 with the Maidan coup, again, neo-nazi factions involved, you know, they had snipers killing people and they basically blamed it on the Russians
[2:55:03.220 --> 2:55:10.220]  But it seems that it was actually, no, it was probably the neo-nazi factions that were the ones doing the sniping to then blame it on the Russians
[2:55:10.220 --> 2:55:16.220]  False typical false flag, right? So again, 2014 is an important date, and my dad and Igor understood this
[2:55:16.220 --> 2:55:29.220]  In the sequel documentary Revealing Ukraine, he explains even more of what happened in the wake of that and how this anti-Russian agenda became solidified within the political climate of Ukraine in the last eight years
[2:55:29.220 --> 2:55:39.220]  And how much even the politician who was the second most popular politician, let's say, after Zelensky, who has been under house arrest, my father was interviewing this man
[2:55:39.220 --> 2:55:45.220]  He was saying, look, we need to work with Russia, they're our neighbor, you know, we have history, we cannot isolate ourselves vis-à-vis Russia
[2:55:45.220 --> 2:55:52.220]  This is a terrible policy for us, again, as I said, it would be like Mexico cutting off America and saying, no, we're no longer trading with America
[2:55:52.220 --> 2:55:57.220]  We're shutting you out, we're gonna, you know, basically, you know, go with China from here on out
[2:55:57.220 --> 2:56:00.220]  It would not be, it was not a good strategy for Ukraine to follow
[2:56:00.220 --> 2:56:10.220]  And this is kind of like a, you know, a retweet doesn't equal endorsement thing, but, you know, this is what Americans don't really understand because the media is lying to them so much
[2:56:10.220 --> 2:56:18.220]  Saudi Arabia doesn't want its country to be LGBTQ, okay, Russia doesn't want its country to be LGBTQ
[2:56:18.220 --> 2:56:25.220]  Egypt, people in Ukraine, all these other places, they're sick of Soros color revolutions coming in using social media giants to do this
[2:56:25.220 --> 2:56:35.220]  And all of these countries are sick of corruption from American bureaucrats and politicians using their country for bribery, blackmail, money laundering, all this stuff
[2:56:35.220 --> 2:56:41.220]  So Americans are really being lied to at the big picture here, the world is sick of corrupt American politicians
[2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:48.220]  Again, retweet doesn't equal endorsement, I'm not saying China is good or all these other countries are good, I'm saying they're rejecting the Soros movement
[2:56:48.220 --> 2:56:58.220]  They're rejecting, really, not Western expansionists going in and raising our flag, but politicians expanding their own wealth and power via expansion
[2:56:58.220 --> 2:57:01.220]  This is the big lie that the media is not telling the American people
[2:57:01.220 --> 2:57:08.220]  Absolutely, I mean, the problem is, as I've been saying with Russia, and my father's been saying it by doing the Putin interviews and talking to Putin
[2:57:08.220 --> 2:57:14.220]  Putin called America his partner, he's like, we look to our partners in America, America never looks to Russia as a partner, America
[2:57:14.220 --> 2:57:15.220]  I wish we had
[2:57:15.220 --> 2:57:21.220]  Right, he's saying they're the enemy, why are they the enemy? This is a great power, why should we not have trade and respect for each other?
[2:57:21.220 --> 2:57:24.220]  Imagine the alliance of Russia and US
[2:57:24.220 --> 2:57:35.220]  They're a very similar country, if you think about multicultural, massive land mass, they have science, they're very intelligent, culturally intelligent, scientifically intelligent
[2:57:35.220 --> 2:57:37.220]  It would be a natural alliance
[2:57:37.220 --> 2:57:45.220]  Sean Stone is with us, he's going to be back with me on the war room, Wayne Allen Root taking over the Alex Jones show right now
[2:57:45.220 --> 2:57:57.220]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022, and in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3
[2:57:57.220 --> 2:58:06.220]  That has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body
[2:58:06.220 --> 2:58:15.220]  Your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much, and the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient, this is the very best iodine out there
[2:58:15.220 --> 2:58:24.220]  So, we had on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or isn't going to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full production
[2:58:24.220 --> 2:58:30.220]  I was just thinking, you know what, we need the funds in now to stay on air, plus this is the right product everybody needs
[2:58:30.220 --> 2:58:39.220]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it yourself, and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out

[3:00:06.220 --> 3:00:19.220]  All right, welcome to the show, Wayne Alleroot is with you, guest host on Tuesdays for Alex Jones and honored to be here with you
[3:00:19.220 --> 3:00:31.220]  Fantastic audience, fantastic show, fantastic host, Alex Jones, great network and the content, man, it's honored to be with you because you don't get the real scoop anywhere else anymore
[3:00:31.220 --> 3:00:36.220]  Wayne Root and Alex Jones and a few other rare shows across the United States of America
[3:00:36.220 --> 3:00:50.220]  Last Tuesday when I was on as guest host, I talked about the fact that it just come out last weekend that Newsmax and Fox News had taken huge money from the Biden administration, from the federal government
[3:00:50.220 --> 3:00:58.220]  to not talk about all the deaths and injuries from the vaccine and never talk about the negative side effects of the vaccine
[3:00:58.220 --> 3:01:12.220]  Don't only give positive information, never allow host to ever say something bad, never ask a question, and most importantly, never even allow a guest on who would say something negative about the vaccine
[3:01:12.220 --> 3:01:20.220]  So it's apropos I think that I'm guest hosting again this Tuesday and leading off with that news because I want to make sure you understand the significance of it
[3:01:20.220 --> 3:01:26.220]  I've been saying this for a long time, this is the communist takeover of the United States
[3:01:26.220 --> 3:01:40.220]  This is the hallmark of communism, no dissent allowed, no one is allowed to say I don't agree with the leader, I don't agree with the tyrant, I don't agree with the persecution of people who dissent
[3:01:40.220 --> 3:01:48.220]  or you get taken off to the gulag, you get banned for life, as I was by the way, banned for life by Twitter
[3:01:48.220 --> 3:02:01.220]  Made headlines all over the world, front of the UK Daily Mail and several other newspapers in England and around the world, Donald Trump's friend Wayne Allaru banned for life by Twitter
[3:02:01.220 --> 3:02:13.220]  So this is the period we're in, it's like, you know, gobbles, it's like the Gestapo, it's like the Soviet Gulag and the KGB and the East German Stasi
[3:02:13.220 --> 3:02:24.220]  You can't get the truth from the news, so I have argued, and I'll make this case throughout today's hour, I have argued again and again and again
[3:02:24.220 --> 3:02:34.220]  on my national radio show, Wayne Allaru, raw.net, filtered on USA Radio Network every afternoon, 3 to 6 p.m. west coast time, 6 to 9 p.m. east coast time
[3:02:34.220 --> 3:02:48.220]  5 to 8 central time, check it out at USARadio.com or my website, rootforamerica.com or how about Odyssey, the world's biggest streaming app, now took my show, the Wayne Allaru show about a month ago
[3:02:48.220 --> 3:02:54.220]  Big, big, big happening for us, so every day on Odyssey, on your phone, you can listen to the Wayne Allaru show
[3:02:54.220 --> 3:03:04.220]  But I argue 3 hours a day that what's happening today, you can't believe a word about Ukraine and Russia, you can't believe anything going on in the media
[3:03:04.220 --> 3:03:13.220]  because they lie about everything, the same people that lie to you about the rigged election and continue to lie to you and make believe it never happened
[3:03:13.220 --> 3:03:20.220]  and if you talk about it, you should be banned for life or put in prison, just like the Soviet Union, just like Nazi Germany
[3:03:20.220 --> 3:03:29.220]  and I'm a Jew, I could say that, let's see the media come after me, a Jew for saying that this reminds me of Nazi Germany
[3:03:29.220 --> 3:03:37.220]  the way the unvaccinated were treated reminds me of Nazi Germany, the vaccine passports remind me of the Gestapo
[3:03:37.220 --> 3:03:46.220]  and now the news media and the lies for the last 2 years of COVID and the lies of the rigged election and the banning of talking about it
[3:03:46.220 --> 3:03:54.220]  and now I think the lies of the Ukraine Russian war, by the way, it's real, COVID was real and what's going on in Ukraine is real
[3:03:54.220 --> 3:04:01.220]  it's not made up, they're not acting, there's an invasion by Russia, they've got objectives, they've got nothing to do with us
[3:04:01.220 --> 3:04:10.220]  but now you have people saying out loud, if you say that it's not that bad, if you say the media is lying, if you say maybe we shouldn't get involved
[3:04:10.220 --> 3:04:18.220]  if you say we shouldn't be on Ukraine side, if you say some of the scenes you see on TV could be staged, you don't know what to believe
[3:04:18.220 --> 3:04:27.220]  because they lied so much about COVID and so much about the rigged election, they say you should be put in prison or fined or banned
[3:04:27.220 --> 3:04:35.220]  this has never happened in the history of America, that a person trying to honestly look at a situation and keep America out of war
[3:04:35.220 --> 3:04:42.220]  and keep your children safe, I have two sons, I don't want them going anywhere near World War III over Ukraine
[3:04:42.220 --> 3:04:50.220]  I don't want my kids dying or coming home crippled, okay, I've had friends and I've had fans, I visited at Walter Reed Hospital
[3:04:50.220 --> 3:04:55.220]  I've seen what war does and I don't want my kids happening to them or yours
[3:04:55.220 --> 3:05:03.220]  sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large
[3:05:03.220 --> 3:05:07.220]  if you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of
[3:05:07.220 --> 3:05:11.220]  our new sleep support formula down and out is just the thing
[3:05:11.220 --> 3:05:18.220]  it's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut eye you deserve
[3:05:18.220 --> 3:05:23.220]  formulated to improve upon our best selling product knockout with down and out
[3:05:23.220 --> 3:05:29.220]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution
[3:05:29.220 --> 3:05:34.220]  so the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it

[3:05:38.220 --> 3:05:44.220]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities

[3:06:06.220 --> 3:06:10.220]  by the way my website root for america.com
[3:06:10.220 --> 3:06:14.220]  and you can email me anytime Wayne root at gmail.com I'd love to hear from you
[3:06:14.220 --> 3:06:18.220]  tell the same thing to all my fans on my three hour daily national radio show
[3:06:18.220 --> 3:06:21.220]  there is my website root for america.com
[3:06:21.220 --> 3:06:25.220]  here's my book the great patriot protest and boycott book
[3:06:25.220 --> 3:06:31.220]  which I think is one of the answers I've got a lot of solutions is one of the answers
[3:06:31.220 --> 3:06:34.220]  for how we fight back it's about civil disobedience
[3:06:34.220 --> 3:06:37.220]  it's about strikes and protests and boycotts and blockades
[3:06:37.220 --> 3:06:41.220]  and all the things we need to do that Dr. Martin Luther King did in the 1960s
[3:06:41.220 --> 3:06:46.220]  that won civil rights for black Americans we as conservatives need to do
[3:06:46.220 --> 3:06:50.220]  we're the ones being persecuted now the civil rights issue of this century
[3:06:50.220 --> 3:06:56.220]  is persecution of conservatives I remember years ago 15 years ago I gave a speech in San Francisco
[3:06:56.220 --> 3:07:03.220]  and I said it's great to be here in San Francisco in front of people in a city where you can come out of the closet
[3:07:03.220 --> 3:07:08.220]  you can be openly gay but you got to be a closet conservative and the crowd laughed
[3:07:08.220 --> 3:07:12.220]  they thought that was hilarious that was 15 years ago now it's come true
[3:07:12.220 --> 3:07:16.220]  I think we got to fight back because we are the persecuted ones
[3:07:16.220 --> 3:07:20.220]  conservatives, capitalists, patriots who love america
[3:07:20.220 --> 3:07:27.220]  and how about a specific subset white straight males who are republicans and who are macho
[3:07:27.220 --> 3:07:31.220]  my god they hate us they want to destroy us they don't want to kids go to college
[3:07:31.220 --> 3:07:34.220]  they don't want us getting jobs they want to kill our careers and our business
[3:07:34.220 --> 3:07:38.220]  it's the most incredible persecution a critical race theory
[3:07:38.220 --> 3:07:42.220]  they got teaching children they hate themselves because they're white and they're inferior because they're white
[3:07:42.220 --> 3:07:46.220]  terrible anyway here's the book the great patriot protest the boycott book
[3:07:46.220 --> 3:07:51.220]  it is a resource guide an additional book in the backs of 120 corporations
[3:07:51.220 --> 3:07:55.220]  that screw over conservatives and the name of the CEO and information in the book
[3:07:55.220 --> 3:07:59.220]  the phone number, the email, the social media and the physical address
[3:07:59.220 --> 3:08:04.220]  so you can go after them and let them know we're boycotting you until you stop this liberal crap
[3:08:04.220 --> 3:08:08.220]  alright so this is a nice long stretch in this segment
[3:08:08.220 --> 3:08:12.220]  gives me a chance to read my commentary that's coming out this weekend
[3:08:12.220 --> 3:08:15.220]  normally I don't even write it so Thursday afternoon or Friday morning
[3:08:15.220 --> 3:08:19.220]  but I'm leaving tomorrow for my honeymoon I'm going to Mar-a-Lago
[3:08:19.220 --> 3:08:23.220]  can you imagine I'm spending a week at Donald Trump's amazing fairy tale estate
[3:08:23.220 --> 3:08:28.220]  with my new wife Cindy and we leave tomorrow morning at very early in the morning
[3:08:28.220 --> 3:08:32.220]  so I had to write it this morning I got up at five in the morning to write it
[3:08:32.220 --> 3:08:35.220]  and it'll be out this weekend in newspapers around the country
[3:08:35.220 --> 3:08:39.220]  nationally syndicated I want you to hear it you're the first to hear it in America
[3:08:39.220 --> 3:08:42.220]  the fans of the Alex Jones show from Wayne Alleroot
[3:08:42.220 --> 3:08:47.220]  the title is has one rigged election destroyed America forever
[3:08:47.220 --> 3:08:53.220]  the odds are not good so here it is folks we are in a world of trouble
[3:08:53.220 --> 3:08:58.220]  America has faced tough odds before America beats impossible odds all the time
[3:08:58.220 --> 3:09:03.220]  we are relentless and resilient and tenacious
[3:09:03.220 --> 3:09:07.220]  we're a nation of people who believe nothing is impossible
[3:09:07.220 --> 3:09:12.220]  we constantly make the impossible possible so never count us out
[3:09:12.220 --> 3:09:17.220]  there is hope but make no mistake we are now in the fight of our lives
[3:09:17.220 --> 3:09:21.220]  and the odds may be worse than we have ever faced
[3:09:21.220 --> 3:09:26.220]  our nation is being destroyed from within America is hanging by a thread
[3:09:26.220 --> 3:09:29.220]  the attacks are relentless and ominous
[3:09:29.220 --> 3:09:32.220]  the nation is divided like never before
[3:09:32.220 --> 3:09:37.220]  you have to go back to the civil war to find any other period in our nation's history
[3:09:37.220 --> 3:09:40.220]  where we are this bitterly divided
[3:09:40.220 --> 3:09:45.220]  our borders are wide open with millions of foreign invaders coming in every year
[3:09:45.220 --> 3:09:48.220]  there's some scenes up on the screen
[3:09:48.220 --> 3:09:51.220]  the bad countries the world are emptying out their prisons
[3:09:51.220 --> 3:09:56.220]  to send their worst criminals to us to make them our headache
[3:09:56.220 --> 3:10:00.220]  to make them our expense illegal aliens by the millions
[3:10:00.220 --> 3:10:03.220]  are bringing poverty disease and violent crime
[3:10:03.220 --> 3:10:07.220]  bloating our budget exploding our national debt
[3:10:07.220 --> 3:10:10.220]  and destroying our education system
[3:10:10.220 --> 3:10:14.220]  our healthcare system and our social security system
[3:10:14.220 --> 3:10:18.220]  inflation is raging like never before in modern history
[3:10:18.220 --> 3:10:22.220]  maybe like never before in the entire history of the United States
[3:10:22.220 --> 3:10:26.220]  no one really knows how bad it is and exactly and no one really knows
[3:10:26.220 --> 3:10:28.220]  how bad it's going to get
[3:10:28.220 --> 3:10:31.220]  but the government is hiding the true level of inflation
[3:10:31.220 --> 3:10:34.220]  a more accurate measurement of inflation
[3:10:34.220 --> 3:10:40.220]  puts us in the 15% to 20% or more range right now
[3:10:40.220 --> 3:10:42.220]  and it's only going to get worse
[3:10:42.220 --> 3:10:47.220]  this has the potential to wipe out the great American middle class
[3:10:47.220 --> 3:10:51.220]  if and when gas gets to $10 a gallon
[3:10:51.220 --> 3:10:56.220]  or higher some experts are suggesting it could go to $15 a gallon
[3:10:56.220 --> 3:10:59.220]  the US economy will be at the point of collapse
[3:10:59.220 --> 3:11:02.220]  what working class or middle class person
[3:11:02.220 --> 3:11:06.220]  will be able to drive to work or play or vacation
[3:11:06.220 --> 3:11:10.220]  when it costs $200 or more to fill up one tank of gas
[3:11:10.220 --> 3:11:12.220]  imagine if it went to $15 a gallon
[3:11:12.220 --> 3:11:16.220]  it would cost you $300 to fill up a tank of gas
[3:11:16.220 --> 3:11:20.220]  what will happen to 3.5 million American truckers
[3:11:20.220 --> 3:11:24.220]  who each drive thousands of miles a week
[3:11:24.220 --> 3:11:27.220]  if they can't get the food or goods to market
[3:11:27.220 --> 3:11:30.220]  our nation collapses into Mad Max territory
[3:11:30.220 --> 3:11:34.220]  remember that movie from 40 years ago I think Mad Max
[3:11:34.220 --> 3:11:37.220]  with Mel Gibson roaming a post apocalyptic world
[3:11:37.220 --> 3:11:39.220]  after I think a nuclear attack
[3:11:39.220 --> 3:11:41.220]  that's what it would look like
[3:11:41.220 --> 3:11:43.220]  it's every man or woman for themselves
[3:11:43.220 --> 3:11:47.220]  but the best case scenario, the worst is Mad Max
[3:11:47.220 --> 3:11:51.220]  the best case scenario is the truckers continue to deliver the goods
[3:11:51.220 --> 3:11:56.220]  and the food but prices double or triple from where they are now
[3:11:56.220 --> 3:11:57.220]  already high
[3:11:57.220 --> 3:11:59.220]  there's Mad Max right there
[3:11:59.220 --> 3:12:00.220]  you guys are great
[3:12:00.220 --> 3:12:02.220]  I love the B-roll you guys put up
[3:12:02.220 --> 3:12:03.220]  there's Mad Max
[3:12:03.220 --> 3:12:06.220]  I haven't even gotten to the worst scenarios yet
[3:12:06.220 --> 3:12:11.220]  but the point is a rigged election has changed everything
[3:12:11.220 --> 3:12:14.220]  let's do a little rundown memory lane
[3:12:14.220 --> 3:12:17.220]  think of America with Donald J. Trump as president
[3:12:17.220 --> 3:12:18.220]  I'll see him
[3:12:18.220 --> 3:12:20.220]  I'll see him hopefully tomorrow night for dinner
[3:12:20.220 --> 3:12:22.220]  and throughout the week in Mar-a-Lago
[3:12:22.220 --> 3:12:23.220]  on my honeymoon
[3:12:23.220 --> 3:12:24.220]  thank you President Trump
[3:12:24.220 --> 3:12:27.220]  but think of America with Trump as president
[3:12:27.220 --> 3:12:29.220]  things were great
[3:12:29.220 --> 3:12:33.220]  we had perhaps the greatest and most prosperous economy in history
[3:12:33.220 --> 3:12:36.220]  the highest increase in middle class incomes ever
[3:12:36.220 --> 3:12:39.220]  the lowest unemployment ever
[3:12:39.220 --> 3:12:42.220]  including the lowest black and Latino unemployment ever
[3:12:42.220 --> 3:12:45.220]  inflation and interest rates and historic lows
[3:12:45.220 --> 3:12:49.220]  a perfect supply chain with a plethora of everything
[3:12:49.220 --> 3:12:51.220]  anything you wanted in the world
[3:12:51.220 --> 3:12:53.220]  you got in prosperous Trump America
[3:12:53.220 --> 3:12:56.220]  and we had peace all over the world
[3:12:56.220 --> 3:13:00.220]  but some Americans didn't like Donald Trump's tweets
[3:13:00.220 --> 3:13:04.220]  what would you give to have Trump back right about now
[3:13:04.220 --> 3:13:07.220]  one rigged election has changed everything
[3:13:07.220 --> 3:13:10.220]  American exceptionalism, capitalism, our economy
[3:13:10.220 --> 3:13:12.220]  your job, your future, earning power
[3:13:12.220 --> 3:13:14.220]  your children's future, your freedoms
[3:13:14.220 --> 3:13:16.220]  peace on earth
[3:13:16.220 --> 3:13:18.220]  it's all at risk now
[3:13:18.220 --> 3:13:20.220]  it could all go to hell at any moment
[3:13:20.220 --> 3:13:24.220]  all because we allowed Democrats to rig a presidential election
[3:13:24.220 --> 3:13:27.220]  with millions of fake mail-in ballots
[3:13:27.220 --> 3:13:29.220]  tied to no voter ID
[3:13:29.220 --> 3:13:32.220]  tied to little or no signature matching
[3:13:32.220 --> 3:13:35.220]  plus an insane idea called ballot harvesting
[3:13:35.220 --> 3:13:38.220]  that used to be illegal in all 50 states
[3:13:38.220 --> 3:13:40.220]  and isn't illegal anywhere else in the world
[3:13:40.220 --> 3:13:42.220]  ballot drops in the middle of the night
[3:13:42.220 --> 3:13:45.220]  of 100,000 to basically zero for Biden
[3:13:45.220 --> 3:13:49.220]  ballots counted for days after the election
[3:13:49.220 --> 3:13:52.220]  until the desired result was achieved by Democrats
[3:13:52.220 --> 3:13:55.220]  and after every Republican witness possible
[3:13:55.220 --> 3:13:57.220]  was kicked out of every counting room
[3:13:57.220 --> 3:14:01.220]  while the votes were being counted in key battleground states
[3:14:01.220 --> 3:14:03.220]  no evidence of a rigged election there, huh?
[3:14:03.220 --> 3:14:05.220]  we're all crazy
[3:14:05.220 --> 3:14:07.220]  now to the potential life or death problems
[3:14:07.220 --> 3:14:09.220]  that we face because we allowed a rigged election
[3:14:09.220 --> 3:14:12.220]  we face the real possibility of World War III
[3:14:12.220 --> 3:14:14.220]  with the Ukraine-Russia war
[3:14:14.220 --> 3:14:17.220]  are you ready to let your sons and daughters die
[3:14:17.220 --> 3:14:18.220]  for Ukraine?
[3:14:18.220 --> 3:14:20.220]  I know I'm not
[3:14:20.220 --> 3:14:22.220]  we face the real possibility of a nuclear war
[3:14:22.220 --> 3:14:25.220]  we are closer than at any time in modern history
[3:14:25.220 --> 3:14:28.220]  even the United Nations announced that days ago
[3:14:28.220 --> 3:14:30.220]  we're about to sign the Iran Treaty
[3:14:30.220 --> 3:14:32.220]  the worst deal in world history
[3:14:32.220 --> 3:14:36.220]  that hands nuclear weapons to the worst terrorist nation in the world
[3:14:36.220 --> 3:14:39.220]  China is almost certain to invade Taiwan
[3:14:39.220 --> 3:14:42.220]  which makes 95% of the crucial chips of the world
[3:14:42.220 --> 3:14:44.220]  without them we can't operate our computers
[3:14:44.220 --> 3:14:47.220]  our cell phones, our cars, our refrigerators, or ovens
[3:14:47.220 --> 3:14:50.220]  and then as a bonus we face financial collapse
[3:14:50.220 --> 3:14:53.220]  if we can't get enough gas to fill our gas tanks
[3:14:53.220 --> 3:14:57.220]  if the Russian money we just banned from our financial system
[3:14:57.220 --> 3:15:01.220]  undermines credit markets and causes the entire banking system to collapse
[3:15:01.220 --> 3:15:03.220]  and if our dollar collapses
[3:15:03.220 --> 3:15:05.220]  as the world's reserve currency
[3:15:05.220 --> 3:15:08.220]  these disasters are all on the table at this minute
[3:15:08.220 --> 3:15:11.220]  but what if several converge at the same time?
[3:15:11.220 --> 3:15:15.220]  at that point our country, your life, your children's future
[3:15:15.220 --> 3:15:17.220]  could be gone forever
[3:15:17.220 --> 3:15:20.220]  just like that all because we allowed a rigged election
[3:15:20.220 --> 3:15:22.220]  in the United States of America
[3:15:22.220 --> 3:15:24.220]  who are you going to vote for in November?
[3:15:24.220 --> 3:15:25.220]  if you vote Democrat
[3:15:25.220 --> 3:15:28.220]  you're officially suicidal
[3:15:28.220 --> 3:15:31.220]  P.S. let's go Brandon
[3:15:31.220 --> 3:15:33.220]  that's my column that's coming out this weekend
[3:15:33.220 --> 3:15:35.220]  Nationally syndicated by Crater Syndicate
[3:15:35.220 --> 3:15:38.220]  has one rigged election destroyed America forever
[3:15:38.220 --> 3:15:40.220]  the odds are against us
[3:15:40.220 --> 3:15:43.220]  I'm Wayne Ellerut, guest host today for Alex Jones
[3:15:43.220 --> 3:15:59.220]  see you in a sec
[3:16:13.220 --> 3:16:15.220]  corporate fascist world government
[3:16:15.220 --> 3:16:18.220]  that's why they launched their great recess
[3:16:18.220 --> 3:16:20.220]  and their program after collapsing us
[3:16:20.220 --> 3:16:22.220]  of Build Back Better
[3:16:22.220 --> 3:16:25.220]  this is nothing more than a top down
[3:16:25.220 --> 3:16:28.220]  vertical consolidation of the world economy
[3:16:28.220 --> 3:16:30.220]  and because they couldn't take our guns
[3:16:30.220 --> 3:16:31.220]  and because we wouldn't bow
[3:16:31.220 --> 3:16:32.220]  because the left
[3:16:32.220 --> 3:16:35.220]  which is the ideology of this world government system
[3:16:35.220 --> 3:16:36.220]  couldn't win
[3:16:36.220 --> 3:16:39.220]  they released a biological weapon on us
[3:16:39.220 --> 3:16:40.220]  now we know
[3:16:40.220 --> 3:16:43.220]  two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago
[3:16:43.220 --> 3:16:44.220]  it's that simple
[3:16:44.220 --> 3:16:46.220]  they can't beat us because of our free speech
[3:16:46.220 --> 3:16:47.220]  and our guns
[3:16:47.220 --> 3:16:50.220]  so the global corporate combine released COVID-19
[3:16:50.220 --> 3:16:51.220]  and you know the rest is history
[3:16:51.220 --> 3:16:54.220]  expose this paradigm and we win
[3:16:54.220 --> 3:16:59.220]  it's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022
[3:16:59.220 --> 3:17:01.220]  and in the month of February
[3:17:01.220 --> 3:17:03.220]  we had a very popular sale that was going
[3:17:03.220 --> 3:17:06.220]  of our flagship product the X3
[3:17:06.220 --> 3:17:09.220]  that has all three types of the amazing iodine
[3:17:09.220 --> 3:17:12.220]  your body needs for every electrochemical
[3:17:12.220 --> 3:17:14.220]  cellular activity in your body
[3:17:14.220 --> 3:17:17.220]  your immune system, your stamina, your libido
[3:17:17.220 --> 3:17:18.220]  so much
[3:17:18.220 --> 3:17:20.220]  and the majority of the population of the world
[3:17:20.220 --> 3:17:22.220]  is iodine deficient
[3:17:22.220 --> 3:17:24.220]  this is the very best iodine out there
[3:17:24.220 --> 3:17:26.220]  so we had on sale 50% off
[3:17:26.220 --> 3:17:28.220]  but we sold more than half of what we have
[3:17:28.220 --> 3:17:30.220]  or isn't going to come in for a long time
[3:17:30.220 --> 3:17:32.220]  so I took it back to full products
[3:17:32.220 --> 3:17:33.220]  and I was just thinking
[3:17:33.220 --> 3:17:34.220]  you know what
[3:17:34.220 --> 3:17:36.220]  we need the funds in now to stay on air
[3:17:36.220 --> 3:17:38.220]  plus this is the right product everybody needs
[3:17:38.220 --> 3:17:41.220]  so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence
[3:17:41.220 --> 3:17:43.220]  get X3 and experience it yourself
[3:17:43.220 --> 3:17:44.220]  and support the broadcast
[3:17:44.220 --> 3:17:46.220]  I'm going to keep it at 50% off
[3:17:46.220 --> 3:17:48.220]  until it sells out
[3:17:48.220 --> 3:17:51.220]  get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com
[3:17:51.220 --> 3:17:53.220]  for 50% off
[3:17:54.220 --> 3:17:55.220]  so I did it
[3:17:55.220 --> 3:17:57.220]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon
[3:17:57.220 --> 3:18:00.220]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be
[3:18:00.220 --> 3:18:02.220]  but thank goodness for prayer
[3:18:02.220 --> 3:18:05.220]  and thank goodness for infowarstore.com
[3:18:05.220 --> 3:18:07.220]  before I set out on a run
[3:18:07.220 --> 3:18:09.220]  I throw down some turbo force
[3:18:09.220 --> 3:18:11.220]  to give me that energy I need to get going
[3:18:11.220 --> 3:18:14.220]  you know besides the energy, turbo force
[3:18:14.220 --> 3:18:16.220]  it is giving me the vitamins I need
[3:18:16.220 --> 3:18:18.220]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy
[3:18:18.220 --> 3:18:20.220]  and the essential B vitamins
[3:18:20.220 --> 3:18:22.220]  plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[3:18:22.220 --> 3:18:25.220]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training
[3:18:25.220 --> 3:18:28.220]  and then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Soralis
[3:18:28.220 --> 3:18:30.220]  I have bad joints
[3:18:30.220 --> 3:18:31.220]  thanks mom
[3:18:31.220 --> 3:18:33.220]  so this is great for giving my joints
[3:18:33.220 --> 3:18:35.220]  the extra support they need right now
[3:18:35.220 --> 3:18:38.220]  information support and extra flexibility
[3:18:38.220 --> 3:18:40.220]  the quick release capsules help me recover fast
[3:18:40.220 --> 3:18:42.220]  so I can get back to the training
[3:18:42.220 --> 3:18:45.220]  even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon
[3:18:45.220 --> 3:18:47.220]  good news, turbo force
[3:18:47.220 --> 3:18:49.220]  that can still give you the energy and clarity you need
[3:18:49.220 --> 3:18:50.220]  for every day
[3:18:50.220 --> 3:18:52.220]  and Soralis can keep you moving
[3:18:52.220 --> 3:18:54.220]  and feeling great at any age
[3:18:54.220 --> 3:18:57.220]  two of our best selling products are back in stock
[3:18:57.220 --> 3:18:59.220]  infowarstore.com
[3:18:59.220 --> 3:19:01.220]  and they will sell out in the next 3-4 months
[3:19:01.220 --> 3:19:03.220]  before I get more of the product in
[3:19:03.220 --> 3:19:05.220]  full price
[3:19:05.220 --> 3:19:07.220]  but I want those of you that have been on the fence
[3:19:07.220 --> 3:19:09.220]  about getting Winter Sun or getting X3
[3:19:09.220 --> 3:19:11.220]  to try the products
[3:19:11.220 --> 3:19:13.220]  and see how amazing they are
[3:19:13.220 --> 3:19:15.220]  and I believe people then get hooked on them
[3:19:15.220 --> 3:19:17.220]  like myself and my family
[3:19:17.220 --> 3:19:19.220]  and the crew are
[3:19:19.220 --> 3:19:21.220]  so again, both these products are back in stock
[3:19:21.220 --> 3:19:23.220]  both X3 and Winter Sun
[3:19:23.220 --> 3:19:25.220]  they are 50% off for a limited time
[3:19:25.220 --> 3:19:28.220]  because they're going to sell out at this price
[3:19:28.220 --> 3:19:31.220]  I would estimate in less than a month
[3:19:31.220 --> 3:19:33.220]  so this is your chance to get X3
[3:19:33.220 --> 3:19:35.220]  and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens
[3:19:35.220 --> 3:19:37.220]  this is your chance to have the highest quality
[3:19:37.220 --> 3:19:39.220]  Vitamin D3 with Vitamin K
[3:19:39.220 --> 3:19:41.220]  for your muses as well
[3:19:41.220 --> 3:19:43.220]  they're amazing and they're at infowarstore.com
[3:19:43.220 --> 3:19:45.220]  and the reason this is a 360 win is
[3:19:45.220 --> 3:19:47.220]  it funds the operation
[3:19:47.220 --> 3:19:49.220]  I need funds to run the operation
[3:19:49.220 --> 3:19:51.220]  you need to be healthy, we need to stay on air
[3:19:51.220 --> 3:20:03.220]  it's a match made in heaven
[3:20:21.220 --> 3:20:23.220]  I hope you enjoyed this show

[3:20:57.220 --> 3:20:59.220]  Trump rules, my favorite book of all time
[3:20:59.220 --> 3:21:01.220]  is Trump rules, all the rules that made
[3:21:01.220 --> 3:21:03.220]  Donald Trump successful and wealthy
[3:21:03.220 --> 3:21:05.220]  and a world beater and a president of the United States
[3:21:05.220 --> 3:21:07.220]  and the biggest celebrity in the world
[3:21:07.220 --> 3:21:09.220]  and all the same rules that I used
[3:21:09.220 --> 3:21:11.220]  for 40 years, 39 years
[3:21:11.220 --> 3:21:13.220]  to be exact from the time I was a freshman
[3:21:13.220 --> 3:21:15.220]  at college and Trump was 15 years older than me
[3:21:15.220 --> 3:21:17.220]  and my hero and my mentor
[3:21:17.220 --> 3:21:19.220]  I studied Trump and I lived Trump
[3:21:19.220 --> 3:21:21.220]  and it made me into the super
[3:21:21.220 --> 3:21:23.220]  success that I've achieved in my life
[3:21:23.220 --> 3:21:25.220]  thank you Donald Trump, Trump rules was the book
[3:21:25.220 --> 3:21:27.220]  I wrote to honor all those
[3:21:27.220 --> 3:21:29.220]  ideals and habits
[3:21:29.220 --> 3:21:31.220]  that he taught me that made me successful
[3:21:31.220 --> 3:21:33.220]  and you can use the same habits and ideals
[3:21:33.220 --> 3:21:35.220]  Trump rules and you also
[3:21:35.220 --> 3:21:37.220]  get all my commentaries and all my video
[3:21:37.220 --> 3:21:39.220]  commentaries and all my video podcasts
[3:21:39.220 --> 3:21:41.220]  they're all at rootforamerica.com

[3:21:43.220 --> 3:21:45.220]  at gmail.com
[3:21:45.220 --> 3:21:47.220]  this isn't the news that I think are important for you
[3:21:47.220 --> 3:21:49.220]  Pfizer and the FDA
[3:21:49.220 --> 3:21:51.220]  hid data
[3:21:51.220 --> 3:21:53.220]  showing that their clinical trials
[3:21:53.220 --> 3:21:55.220]  failed says former
[3:21:55.220 --> 3:21:57.220]  BlackRock advisor
[3:21:57.220 --> 3:21:59.220]  so this was an interview
[3:21:59.220 --> 3:22:01.220]  I mean this is really important stuff
[3:22:01.220 --> 3:22:03.220]  with Naomi Wolf and by the way Donald Trump
[3:22:03.220 --> 3:22:05.220]  is leading a lawsuit against
[3:22:05.220 --> 3:22:07.220]  big tech, social media
[3:22:07.220 --> 3:22:09.220]  Silicon Valley
[3:22:09.220 --> 3:22:11.220]  that they centered us, that they banned us
[3:22:11.220 --> 3:22:13.220]  that they're terrible people and they've done
[3:22:13.220 --> 3:22:15.220]  misinterpreted us and they're biased and prejudiced
[3:22:15.220 --> 3:22:17.220]  and that lawsuit has
[3:22:17.220 --> 3:22:19.220]  I don't know, I think 50,000 people attached to it
[3:22:19.220 --> 3:22:21.220]  but two lead plaintiffs
[3:22:21.220 --> 3:22:23.220]  Wayne Allen Root, me
[3:22:23.220 --> 3:22:25.220]  and Naomi Wolf, Dr. Naomi Wolf
[3:22:25.220 --> 3:22:27.220]  I'm from the right and she's from the left
[3:22:27.220 --> 3:22:29.220]  but we both agree that they've done
[3:22:29.220 --> 3:22:31.220]  terrible censoring and banning
[3:22:31.220 --> 3:22:33.220]  of important information
[3:22:33.220 --> 3:22:35.220]  not only not misinformation
[3:22:35.220 --> 3:22:37.220]  but information you need to save your life
[3:22:37.220 --> 3:22:39.220]  and they banned it and so here's Naomi Wolf
[3:22:39.220 --> 3:22:41.220]  and she did an interview
[3:22:41.220 --> 3:22:43.220]  yesterday with a former BlackRock
[3:22:43.220 --> 3:22:45.220]  investment advisor who was a billionaire
[3:22:45.220 --> 3:22:47.220]  Edward Dowd and he explained
[3:22:47.220 --> 3:22:49.220]  why all the vaccine
[3:22:49.220 --> 3:22:51.220]  company stocks are crashing
[3:22:51.220 --> 3:22:53.220]  on Wall Street, one of them is down
[3:22:53.220 --> 3:22:55.220]  80%, I believe another one is down
[3:22:55.220 --> 3:22:57.220]  40%, another one is down 20%
[3:22:57.220 --> 3:22:59.220]  why are the vaccine
[3:22:59.220 --> 3:23:01.220]  drug companies flailing
[3:23:01.220 --> 3:23:03.220]  and collapsing
[3:23:03.220 --> 3:23:05.220]  on Wall Street and the answer is
[3:23:05.220 --> 3:23:07.220]  they know
[3:23:07.220 --> 3:23:09.220]  that the vaccines are killing people
[3:23:09.220 --> 3:23:11.220]  they know the vaccines are maiming people
[3:23:11.220 --> 3:23:13.220]  they know the vaccines are crippling people
[3:23:13.220 --> 3:23:15.220]  they know the vaccines are ruining
[3:23:15.220 --> 3:23:17.220]  people's lives and they know
[3:23:17.220 --> 3:23:19.220]  it's all coming out, it's spilling out
[3:23:19.220 --> 3:23:21.220]  their trials were a disaster
[3:23:21.220 --> 3:23:23.220]  but they hid them
[3:23:23.220 --> 3:23:25.220]  from the public and they tried
[3:23:25.220 --> 3:23:27.220]  to hide them for 75 years
[3:23:27.220 --> 3:23:29.220]  and that's what they were going to do
[3:23:31.220 --> 3:23:33.220]  and then a court came along
[3:23:33.220 --> 3:23:35.220]  a federal judge and he said
[3:23:35.220 --> 3:23:37.220]  you got to release them, I think it's
[3:23:37.220 --> 3:23:39.220]  80,000 pages a month
[3:23:39.220 --> 3:23:41.220]  so it's still going to take years to release
[3:23:41.220 --> 3:23:43.220]  all the pages of their clinical trials
[3:23:43.220 --> 3:23:45.220]  but so far what we've seen indicates
[3:23:45.220 --> 3:23:47.220]  they were a massive failure
[3:23:47.220 --> 3:23:49.220]  and this drug, this vaccine
[3:23:49.220 --> 3:23:51.220]  should have never been approved
[3:23:51.220 --> 3:23:53.220]  in a million years
[3:23:53.220 --> 3:23:55.220]  and so here's what
[3:23:55.220 --> 3:23:57.220]  Dowd is saying, this guy
[3:23:57.220 --> 3:23:59.220]  his name is Edward Dowd and he's a billionaire
[3:23:59.220 --> 3:24:01.220]  and a former BlackRock investment
[3:24:01.220 --> 3:24:03.220]  advisor, he described how the
[3:24:03.220 --> 3:24:05.220]  initial caution about taking
[3:24:05.220 --> 3:24:07.220]  the experimental COVID vaccine
[3:24:07.220 --> 3:24:09.220]  led him to research data related
[3:24:09.220 --> 3:24:11.220]  to Pfizer's clinical trials
[3:24:11.220 --> 3:24:13.220]  and he learned from a friend
[3:24:13.220 --> 3:24:15.220]  in the biotech industry
[3:24:15.220 --> 3:24:17.220]  that Pfizer had failed in its all-cause
[3:24:17.220 --> 3:24:19.220]  mortality endpoint in the trial
[3:24:19.220 --> 3:24:21.220]  all-cause mortality is
[3:24:21.220 --> 3:24:23.220]  the gold standard in any drug
[3:24:23.220 --> 3:24:25.220]  trial at the FDA
[3:24:25.220 --> 3:24:27.220]  and if you fail the endpoint
[3:24:27.220 --> 3:24:29.220]  the drug is never approved
[3:24:29.220 --> 3:24:31.220]  but they failed and they pushed
[3:24:31.220 --> 3:24:33.220]  the vaccine through anyway
[3:24:33.220 --> 3:24:35.220]  despite the deaths
[3:24:35.220 --> 3:24:37.220]  despite the horrible side effects
[3:24:37.220 --> 3:24:39.220]  despite the permanent injuries
[3:24:39.220 --> 3:24:41.220]  despite the disabling injuries
[3:24:41.220 --> 3:24:43.220]  and then they tried to
[3:24:43.220 --> 3:24:45.220]  hide the critical data
[3:24:45.220 --> 3:24:47.220]  for 75 years
[3:24:47.220 --> 3:24:49.220]  and then this guy Dowd
[3:24:49.220 --> 3:24:51.220]  talks about something I've talked about
[3:24:51.220 --> 3:24:53.220]  on my national radio show
[3:24:53.220 --> 3:24:55.220]  and on Alex Jones' show and everywhere I go
[3:24:55.220 --> 3:24:57.220]  for many, many months but real people
[3:24:57.220 --> 3:24:59.220]  serious Wall Street people
[3:24:59.220 --> 3:25:01.220]  are beginning to talk about this
[3:25:01.220 --> 3:25:03.220]  and get scared about it
[3:25:03.220 --> 3:25:05.220]  which is funeral homes
[3:25:05.220 --> 3:25:07.220]  and the directors of funeral homes
[3:25:07.220 --> 3:25:09.220]  funeral directors and
[3:25:09.220 --> 3:25:11.220]  insurance companies, life insurance companies
[3:25:11.220 --> 3:25:13.220]  are all reporting that
[3:25:13.220 --> 3:25:15.220]  deaths are skyrocketing
[3:25:15.220 --> 3:25:17.220]  they're up 40%
[3:25:17.220 --> 3:25:19.220]  across the United States of America
[3:25:19.220 --> 3:25:21.220]  deaths are up
[3:25:21.220 --> 3:25:23.220]  40% heart attacks
[3:25:23.220 --> 3:25:25.220]  strokes
[3:25:25.220 --> 3:25:27.220]  multi-organ failure
[3:25:27.220 --> 3:25:29.220]  all the ways of dying that are side effects
[3:25:29.220 --> 3:25:31.220]  of the vaccine and nobody
[3:25:31.220 --> 3:25:33.220]  wants to say it
[3:25:33.220 --> 3:25:35.220]  that it's the vaccine
[3:25:35.220 --> 3:25:37.220]  how would James Carville say it
[3:25:37.220 --> 3:25:39.220]  it's the vaccine stupid
[3:25:39.220 --> 3:25:41.220]  how could you not see that
[3:25:41.220 --> 3:25:43.220]  never have people died like they're dying now
[3:25:43.220 --> 3:25:45.220]  never have athletes dropped of heart attacks
[3:25:45.220 --> 3:25:47.220]  never have you seen a 4 year old child
[3:25:47.220 --> 3:25:49.220]  get a heart attack and die
[3:25:49.220 --> 3:25:51.220]  14 days after getting
[3:25:51.220 --> 3:25:53.220]  the vaccine for Covid
[3:25:53.220 --> 3:25:55.220]  never in history
[3:25:55.220 --> 3:25:57.220]  have you seen anything like this
[3:25:57.220 --> 3:25:59.220]  Thomas Rennes
[3:25:59.220 --> 3:26:01.220]  a wonderful class action lawyer
[3:26:01.220 --> 3:26:03.220]  suing the United States government
[3:26:03.220 --> 3:26:05.220]  and the military and the Department of Defense
[3:26:05.220 --> 3:26:07.220]  because they're hiding
[3:26:07.220 --> 3:26:09.220]  he's got whistleblowers who brought
[3:26:09.220 --> 3:26:11.220]  the real statistics on floppy disks
[3:26:11.220 --> 3:26:13.220]  they grabbed them before they got erased
[3:26:13.220 --> 3:26:15.220]  by the government and they've been erased
[3:26:15.220 --> 3:26:17.220]  which shows you pure fraud
[3:26:17.220 --> 3:26:19.220]  they're covering up the deaths
[3:26:19.220 --> 3:26:21.220]  they're covering up the illnesses
[3:26:21.220 --> 3:26:23.220]  they're covering up the permanent disabilities
[3:26:23.220 --> 3:26:25.220]  and so Thomas Rennes says
[3:26:25.220 --> 3:26:27.220]  the vaccine in these Department of Defense
[3:26:27.220 --> 3:26:29.220]  files from these whistleblowers
[3:26:29.220 --> 3:26:31.220]  who took them from the government
[3:26:31.220 --> 3:26:33.220]  before they could be erased
[3:26:33.220 --> 3:26:35.220]  is every injury imaginable
[3:26:35.220 --> 3:26:37.220]  that's a vaccine side effect
[3:26:37.220 --> 3:26:39.220]  up 200 percent
[3:26:39.220 --> 3:26:41.220]  300 percent
[3:26:41.220 --> 3:26:43.220]  500 percent a thousand percent
[3:26:43.220 --> 3:26:45.220]  in the year 2021
[3:26:45.220 --> 3:26:47.220]  the first year they gave vaccines
[3:26:47.220 --> 3:26:49.220]  there's no other reason
[3:26:49.220 --> 3:26:51.220]  why deaths are up like this
[3:26:51.220 --> 3:26:53.220]  ask any life insurance company in America
[3:26:53.220 --> 3:26:55.220]  the world deaths are skyrocketing
[3:26:55.220 --> 3:26:57.220]  and there's no other reason
[3:26:57.220 --> 3:26:59.220]  it would happen except it all happened
[3:26:59.220 --> 3:27:01.220]  in the first year of the vaccines
[3:27:01.220 --> 3:27:03.220]  and Pfizer held back
[3:27:03.220 --> 3:27:05.220]  all that information
[3:27:05.220 --> 3:27:07.220]  and the US government the Department of Defense
[3:27:07.220 --> 3:27:09.220]  evidently allegedly
[3:27:09.220 --> 3:27:11.220]  is erasing that information
[3:27:11.220 --> 3:27:13.220]  by the way everything I say on this show
[3:27:13.220 --> 3:27:15.220]  and my show and every show
[3:27:15.220 --> 3:27:17.220]  I'm an opinion guy
[3:27:17.220 --> 3:27:19.220]  I'm a common sense guy
[3:27:19.220 --> 3:27:21.220]  I'm a gut instinct guy
[3:27:21.220 --> 3:27:23.220]  it's my opinion that
[3:27:23.220 --> 3:27:25.220]  these are all public figures
[3:27:25.220 --> 3:27:27.220]  public information and I'm an opinion guy
[3:27:27.220 --> 3:27:29.220]  and the free speech country
[3:27:29.220 --> 3:27:31.220]  you have a right to give your opinion
[3:27:31.220 --> 3:27:33.220]  even if it's a sense with the government
[3:27:33.220 --> 3:27:35.220]  and even if the government doesn't like it
[3:27:35.220 --> 3:27:37.220]  and even if it's different than the media
[3:27:37.220 --> 3:27:39.220]  and the media doesn't like it tough
[3:27:39.220 --> 3:27:41.220]  it's my opinion
[3:27:41.220 --> 3:27:43.220]  something very very bad is going on
[3:27:43.220 --> 3:27:45.220]  and speaking of bad going on
[3:27:45.220 --> 3:27:47.220]  we have just a minute to go
[3:27:47.220 --> 3:27:49.220]  let me just give you a preview of what I'll have to talk about
[3:27:49.220 --> 3:27:51.220]  in the second half of this
[3:27:51.220 --> 3:27:53.220]  hour this wane root hour as guest host
[3:27:53.220 --> 3:27:55.220]  for Alex Jones the great Alex Jones
[3:27:55.220 --> 3:27:57.220]  inflation
[3:27:57.220 --> 3:27:59.220]  more proof that inflation
[3:27:59.220 --> 3:28:01.220]  is raging it's the biggest
[3:28:01.220 --> 3:28:03.220]  possible tax increase on you
[3:28:03.220 --> 3:28:05.220]  and the middle class and small business
[3:28:05.220 --> 3:28:07.220]  it is a nightmare if I told
[3:28:07.220 --> 3:28:09.220]  you were raising your taxes
[3:28:09.220 --> 3:28:11.220]  by 20% overnight
[3:28:11.220 --> 3:28:13.220]  you get to keep 20% less your own money
[3:28:13.220 --> 3:28:15.220]  you'd go my god I can't survive that
[3:28:15.220 --> 3:28:17.220]  well inflation is up
[3:28:17.220 --> 3:28:19.220]  about 20%
[3:28:19.220 --> 3:28:21.220]  you've got 20% less spending money
[3:28:21.220 --> 3:28:23.220]  when you look at your bank account
[3:28:23.220 --> 3:28:25.220]  it's inflated you have 20% less money
[3:28:25.220 --> 3:28:27.220]  than you're seeing and when you spend at the store
[3:28:27.220 --> 3:28:29.220]  it's up 20%
[3:28:29.220 --> 3:28:31.220]  so I'll have more information about that
[3:28:31.220 --> 3:28:33.220]  and the government watching everything we do
[3:28:33.220 --> 3:28:35.220]  and calling us extremists
[3:28:35.220 --> 3:28:37.220]  and domestic terrorists
[3:28:37.220 --> 3:28:39.220]  for merely telling the truth
[3:28:39.220 --> 3:28:41.220]  asking questions and passing on
[3:28:41.220 --> 3:28:43.220]  pertinent information
[3:28:43.220 --> 3:28:45.220]  we're becoming like a Nazi Russian police state
[3:28:45.220 --> 3:28:47.220]  I'll be right back
[3:28:47.220 --> 3:28:49.220]  wane hour root guest host for Alex Jones
[3:28:49.220 --> 3:29:17.220]  today
[3:29:17.220 --> 3:29:19.220]  just below the pedals
[3:29:19.220 --> 3:29:21.220]  that contain the rose plant seeds
[3:29:21.220 --> 3:29:23.220]  natural chemicals found in the hips
[3:29:23.220 --> 3:29:25.220]  may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[3:29:25.220 --> 3:29:27.220]  including those with osteoarthritis
[3:29:27.220 --> 3:29:29.220]  and for those with pain after surgery
[3:29:29.220 --> 3:29:31.220]  studies have shown
[3:29:31.220 --> 3:29:33.220]  as for vitamin c and zinc themselves
[3:29:33.220 --> 3:29:35.220]  you probably already know that they play
[3:29:35.220 --> 3:29:37.220]  an important role in nutrition
[3:29:37.220 --> 3:29:39.220]  immune defense and the maintenance
[3:29:39.220 --> 3:29:41.220]  of your everyday health
[3:29:41.220 --> 3:29:43.220]  it has been reported that intake of both
[3:29:43.220 --> 3:29:45.220]  is often inadequate
[3:29:45.220 --> 3:29:47.220]  for populations like here in America
[3:29:47.220 --> 3:29:49.220]  so next time you visit be sure to check it out
[3:29:49.220 --> 3:29:51.220]  at inforstore.com
[3:29:51.220 --> 3:29:53.220]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie
[3:29:53.220 --> 3:29:55.220]  it's hard to believe
[3:29:55.220 --> 3:29:57.220]  that we're already into March
[3:29:57.220 --> 3:29:59.220]  2022
[3:29:59.220 --> 3:30:01.220]  and in the month of February
[3:30:01.220 --> 3:30:03.220]  we had a very popular sale that was going
[3:30:03.220 --> 3:30:05.220]  of our flagship product
[3:30:05.220 --> 3:30:07.220]  x3 that has all three
[3:30:07.220 --> 3:30:09.220]  types of the amazing iodine
[3:30:09.220 --> 3:30:11.220]  your body needs for every
[3:30:11.220 --> 3:30:13.220]  electrochemical, cellular
[3:30:13.220 --> 3:30:15.220]  activity in your body
[3:30:15.220 --> 3:30:17.220]  your immune system, your stamina
[3:30:17.220 --> 3:30:19.220]  your libido, so much
[3:30:19.220 --> 3:30:21.220]  and the majority of the population in the world
[3:30:21.220 --> 3:30:23.220]  is iodine deficient
[3:30:23.220 --> 3:30:25.220]  this is the very best iodine output
[3:30:25.220 --> 3:30:27.220]  so we had on sale 50% off
[3:30:27.220 --> 3:30:29.220]  but we sold more than half of what we have
[3:30:29.220 --> 3:30:31.220]  or isn't going to come in for a long time
[3:30:31.220 --> 3:30:33.220]  so I took it back to full products
[3:30:33.220 --> 3:30:35.220]  and I was just thinking, you know what
[3:30:35.220 --> 3:30:37.220]  we need to funds in now to stay on air
[3:30:37.220 --> 3:30:39.220]  plus this is the right product everybody needs
[3:30:39.220 --> 3:30:41.220]  so to incentivize folks out there
[3:30:41.220 --> 3:30:43.220]  to get x3 and experience it yourself
[3:30:43.220 --> 3:30:45.220]  and support the broadcast
[3:30:45.220 --> 3:30:47.220]  I'm going to keep it at 50% off until
[3:30:47.220 --> 3:30:49.220]  it sells out
[3:30:49.220 --> 3:30:51.220]  get x3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com
[3:30:51.220 --> 3:31:11.220]  for 50% off
[3:31:21.220 --> 3:31:31.220]  I have a few ideas
[3:31:31.220 --> 3:31:33.220]  first of all
[3:31:33.220 --> 3:31:35.220]  a rest fountain, a rest fountain
[3:31:35.220 --> 3:31:37.220]  a vaccine is poison
[3:31:37.220 --> 3:31:39.220]  keep it short, keep it concise
[3:31:39.220 --> 3:31:41.220]  no I agree, a rest fountain
[3:31:41.220 --> 3:31:43.220]  a rest bill gates, the cupboard backs
[3:31:43.220 --> 3:31:45.220]  is poison, beautiful
[3:31:45.220 --> 3:31:47.220]  there's ways that we could all be involved
[3:31:47.220 --> 3:31:49.220]  that we could all be affected
[3:31:49.220 --> 3:31:51.220]  I really appreciate you
[3:31:51.220 --> 3:31:53.220]  calling us today
[3:31:53.220 --> 3:31:55.220]  thank you so much
[3:31:55.220 --> 3:31:57.220]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal
[3:31:57.220 --> 3:31:59.220]  for all our great info wars listeners and viewers
[3:31:59.220 --> 3:32:01.220]  if you will simply
[3:32:01.220 --> 3:32:03.220]  get x3
[3:32:03.220 --> 3:32:05.220]  with all three types of good iodine
[3:32:05.220 --> 3:32:07.220]  that boosts your immune system and help
[3:32:07.220 --> 3:32:09.220]  everything that goes on your body
[3:32:09.220 --> 3:32:11.220]  at the cellular level
[3:32:11.220 --> 3:32:13.220]  it will change your life, it will invigorate you
[3:32:13.220 --> 3:32:15.220]  it will empower you
[3:32:15.220 --> 3:32:17.220]  almost everyone has iodine deficiency
[3:32:17.220 --> 3:32:19.220]  it's the opposite of fluoride
[3:32:19.220 --> 3:32:21.220]  it's the good halogen
[3:32:21.220 --> 3:32:23.220]  and then your purchase of x3
[3:32:23.220 --> 3:32:25.220]  funds our operation
[3:32:25.220 --> 3:32:27.220]  now a lot of our products have been sold out
[3:32:27.220 --> 3:32:29.220]  and never came back in because of the lock downs
[3:32:29.220 --> 3:32:31.220]  and supply chain break downs
[3:32:31.220 --> 3:32:33.220]  we were sold out of x3 for a long time
[3:32:33.220 --> 3:32:35.220]  and I had it on sale for 50% off
[3:32:35.220 --> 3:32:37.220]  a lot of folks have been getting it
[3:32:37.220 --> 3:32:39.220]  and I was thinking, you know what, I'm going to bring it back on sale
[3:32:39.220 --> 3:32:41.220]  again just until it sells out
[3:32:41.220 --> 3:32:43.220]  because even though we won't make as much money in the long run
[3:32:43.220 --> 3:32:45.220]  a lot of folks need this product
[3:32:45.220 --> 3:32:47.220]  and we need to get the money from the sales
[3:32:47.220 --> 3:32:49.220]  in now to stay on air
[3:32:49.220 --> 3:32:51.220]  see your x3 right now at 50% off
[3:32:51.220 --> 3:32:53.220]  at inforwarstore.com
[3:32:55.220 --> 3:32:57.220]  Leading a frontal assault
[3:32:57.220 --> 3:32:59.220]  on the lies of the New World Order
[3:32:59.220 --> 3:33:01.220]  it's Alex Jones
[3:33:01.220 --> 3:33:03.220]  All right, Wayne Allerud
[3:33:03.220 --> 3:33:05.220]  welcome back guest host today
[3:33:05.220 --> 3:33:07.220]  from 12 to 1 o'clock
[3:33:07.220 --> 3:33:09.220]  West Coast time
[3:33:09.220 --> 3:33:11.220]  for the Alex Jones show
[3:33:11.220 --> 3:33:13.220]  that of course means
[3:33:13.220 --> 3:33:15.220]  3 o'clock to 4 o'clock
[3:33:15.220 --> 3:33:17.220]  East Coast time, Wayne Allerud
[3:33:17.220 --> 3:33:19.220]  it's war time
[3:33:19.220 --> 3:33:21.220]  the root, the root, the roots
[3:33:21.220 --> 3:33:23.220]  on fire
[3:33:23.220 --> 3:33:25.220]  and so is the country
[3:33:25.220 --> 3:33:27.220]  and so is the world
[3:33:27.220 --> 3:33:29.220]  unfortunately
[3:33:29.220 --> 3:33:31.220]  under Joe Biden
[3:33:31.220 --> 3:33:33.220]  otherwise known, I call him O Biden
[3:33:33.220 --> 3:33:35.220]  because it's the Obama administration
[3:33:35.220 --> 3:33:37.220]  third term of the Obama administration
[3:33:37.220 --> 3:33:39.220]  and Obama in my opinion
[3:33:39.220 --> 3:33:41.220]  is the real president of the United States
[3:33:41.220 --> 3:33:43.220]  you know, I was in San Diego over the weekend
[3:33:43.220 --> 3:33:45.220]  I gave a speech at the reawaken America tour
[3:33:45.220 --> 3:33:47.220]  it was myself
[3:33:47.220 --> 3:33:49.220]  and General Flynn
[3:33:49.220 --> 3:33:51.220]  and Eric Trump
[3:33:51.220 --> 3:33:53.220]  among a few others
[3:33:53.220 --> 3:33:55.220]  and then I had a two hour line for my book
[3:33:55.220 --> 3:33:57.220]  signing and photographs
[3:33:57.220 --> 3:33:59.220]  and what an audience
[3:33:59.220 --> 3:34:01.220]  about 3,000 people at the Awaken Church
[3:34:01.220 --> 3:34:03.220]  in San Diego
[3:34:03.220 --> 3:34:05.220]  and I got a standing ovation
[3:34:05.220 --> 3:34:07.220]  because I told people the truth
[3:34:07.220 --> 3:34:09.220]  wherever I go I tell the truth
[3:34:09.220 --> 3:34:11.220]  I tell them the truth
[3:34:11.220 --> 3:34:13.220]  the media thought they killed Trump
[3:34:13.220 --> 3:34:15.220]  he's gone, he's finished, he's ruined
[3:34:15.220 --> 3:34:17.220]  especially after January 6th
[3:34:17.220 --> 3:34:19.220]  he's ruined and we love him
[3:34:19.220 --> 3:34:21.220]  and he's bigger than ever before
[3:34:21.220 --> 3:34:23.220]  and I told the audience
[3:34:23.220 --> 3:34:25.220]  one thing I know in life
[3:34:25.220 --> 3:34:27.220]  as much as I know that
[3:34:27.220 --> 3:34:29.220]  as much as I know the day I was born
[3:34:29.220 --> 3:34:31.220]  and where I was born am I so scaredy number
[3:34:31.220 --> 3:34:33.220]  as much as I know how much I love my kids
[3:34:33.220 --> 3:34:35.220]  and my wife Cindy
[3:34:35.220 --> 3:34:37.220]  as much as I know that
[3:34:37.220 --> 3:34:39.220]  I know in every single part
[3:34:39.220 --> 3:34:41.220]  of my body and my bones
[3:34:41.220 --> 3:34:43.220]  and my blood, in my capillaries
[3:34:43.220 --> 3:34:45.220]  in my veins
[3:34:45.220 --> 3:34:47.220]  that we won the election in 2020
[3:34:47.220 --> 3:34:49.220]  Donald Trump is the real president of the United States
[3:34:49.220 --> 3:34:51.220]  standing ovation
[3:34:51.220 --> 3:34:53.220]  and I know that Joe Biden is the illegitimate
[3:34:53.220 --> 3:34:55.220]  president of the United States
[3:34:55.220 --> 3:34:57.220]  he is not my president
[3:34:57.220 --> 3:34:59.220]  standing ovation
[3:34:59.220 --> 3:35:01.220]  the crowd loves it when you tell the truth
[3:35:01.220 --> 3:35:03.220]  it was a rigged election
[3:35:03.220 --> 3:35:05.220]  and it doesn't take a brain surgeon
[3:35:05.220 --> 3:35:07.220]  I'm not blaming Dominion
[3:35:07.220 --> 3:35:09.220]  I'm not coming up with any ideas
[3:35:09.220 --> 3:35:11.220]  that could be considered crazy
[3:35:11.220 --> 3:35:13.220]  it was so simple what they did
[3:35:13.220 --> 3:35:15.220]  and maybe they did other things
[3:35:15.220 --> 3:35:17.220]  maybe others were involved
[3:35:17.220 --> 3:35:19.220]  I just never got involved in the Dominion talk
[3:35:19.220 --> 3:35:21.220]  and the changing of votes
[3:35:21.220 --> 3:35:23.220]  the only thing I ever got involved in
[3:35:23.220 --> 3:35:25.220]  is hey, Trump was winning
[3:35:25.220 --> 3:35:27.220]  every state he had to
[3:35:27.220 --> 3:35:29.220]  Trump was winning every bellwether county in America
[3:35:29.220 --> 3:35:31.220]  Trump was winning every vote that mattered
[3:35:31.220 --> 3:35:33.220]  every battleground state
[3:35:33.220 --> 3:35:35.220]  and then at midnight for the first time in the history of America
[3:35:35.220 --> 3:35:37.220]  they stopped
[3:35:37.220 --> 3:35:39.220]  counting and they said
[3:35:39.220 --> 3:35:41.220]  we'll pick it up in the morning
[3:35:41.220 --> 3:35:43.220]  and when you woke up in the morning
[3:35:43.220 --> 3:35:45.220]  they had already picked it up and said that Biden is the winner
[3:35:45.220 --> 3:35:47.220]  and they found hundreds of thousands
[3:35:47.220 --> 3:35:49.220]  of new votes out of thin air all for Biden
[3:35:49.220 --> 3:35:51.220]  none for Trump
[3:35:51.220 --> 3:35:53.220]  oh that's not a problem
[3:35:53.220 --> 3:35:55.220]  all based on COVID
[3:35:55.220 --> 3:35:57.220]  and the fact that they changed the law
[3:35:57.220 --> 3:35:59.220]  in all these battleground states
[3:35:59.220 --> 3:36:01.220]  to allow mail-in ballots
[3:36:01.220 --> 3:36:03.220]  and they found them under their deskin
[3:36:03.220 --> 3:36:05.220]  suitcases
[3:36:05.220 --> 3:36:07.220]  and they found them in vans in the middle of the night
[3:36:07.220 --> 3:36:09.220]  delivered to voting centers
[3:36:09.220 --> 3:36:11.220]  and they kicked all the witnesses out
[3:36:11.220 --> 3:36:13.220]  and suddenly Biden was the winner
[3:36:13.220 --> 3:36:15.220]  not Trump
[3:36:15.220 --> 3:36:17.220]  it's hilarious
[3:36:17.220 --> 3:36:19.220]  it's not a total complete moron
[3:36:19.220 --> 3:36:21.220]  is that not evidence and proof
[3:36:21.220 --> 3:36:23.220]  that the election was stolen
[3:36:23.220 --> 3:36:25.220]  you're an idiot if you don't believe
[3:36:25.220 --> 3:36:27.220]  that that tells you the election was mass fraud
[3:36:27.220 --> 3:36:29.220]  and the election was stolen but on top of that
[3:36:29.220 --> 3:36:31.220]  on top of that
[3:36:31.220 --> 3:36:33.220]  the fact that they now tell you
[3:36:33.220 --> 3:36:35.220]  if you talk about it
[3:36:35.220 --> 3:36:37.220]  you should be banned for life
[3:36:37.220 --> 3:36:39.220]  if you talk about it
[3:36:39.220 --> 3:36:41.220]  you shouldn't be able to talk anymore
[3:36:41.220 --> 3:36:43.220]  I should lose my show for talking about it
[3:36:43.220 --> 3:36:45.220]  in America
[3:36:45.220 --> 3:36:47.220]  what?
[3:36:47.220 --> 3:36:49.220]  didn't the Democrats talk about the election
[3:36:49.220 --> 3:36:51.220]  was stolen by Trump in 16
[3:36:51.220 --> 3:36:53.220]  in Russian collusion day and night
[3:36:53.220 --> 3:36:55.220]  and weren't they proven to be complete liars
[3:36:55.220 --> 3:36:57.220]  and it was a fraud made up by Hillary Clinton
[3:36:57.220 --> 3:36:59.220]  and nobody told them they should be banned
[3:36:59.220 --> 3:37:01.220]  nobody ever banned them
[3:37:01.220 --> 3:37:03.220]  from Twitter or Facebook or social media
[3:37:05.220 --> 3:37:07.220]  but if a Republican talks about a stolen election
[3:37:07.220 --> 3:37:09.220]  you're a horrible person
[3:37:09.220 --> 3:37:11.220]  and you've got to be ex-nade from society
[3:37:11.220 --> 3:37:13.220]  that's all you need to know
[3:37:13.220 --> 3:37:15.220]  to prove the election was stolen
[3:37:15.220 --> 3:37:17.220]  that we're not allowed to talk about it
[3:37:17.220 --> 3:37:19.220]  well the FBI
[3:37:19.220 --> 3:37:21.220]  knocks on your door
[3:37:21.220 --> 3:37:23.220]  how insane
[3:37:23.220 --> 3:37:25.220]  my gosh can't talk about it
[3:37:25.220 --> 3:37:27.220]  what a joke
[3:37:27.220 --> 3:37:29.220]  can you talk about the fact
[3:37:29.220 --> 3:37:31.220]  this is my favorite
[3:37:31.220 --> 3:37:33.220]  probably my favorite proof the election was stolen
[3:37:33.220 --> 3:37:35.220]  in Georgia
[3:37:35.220 --> 3:37:37.220]  the Georgia
[3:37:37.220 --> 3:37:39.220]  I guess it's board of elections whoever it is
[3:37:39.220 --> 3:37:41.220]  you have to mail in ballots
[3:37:41.220 --> 3:37:43.220]  and ballots and county votes
[3:37:43.220 --> 3:37:45.220]  that Georgia
[3:37:45.220 --> 3:37:47.220]  state election agency
[3:37:47.220 --> 3:37:49.220]  paid for a million
[3:37:49.220 --> 3:37:51.220]  mail-in ballots
[3:37:51.220 --> 3:37:53.220]  to be printed a few days before election day
[3:37:53.220 --> 3:37:55.220]  now keep in mind what mail-in ballots
[3:37:55.220 --> 3:37:57.220]  are for
[3:37:57.220 --> 3:37:59.220]  you have to mail them to someone
[3:37:59.220 --> 3:38:01.220]  they only ordered the printing
[3:38:01.220 --> 3:38:03.220]  like three or four days before the election
[3:38:03.220 --> 3:38:05.220]  they didn't get it back
[3:38:05.220 --> 3:38:07.220]  to the day before the election
[3:38:07.220 --> 3:38:09.220]  they had a million mail-in ballots
[3:38:09.220 --> 3:38:11.220]  they couldn't have been mailed to anyone
[3:38:11.220 --> 3:38:13.220]  that could have voted
[3:38:13.220 --> 3:38:15.220]  they wasted tens of millions of dollars
[3:38:15.220 --> 3:38:17.220]  of taxpayer money
[3:38:17.220 --> 3:38:19.220]  or did they
[3:38:19.220 --> 3:38:21.220]  because obviously what they did
[3:38:21.220 --> 3:38:23.220]  is they ordered them so they could be used
[3:38:23.220 --> 3:38:25.220]  after the election
[3:38:25.220 --> 3:38:27.220]  once they knew on election night
[3:38:27.220 --> 3:38:29.220]  what kind of lead Trump had
[3:38:29.220 --> 3:38:31.220]  they had a million ballots
[3:38:31.220 --> 3:38:33.220]  to fill them out quickly
[3:38:33.220 --> 3:38:35.220]  and get them in for whatever lead Trump had
[3:38:35.220 --> 3:38:37.220]  they had a million vote lead in Georgia
[3:38:37.220 --> 3:38:39.220]  and there's no way they were going to overcome that
[3:38:39.220 --> 3:38:41.220]  except they were ready for a 990,000
[3:38:41.220 --> 3:38:43.220]  vote lead
[3:38:43.220 --> 3:38:45.220]  they had a million fake ballots
[3:38:45.220 --> 3:38:47.220]  that they could fill in and hand in
[3:38:47.220 --> 3:38:49.220]  in the days after the election
[3:38:49.220 --> 3:38:51.220]  whatever the total was in election night
[3:38:51.220 --> 3:38:53.220]  they always knew they'd beat it
[3:38:53.220 --> 3:38:55.220]  same thing in Pennsylvania
[3:38:55.220 --> 3:38:57.220]  they always knew they'd beat it
[3:38:57.220 --> 3:38:59.220]  who orders ballots to be printed
[3:38:59.220 --> 3:39:01.220]  mail-in ballots
[3:39:01.220 --> 3:39:03.220]  only days before the election
[3:39:03.220 --> 3:39:05.220]  they mailed them out to anyone
[3:39:05.220 --> 3:39:07.220]  anyway we know the election was stolen
[3:39:07.220 --> 3:39:09.220]  and
[3:39:09.220 --> 3:39:11.220]  now you see the results of a stolen election
[3:39:11.220 --> 3:39:13.220]  your kids and my kids may wind up
[3:39:13.220 --> 3:39:15.220]  in World War 3
[3:39:15.220 --> 3:39:17.220]  and dying because we elected
[3:39:17.220 --> 3:39:19.220]  an old
[3:39:19.220 --> 3:39:21.220]  feeble man
[3:39:21.220 --> 3:39:23.220]  a clueless zombie puppet with dementia
[3:39:23.220 --> 3:39:25.220]  who doesn't know what he's doing
[3:39:25.220 --> 3:39:27.220]  and the real leader of the country is Obama
[3:39:27.220 --> 3:39:29.220]  and the guy who gives Obama his orders
[3:39:29.220 --> 3:39:31.220]  is clearly George Soros
[3:39:31.220 --> 3:39:33.220]  Chinese Communist Party
[3:39:33.220 --> 3:39:35.220]  China clearly owns this presidency
[3:39:35.220 --> 3:39:37.220]  and George Soros clearly owns
[3:39:37.220 --> 3:39:39.220]  this presidency
[3:39:39.220 --> 3:39:41.220]  and their goal is to destroy the United States
[3:39:41.220 --> 3:39:43.220]  and they're doing a damn fine job
[3:39:43.220 --> 3:39:45.220]  of it every single day
[3:39:45.220 --> 3:39:47.220]  but you know what's the real problem
[3:39:47.220 --> 3:39:49.220]  we have to fight with the Republicans too
[3:39:49.220 --> 3:39:51.220]  there's George Soros up on the screen
[3:39:51.220 --> 3:39:53.220]  but it's the Rhino Republicans in the end
[3:39:53.220 --> 3:39:55.220]  that really let us down
[3:39:55.220 --> 3:39:57.220]  let me give you a couple good examples
[3:39:57.220 --> 3:39:59.220]  so right now in the news
[3:39:59.220 --> 3:40:01.220]  is Lindsey Graham
[3:40:01.220 --> 3:40:03.220]  good old Lindsey Graham
[3:40:03.220 --> 3:40:05.220]  Senator of South Carolina says
[3:40:05.220 --> 3:40:07.220]  Biden is as good a man as God
[3:40:07.220 --> 3:40:09.220]  ever created
[3:40:09.220 --> 3:40:11.220]  and Biden needs to go after anybody
[3:40:11.220 --> 3:40:13.220]  and everybody who tries to defend
[3:40:13.220 --> 3:40:15.220]  Putin
[3:40:15.220 --> 3:40:17.220]  folks
[3:40:17.220 --> 3:40:19.220]  in the history of America
[3:40:19.220 --> 3:40:21.220]  nobody has ever said things like this
[3:40:21.220 --> 3:40:23.220]  no one has ever said if you defend Putin
[3:40:23.220 --> 3:40:25.220]  or defend Russia
[3:40:25.220 --> 3:40:27.220]  or you're against us giving money to Ukraine
[3:40:27.220 --> 3:40:29.220]  you don't want us fighting World War 3 over Ukraine
[3:40:29.220 --> 3:40:31.220]  and you don't want your American
[3:40:31.220 --> 3:40:33.220]  children dying
[3:40:33.220 --> 3:40:35.220]  boys and girls dying in Ukraine
[3:40:35.220 --> 3:40:37.220]  like they died in Vietnam
[3:40:37.220 --> 3:40:39.220]  that you're a bad person
[3:40:39.220 --> 3:40:41.220]  do you remember people protesting horribly
[3:40:41.220 --> 3:40:43.220]  against the Vietnam War
[3:40:43.220 --> 3:40:45.220]  they were all bunch of hippies and liberals
[3:40:45.220 --> 3:40:47.220]  and commies and flag burners
[3:40:47.220 --> 3:40:49.220]  and losers and pot smokers
[3:40:49.220 --> 3:40:51.220]  but nobody ever did anything to them
[3:40:51.220 --> 3:40:53.220]  you're allowed to protest in America
[3:40:53.220 --> 3:40:55.220]  but all of a sudden
[3:40:55.220 --> 3:40:57.220]  we know a Republican like Lindsey Graham
[3:40:57.220 --> 3:40:59.220]  says you have no right to protest
[3:40:59.220 --> 3:41:01.220]  come on
[3:41:01.220 --> 3:41:03.220]  how horrible is this
[3:41:03.220 --> 3:41:05.220]  doesn't anybody see that we're becoming
[3:41:05.220 --> 3:41:07.220]  Russia, Soviet Union
[3:41:07.220 --> 3:41:09.220]  Nazi Germany
[3:41:09.220 --> 3:41:11.220]  can you not see that
[3:41:11.220 --> 3:41:13.220]  when your own government calls you a domestic terrorist
[3:41:13.220 --> 3:41:15.220]  because you say the things
[3:41:15.220 --> 3:41:17.220]  that I'm saying on today's show
[3:41:17.220 --> 3:41:19.220]  then we're becoming
[3:41:19.220 --> 3:41:21.220]  Nazi Germany
[3:41:21.220 --> 3:41:23.220]  and the Soviet Union
[3:41:23.220 --> 3:41:25.220]  all over again
[3:41:25.220 --> 3:41:27.220]  it's horrible, you're becoming East Germany
[3:41:27.220 --> 3:41:29.220]  you're becoming Cuba
[3:41:29.220 --> 3:41:31.220]  we're becoming Venezuela
[3:41:31.220 --> 3:41:33.220]  you can see it happening in front of you
[3:41:33.220 --> 3:41:35.220]  the only thing that saved us so far
[3:41:35.220 --> 3:41:37.220]  is conservative talk radio
[3:41:37.220 --> 3:41:39.220]  and conservative talk TV
[3:41:39.220 --> 3:41:41.220]  like the Alex Jones show
[3:41:41.220 --> 3:41:43.220]  and just a couple of shows out there
[3:41:43.220 --> 3:41:45.220]  Tucker Carlson and a few others
[3:41:45.220 --> 3:41:47.220]  and Wayne Allerut
[3:41:47.220 --> 3:41:49.220]  and if not for our voices
[3:41:49.220 --> 3:41:51.220]  you'd have nothing
[3:41:51.220 --> 3:41:53.220]  to go, so we got a minute
[3:41:53.220 --> 3:41:55.220]  so I just want to mention quickly
[3:41:55.220 --> 3:41:57.220]  Rhino Republicans on the topic of
[3:41:57.220 --> 3:41:59.220]  rhinos and Lindsey Graham
[3:41:59.220 --> 3:42:01.220]  in Nevada we had a Rhino Republican governor named Brian Sandoval
[3:42:01.220 --> 3:42:03.220]  and we won
[3:42:03.220 --> 3:42:05.220]  every race you could possibly win
[3:42:05.220 --> 3:42:07.220]  and he won in a landslide and we controlled the whole state
[3:42:07.220 --> 3:42:09.220]  and we should have kept it forever
[3:42:09.220 --> 3:42:11.220]  and it would be a red state forever in Nevada
[3:42:11.220 --> 3:42:13.220]  except he gave
[3:42:13.220 --> 3:42:15.220]  immediately the illegal aliens
[3:42:15.220 --> 3:42:17.220]  the right to drive
[3:42:17.220 --> 3:42:19.220]  so every illegal in the state went to DMV
[3:42:19.220 --> 3:42:21.220]  got a driver's license
[3:42:21.220 --> 3:42:23.220]  and while there they automatically
[3:42:23.220 --> 3:42:25.220]  got
[3:42:25.220 --> 3:42:27.220]  registered to vote
[3:42:27.220 --> 3:42:29.220]  and we never won another race
[3:42:29.220 --> 3:42:31.220]  ever in Nevada
[3:42:31.220 --> 3:42:33.220]  not one important race
[3:42:33.220 --> 3:42:35.220]  has a Republican ever won again
[3:42:35.220 --> 3:42:37.220]  after we had won every race in the state
[3:42:37.220 --> 3:42:39.220]  in a landslide 10 years ago
[3:42:39.220 --> 3:42:41.220]  we've had 10 years of losing
[3:42:41.220 --> 3:42:43.220]  and losing and losing since a rhino Republican
[3:42:43.220 --> 3:42:45.220]  ruined everything
[3:42:45.220 --> 3:42:47.220]  Brian Sandoval, thanks Brian
[3:42:47.220 --> 3:42:49.220]  for all that, thank you
[3:42:49.220 --> 3:42:51.220]  and thank you to
[3:42:51.220 --> 3:42:53.220]  all the enemies
[3:42:53.220 --> 3:42:55.220]  nice host, Alex Joseph
[3:42:55.220 --> 3:42:57.220]  we'll be right back
[3:42:57.220 --> 3:42:59.220]  it's hard to believe
[3:42:59.220 --> 3:43:01.220]  that we're already into March
[3:43:01.220 --> 3:43:03.220]  2022
[3:43:03.220 --> 3:43:05.220]  and in the month of February
[3:43:05.220 --> 3:43:07.220]  we had a very popular sale that was going
[3:43:07.220 --> 3:43:09.220]  of our flagship product
[3:43:09.220 --> 3:43:11.220]  X3
[3:43:11.220 --> 3:43:13.220]  that has all 3 types of the amazing iodine
[3:43:13.220 --> 3:43:15.220]  your body needs for every
[3:43:15.220 --> 3:43:19.860]  your immune system your stamina your libido so much and the majority of the
[3:43:19.860 --> 3:43:23.980]  population the world is iodine deficient this is the very best iodine
[3:43:23.980 --> 3:43:28.460]  out there so we have on cell 50% off but we sold more than half of what we have
[3:43:28.460 --> 3:43:33.260]  or is it gonna come in for a long time so I took it back to full process I was
[3:43:33.260 --> 3:43:37.420]  thinking you know what we need the funds in now to stay on air plus this is
[3:43:37.420 --> 3:43:41.420]  the right product everybody needs so to incentivize folks out there that have
[3:43:41.420 --> 3:43:44.500]  been on the fence to get x3 and experience it yourself and support the
[3:43:44.500 --> 3:43:49.780]  broadcast I'm gonna keep it at 50% off until it sells out get x3 right now
[3:43:49.780 --> 3:43:56.980]  exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off I am a worldly person meaning I
[3:43:56.980 --> 3:44:01.380]  like going to ball games I like going to concerts I like going to play golf I
[3:44:01.380 --> 3:44:06.020]  like going out to dinner I like the metropolitan life I like everything that
[3:44:06.020 --> 3:44:10.900]  comes with this but see I have the survival instinct that is to get the
[3:44:10.900 --> 3:44:15.380]  hell out of Democrat run cities get the hell out of major metropolitan areas
[3:44:15.380 --> 3:44:20.180]  because unless we change course soon it's all crashing down is it time to just
[3:44:20.180 --> 3:44:23.140]  move out to the woods just trying to go get a piece of property in the woods
[3:44:23.140 --> 3:44:26.620]  just get off grid just get the emergency food supplies just live off the land
[3:44:26.620 --> 3:44:30.220]  that's the survival instinct but see the worldly part of me that's still
[3:44:30.220 --> 3:44:34.180]  probably the majority part of me says no no no no stay in the city the
[3:44:34.180 --> 3:44:37.500]  survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere there ever notion that you
[3:44:37.500 --> 3:44:41.660]  need to get a vaccine or a mask that's the that's the internal struggle that my
[3:44:41.660 --> 3:44:46.420]  guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well but you can at least
[3:44:46.420 --> 3:44:50.740]  have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so we have
[3:44:50.740 --> 3:44:54.020]  the best ones at infowarstore.com
[3:44:54.660 --> 3:45:00.260]  two of our best selling products are back in stock infowarstore.com and they will
[3:45:00.260 --> 3:45:03.580]  sell out in the next three four months before I get more of the product in if I
[3:45:03.580 --> 3:45:07.940]  sell it at full price but I want those of you that have been on the fence about
[3:45:07.940 --> 3:45:13.460]  getting one or son or getting X3 to try the products and see how amazing they
[3:45:13.460 --> 3:45:18.020]  are and I believe you will then get hooked on them by myself my family and
[3:45:18.020 --> 3:45:22.620]  the crew are so again both these products are back in stock both X3 and
[3:45:22.620 --> 3:45:27.980]  one or son they are 50% off for a limited time because they're going to sell
[3:45:27.980 --> 3:45:33.380]  out at this price I would estimate in less than a month so this is your chance
[3:45:33.380 --> 3:45:37.060]  to get X3 and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens this is
[3:45:37.060 --> 3:45:40.500]  your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your
[3:45:40.500 --> 3:45:44.020]  immune system as well they're amazing and they're an infowarstore.com
[3:45:44.020 --> 3:45:49.220]  the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation I need funds to run the
[3:45:49.220 --> 3:45:52.980]  operation you need to be healthy we need to stay on air it's a match made in
[3:45:52.980 --> 3:45:59.180]  heaven the globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID
[3:45:59.180 --> 3:46:06.020]  biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use
[3:46:06.020 --> 3:46:10.220]  that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[3:46:10.220 --> 3:46:15.620]  anybody that speaks out against their lives because of so many scientists and
[3:46:15.620 --> 3:46:20.740]  engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers now
[3:46:20.740 --> 3:46:25.740]  their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is
[3:46:25.740 --> 3:46:31.060]  a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now
[3:46:31.060 --> 3:46:34.860]  more than ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going
[3:46:34.860 --> 3:46:40.460]  to give up on their takeover like Canada they've now declared a civil emergency
[3:46:40.460 --> 3:46:44.860]  and martial law in Ontario and other areas the world are following suit like
[3:46:44.860 --> 3:46:49.620]  Australia so pray for these folks big time it's a very serious situation and
[3:46:49.620 --> 3:46:56.180]  stay tuned in infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount leading a
[3:46:56.180 --> 3:47:03.540]  frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[3:47:13.540 --> 3:47:17.580]  all right welcome back wait I'll root last segment man does this hour go fast
[3:47:17.580 --> 3:47:22.700]  I am the guest host on Tuesdays although I will not be with you next Tuesday look
[3:47:22.700 --> 3:47:27.060]  at that I'm already missing a Tuesday on the guest host every Tuesday at 12
[3:47:27.060 --> 3:47:32.260]  noon West Coast time that would be three o'clock East Coast time for the hour of
[3:47:32.260 --> 3:47:37.060]  the Alex Jones show but next Tuesday and for the next week in general I will
[3:47:37.060 --> 3:47:41.260]  be in Mar-a-Lago Donald Trump's beautiful home and estate and country club in
[3:47:41.260 --> 3:47:45.900]  Palm Beach Florida enjoying my honeymoon and as a personal invite to go down
[3:47:45.900 --> 3:47:48.660]  there and I'm very proud of it and I'll spend the week in one of the most
[3:47:48.660 --> 3:47:52.660]  beautiful places in the entire world it's a fantasy land called Mar-a-Lago
[3:47:52.660 --> 3:47:56.540]  probably worth a quarter of a billion dollars one home worth a quarter of a
[3:47:56.540 --> 3:48:00.060]  billion dollars maybe even a half billion now I for all I know a half billion
[3:48:00.060 --> 3:48:03.740]  now that real estate is flying all over the country but especially in Florida
[3:48:03.740 --> 3:48:06.740]  and especially in Palm Beach it's probably worth a half billion dollars
[3:48:06.740 --> 3:48:10.780]  it's an amazing fantasy land and that's what always made me laugh by the way I
[3:48:10.780 --> 3:48:14.980]  know I'm kind of jumping off to a new topic but you know during the whole four
[3:48:14.980 --> 3:48:19.180]  years of Trump as president when Libra and the two years he ran for president
[3:48:19.180 --> 3:48:23.500]  six years I remember laughing every time liberal said what a failure Donald Trump
[3:48:23.500 --> 3:48:28.500]  was he's a failure he's a loser look at all the firms that have failed all the
[3:48:28.500 --> 3:48:32.220]  casinos that failed with his name on it and I sat there and I just laughed
[3:48:32.220 --> 3:48:36.020]  because I wrote the book Trump rules about his rules that changed my life and
[3:48:36.020 --> 3:48:40.340]  made me into a self-made millionaire by the age of 27 and one of the youngest
[3:48:40.340 --> 3:48:45.700]  TV anchorman in America and host of five shows on CNBC and and eventually a
[3:48:45.700 --> 3:48:49.460]  national radio host and a best-selling author and a producer of reality TV
[3:48:49.460 --> 3:48:53.100]  shows and this is my life I have a life very much like Trump oh and a
[3:48:53.100 --> 3:48:56.940]  presidential candidate in 2008 and I won the libertarian vice presidential
[3:48:56.940 --> 3:49:00.940]  nomination and served on the presidential ticket for the 2008 election you
[3:49:00.940 --> 3:49:04.340]  may not have known it but my name was on your ballot I don't know if you voted for
[3:49:04.340 --> 3:49:08.100]  me as a libertarian but my name was on the ballot the year McCain ran against
[3:49:08.100 --> 3:49:16.260]  Obama in 2008 so I was laughed because I was trained by Trump and I meant Trump
[3:49:16.260 --> 3:49:19.540]  was my mentor and I really followed everything he did and and Trump's
[3:49:19.540 --> 3:49:24.060]  biggest rule or biggest takeaway from Trump's life is failure is part of
[3:49:24.060 --> 3:49:28.860]  success if you fight hard and you're always in the battle and you never give
[3:49:28.860 --> 3:49:31.980]  up and you don't want a safe paycheck working for someone else you want to
[3:49:31.980 --> 3:49:36.620]  work for yourself you're gonna fail sometimes and when you fail you got to
[3:49:36.620 --> 3:49:40.140]  pick yourself back up and get back in the ballgame get back on the horse get
[3:49:40.140 --> 3:49:44.180]  back on the saddle and I've done that so many times I kind of figure in my mind
[3:49:44.180 --> 3:49:49.100]  that in my lifetime I've probably started a hundred businesses failed at 70
[3:49:49.100 --> 3:49:53.980]  succeeded at 30 and that made me a self-made millionaire at the age of 27 a
[3:49:53.980 --> 3:49:59.500]  long time ago so life is you know you got to fail to succeed so Donald Trump
[3:49:59.500 --> 3:50:04.340]  failed with Trump you know liquor I think it was Trump wine and then Trump
[3:50:04.340 --> 3:50:08.380]  failed with Trump Airlines and Trump had a couple of casinos that fail and I
[3:50:08.380 --> 3:50:15.940]  listed in my book Trump rules some of the failures of Donald Trump and guess
[3:50:15.940 --> 3:50:21.140]  what Trump failed something like 38 times in his career he had 38 businesses
[3:50:21.140 --> 3:50:25.740]  that flopped but he also had like 50 that succeeded that made him worth
[3:50:25.740 --> 3:50:31.620]  somewhere around six to eight billion dollars you call that a failure and it's
[3:50:31.620 --> 3:50:36.380]  the classic joke that I use to open up all of my or used to use to open up all
[3:50:36.380 --> 3:50:40.380]  of my success seminars pre-covid I used to fly all over the world to give Tony
[3:50:40.380 --> 3:50:45.860]  Robbins like success seminars and I used to open every seminar by saying what do
[3:50:45.860 --> 3:50:49.940]  you call a guy who owns 10 restaurants and nine of them fail and go out of
[3:50:49.940 --> 3:50:55.540]  business millionaire you only need one and the crowd would laugh and they got
[3:50:55.540 --> 3:51:00.020]  it right away they loved it you only need one to succeed one great restaurant
[3:51:00.020 --> 3:51:03.220]  you're a millionaire in the great United States of America that's what makes it
[3:51:03.220 --> 3:51:06.580]  great to make makes American exceptionalism in the American dream and
[3:51:06.580 --> 3:51:11.140]  capitalism you don't have to succeed with everything you do but the end result
[3:51:11.140 --> 3:51:15.300]  is Trump is a winner and he's got a house where 250 to 500 million dollars
[3:51:15.300 --> 3:51:19.380]  and he's got you know a net worth of billions and billions dollars I don't
[3:51:19.380 --> 3:51:22.820]  think the failures matter anymore now do you I just surely don't think so and
[3:51:22.820 --> 3:51:26.260]  look what he did for our country hope you were here for the opening segment where
[3:51:26.260 --> 3:51:29.620]  I read you my column coming out this weekend and newspapers around the
[3:51:29.620 --> 3:51:34.180]  country about what America was like under Trump versus what America is like
[3:51:34.180 --> 3:51:38.180]  now God don't you want Donald Trump back all right my book is called the great
[3:51:38.180 --> 3:51:42.300]  patriot protest and boycott book I hope you'll buy a copy you can go to my
[3:51:42.300 --> 3:51:46.260]  website root for america.com and check out more about the book but you can get
[3:51:46.260 --> 3:51:51.460]  it at Amazon and Barnes and noble.com and in it you'll find all the top
[3:51:51.460 --> 3:51:55.260]  companies and CEOs and their phone numbers and their emails and their
[3:51:55.260 --> 3:51:58.580]  websites and their social media sites and how you contact them in a
[3:51:58.580 --> 3:52:03.060]  multitude of ways to let them know these are the bad guys that fund democrat
[3:52:03.060 --> 3:52:07.940]  candidates and who who treat republicans like garbage even though we buy most of
[3:52:07.940 --> 3:52:11.700]  their products the great patriot protest the boycott book and it teaches you how
[3:52:11.700 --> 3:52:16.340]  to use civil disobedience and strikes and boycotts to fight back all right so
[3:52:16.340 --> 3:52:21.900]  today just as I was saying in my commentary start to show inflation rises
[3:52:21.900 --> 3:52:27.500]  to 10% in the producer index the highest ever on record in the history of the
[3:52:27.500 --> 3:52:32.820]  Bureau of Labor Statistics so that's 10 percent inflation but the problem with
[3:52:32.820 --> 3:52:36.860]  inflation is they leave out of the inflation index all the things that
[3:52:36.860 --> 3:52:45.300]  people really need cars homes groceries gas and I believe all forms of energy
[3:52:45.300 --> 3:52:48.900]  like home heating oil when you add in the things that people need that they
[3:52:48.900 --> 3:52:53.260]  leave out if you counted it the same way you did 1980 inflation would be
[3:52:53.260 --> 3:52:59.500]  somewhere between 16 and 20% today it would not be 7% 8% 9% or 10% so we
[3:52:59.500 --> 3:53:04.780]  have a disaster brewing in this country I also mentioned how bad the border was
[3:53:04.780 --> 3:53:10.980]  in my in my new column and here's the story migrants encounters at southern
[3:53:10.980 --> 3:53:21.660]  border in February surged 63% over last year 164,973 encounters in February so
[3:53:21.660 --> 3:53:30.580]  let's round it out to 165,000 up 63% from last year now folks I want to point
[3:53:30.580 --> 3:53:37.100]  out something about last year last year was February of 2021 so Biden was
[3:53:37.100 --> 3:53:42.940]  president it's like it's up 63% under Trump it's up 63% over last year under
[3:53:42.940 --> 3:53:48.620]  Biden and Biden was already at that point letting in more people than we'd
[3:53:48.620 --> 3:53:53.300]  ever seen since the Obama days and maybe the most people ever coming across the
[3:53:53.300 --> 3:53:57.020]  border in history because it's now official that we let everybody in and
[3:53:57.020 --> 3:54:03.100]  Biden announced it's the world so it's a full-fledged disaster at the border up
[3:54:03.100 --> 3:54:10.780]  63% over last year and last year was already very very very bad so now I've
[3:54:10.780 --> 3:54:16.140]  backed up two of the things I said in my column inflation is raging and and open
[3:54:16.140 --> 3:54:22.180]  borders are raging let me mention another thing from my column the DHS the
[3:54:22.180 --> 3:54:27.420]  Department of Homeland Security is scanning employees social media for
[3:54:27.420 --> 3:54:34.100]  conspiracy theories and extremism again speaking of Nazi Germany speaking of
[3:54:34.100 --> 3:54:41.780]  the Soviets examples of extremism cited by the DHS are a belief that fraud
[3:54:41.780 --> 3:54:47.660]  occurred in the 2020 election and objections to current coronavirus
[3:54:47.660 --> 3:54:53.940]  policies oh my god you gotta be kidding me that's extremism I told you it's
[3:54:53.940 --> 3:54:58.700]  Nazi Germany it's Soviet Union it's East Germany and by the way aren't these
[3:54:58.700 --> 3:55:03.460]  facts okay you can argue about the stolen election I just told you why it's
[3:55:03.460 --> 3:55:07.180]  very clear to me the election was stolen and I just told you minutes ago that if
[3:55:07.180 --> 3:55:11.060]  you won't let us talk about a stolen election then we know the election was
[3:55:11.060 --> 3:55:17.580]  stolen we double no but separate from all that the coronavirus policies I'm
[3:55:17.580 --> 3:55:21.940]  against the coronavirus policies haven't they been proven failures the
[3:55:21.940 --> 3:55:26.580]  vaccines didn't stop anyone forgetting COVID who's got it now Obama Obama is
[3:55:26.580 --> 3:55:32.980]  COVID sorry for laughing about that but you know Obama has COVID and they've
[3:55:32.980 --> 3:55:37.220]  all got COVID everybody who got vaccinated as COVID Israel has the most
[3:55:37.220 --> 3:55:40.060]  vaccines in the world they have the most COVID in the world the most
[3:55:40.060 --> 3:55:43.020]  hospitalizations for COVID in the world the most deaths from COVID in the world
[3:55:43.020 --> 3:55:47.620]  and I imagine if they ever allowed you to know it to know about it Israel must
[3:55:47.620 --> 3:55:51.220]  have the most heart attacks and strokes after getting vaccinated so people are
[3:55:51.220 --> 3:55:54.940]  dying of COVID they're dying in record numbers of heart attacks and strokes but
[3:55:54.940 --> 3:55:58.340]  they're not and blood clots but they're not saying it's COVID related I
[3:55:58.340 --> 3:56:01.740]  guarantee you they've got the highest number of that as well mass don't work
[3:56:01.740 --> 3:56:07.580]  new study out this morning not one mask mandated city county or state in
[3:56:07.580 --> 3:56:12.380]  America stopped COVID with their mask mandates me while Florida never made
[3:56:12.380 --> 3:56:15.660]  you wear a mask never made you get vaccinated and everything's great in
[3:56:15.660 --> 3:56:19.820]  Florida I'm heading there tomorrow life is good in Florida so stop lying a
[3:56:19.820 --> 3:56:24.620]  couple of polls out I want you to know about only 37% approve of Joe Biden
[3:56:24.620 --> 3:56:32.620]  let's see who this poll is this is a civics poll 37% of voters approved of
[3:56:32.620 --> 3:56:39.300]  Biden 54% disapproved Joe Biden in major trouble we're headed for a huge
[3:56:39.300 --> 3:56:45.300]  Republican landslide this November assuming that a elections aren't rigged
[3:56:45.300 --> 3:56:51.300]  be social media isn't rigged and and that's be and see Democrats aren't gonna
[3:56:51.300 --> 3:56:55.620]  get us a World War three postpone the election and for that we've made some
[3:56:55.620 --> 3:56:59.940]  changes between now and then in battleground states like Georgia
[3:56:59.940 --> 3:57:05.340]  Pennsylvania Michigan Wisconsin Arizona Nevada some changes that tighten up the
[3:57:05.340 --> 3:57:10.340]  rules and impose voter ID and get rid of ballot harvesting if we make a few
[3:57:10.340 --> 3:57:14.220]  changes we win big in November the biggest ever I would guess maybe even
[3:57:14.220 --> 3:57:19.260]  like 80 seats maybe more than 80 seats but we've got to make those changes and
[3:57:19.260 --> 3:57:22.900]  we got to have an election I'll bet Democrats try to figure out a way to
[3:57:22.900 --> 3:57:28.100]  start World War three so we never have an election day wait on a route guest
