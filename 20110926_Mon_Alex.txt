[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.920 --> 00:19.440]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.440 --> 00:42.920]  Alex Jones
[00:42.920 --> 00:49.280]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are live it is Monday the 22nd day of
[00:49.280 --> 00:56.480]  September 2011 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours Ted Lumpkin the
[00:56.480 --> 00:59.780]  director of the great animated documentary about the history of the
[00:59.780 --> 01:05.080]  banking cartel will be joining us maker of American Dream will be in studio in
[01:05.080 --> 01:09.360]  the second hour we'll have open phones in the second and third hour today
[01:09.360 --> 01:14.960]  probably even in the first hour today I've got an article that just went up at
[01:14.960 --> 01:24.480]  info wars.com Ron Paul is half a step from first place and it breaks down a
[01:24.480 --> 01:31.360]  very simple but central fact that's hidden in plain view Rick Perry has begun
[01:31.360 --> 01:36.960]  a rapid descent in all the poll numbers every conservative talk show I tuned
[01:36.960 --> 01:42.920]  into this morning spot-checking was talking about the fall of Rick Perry
[01:42.920 --> 01:47.720]  now I said that yesterday and some people thought well that's a little bit
[01:47.720 --> 01:55.840]  premature well if we seize the moment and actually use this opening to further
[01:55.840 --> 02:01.400]  expose his agenda it's over for Rick Perry and it's the same thing for Mitt
[02:01.400 --> 02:06.560]  Romney here's raw story they've got a report Fox News panel Perry campaign
[02:06.560 --> 02:16.480]  near total collapse and that's Brit Hume on Fox News Sunday also we've got the
[02:16.480 --> 02:23.200]  Miami Herald of similar headline but headline Rick Perry in deep trouble
[02:23.200 --> 02:27.520]  Rick Perry is for completely open borders Rick Perry is for in-state
[02:27.520 --> 02:31.880]  tuition free legals when US citizens don't get it in Texas Rick Perry is for
[02:31.880 --> 02:35.840]  forced inoculations Rick Perry is for handing our roads over to foreign
[02:35.840 --> 02:40.480]  companies Rick Perry supported Hillary care that's even worse than Obamacare
[02:40.480 --> 02:50.400]  Rick Perry works for Al Gore this stuff is absolute political cyanide now in the
[02:50.400 --> 02:53.600]  short term this is helping Mitt Romney ladies and gentlemen Mitt Romney is
[02:53.600 --> 02:59.000]  exactly the same the exact same behavior why because he works for the exact same
[02:59.000 --> 03:06.240]  people so if you do the math Ron Paul in Rasmussen in Gallup polls and in others
[03:06.240 --> 03:11.560]  is number three or number two but in most polls number three that's where Ron
[03:11.560 --> 03:15.320]  Paul said in the last debate I'm in third place right now I'll pick a vice
[03:15.320 --> 03:19.120]  presidential running mate when I'm in first or second ladies and gentlemen as
[03:19.120 --> 03:28.600]  Rick Perry falls to the wayside and as Mitt Romney is destroyed we have the
[03:28.600 --> 03:34.280]  weapon we have the truth we can destroy him Ron Paul will be number one he's
[03:34.280 --> 03:41.040]  already number two in fundraising he's already number two in the Republican
[03:41.040 --> 03:45.400]  camp behind Mitt Romney Perry hadn't released numbers yet regardless number
[03:45.400 --> 03:49.080]  two number three we don't know they say number two number three doesn't matter
[03:49.080 --> 03:54.160]  he's number three in the polls he's number two in fundraising that is a major
[03:54.160 --> 04:02.680]  contender ladies and gentlemen and we have absolute total and complete ability
[04:02.680 --> 04:11.280]  to destroy Rick Perry and Mitt Romney so all I have to say to you is fire at

[04:30.280 --> 04:35.600]  analyzed the enemy system and not defeat a landslide

[04:40.800 --> 04:46.440]  speaking up you think America's awake today imagine if Ron Paul gives him a
[04:46.440 --> 04:51.480]  full run how many people that's gonna wake up we win either way the question is

[08:21.840 --> 08:28.680]  okay we're live ladies and gentlemen it is Monday the 26th day of September 2011
[08:28.680 --> 08:32.520]  we're gonna have open phones throughout the broadcast and we have Ted Lumpkin
[08:32.520 --> 08:38.200]  director and maker of the powerful film American Dream joining us in studio not
[08:38.200 --> 08:41.400]  even so much talk about American Dream but just to give us his political views
[08:41.400 --> 08:45.120]  and philosophy since I first interviewed him a few months ago I found that he's a
[08:45.120 --> 08:49.200]  very informative and interesting person so he'll be joining us also with his
[08:49.200 --> 08:54.160]  writing partner as well he's gonna be in here with us and working on some new
[08:54.160 --> 09:00.920]  exciting projects okay here are some of the news we've got today Fed program to
[09:00.920 --> 09:06.920]  monitor conversations is intimidation tactic that's from Paul Joseph Watson
[09:06.920 --> 09:12.600]  zero hedge first reported on this yesterday but if you go back to two and a
[09:12.600 --> 09:18.040]  half three years ago within the Fed protest we confirmed had us army at
[09:18.040 --> 09:24.320]  them in plain clothes including events Ron Paul was at and they told the
[09:24.320 --> 09:29.360]  military in plain clothes don't let Ron Paul people or Ron Paul know your army
[09:29.360 --> 09:33.960]  he may try to kill you so this is just the demonization of people that are
[09:33.960 --> 09:38.760]  actually Americans people that actually understand our system of government the
[09:38.760 --> 09:43.760]  traders have taken over the government so of course they're going to announce
[09:43.760 --> 09:47.720]  anybody that knows their traders anybody that knows their illegitimate
[09:47.720 --> 09:54.760]  hijackers of the of the system of course they're going to name us bad guys it'd
[09:54.760 --> 10:00.680]  be like of a hijacker could somehow fool a airline passenger list that he was
[10:00.680 --> 10:05.120]  really the captain and somebody got and said that's not the captain look you know
[10:05.120 --> 10:10.000]  his uniform doesn't even fit I saw him honk the captain on the head tell him to
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.160]  open the cockpit door up and show us they're like shut up shut up that guy's
[10:13.160 --> 10:20.800]  a terrorist oh well we haven't hijacked the plane it's ridiculous so Paul
[10:20.800 --> 10:26.840]  Watson has the full breakdown on that fed program to monitor conversations and
[10:26.840 --> 10:30.720]  this has been announced they have they've announced the Federal Reserve's
[10:30.720 --> 10:37.360]  put out purchase orders or requests for bids for a system to track all activity
[10:37.360 --> 10:41.800]  on the web and all comments about them and to basically counter them because
[10:41.800 --> 10:48.200]  see this is the government it's a legitimate but it is the government if
[10:48.200 --> 10:51.680]  you've been kidnapped and somebody's got you in a basement and they're holding
[10:51.680 --> 10:56.040]  you ransom they are the government they are the people that run your life while
[10:56.040 --> 11:00.320]  you're while you're chained down and you're not gonna get food and water or
[11:00.320 --> 11:07.520]  or you're not gonna live if they don't want you to so of course the government
[11:07.520 --> 11:12.480]  has the army who works for them of course the private hijackers of the
[11:12.480 --> 11:17.720]  government have the army outed in the Fed peaceful protest going back to 2008 so
[11:17.720 --> 11:21.920]  I guess three years that's covered in the Obama deception of course they're at
[11:21.920 --> 11:26.240]  Ron Paul events in Houston surveilling the congressman this is an outside group
[11:26.240 --> 11:30.440]  that's hijacked our military in our country and is training the police in
[11:30.440 --> 11:35.320]  manuals going back three years as well that anyone who wants to quote abolish
[11:35.320 --> 11:40.520]  or audit the Fed as a terrorist and they get cops in big stadium size halls and
[11:40.520 --> 11:44.680]  and sit there and tell them somebody didn't like the Federal Reserve they
[11:44.680 --> 11:50.200]  hate America and they want to kill you the cops actually sit there and believe
[11:50.200 --> 11:53.840]  it oh really these people don't like our precious Federal Reserve yeah the ones
[11:53.840 --> 11:57.000]  that have stolen tens of trillions of dollars the ones that are openly setting
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.040]  up world government the private Federal Reserve whose foreign arms have looted
[12:01.040 --> 12:07.280]  all these third world countries they've got the system working for them and it's
[12:07.280 --> 12:12.360]  an emergency situation to reach out to the police and military but look it's
[12:12.360 --> 12:16.680]  already too late for the establishment you could pull up the polls I don't know
[12:16.680 --> 12:20.960]  two three years ago was 70 plus percent now it's 80 plus percent want to
[12:20.960 --> 12:27.200]  abolish or audit or restructure the private Federal Reserve I'm here to
[12:27.200 --> 12:35.600]  tell you 16 and a half 17 years ago when I first got on air in 1995 96 maybe one
[12:35.600 --> 12:39.200]  out of a hundred people knew the Federal Reserve was private like Federal
[12:39.200 --> 12:45.520]  Express or Federal Credit Union or federal cleaners or federal ammunition I
[12:45.520 --> 12:51.880]  would get hundreds of phone calls half the phone calls on the the the local
[12:51.880 --> 12:55.840]  radio show and on the Axis TV show or more we're saying you're a nut you're a
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.040]  liar the Federal Reserve is not private and I heard its code word for racism to
[13:01.040 --> 13:05.360]  say it is that's what the media would try to use just like if you said I'm
[13:05.360 --> 13:08.600]  against getting rid of posse commentatus I don't want troops on the
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.720]  streets they had put out manuals the ADL and others saying posse commentatus as
[13:12.720 --> 13:19.640]  a code word for hating black people no it's Latin for the fact that you're
[13:19.640 --> 13:25.560]  going to have a local posse not a federal posse on your streets just like
[13:25.560 --> 13:28.560]  hey I don't want government-run healthcare it's a really scary idea it
[13:28.560 --> 13:31.520]  hadn't worked anywhere else gives total power to government or does Chris
[13:31.520 --> 13:38.240]  Matthews Carlos Watson what do they all say on MSNBC not being for
[13:38.240 --> 13:41.280]  healthcare is racism you're like what does it have to do like somebody brings
[13:41.280 --> 13:46.240]  you tuna fish sandwich you said rather not tuna can I have the patty melt they're
[13:46.240 --> 13:49.680]  like oh don't like fish that's racist you're like what does that have to do
[13:49.680 --> 13:56.200]  with with race I I want to make my own choice or you know I like a brown suit
[13:56.200 --> 14:00.000]  not a blue suit oh that's racism everybody knows if you like a brown suit
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.960]  you're you're racist against against cardinal birds and you're like what is
[14:04.960 --> 14:08.320]  that what does racism to do with birds just shut up racist we've heard enough
[14:08.320 --> 14:14.760]  from you it's supposed to be nonsensical like a cattle prod politically they know
[14:14.760 --> 14:19.000]  you're a bleeding heart self-loathing liberal who wants to prove that you
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.280]  are self-hating so they just say give your rights up or we say you're a
[14:22.280 --> 14:27.160]  racist people say okay well I'll do whatever you say then let us put carbon
[14:27.160 --> 14:31.440]  taxes on you and run your life or we'll say you're killing the earth what is
[14:31.440 --> 14:37.960]  Al Gore now said he said it's akin to racism and segregation to not support
[14:37.960 --> 14:43.680]  paying him money and he's told his people go out and get in their face and
[14:43.680 --> 14:46.680]  say they're racist and they even ask him in these different talk shows they go
[14:46.680 --> 14:51.320]  it were where he's you know on with his acolytes they say sir but what does race
[14:51.320 --> 14:58.440]  have to do and he goes just do it mmm they go yes sir and it works hey you're
[14:58.440 --> 15:02.760]  gonna pay me carbon taxes for any human activity but I don't want to shut up
[15:02.760 --> 15:07.640]  racist okay I'll pay you I'm sorry all right I'm now digressing the point is
[15:07.640 --> 15:11.320]  you would talk about the Federal Reserve 15 years ago even 10 years ago they'd
[15:11.320 --> 15:17.440]  say that's racism that's that we're talking about big banks why that me
[15:17.440 --> 15:24.080]  that's anti-semitic don't don't talk bad about the big banks no one no one
[15:24.080 --> 15:30.520]  better do that or you're anti-semitic but see now people have gone past that the
[15:30.520 --> 15:36.560]  the system labeling an anti-semitic which actually then tied it to
[15:36.560 --> 15:42.240]  Semitic issues and actually put that on the radar see how that works see how the
[15:42.240 --> 15:46.600]  establishment always wants it to be divide and conquer instead of hey we
[15:46.600 --> 15:52.320]  don't want a private banking system getting paid us taxpayer money for the
[15:52.320 --> 15:56.760]  right for the government to issue its own credit the government will issue its
[15:56.760 --> 16:01.680]  own currency and credit why because that's common sense and that's in the
[16:01.680 --> 16:06.640]  Constitution and it gets into a whole monetary debate but this is really a
[16:06.640 --> 16:14.400]  big deal Fed program to monitor conversations is intimidation tactic the
[16:14.400 --> 16:19.120]  bloggers figures exploded with interest over the Federal Reserve's move to
[16:19.120 --> 16:24.000]  follow in the footsteps of the Obama's campaign attack watch by monitoring
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  identifying its critics attack watch implies it's illegal to criticize
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.920]  Obama and they've run newscast in Missouri actually saying that but many
[16:31.920 --> 16:37.280]  seem to have missed the obvious intention of the announcement it's an
[16:37.280 --> 16:42.480]  intimidation tactic designed to chill dissent as zero hedge explains the
[16:42.480 --> 16:46.800]  Federal Reserve is requesting the creation of a social listing platform
[16:46.800 --> 16:51.320]  his function is to gather data from various social media outlets and new
[16:51.320 --> 16:55.560]  sources it will monitor billions this is a quote of conversations and generate
[16:55.560 --> 17:05.240]  text analytics based on predefined criteria the feds desired product should
[17:05.240 --> 17:12.280]  be able to determine quote the sentiment of a speaker or writer with respect to
[17:12.280 --> 17:17.240]  some topic or document solution must be able to gather data from the primary
[17:17.240 --> 17:21.600]  social media platforms Facebook Twitter blogs forums and YouTube it should
[17:21.600 --> 17:26.480]  also be able to aggregate data from various media outlets such as singing in
[17:26.480 --> 17:32.960]  Wall Street Journal factiva except most importantly the listening platform
[17:32.960 --> 17:37.640]  should be able this a quote to handle crisis situations continuously
[17:37.640 --> 17:42.920]  monitoring conversations identify and reach out to key bloggers and influencers
[17:42.920 --> 17:50.080]  now let me tell you what's really going on with this when you get 80 plus
[17:50.080 --> 17:53.360]  percent of the public realizing presidents or puppets bought and paid
[17:53.360 --> 18:01.000]  for and that the one guy who knows that the Federal Reserve is the enemy of the
[18:01.000 --> 18:04.880]  Republic and is willing to fight it who has a chance to be president whose real
[18:04.880 --> 18:09.400]  is being demonized and attacked when that starts happening you start getting
[18:09.400 --> 18:14.600]  Dylan rat again and all these others criticizing the Federal Reserve and even
[18:14.600 --> 18:18.440]  Fox News starts allowing Lynn Beck to do it for a time or Judge Napolitano to do
[18:18.440 --> 18:24.520]  it or Lou Dobbs to do it because that's wildly popular for decades didn't
[18:24.520 --> 18:30.600]  exist isn't fed you know isn't private it is federal you're crazy if you talk
[18:30.600 --> 18:37.080]  about it oh your kooks but remember three years ago whenever dick Morris got up
[18:37.080 --> 18:45.040]  with Sean Hannity and said well the people that thought that a world
[18:45.040 --> 18:48.560]  government was forming that would get rid of US sovereignty run by a banking
[18:48.560 --> 18:53.880]  cartel they had been crazy conspiracy theorist but now they're right and then
[18:53.880 --> 18:58.240]  that was the signal by one of their top political analysts that look we've lost
[18:58.240 --> 19:04.520]  this game of denying that it exists now we've got to act like we're going to
[19:04.520 --> 19:09.160]  fight it and Rick Perry three years ago went from supporting the Federal Reserve
[19:09.160 --> 19:14.320]  talking bad about it and you know basically did a 180 from the way he'd
[19:14.320 --> 19:19.000]  actually been suddenly he introduced legislation to in sanctuary cities but
[19:19.000 --> 19:24.240]  quietly killed it himself behind the scenes now it's come out he supported
[19:24.240 --> 19:29.120]  sanctuary cities and in-state tuition-free legal something other
[19:29.120 --> 19:35.080]  American citizens don't get now all of this is destroying him and so the Fed
[19:35.080 --> 19:41.520]  is analyzing media mainly mainstream with this but also internet to target
[19:41.520 --> 19:45.720]  people to attack people but more importantly it's getting so popular to
[19:45.720 --> 19:51.240]  bash the to bash the Fed that mainline people are starting to do it they need
[19:51.240 --> 19:55.800]  to keep tabs on that so they can put pressure through the executives see the

[24:38.640 --> 24:43.040]  Perry lied and said it was the law to take it and the Federal Reserve is
[24:43.040 --> 24:50.000]  incredibly unpopular the actual ruling elite are now being targeted we're not
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.920]  just debating their frontmen they want you to think the buck stops with the
[24:53.920 --> 24:58.200]  president they want you to think the power structure stops there because if
[24:58.200 --> 25:02.880]  you ever start looking at the oligarchs that run this country their system is
[25:02.880 --> 25:10.000]  over as the big nebrezinski said last year once the real governing class is
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.960]  identified and once it's shown that they're a pack of criminals waging war
[25:14.960 --> 25:20.240]  against the family against the free market and trying to set up a form of
[25:20.240 --> 25:27.680]  neocolonialistic collectivist grids with their fascist system on top of it
[25:27.680 --> 25:35.680]  it's over for them and so what is info wars.com reporting what is Fox News
[25:35.680 --> 25:39.360]  reporting what is the Miami Herald reporting what is the raw story
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.640]  reporting again I have a pretty good political understanding and that's why
[25:44.640 --> 25:48.640]  I've been saying we're going to see the fall of Rick Perry I told you we'd see
[25:48.640 --> 25:52.960]  the fall of Rick Perry before he even announced I told you that we would see
[25:53.600 --> 25:57.680]  Rick Perry propped up by the mainstream media I told you you would see Rick Perry
[26:02.080 --> 26:07.360]  basically being shoved out there and sold as the second coming of Ronald Reagan
[26:08.400 --> 26:13.680]  I told you he would break his pledge not to run I have told you exactly what was
[26:13.680 --> 26:17.840]  going to happen all along and I also said in the last few months that if we go
[26:17.840 --> 26:24.560]  after Perry on the open borders on the sanctuary cities on the in-state tuition
[26:24.560 --> 26:30.960]  on the Vicente Fox awards that Vicente Fox gave him now that videos resurfaced of
[26:30.960 --> 26:35.280]  myself and others confronting Perry and Fox shutting down their press conference
[26:35.280 --> 26:39.120]  that's now getting a lot of attention it's up at info wars.com and prison planet.com
[26:39.120 --> 26:47.600]  from 2003 that we could bring Rick Perry down and I was listening to talk radio this morning
[26:47.600 --> 26:53.840]  San Antonio, Austin and Dallas caller after caller going I didn't know he supported sanctuary
[26:53.840 --> 26:58.960]  cities I didn't know he worked for Al Gore I didn't know he supported Hillary care I didn't know he

[33:23.840 --> 33:29.280]  as the global is to plan holding the planet hostage so they get more power and then holding
[33:29.280 --> 33:34.160]  us a hostage again getting more power and then holding us hostage again and getting more power
[33:34.160 --> 33:40.480]  and launching more wars but the hypocrisy is starting to come out and the germans and the
[33:40.480 --> 33:45.760]  french and others the establishment candidates are losing more elections the problem is then
[33:45.760 --> 33:51.440]  the other party that comes into power is bought and paid for by the same interest but the public
[33:51.440 --> 33:59.040]  is becoming wise to the scam okay here's the big ultra simple point that needs to be gotten out there
[34:00.560 --> 34:06.640]  and it is enshrined in the article by curtain mo and alex jones at info wars dot com
[34:07.360 --> 34:17.280]  ron paul is half a step from first place and why did i uh go to that headline well i watched this
[34:17.280 --> 34:23.280]  fox news clip this morning i hadn't seen until this morning but they said it yesterday uh on
[34:23.280 --> 34:35.120]  fox news sunday fox news panel perry campaign near total collapse and if you go to the quote
[34:35.120 --> 34:42.480]  brit hume said that he is half a step away from total collapse now what does half a step
[34:42.480 --> 34:48.480]  step towards total total collapse for rick perry mean for ron paul we've seen rick perry
[34:48.480 --> 34:54.160]  surge number one when he said abolish the fellow reserve their treasonous their treacherous
[34:54.160 --> 34:59.840]  you know i want to battle the new world order suddenly that's not bad to talk like that as
[34:59.840 --> 35:05.200]  limbaugh has always said with his cook detector now it was good and limbaugh said it was good
[35:05.200 --> 35:13.680]  and and glenn beck said it was good and the republican establishment was like yay
[35:13.680 --> 35:19.040]  so rick perry tried to become ron paul surged to number one in every major poll
[35:20.240 --> 35:25.280]  and then for a month we that is those of us that know the truth put out his real record
[35:26.080 --> 35:33.200]  and when he got called on his record you were for sanctuary cities you were for in state tuition
[35:33.200 --> 35:43.680]  he said yeah you betcha and you don't have a heart of yarn really if you go down to mexico
[35:43.680 --> 35:51.200]  and ask for free tuition you'll just get arrested i mean they don't have illegals in their school
[35:51.200 --> 35:55.840]  system period mexico has the most draconian immigration laws in this hemisphere don't
[35:55.840 --> 36:02.080]  believe me just type in mexico admits most draconian or strongest immigration laws i mean you get
[36:02.080 --> 36:08.880]  hard labor in a prison six months to one year you get beaten if you're lucky
[36:11.360 --> 36:14.400]  there's only certain areas of mexico that foreigners can even buy land
[36:15.360 --> 36:21.920]  and a lot of that's taken by the government so what mexico doesn't have a heart oh i forgot the
[36:21.920 --> 36:26.240]  southwest is mexico and that's taught in mexico's schools i mean let's just be honest about this
[36:26.240 --> 36:32.880]  that we're a bankrupt country and in texas they take our tax money to pay for the in-state
[36:32.880 --> 36:40.000]  school system so when you get in state tuition it's about half what it is if you're from oklahoma
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.320]  or arkansas or mississippi or louisiana or not just bordering states any state
[36:46.560 --> 36:51.120]  if you're a hispanic black white if you're an american you try to come to texas to go to ut
[36:51.120 --> 36:55.440]  or any other state school you're going to pay roughly double or with the dallas morning news
[36:55.440 --> 37:04.480]  breaks down 91 000 more for a four-year degree oh what about having a heart for other people
[37:04.480 --> 37:12.400]  well see texans paid for that side issue though side issue george bush was for open borders
[37:12.400 --> 37:18.960]  naft and gat doesn't help mexico doesn't help us lowers all of our wages mexican wages go down
[37:18.960 --> 37:24.240]  us wages go down if mexico wouldn't have the us to dump 30 million people in they would have
[37:24.240 --> 37:31.920]  had a real revolution by the way i saw the new numbers this morning and i even heard local fox
[37:31.920 --> 37:38.400]  cover it but i didn't even know this they're now reporting 40 000 dead in the last four years
[37:39.200 --> 37:44.400]  let's have a tendency to quote old numbers you know 30 000 it's now 40 000 dead in drug war
[37:45.760 --> 37:52.480]  on the us mexico border 40 000 ladies and gentlemen vietnam in a decade was 58 000
[37:52.480 --> 37:57.280]  40 000 and they actually called it a war on the news
[37:59.600 --> 38:02.640]  and if you watch the video of myself seven eight years ago confronting
[38:04.640 --> 38:11.120]  ascente fox and rick perry there's perry they're getting an award from fox
[38:13.200 --> 38:18.880]  fox drives by with like 30 motorcycles or more and all these other police cars like like he was
[38:18.880 --> 38:22.800]  the president of the planet pulls up from the governor's mansion rolls down his window gives
[38:22.800 --> 38:28.880]  us a dirty look he had like green color to his face like a like a vampire in the in the nighttime
[38:28.880 --> 38:33.360]  light he's like six feet away he rolled the window down and gave me a look that actually made me
[38:33.360 --> 38:39.040]  shudder i mean i'll i'll admit it it was like i've never had a leader actually make me shudder
[38:39.040 --> 38:44.400]  he rolled the window down it was like he was like green like some vampire and smiled at us with just
[38:44.400 --> 38:49.920]  pure evil everybody was like who wasn't just me everybody's like we have to dig through that video
[38:51.680 --> 38:56.000]  the guy that runs our youtube channel actually found it in the prison planet dot tv archives
[38:56.720 --> 38:58.880]  it's prison planet dot tv's been around that long
[39:01.120 --> 39:06.080]  and i know if we find that that that original video somewhere around here if we blew it up
[39:06.080 --> 39:11.600]  because it was shot digitally i know you can barely see his face in the footage but it looks
[39:11.600 --> 39:16.320]  not too good on youtube it's up on prison planet dot tv like i said and then they pull around and
[39:16.320 --> 39:18.960]  went down there and i went and bullhorned them all they had their press conference
[39:19.520 --> 39:23.120]  and the cops came up we're gonna arrest me and i said go ahead but you know you've lost personal
[39:23.120 --> 39:30.000]  lawsuits a whole bunch of them right here in austin just a few years ago uh back in 2000 they had so
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.120]  that was a few years ago in 2003 and the cops backed off did their job didn't violate the first
[39:35.120 --> 39:40.000]  amendment so i was able to shut their press conference down and we have those newscasts where
[39:40.000 --> 39:46.480]  you can hear me talking over them from about 70 yards away from the street bullhorning up
[39:46.480 --> 39:49.200]  towards the press conference so they just shut the press conference down
[39:52.080 --> 39:56.480]  all right now i'm digressing you tuned in i said i was going to get to the key
[39:56.480 --> 40:02.960]  simple point because i have a problem i have trouble giving sound bites i have trouble
[40:03.600 --> 40:09.040]  just making things simple i i see detail i see complex connections i want to go through it all
[40:09.040 --> 40:16.160]  i literally just pretty much start i turn the microphone on and just start spilling out information
[40:18.160 --> 40:27.440]  here's the big newsflash ron paul is half a step from first place ron paul is half a step
[40:27.440 --> 40:37.120]  from first place why because if you expose rick perry's record he will be politically destroyed
[40:37.120 --> 40:45.120]  for the nightmare swimy globalist big government politician he is for the poser for the political
[40:45.120 --> 40:54.000]  chameleon he is and ron paul who's number three will become number two if you destroy mit romney
[40:54.000 --> 41:02.720]  who is exactly the same sanctuary cities in state tuition free legals wrote obama care on record
[41:02.720 --> 41:14.560]  he supports carbon taxes is praised by al gore and it goes on and on if you use his record against
[41:14.560 --> 41:20.800]  him it is like horn gasoline on the ground and throwing a match in it it's going to explode
[41:21.360 --> 41:29.120]  he will burn down both of these guys are so weak and so pathetic all we've got to do is crush them
[41:29.120 --> 41:35.600]  now this is a big test for the old dying dinosaur medium let me get to that in a moment
[41:37.840 --> 41:43.920]  ron paul is already the second biggest earner ron paul is winning most of straw polls and in
[41:43.920 --> 41:50.960]  scientific polls is number two or number three so we destroy rick perry we destroy mit romney
[41:50.960 --> 41:57.120]  with their records and it is ron paul now they're going to try to bring in chris christy and hope
[41:57.120 --> 42:01.840]  you don't look at his carbon tax record oh you didn't know that about him or his gun grabbing
[42:01.840 --> 42:06.400]  oh he did some austerity and shut down some government projects whoop they do what about
[42:06.400 --> 42:11.440]  corporate welfare what about supporting bailouts they hope that you don't find out about job of the
[42:11.440 --> 42:18.320]  hut they'll try to bring him in okay it'll take him a few months to figure out him huh and then
[42:18.320 --> 42:24.560]  if that doesn't work they'll throw in some more and say oh they're the new leader let's see cycles
[42:24.560 --> 42:31.280]  have sped up now it doesn't take five years to figure out a politician's a dirty two-faced liar
[42:32.240 --> 42:38.960]  people find out in months now we need to make it weeks and i'll tell you one reason rick perry has
[42:38.960 --> 42:45.840]  been exposed is the drudge report it's bigger than the new york times and facebook and and twitter
[42:45.840 --> 42:51.200]  combined they've had big actuaries out over and over again this year proving it number one news
[42:51.200 --> 42:58.320]  driver in the world and he has been linking to the tea party sites that have rick perry supporting
[42:58.320 --> 43:04.640]  carbon taxes and al gore and and uh government run health care and the rest of it and he's been
[43:04.640 --> 43:10.480]  linking to stuff about mitt romney not as much because people haven't been getting out as much on
[43:10.480 --> 43:18.800]  mitt romney but info wars dot com drudge report dot com these are big sites that are able to actually
[43:18.800 --> 43:26.160]  get something on the agenda past the mainstream corporate horror media and i will assure you this
[43:26.160 --> 43:30.800]  is this proves the drudge report is totally independent because if he was part of the republican
[43:30.800 --> 43:37.120]  party uh structure he would not be destroying rick perry he would not be getting ready to destroy
[43:37.120 --> 43:42.240]  mitt romney and people ought to be praying for matt drudge because i can tell you right now uh
[43:42.240 --> 43:47.120]  info wars dot com prison planet dot com together are huge but nothing compared to drudge report you
[43:47.120 --> 43:54.720]  had my youtube videos the radio show all of it we've probably got total person reach 70 of the
[43:54.720 --> 44:02.640]  audience of a matt drudge but matt drudge is just articles it's just agenda he can set the agenda
[44:02.640 --> 44:11.360]  that's something we're not we're 20 of drudge in that department okay and facebook's 20 30 i mean
[44:11.360 --> 44:15.680]  it's all fractured a bunch of people scurrying around even though overall it's much bigger
[44:15.680 --> 44:22.000]  overall than drudge drudge is like a death star particle beam of focused energy
[44:24.880 --> 44:28.720]  and that's the most important thing in this world is to be able to break through that
[44:28.720 --> 44:34.800]  electronic berlin wall and actually put something on the plate on the agenda on the menu that the
[44:34.800 --> 44:40.160]  establishment doesn't want there so i've said it a lot of different ways but i'm gonna say it to you
[44:40.160 --> 44:50.160]  this way ron paul is in third place no debate in many respects he's in first place in the real
[44:50.160 --> 44:57.200]  world let's just say he's in third as he said that's conservative if we destroy mitt romney
[44:57.200 --> 45:04.400]  and rick perry with their record and they deserve it and stop being naive and don't buy into the
[45:04.400 --> 45:09.520]  latest version of establishment kindle we've already had obama now we've got the two new kindles
[45:09.520 --> 45:14.800]  on the republican side it's over for them and they'll try every dirty trick against ron paul
[45:15.840 --> 45:20.720]  they'll throw everything at him so what so what if it's a rigged game we still take the field and
[45:20.720 --> 45:26.880]  show it's a rigged game i went and saw a great movie i know it won sundance film festival and
[45:26.880 --> 45:33.360]  some others but i i went and saw syna about the formula one race car driver because of all the
[45:33.360 --> 45:39.200]  sports out there race car driving is gladiatorial people die it's all about you know the equipment
[45:39.200 --> 45:48.960]  and the individual and there's the politics and i remember why i brought up that movie now
[45:50.240 --> 45:56.560]  i had an analogy about ron paul i wanted to bring up oh yeah even though formula one got caught
[45:56.560 --> 46:01.360]  rigging things and letting cars have computers when he couldn't because they got jealous of him
[46:01.360 --> 46:06.000]  beating all their champions and even though he ended up getting killed in the end they recognize
[46:06.000 --> 46:12.000]  him as the best formula one driver ever and he would go out even when they were cheating him
[46:12.000 --> 46:17.840]  and still still sometimes lose but sometimes beat them and that's what made him even the
[46:17.840 --> 46:24.320]  greater champion you don't just because something's rigged not get on the field you have to get on
[46:24.320 --> 46:30.160]  the field to show that it's rigged i don't know how else i'm supposed to explain this to people
[46:30.160 --> 46:36.400]  ladies and gentlemen i took my wife to see that it's an excellent movie just because it's it's
[46:36.400 --> 46:44.240]  it's about the whole system against one guy and rising to another level and still going out and
[46:44.240 --> 46:51.520]  doing it even though you know you're being cheated and sometimes losing and sometimes winning but
[46:51.520 --> 46:56.960]  every time winning because you didn't give up winners never quit and quitters never win
[46:56.960 --> 47:01.200]  and ron paul got a fraction of the support three and a half years ago he's getting now
[47:02.640 --> 47:06.880]  he is destroying the globalist the fellow reserve is running around like a chicken with its head
[47:06.880 --> 47:15.200]  cut off sending the army out to spy on ron paul events having the feds put out memos to police
[47:15.200 --> 47:19.760]  sing ron paul supporters are violent and dangerous you know they're getting ready to stage terror
[47:19.760 --> 47:23.600]  attacks and blaming on real americans you're like well oh my gosh they're going to stage
[47:23.600 --> 47:28.480]  government blaming on us and we're going to expose them we know their game plan so we're out ahead
[47:28.480 --> 47:33.920]  of it let them i'm sorry for those they're going to kill but you know they're going to do what they're
[47:33.920 --> 47:39.360]  going to do it's like kurt haskell the lawyer that saw the feds get the the underwear bomber on
[47:39.360 --> 47:42.880]  the plane for a month and a half the media said he was wrong and it came out he was telling the
[47:42.880 --> 47:47.760]  truth the government had to admit it i said to him are you worried about getting killed he said
[47:47.760 --> 47:52.960]  they could only kill me once i'm committed that's the end of it don't you get it we're only fighting
[47:52.960 --> 47:58.560]  other men here and and see they've got this arrogance where they should up there and say
[47:58.560 --> 48:04.400]  too bad ron paul can't win too bad it's rick perrier mit romney and time magazine and news week
[48:04.400 --> 48:09.200]  put them on the cover and say the race is between them and try to frame the debate and control your
[48:09.200 --> 48:15.280]  mind we're just going to ignore them and let them discredit themselves further i mean i've got
[48:15.280 --> 48:27.680]  articles here and i didn't just believe the campaign spot a breakdown of this i actually went
[48:29.360 --> 48:35.280]  and watched this and confirmed it for myself and got the same numbers mit romney in the last
[48:35.280 --> 48:42.160]  debate was given 12.9 minutes 12 minutes nine seconds perry 11 minutes 10 seconds by the way
[48:42.160 --> 48:46.320]  and all the other debates it's it's about the same it's all scripted there's a talking point
[48:46.320 --> 48:53.760]  no matter who puts it on fox google nbc new york you know it's all scripted romney perry huntsman
[48:53.760 --> 49:06.880]  centaurum kane bachman genrich ron paul johnson total talk time amount of questions same and you
[49:06.880 --> 49:15.520]  go through all of these numbers and it's roughly the same it's always ron paul at the end or i
[49:15.520 --> 49:19.360]  want to get johnson back on about this by the way i want to get gary johnson back on
[49:19.360 --> 49:25.920]  for new mexico governor so this is about showing how they've rigged it i mean ron paul won the last
[49:25.920 --> 49:34.080]  debate on fox he won it in their ip address only vote one system he had right at just below double
[49:34.080 --> 49:39.120]  other polls he's gotten more than double what mit romney got in fox news just pulled the poll
[49:39.840 --> 49:42.160]  just pulled the poll just pulled the poll
[49:44.800 --> 49:47.920]  i mean what does that say they think about you and then said mit romney won
[49:51.040 --> 49:52.720]  and you know why did herman kane win
[49:55.360 --> 49:59.680]  herman kane won because he spent two years in florida i heard him talk about it on neil
[49:59.680 --> 50:05.040]  boards the day of the debate they were here neil boards are locally at night he spent
[50:05.040 --> 50:10.480]  two years there ahead of time getting to know personally all the main people that would be
[50:10.480 --> 50:18.560]  voting in a straw poll and so he was seen as the native son the guy that spent the most time
[50:20.160 --> 50:24.880]  and it is a big state and you notice the perry didn't win and mit romney didn't win
[50:24.880 --> 50:30.720]  and that is a rebuking of what is seen as establishment candidates we come back i'm
[50:30.720 --> 50:35.440]  going to play this fox news clip fox news panel perry campaign their total collapse
[50:38.960 --> 50:48.640]  and mit romney is going to collapse just as soon as we continue to duplicate what we've done to
[50:48.640 --> 50:54.320]  perry to him they have the exact same record and it's even better perry is now desperately attacking
[50:55.680 --> 51:00.640]  romney with his government health care model but we can then turn that back around on perry
[51:00.640 --> 51:05.040]  we all know that berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water

[53:04.720 --> 53:09.360]  discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs it's called protogrow
[53:09.360 --> 53:13.280]  and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to
[53:13.280 --> 53:17.920]  grow like crazy under practically any soil and like conditions now here's the best part for our
[53:17.920 --> 53:22.880]  listeners who garden for self-reliance protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral
[53:22.880 --> 53:27.280]  uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum time
[53:27.280 --> 53:31.440]  protogrow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic
[53:31.440 --> 53:35.440]  code for nutritional uptake in plants protogrow's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and
[53:35.440 --> 53:39.440]  vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value and if you want to
[53:39.440 --> 53:43.760]  double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass you can if you want to grow nutritionalized
[53:43.760 --> 53:48.240]  superfoods with non-hybrids it's now easy gcn listeners who want to grow dirt sheep superfood
[53:48.240 --> 53:54.000]  should visit the protogrow website at grow like crazy.com that's www.growlikecrazy.com or call

[54:08.720 --> 54:16.160]  by the way there's so many different angles to how they steal these straw poles when the straw
[54:16.160 --> 54:24.720]  pole is open to the general public and has a low price Ron Paul wins I should add that the straw pole
[54:25.760 --> 54:32.880]  cost 125 excuse me 175 dollar bribe this is from a Lou Rockwell
[54:33.840 --> 54:37.600]  from a participant in the Florida straw pole I looked this up last night and confirmed it
[54:37.600 --> 54:43.120]  in order to vote in the thing you had to pay a bribe of 175 to the war party of Florida
[54:43.120 --> 54:49.280]  I did it but I feel like a sucker now because the money could have gone to Ron Paul campaign but
[54:49.280 --> 54:54.240]  instead will be spent to fight Ron Paul that's another thing the Republican party basically
[54:54.240 --> 54:59.360]  wants to use Herman Cain that's why he's been put in there former Federal Reserve operative big
[54:59.360 --> 55:05.040]  pro torture pro war globalist who by the way is going to give you a national sales tax on top of
[55:05.040 --> 55:09.440]  the income tax I heard Neil Boards Friday on the hot seat I thought she was saying we were
[55:09.440 --> 55:14.320]  going to have a sales tax and no more income tax well Herman Cain knows we need to phase one out
[55:14.320 --> 55:20.080]  with the other on top of it I told you I've known this for 15 years the globalist all over the
[55:20.080 --> 55:25.760]  world bring in sales taxes this way you'll end up with both but I know it's what you want and so
[55:25.760 --> 55:31.040]  you're going to get it you like to be hurt you will and so the Republican Party in Florida
[55:31.680 --> 55:38.000]  hates Ron Paul they got the 175 dollars the Republican insiders went and bought the tickets
[55:38.000 --> 55:45.360]  and they put Herman Cain in there now some of the people also were just Herman Cain supporters
[55:45.360 --> 55:50.160]  that went in there and voted for him and Herman Cain's a likable guy he's a good little corporate
[55:50.160 --> 55:55.280]  shyster he'll take good care of you and he also you know survive cancer so he likes to play on
[55:55.280 --> 55:59.680]  those heartstrings all day I want to go ahead and go to this video clip though because I told you
[55:59.680 --> 56:04.560]  Rick Perry was going to run and I told you he could be destroyed why else would he go to a
[56:04.560 --> 56:10.640]  national tv host and grab him and say I'm afraid of Ron Paul and Alex Jones because you know we
[56:10.640 --> 56:17.440]  know who you are we're from Texas buddy boy we have been sitting here watching you since you
[56:17.440 --> 56:24.400]  were land commissioner and what makes it worse Perry is that I talked to another former politician
[56:24.400 --> 56:29.680]  and businessman who was friends with you and who you played golf with and lifted weights with for
[56:29.680 --> 56:35.040]  many years who told me you used to actually be anti-new world order and know all about this stuff
[56:36.880 --> 56:42.480]  that makes you even worse you used your knowledge of this information to go join it
[56:43.920 --> 56:50.800]  that's sick just you are just as bad as former fellow reserve head Greenspan who wrote books
[56:50.800 --> 56:58.480]  against the new world order in the 60s and 70s may he co-authored one with Harry Brown
[56:58.480 --> 57:02.240]  talking about getting rid of the private fellow deserve all right let's go ahead and go to this
[57:02.240 --> 57:09.040]  quick clip this is from Fox Sunday Brett Hume talking about Rick Perry is one half step from
[57:09.040 --> 57:15.680]  total destruction here it is what americans are looking for in the slickest candidate
[57:16.240 --> 57:23.440]  they're looking for an authentic principled leader GOP presidential frontrunner Rick Perry making the
[57:23.440 --> 57:28.880]  argument his less than stellar debate performance this week shouldn't take away from his candidacy
[57:28.880 --> 57:34.720]  but the Florida straw poll Saturday showed it apparently did in a big upset businessman Herman
[57:34.720 --> 57:40.400]  Kane trounced the field with 37 percent the Texas governor was a distant second with 15
[57:40.400 --> 57:45.200]  percent while Mitt Romney who didn't campaign for the straw poll came in third and you can see the
[57:45.200 --> 57:51.040]  rest down the line as well Brit how do you read the straw poll was it a vote for Kane a vote for
[57:51.040 --> 57:55.440]  Perry or a statement please let somebody else get in this race well you can read it any of those
[57:55.440 --> 57:59.760]  three ways it seems to me they're all I mean Perry really did throw up all over himself in the
[57:59.760 --> 58:07.840]  debate at a time when he needed to raise his game and he now I mean he he he did worse it seems to
[58:07.840 --> 58:12.560]  me than he had done in previous debates Romney was strong as he has been lately he has clearly
[58:12.560 --> 58:17.760]  raised his game and in reaction to the emergence of Perry it's been good for Romney in a way that
[58:17.760 --> 58:23.280]  one might not have predicted Michelle Bachman seems she felt what she's dead last with some tiny
[58:23.280 --> 58:27.680]  friend look Herman Kane was there he tried harder than this he gave a stem-winder speech he's a
[58:27.680 --> 58:32.960]  marvelous stump speaker it seems to me he gets a moment out of this but I can't imagine that it's
[58:32.960 --> 58:38.080]  all right red hum turtle collapse watch the full video clip at info wars.com
[58:38.080 --> 58:47.280]  this is GCN the genesis communications radio network
[58:51.680 --> 58:57.280]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance
[58:57.280 --> 59:02.880]  to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda we're pulling the rug from underneath
[59:02.880 --> 59:09.440]  Americans at home a tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are calling
[59:09.440 --> 59:15.840]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention full of the
[59:15.840 --> 59:22.160]  republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[59:22.160 --> 59:27.760]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[59:27.760 --> 59:32.240]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today
[59:32.240 --> 59:39.040]  it seems like nobody does care right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic
[59:39.040 --> 59:45.840]  get your copy of fall of the republic on dvd at info wars.com we're watching online right now

[1:00:05.280 --> 1:00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:28.240]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:48.400]  all right we're going to go ahead and play this clip in its entirety this is from fox news sunday
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:54.400]  perry campaign their total collapse now what did i say yesterday the rise and fall of rick perry
[1:00:54.400 --> 1:01:03.680]  you see it's such a hoax that we would have this anti-free market pro globalist pro forced
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:10.640]  inoculation pro open border individual up there and when he starts actually defending his policies
[1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:14.720]  it's over but it's the same thing with that romney so if they're number one and number two and
[1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:22.320]  rompals number three this shows that voters will not buy into perry or romney we can destroy them
[1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:28.080]  if you simply decide ron paul can win and realize he's in third place and that we
[1:01:28.080 --> 1:01:33.280]  must politically destroy these people ron paul wins let's go ahead and go to the clip
[1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:41.280]  what americans are looking for in the slickest candidate they're looking for an authentic
[1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:47.600]  principled leader gop presidential frontrunner rick perry making the argument his less than
[1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:52.480]  stellar debate performance this week shouldn't take away from his candidacy but the florida
[1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:58.800]  straw poll saturday showed it apparently did in a big upset businessman herman kane trounced the field
[1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:05.040]  with 37 percent the texas governor was a distant second with 15 percent well mit romney who didn't
[1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:09.840]  campaign for the straw poll came in third and you can see the rest down the line as well brit
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:15.600]  how do you read the straw poll was it a vote for kane a vote for perry or a statement please
[1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:19.680]  let somebody else get in this race well you can read it any of those three ways it seems to me
[1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:24.400]  they're all i mean perry really did throw up all over himself in the debate at a time when he needed
[1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:31.600]  to raise his game and he now i mean he he he he he did worse it seems to me than he had done in
[1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:36.640]  previous debates romney was strong as he has been lately he has clearly raised his game in
[1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:41.280]  in reaction to the emergence of perry it's been good for romney in a way that one might not have
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:47.520]  predicted uh michelle bachman seems she felt what she did last with some tiny friend look herman kane
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:52.880]  was there he tried hard in this he gave a stem-winder speech he's a marvelous stump speaker um it
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:57.040]  seems to me he gets a moment out of this but i can't imagine that it's going to last very long
[1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:03.440]  and uh perry is about you know one half a step away from almost total collapse as a candidate
[1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:09.120]  at bay i think the delegates in florida this is a much more closed um straw poll than the one
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:14.960]  in aims um and these are discerning voters very loyal republicans they've been paying attention
[1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:21.200]  to this process all along i think it was a real slap um uh towards perry and mit romney and what
[1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:27.280]  you really got a sense when i spoke to republicans on friday um as many as i could after the debate
[1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:32.880]  the sense was not only that perry had given a dismal performance but and of course romney had won
[1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:37.280]  but that they don't like their choices at all that in the end they don't just because romney's
[1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:42.560]  been a good debater they're not enthusiastic about him and you still see according to people
[1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:48.000]  who watch these numbers about 50 percent of donors you know on the sidelines and people heavy hitters
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:54.240]  not ready to commit to either of them bill you wrote a special editorial for the weekly standard
[1:03:54.240 --> 1:04:00.160]  after the fox google debate and and let's put it up on the screen it was fairly striking yikes
[1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:05.840]  that was the one word headline and about rick perry you wrote this no front runner in a presidential
[1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:12.000]  field has ever we imagine had as weak a showing as rick perry it was close to a disqualifying
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:17.280]  two hours for him about the rest of the field you wrote this none of the now what's also what's
[1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:23.440]  happening is some of the neocons would rather have mit romney than rick perry so they're kind of
[1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:30.320]  seizing on this to knock him down but the moral of the story is we have cyanide politically for
[1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:37.040]  both these men and you need to go to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and get the articles that
[1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:44.400]  we've written the articles that we've put together on this the headline story that kurt nimo and i
[1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:51.120]  did like i'm looking for it i hear about how ron paul is one half step from first place

[1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:28.640]  all right ladies and gentlemen i have been hogging the broadcast myself the last hour
[1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:36.720]  perseverating on all of the attacks on ron paul and i've got the writer and the director from the
[1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:42.560]  film american dream that we sell in the online video bookstore american dream animated 30 minute
[1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:47.840]  program perfect to wake people up about the history of the banking cartel in a type of uh
[1:08:47.840 --> 1:08:53.840]  you know kind of south parkian but but better animation modern popular way and they've got
[1:08:53.840 --> 1:08:59.360]  some big ideas coming up in the future some very exciting projects but i don't have these two guys
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:03.520]  here today to so much talk about the american dream though later i guess we could queue up the trailer
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:07.680]  or something and play it's been out for a year it's excellent and it's had a big effect and
[1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:11.920]  watch millions of times for free online a real mark of the fact that these guys really care about
[1:09:11.920 --> 1:09:17.760]  the message of liberty and uh defeating the uh collectivist board but i wanted to have herald
[1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:24.000]  yule the writer and tad lumpkin the director uh in studio with us since they were already in town i
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:28.960]  had tad on the tv show in studio last friday night info works nightly news to break down their
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:32.960]  philosophy their view on the world but today i want to go over some of that with you later in
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:38.080]  the interview right now because i found you guys intelligent uh and articulate i wanted to just
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:42.320]  get into some of the current things the global financial crisis where the world's going what you
[1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:46.400]  think the population is going to do is more and more of what we talk about comes through
[1:09:46.400 --> 1:09:52.000]  unfortunately how far we've come that garter stills incredibly unpopular now and a major issue
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:58.080]  uh that the fellow reserve is almost 90 unpopular uh that that that ron paul's a major contender
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:03.680]  what do you guys overall think of ron paul and all of the weird dirty tricks we've seen in this
[1:10:03.680 --> 1:10:09.120]  this exercise in mind control that he can't win uh but then when we put the issues out of what rick
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:14.560]  perry and mitt romney really stand for they start to implode and so number one and number two go down
[1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:19.840]  worse number three and this is real simple like a like a nascar race car one and two start smoking
[1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:24.240]  well number three is probably going to win if they can finish the race what puts gas on the car
[1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:30.240]  our belief our support our donations this is a fight of wills a fight of understanding a fight
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:36.000]  of moral authority and we can't just let al gore and and and and and mayor bloomberg and the new
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:42.560]  world order sit up there and lecture us and tell us what reality is in some authoritative
[1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:48.800]  bent we have to break the hoax see it for what is and more and more i realize it's all just a
[1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:54.560]  giant hoax the system knows it's a hoax and it's time to wake up out of that trance out of that
[1:10:54.560 --> 1:10:59.360]  hoax as people begin to wake up out of the trance that i believe is now taking place uh well what's
[1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:04.480]  your view on ron paul the trance and where do you see this going because i see the control freak
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:10.160]  starting wars staging terror attacks you name it to stay in power i mean we are entering the most
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:16.320]  exciting time in human history uh let's get tad lumpkin and then uh herald yule's take on this
[1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:22.880]  yeah absolutely i mean we're both huge fans of ron paul and he uh his last run significantly
[1:11:22.880 --> 1:11:27.360]  impacted uh what kind of our personal calls to action and what we thought was going to be really
[1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:33.120]  important and an opportunity to go out and change the world and you've seen his popularity grow
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:39.200]  tremendously over the last four years from kind of this marginalized unknown texas you know uh
[1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:46.160]  congressman to now a huge national figure who has a huge movement amongst the youth in in america
[1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:51.520]  because they they see what he's saying is true and what's great about these about what ron paul's
[1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:55.840]  saying versus what all the rest of these guys in the establishment and all these pundits is
[1:11:55.840 --> 1:12:02.080]  is he's right and that's the reason why everything is going just the way he says it's gonna go is
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:08.160]  because all he's telling people is the truth these guys are trying to prop up some establishment lie
[1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:13.360]  because they're all so invested in it that they just want to keep doubling down and doubling down
[1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:18.000]  and doubling down you're seeing in europe right now they're like they're they're they will do anything
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:23.840]  to just keep it going just don't let me deal with reality and they sell people all this fear
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:29.120]  to keep the you know to keep the status quo in power and the status quo going we'll come and
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:33.520]  take granny's money we'll throw everybody out on the street all this stuff's going to happen
[1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:38.080]  just stick your head in the sand and you know act like an ostrich like you've been doing and it's
[1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:43.040]  like what we're trying to do is motivate people to say hey man the truth may be hard and freedom
[1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:47.840]  may be scary sometimes and adventurous but man if you do not embrace it something far far worse
[1:12:47.840 --> 1:12:52.320]  is going to happen and we all bind together and it's never what they tell you is going to happen
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:57.520]  is is so much worse it's like getting a shot it's like the anticipation of it's much worse than when
[1:12:57.520 --> 1:13:02.240]  you get it it's like okay that's a little that's stung let's deal with it get through it and get
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:06.560]  back to prosperity and freedom so that's what we're really I want you to continue along that line
[1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:10.640]  that it really is true the globalists have set up the federal reserve this whole cartel
[1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:17.520]  that you so you know beautifully document in your film american dream and it's designed to wreck
[1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:23.520]  the world it's designed to consolidate it's designed to collectivize so that no one can flourish or be
[1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:30.160]  individualistic but in the final equation getting what you want is actually sometimes the worst
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:37.280]  thing because it's destroying their own system it was one thing for them to just greedily in their
[1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:44.000]  minds set up this plan but now to see it actually come into fruition is setting in motion something
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.720]  that is going to end up destroying them and you see the system trying to prop this up and the
[1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:54.400]  and it's a black hole the more you feed it the worse it gets yeah speaking of black hole actually
[1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:58.000]  did I didn't see the part of the beginning of the show did you get the gallup poll that came out
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:02.640]  with the approval ratings and disapproval ratings did you see that all time low for government but
[1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:08.400]  what you see is from the 80s through the 2000 it's a parallel line of satisfaction dissatisfaction
[1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:14.880]  then it literally crosses and there's this big cross gap and that's where we're the message is
[1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:18.880]  now trying to keep that together and bring it back down and where people hold on one second guys
[1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:24.560]  it's on drudgen info wars pull the latest gallup poll i got at the stack the headlines like uh
[1:14:24.560 --> 1:14:28.240]  record dissatisfaction with government please continue really a fascinating just picture
[1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:34.000]  graph of you see this gap open up it spikes it obviously a 9 11 and then it goes like this
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:39.360]  and that void is what they're trying to fill and keep the information together and we have
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:43.520]  a great opportunity in shows like this and others and that's why you see ron paul having a massive
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:48.880]  effect this election cycle there it is yeah you see that big hole that's the information hole right
[1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:55.360]  there and they're pumping into that trying to keep that together and we're pumping our media into
[1:14:55.360 --> 1:15:01.440]  that you're pumping yours into that and we have a big um to war opportunity here to motivate and
[1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:06.000]  single action too that's why like even talking on the street people ask us a lot of times well
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:13.600]  you made a film what can we do talk about you know people don't know the power of promoting um
[1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:19.360]  you're buying the dvd giving it to people up uh promoting the websites on facebook twitter it
[1:15:19.360 --> 1:15:24.320]  spreads that way that's where the that's why the cia working for the big banks is always trying to
[1:15:24.320 --> 1:15:29.920]  use social media for their system yeah absolutely and you know going back to that point is is that
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:35.680]  we have a real opportunity right now because what's happening is is that the system tells you you will
[1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:42.000]  get a result x and when result x oh well we're going to spend a trillion dollars on stimulus and
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:46.720]  then result x is everybody's going back to work oh well wait that didn't happen oh well our fault
[1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:51.680]  we needed two times x oh no we need five times x and the thing is what's happening is is that
[1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:56.720]  the truth and the lie are pulling further and further apart and that's exactly what that poll
[1:15:56.720 --> 1:16:03.040]  is showing is that it's not working because unfortunately people respond to immediate pain
[1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:08.400]  and what's happening is is the immediate pain goes up the dissatisfaction they start to freak out
[1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:13.520]  and what they need to do is is quit looking for oh well did it get a little bit better today just
[1:16:13.520 --> 1:16:17.760]  give me the credit card so i can go charge it up a little more because i don't want to deal with my
[1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:21.840]  you know personal financial situation no no pain no gain we got to go through the pain
[1:16:21.840 --> 1:16:26.080]  to get our republic back yeah exactly don't get mad at the government because it's not
[1:16:26.080 --> 1:16:31.120]  making it better it can't make it better in a hurricane a tornado anything all it ever makes
[1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:36.320]  it is worse that's right and if people would just have the courage i mean look as much as we sit
[1:16:36.320 --> 1:16:42.640]  and we talk about all these leaders um you know who are leading us astray the people have to take
[1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:48.240]  the responsibility for for allowing it to occur because they've sat there and they've said oh wait
[1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:52.000]  i can have something for nothing oh i'll vote for something for nothing i'll vote for something
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:57.680]  for nothing i'll march for something for nothing and it's like guys that's just a dishonest and
[1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:04.320]  lazy philosophy and people need to wake up and alive in themselves sure willing to to go on that
[1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:08.880]  adventure to not only fight back but take control of their own life because if they're not willing
[1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:14.160]  to handle and take control of their own life then how do we expect politicians or other people who
[1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:19.200]  are really just don't don't care about anybody except expanding their own power and expanding
[1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:24.240]  their own financial gain to do it for us so it's like no one's going to care more than you care
[1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:29.360]  about yourself and that is the total misnomer of collectivism like some government bureaucrats
[1:17:29.360 --> 1:17:32.160]  going to care more about managing your health care for you then you're going to care about
[1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:35.920]  managing it for yourself well now that they're admitting that government health care is about
[1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:41.760]  death care and michael more is like well it's patriotic to to wait for that surgery and and
[1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:46.480]  so now it's the shared suffering and people ask well then why are the ultra rich for collectivism
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:51.840]  because they use it to steal the grassroots wealth transfer it offshore they're exempt that's why
[1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:57.120]  warren buffett helps write the laws 15 years ago to exempt himself from taxes now he's lecturing
[1:17:57.120 --> 1:18:02.640]  raise taxes on rich guys but if you look at the plan he's promoting it's on people making 125,000
[1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:08.320]  a year or quarter million collectively husband and wife that's not rich they want what's left
[1:18:08.320 --> 1:18:13.360]  for the middle class's money paid in a banker bailout it's so sick but i want to go back to this
[1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:17.600]  they know that we're waking up that we don't need them that's why tell the screens are going in at
[1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:23.680]  9,000 locations so don't trust your neighbor only trust big sis we know they're scared uh the system
[1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:27.760]  is now we're going to grope you at the football game we're going to take blood at checkpoints of
[1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:31.760]  the terrorists they're going to hit they're telling you we're going to manage your life we're going
[1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:36.880]  to treat you like children we're going to take your rights away because we've got to stay in power
[1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:41.360]  we've got to prop this system up so that's why we're in such danger for authoritarianism right
[1:18:41.360 --> 1:18:45.840]  now your take on that yeah that's true but that is again their message of control and
[1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:50.160]  that's not necessarily the reality and so when you put that information constantly out there with a
[1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:57.040]  talking point you can keep a status quo for so long and i think today what you've seen and then
[1:18:57.040 --> 1:19:00.960]  maybe even the last three years but especially in the last six months you just see a lot of people
[1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:07.200]  just the dissatisfaction is overwhelming and the message is working and will continue to work if
[1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:12.720]  it's not um tactically or strategically fought against from i would say our side or the other side
[1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:17.360]  well ultimately it's a confidence scheme but then people are losing confidence in the scheme
[1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:21.520]  and that's like the whole banking system it works on confidence i mean there's but here's the danger
[1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:26.240]  they're going to try in the implosion to bring in a new confidence scheme we've got to be there
[1:19:26.240 --> 1:19:32.080]  now saying no no no the same people that did this cannot be trusted to give you the new scheme
[1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:37.520]  that's absolutely right we are either going to get a lot less free or a lot more free in the next
[1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:41.440]  decade and that will be up to what people if people are going to stand up and do something and we
[1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:44.960]  mobilize the leave it there we got to go to break i want to come back and look at that because i agree
[1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:50.240]  with you totally you guys really have got it and then so we are at the crossroads right now
[1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:55.920]  normally society is frozen we're in a liquefied state the globalists are trying to shape the
[1:19:55.920 --> 1:20:00.160]  clay the way they want we got to get our hands in there and ignore their talking points and just

[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:25.120]  economy how dare you not deliver us free houses and cars and i see the headlines every day black
[1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:33.920]  journalist calls out obama it goes on and on and on uh where where where they're demanding that
[1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:38.880]  obama make everything better like he could wave a magic wand that's called slavery that's called
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:45.040]  begging to be a slave you need to make things good for me now once government's taking control
[1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:49.440]  sure then you complain and say hey you're making this worse and you know then you're having to
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:54.320]  tell the government hey stop this policy or start that policy but illustrating how we're at a cross
[1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:58.160]  roads look at all these hundreds and hundreds of arrests now down at wall street and i've seen the
[1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:04.000]  videos we've had guests on that have been there some of them are libertarians and saying wall
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  street socialists getting the bailout money get rid of it make them take a haircut get rid of the
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:12.240]  fellow reserve i'd say it's about half of them but the other half are just people angry at the
[1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:17.520]  bankers or their communist saying wall street makes too much money give it to us and so right
[1:25:17.520 --> 1:25:22.400]  there you see that fight but at least people now are recognizing the real power structure
[1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:26.800]  but there's a fight in there over what needs to be done but then you see the police arresting
[1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:32.800]  peaceful people another another illustration of just how far this country slid yeah absolutely well
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:38.960]  i mean the whole thing is is that the the greatest liar the things that are closest to the truth and
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:44.640]  so what often happens is is that people take and say oh well the banks got bailed out and that's
[1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:50.400]  what we're upset about and they have the almost the exact same the exact exact same argument all
[1:25:50.400 --> 1:25:55.440]  the way till the end which says well the banks have too much money let's let's take it from that
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:26:00.320]  the theft should have been we should have stolen the money as opposed to like you should steal it
[1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:05.520]  and give it to us rather than oh well the problem is we didn't have enough freedom and have we had
[1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:12.240]  actual capitalism instead of this cronyistic you know gangster mafia type organization that
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:16.320]  runs a financial system then it would have been fine banks would have made money people would
[1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:22.480]  have had honest savings and everything but it's all a mirage and a scheme and the thing that's
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:27.600]  really disheartening is just hearing this two paradigm that's like well i just you know i'm
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:32.400]  a member of one crime family so as long as we're stealing it for our members then it's just but
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:36.240]  when the other crime family comes in and steals it for their members then somehow it's unjust as
[1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:41.680]  opposed to why are we stealing why are we signing off on stealing well that's like all the republican
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:47.040]  leadership right through the talk show host all of the support of the bailout and they'll try to
[1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:52.720]  deny they did it now but then they can show them the video then they defend it i mean right there
[1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:57.600]  they want to criticize welfare queens all day those welfare queens are the ticking time bomb of the
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:03.200]  bankers that they can hold us hostage with because if you don't go along with the bigger government
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:07.360]  they'll just turn them loose if they don't get the welfare checks and the 50 million people on the
[1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:11.760]  electronic soup kitchen lines with the with the with the food stamp cards they will burn down the
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:17.760]  cities so so you've got the welfare people teamed up with the bankers well it's this tribal warfare
[1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:22.880]  really when you come down to it it's uh alice cowboys versus the stealers and if you are a
[1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:26.800]  stealer fan you hate the cowboys and if you're a cowboy fan you hate stealers advice first and so
[1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:31.680]  you keep on this this same line and that's fine when you're playing sports or something like that
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:38.400]  but we have identified that now in a in a political realm i would say for decades and that's been the
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:42.640]  that's been the traditional paradigm and you see it in a religious sense where you have
[1:27:42.640 --> 1:27:48.720]  a religious belief system that just stays and until you have a significant literally a paradigm
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:53.760]  shift or or what we've seen as a collapse you know but we see this i'm sorry no go ahead
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:58.000]  you see this i mean it's so parallels what happened in the roman empire and and a lot of
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:04.320]  it comes from you know a moral breakdown of why mar germany yeah every time there's a moral breakdown
[1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:09.680]  the collapse follows because even the elites stop caring about stability they just get delusional
[1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:13.760]  that's right and i mean you got all these people going literally we will take to the streets if you
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:18.800]  don't keep paying us off i mean what kind of society has tens of millions of people that that's
[1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:24.240]  their mantra you know we'll take to the streets if you quit giving us stuff that isn't ours
[1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:31.200]  i that that right there is probably the single most concerning thing because when it all goes down
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:36.880]  and it all will there will be a global financial reset at a minimum that's going to happen but
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:42.240]  the question is well when we're betting on freedom and we want a freer society we need these people
[1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:46.960]  not to be out there trying to steal from one another but actually like oh get on board and
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:51.120]  kind of crime has exploded yeah and that's why america's different this isn't going to go like
[1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:56.560]  europe we got guns and i'm reading all the time about the bad guys breaking in houses are getting
[1:28:56.560 --> 1:29:01.040]  shot and then that's the good news around here some whore do people come down my street wanting
[1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:05.360]  to rob me because they get their welfare check i'm gonna light them up yeah well i mean i think
[1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:10.560]  that's i think the idea that one can defend themselves is paramount to freedom and it's
[1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:14.640]  wide next to being able to you know the freedom of speech the founding fathers knew that it was
[1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:18.960]  that the second most important thing to being able to speak your mind was being able to protect
[1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:25.200]  yourself because otherwise i mean you're just at the mercy of okay okay you know uh big bad
[1:29:25.200 --> 1:29:29.680]  government come come protect me from the bad guys and tell me what's right well what happens is 51
[1:29:29.680 --> 1:29:34.640]  percent get in and they vote to rob the other 49 that's right and it's psychological too because
[1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:39.520]  when people are self-empowered they take care of themselves and when everything is handed over the
[1:29:39.520 --> 1:29:46.000]  state they just become sheep well let's talk about well let's take calls 800 25 at 9 9 to 31

[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:17.200]  throwing all this out riots bloomberg came out last week we're now two weeks ago and said there's
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:22.800]  going to be riots if you don't get more welfare money uh he needs you know more cops uh more
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:28.320]  more more taxes and everybody's fleeing new york so he's put together commissions to raise taxes
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:33.040]  in other states and he wants gun control in other states and the new york cops have announced they
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:40.640]  quote have air assets now uh i've got the quotes there that they have air assets that can take
[1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:45.760]  out a hijack jet so now maybe uh it'll be nationwide new york will take over the whole
[1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:50.960]  country but they won't tell the media what those air assets are funny the whole supposed pentagon
[1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:56.800]  system couldn't stop what went on on nine eleven but now new york now don't arm the pilots though
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:37:01.920]  just have cops with helicopters with missile launchers on them and turns out that is what the
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:07.760]  air assets are but don't let the pilots who who can you trust to fly the plane the giant weapon
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:12.640]  don't let them be armed instead have cops well what if you get a crazy cop with his missiles
[1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:17.920]  and we've had that happen before again it's this idea of we've got to have checkpoints everywhere
[1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:22.400]  because there could be a bomber at a shopping mall there there could be one at a school and and
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:26.400]  government must be everywhere to protect you clearly this whole thing is a smoke screen to
[1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:30.720]  gear up a police state grid for the american people what's your view on the coming riots
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:35.760]  well i think if you look at uh if you look at all the countries where
[1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:42.960]  where something has been promised and there's something less to pay with they all equal taking
[1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:49.840]  to the streets i mean greece their their tip of the spear as far as the western western european
[1:37:49.840 --> 1:37:55.760]  nations and the western world nations where we're seeing this go down first i i'm not sure why
[1:37:55.760 --> 1:38:00.960]  throughout history when over and over and over you've seen this exact same thing play out
[1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:06.800]  that anyone thinks it's going to be any different in any nation when you've got a huge amount of
[1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:13.760]  people who have who feel entitled and to other people's things and then there's no longer the
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:19.920]  ability to pay them anymore how that's not how that's not going to somehow end up in the streets
[1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:26.000]  and what the response of that is and what i think you know people are deathly afraid of is well
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:31.840]  what exactly how does that play out especially in a nation that's got you know unlike greece and
[1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:36.240]  unlike europe and unlike pretty much any other nation in the world there is still a very very
[1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:43.200]  strong uh threat of people who believe in independence and liberty and in this nation and individualism
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:49.440]  and that i would hope has that has a very different outcome than people who are really just trying to
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:54.560]  say well let's let's double down and reestablish the collective and you know they want they'll give
[1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:59.840]  up more rights as long as they keep just just feed me feed me feed me and you know here i think
[1:38:59.840 --> 1:39:05.120]  the the key for the united states is the last stand for liberty will will be in america because it's
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:10.480]  really the only place that's even got the mission statement and and a significant population that
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:15.600]  says you know individual liberty and the right to control your own life and and personal responsibility
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:20.000]  is is uh you know is the greatest sort of mission statement that's ever been created for a nation
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:25.200]  so that that that that is what makes us unique and how exactly that plays out i'm not sure but
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:30.400]  mr yule what's your take on that yeah you know people say the constitution is older or relevant
[1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:35.360]  in this type of thing and uh it's the exact opposite it's treason then it's the newest
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:40.160]  document in in human history that gives people this type of liberty and freedom and empire is
[1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:45.760]  what's old and the collective idea in this oligarchy or this uh photography that's old
[1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:52.320]  yeah gang rule is old it's as old as human history and so what we have here in america is uh
[1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:58.960]  some have called it a secret destiny so i'm just called it uh whatever but you've come here
[1:39:58.960 --> 1:40:04.640]  with a very new idea and i think it was george washington if the republic in last 20 years
[1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:11.680]  and we have a chance it was always always uh the idea that it always had to be protected
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:16.720]  and it wasn't something you could just let go without some vigilance and that's where we're at
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:21.520]  and you know we've seen that we have to protect this idea we have to protect liberty we have to
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:27.520]  fight for freedom and and our rights and individuals and created by god and well these globalist
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:31.760]  horrors they get up there with straight faces and act like it's weird that's right at the end of the
[1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:36.640]  constitution the middle of rights and to where a tricorn had and weird to say leave my property
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:41.120]  alone yeah look at where we've gone property taxes didn't have that 50 years ago a private
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:46.640]  income tax paid to a private bank didn't have that you know 97 years ago and and look what we've
[1:40:46.640 --> 1:40:52.400]  become since then and it's getting worse but the good news is is as you said people aren't buying
[1:40:52.400 --> 1:40:58.400]  it anymore and so the system is scared and they're going to pull out all the stops right now against
[1:40:58.400 --> 1:41:04.240]  us yeah that's absolutely right and and because that's the only thing they can do is just keep i
[1:41:04.240 --> 1:41:08.640]  mean you see them every week these politicians like ben Bernanke comes out with well now i'm
[1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:13.120]  going to make a bolder statement everything's fine and then it's like he thinks if he says it
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:19.280]  twice is loud and with sterner words that somehow people people aren't buying it anymore because
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:25.440]  it's meaningless it's just it's purely words and i think that the rubber is without question meeting
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:30.240]  the road i mean it's like the the imf now needs to bail out you know europe i mean they're talking
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:35.680]  about trillions and trillions of dollars where is all that where is that coming from what it is
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:41.760]  is a tax to the looters to the head mafia they're always calling it a bailout it's not a bailout
[1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:46.640]  because it's impossible to pay off the ponzi scheme it's always been impossible they never spend the
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:50.720]  money to prop up the ponzi scheme they just take it right then as bonuses but now they admit it's
[1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:54.880]  impossible on the news this morning it's impossible for greece to pay back but what it does so what do
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:42:00.320]  we do you know and it's well they say europe's got six weeks unless they transfer all power to a new
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:04.560]  private central bank it's always a threat of the deadline we see so many things get passed i mean
[1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:08.800]  that's how the federal reserve act got passed that these things get passed under this threat of time
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:12.800]  deadline we've got to have a federal reserve so there's never another crisis well you got boom
[1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:16.480]  you get the great depression right after you got countries over there talking about we're giving up
[1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:21.600]  our national sovereignty i mean it's like germany's now no longer going to be germany they're going
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:26.480]  to be subservient not in just oh we're we're all in this voluntary e you with this kind of loose
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:32.000]  constitution we can leave no we will hand the power of the state to now some super regional
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  government which is why when people talk about globalism to keep control and order which is what
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:43.280]  this is about you got to get everyone in line and to do that because people will run out of new york
[1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:47.600]  that's right and they can't have you run into texas well that's right and that's the reason why
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:51.600]  government in america part of the progressive agenda that we've seen happen over the last
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:57.040]  hundred years is that government has not only gotten bigger but it shifted and it shifted from
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:01.280]  localized government where you had a lot more saying you could have a lot more differences and
[1:43:01.280 --> 1:43:06.960]  you could leave austin and go to dallas to then state government where oh at least i can leave
[1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:11.840]  new york and i can come to texas to now it's a national government where now it's like well
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:17.440]  okay now i got to leave the united states of america i mean that's what it's getting harder
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:22.160]  and harder and harder to find differentiation because they frankly don't want 50 experiments
[1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:27.200]  they don't want a republic they want a no they don't want diversity no because these are not liberals
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:33.360]  thomas jefferson's a liberal these people are authoritarian borg wearing smiley face mask
[1:43:33.360 --> 1:43:39.280]  while they rob and loot our society yeah well they just they believe in control and they believe
[1:43:39.280 --> 1:43:44.480]  in order and that's how they believe i mean it's just it's a philosophical war that has
[1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:48.880]  literally been going on since the beginning of well yeah i mean you really study these globalists
[1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:53.840]  though they are so cold-blooded i mean they hate the family they openly say they do they hate
[1:43:53.840 --> 1:43:59.040]  everything good they love degradation i mean they get upset by people having a good time
[1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:05.120]  and being successful they don't like people being individuals they they they they want to
[1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:11.840]  sit above us all and basically make us all like 1984 uh you know wear these different little little
[1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:18.400]  jumpsuits and and all be arranged by them they want to play god well that gets that just gets
[1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:23.520]  into a whole other level of uh understanding really i mean you can work on a tactical level
[1:44:23.520 --> 1:44:27.280]  which we do a lot when we talk daily topics and things like that and you can move it maybe to
[1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:32.080]  a strategy but when you start getting into the actual war plan and the overall agenda of the
[1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:36.720]  annihilation of a of a human free will you know that gets into a different space but i believe
[1:44:36.720 --> 1:44:41.760]  all that to be there yeah and they they they i mean that's the reason why it's kind of like they
[1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:47.920]  don't when you mention the family is what i think what a lot of people see is is that basically most
[1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:54.400]  of most of the world is one big family where not family in traditional sense we're all in this family
[1:44:54.400 --> 1:44:59.440]  and then there's the patriarchs that tell people that are like the smartest no no no people talk
[1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:03.920]  about bill clinton being their daddy the government's your daddy right and then there's big brother who
[1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:09.520]  helps out and there's big sis and and that's our and we ask the mommy to give us things we ask the
[1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:14.480]  daddy to give us things you know that's it that's why they say i've got the text with people didn't
[1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:18.560]  believe it i wouldn't actually got them uh that they have a ut that they give the social workers
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:23.040]  and it's the family is an old archaic disease and we're going to eradicate it well and that's
[1:45:23.040 --> 1:45:28.880]  why they don't want i mean that's why school choice is so you know you've seen schooling
[1:45:28.880 --> 1:45:34.000]  centralized and centralized and centralized because they don't frankly want people teaching
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:39.200]  different things i mean the whole idea is is if they can keep telling huge amounts of the population
[1:45:39.200 --> 1:45:43.600]  no we're part of this we're part of this global family here's the new mob they don't want diversity
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:47.360]  but it's getting really good ideas but it's getting ridiculous i was watching some new
[1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:52.880]  carbon tax pushing thing for corporations and it goes everyone has adopted it it is settled and you
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:57.040]  will go to sustainability which means they'll shut down your business and and you know move it to
[1:45:57.040 --> 1:46:01.280]  china but it's all done with this you know like you know sweety cake way with this good-looking
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:06.480]  lady up there but but that's how they run this they just say it's settled if you listen to mpr if
[1:46:06.480 --> 1:46:12.640]  you watch the news they talk to you like you're a child yes and they say ron paul can't win we said
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:19.280]  yeah no that's that's exactly right and that's how they that's a bunch of condescending jerks yeah
[1:46:19.280 --> 1:46:25.200]  yeah i mean and that's part of it though is is that by making you not feel it's tough for
[1:46:25.200 --> 1:46:31.120]  unempowered people who don't feel empowered to do a lot so if they can if people can make you
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:36.160]  not feel confident about your decisions and make you feel like you don't know and in your ignorant
[1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:42.000]  you sort of they're trying to paralyze people but what's happening is is that the pain of the
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  of the lie coming down is starting to motivate people but more than that it's the humiliation
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:54.160]  of how the bureaucrats and the cops and the system was swaggering around it's more than that
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:46:59.920]  people don't like it yeah they don't like some secret police guy chatteling on them or bossing
[1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:03.760]  them around it's like good put me on a list fellow reserve announced today put everybody on list to
[1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:09.280]  criticize it put me at the top like john hand cocky creatures i mean good i'm not afraid anymore
[1:47:09.280 --> 1:47:14.240]  yeah that's right well and and these movements you know i i repeatedly tell people it's like a
[1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:20.240]  damn and i'm just like don't be discouraged because the water isn't gradually picking up
[1:47:20.240 --> 1:47:26.000]  picking up momentum it's like when it comes down it takes a few people to go way out in front and
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:31.760]  all alone and and and you know preach this stuff and be marginalized and marginalized and what can
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:36.560]  happen though is you start to get this exponential return and we're here starting that we're here
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:41.360]  and that's why there's yes but first behind the scenes and out publicly there's the new narrative
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:45.920]  the tea party ron paul supporters are going to blow up federal buildings uh are you guys ready for
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:50.560]  that because we need we need to go ahead and talk about that because they are going to stage events
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:54.560]  unless we talk about it and even if we talk about it they're probably going to stage events
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:48:00.480]  because you can see i can see as clear as day the advertising campaign getting us ready for
[1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:04.640]  to be framed for terror attacks well again i mean that's why you're seeing them marginalized they've
[1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:10.320]  done it as as racist they do it as you know oh well there's sexist oh well they want them they
[1:48:10.320 --> 1:48:15.600]  want to force everybody to learn what they learn believe in their same god they're going to control
[1:48:15.600 --> 1:48:23.840]  you they will do everything to try and marginalize and and bifurcate and cut off and try and find the
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:29.840]  winning the winning ideology that they think will separate the people who are preaching the message
[1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:35.920]  of freedom from the pack and they will keep well look how they say the tea party uh yeah first it's
[1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:40.480]  ron paul starts it the republicans try to co-opt it that's one slice then they say it's only white
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:44.960]  so other folks don't feel welcome right and it's always like well you're black or you're hispanic
[1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:49.520]  you can't be for the second amendment or property rights you can't be for family because these evil
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:54.880]  whiteies are for it right that's right well and that's right oh let's separate all the people who
[1:48:54.880 --> 1:49:00.480]  are uh that's what they'll do they'll you see it right now it's like obama's even going out there
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:07.120]  talking to people he says he says i'm going to run now on race openly and and and and he's saying
[1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:11.600]  exactly yeah and when you see so many of the leaders of this movement sitting there saying
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:16.400]  oh well the black community the black community black i mean i don't it's like aren't these the
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:20.880]  people who preach kumbaya now all of a sudden when it's convenient they'll just flip the script and
[1:49:20.880 --> 1:49:24.800]  they'll be like oh no well be afraid of big whitey see they're all over there in their meetings
[1:49:24.800 --> 1:49:29.360]  so now we got to go fight for ours and it's really this this uh you know this no no obama
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:33.840]  came out to the you know the big black group this weekend and said shut up quick complaining
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:37.040]  you know i'm going to protect you from whitey you're going to protect okay let's talk about
[1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:42.160]  whitey the big mega bankers the big criminals a lot of more white uh they're the ones that put you
[1:49:42.160 --> 1:49:46.480]  in power to play this whole race game well that's what i was saying earlier about the tribal thing
[1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:52.240]  once the two teams get together against a different enemy and once we identify that i think that we
[1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:56.880]  can have a lot of that's what scares the global that's exactly right the minute i have this epiphany
[1:49:56.880 --> 1:50:00.400]  and i and you know you have epiphanies every day but it was common sense but i was walking
[1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:05.760]  off my car this morning it just came to me i said it's liberty and i said i mean that's the message
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:10.640]  we've got to get out to everybody that everybody deserves liberty and that and that i want the
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:15.280]  whole world to be free and and and even though they've trained these groups to attack me and
[1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:19.200]  hate me because of how i looked i've got to just ignore that and move forward and talk to them like
[1:50:19.200 --> 1:50:24.560]  they're a human that's right because we've got to as a movement rise it's okay to be frustrated
[1:50:24.560 --> 1:50:29.920]  it's okay to be upset and we should be angry but it's like we've got to just stay on message and
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:34.800]  look at these people like they're caught in the matrix they're they're and and and say you know
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:39.200]  what liberty is the greatest thing and we are here to help you be free and we will not waver from
[1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:43.360]  that message regardless if if you want to cause racism or not we know in our heart we're not
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:47.760]  we're here to spread liberty and i think if we stay on that well they cannot be they can't stop us
[1:50:47.760 --> 1:50:50.640]  that's that's that's all right i want to hold you guys a little bit in the next hour i want to

[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:41.280]  me
[1:54:57.360 --> 1:55:15.440]  Okay, I'm back live panting. I'm on the other side of the building. I apologize to my guest
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:21.600]  this doesn't happen a lot. We had an idea for me to do something on the show tonight
[1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:28.880]  because this came out last Friday. I didn't cover it for me covering it tonight. So the guys thought
[1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:33.200]  kind of like when I made fun of folks, I think the world's gonna end from common Elena.
[1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:37.120]  We used to clip from Thunder of the Barbarian with the guy's head spins around. He's shooting the
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:42.800]  beams down. We didn't we're doing another one of those animations where I spontaneously kibbutzed.
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:47.360]  So we're going to air that tonight. It's pretty cheesy. I was trying to like kept trying to do it
[1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:50.720]  like where I catch on fire down here and then all of a sudden burst into flame. You guys see this
[1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:56.080]  a BBC article first Irish case of death by spontaneous combustion. The government has confirmed
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:56:04.320]  and their corners confirmed that that Michael Barrett 76 died at his home completely caught
[1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:09.280]  on fire and exploded. These have been confirmed in front of witnesses throughout history and
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:13.600]  people just catch on fire and just like in a movie. Yeah, I've heard of it before but
[1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:17.840]  randomly I didn't know another guy they had a confirmed case this week. What was that last
[1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:22.720]  week? Yeah, maybe the predator was there and like shot him. There's invisible Captain Spock
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:26.560]  with a phaser. Captain Spock now. Be careful because they're going to say that's what happened
[1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:31.440]  to building seven soon. Oh, by the way, they've come out now saying it's all discredited,
[1:56:31.440 --> 1:56:36.160]  some type of metal combined with this with the sprinkler systems and there were explosions
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:42.960]  in the towers now. But what about seven though? No, really wild. So now there were explosions.
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:48.320]  I did not hear that. It's unbelievable how the government proves itself to be incompetent and
[1:56:48.320 --> 1:56:54.480]  corrupt over and over and over again and it's proven so after the fact and yet people just oh,
[1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:58.480]  we'll believe them the next time. I mean, do they not look well, it's such a precedent that this is
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:02.560]  the group that lies to us. Yeah. And so people feel powerless. So they just give in. I'm going to
[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:06.880]  shut up now. I'm going to call. Sorry, folks. Ben in Kansas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:13.600]  Yeah, I just want to talk about the police day here starting up in Wichita and we have
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:20.640]  we got patrol rifles now. So, you know, all the police officers have their own AR 15 in the cars
[1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:25.360]  and of course the government paid for them with stimulus funds or whatever.
[1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:29.920]  Well, that's fine. As long as they don't want our guns, you know, that's the issue. Right.
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:35.760]  There's more guns, less crime and cops do run into people that have more firepower than them.
[1:57:35.760 --> 1:57:40.720]  As long as the cops don't want my guns. But what about New York saying they've got helicopters
[1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:46.480]  with missiles to shoot down air and jet aircraft? I mean, we have we've got helicopters here now,
[1:57:46.480 --> 1:57:51.680]  you know, so it's it's just I mean, I can tell you it's the police day. Well, that is what the
[1:57:51.680 --> 1:57:57.200]  militarization of police ends in is it's a foggy enemy and now terrorism is every activity that
[1:57:57.200 --> 1:58:02.080]  doesn't includes licking boots. And so every police force can now turn into an armed group
[1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:09.280]  to fight the shadowy enemy. Yeah, you read 1984 and it just it's unbelievable. Winston figures
[1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:15.040]  out that the government is just bombing itself. Yeah, it's it's it's unreal how this stuff just
[1:58:15.040 --> 1:58:19.680]  plays out. By the way, it's played out this way over and over and over. It's like the
[1:58:19.680 --> 1:58:23.360]  definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different
[1:58:23.360 --> 1:58:27.920]  outcome at people just need to know if you study history, this happened in the last century.
[1:58:27.920 --> 1:58:32.560]  So this government's building towards some type of big mega death event where it kills
[1:58:32.560 --> 1:58:35.920]  tens of millions of people. Anything else there, Ben?
[1:58:41.280 --> 1:58:47.120]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCN Live.com today.
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:56.720]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[1:58:56.720 --> 1:59:00.800]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming. And I think it's important for my
[1:59:00.800 --> 1:59:06.800]  listeners to do three things right away. Number one, study the past history really does repeat
[1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:14.640]  itself. Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends. Number three, take decisive
[1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:21.280]  action. A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis. That's why I'm telling everyone to
[1:59:21.280 --> 1:59:27.600]  read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines
[1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:33.680]  in history. Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits. This book is only available
[1:59:33.680 --> 1:59:39.120]  at risingpricesemptyshelves.com. You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival,
[1:59:39.120 --> 1:59:46.080]  how to cut your grocery bills in half. Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[1:59:46.080 --> 1:59:59.040]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.520 --> 2:00:12.800]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:12.800 --> 2:00:21.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.640 --> 2:00:28.240]  Okay, we're taking your calls and going over news. They now are claiming the towers did
[2:00:28.240 --> 2:00:34.880]  spontaneously combust. And so did this guy in England. They say police typically find burned
[2:00:34.880 --> 2:00:40.720]  corpses, but no burned furniture. The inquest by the coroner has found the 76-year-old man
[2:00:40.720 --> 2:00:46.560]  did spontaneously combust. And now the feds are saying the towers can spontaneously combust it.
[2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:50.720]  You know, they're now teaching in firefighting school, before they didn't teach us that a
[2:00:50.720 --> 2:00:55.200]  lighter will burn down a skyscraper. Of course, it never happened before and only on those days,
[2:00:55.200 --> 2:00:59.040]  but they've changed the laws of physics. Yes, they do that a lot. They do that with
[2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:04.640]  nuclear. They do that with heat temp on beams. They just kind of move the bar and just say
[2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:07.840]  that's the new normal. They're saying, oh, we're getting thousands of times higher
[2:01:07.840 --> 2:01:11.680]  the size of it. We'll just raise it 100,000 times what's safe. Well, they do that with pretty
[2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:17.440]  much everything in school, unfortunately. That's why they reteach American history. They reteach
[2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:22.800]  most things a fact to convert it to the narrative. Let's go ahead and take another call. And I'll
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:27.280]  continue with this. Explosions caused by jet fuel and water sprinklers brought down twin towers,
[2:01:27.280 --> 2:01:32.320]  9-11 scientists say. So now they've, they're seeing those explosions layers has been proven
[2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:36.080]  as the towers, you know, 45 minutes later, whatever, falling. That those are, first they
[2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:40.960]  weren't explosions. Now, oh yeah, the jet fuel somehow got kept and then, and then blew up.
[2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:46.240]  Even though you can't hardly get jet fuel to light on fire, unless it's been aerosolized,
[2:01:46.240 --> 2:01:51.040]  like in the initial impact. And of course, the firefighters reported the fires were basically
[2:01:51.040 --> 2:01:56.320]  out. But again, the government says Easter Bunny's did it. So it must be true. Let's go ahead and
[2:01:56.320 --> 2:02:00.800]  get you guys into trouble now. Let's go ahead and talk to Thomas in California. Go ahead.
[2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:06.960]  Hi, Mr. Jones. How are you done? I'm completely out of control. I go ahead.
[2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:13.360]  You guys have a great show here today. Basically, what I was, what I was thinking about was,
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:17.920]  how to get the media back on our side, since they've stolen our first amendment.
[2:02:18.480 --> 2:02:22.160]  And the corporate horror media, that's bought and paid for people that are,
[2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:26.080]  that are thinking about what they're going to be doing that night, you know, or at the golf course
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:30.080]  or whatever. They're not, they're reading off a teleprompter and teleprompters are bad because
[2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:33.920]  it allows the system to centralize talking points and then distribute them down.
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:38.960]  Isn't there a way to at least sue them or at least try and grab it back?
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:44.320]  You know, I think the best thing to do is when Fox and NBC and CNN get caught,
[2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:49.520]  they've all been caught, removing polls when Ron Paul wins and then giving it to someone else,
[2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:53.440]  point that out to people. You know, I mean, they're, they're losing their viewers.
[2:02:53.440 --> 2:02:58.400]  They're dying right now. Yeah, let me tell you, that's why the internet is, is such a pivotal,
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:03.600]  pivotal thing. You have, you can reach 6 billion people from your living room. That, that is
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:09.840]  unreal. The whole idea that you have to be, you know, CNN now to have a voice is, is just not true.
[2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:13.360]  No, more and more, it is a true level playing field. And that's why they're coming in with
[2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:17.200]  taxes and regulations and openly saying they got to shut down the web.
[2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:20.720]  Well, they got to control it because just like they could control the airways,
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:26.160]  now they want to control the web ways. And, you know, that the best thing we can do is to
[2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:30.800]  get on their blog, listen to people, support Alex, support people.
[2:03:30.800 --> 2:03:35.280]  That's right, folks. Listen, this information is vital and it's scaring the system. The
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:39.520]  Federal Reserve is panicking. So they want to counter the bloggers now. They're going to try
[2:03:39.520 --> 2:03:44.160]  to run false flags against the web. The Pentagon has said that to then start shutting it down,
[2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:49.440]  the name of saving it. Use it now while we've got it so that the genie is completely out of the
[2:03:49.440 --> 2:03:54.480]  bottle. I'd say the genie's about 80% of the bottle right now. We need that whole thing to come out.
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:03:58.560]  Whole genie needs to get out of there and then let them try to put a cap on it.
[2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:02.880]  Well, absolutely. And I mean, the way things are rolling out is, I mean, in the very near future,
[2:04:04.160 --> 2:04:09.760]  cable television, television period, is most likely going to be delivered through your internet
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:16.560]  line. Where's Al Gore going? Where's his conservative compatriot, his variant, his doppelganger,
[2:04:17.680 --> 2:04:22.000]  Glenn Beck to the internet? They know. But that's why they're going to try to restrict us and then
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:27.520]  only leave those. Call or make a point and then I'll let you go. Go ahead. Basically, I'm just
[2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:34.640]  hoping that people find their potential and start rising up. It's our time and we just have to do
[2:04:34.640 --> 2:04:40.560]  something. That's where I'm at. And I again, I totally hear you and respect that. What I'm saying
[2:04:40.560 --> 2:04:44.800]  is you're looking for some magic bullet and I understand that like we got to do something. We
[2:04:44.800 --> 2:04:50.320]  are doing something. Yeah. I mean, the Federal Reserve is freaking out upwards of 90%. Now I want
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:54.800]  to abolish it. No one knew what it was 10 years ago. That's right. They're talking about world
[2:04:54.800 --> 2:04:59.120]  government openly now. They can't hide it anymore. They're unclogged.
[2:05:02.240 --> 2:05:08.400]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[2:05:08.400 --> 2:05:13.520]  relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:19.680]  Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[2:05:19.680 --> 2:05:26.000]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:31.760]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[2:05:31.760 --> 2:05:36.880]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[2:05:36.880 --> 2:05:41.120]  Bernanke, and arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[2:05:41.120 --> 2:05:45.840]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[2:05:45.840 --> 2:05:52.800]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[2:07:00.720 --> 2:07:06.560]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day
[2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:11.920]  in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you
[2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:16.320]  shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own
[2:07:16.320 --> 2:07:21.040]  family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is
[2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:26.240]  he's usually right. You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's
[2:07:26.240 --> 2:07:31.840]  biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[2:07:31.840 --> 2:07:36.320]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most
[2:07:36.320 --> 2:07:41.520]  important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least
[2:07:41.520 --> 2:07:45.600]  watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple
[2:07:45.600 --> 2:07:52.000]  steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:58.800]  That's End of America, the number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's
[2:07:58.800 --> 2:08:06.480]  End of America 3.com. From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines,
[2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:12.160]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:17.680 --> 2:08:24.240]  We're going to go to your phone calls, but Harold Yule was bringing up the city states, the exempt
[2:08:24.240 --> 2:08:29.600]  city states that say they're sovereign, and in regardless of what your view, they do. The District
[2:08:29.600 --> 2:08:35.040]  of Criminals, D.C., at least the last 100 years or so, has operated as a private corporation,
[2:08:35.040 --> 2:08:39.840]  Admiralty Law, exempt above the law. You've got the Vatican, exempt above the law. You've got the
[2:08:39.840 --> 2:08:46.160]  City of London within London, the financial system. Israel has basically been set up to be a
[2:08:46.160 --> 2:08:52.320]  operational hub and to be a city state that says it's exempt from the UN. The UN has been set up
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:09:00.320]  as kind of this global arbiter or an attempt to get countries to sign on to waive their rights to it
[2:09:00.320 --> 2:09:04.720]  or as a conduit for IMF and World Bank for the City of London to come in and buy them off.
[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:10.640]  So really, it's just a bunch of exempt, piratical organizations running around doing whatever they
[2:09:10.640 --> 2:09:15.280]  want. I mean, a lot of people serve one of those groups or the other or don't serve it.
[2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:21.200]  I'm saying I want to be an individual. I don't want these big, foreign, offshore, exempt cities in
[2:09:21.200 --> 2:09:30.240]  the sky to be down here telling me what to do. I mean, I'm saying I don't answer to you. I'm not
[2:09:30.240 --> 2:09:35.600]  your slave. Yeah, the answer is not to take over these institutions. The answer is to liberate
[2:09:35.600 --> 2:09:39.680]  ourselves from them and either get rid of them or just get them to leave us alone and let us go
[2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:45.600]  liver on them. Yes, and you were asking me how do we counter this. And I think instead of always
[2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:49.760]  looking at the puppets these systems buy and then fight with each other and the treaties they have
[2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:53.440]  and the deals they have, but these groups are fighting with each other always and the whole
[2:09:53.440 --> 2:09:58.080]  Masonic philosophy over the whole thing at the same time, which is just ancient mystery religion,
[2:09:58.800 --> 2:10:05.680]  ancient government system, gang mentality, inner knowledge, upper party, inner party,
[2:10:05.680 --> 2:10:11.440]  outer party, proletariat. I mean, it's all a pyramid. You destroy the pyramid and you say all
[2:10:11.440 --> 2:10:18.720]  the knowledge, release it all, freedom now for everybody, no more games. And you basically
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:24.960]  expose the secrets. You expose the magician's tricks. Yeah, that's I think that can be more
[2:10:24.960 --> 2:10:28.400]  right on. Yeah, I agree. I mean, it's kind of like we talk right in that mic. I'm sorry. It's
[2:10:28.400 --> 2:10:33.200]  directional. Go ahead. We know we've always had divine right or the idea of monarchs or kings
[2:10:33.200 --> 2:10:38.800]  or pharaoh rule. And like I said, in America, we didn't set it up that way. But that is this old
[2:10:38.800 --> 2:10:43.680]  and the the empire idea this like national city states. I mean, those aren't new ideas.
[2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:49.360]  And they just been interjected into this, the new idea of America. And it comes over here. And yet
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:56.000]  we do have DC, we do have inner city London, we do have the idea of these overlord that can't be a
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:05.200]  part of us. You're not and you're separate. You're a subject. Essentially, yes. And so yeah, it is
[2:11:05.200 --> 2:11:11.280]  exposing that, but it's also understanding that it is a tactic like going back to your idea of the
[2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:18.160]  whole false flag. That's happened throughout history and not just our current empire, but or America,
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:23.920]  but you know, when Gulf of Tonkin occurred, no one really even understood that it was a tactic
[2:11:23.920 --> 2:11:31.840]  that was relatively brand new in the public opinion. And then 9 11, you saw the spike at 9
[2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:36.640]  11 on that Gallup poll, everything went up, everything spiked right to the top because
[2:11:36.640 --> 2:11:41.440]  out of order out of the crisis, you can create an order that at some point you'll rally, but it
[2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:46.960]  didn't rally long. It wasn't like the it was even a couple of years. So I think exposing the idea
[2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:52.240]  that the tactic of false flag even exists is a win for us. No, I agree. Every time they've got a
[2:11:52.240 --> 2:11:59.680]  counter us that we win, just responding to us, we're winning. Yeah. Yeah. The fact that what's
[2:11:59.680 --> 2:12:05.600]  amazing is for the first time, I mean, you watch these GOP debates, I have never heard four years
[2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:11.200]  ago was the first time I heard anybody at least in my lifetime ever talk about the Federal Reserve.
[2:12:11.200 --> 2:12:15.440]  And that's, you know, Ron Paul, who they were like, okay, we'll give him his token two minutes
[2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:20.560]  because he's got a couple followers. Now all of a sudden, you've got all of the establishment
[2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:25.600]  candidates, they all like they have to address it regardless of if they have any intention of
[2:12:25.600 --> 2:12:31.920]  doing anything about it whatsoever. Every they're being forced to address it. And that in and of
[2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:37.760]  itself shows a huge first they first they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win. Well,
[2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:44.640]  I just say even like I was I've told Harold I go, you know, Rick Perry, the fact that he got popular
[2:12:44.640 --> 2:12:50.160]  on a tactic, it doesn't even matter that he it's not that he believes it. The fact that he had to
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:54.480]  act like Ron Paul to become the number one candidate. Exactly. Shows were winning. Exactly.
[2:12:54.480 --> 2:12:59.280]  Because he's running on Ron Paul's message, but just saying, well, I'm the better package. But
[2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:03.040]  the one that became evident that he was the opposite of what he was saying, that made it
[2:13:03.040 --> 2:13:08.880]  even worse for him. And now he's on fire, plunging to earth. That's absolutely right. And now we
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:13.600]  can do that. We can we can watch Mitt Romney spontaneously combust. Because if we just put
[2:13:13.600 --> 2:13:18.080]  out his record, it's over. Well, that's why they keep saying, you know, oh, the Tea Party,
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:23.440]  oh, everybody hates the Tea Party. And they, you know, after the congressional standoff,
[2:13:23.440 --> 2:13:29.520]  they just try and marginalize it. Oh, Ron Paul's message is this message keeps winning. And what
[2:13:29.520 --> 2:13:32.880]  sick is you can all these local talk show hosts who aren't getting talking points,
[2:13:32.880 --> 2:13:37.120]  they think they're smart, just repeating it. And every caller is calling and getting mad.
[2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:44.320]  And you hear the host just like floundering now, because it's it's it's but I love it.
[2:13:44.320 --> 2:13:49.120]  Yes, it's the idea of the new language, you know, and you've been stuck in a jargon system with
[2:13:49.120 --> 2:13:54.080]  the paradigm, you have to use certain words and saying things like false flag is a scary thing
[2:13:54.080 --> 2:13:59.120]  to even say for some people, because it's just it's just a new vocabulary that's been interjected
[2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:04.080]  into the media stream that is exactly it's not just yeah, I'm just not going to believe what I'm
[2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:08.800]  told immediately. Well, that's why okay, in five minutes, they told us bin Laden did it. Okay,
[2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:12.800]  now I'm going to look at the facts and see if that adds up. No, it doesn't. Well, that's why I mean
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:18.720]  the fact the fact that the the the leading candidate had, you know, called got ripped for calling Social
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:25.520]  Security a Ponzi scheme by the media, but it clearly fits every metric of a Ponzi scheme. That's why
[2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:32.480]  I don't understand why people want to say, well, what I believe means that it's true. Well,
[2:14:32.480 --> 2:14:37.120]  that's like the list of whatever you believe it is or not. So you can either embrace it,
[2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:40.400]  and we can get to doing something. Well, yeah, or people can stick their head in the ground.
[2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:44.960]  That's like the EPA, just saying, okay, this isotope will will say you can have a thousand
[2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:50.480]  times higher, it's safe from Fukushima, right, this one 25,000, this one 100,000. I mean, right
[2:14:50.480 --> 2:14:56.240]  there shows this delusional Orwellian thing where they could just say gravity doesn't exist tomorrow.
[2:14:56.240 --> 2:15:01.520]  But Hayes a pollutant. Oh, yeah, now we've got to tax the farmers because their hay is a pollutant.
[2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:05.600]  That's right. That's right. No, it's completed. It's the same thing with the FDA. It's like,
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:10.800]  okay, the FDA says it's okay. So that means they're bulletproof. Yeah, now they can now they can
[2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:14.320]  radiate. We always think of governments going to protect us. No, they're saying they can radiate.
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:18.160]  They're saying we can have GMO. That's the incredible thing. When you go study the actual
[2:15:18.160 --> 2:15:21.360]  environmental movement, not the well-meaning folks on the ground who don't want to drink poison or
[2:15:21.360 --> 2:15:26.400]  whatever. It's always cold-blooded eugenics groups who want to divert you from all the real
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:30.160]  environmental issues that are going on. And they control the whole debate and make it about carbon
[2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:36.320]  dioxide. Well, I mean, a lot of the, not all environmentalists, I mean, I'm very much for
[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:40.320]  clean air and clean water. I think most people are, but really it's a power grab. But when you get
[2:15:40.320 --> 2:15:46.240]  up into some deep theology that goes into this thing, I mean, they start talking about this whole
[2:15:46.240 --> 2:15:52.880]  global taxing scheme. It's like there's people who are trying to corruptly hijack the system and make
[2:15:52.880 --> 2:15:58.000]  a whole ton of money and control the resources. But on the other side, no one talks about the
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  impact on humanity. It's like if you go ahead and you cut off all the oil and make or make it five
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:09.280]  or six dollars a barrel, these people go over and they're like, well, let's go ahead and inoculate.
[2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:13.600]  You know, they cry about the children dying in Africa because we can't give them a 50 cent
[2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:18.400]  inoculation. But oh, by the way, I want you to all get sick and die because you burn cow dung
[2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:24.000]  to stay warm and not have less expensive oil because, well, we may be impacting the planet
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:29.520]  to get warmer. I'm just saying there's a cost to doing something and there's a cost to doing nothing.
[2:16:29.520 --> 2:16:36.800]  Yeah, but the idea, the idea that carbon dioxide use the big pollutant, they just chose that as a
[2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:41.920]  way to tax everything. Well, that's cold blooded from the beginning. They know full well is,
[2:16:41.920 --> 2:16:46.960]  you know, the point I'm trying. I mean, I bought the Avatar box set. Okay, just I bought it yesterday
[2:16:46.960 --> 2:16:52.640]  and I was reading through it this morning and you open it up and they're advertising the activist
[2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:59.760]  guide to Avatar to book. So I went and went and looked at it online and it's this fantasy world
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:05.200]  where you're attacking industry on earth fighting for the blue aliens back on earth.
[2:17:05.760 --> 2:17:10.640]  And it just shows how the whole thing is about this false, false template of they know there's a
[2:17:10.640 --> 2:17:15.360]  revolution coming. So they want to make it about tackling on your neighbor for not having energy
[2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:20.160]  efficient windows instead of like worrying about all the serious issues that are going on.
[2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:24.480]  Let's jam a call in here. I've just got to do it. They're going to kill me. Steven Florida,
[2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:30.880]  you're on the air. Welcome. Yeah, good afternoon. I want to let you know, first of all, I don't
[2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:36.080]  know about the twin powers of the spontaneous combustion, but I can tell you something in the
[2:17:36.080 --> 2:17:42.320]  political realm. There are twin powers that are experiencing spontaneous time busted and that's
[2:17:42.320 --> 2:17:47.600]  Mitt Romney and Rick Perry. Thanks to the coverage you've given that this morning.
[2:17:47.600 --> 2:17:54.080]  And so I appreciate that. But I wanted to tell you that about a month ago, I actually got to
[2:17:54.080 --> 2:18:00.000]  meet with a congressman from here in Florida named Bill Posey. And I was very encouraged by
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:06.960]  the meeting I had with him. I gave him a copy of your terror storm. And I specifically had told
[2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:11.520]  the staffer that I wanted to talk to him about the war on terror since 9 11 was coming up with
[2:18:11.520 --> 2:18:17.520]  the anniversary. And I asked him what his views were on that. Now, he's basically tolling the party
[2:18:17.520 --> 2:18:23.200]  line, believing about al-Qaeda and all that kind of stuff. So I brought up several points about
[2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:30.560]  Sam bin Laden wasn't listed as one of the, that was not listed as one of his crimes on the FBI's
[2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:36.800]  website and about the six to the 10 commissioners on the 9 11 commission wanting a new investigation
[2:18:36.800 --> 2:18:41.920]  because it was fraudulent. And his eyes just bugged out when I said this stuff. And I also
[2:18:41.920 --> 2:18:47.600]  mentioned GMO foods, but he took notes and I was very encouraged that I was able to meet with him.
[2:18:47.600 --> 2:18:54.240]  And he actually was one of the first co-sponsors with Glenn Paul of his audit, the Fed Bill.
[2:18:54.240 --> 2:19:00.400]  And he said he meets with him for lunch once a week on Thursday. So, you know, and I encouraged
[2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:06.960]  him, please, that's the only candidate that we should support. If anybody else is supported,
[2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:11.200]  we're going to see four more years of the abomination. So I was very encouraged.
[2:19:11.200 --> 2:19:15.440]  The fact that I got 15 minutes with this man and he was open to hear what I had.
[2:19:15.440 --> 2:19:19.440]  Well, that's another thing. I mean, go to city council meetings, go to meet with your congress
[2:19:19.440 --> 2:19:24.880]  person, get involved. Don't just sit there and go, thank you, Alex for being there. You know, thank
[2:19:24.880 --> 2:19:31.120]  you, you know, Tad for making the American dream, by the way, available at infowars.com.
[2:19:31.840 --> 2:19:36.880]  It's about getting involved, getting our message out. Like you were saying earlier,
[2:19:36.880 --> 2:19:42.480]  out there on the street, every person you talk to shatters the illusion that the mainstream
[2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:46.640]  corporate media puts out that we're alone. We're actually the majority. I appreciate your call.
[2:19:46.640 --> 2:19:50.000]  Do one more segment with us. A few more calls straight ahead. I'll continue with calls throughout
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:54.800]  the hour, even after our guest have left us. But the DVD is the American dream, Fighting the

[2:20:07.120 --> 2:20:11.120]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming. And I think it's important for my
[2:20:11.120 --> 2:20:17.600]  listeners to do three things right away. Number one, study the past history really does repeat itself.
[2:20:17.600 --> 2:20:25.360]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends. Number three, take decisive action.

[2:23:00.320 --> 2:23:04.960]  Why is it so many people suffer from so many illnesses today? Why don't doctors know how to
[2:23:04.960 --> 2:23:09.280]  help you? Could it be that our doctors don't know how because there's a nutrition solution
[2:23:09.280 --> 2:23:14.880]  and they only know about drugs? Over 68 diseases are connected to a deficiency of glutathione.
[2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:19.440]  The missing ingredient to increasing your body's production of glutathione is cysteine.
[2:23:19.440 --> 2:23:23.760]  Raising your glutathione production protects you from cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's,
[2:23:23.760 --> 2:23:30.000]  macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS,
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:34.560]  rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. Nature's richest source of cysteine is unheated
[2:23:34.560 --> 2:23:38.800]  whey. Heating can damage much of the cysteine. One-world whey is the first
[2:23:38.800 --> 2:23:44.080]  undamaged whey protein on the market. Using one-world whey may support optimal glutathione
[2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:51.040]  production unlike any other food or supplement you've ever taken. Call 888-988-3325. That's
[2:23:51.040 --> 2:24:17.040]  888-988-3325 or visit 1worldwhey.com. That's 1worldwhey.com.
[2:24:21.360 --> 2:24:30.800]  Okay, I'll continue with your phone calls throughout the hour after our guest
[2:24:30.800 --> 2:24:35.200]  leave us here in a moment, the makers of American Dream. And I've got a lot of news.
[2:24:35.200 --> 2:24:38.720]  Obviously, we haven't gotten to that I'll be mentioning and going over as well.
[2:24:39.440 --> 2:24:43.600]  But we're joined by Harold Yule and Tad Lumkin, the makers of American Dream.
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:48.560]  I want to go to Tim in Germany and Martha in Iowa, Tim, Keith, Chris, and others.
[2:24:48.560 --> 2:24:51.760]  But any other points you guys would like to briefly have before we go to this call?
[2:24:53.200 --> 2:24:57.120]  No, I mean, I think the most important thing picking up what you finished right before the
[2:24:57.120 --> 2:25:03.760]  break with is that people have started to get strategic about spreading this message to people.
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:08.000]  I mean, the reason we made this film and there's other good pieces out there on different issues,
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:12.400]  but the reason we made this film short and entertaining and simple and easy to understand
[2:25:12.400 --> 2:25:19.040]  was we're like, guys, here's your tool, get 10 copies, give them to 10 of your friends who are
[2:25:19.040 --> 2:25:22.720]  not currently on board. Maybe they're just frustrated and they don't understand what's
[2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:27.680]  going on and they voted for Bush and he let them down and they voted for Obama and he let them down
[2:25:27.680 --> 2:25:34.160]  and it's like, watch the film and see if just one of those people gets on board and then challenge
[2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:39.760]  them to go show 10 people. Like that's how this stuff happens. And that's what we need to start
[2:25:39.760 --> 2:25:46.160]  doing is finding things. We can't hand them a 400 page tome on Austrian economics and
[2:25:47.520 --> 2:25:52.880]  the things of liberty, but we need to find like a 10 minute piece on Ron Paul that Ron Paul lays out
[2:25:52.880 --> 2:25:59.040]  his... We need the 21st century version of the Pample of Tears. That's right. Just broad sheets
[2:25:59.040 --> 2:26:05.280]  that had basic facts. That's right. I mean, the power of you, you are the power. You are the solution.
[2:26:05.280 --> 2:26:10.000]  Again, I've covered it with first hour. I'll cover it more later coming up. The globalists are panicking
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:15.280]  right now. The Federal Reserve admits that their image is trashed and now they're going to try to
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:22.000]  intimidate people and keep a list of people and then contact media to try to influence them.
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:28.160]  It isn't going to work. They have been arrogant. They've just now realized we've already blown
[2:26:28.160 --> 2:26:32.560]  gaping holes in them. They're going to crawl off and die. The question is, are they going to drag
[2:26:32.560 --> 2:26:37.600]  our civilization down with them? That's right. Well, I mean, people are starting to look for
[2:26:37.600 --> 2:26:42.160]  answers and the people who have the answer of liberty need to give those other people the
[2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:45.680]  answer. They can't sit around with their other friends at a coffee shop. No, we've got to look.
[2:26:45.680 --> 2:26:51.040]  All of you have got 50 caliber weapons. We've got a pretty powerful weapon system here,
[2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:55.440]  Death Star level, if you want to give a Star Wars analogy. The Dredge reports like five death stars
[2:26:55.440 --> 2:27:00.160]  when they cover real news. But the point is, all of you, even the smallest person that doesn't know
[2:27:00.160 --> 2:27:04.480]  many people, by smallest means smallest circle of people, you're like a 50 caliber machine gun at
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:08.000]  point length range of the New World Order. That's right. Start blasting them in the info war.
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:11.920]  That's right. That's exactly what's got to happen. And people have to think strategically
[2:27:11.920 --> 2:27:18.720]  and go to those that are still wandering around the wilderness like we have to go to them. It's
[2:27:18.720 --> 2:27:23.520]  not their job to come to us. We need to go to them. That's that's the anything that's on TV,
[2:27:23.520 --> 2:27:31.520]  county commissioners, schools, board, access TV, city council, state legislature, the pattern and
[2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:35.280]  don't think you're just going to beat them the first time. It's hammering them. Yes. Hammer,
[2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:39.120]  hammer, hammer. Let's jam on a call. I'll come back with more Martha and Iowa. Then I'll come back
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:44.080]  and go to the Deutsche Call and all the others. Go ahead, Martha. You're on the air or Martina.
[2:27:44.080 --> 2:27:50.240]  Excuse me. I can't read. That's fine. I'm just calling. I read an article and I'm not for sure
[2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:58.640]  if it's real. It says the Obama administration said to ban as many as over environmental concern.
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:02.640]  No, no, that's true. And I meant to cover that Sunday. That was in my stack yesterday. So what
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:07.760]  happens is I read all this news, then I blow up and never even cover it. It's just like, yes,
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:11.920]  they're saying the gas in it is bad for the earth. So they're going to ban that type of
[2:28:11.920 --> 2:28:16.080]  asthma inhaler. It's going to increase the price a lot. But it's all about we control the toilet.
[2:28:16.080 --> 2:28:20.640]  We control the light bulb. We control the dishwasher. We're going to shut down the power plants unless
[2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:24.000]  we own them because they have carbon dioxide coming out. Nothing comes out of these new
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:27.600]  clean ones, but that water vapor and that. So they're going to do that. But then General Electric,
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:35.520]  it's a waiver. Yes, ma'am. It's true. Europe has banned space heaters. Counter ones. So Obama,
[2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:40.480]  if this doesn't prove that he's working for the pharmaceutical companies, I don't know what does.
[2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:45.360]  Yeah, they banned them. They banned them over the counter. You got to get them.
[2:28:45.920 --> 2:28:49.760]  Guys, when you pull that up, Obama, I think it was like the Hill newspaper,
[2:28:49.760 --> 2:28:55.440]  Obama set to ban inhalers. Yeah, that's true. This says Fox station.
[2:28:56.560 --> 2:29:01.920]  No, no, it's real. I read the environmental regulations yesterday. It's real. But again,
[2:29:01.920 --> 2:29:07.280]  it's all about they say government sense. Yes. And then the big corporations that lobby government,
[2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:12.560]  they're exempt. Yeah, that's right. I mean, it's all part of Obama works for the hijacked state.
[2:29:12.560 --> 2:29:16.480]  That's who he works. It doesn't. There's like always owned by the pharmaceutical. It's it's
[2:29:16.480 --> 2:29:22.000]  the whole idea that we're going to control the people and that every problem is filled with
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:25.600]  government. That's the mistake. It's like, Oh, there's a problem. Let's fill it with government.
[2:29:25.600 --> 2:29:30.320]  Like they're these angels that come down with with smarter superpowers. No, all they are is people
[2:29:30.320 --> 2:29:34.880]  that take more your liberty, more your money or control over you. And then there and then there's
[2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:39.920]  a huge arms buildup of spying and weapons against us. They're marching around training and take over
[2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:44.000]  admitting it. They're like, we're friendly, we're friendly, more tax money, build the army up,
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:47.840]  they're waking up to us. Gentlemen, great job with the film. Look forward to talking to you again in
[2:29:47.840 --> 2:29:51.680]  the near future. Absolutely. Thank you. We'll be right back with your calls. We're on the march,
[2:29:51.680 --> 2:30:02.560]  the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones with five good
[2:30:02.560 --> 2:30:07.520]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation
[2:30:07.520 --> 2:30:12.640]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control
[2:30:12.640 --> 2:30:17.600]  how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of
[2:30:17.600 --> 2:30:22.880]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the
[2:30:22.880 --> 2:30:28.240]  country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only
[2:30:28.240 --> 2:30:33.280]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every
[2:30:33.280 --> 2:30:38.240]  year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power
[2:30:38.240 --> 2:30:42.640]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the
[2:30:42.640 --> 2:30:47.440]  solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors. You can get more

[2:33:09.760 --> 2:33:25.680]  If you leave me, I won't miss you, and I won't ever take you back.
[2:33:25.680 --> 2:33:30.160]  Crank that up for a minute. Girl, your memory.
[2:33:30.160 --> 2:33:33.760]  Why don't I just quit? Move out in the country somewhere?
[2:33:33.760 --> 2:33:39.200]  Well, I guess I already live in the country. Just sit around and listen to George Strait.
[2:33:46.160 --> 2:33:49.200]  The problem is they're not going to let me do that. They're not going to leave me alone,
[2:33:50.560 --> 2:33:56.880]  and they're not going to leave you alone. And that's why I tend to get so angry all the time,
[2:33:56.880 --> 2:34:06.800]  is that I never cease to amaze me how ruthless and criminal the control freaks are. The worst
[2:34:06.800 --> 2:34:12.400]  elements of society when we've grown a giant government and handed it over to the private
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:16.880]  corporations that are the opposite of free market and want to shut down our free society.
[2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:22.400]  You know, when I was driving up to Arkansas and back, I saw signs that ran to New World Order.
[2:34:22.400 --> 2:34:29.600]  I saw an M4Wars.com bumper sticker. I saw a no to animal ID, premises ID sign in somebody's yard.
[2:34:30.240 --> 2:34:34.320]  I saw a lot of people waking up and ran to people at gas stations, you name it,
[2:34:34.320 --> 2:34:37.360]  that were listeners. And that's only an indicator of how many people are awake.
[2:34:37.360 --> 2:34:39.760]  Guys, I forgot to tell you during the break saying bye to those guys.
[2:34:40.320 --> 2:34:42.960]  Will you pull me out of yesterday's stack, because that is something I need to mention
[2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:49.120]  or put it on screen, Obama administration set to ban inhalers over greenhouse gas.
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:53.520]  I want to show that because I understand that sounds crazy. And I understand.
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:56.080]  I don't want to just have a caller that said she saw it on Fox.
[2:34:56.960 --> 2:34:59.520]  And then, you know, she's asking me if it's real. Yes, it's real.
[2:34:59.520 --> 2:35:02.640]  Like a woman heard a woman on the radio yesterday locally going,
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:07.200]  is it true Ron Paul's in third place? He says he is. And I don't think he's a liar.
[2:35:08.640 --> 2:35:10.320]  And the host is basically like, no.
[2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:16.480]  Well, yeah, really, I showed Rasmussen and Gallup. He's at least in third.
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:21.040]  Yeah, there it is. The Atlantic is reporting international ban on CFCs,
[2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:27.200]  claims cheap over the counter inhalers. That means claims means gets rid of them.
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:30.800]  Go to another one, though. That's the Atlantic spending it. They love it.
[2:35:31.520 --> 2:35:35.280]  But yeah, no, there it is admitted. I saw I saw like, I think it was a
[2:35:37.040 --> 2:35:41.680]  hill newspaper one that actually had the text pretty close in there.
[2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:44.800]  That's the one that was in yesterday's stack is if you guys can keep track of all the
[2:35:44.800 --> 2:35:48.800]  piles of paperwork I leave behind me, like some kind of demonic gerbil,
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:53.840]  you know, gerbils and has a living like
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:00.160]  not even so much wood shavings with paper shavings or whatever it is.
[2:36:01.040 --> 2:36:04.160]  I mean, look, folks, if you don't know government, yeah, there's a London Guardian.
[2:36:04.160 --> 2:36:07.840]  Obama administration set to ban asthma inhalers over environmental concerns.
[2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:14.000]  Now that's actually Fox Nation. Sorry. It looks that font is the exact same font and header of
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:18.800]  a London Guardian, which I think is the most pleasing font and look. I think I'm going to have
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:24.720]  my websites changed over to that headline style right now. That's a problem. I have hundreds
[2:36:24.720 --> 2:36:29.280]  of innovation ideas that I can't implement all of them. I'm trying to hire people. I'm trying to
[2:36:29.280 --> 2:36:33.760]  train them that I'm trying to get the capital be able to do that. And that's why your support
[2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:39.680]  of info wars.com is absolutely essential. I had my big brainstorm this morning after jogging.
[2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:46.080]  You know, I'm up to jogging three miles, ladies and gentlemen. I know that's pathetic for most
[2:36:46.080 --> 2:36:51.520]  of you, but for me, that is far. I haven't been able to jog three miles in more than 10 years.
[2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:57.040]  I used to jog six miles almost every day and lift weights about two hours a day. And then
[2:36:57.040 --> 2:37:02.960]  when I was about 25, I quit everything, all exercise, quit everything. So I was about 34
[2:37:02.960 --> 2:37:12.320]  and turned into the slovenly creature I am now today. But I certainly had a big brainstorm
[2:37:12.320 --> 2:37:17.520]  this morning. I even recorded the simple points I wanted to make. But you know what? Let's just
[2:37:17.520 --> 2:37:21.200]  go to your calls and then I'll kind of reassess and go through some of these news items.
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:26.960]  Let's talk to Tim in Germany than Keith in North Carolina. Tim, you're on the air. Welcome.
[2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:33.200]  Howdy Alex. Thanks for taking my call. What you spoke with your guests a little bit earlier
[2:37:33.840 --> 2:37:40.160]  really resonates and showing true in Germany as well. What you discussed was that they are
[2:37:40.160 --> 2:37:45.840]  feeding the heat. We are all turning on them, that they start to losing losing the heads and
[2:37:45.840 --> 2:37:51.520]  that they start to get irrational and try to do things in a hurry. Because what happened last night
[2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:57.760]  is that Chancellor Merkel on German state television, the primary channel would be like BBC
[2:37:57.760 --> 2:38:06.000]  in the UK started saying in a prime time talk show to which she invited herself only that afternoon
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:11.280]  that was widely reported in the press as well. She started saying that there needs to be a
[2:38:11.280 --> 2:38:16.960]  mechanism for the EU to govern against the will of non-compliant states and parliaments
[2:38:16.960 --> 2:38:22.560]  basically saying there needs to be an end to a partial end to serenity of these nations.
[2:38:23.200 --> 2:38:28.160]  So Merkel really went open last night. I mean we all know that this is what they want.
[2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:31.280]  Well I want to stop you. I want to stop you. That's why I must have a lot of calls from
[2:38:31.280 --> 2:38:36.960]  Germans and from Germany because I see calls from Germany. I see you're German in North Carolina.
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:43.120]  That's what I'm saying here. This is earth shaking. There should be scientists and doctors
[2:38:43.120 --> 2:38:48.320]  and playwrights and the most well-spoken people in the world should be out here fighting it not
[2:38:48.320 --> 2:38:55.360]  some redneck from Texas. This is so huge and before they set this up they said your kooks if you
[2:38:55.360 --> 2:39:00.560]  talk about global government, your kooks if you say the euro is authoritarian. When Hermann von
[2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:05.440]  Ruppi said two years ago we are going to set up world government the next two years they engineer
[2:39:05.440 --> 2:39:10.960]  the implosion. I told people 10 years ago they would do this in the US and in Europe
[2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:16.720]  they're now merging it. They admit listen I told you two weeks ago I heard Bloomberg and CNBC
[2:39:16.720 --> 2:39:24.240]  because I can listen to both on XM you know TV on radio. Both of them say the problem is democracy
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:29.440]  which we know again is another bastardization. It's really a republic. The problem is individual
[2:39:29.440 --> 2:39:35.280]  rights enshrined in a nation's sovereignty with the people of sovereigns but they said on CNBC
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:41.600]  in the same day while I was listening driving and on Bloomberg financial the problem is the Germans
[2:39:42.160 --> 2:39:46.880]  all want to keep sovereignty so will the French so we've got to get rid of their sovereignty we
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:52.640]  got to get rid of freedom and they're openly saying you want your pensions you want your future
[2:39:52.640 --> 2:39:59.680]  give all your power to the EU bureaucracy to punish countries that don't follow orders that
[2:39:59.680 --> 2:40:07.120]  that can this is dictatorship a financial dictatorship and yes guys put it on screen I
[2:40:07.120 --> 2:40:14.160]  covered it last night briefly Merkel it was quoting her on the show Merkel headline Europe has six
[2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:18.400]  weeks to live and they're going to hold everything you've got hostage they're going to plunge your
[2:40:18.400 --> 2:40:23.680]  markets if you don't do what they want until you give them dictatorship instead of conquering you
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:29.280]  like Napoleon or Hitler or others did with military force or the British have done they
[2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:34.720]  are conquering through financial fraud this has been their move the world government is here
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:41.440]  it is earth shaking and I can't get the average jackass yuppie there it is daily mail six weeks
[2:40:41.440 --> 2:40:49.040]  to save the euro chancellor's warning after another day of financial turmoil they are
[2:40:49.760 --> 2:40:54.640]  implementing all this stuff so sorry Keith sounds like you're German give us your view on this
[2:40:54.640 --> 2:41:06.080]  yes how many not keys um um the problem is as you said this is a global thing and what what is
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:13.440]  really regretful to me as a germaness um to see as you stated that many americans would have the
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:20.320]  options you guys got one of the most uh one of the strongest insurance policies against the
[2:41:20.320 --> 2:41:26.000]  government go and rock against the citizens you guys are you have the right to be armed and in
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:32.960]  germany you have restrictions they use any gun incident that happens even though some of them
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:40.720]  looked very strange and had false black characteristics with them and they use any of these things to
[2:41:40.720 --> 2:41:47.600]  demonize gun users the gun users and all of that and you guys in the united states have that you
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:54.000]  guys could really be the one saving german people from dictatorship again because if you stop that
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:59.520]  stuff in the united states uh it would really help the world as well because it would be a strong
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:07.360]  symbol to to these globalists and and dictators uh that want to be these mad men that they think
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:12.640]  they can govern you better than uh anything else they think uh well let's be clear they don't think
[2:42:12.640 --> 2:42:19.840]  they can govern us better they are eugenicists who have created a cosmology of their greed and their
[2:42:19.840 --> 2:42:26.640]  hatred for individuals they love sorrow they love pain and i've heard people spin it that germany
[2:42:26.640 --> 2:42:31.280]  because it's the only country not completely bankrupt is somehow taking over it's not germany
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:38.640]  taking over it's germany being sucked dry to fund the private european slash us-based british banks
[2:42:38.640 --> 2:42:44.720]  that are using the euro as a receivership arm take take irland the big success story 10 growth
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:51.120]  rates a year for a decade low taxes they signed the euro last year and overnight are bankrupted
[2:42:51.920 --> 2:42:56.960]  and and again signed on to debt that they didn't oh god bless you i appreciate your call by the way
[2:42:56.960 --> 2:43:02.320]  when i jaren found that headline and then corrected me it's uh what george osborne
[2:43:02.880 --> 2:43:06.720]  one of the central bank guys said six weeks i was crossing that with merkel
[2:43:06.720 --> 2:43:15.200]  merkel said europe will fail as if europe is the e you see no it's not a bunch of bankers
[2:43:15.200 --> 2:43:20.800]  see how they do that europe is now bankers europe will fail uh soon if they don't do this a very
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:24.560]  similar talking point they found a slightly different headline about the six weeks thing
[2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:29.440]  the point is that yes she's running around doing this just like they said three and a half years
[2:43:29.440 --> 2:43:34.240]  ago give us trillions of dollars or they'll be martial law and then notice they said give us
[2:43:34.240 --> 2:43:38.400]  hundreds of billions more for grief so they'll be martial law and then and then another bailout
[2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:44.480]  another bailout another bailout this is all designed because the general public has no
[2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:50.240]  basic adult understanding of basic geopolitical systems finances anything
[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:58.720]  it's very elementary we have a group of finance oligarchs that are anti-free market anti-family
[2:43:58.720 --> 2:44:07.040]  i mean go read goldman sacks jp morgan and others go read the the uh big french banks all of them
[2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:14.080]  all of their heads every one of their heads openly goes to big eugenics conferences and
[2:44:14.080 --> 2:44:21.200]  nature conservancy garbage and they fund the carbon taxes the anti-family green police all of it
[2:44:22.720 --> 2:44:28.000]  look it's very elementary they create a guilt ridden system where they teach you that you're
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:33.760]  bad and progress is bad and you having any type of wealth is bad so you're all guilty and will
[2:44:33.760 --> 2:44:39.920]  live like a slave now for the west it's it means poverty for the third world it's a death sentence
[2:44:40.640 --> 2:44:44.240]  and they go well you know some trendies go well we got to go ahead and kill the third world
[2:44:44.240 --> 2:44:50.000]  it's hurting the earth you know it's avatar whatever don't you understand they block the
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:54.960]  third world from industrializing and actually having less people so even in their own argument
[2:44:54.960 --> 2:45:00.240]  they cold-bloodily did this to these people of course there's areas where they're squalor and
[2:45:00.240 --> 2:45:06.400]  people are poor and overpopulated but it's because they've been forced off the land
[2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:12.640]  in two compact cities i mean just watson's article last night the new york times defending
[2:45:12.640 --> 2:45:18.480]  a world bank corporation that sends in troops to just burn down neighborhoods and rural communities
[2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:26.400]  and shoot people to put trees on their farmland to to to lower the carbon footprint it's nothing
[2:45:26.400 --> 2:45:31.520]  but cold-blooded genocide but because because you're looking for hitler or Stalin or Mao or
[2:45:31.520 --> 2:45:38.000]  Pol Pot you're looking for the last killer the last scam the last deal you don't recognize this one
[2:45:39.440 --> 2:45:44.320]  because it isn't about personalities that's why the greenies have told al gore to step down
[2:45:44.320 --> 2:45:48.400]  because he's been discredited they said we need a new spokesman al sit down and shut up
[2:45:50.960 --> 2:45:56.480]  hundreds of publications last week said al gore go away you are hurting us
[2:45:59.600 --> 2:46:02.960]  why did monsanto change their name a few years ago and then change it back
[2:46:02.960 --> 2:46:07.520]  because they'd gotten such a bad name why did dinecore change its name for a while
[2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:15.440]  why has haliburton done that uh and moved offshore why has uh or created do some city areas why did
[2:46:17.360 --> 2:46:22.560]  black water change its name i mean it's real simple it's all about labeling but it's the same
[2:46:22.560 --> 2:46:29.360]  group there are less than 200 globalists that sit on the belterberg trilateral commission cfr head
[2:46:29.360 --> 2:46:37.120]  seats who all sit on the fortune 100 and all they do is fly around from city to city from resort to
[2:46:37.120 --> 2:46:43.200]  resort meeting and coming up with plans and having professors come in and white papers they financed
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:49.280]  and google giant tracking crystal ball systems that predict the future for them to a certain extent
[2:46:49.280 --> 2:46:54.720]  to try to gauge all of this but all of their super technology isn't going to work once you're aware of
[2:46:54.720 --> 2:47:05.600]  them and and and again they're like most stolons or hitlers or vladian paler or any of these crazies
[2:47:05.600 --> 2:47:13.200]  and in they get on power trips they like to kill people that's the aberrant kind of societal cancer
[2:47:13.200 --> 2:47:17.520]  that gets into power and we've got a case of this right now and let me tell you it's only
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:21.520]  going to get worse as long as they're on the driver's seat and they're going to try to create
[2:47:21.520 --> 2:47:24.960]  bait and switches and put new people in the driver's seat but going in the same direction
[2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:29.920]  that worked for them and that's what mit romney and these guys are and rick perry they are from
[2:47:29.920 --> 2:47:38.480]  the very same group putting on our uniforms now of liberty to try to fool us it's very elementary
[2:47:42.320 --> 2:47:48.320]  and these guys are not with us they put on our uniforms here's the dossiers on them that they
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:53.440]  work for the other team and if you are so conned by their uniform oh but i like their black hair
[2:47:53.440 --> 2:47:58.080]  in the uniform they look politically sharp in it i hate obama i'm going to bind a rick perry mit romney
[2:47:58.080 --> 2:48:03.600]  and you turn your back and they stab you right in the back it's not even because they're traders
[2:48:03.600 --> 2:48:11.760]  they were brought up to destroy us their dominators their criminals they enjoy it they sit around and
[2:48:11.760 --> 2:48:18.560]  laugh at you they like bondage they are psychopaths and their rulers are psychopaths their bosses are
[2:48:18.560 --> 2:48:26.560]  they like it you like healthy happy successful people they don't like that get it through your head
[2:48:26.560 --> 2:48:32.000]  they like black uniforms and stomping on your face and they hire people that like that and good people
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:40.160]  have got to get geared up to devastate the enemy in the info war devastate them we can defeat them
[2:48:40.160 --> 2:48:46.080]  so easily we've got the power we've got the will we've got the information but you have got to start
[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:51.440]  seeing yourselves as leaders right now there's nothing more frustrating than knowing we can
[2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:57.600]  devastate the enemy we can devastate them 110 percent every time we take the field but you
[2:48:57.600 --> 2:49:01.200]  got to be willing to take the sacrifice not all of us are going to make it through this
[2:49:01.200 --> 2:49:08.960]  politically financially or physically i don't care commit a guy in germany hung up i was about
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:15.920]  to go to him um let's go ahead and talk to he will never get back in the color from germany but
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:19.760]  let's talk to keith in north carolina we already talked to keith or there's another
[2:49:19.760 --> 2:49:24.960]  car from north carolina okay go ahead keith can you hear me alec yes sir sorry i'm ranting
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:30.080]  uh it's great to get on finally here uh just wanted to make a little comment on what you said
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:36.480]  earlier about uh quitting and running off i uh i know you're just joking but i mean it's sad when
[2:49:36.480 --> 2:49:40.480]  you know about uh randy weaver and what happened to him when he tried to do that yeah they're not
[2:49:40.480 --> 2:49:45.360]  going to let you run off they tell local cops somebody flies american flag do you want to be left
[2:49:45.360 --> 2:49:51.440]  alone they're the enemy exactly um well i got kind of some uh a couple things i want to make
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:56.880]  comments on they're kind of broad sweeping issues um i've been in the army as an intelligence
[2:49:56.880 --> 2:50:01.680]  analyst for about three years now i'd like to say i've been awake for about two years and i've been
[2:50:01.680 --> 2:50:08.160]  a listener of your show for about a year now and i need to bring the attention uh program in the
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:13.360]  army and it works in all the services this is really for the service members here i submitted
[2:50:13.360 --> 2:50:18.720]  my paperwork for conscientious objection a couple months ago i kind of see it as i need to be on
[2:50:18.720 --> 2:50:24.080]  the right side of this thing when they start taking guns away if you know what i mean uh i think
[2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:30.000]  most people in the service don't even know this program exists and nobody here did until i submit
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:34.400]  to the paperwork so i think if some of people need to take into consideration if they fall into that
[2:50:34.400 --> 2:50:40.080]  category you know what stay there you know what skip this break i know the outro is already going
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:44.720]  but i got to hit some financial news too let's just dump that network break net stations should
[2:50:44.720 --> 2:50:50.800]  not cut play over this uh in case your listeners out there this this is a network break uh now
[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:55.360]  now for folks you know obviously you're not going to violate the national security letters
[2:50:55.360 --> 2:51:00.320]  but what do you make of the admission that the federal reserve has the army spying on ron paul
[2:51:00.320 --> 2:51:06.000]  and ron paul rally's including rally's i've been at in dallas and houston and that they now are
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:11.920]  taking a list of names of americans that criticize them that is confirmed what do you make of that a
[2:51:11.920 --> 2:51:17.840]  and b what would make you say that you have to be become a conscientious objector because of gun
[2:51:17.840 --> 2:51:24.880]  confiscation coming up are you are you getting that intelligence uh well alex i mean uh a lot of
[2:51:24.880 --> 2:51:30.400]  people in the army aren't as involved in the intelligence community as you may think so i
[2:51:30.400 --> 2:51:36.480]  wouldn't say it's the army so much that's collecting on ron paul that's more of like a fb i cia level
[2:51:36.480 --> 2:51:41.760]  thing uh the army the thing about the gun confiscation is the tab before it happened to katrina
[2:51:42.400 --> 2:51:47.440]  you had army walking the streets and taking guns in fact the 82nd was down there i am part of the
[2:51:47.440 --> 2:51:54.800]  82nd i wasn't around for that but uh i'm not informed when i joined the thing is is that uh
[2:51:54.800 --> 2:51:59.200]  now but you're saying you're in an intelligence unit and in case you missed it sir it's in paul
[2:51:59.200 --> 2:52:05.280]  watson's article today on this the army that's what i'm telling you the army has been dispatched for
[2:52:05.280 --> 2:52:11.760]  three and a half years that we know of and and is they do use army national guard intelligence
[2:52:11.760 --> 2:52:19.520]  to watch in the fetters uh that is confirmed okay alex uh the thing is it's very compartmentalized
[2:52:19.520 --> 2:52:23.680]  the most you see uh coming from that directly in other parts of the armies you'll see just uh
[2:52:23.680 --> 2:52:29.280]  uh advanced uh different training you'll see training shift from uh looking at things in
[2:52:29.280 --> 2:52:36.480]  afghanistan and iraq to all the summer looking at things in the area so it's always very obscure
[2:52:36.480 --> 2:52:41.840]  when it comes down it's sure you're collecting data for the brain bugs above you that assemble it
[2:52:43.440 --> 2:52:50.000]  i mean in a way yes but in a way a lot of times it's very obscure so it's kind of like uh if big
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:54.880]  army wants to put a lot of feelers it might get a little something back from here and there so
[2:52:54.880 --> 2:53:02.080]  nothing i couldn't really elaborate on that so much even if i did see something but uh it's not
[2:53:02.080 --> 2:53:06.400]  it's not really what a lot of people think when they think of army intelligence uh the army
[2:53:06.400 --> 2:53:12.240]  intelligence for the most part doesn't go out and and do that sort of work um it's played up a lot
[2:53:12.800 --> 2:53:19.920]  so well no army intelligence is mainly meant to spy on in the federalis to create an intelligence
[2:53:19.920 --> 2:53:25.920]  the idea that it's dirty that that the ron paul is so evil that the army has to go out and collect
[2:53:25.920 --> 2:53:33.600]  data on him you know it's basically war gaming that this is your enemy i understand that and uh
[2:53:33.600 --> 2:53:38.640]  and of course of course uh they're they're ramping up things to deal with domestic terrorism the
[2:53:38.640 --> 2:53:44.080]  white terrorist all this but those things don't reach far out of the local place where they're
[2:53:44.080 --> 2:53:50.320]  happening uh there at that time like i said i wouldn't know much about that uh as far away as
[2:53:50.320 --> 2:53:54.720]  i am from that event no i understand they deliver the propaganda right down to the local specific
[2:53:54.720 --> 2:54:00.160]  area to create the delusion uh there as it's uh repeated around in a game of telephone
[2:54:00.160 --> 2:54:04.480]  yes the conscientious objection thing instead of just going a wall or not following orders you
[2:54:04.480 --> 2:54:08.800]  just conscientious object and they pretty much have to let you out are they have hearings correct
[2:54:08.800 --> 2:54:13.840]  it it is about hearings there's two interviews and the hearing there's a interview with the
[2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:19.520]  chaplain there's an interview with a uh psychiatrist and then you have a hearing with an investigative
[2:54:19.520 --> 2:54:25.360]  officer now it's it's a heck of a process alex and you know i've had to do lots of paperwork
[2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:30.800]  i've uh you know i had to write a seven page essay i'd have reference letters but it seems
[2:54:30.800 --> 2:54:35.280]  like it's going well for me i've done very well with my uh chaplain well what about launching
[2:54:35.280 --> 2:54:41.040]  the libya war without congressional approval i mean right there right there i mean the the
[2:54:41.040 --> 2:54:45.920]  military should have refused to do that it was illegal i gotta jump i appreciate your call
[2:54:45.920 --> 2:54:52.720]  i mean it's illegal and if you'll follow that illegal order what's next i mean bush those wars
[2:54:52.720 --> 2:54:59.200]  were bad but he went and got got congressional approval obama said i don't need congress even
[2:54:59.200 --> 2:55:03.920]  when congress said something folks that's a big deal look at the super congress over the spending
[2:55:03.920 --> 2:55:10.080]  bills now that's totally unconstitutional see the bottom is dropping out folks once you let
[2:55:10.080 --> 2:55:14.960]  them run over the bill of rights and constitution and break the law the sky's the stinking limit
[2:55:14.960 --> 2:55:21.120]  and none of us are safe remember that corruption's cutesy for a while till you reach this point it
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:28.160]  isn't so cutesy now all right you know what i'm having to get ted anerson up uh tomorrow but i'm
[2:55:28.160 --> 2:55:31.920]  going to bring him up now for and we'll do five minutes overdrive and i i got to a lot of the
[2:55:31.920 --> 2:55:36.240]  news i didn't get to some of it but i'll be back tonight seven o'clock central please join us
[2:55:36.240 --> 2:55:40.080]  we'll put a lot of time and energy into this and it's it could be it is a devastating attack on the
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:44.960]  globalist but it'll be guaranteed to be more devastating if you get the word out support
[2:55:44.960 --> 2:55:52.240]  prison planet dot tv i wanted to bring uh ted anerson up here because we've seen gold and silver
[2:55:52.240 --> 2:55:58.560]  plunging in the last week uh and they raise margins in asia as well as here to where basically they've
[2:55:58.560 --> 2:56:03.840]  knocked all speculation out of it uh so that speculation will go back into currencies in
[2:56:03.840 --> 2:56:08.400]  that manipulation but the market fundamentals and now gold and silver have started to spike back up
[2:56:08.400 --> 2:56:13.600]  now gold and silver though the fundamentals are there's global devaluation so they can pull these
[2:56:13.600 --> 2:56:19.280]  games uh but long term market fundamentals are it's only going to go up because the dollar's
[2:56:19.280 --> 2:56:24.640]  being devalued ted briefly a breakdown what's happening right now well like you said the cme is
[2:56:24.640 --> 2:56:30.160]  raising its margin requirements that happen in asia i mean the global governments are doing
[2:56:30.160 --> 2:56:34.560]  everything they can throwing their kitchen sink against this thing to try to make gold and silver
[2:56:34.560 --> 2:56:41.280]  come down and they're having some success here just at the moment but i like that analogy where you
[2:56:41.280 --> 2:56:46.560]  say it's like holding a beach ball underwater there is absolutely no way with the kind of world
[2:56:46.560 --> 2:56:51.520]  crises that we're dealing with i mean you listen to what's going on well why is gold going down
[2:56:51.520 --> 2:56:57.120]  read bloomberg they're saying it's because there's a crisis going on in europe right now and therefore
[2:56:57.120 --> 2:57:02.000]  everything's getting sold off and gold is a part of it yeah this is part of the depressionary black
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:06.960]  hole but on the other side of it gold and silver will be sitting the best of any commodity it's
[2:57:06.960 --> 2:57:12.960]  exactly right alex and they're making it so much you know cost so much less which is just exactly
[2:57:12.960 --> 2:57:18.240]  what people need they need this break this is the time that people can actually get in before this
[2:57:18.240 --> 2:57:22.720]  thing completely yeah we've seen gold bounce back up some today but especially silver it went way
[2:57:22.720 --> 2:57:28.960]  down had a big rebound yeah it did i mean silver hit a low of 2788 and then up again well over 30
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:36.000]  dollars an ounce i mean right now walking liberty haves for example are trading right now at 1565
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:43.360]  they were 20 bucks here just a week ago i mean the the bags of survival dimes are a great buy at
[2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:49.280]  this time just 20 dollar gold pieces or you know chad you know when i buy i buy when it dips like
[2:57:49.280 --> 2:57:54.400]  this that's when you buy but folks will be buying it in a few weeks when it goes back up when you're
[2:57:54.400 --> 2:57:58.480]  selling at the low price then i mean i really do believe in gold and silver and the fundamentals
[2:57:58.480 --> 2:58:04.000]  and i've never sold the silver i bought at five dollars or the gold i bought at 265 dollars and
[2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:10.880]  i won't be selling now i'll be buying 800 686 2237 give might as resources a call how much is the

[2:59:49.360 --> 2:59:59.760]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[2:59:59.760 --> 3:00:21.600]  all right we're back with ted anderson ted what do you make of the federal reserve putting out
[3:00:21.600 --> 3:00:26.640]  the announcement that they're going to start spying on anybody and everybody that talks
[3:00:26.640 --> 3:00:31.520]  about them in the blogosphere because they're hemorrhaging all support uh what do you make of
[3:00:31.520 --> 3:00:39.520]  that well you know that is what that is is it's just a indication as to how much control that
[3:00:39.520 --> 3:00:44.960]  they think that they have and and how much support is going away from them how much you know how
[3:00:44.960 --> 3:00:50.800]  many people are pushing back against them they're really frightened as to whether they'll lose power
[3:00:50.800 --> 3:00:57.920]  over the countries of the world you know they've had the world currency status for so long and now
[3:00:57.920 --> 3:01:03.280]  it's all falling apart on them and you know as they're crashing and burning they're doing what
[3:01:03.280 --> 3:01:09.040]  they can to try to push and prod a lot of that's why the swiss lowered their currency a few weeks
[3:01:09.040 --> 3:01:14.080]  ago this is all an attempt to prop up the global currencies and we've seen them do this to golden
[3:01:14.080 --> 3:01:20.240]  silver before but it only retraces back because of the market fundamentals and that's why we've seen
[3:01:20.240 --> 3:01:27.040]  we have seen talk though of trying to restrict gold trading ted and that is a way the system could try
[3:01:27.760 --> 3:01:33.360]  artificially hold it down that's one of the few tricks they have left in their bag why and at
[3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:39.200]  this time when gold was already correcting would they raise the reserve requirements at the cme
[3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:44.560]  in the far east and by the way why are they raising it in another country it if the united
[3:01:44.560 --> 3:01:49.280]  states federal reserve system wants to manipulate the marketplace you think they'd only have the
[3:01:49.280 --> 3:01:54.880]  ability to manipulate here in the united states obviously this new world order world government
[3:01:54.880 --> 3:02:00.400]  thing is for real because it's happening across the globe and i can tell you what they're doing
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:06.240]  is they're fighting for control they have a window of opportunity here where gold and silver started
[3:02:06.240 --> 3:02:11.520]  to correct and they want to push it down further so they're doing what they can and raising reserve
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:17.920]  requirements uh up past 21 percent in order to do a trade in the futures market doubles the amount
[3:02:17.920 --> 3:02:22.640]  of money it takes in order to hold the same position and so that's why you're seeing the correction
[3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:28.560]  right now but you hit the nail right on the head elix you can only manipulate the market for so long
[3:02:28.560 --> 3:02:35.520]  and then the real market the free market will will prevail and what we're seeing right now going on
[3:02:35.520 --> 3:02:40.720]  uh the meltdown in europe and the meltdown of course in the united states and and everywhere
[3:02:40.720 --> 3:02:46.640]  across the globe it we're going to see gold and silver return and that's why i say this is one of
[3:02:46.640 --> 3:02:52.640]  those opportunities it's exactly what the people need they need to be able to buy gold and silver
[3:02:52.640 --> 3:02:57.600]  and they need to be able to get more for their money and this is what we want i mean seriously
[3:02:57.600 --> 3:03:01.680]  they're in there trying to push down this beach ball under the water guess what when it comes
[3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:05.840]  raging back it's going to be like a stretched out rubber band and it's going to fling back
[3:03:05.840 --> 3:03:10.080]  that much more in the other direction well that's what i was going to say ted is that
[3:03:11.040 --> 3:03:14.560]  even if they come in and we've seen some talk about this now even in the mainstream
[3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:19.360]  poor news even if they come in and try to ban gold trading or something like they've done before
[3:03:19.360 --> 3:03:24.800]  always two or three years later when they take the restrictions off it skyrockets above what it
[3:03:24.800 --> 3:03:29.840]  did before then so the and people say well they'll come confiscated at a certain point you got to
[3:03:29.840 --> 3:03:34.080]  stop letting your criminals come and say give me your kids you got to say no government comes
[3:03:34.080 --> 3:03:38.080]  says i'm going to take your blood at a checkpoint you got to say no i mean nazi say we're taking
[3:03:38.080 --> 3:03:43.600]  you to a death camp you got to say no at a certain point you got to start saying no at least they
[3:03:43.600 --> 3:03:48.000]  have to show up at your door to confiscate your wealth if you have gold and silver if you have
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:52.400]  their paper currency all they have to do is turn on the printing press and they're taking that's
[3:03:52.400 --> 3:03:58.000]  right they're already stealing your dollar value and your euro value so that's why and you're yet
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:03.520]  in your yon value so that's why they're coming in and trying to knock out gold and silver because
[3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:10.160]  it's an alternative competing real currency so they're waging all out war against it and i expected
[3:04:10.160 --> 3:04:15.040]  this to happen earlier but i saw jp morgan say it was going to go to 2500 by christmas i saw all of
[3:04:15.040 --> 3:04:21.120]  this and thought well okay i guess so but as europe melts down they just can't let gold and silver
[3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:25.680]  do this and what's weird is they've done this as you know three or four times the last three years
[3:04:25.680 --> 3:04:31.840]  ted and so even as it goes back up as it has in the past i would expect it is people will still
[3:04:31.840 --> 3:04:37.040]  say well but you saw it go down that time well i can tell you right now elix this is a little bit
[3:04:37.040 --> 3:04:41.920]  different because we have a lot of people interested in buying right now it's really refreshing
[3:04:41.920 --> 3:04:45.600]  to see people getting involved when the market is lower like that yeah that's what i'm hearing from
[3:04:45.600 --> 3:04:50.320]  bob Chapman and others is that people really now get it they understand the fundamentals will folks
[3:04:50.320 --> 3:04:55.840]  get old and silver while it's lower right now the best place patreon and operated minus resources
[3:04:55.840 --> 3:05:07.920]  800 686 2237 dead thank you so much
