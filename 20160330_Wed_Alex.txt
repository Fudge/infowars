[00:00.000 --> 00:12.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.320 --> 00:29.680]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:29.680 --> 00:38.840]  ladies and gentlemen it is 330 it is the third month the 30th day of 2016 on this
[00:38.840 --> 00:45.320]  March 30th 2016 global transmission now the consummate Trump insider Roger Stone
[00:45.320 --> 00:50.400]  continues to give us the big scoops that nobody else is getting concerning
[00:50.400 --> 00:55.480]  election 2016 he continues to call it before it happens now about a week ago
[00:55.480 --> 00:58.800]  he said I got huge news for you on Monday but he couldn't release it all on
[00:58.800 --> 01:04.400]  Monday he is gonna release it today in the second hour and he told me some of
[01:04.400 --> 01:08.600]  the inside baseball that I can't repeat and boy I wish I could just so I can have
[01:08.600 --> 01:12.480]  understanding of what's going on that's the fun part about being on air 21
[01:12.480 --> 01:18.000]  years and never blowing people's cover or never exposing a source or never
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.360]  burning somebody when they give you something in confidence but man the
[01:22.360 --> 01:27.600]  stuff going on behind the scenes is crazy and I'm gonna stop right there so
[01:27.600 --> 01:32.040]  that he goes over what he wants to cover coming up for 45 minutes or so of the
[01:32.040 --> 01:36.880]  second hour he'll be almost about 45 minutes of the second hour now you
[01:36.880 --> 01:41.520]  notice that Trump's getting new campaign people he's getting the top expert
[01:41.520 --> 01:47.760]  that's former business partners with Roger Stone who in 76 in 1980 was there
[01:47.760 --> 01:51.720]  with the attempts at broker conventions and stopped Ronald Reagan for basically
[01:51.720 --> 01:54.960]  having the nomination completely stolen from him that was in the New York Times
[01:54.960 --> 01:58.400]  yesterday in fact you guys print me that article I sent you an eco thanking
[01:58.400 --> 02:01.400]  yesterday because I need to be able to go over that obviously when Stone joins
[02:01.400 --> 02:06.640]  us it deals with that it deals with how we're gonna stop the steal from Trump
[02:06.640 --> 02:11.360]  it deals with what's happening with Hillary and Bernie Sanders in fact
[02:11.360 --> 02:18.400]  let's look at drudgerport.com right now New York Daily News paper it's rigged
[02:18.400 --> 02:23.480]  for Hillary now look we know that you know that you're like Alex you told us
[02:23.480 --> 02:27.800]  this eight months ago most of us already knew it but Bernie won't even come out
[02:27.800 --> 02:32.400]  and say he's being robbed when he was robbed in New Hampshire in other states
[02:32.400 --> 02:36.880]  he'd get 20 plus points more they take the delegates that's still ongoing he
[02:36.880 --> 02:39.920]  just won three states last week or so they're gonna take those delegates when
[02:39.920 --> 02:45.080]  he says he'll fight for him the LA Times says he's stealing it that's how they
[02:45.080 --> 02:51.960]  operate but Donald Trump is fighting he is going to file a lawsuit dealing with
[02:51.960 --> 02:56.560]  Louisiana and other states where he won the states but it was given to Ted Cruz
[02:56.560 --> 03:01.280]  and the evidence is overwhelming he officially won Louisiana but it was
[03:01.280 --> 03:06.040]  given to Ted Cruz more of the delegates and he the evidence is overwhelming
[03:06.040 --> 03:13.040]  won Texas and that was stolen as well one Ohio many other states stolen stolen
[03:13.040 --> 03:19.920]  stolen but for the first time ever this is cut and dry we have them we have them

[05:01.600 --> 05:07.640]  nuns to buy abortion insurance it should be a reminder of how absurd it is to
[05:07.640 --> 05:12.600]  trust our liberty to nine political appointees who believe the Constitution
[05:12.600 --> 05:17.840]  can be amended by their opinions NBC News reports that a quarter of Republican
[05:17.840 --> 05:21.920]  senators now want to meet with Obama's Supreme Court nominee much has been
[05:21.920 --> 05:25.800]  said about Obama's nominee Merrick Garland's record opposing the Second
[05:25.800 --> 05:29.400]  Amendment what hasn't been talked about is his long record of rubber stamping
[05:29.400 --> 05:34.440]  any rule from any federal regulatory agency Garland will be a reliable ally
[05:34.440 --> 05:39.120]  of the real government the federal bureaucracies with Scalia's death the
[05:39.120 --> 05:43.140]  Supreme Court is expected to be deadlocked on Obama's EPA regulations to
[05:43.140 --> 05:47.560]  shut down the coal industry the lower court on which Garland now serves will
[05:47.560 --> 05:52.200]  have the final say he will take Scalia's place on this important issue
[05:52.200 --> 05:56.560]  regardless of whether he takes Scalia's place on the court for info wars.com

[08:09.880 --> 08:15.960]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the
[08:15.960 --> 08:26.680]  GCN radio network I was talking to Roger Stone last night I was talking to him
[08:26.680 --> 08:31.680]  this morning Trump insider Trump confidant about the inside baseball going
[08:31.680 --> 08:36.640]  on and he's gonna reveal the most he's ever basically brought out today in the
[08:36.640 --> 08:41.640]  second hour you do not want to miss it but here is some of what's gonna come
[08:41.640 --> 08:47.800]  out the steel is already on the steel is already taking place and it's going to
[08:47.800 --> 08:52.360]  be nakedly done against Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump but with Donald Trump
[08:52.360 --> 08:58.320]  it's gonna be done when he has double the delegates of Ted Cruz it is going to
[08:58.320 --> 09:05.400]  be the most out of the open brazen arrogant in your face over the top
[09:05.400 --> 09:10.760]  bully sitting on your chest spitting in your face punching in the nose that it's
[09:10.760 --> 09:16.640]  ever been done I use the word naked not because I don't have a lot of words it's
[09:16.640 --> 09:25.120]  just it's it's the most descriptive they are uncloked out in the open unabashed
[09:25.120 --> 09:31.240]  stealing the popular vote in our face and that is canceling the election like
[09:31.240 --> 09:36.720]  we were a third world dictatorship but they do it with lawyer window dressing
[09:36.720 --> 09:41.120]  but that's not always gonna be breaking down a plan to fight back against it
[09:41.120 --> 09:45.360]  you're going to be involved if you choose to accept this mission I'm gonna
[09:45.360 --> 09:50.760]  be heavily involved and this is gonna be a event long-remembered coming up in
[09:50.760 --> 09:57.000]  Ohio here pretty quick with the RNC so get ready info wars the stone zone is
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.840]  gonna be front and center putting out the messages there to folks that choose
[10:02.840 --> 10:06.920]  to respond and don't wait for orders from headquarters this is the quote from
[10:06.920 --> 10:13.440]  stone quoting Pat Buchanan don't wait for orders from headquarters go to the
[10:13.440 --> 10:18.200]  sound of the guns he's also gonna break down what's happening inside the Trump
[10:18.200 --> 10:23.600]  campaign to a certain extent I got a lot of the info and it's very interesting to
[10:23.600 --> 10:27.080]  know so that I can understand what's going on behind the scenes that's the
[10:27.080 --> 10:33.280]  reason I've been given obviously the full scoop because I can be trusted can
[10:33.280 --> 10:36.480]  you imagine what the New York Times would do with this type of information
[10:36.480 --> 10:43.680]  or the Washington Post or MSNBC that's why traitor filth scum won't be getting
[10:43.680 --> 10:48.640]  it the information shared with me so that we can better defeat the globalist
[10:48.640 --> 10:53.840]  not just so I have it like I like I have some rare stamp in my stamp
[10:53.840 --> 11:02.080]  collection for my ego but it is definitely a full-on war for this
[11:02.080 --> 11:09.720]  country going on right now that said we're gonna be breaking down Donald
[11:09.720 --> 11:14.760]  Trump hires Paul Manafort to lead delegate effort you read the New York
[11:14.760 --> 11:23.360]  Times article it says longtime partner of Roger Stone and Paul Manafort is gonna
[11:23.360 --> 11:26.520]  be running a lot more than just the delegate process because it's going on
[11:26.520 --> 11:31.480]  at every state level it's already being stolen lawsuits are about to be filed by
[11:31.480 --> 11:37.520]  next week and let's just say that one campaign manager has been arrested and
[11:37.520 --> 11:42.160]  there is now basically shadow folks coming in to actually try to supercharge
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.000]  the campaign and really give Trump the support he needs I'm not bashing some of
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.520]  the previous people involved but Paul Watson has an excellent report that I'm
[11:50.520 --> 11:56.480]  just gonna paraphrase here on radio because it's a video where Trump's
[11:56.480 --> 12:03.240]  chief of staff Trump's campaign manager has been caught lying he did grab her by
[12:03.240 --> 12:09.280]  the arm she is lying saying he grabbed her hard pushed her down scared her it's
[12:09.280 --> 12:15.160]  total hoax total bull but he said he didn't touch her and in both videos he
[12:15.160 --> 12:18.720]  does touch her and pull her away from Trump because Trump was grabbed it's on
[12:18.720 --> 12:23.000]  the video twice by her she grabbed him and said what about affirmative action
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.120]  twice he pulled her away it's what a security person is supposed to do now
[12:27.120 --> 12:37.360]  in fairness to Trump's current campaign manager in fairness to him how do you even
[12:37.360 --> 12:40.240]  know when you've got thousands of people grabbing at Trump a day and you're
[12:40.240 --> 12:45.720]  pushing him away that he even remember who she was but this is just classic
[12:45.720 --> 12:51.240]  garbage and that's what's going on but the good news is as he kind of recedes
[12:51.240 --> 12:54.840]  into the background even more effective people that have actually been involved
[12:54.840 --> 12:58.600]  in major conventions and that have actually delivered victory from attempted
[12:58.600 --> 13:05.800]  steals are now in place so that is very very exciting Stone eight months ago
[13:05.800 --> 13:09.480]  got off the campaign as the head of the Trump campaign voluntarily because he
[13:09.480 --> 13:13.120]  did not like the some of the people under him obviously and that they were
[13:13.120 --> 13:16.640]  bucking him and he said look I'm gonna do more for Trump outside of this
[13:16.640 --> 13:20.520]  organization than inside of it I'm gonna advise Trump every day so it's kind of
[13:20.520 --> 13:25.800]  like he has dual dual advisors and that's kind of a smart plan to have
[13:25.800 --> 13:29.320]  different you know ideas bouncing off each other but that's a big deal going
[13:29.320 --> 13:34.400]  on inside the campaign and I'm gonna stop right there I'm gonna stop right
[13:34.400 --> 13:38.200]  there and I'd say anymore and I'll just let stone say whatever he wants but it's
[13:38.200 --> 13:43.880]  big deal man I hate getting told all the good stuff and not being able to tell
[13:43.880 --> 13:52.480]  you let me just stop there's a big story up on info wars.com that I'm gonna be
[13:52.480 --> 13:56.280]  covering in the next segment in some detail and on Salazar's gonna be popping
[13:56.280 --> 13:59.760]  in the reporter that wrote the story about it breaking fast and furious with
[13:59.760 --> 14:05.680]  secret program to ship arms the Middle East terrorist that is now confirmed
[14:05.680 --> 14:09.400]  actually in the meat and potatoes of what's going on from our sources Adonis
[14:09.400 --> 14:13.640]  safe and says that evidence points towards it and then we have the big
[14:13.640 --> 14:17.720]  interview I did yesterday with the Lieutenant Colonel in the US Marine Corps
[14:17.720 --> 14:24.080]  former head of Guantanamo Bay and others that have the inside data with their
[14:24.080 --> 14:30.560]  sources on exactly what's going on it ongoing shipments to the Mexican drug
[14:30.560 --> 14:35.080]  cartels that are then trans shipped by aircraft to the Middle East Al Qaeda and
[14:35.080 --> 14:40.080]  ISIS so you have our report with Adon Salazar and then you have the report
[14:40.080 --> 14:46.200]  that the Hill newspaper would not publish by the Colonel and others that is
[14:46.200 --> 14:51.600]  published underneath it so it's two articles on one page did Brian Terry die
[14:51.600 --> 14:57.440]  in vain and we need to probably go ahead and point out there's also a
[14:57.440 --> 15:02.360]  co-author to this and just post this subsection as if it's a article in and
[15:02.360 --> 15:06.800]  of itself a great job to Adon staying up last night late to get that done it was
[15:06.800 --> 15:11.480]  written by a oh here it is Andrew McKenna and Matthew Smith mecca that's
[15:11.480 --> 15:15.320]  Lieutenant Colonel and that guy's pedigree is amazing he got physically
[15:15.320 --> 15:19.360]  attacked a few months ago from behind and then told to shut up as they jumped
[15:19.360 --> 15:23.720]  in the sedan and drove away and that's the type of stuff going on with fast
[15:23.720 --> 15:28.080]  and furious that is ongoing where is the investigation where are the
[15:28.080 --> 15:32.720]  indictments we have to keep the heat on these people this is a big big deal
[15:32.720 --> 15:38.720]  it's coming up all right now let's get into the other news that's coming up
[15:38.720 --> 15:43.040]  again Trump in the next hour will be breaking that down in great detail and
[15:43.040 --> 15:46.520]  then I'm also going to break this down as I said I'd break it down yesterday I
[15:46.520 --> 15:56.400]  forgot to I only partially covered it and I want to really go into this in the
[15:56.400 --> 15:59.960]  third hour today and I'm going to do it because there's more stories that
[15:59.960 --> 16:04.640]  parallel it and just add to it today there's a story out of the Times of
[16:04.640 --> 16:09.800]  Israel Associated Press willingly cooperated with the Nazis new report
[16:09.800 --> 16:15.960]  shows here's another one top German journalist admits mainstream media is
[16:15.960 --> 16:21.600]  completely fake we all live for the CIA that's major German newspapers this is a
[16:21.600 --> 16:30.120]  London telegraph China newspaper editor resigns over media control newspapers
[16:30.120 --> 16:34.800]  gobble each other up to survive a digital apocalypse Bloomberg and the
[16:34.800 --> 16:41.680]  problem is people like Carlos Slim the mafia Don in my opinion over Mexico you
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.120]  know he's taken it over the New York Times and so all these different
[16:45.120 --> 16:48.840]  billionaires like Soros the Nazi collaborator the rest of them they all
[16:48.840 --> 16:54.360]  own newspapers and publications and the Huffington Post as their little
[16:54.360 --> 16:59.560]  private organ of disinformation so they're lost leaders they lose money but
[16:59.560 --> 17:06.600]  they use them as weaponized garbage pushers against patriots worldwide so
[17:06.600 --> 17:11.280]  they're vestigial they're ceremonial MSNBC loses money CNN loses money they're
[17:11.280 --> 17:15.320]  jokes they're pure political hacks just to spew disinformation into the
[17:15.320 --> 17:22.440]  stratosphere but the good news is this is all starting to come out in a big big
[17:22.440 --> 17:29.640]  way but as I said the US government got behind the Bund movement in the United
[17:29.640 --> 17:35.120]  States they tried to get Smedley Butler to lead 500,000 men there's
[17:35.120 --> 17:41.680]  congressional hearings I mean there's there's footage of this on what is it
[17:41.680 --> 17:45.680]  16 millimeter black-and-white film we actually got the archives it's in my
[17:45.680 --> 17:50.400]  film in game and they tried to overthrow the US in the 30s not the Nazis
[17:50.400 --> 17:57.280]  the Rockefellers and the Haramans funded Hitler he was under their command and it
[17:57.280 --> 18:00.920]  wasn't a German conspiracy it was a eugenics conspiracy and they tried to
[18:00.920 --> 18:04.320]  do it here but Smedley Butler double crossed them two-time congressional
[18:04.320 --> 18:09.360]  Medal of Honor winner and believe me he was a man out in the wilderness at first
[18:09.360 --> 18:12.400]  then World War two started and they shut the investigations down because they
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.040]  were too embarrassing because most the robber barons on the east coast were
[18:16.040 --> 18:21.480]  running it not part of it they were running Hitler my grandfather was in
[18:21.480 --> 18:25.120]  school in Dallas and it was mainly a German community that part of Dallas he
[18:25.120 --> 18:30.600]  was German almost completely German there was Hitler on the local radio
[18:30.600 --> 18:35.200]  English-speaking radio Hitler would come on at night and and everybody was
[18:35.200 --> 18:39.960]  supporting Hitler he his family wasn't supporting Hitler because there was a
[18:39.960 --> 18:43.480]  rich German lived in the neighborhood who was a famous inventor and who was
[18:43.480 --> 18:46.720]  German by the way wasn't Jewish and Hitler was already threatening to kill
[18:46.720 --> 18:52.680]  his family and take his money if he didn't give him give the Nazis all his
[18:52.680 --> 18:58.560]  money in the US and this guy was the inventor of major refrigeration and my
[18:58.560 --> 19:01.680]  grandfather was friends with him worked in his big warehouse tinkering
[19:01.680 --> 19:04.640]  facilities when my grandfather became an inventor is one reason my grandfather
[19:04.640 --> 19:08.200]  went and joined the Army Air Corps because he watched he hated the Nazis so
[19:08.200 --> 19:12.640]  so much folks because he watched him mess with the German community that's why I
[19:12.640 --> 19:16.840]  can tell you about the Germans in Texas being mess with by the Nazis and German
[19:16.840 --> 19:20.760]  infiltration and back and forth with the robber barons they were going to use
[19:20.760 --> 19:24.640]  German Americans as the muscle along with the Marine Corps of all things to
[19:24.640 --> 19:29.520]  take over well guess what you got your butt blown off we're gonna go to break
[19:29.520 --> 19:34.080]  here in a moment it's just that they've always known the AP worked with the
[19:34.080 --> 19:38.760]  Nazis the Rockefellers all of them did but again it's not a German conspiracy
[19:38.760 --> 19:43.520]  it's a Rockefeller British crown eugenics conspiracy all detailed in
[19:43.520 --> 19:48.120]  in-game blueprint for global enslavement we're going to break stay with us from

[24:24.800 --> 24:28.720]  Apple's new challenge learning how the US cracked its iPhone New York Times I
[24:28.720 --> 24:36.920]  love how the media makes news by buying into the FBI's disinfo I've read in tech
[24:36.920 --> 24:40.520]  magazines for years and hear about it all the time that they can crack into
[24:40.520 --> 24:45.040]  iPads iPhones they don't try to get in through the front interface that's
[24:45.040 --> 24:52.040]  uncrackable basically they get in by getting in the little hard drive or
[24:52.040 --> 24:57.640]  solid-state system inside or through the apps there's a whole bunch of ways to
[24:57.640 --> 25:02.520]  get into it and again I'm not a tech guy I read the tech journals and I told you
[25:02.520 --> 25:06.200]  months ago I said they've got the back door over and over again this is pure
[25:06.200 --> 25:11.080]  bull they want a built-in encryption key that's quicker but they can get into
[25:11.080 --> 25:16.040]  these in an hour two hours three hours if it's an old version pretty fast might
[25:16.040 --> 25:21.520]  take them a day it's a hassle for them it's kind of like a steel door on a house
[25:21.520 --> 25:26.400]  it takes a battering ram to take it down and we were proven right again proven
[25:26.400 --> 25:31.000]  right again by the way we first broke here four years ago with Tosh Plumlee who
[25:31.000 --> 25:37.480]  got threatened by the Justice Department after he came on just saying and then
[25:37.480 --> 25:41.640]  got attacked by John McCain on national news for saying we're backing al-Qaeda in
[25:41.640 --> 25:45.240]  Syria we're giving them weapons from Benghazi it's all turned out to be true
[25:45.240 --> 25:49.720]  and then of course crazy McCain called Tosh Plumlee a nut even though he's a
[25:49.720 --> 25:53.960]  famous whistleblower who was still in the CIA until three and a half years ago
[25:53.960 --> 25:58.320]  when he resigned as a contractor of 40-plus years to be able to come on the
[25:58.320 --> 26:02.440]  show he retired to be able to come on and talk about it and he said I don't care
[26:02.440 --> 26:06.960]  if it's classified it's illegal to give ISIS and al-Qaeda weapons before it was
[26:06.960 --> 26:12.800]  called ISIS so he came on he let it all out and then we had a lieutenant colonel
[26:12.800 --> 26:17.600]  from the Marine Corps recently retired on who's been physically attacked you
[26:17.600 --> 26:22.640]  name it threatened because a base he was over he learned was conduiting weapons
[26:22.640 --> 26:30.000]  into Mexico and is currently doing it the base he was over this guy formerly
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.520]  headed up Guantanamo Bay that's high-level folks that in the pencil
[26:35.520 --> 26:40.120]  pusher okay imagine what he knows he can't tell us because it's classified he
[26:40.120 --> 26:47.520]  was on with us the interviews on info wars.com with Brian Terry's brother so
[26:47.520 --> 26:53.520]  this is a big deal breaking fast and furious was secret program to ship arms
[26:53.520 --> 26:57.080]  to Middle East terrorists investigation reveals arm shipments ongoing
[26:57.080 --> 27:02.280]  that's the key it's ongoing the military knows the ATF knows they don't want to be
[27:02.280 --> 27:07.880]  part of it remember you see El Chapo with 50 cows you name it they go through
[27:07.880 --> 27:13.120]  Mexico and then on the planes in to the Middle East because our own military
[27:13.120 --> 27:16.600]  won't be part of it they've been saying that for four years so they fence it
[27:16.600 --> 27:24.200]  through Mexico and have cartels do it and man those cartels are evil just when
[27:24.200 --> 27:27.840]  I think they can't go to a new low they're involved arming and of course
[27:27.840 --> 27:32.040]  you've seen the threats with El Chapo with ISIS when he's caught him getting
[27:32.040 --> 27:35.320]  his cocaine he's shipping cocaine in theirs too and they've been taking his
[27:35.320 --> 27:39.680]  cocaine he threatened them remember that about two months ago from jail your
[27:39.680 --> 27:44.160]  little boys I'm gonna kill you you don't know what terror is no I know what
[27:44.160 --> 27:47.760]  terror is El Chapo it's it's ISIS cutting little kids heads off and throwing
[27:47.760 --> 27:52.480]  priest-off buildings and murdering nuns and old folks homes shame on all of you
[27:52.480 --> 27:58.520]  let's go to Adon Salazar Adon powerful article you dovetail it with their
[27:58.520 --> 28:02.920]  their article that the Hill wouldn't publish we need to get this out amazing
[28:02.920 --> 28:07.160]  points that you have in there what do you want to impart to the audience I mean
[28:07.160 --> 28:10.880]  all I'm saying is we need to get this out to everybody right like you were
[28:10.880 --> 28:16.760]  saying yesterday we did have Lieutenant Colonel Matt Smith Mac on and really
[28:16.760 --> 28:21.160]  highly accredited investigator as he said he did work at Guantanamo Bay he
[28:21.160 --> 28:26.280]  was actually a tribunal member in charge of reviewing the detention of enemy
[28:26.280 --> 28:31.520]  combatants so he's he's as high up as you can prop probably go it's got a whole
[28:31.520 --> 28:34.600]  list of accreditation there well he was actually the head
[28:34.600 --> 28:39.080]  yesterday one time yeah I mean it's a big deal he's coming out with this and
[28:39.080 --> 28:44.000]  there's no media investigation with Kent Terry the brother of a slain border
[28:44.000 --> 28:50.080]  patrol agent Brian Terry he discovered that Brian Terry was about to go public
[28:50.080 --> 28:56.240]  with what he knew about fast and furious and that was the fact that or the
[28:56.240 --> 29:01.000]  possibility that it might be a cover for an international gun smuggling ring and
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.560]  he's the guy that began to expose it and got killed and the evidence is
[29:03.560 --> 29:07.160]  overwhelming they agree that he was probably murdered not as an accident but
[29:07.160 --> 29:11.200]  to cover up his investigation that's right and through the course of
[29:11.200 --> 29:20.320]  Lieutenant Smith Mac's investigation he's discovered that that Terry was
[29:20.320 --> 29:27.720]  ready to blow the whistle and he died 10 minutes into his last shift he had a
[29:27.720 --> 29:32.800]  premonitions he was telling his mother that he had bad feeling about going back
[29:32.800 --> 29:36.720]  out there and that he had met some bad agents and that he would told the agents
[29:36.720 --> 29:40.160]  that don't worry about me I'm not gonna do anything you know and sure enough they
[29:40.160 --> 29:44.600]  they came and got him that's right great job Adon your story is so important

[33:49.960 --> 33:56.200]  basically revamp the Trump campaign and stop the big steal that was in the New

[34:02.240 --> 34:09.000]  today and look the New York Daily News has it as well with their big cover
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.680]  story that is unfolding that the Democrats are announcing yes we're going
[34:13.680 --> 34:18.280]  to steal the delegates in New York City we can load that up on screen for folks
[34:18.280 --> 34:25.440]  and just give them to Hillary Clinton even though Sanders is set to win so
[34:25.440 --> 34:29.880]  this is the mainlining of stealing elections there's a story at drudge
[34:29.880 --> 34:37.400]  report calm crock the vote paper it's rigged for Hillary now look why do I
[34:37.400 --> 34:41.880]  keep banging on about this because we were telling you eight months ago it
[34:41.880 --> 34:45.200]  was coming we were telling you six months ago five months ago four months
[34:45.200 --> 34:49.280]  ago three months ago two months ago we know what we're talking about we were
[34:49.280 --> 34:53.840]  called conspiracy theorist and crazy people the Republican establishment was
[34:53.840 --> 34:57.800]  already putting out newsletters to interparty members that were leaking and
[34:57.800 --> 35:02.760]  and Roger Stone was going to meetings in New York where they were saying we're
[35:02.760 --> 35:06.440]  going to steal this from Donald Trump we're going to take this from Donald
[35:06.440 --> 35:09.560]  Trump we don't care if he has all the delegates we'll just appoint Paul Ryan
[35:09.560 --> 35:13.880]  he went and told Trump they're gonna steal it from you and Trump's like they
[35:13.880 --> 35:20.080]  wouldn't dare and then stone you notice leaves the campaign waits and then eight
[35:20.080 --> 35:23.960]  months later is getting very close to campaign again because Trump is seeing
[35:23.960 --> 35:27.560]  just how over the top this is and quite frankly Trump's a really smart guy but
[35:27.560 --> 35:32.240]  he couldn't even believe that they are this criminal this evil this out of
[35:32.240 --> 35:36.640]  control but here's the good news we're not going to be found flat-footed when
[35:36.640 --> 35:41.140]  all this comes down boys and girls and so listen very carefully to what we
[35:41.140 --> 35:44.520]  break down I know the general listeners do that you're smarter than we are on
[35:44.520 --> 35:48.720]  those cases you're our key reporters our tipsters our supporters you are
[35:48.720 --> 35:53.200]  everything but there are new listeners every day on AM and FM stations across
[35:53.200 --> 35:58.880]  the country over 170 affiliates on TV stations that pick up that the TV side
[35:58.880 --> 36:05.560]  of this transmission from from you know New York City to Houston Texas on UHF
[36:05.560 --> 36:11.160]  VHF cable you name it they take the show and air it once a week in LA on a big
[36:11.160 --> 36:15.320]  station I mean we're all over the place people take the show and put it on
[36:15.320 --> 36:19.360]  access locally I mean there's just all these ways we're getting out there and
[36:19.360 --> 36:23.640]  it's very very exciting we're on global satellites going on across much of the
[36:23.640 --> 36:28.440]  world and the truth is getting to the people but new listeners tune in and it
[36:28.440 --> 36:38.600]  sounds so wild that we had Dr. Wallach on two days ago and he was saying
[36:38.600 --> 36:42.920]  vegetarian diets give you cancer and kill you because they don't have the
[36:42.920 --> 36:47.240]  fats you need and your cells basically collapse and then statins eat holes
[36:47.240 --> 36:51.720]  through your brain even faster he was saying that 25 30 years ago guess what's
[36:51.720 --> 37:00.680]  in the London Telegraph today huge giant mega study long-term vegetarian diet
[37:00.680 --> 37:07.160]  changes human DNA raising risk of cancer and heart disease it's well known that
[37:07.160 --> 37:11.520]  people that eat vegetarian diets culturally are shriveled are weak are
[37:11.520 --> 37:19.920]  stupid are infertile and have small cc size braids everything we told you two
[37:19.920 --> 37:25.440]  days ago we told you 10 years ago and 20 years ago new big studies today we're
[37:25.440 --> 37:34.560]  not making it up folks we know what we're talking about we told you that 15
[37:34.560 --> 37:37.400]  years ago they announced it DARPA they're gonna start having to the new light
[37:37.400 --> 37:41.480]  bulbs digital information transferred to your computer whether you like it or
[37:41.480 --> 37:45.160]  not so the government or corporations can hack your house whenever they want
[37:45.160 --> 37:50.000]  and that the flicker rates will be used to control your mind it's in mainstream
[37:50.000 --> 37:55.200]  news today I'm gonna cover it mainstream big papers going the
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.400]  government's gonna help you through the light bulbs feel good that's body snatch
[37:59.400 --> 38:05.080]  your cult level I get why raw story and others made fun of us years ago talking
[38:05.080 --> 38:08.720]  about that it but wouldn't show our sources because it's fun to lie to the
[38:08.720 --> 38:18.280]  public and deceive them it's fun to prey on people when you're a scumbag so
[38:18.280 --> 38:21.160]  that's all coming up I've told you most of the mainstream media is run by the
[38:21.160 --> 38:24.800]  CIA that's in major German newspapers this week we're gonna go over all of it
[38:24.800 --> 38:30.560]  and again we're not bragging about how right we are we're just telling you that
[38:30.560 --> 38:34.600]  we have the answers you have the answers we know what's going on we can defeat
[38:34.600 --> 38:39.520]  the globalist we're not just gonna let them go steal the nomination you know
[38:39.520 --> 38:45.120]  hi-oh in Cleveland this year Bernie Sanders isn't just letting them steal
[38:45.120 --> 38:49.320]  the nomination from him and I don't like Bernie Sanders but doesn't matter he's
[38:49.320 --> 38:54.600]  winning the popular vote Hillary stealing it when he gets more delegates in
[38:54.600 --> 38:58.720]  all these states but she goes against the super delegates that they made up out
[38:58.720 --> 39:06.000]  of a hat that's not right when when Trump won two states and they admitted he
[39:06.000 --> 39:13.280]  won they gave him to Ted Cruz I mean are you really gonna put up with that so
[39:13.280 --> 39:19.000]  we're reaching that flashpoint moment right now where things are gonna get
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.120]  very very clear very very unclogged and you're gonna have to make a decision
[39:22.120 --> 39:31.200]  whether you're gonna roll over to this or not coming up Trump angst pours in
[39:31.200 --> 39:35.280]  from overseas the hill the whole world the communist leaders more of them say
[39:35.280 --> 39:39.680]  you can't having see this is all about America being bullied colonized through
[39:39.680 --> 39:44.800]  globalism by foreign money we are a colony now of a of a collection of
[39:44.800 --> 39:50.840]  smorgasbord of royal families and the Saudis and Chinese generals telling
[39:50.840 --> 39:56.600]  Hollywood movies they can't come out and telling them what to edit amazing
[39:56.600 --> 40:04.520]  GOP panelists eager to scrap rule that helps Trump Politico National Border
[40:04.520 --> 40:08.240]  Patrol Council that's how they spin it that if he gets the votes he gets to win
[40:08.240 --> 40:11.760]  they go oh it's a rule that helps Trump they're gonna get even harder the rules
[40:11.760 --> 40:15.280]  already a scam now they're gonna change to make it even harder and they spin it
[40:15.280 --> 40:20.040]  that it quote helps him like he did something it's like you know Dale
[40:20.040 --> 40:26.120]  Earnhardt wins the you know the the you know top NASCAR race and then they say
[40:26.120 --> 40:32.360]  oh it's this is crazy National Border Patrol Council endorses Trump for
[40:32.360 --> 40:37.360]  president Mexican film uses audio of Trump's speech overseen of illegal
[40:37.360 --> 40:41.080]  aliens being shot crossing border by evil gringos of course you know in the
[40:41.080 --> 40:44.560]  real world the hundred plus thousand Mexicans killed in Mexico were killed by
[40:44.560 --> 40:51.480]  Mexicans it's very hard to find more than five six seven Mexicans shot by
[40:51.480 --> 40:56.960]  crazy racist white people a year on the border it does happen but see a hundred
[40:56.960 --> 41:00.080]  thousand doesn't matter if it's a Mexican doing it but if it's some dumb
[41:00.080 --> 41:03.560]  hillbilly then it's a big deal they just make it up just like in just like a
[41:03.560 --> 41:06.800]  machete they got Don Johnson driving around with a spotlight shooting
[41:06.800 --> 41:14.400]  pregnant women blowing their babies out it's not real the Mexican drug cartels
[41:14.400 --> 41:18.480]  do that but it's okay let's just blame white people because it's so fun to be
[41:18.480 --> 41:22.680]  racist against them if Bernie Sanders wins New York Democratic Party some
[41:22.680 --> 41:25.280]  superdelegates vowed to back Hillary Clinton anyways again that's the big
[41:25.280 --> 41:31.800]  steal New York Daily News that's just some of what's coming up today but before
[41:31.800 --> 41:35.760]  I go any further into all of this I wanted to bring Antonin Goodshard again
[41:35.760 --> 41:39.480]  for the next eight nine minutes before we go to break with the most exciting
[41:39.480 --> 41:43.080]  announcement there's been a bunch of them in the history the three and a half
[41:43.080 --> 41:45.320]  year history was really four-year history as it took longer to get it

[41:59.120 --> 42:04.440]  still promote but I wanted and it's why it took us two years in the almost four
[42:04.440 --> 42:09.560]  years info wars life calm to come out with this and it from our research is
[42:09.560 --> 42:16.440]  the most affordable and is the highest quality and the most absorbable and is
[42:16.440 --> 42:22.880]  simply over-the-top amazing and its plant derived and ladies and gentlemen it
[42:22.880 --> 42:26.320]  took us two years there were all sorts of brands that let us private label
[42:26.320 --> 42:29.360]  immediately we didn't take the easy road even there's some great stuff out
[42:29.360 --> 42:37.040]  there we went and brought you concentrated it's got the amino acids the
[42:37.040 --> 42:41.000]  vitamins the minerals everything and it's something that my children we got
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.880]  the test batches over the last six months and we have a bunch of different
[42:43.880 --> 42:48.680]  flavors we said no we have the best flavor ever in fruit punch ladies and
[42:48.680 --> 42:54.280]  gentlemen Anthony Gucci arty this is the answer for your children to totally
[42:54.280 --> 42:58.120]  absorb the multivitamins the minerals the amino acids everything at once
[42:58.120 --> 43:03.840]  unveiled vitamin mineral fusion advanced multi vitamin formula 30 servings
[43:03.840 --> 43:11.200]  240 point sg fruit punch flavored dietary supplement it is simply amazing info
[43:11.200 --> 43:15.200]  wars life calm we have a limited run it won't have more in for a month at least
[43:15.200 --> 43:19.320]  this is a limited run and we are so excited about this Anthony you have the
[43:19.320 --> 43:23.840]  floor tell people about vitamin mineral fusion right now stuff is the real deal
[43:23.840 --> 43:27.080]  I think if people could see how many different containers we've got back
[43:27.080 --> 43:31.920]  there probably about 20 or 30 different renditions of this over two years and
[43:31.920 --> 43:35.560]  the reason for it is because there's a million different products like this out
[43:35.560 --> 43:39.920]  there that they're you know they're good in different ways but this takes all of
[43:39.920 --> 43:44.880]  the vitamins all the essential amino acids all the essential compounds and
[43:44.880 --> 43:49.800]  minerals that you need puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed
[43:49.800 --> 43:53.640]  to like clumpy gross stuff you can put it in drink every morning I put it in my
[43:53.640 --> 43:58.480]  protein shake it is the platinum standard in my view of multivitamins in
[43:58.480 --> 44:02.920]  terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin the cleanest the purest new stuff had to
[44:02.920 --> 44:05.800]  be invented that's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good
[44:05.800 --> 44:09.920]  look yeah we we're not going to get into the details of how some products are
[44:09.920 --> 44:17.520]  made but let me tell you okay let me tell you all right we've worked here with
[44:17.520 --> 44:21.160]  two of the leading manufacturers on this that we originally wanted to do this
[44:21.160 --> 44:25.120]  product with and they said sure we're just gonna do a process that we use with
[44:25.120 --> 44:29.160]  a lot of the big guys and it involves this this and this and I was like wait
[44:29.160 --> 44:34.240]  wait wait let's take a step back you did what to the product you did what to get
[44:34.240 --> 44:38.560]  it to that state no no way no thanks so we had to go and find our own custom
[44:38.560 --> 44:42.600]  formula and it took two years we had to find a manufacturer willing to do it it
[44:42.600 --> 44:47.040]  was it was a quest okay and the Anthony you really are a trailblazer thank you
[44:47.040 --> 44:51.640]  no I mean you spent so much time flew places went through hell to do this two
[44:51.640 --> 44:54.880]  years and we have it we have it and there's a lot of the great stuff out there
[44:54.880 --> 45:01.040]  this is just the best tasting super clean super natural it is amazing vitamin
[45:01.040 --> 45:05.480]  mineral fusion advanced multivitamin formulation and it's the same or more
[45:05.480 --> 45:09.000]  of the vitamins and minerals than some of the other brands that are out there
[45:09.000 --> 45:12.480]  where it's bigger containers it's concentrated exactly we could get into
[45:12.480 --> 45:15.720]  techniques for hours and hours but some companies are gonna there's no filler
[45:15.720 --> 45:20.320]  yeah some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it you
[45:20.320 --> 45:23.400]  know so there's so much filler it looks like there's a lot this is ultra
[45:23.400 --> 45:26.960]  concentrated we're not playing games here okay this is my philosophy that's
[45:26.960 --> 45:29.760]  your philosophy yeah this I want it but again there's some great stuff out there
[45:29.760 --> 45:32.880]  yeah and there's other you know it of course that's there's other powders I
[45:32.880 --> 45:36.120]  promote it in force helps out there excellent there's some good stuff out
[45:36.120 --> 45:40.560]  there this is just the very best we can bring you and when you buy it you support
[45:40.560 --> 45:45.080]  info wars you support the reporters you support yourself because quite frankly
[45:45.080 --> 45:48.440]  some of the other powders my kids get healthier on they're great they just
[45:48.440 --> 45:52.440]  don't why does this taste so good no exactly and this can be could taken in
[45:52.440 --> 45:55.360]  conjunction with other stuff not that there aren't other great products out
[45:55.360 --> 46:00.680]  there there certainly are but some big products I was just amazed what they
[46:00.680 --> 46:04.080]  were actually doing in the manufacturing process this goes above and beyond the
[46:04.080 --> 46:07.200]  stuff you don't see it's got to trust us take our word for it because you know
[46:07.200 --> 46:11.600]  the standard of quality that we do work with but this has pretty much in my view
[46:11.600 --> 46:14.600]  everything we don't want to be nasty and we're not gonna be nasty yes why
[46:14.600 --> 46:19.440]  frankly we sell more we did exactly and it tastes great and instead of maybe
[46:19.440 --> 46:24.200]  costing us pennies for for a container of this it costs an actually large amount
[46:24.200 --> 46:27.960]  the margins aren't the best on this one but instead you know we flew the places
[46:27.960 --> 46:31.720]  we went to the manufacturer no one is putting this much product in a container
[46:31.720 --> 46:35.360]  this size for this price yes in fact there's stuff a hundred bucks for
[46:35.360 --> 46:39.280]  something similar that isn't as good and today I got a handed to him and of
[46:39.280 --> 46:42.560]  course this is made by one of the biggest most successful you know healthy
[46:42.560 --> 46:46.240]  clean natural you know labs in the country and it's our exclusive formula
[46:46.240 --> 46:49.800]  no one else can copy this it is a proprietary manufacturing process it's
[46:49.800 --> 46:54.480]  a unique delivery system the powder is done in such a way that it's a proprietary
[46:54.480 --> 46:58.320]  process where we just don't spray chemicals on it okay it's done in such a
[46:58.320 --> 47:02.800]  way that we believe it's maximized for absorption it's max lot my mice for
[47:02.800 --> 47:07.000]  bio usability bio availability let's talk about what's in what's in infowars
[47:07.000 --> 47:12.880]  live comm vitamin mineral fusion you can also call toll free 888 253 3139 to
[47:12.880 --> 47:19.320]  get it just get the product try it for yourself it will blow you away just
[47:19.320 --> 47:22.600]  imagine giving this to your children every morning or every evening or twice
[47:22.600 --> 47:26.620]  a day they are gonna love getting their minerals their multivitamins their
[47:26.620 --> 47:32.640]  amino acids the trace elements all at one time absorbable just in in fact the
[47:32.640 --> 47:37.480]  the the the developers manufacturers are feel safe for us to even put on the
[47:37.480 --> 47:41.560]  label the fact about the absorption tell tell folks yeah I was actually blown away
[47:41.560 --> 47:45.360]  because I had to go back yesterday and change a few things on the product page
[47:45.360 --> 47:48.760]  because the manufacturer said no we're so confident in this we will back you in
[47:48.760 --> 47:52.960]  saying that this unique delivery process and the standard of processing we're
[47:52.960 --> 47:56.760]  doing we're willing to back you on saying this is for maximum absorption
[47:56.760 --> 48:00.040]  and I've never seen a manufacturer come up they're not even they're really not
[48:00.040 --> 48:02.600]  even supposed to do things like that sometimes they said look we're so
[48:02.600 --> 48:06.400]  confident in this we're gonna back you 100 and by the way the vitamins and
[48:06.400 --> 48:09.560]  minerals and things in it give it the flavor yes there's a tiny bit of
[48:09.560 --> 48:14.080]  estevia well exhaled so again what's funny is we've had so many renditions of
[48:14.080 --> 48:18.960]  this I just said the same thing your dad is a doctor of dental surgery came over
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.640]  and asked the same question and I said I almost said Steve I said wait no we
[48:22.640 --> 48:26.360]  went even more neurotic by the way I want to thank our enemies for attacking
[48:26.360 --> 48:29.800]  us on things that probably really aren't even bad but but that some of the
[48:29.800 --> 48:33.600]  health Nazis don't want that's why we've gone total health Nazi this is the most
[48:33.600 --> 48:37.940]  over-the-top clean neurotic stuff you can find tell folks what's in it and okay
[48:37.940 --> 48:41.120]  so so we originally we're going to do the stevia but then we went even more
[48:41.120 --> 48:46.960]  neurotic to a patented xylitol that's corn-free because you could say oh well
[48:46.960 --> 48:50.720]  the corn and xylitol you know it could be g-mobile no no we went to the only
[48:50.720 --> 48:55.720]  corn-free xylitol on the planet of course xylitol is good for your teeth it
[48:55.720 --> 48:59.120]  can fight cavities all that kind of stuff this is the trademarked patented
[48:59.120 --> 49:03.600]  kind that we had to pay money to license pay pay upfront to license into our
[49:03.600 --> 49:06.640]  product for the manufacturer ship it to the manufacturer and then use that
[49:06.640 --> 49:10.400]  instead of that's why we run out of so many our products sometimes is because at
[49:10.400 --> 49:13.920]  this neurotic super clean California level of our products and things which is
[49:13.920 --> 49:17.240]  the high standard it's really hard to actually source it and get it and have
[49:17.240 --> 49:20.440]  it and jump to the hoops and sign the agreements and do it all and it's
[49:20.440 --> 49:24.520]  expensive you have to pay licensing agreements I tell folks how much this
[49:24.520 --> 49:33.280]  is so this is $40 $39.95 $39.95 and the funny part is we had it we had the
[49:33.280 --> 49:37.440]  meeting remember with the manufacturers and they said no no you're crazy sell it
[49:37.440 --> 49:42.000]  for 60 or 70 they said even if we were gonna sell it we'd sell it for 60 70
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.640]  they said it's so expensive already for you to make plus there's the perceived
[49:44.640 --> 49:48.160]  value people want to pay more no I'm not doing it and it's exclusive you can't go
[49:48.160 --> 49:52.480]  out and have this anywhere and you know made anywhere else but as usual I'm
[49:52.480 --> 49:57.120]  actually kind of blown away by a no reviews yet no reviews be the first to
[49:57.120 --> 49:59.680]  get it and believe me it's gonna sell out in days where you know you are a
[49:59.680 --> 50:04.240]  literally literally obsessed with people getting the lowest prices and I'm not
[50:04.240 --> 50:07.280]  just saying that in some weird cheesy way for we have arguments about no we've
[50:07.280 --> 50:10.360]  had arguments about it and it's not that I ever really want to charge people more
[50:10.360 --> 50:14.480]  it just hurts me to see you pay so much for something and the margins be so low
[50:14.480 --> 50:17.760]  at the same time you know what I mean working all this but I totally get it
[50:17.760 --> 50:20.920]  and I totally agree I love our audience and I want them to love this stuff I
[50:20.920 --> 50:24.080]  wanted to work really well and I want them to then buy even more and fund us
[50:24.080 --> 50:28.560]  yeah I mean that's just in my guts the right thing to do no it's true and I'll
[50:28.560 --> 50:32.400]  tell you what if you're taking something else that you like and I'm sure it's a
[50:32.400 --> 50:35.280]  great product and this can be you can take this in conjunction take it in
[50:35.280 --> 50:39.840]  conjunction but taste this taste the difference I never taste anything that's
[50:39.840 --> 50:43.080]  good taste the difference I've never tasted anything that's good and it's not
[50:43.080 --> 50:46.120]  it's not like there's big chunks of sediment this was sitting back and
[50:46.120 --> 50:49.600]  I mean congratulations thank you this is the best product we ever made
[50:49.600 --> 50:54.880]  this is over the top two years folks two years I'm gonna skip the break I have to
[50:54.880 --> 50:59.880]  this is just so important I'm no more today I'm a bad person it's just this
[50:59.880 --> 51:05.000]  is so important hey who else skips their breaks pretty routinely like that well I
[51:05.000 --> 51:10.360]  think we're doing money I have to quit doing it but but you know at the same
[51:10.360 --> 51:13.280]  time those are network breaks are not local breaks support to support our
[51:13.280 --> 51:16.000]  local affiliates in the network and the rest of it be quiet frankly I could just
[51:16.000 --> 51:19.520]  go to a three-hour show with no ads that's the way the internet works right
[51:19.520 --> 51:22.760]  now in fact I've thought about just completely leaving talk radio and TV and
[51:22.760 --> 51:25.360]  everything and just having a three-hour you know show in here that's
[51:25.360 --> 51:28.440]  streamed everybody and that's the model so I'm kind of moving to that but you
[51:28.440 --> 51:31.640]  know I love our affiliates I'm gonna keep a radio model for everybody and TV
[51:31.640 --> 51:35.960]  model at least for a while but we are more and more just going to absolutely
[51:35.960 --> 51:39.880]  commercial free stuff where we just plug a few times in the hour the products we
[51:39.880 --> 51:43.640]  use and believe it and it's simple I go out and find the very best shortwave
[51:43.640 --> 51:47.080]  radios at the lowest prices the highest quality that's what I sell the best non
[51:47.080 --> 51:50.840]  GMO heirloom seeds the widest selection that I use and personally plant that's
[51:50.840 --> 51:55.440]  what we sell I come up with designs with the crew of pro-gun t-shirts and pro
[51:55.440 --> 51:58.960]  Liberty shirts I want that's what we sell we sell what we buy I'm into G
[51:58.960 --> 52:03.240]  shock watches I'm into awesome optics that we buy from a group of special
[52:03.240 --> 52:08.880]  forces folks to get the lowest prices infowarstore.com that's what we do we
[52:08.880 --> 52:12.360]  treat you like we want to be treated but folks getting past that the amount of
[52:12.360 --> 52:16.200]  mineral and vitamin and trace element and amino acid deficiencies that are out
[52:16.200 --> 52:19.760]  there are insane Anthony I want to get back in the news for folks but the
[52:19.760 --> 52:23.840]  vitamin mineral fusion available at m4slife.com tell folks about some of
[52:23.840 --> 52:28.640]  these other things that are in this and why this is just this total complete
[52:28.640 --> 52:33.800]  package for your body because again we didn't put the synthetic amino acids we
[52:33.800 --> 52:38.280]  didn't put the synthetic vitamins we didn't we put the plant-based high
[52:38.280 --> 52:43.880]  quality clean natural ingredients into this yeah exactly so you've got your
[52:43.880 --> 52:47.240]  standard vitamins vitamin C vitamin E the list goes on a huge amount of
[52:47.240 --> 52:50.080]  vitamin C by the way tell folks about that a thousand plus percent of your
[52:50.080 --> 52:54.200]  daily value which is what you need because the you know FDA guidelines we
[52:54.200 --> 52:58.880]  all know about those zinc magnesium selenium l-glutamine each one of these
[52:58.880 --> 53:01.760]  you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things
[53:01.760 --> 53:06.440]  alpha the poic acid folic acid calcium and list goes on 34 other ones you can
[53:06.440 --> 53:10.640]  check out good imporeslife.com the labels up there you've got the entire
[53:10.640 --> 53:14.440]  ingredients list that you can neurotically examine for yourself and
[53:14.440 --> 53:18.280]  just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the
[53:18.280 --> 53:21.440]  minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there all it's got in
[53:21.440 --> 53:24.880]  there I mean it's amazing top left again of your radio listeners m4s.com
[53:24.880 --> 53:29.160]  forward slash show vitamin A has four thousand three hundred and thirty three
[53:29.160 --> 53:33.680]  percent from beta carotene and what's the other source I show this all the best
[53:33.680 --> 53:38.480]  sources retinol so you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU which is a
[53:38.480 --> 53:41.440]  large dose actually and you know what some people could say well isn't this
[53:41.440 --> 53:44.240]  competing with the other products well yeah you know what we could be like some
[53:44.240 --> 53:47.720]  people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at imporeslife.com and not
[53:47.720 --> 53:50.120]  put any of it but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to
[53:50.120 --> 53:53.080]  do that and it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff
[53:53.080 --> 53:56.000]  in here but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking
[53:56.000 --> 53:59.960]  like that well absolutely and you know here's the deal we take other great
[53:59.960 --> 54:02.760]  products and other great groups and double and triple the overall company
[54:02.760 --> 54:07.040]  sizes yeah that's just the love the info or audience gets it's just that the
[54:07.040 --> 54:11.320]  problem is info wars then when we brand something nationwide doesn't come back
[54:11.320 --> 54:15.640]  and we would collapse we wouldn't be here see because the goose needs to get
[54:15.640 --> 54:19.720]  fed you know some plants and stuff because it just can't shoot these gold
[54:19.720 --> 54:23.720]  eggs out and then not get fed enough and it dies then there's no other golden eggs
[54:23.720 --> 54:27.600]  for other companies other good groups and so that's how this works see I have
[54:27.600 --> 54:31.040]  to be able to run the operation I have to be able to fund us and if we have great
[54:31.040 --> 54:34.640]  sponsors that are out there but they can't fund the operation I'm gonna go
[54:34.640 --> 54:38.200]  out and game change and I'm gonna still have sponsors that are great but I have
[54:38.200 --> 54:42.880]  our own products as well but the truth is this is the best thing I've ever seen
[54:42.880 --> 54:47.840]  or tasted it is a game changer on every front and I'm so incredibly proud of it
[54:47.840 --> 54:57.160]  info wars life calm info or store.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and it is
[54:57.160 --> 55:01.120]  the audience out there on radio and TV that funds this whole operation fund our
[55:01.120 --> 55:06.480]  local affiliates support their sponsors support the network sponsors I don't
[55:06.480 --> 55:09.960]  endorse them all they don't endorse everything I promote you know quite
[55:09.960 --> 55:13.080]  frankly I'm talk radio in general I hear some ads that I can't stand you know
[55:13.080 --> 55:15.920]  get rich right now the back thing in the world you know you hear me promoting
[55:15.920 --> 55:19.880]  something that's what I believe in and I also again love the products and
[55:19.880 --> 55:23.400]  enforce health calm the ungevity products whether it's pollen burst beyond
[55:23.400 --> 55:27.600]  Tangy tangerine 2.0 they're all excellent as well this is something that is a game
[55:27.600 --> 55:32.560]  changer because of the amino acids the vitamins the minerals and the price of it
[55:32.560 --> 55:37.120]  and the fact that it tastes so good and my kids absolutely love it this is what
[55:37.120 --> 55:39.960]  it's all about there are similar things out there that aren't as good that come
[55:39.960 --> 55:44.360]  in little packets and things you see it whole foods that cost 60 bucks and it's
[55:44.360 --> 55:48.720]  not even a third of the amount of stuff we have in this so this this quite
[55:48.720 --> 55:53.680]  frankly competes or dominates on every front I want to try to put this in
[55:53.680 --> 55:57.520]  stores our first item to try to put in stores because this is competitive
[55:57.520 --> 56:02.480]  price-wise competitive the the foodies and vitamin heads are gonna love it the
[56:02.480 --> 56:06.200]  nutraceutical folks are gonna love it the health Nazis are gonna love it and
[56:06.200 --> 56:11.560]  it is absolutely going to dominate it is vitamin mineral fusion our problem is
[56:11.560 --> 56:16.160]  it's so good and so hard to source and so clean that sometimes we're gonna be
[56:16.160 --> 56:20.080]  sold out for a long time so it's gonna take some scaling to do that info wars
[56:20.080 --> 56:23.960]  life comm info or store.com now tell folks about some of these amino acids that
[56:23.960 --> 56:27.560]  are in here too man that's tiny writing well it's it yes has to be tiny because
[56:27.560 --> 56:30.400]  there's so much in there but the interesting thing about amino acids is
[56:30.400 --> 56:34.480]  that like I said we could go into you know things like alglutamine but I saw
[56:34.480 --> 56:39.520]  go into alphalopoic acid we could go into it literally stacks of paper this big
[56:39.520 --> 56:42.520]  about each one of them you know what I mean and that's the cool thing that most
[56:42.520 --> 56:46.160]  people don't even understand it's like this weird thing where trends are set
[56:46.160 --> 56:49.880]  like oh glutathione everyone needs that and then it'll be like oh alphalopoic
[56:49.880 --> 56:52.840]  acid actually does something and it'll be spikes right throughout like the past
[56:52.840 --> 56:56.800]  20 years and in the future big research papers will come out and remind everyone
[56:56.800 --> 57:00.680]  hey glue alglutamine actually enhances recovery it does all this stuff and
[57:00.680 --> 57:03.280]  everyone will be on a hype train about it for like a week and then they'll
[57:03.280 --> 57:08.080]  forget about it and then it'll be the next one well for me amino acids have
[57:08.080 --> 57:11.600]  always been kind of like so much research comes out on everyone forgets
[57:11.600 --> 57:15.360]  about it well we went back and look through all of the most potent bio
[57:15.360 --> 57:19.080]  available ones and put them all in here and so you can look up each one you know
[57:19.080 --> 57:23.280]  oh say I remember in 2012 when that was found out that it was like the most
[57:23.280 --> 57:26.400]  amazing thing everyone no one remembered and they don't remember and then these
[57:26.400 --> 57:30.120]  other companies some of them put the cruddy ones in there we're putting all
[57:30.120 --> 57:34.760]  the very very best that we would want to take this is the best product we could
[57:34.760 --> 57:39.240]  come up with even if the price doubled we probably couldn't do better I mean
[57:39.240 --> 57:44.640]  this is really amazing 39.95 it's concentrated understand that so it's
[57:44.640 --> 57:48.200]  got as much or double or triple what a lot of other leading brands have depending
[57:48.200 --> 57:51.400]  on which one you look at and it's all excellent you need to get vitamins and
[57:51.400 --> 57:54.560]  minerals you need to get things like this you need to get absorbable liquid
[57:54.560 --> 57:58.000]  vitamins but they need to be the non-synthetic type this is a great

[1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:15.040]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you right from the front
[1:00:15.040 --> 1:00:18.640]  line of the info war

[1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:30.080]  with the inside intel on election 2016 and more the big steel isn't coming it's
[1:00:30.080 --> 1:00:36.160]  on Anthony looking at this other news the migrant arrivals degrees rise sharply
[1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:40.080]  we also have articles where Saudi Arabia saying they're gonna execute gay
[1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:45.400]  people homosexuals and and the liberal media will not criticize this is what's
[1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:49.440]  taking over Islam but then wants to say Trump is this horrible evil person and
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:53.240]  implying he wants to kill Mexicans all because he says we have to have sovereignty
[1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:56.560]  have to have a border isn't that crazy I think this is the first time in human
[1:00:56.560 --> 1:01:01.520]  history there's a 100% detachment from the talking points of the mainstream
[1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:07.080]  media and the establishment system from any form of public consensus and I'm so
[1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:11.560]  tired of the media and talking heads and there was a good Bill Maher segment of
[1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:15.200]  on this where he was actually supporting this claim by the way that they don't like
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:19.800]  to talk about Saudi Arabia mistreating women just disgusting mistreatment of
[1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:24.360]  women killing gay people lashing people for the most ridiculous and absurd
[1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:29.200]  things like wine bottles if in their trunk or something like that but God
[1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:35.600]  forbid you say something that's not even sexist not even sexist and you will
[1:01:35.600 --> 1:01:40.960]  just be torn apart saying man and woman Seinfeld says to his daughter
[1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:43.920]  sorry Seinfeld hey gotta move we're gonna move back to New York so you meet
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:47.400]  more boys and she's 14 she goes saying boy and girl is sexist just saying
[1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:51.920]  mother and father is evil well actually feel like I'm in some type of like a
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:55.680]  beavis and butthead episode or something or like some weird idiocracy
[1:01:55.680 --> 1:02:00.880]  dystopic weird reality where you know I'm actually against sexism real sexism
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:05.320]  like Saudi Arabians lashing women for not wearing certain type of attire or
[1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:11.840]  whatever it is or I'm really against killing gay people for nothing but yeah
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:14.560]  now I'm a homophobe though because I'm against that and if you bring those
[1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:18.880]  things there's a homophobe what it does is it cracks the entire false reality in
[1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:22.640]  the facade so they can't have that they can't you have you crack the reality
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:27.640]  because then they'd have to say wait a minute how there is actually real
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:30.880]  atrocities going on around the world that don't revolve around hurting
[1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:34.720]  people's feelings with slight microaggressions in the United States so
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:38.240]  instead instead of talking about the bad stuff that's going on the lashings and
[1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:41.680]  and the killing of gay people in Saudi Arabia and not just Saudi Arabia there's
[1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:45.920]  even Asian countries where this is going on too and it's not just you know all of
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:48.760]  the Middle Eastern countries so it's going on everywhere and instead of
[1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:52.680]  addressing those issues and reminding people that those exist they'd rather
[1:02:52.680 --> 1:02:56.320]  focus on microaggressions and people writing Trump in chalk on the sidewalk
[1:02:56.320 --> 1:03:00.200]  and they do that of course to verbally and intellectually dominate us into
[1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:04.520]  their subculture of BS where we have to operate and we have to be enslaved
[1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:09.640]  mentally where we can't have big ideas we can't have free expression because you
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:13.000]  notice how much what percent of your brain now if you're on television or
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.480]  you're on even though on this radio show where we don't have to do this but is
[1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:19.680]  worrying about what could I say this even though you have no harmful
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:23.200]  intentions you have no harmful intentions you actually are a good person you
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:27.880]  respect people all people but you have to filter everything now don't you you
[1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:31.400]  can't be like you can't express yourself and say things that are a little silly
[1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:34.680]  or whatever you have to say well would this offend someone could this be you
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:39.200]  know perceived as a bigot statement when you're not a bigot and that's the
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:42.760]  worst part for me exactly it's like the censorship on everything in Saudi
[1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:46.840]  Arabia and now we have to bow to them but they're allowed to go through
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:49.640]  airport security about being searched and they're allowed to enslave their
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:53.280]  wives they're allowed to cut gay people's heads off and then if we
[1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:56.880]  criticize them there's the guy that did mr. show in portlandia you made a movie
[1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:00.520]  about me literally where they scream Alex Jones hates black people and hates
[1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:04.840]  gays and hates Muslims and he's a racist and loves the KKK and the guy just
[1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:07.680]  heard what's the name of that came out last year he starts screaming it's all
[1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:12.840]  like HBO and it's not even true I'm like and they just say because I don't
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:17.000]  know David Cross because I because I'm a real classical liberal like Thomas
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.760]  Jefferson and I'm really into freedom I mean I have my freedom you have your
[1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:23.960]  freedom they flip out on me I mean they're nuts man they're crazy it's funny
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:26.960]  because you know I think you as well also think a lot of his stuff is funny
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:31.840]  and it's like it's almost like Obama says he's at war with extremism right but
[1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:35.720]  all forms of extremism are tolerated sure sure why well my listeners went up
[1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:39.000]  to cross and said hey Alex is funny he's nice you don't do these things and
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.720]  cross in this a letter I'm sorry I didn't know you were that mean maybe I'll
[1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:45.480]  come on sometime bull I bet he was paid to put that BS out against us we know
[1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:48.680]  there's a lot of paid propaganda and then you'd want me to sue him we just had
[1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:51.480]  to act the friendly I don't know how they work hey brother I'm not gonna see you
[1:04:51.480 --> 1:04:55.800]  for lying about me knock yourself out you just credit yourself that's how this
[1:04:55.800 --> 1:05:00.800]  works I'm not afraid to fight as the Supreme Court wrestles with whether or
[1:05:00.800 --> 1:05:05.680]  not it will compel nuns to buy abortion insurance it should be a reminder
[1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:11.320]  of how absurd it is to trust our liberty to nine political appointees who
[1:05:11.320 --> 1:05:16.520]  believe the Constitution can be amended by their opinions NBC News reports that
[1:05:16.520 --> 1:05:20.600]  a quarter of Republican senators now want to meet with Obama's Supreme Court
[1:05:20.600 --> 1:05:24.920]  nominee much has been said about Obama's nominee Merrick Garland's record
[1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:27.880]  opposing the Second Amendment what hasn't been talked about is as long
[1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:32.880]  record of rubber stamping any rule from any federal regulatory agency Garland
[1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:37.520]  will be a reliable ally of the real government the federal bureaucracies
[1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:41.800]  with Scalia's death the Supreme Court is expected to be deadlocked on Obama's
[1:05:41.800 --> 1:05:46.400]  EPA regulations to shut down the coal industry the lower court on which Garland
[1:05:46.400 --> 1:05:51.360]  now serves will have the final say he will take Scalia's place on this
[1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:55.760]  important issue regardless of whether he takes Scalia's place on the court for
[1:05:55.760 --> 1:06:10.880]  war.com I'm David Knight thank you brother thank you guys for putting those

[1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:36.080]  here live I'm your host alex jones the news websites are info wars dot com and
[1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:40.400]  of course prison planet dot com we're fighting the globalist takeover of the
[1:08:40.400 --> 1:08:45.200]  planet well I was told about this weeks ago from the insider I tell you I've
[1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:49.480]  never seen information turn out to be a hundred percent on target every time like
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:52.640]  in the last eight months of Roger stone I was aware of his books I was aware of
[1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:57.200]  his work I was aware of his activities are going back all the way to Nixon and
[1:08:57.200 --> 1:09:01.880]  Barry Goldwater and working in four administrations nine total and then I
[1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:07.000]  saw the New York Times yesterday Donald Trump hires Paul Manafort to lead the
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:13.480]  delegate effort and it says right here that he's a longtime business partner of
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:19.880]  political operatives operative Roger stone and it goes through what's happening
[1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:27.080]  on that front but what's important here is also that Charles are black who's
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:29.680]  also a longtime friend about these gentlemen who've worked together there's
[1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:32.360]  not many of these guys at this high a level to understand how to run
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:35.600]  conventions these are the three guys they admit that the New York Times he's
[1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:41.080]  gone off to be with John Casey and he's I mean I'm telling you I don't know how
[1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:43.840]  much you can get into here because most of it's off record a lot of it's gonna
[1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:47.240]  be on record so I'm not gonna lead these questions I'm gonna let Roger stone
[1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:52.200]  start wherever he wants for the next 40 minutes or so and then just and he can
[1:09:52.200 --> 1:09:55.720]  do the whole hour of he wants but the peace he's with us till 45 after to walk
[1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:01.120]  through the data dump he gave me last night and this morning because the big
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:06.240]  steals on but we can stop it but that's only part of the story it's even in the
[1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:09.760]  New York Daily News they're stealing it from Bernie Sanders we again told you
[1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:15.240]  that months ago so knowing is half the battle as G.I. Joe says this is a big
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:19.920]  deal we also can talk about the lies about stone from the Republican
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:23.920]  candidates calling him the top inchman and claiming he's behind the sex stuff
[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:28.320]  which they admit comes from Rubio that's even in mainstream media and he's gonna
[1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:34.720]  address that and we're also going to get into Trump's campaign manager obviously
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:38.640]  turning himself in and being arrested what's really going on there because you
[1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:42.560]  watch the video he does grab her it doesn't look vicious like she said but
[1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:46.000]  both of them I think are lying when you watch both the videos and Paul Watson
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:50.360]  has a video at info wars.com pointing that out I really don't think his
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:53.320]  campaign manager should be out there running security that that just really
[1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:57.560]  sounds stupid he should be with guys that do that so he's insulated so that
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:01.200]  doesn't sound too smart I don't want to attack his campaign manager I think this
[1:11:01.200 --> 1:11:04.600]  is overblown but I tell you we're gonna address that bring it Roger stones take
[1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:10.160]  former campaign managers obviously on that right now stonezone.com now I'm
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:14.360]  gonna try to sit back and shut up and give Mr. Stone the floor because again a
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:20.960]  lot of this is secretive inside baseball so we'll see how far he can go today so
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:25.120]  the consummate insider now consummate outsider exposing the whole Apple card
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:29.760]  Roger Stone thanks for joining us Alex great to be here well as you know I
[1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:37.040]  correctly predicted for info wars.com only Monday that Scott Walker in the
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:42.400]  entire Wisconsin Republican machine abetted by Paul Ryan would endorse
[1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:48.600]  Ted Cruz and swing behind the stop Trump effort in that crucial state Trump has
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:54.880]  now done two town halls in the state he was in very good form last night focusing
[1:11:54.880 --> 1:11:59.360]  on trade focusing on jobs to a certain extent of course the controversy
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:05.600]  regarding his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has eclipsed some of that we
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:10.840]  have no way of knowing what the political implications of that are but the big
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:18.000]  steal is definitely odd and as you indicated ironically the really important
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:24.520]  news this week was the selection of Donald Trump of Paul Jay Manafort as his
[1:12:24.520 --> 1:12:30.360]  delegate coordinator and counter now this is a very arcane art Alex there are
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:37.080]  very few political hands who understand the Arcania and strategic options and
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:43.080]  structure of convention politics the great F Clifton White who nominated Barry
[1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:49.960]  Goldwater John P. Sears who nominated Ronald Reagan Dick Clindy's later
[1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:55.120]  attorney general helped elect and nominate Richard Nixon there are not
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:59.800]  many people on the face of the planet certainly in the United States who
[1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:04.720]  understand this so in all honesty I think that the Sharpies in the Republican
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:11.400]  Party the Romney Bush insider faction assume that they were going to roll the
[1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:17.560]  Trump people that they would be inexperienced naive untrained disorganized
[1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:23.760]  trust me all of that is out the window now Paul Manafort is the single best
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:29.920]  boat counter in the Republican Party and having an accurate count on the first
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:34.680]  ballot is absolutely crucial because that lets you know whether you're in good
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:40.000]  shape or whether it's time to go out and make a deal when you are closest to
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:45.440]  the nomination as Trump will be or at the magic number you're in the driver's
[1:13:45.440 --> 1:13:51.400]  seat if you know what your strategic options are and I have now every
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:56.680]  confidence that Manafort will get the Trump campaign up the snuff he will
[1:13:56.680 --> 1:14:02.320]  augment the already enthusiastic Trump operation in the States with some
[1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:07.560]  seasoned pros out of the Reagan operation some going back as far as
[1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:13.280]  Goldwater many fine Ron Paul people other outsiders and conservative
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:17.840]  activists with vast convention experience coming up through the young
[1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:21.840]  Republicans coming up through the Republican state organizations will
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:28.080]  augment Trump Trump is going to be ready for battle in Cleveland well we're
[1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:31.480]  moving into the future but going back eight months ago I know you you warned
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:34.480]  Trump about this you talked about this you came on this show and said get
[1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:37.480]  ready for this he's gonna win but we've got to get ready for them to try to
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:40.560]  steal the nomination and then of course the general election you've been right
[1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:45.720]  all along so thank God you've been there because now it's really being debated in
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:50.400]  the news and the public is reviling the fact that they want to sell us that they
[1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:55.800]  could ignore the popular vote well and in all honesty if I have any advice for
[1:14:55.800 --> 1:15:00.760]  Trump supporters rank and file Trump supporters it would be this go to
[1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:06.800]  Cleveland come to Cleveland don't let the big deal go forward without massive
[1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:13.680]  protest peaceful nonviolent protest so as they used to say I don't wait for
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:18.200]  orders from headquarters ride to the sound of the guns I don't mean to imply
[1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:23.520]  violence on that I mean ride to where the action will be we have to let the
[1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:29.440]  Republican bosses and the king makers and the insiders and the lobbyists know
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:34.800]  that we're not going to stand for the big steal so if you are a Trump supporter
[1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:41.480]  make plans now take a bus hitchhike carpool take a train fly if you can
[1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:46.920]  afford it we need you in Cleveland this is the most political direct action the
[1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:51.880]  most important action in decades of not in a hundred years folks and bottom line
[1:15:51.880 --> 1:15:58.000]  I mean we can talk about this right you are going to plan to lead with myself and
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:02.360]  many others demonstrations events movements the details won't be out for a
[1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:08.480]  while but folks be in Cleveland for the week of that convention be there and we
[1:16:08.480 --> 1:16:14.040]  are going to absolutely show the world the real power we need five million
[1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:21.120]  constitutional Trumpians Trumpist to be there so that all the Soros trash and
[1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:24.680]  all the filth the few hundred thousand they'll have there are totally dwarfed
[1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:30.000]  and the establishment does not dare steal the popular vote from the people
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:33.480]  and so we're going to have more information very very soon people can go
[1:16:33.480 --> 1:16:37.680]  to stop the steel website of Roger Stone and get ready you want to stand up
[1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:40.960]  against the globalist them trying to steal the election and stop a populist
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:44.480]  that wants to have fair trade deals and things like that you want to go up
[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:48.240]  against all these foreign governments saying we can't have Trump then go to
[1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:54.240]  stop the steel go there today and get involved with Roger Stone and everybody
[1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:59.880]  else because clearly stones gaining momentum his his his other coterie of
[1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:04.720]  advisors and experts are within the Trump campaign he's called where this was
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:09.040]  going Trump knows that and so thank God Trump's really getting a firm footing now
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:13.800]  against this takeover yeah Alex I want to be very clear Donald Trump made a
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:18.760]  brilliant decision in choosing Paul Manafort to run his convention operation
[1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:26.160]  Manafort has done this for Gerald Ford for Ronald Reagan for George Bush for Bob
[1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:32.440]  Dole he is literally the very best so I feel good about the convention I must
[1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:36.920]  also say that now there's a growing breach between the establishment types
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:45.120]  between the Romney Rubio Bush wing of the party and John Kasich Kasich has made a
[1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:50.600]  side deal with George Soros the Soros forces have funneled over five hundred
[1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:55.920]  and thirty thousand dollars to John Kasich to keep him in this race now let's
[1:17:55.920 --> 1:18:00.000]  stop because I want you're making huge announcements here huge developments you
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:03.720]  plan to go with millions of people and try to block the steel and exercise the
[1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:06.360]  First Amendment they're already trying to steal your vote now they want to steal
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:11.000]  your speech you got to exercise it or lose it bombshell also Trump's got the
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:15.080]  best person and people in try to fight this meanwhile Kasich has hired the
[1:18:15.080 --> 1:18:19.160]  other guy your former for current friend but a former business associate to try
[1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:23.320]  to run his own delegate grab he's admitting that and now you're coming
[1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:26.840]  out from your sources and you wanted to tell me this morning and saying Soros
[1:18:26.840 --> 1:18:31.960]  is basically puppeteering Kasich that discredits him so badly go ahead yeah I
[1:18:31.960 --> 1:18:36.960]  think the game plan is very sear very clear Kasich is the backup plan of the
[1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:42.280]  globalist Kasich they hope to force Kasich on Trump later as a running
[1:18:42.280 --> 1:18:48.600]  mate just as they forced George HW Bush on Ronald Reagan so Soros has a backup
[1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:56.040]  plan I do know that that Kasich's handler John Weaver is profiteering
[1:18:56.040 --> 1:19:01.880]  mightily off the Soros connection now I understand that the establishment types
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:08.400]  are angry that that he will not the case it will not throw in with the Bush Cruz
[1:19:08.400 --> 1:19:15.280]  Rubio Cabal but he's putting his own best interests in the dollars of of Soros
[1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:20.960]  ahead of the establishment but in a sense Soros is the puppet master he's the
[1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:27.200]  man with the larger plan on how to affect what goes down in Cleveland the
[1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:32.080]  other thing I can report Alex is that former Mississippi governor Haley

[1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:27.240]  zone commas here stop the steel dot org is where you go and that's kind of the
[1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:30.240]  unofficial area but they've got people on the ground they're spending a lot of
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:34.640]  money where they're proving in different states or preparing lawsuits you name it
[1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:39.360]  for the fraud going on remember they already took Louisiana publicly from
[1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:46.200]  Trump even though he won and gave it to Ted Cruz so an unprecedented time going
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:50.200]  on but if we get out there and wake people up this will backfire on them so
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:54.880]  continue with Roger Stone looking at the inside baseball you were getting into
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:58.880]  different things happening behind the scenes who Trump is hiring what Soros
[1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:04.600]  is doing please continue yes so I have learned Alex that Haley Barber former
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:08.280]  governor of Mississippi former chairman of the Republican governor's
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:13.680]  Association heavy-duty lobbyist very smart pal good friend of mine for many
[1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:20.040]  years even though we disagree on many things and his brother Henry Barber the
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:23.840]  Republican National Committee man from Mississippi two of the ultimate
[1:25:23.840 --> 1:25:29.160]  insiders have retained Chris Hennick a political consultant formerly with the
[1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:35.400]  Republican governor's Association to game plan a rules and strategy to deprive
[1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:41.520]  Trump of this nomination now you just made a reference to stop the steel dot
[1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:46.120]  org and I think this is vitally important for people to understand they
[1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:52.360]  are in these caucuses and primaries they have been systematically involved in
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:59.240]  voter fraud voter irregularities we are painstakingly and expensively
[1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:05.920]  documenting that in Oklahoma in Texas in Kansas in Hawaii and now
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:12.280]  overwhelmingly in Utah the purpose of this is to challenge the seeding of
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:19.480]  Cruz delegates in the credentials committee it is a strategic option that
[1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:24.520]  we must have available to the Trump campaign if they decide to exercise it
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:29.760]  so if you know of voter fraud in any of those states or if you know of voter
[1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:34.440]  fraud or irregularities in the primaries going forward in Wisconsin in
[1:26:34.440 --> 1:26:39.480]  California in New Jersey in New York please call the toll-free number you
[1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:44.400]  can find it at stop the steel dot org if you want to contribute to help us
[1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:49.560]  document the steel going on in the primaries again go to stop the steel
[1:26:49.560 --> 1:26:54.800]  dot org this is vitally important information we are going to have a
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:27:01.000]  massive stop the steel rally and protest in Cleveland you'll be able to go to
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:05.520]  the site shortly to get those details I'm going to give the number out we'll
[1:27:05.520 --> 1:27:12.480]  put it back up on screen briefly and I can give that number out it's 855-245-4634
[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:21.360]  that's 855-254-4634 and listen we're about action here at info wars and this
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:27.040]  is our popular vote this is our system they claim they're allowed to steal it
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:30.920]  we're gonna force their hand and say no politically you're not just because you
[1:27:30.920 --> 1:27:36.320]  claim it this is a mind game and even if they have the nerve to still steal it it
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:40.280]  will politically destroy them but we have to illustrate it for everyone we
[1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:44.360]  win either way if they steal it or they don't steal it but evidence is
[1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:49.720]  mounting that Trump and his crew on the ground have the old hands in there that
[1:27:49.720 --> 1:27:55.000]  will be able to stop them at least get it out in the public view and then the
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:59.360]  whole thing will blow up on them Roger Stone let's talk about how the breaks
[1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:02.480]  could work here how you think this is probably going to end up working out
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:08.400]  because I've never seen a time it's more nail-biting edge of your seat in your
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:13.640]  50 something years of electioneering have you know actually as you know Alex
[1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:17.520]  most Republican national conventions in fact both party conventions have been
[1:28:17.520 --> 1:28:21.560]  cut and dried affairs that were decided long before folks got in the
[1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:26.120]  convention town this will be the most epic and exciting and I think hard fought
[1:28:26.120 --> 1:28:32.560]  convention since 1976 when I was working for Ronald Reagan and my former
[1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:37.600]  partner Paul Manafort was whipping delegates for Gerald Ford now you
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:43.040]  mentioned Charlie Black my former partner now running delegate operations for
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:49.520]  John Kasich again one of the most skilled and intuitive and well connected
[1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:55.040]  political operatives in the country not a man to be underestimated the Kasich
[1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:59.760]  maneuver is a tough one he's sitting on a hundred votes there he has almost no
[1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:04.640]  probability of being nominated for president but trust me his is a vice
[1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:11.280]  presidential strategy to end up as the vice president for Trump or somebody if
[1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:16.600]  this nomination does not go to Trump on the first ballot I predict it goes to
[1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:21.360]  Paul Ryan on the fourth ballot Roger Stone stay there I want to come back and
[1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:24.280]  walk through this slowly it's so important and speaking of slowly I gave
[1:29:24.280 --> 1:29:33.560]  the number out too fast and David out once wrong stop the steel.org or 855-245-4634
[1:29:33.560 --> 1:29:40.680]  that's 855-245-4634 stop the steel.org folks get those complaints in it's
[1:29:40.680 --> 1:29:44.240]  having a big effect we'll be back straight ahead I'm Alex Jones it's
[1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:49.360]  election 2016 the battle for the Republic we're on the March the
[1:29:49.360 --> 1:29:56.400]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:29:58.760 --> 1:30:05.840]  Fast and Furious was a secret program to ship arms to Middle East terrorists an
[1:30:05.840 --> 1:30:11.120]  expert researcher investigating the ATF's operation Fast and Furious gun
[1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:16.840]  walking scandal has discovered the operation is ongoing and is likely
[1:30:16.840 --> 1:30:24.160]  serving as a conduit for a global gun ring you have a nexus between Fast and
[1:30:24.160 --> 1:30:29.160]  Furious and it's not been Gazi at least the Middle East we know weapons were
[1:30:29.160 --> 1:30:32.840]  run down to Mexico met with the international Middle Eastern arms
[1:30:32.840 --> 1:30:38.360]  dealer and of I think a great import is a Moroccan DST commander reported to
[1:30:38.360 --> 1:30:43.680]  his supervisors that Fast and Furious weapons were in the kingdom of Morocco
[1:30:43.680 --> 1:30:48.000]  en route to arm the rebels in Algeria and that was Lieutenant Colonel Matt
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:52.320]  Smith Mac yesterday on the Alex Jones show and you can listen to this
[1:30:52.320 --> 1:30:59.080]  explosive interview in its entirety right now at info wars.com more than
[1:30:59.080 --> 1:31:03.320]  two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what has been

[1:31:15.960 --> 1:31:20.080]  member of the halogen family into the water they took the good halogen out and
[1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:24.680]  put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is

[1:33:25.120 --> 1:33:32.080]  a side you're listening to Alex Jones it's been reported about world that daily
[1:33:32.080 --> 1:33:36.520]  top story on drugs report by Torum Corsi we should get back on this week or
[1:33:36.520 --> 1:33:44.560]  next week Dr. Corsi the report is is that Trump's chief of staff prosecutor out
[1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:49.360]  it as a Hilmary supporter put on Florida Democratic Party's campaign endorsing
[1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:55.280]  camp the council my issue is this is becoming a distraction from the rest
[1:33:55.280 --> 1:33:59.840]  of campaign and the big steel and that's another reason that Roger Stone has
[1:33:59.840 --> 1:34:03.240]  never wanted to get into all the sex stuff he's always said it's a distraction
[1:34:03.240 --> 1:34:07.000]  it's a diversion and then you notice again on CNN and a bunch of the channels
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:11.320]  last night Ted Cruz came out and said the henchman Roger Stone you can play the
[1:34:11.320 --> 1:34:16.640]  clip I guess you know is out to get me but he won't deny all the women and I've
[1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:21.040]  been researching it it looks like it's going on my problem is he acts like he's
[1:34:21.040 --> 1:34:25.040]  the second coming this high priest this Messiah and so if he is running around
[1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:28.800]  with five mistresses and hookers I've got a problem with it in fact we have the
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:35.560]  club here at us let me be clear this National Enquirer story is garbage it
[1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:43.400]  is complete and utter lies it is a tabloid smear and it is a smear that has
[1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:51.920]  come from Donald Trump and his henchmen it is attacking my family and what is
[1:34:51.920 --> 1:35:00.000]  striking is Donald henchmen Roger Stone had for months been foreshadowing that
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:04.040]  this attack was coming it's not surprising that Donald Trump's tweet
[1:35:04.040 --> 1:35:11.360]  occurs the day before the attack comes out and I would note that Mr. Stone is a
[1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:17.400]  man who has 50 years of dirty tricks behind him he's a man for whom a term
[1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:25.720]  was coined for copulating with a rodent well let me be clear Donald Trump may
[1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:31.600]  be a rat but I have no desire to copulate with and this garbage does not
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:35.560]  that's one for a few days ago there's a new one to recent stuff like this look
[1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:38.800]  the inquire admits they were working on it four or five months ago they admit
[1:35:38.800 --> 1:35:42.120]  you weren't involved they called you about it you said yeah I hear it's true
[1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:47.520]  and they the media is calling these women and it's obviously if much of it's
[1:35:47.520 --> 1:35:50.680]  true the inquirer I don't know when they've been wrong about these scandals
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:54.880]  I mean John Edwards you name it the list goes on and on and I know you didn't
[1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:57.320]  want to go with this I called you this weekend and wanted you on about it you
[1:35:57.320 --> 1:36:00.560]  didn't want to do it but but now you're here you say you're willing to talk
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:04.560]  about it because for me it goes to their character they're openly stealing
[1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:08.320]  Trump delegates and votes they're openly getting ready to steal the popular
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:11.760]  vote and then they want to act like that you and Trump are beating up on his wife
[1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:16.560]  when they started the attacks on Trump's wife yeah Alex this is strictly
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:23.000]  deflection so let me be very clear I categorically deny that I was the source
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:27.880]  of this story I categorically deny that I ever discussed it with Donald or with
[1:36:27.880 --> 1:36:33.440]  his campaign it is now well established that this ball started rolling with the
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:39.880]  Marco Rubio campaign that Rubio's agents were actively shopping this story to
[1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:46.920]  major news outlets in all honesty if I were going to plant a story as a dirty
[1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:52.360]  trick would I be quoted in that story would I allow myself to be quoted and
[1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:58.120]  leave a big old thumbprint I'm many things but stupid isn't one of them
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:03.680]  what's even more outrageous though is you have Ted Cruz a man whose campaign
[1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:10.720]  planted a false story that Ben Carson was getting out of the race on CNN and
[1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:17.800]  then systematically called a pre identified list of Ben Carson's voting
[1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:24.000]  supporters texted them emailed them phone called them to tell them oh CNN has
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:29.120]  reported that Carson is out shift your vote to Cruz and by the way I've noticed
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:32.440]  Roger I've noticed that Trump hasn't been doing dirty tricks he's been moving
[1:37:32.440 --> 1:37:35.640]  forward with populist pro-american messages and when I went back and
[1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:38.280]  researched you years ago and then again when you were getting involved with us
[1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:42.360]  here in info wars eight months ago or so that was the liberal media calling you a
[1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:46.880]  dirty trickster they call me a deep racist with no quotes I mean they might
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:51.720]  as well call me Santa Claus they just lie one man's dirty trick is another
[1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:59.440]  man's civic participation look I've seen and I know the names of the women who
[1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:04.520]  Ted Cruz has allegedly been involved in and I must tell you I think he may be
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:10.680]  the one who's copulating with rodents well you notice he doesn't outright
[1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:15.160]  deny it either and he's not coming out saying this is all lies he just says
[1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:19.080]  it's garbage you know it's Trump yeah now he was asked specifically have you
[1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:24.000]  ever been unfaithful to your wife and he declines to answer that question and of
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:29.760]  course now you have huge speculation that the lawyer for the DC madam is
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:36.040]  threatening to release the 800 names that are on her client list a judge is
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:42.080]  trying to prevent that but he has said repeatedly this will have a a profound
[1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:47.600]  effect on the current presidential race well what that tells me is that it's not
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:53.000]  Chris Christie he was on the list and if I were Ted Cruz I think I'd be more
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:58.560]  concerned about that but I guess that'll get blamed on Donald Trump they'll
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:03.680]  claim that Ted Cruz actually had Donald Trump's thing that Ruby I was obsessed
[1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:08.840]  with and then he did it with Donald's yeah look I this is all a sideshow and
[1:39:08.840 --> 1:39:14.440]  it is purposely meant to distract folks from the fact that even as we sit here
[1:39:14.440 --> 1:39:19.840]  delegate votes are being stolen from Donald Trump in South Carolina in
[1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:25.840]  Louisiana in in they're going to be stolen there's gonna be an attempt to
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:31.720]  steal them I should say in Colorado in Arizona the big steal is on and they're
[1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:35.320]  nibbling at the edges that's right that's right Ted Cruz's bimbos whatever
[1:39:35.320 --> 1:39:39.920]  you don't care you care about the the theft of someone who has got double the
[1:39:39.920 --> 1:39:43.920]  delegates turbocharging with the entire world media demonizing him and
[1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:49.480]  attacking him the most fantastical time politically to ever be alive beyond any
[1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:54.280]  movie it's over the top and we don't care about what you know the wooden man
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:57.360]  Ted Cruz is doing and all his distractions on the five minutes we
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:01.640]  have left Roger Stone you've got the floor to break down the big steel where
[1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:06.240]  it's coming how we stop it what we do how we get to Cleveland the troops are
[1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:10.680]  ready for the marching orders well I mean look there's so many places where
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:14.360]  that where there's a skirmish it's almost hard to cover it in South Carolina
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:19.960]  all of the delegates must have by party rules have been delegates to the
[1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:24.360]  Republican State Convention two years ago Trump was not a candidate two years
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:28.880]  ago there are no Trump supporters attending the state convention that is a
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:34.040]  problem you've just seen the big steal where they grab five uncommitted votes
[1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:39.720]  and five additional votes for Ted Cruz in Louisiana even though Trump won that
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:46.680]  primary with almost 40% of the vote this is going on in Georgia it is it is
[1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:51.960]  going to be the strategy across the board a larger problem as we have
[1:40:51.960 --> 1:40:56.680]  discussed is the packing of these delegations with Trojan horse delegates
[1:40:56.680 --> 1:41:03.840]  so even in Texas where Trump is entitled by party rules to 40 votes from the
[1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:10.960]  delegation the bosses with with Rick Perry and George P. Bush and Ted Cruz
[1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:16.360]  pulling the strings the bosses have let it be known there will be no Trump
[1:41:16.360 --> 1:41:21.800]  supporters on the Texas delegation none the Lubbock County chairman Carl
[1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:25.560]  Tepper a very good man strong supporter of Donald Trump
[1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:29.720]  essentially they are stiffing him they are telling him and he's the chairman of
[1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:33.200]  the Republican they're just going to steal it all in front of us but it's
[1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:37.400]  okay because Ted from Canada and he has a cowboy hat yeah they're going to steal
[1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:42.800]  it in broad daylight the one good piece of news is I have enormous confidence in
[1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:47.920]  the man Donald Trump has selected to lead his troops in Cleveland Paul Manafort
[1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:53.760]  is the ultimate pro and he's many many steps ahead of the establishment ruling
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:59.680]  clique so again I I implore anybody who's out there listening or watching if
[1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:05.680]  you're for Donald Trump and you need a summer vacation come to Cleveland we
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:10.520]  need you in Cleveland we have to demonstrate to the king makers that
[1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:15.400]  we're not going to stand for the big steal we are going to have a massive
[1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:21.480]  stop the steal rally where we can show our strength Alex is going to speak I'm
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:26.520]  going to speak there will be others we have to demonstrate to the world that
[1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:31.160]  we're not going to stand for the hijacking of American democracy it's
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:35.280]  incredible I mean I don't care who you are you should be standing up for the
[1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:39.160]  voting in this country and their attempt to say oh well we let you vote but it
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:45.160]  doesn't really count this is truly jumping the shark and I can't imagine a
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:51.640]  wilder circus than Cleveland I mean I've got I've got butterflies and I've been
[1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:56.200]  involved on air so much for so long not much gives me butterflies and I've got
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:43:04.200]  butterflies like the first time I was going on air 21 years ago Roger where
[1:43:04.200 --> 1:43:07.840]  do you think this is gonna end up in your gut I mean I think Trump's gonna be
[1:43:07.840 --> 1:43:09.880]  able to beat them and still take it I don't think they're gonna be able to
[1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:14.040]  rip this off or if they do that'll bring them down as well I am growingly
[1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:19.320]  confident about Trump's ability to win on the first ballot but let's be clear
[1:43:19.320 --> 1:43:25.080]  the toughest wicked is Wisconsin Trump is up by double digits in California New
[1:43:25.080 --> 1:43:28.960]  York New Jersey and Pennsylvania Pennsylvania is a little complicated
[1:43:28.960 --> 1:43:33.160]  because it has a beauty contest and a separate delegate contest but I'm
[1:43:33.160 --> 1:43:39.320]  confident that that the Trump folks and Paul Manafort and Mike Glassner their
[1:43:39.320 --> 1:43:43.400]  political director very capable guy I think the I think they're on top of it
[1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:50.400]  so Wisconsin now is is the battleground and as I indicated right here on info
[1:43:50.400 --> 1:43:56.080]  wars.com on Monday that they are rolling out the big guns Scott Walker the
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:44:00.200]  governor who's beaten back two recalls beat back and attempt to recall the
[1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:05.200]  majority in the Senate funded largely in his career by the Koch brothers Paul
[1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:09.040]  Ryan the guy who said ten times he didn't want to be speaker when of course
[1:44:09.040 --> 1:44:12.760]  he wanted to be speaker now he says he doesn't want to be president when he
[1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:17.760]  does want to be president they're rolling out all the big guns in Wisconsin it
[1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:23.680]  is Trump versus the establishment wall to wall and it is essential that Trump
[1:44:23.680 --> 1:44:28.200]  get out of Wisconsin with delegates although let me say this if they lose
[1:44:28.200 --> 1:44:32.680]  Wisconsin there's still enough delegates in the states are remaining to put
[1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:38.240]  Trump over the top the guy who must win Wisconsin however is Ted Cruz he needs
[1:44:38.240 --> 1:44:43.680]  86% of all delegates chosen going forward to reach the magic number he is
[1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:49.960]  nowhere near 1237 and believe me when the time comes the Bush brothers will push
[1:44:49.960 --> 1:44:55.720]  tricky ten aside and grab a more reliable member of the globe that was my
[1:44:55.720 --> 1:45:00.360]  final question I mean does even get a VP spot then if he's obviously in the
[1:45:00.360 --> 1:45:04.000]  second place or they just totally throw him to the side because they created him
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  he's their minion he's their android biological android from the beginning I
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:11.440]  mean what are you expecting at the convention they are crazy enough and we
[1:45:11.440 --> 1:45:16.040]  see them we see Paul Ryan we see the announcements that he's looking like he
[1:45:16.040 --> 1:45:21.000]  may get ready to get in now this is over the top well the strategy of Rob of
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:24.880]  Mitt Romney has of course failed I think he is now unlikely not having the
[1:45:24.880 --> 1:45:29.520]  courage to get in the late primaries and contend the bosses have a very hard
[1:45:29.520 --> 1:45:33.880]  time handing this nomination to someone who has no delegate votes but I must tell
[1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:39.040]  you Ted Cruz's chance of winning this nomination are virtually zero for
[1:45:39.040 --> 1:45:43.760]  personal reasons not issue reasons but personal reasons he's not well liked in
[1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:48.120]  the establishment more because of his prickly personality they know he can be
[1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:52.920]  counted on to support the globalist agenda but they just don't like him and
[1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:57.400]  in the end he will end up begging whoever the nominee is for an appointment
[1:45:57.400 --> 1:46:02.320]  to listen to the US Supreme Court the establishment will push him aside and go
[1:46:02.320 --> 1:46:07.280]  to one of their more reliable minions but only if Donald Trump can be stopped
[1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:11.600]  on the first ballot all right I want to get one last point with you I look at a
[1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:15.240]  lot of national polls Trump's neck and neck are a little bit ahead Hillary some
[1:46:15.240 --> 1:46:19.600]  he's behind but the mantra by the Republicans on TV and the Democrats is
[1:46:19.600 --> 1:46:23.600]  he can't be Hillary you know you're giving it to Hillary you know please
[1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:26.360]  throw us in the briar patch they don't want to be thrown in the briar patch
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:30.400]  they seem to be really scared of Trump and the way he's got double digit numbers
[1:46:30.400 --> 1:46:35.000]  compared to the last election a black Americans voting for him a lot of Reagan
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:38.960]  Democrats a lot of blue-collar Democrats and it seems like even on the view and
[1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:42.480]  stuff you know he's saying hey Brussels has fallen apart a lot of Arab terrorists
[1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:47.320]  they blow it up I mean Trump's not really saying radical stuff in in most
[1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:52.680]  cases and so it seems like the longer he stays in the more this hype is going to
[1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:58.240]  wear off in my gut dead reckoning looking at this I think Trump's the strongest
[1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:02.360]  candidate against Hillary Kasek is a ringer obviously over there with
[1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:08.040]  Soros always part of the boat you know the two-party duopoly slash monopoly
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:13.160]  Cruz is a joke you know a total bush creature we now know unfortunately what
[1:47:13.160 --> 1:47:16.880]  is I mean your real analysis because you give it to us what does Trump do if he
[1:47:16.880 --> 1:47:20.720]  gets out of this nomination and then what are the dirty tricks we got to face
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:25.040]  there it's the exact opposite of what the Republican bosses are telling us
[1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:29.200]  Trump is the only one who can beat Hillary here's why first of all he's not
[1:47:29.200 --> 1:47:34.000]  afraid to open the issue of her abuse of her husband's sexual assault victims
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:38.680]  Hillary's an accessory after the fact in every one of Bill Clinton's sex crimes
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:45.280]  Juanita Broderick Kathleen Willie a very brave and courageous woman Paula Jones
[1:47:45.280 --> 1:47:52.840]  Eileen Wellstone Christy Ward great Liz Ward Grayson this list goes on and on
[1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:57.160]  of women that Bill has assaulted but who are then subsequently bullied and
[1:47:57.160 --> 1:48:01.880]  intimidated and abused by Hillary he can also expose her on 9-11 Clinton was
[1:48:01.880 --> 1:48:05.920]  helping the Saudis and bin Laden that was in mainstream news he can get him on
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:09.640]  all of his background he'll destroy him and he's willing to do it well and I
[1:48:09.640 --> 1:48:13.320]  would remind you because he gave a hundred thousand dollars to the Clinton
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:18.600]  Foundation on the naive belief he was giving to a charity he's the only one
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:25.000]  with the legal standing to sue the foundation for fraud this fall and thus
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  open it up for the world to see the largest money laundering scheme in
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:35.880]  American history plus we're getting closer to the FBI recommending her
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:39.640]  indictment I mean that that now is looking like it's gonna happen well and
[1:48:39.640 --> 1:48:44.760]  I again predicted that if she is indicted Obama will quickly pardon her
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:50.520]  pardon me if she if the FBI recommends recommends her indictment Obama will
[1:48:50.520 --> 1:48:55.840]  pardon her prior to any indictment now is that a pardon in return for getting out
[1:48:55.840 --> 1:49:00.800]  of the race and letting Uncle Joe Biden step in or is that a pardon to try to
[1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:06.520]  cleanse her to run with that either way Hillary Clinton is not going to be our
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:12.200]  next president wellstonezone.com thank you for your time your energy amazing to

[1:49:49.240 --> 1:49:52.440]  exposing him ever since people say what are you doing having that big inside or
[1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:57.600]  on well he's fighting the globalist he's been doing it for 13 years 14 years I
[1:49:57.600 --> 1:50:00.760]  mean that's not you know some little thing where he acts like a patriot for a
[1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:07.120]  year or four years like Rogers you know like the Rogers Nemesis over there the
[1:50:07.120 --> 1:50:12.040]  wooden man Ted Cruz I mean Ted Cruz the whole thing shows you it's a setup and
[1:50:12.040 --> 1:50:15.280]  now the bush is coming out and endorsing him and the rest of it I don't want to
[1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:20.600]  attack Ted Cruz because I liked him on his gun votes and his filibusters on
[1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:24.840]  Obamacare and other stuff like that but man when you got the bushes behind you
[1:50:24.840 --> 1:50:28.640]  and you're making all these you know lies up about Donald Trump I've got a big
[1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:34.960]  problem dislike even like I dislike Hillary absolutely not gosh I got to
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:37.800]  say I mean I have to vote for him over Hillary Clinton people say all the

[2:00:24.880 --> 2:00:28.840]  American another day closer to victory and for all of you out there on or
[2:00:28.840 --> 2:00:33.160]  behind the line this is your song
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:40.080]  but they took a lot of people away people that they thought we're gonna make
[2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:43.560]  trouble for them people that guns and things they wanted to just took them away
[2:00:43.560 --> 2:00:48.720]  where we education camps that's what they call it so part of it is we have to
[2:00:48.720 --> 2:00:52.520]  break through our kind of private idea that the kids belong to their parents or
[2:00:52.520 --> 2:00:55.960]  kids along their families are recognized kids belong to whole communities
[2:00:55.960 --> 2:01:06.960]  I have decided we really need camps for adults and we need to have camps that you all run
[2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:11.040]  all persons of Japanese descent were required to register now they were
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:14.560]  taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had
[2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:17.440]  built assembly centers
[2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:23.080]  what kind of a situation in the US would you see that happening I mean we've got
[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:27.520]  a lot of competition listening to a lot of people that start following us plus
[2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:30.120]  you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the
[2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:35.000]  ability and the knowledge to to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:40.560]  techniques these people are radicalized and they don't support the United
[2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:44.320]  States and they're disloyal to the United States it's our right and our
[2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:49.640]  obligation to segregate them from the normal community
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:01:58.120]  this is what we're doing here unless not kid about it we're building a domestic
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:09.160]  army put your gun down really rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:15.960]  liberty it's alex jones are you some kind of a constitutionalist
[2:02:15.960 --> 2:02:23.600]  so these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not nothing more than

[2:03:03.800 --> 2:03:10.720]  rule the world Goldman Sachs rules the world this is we are going to carve up
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:16.440]  the world according to the way we want to unelected world government looting you
[2:03:16.440 --> 2:03:21.400]  they've exercised power for actual rule the global control I know what North

[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:36.680]  do anything lack of transparency the huge political advantage and basically you
[2:03:36.680 --> 2:03:39.680]  know call to stupidity American voter or whatever you understand you're living
[2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:43.240]  in a science fiction I'm living in the government has just approved the use of
[2:03:43.240 --> 2:03:46.680]  a computer chip that would be implanted under your skin when complete
[2:03:46.680 --> 2:03:52.080]  everyone will have a unique 12-digit identity number DNA is stored even
[2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:55.800]  without your consent but I mean today point blank say we're putting a chip in
[2:03:55.800 --> 2:04:02.560]  you I guess it was an interior barcode if you will this makes my head explode
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:06.120]  that your television could be e-dropping on your conversations and then sharing
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:10.520]  it over the web all the cars now have tracker boxes that can remote control
[2:04:10.520 --> 2:04:14.200]  your vehicle in them the Justice Department is building a national
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:18.320]  database to track in real-time the movement of vehicles around the US
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:22.600]  storing hundreds of millions of records about motorists it's like see a leader
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:26.280]  space aliens or something with a master plan it's so evil it's so sadistic no
[2:04:26.280 --> 2:04:33.080]  it's the devil I mean that's it this galactic force of destruction that's
[2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:41.720]  animating people to do this the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the
[2:04:41.720 --> 2:04:45.200]  Alex Jones show
[2:04:45.200 --> 2:05:04.640]  the New York Daily News says maybe the system really is rigged you think the
[2:05:04.640 --> 2:05:08.240]  Democrat paper came to this conclusion after contacting Democrats super
[2:05:08.240 --> 2:05:11.600]  delegates in New York and asking if they would switch from Hillary to Bernie if
[2:05:11.600 --> 2:05:17.080]  they won the popular vote every single super delegate said no just like the
[2:05:17.080 --> 2:05:20.240]  Republican establishment with its never Trump movement the Democrat
[2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:25.480]  establishment is never Bernie welcome to crony socialism Democrats should ask
[2:05:25.480 --> 2:05:30.680]  themselves why they want a crooked rigged system to control everything now
[2:05:30.680 --> 2:05:35.680]  crony capitalism can't happen without crony socialism in the GOP they steal
[2:05:35.680 --> 2:05:39.400]  it differently they're the wait until after the election to steal it like in
[2:05:39.400 --> 2:05:43.480]  South Carolina where the voters gave Trump every delegate the Cruz came in

[2:08:35.840 --> 2:08:38.440]  resistance
[2:08:44.520 --> 2:08:49.560]  never before has the establishment both the democrat republican parties shown
[2:08:49.560 --> 2:08:55.320]  us that at the top they are wedded to each other like the Bennett brothers were
[2:08:55.320 --> 2:09:04.160]  one was a democrat ones a republican it's crazy and now we've gotten to a
[2:09:04.160 --> 2:09:08.600]  position where they openly say they're gonna steal the popular vote they're
[2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:11.800]  already doing it in Louisiana in New Hampshire you name it from Bernie
[2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:15.760]  Sanders and Donald Trump now I don't like Bernie Sanders but at least he means
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:21.320]  what he's saying Hillary is just a psychopath obviously and many psychologists
[2:09:21.320 --> 2:09:24.960]  and psychiatrists have analyzed her and say that's exactly what she is but
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:29.040]  stealing the popular vote trying to mainline it like it's okay Donald Trump
[2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:34.080]  pledged to not leave the Republican Party what eight months ago with the
[2:09:34.080 --> 2:09:38.160]  third party as long as they follow their pledge to not try to sabotage him or
[2:09:38.160 --> 2:09:42.200]  shield the nomination which Roger Stone who's just on the last hour warned him
[2:09:42.200 --> 2:09:46.760]  was coming you notice everything Stone talked about coming true so Stone is
[2:09:46.760 --> 2:09:50.240]  accelerating back towards the very top of the campaign I'm just gonna stop right
[2:09:50.240 --> 2:09:53.480]  there and his former business partner has become the top adviser to Trump on
[2:09:53.480 --> 2:10:00.480]  stopping the steal there at the national convention separately the Democrats are
[2:10:00.480 --> 2:10:03.640]  in the news admitting that they're stealing it from Bernie Sanders and the

[2:11:21.800 --> 2:11:26.960]  greatest okay and I have not I've known Roger for a long time I've been in
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:32.600]  politics for a long time this is this is a mess Alex a mess and it has to be
[2:11:32.600 --> 2:11:37.120]  fought absolutely even if I didn't like Trump and I'm loving a few problems but
[2:11:37.120 --> 2:11:41.280]  I love him he's real and populist even if he was bad I would fight to not have
[2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:45.160]  him be robbed I mean this is so out of control what is the power structure
[2:11:45.160 --> 2:11:48.880]  thinking and then why are you supporting Trump and let's talk about your
[2:11:48.880 --> 2:11:53.520]  different plans to try to derail their operation well well the power structure
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:56.920]  I've been fighting the power structure ever since the Buchanan days when I try
[2:11:56.920 --> 2:12:01.920]  to shut up Buchanan down at the convention in Texas okay so I know the
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:07.200]  boys involved I know the boys and got involved at the targeted Jack Camp way
[2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:12.560]  back and they kept him from the vice presidency and they kept him from from
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:16.200]  the presidential campaign was running his campaign then you were involved you
[2:12:16.200 --> 2:12:20.560]  guys have witnessed this over and over again over and over again and I've been
[2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:24.480]  in the background you know I've just been watching and watching I haven't
[2:12:24.480 --> 2:12:31.080]  really had a candidate and but when Trump came on the on the horizon in June
[2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:35.760]  you know and I listen to what he said and a guy strong okay he's successful he
[2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:40.840]  means what he says I'm an ex Jersey guy okay I was born and raised in Jersey he
[2:12:40.840 --> 2:12:45.040]  is a New Yorker and we both have an attitude and I love Trump's attitude I
[2:12:45.040 --> 2:12:48.480]  love it too and I love how the South loves him the media the leftist elite
[2:12:48.480 --> 2:12:51.720]  media always acts like the South of the North hate each other that's pure bull
[2:12:51.720 --> 2:12:56.880]  that's just made up garbage that's a bunch of bull okay it just it just if
[2:12:56.880 --> 2:13:00.280]  people want to know what people on the ground are thinking go to my petition
[2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:06.640]  site and read the comments as of two minutes ago we had 25,000 people that
[2:13:06.640 --> 2:13:10.880]  signed the petition now I started this 10 days ago and it's just me and this
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:16.880]  little old operation here in my home office in New Hampshire okay I put a
[2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:22.040]  Facebook page up I had people come to the Facebook page the dedicated people
[2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:26.320]  I've got a bunch of people the administrators are great and they push
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:31.040]  the petition all over the place and it's already all showing the power showing
[2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:34.760]  the power thousand people absolutely that the grassroots has should they go to
[2:13:34.760 --> 2:13:38.760]  should they go to naggy report comm to find the links to the Facebook and the
[2:13:38.760 --> 2:13:45.000]  rest of it well yes they can go to naggyreport.com and they can go to the
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:52.680]  petition just by typing in we will walk.org or they can go to Facebook and
[2:13:52.680 --> 2:13:58.320]  look for the group but we will walk we have over 2,000 members and every one
[2:13:58.320 --> 2:14:01.960]  of those members are itching for something to do and I'm glad I'm happy to
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:06.360]  hear about the Cleveland mission because this is something that I had on my
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:10.080]  horizon for the now we're doing it stone and I and others are planning it and
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:13.280]  we're gonna go great guys I'm gonna be there for over a week and a half he's
[2:14:13.280 --> 2:14:16.640]  gonna be there for a full month I'm coming I'm gonna be on the ground every
[2:14:16.640 --> 2:14:19.480]  day with my crew we're gonna be the show there every day and it's gonna be big
[2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:24.120]  and we're I mean cuz look if they were stealing it from Bernie Sanders you know
[2:14:24.120 --> 2:14:28.800]  I would go and try to stop it but with it Trump it is so obvious what do you
[2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:31.920]  think the establishment thinks they're getting away with this just seems crazy
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:36.800]  well I don't think they're getting away with anything I think they're
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:40.240]  scared and they're scared because they're gonna lose two things power and
[2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:44.680]  money I mean Trump gets at the top their power and their money goes away and the
[2:14:44.680 --> 2:14:49.040]  Republican Party has this today needs to come down it needs to be put into
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:54.600]  ashes and then resurrected resurrected under Donald Trump how dare of them let
[2:14:54.600 --> 2:14:58.760]  China have 40% tariffs on us with their currency and then Trump says that's not
[2:14:58.760 --> 2:15:03.200]  fair and they call him protectionist it's suicidal for us to have open trade
[2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:07.840]  and they don't that's crazy well you know they said that Trump is not a
[2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:12.280]  conservative okay who do they want him to be a conservative like a conservative
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:17.080]  like Paul Paul Ryan and Mitch Connell who just passed an outrageous budget that
[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:21.520]  both Barack Obama and his minions loved or the
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:25.520]  conservatism of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell who jeopardize our national
[2:15:25.520 --> 2:15:30.360]  security by not protecting our borders from illegal immigration and mob and the
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:35.040]  Muslims that are coming in who could do harm to our country I mean these guys
[2:15:35.040 --> 2:15:40.680]  are delusional and what I call them is the impudent snobs okay the impudent
[2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:48.360]  snobs Bill Crystal Charles crowd hammer Chuck will the national review they
[2:15:48.360 --> 2:15:50.680]  don't know what they're talking about and they don't know what they're coming up
[2:15:50.680 --> 2:15:55.200]  against Alex it looks like the Republican Party establishment's
[2:15:55.200 --> 2:15:57.960]  committing suicide in front of us I mean they were already on their last legs
[2:15:57.960 --> 2:16:04.080]  but man what they're doing is crazy because once again they are shaking in
[2:16:04.080 --> 2:16:09.120]  their boots they have never come up against this you know the people that I
[2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:12.440]  talked to the people on the ground I mean the people that I worked I am an
[2:16:12.440 --> 2:16:18.320]  organizer that's what I do okay I get the job done I say you know in politics
[2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:24.320]  nothing's moved unless it's pushed I push you give me a task and I will go out
[2:16:24.320 --> 2:16:27.640]  and do it I listen to people I talk to people I'm constantly on the phone
[2:16:27.640 --> 2:16:33.040]  people were fed up they've had it they're not going to be told anymore to go
[2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:38.520]  sit in the corner be quiet we will nominate who we want to nominate by
[2:16:38.520 --> 2:16:43.560]  some guy with a chalkboard who appears on Fox News okay this is not going to
[2:16:43.560 --> 2:16:47.400]  happen the people are not going to take it and they're underestimating the people
[2:16:47.400 --> 2:16:53.120]  Alex I agree I've got a AP article here today and several others where the royal
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:57.920]  family of Saudi Arabia has announced they're going to start killing gays who
[2:16:57.920 --> 2:17:01.360]  identify as gay but the left doesn't have a problem with that and they're
[2:17:01.360 --> 2:17:06.080]  firing professors here in the US who simply say we should have you men and
[2:17:06.080 --> 2:17:10.120]  women's rights protected that's okay Saudi government wants to execute gay
[2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:15.760]  people who show their sexuality in public online the left defends that but
[2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:20.000]  then meanwhile wants to fire professors that say we should defend marriage I
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:23.720]  mean what is wrong with the left I mean you know get away from the Republicans
[2:17:23.720 --> 2:17:26.880]  for a minute I always thought of myself as a classical liberal like a Thomas
[2:17:26.880 --> 2:17:29.960]  Jefferson guy I'm a libertarian so I kind of lean Republican because you know
[2:17:29.960 --> 2:17:33.440]  gun issues and stuff like that but what is wrong with the Democrats I mean they
[2:17:33.440 --> 2:17:38.120]  really seem like like mentally ill psychopaths or something well it's not
[2:17:38.120 --> 2:17:41.760]  what's wrong with him it is what they believe they believe that they are
[2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:47.400]  right okay that they are in power and that they will dictate and for the most
[2:17:47.400 --> 2:17:52.680]  part you know America has just sort of oh you know with the PC crap though well
[2:17:52.680 --> 2:17:57.800]  you really can't say this it's time to stand up people are standing up okay and
[2:17:57.800 --> 2:18:03.000]  we say we've had enough and we have someone in Donald Trump Trump who is the
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:06.840]  leader and who is saying the same things you know I watch him give press
[2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:09.520]  conferences he's been on the show course but I watched him do like an hour
[2:18:09.520 --> 2:18:12.560]  long press conference on his plane he's really telling people what he thinks
[2:18:12.560 --> 2:18:16.840]  he's really talking to those reporters he's really a real guy it's freaking
[2:18:16.840 --> 2:18:21.040]  them out and they're trying what they're trying to do with the talking heads on
[2:18:21.040 --> 2:18:25.920]  the morning the political consultants who have never won a campaign and what I
[2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:31.560]  call the Valley girl consultants okay if you look at them it's everybody that
[2:18:31.560 --> 2:18:37.440]  just has to go to oh Trump is always mad and he's talking about this and they
[2:18:37.440 --> 2:18:41.960]  never talked about Trump talking about the issues what he stands for they
[2:18:41.960 --> 2:18:44.960]  lie and say he doesn't have issues and I kind of bought into that of six months
[2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:49.840]  ago looking he is all about issues they just don't show what he says no because
[2:18:49.840 --> 2:18:54.120]  they have to attack him personally and they and they just can't I'll tell you

[2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:17.360]  there for at least a week and a half two weeks Roger Stone's gonna be there
[2:24:17.360 --> 2:24:22.200]  reporting for him for worse.com and other folks for a month this is gonna be big
[2:24:22.200 --> 2:24:25.720]  and all over the world we see crazy turmoil but we've got a guy who comes
[2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:29.400]  highly recommended obviously from Roger Stone and others who I was fully aware
[2:24:29.400 --> 2:24:33.560]  of back in the Pat Buchanan days I'd see him on TV when I was involved in
[2:24:33.560 --> 2:24:38.480]  Pat Buchanan's last two campaigns and I saw them stealing the votes from him in
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:42.840]  Austin Texas where almost all of the people in the primary were for him but
[2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:47.640]  he you know didn't even get 10% in Travis County I saw him steal Arizona the
[2:24:47.640 --> 2:24:51.040]  crazy part is it comes out they're stealing it and the media says no they
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:55.840]  didn't steal it well this time they're openly stealing it and so Paul Nagy of
[2:24:55.840 --> 2:25:00.640]  wewillwalk.org is organizing just the last few weeks a movement that's
[2:25:00.640 --> 2:25:05.560]  already gotten really big to walk if they do this so explain the plan why
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:11.240]  you're doing it and why folks should get involved Paul. Well the plan is why I'm
[2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:16.160]  doing it is that when I first started out this is this is about the country
[2:25:16.160 --> 2:25:20.200]  okay it's a movement it's a movement that's starting to form that actually
[2:25:20.200 --> 2:25:25.480]  transcends the Trump individually okay and if the Republican Party continues
[2:25:25.480 --> 2:25:29.760]  in its effort to prevent Trump from the nomination which he is clearly winning
[2:25:29.760 --> 2:25:34.000]  against the you know unprecedented intervention unprecedented intervention
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:39.760]  by the party power brokers and the elitists then we will leave the party
[2:25:39.760 --> 2:25:46.040]  and that is what the threat is if they tamper with Trump or if they sabotage
[2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:50.600]  him but then we will leave the party we will set this out but you know that's
[2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:57.000]  not going to happen. The movement here is to keep growing and to keep
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:02.120]  collecting those petitions and keep collecting the names to be able to give
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:07.000]  you guys by the time we get to the convention you know I'm shooting for
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:11.240]  one half million people. That's it we need to have a big credible dagger at
[2:26:11.240 --> 2:26:15.520]  their throat to respond to them if they try to steal the election. Now I have
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:20.560]  breaking news right now because I'm on my other computer and I'm talking to my
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:24.760]  administrators of the group of Facebook okay and what they're telling me is
[2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:29.640]  that Facebook is restricting any of the posts from our site that go to the
[2:26:29.640 --> 2:26:34.320]  signature site. That happens to us too. Give us your Facebook stuff folks and get around that.
[2:26:34.320 --> 2:26:38.080]  Right and they're starting to notice stuff that's okay we'll get around that.
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:44.680]  I mean that isn't a problem I mean bring it on it's it's just so as I was
[2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:52.000]  saying I started this 10 days ago and I thought to myself you know it just it
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:57.360]  can't go on and we probably can power brokers can't determine how this plays
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:27:02.920]  out. Rovin and company think that well you know everybody's going to sit
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:06.400]  home and eventually they're going to come around to it. No that's not going to
[2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:12.400]  happen again. Okay what they're doing is that is they are pushing us out of
[2:27:12.400 --> 2:27:18.000]  Atwater's Big Tent okay when we want to come into the Republican Party and we
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:21.400]  want to help to change it they're pushing us out. That's right he's swelling the
[2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:24.720]  Republican Party into the populist party it's supposed to be and these blue
[2:27:24.720 --> 2:27:29.520]  blood establishment people are trying to restrict it. They are outrageously arrogant.
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:35.800]  Absolutely outrageous. Have you I'm sure you've heard some of these people. I mean
[2:27:35.800 --> 2:27:41.240]  we will make the nomination it is who we know. They've had the guy that runs the
[2:27:41.240 --> 2:27:46.400]  rules committee on the election what is his name Curley whatever on TV saying
[2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:51.160]  your vote doesn't count stop voting we make the choice. Well there there is
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:54.640]  strengthen numbers and we will show them numbers. Well I agree with you they're
[2:27:54.640 --> 2:27:58.960]  scared that's why they're acting so cocky. Yeah they're showing their hand.
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:04.760]  Well folks go to wewillwalk.org or nagyreport.com and get involved there
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:09.320]  and as you said we need to have a big organized movement you know pointing
[2:28:09.320 --> 2:28:14.000]  that out ready for Trump to walk and then in the general election debates he
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:17.320]  will destroy them. But speaking of the libertarians and I know we're talking
[2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:20.120]  we're not talking about we're just talking about building the threat but
[2:28:20.120 --> 2:28:24.560]  I'm telling you he has a shot as the libertarians are in 48 states. He would
[2:28:24.560 --> 2:28:27.800]  I think in a general election with libertarians is the only candidate that
[2:28:27.800 --> 2:28:30.960]  could win for them. He would probably beat the Democrats in the Republican
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:37.520]  three-way race. I agree with that. I agree with that. And so so so that is a
[2:28:37.520 --> 2:28:43.320]  vehicle that's a choice. I mean that is an option. I know Ventura has been
[2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:47.080]  offered to compete for it but he says he won't do it if it's Trump or Sanders he
[2:28:47.080 --> 2:28:51.360]  will of its Hillary or Cruz because they're so establishment but I'm
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:54.000]  telling you Trump's got some real options on his hands here this is an
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:59.360]  incredible time Paul. This is this is an incredible time you know I'm a little
[2:28:59.360 --> 2:29:05.480]  older guy here you know and and I just I just want to go out with a political
[2:29:05.480 --> 2:29:10.880]  bank too and and and I think it's going to happen this time. Like I said people
[2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:15.000]  need to go to the petition site and if they don't do anything at all read the
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:20.920]  comments from from 25,000 people that have signed this position that is the
[2:29:20.920 --> 2:29:24.880]  petition and every one of these petitions have been emailed and are
[2:29:24.880 --> 2:29:28.800]  sure where's the best place to go for the petition we will walk.org. We will
[2:29:28.800 --> 2:29:33.080]  walk.org and we'll take you right to the petition. All right Paul we salute you
[2:29:33.080 --> 2:29:36.640]  we'll talk to you again soon God bless and I'll see you there in Ohio I'm gonna
[2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:41.440]  be there covering the whole thing and I wear my bias openly I'm promoting the
[2:29:41.440 --> 2:29:45.440]  popular vote I'm promoting freedom I'm promoting Trump the Second Amendment the
[2:29:45.440 --> 2:29:49.680]  whole nine yards down with political correctness. We're on the march the
[2:29:49.680 --> 2:29:59.840]  Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network as the Supreme Court
[2:29:59.840 --> 2:30:04.800]  wrestles with whether or not it will compel nuns to buy abortion insurance. It
[2:30:04.800 --> 2:30:10.320]  should be a reminder of how absurd it is to trust our liberty to nine political
[2:30:10.320 --> 2:30:14.840]  appointees who believe the Constitution can be amended by their opinions.
[2:30:14.840 --> 2:30:19.200]  NBC News reports that a quarter of Republican senators now want to meet
[2:30:19.200 --> 2:30:23.200]  with Obama's Supreme Court nominee. Much has been said about Obama's nominee
[2:30:23.200 --> 2:30:26.920]  Merrick Garland's record opposing the Second Amendment. What hasn't been talked
[2:30:26.920 --> 2:30:31.080]  about is his long record of rubber stamping any rule from any federal
[2:30:31.080 --> 2:30:35.840]  regulatory agency. Garland will be a reliable ally of the real government
[2:30:35.840 --> 2:30:40.600]  federal bureaucracies. With Scalia's death the Supreme Court is expected to be
[2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:45.240]  deadlocked on Obama's EPA regulations to shut down the coal industry. The lower
[2:30:45.240 --> 2:30:50.040]  court on which Garland now serves will have the final say. He will take
[2:30:50.040 --> 2:30:53.960]  Scalia's place on this important issue regardless of whether he takes Scalia's
[2:30:53.960 --> 2:30:57.960]  place on the court. For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[2:30:57.960 --> 2:31:00.960]  Uh yeah, first of all I want to say,
[2:31:00.960 --> 2:31:06.400]  Secret 12 X2 Supermail, BrainForce, Plastic Art, Silver Bullet. I use them all. They're
[2:31:06.400 --> 2:31:11.360]  phenomenal. They work by InfoWars. Thank you brother. Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[2:31:11.360 --> 2:31:16.640]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm a quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[2:31:16.640 --> 2:31:21.080]  products. Welcome to the InfoWars. It's so easy to get these incredible
[2:31:21.080 --> 2:31:24.800]  nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWars at the same time.
[2:31:24.800 --> 2:31:27.520]  I'm a nine-year listener by all the nutraceuticals,
[2:31:27.520 --> 2:31:31.600]  Casio FX, Mason I-9. Right, God, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[2:31:31.600 --> 2:31:35.680]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life. What products are you taking?
[2:31:35.680 --> 2:31:43.000]  Everything from Supermail to BrainForce to Wintersun X2. Even got a little a
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:46.800]  DNA force so when I just re-upped everything and I just went to

[2:31:57.800 --> 2:32:02.880]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has
[2:32:02.880 --> 2:32:06.800]  been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known
[2:32:06.800 --> 2:32:11.200]  for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government
[2:32:11.200 --> 2:32:15.680]  knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad
[2:32:15.680 --> 2:32:19.720]  member of the halogen family, into the water. They took the good halogen in and
[2:32:19.720 --> 2:32:24.200]  put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still
[2:32:24.200 --> 2:32:27.880]  is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your
[2:32:27.880 --> 2:32:33.320]  family. Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the
[2:32:33.320 --> 2:32:38.080]  connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could
[2:32:38.080 --> 2:32:42.080]  be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these
[2:32:42.080 --> 2:32:46.040]  studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine
[2:32:46.040 --> 2:32:51.000]  is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival

[2:32:59.320 --> 2:33:17.240]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones. By the way, one
[2:33:17.240 --> 2:33:20.640]  of the great crew, Matt, just pointed out this bumper sticker that showed up here at
[2:33:20.640 --> 2:33:29.280]  the office. That is awesome. And it's actually homemade, so I know who local
[2:33:29.280 --> 2:33:34.160]  patriots made it, Banana Bay Technical Trading Co. It's an Army Navy store. Who
[2:33:34.160 --> 2:33:43.440]  would Al Qaeda vote for? Then they wrote ISIL, ISIS, IS out to it. That's all the
[2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:47.680]  globalists, George Soros and others, that ran the year of spring, trying to
[2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:52.320]  confuse everybody about the fact that the West was backing Al Qaeda. Four years
[2:33:52.320 --> 2:33:55.480]  ago, they panicked as it was coming out, and our military said we're not gonna be
[2:33:55.480 --> 2:33:58.600]  part of this. So they created all these other names to confuse people. It's
[2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:05.040]  Wahhabist Saudi Arabia, folks. Look at my hands. Look at my hands. I will just go
[2:34:05.040 --> 2:34:09.640]  ahead and show that. Look at that. I haven't had calluses since I was in
[2:34:09.640 --> 2:34:14.520]  college from Winston-Wates, and that's a super male vitality and anthroplex in
[2:34:14.520 --> 2:34:18.840]  next Tuesday. I was deadlifting like, I don't know, was it 400 pounds a day? And
[2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:23.320]  what was scary was it wasn't even hard to do, except it was tearing the skin off
[2:34:23.320 --> 2:34:28.360]  my hands. So I'm gonna try to get up to 500 pounds, which isn't that much, but
[2:34:28.360 --> 2:34:31.360]  I don't know. They have the Undertaker does it on TV, 500, and they put it on
[2:34:31.360 --> 2:34:37.640]  ESPN. So I'm gonna try to do 500 in a month. And then in about six months, I
[2:34:37.640 --> 2:34:46.040]  want to deadlift 600, because that's the kind of stuff people want to see, I
[2:34:46.040 --> 2:34:51.760]  guess. It's sure excited my personal trainer. So it's not that much weight. I
[2:34:51.760 --> 2:34:58.280]  could squat 600 pounds when I was 20. Bench Press 350. Totally natural. That's
[2:34:58.280 --> 2:35:01.200]  not that strong. I weighed like 185 pounds, though. So for my weight, I was
[2:35:01.200 --> 2:35:06.560]  very strong. Now we're like 235 or so, and man, I'm getting another heavy weight,
[2:35:06.560 --> 2:35:10.280]  and it is awesome. And in contrary to popular belief, my muscles are getting
[2:35:10.280 --> 2:35:14.400]  a little bigger, but the fat is just draining off of me. Maybe we'll have a
[2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:17.680]  weightlifting contest here at the office. We'll see who can squat the most, who
[2:35:17.680 --> 2:35:22.000]  can bench the most, who can, I can't bench like I used to. My shoulder hurts.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:28.640]  Anything above like 250, you just, it's easy to push, but my body in the joint
[2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:32.160]  just won't do it. So you take more of the in-force life joint formula. It's quite
[2:35:32.160 --> 2:35:35.120]  frankly, we made it for folks that have joint problems. I haven't taken it yet.
[2:35:35.120 --> 2:35:40.280]  I want to get in the news right now, and I want to open the phones up. The toll-free
[2:35:40.280 --> 2:35:50.680]  number on everything we've covered today, wide-open free-for-all, 800-259-9231-800-259-9231,
[2:35:50.680 --> 2:35:58.040]  and we will get you up and on the air today. But before I go any further, I
[2:35:58.040 --> 2:36:03.040]  realized that in the first hour today for TV viewers, I kind of messed up because
[2:36:03.040 --> 2:36:07.200]  we had a whole warehouse, so this has just came in. I was going, man, this sure
[2:36:07.200 --> 2:36:11.360]  seems little to Anthony, with the vitamin mineral fusion, advanced
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:15.000]  multi-vitamin formulation. He goes, well, don't worry, you know, see it, you know,
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:18.360]  versus, you know, other leading brands, it has this as much or more. It's
[2:36:18.360 --> 2:36:22.160]  concentrated. And I said, yeah, but seems like that's small all of a sudden. And then
[2:36:22.160 --> 2:36:27.280]  they run over here and go, no, you're right. It's twice the size. Sorry. Okay.
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:33.280]  There you go. It's like, did this get smaller or did my hand get smaller? Am I
[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:38.480]  turning into Donald Trump? I mean, sarcastic. But this really is the very,
[2:36:38.480 --> 2:36:45.800]  very best nutraceutical vitamin mineral blend with amino acids and other
[2:36:45.800 --> 2:36:50.480]  trace elements we can come up with for the price. And the taste is amazing. My
[2:36:50.480 --> 2:36:53.600]  kids absolutely love it. We're going to rob you for just a second before we go to
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:57.880]  your calls. And he's in Wisconsin covering things. All the videos are on
[2:36:57.880 --> 2:37:03.320]  infowords.com of what's been happening. But we have our own nutraceutical line,
[2:37:03.320 --> 2:37:08.680]  whether it's X2 or lung cleanse, or whether it's the oxy powder to flush out
[2:37:08.680 --> 2:37:12.520]  the upper and lower intestine, or whether it's brain force, we set out to make
[2:37:12.520 --> 2:37:17.160]  the very best new tropic with known compounds that in a healthy way boost
[2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:22.520]  brain activity and overall enjoyment. A few of the ingredients are prescription
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:26.400]  Europe. And we are basically half the price of the quote leading competitor.
[2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:28.960]  And I call him a leading competitor because they called me up about three
[2:37:28.960 --> 2:37:32.240]  months ago and they said, well, you notice your new tropics really good. It's got a
[2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:35.440]  lot of our stuff, but some other stuff. Yeah, it's really good. It's better than
[2:37:35.440 --> 2:37:39.160]  ours. And you're selling it for half the price. Why are you doing that? Same
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:45.400]  serving size. And I said, I'm not your competitor. Supplements are like a 10
[2:37:45.400 --> 2:37:48.760]  million dollar a year business. It's growing exponentially. I'm not in
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:55.440]  competition with you. I had another sponsor call me and say your DNA force
[2:37:55.440 --> 2:38:04.000]  is an incredible, you know, DNA telomere, mitochondrial DNA booster, certified
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:10.760]  bio PQQ, CoQ10, the best forms of it. We have a product like that. I'm like, yeah,
[2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:13.960]  welcome to planet Earth. There's a hundred brands of orange juice. Yeah, but
[2:38:13.960 --> 2:38:18.720]  yours is so good. That's why it is so popular. But you're not in competition.
[2:38:18.720 --> 2:38:22.240]  And the crazy thing about me is I still promote other great brands and things
[2:38:22.240 --> 2:38:26.920]  that are sponsors. It's just welcome to America and the world. I'm going to
[2:38:26.920 --> 2:38:32.240]  promote my own stuff as well because we want to develop our own. We want to come
[2:38:32.240 --> 2:38:35.120]  out with the best stuff. We want to go to the biggest manufacturers with the
[2:38:35.120 --> 2:38:39.320]  highest quality and come up with game changers. That's what we do. It's a free
[2:38:39.320 --> 2:38:44.160]  country. We're doing it. But there are just so many great
[2:38:44.160 --> 2:38:50.760]  nutraceuticals out there. What we can't crack is whey. Whey has so many scams, so
[2:38:50.760 --> 2:38:55.680]  many problems, so many tests, so many issues that I don't promote whey because
[2:38:55.680 --> 2:38:59.040]  it's just so hard to give you the very best stuff. I'm doing some research. I'm
[2:38:59.040 --> 2:39:03.120]  trying, but it is, it is just a minefield. But when it comes to vitamin
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:07.600]  mineral fusion of all the basic vitamins, all the minerals, all the trace
[2:39:07.600 --> 2:39:11.400]  elements, the amino acids, all of it fused together with a great fruit punch
[2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:17.920]  flavor that's natural from the ingredients that are in it, this is the
[2:39:17.920 --> 2:39:22.400]  ultimate. $39.95. Leading quote competitors are twice that amount or more.
[2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:28.480]  This is amazing. It's concentrated. This is so important for children because it
[2:39:28.480 --> 2:39:35.000]  is liquid, so it's absorbable. And again, I'm talking about other sponsors and
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:37.800]  people. I'll just throw this out there. The stuff at InfoWarsHealth.com is
[2:39:37.800 --> 2:39:41.640]  excellent as well. I endorse it. I love it. Polymers, Beyond Tangy Tangerine,
[2:39:41.640 --> 2:39:45.240]  OsteoFX. I mean, quite frankly, it costs more, but it's probably better than our
[2:39:45.240 --> 2:39:48.640]  bone and joint formula. The OsteoFX stuff that Young Jevity has that I
[2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:52.040]  sell at InfoWarsHealth.com because we looked into it. It's so proprietary, so
[2:39:52.040 --> 2:39:55.800]  powerful. Their bone and joint stuff, I think, is the best stuff they've got.
[2:39:55.800 --> 2:39:59.680]  That's like game changer level that is, I don't even know how they sell it for that
[2:39:59.680 --> 2:40:03.920]  price. So you get it at InfoWarsHealth.com. That's what we do, is that we come out with
[2:40:03.920 --> 2:40:08.320]  our base high-quality products to fund the operation and to help the listeners.
[2:40:08.320 --> 2:40:12.080]  And then we also promote the very best sponsors, the very best quality out there
[2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:17.840]  at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[2:40:17.840 --> 2:40:21.920]  It looks like we just, I'm sorry, we just had people grabbing at the camera and
[2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:27.000]  MacGee homying and things. It looked aggressive. I missed part of it with
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:30.360]  people going in. Some of these are Trump supporters. Looked like some anti-Trump
[2:40:30.360 --> 2:40:35.960]  people getting in RobDoo's face. I'm not sure what I just saw. They're in Wisconsin,
[2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:41.160]  moving around. They were in Janesville yesterday. Where are you today, RobDoo and
[2:40:41.160 --> 2:40:42.680]  crew? Thank you for joining us.
[2:40:42.680 --> 2:40:45.880]  Hey, I'm in Appleton, Wisconsin right now. I just had a supporter just said,
[2:40:45.880 --> 2:40:50.120]  thank you for being here. Alex, those were actually virulent Trump supporters and
[2:40:50.120 --> 2:40:51.560]  InfoWars fans, all at the same time.
[2:40:51.560 --> 2:40:54.880]  Oh, so they were so excited. It looked like they were attacking. Okay, I love that.
[2:40:54.880 --> 2:40:55.720]  They knew who I was.
[2:40:55.720 --> 2:40:59.240]  Like you think a woman's against you as she tears her clothes off. Okay, I get it.
[2:40:59.240 --> 2:41:02.680]  Exactly. So I was like, ah, let me get a picture. Let me get a picture.
[2:41:02.680 --> 2:41:06.600]  This is what's going on right now. You can see the protesters across the street.
[2:41:06.600 --> 2:41:09.400]  Maybe less than 100. I should have known they're Trump supporters because they
[2:41:09.400 --> 2:41:12.600]  don't look like they're dead. I mean, the black line didn't matter. The Trump
[2:41:12.600 --> 2:41:16.120]  supporters only they've been putting, you know, you know, Valhalla compared to the
[2:41:16.120 --> 2:41:18.520]  folks only they've been putting the microwave. I mean, I'm sorry, but the
[2:41:18.520 --> 2:41:22.120]  anti-Trump people really are ugly. Sorry, go ahead.
[2:41:22.120 --> 2:41:26.600]  They're a motley bunch. That's for sure. But everybody I met today in the Trump
[2:41:26.600 --> 2:41:30.520]  line, very nice, even though we got a little rain going on.
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:33.960]  It's a lot of high school students that are here anti-Trumpers. So
[2:41:33.960 --> 2:41:37.160]  people who haven't paid taxes, haven't lived in the real world, so they don't
[2:41:37.160 --> 2:41:41.000]  know what it's like yet. And except this lady, so
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:44.200]  so she's got her sciences. Does this ass make me look fat?
[2:41:44.200 --> 2:41:47.080]  Now, do you think that's promoting love?
[2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:51.400]  I'm not claiming to promote love. I'm claiming to promote the truth. And it is
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:57.640]  that he really kind of is an ass. He is just very derogatory when it comes to
[2:41:57.640 --> 2:42:00.280]  how he speaks of women. Ask her if it's okay if the Saudis
[2:42:00.280 --> 2:42:02.280]  talk gay people's heads off. They announced that today.
[2:42:02.280 --> 2:42:04.840]  The LGBT community, frankly, how he speaks to other
[2:42:04.840 --> 2:42:07.400]  candidates. Does she have a problem with the Saudis shopping
[2:42:07.400 --> 2:42:12.280]  women's heads off, gay heads off? So let me ask you about this real quick.
[2:42:12.280 --> 2:42:15.800]  Today, it came out Saudi Arabia that they want to, they said they're going to kill
[2:42:15.800 --> 2:42:19.400]  gay people. They're going to get the death penalty in that country. That's a
[2:42:19.400 --> 2:42:22.440]  primarily Muslim nation. What do you think about that? And then Trump
[2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:24.600]  has come out and said, yeah, we need to vet Muslims better.
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:27.320]  But then you have other countries. So what's wrong? Stop and get your
[2:42:27.320 --> 2:42:31.000]  heads off and don't let these killers in. I don't
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:35.160]  think it's ever okay to kill people based on their sexual identity or sexual
[2:42:35.160 --> 2:42:40.200]  preference. Because the leaders of Saudi Arabia want
[2:42:40.200 --> 2:42:43.880]  to kill gay people, that we will condemn all of the citizens of Saudi
[2:42:43.880 --> 2:42:47.320]  Arabia and be foolish enough to think that they believe that.
[2:42:47.320 --> 2:42:50.200]  We have leaders who have disagreed with the past.
[2:42:50.200 --> 2:42:53.400]  I'm sure there are Saudi Arabia people who disagree with their leaders.
[2:42:53.400 --> 2:42:57.320]  Oh, so bring them on in. Do we give them free everything?
[2:42:57.320 --> 2:42:59.960]  All right, thank you. Thanks for, you were, you were live on the air with them.
[2:42:59.960 --> 2:43:02.760]  Oh my god, I can't listen to her. Could go talk. We talked to those people
[2:43:02.760 --> 2:43:05.400]  yesterday. I can't handle it. Let's talk to some Trump supporters.
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:08.120]  Let's talk some Trumps. I got, I got three lovely ladies right here with
[2:43:08.120 --> 2:43:10.600]  Trump hats on. You all want to be on TV?
[2:43:10.600 --> 2:43:15.880]  All right. So tell me why you like Donald Trump.
[2:43:15.880 --> 2:43:22.760]  Well, come on, you're live on TV right now. Oh,
[2:43:22.760 --> 2:43:28.040]  I like Trump because he's conservative and he tells you what's up.
[2:43:28.040 --> 2:43:31.720]  So you like him? I don't know if that Western girl looks like her, but
[2:43:31.720 --> 2:43:35.640]  she kind of looks bad. He takes the PC to terminology to the court.
[2:43:35.640 --> 2:43:41.400]  Yeah, pretty much. Sorry. Yep. All right, see you.
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:45.240]  I don't want to talk. Silent Trump supporters. We got a couple ladies over
[2:43:45.240 --> 2:43:47.240]  here. Hey, y'all want to talk and be on camera?
[2:43:47.240 --> 2:43:50.120]  It's all right. We're all, we all got. Oh, they're just cutie cakes.
[2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:53.240]  Hey, seriously, get there if they think you're a hip because you got long hair.
[2:43:53.240 --> 2:43:56.920]  They're coming. All right. You want to talk about Donald Trump?
[2:43:56.920 --> 2:43:59.640]  All right. Tell them you're here with the rebellion. You're here to help.
[2:43:59.640 --> 2:44:03.480]  They're scared because you, you, you're a good looking liberal dude.
[2:44:03.480 --> 2:44:07.000]  You're not a liberal, you're a patriot, but you look like, you know, the dude and they
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:09.320]  don't like him. You think that's what it is?
[2:44:09.320 --> 2:44:13.080]  Yeah, they're a little P-brained as well. Yeah, that happens.
[2:44:13.080 --> 2:44:17.080]  Probably saying who Trump is going to talk to. Right here. This guy wants to make
[2:44:17.080 --> 2:44:19.800]  America great. There you go. Exactly. That's why we're here.
[2:44:19.800 --> 2:44:23.080]  So why are you here for Donald Trump? I don't know. I just support America.
[2:44:23.080 --> 2:44:27.960]  That's all I support. And I'm tired of the 545 politicians
[2:44:27.960 --> 2:44:31.240]  in this United States that can't do anything. They can't paint against
[2:44:31.240 --> 2:44:35.320]  everything that they did. You know what I'm saying? They want better education,
[2:44:35.320 --> 2:44:38.440]  but they can't fix it, right? But they have the power to fix it.
[2:44:38.440 --> 2:44:41.800]  They want better immigration laws, but they can't fix it, but they can.
[2:44:41.800 --> 2:44:46.200]  They have the power. 535 people in the United States have the power
[2:44:46.200 --> 2:44:50.600]  to fix this. Hey, hey, how you doing? No, they won't do it because they can't,
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:53.720]  because they're sixth grade children and they can't fix the problem.
[2:44:53.720 --> 2:44:57.880]  Yeah, they'd rather fight about issues. They're more paid for by foreign interest.
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:03.400]  That's the thing. That's what makes me mad. So I think everybody that's in line right here is
[2:45:03.400 --> 2:45:06.680]  just tired of- Good job. Let's go talk to some more folks.
[2:45:06.680 --> 2:45:10.760]  Just ask folks, why do you like Trump? There you go. All right. Thanks, buddy.
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:13.800]  I'm going to go talk to some more people. Thanks for talking. This is in-
[2:45:13.800 --> 2:45:15.320]  All right. Now, I'm back on-
[2:45:15.320 --> 2:45:18.520]  Appleton response to President McCarthy's Trump.
[2:45:19.640 --> 2:45:24.440]  I don't like- Yeah, they're afraid of the media. Tell them we're not within this NBC.
[2:45:24.440 --> 2:45:27.720]  All right. This guy will talk. Hey, how's it going? Good. I watch Info Wars all the time.
[2:45:27.720 --> 2:45:31.000]  He's a big Info Wars fan. So tell me why you like Trump. Well, we do like him for
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:33.560]  latter reasons. I don't have any specifics, but we're going to go in and find out.
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:37.000]  That's why I wait in line all day. So I'm really excited to hear him talk.
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:40.360]  So how do you feel about it? It looks like the Republican Party hates this guy's guts.
[2:45:40.360 --> 2:45:43.720]  They do not want him to get the nomination, and it looks like they may even try to steal it from.
[2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:48.120]  How do you feel about that? I think they hate his guts because they think that America is turning
[2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:51.320]  into a nursing home where everyone needs to be taken care of. I think that we should take care
[2:45:51.320 --> 2:45:57.320]  of ourselves and stand up for ourselves. Spoken like a true American. Absolutely. You can talk to
[2:45:57.320 --> 2:46:02.520]  this guy. What do you like Donald Trump? I'm not sure who I'm pointing for yet. Just here to participate
[2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:05.560]  in the poll. That's a key point. A lot of folks are just coming to hear and people attack him.
[2:46:05.560 --> 2:46:08.680]  Talk to him about that. That's interesting. Alex, Alex, you'd be surprised. I've met a lot of
[2:46:08.680 --> 2:46:11.720]  people in this line who are just like, we don't know. We want to see what he has to say.
[2:46:11.720 --> 2:46:15.720]  So what about America right now? Do you think needs to be fixed or worked on or what's wrong
[2:46:15.720 --> 2:46:21.320]  with America? Well, I think we have to come up with reasonable solutions for healthcare,
[2:46:21.320 --> 2:46:29.560]  reasonable solutions for education costs. And I think that we just need to continue to work
[2:46:29.560 --> 2:46:34.120]  on our tax code, make sure we create jobs. Pay more taxes or less taxes?
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:42.200]  Proper allocation of the taxes. So is he more of a liberal libertarian or how does he identify?
[2:46:42.760 --> 2:46:46.600]  Repair infrastructure. All right. Do you identify as a conservative,
[2:46:46.600 --> 2:46:51.560]  libertarian, liberal? What's your political identity? Generally a conservative.
[2:46:53.080 --> 2:46:57.000]  Awesome, brother. Let's talk to his girlfriend. All right. All right. I don't know if that's
[2:46:57.000 --> 2:47:01.880]  as good. You want to talk? I'm getting Alex Jones in my ear right now. I said he wanted to talk to
[2:47:01.880 --> 2:47:07.480]  you. Why are you here? What do you like about Trump? I don't want to talk. I'll ask her.
[2:47:07.480 --> 2:47:11.640]  She was going to check him out. How are you doing? Watch y'all die. All right. There's our fan back
[2:47:11.640 --> 2:47:16.440]  here. I've got some young guys here. One of them's got a Democrat pen on and a Trump. So who are
[2:47:16.440 --> 2:47:20.920]  you here to support? Well, I'm not here to support Trump. I'm just kind of here to observe today.
[2:47:22.200 --> 2:47:26.120]  Are you old enough to vote? No. Yeah. I won't vote in the primaries. So a lot of folks are just
[2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:31.560]  checking it out. Exactly. People are checking it out. Look, look at the line.
[2:47:31.560 --> 2:47:35.640]  Alex, it's all the way, and they've already been letting people in for about 45 minutes.
[2:47:35.640 --> 2:47:41.720]  Have them scream Valhalla to say Valhalla. All right. On three, I want you guys to say Valhalla.
[2:47:41.720 --> 2:47:49.320]  One, two, three. Valhalla. Valhalla. Here's one of these teams. One, two, three. Valhalla.
[2:47:49.320 --> 2:47:52.920]  That's not just the end of the Runway movie. I always said that. They ripped it off.
[2:47:52.920 --> 2:48:01.960]  Valhalla. That's where we go when we die. We're going to heaven. Donald Trump's up there. All right,
[2:48:01.960 --> 2:48:06.280]  let's talk to some more of them. All right. Hey, how are you supporting Donald Trump?
[2:48:06.920 --> 2:48:13.800]  Well, I honestly support him because I'm a sensualist. I lean both ways, but he was a Democrat.
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:17.400]  That's a good point. He's popular. That's true. That's why they hate him. He's got some good ideas,
[2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:24.440]  but I honestly think that how he looks now is how he's going to look for the general election.
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:30.680]  That's just not how it's going to go down. He's going to be right in the center. He's going to show.
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:39.560]  He's already shown it, but he's not a huge gun fan, which I'm not a huge gun fan. I own some, but...
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:44.200]  Well, you're doing a lot more than a lot of other people are if you're owning guns.
[2:48:44.200 --> 2:48:50.440]  That I am, but I don't support giant clips, machine gun clips, being...
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:48:55.320]  Yeah, but criminals are going to have whatever. Okay, that guy doesn't want my brain. Let's find the next guy.
[2:48:56.040 --> 2:48:59.880]  That they are, but that's why we have to trust in our government a little bit.
[2:48:59.880 --> 2:49:01.880]  That's right. We need the government to stick their hands
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:04.600]  versus make sure there's not bombs in our...
[2:49:04.600 --> 2:49:07.560]  All right. Thank God. I think Trump's going to leave the charge out now.
[2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:09.960]  All right. I think Trump's going to leave the charge. All right.
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:15.720]  Let's get a few more people in here. All right. Hey, how are you guys doing? Ah, look at that.
[2:49:15.720 --> 2:49:17.240]  They shy away from the camera.
[2:49:17.240 --> 2:49:20.920]  I think, well, you do. They're a little in their own stereotypical world, too.
[2:49:20.920 --> 2:49:23.080]  You know, you're a... You got a beard. You got long hair.
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:26.440]  Free speech. Supports free speech.
[2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:27.080]  That's why I support Trump.
[2:49:27.080 --> 2:49:30.120]  As soon as you like the fact that Trump is going after political correctness.
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:32.600]  Look, I've kind of talked to enough of them, giant line,
[2:49:32.600 --> 2:49:35.480]  but do I want to talk to you about what you've witnessed the last few days?
[2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:38.680]  Let's go back to Rob do. Rob, let's get you on camera, my friend.
[2:49:38.680 --> 2:49:42.040]  All right. My little green friend.
[2:49:42.600 --> 2:49:45.800]  I've been waiting for this a long time. Go ahead.
[2:49:45.800 --> 2:49:47.800]  Can't see. These are the protesters behind me.
[2:49:47.800 --> 2:49:50.120]  You know, this morning, the protests were quiet.
[2:49:50.120 --> 2:49:53.800]  We went to one. I swear, these kids were probably on Valium or Xanax.
[2:49:53.800 --> 2:49:56.360]  You asked. I saw the video. It's like they look like they've been nerve-gassed.
[2:49:56.360 --> 2:49:58.440]  Let's say, look, this lady just called me a racist.
[2:49:59.160 --> 2:49:59.960]  Ma'am. Let's talk to her.
[2:49:59.960 --> 2:50:00.920]  You called me a racist?
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:04.120]  He said, Trump is a racist, so are you.
[2:50:04.120 --> 2:50:04.840]  Skip the break.
[2:50:04.840 --> 2:50:06.120]  Oh, you're talking to the crowd.
[2:50:06.120 --> 2:50:07.800]  Let's talk to this walnut. Let's hear from her.
[2:50:07.800 --> 2:50:08.920]  They're voting for Trump.
[2:50:08.920 --> 2:50:10.040]  All right. She doesn't want to talk.
[2:50:10.040 --> 2:50:10.600]  No, go back to that.
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:11.640]  She just wants to yell things out.
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:14.200]  These are like mindless bots running around saying racism.
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:15.880]  I'm only screwed over by Obama.
[2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:16.680]  I'm a racist.
[2:50:16.680 --> 2:50:17.560]  There we go. Look at that.
[2:50:17.560 --> 2:50:20.440]  Mollon Robby. M4wars.com shirt.
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:24.360]  Look at that. Trump fan. It's like Captain America.
[2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:27.160]  I'm Captain America. Watch out, Trump.
[2:50:28.680 --> 2:50:30.280]  Look at Hillary for prison shirt.
[2:50:30.280 --> 2:50:31.480]  Look at that. Yeah.
[2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:33.320]  So why are you a Trump fan?
[2:50:33.960 --> 2:50:35.720]  I like what he's going to do for America.
[2:50:35.720 --> 2:50:37.560]  I think he's going to make America great again.
[2:50:37.560 --> 2:50:41.080]  And I believe that America has an opportunity
[2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:42.200]  if he steps in the office.
[2:50:42.200 --> 2:50:43.720]  Awesome. Let's talk to a storyline.
[2:50:43.720 --> 2:50:45.320]  Let's talk to this lady.
[2:50:46.040 --> 2:50:47.880]  All right. You're wearing the Hillary for prison shirt.
[2:50:48.520 --> 2:50:50.760]  What's your favorite thing about Hillary?
[2:50:50.760 --> 2:50:52.360]  Nothing. I don't like her.
[2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:53.400]  She needs to be in prison.
[2:50:53.400 --> 2:50:53.640]  Yes.
[2:50:54.600 --> 2:50:55.400]  Why are you supporting Trump?
[2:50:56.200 --> 2:50:59.320]  Because I think that he'll make America great again.
[2:50:59.320 --> 2:50:59.800]  Yeah.
[2:50:59.800 --> 2:51:00.200]  Yeah.
[2:51:00.200 --> 2:51:02.040]  There's another Hillary for prison shirt.
[2:51:02.040 --> 2:51:03.000]  There's another one right there.
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:04.040]  What difference does it make?
[2:51:04.040 --> 2:51:04.760]  That's awesome.
[2:51:04.760 --> 2:51:07.160]  What? Why are you supporting Donald Trump?
[2:51:07.160 --> 2:51:10.520]  Because he'll probably stop the corruption in Washington
[2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:12.360]  and bring our jobs back to the country.
[2:51:12.360 --> 2:51:14.200]  Yeah. We're scared of him. I mean, something's going on.
[2:51:14.760 --> 2:51:16.840]  Jones, I like how he said he just wants to do four years.
[2:51:16.840 --> 2:51:18.520]  He's like, I'm going to do it in four years and I'm out.
[2:51:18.520 --> 2:51:20.280]  You know, he's not going to be a career politician.
[2:51:20.280 --> 2:51:22.040]  He's not going to suck us dry.
[2:51:22.040 --> 2:51:23.240]  And you know, he's just going to say,
[2:51:23.240 --> 2:51:25.000]  I'm in for four years and I'm going to do it in four years.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:27.160]  Well, tell those folks they're awesome and thanks for the support.
[2:51:27.720 --> 2:51:28.760]  Hey, guys, thank you very much.
[2:51:28.760 --> 2:51:30.120]  Alex just said, thanks for the support.
[2:51:30.120 --> 2:51:31.400]  Thank you all very much.
[2:51:31.400 --> 2:51:32.200]  Y'all have a good one.
[2:51:32.200 --> 2:51:32.360]  Yeah.
[2:51:32.360 --> 2:51:34.120]  Folks, he's been on that line 10 minutes.
[2:51:34.120 --> 2:51:36.200]  We've already seen five in four shirts.
[2:51:36.200 --> 2:51:39.000]  A lot of love in Wisconsin for you.
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:40.520]  I mean, a lot of people are sure.
[2:51:40.520 --> 2:51:41.880]  Love for you, dude. We love you.
[2:51:41.880 --> 2:51:42.680]  Fuck Donald Trump.
[2:51:42.680 --> 2:51:42.840]  Fuck everything.
[2:51:42.840 --> 2:51:43.480]  I love what I'm doing by the way.
[2:51:43.480 --> 2:51:44.280]  I love what I'm doing by the way.
[2:51:44.280 --> 2:51:44.440]  I really do.
[2:51:44.440 --> 2:51:45.320]  I can't say that.
[2:51:45.320 --> 2:51:47.320]  Love tipping with his wife and him and the kids.
[2:51:47.320 --> 2:51:47.960]  Oh my God.
[2:51:47.960 --> 2:51:49.240]  So you're not a Donald Trump fan?
[2:51:49.240 --> 2:51:49.880]  Not at all, no.
[2:51:49.880 --> 2:51:51.000]  OK, so where are you going in?
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:52.440]  Doing so fun to camp with them.
[2:51:52.440 --> 2:51:53.320]  I'm biased.
[2:51:53.320 --> 2:51:54.840]  What he has to say for himself
[2:51:54.840 --> 2:51:56.440]  rather than what is portrayed in the media.
[2:51:56.440 --> 2:51:58.040]  I want to at least have a position
[2:51:58.040 --> 2:52:01.000]  that I can make an argument that's genuine and intelligent.
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:03.240]  So you're going to come out and then like an MSM robot,
[2:52:03.240 --> 2:52:05.720]  you're going to be saying he's racist, sexist, xenophobic,
[2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:06.520]  and I saw him live.
[2:52:06.520 --> 2:52:07.640]  Now I can say it.
[2:52:07.640 --> 2:52:10.360]  It's not that I personally believe
[2:52:10.360 --> 2:52:12.760]  that it is just a truth that is displayed
[2:52:12.760 --> 2:52:15.160]  in the way he speaks, the words he says,
[2:52:15.160 --> 2:52:16.680]  the way he positions himself,
[2:52:16.680 --> 2:52:18.440]  the way his policies work.
[2:52:18.440 --> 2:52:19.240]  How old are you?
[2:52:19.240 --> 2:52:19.560]  What?
[2:52:19.560 --> 2:52:20.200]  How old are you?
[2:52:20.200 --> 2:52:20.760]  18.
[2:52:20.760 --> 2:52:21.560]  18.
[2:52:21.560 --> 2:52:21.800]  All right.
[2:52:21.800 --> 2:52:22.680]  Do you pay taxes?
[2:52:23.720 --> 2:52:25.160]  No, but I pay income.
[2:52:25.160 --> 2:52:27.480]  I pay payroll tax.
[2:52:27.480 --> 2:52:28.920]  He pays self security tax.
[2:52:28.920 --> 2:52:29.560]  He even pays me pay.
[2:52:29.560 --> 2:52:31.000]  Once you start paying taxes
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:32.360]  and they start taking all your money,
[2:52:32.360 --> 2:52:33.880]  you're going to go, where's all this money going to?
[2:52:33.880 --> 2:52:35.720]  I've got to pay property taxes to live in my house.
[2:52:35.720 --> 2:52:36.520]  I'm going to go to the military
[2:52:36.520 --> 2:52:37.720]  because that's where I should be going.
[2:52:37.720 --> 2:52:39.880]  I should go to bomb fucking ISIS.
[2:52:39.880 --> 2:52:40.680]  Don't stay there.
[2:52:40.680 --> 2:52:40.920]  All right, delete that.
[2:52:40.920 --> 2:52:42.040]  We're live on the air.
[2:52:42.040 --> 2:52:42.440]  Hit the bag.
[2:52:42.440 --> 2:52:43.160]  I'm just going to dirt strike.
[2:52:43.160 --> 2:52:43.800]  Sorry, steal it.
[2:52:43.800 --> 2:52:44.920]  Hit the delay.
[2:52:44.920 --> 2:52:45.640]  We got that, right?
[2:52:45.640 --> 2:52:46.680]  Hit the delay.
[2:52:46.680 --> 2:52:47.240]  Oh, we got it.
[2:52:47.240 --> 2:52:47.880]  You can't shut that.
[2:52:47.880 --> 2:52:48.680]  That worked.
[2:52:48.680 --> 2:52:49.480]  Thank you.
[2:52:49.480 --> 2:52:50.360]  Hey, here's a fan here.
[2:52:50.360 --> 2:52:51.720]  What do you like, Trump?
[2:52:51.720 --> 2:52:56.280]  Well, what I like about Trump is that the globalists don't like him.
[2:52:57.640 --> 2:52:58.360]  That guy's a listener.
[2:52:58.360 --> 2:53:00.040]  He must be doing something, right?
[2:53:00.040 --> 2:53:00.520]  Correct.
[2:53:00.520 --> 2:53:02.040]  Ask him, he's a listener.
[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:03.160]  Are you a listener?
[2:53:03.160 --> 2:53:04.520]  A listener, yeah.
[2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:05.800]  So I appreciate what you do.
[2:53:05.800 --> 2:53:06.520]  All right.
[2:53:06.520 --> 2:53:07.080]  Thanks a lot.
[2:53:07.080 --> 2:53:07.560]  Yeah.
[2:53:07.560 --> 2:53:08.200]  Hey, man, we're on here.
[2:53:08.200 --> 2:53:08.840]  God bless you, buddy.
[2:53:08.840 --> 2:53:09.960]  We can get some more info from him.
[2:53:09.960 --> 2:53:10.920]  What else do you want to say?
[2:53:10.920 --> 2:53:11.640]  All right.
[2:53:11.640 --> 2:53:13.560]  I think he's rolling out.
[2:53:13.560 --> 2:53:14.520]  Let's stop right there, dude.
[2:53:14.520 --> 2:53:15.960]  Let's get away from the crowd for a minute.
[2:53:15.960 --> 2:53:16.600]  Just stop.
[2:53:16.600 --> 2:53:17.480]  OK, sure.
[2:53:17.480 --> 2:53:19.400]  Every fifth or sixth person is a listener
[2:53:19.400 --> 2:53:20.600]  or wearing a t-shirt.
[2:53:20.600 --> 2:53:23.480]  I hope the viewer's out to realize you're not alone.
[2:53:23.480 --> 2:53:26.520]  That's why you get t-shirts at infowarstore.com.
[2:53:26.520 --> 2:53:28.440]  It's not just to find our operation for the 10 bucks
[2:53:28.440 --> 2:53:29.640]  we make on one.
[2:53:29.640 --> 2:53:32.680]  It's that you then meet like-minded people.
[2:53:32.680 --> 2:53:37.400]  And by the way, I've had five designer shirts
[2:53:37.400 --> 2:53:39.720]  that were limited edition that we never brought back.
[2:53:39.720 --> 2:53:41.320]  We've had so many complaints.
[2:53:41.320 --> 2:53:45.080]  And now everybody's copying our dark blue Hillary
[2:53:45.080 --> 2:53:47.400]  for Prison shirt that's been sold out for two months
[2:53:47.400 --> 2:53:49.880]  that I'm going to technically do the right thing,
[2:53:49.880 --> 2:53:51.880]  but quite the spirit of it not.
[2:53:51.880 --> 2:53:53.000]  I'm going to be honest.
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:56.120]  I'm going to bring the Hillary for Prison original back out,
[2:53:56.120 --> 2:53:58.200]  but with a slight design change.
[2:53:58.200 --> 2:54:01.000]  So it is designer. It is actually original.
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:02.920]  But I'm putting the shirt back out.
[2:54:02.920 --> 2:54:04.120]  I made the decision yesterday.
[2:54:04.120 --> 2:54:06.040]  They'll be back in stock next week,
[2:54:06.040 --> 2:54:07.000]  made right here in America.
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:09.400]  Rob, dude, that shirt is too popular
[2:54:09.400 --> 2:54:11.080]  and people demand it, dude.
[2:54:11.080 --> 2:54:12.040]  And we need the money.
[2:54:12.040 --> 2:54:13.480]  We need the money.
[2:54:13.480 --> 2:54:13.880]  Exactly.
[2:54:13.880 --> 2:54:15.240]  Hey, when we go to break, we ought to get this guy
[2:54:15.240 --> 2:54:17.480]  to take us out to break with a song.
[2:54:17.480 --> 2:54:19.400]  He's been playing some pro Trump song.
[2:54:19.400 --> 2:54:19.720]  Hold on.
[2:54:19.720 --> 2:54:21.480]  When we're going to break, I'll cue you.
[2:54:21.480 --> 2:54:21.800]  All right.
[2:54:21.800 --> 2:54:22.520]  So just let me know.
[2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:24.120]  Jones, give me a 10 second countdown.
[2:54:24.120 --> 2:54:26.440]  I'll get this guy to take us a song out to break.
[2:54:26.440 --> 2:54:28.840]  He's been playing pro Trump songs all weekend.
[2:54:28.840 --> 2:54:30.920]  Wisconsin is really interesting.
[2:54:30.920 --> 2:54:33.400]  Where we're at now, Appleton is very Democratic,
[2:54:33.400 --> 2:54:34.840]  very liberal city.
[2:54:34.840 --> 2:54:38.920]  And they seem to have stirred up the young kids who don't live there.
[2:54:38.920 --> 2:54:40.120]  You're a real liberal.
[2:54:40.120 --> 2:54:42.760]  You should be against Hillary who's a total tyranny,
[2:54:42.760 --> 2:54:44.920]  which, trying to steal it from Bernie Sanders.
[2:54:44.920 --> 2:54:45.800]  How could you support it?
[2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:47.320]  You know, most people are against Hillary.
[2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:48.600]  They're definitely pro Bernie.
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:51.560]  And I ask them, hey, what is up with they're saying
[2:54:51.560 --> 2:54:53.960]  they're going to steal the election now for Hillary?
[2:54:53.960 --> 2:54:55.160]  Just outright steal it.
[2:54:55.160 --> 2:54:56.680]  And a lot of these people haven't seen that story.
[2:54:56.680 --> 2:54:58.520]  And I'm like, go check it out, because they're openly saying
[2:54:58.520 --> 2:55:01.160]  they're going to steal the New York primary for Hillary Clinton.
[2:55:01.160 --> 2:55:03.000]  They just go ahead and say it.
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:06.120]  So it's completely ridiculous.
[2:55:06.120 --> 2:55:07.400]  And people need to stand up.
[2:55:07.400 --> 2:55:09.960]  And I hope these Hillary or these Bernie supporters,
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:11.320]  when they realize it's been stolen from,
[2:55:11.320 --> 2:55:13.320]  they go to the only populist stand.
[2:55:13.320 --> 2:55:16.280]  This is amazing footage of you guys on the ground.
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:17.720]  Wait till you and I, by the way,
[2:55:17.720 --> 2:55:19.160]  we got to go ahead and get the hotel rooms.
[2:55:19.160 --> 2:55:22.280]  They're all sold out or the houses we're going to rent or whatever.
[2:55:22.280 --> 2:55:24.360]  But we're all going for a week and a half.
[2:55:24.360 --> 2:55:26.440]  It is going to be crazy town.
[2:55:26.440 --> 2:55:29.000]  So get ready to, you're going, I'm going,
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:30.120]  a bunch of the crews going.
[2:55:30.120 --> 2:55:31.960]  We're going to the RNC.
[2:55:31.960 --> 2:55:33.960]  It is going to be circus maximum.
[2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:35.160]  I can't wait.
[2:55:35.160 --> 2:55:35.880]  I can't wait.
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:37.880]  I'm sorry.
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:38.920]  Somebody wants to say something.
[2:55:38.920 --> 2:55:40.200]  He's got a Bernie 16 pin on.
[2:55:41.080 --> 2:55:42.520]  I was just going to say, not everyone here,
[2:55:42.520 --> 2:55:44.600]  not everyone in the protesting line is a Bernie supporter.
[2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:44.920]  I am.
[2:55:44.920 --> 2:55:45.800]  But you are.
[2:55:45.800 --> 2:55:46.120]  Right.
[2:55:46.120 --> 2:55:47.080]  Well, she is.
[2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:48.840]  The ones that I've talked to a lot of them are.
[2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:49.800]  Okay.
[2:55:50.600 --> 2:55:52.680]  Who's the woman that called you a racist earlier?
[2:55:52.680 --> 2:55:53.560]  Hold on.
[2:55:53.560 --> 2:55:54.760]  She's over there.
[2:55:54.760 --> 2:55:56.120]  Hey, we got a Hillary Clinton supporter.
[2:55:56.760 --> 2:55:59.160]  So why should we not put Hillary in prison at this time?
[2:55:59.880 --> 2:56:01.320]  There's absolutely no reason to.
[2:56:01.320 --> 2:56:02.360]  Why should we?
[2:56:02.360 --> 2:56:03.320]  She destroyed the country.
[2:56:03.320 --> 2:56:04.120]  Olivia.
[2:56:04.120 --> 2:56:05.400]  She sold arms to Isis.
[2:56:06.440 --> 2:56:09.080]  And she killed four or five Americans in Benghazi.
[2:56:09.080 --> 2:56:09.640]  That's cute.
[2:56:09.640 --> 2:56:10.520]  She killed them, huh?
[2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:11.960]  She's dead.
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:13.080]  She stood down.
[2:56:13.080 --> 2:56:14.040]  She acted like she didn't know.
[2:56:14.840 --> 2:56:15.560]  Who do I support?
[2:56:16.600 --> 2:56:18.840]  I support who is not bought off by the globalist.
[2:56:18.840 --> 2:56:20.280]  So right now it looks like Donald Trump.
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:21.800]  But you know what?
[2:56:21.800 --> 2:56:25.320]  Bernie wouldn't be a bad second place, honestly.
[2:56:25.320 --> 2:56:26.360]  You know what's interesting?
[2:56:26.360 --> 2:56:27.560]  But you know, I think.
[2:56:27.560 --> 2:56:27.720]  Yeah.
[2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:28.840]  Does she get their populace?
[2:56:28.840 --> 2:56:30.120]  Does Peabring understand that?
[2:56:30.840 --> 2:56:31.160]  Right.
[2:56:32.600 --> 2:56:33.000]  All right.
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:33.800]  I think they're done talking.
[2:56:33.800 --> 2:56:34.440]  What did you say?
[2:56:34.440 --> 2:56:35.960]  I think I don't support Hillary,
[2:56:35.960 --> 2:56:37.240]  but I think a lot of people do support her.
[2:56:37.240 --> 2:56:40.280]  As if she knows the peace symbol is the root of death and Satanism.
[2:56:40.840 --> 2:56:41.640]  Versus Bernie.
[2:56:41.640 --> 2:56:44.200]  I think they think she's going to win the general election.
[2:56:44.200 --> 2:56:46.440]  She has a better chance of winning the general election against Trump.
[2:56:46.440 --> 2:56:50.040]  And they think her establishment politics is a necessary evil.
[2:56:50.040 --> 2:56:51.560]  I don't believe that, but I think that's what I want.
[2:56:51.560 --> 2:56:51.880]  Yeah.
[2:56:51.880 --> 2:56:52.840]  A lot of people do think that.
[2:56:52.840 --> 2:56:53.880]  Jones, my earpiece fell.
[2:56:53.880 --> 2:56:54.600]  What did you just say?
[2:56:55.560 --> 2:56:56.040]  I'm sorry.
[2:56:56.040 --> 2:56:57.080]  Well, I mean, listen.
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:00.360]  I just want to ask her if her brain is bigger than a walnut.
[2:57:00.360 --> 2:57:01.160]  No, I'm joking.
[2:57:01.160 --> 2:57:02.520]  I know.
[2:57:02.520 --> 2:57:04.280]  I don't mean to be mean and insult these people.
[2:57:04.280 --> 2:57:05.560]  I just get sick of them.
[2:57:05.560 --> 2:57:06.840]  And I think they're so smart.
[2:57:06.840 --> 2:57:07.560]  I'm just tired of it.
[2:57:09.080 --> 2:57:09.880]  Yeah, they do.
[2:57:09.880 --> 2:57:11.960]  They really do think they found it all out
[2:57:11.960 --> 2:57:13.160]  because they've read an article.
[2:57:13.160 --> 2:57:14.760]  Let's go out to break with this guy.
[2:57:14.760 --> 2:57:15.560]  We got two minutes.
[2:57:15.560 --> 2:57:16.360]  Have him start playing.
[2:57:16.360 --> 2:57:27.080]  He has entered the twilight zone of talk radio.
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:27.880]  Use the TV.
[2:57:29.880 --> 2:57:31.320]  With the fourth hour today.
[2:57:32.760 --> 2:57:33.480]  Hosted by
[2:57:39.640 --> 2:57:40.280]  Oh my God.
[2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:41.160]  I think she's awesome.
[2:57:41.960 --> 2:57:43.000]  Who's host of the fourth hour?
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:43.400]  I forgot.
[2:57:44.360 --> 2:57:44.840]  David Knight.
[2:57:44.840 --> 2:57:46.600]  That's what makes free speech so great.
[2:57:46.600 --> 2:57:47.960]  You know, everybody standing out here.
[2:57:48.840 --> 2:57:51.400]  Got to get a crowd loves him.
[2:57:51.400 --> 2:57:52.120]  I wonder if they
[2:57:52.120 --> 2:57:52.600]  What's your name?
[2:57:52.600 --> 2:57:54.280]  Herb Gastamala, PCP.
[2:57:54.280 --> 2:57:54.680]  What would happen?
[2:57:54.680 --> 2:57:55.320]  Puerto Rico, New York.
[2:57:55.320 --> 2:57:56.680]  I drove 13 and a half out.
[2:57:56.680 --> 2:57:57.960]  15 and a half to get here.
[2:57:58.680 --> 2:57:59.000]  Yeah.
[2:57:59.000 --> 2:57:59.240]  Yeah.
[2:58:00.040 --> 2:58:02.520]  Drought 15 hours to come here and play music for people.
[2:58:03.160 --> 2:58:04.600]  Pro Donald Trump supporters.
[2:58:04.600 --> 2:58:07.720]  What do they put Molly do in all of the Trump
[2:58:07.720 --> 2:58:09.480]  and then all the Democrat supporters?
[2:58:09.480 --> 2:58:10.840]  If everyone was drug, what would happen?
[2:58:11.720 --> 2:58:14.600]  There, there, there probably be a lot of clothes
[2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:15.960]  being taken off here in the streets.
[2:58:15.960 --> 2:58:17.800]  There'd be peace on earth for five hours.
[2:58:18.360 --> 2:58:19.080]  They would be.
[2:58:20.680 --> 2:58:21.240]  I'm sorry.
[2:58:21.800 --> 2:58:22.920]  They're getting louder there.
[2:58:23.960 --> 2:58:25.080]  I tell you what, stay there.
[2:58:25.080 --> 2:58:26.440]  I want you to walk across the street
[2:58:26.440 --> 2:58:28.040]  back to the moron crew.
[2:58:28.040 --> 2:58:29.400]  Back to the Democrats.
[2:58:29.400 --> 2:58:30.840]  And I want to talk to them a little bit.
[2:58:30.840 --> 2:58:32.360]  See if they're able to talk or form settlements.
[2:58:32.360 --> 2:58:34.200]  I want to grab my bag before I do that.
[2:58:34.200 --> 2:58:35.320]  So we're going to go to break.
[2:58:35.320 --> 2:58:35.800]  You're great.
[2:58:35.800 --> 2:58:37.320]  Back in 70 seconds with Rob do.
[2:58:37.320 --> 2:58:39.400]  Four of the hours right ahead at FullWars.com.
[2:58:39.400 --> 2:58:40.360]  2016 election.
[2:58:40.360 --> 2:58:41.400]  I'm Alex Joe.
[2:58:41.400 --> 2:58:42.760]  This is GCN,
[2:58:42.760 --> 2:58:45.400]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[2:59:12.760 --> 2:59:17.000]  Our call toll free 888-253-3139.
[2:59:42.760 --> 2:59:47.960]  To order your Pro Max shower filter from Pro Pure today.
[2:59:51.240 --> 2:59:53.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:01.880 --> 3:00:03.720]  We are on the march.
[3:00:03.720 --> 3:00:06.120]  The empire is on the run.
[3:00:06.840 --> 3:00:10.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:00:10.600 --> 3:00:15.000]  By the way, Nico, our head producer was asking me,
[3:00:15.000 --> 3:00:16.040]  why don't you just make that joke
[3:00:16.040 --> 3:00:18.120]  about people being on ecstasy or whatever.
[3:00:18.920 --> 3:00:20.280]  All I know is I've read about it
[3:00:20.280 --> 3:00:21.880]  and do was saying it's like
[3:00:22.840 --> 3:00:24.040]  the people he went and talked to
[3:00:24.040 --> 3:00:25.800]  that were anti-Trump were on Xanax.
[3:00:25.800 --> 3:00:26.920]  I've never taken Xanax,
[3:00:26.920 --> 3:00:28.760]  but I guess it makes you all spaced out.
[3:00:28.760 --> 3:00:30.760]  They do look all like zombies like,
[3:00:30.760 --> 3:00:32.520]  hello, we're here.
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:35.640]  And then some of the Trump supporters seem kind of spaced out.
[3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:38.360]  And then so do the Democrats
[3:00:38.360 --> 3:00:39.640]  and the liberals they're talking to.
[3:00:39.640 --> 3:00:41.080]  Like, what are they on?
[3:00:41.080 --> 3:00:42.600]  Is what I'm getting at there.
[3:00:42.600 --> 3:00:44.680]  So that was kind of a 10 minute, 15 minute,
[3:00:44.680 --> 3:00:45.960]  free for all of Rob do.
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:47.960]  Here's some of the stories up on infowars.com
[3:00:47.960 --> 3:00:49.160]  by Kit Daniels.
[3:00:49.160 --> 3:00:51.960]  Trump says, Drudge a fantastic guy.
[3:00:51.960 --> 3:00:55.880]  GOP frontrunner speaks highly of media pioneer.
[3:00:55.880 --> 3:00:57.720]  We're going to come back in the next segment
[3:00:57.720 --> 3:00:59.640]  with David Knight and play that clip.
[3:00:59.640 --> 3:01:01.480]  So let's, let's get that clip.
[3:01:01.480 --> 3:01:04.920]  But the real reason I'm talking about infowars.com right now
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:06.440]  is there is a bill in the house
[3:01:06.440 --> 3:01:07.960]  is getting a lot of cosponsors
[3:01:07.960 --> 3:01:12.440]  to strip the BLM of police powers.
[3:01:13.160 --> 3:01:18.360]  So that is a very, very positive thing coming up as well.
[3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:22.360]  But right now let's go back to Rob do in Appleton, Wisconsin
[3:01:22.360 --> 3:01:24.280]  where the man proven correct,
[3:01:24.840 --> 3:01:26.200]  Joseph McCarthy is from.
[3:01:26.840 --> 3:01:29.320]  And let's go ahead and go back to Rob do Rob do.
[3:01:29.320 --> 3:01:29.720]  Go ahead.
[3:01:30.600 --> 3:01:31.560]  Hey, I am.
[3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:35.160]  I'm actually, I just got the 10% battery left on my,
[3:01:35.160 --> 3:01:38.600]  on my phone and I'm trying to hook up the,
[3:01:38.600 --> 3:01:40.520]  trying to hook up the cable to it
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:41.960]  and it'll take like 20 seconds.
[3:01:41.960 --> 3:01:42.360]  That's okay.
[3:01:42.360 --> 3:01:43.000]  We're almost done.
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:44.360]  David, you're doing a fabulous job.
[3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:46.760]  Are these the anti-Trump people
[3:01:46.760 --> 3:01:49.000]  festooned with their Rambo flags?
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:50.760]  These are the anti-Trump people, yes.
[3:01:50.760 --> 3:01:51.640]  They are definitely.
[3:01:51.640 --> 3:01:53.640]  But they don't care about the Muslims flooding in
[3:01:53.640 --> 3:01:54.840]  that want to chop their heads off.
[3:01:55.720 --> 3:01:58.200]  No, that doesn't seem to bother them that much.
[3:01:58.200 --> 3:01:59.320]  Oh, chopping your head off.
[3:01:59.320 --> 3:02:01.400]  Nothing compared to having a Rangatang here.
[3:02:01.400 --> 3:02:05.560]  Exactly.
[3:02:05.560 --> 3:02:06.200]  All right.
[3:02:06.200 --> 3:02:06.680]  There we go.
[3:02:06.680 --> 3:02:08.200]  I think we're, I think we're back in business.
[3:02:11.640 --> 3:02:12.360]  Who's this guy?
[3:02:13.240 --> 3:02:13.640]  All right.
[3:02:13.640 --> 3:02:14.120]  Hey buddy.
[3:02:15.720 --> 3:02:16.280]  Look at that.
[3:02:16.280 --> 3:02:17.240]  Oh, he's a listener.
[3:02:17.240 --> 3:02:17.880]  Another listener.
[3:02:17.880 --> 3:02:18.680]  Hello there for president.
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:19.160]  2016.
[3:02:19.160 --> 3:02:19.800]  Another listener.
[3:02:19.800 --> 3:02:21.400]  A lot of folks in our t-shirts out there
[3:02:21.400 --> 3:02:22.520]  in Appleton, Wisconsin.
[3:02:23.320 --> 3:02:23.640]  Yep.
[3:02:23.640 --> 3:02:25.240]  There's info or it doesn't have any listeners
[3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:26.360]  anywhere we have.
[3:02:26.360 --> 3:02:28.040]  According to the media, we have no listeners.
[3:02:28.040 --> 3:02:28.680]  We don't exist.
[3:02:28.680 --> 3:02:37.720]  It's so loud, dude.
[3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:38.840]  I can't pick anything up.
[3:02:38.840 --> 3:02:40.920]  Is this dresses for Trump?
[3:02:41.560 --> 3:02:42.360]  What?
[3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:43.880]  Are you wearing a dress for Trump?
[3:02:43.880 --> 3:02:44.120]  No.
[3:02:45.240 --> 3:02:46.120]  You not support Trump?
[3:02:46.760 --> 3:02:49.080]  I have no difference against him or for him.
[3:02:50.680 --> 3:02:51.400]  What about you?
[3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:52.280]  Why are you out here?
[3:02:52.280 --> 3:02:54.680]  My motto is who will Trump offend next?
[3:02:55.240 --> 3:02:56.280]  Yeah, he's offensive.
[3:02:56.280 --> 3:02:56.920]  Get rid of him.
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:02:57.720]  Yeah.
[3:02:57.720 --> 3:02:59.480]  So, you know what happens if you get offended?
[3:02:59.480 --> 3:03:00.840]  Is that the end of the world?
[3:03:00.840 --> 3:03:03.640]  No, but I feel like he's offended so many people that
[3:03:03.640 --> 3:03:03.720]  I don't know if he's still down for it.
[3:03:03.720 --> 3:03:05.320]  It feels fine to get involved
[3:03:05.320 --> 3:03:06.200]  because he offended people
[3:03:06.200 --> 3:03:06.920]  and I'm a good boy.
[3:03:06.920 --> 3:03:07.400]  He hasn't killed anybody yet.
[3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:07.400]  I'm happy to hear that.
[3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:09.400]  He hasn't killed anybody yet.
[3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:11.160]  I mean, Barack Obama's kill people with drones.
[3:03:11.160 --> 3:03:12.840]  He sends off on drone kill lists all the time.
[3:03:13.960 --> 3:03:15.880]  Yeah, but he does it for us.
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:17.000]  But that's not as bad as offending.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:18.280]  Don't act so surprised.
[3:03:18.280 --> 3:03:19.800]  Well, I feel like-
[3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:22.040]  You aren't on any mercy mission this time.
[3:03:22.040 --> 3:03:23.960]  Oh wait, the political just said don't talk.
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:26.440]  If we all got told as kids, don't be racist.
[3:03:26.440 --> 3:03:27.160]  Don't do this.
[3:03:27.160 --> 3:03:28.040]  Don't do this, but-
[3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:28.920]  Don't be racist.
[3:03:28.920 --> 3:03:30.200]  Wow, you might form words.
[3:03:30.200 --> 3:03:32.520]  This guy is an incredible leader.
[3:03:32.520 --> 3:03:34.440]  You've been mind-controlled, unfortunately.
[3:03:34.440 --> 3:03:35.640]  And that's not my fault.
[3:03:35.640 --> 3:03:36.760]  Or Donald Trump's fault.
[3:03:36.760 --> 3:03:38.360]  Ask him how much fluoride he's drank.
[3:03:38.360 --> 3:03:41.000]  You've been brainwashed into thinking that anything
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:42.840]  that you say that offends people is bad.
[3:03:42.840 --> 3:03:44.120]  And that's not necessarily bad.
[3:03:44.120 --> 3:03:45.240]  No, it's not.
[3:03:45.240 --> 3:03:46.520]  It's not always bad.
[3:03:46.520 --> 3:03:49.000]  But when you decide to tug at a certain group-
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:50.760]  Ask him if he likes fluoride.
[3:03:50.760 --> 3:03:51.720]  That's right, your fault.
[3:03:51.720 --> 3:03:53.160]  That's not fair for them.
[3:03:53.160 --> 3:03:55.560]  We want all U.S. citizens at one point-
[3:03:55.560 --> 3:03:58.120]  Do you love fluoride?
[3:03:58.120 --> 3:03:59.640]  So do you like fluoride?
[3:03:59.640 --> 3:04:01.640]  Do you drink fluoride, fluoridated water?
[3:04:01.640 --> 3:04:02.760]  No.
[3:04:02.760 --> 3:04:03.160]  You don't?
[3:04:03.160 --> 3:04:05.000]  Are you sure?
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:06.200]  I don't drink water.
[3:04:06.200 --> 3:04:07.000]  You don't drink water.
[3:04:09.160 --> 3:04:09.640]  What do you do?
[3:04:09.640 --> 3:04:10.680]  Do you want to drink?
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:13.960]  All right, have a good one.
[3:04:15.080 --> 3:04:16.840]  Well, that is a genius.
[3:04:18.040 --> 3:04:19.880]  Another anti-Trump person.
[3:04:19.880 --> 3:04:22.280]  These people are literally the dumbest people
[3:04:22.280 --> 3:04:23.000]  I've ever seen, dude.
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:25.480]  Here, I'm going to get a front shot of it so you can see.
[3:04:25.480 --> 3:04:26.280]  I'm not being mean.
[3:04:26.280 --> 3:04:27.240]  They're just idiots.
[3:04:27.240 --> 3:04:28.600]  I mean, I'm sorry, these people.
[3:04:28.600 --> 3:04:29.160]  There we go.
[3:04:29.160 --> 3:04:30.520]  Here's the cheerleading squad.
[3:04:30.520 --> 3:04:32.920]  They're not literally Tyler's cheerleaders.
[3:04:33.720 --> 3:04:35.720]  They just are on a bandwagon of trendiness.
[3:04:36.840 --> 3:04:37.640]  Joe, I was talking to them.
[3:04:37.640 --> 3:04:38.920]  When I told them I was with them for war,
[3:04:38.920 --> 3:04:39.560]  they immediately-
[3:04:39.560 --> 3:04:40.040]  Hold on.
[3:04:40.040 --> 3:04:40.680]  Hold on, dude.
[3:04:40.680 --> 3:04:41.240]  I know your-
[3:04:41.240 --> 3:04:42.520]  I know your battery's almost dead,
[3:04:42.520 --> 3:04:44.120]  but David and I is coming up.
[3:04:44.120 --> 3:04:45.800]  Let's come back with extravaganza.
[3:04:45.800 --> 3:04:47.240]  You have to step on the street.
[3:04:47.240 --> 3:04:47.640]  That's all.
[3:04:47.640 --> 3:04:48.200]  Oh, are you an officer?
[3:04:48.200 --> 3:04:49.080]  Oh, she's ordering you.
[3:04:49.640 --> 3:04:51.720]  Yeah, she's a social justice warrior.
[3:04:51.720 --> 3:04:54.440]  She's ordered you to just order you.
[3:04:55.000 --> 3:04:59.160]  Damn, I'm the woman I'm in charge of.
[3:04:59.160 --> 3:05:00.680]  The New York Daily News says,
[3:05:00.680 --> 3:05:03.400]  maybe the system really is rigged.
[3:05:03.400 --> 3:05:04.280]  You think?
[3:05:04.280 --> 3:05:06.520]  The Democrat paper came to this conclusion.
[3:05:06.520 --> 3:05:08.840]  After contacting Democrat superdelegates in New York
[3:05:08.840 --> 3:05:11.480]  and asking if they would switch from Hillary to Bernie
[3:05:11.480 --> 3:05:13.640]  if he won the popular vote,
[3:05:13.640 --> 3:05:15.720]  every single superdelegate said no.
[3:05:16.280 --> 3:05:18.040]  Just like the Republican establishment,
[3:05:18.040 --> 3:05:19.480]  with its never Trump movement,
[3:05:19.480 --> 3:05:22.200]  the Democrat establishment is never Bernie.
[3:05:22.200 --> 3:05:23.960]  Welcome to crony socialism.
[3:05:24.520 --> 3:05:26.040]  Democrats should ask themselves
[3:05:26.040 --> 3:05:30.280]  why they want a crooked rigged system to control everything.
[3:05:30.280 --> 3:05:33.560]  Now, crony capitalism can't happen without crony socialism.
[3:05:34.200 --> 3:05:36.520]  In the GOP, they steal it differently.
[3:05:36.520 --> 3:05:38.920]  There they wait until after the election to steal it,
[3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:39.960]  like in South Carolina,
[3:05:39.960 --> 3:05:42.280]  where the voters gave Trump every delegate,
[3:05:42.280 --> 3:05:44.840]  but Cruz came in later with the establishment
[3:05:44.840 --> 3:05:46.920]  and appointed his friends as delegates.

[3:08:00.920 --> 3:08:04.200]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[3:08:04.200 --> 3:08:09.640]  it's Alex Jones only on the GCN radio network.
[3:08:09.640 --> 3:08:12.680]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones here,
[3:08:12.680 --> 3:08:17.880]  co-hosting the fourth hour with David Knight of InfoWars Nightly News.
[3:08:17.880 --> 3:08:22.360]  The revolution against tyranny, the resistance against dehumanization begins
[3:08:22.360 --> 3:08:27.080]  at infowars.com. Wow, look at that HD footage coming in.
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:29.880]  The skype's really clear right now with our crew out there
[3:08:29.880 --> 3:08:33.400]  in Appleton, Wisconsin, thousands and thousands trying to get into here.
[3:08:33.400 --> 3:08:35.640]  Trump speaking in a few hours.
[3:08:35.640 --> 3:08:37.800]  The Trump people, most of them didn't want to talk.
[3:08:37.800 --> 3:08:40.200]  Those that did were all listeners, maybe one in five,
[3:08:40.200 --> 3:08:44.440]  wearing an infowars.com t-shirt. My gosh, it was like all our listeners
[3:08:44.440 --> 3:08:50.040]  in Appleton, Wisconsin, and he's across the street and some cheerleaders came over
[3:08:50.040 --> 3:08:52.840]  and advised him that they are rulers of Earth
[3:08:52.840 --> 3:08:55.400]  and that we're not allowed to talk to them and that they're in command of
[3:08:55.400 --> 3:08:58.040]  everything. So Rob Do, when I march back over, what
[3:08:58.040 --> 3:09:02.520]  on Earth are those people? This may be an invasion from Pluto,
[3:09:02.520 --> 3:09:06.440]  these creatures, but I gotta say the dumbest, well-meaning people are liberals.
[3:09:06.440 --> 3:09:10.040]  They are racist clan members there as they run on to fight him and,
[3:09:10.040 --> 3:09:13.240]  you know, discover that that's fun about the government itself. But Rob Do,
[3:09:13.240 --> 3:09:18.280]  who should we talk to here in the, in this gallery of, well, let's just say the
[3:09:18.280 --> 3:09:22.280]  bulbs aren't too bright here. This lovely lady right here is an info,
[3:09:22.280 --> 3:09:24.040]  are you an infowars fan? Yeah.
[3:09:24.040 --> 3:09:27.800]  Okay, but you're not a Trump supporter? No. Okay, tell me why.
[3:09:27.800 --> 3:09:30.760]  Wait, what did you say? I'm sorry. So I said, tell me why you're not a Trump
[3:09:30.760 --> 3:09:34.360]  supporter? He's very intelligent. He's racist.
[3:09:34.360 --> 3:09:38.440]  I love everybody and I think everybody should be accepted here and...
[3:09:38.440 --> 3:09:40.920]  What's the motto of infowars? But we can't have free babies.
[3:09:40.920 --> 3:09:45.160]  You can't have free stuff, buddy. There's a war on for your mind.
[3:09:45.160 --> 3:09:48.200]  You're the product of mind control. I'm sorry.
[3:09:48.200 --> 3:09:52.280]  I am? Where makes you say that? Well, because you're, you're spotting the same
[3:09:52.280 --> 3:09:55.240]  talking points that the media, the media did just a few months ago. They
[3:09:55.240 --> 3:09:58.600]  started saying he's racist, he's xenophobic, he's racist, he's xenophobic, he's
[3:09:58.600 --> 3:10:01.480]  sexist. Hey, let's attack Trump for the real
[3:10:01.480 --> 3:10:04.280]  reasons. Translate to her. Translate to her. I'm gonna tell the
[3:10:04.280 --> 3:10:07.640]  problems. The coach is wrong. Given the FBI, the
[3:10:07.640 --> 3:10:11.320]  codes is wrong. Uh, stuff like that's wrong.
[3:10:11.320 --> 3:10:14.840]  And Trump's wrong on some stuff. You attack him on stuff that isn't real.
[3:10:14.840 --> 3:10:19.480]  Right. Yeah, now, now Trump did come out for torture and he came out for
[3:10:19.480 --> 3:10:22.760]  the apple unlocking their iphone for the FBI.
[3:10:22.760 --> 3:10:25.960]  Which, those are wrong and we came out and said that's wrong, Trump. You can't do
[3:10:25.960 --> 3:10:27.880]  that. So we have to hold these people to the
[3:10:27.880 --> 3:10:31.400]  fire, but just coming out and saying he's racist, he's sexist, he employs a lot of
[3:10:31.400 --> 3:10:34.440]  people. He employs a lot of minorities. He probably employs more minorities than
[3:10:34.440 --> 3:10:39.160]  you know than you personally know. He employs all of his stuff he's getting
[3:10:39.160 --> 3:10:43.720]  for his campaign are from China. He doesn't employ people in this country.
[3:10:43.720 --> 3:10:47.640]  He employs people all over the place. He builds buildings.
[3:10:47.640 --> 3:10:52.040]  You know, he took a post office. He took, well, he took a post office in
[3:10:52.040 --> 3:10:54.200]  Washington D.C. that they were going to close down. They had to
[3:10:54.200 --> 3:10:57.960]  ask her if she wants me to give her a little enlightenment.
[3:10:57.960 --> 3:11:01.640]  No, he did it. He did it under budget and on time,
[3:11:01.640 --> 3:11:05.720]  which you can't get with any type of government program.
[3:11:05.720 --> 3:11:09.800]  They're teaching us the Pledge now.
[3:11:09.800 --> 3:11:13.480]  I wonder if the Hispanics that are here are saying that. Yeah, that's from
[3:11:13.480 --> 3:11:16.200]  Catechak, where he goes, you know, the Dalai Lama gave me total enlightenment
[3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:20.120]  when I died. So I got that going for me. Anyway, I do, let's talk to some more of
[3:11:20.120 --> 3:11:23.080]  these people. Is that a guy or a girl right there? Let's talk to them.
[3:11:23.080 --> 3:11:26.440]  The other one. This lady right here? No, no, turn to the right. That's a,
[3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:30.040]  there you go. All right. This is, she's, I guess, from
[3:11:30.040 --> 3:11:32.840]  students against... Skogar. That's a guy, dude.
[3:11:32.840 --> 3:11:36.920]  Why are you against Trump? Because, I'm sorry, my voice has been...
[3:11:36.920 --> 3:11:40.440]  You've been here screaming all the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3:11:40.440 --> 3:11:45.720]  There's the two sides of it. One's for me. He's on the checklist of the
[3:11:45.720 --> 3:11:49.000]  conservative agenda, which is personally, I don't agree with,
[3:11:49.000 --> 3:11:54.520]  but he's not only is he socially a bigot, which you can
[3:11:54.520 --> 3:11:58.040]  sell by his own. If people take a call. Just sell by his rhetoric. It's not like,
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:12:01.800]  it's not... You know how to get jobs or do any work. It's not like, be socially
[3:12:01.800 --> 3:12:04.920]  proper. Well, let me, let me ask you this. If he's, if he's got the conservative
[3:12:04.920 --> 3:12:07.720]  agenda, then why is the Republican establishment
[3:12:07.720 --> 3:12:09.640]  against him right now? The conservatives are against him.
[3:12:09.640 --> 3:12:14.760]  Because he's so... They've been, they know that they've been,
[3:12:14.760 --> 3:12:19.000]  they've been downing out. He is so... I can't hear from this guy. I mean, give me a
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:23.880]  poll. I'm gonna talk to him. Amoeba is smarter.
[3:12:23.880 --> 3:12:27.080]  He's so left-wing, he's the reason why they're losing there. They need to change
[3:12:27.080 --> 3:12:29.400]  them. They know that they saw that with them.
[3:12:29.400 --> 3:12:33.080]  No, he's winning is why they're against the Walnut brain.
[3:12:33.080 --> 3:12:36.920]  All right, let's move on to the next Walnut.
[3:12:36.920 --> 3:12:39.960]  Stop being mean. These people all think they're so smart. They're idiots. I mean,
[3:12:39.960 --> 3:12:43.320]  no one is dumber than a mainline liberal. They're like the most fascist
[3:12:43.320 --> 3:12:45.800]  people you've ever met. Let's just, I mean, I just disdain them.
[3:12:45.800 --> 3:12:49.400]  They, you know, let's just... Let's go to David Knight for a moment,
[3:12:49.400 --> 3:12:52.440]  Rob. Do you just stay there with this wonderful background stuff going on?
[3:12:52.440 --> 3:12:56.600]  You're in Ableton, Wisconsin. David Knight, good news. Bill introduced. Curt
[3:12:56.600 --> 3:13:00.360]  Emma wrote the article, infowars.com.
[3:13:00.360 --> 3:13:04.760]  Bill introduced in the House to strip BLM of police powers.
[3:13:04.760 --> 3:13:07.800]  Legislation follows Nevada and Oregon standoffs.
[3:13:07.800 --> 3:13:12.440]  That's some positive good news. And what do you make of all the other big Trump
[3:13:12.440 --> 3:13:15.640]  news? Well, that's excellent news, Alex. And we've
[3:13:15.640 --> 3:13:19.240]  talked about that. We've talked about how this special agent, Dan Love,
[3:13:19.240 --> 3:13:24.040]  has been given essentially dictatorial power across two states, across Nevada,
[3:13:24.040 --> 3:13:26.600]  as well as Utah. And, of course, he was one who presided
[3:13:26.600 --> 3:13:30.440]  over the Bundy Ranch standoff. He was even criticized by another
[3:13:30.440 --> 3:13:35.960]  agent at his level in Arizona. And so we've got the press in Utah, as well as
[3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:39.880]  Nevada, complaining about how this is out of control. And this started
[3:13:39.880 --> 3:13:44.840]  with 15 agents who were given uniforms that looked like park rangers and guns.
[3:13:44.840 --> 3:13:48.600]  And now it has turned into this full-blown military operation.
[3:13:48.600 --> 3:13:52.280]  The special agent in charge in Arizona said when he was looking at the Bundy
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:13:55.960]  Ranch standoff, he said, I can't believe this is the BLM
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:13:58.040]  that I work for anymore. So something needs to be done.
[3:13:58.040 --> 3:14:01.400]  By the way, Obama just grabbed millions acres in California two days ago.
[3:14:01.400 --> 3:14:04.920]  They are, the feds already have like 80% of the land out west.
[3:14:04.920 --> 3:14:09.480]  They're just grabbing all of it. What's happening is Obama is using his pen
[3:14:09.480 --> 3:14:13.800]  and a law from 1906 that was designed to protect Indian artifacts.
[3:14:13.800 --> 3:14:17.000]  Antiquities. Yes, the Antiquities Act, saying that
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:21.960]  he can declare millions and millions of acres to be Indian artifacts and just
[3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:26.040]  seize them. Now, one of the things that the Indians need to understand is this is
[3:14:26.040 --> 3:14:28.840]  not really protecting their interests, it's not protecting their land.
[3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:33.640]  It was a national monument, the Tonto National Forest
[3:14:33.640 --> 3:14:38.440]  monument, that is turned over to a foreign corporation to be strip-mined,
[3:14:38.440 --> 3:14:41.720]  be turned into a massive... I know, that's the great part is they're turning it over to
[3:14:41.720 --> 3:14:45.720]  the Chinese and others to like strip-mine it. And people are like, it's for the air,
[3:14:45.720 --> 3:14:49.560]  screw you, Republicans. No, it's not. I mean, that's why I say they're so dumb.
[3:14:49.560 --> 3:14:53.560]  If we talk to these people about land grabbing for strip-mining, they're
[3:14:53.560 --> 3:14:55.800]  going to call us racists. I mean, you know that right now.
[3:14:55.800 --> 3:14:59.240]  I mean, that's just the only word they know is xenophobia, racism,
[3:14:59.240 --> 3:15:03.240]  sexist, and they're like cult members. I don't know what to do, David.
[3:15:03.240 --> 3:15:06.760]  Well, and it's a shame too, Alex, because you know there's real racism out there.
[3:15:06.760 --> 3:15:11.400]  It's like when I was talking to Webster Tarpley at APAC and they were out there with
[3:15:11.400 --> 3:15:16.760]  Donald Trump as Hitler. You're not going to win any support at APAC
[3:15:16.760 --> 3:15:19.480]  when you make that kind of comparison. You're jumping the shark.
[3:15:19.480 --> 3:15:20.760]  There's not any comparison to that West River.
[3:15:20.760 --> 3:15:23.320]  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia says, kill one of the drive cars,
[3:15:23.320 --> 3:15:27.480]  chop gay's heads off, and all these people care. Real Hitler stuff's going on.
[3:15:27.480 --> 3:15:31.320]  They won't touch it. They'll just point at a white male that dares to talk and say,
[3:15:31.320 --> 3:15:35.800]  shut up, white male, check the privilege. And there's real racism out there.
[3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:40.280]  And when they cry wolf over these issues repeatedly, what they do is they give real
[3:15:40.280 --> 3:15:43.640]  racism a pass because people are getting so inoculated.
[3:15:43.640 --> 3:15:47.560]  The white supremacists in Europe and the U.S. are swelling their ranks right now.
[3:15:47.560 --> 3:15:50.120]  And you look at them with their beers and beating people up.
[3:15:50.120 --> 3:15:54.600]  They're just as dumb and scummy as the racist Mexicans, blacks, and all of them.
[3:15:54.600 --> 3:15:58.920]  Just what a bunch of idiots. Why is it the dumbasses are into this, David?
[3:15:58.920 --> 3:16:00.360]  I just can't understand it.
[3:16:01.080 --> 3:16:04.360]  Alex, I think when you look at these people, I think it's the colleges.
[3:16:04.360 --> 3:16:08.280]  I think it's why Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton want to extend free college to people.
[3:16:08.280 --> 3:16:11.400]  These people who are getting out in their mid-twenties have been institutionalized
[3:16:11.400 --> 3:16:16.280]  for over 20 years in most cases. They start out at three, and then they don't get out until they're
[3:16:16.280 --> 3:16:18.680]  20. They're like somebody come out of prison for 30 years. Exactly. They don't know what
[3:16:18.680 --> 3:16:22.200]  planet they're on. They have lived in a fishbowl. It's Stockholm syndrome.
[3:16:22.200 --> 3:16:25.880]  It absolutely is. They have lived in a system where they are told
[3:16:25.880 --> 3:16:29.320]  when they can get out of their desks, they have to get in a line, they have to raise their hand
[3:16:29.320 --> 3:16:34.040]  to talk. And now it's time to get active. Now the media tells them they can go out
[3:16:34.040 --> 3:16:38.600]  and scream two or three slogans and feel intellectual. And this is them earning their
[3:16:38.600 --> 3:16:43.480]  bones. This is them doing their tours in combat. They're women. They're men now.
[3:16:43.480 --> 3:16:49.000]  This is their time to shine and spout George Soros, Nazi collaborator garbage. Exactly.
[3:16:49.000 --> 3:16:52.760]  We're absolutely on target. Well, you know, when we were in Washington, DC,
[3:16:53.480 --> 3:16:57.800]  at the press conference as well as APAC, there was a handful of protesters out there,
[3:16:57.800 --> 3:17:01.880]  and they had a megaphone, and you couldn't talk to them. They wouldn't really engage in
[3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:05.320]  conversation. That's why waited until after everything had calmed down. They're so dumb,
[3:17:05.320 --> 3:17:11.080]  they read off admitted communist party scripts, and they stand there and chant a three word slogan
[3:17:11.080 --> 3:17:17.800]  over the over their bullhorn. I am dumb. Yeah. And they're not, they're not convincing anybody.
[3:17:17.800 --> 3:17:23.800]  They're just driving people away from their cause. But when they use these tactics of the left,
[3:17:23.800 --> 3:17:29.320]  this McCarthyism of the left to stifle any discussion by just screaming these same repeated
[3:17:29.320 --> 3:17:33.160]  words, the same tired charges, and they feel smart. You see that guy with the camera just felt
[3:17:33.160 --> 3:17:39.880]  smart saying the three word slogan. He's like, yeah, I mean, I'm sorry, this is a cult.
[3:17:39.880 --> 3:17:42.760]  Well, you got love, Trump's hate, love, I hate Trump and all this.
[3:17:43.480 --> 3:17:48.440]  My wife went over and talked to these kids and the father was standing by proud of them because
[3:17:48.440 --> 3:17:52.680]  they were just screaming out these slogans. They had absolutely no idea what they were doing.
[3:17:52.680 --> 3:17:57.960]  These kids were like seven and nine years old. But these college kids that you're looking at have
[3:17:57.960 --> 3:18:03.080]  no more discernment, no more sense, no more real world experience than those seven to nine-year-old
[3:18:03.080 --> 3:18:08.520]  kids that were out there just screaming repetitively. I hate Trump. Trump is a racist. That's, that's
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:13.160]  all they hear. Oh, race is the power. Just say that and mountains move. You're taking over in
[3:18:13.160 --> 3:18:16.680]  about a minute and a half. Do tell us what else is coming up tonight as you follow reports
[3:18:16.680 --> 3:18:21.160]  from FullWars.com. The nightly news is seven. And then David, dude, you got 30 seconds. Then David,
[3:18:21.160 --> 3:18:24.280]  you got a minute. Tell us what's coming up today. I'm going to punch you out. Great job, crew.
[3:18:24.280 --> 3:18:29.000]  All right. Well, right now the line has broken up at the Trump rally because they've let in,
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:33.080]  I guess, a thousand people and now there's no more room in the building. So you had,
[3:18:33.080 --> 3:18:38.200]  So the news is the Trump rallies overflowing as usual. Overflowing as usual. Three, it was at
[3:18:38.200 --> 3:18:42.200]  least three blocks long going down the street. You could see it going down that way. And then
[3:18:42.200 --> 3:18:47.720]  here's the hotel. And so some of that's breaking up, but it seems like the protesters are gathering
[3:18:47.720 --> 3:18:54.840]  numbers. A lot of Trump walking over here. In fact, we got a guy right here who's info wars
[3:18:54.840 --> 3:18:58.520]  and trumpets. Tell me why you like Donald Trump. Why I like Donald Trump? Well, because he speaks
[3:18:58.520 --> 3:19:03.880]  his mind. He's very focused on America. He's a clearly a nationalist, unlike the other candidates.
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:07.960]  That's right. Very supportive of law enforcement when they do right.
[3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:14.360]  Very, very, he wants to renegotiate our trade policies that have been
[3:19:14.360 --> 3:19:19.000]  unnegotiated for 30 some years when they were negotiated. Things are much different than they
[3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:24.840]  are now. They need to be renegotiated for our times now. This is probably the smartest Trump
[3:19:24.840 --> 3:19:28.920]  voter I've met today. You know, talk to him some more as we're over Ron. I'm skipping the break.
[3:19:28.920 --> 3:19:33.480]  It's so important. I go back to this guy. I can actually talk. This will be illegal in the future.
[3:19:35.320 --> 3:19:38.920]  Quite refreshing because a lot of people haven't been able to articulate the ideas as well as you
[3:19:38.920 --> 3:19:42.840]  have. What do you think about the Republican party coming out and like demonizing Trump and trying
[3:19:42.840 --> 3:19:47.720]  to steal the nomination from him? It just shows that he's not an establishment candidate that,
[3:19:47.720 --> 3:19:52.360]  yeah, he really will change the country. I mean, if he was an establishment, they'd be putting all
[3:19:52.360 --> 3:19:57.720]  their money behind him, constantly praising him. If he's nothing but good news, nothing but good
[3:19:57.720 --> 3:20:03.400]  things about him on the news. But the fact that they demonize him so much shows that he really
[3:20:03.400 --> 3:20:07.800]  is a force for change. Yeah. And a lot of the liberals don't understand that when you're getting
[3:20:07.800 --> 3:20:12.520]  hit on by both sides and hit down, you got to be doing something right. And they don't see that.
[3:20:12.520 --> 3:20:15.640]  You got these people over here. What do you think of these protesters over here? Well,
[3:20:15.640 --> 3:20:21.320]  it's interesting to see what they say and how kind of misinformed they are on the issues.
[3:20:21.960 --> 3:20:27.160]  But it's good to see that at least they're being peaceful and respectful and not throwing
[3:20:27.160 --> 3:20:33.800]  punches at people or trying to really disrupt too much. So yeah, what do you think of this
[3:20:33.800 --> 3:20:38.440]  comparing Trump to a Nazi? Trump is a Nazi. Here's a guy giving out Trump as a Nazi flyer right here.
[3:20:38.440 --> 3:20:45.160]  So we're not going to talk about the Associated Press up in the Nazi
[3:20:45.160 --> 3:20:48.760]  operation. Here's an article a day out of the Times of Israel. Number one.
[3:20:49.880 --> 3:20:54.360]  What has he done to increase the police day? Well, that's what he's proposing to do.
[3:20:54.360 --> 3:20:59.640]  Do you know what Obama's done? He's taken military. What about Hillary saying Blacks
[3:20:59.640 --> 3:21:03.000]  are super predators? They need to be healed. Police departments all across the country.
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:07.800]  Info wars. What's your name? Rob Do. Good to meet you. Nice to meet you. Craig Swalby.
[3:21:07.800 --> 3:21:11.640]  All right. Nice to meet you. Yeah. So, but you haven't told me why Trump's a Nazi.
[3:21:11.640 --> 3:21:18.760]  Real Nazis, folks. Real Nazis. Increased the police state. And expanding it.
[3:21:19.880 --> 3:21:24.280]  Okay. So he's this guy saying Trump's a Nazi because he wants to increase the police state.
[3:21:25.800 --> 3:21:30.440]  All right. So that equal that equals the Nazi isn't right there. I'm definitely against the
[3:21:30.440 --> 3:21:34.360]  police state. That's one thing that really attracted me to Alex Jones back when I was
[3:21:34.360 --> 3:21:39.080]  getting information and searching the internet is because you were definitely
[3:21:39.080 --> 3:21:42.920]  one of the first people to talk about the police state and how big it's got.
[3:21:42.920 --> 3:21:49.160]  And the Nazis. We're experts. Yeah, exactly. But now, but you haven't turned that as a
[3:21:49.160 --> 3:21:56.040]  Nazism. So are you guys, you guys, uh, Trump fans? Yes, I'm really approved of building the wall.
[3:21:56.040 --> 3:22:05.400]  All right. But I don't disagree with Trump on a lot of things.
[3:22:06.280 --> 3:22:10.360]  I was leading a little towards Rubio. And I'm a K-Stick bandwagon now.
[3:22:10.360 --> 3:22:12.600]  Talk to that blonde. Talk to that every wool owner.
[3:22:12.600 --> 3:22:15.000]  We're just going to play K-Sticks Redo's campaign with the Rambo flag.
[3:22:15.800 --> 3:22:24.120]  All right. No, human is illegal. No, human is illegal. No, I'm live. Hey guys, don't vote for
[3:22:24.120 --> 3:22:27.720]  Trump, please. Ask her why. Tell us about the deal. Why don't you like Trump? Tell me.
[3:22:27.720 --> 3:22:31.880]  I don't think that any political agenda should be run by hate against any type of people.
[3:22:31.880 --> 3:22:35.240]  You know, even people in America. Tell us about the hate. Other governments have walls.
[3:22:36.040 --> 3:22:38.200]  Ask her about the hate. Discrimination against them.
[3:22:38.200 --> 3:22:40.840]  You know, you know that the Saudi Arabian government today came out and said they want
[3:22:40.840 --> 3:22:45.240]  to execute all gay people in their country. I did not know that. And Trump wants to stop them
[3:22:45.240 --> 3:22:49.880]  coming here. It's illegal in several different countries. It's not illegal here. That's okay,
[3:22:49.880 --> 3:22:55.080]  though. I don't think it's going to make it illegal either, but I think that
[3:22:55.080 --> 3:22:58.360]  because the media made it feel good to be out here against women and different races,
[3:22:58.360 --> 3:23:02.360]  different religions. I think that's saying that all terrorists are Muslim and that
[3:23:02.360 --> 3:23:05.560]  as your first love of the three along neighborhoods and like,
[3:23:06.440 --> 3:23:10.200]  what was that, John? What? Ask your first love of the three along with a job.
[3:23:11.000 --> 3:23:15.880]  Yeah, I just think it's ridiculous to just discriminate against an entire religion because
[3:23:15.880 --> 3:23:21.240]  of just an entire religion. Would you be willing to wear a hijab, one of those Muslim
[3:23:22.360 --> 3:23:25.800]  headed scarfs if it was the law here? Would you be willing to do that?
[3:23:27.560 --> 3:23:31.400]  I wouldn't be willing to do that because it's not my religion. So that's cultural appropriation.
[3:23:31.400 --> 3:23:34.360]  Nobody want to know cultural. No, they're going to make you do it, dumbass.
[3:23:34.360 --> 3:23:36.040]  I don't know if I could do anything just because the government tells me.
[3:23:36.040 --> 3:23:40.280]  Oh God, get the clip ready where the black folks beat up the white kid for being
[3:23:40.280 --> 3:23:46.920]  free. Cultural appropriation. So black people can straighten their hair. You dumbass.
[3:23:48.840 --> 3:23:53.480]  Go back to her. Look at these morons, man. That's what college gets you right there.
[3:23:55.080 --> 3:23:57.320]  She's not worried about Saudi Arabia killing everybody.
[3:23:59.240 --> 3:24:04.760]  Good Lord. We have job. We have job. We have job. We have job. We have job. We have job. We have job.
[3:24:04.760 --> 3:24:08.120]  We're being, we're being ruled by the lowest common denominator.
[3:24:08.120 --> 3:24:13.560]  No, no, but go back to them and just say, you ask them, why can Mexico have a southern border
[3:24:13.560 --> 3:24:20.040]  and a wall, but we can't. And I'll ask that note all in there about appropriation. Go ahead.
[3:24:20.920 --> 3:24:24.680]  Okay. So Mexico has a wall at its southern border with Guatemala.
[3:24:24.680 --> 3:24:29.560]  Why should we not have our border secured? Because there's no reason that the percentage
[3:24:29.560 --> 3:24:35.000]  of illegal immigrants to our criminals is ridiculous. There's a higher rate of people
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:39.160]  in the United States who are born here that are criminals than illegal immigrants.
[3:24:39.160 --> 3:24:42.040]  That's not true. Ask her source. Her source.
[3:24:42.760 --> 3:24:44.680]  All people. What's your source for that?
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:47.240]  What? Your source for that?
[3:24:47.240 --> 3:24:51.160]  A bunch of different places. You can look it up. Like there were a bunch of different
[3:24:51.160 --> 3:24:56.360]  surveys taken and the percentage of immigrants who come here, who are criminals, is lower
[3:24:56.360 --> 3:24:58.760]  than the number of people who are naturally born here.
[3:24:58.760 --> 3:25:02.440]  Did you hear the sheriff these days, Paul Babu from Arizona, who basically said,
[3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:05.240]  we're not allowed to do our job. He's in Southern Arizona, right at the border.
[3:25:05.240 --> 3:25:10.120]  He said, Obama's not allowed us to do our job. We are not allowed to, you know, secure the border,
[3:25:10.120 --> 3:25:13.240]  essentially. Do you, do you not think having a secure border is important?
[3:25:13.240 --> 3:25:17.160]  I do think having a secure border is important, but Mexico has the highest crime rate in the
[3:25:17.160 --> 3:25:23.560]  world. Hit her with that. It's like treating the top level of the problem instead of addressing
[3:25:23.560 --> 3:25:28.200]  what's actually 100,000 dead. Mexico has a very high crime rate. They've killed almost 50,000
[3:25:28.200 --> 3:25:32.840]  people with the drugs. 100,000. We also have a very high crime rate. No. Mexico has the highest
[3:25:32.840 --> 3:25:37.320]  crime rate. But we all know that growing crime rate and our rate of sexual violence is going
[3:25:37.320 --> 3:25:43.480]  up significantly in the past eight years. Here, and you know. Yes, sexual crime has been on the
[3:25:43.480 --> 3:25:46.760]  rise for the past 20 years. It's also going up in Europe, and it's because a lot of the migrants,
[3:25:46.760 --> 3:25:52.680]  they're saying 100% of the rapes in Sweden are done by migrants. I think blaming people is not
[3:25:52.680 --> 3:25:56.920]  where love comes from. And she agrees with the Germans. Let's play the German man. It's her fault,
[3:25:56.920 --> 3:26:02.440]  Kim. Keep talking to her. This is the face of brainwashing. This is the face. So say, is it
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:07.640]  a cultural appropriation? Lin Isis makes women wear headdresses. And they don't want to deal with
[3:26:07.640 --> 3:26:12.040]  the actual problem. What do you think the real problems are? Is it all just racism and sexism?
[3:26:12.040 --> 3:26:15.800]  No, I don't think that's it. I think it all comes down to how we treat one another.
[3:26:15.800 --> 3:26:21.640]  Ask her if China can have a 40% tariff on us. Why Trump's wrong? It's ridiculous. What about the
[3:26:21.640 --> 3:26:26.600]  trade tariff with China? How they have a 40% on our goods? 40% of trade tariff
[3:26:26.600 --> 3:26:30.280]  with China on our currency tariff. And we have nothing on theirs.
[3:26:30.840 --> 3:26:33.640]  Well, then we should deal with that. But I don't think that...
[3:26:33.640 --> 3:26:35.240]  Trump's the only one that said he's going to deal with them.
[3:26:35.240 --> 3:26:38.200]  But has Trump said anyway that he's actually going to?
[3:26:38.760 --> 3:26:42.600]  Yeah, he's just going to say, we're not going to pay our tariff. He's going to negotiate.
[3:26:42.600 --> 3:26:45.880]  That's not how things work. If you're president, you can't just say,
[3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:48.520]  you're not going to do that. You have to go through Congress. You have to go through Senate.
[3:26:48.520 --> 3:26:48.840]  You can't just...
[3:26:48.840 --> 3:26:53.880]  See, she won't say he's wrong. She just says he can't do it. God, what an enemy of the country.
[3:26:53.880 --> 3:26:59.080]  They run every... This is the enemy right here. She just hates everything. She can't wipe her ass.
[3:26:59.080 --> 3:27:00.120]  But she knows everything.
[3:27:00.120 --> 3:27:01.480]  That's not the way that it works.
[3:27:01.480 --> 3:27:03.480]  You're very well-spoken. Are you in college right now?
[3:27:03.480 --> 3:27:05.000]  I'm a senior in high school, actually.
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:06.520]  Senior in high school. Look at that.
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:07.400]  You're very well-spoken.
[3:27:07.400 --> 3:27:08.680]  You're very smartly in high school.
[3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:11.720]  And are you going to college?
[3:27:11.720 --> 3:27:12.840]  I am going to college.
[3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:13.960]  As you're what she wants to be.
[3:27:14.760 --> 3:27:15.800]  What are you going to major in?
[3:27:15.800 --> 3:27:16.760]  Political science.
[3:27:16.760 --> 3:27:20.280]  Political science major. So you're going to tell people about cultural
[3:27:20.280 --> 3:27:21.960]  appropriations and microaggressions.
[3:27:21.960 --> 3:27:22.440]  Oh, yeah.
[3:27:22.440 --> 3:27:23.880]  Oh, yeah.
[3:27:23.880 --> 3:27:26.920]  So do you like puppies or kittens in your safe space?
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:28.840]  I like kittens. I'm a cat person.
[3:27:30.520 --> 3:27:32.760]  Coloring crayons or colored pencils?
[3:27:33.320 --> 3:27:35.480]  Colored pencils. You know, you get a nicer mark.
[3:27:36.920 --> 3:27:40.440]  All right. It's clearly degenerated into a safe space conversation.
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:43.800]  Although she's a very good speaker. I gotta hand it to her that way.
[3:27:43.800 --> 3:27:47.640]  Yeah, she's a very good speaker. Oh, yeah. You can talk. Most of your people can't talk.
[3:27:47.640 --> 3:27:49.080]  I know. I know. A lot of people can't talk.
[3:27:49.080 --> 3:27:49.880]  You can talk.
[3:27:49.880 --> 3:27:52.440]  I have a lot of articulator ideas, so I'm very impressed.
[3:27:53.080 --> 3:27:54.600]  Anyway, y'all have a good one?
[3:27:55.240 --> 3:27:58.440]  Look at this one. I mean, I can't handle it.
[3:27:58.440 --> 3:27:59.800]  Hey, dude. Look at that one.
[3:27:59.800 --> 3:28:01.640]  Oh my gosh. There is David Knight's son.
[3:28:01.640 --> 3:28:03.000]  David, what's it like to see your son there?
[3:28:04.600 --> 3:28:06.520]  He's like a mental giant compared to them.
[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:09.000]  Actually, Alex, they had him on the Daily Mail.
[3:28:09.000 --> 3:28:10.520]  They actually showed Travis.
[3:28:10.520 --> 3:28:13.400]  It looked like he was one of the protesters because he's staying there with the camera.
[3:28:14.040 --> 3:28:14.920]  Are you guys for Trump?
[3:28:16.280 --> 3:28:16.520]  I don't know.
[3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:17.240]  What are you here for?
[3:28:17.240 --> 3:28:18.280]  We don't have bikes here.
[3:28:18.280 --> 3:28:19.880]  We don't have bikes. We don't have bikes.
[3:28:19.880 --> 3:28:20.600]  This is awesome.
[3:28:20.600 --> 3:28:23.000]  Hey, I'm going to punch out and let you and dude take over.
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:23.720]  Great job.
[3:28:23.720 --> 3:28:24.840]  I'm going to go to break here in one minute.
[3:28:24.840 --> 3:28:26.120]  Let's fade on audio for a moment.
[3:28:26.120 --> 3:28:28.120]  Hey, we are early systems.
[3:28:28.120 --> 3:28:28.680]  All right.
[3:28:28.680 --> 3:28:29.560]  Oh, it's another listener.
[3:28:29.560 --> 3:28:33.080]  We are funded by the products at enforcelife.com and enforcestore.com.
[3:28:33.080 --> 3:28:35.640]  The Hillary for President's Church is seeing all those folks wearing
[3:28:35.640 --> 3:28:38.600]  the best of vitamin mineral amino acid fusion out there.
[3:28:38.600 --> 3:28:40.280]  We took two years to develop this.
[3:28:41.320 --> 3:28:42.600]  It's concentrated.
[3:28:42.600 --> 3:28:43.800]  It's $39.95.
[3:28:43.800 --> 3:28:46.680]  The leading competitors that have the same amount of stuff at them are $60.
[3:28:46.680 --> 3:28:48.280]  This is a great deal.
[3:28:48.280 --> 3:28:52.440]  Infowarslife.com and your support of the broadcast puts our reporters in the field
[3:28:52.440 --> 3:28:54.760]  all over America, all over the world.

[3:29:02.520 --> 3:29:04.600]  It would have been one of the first, but it's such a game changer.

[3:29:16.680 --> 3:29:18.040]  Infowarslife.com.
[3:29:18.040 --> 3:29:20.120]  No reviews yet because it just came out today.
[3:29:20.120 --> 3:29:21.080]  Two years in the making.
[3:29:21.080 --> 3:29:25.560]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[3:29:25.560 --> 3:29:27.320]  Infowars is the house you built.
[3:29:27.320 --> 3:29:31.480]  By the products, the X2, the Superman, you name it, the oxy powder,
[3:29:31.480 --> 3:29:32.600]  you fund this operation.

[3:29:34.280 --> 3:29:35.720]  Infowarslife.com.
[3:29:35.720 --> 3:29:37.720]  David Knight from Austin, Texas.
[3:29:37.720 --> 3:29:46.440]  Coming up along with Rob Doos from Ableton Wisconsin as the Infowar goes into high gear.
[3:29:46.440 --> 3:29:48.120]  I'll be back tonight.
[3:29:48.120 --> 3:29:59.080]  We're on the march with the crew 7 o'clock central, Alex Central, Central, Central, Central.
[3:29:59.080 --> 3:30:04.200]  As the Supreme Court wrestles with whether or not it will compel nuns to buy abortion insurance,
[3:30:04.200 --> 3:30:11.200]  It should be a reminder of how absurd it is to trust our liberty to nine political appointees
[3:30:11.200 --> 3:30:15.200]  who believe the Constitution can be amended by their opinions.
[3:30:15.200 --> 3:30:20.200]  NBC News reports that a quarter of Republican senators now want to meet with Obama's Supreme
[3:30:20.200 --> 3:30:21.200]  Court nominee.
[3:30:21.200 --> 3:30:26.200]  Much has been said about Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland's record opposing the Second Amendment.
[3:30:26.200 --> 3:30:30.500]  What hasn't been talked about is his long record of rubber stamping any rule from any
[3:30:30.500 --> 3:30:32.200]  federal regulatory agency.
[3:30:32.200 --> 3:30:37.200]  Garland will be a reliable ally of the real government, the federal bureaucracies.
[3:30:37.200 --> 3:30:42.200]  With Scalia's death, the Supreme Court is expected to be deadlocked on Obama's EPA regulations
[3:30:42.200 --> 3:30:44.200]  to shut down the coal industry.
[3:30:44.200 --> 3:30:48.200]  The lower court on which Garland now serves will have the final say.
[3:30:48.200 --> 3:30:53.200]  He will take Scalia's place on this important issue, regardless of whether he takes Scalia's
[3:30:53.200 --> 3:31:00.200]  place on the court.
[3:31:24.200 --> 3:31:26.200]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[3:31:26.200 --> 3:31:30.200]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old
[3:31:30.200 --> 3:31:34.200]  scientific research that puts together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.

[3:32:45.200 --> 3:32:47.200]  skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[3:33:11.200 --> 3:33:16.200]  I'm David Knight, and this fourth hour we have our reporters live at the scene of a
[3:33:16.200 --> 3:33:17.200]  Trump rally.
[3:33:17.200 --> 3:33:19.200]  We're going to go back to Rob Do and the rest of the crew.
[3:33:19.200 --> 3:33:23.200]  In just a moment, before we do, I want to tell you about a terrorist dog that has a
[3:33:23.200 --> 3:33:25.200]  lesson for the human sheep out there.
[3:33:25.200 --> 3:33:27.200]  This is a story that was on the Drudge Report.
[3:33:27.200 --> 3:33:32.200]  A dog whose name is Dash sounded too much like the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State,
[3:33:32.200 --> 3:33:34.200]  the Jihadist group.
[3:33:34.200 --> 3:33:37.200]  And so it prompted a scare at a California bank.
[3:33:37.200 --> 3:33:43.200]  And what happened was the dog's owner was paying someone who walks his pitbull mix,
[3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:48.200]  and he wrote in the memo line on his online check the word Dash.
[3:33:48.200 --> 3:33:52.200]  Now, they went through and filtered it for the keywords, and they thought it looked too
[3:33:52.200 --> 3:33:55.200]  close to Daesh with an extra E in there.
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:34:00.200]  So they canceled the payments, and then they turned him into the U.S. Treasury Department.
[3:34:00.200 --> 3:34:01.200]  And he got a call.
[3:34:01.200 --> 3:34:04.200]  They said, explain to us what Dash means.
[3:34:04.200 --> 3:34:06.200]  And so he thought it was kind of funny.
[3:34:06.200 --> 3:34:10.200]  He reported this to the local news group in San Francisco.
[3:34:10.200 --> 3:34:13.200]  It was KTVU.
[3:34:13.200 --> 3:34:17.200]  He says he's taking the incident in stride, and he didn't mind the inconvenience.
[3:34:17.200 --> 3:34:23.200]  See, that's the kind of sheepish attitude that is enabling the police state.
[3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:24.200]  You ought to be outraged.
[3:34:24.200 --> 3:34:29.200]  And you ought to be outraged about the fact, not just that he got questioned on that.
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:32.200]  You ought to understand what is truly going on here.
[3:34:32.200 --> 3:34:37.200]  You know, we've talked about what happens with the money laundering and financial crime centers
[3:34:37.200 --> 3:34:42.200]  as they're looking for money that's being transferred to terrorist organizations to drug cartels.
[3:34:42.200 --> 3:34:47.200]  This all came out during the HSBC trials, and they actually didn't go to trial.
[3:34:47.200 --> 3:34:50.200]  It was actually the accusations against them.
[3:34:50.200 --> 3:34:54.200]  They were given a pass by Obama's Attorney General Eric Holder.
[3:34:54.200 --> 3:34:56.200]  They said they're too big to jail.
[3:34:56.200 --> 3:35:03.200]  It just doesn't serve the interests of the American people or the American government to send any of these officials to jail.
[3:35:03.200 --> 3:35:05.200]  And it wasn't their first time.
[3:35:05.200 --> 3:35:07.200]  They'd been caught multiple times doing this.
[3:35:07.200 --> 3:35:09.200]  They'd actually been put on probation.
[3:35:09.200 --> 3:35:12.200]  They'd hired someone that we interviewed here multiple times.
[3:35:12.200 --> 3:35:13.200]  His name is Everett Stern.
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:14.200]  He was a whistleblower.
[3:35:14.200 --> 3:35:18.200]  He went to the public and said, look, the government is giving them a pass.
[3:35:18.200 --> 3:35:19.200]  They've done this multiple times.
[3:35:19.200 --> 3:35:22.200]  He said they were caught once, and then they hired a bunch of people to come in
[3:35:22.200 --> 3:35:28.200]  and make sure they weren't laundering money for terrorists and drug organizations like the Sinaloa Cartel.
[3:35:28.200 --> 3:35:29.200]  Remember El Chapo?
[3:35:29.200 --> 3:35:33.200]  Everybody was all upset about the fact that he escaped prison,
[3:35:33.200 --> 3:35:41.200]  yet they didn't care about the fact that HSBC was laundering money for him, gave him his own personal checkout window.
[3:35:41.200 --> 3:35:45.200]  The Sinaloa Cartel that he was head of had their own personal checkout window at HSBC.
[3:35:45.200 --> 3:35:48.200]  This was the second round after they'd already been caught once.
[3:35:48.200 --> 3:35:53.200]  One of the things they did with Everett Stern and the other people that they hired as a beard,
[3:35:53.200 --> 3:35:58.200]  as a front, as a cover-up for their continued money laundering operations,
[3:35:58.200 --> 3:36:03.200]  was they would go into the database of search terms that would have the names of certain locations,
[3:36:03.200 --> 3:36:09.200]  certain cities that they were watching, certain people, certain organizations like Daesh,
[3:36:09.200 --> 3:36:13.200]  and they would go into that database and they would alter the words slightly.
[3:36:13.200 --> 3:36:14.200]  They would add a character.
[3:36:14.200 --> 3:36:15.200]  They would drop a character.
[3:36:15.200 --> 3:36:16.200]  They would add a period.
[3:36:16.200 --> 3:36:21.200]  They would put a space in between different words that weren't there or removed spaces that should be there
[3:36:21.200 --> 3:36:25.200]  to make sure that these things were not flagged.
[3:36:25.200 --> 3:36:29.200]  See, that was done, meanwhile, people like Everett Stern, who didn't realize this at first,
[3:36:29.200 --> 3:36:35.200]  thought that he was being diligent, that he was looking for money that was going to a terrorist organization.
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:37.200]  That's what's behind this.
[3:36:37.200 --> 3:36:42.200]  And I wouldn't be surprised if the same thing is happening with this particular bank,
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:47.200]  if they took the word Daesh and they removed the E so that it said Daesh.
[3:36:47.200 --> 3:36:52.200]  And then when this guy writes it in his comment line, he gets a call from the Treasury Department.
[3:36:52.200 --> 3:36:55.200]  He gets turned in by them asking to explain what's going on.
[3:36:55.200 --> 3:36:58.200]  We need to explain this to the American people.
[3:36:58.200 --> 3:37:02.200]  They need to understand this whole thing as a fraud from the top to the bottom.
[3:37:02.200 --> 3:37:07.200]  They need to understand that we've got the dark alliance that was exposed by Gary Webb.
[3:37:07.200 --> 3:37:12.200]  We've got the U.S. government under Ronald Reagan creating a crack cocaine epidemic
[3:37:12.200 --> 3:37:17.200]  so they can then fund their covert wars in Central America.
[3:37:17.200 --> 3:37:18.200]  And that type of thing is going on.
[3:37:18.200 --> 3:37:19.200]  It's not just Ronald Reagan.
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:21.200]  It's been going on with everything that they've been doing.
[3:37:21.200 --> 3:37:28.200]  At the very top, the war on drugs as well as this war on terror are organizations
[3:37:28.200 --> 3:37:33.200]  that are tightly allied to the political establishment, to the banking establishment,
[3:37:33.200 --> 3:37:38.200]  and they give themselves passes even though they are laundering billions of dollars
[3:37:38.200 --> 3:37:40.200]  for these criminal organizations.
[3:37:40.200 --> 3:37:43.200]  That's what's really behind the story about Daesh, the terrorist dog.
[3:37:43.200 --> 3:37:46.200]  Now I want to go back to the rally that Rob Dew is covering.
[3:37:46.200 --> 3:37:48.200]  We've got him on the line still, right folks?
[3:37:48.200 --> 3:37:51.200]  Okay, let's go back to Rob Dew live at the rally.
[3:37:51.200 --> 3:37:53.200]  Rob, tell us what's going on there.
[3:37:53.200 --> 3:37:56.200]  Yeah, well, the anti-Trump protesters have grown in size.
[3:37:56.200 --> 3:38:01.200]  Also some pro-Trump people have come back over here and run through the crowd going Trump, Trump, Trump.
[3:38:01.200 --> 3:38:07.200]  And then you can see the crowd has thinned out but there's still some very virulent Trump supporters still here.
[3:38:07.200 --> 3:38:09.200]  And they're yelling slogans back and forth.
[3:38:09.200 --> 3:38:11.200]  So this is what we've got going on.
[3:38:11.200 --> 3:38:13.200]  A little bit of free speech.
[3:38:13.200 --> 3:38:18.200]  Well, you say they're virulent, are they dangerous and these other protesters aren't Rob?
[3:38:18.200 --> 3:38:20.200]  No, no, no.
[3:38:20.200 --> 3:38:22.200]  I'm just hardcore Trump supporters.
[3:38:22.200 --> 3:38:24.200]  They were screaming from across the street.
[3:38:24.200 --> 3:38:28.200]  They had slogans going back and forth, which I didn't see from the other Trump supporters before.
[3:38:28.200 --> 3:38:33.200]  So you're seeing a hardcore contingent who really want to make their voice be heard.
[3:38:33.200 --> 3:38:38.200]  So in terms of virulent, I didn't see that with any of the supporters yesterday,
[3:38:38.200 --> 3:38:42.200]  except when they started marching around in circles when the anti-Trump protesters
[3:38:42.200 --> 3:38:43.200]  started marching around in circles.
[3:38:43.200 --> 3:38:45.200]  Then some pro-Trump people started marching with them.
[3:38:45.200 --> 3:38:49.200]  But for the most part, the Trump people seem to be real like laid back,
[3:38:49.200 --> 3:38:52.200]  chilled people who want to come in who just want to come to these events.
[3:38:52.200 --> 3:38:54.200]  But look, here they go now.
[3:38:54.200 --> 3:38:55.200]  They're doing the...
[3:38:55.200 --> 3:39:00.200]  Well, it makes sense for them to be marching in circles because their arguments are circular as well.
[3:39:00.200 --> 3:39:01.200]  Exactly.
[3:39:01.200 --> 3:39:02.200]  Hey, I want to point this out.
[3:39:02.200 --> 3:39:06.200]  Fox News over here is over on this side getting the anti-Trump protesters,
[3:39:06.200 --> 3:39:13.200]  which seems to be the big thing, the mainstream media comes and focuses on the anti-Trump protesters
[3:39:13.200 --> 3:39:15.200]  rather than talking with the pro-Trump people.
[3:39:15.200 --> 3:39:16.200]  Yeah.
[3:39:16.200 --> 3:39:18.200]  And most of the mainstream media hasn't been seen.
[3:39:18.200 --> 3:39:20.200]  At least Fox is out here covering something.
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:21.200]  But...
[3:39:21.200 --> 3:39:22.200]  Well, that's true.
[3:39:22.200 --> 3:39:24.200]  And of course, there's a lot of beards that are going out there.
[3:39:24.200 --> 3:39:30.200]  I know you don't see this, but the top story of the Drudge Report is Cory the prosecutor,
[3:39:30.200 --> 3:39:35.200]  the person who is prosecuting the campaign manager for Donald Trump, Cory Lewandowski,
[3:39:35.200 --> 3:39:38.200]  has been outed as a Hillary Clinton supporter.
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:41.200]  This guy is a Florida prosecutor.
[3:39:41.200 --> 3:39:44.200]  He bought battery charges against Donald Trump's campaign manager,
[3:39:44.200 --> 3:39:47.200]  but he supports Hillary Clinton's campaign for presence.
[3:39:47.200 --> 3:39:53.200]  An article published by the Palm Beach Post this last November has been circulating since Tuesday
[3:39:53.200 --> 3:40:00.200]  because it lists Palm Beach County State Attorney David Ehrenberg as a member of a 150-member Florida leadership council
[3:40:00.200 --> 3:40:05.200]  established by the Democrat Party to promote Hillary Clinton's presidential candidacy.
[3:40:05.200 --> 3:40:06.200]  There you go.
[3:40:06.200 --> 3:40:07.200]  That's one way to support her.
[3:40:07.200 --> 3:40:10.200]  Try to lock up her main competition's campaign manager.
[3:40:10.200 --> 3:40:12.200]  Well, how do you get that job?
[3:40:12.200 --> 3:40:17.200]  I mean, it makes you wonder how he's hiring people if somebody like that is able to infiltrate.
[3:40:17.200 --> 3:40:18.200]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[3:40:18.200 --> 3:40:22.200]  Well, you know, I heard you talking to that young girl who's in college.
[3:40:22.200 --> 3:40:25.200]  You said she was a political science major, you know.
[3:40:25.200 --> 3:40:29.200]  When you find another political science major, you need to ask them to say for you on air,
[3:40:29.200 --> 3:40:32.200]  do you want fries with that order?
[3:40:32.200 --> 3:40:33.200]  What was that?
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:34.200]  Do you want fries with that order?
[3:40:34.200 --> 3:40:35.200]  Do you want fries with that order?
[3:40:35.200 --> 3:40:38.200]  The thing is, the problem is, the reality is that Rob,
[3:40:38.200 --> 3:40:45.200]  is that she'll probably wind up going to Washington and getting a $300,000 job telling the rest of us what to do,
[3:40:45.200 --> 3:40:47.200]  when to jump, and how high.
[3:40:47.200 --> 3:40:49.200]  That's the reality of the world that we live in now.
[3:40:49.200 --> 3:40:52.200]  In a just world, she would be saying, do you want fries with that?
[3:40:52.200 --> 3:40:53.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:40:57.200]  Hey, I got a couple of Trump supporters over here who I was talking to earlier.
[3:40:57.200 --> 3:40:58.200]  And what's your name, sir?
[3:40:58.200 --> 3:40:59.200]  Gary, you are.
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:01.200]  And why are you supporting Trump?
[3:41:01.200 --> 3:41:03.200]  A lot of reasons.
[3:41:03.200 --> 3:41:09.200]  He's going to expose 9-11, and the Federal Reserve, maybe.
[3:41:09.200 --> 3:41:11.200]  Gary brought up something interesting to me.
[3:41:11.200 --> 3:41:14.200]  He said Trump went to a Jesuit college, which I didn't know.
[3:41:14.200 --> 3:41:16.200]  So I thought that was pretty interesting.
[3:41:16.200 --> 3:41:19.200]  And that's definitely something we probably want to look into, those Jesuit connections,
[3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:25.200]  as we know the Jesuits have taken over Vatican City, essentially, and kind of run that.
[3:41:25.200 --> 3:41:29.200]  So what's the economy like here right now?
[3:41:29.200 --> 3:41:30.200]  Terrible.
[3:41:30.200 --> 3:41:33.200]  I was at the Bernie thing yesterday.
[3:41:33.200 --> 3:41:35.200]  I went to go to check it out.
[3:41:35.200 --> 3:41:39.200]  He asked how many people in the crowd took the day off of work to come here.
[3:41:39.200 --> 3:41:41.200]  Not very many hands went out.
[3:41:41.200 --> 3:41:43.200]  Did you hear that, David?
[3:41:43.200 --> 3:41:44.200]  Yeah, I guess.
[3:41:44.200 --> 3:41:47.200]  I don't know if they don't have jobs, but probably all college students.
[3:41:47.200 --> 3:41:48.200]  I was kind of disappointed.
[3:41:48.200 --> 3:41:50.200]  Like, maybe I want a job, but I can't get one.
[3:41:50.200 --> 3:41:53.200]  Well, the government's going to give them a job, and it's going to be sitting at home
[3:41:53.200 --> 3:41:55.200]  when we send you a check, and everything will be all right.
[3:41:55.200 --> 3:41:58.200]  But just don't get out of line, do what we say.
[3:41:58.200 --> 3:42:00.200]  Yeah, sounds about right.
[3:42:00.200 --> 3:42:02.200]  Rob, what he should have asked as a follow-up, he said,
[3:42:02.200 --> 3:42:05.200]  how many people took off work to come to the Bernie rally today?
[3:42:05.200 --> 3:42:08.200]  Bernie said, you should ask people, well, how many of you want a job?
[3:42:08.200 --> 3:42:10.200]  How many of you would like your neighbor's money?
[3:42:10.200 --> 3:42:13.200]  Because that's really what he's proposing.
[3:42:13.200 --> 3:42:14.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:42:14.200 --> 3:42:19.200]  And a lot of the kids here, I would say 70% of these kids are high school.
[3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:22.200]  70%, probably even more.
[3:42:22.200 --> 3:42:26.200]  Definitely, you know, high school kids, they're buying into whatever's being told.
[3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:28.200]  Maybe it's in their high school.
[3:42:28.200 --> 3:42:33.200]  Travis was heard when he was at the other, we're at the college today, St. Norbert.
[3:42:33.200 --> 3:42:37.200]  He heard one of the professors there with his students while they were doing their silent protest.
[3:42:37.200 --> 3:42:38.200]  They really wouldn't talk to us at all.
[3:42:38.200 --> 3:42:43.200]  I got a couple of people to talk, but he was really there sitting coaching them on, you know,
[3:42:43.200 --> 3:42:46.200]  what to do, how to talk, how to think.
[3:42:46.200 --> 3:42:47.200]  And that's what they did.
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:49.200]  That's how they train these people in these universities.
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:50.200]  Oh, yeah?
[3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:52.200]  That's what Ryan wants to say.
[3:42:52.200 --> 3:42:55.200]  And if you're outside of that, then, you know, you're a trouble maker.
[3:42:55.200 --> 3:42:56.200]  You're going to get worse grades.
[3:42:56.200 --> 3:42:58.200]  My brother had that problem when he was going for his master's degree.
[3:42:58.200 --> 3:43:03.200]  He was writing papers on Ron Paul and how they were stealing the elections from him based on, you know,
[3:43:03.200 --> 3:43:06.200]  the number of supporters that are at his rallies.
[3:43:06.200 --> 3:43:08.200]  And boy, they did not like that.
[3:43:08.200 --> 3:43:10.200]  They didn't want to see that paper come up.
[3:43:10.200 --> 3:43:13.200]  And that was, I think, one of his master's thesis.
[3:43:13.200 --> 3:43:17.200]  Well, you know, you mentioned Ron Paul, and there was an interesting article today,
[3:43:17.200 --> 3:43:21.200]  talking about how the GOP panelists are eager to scrap the rule that helps Trump.
[3:43:21.200 --> 3:43:23.200]  And this is on Politico.
[3:43:23.200 --> 3:43:25.200]  And listen to what they said, Rob.
[3:43:25.200 --> 3:43:30.200]  They said four early appointees to the Rules Committee say the Republican Convention Rule is an artificial one.
[3:43:30.200 --> 3:43:31.200]  Of course, this is Rule 40.
[3:43:31.200 --> 3:43:36.200]  They say the four took issue with a rule that was originally imposed by Mitt Romney forces in 2012
[3:43:36.200 --> 3:43:39.200]  to keep rival Ron Paul off the convention stage,
[3:43:39.200 --> 3:43:42.200]  requiring a candidate to win a majority of delegates in eight states
[3:43:42.200 --> 3:43:44.200]  in order to be eligible for nomination.
[3:43:44.200 --> 3:43:47.200]  They say this is a threshold that only Trump has exceeded so far.
[3:43:47.200 --> 3:43:54.200]  If preserved, the rule could block John Kasich or even Ted Cruz from competing with Trump at the convention in July.
[3:43:54.200 --> 3:43:57.200]  Now, they say this, they have a quote from a guy, David Wheeler,
[3:43:57.200 --> 3:44:00.200]  who is a Rules Committee member from South Dakota.
[3:44:00.200 --> 3:44:01.200]  And listen to what he says, Rob.
[3:44:01.200 --> 3:44:04.200]  He says, I'm not a big fan of the eight state threshold.
[3:44:04.200 --> 3:44:06.200]  I think it's an artificial number.
[3:44:06.200 --> 3:44:13.200]  And then he goes on to say it was designed to prevent Ron Paul delegates their votes from being counted.
[3:44:13.200 --> 3:44:15.200]  I don't think it's necessary to do that this year.
[3:44:15.200 --> 3:44:17.200]  Yeah, because Ron Paul's not running this year.
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:20.200]  So we don't need a rule to keep his delegates votes from being counted.
[3:44:20.200 --> 3:44:23.200]  These people are thieves.
[3:44:23.200 --> 3:44:29.200]  And we need to understand that we need to start talking about invoking the RICO Act against the GOP.
[3:44:29.200 --> 3:44:33.200]  Racketeered influence and corrupt organization.
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:35.200]  That's really what these people are about.
[3:44:35.200 --> 3:44:37.200]  Right. Hey, David.
[3:44:37.200 --> 3:44:39.200]  Look, somebody just brought this up to me.
[3:44:39.200 --> 3:44:41.200]  They're passing out pamphlets.
[3:44:41.200 --> 3:44:45.200]  The IRS, US Department of Labor, mafia labor unions are part of the Vatican.
[3:44:45.200 --> 3:44:47.200]  It's the Pope, the super boss of all government agencies.
[3:44:47.200 --> 3:44:49.200]  It's the Vatican.
[3:44:49.200 --> 3:44:51.200]  So some people were just handing these out.
[3:44:51.200 --> 3:44:54.200]  And I took one because it said the Pope's secret on top of it.
[3:44:54.200 --> 3:44:55.200]  And I'm like, oh, what's this?
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:45:01.200]  It's pretty interesting that other people are on that same vent of what the Vatican's doing and how powerful it is.
[3:45:01.200 --> 3:45:05.200]  I don't think a lot of people realize how powerful the Vatican really is.
[3:45:05.200 --> 3:45:06.200]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:45:06.200 --> 3:45:14.200]  He's thrown himself into politics and he's far more concerned, unfortunately, with politics than he is with the Catholic religion.
[3:45:14.200 --> 3:45:20.200]  And that's what we've seen repeatedly in terms of the climate change treaty, promoting that as well as open borders.
[3:45:20.200 --> 3:45:22.200]  Those are the aspects.
[3:45:22.200 --> 3:45:30.200]  Well, actually, he's even gotten into the trade issue as well, saying we need to equalize economics across governmental lines and sovereign lines.
[3:45:30.200 --> 3:45:37.200]  So he wants to destroy the sovereignty of nations, he wants to control economies and use the climate change treaty to do that.
[3:45:37.200 --> 3:45:39.200]  He is full on with the globalist agenda.
[3:45:39.200 --> 3:45:44.200]  And that's why the globalist hate Donald Trump so much is because he opposes all three of those things.
[3:45:44.200 --> 3:45:46.200]  Hey, I want to ask these kids something.
[3:45:46.200 --> 3:45:48.200]  Hey, are you guys holding on to vote?
[3:45:48.200 --> 3:45:49.200]  No.
[3:45:49.200 --> 3:45:50.200]  No, sadly not.
[3:45:50.200 --> 3:45:53.200]  Why are y'all out here today?
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:45:57.200]  Try and make a difference, not voting an idiot into presidency.
[3:45:57.200 --> 3:46:00.200]  I don't like idiots.
[3:46:00.200 --> 3:46:03.200]  So what do you not like about Donald Trump, aside from his hair?
[3:46:03.200 --> 3:46:17.200]  The fact that he's kind of incredibly ignorant and a white supremacist and he's kind of like sexist also and really racist.
[3:46:17.200 --> 3:46:19.200]  So there's all of that.
[3:46:19.200 --> 3:46:23.200]  He wants to build a wall and deport everyone.
[3:46:23.200 --> 3:46:32.200]  So I went to a Bernie rally earlier and he actually talks like intelligently and Trump does that.
[3:46:32.200 --> 3:46:33.200]  He just says random stuff.
[3:46:33.200 --> 3:46:34.200]  He says people are stupid.
[3:46:34.200 --> 3:46:36.200]  He has drool coming out of his mouth.
[3:46:36.200 --> 3:46:37.200]  He drags his goggles.
[3:46:37.200 --> 3:46:40.200]  He just picks fights with everyone.
[3:46:40.200 --> 3:46:41.200]  All right.
[3:46:41.200 --> 3:46:42.200]  Thanks.
[3:46:42.200 --> 3:46:43.200]  Thanks.
[3:46:43.200 --> 3:46:45.200]  So we got more of the brainwars to use.
[3:46:45.200 --> 3:46:52.200]  I think Donald Trump is trying to dumb down his rhetoric, but evidently it doesn't work for some people.
[3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:54.200]  Hey, we got Kid Daniels.
[3:46:54.200 --> 3:46:57.200]  Kid, I actually haven't seen Kid for the last couple of hours.
[3:46:57.200 --> 3:46:58.200]  Kid, what have you been...
[3:46:58.200 --> 3:46:59.200]  Yeah, hold on one second.
[3:46:59.200 --> 3:47:00.200]  What have you seen while you've been out here?
[3:47:00.200 --> 3:47:05.200]  Oh, I just talked to a guy who's dressed like a jihadi and he was walking across the street with a backpack.
[3:47:05.200 --> 3:47:06.200]  So I started filming him.
[3:47:06.200 --> 3:47:07.200]  I was like, what's with this guy?
[3:47:07.200 --> 3:47:09.200]  So he turned his head and started looking at me.
[3:47:09.200 --> 3:47:10.200]  He's like, why are you filming me?
[3:47:10.200 --> 3:47:12.200]  I was like, well, dude, I'm a journalist in your republic.
[3:47:12.200 --> 3:47:17.200]  And he was like, well, and some homeless guy came up to him and started joking about it.
[3:47:17.200 --> 3:47:19.200]  And they asked him, why are you dressed like a jihadi?
[3:47:19.200 --> 3:47:22.200]  He's like, I'm trying to conceal my face. I got assaulted at one of these rallies before.
[3:47:22.200 --> 3:47:27.200]  And then he was like, well, just last night, a Trump protestor got assaulted and a guy tried to broke her.
[3:47:27.200 --> 3:47:29.200]  And then he got pepper stressed.
[3:47:29.200 --> 3:47:30.200]  Like, no, dude, I was there.
[3:47:30.200 --> 3:47:34.200]  What happened was she punched the guy and then the police perpetrated her.
[3:47:34.200 --> 3:47:37.200]  And I was like, bro, you say what you will about Trump.
[3:47:37.200 --> 3:47:40.200]  The supporters I saw yesterday in Jamesville were the nicest people I've seen.
[3:47:40.200 --> 3:47:45.200]  All the protesters against Trump yesterday were extremely violent and mean.
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:50.200]  And I was like, I kind of have find it hard to believe that she was provoked like that.
[3:47:50.200 --> 3:47:53.200]  You know, she's just being herself, you know, initiating violence.
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:47:58.200]  Cause people all, I mean, we had communists last night, you know, saying that, uh,
[3:47:58.200 --> 3:48:02.200]  trying to initiate violence saying we need to kill the white people.
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:06.200]  We need to make, we need to make Texapil, Mexico again, so on and so forth.
[3:48:06.200 --> 3:48:07.200]  And that's okay.
[3:48:07.200 --> 3:48:08.200]  Hey, Rob.
[3:48:08.200 --> 3:48:09.200]  Yeah, go ahead.
[3:48:09.200 --> 3:48:11.200]  You got somebody over there with a rainbow flag.
[3:48:11.200 --> 3:48:16.200]  Go over there and ask them if they are aware that Saudi Arabians just arrested a doctor
[3:48:16.200 --> 3:48:19.200]  whose kids saw that flag online, thought it was pretty.
[3:48:19.200 --> 3:48:22.200]  He ordered it, didn't know that it had any connection with homosexuals.
[3:48:22.200 --> 3:48:24.200]  And he was arrested by the Saudi police.
[3:48:24.200 --> 3:48:28.200]  Uh, he could face execution possibly in Saudi Arabia.
[3:48:28.200 --> 3:48:33.200]  Of course, these are the people that Obama has literally bowed and scraped to.
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:37.200]  Does he have a problem with Obama doing that with our Saudi quote unquote allies?
[3:48:37.200 --> 3:48:39.200]  Hey, I got a guy who came up to me.
[3:48:39.200 --> 3:48:41.200]  What's your sign say, buddy?
[3:48:41.200 --> 3:48:46.200]  Racist Trump fans go back to the fifties and F yourselves were all human.
[3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:47.200]  All right, cool.
[3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:49.200]  So, uh, how are you?
[3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:51.200]  First of all, do you know what Project Mockingbird is?
[3:48:51.200 --> 3:48:53.200]  Yes, I know a Project Mockingbird.
[3:48:53.200 --> 3:48:58.200]  Do you, do you have to have the media run around and repeat the same talking points that people say it?
[3:48:58.200 --> 3:49:00.200]  Like what you guys are doing?
[3:49:00.200 --> 3:49:02.200]  You guys are total products of Project Mockingbird.
[3:49:02.200 --> 3:49:05.200]  You realize that Alex Jones is the project CIA.
[3:49:05.200 --> 3:49:06.200]  He's a CIA agent.
[3:49:06.200 --> 3:49:08.200]  Hey, this guy's exposing Alex Jones.
[3:49:08.200 --> 3:49:09.200]  Tell me more, buddy.
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:12.200]  Okay, have you ever seen him get called out on a before on a show?
[3:49:12.200 --> 3:49:15.200]  He just went nuts and basically said the guy was an asshole.
[3:49:15.200 --> 3:49:19.200]  He didn't actually give all the exact reasons why he's not a part of Project Mockingbird,
[3:49:19.200 --> 3:49:21.200]  how he's not involved in the CIA.
[3:49:21.200 --> 3:49:23.200]  He goes to, he goes to protests.
[3:49:23.200 --> 3:49:24.200]  Okay.
[3:49:24.200 --> 3:49:26.200]  I used to, I used to support Alex Jones.
[3:49:26.200 --> 3:49:28.200]  I used to be a member of M4s and all that stuff.
[3:49:28.200 --> 3:49:35.200]  And, uh, he, I've seen him go to protests where there's, you know, there's liberal people doing something
[3:49:35.200 --> 3:49:37.200]  and they're making a statement and they're on a podium.
[3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:41.200]  And Alex Jones comes in with his bullhorn, yawning around about, you know,
[3:49:41.200 --> 3:49:44.200]  what the message of Alex Jones is, I'm sure you know well.
[3:49:44.200 --> 3:49:49.200]  And, uh, basically they, these people, it was somewhere in Texas that I saw this,
[3:49:49.200 --> 3:49:52.200]  probably Austin, because it's where he lives, isn't it?
[3:49:52.200 --> 3:49:55.200]  Um, they said, come up here and say what you want to say, guy.
[3:49:55.200 --> 3:49:57.200]  You know, come up here and say what you want to say.
[3:49:57.200 --> 3:49:59.200]  They invited him on and he's just disrupting the whole thing.
[3:49:59.200 --> 3:50:01.200]  And it's like, he just seems to me.
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:04.200]  Isn't he talking about that set up by Michelle Malkin?
[3:50:04.200 --> 3:50:09.200]  No, no, he, he's talking about a gun rally that Alex went to a few years ago.
[3:50:09.200 --> 3:50:11.200]  I was actually there at that gun rally.
[3:50:11.200 --> 3:50:15.200]  Alex saw the mainstream media and how they were across the street going live.
[3:50:15.200 --> 3:50:18.200]  And when you go live, if you want to get your point across, across mainstream media,
[3:50:18.200 --> 3:50:21.200]  what you do is you go bullhorn them.
[3:50:21.200 --> 3:50:23.200]  Yeah, but they invited him on stage.
[3:50:23.200 --> 3:50:24.200]  And then he went up and talked.
[3:50:24.200 --> 3:50:26.200]  No, he didn't show you that in the video.
[3:50:26.200 --> 3:50:28.200]  No, he didn't go up.
[3:50:28.200 --> 3:50:29.200]  I was there for three hours.
[3:50:29.200 --> 3:50:30.200]  He went up there and talked.
[3:50:30.200 --> 3:50:31.200]  He gave other people the bullhorn.
[3:50:31.200 --> 3:50:33.200]  It was all a big talk fest.
[3:50:33.200 --> 3:50:36.200]  They took their protest and walked around the building.
[3:50:36.200 --> 3:50:39.200]  But that was like five or six years ago.
[3:50:39.200 --> 3:50:42.200]  Alex Jones supports Trump now.
[3:50:42.200 --> 3:50:43.200]  That's the thing.
[3:50:43.200 --> 3:50:47.200]  He wasn't a Trump supporter in the beginning, but he is supporting him now because...
[3:50:47.200 --> 3:50:48.200]  All right, we've got to go to a break.
[3:50:48.200 --> 3:50:50.200]  We're going to be right back with Rob Do.
[3:50:50.200 --> 3:50:52.200]  He's live at a Donald Trump rally.
[3:50:52.200 --> 3:50:56.200]  And of course, talking to the Reindead supporters there as well.
[3:50:56.200 --> 3:51:06.200]  We'll be right back.

[3:55:19.320 --> 3:55:23.640]  tasting supplement. I want to go back to Rob in just a moment. Before we do, real quickly,
[3:55:23.640 --> 3:55:28.360]  we're talking about the rules and how they bend and change the rules. Of course,
[3:55:28.360 --> 3:55:32.200]  talking about how they're going to get rid of rule number 40 that they put in to make sure
[3:55:32.200 --> 3:55:36.520]  that Ron Paul delegates votes were not counted. That's what one of the people,
[3:55:36.520 --> 3:55:39.320]  one of the four people who have already been appointed to the rules committee said,
[3:55:39.320 --> 3:55:44.040]  he said, hey, we don't need to do that this year. We don't need to exclude Ron Paul's votes. We got
[3:55:44.040 --> 3:55:49.160]  some different issues and different rules we're going to do this year. When I look at the situation
[3:55:49.160 --> 3:55:56.440]  in Pennsylvania, and of course, John Kasich said that his path to the Brokered Convention was with
[3:55:56.440 --> 3:56:02.280]  a single win in Ohio, perhaps doing well in Pennsylvania as well, but he couldn't be bothered
[3:56:02.280 --> 3:56:06.520]  to get on the ballot legitimately. And of course, it's going to be interesting to see what happens
[3:56:06.520 --> 3:56:13.960]  in Pennsylvania. This article today says at least 180,000 people have joined the GOP as Pennsylvania
[3:56:13.960 --> 3:56:20.920]  primary nears. 128,000 voters statewide have changed their registration since January the
[3:56:20.920 --> 3:56:27.560]  first to join the party. Nearly 85,000 of them had formerly been Democrats. 42,000 were independent
[3:56:27.560 --> 3:56:34.600]  or third party voters and the GOP has racked up 55,000 first time registrants. So 180,000 new
[3:56:34.600 --> 3:56:39.560]  people, that's what we're seeing everywhere being brought in as people are supporting Donald Trump
[3:56:39.560 --> 3:56:44.840]  for the first time. Moving across from the Democrat party, moving from independence,
[3:56:44.840 --> 3:56:50.440]  and this is the guy that the GOP wants to shut down. They talk about Donald Trump. Oh,
[3:56:50.440 --> 3:56:55.400]  he's behind in the polls they say to Hillary Clinton. Understand that Ronald Reagan, the last
[3:56:55.400 --> 3:57:03.720]  guy that they had who could bring in blue collar Democrats, was 15 points down to Jimmy Carter at
[3:57:03.720 --> 3:57:08.840]  this point in the general election. And that was the talking points that the GOP was establishment
[3:57:08.840 --> 3:57:13.240]  was using against Ronald Reagan. He can't win. He's down 15 points and that was an incumbent
[3:57:13.240 --> 3:57:19.560]  president. We've got Donald Trump who is pulling in Democrats and independence. Why? Because he's
[3:57:19.560 --> 3:57:26.120]  talking about the economy because he's talking about how our economy, our nation, not just our
[3:57:26.120 --> 3:57:29.960]  economy now, but our nation with the open borders, with the climate change treaties,
[3:57:29.960 --> 3:57:34.760]  with these trade treaties, our nation is being destroyed by the globalists.
[3:57:34.760 --> 3:57:38.120]  And we're talking about Pennsylvania. There's one more thing I want to point out that shows
[3:57:38.120 --> 3:57:45.320]  the way these rules are being manipulated. A day or so before Super Tuesday, there were articles
[3:57:45.320 --> 3:57:51.080]  coming out that saying that John Kasich, even though he had Pennsylvania was in his critical path,
[3:57:51.080 --> 3:57:56.440]  John Kasich had not collected the sufficient signatures in order to get on the ballot there.
[3:57:56.440 --> 3:58:00.680]  His campaign didn't even protest that. They said, yeah, of course, we didn't get the
[3:58:00.680 --> 3:58:07.000]  number of signatures that we needed. They were about at least 800, well, 192 short, perhaps
[3:58:07.000 --> 3:58:14.040]  800 short. But they said, hey, nobody complained about it. So the deadline to file didn't matter.
[3:58:14.040 --> 3:58:18.280]  The number of signatures that he needed didn't matter, but they didn't file the complaint they
[3:58:18.280 --> 3:58:22.600]  said in time. So we're going to leave him on the ballot because it's in our interest.
[3:58:22.600 --> 3:58:27.560]  That's the way they're going to rig this convention, throwing out the rules that get in
[3:58:27.560 --> 3:58:32.120]  their way and embracing whatever they want to get on the ballot. Stay with us tonight.
[3:58:32.120 --> 3:58:53.640]  We're going to have the nightly news at 7th Central, 8 p.m. Eastern. Join us then.
