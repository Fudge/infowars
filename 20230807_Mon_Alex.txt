[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this very important Monday, August 7th,
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.400]  23, Transmission.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.920]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be covering incredibly important information
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.700]  today, as we always do, but again, particularly important information concerning the future
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.760]  of not just the U.S., but the world.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.800]  Since the end of World War II, the United States has been the country that controls
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.680]  the world reserve currency.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.080]  That's given us incredible power.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.960]  It's how we've been able to dominate the planet and turn into the corrupt empire that we actually
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.960]  are.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.040]  As much as I hate the fact that America is this aggressive, tyrannical, new world order
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.200]  system that built the whole globalist program on the ashes of the old British empire, when
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.120]  the dollar goes down, it is going to be hell on earth for Americans particularly.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.280]  And I've said this for decades, the globalists are going to position the U.S. to build their
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.480]  world government, to build NATO, to build all this globalist infrastructure, set up
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.520]  China as the heir apparent, and then betray America from within to sell out not just
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.800]  the dollar, but our infrastructure.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.440]  And that's now happening with more and more global credit agencies, which are the globalists,
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.840]  devaluing the United States because, quote, the U.S. government didn't give them the extra
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.240]  trillions they wanted, even though they've given them tens of trillions of dollars in
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.740]  just the last few years.
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.460]  So this is a very, very serious time to be alive, and out of all the issues, you look
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.220]  at collapsing borders and war with Russia, all of those are important, but at the core
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.380]  of it is the globalists ending the old Bretton Woods agreement and the hegemonic power of
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.980]  the dollar, bringing in a global basket of currencies pegged to a central bank digital
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.860]  currency where the central banks can program the currency, track and control where you
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.980]  go, how you spend it, not let you spend it, devalue it, upvalue it, and just give themselves
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.980]  incredible power through the ESGs.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.220]  Now the ESGs are not dead.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.420]  They're just changing the name of the ESGs.
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.900]  The good news is there is a global awakening.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.860]  Just had dinner with Joe Rogan a couple of nights ago.
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.220]  He is beyond red-pilled.
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.300]  I knew him 20-something years ago, and he was awake as I was.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.460]  He kind of fell back asleep five, six years ago, started waking up three or four years
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.180]  ago, and now he's basically beyond me in many ways.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.460]  I mean, he is boarding in hard, and that's endemic of what's happening all over.
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.940]  Tucker Carlson just did a big interview with the younger Tate brother, Tristan, and that's
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.060]  going to be coming up here today, some clips of it, where they pointed out the deplatforming
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.700]  of InfoWars was just the beginning for everybody else, and it goes for the current attacks
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.580]  against InfoWars as well, so that's why you're tuning into the broadcast, you're sharing
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.980]  the links, you're sharing the articles is key because the globalists see InfoWars as
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.500]  the beachhead against them because I've done the deepest wide-spectrum research on their
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.460]  global program and how to stop them.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.900]  We've had all the experts on, I've been on the air 29 years, and quite frankly, it's
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.660]  not bragging when you say we're the best there is, and that's now recognized, ladies
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.540]  and gentlemen, that we are the trailblazers.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.820]  Joe recognized it to me, Tucker Carlson just talked to me yesterday, recognized it, and
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.900]  again, it's not about bragging, it's about people understanding that folks are making
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.860]  their choice, and I've got some Elon Musk news too.
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.860]  I've talked to a lot of people close to Musk, I've talked to some of his top lawyers, I've
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.740]  talked to other people close to him, and they said, no, listen, Musk is 100 percent
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.180]  for real now.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.940]  He has red-pilled himself completely, his brother almost died from the shot, his ex-wife
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.020]  took one of his kids away and is trying to chop their genitals off, he's pissed.
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.740]  And they said behind the scenes, he literally is on fire, totally pissed off and turning
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.740]  against the globalists.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.820]  And I know Joe's for real, I'm not going to get into private conversations we had,
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.780]  but I mean, look at his show and see what he's doing.
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.780]  It's amazing.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.500]  And again, it's not about focusing on Tucker Carlson or Joe Rogan or Elon Musk, but they're
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.860]  really kind of the big three up there, and then Infowars is basically kind of like the
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.620]  brain trust behind a lot of it.
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.740]  But it's not that they're getting their news from me.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.940]  Once you see the new world order, once you understand it's there, I'm not telling you
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.940]  what to see.
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.340]  I'm just showing you, hey, see the buck in the forest behind that tree?
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.340]  See his antlers?
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.340]  Oh, I see it now.
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.340]  Oh, there he is moving.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.340]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.020]  I'm just like, hey, see that from another angle.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.500]  The reason I tell you this is, as dark as everything is, I want to salute and thank the viewers
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.700]  and listeners, because really the credit for this global awakening that gives us a
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.900]  fighting chance against this dehumanization is because of you.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.860]  So please continue to spread the word, so everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.060]  Go to Infowarsstore.com, Provided Mineral Fusion is back in stock and so much more.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.060]  Now, we're going to come back.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.300]  I got a big report on their plan to poison the meat supply, starting with beef.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.300]  It's already begun.
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.300]  Stay with us.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.320]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:05.009]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:11.009]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it does for your nerves, your brain,
[00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.009]  your entire physiological system, for your nervous system particularly.
[00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.009]  Everybody knows it's incredible, it works.
[00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:23.009]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:30.009]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from.
[00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.009]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.009]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:42.009]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.009]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.009]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.009]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.009]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, not even a lower price.
[00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.009]  Rebel Zen, get yours at InfoWarsStore.com now.
[00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:15.009]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.009]  You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he.
[00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.009]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.009]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:41.009]  Well ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, August 7th, 2023.
[00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.009]  And this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.009]  We just heard from Alex in the opening segment.
[00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:51.009]  We're going to be hearing from Alex again shortly.
[00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.009]  And in fact, I just got off the phone with him.
[00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.009]  And he was telling me about some of the big news that he wanted to cover.
[00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:05.009]  He's got a big story dealing with how they're going to attack the meat supply.
[00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:12.009]  And it's kind of a flank attack where we're thinking, oh, they want to shut off the meat
[00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:15.009]  and they want to use the climate change narrative and they want to do this and they want to do that.
[00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:20.009]  But actually, they've got a new flank attack they're going to come at us with.
[00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:27.009]  And they always got to use the medical industry, don't they?
[00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:31.009]  They always got to use Big Pharma, always right there holding Big Pharma's hands
[00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:36.009]  in the latest, greatest way to attack humanity.
[00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:39.009]  So we'll be talking about that.
[00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:44.009]  And you're going to want to hear that as well.
[00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:51.009]  And then he was also mentioning Elon Musk, some of the things he's hearing about Elon behind the scenes,
[00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:54.009]  about Joe Rogan.
[00:07:54.009 --> 00:08:01.009]  And I don't really listen to the Rogan podcast simply because when I'm consuming media,
[00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:04.009]  I want it to be a little more valuable.
[00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:07.009]  And that's not to say there's not value in entertainment or what Rogan is doing.
[00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:09.009]  There's a reason why he's the number one podcast in the world.
[00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:13.009]  I'm just saying I'm not really getting any political information there, geopolitical information,
[00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:15.009]  anything like that.
[00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:22.009]  But now it's like there's always these clips everywhere I look because he has the leftist guests on
[00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:26.009]  and he butts heads with them on their logic and on their ideology and on their politics.
[00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:30.009]  So I never used to see that before.
[00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:36.009]  So Alex is kind of seeing some of the trends going in our direction.
[00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:38.009]  And I got to tell you, I'm seeing the same thing.
[00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:42.009]  And despite the most corrupt administration in the history of this country,
[00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:47.009]  the worst political persecution, weaponization of government, I mean, you name it, you're seeing it,
[00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:50.009]  the propaganda, all of it, and it's only going to get worse.
[00:08:50.009 --> 00:08:56.009]  Next year is going to be completely bonkers.
[00:08:56.009 --> 00:08:57.009]  But there's a lot.
[00:08:57.009 --> 00:08:59.009]  The normies are waking up.
[00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:01.009]  That would be the best way to put it.
[00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:07.009]  The normies are kind of, their eyes are starting to get a little wide,
[00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:10.009]  and they're starting to look to their left and their right and behind them.
[00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:20.009]  I mean, the city of San Francisco, ladies and gentlemen, in fact, I've got this video.
[00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:21.009]  This might seem trivial.
[00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:27.009]  You might say, well, yeah, of course, of course, you live in San Francisco.
[00:09:27.009 --> 00:09:32.009]  Folks, this is the average American that has been completely in a trance.
[00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:40.009]  This is the, I mean, like literally in a trance, folks, like snap out of it.
[00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:44.009]  Or like you ever had a friend that was like passed out or got knocked out in a fight or something?
[00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:45.009]  You're putting water on their face.
[00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:46.009]  You're trying to wake them up.
[00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:47.009]  Hey, snap out of it.
[00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:48.009]  You're shaking them.
[00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:49.009]  Hey, wake up.
[00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:50.009]  Wake up.
[00:09:50.009 --> 00:09:51.009]  Yeah, they seem conscious.
[00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:54.009]  They might not be passed out or something.
[00:09:54.009 --> 00:09:55.009]  They seem conscious.
[00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:56.009]  Their eyes are open.
[00:09:56.009 --> 00:09:57.009]  They're walking around.
[00:09:57.009 --> 00:09:58.009]  They're talking.
[00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:59.009]  They're breathing.
[00:09:59.009 --> 00:10:01.009]  But they're in a trance.
[00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:04.009]  And now the trance is breaking.
[00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:08.009]  They are breaking out of the trance.
[00:10:08.009 --> 00:10:10.009]  Things are finally getting so bad around them.
[00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:13.009]  The house burning down around them.
[00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:15.009]  Now it's starting to fall and plow.
[00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:17.009]  They're starting to get burned.
[00:10:17.009 --> 00:10:20.009]  They're starting to feel the heat, feel the pressure.
[00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:24.009]  They're saying, hey, something's going on here.
[00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:27.009]  And they're snapping out of it.
[00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:33.009]  So I don't know what political results will be a result of this in 2024.
[00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:38.009]  But I'm telling you, the average normie, as we might call them, it's not even liberals
[00:10:38.009 --> 00:10:39.009]  or leftists.
[00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:41.009]  They might think they're liberal or just be kind of trendy.
[00:10:41.009 --> 00:10:46.009]  So they go along with the leftist propaganda, the leftist narrative.
[00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:49.009]  But they're snapping out of the trance real quick.
[00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:52.009]  I'll show you a video out of San Francisco, exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:10:52.009 --> 00:11:00.009]  Alex also wants to get into the issue of free speech, why it's important for the West, America
[00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:08.009]  in particular, to really become free speech absolutists or at least the closest thing
[00:11:08.009 --> 00:11:11.009]  to it on the face of the earth.
[00:11:11.009 --> 00:11:17.009]  Now I'm going to do a bit of a dive at some point today as well.
[00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:24.009]  You know, it's not even as much the Biden thing that is snapping people out of their
[00:11:24.009 --> 00:11:25.009]  trance.
[00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:30.009]  That's more of a expose on how corrupt D.C. is.
[00:11:30.009 --> 00:11:35.009]  That's more of an expose on how if your last name is Biden, you can get away with anything,
[00:11:35.009 --> 00:11:36.009]  do whatever you want.
[00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:37.009]  The media will protect you.
[00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:38.009]  Your last name is Trump.
[00:11:38.009 --> 00:11:43.009]  You step on a sidewalk the wrong way, you're going to be thrown in jail.
[00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:49.009]  So we'll look more into that.
[00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:59.009]  And then that'll tie into what's going on with the judge in the latest Trump indictment.
[00:11:59.009 --> 00:12:07.009]  This judge is a I mean, it's hard to imagine because she doesn't she doesn't seem like
[00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:08.009]  much.
[00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:12.009]  She just kind of seems like she's on the bench and just kind of gets, you know, picked up
[00:12:12.009 --> 00:12:16.009]  and placed where she needs to be at the exact time.
[00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:22.009]  But it's hard to believe that it could be that coincidental with D.C. politics, isn't
[00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:24.009]  it?
[00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:31.009]  How is it this judge is in some of the most important cases in in modern history for the
[00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:32.009]  Democrat Party?
[00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:37.009]  Whenever the Democrats need a judge to do their dirty work from the bench, this woman
[00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:41.009]  magically winds up on the bench.
[00:12:41.009 --> 00:12:43.009]  Amazing.
[00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:49.009]  Isn't it amazing?
[00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:51.009]  And it's funny.
[00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:57.009]  I've been in politics for probably about, I guess, 10 years now.
[00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:59.009]  Really, I guess it is 10 years now.
[00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:04.009]  I guess it was about 2013 when I made the switch from sports to politics.
[00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:08.009]  And man, I mean, I can only imagine if I was obsessed with politics like I was with sports
[00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:11.009]  for the first 23 years of my life.
[00:13:11.009 --> 00:13:16.009]  But no, now that I'm a decade into this and I've got a pretty strong memory about the
[00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:19.009]  stuff that's happened since I've been paying attention.
[00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:26.009]  The cases that Tonya Chutkin, Judge Tonya Chutkin was on.
[00:13:26.009 --> 00:13:31.009]  It blows your mind because you just you flash back in time, you're like, oh, I remember
[00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:32.009]  that case.
[00:13:32.009 --> 00:13:33.009]  I remember that story.
[00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:34.009]  That was wild.
[00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:35.009]  How the judge got away with it.
[00:13:35.009 --> 00:13:36.009]  How did that happen?
[00:13:36.009 --> 00:13:38.009]  It happens again.
[00:13:38.009 --> 00:13:44.009]  Every single time the Democrats need somebody on the bench strategically placed to do their
[00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:47.009]  dirty work magically.
[00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:50.009]  The honorable.
[00:13:50.009 --> 00:13:55.009]  Judge Chutkin is there to save the day.
[00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:57.009]  Amazing.
[00:13:57.009 --> 00:13:58.009]  Absolutely stunning.
[00:13:58.009 --> 00:14:02.009]  Now, what are they going to do to disrupt the twenty twenty four elections?
[00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:04.009]  Is it going to be another pandemic?
[00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:07.009]  Is it going to be climate change?
[00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:09.009]  Is it going to be cyber attack?
[00:14:09.009 --> 00:14:12.009]  Is it going to be aliens?
[00:14:12.009 --> 00:14:16.009]  I'd say those are probably your leaders in the clubhouse with what they're going to do.
[00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:18.009]  But I don't I don't think it works.
[00:14:18.009 --> 00:14:19.009]  I don't think it works this time around.
[00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:22.009]  I mean, they'll have to release a virus that basically has you have you bleeding out of
[00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:26.009]  your orifices to put you in fear.
[00:14:26.009 --> 00:14:28.009]  Some sort of a hemorrhagic virus.
[00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:29.009]  And they have them.
[00:14:29.009 --> 00:14:31.009]  So, I mean, maybe that's what they plan on doing.
[00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:32.009]  But we'll get into all of that.
[00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:39.009]  And we got more coming up with Alex Jones as well here on this Monday edition of the
[00:14:39.009 --> 00:14:41.009]  Alex Jones show.

[00:14:54.009 --> 00:14:57.009]  And it's just like, oh, my gosh, it's they just water it down so much.
[00:14:57.009 --> 00:15:01.009]  Folks, we don't have to water down what we do here because you're our sponsors.

[00:17:19.009 --> 00:17:21.009]  It's about to sell out.
[00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:22.009]  We haven't had it in stock for years.

[00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:58.009]  Forty percent off.
[00:17:58.009 --> 00:17:59.009]  About to sell out.
[00:17:59.009 --> 00:18:01.009]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:18:01.009 --> 00:18:03.009]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[00:18:03.009 --> 00:18:05.009]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[00:18:05.009 --> 00:18:08.009]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:18:09.009 --> 00:18:13.009]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:17.009]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[00:18:17.009 --> 00:18:20.009]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:18:20.009 --> 00:18:22.009]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:18:22.009 --> 00:18:25.009]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:30.009]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:32.009]  This is what I use, what my family uses.
[00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:35.009]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time.
[00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:37.009]  Ten percent off on top of that exclusively.
[00:18:37.009 --> 00:18:42.009]  Exclusively at Infowarsstore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system in stock
[00:18:42.009 --> 00:18:45.009]  and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.

[00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:48.009]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:18:48.009 --> 00:18:51.009]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives
[00:18:51.009 --> 00:18:55.009]  and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:58.009]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:06.009]  I want to say BrainForce is great.
[00:19:06.009 --> 00:19:08.009]  I want to say TurboForce is amazing.
[00:19:08.009 --> 00:19:09.009]  It is.
[00:19:09.009 --> 00:19:13.009]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:19:13.009 --> 00:19:15.009]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:17.009]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:19.009]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:19:19.009 --> 00:19:22.009]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[00:19:22.009 --> 00:19:25.009]  Krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[00:19:25.009 --> 00:19:26.009]  And I'm just sorry.
[00:19:26.009 --> 00:19:27.009]  You want something like this?
[00:19:27.009 --> 00:19:28.009]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:19:28.009 --> 00:19:30.009]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:19:30.009 --> 00:19:31.009]  It's so good in my view.
[00:19:31.009 --> 00:19:33.009]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:19:33.009 --> 00:19:36.009]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:38.009]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:19:39.009 --> 00:19:44.009]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:19:47.009 --> 00:19:50.009]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess
[00:19:50.009 --> 00:19:53.009]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:19:53.009 --> 00:19:54.009]  I just can't do it.
[00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:55.009]  InfoWareStore.com
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:36.000]  How many times must I tell you baby, how many bridges I've got to crawl?
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]  You know it's not going to be easy.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]  Creating a free and prosperous nation.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]  But it was much harder, it was much harder on our ancestors.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]  It was much harder on those that came before us.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]  We'll probably have it easy compared to them.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.000]  That is if we can get this done before the total technotronic tyranny sits in.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000]  I'd say we probably got, I mean realistically probably four to six years left here in America
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]  to stave that off before it's, I mean how do you get out of that?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]  You're basically in the matrix at that point.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]  But I'm seeing the awakening.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:23.000]  And whether it's going out in public say to dinner or a ball game or a show
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]  and just kind of hearing some of the chatter or you know every once in a while
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000]  I'll make an overt political joke that people seem to resonate with.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000]  I mean heck, even just going out and getting recognized all the time is odd.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]  Because pretty much the only place you're going to find me is right here at Infowars.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]  So that means wow, I mean people are really tuning in.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]  They're really understanding.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]  This is really resonating with them.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:55.000]  But here's the thing, you might be in the political atmosphere
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]  and you might see what's going on with the Bidens.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]  You might see what's going on with Trump or maybe you see some political persecution
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]  or you've been directly involved.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]  Maybe it was the vaccine.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]  In fact, the vaccine might even be a bigger one.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]  But at the end of the day, what is going to shake the average American out of their trance?
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]  The average American that's just watching Netflix, just watching the mainstream news,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]  I mean really hardly has an original thought ever in their head.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]  Pretty much everything they think, everything they see, everything they do
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]  is totally contrived, delivered, put there by somebody else.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]  What is it that's going to wake that American up?
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]  What is it that's going to take that American out of its trance?
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]  Which is still a large portion.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000]  I would say in the past, it's kind of been split into threes.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]  Generally speaking, you've got one-third of the country that's right wing,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]  one-third of the country that's left wing, and then one-third of the country that
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]  they're grounded basically.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]  They don't know what's going on.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]  And I would say that the left wing is taking major losses.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000]  They do not have, the one-thirds paradigm does not accurately represent
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]  where we're at anymore.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]  The left wing is hemorrhaging support.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]  I mean, Megan Rapinoe got booed on the soccer field during the World Cup.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]  Okay?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]  People in American flag hats and shirts booing Megan Rapinoe
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]  because she blew the World Cup final.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]  Or I guess it was the first round of the elimination.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]  They barely even made it.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]  So the U.S. women's national team that should be the best team on the planet
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]  every single year, that's the legacy.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]  That's the pedigree.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]  Megan Rapinoe blows it up in her final game.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]  I mean, poetic justice.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]  You want to talk about poetic justice?
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]  Megan Rapinoe biffing, blowing the World Cup, and getting booed
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]  while she does it.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]  So that just shows you the left is hemorrhaging support that American soccer
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000]  fans boo this deranged, insufferable woman who hates the country,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]  probably why she missed the kick.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]  No, I know she's selfish.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]  She didn't want to miss the kick, but her hatred for country overwhelmed
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]  her own selfishness, and she blew it.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]  She didn't belong on the field anyway.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]  See, I'm just ranting here.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]  The point is the left wing does not have the numbers that they once did
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]  or that they think they do.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]  And so now you're dealing with this middle.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]  And here's an example.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]  This is a woman who I'm guessing just watches her favorite streaming shows,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]  has her favorite streaming platforms, works her job, does her normal routine,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]  whatever, but she's starting to get out of her trance.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]  She's looking around.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]  Violent crime everywhere.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]  She's looking around.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]  Drug addiction everywhere.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]  She's looking around.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]  Homelessness, poverty everywhere.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]  Her grocery bills are doubling.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]  Her energy bills are doubling.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]  It's kind of like slowly but surely something is starting to happen.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000]  And so you might see this and say, geez, this person has been living in denial.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]  This lady is totally clueless.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]  How far behind is she?
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]  Well, you are a trailblazer.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]  You've been tuned into this.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]  You're a trailblazer.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]  If you just tuned in, you're ahead of the curve.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]  If you've been tuned in for decades, you're even farther ahead of the curve.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]  And that's just the reality.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]  That's why they want this broadcast shut down so much.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]  We are the leading edge.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]  But this is your average American here that is about to go through an awakening
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]  process in the next year, folks.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]  I'm telling you, and it's long overdue, and that's why it's going to happen in
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000]  such a quick manner because it's been there the whole time,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]  and they've just been told to ignore it.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]  They've had blinders put on them.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]  They've been dumbed down with the chemicals and the food and the water,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]  but they're about to break out of their trance.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]  Listen to this woman in San Francisco.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]  It's like she's slowly opening her eyes and realizing the world she lives in,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]  in clip eight.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]  I'm literally shaking right now.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]  I was just getting groceries, and I live in San Francisco,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]  and I never really feel fully safe.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]  If you live in San Francisco, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]  And I just got groceries.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]  I'm walking out of the store, and this guy is walking past me and says,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]  move, you stupid bitch, and he spits in my face.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]  It's all over my face.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]  And then I say, excuse me, did you just spit in my face?
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]  And he says, move or I'll rape you.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]  There's also people everywhere, and everyone's just walking by because
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]  they're like, I can't handle something else in San Francisco.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]  It's always something else.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]  I don't even know why I'm posting this.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]  If you live in San Francisco, do you feel this way all the time?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]  I don't feel safe, ever.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]  I literally never feel safe.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000]  It's better when it's daylight, but nighttime, no, not leaving my house.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]  I mean, I could do a 10-minute breakdown of the psychology that you just
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]  witnessed here.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]  Okay, so what does she say?
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]  She's like, oh, well, yeah, I've never really felt safe here.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]  So the recognition, something is wrong.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]  My environment shouldn't be like this.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]  But, oh, just go along and get along.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]  It's liberal.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]  It's gay.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]  There's an LGBTQ flag.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]  It's Joe Biden.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]  It's, oh, we're all, it's great.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]  Yay, liberal.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]  It's like, yeah.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]  I mean, someone just walked by and spat in my face and said he wanted to rape me,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]  but it's liberal.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]  He had a gay pride flag.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000]  He votes Democrat.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]  She's like, nobody around wanted to help me because they couldn't just deal with
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]  another thing.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]  Ah, exactly.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]  Welcome to your communist utopia.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]  Welcome to your leftist utopia.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]  You can't deal with another thing.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]  It's always something.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]  There's always an intervention.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]  There's always something going wrong.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]  There's always something breaking down, and there's nobody there to help.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]  Welcome to communism.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]  Welcome to Democrat Party politics.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]  She's starting to question.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]  She's like, why is it like this?
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]  It shouldn't be like this.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]  And then what does she say?
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]  She says, I don't even know why I'm posting this video.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]  She's doing things she doesn't even understand.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]  She's beginning to get it.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]  The first step is questioning, and she's finally starting to question.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]  Okay, why is San Francisco a hellhole?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]  Why did I get spat on and threatened to be raped?
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]  Why did nobody help me?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]  Why am I uploading this video?
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]  You're starting to snap out of your trance.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]  You're starting to think and behave like a normal human.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]  You're starting to expect things from the world around you and your civilization,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]  and rightfully so, and it shouldn't be what you're getting.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]  How many Americans are going through this?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]  But, oh, it's about to, I mean, talk about hitting light speed.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]  Gas prices aren't coming down anytime soon, folks.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]  So your energy bills are going to keep going up.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]  Crime rates are going to keep going up.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]  Taxes are going to keep going up.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]  And you're going to have more people saying, what is going on?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]  I don't even know why I'm uploading this video.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]  I don't even know what's going on.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]  Something is happening here.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]  Yeah, you live in a globalist hellscape.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]  Tell us about the products, how we support you,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]  how we support all of ourselves and the big event coming up.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]  Well, yeah, let's, the first one, you obviously can go to mypillow.com,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]  use that promo code Alex,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]  and you can get all these great discounts on all of our products.

[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000]  the 20-year anniversary MyPillow for 1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love to invest,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]  producing and making the MyPillow.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]  using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]  That's what the debanking is about.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]  That's why we've got to rush to support mypillow.com
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]  and Infowars.com, plus their great products at both places,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]  because we are the tip of the spear.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000]  That's why Infowars Life created the powerful vitamin-mineral fusion formula,

[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems in the economy,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000]  we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]  But now we've got it.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]  30 parts per million from the top lab.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]  We've got a limited shipment.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]  Hopefully, we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]  have in your preparedness arsenal,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]  high-quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000]  we have it right now, private-labeled, under the name Silver Bullet at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]  Limited supply, 30% off.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]  InfowarsStore.com, Silver Bullet.

[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]  They are both clones of national best-selling products
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]  from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker that are listeners and patriots
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000]  that are allowing us to private-label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]  and to also make your nerves healthier,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]  There's major research behind this all.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfowarsMD
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.000]  and Nerve Renew from InfowarsMD exclusively at InfowarsStore.com right now.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000]  You'll find them exclusively at InfowarsStore.com, and they fund their operation.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:07.940]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:18.940]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.940]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:33.940]  We're going to be hearing from Alex Jones on the new way to attack humans consuming meat.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.940]  It's not going to be a direct attack.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.940]  They're going to flank us.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:42.940]  Not like a flank steak, but they will be flanking us.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.940]  Alex is going to be breaking that down later.
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:50.940]  And...
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.940]  You know, I just...
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:34:00.940]  I really see the awakening happening, and I don't want to belabor it too much, because I want to get into this news.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.940]  But we really, at this point, just need to stay focused on the mission.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:09.940]  Don't get caught up in the infighting.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.940]  Don't get caught up in the watered down...
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.940]  Ringing off the teleprompter news cover...
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.940]  Focus on the mission.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:25.940]  And when we have to focus on the bad, use it to further the mission.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:33.940]  But it's kind of funny watching all the paid-for DeSantis Twitter accounts.
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.940]  I mean, DeSantis' campaign is shot.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:43.940]  I mean, the only chance I guess he has is if somehow Trump can't run or they take his name off the ballot.
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:50.940]  But even then, I think that probably ends up hurting him worse, because then he will actually have to be put to the test.
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:58.940]  And whether you like Vivek Ramaswamy, trust him or not, honestly, Ramaswamy would crush DeSantis on a debate stage.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:06.940]  I mean, maybe that's the globalist's big plan is to send in some plant and then have him just mop up the lightweight DeSantis.
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:15.940]  Which is unfortunate. He was America's governor. He put Florida on a map in new ways, politically, culturally.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:20.940]  And then the conservative establishment, the McCain, the Bush wing of the Republican Party,
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:27.940]  took him in, put him on the platform, gave him the talking points, and now he's politically done.
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:35.940]  And so if you don't have the political wherewithal to see that Donald Trump has destroyed the Bush dynasty,
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:41.940]  the McCain wing of the Republican Party, then you're just not that smart, unfortunately, for Ron DeSantis.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:51.940]  But see, that's what I'm saying. It's okay. Support DeSantis, cope with how he's going to lose and doesn't have a shot against Trump.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.940]  You can be in denial that Trump's clearly leading in the polls. It's insurmountable. That's fine.
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:03.940]  We're all going to be on the same team in the end. I'm glad there's this much energy and focus being put into politics at this time,
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:08.940]  in an off year, because it just shows, again, that the awakening is upon us.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.940]  But let's take a look at some of the other news here, politically.
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.940]  Trump calls Nancy Pelosi a wicked witch who will someday live in hell.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:29.940]  And he might be right, but, you know, guys, I want to pull that clip that we played last night from the Trump campaign in Alabama.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:44.940]  It was clip number one from last night. Yeah, this was Trump in Alabama at one of his major campaign events.
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:59.940]  I mean, when I say nobody has campaign events like Donald Trump, I mean, if you campaigned every, if you took every other political campaign right now for president,
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:08.940]  if you took every single one and combined the size of their campaigns and the attendance numbers at it, Donald Trump would still be bigger.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.940]  OK. And here's what he said in Alabama this weekend.
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:20.940]  Election Day 2024. We're going to evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:33.940]  We're going to expel the criminals and thugs from the halls of power in Washington, D.C., and we are going to make America great again.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:41.940]  Now, I do wonder when they're going to put this campaign to full blast.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.940]  I do wonder because he's really not even at full blast right now. I mean, he's kind of just.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:54.940]  They don't do big pressers for these rallies. They don't do big media coverage.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:59.940]  They don't even really market them much, quite frankly, compared to what we've seen before.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:05.940]  So I wonder when this campaign is going to go into full swing and what are the numbers going to look like then?
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:09.940]  He's already filling basketball arenas, hockey arenas.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:17.940]  Calls Nancy Pelosi a wicked witch who will live in hell and then says he's going to drain the swamp.
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.940]  Well, I still think he's got better odds than anybody else.
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:21.940]  Meanwhile, though.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.940]  I mean, just where is the media?
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:33.940]  Biden energy secretary secretly consulted top Chinese energy official before the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's release.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:39.940]  Sales to Hunter Biden link Chinese energy giant. Oh, so I mean, this is how corrupt they are.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.940]  Granholm's in on it.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:45.940]  Joe Biden's OK, we're going to release the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.940]  Let's get Hunter's business partners, the Chinese on the phone.
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.940]  Let's let them know. And then, you know, they can make the sale.
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:52.940]  And they did.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.940]  And they did. And Biden says, well.
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.940]  I lowered gas prices.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:06.940]  No, you sold our Strategic Petroleum Reserves to the Chinese.
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:08.940]  That's what you did.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:09.940]  The Chinese.
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:11.940]  That's what you did.
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.940]  Joe Biden.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.940]  I mean, imagine Joe Biden goes into your bank account, takes your money and gives it to the Chinese.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:25.940]  He's probably done that, too.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.940]  He did it with Ukraine.
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.940]  Joe Biden.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:33.940]  Joe Biden.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:35.940]  And now.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.940]  His corrupted energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:45.940]  They call Hunter's business partner and they say we're going to release.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.940]  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.940]  Get ready to make your bid.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.940]  And now our Strategic Petroleum Reserves are lower than they've been in 40 years.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:08.940]  And Joe Biden apparently is thinking about purchasing more oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.940]  The thing about that is Donald Trump was buying the.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.940]  He was filling the reserve up at about like $30 a barrel.
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.940]  Biden is now going to be buying it at $80 a barrel.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:21.940]  Bidenomics.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.940]  Where is the media?
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.940]  Where's the special counsel?
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.940]  Wouldn't you like to know how that all went down?
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.940]  Sure, there's records of these phone calls.
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.940]  Department of Justice prosecutor working on Jack Smith's team is a Biden donor.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:44.940]  There's your swamp.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.940]  There's your corruption.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.940]  Oh, but they're everywhere.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.940]  Former top New York City prosecutor David Rohde is a prolific donor to the Biden.
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:59.940]  Crime family and a number of other Democrats like Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Dan Goldman.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:00.940]  So the worst of them.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.940]  Oh, but see, same with all the judges, same with all the prosecutors.
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:12.940]  All of them, Democrat donors, proud and good standing members of the Democrat Party.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.940]  So corrupt, even Alan Dershowitz is calling it a banana republic.
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.940]  Even Alan Dershowitz calling it a banana republic.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.940]  The liberal, the Democrat admitting that the Democrats have turned this country into a banana republic.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:34.940]  Donald Trump vows to prosecute Joe Biden if elected.
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.940]  You know, this is the nearly impossible challenge.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.940]  Whether it's Donald Trump or anybody who wants to embark on this mission.
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:52.940]  How do you do this without it becoming cold civil war every four years?
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:57.940]  How do you do this without it becoming cold civil war every time the presidency switches hands?
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.940]  I mean, really.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:06.940]  Whether you think it's justified to prosecute Biden or not, you have to understand the ramifications.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:08.940]  You have to understand the repercussions of the future.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:18.940]  And really the only thing you can do, the only thing you can do to have a chance at success in this impossible mission
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:24.940]  is to have it so universal, to have so much unification, to have it so out in the open,
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:31.940]  to have so many people that understand it at just a gut level, at an instinctual level, at a reactionary level
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.940]  that you don't just prosecute Biden.
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:40.940]  You prosecute Biden and anyone and everyone who knew about what Biden was doing,
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:44.940]  was involved with what Biden was doing, or was also doing exactly what Biden is doing
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:46.940]  because you know he's not the only one.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.940]  Joe Biden didn't come up with this himself.
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:53.940]  He saw others do it and so he did the old copycat criminal routine.
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.940]  That's the only way you can do this.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:28.940]  Stop shop for everything you need for vitamins, minerals, and key amino acids for your immune system and more.

[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:05.940]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.940]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:16.940]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.940]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:25.940]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:33.940]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:42.940]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:47.940]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.

[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:42.940]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:47.940]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:53.940]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.

[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.940]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:23.140]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones in the next hour here today on The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:32.100]  Now, I was cut off by the break trying to explain the Mission Impossible, but it ties
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:38.020]  perfectly into something that Trump shared over the weekend.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:45.660]  A video clip from a Dr. Jan Halper Hayes, and she was on Good Morning Britain, or what
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:58.060]  was the name of the show she was on here, GBN, GBN Network, and so it kind of ties into
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:59.660]  what I was talking about last segment.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:07.060]  How can you possibly deal with the corruption in Washington, D.C., where much of the country
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:12.759]  is still in denial of it, and there's still so much hatred and vitriol for Trump blinding
[00:48:12.759 --> 00:48:19.140]  people that they'll never be able to accept it, and so that's a dangerous group of people.
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:23.740]  We've already seen how dangerous they are.
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.740]  What do you do?
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:28.600]  How do you possibly deal with the corruption in D.C. without turning it into cold civil
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.980]  war every four years, every eight years, every time the presidency switches, without people
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:39.220]  losing complete, I mean, just a complete loss of faith in everything, just everything,
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.740]  anything and everything?
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:53.740]  Well, you would have to make it so clear, so obvious, so universal, so unifying, that
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:59.500]  you really, in the end of the day, it's not even you doing it if you're Donald Trump.
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.060]  It's the people realizing it.
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:03.180]  And look, the signs are all around us, folks.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:06.980]  Mike Pence goes in campaigns, he gets booed.
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:10.420]  Mitch McConnell gave a five-minute speech over the weekend, he got booed for five minutes
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.660]  straight.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:16.620]  Megan Rapinoe goes to kick a penalty kick at the World Cup, she gets booed.
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:22.180]  So Joe Biden can't even have a campaign event.
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.020]  Is Joe Biden done with vacation yet?
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.259]  Is Joe Biden still on vacation?
[00:49:25.259 --> 00:49:26.259]  I haven't even seen him.
[00:49:26.259 --> 00:49:28.779]  I don't believe he's gone back to D.C. yet.
[00:49:28.779 --> 00:49:32.060]  I think Biden's still at the beach.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:38.860]  How many press conferences has Joe Biden done in the calendar year 2023?
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:42.180]  None?
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:50.180]  So I mean, you're really already almost there.
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:55.340]  As far as the public awakening, I mean, we're not fully there, but you're seeing it.
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.100]  So but Trump shares this video.
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.300]  Is this Biden getting back, guys?
[00:49:58.819 --> 00:50:01.380]  Did Biden finally finish his double vacation?
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.540]  It was a double vacation.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:06.700]  He finished his retreat and then he went on summer vacation.
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.380]  So he had a retreat at the beach.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:12.740]  And then after that, he had his summer vacation at the beach.
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:19.819]  And Joe Biden has now spent 368 or 369 days of vacation since becoming president over
[00:50:19.819 --> 00:50:21.980]  a calendar year.
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:25.300]  In your life, you might not spend 365 days on vacation.
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.180]  Joe Biden has done it since becoming president.
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.300]  Must be nice.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.940]  Who's really running the country?
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:38.620]  So anyway, this Dr. Jan Halper Hayes, oh, and no questions from the press, old stiff
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:42.380]  legged Joe, old pedo Peter there.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:45.660]  That's what his son had him in his phone contacts as, pedo Peter.
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:46.660]  What does that mean?
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:57.140]  It's kind of like how you had Mitt Romney had his little pseudonym, Magnificent Peter.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.819]  So Joe Biden's pseudonym is pedo Peter.
[00:51:00.819 --> 00:51:04.580]  Mitt Romney's pseudonym is Magnificent Peter.
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:09.259]  They seem to know what they like to do with their Peters.
[00:51:09.259 --> 00:51:17.500]  So Dr. Jan Halper Hayes on GBN, the whole video might be on Bandout Video.
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.540]  I'm sure there's a link.
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:22.340]  In fact, I know the link is probably at Infowars.com too.
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.380]  It's a 10 minute video.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.700]  I'm not going to play the whole thing for you.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.740]  I'll boil it down.
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:28.220]  How basically.
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.100]  Now, there's there's there's two interesting things to me.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:37.259]  One, when I saw this, I said this woman is either completely deranged.
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:45.259]  In what she believes is going on or she knows something that that you don't know and that
[00:51:45.259 --> 00:51:50.060]  I don't know, and look, I can see either one being the case because she did have a job
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:51.740]  with President Trump.
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:56.060]  I mean, she she was pretty high up in the Department of Defense, so it's not like.
[00:51:57.819 --> 00:52:00.580]  It's not like she didn't know what she's talking about, she was she was high up in the
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:05.980]  Department of Defense, but it sounds a little Q, it sounds a little Q ask and.
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:13.300]  So it's just kind of like, oh, well, you know, none of the stuff that Q has really ever
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:17.340]  said came true and the January 6th committee and the Democrats don't really seem
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:18.900]  interested on identifying Q.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:22.060]  So it would seem to me that I wouldn't trust anything that comes from Q, but that
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.460]  doesn't mean there couldn't be truth there.
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:26.779]  And it doesn't mean that this lady might not be telling the truth either.
[00:52:26.779 --> 00:52:27.779]  Now, here's the issue, though.
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:33.580]  That I see everywhere, they're all under this belief that Trump is going to be able to
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:39.500]  relitigate this out in the courtroom and they just don't understand that the judge
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:44.180]  is not going to allow Donald Trump to present any evidence.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.300]  And people will say, well, you can't do that.
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.340]  That's illegal. That's not how the court system works.
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.940]  Well, I've seen it firsthand.
[00:52:52.259 --> 00:52:58.180]  The man's name is Alex Jones and they seem to do what they want to do to you or to
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:01.259]  Donald Trump, to Alex Jones first.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:08.500]  So, yes, when Alex is in court and he can't do discovery and he can't do presentation
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:13.180]  of evidence and he can't ask questions, then, yeah, you realize, oh, this is the new
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.220]  system.
[00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:27.470]  Speaking of, and I didn't have this planned, but a perfect segue, joining me on the phone
[00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.710]  now is Alex Jones.
[00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:36.069]  Oh, and I was just driving down the road listening to you, and we tried to get the report to
[00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:40.870]  you so we could air it this segment, but it's going to air at six after next hour.
[00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:44.470]  We've been researching this for a while, but we found all the documents now.
[00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:49.509]  They're knowingly growing, including the COVID vaccine components.
[00:53:49.509 --> 00:53:51.350]  So much secret stuff in there.
[00:53:51.350 --> 00:54:00.029]  A bovine protein crystal very close to what causes mad cow, and it's in the Moderna and
[00:54:00.029 --> 00:54:01.029]  Pfizer shots.
[00:54:01.029 --> 00:54:04.750]  We have all the documents, and it causes an autoimmune response where you become allergic
[00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:09.470]  to beef, and now they're blaming it on a tick, saying everybody's getting allergic to beef
[00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:13.190]  because of a tick, which also puts a similar protein in you.
[00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:15.509]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're attacking us with proteins.
[00:54:15.509 --> 00:54:18.390]  That's what the spike protein is as well.
[00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:24.390]  So it appears like they're growing the spike protein in beef, and so it carries a bunch
[00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:25.390]  of other stuff.
[00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:30.190]  It's like they grew vaccines in the 90s on peanuts, and that created the never-before-seen
[00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:31.990]  peanut allergy.
[00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:37.990]  So it's going on and on and on and on and on and on and on, and I mean, so now we know
[00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:39.710]  how they're weaponizing the food.
[00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:42.029]  We know how when they say you're not going to have beef soon.
[00:54:42.029 --> 00:54:45.150]  It's because they're not just banning the cows all over the world.
[00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:48.029]  They are now coming directly after the food supply.
[00:54:48.029 --> 00:54:49.670]  Total weaponization is a maximum alert.
[00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:52.069]  We're going to be posting a Band-Aid video later.
[00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:53.870]  I'm going to write the headline soon.
[00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:54.870]  I'm up here in Dallas.
[00:54:54.870 --> 00:55:02.029]  I'm going to make a major announcement tomorrow, in the morning, at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:02.029 --> 00:55:04.190]  I want to thank everybody for their support.
[00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:08.270]  We're fighting harder than ever, but the globalists are mad scientists moving against us at every
[00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:11.629]  level, and you're truly getting tomorrow's news today.
[00:55:11.629 --> 00:55:14.910]  Everybody's worried about them injecting cows with the mRNA spike protein and them giving
[00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:15.910]  it to us.
[00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:16.910]  No.
[00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:22.190]  They just inject us with a cow protein associated with all these neurological problems and heart
[00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:25.029]  problems, and it makes us allergic to the cows.
[00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:26.350]  So I break it all down next hour.
[00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:30.790]  Owen, I'm going to get back to listening to you as I drive down the road here.
[00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:31.790]  God bless you all.
[00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:32.790]  InfoWars.com.
[00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:34.069]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:35.069]  We could have this off.
[00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:38.430]  Yes, I predicted everything that's happened before, but we didn't stop a lot of it.
[00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:40.109]  Now, people know we're serious.
[00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:43.470]  By predicting what they're about to do, what they're already doing, we can stop them in
[00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:44.470]  their full rollout.
[00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:46.670]  But we are under total attack.
[00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:48.830]  Back to Owen Strunk.
[00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:54.470]  And it's well known that other vaccines have led to peanut allergies, gluten intolerance,
[00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:55.470]  and so much more.
[00:55:55.470 --> 00:56:00.549]  You didn't have a lot of these things, say, 50 years ago, or you could say before you injected
[00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:07.910]  your children with 60, 70 vaccines before they even take their first trip around the
[00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:14.350]  world, the first turning, first year of their lives.
[00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:17.910]  And so this is just the attack humanity is under, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:20.509]  This is just the attack that humanity is under.
[00:56:20.509 --> 00:56:26.170]  Oh, well, you know, it's going to be really hard to convince you, it's going to be really
[00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:28.549]  hard to convince you not to eat meat, right?
[00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:29.549]  Everybody likes barbecue.
[00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:34.750]  I mean, I guess there are people that are vegan or vegetarian, maybe they just don't
[00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:37.350]  like meat.
[00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:39.529]  But most people like going to a barbecue.
[00:56:39.529 --> 00:56:42.350]  Most people like having a cheeseburger.
[00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:45.509]  Most people like having a nice steak.
[00:56:45.509 --> 00:56:49.830]  How are you going to convince somebody to stop eating meat to save the planet?
[00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:50.830]  Well, you're probably not.
[00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:57.069]  But boy, oh boy, if you made them allergic to it, well, then they might not have a chance.
[00:56:57.589 --> 00:57:01.390]  Oh, but we would have no idea what's going on with these vaccines.
[00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:05.790]  Oh, please, folks, they roll out these vaccines.
[00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:09.109]  They do private testing.
[00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:13.870]  Even though you are basically part of a giant human experiment with the COVID-19 vaccines,
[00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:17.029]  they already had their own experience, experiments going.
[00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:18.270]  We have the documents.
[00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:22.750]  They knew it was going to cause all the myocarditis and everything else.
[00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:28.750]  And so, no, they'll make sure, that'll probably be the next big thing.
[00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:33.029]  They'll probably have a big hemorrhagic fever release made in a lab.
[00:57:33.029 --> 00:57:37.350]  And then that vaccine, if you take that vaccine, it'll cause you to be allergic to meat.
[00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:38.950]  That's probably their next big move.
[00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:41.509]  Maybe that's what they plan on for 2024.
[00:57:41.509 --> 00:57:49.830]  Well, always ahead of the curve, the Alex Jones Show right here at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:55.350]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God, through Mother Nature, has given us the answer.
[00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:59.430]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it
[00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:05.069]  does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system, for your nervous system
[00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:06.069]  particularly.
[00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:08.109]  Everybody knows it's incredible, it works.
[00:58:08.109 --> 00:58:12.910]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:18.990]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more, because that's who we're getting it
[00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.990]  from.
[00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:22.390]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:26.029]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[00:58:26.029 --> 00:58:31.630]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:34.670]  It's based right here in Texas, and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:38.310]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:41.470]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:45.790]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:46.790]  Rebel Zen.
[00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.509]  Get yours at infoorestore.com now.
[00:58:49.509 --> 00:58:50.509]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[00:58:50.509 --> 00:58:51.509]  Do you like RainForce?
[00:58:51.509 --> 00:58:52.509]  Yeah.
[00:58:52.509 --> 00:58:53.509]  Yeah.
[00:58:53.509 --> 00:58:54.509]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:58:54.509 --> 00:58:56.549]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:58:56.549 --> 00:59:00.490]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkiewicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:02.870]  and now two books with Alex Jones?
[00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:06.190]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:10.109]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:15.109]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins, but the one thing that
[00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:19.509]  I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[00:59:19.509 --> 00:59:24.589]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the
[00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:27.350]  next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:33.109]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:34.109]  All right.
[00:59:34.109 --> 00:59:35.109]  We love you.
[00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:36.109]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:39.350]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at infoorestore.com.
[00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:51.990]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:59:51.990 --> 01:00:07.270]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:14.509]  Just in the break, I'm hearing from individuals who are saying they know they have family
[01:00:14.509 --> 01:00:20.270]  members who got the COVID vaccines and developed Alpha-Gal.
[01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:21.270]  Is it Alpha-Gal, guys?
[01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:23.109]  Is that the pronunciation?
[01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:24.109]  It is Alpha-Gal.
[01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:25.109]  And that's the...
[01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:26.109]  Now you're allergic to beef.
[01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:31.190]  You can't eat beef.
[01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:32.190]  And so I'm...
[01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:33.190]  I'll actually...
[01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:34.390]  I'll talk to my friend on air right now.
[01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:35.589]  So what does that look like?
[01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:36.750]  They can't consume it.
[01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:39.470]  They get nauseous or they...
[01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:41.149]  What happens when you have Alpha-Gal?
[01:00:41.149 --> 01:00:43.109]  I'm not too well-researched on this.
[01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:44.109]  But oh, okay.
[01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:47.589]  So it was already happening with the COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:50.470]  Hey, maybe that was...
[01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:52.529]  They had special batches for you.
[01:00:52.529 --> 01:00:54.589]  So maybe that was one of the special batches.
[01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:57.470]  See which batch causes the Alpha-Gal.
[01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:59.310]  That way we can get you to stop eating meat.
[01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:04.390]  Is that too far-fetched on this planet where they make biological weapons in a lab and
[01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:05.390]  leak it out to you?
[01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:08.910]  And then they bomb foreign countries and then false flag us into wars?
[01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:12.750]  Yeah, that's too far-fetched, isn't it?
[01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:15.069]  I'm sure loving Big Pharma would never...
[01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:18.230]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:19.230]  They love you.
[01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:20.230]  Yeah, they love that.
[01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:25.029]  They're going to put that in Neil.
[01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:27.670]  You're going to be allergic to beef.
[01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:34.190]  Symptoms of Alpha-Gal syndrome may include hives, itching, itchy, scaly skin, swelling
[01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:38.149]  of the lips, face, tongue, and throat, wheezing, shortness of breath, stomach pain, diarrhea,
[01:01:38.149 --> 01:01:39.750]  upset stomach, or vomiting.
[01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:41.630]  Is that when you consume the beef?
[01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:47.549]  I'm going to ask my friend tuned in, say three of his three family members got Alpha-Gal
[01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:50.029]  after taking the COVID vaccine.
[01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:52.590]  So that means they're already testing it, folks.
[01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:55.590]  Guaranteed, it's coming.
[01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:56.710]  Guaranteed.
[01:01:56.710 --> 01:02:03.830]  That is in their portfolio of plans to destroy humanity and civilization as we know it.
[01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:05.430]  I mean, it's not that...
[01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:09.310]  Folks, I mean, look, all you got to do is be reasonable and discerning here.
[01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:11.750]  They want you to stop eating beef.
[01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:13.870]  You don't want to stop eating beef.
[01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:15.870]  They're going to make you stop eating beef.
[01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:18.470]  But they'd rather not do it with a gun to your head.
[01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:23.790]  So put you in fear of a virus, trick you and deceive you into going and taking an injection,
[01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:25.710]  and then you're allergic to beef.
[01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:30.109]  Congratulations, bud.
[01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:33.750]  This is the psychotic, satanic world order we are living under.
[01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.149]  But see, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:02:35.149 --> 01:02:41.950]  When I play that video in the first hour of that woman, and she's like, oh my gosh, she's
[01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:42.950]  lived in San Francisco.
[01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:44.790]  This is not new.
[01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:49.470]  The poverty, the drug abuse, the homelessness, the crime, this is not new, but it's like
[01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:52.109]  all of a sudden she's like, what is going on?
[01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:57.109]  Because some guy walked up to her, Democrat voter walked up to her and spat in her face
[01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:58.790]  and said he was going to rape her.
[01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:01.149]  It was like, oh my gosh, I'm living in San Francisco.
[01:03:01.149 --> 01:03:07.230]  It's like, it's only a matter of time before somebody spits in your face.
[01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:10.549]  It might not be some individual actually walking up and spitting in your face, but you get
[01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:16.509]  mugged, you get robbed, you get raped, you get taxed into oblivion, you lose your property,
[01:03:16.509 --> 01:03:17.509]  your property taxed.
[01:03:17.509 --> 01:03:21.390]  I mean, it's just 100 different ways this satanic world order.
[01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:24.509]  This Democrat death cult will spit in your face.
[01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:27.470]  Take the vaccine, safe and effective.
[01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:31.830]  Yeah, the Democrats just spat in your face and raped you.
[01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:32.830]  Wear the mask.
[01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:33.830]  Take the vax.
[01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:34.830]  Yeah.
[01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:41.710]  So, oh my gosh, what's going on here?
[01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:46.310]  It's only just beginning this realization.
[01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:48.910]  You live in a satanic world order.
[01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:52.350]  They trick you into taking a vaccine to poison you.
[01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:56.390]  They put fluoride in the water to make you stupid.
[01:03:56.390 --> 01:04:02.230]  You live under a satanic system that you most likely supported your whole life and you voted
[01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:06.910]  for because you thought it was trendy and you didn't want to be a racist, but you just
[01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:08.509]  got spat on and raped by them.
[01:04:08.509 --> 01:04:12.390]  So maybe you're finally starting to get it.
[01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:17.350]  Absolutely 100% guarantee it.
[01:04:17.350 --> 01:04:21.950]  They want to inject you with a vaccine that will make you allergic to beef.
[01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:22.950]  That's their plan.
[01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:26.509]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[01:04:26.509 --> 01:04:28.149]  Of course, that's what they're going to do.
[01:04:28.149 --> 01:04:31.750]  All right, look, we're going to have this from Alex Jones, breaking it all down on the
[01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:33.990]  other side of this short break.
[01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:38.630]  Alex is going to give you the intel on just how they're going to do this.
[01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:43.430]  And then we're going to circle back and I'm going to talk about this top level Department
[01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:50.950]  of Defense lady, Dr. Jan Halper Hayes, talking about, is this really how you complete Mission
[01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:53.910]  Impossible or is she naive like so many other people?
[01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:54.910]  It's all coming up.
[01:04:54.910 --> 01:05:00.109]  Alex Jones and more.
[01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:04.549]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through mother nature has given us the
[01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:05.549]  answer.
[01:05:05.549 --> 01:05:09.790]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it
[01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:15.390]  does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system, for your nervous system
[01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:16.390]  particularly.
[01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:18.470]  Everybody knows it's incredible, it works.
[01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:23.230]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:30.149]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from.
[01:05:30.149 --> 01:05:32.790]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:36.390]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:42.029]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:45.109]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:48.710]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:51.870]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:56.189]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[01:05:56.189 --> 01:05:57.189]  Rebel Zen.

[01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:12.790]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation, it's Owen Troyer.
[01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:16.790]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:21.790]  How did Alex Jones know?
[01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:26.790]  Why is the Alex Jones was right jar overflowing?
[01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:33.790]  Well, folks, they put their plans into print.
[01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.790]  They go in front of the World Economic Forum and they tell you.
[01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:38.790]  They go in front of TED Talks and they tell you.
[01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:45.790]  But it's like this magic trick where the card tricks man is right there with the deck of cards in front of you.
[01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:48.790]  And he pulls the card trick and you say, well, how did you do that?
[01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:49.790]  Well, he's doing it right in front of you.
[01:06:49.790 --> 01:06:52.790]  You just can't see it because he's not telling you how he's doing it.
[01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:53.790]  He's just showing you.
[01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:56.790]  So, yeah, they tell you we're going to make you stop eating beef.
[01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:58.790]  Oh, they got a plan on how to do that.
[01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:01.790]  And they might try to legislate it.
[01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:02.790]  They might try to write laws.
[01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:03.790]  They'll do that as well.
[01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:05.790]  They've got their political entities.
[01:07:05.790 --> 01:07:08.790]  But, folks, that's not their bottom line.
[01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:09.790]  They've got ways.
[01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:11.790]  And this is why they needed Obamacare.
[01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:12.790]  This is why they needed the pandemic.
[01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:17.790]  This is why they needed Joe Biden to sign your rights over to the World Health Organization so that they could forcefully inject you with a vaccine.
[01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:20.790]  Now, the trick is, oh, you're afraid of getting a virus.
[01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:22.790]  Go get the vaccine so you survive.
[01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:25.790]  But that vaccine is not to keep you alive.
[01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:28.790]  Maybe the next one, maybe this one was to kill you.
[01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:35.790]  Maybe the next one is to make you allergic to beef so they can finally do something about that pesky climate change and stop you from having a steak.
[01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:37.790]  Here's Alex Jones with all the intel.
[01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:42.790]  In 1996, the U.S. introduced food as a weapon.
[01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:45.790]  And now they've told us they're going to ban humans eating meat.
[01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:47.790]  But how are they going to do it?
[01:07:47.790 --> 01:08:02.790]  We've now discovered that many modern vaccines and the Moderna and Pfizer shots have a bovine protein in them that then creates an autoimmune response in those that take the shot so that many of them can no longer eat beef.
[01:08:02.790 --> 01:08:04.790]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's in the literature.
[01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:05.790]  It's in the documents.
[01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:07.790]  The plan to poison the food supply isn't coming.
[01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:11.790]  It's here by poisoning us to where we're allergic to beef.
[01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:12.790]  And that's just the start.
[01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:15.790]  This is the total weaponization of the food supply.
[01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:17.790]  This is how the globalists are making their move.
[01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:29.790]  Again, welcome back to this very important Monday edition of the broadcast, August 7th, 2023.
[01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:31.790]  I'm here in Dallas.
[01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:33.790]  I'm going to make a major announcement tomorrow morning.
[01:08:33.790 --> 01:08:36.790]  So watch Infowars.com for those developments.
[01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:48.790]  Okay, last week, I did a special report that was part one of getting into the fact that the globalists from all the research and all the evidence we have are preparing to attack the food supply.
[01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:50.790]  They're already doing it with GMO.
[01:08:50.790 --> 01:08:51.790]  They're already doing it with glyphosate.
[01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:53.790]  They're already doing it with so many things.
[01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:55.790]  And this is very similar to what happened with glyphosate.
[01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:56.790]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[01:08:56.790 --> 01:09:05.790]  But now they're all over BBC and Associated Press and USA Today saying the next pandemic will come through the food supply.
[01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:07.790]  And it's not safe.
[01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:09.790]  And we need the U.N. regulators to take control.
[01:09:09.790 --> 01:09:21.790]  You see them shutting down farms in the Netherlands, shutting down farms in Ireland, shutting down farms in areas of Asia, causing massive upheaval, social unrest, and starvation, an angrier world that Klaus Schwab talked about.
[01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:23.790]  So this is part two.
[01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:27.790]  We're going to do part three, part four, part five, at least six parts on this.
[01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:32.790]  And we're planning to make a documentary about the enemy's next attack plan.
[01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:38.790]  And it's going to be bigger than just attacking the food supply, but that's going to be a big part of the film that is now in production.
[01:09:38.790 --> 01:09:40.790]  But this info is too powerful and too important.
[01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:41.790]  We've got to get it out now.
[01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:46.790]  So there's a tick called the lone star tick that's in many parts of the United States.
[01:09:47.790 --> 01:09:54.790]  And the lone star tick has a protein crystal in it that, if it bites you, can begin to replicate in your body.
[01:09:54.790 --> 01:10:06.790]  And your body will then have an autoimmune response to that protein so that if you ever experience that protein again in any other type of meat, you will then feel absolutely terrible and have an autoimmune response.
[01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:12.790]  It's like if you were stung by a bee and then you get an allergy to it, the next time it could make you really sick, could even kill you.
[01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:15.790]  So here's the information we are about to break down.
[01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:16.790]  This is beyond critical.
[01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:19.790]  So they're hyping up, we need to get rid of beef.
[01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:21.790]  They're hyping up, you will soon eat the bugs.
[01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:26.790]  They are saying we've got to stop producing beef because of methane and all these lies.
[01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:30.790]  Sea levels are going to rise and kill us all like they've been saying for decades that it didn't happen.
[01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:39.790]  And then they come out and say, because of this tick, it turns out a large part of the population is suddenly not going to be able to eat beef anymore,
[01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:45.790]  particularly because of this chemical that it puts in you or this prion crystal.
[01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:47.790]  Very similar to mad cow disease.
[01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:49.790]  You remember that showed up in England.
[01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:52.790]  They had to kill millions of cows and sheep and all the rest of it.
[01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:53.790]  Most of them didn't even have it.
[01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:56.790]  It came from feeding rotten meat to cows and sheep.
[01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:58.790]  They weren't even supposed to eat meat.
[01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:10.790]  Remember, they were taking dead animals, even dead pets, and grinding them up with wheat and corn and turning it into what they call a goo or an ooze, literally, and feeding it to them.
[01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:16.790]  Then the crystals would begin to grow in the guts because their guts aren't designed to eat meat and go through the gut wall into the brain.
[01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:20.790]  And then it would grow the crystals inside of the brain.
[01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:26.790]  So I'm going to go over here to the desk with Rob Duthats with me because he's done even more research on this than I have.
[01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:31.790]  We're going to go over just this one big piece of the puzzle because guess what?
[01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:40.790]  The tick that bites you, it puts the same protein in you that they admit is in many of the so-called vaccines.
[01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:46.790]  And the CDC even admits that it could be the vaccines that are giving this to people.
[01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:52.790]  Kind of like Reuters and AP admit, most polio cases are from Bill Gates and the UN vaccine.
[01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:55.790]  Just like you think glyphosate's a problem.
[01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:56.790]  This is much worse.
[01:11:56.790 --> 01:12:09.790]  But remember, they first only sprayed Roundup or glyphosate on corn crops and on soybeans when they were growing to kill weeds, but usually early on so the corn could get going or the soybeans could get going.
[01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:10.790]  One application.
[01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:21.790]  Then they learned they could spray it on the wheat when it was becoming ripe or ready for harvest in the late summer, early fall because they would lose a lot of the wheat because of fungal growth.
[01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:27.790]  Well, it turns out that if you spray glyphosate, it also kills fungus, but it was soaking on the wheat.
[01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:36.790]  And as soon as that got approved in the early 2000s, that's when you saw the massive, quote, gluten intolerancy exploding.
[01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:42.790]  People never had it because what you're intolerant to is glyphosate that will literally kill you long term, grow cancers, you name it.
[01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:47.790]  So this is the same thing where it's in the shots, it's in the vaccines, it's in the vaccines they're giving the cows.
[01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:50.790]  Particularly, it starts growing in them.
[01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:52.790]  You eat them, you get sick.
[01:12:52.790 --> 01:13:00.790]  And see, now people can't eat beef anymore, just like we saw wheat sales get cut in half the last 15, 16, 17 years.
[01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:02.790]  And, oh, I just suddenly can't eat gluten.
[01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:04.790]  It's not the gluten, folks.
[01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:07.790]  It's you have a Roundup allergy because it's a poison.
[01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:09.790]  So we're going to go over to the desk right here.
[01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:15.790]  We're going to show you this in part two, then part three, part four, part five, at least six parts just on this.
[01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:19.790]  Because they tell you imminently you're not going to eat beef or other meats anymore.
[01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:22.790]  And they're the ones running the whole system.
[01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:23.790]  So we're going to break this down.
[01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:24.790]  Stay with us.
[01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:26.790]  Rob, we really know what they're about to do.
[01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:27.790]  They always pre-plan.
[01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:28.790]  They always pre-program.
[01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:30.790]  Let's go over this research.
[01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:31.790]  Yeah, so we got the Mayo Clinic here.
[01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:33.790]  Just talking about alpha-gal syndrome.
[01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:36.790]  It's a food allergy that makes people allergic to red meat and other products from mammals.
[01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:42.790]  So anything that a mammal, that would be goat, that would be pig, anything like that, you're going to become allergic to it.
[01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:44.790]  One of the cow identifies as a duck.
[01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:45.790]  I'm sorry.
[01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:46.790]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:49.790]  And they're saying here, of course, it's just the lone star tick, nothing else.
[01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:52.790]  But here, these products may contain alpha-gal.
[01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:54.790]  So, of course, they talk about meats.
[01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:55.790]  And that's from the CDC.
[01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:56.790]  And this is a CDC document right here.
[01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:57.790]  You flip this over.
[01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:59.790]  Non-food products that contain alpha-gal.
[01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:00.790]  Oh, vaccines.
[01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:01.790]  Oh, okay.
[01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:03.790]  And it's an additive, a stabilizer, or a coating.
[01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:08.790]  And it said it could be in the gelatin, in the glycerin, magnesium serrate, or bovine extract.
[01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:16.790]  Bovine extract is what you get when you basically take a fetal cow and, you know, grind it up and turn it into a medium that this stuff grows on.
[01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:19.790]  So it could also be from other hard cows.
[01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:20.790]  Yeah, they used to grow it on dead babies.
[01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:21.790]  Now they grow it on dead cows.
[01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:22.790]  Exactly.
[01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:24.790]  Yeah, they don't do, well, they still do some.
[01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:25.790]  They still do some, but yeah.
[01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:26.790]  But then you go to the link here.
[01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:27.790]  There's a link right here.
[01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:28.790]  You go to that.
[01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:31.790]  Here's the link that shows all the vaccines that could potentially have this.
[01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:35.790]  And I just highlighted the ones of bovine and cerumen.
[01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:37.790]  So the DTaP vaccine is one.
[01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:38.790]  Hepatitis A.
[01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:39.790]  MMR.
[01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:41.790]  Yeah, they have similar lipid particles that grow protein.
[01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:42.790]  Right.
[01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:43.790]  Different MMRs.
[01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:44.790]  The rotavirus.
[01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:45.790]  So they're obsessed with colonizing us with proteins.
[01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:46.790]  Exactly.
[01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:50.790]  And they can add to the protein, the type of protein it is, to cause an allergic response.
[01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:57.790]  Kind of like the UN got caught adding a hormone in second trimester pregnancies to tetanus shots to create spontaneous miscarriages.
[01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:58.790]  Exactly.
[01:14:58.790 --> 01:15:02.790]  So you have all these different vaccines that have the different products that they mentioned in here.
[01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:03.790]  Gelatin.
[01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:04.790]  Glycerin.
[01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:05.790]  Bovine extract.
[01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:06.790]  Magnesium.
[01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:07.790]  Serrate.
[01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:08.790]  Now, here's an interesting article here.
[01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:10.790]  And again, the tick puts the same protein in you.
[01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:12.790]  Anaphylaxis after zoster vaccine.
[01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:13.790]  That's your shingles vaccine.
[01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:15.790]  Implicating alpha-gal allergy as possible mechanism.
[01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:18.790]  Now, what's one of the things you do get from the COVID vaccine?
[01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:22.790]  A side effect is herpes zoster virus, which is also known as shingles.
[01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:25.790]  So right there, here's a connection from PubMed.
[01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:28.790]  This is right there on their website.
[01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:29.790]  Anaphylaxis after zoster vaccine.
[01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:32.790]  Implicating alpha-gal allergy as possible mechanism.
[01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:35.790]  So somehow the alpha-gal is getting into the vaccines.
[01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:37.790]  Of course, they're doing it on purpose.
[01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:38.790]  Then it's getting into your body.
[01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:40.790]  And then all of a sudden you have an allergy to red meat.
[01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:44.790]  And that's how we're going to be taught to eat the bugs.
[01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:49.790]  We warned you nine years ago with Dr. Edward Gribb about mRNA shots now that we're coming.
[01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:52.790]  We predicted everything that happened three and a half years ago.
[01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:53.790]  We told you what would unfold.
[01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:55.790]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are pre-programming everybody.
[01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:56.790]  Everybody ready.
[01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:59.790]  Everybody prepared that you're not going to be able to eat meat anymore.
[01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:03.790]  And already I know a bunch of people who can't eat red meat and have this allergy.
[01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:05.790]  And they weren't bitten by a tick.
[01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:07.790]  But they have been taking the, quote, modern vaccines.
[01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:10.790]  So they don't want you eating meat.
[01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:11.790]  They give you a very serious allergy.
[01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:13.790]  And they can do this right down the line.
[01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:14.790]  They don't want you to have a baby.
[01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:15.790]  You take the tetanus shot.
[01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:18.790]  The UN got caught doing it on record in the mid-'90s in Africa.
[01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:23.790]  They add the hormone that the mother releases at the start of the second trimester.
[01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:25.790]  The body then creates an autoimmune response to that.
[01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:27.790]  Attacks the baby 100% of the time.
[01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:29.790]  Spontaneous miscarriage.
[01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:31.790]  So they want you to be allergic to a baby.
[01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:32.790]  They can make you allergic to your baby.
[01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:34.790]  They want to make you allergic to red meat.
[01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:35.790]  Make you allergic to that.
[01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:38.790]  They can make you allergic to anything they want, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:42.790]  And we now know that they used to grow some of the vaccines on peanut protein.
[01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:43.790]  Remember that?
[01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:44.790]  So they grow it on humans.
[01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:45.790]  Peanut protein.
[01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:48.790]  Rotten baby monkeys.
[01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:51.790]  They literally rot them.
[01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:53.790]  Baby cows.
[01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:56.790]  And it's not just what they're trying to make you allergic to.
[01:16:56.790 --> 01:17:04.790]  All the other weird viruses and bacteria and mRNA and RNA and DNA that's just swirling around in all this.
[01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:07.790]  It's all contaminated even if they don't want to contaminate it.
[01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.790]  I've had top scientists on warning you about this.
[01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:12.790]  So they're injecting you with something.
[01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:14.790]  So you have an autoimmune response to it.
[01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:18.790]  And then everything else that's in there, your body's going to start having an autoimmune response to.
[01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:20.790]  This is totally insane.
[01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:22.790]  Please share this report.
[01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:25.790]  It will be posted to Bandop Video because this is the enemy next attack.
[01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:27.790]  You can see it.
[01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:28.790]  It's coming.
[01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:29.790]  We can get ahead of this one.
[01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:30.790]  Please.
[01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:31.790]  This is tomorrow's news today.
[01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:33.790]  I don't want to warn you about something and have it come true.
[01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:36.790]  Now I want to warn you and have us stop it together.
[01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:37.790]  God bless.
[01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:38.790]  Now it's up to you.
[01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:46.790]  Now here's the above all understanding and realization.
[01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:50.790]  And to even better understand it, you know, you recognize it as evil.
[01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:54.790]  You recognize it as death.
[01:17:54.790 --> 01:18:01.790]  But that's not how the controllers of the planet, many of them, recognize it.
[01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:06.790]  And there's a great movie I believe that's an allegory to this paradigm.
[01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:14.790]  It's called Snowpiercer where essentially the people in the back of the train, the lower classes, feel like they're getting screwed.
[01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:17.790]  So finally the guy makes it to the front of the train.
[01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:18.790]  And spoiler alert here.
[01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:21.790]  If you've never seen it, but he makes it to the front of the train.
[01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:25.790]  And the guy at the front of the train is like, hey, I got to run this train.
[01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:28.790]  And if I don't run this train, then everybody dies.
[01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:33.790]  So you can be mad at me for doing the population control and killing off your people every four years.
[01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:34.790]  But guess what?
[01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:35.790]  If I didn't do that, we'd all die.
[01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:39.790]  So I'm actually running humanity for the betterment of humanity.
[01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:43.790]  And yes, that means I got to kill some people.
[01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:53.790]  So again, it's just an allegory for what the ruling class, the elite, really think they're doing.
[01:18:53.790 --> 01:19:00.790]  Some of them probably actually think it's a noble thing or at least they'll pretend it is.
[01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:05.790]  See, what's the final message of the film?
[01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:11.790]  When the individual from the lower class from the back of the train is having this all explained to him,
[01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:18.790]  he's starting to kind of think about it and consider it and he sits down and reflects on it.
[01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:20.790]  And he listens to Winston, who's the guy running the train.
[01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:22.790]  He says, I have to do this because I love you.
[01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:24.790]  I have to do this because I love humanity.
[01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:25.790]  I'm saving humanity by doing this.
[01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:29.790]  I'm gracious.
[01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:30.790]  Here, you want my job?
[01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:31.790]  You do it.
[01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:35.790]  And he sits there and he's considering it.
[01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:43.790]  And then a panel pulls up from the floor and it's a child who's basically being used for slave labor.
[01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:46.790]  And in that moment, everything changes.
[01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:48.790]  And he no longer sees the good in it.
[01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:49.790]  He no longer cares.
[01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:51.790]  Oh, you're saying you're saving humanity?
[01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:52.790]  F you.
[01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:53.790]  You have child slaves here.
[01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:58.790]  It's time for you to die.
[01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:59.790]  But that's the allegory.
[01:19:59.790 --> 01:20:04.790]  The ruling class, the people that run this planet, really think they're the noble class.
[01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:08.790]  And, of course, they're godless.
[01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:13.790]  They're blinded.
[01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:20.790]  Or they really do believe in all of it and they do believe in Satan and this is just the role they decided to take up here.
[01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:27.790]  But, no, that's what they believe, that they have to control population on this planet.
[01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:29.790]  I mean, what was it just over a year?
[01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:32.790]  It was like a year and a half ago they blew up the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:36.790]  What did the Georgia Guidestones say?
[01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:40.790]  Maintain a perpetual population.
[01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:44.790]  I think it was like a quarter million or something.
[01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:48.790]  500 million, was it?
[01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:51.790]  That's what it's all about.
[01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:54.790]  That's the big secret.
[01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:59.790]  That's the big slave planet.
[01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:03.790]  But, you see, the controllers have a problem.
[01:21:03.790 --> 01:21:12.790]  You've got too much of an ease of access to energy, high standard of living and everything that comes with it, and so you've got to be shut down.
[01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:13.790]  You've experienced it too good.
[01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:14.790]  You don't deserve it.
[01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:15.790]  You're a bug.
[01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:16.790]  You're a parasite.
[01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:20.790]  You need to be treated as such.
[01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:23.790]  It was all right there on the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:25.790]  Why do they call them Guidestones?
[01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:31.790]  Why do they pretend like they're the noble class?
[01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:42.790]  Maybe they have been accepted ritualistically into this secret cult that's been around for thousands of years,
[01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:50.790]  and they've just anointed themselves the stewards or enslavers of humanity.
[01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:55.790]  Passed on for millennia.
[01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:57.790]  And they've just decided, yeah, you know what?
[01:21:57.790 --> 01:22:01.790]  We've just got to have population control here.
[01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:06.790]  There's only one Earth, and there's only a finite amount of resources, and so we've got to control it.
[01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:15.790]  But the truth is we actually have unlimited resources, and there's probably unlimited Earths or Earth.
[01:22:15.790 --> 01:22:17.790]  But they don't want you to know that.
[01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:19.790]  They want it all for themselves.
[01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:27.790]  And that's why it's a big act, and that's why they have to lie to you about it.
[01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:30.790]  Yeah, that pretty much boils it down.
[01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:35.790]  The ruling class of this planet wants total population control and slavery,
[01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:39.790]  at least these psychotics out of the West.
[01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:43.790]  But it's funny when Bill Gates gets in front of TED Talks and talks about releasing mosquitoes
[01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:48.790]  and vaccinating people with mosquitoes and using vaccines to get the human population down to zero.
[01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:50.790]  That's funny.
[01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:51.790]  It's funny.
[01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:52.790]  It's Bill Gates in a pink sweater.
[01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:54.790]  He's got $200 billion.
[01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:55.790]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:57.790]  That's hilarious.
[01:22:57.790 --> 01:23:01.790]  That's funny.
[01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:06.790]  But, you see, that's why Elon Musk has become so popular, because when you juxtapose Elon Musk
[01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:10.790]  with these other billionaires that want to get involved in politics and culture,
[01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:15.790]  like Bill Gates wants you to take the vaccine,
[01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:17.790]  Elon Musk is out calling them out.
[01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:25.790]  Just this week Elon Musk was ranting about George Soros and how much he hates humanity
[01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:33.790]  and how much all the people that he works with hate humanity.
[01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:34.790]  But that's what it is.
[01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:40.790]  It's that we are on the cusp of the next industrial revolution,
[01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:46.790]  and the last industrial revolution did so much for the standard of living for humanity
[01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:52.790]  in modern history that the enslavers of this planet, they don't want humanity to go to the next level.
[01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:57.790]  They want to go to the next level, and then they want to keep humanity down beneath them.
[01:23:57.790 --> 01:24:04.790]  But it's going to be new energy sources, new resources, new discoveries, artificial intelligence.
[01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:06.790]  I mean, it's all inevitable.
[01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:09.790]  It's all coming.
[01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:12.790]  And you might not like that, and that's fine, and I might not like that.
[01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:14.790]  Elon Musk has accepted it, probably likes it.
[01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:17.790]  But yeah, he actually wants to see humans involved.
[01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:20.790]  He's got like 10 kids or something, and he actually wants humans to be involved.
[01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:21.790]  He likes humans.
[01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:22.790]  He likes the human creativity.
[01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:26.790]  He likes humans being a part of the process and everything that comes with it.
[01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:29.790]  The ruling class that hates him so much, they hate humans.
[01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:30.790]  They don't want you.
[01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:32.790]  They want the highways open.
[01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:36.790]  They want the skyscrapers empty, if not destroyed.
[01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:38.790]  They want the airwaves empty.
[01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:39.790]  They want the skies empty.
[01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:43.790]  They want full totalitarian control, everything running off algorithms,
[01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:48.790]  no human involvement whatsoever.
[01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:53.790]  But they use the excuse that they're the nobility.
[01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:54.790]  They're the stewards of humanity.
[01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:58.790]  They've got to keep population at a certain level because you, the human, are pesky.
[01:24:58.790 --> 01:25:03.790]  You're killing this planet.
[01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:07.790]  And of course, where does this all derive?
[01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:14.790]  With the idea that you evolved from pond scum and that you're not a divine creation
[01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:19.790]  in the image of God.
[01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:22.790]  That's why they lie to you.
[01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:24.790]  That's why they lie to you and cover up your history.
[01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:28.790]  That's why they lie to you and cover up the history of this planet.
[01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:33.790]  That's why they want to remove the Bible out of all the institutions.
[01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:40.790]  Because the big secret is, the big mystery that we all look up into the sky in wonderment,
[01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:41.790]  how did I get here?
[01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:42.790]  What am I doing here?
[01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:46.790]  You were created by God.
[01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:51.790]  You are in God's masterpiece.
[01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:56.790]  Part of that fire of creation in you.
[01:25:56.790 --> 01:26:01.790]  And all these satanic globalists want to do is put that fire out.
[01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:02.790]  So they lie to you.
[01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:06.790]  They tell you you evolved from a squirrel or a monkey turd or something.
[01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:09.790]  They tell you all these lies that you're a parasite on this planet.
[01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:14.790]  There's not room for all of us.
[01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:16.790]  That's the big secret.
[01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:17.790]  There it is.
[01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:18.790]  I mean, that's it.
[01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:27.790]  You're a divine creation in the image of God, in this majestic spectacle known as life and consciousness and earth.
[01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:32.790]  And it's amazing and it's beautiful and it inspires.
[01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:35.790]  And that's what the globalists are here to put out.
[01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:37.790]  They want it to be a total.
[01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.790]  See, they want the next industrial revolution to be theirs.
[01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:47.790]  Total planetary grid system, total control, every inch of the planet, AI, algorithms, processing, processing, processing,
[01:26:47.790 --> 01:26:49.790]  human not a part of the equation.
[01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:51.790]  They dominate.
[01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:53.790]  You become a slave till you die off.
[01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:58.790]  They advance into some new artificial intelligence hive mind merging with machine.
[01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:00.790]  That's the big plan.
[01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:03.790]  That's their big plan.
[01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:07.790]  And that's hell on earth, folks.
[01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:10.790]  That's hell on earth.
[01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:22.790]  But imagine, imagine, imagine being so sold out to evil and Satan that you can't even be inspired to be good just by the earth and the life around you.
[01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:24.790]  All right.
[01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:27.790]  We're going to stop waxing here in response to that Alex Jones segment.
[01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:29.790]  We do have more coming up from Alex Jones.
[01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:32.790]  I'm going to circle back to what we were talking about with Dr. Jan Halper Hayes coming up.
[01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:37.790]  Ladies and gentlemen, everything we do here is brought to you by you shopping at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:41.790]  Now, now, now, imagine that report from Alex Jones.
[01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:48.790]  And we'll have more dealing with the vaccine and the alpha gall and making you allergic to meat and other foods.
[01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:55.790]  You won't hear about that in the mainstream news because pharmaceutical companies pay for their programming.
[01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:56.790]  Not here.
[01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:59.790]  We're funded by you shopping at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:27:59.790 --> 01:28:03.790]  And we got great products on sale right now.
[01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:05.790]  In fact, guys, go ahead.
[01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:08.790]  I mean, we got vitamin mineral fusion in stock.
[01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:09.790]  Twenty five percent off.
[01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:14.790]  We got the brand new alpha excuse me, rebels in CBD.

[01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:20.790]  Don't forget about the air filters.
[01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:21.790]  I mean, it's so key.
[01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:25.790]  I just guys pull up the air filters for me, actually.
[01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:31.790]  In fact, I mean, I'm kind of is a little personal business, maybe even personal business for me here on air.
[01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:35.790]  I was resetting my air filters last night, man.
[01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:41.790]  I'm telling you, every time I do this, it just I reevaluate how important it is to have an air filter.
[01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:43.790]  I'm switching the air filters out.
[01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:44.790]  I mean, my goodness.
[01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:46.790]  I wouldn't think I live in my house by myself.
[01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:48.790]  I don't have any pets.
[01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:50.790]  I switch my air filters every six months.
[01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:53.790]  And the thing is like black, how dirty it is.
[01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:55.790]  So, folks, I'm telling you, get the air filter now.

[01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:34.790]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing best, producing and making the MyPillow.
[01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:44.790]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:45.790]  That's what the debanking is about.
[01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:47.790]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:55.790]  That's why we've got a rush to support MyPillow.com and Infowars.com, plus their great products in both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[01:29:56.790 --> 01:30:02.790]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.

[01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:05.790]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:26.500]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:32.900]  Do you think, since you spend a lot of your life thinking about communications, the media,
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:39.900]  social media, where are we in five years?
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:43.900]  Is speech restored to the average person or is there less speech?
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:52.900]  I would say, without trying to kiss your ass, because I'm not an ass kisser, that's down to people like you, fighting the good fight.
[01:33:52.900 --> 01:34:00.900]  Depends on the American political climate, which obviously you have a lot of sway over, and America is the king of the world, whether anyone likes it or not.
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:06.900]  I believe it's the negative ideas from England and America that have certainly made this happen to me.
[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:09.900]  Also, my case is important for countries in Eastern Europe.
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:13.900]  Obviously, Romania is a big ally of the United States, has been for a very long time.
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.900]  They have a very good relationship with the United States.
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:23.900]  If Romania are happy to, if important people in Romania, who I know speak highly of me, stand up and say,
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:28.900]  we're not going to publicly crucify this guy because America doesn't like him or because England doesn't like him.
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:32.900]  I believe this is a very good moment for Eastern European countries as well, NATO allies.
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:33.900]  That's right.
[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:35.900]  To say, look, we don't have to do everything you say.
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:40.900]  We don't have to follow this insane agenda of accusing people you don't like with imaginary crimes and throwing them in jail.
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:42.900]  This can be a victory for Romania.
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:44.900]  The work you're doing can be a victory for the United States.
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:47.900]  England's lost, so forget England.
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:48.900]  There's no free speech in England.
[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:49.900]  That's over.
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:58.900]  So it all depends on what shifts happen, who wins the next elections, how effective cancellations are.
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:08.900]  You have people like, you know, Rumble, Elon fighting against this silencing of every idea that's counterintuitive to the agenda of the deep state or the matrix, as my brother calls them.
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:12.900]  So I don't know, but it's a very interesting time to be alive.
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:18.900]  I would like the optimist in me would like to think there's finally enough pushback.
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:20.900]  So let's take Alex Jones.
[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:22.900]  You don't have to agree with everything Alex Jones says.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:23.900]  I like Alex Jones.
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:24.900]  I don't.
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:25.900]  I don't agree with everything Alex Jones says.
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:27.900]  And you don't have to.
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:33.900]  But Bill Maher famously and credit to him said when Alex Jones got banned, he said we shouldn't be banning people.
[01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:35.900]  He said, I hate Alex Jones, but Alex Jones should be allowed to talk.
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:37.900]  Everyone should be allowed to talk.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:41.900]  I don't like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak.
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:42.900]  Everybody gets to speak.
[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:43.900]  Sure.
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:46.900]  I feel like when they got Alex Jones, there was no safety net.
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:49.900]  He is a warrior, and he continued fighting, and now he's back in the mainstream.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:50.900]  Good for him.
[01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:57.900]  But he was renegaded to his own site with his own servers, streaming every day to small audiences after they axed him off YouTube.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.900]  No one defended him.
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:00.900]  No one.
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:01.900]  I was on vacation that day.
[01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:03.900]  I was fishing out of the country.
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:09.900]  And the company that I worked for, which is supposedly in favor of free speech, said not one word in his defense.
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:11.900]  And it's like first they came for Alex Jones.
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:12.900]  I didn't care.
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:13.900]  That's totally right.
[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:14.900]  Yeah.
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:15.900]  It's the old adage.
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:23.900]  So now there is a, I don't want to call it counterculture, but if you cancel people, look, they canceled Andrew.
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:24.900]  How successful was that?
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:26.900]  He's sitting here with you today.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:27.900]  He's bigger than ever.
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:29.900]  His voice is louder than ever.
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:35.900]  Now, thanks to people like Alex Jones, who took the initial brunt of the weapon, the cancellation weapon,
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:39.900]  now there are lots of different platforms, lots of different apps, lots of different applications.
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:44.900]  I mean, Elon's taken over Twitter, which was a mainstream app, which censored people very heavily.
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:45.900]  The pushback has started.
[01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:54.900]  So the optimist in me would like to look at the trend line and say things are getting better as compared to when they canceled Alex six, seven years ago.
[01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:55.900]  It does feel that way.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:56.900]  Yeah, it does feel that way.
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:58.900]  So I'm going to be hopeful for the future.
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:02.900]  But also, I don't know what these people are capable of.
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:04.900]  I don't know what they're capable of.
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:06.900]  Look what's happened in my life.
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:07.900]  This is unthinkable.
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:10.900]  Two years ago, if you were to say, hey, Tristan, you'd be in jail for human trafficking.
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:11.900]  I'd be like, what?
[01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:12.900]  Human trafficking?
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:13.900]  Prison?
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:16.900]  How long have you been locked up in prison in your home?
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:20.900]  I have not been free since December 29th of 2022.
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:22.900]  I have not had a single day of freedom.
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:24.900]  I've either been locked in jail or locked up here.
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:28.900]  I've only ever left this house or left jail to attend court.
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:34.900]  That's it.
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:43.900]  Now, let's explain why free speech is so important, including for people you despise or disagree with even.
[01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:47.900]  Take a look at what happened in the year 2020.
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:48.900]  It's just one issue.
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:50.900]  I mean, we can get into the lies about Trump.
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:52.900]  We can get into the Hunter Biden laptop.
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:56.900]  But let's just talk about the pandemic and the vaccines.
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:07.900]  Members of the media and the medical community, doctors, nurses that were warning, hell, even Pfizer executives.
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:10.900]  Scientists.
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:16.900]  That were warning the side effects of the vaccine, telling you it's not safe or effective.
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:23.900]  Telling you everything that was going to happen with the blood clots and myocarditis, the neurological problems, weakening your immune system, all of it.
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:25.900]  They were censored.
[01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:26.900]  They were banned.
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:30.900]  They were removed.
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:32.900]  And of course, it was because, well, we got to get it.
[01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:33.900]  We got to do the right thing.
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:35.900]  We got to get everybody on board with the vaccines.
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:40.900]  We got to get everybody to take it so that we can all get immune and get through this.
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:44.900]  And let's just pretend we all know that that was.
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:50.900]  It was all by design, but let's just pretend that, oh, you know, we really do care.
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:53.900]  We really do want to defeat this pandemic.
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:39:01.900]  We got to have unified messages and we got to get everybody to take the vaccine and we got to all be on board and any dissent must be destroyed.
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:03.900]  But you were wrong.
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:09.900]  And you silenced the voices that were right.
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:16.900]  It's hard to even put into words how dangerous that is.
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:27.900]  Except to understand that that's how tyrannies form, when the voices of dissent are silenced, marginalized and attacked.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:33.900]  Now, you never know when that one voice that you got behind the censorship of, the removal of, you never know.
[01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:36.900]  That voice might have been right.
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:45.900]  And when it comes to COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccines, those voices were right.
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:54.900]  But because they were silenced, because they were censored, the doctors, the scientists, all of it, people took the vaccine and people died.
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:40:05.900]  And they lost their loved ones and they lost their children and they lost their lives because of the attack on free speech.
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:18.900]  And the beauty of free speech is it allows equal opportunity for all sides of an argument and ideology to be heard and then you get to make up your mind.
[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:23.900]  It's sad that we even have to explain this.
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:26.900]  It's sad that we even have to go through this in the United States of America.
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:39.900]  But I guess that's what's happened with the Marxist, communist, Chinese takeover of our entertainment and of our education system.
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:45.900]  That we wouldn't even understand these basic principles and why free speech is so important.
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:54.900]  And in fact, there's been a big attack now with a famous hip-hop singer, Ne-Yo.
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:58.900]  And I saw this interview he did.
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:06.900]  Sounds like, I mean, he's obviously smart enough to go with common sense and not leftist propaganda.
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:12.900]  And he's in an interview talking about how he's a parent and he thinks parents' roles have been confused.
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:15.900]  And he gets into the trans kid issue and he's talking about how it's just insane.
[01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:18.900]  And trans kids, this is the dumbest thing we've ever heard.
[01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:22.900]  Singer Ne-Yo, furious about parents who push transgenderism on children, it makes no sense.
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:29.900]  R&B performer Ne-Yo says parents who let minors make life-changing gender decisions have forgotten their roles.
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:35.900]  But oh, now Ne-Yo has had to come out and he's had to apologize.
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:38.900]  Wouldn't you like to know that process?
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:45.900]  Wouldn't you like to know the process that went down from Ne-Yo, just speaking common sense,
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:49.900]  just common sense on a podcast interview saying, yeah, I don't understand the trans kids issue.
[01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:50.900]  It makes no sense.
[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:54.900]  To then having to come out and make a public apology?
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:57.900]  Wouldn't you like to know the process?
[01:41:57.900 --> 01:41:58.900]  Who called Ne-Yo?
[01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:00.900]  Who called his agents?
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:01.900]  Who demanded the apology?
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:03.900]  Who felt threatened?
[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.900]  How did that go down?
[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:08.900]  That's the story now.
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:10.900]  Same thing with Jamie Foxx.
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:17.900]  Jamie Foxx offers apology following anti-Semitism accusations over controversial Instagram posts.
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:23.900]  Oh, because he's a Christian.
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:26.900]  Because he's a Christian, he's anti-Semitic now.
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:30.900]  So he had to apologize to the Jewish community.
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:33.900]  Again, how does that process go down?
[01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:38.900]  So you see, there's the chilling of free speech, which is the bullying.
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:43.900]  And then there's the complete censorship of free speech, which is the tyranny.
[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:45.900]  And it's all coming from one direction.
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:52.900]  The left, liberals, communists, Marxists, Satanists.
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.900]  They're all the same.
[01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:02.900]  When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground,
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:06.900]  you must find a way.
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:10.900]  When the darkness descends and you're told it's the end,
[01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:13.900]  you must find a way.
[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:17.900]  When God decides to look the other way and a clown takes the throne,
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.900]  we must find a way.
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:21.900]  You will find a way.
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:25.900]  Dig down and find faith.
[01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:29.900]  When you're close to the edge with a gun to your head,
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:32.900]  you must find a way.
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:35.900]  We have entered the fray and we will not obey.
[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:40.900]  We must find a way and find faith.
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:47.900]  We won't let them divide.
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:50.900]  We will never abide.
[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:52.900]  We will find a way.
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:54.900]  Infowars.com
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:44:00.900]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported Infowars financially

[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:05.900]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists
[01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:09.900]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover
[01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:10.900]  is because of you.
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:13.900]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:16.900]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at Infowars.com
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:20.900]  like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.

[01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:44.900]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support freedom
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:47.900]  to take action now and be part of the global awakening,
[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:50.900]  the new renaissance that's countering the Great Reset
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:54.900]  by going to Infowars.com and clicking on the Donate button and giving today.
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:56.900]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:57.900]  Please take action.
[01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:01.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:04.900]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.900]  plan for our future.
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:07.900]  That is a hellish future.
[01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:11.900]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.900]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:16.900]  at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowars.com.
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:20.900]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:22.900]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:25.900]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:28.900]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:30.900]  a signed copy, at Infowars.com.
[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:34.900]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:37.900]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:40.900]  You'll also know that you helped keep Infowars on the air.
[01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:43.900]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:44.900]  or unsigned copies.
[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:48.900]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowars.com
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:51.900]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:54.900]  and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:56.900]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you.
[01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:57.900]  And thank you for your support.
[01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:00.900]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders,
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:05.900]  the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations,
[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:08.900]  the economy going crazy, you are crazy, in my view,
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:12.900]  if you don't get high-quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:14.900]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:17.900]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:19.900]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:22.900]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:24.900]  or water filtration.
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:27.900]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department
[01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:30.900]  and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:33.900]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:36.900]  you're going to find and still get quality.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:41.900]  Infowars.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:43.900]  and on water and air filtration.
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:46.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:48.900]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:50.900]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:55.900]  Go to Infowars.com and get prepared while you still can.
[01:46:57.190 --> 01:47:07.190]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:33.450]  Let me tell you quickly here, we've got some programming notes, we're going to be joined
[01:47:33.450 --> 01:47:42.610]  in the next hour again by Alex Jones and then by Jeremy Nell, who is going to give us an
[01:47:42.610 --> 01:47:49.769]  update on the situation in South Africa, that's where he resides and does commentary.
[01:47:49.769 --> 01:47:53.490]  So Jeremy Nell and then Gerald Salente, your fourth hour host, I'm going to be back hosting
[01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:59.170]  the War Room today and I'll get into what I've kind of unintentionally ended up teasing
[01:47:59.170 --> 01:48:06.930]  here, which is the story behind Judge Chutkan, which we kind of got into last week, but
[01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:09.809]  there's more now.
[01:48:09.809 --> 01:48:16.290]  And then this clip that Trump shared over the weekend of Dr. Jan Halpern Hayes and what
[01:48:16.290 --> 01:48:18.050]  people are saying about that.
[01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:21.690]  I've also got some other geopolitical news we may be getting to here as well, but I want
[01:48:21.690 --> 01:48:25.730]  to get into, since we're talking about the vaccines and the side effects and how they
[01:48:25.730 --> 01:48:30.769]  can use this to create other side effects intentionally, give you a vaccine for some
[01:48:30.769 --> 01:48:34.890]  hemorrhagic fever that they release out of a lab, you see people bleeding out of their
[01:48:34.890 --> 01:48:38.690]  eyes, their ears, you say, my God, I'm scared to death, I'm going to go take this vaccine.
[01:48:38.690 --> 01:48:45.610]  And then you take the vaccine, maybe it stops the bleeding and now you're allergic to beef.
[01:48:45.610 --> 01:48:51.290]  Emergency broadcast, UK government scientists admit to developing disease X vaccine for
[01:48:51.290 --> 01:48:53.170]  the next pandemic.
[01:48:53.170 --> 01:48:57.530]  And Harrison Smith was covering that this morning.
[01:48:57.530 --> 01:49:02.170]  Disease X, disease Y, disease Z, disease who gives a damn.
[01:49:02.170 --> 01:49:09.090]  They make it in a lab, they use the media to drive the fear mechanisms, and then they
[01:49:09.090 --> 01:49:14.890]  deceive you and they trick you into taking a lethal injection.
[01:49:14.890 --> 01:49:16.769]  But it's got to be scary.
[01:49:16.769 --> 01:49:19.849]  It's got to be a scary name.
[01:49:19.849 --> 01:49:23.930]  And if they really want effectiveness, it's going to have to be a virus that is actually
[01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:26.250]  having people drop dead.
[01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:30.170]  Because I mean, in the beginning of the pandemic.
[01:49:30.270 --> 01:49:39.250]  In 2020, I mean, there's some level of rational concern or even fear.
[01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:47.310]  Some level, but in reality, if you're sound of mind, you can drown out all the noise,
[01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:51.850]  you can drown out all the sound, and you can just look at the world around you and analyze
[01:49:51.850 --> 01:49:55.030]  the threat and respond accordingly.
[01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:58.270]  So I knew there was really nothing to be afraid of with the virus.
[01:49:58.270 --> 01:50:01.230]  I never stopped going out, never wore a mask.
[01:50:01.230 --> 01:50:04.510]  You may remember me and the crew went out, we did a video when they locked down Austin,
[01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:08.650]  we were riding around on minibikes, streets completely empty, police tried to pull us
[01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:13.950]  over and tell us to go home, we said no, and then they left us alone.
[01:50:13.950 --> 01:50:20.950]  I remember getting on airplanes and I mean, I was taking flights where there'd be eight,
[01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:23.930]  nine, 10 people on a plane.
[01:50:23.930 --> 01:50:27.750]  And that was the fear level.
[01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:32.990]  But okay, if I'm analyzing it like that, well, yeah, if I start to notice people are
[01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:37.470]  dropping dead left and right and bleeding out of their eyes and ears, well, then okay,
[01:50:37.470 --> 01:50:40.550]  there's a rational reason now to have concern.
[01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:43.550]  Now, am I going to run up and get a vaccine?
[01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:45.350]  Boy, that's a whole nother story.
[01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:50.910]  But these psychotic murderers that run our planet, of course, they would release a deadly
[01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:56.070]  virus and then actually give you the vaccine to save you with the little trap door, with
[01:50:56.150 --> 01:51:02.390]  the little secret of, oh, you're now allergic to beef, now you can't eat beef anymore, oh,
[01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:08.310]  what a sad, what a shame, oh, sure, we promoted that that's exactly what we wanted, it's just,
[01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:11.790]  what a coincidence.
[01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:16.230]  Disease X, so they've got to come up with something really scary.
[01:51:16.230 --> 01:51:20.030]  And my guess is the reason why they're going with X is just because you're searching for
[01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:23.550]  X because of the whole Twitter rebrand, so they just want to find a way to jack into
[01:51:23.550 --> 01:51:27.390]  that algorithm.
[01:51:27.390 --> 01:51:33.230]  So but it's all about fear mongering, it's all about jacking into the algorithm.
[01:51:33.230 --> 01:51:36.070]  And it's all about messing with your mind.
[01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:38.870]  It's all about messing with your mind.
[01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:41.230]  But see, the fear mongering has already happened.
[01:51:41.230 --> 01:51:47.710]  Here's UK scientists talking about disease X in clip nine.
[01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:52.750]  In some of the most secure labs in the country, scientists are already preparing for the next
[01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:53.750]  pandemic.
[01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:59.510]  It's just called disease X for now, because nobody knows for sure which virus will cause
[01:51:59.510 --> 01:52:00.510]  it.
[01:52:00.510 --> 01:52:05.110]  But at its port and down complex, the UK Health Security Agency is scanning the horizon for
[01:52:05.110 --> 01:52:06.110]  threats.
[01:52:06.110 --> 01:52:08.550]  Pause it here.
[01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:13.470]  This whole thing, folks, is so retardville, I'm sorry.
[01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:15.310]  But really, that's what it is.
[01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:19.390]  This is jackassery in its purest form.
[01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:26.750]  You talk to any scientist, any doctor, anybody in that field at all with any experience.
[01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:31.350]  You can sit in a lab and you can jack around with viruses, all you're going to do is cause
[01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:33.430]  the next pandemic.
[01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:35.390]  You're not going to stop anything.
[01:52:35.390 --> 01:52:39.470]  It is these folks.
[01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:47.630]  This is like going into a lab and saying, we're going to design a snowflake.
[01:52:47.630 --> 01:52:49.870]  And then we're going to find that snowflake in nature.
[01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:52.630]  Do you know what the odds of that are?
[01:52:52.630 --> 01:52:58.670]  You could do a gajillion snowflake designs and then try to go find that snowflake in
[01:52:58.670 --> 01:53:03.390]  nature and you'll never find it.
[01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:05.350]  Because that's what this is like.
[01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:10.150]  Viruses are constantly mutating and mutating and mutating and mutating and changing and
[01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:13.030]  changing and changing.
[01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:15.350]  It's the same thing they do with the flu virus.
[01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:25.030]  They give you a flu vaccine for a virus that is already years mutated, meaning it's a worthless
[01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:26.030]  vaccine.
[01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:27.030]  And they know it.
[01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:28.030]  The scientists know it.
[01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:29.030]  And they're doing the same thing.
[01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:30.630]  Oh, we got this next pandemic.
[01:53:30.630 --> 01:53:31.990]  We'll have a vaccine ready.
[01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:34.910]  No, you won't.
[01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:36.990]  We know what the next snowflake is going to look like.
[01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:38.710]  We've been designing snowflakes for years.
[01:53:38.710 --> 01:53:40.710]  No, you don't.
[01:53:40.750 --> 01:53:48.230]  The odds are impossible, impossible.
[01:53:48.230 --> 01:53:49.390]  And then what ends up happening?
[01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:51.270]  They release the virus.
[01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:55.670]  They make the virus to make the vaccine and then they make the virus and it causes the
[01:53:55.670 --> 01:54:02.270]  pandemic and then they can't have a vaccine because the virus mutates.
[01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:06.230]  That is such clown jackassery.
[01:54:06.230 --> 01:54:08.230]  But so, OK, that's enough of that.
[01:54:08.230 --> 01:54:12.910]  Then they got to have you scared of the climate.
[01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:17.830]  You know, I think this is kind of a I think this is kind of the underdog here.
[01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:21.950]  I think.
[01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:25.750]  I mean, depending on how much they can manipulate the weather, depending on how much they have
[01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:29.590]  it down to an exact science.
[01:54:29.590 --> 01:54:34.830]  I mean, obviously, we know that they can do long term things and they can cloud seed and
[01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:38.150]  spray stuff into the atmosphere and that that has an effect.
[01:54:38.150 --> 01:54:41.390]  As far as I know and can tell, I don't think they've mastered it yet.
[01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:44.070]  I think it's probably might be even too difficult.
[01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:48.830]  We might not have the technology or the capacity, but they are doing it and they are measuring
[01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:49.830]  it.
[01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:51.630]  I follow the Texas weather modification program.
[01:54:51.630 --> 01:54:55.390]  I mean, they're you know, they at least pretend to be transparent with everything they're
[01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:56.390]  doing.
[01:54:56.390 --> 01:55:03.630]  No, I think the I think the dark horse here is weather weapons and just making and trying
[01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:08.150]  to create weather events that are just so insane and just one on top of the next that
[01:55:08.150 --> 01:55:12.550]  they're just going to really force the climate change thing down your throat.
[01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:15.030]  And they'll hype it all up to they'll hype it up.
[01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:18.870]  They'll make sure you see it all on the news and they'll do red breaking news, red alerts
[01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:21.710]  and everything, just like they did with the pandemic.
[01:55:21.710 --> 01:55:26.750]  PBS rolls out climate psychology therapist for Armageddon coping session.
[01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:30.270]  Guys, give me the short version here of clip one.
[01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:34.030]  Cases of Americans and how climate change is affecting their feelings.
[01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:36.990]  Leslie Davenport is a climate psychology therapist.
[01:55:36.990 --> 01:55:41.830]  She teaches at the California Institute of Integral Studies and is author of Emotional
[01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:44.510]  Resiliency in the Era of Climate Change.
[01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:45.510]  They're all basket cases.
[01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:51.310]  They're all not healthy concern about the planet, about climate change, become this
[01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:53.030]  sort of climate anxiety.
[01:55:53.030 --> 01:56:00.230]  Well, from the emerging field of climate psychology, one thing that's really important to understand
[01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:07.950]  is we view distress, upset, sadness, grief, anger about climate change to be a really
[01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:09.990]  reasonable, even healthy.
[01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:14.150]  And then they show you forest fires that have been going on forever built into us as
[01:56:14.150 --> 01:56:15.510]  flooding going on forever.
[01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:18.750]  We feel risks, threats, experience losses.
[01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:20.150]  There's going to be upset.
[01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:26.510]  So it's really important to acknowledge that if you're feeling that on any level of
[01:56:26.510 --> 01:56:29.830]  intensity, it really means you're paying attention.
[01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:33.790]  You care. You're paying attention to an emerging field.
[01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:37.910]  I mean, this is hilarious. Yeah, there's an emerging field for transgender kid surgeons,
[01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:45.150]  too. Yeah, there's an emerging field for climate, what is it?
[01:56:45.150 --> 01:56:47.550]  Climate psychology therapist.
[01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:53.670]  For climate, if you're suffering from climate anxiety, which, of course, is just you falling
[01:56:53.670 --> 01:56:57.430]  for the propaganda. And I mean.
[01:56:58.870 --> 01:57:04.070]  The odds of you dying from a weather event, some extreme weather event, flooding, whatever,
[01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:09.550]  have decreased so significantly in the last 100 years, 500 years, I mean, it's just
[01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:16.990]  ludicrous. So but they have to instill that fear, they have to bring that fear back.
[01:57:16.990 --> 01:57:18.870]  So, yeah, would they use a weather weapon to do that?
[01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:21.150]  Probably. Absolutely.
[01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:22.830]  If they have the capability.
[01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:34.630]  I mean, good luck, climate psychology therapist, ladies and gentlemen, and the liberals
[01:57:34.630 --> 01:57:39.510]  love it. But see, the funny thing is, in a weird way, this is actually the left and
[01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:40.910]  they've done this in other manners, too.
[01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:45.510]  They're actually admitting, yes, we liberals have a significant mental disorder.
[01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:46.110]  We need help.
[01:57:46.110 --> 01:57:55.070]  I beg you to think about how important your word of mouth is and you sharing the

[01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.550]  sell out.
[01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:56.190]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:58.990 --> 01:59:59.950]  Let's take Alex Jones.
[02:00:00.750 --> 02:00:02.590]  You don't have to agree with everything Alex Jones says.
[02:00:02.710 --> 02:00:06.310]  I like Alex Jones, but I don't, I don't agree with everything Alex Jones says and
[02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.990]  you don't have to.
[02:00:07.590 --> 02:00:12.270]  But Bill Maher famously and credit to him said when Alex Jones got banned, he said
[02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:13.190]  we shouldn't be banning people.
[02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:15.910]  He said, I hate Alex Jones, but Alex Jones should be allowed to talk.
[02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:17.670]  Everyone should be allowed to talk in the town square.
[02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:24.870]  Alex Jones, who is not my friend and who tells crazy lies about me, is thrown off
[02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:27.750]  Twitter, I think, and Facebook and a few other platforms.
[02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:28.430]  I think he's going to.
[02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:33.230]  Thank God, Senator, thank God.
[02:00:33.630 --> 02:00:35.590]  If you're a liberal, you're supposed to be for free speech.
[02:00:35.630 --> 02:00:37.710]  That's free speech for the speech you hate.
[02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:39.590]  That's what free speech means.
[02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:43.670]  We're losing the thread of the concepts that are important to this country.
[02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:46.430]  If you care about the real American or you don't.
[02:00:46.710 --> 02:00:48.550]  And if you do, it goes for every side.
[02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:52.550]  I don't like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak.
[02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:53.910]  Everybody gets to speak.
[02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:59.550]  That that's where we all need to be.
[02:00:59.950 --> 02:01:02.150]  Reactions really incredible there.
[02:01:02.190 --> 02:01:02.510]  Yeah.
[02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:06.590]  Cheering for him being banned and not a not a single clap for him saying free speech
[02:01:06.590 --> 02:01:07.350]  should be corrected.
[02:01:07.630 --> 02:01:08.110]  Correct.
[02:01:08.150 --> 02:01:12.390]  I think they kind of felt maybe hopefully they were a little ashamed of themselves
[02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:13.550]  going, oh, yeah, crap.
[02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:14.070]  You're right.
[02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:16.590]  But look at the automatic response.
[02:01:16.590 --> 02:01:19.230]  Yeah, we shut him down.
[02:01:20.230 --> 02:01:23.150]  I feel like when they got Alex Jones, there was no safety net.
[02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:26.950]  He is a warrior and he continued fighting and now he's back in the mainstream.
[02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:27.470]  Good for him.
[02:01:27.710 --> 02:01:32.190]  But he was renegaded to his own site with his own servers streaming every day to
[02:01:32.190 --> 02:01:35.950]  small audiences after they asked him off YouTube cancellation.
[02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:37.070]  No one defended him.
[02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:37.430]  No one.
[02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:40.910]  I was on vacation that day and I was fishing out of the country.
[02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:45.110]  And the company that I worked for, which is supposedly in favor of free speech,
[02:01:45.110 --> 02:01:47.070]  said not one word in his defense.
[02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:49.150]  And it's like, first they came for Alex Jones.
[02:01:49.150 --> 02:01:50.590]  I didn't care because I was Alex Jones.
[02:01:50.590 --> 02:01:52.430]  Yeah, it's the old, it's the old adage.
[02:01:52.630 --> 02:01:53.870]  What did you think of Alex Jones?
[02:01:54.230 --> 02:01:55.030]  Loved him to death.
[02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:56.590]  I still talk to him to this day.
[02:01:56.590 --> 02:01:57.390]  I think that he's great.
[02:01:57.430 --> 02:02:03.630]  And I think that many more people should have been vocal when he was initially
[02:02:03.630 --> 02:02:05.550]  banned, because I was actually there.
[02:02:05.550 --> 02:02:07.270]  I was on a fishing trip that day.
[02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:11.590]  Yeah, I was in Labrador and I've regretted it ever since that I didn't come out of
[02:02:11.590 --> 02:02:12.030]  the box.
[02:02:12.070 --> 02:02:12.870]  I wasn't there.
[02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:13.910]  I was off the air.
[02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:15.550]  But, um, I completely agree.
[02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:17.190]  It was, it was not even about Alex Jones.
[02:02:17.190 --> 02:02:19.910]  It's about, you can't censor people, period.
[02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.790]  Exactly.
[02:02:20.790 --> 02:02:23.070]  And Tucker, I remember the exact day when he got censored.
[02:02:23.070 --> 02:02:27.230]  I woke up and I looked on my phone and it said, Alex Jones banned from YouTube,
[02:02:27.230 --> 02:02:28.910]  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.
[02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:30.030]  He was banned everywhere.
[02:02:30.030 --> 02:02:33.430]  It was a mass banning, mass censorship effort to silence him.
[02:02:33.670 --> 02:02:38.270]  And again, I really didn't have an introduction into politics, but I had
[02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:42.550]  learned a lot of, you know, things from Alex Jones up front and everything that
[02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:44.270]  he was telling me was not false.
[02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:47.590]  The people who condemn him and say that he's a crazy conspiracy theorist do not
[02:02:47.590 --> 02:02:50.550]  listen to his show every single day because I worked for him for two and a
[02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.950]  half years.
[02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:53.830]  I didn't know the three branches of government when I started.
[02:02:53.950 --> 02:02:58.390]  Now I can tell you international policy and what's going on all over the world
[02:02:58.390 --> 02:03:01.390]  right now, because I have listened to Alex and he's talked about, you know,
[02:03:01.390 --> 02:03:04.750]  the government corruption historically that we've been through all of the
[02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:09.110]  different operations such as Operation Mockingbird, Operation Paperclip, a lot
[02:03:09.110 --> 02:03:09.590]  of these things.
[02:03:09.590 --> 02:03:12.510]  It's a skeggy experiment, which is why, you know, the black community is so
[02:03:12.510 --> 02:03:15.510]  apprehensive for vaccinations in the modern day.
[02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:18.950]  He talks about a lot of these things and our government doesn't like that.
[02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:20.750]  Our government doesn't like being exposed.
[02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:23.430]  They don't like people who are willing to tell the truth and people who are
[02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:25.190]  willing to push back against the narrative.
[02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:29.030]  Look at the fact that the DHS just updated their bulletin to say, Hey, if
[02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:32.590]  you're spreading the distrust in the government, that could be considered
[02:03:32.590 --> 02:03:33.550]  terrorism.
[02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:38.110]  I don't think so, but I just, I couldn't of course agree with you more, but I
[02:03:38.110 --> 02:03:40.310]  just, I'm fascinated by the hate for Alex Jones.
[02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:42.350]  I'm not a daily Alex Jones viewer.
[02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:46.470]  I don't view anything regularly actually, but, um, I think Alex Jones seems really
[02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:47.110]  talented.
[02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:48.190]  He's smart.
[02:03:48.190 --> 02:03:49.750]  He's funny as hell.
[02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:50.830]  It's truly funny.
[02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:54.510]  He's a lot more talented than I am in a lot of ways that that's my takeaway from
[02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:57.230]  Alex Jones, but why is he such a threat?
[02:03:57.230 --> 02:03:58.790]  Like, why would you hate Alex Jones?
[02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:59.870]  I've never understood that
[02:03:59.950 --> 02:04:01.430]  because he's telling the truth, Tucker.
[02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:04.790]  And again, I know Alex personally, and I've met a lot of people in this
[02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:08.470]  industry, and one of my biggest takeaways is that there are a lot of people,
[02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:11.670]  especially in conservative media that are in this for money and fame.
[02:04:11.670 --> 02:04:14.470]  They don't actually care about this country and they don't actually care
[02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:15.070]  about America.
[02:04:15.070 --> 02:04:16.430]  They're scared about being censored.
[02:04:16.510 --> 02:04:19.590]  They're scared about, you know, hurting the wrong people's feelings, not getting
[02:04:19.590 --> 02:04:20.510]  the proper endorsement.
[02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:21.830]  Alex doesn't care about any of that.
[02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:22.910]  Alex cares about the truth.
[02:04:23.110 --> 02:04:26.670]  He has since day one, he has made mistakes for sure, but he comes out, he
[02:04:26.670 --> 02:04:29.950]  apologizes for it and he corrects the record, which is something that many
[02:04:29.950 --> 02:04:31.830]  people in our media refuse to do.
[02:04:31.950 --> 02:04:36.070]  So the people who hate Alex Jones hate him because he is everything that they
[02:04:36.070 --> 02:04:36.910]  wish that they could be.
[02:04:36.910 --> 02:04:40.470]  Somebody who willing is willing to tell the truth, willing to fight for this
[02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:44.270]  country, and actually cares about humanity, not just America, but humanity
[02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.790]  as a whole.
[02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:48.750]  Now, thanks to people like Alex Jones, who took the initial brunt of the
[02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:50.150]  weapon, the cancellation weapon.
[02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:53.670]  Now there are lots of different platforms, lots of different apps, lots of
[02:04:53.670 --> 02:04:54.630]  different applications.
[02:04:54.630 --> 02:04:57.790]  I mean, Elon's taken over Twitter, which was a mainstream app, which
[02:04:57.790 --> 02:04:58.390]  censored people.
[02:04:58.710 --> 02:05:02.590]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of
[02:05:02.590 --> 02:05:04.390]  ourselves and the big event coming up.
[02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:09.310]  Well, yeah, let's, the first one, you obviously can go to my pillow.com, use
[02:05:09.310 --> 02:05:13.870]  that promo code Alex, and you can get all these great discounts on all of our
[02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:14.350]  products.
[02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:18.990]  And just by visiting this site, you're going to get a $20 free gift emailed to
[02:05:18.990 --> 02:05:19.990]  you immediately.
[02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:23.910]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20 year anniversary, my
[02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:28.990]  pillow for 1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[02:05:29.190 --> 02:05:33.270]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing best,
[02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:35.790]  producing and making the my pillow.
[02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:41.950]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how, using the money
[02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:45.430]  for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:46.750]  That's what the debanking is about.
[02:05:46.990 --> 02:05:48.630]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:52.990]  That's why we've got a rush to support my pillow.com and info wars.com.
[02:05:52.990 --> 02:05:56.270]  Plus they're great products at both places because we are the tip of the
[02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:56.550]  spear.
[02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.990]  You found it.
[02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:09.910]  The tip of the spear.
[02:06:10.230 --> 02:06:15.190]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:30.630]  Joining me now is Jeremy Nell, the website germwarfare.com.
[02:06:30.630 --> 02:06:36.430]  And Jeremy is out of South Africa where he is a famed cartoonist and
[02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:42.390]  broadcaster and constantly has the cancel culture left coming after him.
[02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:44.550]  He joins me now.
[02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:49.510]  Jeremy, a lot of stuff is developing in South Africa right now when it comes to
[02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:50.230]  the Western media.
[02:06:50.230 --> 02:06:56.310]  One thing we're watching is the leadership there, the black leadership having
[02:06:56.310 --> 02:07:02.190]  massive rallies, celebrating and promoting the murder genocide of white
[02:07:02.190 --> 02:07:02.630]  people.
[02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:06.070]  And while, of course, we do have an independent media here is covering this.
[02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:08.510]  It's barely got much attention.
[02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:12.350]  The UN kind of made a little bit of a peep, but but barely loudly enough for
[02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:13.230]  most people to hear.
[02:07:13.630 --> 02:07:16.350]  And I think the story, though, hasn't really been told.
[02:07:17.110 --> 02:07:22.270]  I saw a procession of a funeral of one of the white farmers that recently got
[02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:27.470]  murdered and they were driving down the road and there was a cross, a white cross
[02:07:27.470 --> 02:07:31.030]  on each side of the road for each farmer that had been murdered in this.
[02:07:31.030 --> 02:07:33.430]  I mean, really genocide, apartheid, whatever you want to call it.
[02:07:34.150 --> 02:07:35.190]  And it was for miles.
[02:07:35.190 --> 02:07:36.070]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:37.670]  What is the real story here?
[02:07:37.670 --> 02:07:41.990]  We've we've recently been focusing on it, given the rally, the the murder, white
[02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:44.510]  people rally and then right after that, white farmers getting murdered.
[02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:46.590]  But but this has really been going on for a while.
[02:07:46.590 --> 02:07:49.510]  What is the real story here from South Africa, Jeremy?
[02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:57.950]  And it's a complicated set of events, I think you'd need to break it down a
[02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:58.470]  little bit.
[02:07:58.590 --> 02:08:04.430]  OK, so we've got to go back just for contextualization purposes.
[02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:08.950]  You must understand that this particular song goes all the way back to the
[02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:17.150]  apartheid days when black ANC supporters were singing the song and it came out of
[02:08:17.150 --> 02:08:23.550]  the ANC's military wing known as Unkuntu Wesizwe and it was, you know, and in
[02:08:23.550 --> 02:08:24.910]  those days it was a struggle song.
[02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:32.550]  The song continued post-apartheid, which didn't really make that much more sense,
[02:08:32.590 --> 02:08:43.630]  but it became this this device to present a particular type of narrative and it was
[02:08:43.630 --> 02:08:47.110]  used by the more militant types going forward.
[02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:56.070]  Now, in, I think it was 2011, the high court in Johannesburg ruled that the song
[02:08:56.070 --> 02:09:00.230]  is hate speech because it's a clear incitement to violence.
[02:09:00.270 --> 02:09:02.430]  The lyrics are kill the Boer, kill the farmer.
[02:09:02.430 --> 02:09:10.390]  Now Boer is Afrikaans for farmer, but the word Boer is very, it's very dark.
[02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:12.150]  It's very, what's the word I'm looking for?
[02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:15.870]  It means white person, essentially.
[02:09:16.150 --> 02:09:19.270]  It's used with a capital B, not just a lowercase B.
[02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:25.150]  So it's got a very, very defined target.
[02:09:25.950 --> 02:09:30.310]  So the real translation for people to understand the Boer is a white South
[02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:31.110]  African farmer.
[02:09:33.710 --> 02:09:40.670]  Yes, technically, but by extension, it means white person because the metaphor is
[02:09:40.670 --> 02:09:45.950]  about, oh, I don't know, white oppression of black people.
[02:09:46.270 --> 02:09:48.990]  So it's, it's got, it's quite loaded, if that makes sense.
[02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:50.230]  Okay.
[02:09:50.230 --> 02:09:52.950]  So I think 2011, it was found to be hate speech.
[02:09:52.990 --> 02:10:00.150]  It was then challenged by, I think at that stage it was either the ANC or the other
[02:10:00.150 --> 02:10:03.750]  political party, which is the EFF, and we'll get to them in a second because that's
[02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:06.190]  where this big story has come from.
[02:10:06.750 --> 02:10:13.430]  And it was then taken to, I believe the Supreme Court and they said it's not hate
[02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.790]  speech.
[02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:19.630]  And this was in 2012 and they said that it would only be deemed hate speech under very
[02:10:19.630 --> 02:10:21.510]  specific circumstances.
[02:10:21.590 --> 02:10:27.590]  In other words, if it really is not being, not being used as a metaphor, which is
[02:10:27.590 --> 02:10:28.150]  ridiculous.
[02:10:28.190 --> 02:10:33.030]  I mean, how do you, how do you get away with saying something like kill the Boer,
[02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:33.790]  kill the farmer?
[02:10:33.790 --> 02:10:37.030]  And you go, well, it's, you know, it's not literal, particularly when you know, in
[02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:39.710]  South Africa, there are a lot of farmer attacks.
[02:10:40.110 --> 02:10:48.350]  Since a week ago, when that song was sung in the Johannesburg stadium of about 100,000
[02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:49.030]  people, right?
[02:10:49.190 --> 02:10:54.030]  100,000 black supporters of the EFF, which is now the third largest political party in
[02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:56.350]  the country, singing kill the Boer, kill the farmer.
[02:10:57.230 --> 02:11:02.230]  In the week that followed about, I believe nine farmer attacks occurred and of the nine
[02:11:02.230 --> 02:11:05.990]  farmer attacks around two, I think, ended in murder.
[02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.910]  All right.
[02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:09.230]  That's now in the last seven days or so.
[02:11:10.150 --> 02:11:13.430]  Now they go, well, it's, it's not literal.
[02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:15.270]  Those farmer attacks are just coincidental.
[02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:16.150]  You can't prove it.
[02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:22.110]  I ask you with tears in my eyes, where is this leading?
[02:11:22.150 --> 02:11:23.230]  What is the end game?
[02:11:23.230 --> 02:11:27.510]  How can you push so hard for a song that is so divisive?
[02:11:27.950 --> 02:11:29.230]  It is so aggressive.
[02:11:29.230 --> 02:11:33.630]  It is so, it is just so vile.
[02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:36.630]  It doesn't lead anywhere positive.
[02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:41.750]  And even though you can try and ban it, you still got this mindset.
[02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:44.390]  It's a, there seems to be this type of cultural hatred.
[02:11:45.190 --> 02:11:47.430]  And oh, and yes, I think it gets really tricky.
[02:11:48.750 --> 02:11:50.750]  I don't know if it's entirely organic.
[02:11:50.830 --> 02:11:55.630]  I have a feeling that, that there is foreign, there's foreign funding and
[02:11:55.630 --> 02:11:56.990]  there's foreign influence.
[02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:58.150]  I cannot prove it yet.
[02:11:58.150 --> 02:12:01.750]  It's difficult to know because they don't disclose who their funders are.
[02:12:02.230 --> 02:12:07.910]  Funnily enough though, if you go onto Twitter and you go onto Julius Malema,
[02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:13.710]  who's the leader of this party, we just saw in the visuals there, he, he put
[02:12:13.710 --> 02:12:17.910]  out a tweet a few years ago saying that he's very proud to say that some of
[02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:21.390]  their largest funders are, are their Jewish based.
[02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:23.310]  Now I'm not saying anything about Jews.
[02:12:23.310 --> 02:12:27.190]  I'm not, that's not what I'm saying, but that was the only time that I can
[02:12:27.190 --> 02:12:33.110]  think of publicly where he's stated that, that they have, or who their funders are.
[02:12:33.590 --> 02:12:36.270]  Another funder might be Soros.
[02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:39.870]  I suspect that George Soros is behind some of, some of the antics.
[02:12:40.070 --> 02:12:43.390]  I don't know, but there is lots of speculation that there
[02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:46.150]  could be international funding.
[02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:52.870]  And I don't believe for one moment that that performance that they put on at that
[02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:57.270]  stadium that we just saw there in those visuals was funded organically.
[02:12:57.670 --> 02:13:00.870]  There's not, they don't have enough support to, to fund that.
[02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:04.630]  Well, you know, it's funny that you say that because I'm watching this and I'm thinking,
[02:13:05.790 --> 02:13:09.830]  and I probably need a little more context from you here, but this is where you're going.
[02:13:10.350 --> 02:13:11.350]  I want to lean into this.
[02:13:11.390 --> 02:13:12.350]  I'm sitting here, I'm watching this.
[02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:12.550]  Okay.
[02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:15.510]  This is a big stadium, well attended event.
[02:13:16.230 --> 02:13:20.230]  And this isn't something that is not well organized or well funded.
[02:13:20.230 --> 02:13:25.390]  I mean, you can see that with the presentation, this is really well organized, really well
[02:13:25.390 --> 02:13:25.910]  funded.
[02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:26.110]  Yeah.
[02:13:26.790 --> 02:13:29.870]  And, and it kind of leads me to my next question, which would be what is the origins of
[02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:30.590]  the EFF?
[02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:35.870]  But, but I guess it would be, is this, does this seem like it's kind of gone next level?
[02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:39.190]  Like, whoa, they kind of, maybe it used to have rallies like this, but now they're in
[02:13:39.190 --> 02:13:43.790]  gigantic arenas, this fantastic presentation and everything like somebody's bankrolling
[02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:44.230]  this now.
[02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:48.310]  Exactly.
[02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:50.750]  And it's, as I said, it's very difficult to know.
[02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:52.870]  Now, let me just do my math quickly.
[02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:57.910]  I think that the, the cost of that event, so that works out to about 150 million Rand.
[02:13:57.910 --> 02:13:58.310]  What is that?
[02:13:58.310 --> 02:14:02.070]  So divided by about 18 or something, you can, you can do the maths, but that's what it
[02:14:02.070 --> 02:14:02.990]  would be in US dollars.
[02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:04.030]  It's a lot of money.
[02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:09.750]  Uh, and, um, and it was unbelievably impressive.
[02:14:09.790 --> 02:14:10.150]  Okay.
[02:14:10.230 --> 02:14:14.710]  Ignore the politics for now, just a political performance like that, that is on the scale
[02:14:14.710 --> 02:14:18.110]  of what Barack Obama was doing, you know?
[02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:24.830]  And, um, and it's, it's theatrics and it just caught everybody out of the blue.
[02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:30.550]  Now, I suspect that a lot of those people that went there were coaxed into going there,
[02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:34.590]  you know, with free food, free this, free that, and they didn't know that they were
[02:14:34.590 --> 02:14:36.190]  going to necessarily be singing the song.
[02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:43.430]  But something to note about, um, Julius Malema, who's the leader, he also makes, I
[02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:48.590]  believe the party very fragile because it's sort of like a North Korean type setup where
[02:14:48.590 --> 02:14:53.190]  the party is very much, very much, uh, driven around him.
[02:14:53.190 --> 02:14:55.150]  It's like a personality cult of sorts.
[02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:58.350]  If he is no longer there, I think the party collapses.
[02:14:58.670 --> 02:15:04.070]  And then just for context, the size of the party in the South African, um, election is
[02:15:04.070 --> 02:15:06.150]  about somewhere between 12 and 15%.
[02:15:06.630 --> 02:15:07.550]  That's not very big.
[02:15:07.870 --> 02:15:13.670]  So as you can clearly see what you saw there that happened at that, at that stadium to what
[02:15:13.670 --> 02:15:19.590]  they're actually worth in the, you know, in terms of the, the, the, uh, the voting sector,
[02:15:19.870 --> 02:15:21.590]  there's a big, there's a big discrepancy.
[02:15:21.590 --> 02:15:21.790]  All right.
[02:15:21.790 --> 02:15:23.350]  So, so we're about to hit a break here.
[02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:24.830]  We're about to hit a break here.
[02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:29.990]  And I think, cause the analogy is like, if, if South African politics were like, imagine
[02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:36.950]  in a, imagine a airport and you've got airplanes coming in and all the airports, all the, you
[02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:42.110]  know, typical airports, Boeing 747, all the South African political parties coming
[02:15:42.110 --> 02:15:42.230]  in.
[02:15:42.230 --> 02:15:46.150]  And then usually the EFF would come in with kind of the most ragged down plane.
[02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:48.310]  Well, now they just landed in a spaceship.
[02:15:48.990 --> 02:15:50.110]  You're like, what the heck?
[02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.430]  Yeah.
[02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:51.470]  When did this happen?
[02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:54.630]  So we'll lean into this with our guest, Jeremy Nell.
[02:15:54.630 --> 02:15:55.190]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:15:58.350 --> 02:16:02.350]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional
[02:16:02.350 --> 02:16:07.710]  needs. With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get
[02:16:07.710 --> 02:16:12.230]  all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[02:16:12.710 --> 02:16:17.310]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula.
[02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:22.350]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, vitamin mineral fusion
[02:16:22.350 --> 02:16:27.070]  uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it
[02:16:27.070 --> 02:16:28.670]  needs to support your body.
[02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:33.310]  Using a proprietary process, we've managed to make this powerhouse formula into a
[02:16:33.310 --> 02:16:37.750]  delicious, concentrated drink mix that's loaded with high quality ingredients.
[02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:40.710]  Perfect for a hot summer day or relaxing at home.

[02:16:45.550 --> 02:16:46.470]  acids and more.

[02:16:56.990 --> 02:17:04.550]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, and they've got our
[02:17:04.550 --> 02:17:06.230]  children drinking that.
[02:17:06.430 --> 02:17:12.110]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[02:17:12.270 --> 02:17:17.030]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour group.
[02:17:17.230 --> 02:17:20.310]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[02:17:20.550 --> 02:17:24.910]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out
[02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:29.950]  there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:33.150]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[02:17:33.350 --> 02:17:34.750]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:37.350]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:17:37.630 --> 02:17:42.030]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of a
[02:17:42.030 --> 02:17:47.750]  leading competitor. And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should
[02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:50.070]  filter your water. You should also filter your shower water.
[02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:51.470]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[02:17:51.470 --> 02:17:53.110]  But I'm done talking about that.
[02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:56.710]  The point is you get the filters at Infowarstore.com, they're discounted right now,
[02:17:56.950 --> 02:18:01.510]  finally back in stock. The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or
[02:18:01.510 --> 02:18:04.270]  the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[02:18:04.630 --> 02:18:09.590]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[02:18:09.590 --> 02:18:14.030]  industry to use. One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[02:18:14.390 --> 02:18:18.350]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is
[02:18:18.350 --> 02:18:23.070]  enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[02:18:23.390 --> 02:18:25.990]  Look it up. Don't let them do this to your family.
[02:18:25.990 --> 02:18:30.750]  We have the very best gravity fed filter system out there, highest rated at half the
[02:18:30.750 --> 02:18:32.230]  price of leading competitors.
[02:18:32.310 --> 02:18:34.710]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[02:18:34.710 --> 02:18:36.830]  We have replacement filters for folks who've already gotten it.
[02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:38.670]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:41.550]  It is amazing. It's great for your home, your business.
[02:18:41.550 --> 02:18:45.950]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water, almost everything's contaminated.
[02:18:46.110 --> 02:18:49.550]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist
[02:18:49.550 --> 02:18:52.710]  onslaught. Get yours today at Infowarstore.com for a limited time.

[02:18:55.350 --> 02:18:56.470]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[02:18:56.590 --> 02:18:57.390]  You need this filter.
[02:18:57.870 --> 02:19:00.310]  Infowars is a one of a kind operation.

[02:19:27.310 --> 02:19:29.150]  on the products. But these really are amazing products.
[02:19:29.390 --> 02:19:31.190]  The big July 4 sell is going on right now.
[02:19:31.470 --> 02:19:33.870]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:35.870]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[02:19:36.070 --> 02:19:37.190]  People are listening more than ever.
[02:19:37.430 --> 02:19:41.430]  But in this major recession going into depression and with supply chain breakdowns, I
[02:19:41.430 --> 02:19:43.430]  know it's hard. I know times are tough.
[02:19:43.470 --> 02:19:44.990]  So thank you for your support.
[02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:48.910]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos that
[02:19:48.910 --> 02:19:52.030]  you can do for free. And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:54.270]  So however, God leaves you in your heart to support us.
[02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:56.630]  Please support us now. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:19:57.150 --> 02:19:57.630]  God bless you.
[02:19:59.350 --> 02:20:03.630]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:05.590]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:07.090 --> 02:20:21.090]  So, trying to get some background information and then the true story about what's happening
[02:20:21.090 --> 02:20:26.730]  in South Africa right now, Jeremy Nell is with us, Germ, with a J, germwarfare.com is
[02:20:26.730 --> 02:20:27.730]  his website.
[02:20:27.730 --> 02:20:32.850]  And you were kind of getting into the phenomenon that the EFF has become in the last segment.
[02:20:32.850 --> 02:20:38.010]  And I left it off with the analogy that if South African politics was an airport and
[02:20:38.010 --> 02:20:43.170]  each party was an airplane landing, you'd see your typical airplanes landing like a
[02:20:43.170 --> 02:20:46.690]  Boeing 747 or anything else you see at the airport.
[02:20:46.690 --> 02:20:52.930]  And then normally the EFF, kind of the raggedy one, you know, maybe it's got a loose wing
[02:20:52.930 --> 02:20:54.930]  or whatever, kind of lands, looks a little raggedy.
[02:20:54.930 --> 02:20:57.770]  Well, now all of a sudden they just showed up in a spaceship.
[02:20:57.770 --> 02:21:01.970]  And that's what that event that we all saw where they're chanting to kill the Boers went
[02:21:01.970 --> 02:21:02.970]  so viral.
[02:21:02.970 --> 02:21:05.650]  And so you were getting into some skepticism there.
[02:21:05.650 --> 02:21:08.090]  Where is the money coming from?
[02:21:08.090 --> 02:21:11.010]  And maybe here's a good place to start it off.
[02:21:11.010 --> 02:21:16.570]  We know the Chinese have a vested interest in North Africa, and they're all over there
[02:21:16.570 --> 02:21:22.890]  trying to get themselves a little foothold in that region geopolitically.
[02:21:22.890 --> 02:21:26.650]  But you're thinking maybe something similar, except maybe not the Chinese is going on in
[02:21:26.650 --> 02:21:28.210]  South Africa.
[02:21:28.930 --> 02:21:33.210]  Yeah, I mean, that does come up quite a bit in conversation.
[02:21:33.210 --> 02:21:35.130]  It could be.
[02:21:35.130 --> 02:21:42.050]  I don't think, though, that the Chinese way is generally geared towards that type of subversion.
[02:21:42.050 --> 02:21:50.210]  They're more honest about their dealings, what we found at least on the African continent.
[02:21:50.210 --> 02:21:55.410]  If I were to get into a little bit of paranoia, deep state type stuff, I would think it is
[02:21:55.410 --> 02:22:01.290]  more Western-backed because, for example, Victoria Nuland was in South Africa just a
[02:22:01.290 --> 02:22:02.290]  few weeks ago.
[02:22:02.290 --> 02:22:06.490]  Wherever Victoria Nuland goes, we all know there's chaos.
[02:22:06.490 --> 02:22:13.010]  She's a warmonger, and I suspect that there could be some central intelligence involvement
[02:22:13.010 --> 02:22:14.650]  to destabilize South Africa.
[02:22:14.650 --> 02:22:22.970]  We do have good relationships with China and, of course, Russia because we're part of BRICS.
[02:22:22.970 --> 02:22:28.170]  As I said, I'm speculating, but I think that you could probably start drawing some connections
[02:22:28.170 --> 02:22:36.890]  between the general deep state West, NATO alliance countries, not wanting South Africa to get
[02:22:36.890 --> 02:22:43.690]  too friendly, particularly knowing what's going on with Putin and Ukraine.
[02:22:43.690 --> 02:22:49.570]  South Africa, for example, has been pushed into a position not to have Putin at the BRICS
[02:22:49.570 --> 02:22:54.450]  summit, which is coming up fairly soon.
[02:22:54.450 --> 02:22:58.490]  There's supposedly an international warrant for his arrest if he lands in South Africa,
[02:22:58.490 --> 02:23:01.690]  the irony being we're part of BRICS.
[02:23:01.690 --> 02:23:03.010]  It's very confusing.
[02:23:03.010 --> 02:23:07.530]  It's almost schizophrenic in terms of how we are supposed to handle this.
[02:23:07.530 --> 02:23:10.370]  Keep in mind, South Africa is not a very important country geopolitically.
[02:23:10.370 --> 02:23:14.210]  We aren't anything to offer the rest of the world.
[02:23:14.210 --> 02:23:17.970]  We're kind of just existing at the bottom of the continent.
[02:23:17.970 --> 02:23:23.930]  But because of our position, I think we will have importance later on for trade routes,
[02:23:23.930 --> 02:23:25.770]  hence us being part of BRICS.
[02:23:25.770 --> 02:23:33.650]  So I think, as I said, if I were to speculate, I would suspect that the potential destabilization
[02:23:33.650 --> 02:23:39.090]  efforts would be coming probably from the West, not really from the East.
[02:23:39.090 --> 02:23:46.010]  So if I'm hearing you right, we know that obviously the West is not thrilled about the momentum
[02:23:46.010 --> 02:23:50.850]  development of the BRICS system, which is, I guess, is it this week?
[02:23:50.850 --> 02:23:55.010]  There's going to be a big conference on BRICS that I guess they're trying to keep Putin away.
[02:23:55.010 --> 02:23:59.370]  And so the West is getting involved saying, hey, you know, don't forget about us here.
[02:23:59.370 --> 02:24:00.810]  We need a seat at the table.
[02:24:00.810 --> 02:24:04.370]  We're going to be we're going to be interested in these developments.
[02:24:04.370 --> 02:24:09.610]  And if things don't go our way, we're now funding this EFF party that we can really mess
[02:24:09.610 --> 02:24:13.690]  things up in your country if you want us to.
[02:24:13.690 --> 02:24:15.810]  Yes.
[02:24:15.810 --> 02:24:17.770]  I mean, it makes sense to me.
[02:24:17.770 --> 02:24:22.090]  But as I have to keep saying this, it's speculation because I could be wrong.
[02:24:22.090 --> 02:24:27.490]  But I mean, if we look at the patterns that tend to happen with countries that perhaps
[02:24:27.490 --> 02:24:34.810]  offer some sort of resistance to typical Washington bully tactics, I can't see this being something
[02:24:34.810 --> 02:24:37.930]  coming from a BRICS ally like China.
[02:24:37.930 --> 02:24:44.410]  I see it happening more, you know, more closely to Washington.
[02:24:44.410 --> 02:24:47.410]  And of course, we know that Washington is panicking.
[02:24:47.410 --> 02:24:49.570]  They don't like what's going on geopolitically.
[02:24:49.570 --> 02:24:53.530]  They don't like the fact that the unipolar world is starting to crumble.
[02:24:53.530 --> 02:24:58.090]  They don't like the fact that multipolarity is starting to emerge.
[02:24:58.090 --> 02:25:03.890]  BRICS countries are well, the BRICS concept is getting stronger.
[02:25:03.890 --> 02:25:10.330]  And South Africa is very vulnerable in the sense that we have a lot of racial tension
[02:25:10.330 --> 02:25:12.730]  and it's something that you can easily tap into.
[02:25:13.010 --> 02:25:17.450]  You just have to tap into South African history, apartheid, white and black, and push them
[02:25:17.450 --> 02:25:18.450]  against each other.
[02:25:18.450 --> 02:25:23.090]  Well, let's lean into that because, yeah, let's let's lean into that because it's well
[02:25:23.090 --> 02:25:24.090]  known.
[02:25:24.090 --> 02:25:27.610]  I mean, we could talk about the diamond trade in that industry.
[02:25:27.610 --> 02:25:30.490]  But the point being, it's been seen in the past.
[02:25:30.490 --> 02:25:34.810]  I mean, you can take these young groups and you'll have these militia groups, kind of
[02:25:34.810 --> 02:25:39.330]  berserker groups, and they'll go in and they'll raid villages and they'll take women and children.
[02:25:39.330 --> 02:25:44.370]  And then you'll basically have children armies and they find a way to get them guns.
[02:25:44.370 --> 02:25:48.650]  And so essentially what you could do with this EFF is say, hey, we can we can form a
[02:25:48.650 --> 02:25:50.010]  massive army of people.
[02:25:50.010 --> 02:25:51.410]  We can go into farmlands.
[02:25:51.410 --> 02:25:52.650]  We can go do whatever we want.
[02:25:52.650 --> 02:25:57.330]  I mean, that's what it kind of seems like if they can get control of this EFF group politically
[02:25:57.330 --> 02:26:02.570]  with their funding, then it's kind of a hedge against the BRICS is what it seems like where
[02:26:02.570 --> 02:26:04.290]  this is going.
[02:26:04.290 --> 02:26:05.970]  Yeah.
[02:26:05.970 --> 02:26:08.050]  And let me just add to that.
[02:26:08.050 --> 02:26:12.170]  South African farming is, it's immensely dangerous.
[02:26:12.170 --> 02:26:18.890]  So if you consider that our murder rate is around, I think it's around 40 per 100,000,
[02:26:18.890 --> 02:26:19.890]  which is very high.
[02:26:19.890 --> 02:26:23.730]  I think, you know, the average in Europe might be around three or four.
[02:26:23.730 --> 02:26:26.970]  And we're sitting at, you know, almost I think around 40.
[02:26:26.970 --> 02:26:29.890]  It could be higher, but let's just say 40.
[02:26:29.890 --> 02:26:36.610]  Now a farmer, which is an occupation, shoots all the way up to something like 400 or 450
[02:26:36.610 --> 02:26:37.730]  per 100,000.
[02:26:37.730 --> 02:26:40.450]  That is an incredible jump in terms of danger.
[02:26:40.450 --> 02:26:43.910]  I mean, it's more dangerous than being a policeman.
[02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:49.650]  So you need huge amounts of security if you're a South African farmer.
[02:26:49.650 --> 02:26:54.090]  And again, the overwhelming majority of South African farmers are white.
[02:26:54.090 --> 02:27:01.730]  So they, it automatically gets heavily skewed because the attackers are almost always black.
[02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:05.290]  It's difficult to know if it's random or if it's orchestrated.
[02:27:05.290 --> 02:27:12.010]  I seem to think that it's mostly orchestrated because the nature of the attacks are excessively
[02:27:12.010 --> 02:27:13.010]  violent.
[02:27:13.010 --> 02:27:16.570]  You just have to go and look at how violent these, how brutal they are.
[02:27:16.570 --> 02:27:21.290]  You know, a woman gets tied to a chair and then gets burnt to death with a gas torch,
[02:27:21.290 --> 02:27:25.530]  you know, and or they get violently raped or stabbed with a screwdriver.
[02:27:25.530 --> 02:27:30.010]  I mean, the stuff is, and often nothing gets stolen.
[02:27:30.010 --> 02:27:33.730]  So it's an act of absolute hatred.
[02:27:33.730 --> 02:27:37.050]  And where that is coming from, I don't know.
[02:27:37.050 --> 02:27:38.050]  Nobody seems to know.
[02:27:38.050 --> 02:27:39.050]  It's not known.
[02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:42.530]  Nobody wants to study it because it could end up being racist or something, I don't know,
[02:27:42.530 --> 02:27:43.530]  it's very politically incorrect.
[02:27:43.530 --> 02:27:44.530]  There's a history there.
[02:27:44.530 --> 02:27:48.690]  I mean, even Nelson Mandela's wife was doing the, when they put the tires around their necks
[02:27:48.690 --> 02:27:49.690]  and they burn it.
[02:27:49.690 --> 02:27:50.690]  I forget what they were calling that.
[02:27:51.090 --> 02:27:52.090]  I mean, this has been going on for a while.
[02:27:52.090 --> 02:27:53.090]  Necklacing.
[02:27:53.090 --> 02:27:54.090]  Necklacing.
[02:27:54.090 --> 02:27:55.090]  So these tensions, though, are not new.
[02:27:55.090 --> 02:27:56.090]  You're referring to Winnie.
[02:27:56.090 --> 02:27:57.090]  Yeah.
[02:27:57.090 --> 02:27:58.090]  Yeah.
[02:27:58.090 --> 02:28:13.570]  So it sounds like we have a little bit of a, sorry, we have a little bit of a sound
[02:28:13.570 --> 02:28:14.570]  delay here.
[02:28:14.570 --> 02:28:15.570]  Yeah.
[02:28:15.570 --> 02:28:16.570]  Yeah.
[02:28:16.570 --> 02:28:17.570]  I'll tell you what, we're up against a break.
[02:28:17.570 --> 02:28:18.570]  So just stay right there.
[02:28:18.570 --> 02:28:19.570]  Maybe we'll reconnect.
[02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:22.930]  Of course, our guest is in South Africa, so we're having a bit of a sound delay.
[02:28:22.930 --> 02:28:23.930]  It's no problem.
[02:28:23.930 --> 02:28:24.930]  We'll reconnect.
[02:28:24.930 --> 02:28:25.930]  We're about to go to a break anyway.
[02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:26.930]  Great conversation.
[02:28:26.930 --> 02:28:28.650]  Learning about what's going on in South Africa with Jeremy.

[02:31:55.570 --> 02:31:57.570]  and some brain force ultra.
[02:31:57.570 --> 02:32:02.570]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[02:32:02.570 --> 02:32:04.570]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[02:32:04.570 --> 02:32:06.570]  So let me get this straight.
[02:32:06.570 --> 02:32:10.570]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the
[02:32:10.570 --> 02:32:14.570]  Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son, Hunter, to
[02:32:14.570 --> 02:32:18.570]  force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an event
[02:32:18.570 --> 02:32:22.570]  that Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment, enforcing the arming of
[02:32:22.570 --> 02:32:25.570]  Ukraine, in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[02:32:25.570 --> 02:32:30.570]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they
[02:32:30.570 --> 02:32:35.570]  swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign.
[02:32:36.570 --> 02:32:41.570]  All while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly
[02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:46.570]  letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016 when they were simultaneously launching
[02:32:46.570 --> 02:32:51.570]  the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton
[02:32:51.570 --> 02:32:52.570]  campaign.
[02:32:52.570 --> 02:32:53.570]  Do I have that all straight?
[02:32:59.570 --> 02:33:03.570]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:03.570 --> 02:33:05.570]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:07.390 --> 02:33:19.630]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[02:33:19.630 --> 02:33:20.630]  the InfoWar.
[02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:23.630]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:23.630 --> 02:33:35.830]  Jeremy Nell, our guest here on the Alex Jones Show, South African broadcaster, cartoonist,
[02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:37.470]  talking about the latest developments.
[02:33:37.470 --> 02:33:43.630]  But Jeremy, I guess what I'm trying to do here, and this is from my own understanding,
[02:33:43.630 --> 02:33:49.230]  how does this tie in to the history of race relations in South Africa?
[02:33:49.230 --> 02:33:50.349]  Were things getting better?
[02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:52.189]  Were things getting worse?
[02:33:52.189 --> 02:33:55.430]  Is it reaching a new head?
[02:33:55.430 --> 02:34:04.230]  I mean, how does it all tie in to the necklacing, to what we saw even just 10 years ago, apartheid,
[02:34:04.230 --> 02:34:05.230]  to where we're at now?
[02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:10.590]  And I think that historical understanding is important for people to grasp before we
[02:34:10.590 --> 02:34:12.990]  get into what's happening now geopolitically.
[02:34:12.990 --> 02:34:19.590]  So can you briefly kind of tie that all together and make sense of that for us?
[02:34:19.590 --> 02:34:24.310]  I think there is a disconnect between the media and reality, firstly.
[02:34:24.310 --> 02:34:27.590]  So the media will make it look worse than what it is.
[02:34:27.590 --> 02:34:29.210]  So there is good news.
[02:34:29.210 --> 02:34:33.269]  The good news is that, in my opinion, and from my perspective, race relations in South
[02:34:33.310 --> 02:34:38.869]  Africa are not nearly as bad as what the media would have you believe.
[02:34:38.869 --> 02:34:43.230]  The media wants you to think that white South Africans hate black South Africans and vice
[02:34:43.230 --> 02:34:44.910]  versa.
[02:34:44.910 --> 02:34:46.150]  That's only on the fringes.
[02:34:46.150 --> 02:34:51.869]  And I think in the main, race relations are generally fine, as long as the state doesn't
[02:34:51.869 --> 02:34:53.869]  interfere too much.
[02:34:53.869 --> 02:34:54.910]  And this is the problem.
[02:34:54.910 --> 02:35:00.310]  The state is interfering so much that it's always causing issues and problems and resistance
[02:35:00.310 --> 02:35:01.630]  and whatever else.
[02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:06.630]  For example, the EFF that you saw there in that footage, singing Kill the Boer, Kill
[02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:11.949]  the Farmer, they only represent about 12 to 15% of the national vote.
[02:35:11.949 --> 02:35:13.630]  That's not very big at all.
[02:35:13.630 --> 02:35:19.869]  So by virtue of the fact that they don't represent a huge amount of the vote, their supporters
[02:35:19.869 --> 02:35:24.189]  who tend to sing those songs are not that many.
[02:35:24.189 --> 02:35:27.590]  You could essentially say 15 out of every 100.
[02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:32.710]  Now that's still high, I suppose, by all accounts, but it's also not that high.
[02:35:32.710 --> 02:35:35.630]  My wife and I travel a lot around the country.
[02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:36.630]  We go away.
[02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:38.510]  We're always looking for beautiful places to stay.
[02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:44.590]  And we always have good interactions with all the different cultures and ethnicities, etc.
[02:35:44.590 --> 02:35:49.349]  We personally don't find that much animosity.
[02:35:49.349 --> 02:35:54.869]  However, whenever elections get close or where there's a big event like BRICS or something,
[02:35:55.109 --> 02:36:01.470]  suddenly these tensions flare up, almost as if they are being instigated.
[02:36:01.470 --> 02:36:03.869]  Because naturally, you don't see this kind of stuff.
[02:36:03.869 --> 02:36:10.269]  The last time this kind of song was sung on any big level was years ago.
[02:36:10.269 --> 02:36:12.510]  It's just not done for some reason.
[02:36:12.510 --> 02:36:16.670]  And I think it's because by and large, South Africans do want to get on with their own
[02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:23.210]  lives until they get triggered by some external force or something happening internally.
[02:36:23.210 --> 02:36:26.609]  We know that next year, there's a big election.
[02:36:26.609 --> 02:36:31.050]  And we know that the ANC, for example, are probably going to get their worst result
[02:36:31.050 --> 02:36:32.050]  to date.
[02:36:32.050 --> 02:36:37.010]  So, to answer your question in a very roundabout way, I think race relations in South Africa
[02:36:37.010 --> 02:36:43.529]  today are better than what they were, let's say, in the 1980s.
[02:36:43.529 --> 02:36:45.449]  They're not perfect.
[02:36:45.449 --> 02:36:50.609]  And they certainly, certainly have their scabs and those scabs can get ripped off quite easily.
[02:36:50.609 --> 02:36:58.210]  But I think by and large, in the main, race relations are probably okay, as long as everybody
[02:36:58.210 --> 02:36:59.769]  kind of just gets left alone.
[02:36:59.769 --> 02:37:06.810]  Well, and it would seem, with that information, that most of the propaganda is aimed at the
[02:37:06.810 --> 02:37:10.289]  Boers or the white farmers, as you have it.
[02:37:10.289 --> 02:37:16.449]  And that is why the violence, when it comes to race relations, is aimed at them as well.
[02:37:16.449 --> 02:37:18.529]  So what do you suppose is behind that?
[02:37:18.529 --> 02:37:19.769]  And how does it normally go?
[02:37:19.769 --> 02:37:25.330]  Because, I mean, I've seen the horror stories, you'll have a family of white farmers and
[02:37:25.330 --> 02:37:30.130]  basically black South Africans move in, kill them.
[02:37:30.130 --> 02:37:32.250]  And then I guess, but what is the idea?
[02:37:32.250 --> 02:37:35.970]  Is that they're going to take over the farm or it's just justice, kill whitey?
[02:37:35.970 --> 02:37:37.849]  Like what, what is the idea here?
[02:37:37.849 --> 02:37:40.769]  Why does this happen?
[02:37:40.769 --> 02:37:41.769]  I don't know.
[02:37:42.090 --> 02:37:49.050]  So there have been a lot of groups trying to look into what's going on.
[02:37:49.050 --> 02:37:54.250]  Some people suggest that it's random, but I think the general consensus is that it's
[02:37:54.250 --> 02:37:57.330]  not random and it is orchestrated.
[02:37:57.330 --> 02:38:01.410]  There is some sort of central intelligence that seems to push this out.
[02:38:01.410 --> 02:38:05.210]  Now, a moment ago, I said race relations are generally okay.
[02:38:05.210 --> 02:38:06.210]  That's fine.
[02:38:06.210 --> 02:38:07.210]  I'm talking about general city life.
[02:38:07.210 --> 02:38:10.369]  The moment you go out into the farmlands, it's different.
[02:38:10.369 --> 02:38:11.930]  Farmers are very vulnerable.
[02:38:11.930 --> 02:38:17.170]  They get attacked a lot, disproportionately higher than any other occupation.
[02:38:17.170 --> 02:38:21.010]  And as I said earlier on to you, it's exceptionally aggressive.
[02:38:21.010 --> 02:38:22.369]  It's very violent.
[02:38:22.369 --> 02:38:25.170]  A lot of the time they don't take over the farm.
[02:38:25.170 --> 02:38:28.930]  And that's a good reason for that because the guys who are attacking don't know how
[02:38:28.930 --> 02:38:29.930]  to run a farm.
[02:38:29.930 --> 02:38:32.369]  So the farm will just fall apart.
[02:38:32.369 --> 02:38:39.050]  I think what's going on is that it's just, it's intense intimidation and it's hatred
[02:38:39.810 --> 02:38:42.849]  and it's stemming from somewhere.
[02:38:42.849 --> 02:38:43.849]  That's somewhere I don't know.
[02:38:43.849 --> 02:38:45.650]  Lauren Southern has done a documentary on it.
[02:38:45.650 --> 02:38:47.289]  I highly recommend people go and watch that.
[02:38:47.289 --> 02:38:49.210]  I think it's on YouTube.
[02:38:49.210 --> 02:38:50.210]  And so is Katie Hopkins.
[02:38:50.210 --> 02:38:54.769]  Both of them have done two separate documentaries, extremely heart-wrenching.
[02:38:54.769 --> 02:38:56.529]  You're going to want to have tissues with you.
[02:38:56.529 --> 02:38:57.810]  It's not easy to watch.
[02:38:57.810 --> 02:39:02.289]  I know some of the people in those documentaries and their stories are true.
[02:39:02.289 --> 02:39:04.570]  It's very gruesome.
[02:39:04.570 --> 02:39:07.730]  It's not something that a normal person can understand.
[02:39:07.730 --> 02:39:10.810]  Why this happens, Owen, your guess is as good as mine.
[02:39:10.810 --> 02:39:11.810]  I don't know.
[02:39:11.810 --> 02:39:18.730]  Well, if I try to relate it to what we deal with in similar race relations here, what
[02:39:18.730 --> 02:39:28.289]  we have is political types that want to use the, let's say the scars of American history,
[02:39:28.289 --> 02:39:33.609]  mostly slavery, and they want to create this situation, this vacuum where they can use
[02:39:33.609 --> 02:39:37.449]  black people as a voting bloc, as a cultural bloc.
[02:39:37.449 --> 02:39:41.010]  And so now they'll say, well, we need to have reparations.
[02:39:41.010 --> 02:39:45.130]  You're entitled to reparations because of what happened 100 years ago or whatever in
[02:39:45.130 --> 02:39:46.130]  this country.
[02:39:46.130 --> 02:39:47.130]  So you're entitled to reparations.
[02:39:47.130 --> 02:39:49.490]  And then, and it's always left-leaning.
[02:39:49.490 --> 02:39:52.890]  It's a Democrat party here and it's always Democrats.
[02:39:52.890 --> 02:39:55.210]  And they'll say, yes, we need reparations.
[02:39:55.210 --> 02:39:56.849]  Give us the free money.
[02:39:56.849 --> 02:40:03.609]  So it sounds to me like the farmland is like their form of reparations.
[02:40:03.609 --> 02:40:07.050]  But like you said, it's not like a cash payment that they can put in their bank account.
[02:40:07.650 --> 02:40:08.650]  They kill the farmers.
[02:40:08.650 --> 02:40:09.650]  Now the land is there.
[02:40:09.650 --> 02:40:12.130]  Well, you don't know how to farm.
[02:40:12.130 --> 02:40:13.609]  So what happens next?
[02:40:13.609 --> 02:40:14.609]  It's a power struggle.
[02:40:14.609 --> 02:40:20.289]  Yeah, it's not really about, it's not really about money.
[02:40:20.289 --> 02:40:21.449]  It's about power.
[02:40:21.449 --> 02:40:29.090]  It's about, I have got an AK-47 and I've got some thugs with me and we are going to hurt
[02:40:29.090 --> 02:40:35.050]  you and your family simply because you are white and we are black and we have this history
[02:40:35.050 --> 02:40:36.050]  of oppression.
[02:40:36.050 --> 02:40:37.930]  I guess that would be the narrative.
[02:40:37.930 --> 02:40:41.570]  It's along the lines of Black Lives Matter or Antifa.
[02:40:41.570 --> 02:40:43.289]  It's all the same thing, Owen.
[02:40:43.289 --> 02:40:50.609]  It all falls into this kind of neo-Marxist class, this imaginary class struggle.
[02:40:50.609 --> 02:40:51.609]  Think about this.
[02:40:51.609 --> 02:40:55.650]  South Africa has been governed by the ANC for almost 30 years, right?
[02:40:55.650 --> 02:40:56.970]  Black governance.
[02:40:56.970 --> 02:40:59.769]  There is no race struggle.
[02:40:59.769 --> 02:41:00.769]  There is no oppression.
[02:41:00.769 --> 02:41:03.130]  If there is oppression, it's not coming from white people.
[02:41:03.130 --> 02:41:07.010]  It's coming from the black government, which is the ANC.
[02:41:07.010 --> 02:41:14.090]  Every major position of power in South Africa is by a black person and I'm sorry I'm bringing
[02:41:14.090 --> 02:41:17.930]  race into it, but this is the reality.
[02:41:17.930 --> 02:41:26.970]  So there isn't this black oppression, but keep in mind also that the EFF, they openly
[02:41:26.970 --> 02:41:29.769]  state that they are Marxist-Leninists.
[02:41:29.769 --> 02:41:30.769]  They are ultra-left-leaning.
[02:41:30.769 --> 02:41:31.769]  Ultra.
[02:41:31.769 --> 02:41:39.849]  It doesn't get further to the left and in actual fact, if you go and watch that video
[02:41:39.849 --> 02:41:45.810]  clip of him at that stadium rally a week ago and he gets lifted up on the stage, watch
[02:41:45.810 --> 02:41:47.050]  what he does right at the end.
[02:41:47.050 --> 02:41:49.490]  He holds his fist up in the air.
[02:41:49.490 --> 02:41:55.330]  It looks very, very similar to something we all know with that same kind of fist in the
[02:41:55.330 --> 02:42:00.769]  air type setup with the red backdrop.
[02:42:00.769 --> 02:42:01.769]  It's very similar.
[02:42:01.769 --> 02:42:10.130]  Now, I don't know if that's just coincidental, but the point is that these guys are not interested
[02:42:10.130 --> 02:42:13.090]  in money because they do have money.
[02:42:13.090 --> 02:42:16.050]  They're champagne socialists or champagne communists.
[02:42:16.050 --> 02:42:18.650]  I mean, Julius Menem wears a Breitling watch.
[02:42:18.650 --> 02:42:20.609]  That is serious, serious money.
[02:42:20.609 --> 02:42:24.730]  He's got the most expensive cars, most expensive house, most expensive everything.
[02:42:24.730 --> 02:42:31.050]  So again, I think it's about an imaginary power struggle, an imaginary power structure.
[02:42:31.050 --> 02:42:35.730]  It's about this fake oppression that Black Lives Matter and Antifa are always on about
[02:42:35.730 --> 02:42:36.730]  too.
[02:42:36.730 --> 02:42:42.570]  We've got one more segment left with Jeremy Nell, but it's amazing the parallels here.
[02:42:42.570 --> 02:42:44.250]  Same thing in the United States of America.
[02:42:44.250 --> 02:42:49.369]  It might not be as racially motivated as it is in South Africa, but it's the same thing.
[02:42:49.369 --> 02:42:56.369]  Everywhere where the Democrat Party operates, it becomes a death criminal infested hellhole.
[02:43:19.369 --> 02:43:34.810]  The
[02:43:34.810 --> 02:43:42.330]  model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how using the money for Americana freedom
[02:43:42.330 --> 02:43:44.369]  to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[02:43:44.369 --> 02:43:45.849]  That's what the debanking is about.
[02:43:45.849 --> 02:43:47.650]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[02:43:47.650 --> 02:43:52.449]  That's why we've got to rush to support MyPillow.com and InfoWars.com, plus their great products
[02:43:52.449 --> 02:43:58.609]  at both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[02:43:58.609 --> 02:44:01.810]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:44:01.810 --> 02:44:07.010]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[02:44:07.010 --> 02:44:08.010]  us.
[02:44:08.010 --> 02:44:13.449]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:44:13.449 --> 02:44:16.449]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:44:17.250 --> 02:44:21.250]  When you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:44:21.250 --> 02:44:25.250]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:44:25.250 --> 02:44:29.250]  For myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:44:29.250 --> 02:44:34.250]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not
[02:44:34.250 --> 02:44:35.250]  support us.
[02:44:35.250 --> 02:44:36.250]  I know you spread the word.
[02:44:36.250 --> 02:44:37.250]  I know you pray for us.
[02:44:37.250 --> 02:44:38.250]  That's wonderful.
[02:44:38.250 --> 02:44:39.250]  Keep doing it.
[02:44:39.250 --> 02:44:44.050]  Most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich
[02:44:44.050 --> 02:44:45.050]  and empower your life.
[02:44:45.650 --> 02:44:46.650]  At the same time, keep us on air.
[02:44:46.650 --> 02:44:50.650]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:50.650 --> 02:44:55.650]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems
[02:44:55.650 --> 02:44:56.650]  will be over.
[02:44:56.650 --> 02:44:57.650]  Please take action now.
[02:44:57.650 --> 02:45:01.650]  InfoWarsStore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[02:45:01.650 --> 02:45:04.650]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[02:45:04.650 --> 02:45:07.650]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you, so I get constant questions online
[02:45:07.650 --> 02:45:08.650]  and in person.
[02:45:08.650 --> 02:45:09.650]  Hey, what's better?
[02:45:09.650 --> 02:45:10.650]  Knockout.
[02:45:10.650 --> 02:45:11.650]  What's better?
[02:45:11.650 --> 02:45:12.650]  Down and out.
[02:45:12.650 --> 02:45:13.650]  What's better?
[02:45:14.250 --> 02:45:15.250]  Two or three different sleep aids.
[02:45:15.250 --> 02:45:19.849]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different
[02:45:19.849 --> 02:45:20.849]  people.
[02:45:20.849 --> 02:45:25.050]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[02:45:25.050 --> 02:45:26.250]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:45:26.250 --> 02:45:27.250]  They're all very diverse.
[02:45:27.250 --> 02:45:31.810]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years

[02:45:57.730 --> 02:46:02.609]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:46:02.609 --> 02:46:07.090]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all
[02:46:07.090 --> 02:46:12.170]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[02:46:12.170 --> 02:46:17.369]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula, the new platinum

[02:46:56.800 --> 02:47:07.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:23.560]  All right, Jeremy, now with us from South Africa, I couldn't help but notice the parallels to
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:29.240]  the EFF party, obviously not as powerful as the Democrat party, but it sounds like the
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:30.400]  same results.
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:36.119]  Everywhere the Democrat party is in control, highest crime rates, highest poverty rates,
[02:47:36.119 --> 02:47:41.960]  highest homelessness rates, the violence, the death, all of it, and yet they tell their
[02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:45.859]  people, we're here for you, we love you so much, vote for us, and then they just steal
[02:47:45.859 --> 02:47:48.640]  all the loot and leave them in a hellhole.
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:54.279]  It sounds like everything you're saying about the EFF and their most recent event, it sounds
[02:47:54.279 --> 02:47:59.160]  exactly like what we see here in the West dealing with the Democrats and, of course,
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:05.080]  the Soros-backed front groups that do their street-level propaganda for them.
[02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:12.400]  Yeah, it is similar, and it's always the same type of ideology, Owen, haven't you noticed?
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:21.160]  It's always that sort of Marxist, neo-Marxist, cultural Marxist, left-wing, pro-communist,
[02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:27.320]  victimhood culture type group of people, it's always the same.
[02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:30.420]  And the irony is that it doesn't have to be black people, it's just because I'm in South
[02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:33.560]  Africa, we're on the African continent, it happens to be that, but you can have the same
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:35.640]  thing in Europe, and you do, you see it.
[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:39.000]  I mean, that's what LGBTQ and all that is, it's got nothing to do with skin color, it's
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:46.720]  all about the same type of utopian vision for the future that always ends up in the
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:49.199]  same type of mess.
[02:48:49.199 --> 02:48:58.439]  It's always this desire to destroy what is normal, to create tension, it's never about
[02:48:58.439 --> 02:48:59.439]  building.
[02:48:59.439 --> 02:49:00.439]  Have you noticed that?
[02:49:00.439 --> 02:49:03.480]  It's always about chaos and destruction.
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:10.160]  Well, and here's why putting somebody into the victim ideology is so dangerous, because
[02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:13.320]  it then justifies anything they do.
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:20.720]  And if you've ever been in a situation where you're in a fight or flight type of a moment,
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:24.720]  like I'll never forget, I was a young kid, and I was a pretty scrawny kid.
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:29.720]  And we used to wrestle in the pool, do dogfighting and stuff like this, and one of the bigger
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:33.119]  kids who was older than me was holding me under the water, and I mean, I thought I was
[02:49:33.119 --> 02:49:34.119]  going to die.
[02:49:34.119 --> 02:49:38.119]  I thought I was going to drown, and something came over my body, like I became like a hundred
[02:49:38.119 --> 02:49:39.119]  times stronger.
[02:49:39.119 --> 02:49:42.560]  I somehow lifted this gigantic dude off of me, and I was able to breathe.
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:47.920]  So but I was a victim in that moment, and so I had strength in that moment, and I had the
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:50.160]  strength to overcome the situation.
[02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:51.720]  But that's a real situation.
[02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:55.960]  They're putting this mentality into people who are really not victims.
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:50:01.119]  They're putting this mentality, the very people they are oppressing themselves, they're putting
[02:50:01.119 --> 02:50:04.519]  them into this victim mentality, and then they're saying, this is the person holding
[02:50:04.519 --> 02:50:05.960]  your head underwater.
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:09.960]  This is the person that you're justified to do evil acts and violence against.
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:11.199]  That's what I see going on.
[02:50:11.199 --> 02:50:16.000]  That's why the victim mentality is so dangerous, because you put somebody where now they feel
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:21.480]  that they're in an atmosphere where whatever violence or whatever they want to do is justified
[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:25.080]  because somebody is oppressing them.
[02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:26.720]  So that's exactly correct.
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:37.240]  And if you can convince people that you are oppressed, you can always win political points,
[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:43.359]  because no politician generally wants to be that person who's going to dismiss what you're
[02:50:43.359 --> 02:50:52.240]  saying, which is why a lot of these types of movements use, they employ weasel words.
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:54.599]  They'll say Black Lives Matter.
[02:50:54.599 --> 02:51:00.560]  That's a very clever phrase, because if you say, well, black lives don't matter, then
[02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:02.519]  you sound like a complete moron.
[02:51:02.519 --> 02:51:04.920]  You sound like a horrible human being.
[02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:06.039]  Obviously black lives matter.
[02:51:06.039 --> 02:51:09.480]  And so if you had to say, well, I don't support black lives matter, they're going, well, don't
[02:51:09.480 --> 02:51:11.080]  you think black lives matter?
[02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:14.840]  So what happens is that it's a trap.
[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:17.519]  And it's the same thing with the EFF here in South Africa.
[02:51:17.519 --> 02:51:23.240]  They use things like apartheid to say, well, white people oppressed us.
[02:51:23.880 --> 02:51:32.320]  And if you say, well, it's almost 30 years gone now, they'll go, oh, but apartheid was
[02:51:32.320 --> 02:51:33.679]  much longer.
[02:51:33.679 --> 02:51:35.439]  Don't you care about us?
[02:51:35.439 --> 02:51:37.560]  And so what happens is that you end up again in a trap.
[02:51:37.560 --> 02:51:43.480]  You always have to somehow navigate this minefield that is victimhood culture.
[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:49.439]  And it's like a mind virus that permeates so many people.
[02:51:49.439 --> 02:51:54.720]  And I don't understand why more people don't see it, you know what I mean?
[02:51:54.720 --> 02:52:00.640]  It seems like it's always the minority of us who see this bizarre type of mentality
[02:52:00.640 --> 02:52:01.640]  that goes.
[02:52:01.640 --> 02:52:07.880]  And I think Matthias Desmet, who I believe has been on Infowars, he calls it mass formation.
[02:52:07.880 --> 02:52:12.640]  It's where the majority, or not majority, but about 30 or 40% of people tend to always
[02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:17.599]  latch onto this kind of thing, because it's like some sort of safety mechanism.
[02:52:17.720 --> 02:52:23.359]  They kind of spur each other on in it, but you'll always find that 25 or 30% of people
[02:52:23.359 --> 02:52:24.359]  who will reject it.
[02:52:24.359 --> 02:52:26.720]  And I guess you and I are part of that.
[02:52:26.720 --> 02:52:29.160]  But I do wonder if that will ever change.
[02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:31.439]  Do you think it's always going to be like that?
[02:52:31.439 --> 02:52:34.320]  I mean, it's something that I'm always fascinated by.
[02:52:34.320 --> 02:52:39.480]  Well, there's a certain level of brainwashing and ignorance that I think comes along with
[02:52:39.480 --> 02:52:42.560]  it and sometimes it has to smack you right in the face.
[02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:48.759]  I mean, maybe if I gave a large extreme example for South Africa, well, okay, the EFF, let's
[02:52:48.759 --> 02:52:53.720]  say gets power and they send out minions and you go and murder another thousand white farmers
[02:52:53.720 --> 02:52:54.720]  and then you starve to death.
[02:52:54.720 --> 02:52:57.720]  Well, okay, now I'm starving to death because I killed all the black farmers.
[02:52:57.720 --> 02:52:59.439]  Well, that's what you get.
[02:52:59.439 --> 02:53:00.439]  And so I kind of compare it.
[02:53:00.439 --> 02:53:04.039]  It's like the same thing with Democrats and liberals that vote for Democrat policies that
[02:53:04.039 --> 02:53:05.840]  end up destroying their cities.
[02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:09.320]  But I think it's not just when you talk about the propaganda, because they do the same thing
[02:53:09.320 --> 02:53:10.320]  here as well.
[02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:17.519]  There's always this reverse reality terminology that they use, like they'll chop off a little
[02:53:17.519 --> 02:53:20.119]  boy's penis and they'll say that's gender affirmation.
[02:53:20.119 --> 02:53:24.119]  Well, it's obviously gender rejection, but you just say gender affirmation.
[02:53:24.119 --> 02:53:26.759]  It's the complete exact opposite of what it is.
[02:53:26.759 --> 02:53:28.039]  That might be a different issue.
[02:53:28.039 --> 02:53:33.039]  But dealing with the oppression and the victimhood mindset, I think it's for many of them.
[02:53:33.039 --> 02:53:34.920]  I don't even think it's that they can't see it.
[02:53:34.920 --> 02:53:39.560]  I think it's a level of insecurity and I think it's a level of laziness.
[02:53:39.560 --> 02:53:43.759]  Because if I can just claim to be oppressed and a victim and then get free stuff, well,
[02:53:43.759 --> 02:53:45.720]  gee, now I don't have to work hard.
[02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:47.279]  I can have everything given to me.
[02:53:47.279 --> 02:53:51.800]  If I don't make a success of myself, I can just blame it on being a victim and being
[02:53:51.800 --> 02:53:52.800]  oppressed.
[02:53:52.800 --> 02:53:54.840]  And it's the insecurity.
[02:53:54.840 --> 02:53:57.160]  People feel like, hey, I have no way to make it.
[02:53:57.160 --> 02:54:01.599]  I'm not good enough, so I'm just going to claim permanent victimhood status and try
[02:54:01.599 --> 02:54:02.599]  to get whatever I can.
[02:54:02.599 --> 02:54:06.960]  I think there's a lot of that going on, too.
[02:54:06.960 --> 02:54:10.439]  And let me just say also, you're talking about the real victimhood.
[02:54:10.439 --> 02:54:13.400]  Now, we haven't touched on this and maybe we should talk about this another time.
[02:54:13.400 --> 02:54:16.759]  But another big problem in South Africa is electricity.
[02:54:16.759 --> 02:54:20.560]  Now, there's a real issue.
[02:54:20.560 --> 02:54:27.720]  On average, last year, I think about 50% of our entire year, there was no electricity.
[02:54:27.720 --> 02:54:33.199]  So we were averaging 6 to 10 hours per day of no electricity.
[02:54:33.199 --> 02:54:35.679]  Now, that's real victimhood.
[02:54:35.679 --> 02:54:36.679]  Because what do you do?
[02:54:37.199 --> 02:54:39.439]  You cannot operate your business.
[02:54:39.439 --> 02:54:45.320]  So you can either sit back and you can point figures and blame, or you can make a plan.
[02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:47.840]  You either sink or you don't sink.
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:50.519]  You start looking at investing in alternative energy.
[02:54:50.519 --> 02:54:53.960]  I heard one of the adverts earlier talking about exactly that.
[02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:55.000]  That's what you got to do.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:58.199]  That is a winning mindset as opposed to a victimhood mindset.
[02:54:58.199 --> 02:54:59.199]  You know what I mean?
[02:54:59.199 --> 02:55:04.119]  But see, that requires work, that requires struggle, that requires commitment, and that's
[02:55:04.119 --> 02:55:06.320]  why I think the laziness aspect comes in.
[02:55:06.359 --> 02:55:07.759]  People don't want to endure it.
[02:55:09.759 --> 02:55:10.759]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:55:10.759 --> 02:55:14.519]  But it's always, as you said earlier, it's always that leftist mindset that's lazy and
[02:55:14.519 --> 02:55:16.920]  doesn't want to do the work.
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:18.240]  But of course, they're communists.
[02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:20.199]  They want to take your stuff.
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:24.039]  Yeah, they want to take your stuff.
[02:55:24.039 --> 02:55:27.560]  And then, when there's no more, they want to find other people from whom they want
[02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:28.560]  to take stuff.
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:29.560]  Bingo.
[02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:30.560]  That's it.
[02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:31.560]  Exactly.
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:33.199]  Jeremy Nell, this has been a fantastic hour.
[02:55:33.199 --> 02:55:37.840]  Tell people where they can follow your work, and if they want to, keep updated with your
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:39.720]  information coming out of South Africa.
[02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:42.720]  Thanks, Owen.
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:48.519]  The easiest is just to go to my website, germwarfare.com, germ with a J, germwarfare.com.
[02:55:48.519 --> 02:55:49.519]  Everything is there.
[02:55:49.519 --> 02:55:51.439]  Well, this has been an enlightening hour.
[02:55:51.439 --> 02:55:55.640]  I thank you for joining us, and I'm glad your electricity was able to stay on for the whole
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:56.640]  interview.
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:55:59.640]  I'm using backup power.
[02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:00.640]  Oh, okay.
[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:01.640]  So you were already prepared.
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:03.080]  Well, look at that.
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:04.080]  You practice what you preach.
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:05.080]  I'm not surprised.
[02:56:05.080 --> 02:56:06.080]  Hey, Jeremy, great stuff.
[02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:07.080]  Thank you for your time.
[02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:08.080]  All right.
[02:56:08.080 --> 02:56:09.080]  Wow.
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:10.080]  A little bit of an insight into what's really going on in South Africa.
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:11.080]  I learned a lot, actually.
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:12.080]  I learned a lot from that, as well.
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:13.080]  So I hope you did, too.
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:14.080]  All right.
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:15.080]  I am about to hand over the baton to Gerald Salente.
[02:56:15.080 --> 02:56:16.080]  I think.
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:17.080]  Do we have anything else from Alex, guys?
[02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:18.080]  Not as of right now.
[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:19.080]  Okay.
[02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:20.080]  Well, as of right now, I'm about to hand the baton over to Gerald Salente.
[02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:21.080]  I will be back hosting the War Room, and I'm going to be really focused.
[02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:22.080]  I got it all planned out.
[02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:23.080]  We're going to really dig into all the news.
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:24.080]  I'll get back into what I teased earlier with the Dr. Jan Halper Hayes interview, as
[02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:25.080]  well as some other video clips and stuff.
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:26.080]  We'll be ready to go here in an hour hosting the War Room right here, same studio.
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:27.080]  I'm going to take an hour break, get myself ready.
[02:56:27.080 --> 02:56:28.080]  I'll see you in a minute.
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:29.080]  All right.

[02:59:18.080 --> 02:59:19.080]  Bye.
[02:59:19.080 --> 02:59:20.080]  Bye.
[02:59:20.080 --> 02:59:21.080]  Bye.
[02:59:21.080 --> 02:59:22.080]  Bye.
[02:59:22.080 --> 02:59:23.080]  Bye.
[02:59:23.080 --> 02:59:24.080]  Bye.
[02:59:24.080 --> 02:59:25.080]  Bye.
[02:59:25.080 --> 02:59:26.080]  Bye.
[02:59:26.080 --> 02:59:27.080]  Bye.
[02:59:27.080 --> 02:59:28.080]  Bye.
[02:59:28.080 --> 02:59:29.080]  Bye.
[02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:30.080]  Bye.
[02:59:30.080 --> 02:59:31.080]  Bye.
[02:59:31.080 --> 02:59:32.080]  Bye.
[02:59:32.080 --> 02:59:33.080]  Bye.
[02:59:33.080 --> 02:59:34.080]  Bye.
[02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:35.080]  Bye.
[02:59:35.080 --> 02:59:36.080]  Bye.
[02:59:36.080 --> 02:59:37.080]  Bye.
[02:59:37.080 --> 02:59:38.080]  Bye.
[02:59:38.080 --> 02:59:39.080]  Bye.
[02:59:39.080 --> 02:59:40.080]  Bye.
[02:59:40.080 --> 02:59:41.080]  Bye.
[02:59:41.080 --> 02:59:42.080]  Bye.
[02:59:42.080 --> 02:59:43.080]  Bye.
[02:59:43.080 --> 02:59:44.080]  Bye.
[02:59:44.080 --> 02:59:45.080]  Bye.
[02:59:45.080 --> 02:59:46.080]  Bye.
[02:59:46.080 --> 02:59:47.080]  Bye.
[02:59:47.080 --> 02:59:47.099]  Bye.
[02:59:46.900 --> 02:59:57.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:57.900 --> 03:00:01.900]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying, and that's why they run the fake headline
[03:00:01.900 --> 03:00:07.180]  against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day.
[03:00:07.180 --> 03:00:13.060]  Jones admits he's an actor, or Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[03:00:13.060 --> 03:00:14.060]  Where do we say that?
[03:00:14.060 --> 03:00:15.060]  We never said that.
[03:00:15.060 --> 03:00:18.420]  We just say we said that.
[03:00:18.420 --> 03:00:19.539]  But where's the clip?
[03:00:19.539 --> 03:00:20.539]  Where's the article?
[03:00:20.539 --> 03:00:21.539]  Where do we say that?
[03:00:21.539 --> 03:00:22.820]  It doesn't exist.
[03:00:22.820 --> 03:00:27.699]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[03:00:27.699 --> 03:00:30.420]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[03:00:30.420 --> 03:00:34.980]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[03:00:34.980 --> 03:00:37.100]  He's actually a performance artist.
[03:00:37.100 --> 03:00:38.580]  He's a performance artist.
[03:00:38.580 --> 03:00:40.619]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[03:00:40.619 --> 03:00:46.900]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid, and it's all based on the custody
[03:00:46.900 --> 03:00:51.260]  battle with my ex-wife five years ago, when she was trying to put into evidence me dressed
[03:00:51.260 --> 03:00:56.340]  up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic, saying, take your Prozac,
[03:00:56.340 --> 03:00:57.340]  kids.
[03:00:57.340 --> 03:00:58.340]  Take your illegal drugs, too.
[03:00:58.340 --> 03:00:59.340]  You'll die.
[03:00:59.340 --> 03:01:00.340]  It's fun.
[03:01:00.340 --> 03:01:02.980]  So people wouldn't take drugs.
[03:01:02.980 --> 03:01:04.180]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence.
[03:01:04.180 --> 03:01:05.180]  They look.
[03:01:05.180 --> 03:01:06.980]  He's insane, telling kids to use drugs.
[03:01:06.980 --> 03:01:12.140]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's
[03:01:12.140 --> 03:01:13.140]  really Jack Nicholson.
[03:01:13.140 --> 03:01:21.580]  So, yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander or Optimus Prime or the Joker, because I can
[03:01:21.580 --> 03:01:27.619]  do imitations of them all really good, or Darth Vader, don't act so surprised, globalist.
[03:01:27.619 --> 03:01:31.660]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[03:01:31.660 --> 03:01:33.699]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[03:01:33.699 --> 03:01:34.699]  No.
[03:01:34.699 --> 03:01:36.380]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime?
[03:01:36.380 --> 03:01:37.380]  Cobra Commander?
[03:01:37.380 --> 03:01:38.380]  The Joker?
[03:01:38.380 --> 03:01:39.380]  No.
[03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:44.140]  And clearly, no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying
[03:01:44.140 --> 03:01:45.940]  is what I really think.
[03:01:45.940 --> 03:01:47.779]  No one believes the Babylon Bee.
[03:01:47.779 --> 03:01:49.060]  It's not trying to lie to you.
[03:01:49.060 --> 03:01:50.699]  It's being sarcastic.
[03:01:50.699 --> 03:01:52.940]  Buy the Vaccinate Me Elmo doll today.
[03:01:52.940 --> 03:01:54.340]  It's required by the CDC.
[03:01:54.340 --> 03:01:59.740]  But they play those games, and that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to, even
[03:01:59.740 --> 03:02:02.740]  though I tell people, OK, this is a joke, this isn't serious.
[03:02:02.740 --> 03:02:08.539]  They clip it out, and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[03:02:08.539 --> 03:02:10.820]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[03:02:10.820 --> 03:02:11.820]  That man's a threat to this country.
[03:02:11.820 --> 03:02:14.539]  And they go, look, he admitted in court he's an actor.
[03:02:14.539 --> 03:02:17.380]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly.
[03:02:17.380 --> 03:02:18.980]  I was an actor in Waking Life.
[03:02:18.980 --> 03:02:24.100]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[03:02:24.100 --> 03:02:29.100]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to
[03:02:29.100 --> 03:02:32.539]  you isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying.
[03:02:33.340 --> 03:02:34.340]  And you know that.
[03:02:34.340 --> 03:02:35.340]  You're insulted right now.
[03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:36.660]  I'm even explaining that to you.
[03:02:36.660 --> 03:02:37.660]  And so am I.
[03:02:37.660 --> 03:02:40.660]  But that's who these people are.
[03:02:40.660 --> 03:02:45.980]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[03:02:45.980 --> 03:02:47.460]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[03:02:47.460 --> 03:02:50.260]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented.
[03:02:50.260 --> 03:02:51.260]  He's smart.
[03:02:51.260 --> 03:02:52.740]  He's funny as hell.
[03:02:52.740 --> 03:02:54.100]  He's truly funny.
[03:02:54.100 --> 03:02:55.100]  I'm kind of retarded.
[03:03:03.380 --> 03:03:09.500]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what
[03:03:09.500 --> 03:03:14.460]  I say about other things when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola
[03:03:14.460 --> 03:03:20.580]  on Infowars.com that has all the cited information, the latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome?
[03:03:20.580 --> 03:03:23.340]  No, that's a real thing.
[03:03:23.340 --> 03:03:25.740]  That's something happening in the real world.
[03:03:25.740 --> 03:03:29.020]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[03:03:29.020 --> 03:03:33.060]  I am Alex Jones, and I am the guy on the show every day.
[03:03:33.060 --> 03:03:38.020]  I am an American, and that's what I promote, is freedom and justice and liberty.
[03:03:38.020 --> 03:03:40.020]  And they can't stand it.
[03:03:50.020 --> 03:03:52.020]  Pesky earth creatures.
[03:03:52.020 --> 03:04:05.020]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:04:13.020 --> 03:04:15.020]  Infowars has been banned.
[03:04:17.020 --> 03:04:18.020]  Arrested.
[03:04:19.020 --> 03:04:22.020]  Attacked and threatened.

[03:04:26.020 --> 03:04:28.020]  The great awakening is here.

[03:06:10.020 --> 03:06:15.020]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:15.020 --> 03:06:21.020]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Solente.
[03:06:23.020 --> 03:06:26.020]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:26.020 --> 03:06:28.020]  It's a real pleasure.
[03:06:28.020 --> 03:06:34.020]  I thank all the people that work on Infowars, all the hard work they do to give you the best they can.
[03:06:34.020 --> 03:06:39.020]  And as Alex was saying, you know, they'll make up anything, those prostitutes.
[03:06:39.020 --> 03:06:44.020]  Every time they talk about Alex, they're beginning with a conspiracy theorist.
[03:06:44.020 --> 03:06:46.020]  What's a conspiracy theorist?
[03:06:46.020 --> 03:07:00.020]  A conspiracy theorist in America, A-M-E-R-I-K-A, is not swallowing the crap that the government shoves down your throat.
[03:07:00.020 --> 03:07:11.020]  If you don't swallow the crap the government shoves down your throat, you are a conspiracy theorist.
[03:07:11.020 --> 03:07:14.020]  In the land of the free.
[03:07:14.600 --> 03:07:24.600]  In the home of the brave? What brave? You got a country of cowards.
[03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:29.800]  Little boys and girls that follow orders.
[03:07:30.800 --> 03:07:35.800]  Hey men and hey women, do what we tell ya.
[03:07:36.800 --> 03:07:39.800]  So my tweet before I came on the air.
[03:07:40.800 --> 03:07:44.800]  Ready to die? Keep your mouth shut.
[03:07:45.700 --> 03:07:48.700]  Do what your government tells you.
[03:07:48.700 --> 03:07:51.700]  Obey your politicians.
[03:07:51.700 --> 03:07:54.700]  Swallow prostitute crap.
[03:07:56.100 --> 03:07:59.100]  World War III has begun.
[03:07:59.100 --> 03:08:03.100]  If we don't stop it, we'll be dead.
[03:08:03.100 --> 03:08:06.100]  We have to beat them.
[03:08:06.100 --> 03:08:08.100]  Here's what to do.
[03:08:08.100 --> 03:08:11.100]  Tune in at 3 p.m.
[03:08:11.100 --> 03:08:13.100]  Here we are.
[03:08:13.100 --> 03:08:19.100]  I was a speaker at the Humanity for Peace rally
[03:08:19.100 --> 03:08:22.100]  outside the United Nations yesterday.
[03:08:22.100 --> 03:08:24.100]  Scott Ritter was there too.
[03:08:24.100 --> 03:08:26.100]  Boy, that cat man, nobody like him.
[03:08:26.100 --> 03:08:28.100]  Nobody like him.
[03:08:28.100 --> 03:08:32.100]  He was one of the speakers as well as a number of others.
[03:08:32.100 --> 03:08:35.100]  Not that many people turned up.
[03:08:35.100 --> 03:08:39.100]  And this was about Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[03:08:40.200 --> 03:08:46.200]  And Ritter did a whole number on that as well as I did.
[03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:53.200]  So it was a nice mixed crowd. There were Asians, there were blacks, the old and young, but not that many.
[03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:55.200]  And it said...
[03:08:56.400 --> 03:09:00.400]  It's outside the United Nations.
[03:09:00.400 --> 03:09:02.400]  Humanity for peace, you could...
[03:09:02.400 --> 03:09:05.400]  I'm not going to go into what I talked about and stuff, but...
[03:09:05.200 --> 03:09:08.200]  Where were all the people?
[03:09:08.500 --> 03:09:18.500]  United Nations, United Nothings, United Nitwits, these are the people with Colin Powell, remember
[03:09:18.500 --> 03:09:19.500]  Colin Powell?
[03:09:19.500 --> 03:09:21.420]  You know what a colon is?
[03:09:21.420 --> 03:09:25.300]  All the crap shoots through the colon, that's right.
[03:09:25.300 --> 03:09:26.300]  Crap colon.
[03:09:26.300 --> 03:09:28.100]  Lying us into the...
[03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:38.200]  Iraq war, holding up a little vial of coal and crap. This is proof that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction.
[03:09:38.200 --> 03:09:45.200]  And again, Scott Ritter was the man that came out against this. There's no evidence at all about this.
[03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:54.200]  And there's that clip of little Joe Biden, the warmongering freak that's our president, denouncing Ritter for saying that.
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:10:02.200]  That's the UN where they put on these acts. Yeah, the League of Nations, that's all it is.
[03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:08.200]  It didn't change from the one America didn't want to get into after World War I.
[03:10:08.200 --> 03:10:19.200]  It's a clown show, a bunch of little bureau craps, little arrogant people, members of the club, putting out crap and doing crap, united nothings.
[03:10:19.200 --> 03:10:27.200]  We're all the people. Imagine if you were Ukrainian. Imagine what your life would be like.
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  Every day, every day, they're going to bomb us, they're going to bomb us.
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  And if you're one of those people in eastern Ukraine, in the Donbass region,
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:43.000]  who broke away after the United States overthrew the democratically elected
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:50.000]  government of Viktor Yanukovych, all in your Trends Journal back in 2014,
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:54.000]  and they are mostly, they're Russians, they speak Russian,
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  they broke away, how about all them being killed?
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  Only about 15,000 of them.
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  Can you imagine what your life would be?
[03:11:05.500 --> 03:11:10.500]  We are on the brink of nuclear annihilation.
[03:11:10.500 --> 03:11:13.500]  World War Three has begun.
[03:11:13.500 --> 03:11:17.500]  You think World War One began when they bombed,
[03:11:17.500 --> 03:11:23.500]  when they killed the Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo?
[03:11:23.500 --> 03:11:29.500]  Hey, what are you doing over there in Sarajevo, Archduke Ferdinand?
[03:11:29.500 --> 03:11:32.500]  Hey, I'm the Archduke.
[03:11:33.500 --> 03:11:36.500]  Hey, the Archduke.
[03:11:36.500 --> 03:11:39.500]  I'm a member of the crime syndicate
[03:11:39.500 --> 03:11:43.500]  that morons and imbeciles call nobility.
[03:11:43.500 --> 03:11:48.500]  How much money does that King Charles got?
[03:11:48.500 --> 03:11:50.500]  Oh yeah, we owinged it.
[03:11:50.500 --> 03:11:53.500]  You murderers.
[03:11:53.500 --> 03:11:57.500]  You got a track record of murder and killing.
[03:11:57.500 --> 03:12:02.500]  That the bloods in the crypts, boy, they look up to you.
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:06.000]  These are the people running our lives.
[03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:10.000]  Oh, I saw the clip on this place called InfoWars.
[03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:11.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:20.000]  That one about out of his mind, arrogant, stupid, ignorant piece of scum crap.
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000]  Mitch McConnell.
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:24.000]  Yeah.
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:30.000]  I went on InfoWars today and the people booing him, retire, retire.
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  He's going.
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:39.000]  Yeah.
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:41.000]  There he is.
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:42.000]  Look at this.
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:44.000]  They're booing him, booing him, booing him.
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:49.000]  Look at this little stupid piece of scum.
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:57.000]  This arrogant little boy who never worked a day in his life and has been sucking off the public.
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  Look at him.
[03:13:00.200 --> 03:13:03.200]  One jerk after another.
[03:13:03.200 --> 03:13:06.200]  Oh no, I know, you look up to Chuckie Schumer.
[03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:09.200]  Chuckie Schumer's on the other side.
[03:13:09.200 --> 03:13:12.200]  Hey, hey, did you see Blimpo?
[03:13:12.200 --> 03:13:14.200]  Arrogant blimp.
[03:13:14.200 --> 03:13:17.200]  Piece of scum crap.
[03:13:17.200 --> 03:13:21.200]  Chris Christie, go to Ukraine.
[03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:24.200]  The language that he uses, that we're gonna keep fighting,
[03:13:24.200 --> 03:13:27.200]  we're gonna keep spending, we're gonna keep, we're gonna, we?
[03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:30.200]  Hey, fat boy, you couldn't fight your way out of a paper bag.
[03:13:30.200 --> 03:13:37.200]  Matter of fact, they don't make paper bags big enough for a blimp like you.
[03:13:37.200 --> 03:13:41.200]  Anybody that wants to support war,
[03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:45.200]  go over there and fight or shut your mouth.
[03:13:46.800 --> 03:13:49.800]  Blimpo!
[03:13:50.800 --> 03:13:54.800]  Look at this little arrogant blimp!
[03:13:56.300 --> 03:14:00.300]  We are on the verge of nuclear annihilation.
[03:14:00.300 --> 03:14:03.300]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:14:03.300 --> 03:14:05.300]  We're going to get into the economy later.
[03:14:05.300 --> 03:14:07.300]  Oh, oh, the Dow is up.
[03:14:07.300 --> 03:14:08.300]  Oh, I forgot.
[03:14:08.300 --> 03:14:10.300]  The Dow is up.
[03:14:10.300 --> 03:14:12.300]  Oh, and Warren Buffett made a ton of money.
[03:14:12.300 --> 03:14:13.300]  Great.
[03:14:13.300 --> 03:14:15.300]  Hey, give any money for peace?
[03:14:15.300 --> 03:14:17.300]  Any money for peace?
[03:14:17.300 --> 03:14:20.300]  Any of you billionaires giving any money for the peace movement?
[03:14:20.300 --> 03:14:23.300]  Screw you, Solenti!
[03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:32.160]  We hate you because you launched occupied peace, and you are an American patriot like
[03:14:32.160 --> 03:14:37.600]  Alex Jones, and you believe in the Founding Fathers, no foreign entanglements.
[03:14:37.600 --> 03:14:40.760]  You believe in America's security first and only.
[03:14:41.900 --> 03:14:47.260]  As George Washington's farewell address a real man that fought not like these
[03:14:47.260 --> 03:14:50.619]  little boys that can't fight.
[03:14:49.900 --> 03:14:53.900]  No foreign entanglements, particularly what's going on in Europe,
[03:14:53.900 --> 03:14:57.900]  because basically this crap has been going on for thousands of years,
[03:14:57.900 --> 03:15:00.900]  and we're not going to fix it or get involved in it.
[03:15:02.300 --> 03:15:07.300]  We are on the verge of nuclear war.
[03:15:07.300 --> 03:15:10.300]  It's going to happen like that.
[03:15:10.300 --> 03:15:14.300]  You got sick guys and girls telling us what to do.
[03:15:15.900 --> 03:15:19.900]  And the people march off, the people march off.
[03:15:19.900 --> 03:15:21.900]  They march off to the COVID war.
[03:15:21.900 --> 03:15:23.900]  They marched off to the Iraq war.
[03:15:23.900 --> 03:15:27.900]  80%, 80% of the people swallowed shock and awe.
[03:15:27.900 --> 03:15:32.900]  80%, 88% believe that little dumbbell George W. Bush,
[03:15:32.900 --> 03:15:35.900]  we're going to get that guy Osama Bin Laden dead or alive.
[03:15:35.900 --> 03:15:39.900]  88% going to Afghanistan, the longest war.
[03:15:39.900 --> 03:15:42.900]  So do everything you can to support Infowars
[03:15:42.900 --> 03:15:48.900]  because if you don't, and if you don't do something for peace,
[03:15:48.900 --> 03:15:50.900]  it's finito.
[03:15:50.900 --> 03:15:51.900]  So what can we do?
[03:15:51.900 --> 03:15:53.900]  When we come back, we'll tell you more.
[03:15:53.900 --> 03:15:55.900]  Stay tuned.
[03:16:01.900 --> 03:16:02.900]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:16:02.900 --> 03:16:04.900]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:16:04.900 --> 03:16:05.900]  It is.
[03:16:05.900 --> 03:16:10.900]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:16:10.900 --> 03:16:11.900]  The fish oil is better than that.
[03:16:11.900 --> 03:16:13.900]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:16:13.900 --> 03:16:15.900]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:16:15.900 --> 03:16:18.900]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:16:18.900 --> 03:16:20.900]  Krill oils is the best.
[03:16:20.900 --> 03:16:21.900]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:16:21.900 --> 03:16:22.900]  And I'm just sorry.
[03:16:22.900 --> 03:16:23.900]  You want something like this?
[03:16:23.900 --> 03:16:24.900]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:16:24.900 --> 03:16:26.900]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:16:26.900 --> 03:16:27.900]  It's so good in my view.
[03:16:27.900 --> 03:16:29.900]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:16:29.900 --> 03:16:32.900]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:16:32.900 --> 03:16:34.900]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:16:35.900 --> 03:16:40.900]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:16:43.900 --> 03:16:45.900]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[03:16:45.900 --> 03:16:48.900]  But, you know, as I just obsess, because whatever the best is, we've got.
[03:16:48.900 --> 03:16:49.900]  I just can't lie to you.
[03:16:49.900 --> 03:16:50.900]  I just can't do it.
[03:16:55.900 --> 03:17:02.900]  When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground, you must find a way.
[03:17:04.900 --> 03:17:11.900]  When the darkness descends and you're told it's the end, you must find a way.
[03:17:11.900 --> 03:17:17.900]  When God decides to look the other way and a clown takes the throne, we must find a way.
[03:17:17.900 --> 03:17:19.900]  You will find a way.
[03:17:19.900 --> 03:17:22.900]  Dig down and find faith.
[03:17:23.900 --> 03:17:30.900]  When you're close to the edge with a gun to your head, you must find a way.
[03:17:30.900 --> 03:17:33.900]  We have entered the fray and we will not obey.
[03:17:33.900 --> 03:17:38.900]  We must find a way and find faith.
[03:17:43.900 --> 03:17:45.900]  We won't let them divide.
[03:17:45.900 --> 03:17:47.900]  We will never abide.
[03:17:48.900 --> 03:17:50.900]  We will find a way.
[03:17:50.900 --> 03:17:52.900]  introwars.com
[03:17:55.900 --> 03:18:00.900]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[03:18:00.900 --> 03:18:04.900]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy,
[03:18:04.900 --> 03:18:10.900]  you are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[03:18:10.900 --> 03:18:12.900]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:18:12.900 --> 03:18:15.900]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[03:18:15.900 --> 03:18:17.900]  And I'm preaching to the choir on that.
[03:18:17.900 --> 03:18:22.900]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[03:18:22.900 --> 03:18:24.900]  This is something you need now.
[03:18:24.900 --> 03:18:28.900]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[03:18:28.900 --> 03:18:34.900]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[03:18:34.900 --> 03:18:42.900]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water and air filtration.
[03:18:42.900 --> 03:18:44.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[03:18:44.900 --> 03:18:46.900]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[03:18:46.900 --> 03:18:49.900]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[03:18:49.900 --> 03:18:53.900]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[03:18:55.900 --> 03:18:57.900]  You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce?
[03:18:57.900 --> 03:19:00.900]  Yeah. So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[03:19:00.900 --> 03:19:02.900]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:19:02.900 --> 03:19:04.900]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz.
[03:19:04.900 --> 03:19:06.900]  Four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers.
[03:19:06.900 --> 03:19:08.900]  And now two books with Alex Jones.
[03:19:08.900 --> 03:19:12.900]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[03:19:12.900 --> 03:19:16.900]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:19:16.900 --> 03:19:20.900]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[03:19:20.900 --> 03:19:25.900]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[03:19:25.900 --> 03:19:29.900]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer.
[03:19:29.900 --> 03:19:33.900]  And I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:19:33.900 --> 03:19:37.900]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day.
[03:19:37.900 --> 03:19:39.900]  And it helps me with my writing.
[03:19:39.900 --> 03:19:40.900]  All right. We love you. We'll be right back.
[03:19:40.900 --> 03:19:45.900]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:45.900 --> 03:19:47.900]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[03:19:56.900 --> 03:20:01.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:01.900 --> 03:20:03.900]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.700 --> 03:20:27.700]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:20:27.700 --> 03:20:32.700]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:33.700 --> 03:20:45.700]  And as I said, I was honored to be one of the speakers at the Humanity for Peace rally outside of the United Nothings, United Nations, yesterday.
[03:20:45.700 --> 03:20:55.700]  And so few people showed up, considering it's New York City, and there should have been a couple of thousand, at least.
[03:20:55.700 --> 03:21:00.700]  And I'm mentioning about how easy it is to take the people to war.
[03:21:00.700 --> 03:21:10.700]  This is an article from your Trends Journal back in May of 2012.
[03:21:10.700 --> 03:21:21.700]  The COVID war is launched in January 2020 out of China in celebration of Chinese Lunar New Year, the year of the rat.
[03:21:21.700 --> 03:21:35.700]  Again, the cover of the Trends Journal magazine is, back in, was, back in two weeks later, coronavirus, 106 dead in China, 1.4 billion still alive.
[03:21:35.700 --> 03:21:37.700]  You know, like, why are you telling me this crap?
[03:21:37.700 --> 03:21:40.700]  So we were on this, we were the first calling it a fraud.
[03:21:40.700 --> 03:21:48.700]  So that's January, right? February is when they start sending kids home from school, closing down colleges.
[03:21:48.700 --> 03:21:55.700]  That guy Dorsey, that was the head of Twitter, cancels his trip to South Africa, and everybody got to start working from home.
[03:21:55.700 --> 03:22:01.700]  That's in February, March, April. Now, May, it's at the top.
[03:22:01.700 --> 03:22:05.700]  The whole, everybody's freaking out.
[03:22:05.700 --> 03:22:17.700]  By September, 97% of America was locked down, 97%, that's right.
[03:22:17.700 --> 03:22:25.860]  So this is May 12th, 2020, when George W., and it's called Shock and Awe 2.0, when George
[03:22:25.860 --> 03:22:32.620]  W. Bush launched the Iraq War in 2003, the prostitutes passionately quoted, and the vast
[03:22:32.620 --> 03:22:39.180]  majority of American public bought his, quote, shock and awe strategy, which would wipe out
[03:22:39.180 --> 03:22:46.420]  Saddam Hussein, destroy his fictional weapons of mass destruction, and bring freedom and
[03:22:46.420 --> 03:22:51.140]  democracy to the people of Iraq.
[03:22:51.140 --> 03:22:57.580]  Shock and awe strategy was to launch an attack so massive and quickly that the enemy would
[03:22:57.580 --> 03:23:03.500]  be stunned, confused, overwhelmed, and paralyzed.
[03:23:03.500 --> 03:23:12.780]  As with the 2003 Iraq War, and so too with the 2020 COVID war, a war launched by world
[03:23:12.780 --> 03:23:18.060]  leaders who locked down their citizens and shut down the global economy, which shot
[03:23:18.060 --> 03:23:26.020]  stunning speed, it left billions shocked and awed, impotent, helpless, hopeless, like never
[03:23:26.020 --> 03:23:28.020]  before in history.
[03:23:28.020 --> 03:23:34.020]  And again, remember, the shock and awe was going to end the war in Iraq quickly.
[03:23:34.020 --> 03:23:38.980]  Would it go on for how many years, 2003, we still got troops over there?
[03:23:39.100 --> 03:23:49.700]  Then and now, in 2003, when 80% of Americans believed the Iraq war was justified, today,
[03:23:49.700 --> 03:23:57.900]  and again, despite not one shred of evidence of WMDs, today, the vast majority of Americans
[03:23:57.900 --> 03:24:05.180]  are in support of COVID war, despite scientific evidence to the contrary, as amply reported
[03:24:05.180 --> 03:24:07.620]  in the Trends Journal.
[03:24:07.620 --> 03:24:15.020]  Some 80% of Americans support draconian shelter in place and non-essential lockdowns ordered
[03:24:15.020 --> 03:24:16.020]  by politicians.
[03:24:16.020 --> 03:24:23.340]  In fact, then, just as the prostitutes saw shock and awe to soundbite buying public,
[03:24:23.340 --> 03:24:29.380]  in the week before it began, more than 600 news reports around the world endlessly referred
[03:24:29.380 --> 03:24:36.060]  to shock and awe, according to the Washington Post, in 2020, as detailed in the Trends Journal,
[03:24:36.060 --> 03:24:41.460]  knowing it would boost their ratings, that media have been the prime sellers of the
[03:24:41.460 --> 03:24:42.340]  COVID war.
[03:24:42.500 --> 03:24:51.460]  Just as George W. Bush's ratings was boosted in the polls when he launched his war with
[03:24:51.460 --> 03:24:59.320]  Andrew Cuomo, America's COVID war hero, who with a favorability rating of just 43% as
[03:24:59.320 --> 03:25:07.180]  recently as February 2019, has now spiked to 87% favorability rating.
[03:25:07.580 --> 03:25:12.260]  Quote, Andrew Cuomo may be the single most popular politician in America right
[03:25:12.260 --> 03:25:16.100]  now, CNN, May 1st, 2020.
[03:25:17.300 --> 03:25:21.720]  Bragging for months about the success of his shelter in place order that he
[03:25:21.720 --> 03:25:29.780]  propagandized with another language of New York on pause, last Wednesday, he
[03:25:29.780 --> 03:25:35.260]  extended his dictatorial powers, quote, until further notice and speaking about
[03:25:35.260 --> 03:25:41.300]  the majority of New Yorkers reporting of Obama, Cuomo goes on to state that
[03:25:42.940 --> 03:25:48.980]  66% of the people who are at home, which got COVID, which is shocking to us.
[03:25:49.980 --> 03:25:52.740]  Yeah, this is the clown they threw out for harassment.
[03:25:53.660 --> 03:25:57.820]  A little daddy's boy that renamed the Tappan Zee Bridge that cost us taxpayers
[03:25:58.100 --> 03:26:00.580]  about $30 million that went over yesterday.
[03:26:02.140 --> 03:26:03.140]  Mario M.
[03:26:03.140 --> 03:26:04.460]  Cuomo Bridge.
[03:26:04.500 --> 03:26:06.980]  Yeah, that little clown, little daddy's boy.
[03:26:07.540 --> 03:26:08.100]  Okay.
[03:26:08.140 --> 03:26:09.860]  Why am I doing this?
[03:26:10.660 --> 03:26:15.940]  An article from the Toilet Paper Record, the New York Times.
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:25.000]  Just a few days ago, August 3rd, COVID cases on rise in New York.
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:35.000]  COVID cases and hospitalizations are rising in New York, prompting state health commissioner, state health commissioner, a little bureaucratic clown.
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:44.000]  Commissioner. Oh, Commissioner. Oh, I sucked my way into the system to be a commissioner.
[03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:48.000]  Hey, got showed I pay you.
[03:26:48.100 --> 03:27:00.800]  Public servant got it anyway the commissioner on Wednesday to urge New Yorkers to get tested
[03:27:00.800 --> 03:27:06.240]  if they have runny noses, headaches or other symptoms.
[03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:16.860]  You ready epidemiologists cited several factors likely contributing to rising transmission
[03:27:16.860 --> 03:27:22.020]  including a few days of scorching heat.
[03:27:22.100 --> 03:27:36.800]  That kept many people indoors, where respiratory viruses spread more easily.
[03:27:36.800 --> 03:27:37.800]  And then they go on.
[03:27:37.800 --> 03:27:38.800]  Hey, wait a minute.
[03:27:38.800 --> 03:27:41.800]  You locked us down!
[03:27:42.100 --> 03:27:49.300]  You couldn't go outside!
[03:27:49.300 --> 03:27:56.260]  Tie up those swings on the playgrounds, don't let those kids out, get them in the house!
[03:27:56.300 --> 03:28:10.859]  Look at this, arrogance, arrogant stupidity that destroyed the lives and livelihoods of
[03:28:10.859 --> 03:28:12.939]  billions of people around the planet.
[03:28:12.939 --> 03:28:18.699]  Hey, wait a minute, it says over here, according to the toilet paper record, that
[03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:31.280]  kept many people indoors where respiratory viruses spread more easily.
[03:28:31.280 --> 03:28:36.000]  Okay.
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:41.760]  In Columbia, Citizen Khalid, his or her house, the same number of days as the number on the
[03:28:41.760 --> 03:28:44.840]  person's national identity card.
[03:28:44.840 --> 03:28:48.080]  This is from the Trends Journal going back to April 14th.
[03:28:48.080 --> 03:28:50.360]  On and on.
[03:28:50.360 --> 03:28:52.960]  They locked us up for stupidity and arrogance.
[03:28:52.960 --> 03:28:57.240]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:57.240 --> 03:29:02.640]  We finally have our original best selling colloidal silver back in stock.
[03:29:02.640 --> 03:29:07.240]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems the economy, we could not get the
[03:29:07.240 --> 03:29:12.280]  highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[03:29:12.280 --> 03:29:16.280]  But now we've got it 30 parts per million from the top lab.
[03:29:16.280 --> 03:29:17.280]  We got a limited shipment.

[03:30:26.320 --> 03:30:30.040]  But these really are amazing products, the big July 4th sale's going on right now.
[03:30:30.040 --> 03:30:32.600]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[03:30:32.600 --> 03:30:36.120]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated, people are listening more than ever, but
[03:30:36.120 --> 03:30:40.320]  in this major recession, going into depression, and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's
[03:30:40.320 --> 03:30:42.040]  hard, I know times are tough.
[03:30:42.040 --> 03:30:45.640]  So thank you for your support, but whatever you do, pray for the broadcast, and share
[03:30:45.640 --> 03:30:49.680]  the articles and the videos, that you can do for free, and that's just as important
[03:30:49.680 --> 03:30:50.760]  as keeping us on air.
[03:30:50.760 --> 03:30:54.240]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now, and I thank
[03:30:54.240 --> 03:30:56.520]  you from the bottom of my heart, God bless you.
[03:30:56.520 --> 03:31:01.160]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots, or the electromagnetic 5G,
[03:31:01.160 --> 03:31:07.200]  or the GMO crops, they're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized
[03:31:07.200 --> 03:31:09.360]  companies and industry to use.
[03:31:09.360 --> 03:31:12.680]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[03:31:12.680 --> 03:31:16.360]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[03:31:16.360 --> 03:31:21.920]  is enough to sterilize you, and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:31:21.920 --> 03:31:23.080]  Look it up.
[03:31:23.080 --> 03:31:24.320]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[03:31:24.320 --> 03:31:27.520]  We have the very best gravity fed filter system out there.

[03:31:41.120 --> 03:31:45.720]  it, tap water, well water, almost everything's contaminated, this is how you take control
[03:31:45.720 --> 03:31:48.560]  of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[03:32:22.040 --> 03:32:26.640]  1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[03:32:26.640 --> 03:32:31.680]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing best, producing and
[03:32:31.680 --> 03:32:33.440]  making the MyPillow.
[03:32:33.440 --> 03:32:40.600]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how using the money for Americana
[03:32:40.600 --> 03:32:43.080]  freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[03:32:43.080 --> 03:32:44.600]  That's what the debanking is about.
[03:32:44.600 --> 03:32:46.400]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[03:32:46.400 --> 03:32:51.160]  That's why we've got a rush to support MyPillow.com and Infowars.com, plus their great products
[03:32:51.160 --> 03:32:58.000]  at both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[03:32:58.000 --> 03:33:04.040]  Defeating a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.500 --> 03:33:33.860]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:33:34.860 --> 03:33:45.860]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show, and as I keep saying, do everything you can to support InfoWars, because InfoWars is doing everything they can to support you.
[03:33:45.860 --> 03:33:54.860]  We have a great line of products, and we'll talk more about them later on, but you know where to go, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsStore.com, to get more of what you need.
[03:33:54.860 --> 03:33:58.860]  You help yourself, and you help InfoWars. It's a 360 win.
[03:33:58.860 --> 03:34:02.860]  I want to stay on this. This is very important. I'm the only person talking about this.
[03:34:02.860 --> 03:34:06.860]  This is an article, again, from the New York Times last week.
[03:34:08.400 --> 03:34:10.400]  This is in ancient history.
[03:34:10.400 --> 03:34:16.400]  Epidemiologists cited several factors contributing to rising transmission,
[03:34:16.400 --> 03:34:22.400]  including a few days of scorching heat that kept many people indoors,
[03:34:22.400 --> 03:34:26.400]  where respiratory viruses spread more easily.
[03:34:26.400 --> 03:34:30.400]  Yet they locked us down, and the people followed.
[03:34:30.400 --> 03:34:34.400]  Again, in trend forecasting, it's globalnomic, all things are connected.
[03:34:35.400 --> 03:34:39.400]  I'm talking about the COVID war to show you how the people followed
[03:34:39.400 --> 03:34:43.400]  moronic, imbecile, arrogant little boys and girls
[03:34:43.400 --> 03:34:47.400]  rather than think for themselves,
[03:34:47.400 --> 03:34:52.400]  rather than believing in truth and freedom.
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:59.520]  And the same thing is going to happen with the Ukraine war.
[03:34:59.520 --> 03:35:06.600]  I want to stay on this COVID scam because again, they forced us to lock down 97% of
[03:35:06.600 --> 03:35:11.000]  America at one time was locked down.
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:14.120]  We go on this Cuomo thing.
[03:35:14.120 --> 03:35:19.680]  A lot of people have been arguing where they come from and where they should be focusing.
[03:35:19.680 --> 03:35:22.720]  But if you notice, 18% of the people came from nursing homes.
[03:35:22.720 --> 03:35:23.720]  Oh yeah.
[03:35:23.720 --> 03:35:24.720]  How about Cuomo?
[03:35:24.720 --> 03:35:27.360]  How about the people that you killed?
[03:35:27.360 --> 03:35:28.640]  Yeah.
[03:35:28.640 --> 03:35:32.780]  The people that had COVID and you took them out of the hospitals and you put them in nursing
[03:35:32.780 --> 03:35:33.780]  homes.
[03:35:33.780 --> 03:35:37.280]  The people that was sick that you took, the elderly that were in nursing homes, excuse
[03:35:37.280 --> 03:35:41.000]  me, the elderly that were in the hospital that were in nursing homes, you threw them
[03:35:41.000 --> 03:35:44.720]  out of hospitals and put them back in nursing homes.
[03:35:44.720 --> 03:35:51.960]  This is the, this is the Andy Cuomo that got an Emmy award for BS-ing so great.
[03:35:51.960 --> 03:35:56.600]  He fits right in with the Hollywood clan of clowns.
[03:35:56.600 --> 03:35:59.520]  They loved him.
[03:35:59.520 --> 03:36:06.440]  He goes on, 2% came, 1% came from jail or prison and wait a minute, they're all locked
[03:36:06.440 --> 03:36:07.680]  up in that prison.
[03:36:07.680 --> 03:36:14.280]  They should be getting COVID like crazy, but anyway, 2% came from homeless population.
[03:36:14.840 --> 03:36:18.760]  66% of the people were in home, which is shocking to us.
[03:36:18.760 --> 03:36:20.800]  Oh, shocking to us.
[03:36:20.800 --> 03:36:23.220]  We know everything.
[03:36:23.220 --> 03:36:25.880]  So this is shocking to us.
[03:36:25.880 --> 03:36:31.360]  We're such arrogant, arrogant, ignorant, narcissistic freaks.
[03:36:31.360 --> 03:36:35.240]  Why would the facts bother us at all?
[03:36:35.300 --> 03:36:38.300]  You ready?
[03:36:38.300 --> 03:36:48.099]  Indeed, with two-thirds of those going to the hospital having obeyed his restrictions,
[03:36:48.099 --> 03:36:57.179]  the evidence contradicts his 13 April proclamation, quote, if you isolate, if you take precautions,
[03:36:57.179 --> 03:36:59.500]  your family won't get infected.
[03:37:00.380 --> 03:37:08.859]  Hey, Gatson, hey, Gatson, they did isolate, and they did get infected, because when you're out
[03:37:08.859 --> 03:37:17.099]  in the fresh air, getting healthy and strong, you don't get infected, but you closed down New York
[03:37:17.099 --> 03:37:26.779]  City, and you created, along with that other arrogant, slobby jerk, Warren Wilhelm Jr.,
[03:37:27.259 --> 03:37:35.500]  who changed his name to Bill de Blasio to get the Italian-American vote, because they were so stupid
[03:37:35.500 --> 03:37:44.859]  to vote for him, too, you locked down everything. You ready? Quote, this is Cuomo, we thought maybe
[03:37:44.859 --> 03:37:50.140]  that we were taking public transportation, and we've taken special precautions on public
[03:37:50.140 --> 03:37:56.539]  transportation, oh, special precautions, you gotta sit six feet apart, you gotta be six feet apart,
[03:37:56.779 --> 03:38:03.660]  because the wind blows directly in six feet straight lines, precautions, you're arrogant
[03:38:03.660 --> 03:38:11.019]  little freaks, and the people follow, they follow the freaks, they follow the freaks,
[03:38:11.019 --> 03:38:17.420]  they follow Lindsey Graham, they follow Mitch McConnell, they follow Diane out of her mind,
[03:38:17.420 --> 03:38:25.500]  not so Feinstein, they love Chucky Schumer, more on Mitch McConnell, out of his head, Biden.
[03:38:26.900 --> 03:38:36.900]  We thought maybe they were taking public transportation, and we've taken precautions on public transportation, but actually no, because these people were literally at home.
[03:38:36.900 --> 03:38:39.900]  Yep, literally at home.
[03:38:40.900 --> 03:38:42.900]  And we write our trend post.
[03:38:42.900 --> 03:38:45.900]  As for King Cuomo's divine wisdom, stay at home.
[03:38:45.900 --> 03:38:55.900]  Dr. Joseph Carr, an authority on population and global health at Nanyang Technology University in Singapore, stated, quote.
[03:38:55.900 --> 03:39:06.900]  People living indoors with enclosed environments may promote virus recirculation, increasing the chance of contracting the disease.
[03:39:06.900 --> 03:39:11.900]  But yet they forced us to stay home and the people did it.
[03:39:11.900 --> 03:39:13.900]  Yep.
[03:39:13.900 --> 03:39:21.900]  We write in the Trends Journal, across the globe from prime ministers, presidents, chancellors, governors, mayors, to village leaders.
[03:39:23.400 --> 03:39:28.400]  The eyes have it, you must follow what they're doing.
[03:39:28.400 --> 03:39:33.400]  In Serbia, the government has banned dog walking at 5 p.m.
[03:39:33.400 --> 03:39:42.400]  What else? In New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has told citizens to behave as if they have the coronavirus,
[03:39:42.400 --> 03:39:48.400]  eliminating all physical contact with anyone outside the house or living space.
[03:39:48.400 --> 03:39:51.400]  Yep, stay in the house and get the virus.
[03:39:51.400 --> 03:39:57.400]  As of Saturday, four people had died from the virus in a country of 4,800,000.
[03:39:57.400 --> 03:40:00.400]  Four people dead, and this is what they did.
[03:40:00.400 --> 03:40:03.400]  In the United States, you ready for this?
[03:40:03.400 --> 03:40:12.400]  Arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, arrogant Fauci fraud who gave us the AIDS scare.
[03:40:12.400 --> 03:40:16.400]  That little lousy freak. You ready for this?
[03:40:16.400 --> 03:40:22.400]  And you better, you better do what Fauci says.
[03:40:22.400 --> 03:40:28.400]  In the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the health official, the mainstream media,
[03:40:28.400 --> 03:40:35.400]  anointed America's, quote, most trusted voice, end quote, stated Wednesday, quote,
[03:40:35.400 --> 03:40:39.400]  I don't think we should shake hands ever again.
[03:40:40.600 --> 03:40:45.600]  Don't shake anybody's hand.
[03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:49.600]  He also recommended compulsive handwashing.
[03:40:49.600 --> 03:40:57.600]  Hey Fauci, remember, every time you masturbate, don't forget to sanitize your hands.
[03:40:58.300 --> 03:41:03.300]  These are the freaks telling us what to do.
[03:41:03.300 --> 03:41:09.300]  Last Thursday, Michigan, in Michigan, Her Royal Highness Governor Gretchen Whitmer
[03:41:09.300 --> 03:41:15.300]  ordered that citizens, as we say, a.k.a. slaves of the state, you ready,
[03:41:15.300 --> 03:41:19.300]  are not permitted to walk across the street to visit friends,
[03:41:19.300 --> 03:41:26.300]  or drive within their state to see relatives, or to visit one's cottage up north.
[03:41:26.300 --> 03:41:31.300]  She has allowed attending a funeral with no more than 10 people.
[03:41:31.300 --> 03:41:40.300]  I am in charge, only 10 people, not 11, not 12.
[03:41:40.300 --> 03:41:46.300]  Look at the freak show, look at the freak show.
[03:41:46.200 --> 03:41:51.200]  Yep.
[03:41:51.100 --> 03:42:01.960]  In Connecticut, Governor Ted Lamont, another arrogant little boy, signed an executive order
[03:42:01.960 --> 03:42:07.740]  to extend shutting down of schools, restaurants, bars, retails, stores, gyms, and other non-essential
[03:42:07.740 --> 03:42:09.740]  businesses for six weeks.
[03:42:09.740 --> 03:42:12.780]  I say seven weeks!
[03:42:12.780 --> 03:42:14.780]  Six weeks is wrong!
[03:42:14.780 --> 03:42:17.140]  Oh, non-essential businesses?
[03:42:17.140 --> 03:42:25.620]  Hey, Walmart could stay open, Target could stay open, but all you little plantation workers
[03:42:25.620 --> 03:42:28.340]  of Slavelandia, close your business.
[03:42:28.340 --> 03:42:30.460]  I'm the governor!
[03:42:30.460 --> 03:42:34.860]  I'm the slimeball in charge!
[03:42:34.860 --> 03:42:37.460]  Hey, politicians.
[03:42:37.460 --> 03:42:38.460]  You got it?
[03:42:38.460 --> 03:42:39.460]  Here's our shirt.
[03:42:39.460 --> 03:42:44.180]  Who the eff are you to tell me what to do?
[03:42:44.180 --> 03:42:45.180]  Hey, politicians.
[03:42:45.180 --> 03:42:46.180]  That's right.
[03:42:46.180 --> 03:42:53.860]  You get these at TrendsJournal.com, go to the shop, and we get back when we talk about
[03:42:53.860 --> 03:42:54.860]  the economy.
[03:42:54.860 --> 03:42:56.660]  They're ruining us.
[03:42:56.660 --> 03:43:01.100]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God, through Mother Nature, has given us the
[03:43:01.100 --> 03:43:02.100]  answer.
[03:43:02.100 --> 03:43:06.300]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it
[03:43:06.300 --> 03:43:11.940]  does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system, for your nervous system
[03:43:11.940 --> 03:43:12.940]  particularly.
[03:43:12.980 --> 03:43:14.980]  Everybody knows it's incredible it works.
[03:43:14.980 --> 03:43:19.820]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[03:43:19.820 --> 03:43:26.660]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from.
[03:43:26.660 --> 03:43:29.300]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[03:43:29.300 --> 03:43:32.940]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[03:43:32.940 --> 03:43:38.540]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[03:43:38.540 --> 03:43:41.540]  It's based right here in Texas, and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[03:43:41.540 --> 03:43:45.180]  Theirs was even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[03:43:45.180 --> 03:43:48.500]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[03:43:48.500 --> 03:43:52.900]  This is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[03:43:52.900 --> 03:43:56.380]  Rebel Zen, get yours at InfoWareStore.com now.
[03:43:56.380 --> 03:44:02.660]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[03:44:02.660 --> 03:44:03.780]  the atmosphere.
[03:44:03.780 --> 03:44:06.580]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:44:06.580 --> 03:44:12.940]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[03:44:12.940 --> 03:44:17.380]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[03:44:17.380 --> 03:44:22.180]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to
[03:44:22.180 --> 03:44:23.300]  dispose of it.
[03:44:23.300 --> 03:44:28.220]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who
[03:44:28.220 --> 03:44:31.700]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[03:44:31.700 --> 03:44:38.220]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[03:44:38.220 --> 03:44:40.620]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:44:40.620 --> 03:44:45.860]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:44:45.860 --> 03:44:52.300]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.

[03:45:53.180 --> 03:45:56.260]  the fight.
[03:45:56.260 --> 03:45:57.980]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:45:57.980 --> 03:46:01.700]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be
[03:46:01.700 --> 03:46:02.700]  defeated.
[03:46:02.700 --> 03:46:05.700]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:46:05.700 --> 03:46:09.820]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[03:46:09.820 --> 03:46:13.900]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.

[03:46:17.500 --> 03:46:19.700]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.

[03:46:22.380 --> 03:46:26.660]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:46:26.660 --> 03:46:28.980]  This is what I use, which my family uses.

[03:46:45.860 --> 03:46:49.660]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from
[03:46:49.660 --> 03:46:52.220]  hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:46:52.220 --> 03:46:54.860]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[03:46:55.800 --> 03:47:04.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.900 --> 03:47:24.900]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Celente, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.

[03:48:58.900 --> 03:49:00.900]  Isn't that nice? Forever Chemicals.
[03:49:00.900 --> 03:49:01.900]  Are you worried about climate change?
[03:49:01.900 --> 03:49:05.900]  How about all the poisons they put in our food, in our water, and in the air?
[03:49:05.900 --> 03:49:07.900]  Oh yeah, don't worry about that.
[03:49:07.900 --> 03:49:08.900]  Hey, the pigs could do it.
[03:49:08.900 --> 03:49:11.900]  They pay off the politicians with the only thing we want.

[03:49:28.900 --> 03:49:33.699]  All right.
[03:49:33.699 --> 03:49:42.220]  As we move on, I'm telling you about this COVID lockdown and how it was a total farce.
[03:49:42.220 --> 03:49:50.480]  And I read you the article from the New York Times that the chances of getting COVID greatly
[03:49:50.480 --> 03:49:53.539]  increase when you're locked inside.
[03:49:53.539 --> 03:49:55.260]  Facts are there.
[03:49:55.260 --> 03:50:00.100]  This is what went on during the COVID war, and I'm saying this because just as the people
[03:50:00.100 --> 03:50:05.140]  marched off to the COVID war, they're going to march off to World War III, which has already
[03:50:05.140 --> 03:50:07.580]  begun.
[03:50:07.580 --> 03:50:11.500]  I am one of the most hated people up here in Kingston, New York.
[03:50:11.500 --> 03:50:16.380]  When I had the Freedom Rally, when everything was locked down in July, and I said to little
[03:50:16.380 --> 03:50:20.220]  Andy Cuomo, come over here and try to stop me from having the rally.
[03:50:21.300 --> 03:50:23.300]  And we all died from having the rally.
[03:50:25.300 --> 03:50:28.300]  I'm so hated because I'm a man of freedom.
[03:50:29.300 --> 03:50:39.300]  And I don't swallow political crap like all the little morons and imbeciles are still in kindergarten and having graduated, swallow the crap.
[03:50:39.300 --> 03:50:46.300]  So anyway, this is going on from back in the day.
[03:50:47.300 --> 03:50:56.300]  In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf added stay at home orders on nine counties above the 10 already.
[03:50:57.300 --> 03:50:59.300]  For a total of 19 counties.
[03:51:00.300 --> 03:51:03.300]  And you know who the health commissioner was over there?
[03:51:03.300 --> 03:51:05.300]  The health commissioner was over there.
[03:51:06.800 --> 03:51:08.800]  Yeah.
[03:51:08.800 --> 03:51:10.800]  A guy with more chins than Chinatown.
[03:51:10.800 --> 03:51:12.800]  Oh, not a guy. I forgot.
[03:51:12.800 --> 03:51:14.800]  It's Rachel now.
[03:51:14.800 --> 03:51:17.800]  It used to be Lola.
[03:51:17.800 --> 03:51:19.800]  L-O-L-A, Lola.
[03:51:19.800 --> 03:51:21.800]  Rachel Levin.
[03:51:21.800 --> 03:51:25.800]  Oh, yeah, the commissioner now of the United States
[03:51:25.800 --> 03:51:29.800]  with all her drag on and on the top curl
[03:51:29.800 --> 03:51:31.800]  telling you what to do.
[03:51:31.800 --> 03:51:33.800]  Yeah, that.
[03:51:33.800 --> 03:51:35.800]  That Pennsylvania.
[03:51:35.500 --> 03:51:51.100]  Fetterman, Pennsylvania, the guy, yeah, he dresses like a slob, the senator, that Pennsylvania.
[03:51:51.100 --> 03:51:52.100]  You ready?
[03:51:52.100 --> 03:51:58.540]  New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, Goldman Sachs boy, you know, that arrogant little clown
[03:51:58.540 --> 03:52:05.420]  of nothing, stated, again, this is why, look at this guy, people voted for him.
[03:52:06.420 --> 03:52:10.100]  You want to see how stupid America is?
[03:52:10.100 --> 03:52:13.180]  Just look at who you vote for.
[03:52:13.180 --> 03:52:13.860]  You ready for this?
[03:52:13.900 --> 03:52:22.380]  Governor Phil Murphy, a little boy of nothing, established the following law, quote, conviction
[03:52:22.380 --> 03:52:29.260]  for violating the coronavirus lockdown can result into six months in jail and a fine up
[03:52:29.260 --> 03:52:31.699]  to $1,000.
[03:52:31.699 --> 03:52:37.900]  The conviction will also result in a criminal record that could impact employment, as well
[03:52:37.900 --> 03:52:41.740]  as limit housing and educational opportunities for years.
[03:52:41.980 --> 03:52:48.460]  Look at this little piece of scum ordering that mandate.
[03:52:48.460 --> 03:52:59.020]  I am not in Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, you scumbag.
[03:52:59.020 --> 03:53:02.779]  I'm a Goldman Sachs guy, Salenti.
[03:53:02.779 --> 03:53:06.500]  You're only a little wop from the Bronx.
[03:53:06.500 --> 03:53:08.619]  You're a nobody.
[03:53:08.619 --> 03:53:10.779]  I'm a member of the club.
[03:53:12.000 --> 03:53:20.000]  People follow the orders of these slimy little lowlifes.
[03:53:20.000 --> 03:53:23.000]  Look at that guy Wolf from Pennsylvania.
[03:53:23.000 --> 03:53:24.000]  What wolf?
[03:53:24.000 --> 03:53:29.000]  The guy has a pecker smaller than a puppy dog.
[03:53:29.000 --> 03:53:30.000]  Wolf.
[03:53:30.000 --> 03:53:31.000]  Wolf.
[03:53:31.300 --> 03:53:34.300]  You ready?
[03:53:34.500 --> 03:53:44.340]  As proven in nations ruled by dictatorial governments, from Hitler's Germany to the
[03:53:44.340 --> 03:53:45.340]  Soviet Union.
[03:53:45.340 --> 03:53:55.900]  Again, this is from your Trends Journal, going back to April 2020, writing this.
[03:53:55.900 --> 03:54:02.500]  From Hitler's Germany to the Soviet Union, the supreme powers stayed in power with the
[03:54:02.500 --> 03:54:09.940]  loyal assistance of their loyal followers below with a lust for power.
[03:54:09.940 --> 03:54:17.620]  Today, similar to back then, the little people rat out those disobeying the rules of law
[03:54:17.620 --> 03:54:20.340]  they were obediently taught to obey.
[03:54:20.340 --> 03:54:25.580]  For example, not far from our Trends Research Institute headquarters in Colonial Kingston,
[03:54:25.580 --> 03:54:30.420]  New York, there have been reports in local newspapers of the police breaking up and
[03:54:30.420 --> 03:54:39.380]  fining people for disobeying social distance laws, quote, COVID-19, eight nabbed in Rockland
[03:54:39.380 --> 03:54:42.580]  for violating social distancing orders.
[03:54:42.580 --> 03:54:47.380]  Eight people have been arrested for violating the county's and state's social distancing
[03:54:47.380 --> 03:54:54.700]  order amid the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic with Ramapo police were advised of
[03:54:54.700 --> 03:54:56.180]  a gathering by a neighbor.
[03:54:56.300 --> 03:55:02.380]  The newspaper went on to encourage others.
[03:55:02.380 --> 03:55:04.779]  This is the Clarkstown Daily.
[03:55:04.779 --> 03:55:10.259]  We write, the loyal newspaper went on to encourage others to route out anyone breaking the social
[03:55:10.259 --> 03:55:11.740]  distancing laws.
[03:55:11.740 --> 03:55:18.400]  Quote, residents can report suspected violations to their local police or by filing a complaint
[03:55:18.400 --> 03:55:23.500]  at 1-833-789-0470.
[03:55:23.500 --> 03:55:27.099]  The spy and tell trend has gone worldwide.
[03:55:27.099 --> 03:55:32.179]  The general media promotes the words and deeds of politicians in charge, encouraging the
[03:55:32.179 --> 03:55:38.099]  general public to believe and support what they are told and report all those who disobey.
[03:55:38.099 --> 03:55:45.859]  This is clearly evidenced as well by the social media giants who blacklist and will
[03:55:45.859 --> 03:55:51.179]  shut off anyone posting information they find offensive to their way of thinking.
[03:55:51.300 --> 03:55:55.340]  All right, here we are again.
[03:55:55.340 --> 03:56:01.539]  I went to a rally, peace against humanity, and hardly anybody were there.
[03:56:01.539 --> 03:56:04.259]  They're taking us to war.
[03:56:04.259 --> 03:56:05.340]  And I make a very long story.
[03:56:05.340 --> 03:56:06.939]  I wish I could tell it more.
[03:56:06.939 --> 03:56:16.859]  And I didn't go to a memorial for John Perkins, who is my close combat teacher.
[03:56:16.900 --> 03:56:17.900]  None of them are my parents.
[03:56:17.900 --> 03:56:19.980]  No man changed my life more than him.
[03:56:21.100 --> 03:56:26.100]  And that's what we have to do. How are we going to win? We have to fight.
[03:56:26.100 --> 03:56:30.100]  No, not fight physically. Fight as a man or woman.
[03:56:30.100 --> 03:56:34.100]  Fight as a person who is born to be free.
[03:56:33.700 --> 03:56:42.500]  A person endowed with the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:56:43.500 --> 03:56:48.500]  I lost my fight when that nun beat me up in the fifth grade, broke my eardrum,
[03:56:48.500 --> 03:56:52.500]  perforated my middle ear, and left me back. I can never get my ears wet again.
[03:56:52.500 --> 03:56:56.500]  I used to go water skiing in the Hudson River. I lost my fight. I was the toughest kid.
[03:56:56.500 --> 03:57:02.500]  John Perkins brought it back to me. And I didn't go to the memorial service
[03:57:02.500 --> 03:57:07.500]  because I went to the rally to fight for peace and freedom.
[03:57:07.500 --> 03:57:11.500]  And if we don't join together to fight, we're finished.
[03:57:12.500 --> 03:57:16.500]  So please do what you can to support Occupy Peace.
[03:57:16.500 --> 03:57:21.500]  Put your money where your heart and mouth is and do something.
[03:57:21.500 --> 03:57:25.500]  We are on the verge of nuclear annihilation.
[03:57:25.500 --> 03:57:33.500]  Again, look at the clowns going to Ukraine, stealing billions of our dollars to keep murdering people.
[03:57:33.500 --> 03:57:36.500]  So it's up to you to make the change.
[03:57:36.500 --> 03:57:42.500]  United we stand, divided we die. And support Infowars because they're supporting you.
[03:57:42.500 --> 03:57:43.500]  Thank you.
[03:57:45.300 --> 03:57:50.300]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:57:50.300 --> 03:57:54.300]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress,
[03:57:54.300 --> 03:58:00.300]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[03:58:00.300 --> 03:58:05.300]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful vitamin-mineral fusion formula.

[03:58:46.300 --> 03:58:51.300]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[03:58:51.300 --> 03:58:53.300]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[03:58:53.300 --> 03:58:55.300]  So let me get this straight.
[03:58:55.300 --> 03:58:58.300]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document
[03:58:58.300 --> 03:59:00.300]  showing that during the Obama administration,
[03:59:00.300 --> 03:59:03.300]  Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter
[03:59:03.300 --> 03:59:07.300]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption,
[03:59:07.300 --> 03:59:09.300]  an event that Donald Trump looked into,
[03:59:09.300 --> 03:59:12.300]  sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[03:59:12.300 --> 03:59:15.300]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[03:59:15.300 --> 03:59:17.300]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop,
[03:59:17.300 --> 03:59:21.300]  which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[03:59:21.300 --> 03:59:25.300]  and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[03:59:25.300 --> 03:59:29.300]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents,
[03:59:29.300 --> 03:59:33.300]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016,
[03:59:33.300 --> 03:59:37.300]  when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump
[03:59:37.300 --> 03:59:41.300]  using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[03:59:41.300 --> 03:59:43.300]  Do I have that all straight?
[03:59:49.300 --> 03:59:54.300]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
