[00:00:04.997 --> 00:00:09.842]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.423]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.423 --> 00:00:12.965]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:17.169]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.233]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.948 --> 00:00:41.570]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on this Tuesday, the 10th day already of February 2015.
[00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.851]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.072]  We'll be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:46.072 --> 00:00:48.392]  I've had economist and analyst Mr. Dent on
[00:00:51.917 --> 00:01:05.225]  Usually every six months or so, but I've been having him on every few weeks as of late, Harry Dent, because so many of his specific predictions have been coming true on the economy.
[00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:13.210]  So I want to get an update from him, but do something we haven't done when he's been on with us, except I think once, and that is take phone calls.
[00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.635]  And I really will attempt to only have him talk for two segments ahead of opening the phones up, because I like the different angles and directions that
[00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:26.948]  Listeners take us with curveballs that I wouldn't have thought of.
[00:01:26.948 --> 00:01:30.550]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.871]  Before we go any further...
[00:01:33.147 --> 00:01:50.923]  Obviously, we've got some special reports that the crew put together on the push for forced inoculation, the facts that measles are something that hardly ever killed people, but the measles vaccine is one of the most deadly, tied to so many serious side effects, because they're not side effects.
[00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:54.427]  There's a larger social engineering mode to all this.
[00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:58.429]  Also, I think I'm going to get Joe Biggs in here.
[00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.489]  He doesn't even know this yet, but I'm saying it now.
[00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:17.373]  At 1.30 today, to look at a report that he filed over the weekend, I guess it would be Sunday evening, just minutes after a blast inside Ukraine destroyed a chemical plant.
[00:02:17.373 --> 00:02:22.474]  Now, I've grown up in Texas, so I've seen a lot of chemical plant explosions on the news.
[00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:23.814]  And I've seen them on the horizon.
[00:02:24.804 --> 00:02:30.046]  When I've been down in South Texas and one blew up and I was like 20 miles away and there was a mushroom cloud.
[00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:38.768]  So a chemical plant blowing up can look like a nuke, but they tend to keep burning and other things around them blow up.
[00:02:38.768 --> 00:02:42.969]  I'm not saying a tactical nuke went off in Ukraine.
[00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.250]  We simply asked the question.
[00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.071]  He called me up right after it happened and said, Hey, what's this look like to you?
[00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:54.013]  And I said, it looks like a oil refinery or a small nuke going off.
[00:02:55.245 --> 00:03:04.910]  Except the fires basically go out very, very quickly and it blew out windows 15 miles away and caught houses on fire five miles away, reportedly.
[00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:13.195]  So we've talked to some of our Ukrainian sources and talked to a lot of other people who are over there and they just say that it's not on the news there.
[00:03:14.301 --> 00:03:17.003]  And if it was being blamed on the Russians, you'd be hearing all about it.
[00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:20.646]  So I want to get Joe Biggs in here to go over where it's located.
[00:03:20.646 --> 00:03:33.756]  He'll have the maps for TV viewers, some of the back page articles, because the Russians have threatened to use tactical nukes if NATO armor enters into Ukraine and then goes in to directly engage Russian forces.
[00:03:33.756 --> 00:03:36.498]  In fact, that's back in the news today.
[00:03:36.498 --> 00:03:38.300]  The Russians have a public doctrine
[00:03:39.707 --> 00:03:56.340]  That if weapons are brought up to their borders, or start engaging what they see as basically ethnic Russians that have a right to break away, that they're going to start using heavier weapons.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:05.347]  Back in 2008, their chairman of their Joint Chiefs of Staff, after the West started an invasion of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and North Georgia,
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.690]  Russia held areas for more than 500 years.
[00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.494]  Once they started invading that area...
[00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.041]  The Russians poured in, pushed back the forces.
[00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:21.948]  NATO began to land troop carriers and tank carriers in southern Georgia and so the Russians just made the announcement.
[00:04:21.948 --> 00:04:26.972]  We're stopping our tanks and we're moving tactical nukes in and medium range.
[00:04:26.972 --> 00:04:38.443]  We're preparing to first attack your forces with tactical nuclear weapons and then we will hit NATO sites with medium range multiple warhead MIRV missiles.
[00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:53.305]  I say that because they're not long-range missiles, but they have MIRV technology where even though it only shoots 500 to 1,000 miles, it pops up and it shoots a bunch of warheads, so it's very hard to shoot down with anti-missile systems.
[00:04:53.305 --> 00:04:55.227]  So, this could be going on.
[00:04:55.227 --> 00:04:55.588]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.857 --> 00:05:03.478]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:03.478 --> 00:05:09.820]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.

[00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.581]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:36.863]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:36.863 --> 00:05:38.644]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:38.644 --> 00:05:46.509]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:47.650]  But for how long?

[00:05:54.293 --> 00:05:57.115]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:07.572]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[00:06:07.572 --> 00:06:14.160]  NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.143]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:19.784]  population could perish.
[00:06:19.784 --> 00:06:23.266]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:25.508]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[00:06:25.508 --> 00:06:27.149]  Mass riots will follow.
[00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:29.331]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:33.414]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?

[00:08:13.138 --> 00:08:19.707]  You are a programmable guy that goes and watches Olympus is Falling, and believes all this, and really thinks you're a hero!
[00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:20.367]  G.I.
[00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:22.670]  Joe, great American hero!
[00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.872]  Yo, Joe!
[00:08:23.872 --> 00:08:25.314]  You don't work for Joe!
[00:08:25.314 --> 00:08:27.336]  Joe got taken over!
[00:08:27.336 --> 00:08:27.917]  The G.I.
[00:08:27.917 --> 00:08:30.480]  Joe Command Base is run by Cobra!
[00:08:31.281 --> 00:08:32.482]  You understand that?
[00:08:32.482 --> 00:08:37.663]  And I use a child analogy to get through to you because that's your main programming template in North America.
[00:08:37.663 --> 00:08:39.044]  They're on record with that.
[00:08:39.044 --> 00:08:41.105]  That was all Pentagon directed.
[00:08:41.105 --> 00:08:42.945]  You understand you work for Cobra.
[00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:44.426]  You dress like Cobra.
[00:08:44.426 --> 00:08:46.086]  You have the tactics of Cobra.
[00:08:46.086 --> 00:08:47.367]  You are Cobra.
[00:08:47.367 --> 00:08:49.288]  Hail Cobra!
[00:08:49.288 --> 00:08:51.068]  You want to be little boys?
[00:08:51.068 --> 00:08:52.749]  Or you want to really join the Republic?
[00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:58.413]  They know what's going on at the Bundy Ranch, and they won't even let a police information officer give us any information.
[00:08:58.413 --> 00:08:59.674]  That's a bunch of bull****.
[00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:01.035]  It's all these stupid G.I.
[00:09:01.035 --> 00:09:03.917]  Joe movies and stuff, where the White House is attacked.
[00:09:03.917 --> 00:09:06.179]  The White House is run by Cobra!
[00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:14.245]  When I went through the process of becoming press secretary, one of the things, one of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[00:09:14.245 --> 00:09:17.208]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:18.829]  It's run by chaos.
[00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:19.950]  It's run by Spectre.
[00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:26.153]  Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.
[00:09:26.153 --> 00:09:29.975]  They run little kids, they run the snuff films, they run the drugs, they run it all!
[00:09:29.975 --> 00:09:34.958]  And because you act like a bunch of naive chumps, this whole thing's gonna come down on us!
[00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:40.721]  Very much concerns me, considering that they have all this bulk ammunition, that they're shooting targets of children.
[00:09:41.261 --> 00:09:43.862]  Would you like to tell me who it is that is doing this?
[00:09:43.862 --> 00:09:46.423]  It is the Department of Homeland Security, sir.
[00:09:46.423 --> 00:09:48.384]  Oh, thank you for calling.
[00:09:48.384 --> 00:09:54.526]  To every police officer in this country, to every FBI agent, to every Secret Service agent, you work for Spectre.
[00:09:54.526 --> 00:09:55.846]  You work for Chaos.
[00:09:55.846 --> 00:10:00.888]  You work for Cobra.
[00:10:00.888 --> 00:10:01.948]  How do they get power?
[00:10:01.948 --> 00:10:06.370]  They stage a terror attack using Spectre, using Cobra.
[00:10:10.697 --> 00:10:11.917]  Go f*** yourself.
[00:10:11.917 --> 00:10:12.698]  Who is COBRA?
[00:10:12.698 --> 00:10:16.499]  Arms dealing, drug dealing, money laundering group, wearing masks.
[00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:21.040]  They wear masks, ladies and gentlemen, because they're the corporate CEOs.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.821]  And they're manipulating the governments against each other.
[00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:25.361]  COBRA runs the Muslims.
[00:10:25.361 --> 00:10:27.182]  COBRA runs the CIA.
[00:10:27.182 --> 00:10:28.582]  COBRA runs it all.
[00:10:28.582 --> 00:10:30.062]  COBRA is real.
[00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:31.543]  You can call it whatever you want.
[00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.972]  Cobra is in control of America.
[00:10:34.972 --> 00:10:40.997]  And Cobra says the veterans and the gun owners, they're saying that we're the bad guys.
[00:10:40.997 --> 00:10:46.362]  These people who hold themselves down to be patriots are not.
[00:10:46.362 --> 00:10:48.844]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[00:10:48.844 --> 00:10:50.486]  That's what Cobra would say.
[00:10:50.486 --> 00:10:52.227]  That's what Specter would say.
[00:10:52.227 --> 00:10:54.009]  That's what Goldfinger would say.
[00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:56.011]  Because that's who those people are.
[00:10:56.711 --> 00:11:01.296]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:11:01.296 --> 00:11:06.662]  You call your petty bureaucrats officials and authorities?
[00:11:06.662 --> 00:11:10.567]  You will kneel before Cobra of Faith!
[00:11:12.808 --> 00:11:16.912]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:11:16.912 --> 00:11:19.434]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:11:19.434 --> 00:11:22.397]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Cobra.
[00:11:22.397 --> 00:11:24.739]  You pathetic little worm!
[00:11:24.739 --> 00:11:27.402]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.573]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:11:37.573 --> 00:11:47.699]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be again broadcasting for the next three hours.
[00:11:47.699 --> 00:11:57.446]  I'm going to get Kit Daniels to pop in in about 20 minutes to go over a story he's written that's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:00.694 --> 00:12:08.400]  Where we have a feminist coming out and saying, I aborted my baby because he was male.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.444]  Feminist said she didn't want to bring another monster into the world.
[00:12:13.444 --> 00:12:15.846]  So we're going to be breaking that report down.
[00:12:15.846 --> 00:12:23.633]  Meanwhile, AP has the story, Ohio girl 11 charged with murder in two month old's death.
[00:12:25.928 --> 00:12:31.130]  Ohio girl 11 charged with murder in two-month-old's death killed another girl.
[00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.872]  How could it be that a girl could kill a girl or do something wrong?
[00:12:34.872 --> 00:12:51.660]  This idea that men and women aren't the same species, that we aren't on the same team, and they somehow turn chivalry on its head where they have men all over the world, but especially in the West, apologizing for being male as if we did something wrong.
[00:12:53.854 --> 00:13:04.323]  You don't see male meerkats apologizing, you don't see male whales apologizing, you don't see other mammals, mongooses apologizing.
[00:13:04.323 --> 00:13:10.869]  This is how aliens would take over a society, by turning men and women against each other to divide and conquer.
[00:13:10.869 --> 00:13:19.257]  And they sell it as chivalrous to hate yourself, chivalrous that men are bad and men are disempowered, as if disempowering men empowers women.
[00:13:21.258 --> 00:13:27.641]  Real men and real women that are healthy know that men build up women and women build up men.
[00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:31.163]  And that men love their daughters as much as they love their sons or more.
[00:13:31.163 --> 00:13:33.784]  And that women love their sons probably more than their daughters.
[00:13:34.872 --> 00:13:36.574]  That's usually how it turns out.
[00:13:36.574 --> 00:13:45.862]  Men, statistically, will end up doing more, giving more money, fighting harder for daughters, and mothers will end up fighting harder for sons.
[00:13:45.862 --> 00:13:50.666]  This is how it all balances out as a tribal system, a unit.
[00:13:50.666 --> 00:13:55.670]  But you annihilate the meerkat mound for wide open of the globalist cobras.
[00:13:56.371 --> 00:13:59.573]  To come and snack on us whenever they want, to use that allegory.
[00:13:59.573 --> 00:14:04.537]  When you break up the male and the female, there's no longer a nuclear nest.
[00:14:04.537 --> 00:14:10.821]  Now you're wide open for programming and globalist assimilation into the Google Borg.
[00:14:10.821 --> 00:14:13.723]  And that is the plan.
[00:14:13.723 --> 00:14:19.327]  But the good news is, folks are striking back in a big, big way.
[00:14:21.104 --> 00:14:22.064]  Governor Jindal.
[00:14:22.064 --> 00:14:24.185]  You can say what you want about Governor Jindal.
[00:14:24.185 --> 00:14:26.666]  The video's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:28.746]  It's a Daily Caller article.
[00:14:28.746 --> 00:14:32.147]  But what he's saying is very true and very accurate.
[00:14:32.147 --> 00:14:35.468]  Jindal unveils national plan to repeal Common Core.
[00:14:35.468 --> 00:14:37.809]  It's a three and a half minute clip.
[00:14:37.809 --> 00:14:39.229]  We're going to play it.
[00:14:39.229 --> 00:14:42.230]  Then we're going to get into all the other news.
[00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.451]  Things in Ukraine are really heating up.
[00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:46.212]  Did a newt go off?
[00:14:46.212 --> 00:14:47.913]  That's what some people think.
[00:14:47.913 --> 00:14:49.634]  We're going to look at that story.
[00:14:49.634 --> 00:14:51.896]  We're going to look at the economy.
[00:14:51.896 --> 00:14:54.758]  Record snow hitting the Northeast.
[00:14:54.758 --> 00:14:56.159]  Part of the global warming, they say.
[00:14:56.159 --> 00:14:57.961]  So again, pay Al Gore money.
[00:14:57.961 --> 00:14:59.742]  He'll fix all of it.
[00:14:59.742 --> 00:15:01.503]  We've got other bizarro story.
[00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:02.324]  Good news.
[00:15:02.324 --> 00:15:06.907]  Charges dismissed against man arrested for drinking iced tea.
[00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:09.129]  So that's coming up as well today.
[00:15:09.129 --> 00:15:14.233]  And if you listen carefully, the bankers are actually telling us what is going to happen next.
[00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:22.433]  And we've got Harry Dent joining us to look at the global economic collapse.
[00:15:22.433 --> 00:15:25.797]  More and more mainline analysts say it's imminent.
[00:15:25.797 --> 00:15:27.479]  Are you ready for the Dow at 6,000?
[00:15:27.479 --> 00:15:32.324]  I'm not saying it's going to happen, but most of the money is on that.
[00:15:32.324 --> 00:15:34.506]  The question is, when?
[00:15:34.506 --> 00:15:36.309]  And if you say, well, I don't own stock, why do I care?
[00:15:37.492 --> 00:15:42.196]  Because it's connected to every level of the economy and almost all these publicly traded companies.
[00:15:42.196 --> 00:15:49.141]  If the stock market goes from $18,000 or $19,000 down to $6,000, it is going to be just a huge event.
[00:15:49.141 --> 00:15:53.904]  We'll be like Spain or Greece or Ireland in deep, deep doo-doo.
[00:15:53.904 --> 00:15:59.889]  Ladies and gentlemen, we don't have the tourist industry in most areas of the country like Ireland or Greece or Spain do.
[00:16:00.925 --> 00:16:03.347]  I hate to say it, but the U.S.
[00:16:03.347 --> 00:16:07.930]  is not as interesting across the board as places like Ireland or Spain or Greece.
[00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:11.973]  We just don't have the tourist dollars they have, especially with our TSA and the rest of it.
[00:16:11.973 --> 00:16:14.915]  People are scared to come here, because we're not a free country in many respects.
[00:16:14.915 --> 00:16:16.716]  But I'm babbling.
[00:16:16.716 --> 00:16:22.480]  Let's go to some very exciting rhetoric from Governor Jindal.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:29.705]  We insist today that if people come into our country, they should respect the right of self-determination, religious liberty, and freedom of speech for others.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:39.507]  Yet some of these values aren't very fashionable, according to the elite that infect our media, our government, and certainly Washington, D.C.
[00:16:39.507 --> 00:16:41.989]  So my first point is this, and that transition is going to be my second.
[00:16:41.989 --> 00:16:42.790]  My first point is this.
[00:16:43.766 --> 00:16:53.249]  The whole point, the reason we have publicly funded education, as opposed to simply telling families, yes, this will help you earn more money, therefore you should go educate your children.
[00:16:53.249 --> 00:16:56.530]  There's nothing wrong with saying education is critical for an aspirational society.
[00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:03.533]  There's nothing wrong with saying education will help us develop our economy and improve our quality of life.
[00:17:03.533 --> 00:17:06.434]  But fundamentally, it is about self-governance.
[00:17:06.434 --> 00:17:12.436]  It's about teaching the next generation of citizens to be able to hire and fire their leaders to become those leaders.
[00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:31.269]  And we risk it all, that American exceptionalism, if we allow the elite, oftentimes unelected, behind closed doors with no transparency, to dictate to us how our children are going to learn about American history and civics and so many other topics that are so important to creating that citizenry with critical thinking.
[00:17:31.269 --> 00:17:32.451]  And that brings me to my second point.
[00:17:33.723 --> 00:17:48.815]  In our lifetimes, in the last five, six years, we have seen an overreach of government power that is unprecedented in our country's history, and I would argue to you that none of us, none of us, would have thought possible just a few short years ago.
[00:17:48.815 --> 00:17:50.176]  Now what do I mean by that?
[00:17:50.176 --> 00:17:59.543]  If I could travel through time and stand on this stage several years ago, and I said to you, do you really believe the IRS would go after conservative groups because of their beliefs?
[00:18:00.751 --> 00:18:04.073]  I don't think we would have thought that possible in our country.
[00:18:04.073 --> 00:18:09.996]  If I stood up here and said, do you really believe the Department of Justice is going to go and spy on AP reporters?
[00:18:09.996 --> 00:18:12.017]  I don't think we would have thought that possible.
[00:18:12.017 --> 00:18:19.701]  If I stood up here and said, do you really believe the same Department of Justice through Fast and Furious would be providing guns to Mexican drug cartels?
[00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:27.725]  Even while our administration seems to oppose the legal, the constitutional gun rights of law-abiding Americans.
[00:18:27.725 --> 00:18:29.626]  We would have thought that was possible.
[00:18:29.626 --> 00:18:48.917]  If I were standing on the stage and said, you really believe the Federal Department of Justice would try to sue, try to go to court in Louisiana to shut down a school choice program, where nearly 90% of the kids come from minority families, they all come from low-income families fleeing from schools getting C's, D's, or F's, supposedly on the grounds of integration.
[00:18:49.764 --> 00:18:56.307]  Supposedly, on the grounds of the same laws that were designed to protect the most disadvantaged students in our country.
[00:18:56.307 --> 00:18:57.847]  We wouldn't believe that.
[00:18:57.847 --> 00:19:04.370]  If I stood on this stage several years ago and said, do you really believe our federal government was going to create a new entitlement program and we can't afford the ones we've got?
[00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.792]  We're going to put government bureaucrats between you and your doctor in the form of Obamacare.
[00:19:08.792 --> 00:19:10.853]  We wouldn't believe that.
[00:19:10.853 --> 00:19:17.816]  So, I think parents are right to be skeptical and worried about an overreach by our federal government into our K-12 classrooms.
[00:19:18.598 --> 00:19:24.323]  Now our opponents would tell us, they would mock us and say, what do you have to worry about?
[00:19:24.323 --> 00:19:31.268]  But I would argue, after what we have seen, all the broken promises... Remember, we were told, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
[00:19:31.268 --> 00:19:33.590]  If you like your health plan, you can keep your health plan.
[00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.811]  Our premiums were supposed to go down, $2,500.
[00:19:34.811 --> 00:19:39.935]  And the reality is, we've seen broken promise after broken promise.
[00:19:39.935 --> 00:19:44.979]  We've seen an unprecedented expansion of government power, intrusion into our lives.
[00:19:44.979 --> 00:19:47.541]  Telling us how the elites think we should be living our lives.
[00:19:48.618 --> 00:19:54.009]  And by the way, as a side note, I do have just a message, because this is not just a criticism of Democrats.
[00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:54.951]  We're going to go to break.
[00:19:54.951 --> 00:19:57.616]  This is Powerful Speech, though the full speech is on Infowars.com.

[00:21:01.133 --> 00:21:04.638]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:10.727]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[00:21:10.727 --> 00:21:12.109]  I'm all about human potential.
[00:21:12.109 --> 00:21:14.232]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[00:21:14.332 --> 00:21:15.892]  The establishment is the opposite.
[00:21:15.892 --> 00:21:20.613]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:25.215]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.

[00:24:12.313 --> 00:24:15.695]  Coming at you live from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[00:24:15.695 --> 00:24:19.798]  Broadcasting worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:24:19.798 --> 00:24:22.660]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.201]  Coming up...
[00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:25.653]  I aired this just a week or so ago.
[00:24:25.653 --> 00:24:29.938]  We usually air these intros every few months because we've got dozens and dozens of them.
[00:24:29.938 --> 00:24:39.370]  But I'm going to air a little two and a half minute intro that Darren McBreen and David Knight put together.
[00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:58.044]  And this piece deals with Soylent Green and shows the mainstream news articles and medical journals where they say, let's start killing babies up to age three, let's start killing babies up to age five, even if they're healthy, let's start killing old people, let's put the troops on secret don't treat death list.
[00:24:58.044 --> 00:25:01.407]  I mean, all this is really going on.
[00:25:01.407 --> 00:25:07.853]  And to show how far we've come, it was five years ago that
[00:25:09.346 --> 00:25:18.931]  Paul Watson found the medical journal, there's the London Telegraph, Killing Babies No Different From Abortion, experts say, London Telegraph.
[00:25:18.931 --> 00:25:21.012]  That was four or five years ago.
[00:25:21.012 --> 00:25:22.733]  In fact, what was the date on that?
[00:25:22.733 --> 00:25:26.715]  Because they came out about four days after us in the Telegraph.
[00:25:26.715 --> 00:25:29.976]  So 2012, it was about three, four years ago.
[00:25:29.976 --> 00:25:35.059]  And back then, Paul Watson found the mainline journal, a listener sent us the tip,
[00:25:38.379 --> 00:25:50.544]  In the Journal of Bioethics, where they said, yeah, let's start killing kids up to age three and just make it the state or the parents' choice.
[00:25:50.544 --> 00:26:00.149]  And then so-called liberals came out, the BMJ blogs covered it, and were defending the publication of afterbirth abortion.
[00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:02.630]  And that was in the Journal of Medical Ethics.
[00:26:07.242 --> 00:26:13.604]  So when this first came out, for a good four, five, six days, onlydrugsreport.com linked to our story.
[00:26:13.604 --> 00:26:23.247]  Now, Drudge could go to our article, see it had a link to the Bioethics Journal, and that we told the truth.
[00:26:23.247 --> 00:26:32.150]  We were attacked by MSNBC, by a whole bunch of other publications, as liars, saying it wasn't true.
[00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.571]  Now, fast forward four years.
[00:26:36.172 --> 00:26:41.536]  And it's all over the news that, oh yeah, we should start aborting babies after birth.
[00:26:41.536 --> 00:26:42.597]  This is what's crazy.
[00:26:42.597 --> 00:26:51.264]  And then Joe Biggs goes and does a report at UT and gets half the respondents to sign a petition to start aborting kids up to age five.
[00:26:51.264 --> 00:27:01.252]  And they have the Austin American-Statesman, Fact Checker, and all those other publications do an article saying we're wrong, there is no move to start killing babies after birth.
[00:27:01.252 --> 00:27:03.133]  See, so they want it both ways.
[00:27:03.133 --> 00:27:05.355]  There is a world government, but there isn't a world government.
[00:27:06.618 --> 00:27:13.243]  Yes, vaccines can damage you, but that's a conspiracy theory they can't, even though the insert says it.
[00:27:13.243 --> 00:27:16.905]  They play these games, hoping you don't go look at the facts.
[00:27:16.905 --> 00:27:31.836]  So I've got all this world news I'm going to get to, but first I wanted to talk about this dehumanization, because when you go to the so-called feminist websites, these are anti-human websites.
[00:27:31.836 --> 00:27:32.997]  They've gotten women to hate
[00:27:34.414 --> 00:27:35.974]  Their own species.
[00:27:35.974 --> 00:27:38.015]  And to turn against their own species.
[00:27:38.015 --> 00:27:43.616]  And it's a cult of hating men and hating other women that they can't control.
[00:27:43.616 --> 00:27:56.078]  And it's a group of women given media power, you name it, university power, to sit up there and try to bully women into not being barefoot and pregnant.
[00:27:56.078 --> 00:28:01.219]  And by the way, if women want to be rocket scientists or engineers or PhDs, more power to you.
[00:28:01.219 --> 00:28:02.379]  There's always been women like that.
[00:28:03.379 --> 00:28:10.081]  But biologically, at least in certain times in women's lives, they want to be barefoot and pregnant.
[00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:12.721]  They're as happy as a pig and you know what?
[00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:20.843]  And daddy gets real happy, he gets real fat, the kids are happy, every statistic shows that's a very happy family.
[00:28:20.843 --> 00:28:24.784]  That's how humans have always been designed, that's what we do.
[00:28:24.784 --> 00:28:30.846]  And that's being dismantled by the same military industrial complex that told us cigarettes were good for our lungs.
[00:28:32.807 --> 00:28:35.071]  They're lying to us.
[00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:40.502]  But now the extrapolation ends up being, you can't say brown bag day, that's racist.
[00:28:40.502 --> 00:28:40.943]  You can't.
[00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:47.521]  Have men do good at sports or anybody win at sports because that makes somebody else feel bad.
[00:28:47.521 --> 00:28:55.563]  This is cult-like beyond Brave New World, beyond 1984, beyond the trial by Kafka.
[00:28:55.563 --> 00:29:10.308]  This is beyond the most hard core dystopic literature nightmares dreamed up by people that lived in the Soviet Union or were in the Soviet Union or who fought against the Soviet Union or who fought against or lived under fascism.
[00:29:11.499 --> 00:29:21.942]  Books like We and The Trial and 1984 come out of first-hand experiences of dehumanization.
[00:29:21.942 --> 00:29:29.144]  And if we can get women to ever wake up to this fact about how key they are to everything, they can re-empower humanity.
[00:29:29.144 --> 00:29:31.105]  But they've been sabotaged.
[00:29:31.105 --> 00:29:33.706]  Men have been sabotaged as well.
[00:29:33.706 --> 00:29:37.327]  And so if we can ever get women to realize the scientific mind control they're under,
[00:29:38.393 --> 00:29:40.595]  That might as well be deployed by an alien species.
[00:29:40.595 --> 00:29:42.356]  I mean, that's how scientific it is.
[00:29:42.356 --> 00:29:43.757]  Then we could save the human race.
[00:29:43.757 --> 00:29:45.878]  Because we're all in this together.
[00:29:45.878 --> 00:29:47.199]  It's more divide and conquer.
[00:29:47.199 --> 00:29:52.343]  We'll come back with that report on feminists wanting to kill their male children.
[00:29:58.922 --> 00:30:02.307]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[00:30:02.307 --> 00:30:05.832]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[00:30:05.832 --> 00:30:11.901]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[00:30:11.901 --> 00:30:13.303]  I'm all about human potential.
[00:30:13.303 --> 00:30:15.426]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[00:30:15.506 --> 00:30:17.067]  The establishment is the opposite.
[00:30:17.067 --> 00:30:21.871]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[00:30:21.871 --> 00:30:26.454]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[00:30:26.454 --> 00:30:29.116]  How we can come together and win the human race.

[00:32:04.969 --> 00:32:09.551]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[00:32:44.458 --> 00:32:49.620]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:10.643]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals.
[00:33:10.643 --> 00:33:14.825]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[00:33:14.825 --> 00:33:21.088]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[00:33:21.088 --> 00:33:26.410]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:30.252]  That is the secret of Soylent.
[00:33:31.073 --> 00:33:33.595]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[00:33:33.595 --> 00:33:36.238]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[00:33:36.238 --> 00:33:41.063]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[00:33:41.063 --> 00:33:44.086]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[00:33:44.086 --> 00:33:47.670]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.291]  You must evacuate the area.
[00:33:51.926 --> 00:34:04.458]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[00:34:04.458 --> 00:34:06.439]  So enjoy the flavor!
[00:34:06.439 --> 00:34:11.084]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[00:34:11.084 --> 00:34:13.046]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[00:34:13.046 --> 00:34:14.927]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[00:34:14.927 --> 00:34:16.228]  I'm for regular suicide.
[00:34:16.228 --> 00:34:17.830]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:22.394]  He is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient.
[00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:29.460]  Would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:33.844]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:34:33.844 --> 00:34:40.150]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.961]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[00:34:50.961 --> 00:34:55.862]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[00:34:55.862 --> 00:34:58.362]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[00:34:58.362 --> 00:35:07.724]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[00:35:07.724 --> 00:35:10.205]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[00:35:10.905 --> 00:35:13.046]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:35:13.046 --> 00:35:15.648]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:35:15.648 --> 00:35:18.789]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[00:35:18.789 --> 00:35:22.071]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[00:35:22.071 --> 00:35:25.493]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[00:35:25.493 --> 00:35:27.934]  We gotta stop them!
[00:35:27.934 --> 00:35:32.256]  It is the secret of Soylent Green.
[00:35:32.256 --> 00:35:34.737]  Soylent Green is people!
[00:35:34.737 --> 00:35:35.738]  Soon they'll be breeding us.
[00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:55.371]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, 10th day of February 2015 transmission.
[00:35:55.371 --> 00:36:10.034]  Now, I came in here this morning, saw the article that Kit Daniels had written dealing with feminist bragging that she had aborted her male baby after she saw the
[00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:19.481]  Ultrasound because he was, quote, a monster and that she wasn't going to bring another monster into the world.
[00:36:19.481 --> 00:36:25.945]  This shows the extremely sick, sick, sick mindset of these people.
[00:36:25.945 --> 00:36:38.454]  Now, it's important to understand that when you go read the article, Feminist, I Aborted My Baby Because He Was Male, and we link through to the feminist website pushing this, the so-called liberal website pushing this,
[00:36:40.171 --> 00:36:44.336]  That these are the people that say, turn your guns in, they're killing children.
[00:36:44.336 --> 00:36:47.619]  Let us have socialist healthcare, it's for the children.
[00:36:47.619 --> 00:36:56.709]  Do everything because we love you, and we are the ultimate level of compassion and authority, and all of you are guilty and bad.
[00:36:56.709 --> 00:37:02.155]  You're either male, or you're white, or you are middle class, or something.
[00:37:03.999 --> 00:37:08.241]  Or you're straight, or you're divide, divide, divide, divide and conquer.
[00:37:08.241 --> 00:37:14.744]  They are waging war on normal individual actions that are a threat to the globalist assimilation.
[00:37:14.744 --> 00:37:29.430]  They had the Canadian government study three years ago, where they found environmentalists were six times more likely to steal, to steal, than conservatives.
[00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:30.631]  And to not give to charity.
[00:37:32.435 --> 00:37:33.896]  Because they're not environmentalists.
[00:37:33.896 --> 00:37:40.439]  There are real environmentalists out there that care about our creeks and rivers and streams and oceans and forests.
[00:37:40.439 --> 00:37:41.659]  Those are called conservationists.
[00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:48.382]  Their movement's been hijacked by eugenicists who then make it all about how humans are bad and all these PSAs.
[00:37:48.382 --> 00:37:50.183]  Never, what do humans do that's good?
[00:37:50.183 --> 00:37:51.384]  What do humans do that's bad?
[00:37:52.384 --> 00:38:06.200]  Never a discussion of open-air GMO planting, never a discussion of tens of thousands of cross-species chimera creations that are now loose in the oceans, like these super salmon that within 40 generations will extinct the normal population, major university study.
[00:38:07.341 --> 00:38:09.982]  There are thousands of red level crisis.
[00:38:09.982 --> 00:38:21.047]  Fish infusion, artificial black holes, teleportation systems they're developing where they are teleporting molecules and things now.
[00:38:21.047 --> 00:38:30.591]  Where a lot of top scientists are openly warning it could cause a strangelet, a space rip, a black hole, and a whole host of other little nasties.
[00:38:31.511 --> 00:38:41.294]  Whole host of little nasties that we see coming out of the Hadron Superconducting Super Collider and other more classified facilities.
[00:38:41.294 --> 00:38:48.636]  So backing away from this, ladies and gentlemen, this is a group of anti-human trash.
[00:38:48.636 --> 00:38:53.497]  And just earlier I showed you the mainstream news article headlines and read them out on air for radio listeners.
[00:38:54.853 --> 00:38:55.353]  Where?
[00:38:55.353 --> 00:38:58.575]  Pepsi's flavoring system is based on dead babies.
[00:38:58.575 --> 00:39:00.617]  Most of the vaccines are made out of dead babies.
[00:39:00.617 --> 00:39:02.958]  That is, it's grown on dead baby tissue.
[00:39:02.958 --> 00:39:08.742]  And you're getting all the weird viruses and bacteria and DNA and RNA and mitochondrial mutations.
[00:39:08.742 --> 00:39:09.803]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:39:11.812 --> 00:39:19.475]  And you've just got this dehumanization going on where it's now a year old news that they've got secret death panels for veterans.
[00:39:19.475 --> 00:39:25.557]  And now they've got a computer called Watson from IBM deciding who gets care and who doesn't.
[00:39:25.557 --> 00:39:31.159]  So they go from denying it a year ago to going, yeah, we do have it, but don't worry, a computer makes the decision.
[00:39:31.159 --> 00:39:37.521]  Do you know what they called the machines they had in Nazi Germany?
[00:39:37.521 --> 00:39:38.781]  They were called three different things.
[00:39:38.781 --> 00:39:39.882]  They were called holleriths.
[00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:47.073]  They were called IBM and then it's number or they were called Watson's and the number of the machine.
[00:39:47.073 --> 00:39:51.495]  The death count machines were called Watson's.
[00:39:51.495 --> 00:39:53.617]  Can't make that up.
[00:39:53.617 --> 00:39:55.838]  Hollerith's, IBM's and Watson's.
[00:39:55.838 --> 00:39:58.279]  They were all IBM's.
[00:39:58.279 --> 00:39:59.700]  You can't make that up.
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:05.963]  And those machines, they put in your calories, your weight, your height, your age, and then it would decide, do we just shoot you right away?
[00:40:05.963 --> 00:40:07.584]  Do we starve you to death and work you to death?
[00:40:08.797 --> 00:40:19.039]  And they do all these quack measurements of your head and your nose and everything else and go, well, you're not a Slav or you're not a Jew or you're not something else.
[00:40:19.039 --> 00:40:22.600]  You're not, you know, Asian or African.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.161]  You know, this shows you're really an Aryan off your measurements.
[00:40:26.161 --> 00:40:27.161]  So we're not going to kill you.
[00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:35.983]  In fact, tens of thousands of Jews that were put in forced labor camps would then be reassigned because they, the machine said, don't kill them.
[00:40:37.659 --> 00:40:47.863]  Now, in 2015, it's been going on since 2014, there is a machine called Watson from the same company deciding which U.S.
[00:40:47.863 --> 00:40:51.804]  veterans to not give treatment to.
[00:40:51.804 --> 00:40:54.205]  Soylent Green is made out of people.
[00:40:54.205 --> 00:40:56.105]  But it's the hatred of humanity.
[00:40:56.105 --> 00:41:04.068]  It's one thing if the globalists have stolen the planet, and they think it's theirs, and they've been doing this for generations, they plan to slowly poison everybody, dumb us down, and then kill us.
[00:41:04.068 --> 00:41:06.489]  But the fact that they get fellow traveler women
[00:41:09.144 --> 00:41:18.230]  To come out and to say, I found out I was pregnant with a boy and I killed him because I'm not bringing a monster into the world.
[00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.891]  Well, lady, you're the monster.
[00:41:19.891 --> 00:41:38.124]  You're the mentally ill monster on such a hateful power trip that you, I mean, I have fought and fought and fought and Christians have fought and others have fought to make sure that 40 something million more, that's how many they've already aborted, in China or infanticided after they're born,
[00:41:39.895 --> 00:41:48.317]  It turned out it was an IMF-World Bank-UN program going on since the 50s to get the Chinese to sit there and cull their population.
[00:41:48.317 --> 00:41:51.898]  One child didn't really start in the 70s like they claim.
[00:41:51.898 --> 00:41:59.700]  Our government made a deal with them, backdoor, and they've killed tens upon tens of millions of little girls.
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:06.802]  I can't imagine being so twisted to go, oh, they're girls, so it's okay because I'm a male chauvinist.
[00:42:10.128 --> 00:42:13.456]  It's crazy how twisted these people are.
[00:42:13.456 --> 00:42:16.202]  So Kit Daniels is in there in the control room.
[00:42:16.202 --> 00:42:17.244]  He wrote this story.
[00:42:17.244 --> 00:42:18.567]  It's linked through to the liberal...
[00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:41.030]  Injusticestories.com, the liberal feminist website, and you read this stuff, it sounds like a bizarre Portlandia episode where she's just using all these university terms that they throw around about how it's this male-dominated, you know, centric society and we've got to get rid of it by culling the men.
[00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.433]  I mean this, hey lady, society's been culling men forever.
[00:42:45.054 --> 00:42:58.341]  Since the days of Pharaoh, since the days of the Babylonians, since the days of the ancient Greeks, people knew that the males, when their numbers got too high, had to be done away with because they might become the new ruling group.
[00:42:58.341 --> 00:43:03.503]  And it was always old men sending the young men off to die.
[00:43:03.503 --> 00:43:11.387]  So that's all you've done, since you act like you're such a pseudo-intellectual lady, is you've just adopted the program of Plato.
[00:43:13.331 --> 00:43:21.835]  About how they first had to get the women under their control, then they could domesticate the other men and then cull them like cattle when needed.
[00:43:21.835 --> 00:43:32.941]  And rulers would get together for thousands of years, but this is documented in the War of the Roses and others, and say, we're having uprisings here in France, we're having uprisings in England, it's time for a war.
[00:43:32.941 --> 00:43:34.742]  And then they would just have a war.
[00:43:34.742 --> 00:43:40.625]  And then they would march their troops up to kill each other, and really they were just wiping out part of the population.
[00:43:40.625 --> 00:43:42.386]  So the population would learn to hate
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:47.045]  The French and they would learn to hate the British.
[00:43:47.045 --> 00:43:51.711]  When meanwhile, in most of the wars, the elites were simply culling their numbers.
[00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:54.054]  Now the Aztecs were more sophisticated.
[00:43:54.054 --> 00:43:56.016]  You've actually got to hand it to them.
[00:43:56.016 --> 00:43:59.160]  They completely ritualized war with neighboring kingdoms.
[00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:02.532]  In some cases, thousands of miles away.
[00:44:02.532 --> 00:44:06.636]  They would march and then go into Central America.
[00:44:06.636 --> 00:44:12.862]  Or folks would march up from Central America or from Central North America down to Southern North America and have big battles.
[00:44:12.862 --> 00:44:14.223]  And how do they know when to have the battles?
[00:44:14.223 --> 00:44:17.066]  It was all astrological.
[00:44:17.066 --> 00:44:25.414]  Sometimes it would be over a hundred years before they would have one and then they would have these ritualized battles saying the Earth needs the blood of the warriors and so we're going to wipe everybody out here.
[00:44:26.411 --> 00:44:34.153]  And then we'll bind some women and children and throw them into cenote pits to the water gods and to the, you know, deity of the woman's womb.
[00:44:34.153 --> 00:44:40.495]  And then we'll cut some hearts out to the sun god over here, to the winged serpent.
[00:44:40.495 --> 00:44:42.055]  On and on and on.
[00:44:42.055 --> 00:44:44.376]  So we're seeing a repeat of all of this.
[00:44:44.376 --> 00:44:46.757]  So don't worry, feminists.
[00:44:46.757 --> 00:44:47.717]  Don't worry.
[00:44:47.717 --> 00:44:50.538]  There's a reason the population of the world is only 45% male.
[00:44:50.538 --> 00:44:51.398]  And 51% of births are female.
[00:44:55.677 --> 00:45:05.661]  Despite all of China's culling of women, mammals have more female offspring than they have male.
[00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:17.226]  Because the truth is, if you get into the genetics, the male is just basically like a warrior model of a female, without a uterus.
[00:45:17.226 --> 00:45:18.767]  Bigger bones, more aggressive.
[00:45:21.158 --> 00:45:24.059]  And then the female basically is the species.
[00:45:24.059 --> 00:45:32.783]  So you guys are true jackasses when it comes to these attempts to dehumanize yourselves.
[00:45:32.783 --> 00:45:34.723]  You attack men, you attack yourself.
[00:45:34.723 --> 00:45:36.204]  Men attack women, you attack yourself.
[00:45:37.159 --> 00:45:38.900]  And I have no guilt.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.360]  I will not be part of this mental illness.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:45.562]  I've done nothing to women, but empower them and take care of them and work with them.
[00:45:45.562 --> 00:45:47.723]  And I enjoy taking care of women.
[00:45:47.723 --> 00:45:49.544]  I enjoy being sweet to women.
[00:45:49.544 --> 00:45:51.324]  I enjoy empowering women.
[00:45:51.324 --> 00:45:54.245]  And they like empowering me.
[00:45:54.245 --> 00:45:55.966]  And that's the kind of women I want in my life.
[00:45:55.966 --> 00:46:01.808]  Not the parasitic, twisted, sociopathic, psychopathic types that think it's okay.
[00:46:01.808 --> 00:46:03.929]  Most criminals have a rationale.
[00:46:05.097 --> 00:46:10.119]  When the Aryan Nations or other groups have been out caught engaged in criminal activity, they always have an excuse how they were doing.
[00:46:10.119 --> 00:46:17.363]  Or when black gangs or Hispanic gangs, you know, go out and, you know, kill somebody of another so-called race, it's because, well, they deserved it.
[00:46:17.363 --> 00:46:19.944]  And that's all the feminists are, is a criminal gang.
[00:46:19.944 --> 00:46:22.265]  Paul Watson calls it third-wave feminism.
[00:46:22.265 --> 00:46:23.166]  Look, it's feminism.
[00:46:23.846 --> 00:46:28.090]  Feminism was started to look legitimate to empower women on the surface.
[00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:29.212]  It was never meant to do that.
[00:46:29.212 --> 00:46:31.394]  Eber Bernays wrote about that in the 20s.
[00:46:31.394 --> 00:46:32.555]  One of the pioneers of it.
[00:46:32.555 --> 00:46:36.579]  It was meant to shackle women and enslave them to the state and it's been done.
[00:46:36.579 --> 00:46:37.300]  That's a fact!
[00:46:38.615 --> 00:46:41.096]  So it isn't, and I'm not just disagreeing with Watson here.
[00:46:41.096 --> 00:46:43.417]  You know, Watson puts out articles I disagree with.
[00:46:43.417 --> 00:46:45.878]  He puts out ideas and, you know, things that I don't agree with.
[00:46:45.878 --> 00:46:47.279]  He thinks something isn't a hoax.
[00:46:47.279 --> 00:46:48.339]  I think it is a hoax.
[00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:49.480]  Paul's really smart.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.600]  But I want to explain something.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:47:01.605]  If I openly say I disagree with something one of my writers wrote, or I disagree with one of the nuances on air, it's not a diss or under the bus statement.
[00:47:01.605 --> 00:47:05.667]  It's not a unified cult up here at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:07.401 --> 00:47:10.585]  Where it's my way or the highway and everyone has to totally agree with me.
[00:47:10.585 --> 00:47:14.790]  Because my views change day to day as I get more information.
[00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:23.020]  But it's the mere fact that people are even uncomfortable openly debating someone else or think that if I disagree with something that say Kurt Nemo's written.
[00:47:24.756 --> 00:47:27.697]  That then I somehow am attacking him.
[00:47:27.697 --> 00:47:28.718]  That's not the case.
[00:47:28.718 --> 00:47:29.718]  We're not a cult.
[00:47:29.718 --> 00:47:30.419]  We love liberty.
[00:47:30.419 --> 00:47:31.039]  We love freedom.
[00:47:31.039 --> 00:47:31.839]  We love truth.
[00:47:31.839 --> 00:47:32.540]  We love justice.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.481]  We love not having a nuclear war.
[00:47:34.481 --> 00:47:35.801]  We love prosperity.
[00:47:35.801 --> 00:47:36.902]  We love common sense.
[00:47:36.902 --> 00:47:38.162]  That's who I hire.
[00:47:38.162 --> 00:47:45.506]  Smart people that love common sense and recognize monsters when they see them who sit up there lecturing us like they're God.
[00:47:45.506 --> 00:47:53.330]  Bossy control freaks that are so bossy they had the first lady come out last year and say, don't use the word bossy because it refers to women.
[00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:58.579]  Well yeah, there is an archetype of the bossy, control freak, out of control woman.
[00:47:58.579 --> 00:48:01.564]  Just like there's an archetype of the bossy, out of control, control freak male.
[00:48:02.731 --> 00:48:10.014]  All these are is wannabe dominant women that don't dominate with their beauty, or their art, or their love, or their compassion, or with their hard work.
[00:48:10.014 --> 00:48:14.256]  They dominate hen-pecking men and other women into saying they're the boss.
[00:48:14.256 --> 00:48:15.536]  Well, guess what, Hillary?
[00:48:15.536 --> 00:48:17.057]  You ain't the boss!
[00:48:17.057 --> 00:48:18.637]  Guess what, Michelle?
[00:48:18.637 --> 00:48:19.618]  You're not my boss!
[00:48:19.618 --> 00:48:24.740]  You're criminal, scum, parasites that want to sell women on hating their sons.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:28.081]  You're sick, freak, filth!
[00:48:28.081 --> 00:48:29.962]  How dare you try to break up the human community!
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.982]  It's anti-humanism.
[00:48:32.982 --> 00:48:34.503]  It's anti-familyism.
[00:48:34.503 --> 00:48:35.644]  Whatever word you want to use it.
[00:48:35.644 --> 00:48:37.265]  It's psychic death.
[00:48:37.265 --> 00:48:40.508]  Joining us is Kit Daniels to talk about his article.
[00:48:40.508 --> 00:48:43.951]  Kit, I aborted my baby because it was a boy, is the headline.
[00:48:43.951 --> 00:48:47.354]  And they're very proud of themselves, hailing this.
[00:48:47.354 --> 00:48:48.955]  They're there to push the Overton window.
[00:48:48.955 --> 00:48:51.357]  They're there to condition us to accept anything.
[00:48:51.357 --> 00:48:52.598]  And I guess we will.
[00:48:52.598 --> 00:48:58.944]  If they say it's liberal, we'll put a 25-year-old soldier or sailor on a death list to not give them treatment for kidney failure.
[00:48:59.844 --> 00:49:02.866]  And I guess if it's a boy, it's okay, Kit.
[00:49:02.866 --> 00:49:09.350]  Yeah, throughout history, tyrants have attempted to dehumanize the population in order to replace God with the state.
[00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:17.975]  That's why we see this destruction of our rights, because they treat us like slaves, and the tyrants, the politicians, they can see themselves as gods.
[00:49:17.975 --> 00:49:25.020]  That's why we see the destruction of the Bill of Rights right now, the destruction of the family, the destruction of prosperity, so on and so forth.
[00:49:26.423 --> 00:49:29.006]  And also, you mentioned earlier about the Aztec Empire.
[00:49:29.006 --> 00:49:31.129]  It reminded me of the fact that...
[00:49:33.697 --> 00:49:39.120]  The Spanish Empire was able to take over these ancient empires in Central and South America.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.660]  Because they'd wiped out all their men.
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:41.601]  Yeah, that.
[00:49:41.601 --> 00:49:50.805]  And also they used divide and conquer tactics, which is exactly what the establishment has done with the feminist movement ever since the 1960s with Gloria Steinem and so on and so forth.
[00:49:50.805 --> 00:49:51.646]  That's right.
[00:49:51.646 --> 00:49:52.166]  What was it?
[00:49:52.166 --> 00:49:57.548]  Less than 400 conquistadors were able to conquer over a million people in just in one valley.
[00:49:57.548 --> 00:49:59.909]  Yeah, I think it was even less than that in certain instances.
[00:49:59.909 --> 00:50:02.531]  I think there's only like 30 or 40 men taking over thousands of
[00:50:04.013 --> 00:50:09.457]  of tribes just because they're playing off rivals each other and this is basically common Machiavelli statecraft.
[00:50:09.457 --> 00:50:10.838]  We saw the Byzantine Empire do that.
[00:50:10.838 --> 00:50:12.839]  That's why they survived for a thousand years.
[00:50:12.839 --> 00:50:17.842]  Because they were playing off their rivals within the neighboring principalities off each other.
[00:50:17.842 --> 00:50:18.803]  That's just a common technique.
[00:50:18.803 --> 00:50:19.563]  And they do it to us?
[00:50:19.563 --> 00:50:21.485]  And they write books about how they're doing it to us?
[00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.046]  Because they think we're so stupid, Kit?
[00:50:23.046 --> 00:50:23.606]  Yeah.
[00:50:23.606 --> 00:50:26.548]  Because people, unfortunately, people don't understand history.
[00:50:26.548 --> 00:50:30.171]  They're using the same strategies over and over again they've used for thousands of years.
[00:50:30.991 --> 00:50:37.580]  And even today with the feminist movement, they're using this divide and conquer, they're pitting women against men through feminism.
[00:50:38.075 --> 00:50:42.436]  And the women that are into this really think they're not getting ahead because of men.
[00:50:42.436 --> 00:50:49.538]  It's like people like Bill Maher that says, I'm for death, I'm for mass death, I want to get the highway moving, but ban guns because they kill children.
[00:50:49.538 --> 00:50:52.338]  No, ban guns because he wants a monopoly of power.
[00:50:52.338 --> 00:50:55.619]  That's what the heavily armed establishment with all their bodyguards wants.
[00:50:55.619 --> 00:51:02.041]  But when they say clear off the highways, you move to a city because it's teeming and there's a lot of jobs.
[00:51:02.041 --> 00:51:02.981]  It's like a coral reef.
[00:51:02.981 --> 00:51:04.561]  I've used this analogy many times.
[00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:06.622]  You might be out in the ocean and go 10 miles.
[00:51:07.651 --> 00:51:12.293]  Before you run along a coral reef off an island, everything else is basically dead out there.
[00:51:12.293 --> 00:51:14.753]  There's not a lot of life until you hit that coral reef.
[00:51:14.753 --> 00:51:18.315]  Now, when you hit a coral reef, you think, my gosh, it's overpopulated.
[00:51:18.315 --> 00:51:18.755]  Well, no.
[00:51:18.755 --> 00:51:24.517]  The population being high is what shows you that there's a density of life, that it's healthy.
[00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:28.417]  And so humans say, I don't like lines.
[00:51:28.417 --> 00:51:30.438]  It's like, you know, a really good restaurant's hard to get into.
[00:51:30.438 --> 00:51:32.359]  It's because it's a really good restaurant.
[00:51:32.359 --> 00:51:33.660]  I mean, go out and live in a ghost town.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:36.701]  Go out and live in the middle of nowhere, and then you'll be moving back really quick.
[00:51:36.701 --> 00:51:51.590]  But it's these same people that are sitting in the midst of a civilization saying they hate the very civilization that allowed them to develop, and they have all these opportunities, but instead they're spoiled brats that are so greedy that at a fundamental level they think killing people
[00:51:52.290 --> 00:51:58.495]  Old ladies, veterans, children will get them ahead because then they'll get a bigger piece of the pie.
[00:51:58.495 --> 00:52:08.123]  They don't get the fact we could build this pie to infinity if we weren't letting the global social engineers suppress the true new technologies that we know have been developed.
[00:52:08.123 --> 00:52:14.808]  We're being put into a new dark age where only a tiny elite will have access to all of this incredible technology, not just life extension.
[00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:28.541]  But nanotech, the list, I mean, it's incredible, but they won't let us have it because they want to go ahead and set up the world government, cull our numbers, dumb us down, who's left, to basically toy with us.
[00:52:28.541 --> 00:52:30.042]  It's such a sick plan.
[00:52:30.042 --> 00:52:36.007]  Talk about what this feminist breaks down in her story that's being hailed by liberals as just ambrosia.
[00:52:36.007 --> 00:52:38.029]  I mean, it comes down to let's kill men.
[00:52:38.029 --> 00:52:39.650]  Men are fundamentally bad.
[00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:41.051]  Men are the problem.
[00:52:41.051 --> 00:52:43.073]  This is the sick cult we're dealing with.
[00:52:43.868 --> 00:52:48.211]  Well, yeah, she's broadcasting this kind of group mentality of us versus them.
[00:52:48.211 --> 00:52:53.674]  That's exactly what the establishment wants, because they only gain power through groups, because they can control groups.
[00:52:53.674 --> 00:52:55.676]  They can't control individuals.
[00:52:55.676 --> 00:53:04.121]  So in order to have a power structure, they put people in different groups and have the groups fight among each other.
[00:53:04.121 --> 00:53:08.064]  And they also put their own leaders in charge of the groups, like Alice Sharpton, for example.
[00:53:09.201 --> 00:53:14.369]  So it's just this whole collectivism can only be strengthened.
[00:53:14.369 --> 00:53:16.873]  It can only exist through group mentality.
[00:53:16.873 --> 00:53:20.298]  That's unfortunately what we're seeing now.
[00:53:20.298 --> 00:53:23.563]  Now I want to try to invite this witch on the broadcast.
[00:53:23.563 --> 00:53:24.704]  Let's go over some of this article.
[00:53:25.436 --> 00:53:31.399]  Over the past three years, I've lost many friends and several of my own family members have completely cut off communication with me.
[00:53:31.399 --> 00:53:41.183]  I know now that these are adults, close quote, who cannot handle the fact that I have the right to make choices, and these choices ultimately hardly ever affect them.
[00:53:41.183 --> 00:53:43.564]  She goes on to talk about killing her son.
[00:53:43.564 --> 00:53:44.725]  Can you imagine?
[00:53:46.181 --> 00:53:50.586]  How unhappy and sick this person is and how they're gonna feel later when they finally wake up.
[00:53:50.586 --> 00:53:58.314]  But see, the problem is once you make evil decisions like this, a lot of cowards, Kit, keep doubling down saying it's right and the right way to go.
[00:53:58.314 --> 00:54:02.219]  I mean, who in their right mind could say, I killed my baby because it was a boy?
[00:54:02.918 --> 00:54:23.582]  In all honesty, when I read the article, I was thinking to myself, there's a possibility that she knows she did wrong, but now she's trying to rationalize it by saying, oh, well, this is good for the feminist movement, you know, this is empowering, it made me feel stronger, and by avoiding my baby, it brought out all the hate against feminism in general, and this is how future feminists should have to deal with it.
[00:54:24.548 --> 00:54:33.031]  So, it's really sickening that... Notice she says though, it made her stronger, just like when a Satanist guts a baby, they say it gives them power.
[00:54:33.031 --> 00:54:35.072]  I mean, she is getting power from this.
[00:54:35.072 --> 00:54:41.214]  It takes a lot of will to consciously say, this is a boy, this is my son, and I'm gonna cap his ass.
[00:54:41.214 --> 00:54:43.615]  Excuse my French, I mean, this is hardcore.
[00:54:43.615 --> 00:54:47.297]  My body, my body's betrayal was no more.
[00:54:47.297 --> 00:54:50.098]  I was free, I felt strong, is her disgusting quote.
[00:54:51.325 --> 00:55:02.541]  You know, I've read a lot of articles about people who, they can't understand, they can't grasp the establishment of the New World Order, so on and so forth, because they have, people like you and me, we have a moral compass.
[00:55:02.541 --> 00:55:07.107]  So how can we possibly see transnational elites
[00:55:08.622 --> 00:55:14.385]  How they operate and how they don't care about humanity when you and me don't even have that kind of reference point.
[00:55:14.385 --> 00:55:21.089]  And unfortunately, I think this lady is just like a tyrant because she also doesn't have a moral compass.
[00:55:21.089 --> 00:55:22.049]  Oh, she is a tyrant.
[00:55:22.049 --> 00:55:26.892]  She has something weak and defenseless that was literally part of her soul.
[00:55:26.892 --> 00:55:29.933]  And then she murdered it and smashed it because it made her feel powerful.
[00:55:29.933 --> 00:55:30.854]  She is a demon.
[00:55:31.334 --> 00:55:46.187]  Yeah, and I hope that people, they look at this article and what they take from it is the fact that this attitude that she's showing, this complete disregard for human life and for humanity, is what the most powerful people in the world also share.
[00:55:46.187 --> 00:55:46.568]  And that's right.
[00:55:46.568 --> 00:55:47.288]  And that's exactly how they operate.
[00:55:47.288 --> 00:55:48.169]  And that's totally key.
[00:55:48.169 --> 00:55:49.090]  Thank you, Kit Daniels.
[00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:50.371]  Your article's on InfoWars.com.
[00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:57.277]  I know you're going to add some links to it, to the journals of Bioethics and others promoting similar things, just so people know this is not just some
[00:55:58.218 --> 00:55:59.219]  Aberration.
[00:55:59.219 --> 00:56:01.000]  This is the larger plan.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.905]  We should also post that silent green piece that Darren McBreen did in the article as well.
[00:56:06.905 --> 00:56:08.566]  Thank you so much, Kit Daniels.
[00:56:08.566 --> 00:56:11.068]  What he said is what this whole hour has been about.
[00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:24.313]  The people saying they want to take your rights because they love you, the people saying they want you defenseless because they love you, the people that say your kids belong to the state because they love you, are control freaks that want you dead.
[00:56:24.313 --> 00:56:32.556]  Because for demons, these people, whatever you want to call them, the ultimate act is to kill another human and to have them defenseless under their power.
[00:56:32.556 --> 00:56:33.516]  That's what psychopaths do.
[00:56:34.736 --> 00:56:49.151]  And they have artificially created a lot of mentally ill people who've grown up artificially in this modern world and have no connection to reality and just follow the tenets of the anti-woman, anti-man, anti-human, anti-life.
[00:56:50.132 --> 00:56:54.995]  Satanism that is the CIA, New World Order created feminism.
[00:56:54.995 --> 00:56:56.716]  And it's all declassified.
[00:56:56.716 --> 00:56:57.737]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:56:57.737 --> 00:57:00.659]  It is the ultimate way to bring down humanity.
[00:57:00.659 --> 00:57:03.500]  Speaking of bringing humanity together, spread the word about this broadcast.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:04.361]  We're hardcore.
[00:57:04.361 --> 00:57:05.481]  We're unabashed.
[00:57:05.481 --> 00:57:08.243]  We do not apologize about telling the truth.
[00:57:08.243 --> 00:57:09.344]  We are hardcore.
[00:57:09.344 --> 00:57:14.087]  And we have the best nutraceuticals available, bar none, in the month of February.
[00:57:14.087 --> 00:57:15.548]  We have Human Empowerment Month.
[00:57:16.454 --> 00:57:20.277]  For men and women, super male and super female vitality.
[00:57:20.277 --> 00:57:23.719]  Take a couple of droppers of it under the tongue each day.
[00:57:23.719 --> 00:57:31.545]  It has concentrated super herbs and fruit extracts and other herbal extracts that will just blow you away.
[00:57:31.545 --> 00:57:34.087]  It is my ambrosia.
[00:57:34.087 --> 00:57:35.989]  I am fueled by it.
[00:57:35.989 --> 00:57:37.290]  It's all natural.
[00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:39.571]  Super male and super female vitality.
[00:57:39.571 --> 00:57:40.512]  Already discounted.
[00:57:40.512 --> 00:57:44.135]  Well, then it's another 20% off in the month of February.
[00:57:44.135 --> 00:57:45.316]  InfoWars Life.
[00:57:46.618 --> 00:57:47.299]  We're good to go.
[00:58:02.901 --> 00:58:06.642]  Give a bottle to your husband, give a bottle to your boyfriend.
[00:58:06.642 --> 00:58:10.723]  It's just amazing and it is the purest, strongest.
[00:58:10.723 --> 00:58:16.965]  Other similar formulas are about three times as much, twice as much, but when we discount it like this, some of them are three times as much.
[00:58:16.965 --> 00:58:18.906]  This is a true nutraceutical.
[00:58:19.286 --> 00:58:24.871]  We have two bottles of X2 Nation Iodine, get a free bottle of Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Booster as well.
[00:58:24.871 --> 00:58:31.616]  A lot of other specials at Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:31.616 --> 00:58:36.220]  And your orders fund this operation, so I salute all of you that are supporters.
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:40.623]  Thank you very much.
[00:58:40.623 --> 00:58:43.946]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.008 --> 00:58:52.670]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:56.952]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:58:56.952 --> 00:58:58.733]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:58:58.733 --> 00:59:04.055]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:59:04.055 --> 00:59:06.597]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.

[00:59:18.570 --> 00:59:22.071]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:59:22.071 --> 00:59:30.314]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:30.314 --> 00:59:35.735]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:35.735 --> 00:59:38.276]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:59:50.732 --> 00:59:53.316]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:09.619]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.619 --> 01:00:11.200]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.741]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.741 --> 01:00:16.944]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.944 --> 01:00:21.027]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:39.621]  I almost want to go on a rant right now about petty garbage.
[01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:49.783]  Because people will get mad if aircraft have cuss words on the sides but they don't care if those aircraft drop bombs on innocent men, women, and children.
[01:00:49.783 --> 01:00:53.123]  I'm kind of ripping that off from Apocalypse Now.
[01:00:53.123 --> 01:00:58.964]  And I was just thinking about one time my wife bought me some polo shirts that were kind of Boy Scout-ish.
[01:00:58.964 --> 01:01:01.925]  And I wore some of them on air and people thought that was some secret code.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:13.303]  And then Joe Jennings is wearing a popular style rockabilly shirt today that looks like you're about to go to a big barbecue and eat some ribs.
[01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:19.205]  And I just went in there during the other break and I said, listen, don't go on TV wearing that with a skull and crossbones on it.
[01:01:19.205 --> 01:01:23.066]  People think I'm sending some secret Illuminati message.
[01:01:23.066 --> 01:01:23.907]  And then I thought about it.
[01:01:23.907 --> 01:01:25.387]  I said, you know what?
[01:01:25.387 --> 01:01:27.528]  Let's cut to Joe in there.
[01:01:27.528 --> 01:01:30.189]  And we'll cut to the control room shot.
[01:01:30.189 --> 01:01:31.489]  And he put tape
[01:01:32.846 --> 01:01:37.570]  Like, I guess he's a go-go dancer and they put tape somewhere else, but he put tape over the skull and crossbones.
[01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:39.052]  Go ahead and take that tape off.
[01:01:39.052 --> 01:01:39.872]  Because you know what?
[01:01:39.872 --> 01:01:42.194]  Intention is what matters in this universe.
[01:01:42.194 --> 01:01:48.800]  I happen to know that's a rockabilly style shirt that just means, hey, I like motorcycles, I like to eat barbecue, I like to have a good time.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.863]  And so when he wears it, it isn't bad.
[01:01:51.863 --> 01:01:57.868]  And I'm not going to bow down to people that want to criticize and claim, we're doing Illuminati this, we're doing Illuminati that.
[01:01:58.579 --> 01:02:05.564]  I want to promote liberty and human freedom and empowerment, and people can say whatever they want about what I do.
[01:02:05.564 --> 01:02:09.046]  And so, I mean, it's like PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:02:09.046 --> 01:02:14.430]  We had one of the graphics folks, you know, I said I want a planet on the front, you know, the Earth, Prison Planet.
[01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:17.172]  And so obviously the most classic thing is the sun behind the Earth.
[01:02:17.172 --> 01:02:18.272]  It's beautiful.
[01:02:18.272 --> 01:02:21.875]  People said that's Illuminati, because it is Illuminati when Obama uses that sign.
[01:02:23.045 --> 01:02:27.088]  Meaning a new era, a new order is coming in, but not when we do it.
[01:02:27.088 --> 01:02:31.652]  So every symbol has been expropriated.
[01:02:31.652 --> 01:02:34.895]  It has been taken by the new world order.
[01:02:34.895 --> 01:02:41.560]  Whether it's the cross or whether it's the swastika is a sun symbol in every culture.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.162]  In every culture spinning clockwise or counterclockwise.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.561]  And it's a very powerful symbol.
[01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:48.503]  It's a very beautiful symbol.
[01:02:48.503 --> 01:02:57.030]  I've seen, you know, in museums, Nordic art, and I've seen Native American art, and Indian art from India.
[01:02:57.030 --> 01:03:07.618]  It's so beautiful, but you can't... In fact, in India, they're getting complaints that are actually covering up swastikas on multi-thousand-year-old temples because Westerners are coming and becoming offended.
[01:03:07.618 --> 01:03:11.862]  The Indians don't have swastikas carved on there because they support Hitler.
[01:03:11.862 --> 01:03:14.324]  Hitler took the symbol from the Tibetans.
[01:03:16.715 --> 01:03:18.056]  I mean, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:03:18.056 --> 01:03:19.537]  I'm just sick of it.
[01:03:19.537 --> 01:03:21.138]  I'm sick of the ignorance.
[01:03:21.138 --> 01:03:24.920]  I'm sick of the political correctness.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.661]  It just permeates everything.
[01:03:27.661 --> 01:03:29.642]  It absolutely drives me up the wall.
[01:03:29.642 --> 01:03:33.845]  Let me tell you when there's Illuminati symbolism.
[01:03:33.845 --> 01:03:37.127]  It's when the whole agenda is anti-gun, anti-family, pro-GMO.
[01:03:38.737 --> 01:03:44.881]  Pro-feed-your-baby formula that brain damages it, and then every halftime show is some occultic ceremony.
[01:03:44.881 --> 01:03:49.063]  Or during the 9-11 ceremony a few years ago, they had an all-seeing eye and flash an eye in the middle of it.
[01:03:49.063 --> 01:03:51.145]  I mean, that was a ceremony.
[01:03:51.145 --> 01:03:55.968]  But not when one of my crew comes in and is wearing a rockabilly outfit.
[01:03:55.968 --> 01:03:57.669]  That's really popular in Austin.
[01:03:57.669 --> 01:04:00.551]  I wouldn't say popular, it's been popular for a long time.
[01:04:03.499 --> 01:04:08.680]  It's like one time one of our designers did like a 1776 thing with a skull on it.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:11.781]  So I wanted a skull with a, uh, tri-cornered hat on it.
[01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:13.042]  Like, hey, liberty lives again.
[01:04:13.042 --> 01:04:15.262]  I had people calling in going, what is this?
[01:04:15.262 --> 01:04:17.483]  You know, what the hell are you doing with a skull?
[01:04:17.483 --> 01:04:22.304]  It, it all depends on how it's being used, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:22.304 --> 01:04:23.824]  Anyways, I didn't mean to go off on that jag.
[01:04:23.824 --> 01:04:25.505]  I just,
[01:04:27.813 --> 01:04:28.553]  It's just frustrating.
[01:04:28.553 --> 01:04:29.474]  It's very frustrating.
[01:04:29.474 --> 01:04:31.314]  I don't even know Joe's take on this.
[01:04:31.314 --> 01:04:33.415]  Later in the broadcast, we'll get his take on it.
[01:04:33.415 --> 01:04:36.776]  We've got The Economist joining us to take your phone calls.
[01:04:36.776 --> 01:04:40.138]  Harry Dent, he was on just about a month ago, but I don't want to get him back on.
[01:04:40.138 --> 01:04:40.918]  So much is happening.
[01:04:40.918 --> 01:04:42.399]  We'll open the phones up there.
[01:04:42.399 --> 01:04:44.840]  Report, White House preparing military response.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.761]  The diplomatic activity with Russia fails.
[01:04:47.761 --> 01:04:49.722]  Was a nuke used?
[01:04:49.722 --> 01:04:53.643]  It's not bad to ask that question, because I don't believe a thing that comes out of Washington.
[01:04:53.643 --> 01:04:55.384]  We've got Joe Biggs coming up in an hour and a half.
[01:04:55.384 --> 01:04:55.764]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.911 --> 01:05:03.512]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.

[01:06:58.291 --> 01:07:01.693]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[01:07:01.693 --> 01:07:05.196]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[01:07:05.196 --> 01:07:11.280]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.661]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:07:12.661 --> 01:07:14.882]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:07:14.882 --> 01:07:16.463]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:07:16.463 --> 01:07:21.246]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:25.849]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:28.131]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:28.851]  We're good.
[01:08:01.249 --> 01:08:04.030]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:06.832]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:26.430]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:26.970]  to 2 p.m.
[01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:30.511]  Central, we're here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:30.511 --> 01:08:47.396]  Coming up at the bottom of the next hour, former Staff Sergeant Joe Beggs, an Infowars.com reporter, will break down the latest on Ukraine, report White House preparing military response of diplomatic activities with Russia, fail, the world is now on the cusp of total war.
[01:08:48.669 --> 01:08:57.475]  And I've got a whole stack of mainstream news articles with top former Pentagon analysts saying they've never been more scared.
[01:08:57.475 --> 01:09:00.657]  Never during the Cold War did you have U.S.
[01:09:00.657 --> 01:09:14.906]  forces massing with mercenaries in Poland and in Ukraine engaging in combat with the Russians and now you've got John McCain and others this week and last week saying we need to give them tanks and air cover
[01:09:15.946 --> 01:09:33.371]  and everything else, in a fight over an area of Ukraine, Crimea, that has been under Russian control off and on for more than 500 years, and that Russia has fought five or six major wars, a few dozen other sub-wars.
[01:09:33.371 --> 01:09:36.812]  I mean, this is part of Russia.
[01:09:36.812 --> 01:09:41.073]  Like, Florida is part of the U.S.
[01:09:42.486 --> 01:09:51.649]  Yeah, at the end of World War II, they divided up, well, the Nazis kind of divided up Ukraine until they turned on the Russians and that same thing with Poland.
[01:09:51.649 --> 01:09:56.690]  But that's the only reason Ukraine is kind of its own area is because of World War II.
[01:09:56.690 --> 01:10:01.032]  And I'm not saying the Russians haven't abused the Ukrainians and there isn't a lot of problems.
[01:10:01.032 --> 01:10:03.693]  The point is the West is in there fomenting this.
[01:10:03.693 --> 01:10:05.933]  This is a really serious situation.
[01:10:05.933 --> 01:10:07.254]  So Joe Biggs is going to join us.
[01:10:07.254 --> 01:10:08.314]  Russia warns U.S.
[01:10:08.314 --> 01:10:10.595]  Army Ukraine will be considered an act of war.
[01:10:12.495 --> 01:10:14.097]  America hell-bent on war.
[01:10:14.097 --> 01:10:16.679]  80-year-old analyst has never been more afraid.
[01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:18.781]  I'm 80 years old.
[01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:20.642]  I was never scared through the Cold War years.
[01:10:20.642 --> 01:10:30.912]  I'm very scared now, says Steven Liedman, a research associate at the Center for Research and Globalization, told, and it goes on to break all that down.
[01:10:30.912 --> 01:10:35.296]  This is all going to be covered coming up in about an hour and 25 minutes from now.
[01:10:37.862 --> 01:10:49.731]  Now, joining us today, I don't usually have a guest up every three or four weeks, but this guest has been so on target with the economy, I won't be able to pick his brain, and I've had listeners ask, hey, have Harry Dent back on.
[01:10:49.731 --> 01:10:53.694]  We'd like to ask him different questions about the economy and the world to get his take on it.
[01:10:53.694 --> 01:11:01.099]  So, coming up in about 35 after or so, we will open the phones, specifically for Harry Dent of harrydentresearch.com.
[01:11:01.099 --> 01:11:06.403]  He says, get ready for the Dow to be at 6,000, and more and more analysts are saying that
[01:11:06.903 --> 01:11:09.424]  The economic implosion is nigh.
[01:11:09.424 --> 01:11:11.424]  In many areas it's already hit.
[01:11:11.424 --> 01:11:13.044]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:11:13.044 --> 01:11:13.304]  800-259-9231.
[01:11:13.304 --> 01:11:15.925]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[01:11:15.925 --> 01:11:16.265]  That's 800-259-9231.
[01:11:16.265 --> 01:11:17.585]  But first, if you're a radio listener,
[01:11:32.096 --> 01:11:37.820]  You can go to harrydentresearch.com and see all these graphs for yourself.
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:45.325]  But if you're a radio listener, you can also go to infowars.com forward slash show on your droid, your iPhone, whatever the case is.
[01:11:45.325 --> 01:11:50.688]  We have high quality, free streaming of the radio slash TV show.
[01:11:50.688 --> 01:12:01.836]  And I started out doing this as a pioneer of adding video to radio 19 years ago, but on air 20, because people would say you don't have photos of UN signs saying it's under UN control at Big Bend.
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:05.289]  Or at the Grand Canyon.
[01:12:05.289 --> 01:12:07.859]  So I started streaming video to show people.
[01:12:09.307 --> 01:12:11.889]  And of course now it's imitated by Glenn Beck and countless others.
[01:12:11.889 --> 01:12:12.329]  And I'm glad.
[01:12:12.329 --> 01:12:14.871]  That's just part of modern times coming.
[01:12:14.871 --> 01:12:35.229]  But you can go to Infowars.com forward slash show or PrisonPlanet.com forward slash show and you can find the free video and audio feeds and you can see us showing you these graphs of what's happening to oil, what's happening to the S&P, indexes, what's happening to the Dow Jones, all of it with Harry Dent.
[01:12:35.529 --> 01:12:38.353]  So Harry, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:50.848]  We're going to get into a whole host of different economic issues, but more and more we do see the establishment analysts are starting to sound more like you, saying they believe something bigger than 2008 is coming.
[01:12:53.905 --> 01:13:03.888]  Yeah, you know, we've already we've seen every bubble that's come up, you know, the tech bubble in 2000 at the peak and then crashed and then the more recent one in 2007.
[01:13:03.888 --> 01:13:05.668]  Now we got an even bigger bubble.
[01:13:05.668 --> 01:13:08.649]  Every bubble's gone higher and every crash has gone lower.
[01:13:08.649 --> 01:13:10.069]  And there's a simple reason for that.
[01:13:10.069 --> 01:13:22.253]  The fundamental trends that were great in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s, demographics and internet and technology, the things that really make an economy grow, innovation, the aging of people into the most productive.
[01:13:22.253 --> 01:13:23.153]  These things are gone.
[01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:32.556]  Ever since 2007, governments, central banks around the world are simply just printing money to make up for the economic weakness and doing it in greater and greater amounts.
[01:13:32.556 --> 01:13:36.337]  And of course, that's like taking more and more of a drug and hoping things work out.
[01:13:36.337 --> 01:13:37.677]  It doesn't work out.
[01:13:37.677 --> 01:13:39.338]  And so we have to come down harder.
[01:13:39.338 --> 01:13:40.258]  We have more debt.
[01:13:41.098 --> 01:13:48.841]  Then we had in 2007 and 8 at the end of the last crisis, private debts come down a little bit, but government debts gone way up.
[01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:52.162]  Countries like Japan, massively more debt.
[01:13:52.162 --> 01:13:57.204]  But the biggest thing to us, you know, Alex, is we really, number one, focus on demographics.
[01:13:57.204 --> 01:13:58.625]  It's the one thing you can predict.
[01:13:59.085 --> 01:14:05.352]  About an economy and its people, how old they're going to be, how much they earn, spend, and do everything as they age.
[01:14:05.352 --> 01:14:11.858]  I can even predict when people weigh the most, or eat the most calories, or drive the most miles on their cars.
[01:14:11.858 --> 01:14:14.101]  We can predict cradle to grave what people do.
[01:14:14.101 --> 01:14:14.161]  In 2015,
[01:14:16.778 --> 01:14:21.160]  Like 2008 last time around and 1990 before that with the Japanese.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:31.165]  This is going to be a shift year for demographics because in 1990 the Japanese baby boom started to turn down after a massive real estate and stock bubble.
[01:14:31.165 --> 01:14:39.309]  We predicted that 89 was going to burst while the rest of the world was going to boom and their baby boom in the US and Europe were just getting going.
[01:14:39.309 --> 01:14:41.910]  It did burst even though the rest of the world did well.
[01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:43.671]  It shows how powerful demographics are.
[01:14:44.191 --> 01:14:49.674]  We said 20 years ago, and increasingly, hey, after 2007, the baby boomers in the U.S.
[01:14:49.674 --> 01:14:50.134]  are done.
[01:14:50.134 --> 01:14:53.676]  They're going to peak on average, and the economy will start to slow down.
[01:14:53.676 --> 01:14:56.717]  And, of course, that's why governments have had to step up so much stimulus.
[01:14:56.717 --> 01:14:59.558]  But there's another thing important that happens this year in 2015.
[01:15:01.661 --> 01:15:05.023]  The everyday person did peak in 2007 at age 46.
[01:15:05.023 --> 01:15:07.964]  That's when the average person spends the most money.
[01:15:07.964 --> 01:15:22.431]  Well, the most affluent people, the 20% that drive over 50% of our income and spending still, and are being goosed up by all of this QE because it makes the stock market and their financial assets go up, and this 20% owns like 90% of the financial assets,
[01:15:24.292 --> 01:15:30.721]  They're doing better than ever, but age 53, that's at the end of last year, that's when they peak and turn down.
[01:15:30.721 --> 01:15:32.443]  Their kids leave the nest.
[01:15:32.443 --> 01:15:38.711]  They slow down in spending, and the same year is when car sales, the last of the major segments, because
[01:15:39.172 --> 01:15:46.013]  Because housing obviously peaked first in the early 2000s and then furniture in 2007, the other big sector.
[01:15:46.013 --> 01:15:48.594]  Well, the last big sector is automobiles.
[01:15:48.594 --> 01:15:54.175]  Automobile sales are going to turn down in the next couple of years and people are not going to know why.
[01:15:54.175 --> 01:16:04.177]  And some of the smartest investors, George Soros and Warren Buffett in the world, are making major acquisitions and investments in car retail dealerships, the worst place you can be.
[01:16:04.177 --> 01:16:07.018]  So we use demographics to look around the corner.
[01:16:07.678 --> 01:16:09.560]  2015 is going to be a pivotal year.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:17.226]  We warned last year that Germany and Italy were going to start to go, and Europe, and then one country after next falls off the cliff.
[01:16:17.226 --> 01:16:20.408]  And that's why we call this recent book, The Demographic Cliff.
[01:16:20.408 --> 01:16:24.471]  It started with Japan, a giant baby boom peaking and turning down.
[01:16:24.471 --> 01:16:25.772]  Then it shifted to the U.S.
[01:16:25.772 --> 01:16:28.795]  Now it's shifting to the affluent sectors of the U.S.
[01:16:28.795 --> 01:16:31.777]  and to Europe, one country after the next.
[01:16:32.177 --> 01:16:39.209]  If these central bankers think they've had to print a lot of money thus far, they're going to have to do way more, and the markets just aren't going to tolerate it.
[01:16:39.209 --> 01:16:42.895]  You can only take so much of a drug before you die of the drug itself.
[01:16:43.843 --> 01:16:46.345]  Now, Harry, you broke this down last time.
[01:16:46.345 --> 01:16:50.867]  Your new book gets into it, and I want to look at some of these other graphs that you've sent along.
[01:16:50.867 --> 01:16:54.530]  I want to look at what's happening with the major stock market indexes.
[01:16:54.530 --> 01:17:08.018]  But shifting gears specifically out of the big issue into all the sub-issues, we see this liberal obsession in the West of not having children, of having children being bad.
[01:17:08.018 --> 01:17:12.321]  And I've had different demographers on to break down the fact that we need one point
[01:17:13.534 --> 01:17:15.576]  Uh, you know, two people for every person.
[01:17:15.576 --> 01:17:24.724]  So for two people, we need 2.2, 2.4 children to be born in a country and that we are not doing that now.
[01:17:24.724 --> 01:17:31.610]  The replacement rate is 2.2 for every two people because obviously some people die in car wrecks or whatever.
[01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:36.915]  So you need more than two people to be born for every two people living just to keep the culture and economy going.
[01:17:37.515 --> 01:17:38.596]  But that's not happening.
[01:17:38.596 --> 01:17:44.639]  Japan's 1.3 children, Germany's 1.3, Italy's 1.3, some are even lower.
[01:17:44.639 --> 01:17:46.000]  This is accelerating.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:53.945]  Then meanwhile, we have unskilled third world populations that are still climbing.
[01:17:53.945 --> 01:17:59.588]  And I see so many policies by the West being put into place to pretty much kill the West.
[01:17:59.588 --> 01:18:03.671]  I mean, I don't think there's any doubt that we're seeing that the West commits suicide.
[01:18:05.256 --> 01:18:07.818]  Yeah, you know, and unfortunately, this is happening everywhere.
[01:18:07.818 --> 01:18:09.379]  Fewer kids per family.
[01:18:09.379 --> 01:18:24.950]  Like you say, most emerging countries outside of China are growing at more than replacement rate, but all Western countries, with a few exceptions like Australia and Switzerland, where only because they attract a lot of immigrants, are they more than replacing themselves.
[01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:29.633]  Every major Western country will see the next generation be smaller than this one.
[01:18:29.633 --> 01:18:33.736]  That has devastating consequences, not only slowing population, but even
[01:18:34.036 --> 01:18:35.636]  Faster-slowing workforce.
[01:18:35.636 --> 01:18:39.357]  How do you grow with less and less people working?
[01:18:39.357 --> 01:18:51.580]  But even more than that, in the home construction and home and real estate industry, there's going to be more people dying than buying homes because old people are sellers when they die or move in a nursing home and young people buy.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:58.181]  So it's going to cause huge changes that are very, very easy to project, Alex, but nobody sees it.
[01:18:58.181 --> 01:18:59.562]  Economists are here.
[01:18:59.562 --> 01:19:00.482]  They do understand
[01:19:01.317 --> 01:19:02.517]  We're not replacing ourselves.
[01:19:02.517 --> 01:19:13.160]  They do understand there's going to be like two workers for every one retiree, which is absolutely not sustainable, especially at ever-rising benefits that are not adjusted for life expectancy.
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:18.422]  We'd be retiring at age 75 today if we adjusted since Social Security for life expectancy.
[01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:19.602]  Well, we've got to go to break.
[01:19:19.602 --> 01:19:21.543]  When we come back, I want to look at Russia.
[01:19:21.543 --> 01:19:34.408]  I want to look at other things in the world economy and get your take on what you think's behind some of these really aggressive, dangerous moves, in my view, by the West to destabilize Russia, where you see oil going, and a lot more.
[01:19:34.408 --> 01:19:38.149]  And then phone calls for our guests, all coming up.
[01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:39.730]  Straight ahead.
[01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:40.990]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.

[01:21:58.078 --> 01:22:00.900]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:06.022]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:06.022 --> 01:22:14.147]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:14.147 --> 01:22:18.669]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:18.669 --> 01:22:22.491]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:22.631 --> 01:22:28.594]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:28.594 --> 01:22:31.756]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:31.756 --> 01:22:37.119]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:45.304]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:22:45.304 --> 01:22:45.484]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:22:52.608 --> 01:23:02.551]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[01:23:02.551 --> 01:23:07.412]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[01:23:07.412 --> 01:23:14.874]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease, and a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[01:23:15.134 --> 01:23:17.795]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[01:23:17.795 --> 01:23:22.257]  I've taken whey protein products for years, and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[01:23:22.257 --> 01:23:25.438]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[01:23:25.438 --> 01:23:29.739]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[01:23:29.739 --> 01:23:33.681]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[01:23:33.681 --> 01:23:37.062]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[01:23:37.742 --> 01:23:38.682]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:24:07.356 --> 01:24:17.524]  Don't forget, the Nightly News will be transmitted tonight, 7 o'clock central at PrisonPlanet.tv with the rest of the Infowars Nightly News crew.
[01:24:17.524 --> 01:24:18.704]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:24:18.704 --> 01:24:21.186]  Harry Dent is our guest, harrydentresearch.com.
[01:24:21.186 --> 01:24:27.571]  You can find his latest book, The Demographic Cliff, which is absolutely essential reading.
[01:24:27.571 --> 01:24:31.874]  I know that callers want to talk to our guests with their specific economic questions.
[01:24:31.874 --> 01:24:33.135]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:34.727 --> 01:24:44.991]  Since you were on a month ago or so, or three weeks ago, there's been a lot of developments, a lot of saber-rattling, John McCain saying, let's back up Ukraine militarily against Russia.
[01:24:44.991 --> 01:24:48.373]  These are just insane statements out in the open.
[01:24:48.373 --> 01:24:50.994]  The media claims Obama is vacillating on Ukraine.
[01:24:50.994 --> 01:24:51.994]  No, he's not.
[01:24:51.994 --> 01:24:53.255]  He's just not admitting.
[01:24:54.901 --> 01:24:56.102]  I don't think so.
[01:25:11.778 --> 01:25:13.841]  I mean, you've ran a lot of operations for Bain Capital.
[01:25:13.841 --> 01:25:14.742]  You're a smart guy.
[01:25:14.742 --> 01:25:16.946]  You've been around the world looking at this.
[01:25:16.946 --> 01:25:21.052]  What are your colleagues saying as well about what's going on here?
[01:25:21.052 --> 01:25:26.540]  Because a lot of the former analysts and current analysts say this is one of the most dangerous things they've ever seen.
[01:25:27.833 --> 01:25:32.415]  Well, you know, it is, and it's because we're in a dangerous cycle.
[01:25:32.415 --> 01:25:35.636]  Ever since 9-11, we call it the geopolitical cycle.
[01:25:35.636 --> 01:25:48.401]  Things were wonderful in the world from 1983 and into maybe early 2001, and then we had 9-11 hit, and it's been one terrorist attack, one civil war after the next, and this is just another thing.
[01:25:48.401 --> 01:25:49.421]  Russia broke up.
[01:25:49.941 --> 01:25:58.788]  When we started winning the Cold War, and they kind of had to surrender into the last cycle being positive, and that was a big relief for the world when that Cold War threat wore off.
[01:25:58.788 --> 01:26:00.689]  Well, we're back in it.
[01:26:00.689 --> 01:26:05.133]  And now it's the Middle East, and it's Boko Haram, and it's ISIS.
[01:26:05.133 --> 01:26:10.917]  But, you know, Russia broke up, and it's in Putin's interest to kind of put it back together.
[01:26:10.917 --> 01:26:14.880]  I mean, their demographics are poor, especially as you go forward.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.261]  Oil prices are dropping.
[01:26:16.261 --> 01:26:17.482]  The ruble has collapsed.
[01:26:18.104 --> 01:26:19.265]  They're in big trouble.
[01:26:19.265 --> 01:26:20.946]  Anything he can do to expand.
[01:26:20.946 --> 01:26:28.511]  This is exactly what Hitler did in the Great Depression when everything was down and Germany had gone through a hyperinflation crisis.
[01:26:28.511 --> 01:26:32.694]  He decided the best way to grow was to beg their neighbor, take over your neighbors.
[01:26:32.694 --> 01:26:35.376]  You know, what do they call it?
[01:26:35.376 --> 01:26:36.117]  Lebensfrauen.
[01:26:36.997 --> 01:26:56.472]  Yeah yeah hostile acquisition you know and so you know that's what he wants to do and what he does like any other guy like him when he sees an opening goes for it then he kind of backs off for a while you know so he's just looking for openings I mean he's got every reason to go into Ukraine and the question is should Europe
[01:26:56.992 --> 01:26:57.653]  And the U.S.
[01:26:57.653 --> 01:27:03.338]  fight him because we keep trying to get out of wars, but there's more civil wars in the Middle East and other places.
[01:27:03.338 --> 01:27:04.139]  And here we got this.
[01:27:04.139 --> 01:27:05.820]  These stuff do threaten trade.
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:08.703]  They do threaten a lot of things for Europe and us.
[01:27:08.703 --> 01:27:11.586]  So, you know, it's kind of this, I think, do we go in there or not?
[01:27:11.586 --> 01:27:14.428]  But it's hard to win these wars.
[01:27:14.428 --> 01:27:18.752]  And we're kind of like running out of the ability to do this sort of thing.
[01:27:18.752 --> 01:27:20.614]  But if I tell you, this geopolitical cycle,
[01:27:21.708 --> 01:27:24.309]  Um, does not turn up until around early 2020.
[01:27:24.309 --> 01:27:33.791]  So we keep telling people, whether it's more civil wars, where it's the rise in terrorist activity now in Europe, which we're not surprised at.
[01:27:33.791 --> 01:27:37.572]  ISIS getting more and more defiant and brutal.
[01:27:37.572 --> 01:27:45.414]  This is likely to continue for the next... Yeah, what does the demographic bloom in Muslims in the Middle East mean, that population explosion?
[01:27:45.414 --> 01:27:48.215]  I mean, that's just a natural thing than to invade other countries.
[01:27:49.522 --> 01:27:54.887]  Yeah, I mean, they are one of the highest demographic, you know, for births, their whole population.
[01:27:54.887 --> 01:27:58.971]  The poorer populations in general have higher birth rates.
[01:27:58.971 --> 01:28:09.661]  What I noticed the other day, I was just doing an analysis for one of our articles in our newsletters, and I was just saying, you know, look at this rising terror thing in Europe, and where does it come from, and is it all Muslims or not?
[01:28:09.661 --> 01:28:10.242]  And, you know, it's not.
[01:28:11.903 --> 01:28:18.926]  The countries, Middle East and North Africa, are the only region that have an absolute, you know, 90% plus Muslims.
[01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:20.187]  So that's number one flag.
[01:28:20.187 --> 01:28:36.614]  The second thing, which is more important to me, it's in the Middle East, with the sudden rise in wealth of oil, that these countries didn't just gradually move into the modern era, like Indonesia, or Bangladesh, or other countries, or Malaysia, that have high Muslim population.
[01:28:36.614 --> 01:28:40.096]  They were suddenly throught, you know, this wealth in the West,
[01:28:40.536 --> 01:28:44.299]  Versus the kind of backwardness and poverty of their nations.
[01:28:44.299 --> 01:28:50.323]  And then you go and turn around and look at countries like Indonesia that's almost all Muslim.
[01:28:50.323 --> 01:28:53.285]  And I've been in Indonesia twice, extensively.
[01:28:53.285 --> 01:28:56.687]  These people don't have any civil wars to speak about.
[01:28:56.687 --> 01:28:59.409]  They don't have insurgencies and all this discontent.
[01:28:59.409 --> 01:29:04.413]  So it's where you get this concentration, where you get this clash of West versus
[01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:05.994]  I don't think so.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.883]  And the West is trying to basically cut off their oil sales.
[01:29:27.883 --> 01:29:30.524]  I mean, the West is trying to kill Russia.
[01:29:30.524 --> 01:29:36.429]  And what do you expect a bear to do when it's down in a corner on its knees being attacked by 10 wolves?
[01:29:36.429 --> 01:29:38.190]  It's going to come out swinging.
[01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:41.172]  And the elite are very reckless to be pushing this.
[01:29:41.172 --> 01:29:44.635]  I mean, and that's why experts are really freaked out right now.
[01:29:44.635 --> 01:29:45.315]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:29:45.315 --> 01:29:47.657]  We'll be right back with your phone calls and our guest, Mr. Denton.
[01:29:48.237 --> 01:29:52.158]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.158 --> 01:29:59.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:05.242]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:30:05.242 --> 01:30:17.525]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation, a highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:30:17.785 --> 01:30:23.289]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:30:23.289 --> 01:30:29.234]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.

[01:30:34.198 --> 01:30:37.781]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:30:38.121 --> 01:30:44.743]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:30:44.743 --> 01:30:49.884]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:30:49.884 --> 01:30:53.625]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.

[01:30:58.706 --> 01:31:02.090]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:05.595]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[01:31:05.595 --> 01:31:11.682]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:31:11.682 --> 01:31:13.084]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:31:13.084 --> 01:31:15.187]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:31:15.287 --> 01:31:16.848]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:31:16.848 --> 01:31:21.649]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[01:31:21.649 --> 01:31:26.230]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.

[01:32:05.528 --> 01:32:06.748]  Security alert.
[01:32:06.748 --> 01:32:08.769]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:08.769 --> 01:32:09.650]  Analysis.
[01:32:09.650 --> 01:32:12.351]  InfoWars building independent media operations.
[01:32:12.351 --> 01:32:17.354]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:17.354 --> 01:32:18.374]  Prime Directive.
[01:32:18.374 --> 01:32:19.935]  Take credit, Alex Jones.
[01:32:19.935 --> 01:32:22.776]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:22.776 --> 01:32:26.018]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:26.018 --> 01:32:28.179]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:28.499 --> 01:32:29.819]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:29.819 --> 01:32:32.680]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.621]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:34.621 --> 01:32:38.662]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:32:38.662 --> 01:32:42.262]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:42.262 --> 01:32:45.623]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:32:45.623 --> 01:32:46.604]  Imperative.
[01:32:46.604 --> 01:32:48.644]  Destroy Britain's limited TV.
[01:32:48.644 --> 01:32:53.165]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:32:53.165 --> 01:32:54.706]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:32:54.706 --> 01:32:55.446]  You can feel it.
[01:33:07.541 --> 01:33:12.476]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:12.476 --> 01:33:13.900]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:20.217 --> 01:33:26.120]  Steve in North Carolina, Jerry in West Virginia, Andy in Ohio, Jeremy in Colorado, Cliff in Texas and others.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:35.344]  We're just a few minutes away from opening the phones up so you can make your statements on the economy or ask any questions of Harry Dent, harrydentresearch.com.
[01:33:35.344 --> 01:33:39.827]  You can find his books there on the site and of course all the graphs as well.
[01:33:39.827 --> 01:33:44.309]  I'm going to give him a chance to hit any other big issues that he wants to recap or cover.
[01:33:45.154 --> 01:33:56.021]  Before we go any further, but briefly here, please don't forget that it's only $5.95 a month to become an InfoWars Nightly News member.
[01:33:56.021 --> 01:34:00.845]  You go to InfoWarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:00.845 --> 01:34:02.786]  It's been around now for 14 years.
[01:34:02.786 --> 01:34:05.768]  I've been on air 20, but we've had the site for 14.
[01:34:05.768 --> 01:34:14.594]  It's got all my films, a ton of archival footage, the nightly news, special live events, rants, videos exclusive to the site.
[01:34:15.589 --> 01:34:23.995]  And your purchase, $5.95 a month, it's less than that if you sign up for a year, 20 people can use each username.
[01:34:23.995 --> 01:34:25.696]  So get your friends and family watching.
[01:34:25.696 --> 01:34:27.918]  That's 20 people at one time.
[01:34:27.918 --> 01:34:32.661]  So it's 20 memberships for $5.95 a month.
[01:34:32.661 --> 01:34:36.203]  And it is your purchase of the memberships that funds this operation.
[01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:43.909]  And again, if you vote with your dollars and promote liberty-based, hardcore, reality-based media, it will expand, it will take over.
[01:34:44.963 --> 01:34:47.365]  And we've been doing that.
[01:34:47.365 --> 01:34:54.993]  I don't know, six, seven years ago we were reaching maybe a million and a half people a day with all the different platforms.
[01:34:54.993 --> 01:34:58.697]  You know, maybe six, seven, eight million people a week.
[01:34:58.697 --> 01:35:01.459]  Now it's well over three million a day, just the radio show.
[01:35:01.459 --> 01:35:07.125]  You add it all together, we conservatively reach 20 million people.
[01:35:07.125 --> 01:35:07.926]  But here's what's different.
[01:35:09.281 --> 01:35:15.645]  Less than half of that's in the U.S., and we are popular in the U.S., but most talk shows and things, quote, target a demographic.
[01:35:15.645 --> 01:35:17.025]  We don't target a demographic.
[01:35:17.025 --> 01:35:19.027]  We target humanity.
[01:35:19.027 --> 01:35:28.812]  So we have listeners in Japan, and in South Africa, and in Russia, and in Mexico, and in Brazil, and InfoWars stickers and signs get put up all over the world.
[01:35:28.812 --> 01:35:37.397]  But that's 20 million people worldwide, from YouTube to all the different platforms that see our videos or listen to the radio show.
[01:35:38.513 --> 01:35:42.574]  We can't measure all the Facebook and Twitter and the rest of it.
[01:35:42.574 --> 01:35:44.274]  Conservatively, 20 million.
[01:35:44.274 --> 01:35:52.976]  Imagine if a fraction of the 20 million went and bought Survival Shield X2, Trudacin Iodine, that's the good halogen that so many people are deficient in.
[01:35:52.976 --> 01:35:58.337]  A, they would really get a good response and would come back and be repeat buyers.
[01:35:58.337 --> 01:36:01.877]  And then we would be massively funded to just do incredible things.
[01:36:01.877 --> 01:36:04.018]  Dwarfing what we've done so far.
[01:36:04.018 --> 01:36:06.338]  We have a fraction of a fraction of a fraction.
[01:36:07.854 --> 01:36:15.676]  Of the people that tune into this radio show or watch this television simulcast that purchase the products, look, we have our own problems.
[01:36:15.676 --> 01:36:20.418]  We can't keep in supply made-in-America t-shirts or the Molon Labe.
[01:36:20.418 --> 01:36:26.239]  In fact, I'm about to have to pull the trigger on Central American or something shirts and say we don't have American in stock.
[01:36:26.239 --> 01:36:31.401]  We just can't get it in the numbers we want of, say, the camouflage.
[01:36:33.172 --> 01:36:34.173]  And I haven't done it yet.
[01:36:34.173 --> 01:36:36.696]  The point is, is that a lot of it's just the market scale.
[01:36:36.696 --> 01:36:40.419]  We've got to gear up to a level to where we can even reach our listeners.
[01:36:40.419 --> 01:36:42.001]  So it's a symbiotic situation.
[01:36:42.001 --> 01:36:46.966]  We don't get funded like NPR with 400 plus million of taxpayer money every year.
[01:36:46.966 --> 01:36:51.390]  And they have pledge drives to push all their anti-human socialist garbage.
[01:36:52.151 --> 01:37:05.884]  We don't get billions in stimulus money like the parent company of MSNBC who then they gave over a hundred million dollars in stimulus money directly to that outfit and people like Rachel Maddow got raises off your tax money.
[01:37:05.884 --> 01:37:06.625]  They have no viewers.
[01:37:06.625 --> 01:37:08.967]  Of course they've got to be state-sponsored.
[01:37:08.967 --> 01:37:10.028]  They're really state-run media.
[01:37:10.999 --> 01:37:14.403]  We are funded by viewers and listeners like you.
[01:37:14.403 --> 01:37:15.624]  So, spread the word.
[01:37:15.624 --> 01:37:16.606]  It's having a huge effect.
[01:37:16.606 --> 01:37:17.386]  Keep it up.
[01:37:17.386 --> 01:37:18.648]  Redouble your efforts.
[01:37:18.648 --> 01:37:20.050]  We're having a big effect.
[01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:30.361]  Really creating talking points throughout the political spectrum that get us back to Americana basic ideas, not all the fake talking points to confuse the public that establishment media puts out.
[01:37:30.361 --> 01:37:31.463]  We're having a huge effect.
[01:37:32.606 --> 01:37:46.336]  And if you'll just buy the high-quality nutraceuticals, if you'll buy the Survival Shield X2 and get a free bottle of Ancient Defense when you do that, when you go and you get for Valentine's Day the Super Melo Super Phenol Vitality, you've heard the rave reviews.
[01:37:46.336 --> 01:37:47.897]  We haven't really gotten any negative reviews.
[01:37:47.897 --> 01:37:49.218]  It's going to blow you away.
[01:37:49.218 --> 01:37:50.499]  You're going to keep buying it.
[01:37:50.499 --> 01:37:53.261]  We're going to be able to self-fund and really make history together.
[01:37:53.261 --> 01:37:54.983]  So it's a win-win-win, win-win-win.
[01:37:55.683 --> 01:37:57.264]  But you gotta vote with your dollars.
[01:37:57.264 --> 01:38:02.828]  Infowarslife.com, prisonplanet.tv, or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:38:02.828 --> 01:38:11.513]  And I want to thank all of you that do purchase from us and do support us and our sponsors as well.
[01:38:11.513 --> 01:38:14.155]  Like Mr. Denton, he's not on because he became a sponsor.
[01:38:14.155 --> 01:38:16.337]  He spent a little bit of money with us, did some advertising for his book.
[01:38:16.997 --> 01:38:18.038]  I mean, that's what it's all about.
[01:38:18.038 --> 01:38:22.963]  We're all, symbiotically, who are promoting liberty and free market, working together.
[01:38:22.963 --> 01:38:28.648]  But we're at war because they've attacked us with the collectivist that are seeking to shut that down.
[01:38:28.648 --> 01:38:33.913]  That's my next question for Mr. Dent, then I want him to finish up any other points and go to calls.
[01:38:33.913 --> 01:38:38.537]  He just talks about, and you just talk about, sir, hard demographics, historical cycles.
[01:38:38.537 --> 01:38:41.500]  But you've got all the new fraudulent flash trading computers.
[01:38:42.438 --> 01:38:45.520]  You've got all the new gaming systems that you've talked about.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:53.106]  How does that fit in and how does the Cloward and Piven socialist crony capitalist model fit in where they don't care if there isn't more people?
[01:38:53.106 --> 01:39:02.452]  They don't care if things start imploding because they've decided to go into a system of artificial scarcity where people are poor as a social management system.
[01:39:02.452 --> 01:39:07.916]  I'm sure you're familiar with the UN models and Cloward and Piven and that whole school of thought.
[01:39:07.916 --> 01:39:09.878]  That's why they rationalize
[01:39:10.538 --> 01:39:17.483]  Creating such economic chaos is because the establishment, to a great extent, is exempt.
[01:39:17.483 --> 01:39:27.230]  Now they're lobbying for $100 trillion every decade in new taxes at Davos as a wealth transfer for the middle class to pacify the poor masses.
[01:39:27.230 --> 01:39:33.554]  But as we know, a lot of the Davos crowd ends up getting some of that stimulus money for themselves.
[01:39:33.554 --> 01:39:36.196]  So how do the crony capitalists feed into all this?
[01:39:37.349 --> 01:39:42.054]  Well, it happens even in more capitalistic countries like the US, especially in this part of the cycle.
[01:39:42.054 --> 01:39:44.497]  Economists talk about money supply.
[01:39:44.497 --> 01:39:53.347]  We look at money velocity, the rate at which money is turning over of its own volition, not just the Fed creating more of it magically.
[01:39:53.347 --> 01:39:55.269]  When money supply is going up,
[01:39:56.074 --> 01:39:58.855]  And above average, it means we're investing in the future.
[01:39:58.855 --> 01:40:04.697]  We're making investments that pay off with higher wages and profits and growth.
[01:40:04.697 --> 01:40:09.959]  But when it starts to go down, it means, oh, businesses and people are getting in a speculative mode.
[01:40:09.959 --> 01:40:12.580]  People are flipping condos or flipping tech stocks.
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:20.343]  Businesses are borrowing money cheap, but courtesy of the government, buying back their own stocks to exaggerate their earnings per share when they're not really growing that much.
[01:40:20.883 --> 01:40:25.186]  So you get into this speculation, and when you start doing that, bubbles build.
[01:40:25.186 --> 01:40:26.707]  You're not really making progress.
[01:40:26.707 --> 01:40:27.408]  It's artificial.
[01:40:28.266 --> 01:40:29.927]  And then these bubbles will burst.
[01:40:29.927 --> 01:40:36.152]  So we're already crossed that line by our analysis, where we're going into a deflationary mode.
[01:40:36.152 --> 01:40:44.119]  And again, you can keep creating more money, but it gets spent and lent and leveraged less and less and less.
[01:40:44.119 --> 01:40:46.381]  And all it does is create bubbles that burst.
[01:40:46.381 --> 01:40:49.283]  So this is a very, very dangerous point we're at in the economy.
[01:40:49.283 --> 01:40:54.147]  Well, I understand the lay of the land, and you broke it down very accurately, unlike any other I know.
[01:40:54.147 --> 01:40:55.067]  But what I'm getting at here,
[01:40:56.028 --> 01:41:13.620]  Is you've got this other school of thought in the ruling establishment, and it's not unified, but it's a dominant group, who openly push collectivism, socialism, and artificial scarcity, and how it's good to be poor for the general public, and how we shouldn't want better lives.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:23.908]  They're really setting up this austerity is sexy idea as a way of re-engineering the economy scientifically to basically make people poor.
[01:41:24.628 --> 01:41:25.669]  I mean, I see that happening.
[01:41:42.941 --> 01:41:54.289]  Since 2000, but the profits and the incomes and wealth going to the top 0.1%, 1% and 10% have skyrocketed as strongly as in the Roaring 20s.
[01:41:54.289 --> 01:42:00.934]  So these speculative economies, which are a lot of it is when governments push interest rates and make money free.
[01:42:01.574 --> 01:42:06.716]  And when they give out money in all types of ways or print money, it causes money to be abused.
[01:42:06.716 --> 01:42:09.818]  There is no free lunch in life because there shouldn't be.
[01:42:09.818 --> 01:42:11.539]  A free lunch gets abused.
[01:42:11.539 --> 01:42:13.339]  And we're getting this all around the world.
[01:42:13.339 --> 01:42:16.961]  It can be fake programs to say they're helping the poor.
[01:42:16.961 --> 01:42:23.204]  Most of the foreign aid overseas and to places like Africa has just gone to the warlords and the tribal leaders.
[01:42:23.644 --> 01:42:24.185]  I totally agree.
[01:42:38.422 --> 01:42:39.082]  I totally agree with you.
[01:42:39.082 --> 01:42:40.123]  That's an absolute fact.
[01:42:40.123 --> 01:42:41.864]  And so I think you just boiled it down.
[01:42:41.864 --> 01:42:47.247]  We're moving towards the warlord economy, the conquest economy, away from the free market economy.
[01:42:47.247 --> 01:42:49.068]  It's always a mix, historically.
[01:42:49.068 --> 01:42:50.109]  Nobody's perfect.
[01:42:50.109 --> 01:42:55.512]  But we're moving away from the Swiss model into the Congo model.
[01:42:55.512 --> 01:43:02.356]  Undoubtedly, and I even see elites saying they're going to have armored redoubt cities, insecters, we're all going to be in poor grids.
[01:43:02.356 --> 01:43:04.477]  They're moving towards a Hunger Games model.
[01:43:05.658 --> 01:43:11.869]  Consciously, almost like they've decided it can't be fixed anyways, so why not just embrace the warlord model?
[01:43:11.869 --> 01:43:12.910]  Where do you see that going?
[01:43:13.462 --> 01:43:16.144]  Well, I know it starts because the rich get richer.
[01:43:16.144 --> 01:43:29.296]  In any time of innovation, and I call it the fall season, like the roaring 20s or in the last decade or two, when there's innovations like information technologies moving mainstream, there's certain people that will move faster, will innovate more, will be more entrepreneurial.
[01:43:29.296 --> 01:43:35.942]  But once that starts happening, you get this elite special interest group, and all they really do is keep saying, we want more of the same.
[01:43:35.942 --> 01:43:37.203]  This is working for us.
[01:43:37.868 --> 01:43:39.069]  And so that's what's happening.
[01:43:39.069 --> 01:43:44.554]  It's got motion behind it, and the government is responding to special interests and not the people.
[01:43:44.554 --> 01:43:47.796]  I mean, it's not just free market capitalism's failing.
[01:43:47.796 --> 01:43:55.062]  It does get too greedy at times, but democracy is failing here because people are not objecting to it and are letting it happen.
[01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:59.746]  People have got to say, no, you know, we can't let the economy be rigged.
[01:43:59.746 --> 01:44:00.867]  And it is rigged.
[01:44:00.867 --> 01:44:02.148]  It's rigged in investments.
[01:44:02.148 --> 01:44:06.472]  It's rigged by the Fed pushing up stock markets, but not wages.
[01:44:07.092 --> 01:44:16.872]  Of course the average person isn't going to benefit, and the very rich are going to do better than ever, and you can only go so far until you get a revolution and people start chopping off heads.
[01:44:17.509 --> 01:44:18.009]  That's it.
[01:44:18.009 --> 01:44:38.808]  And then Soros and others are openly saying they want to take the revolution that they've helped engineer by rigging the economy and screwing everybody and then use that to engineer a false socialist revolution to bring in even more control that the very same cronies are supporting because they're offshore and exempt from it and want to work with a more centralized government.
[01:44:38.808 --> 01:44:44.373]  And that's more of a something-for-nothing economy than what happens if these bubbles burst.
[01:44:45.086 --> 01:44:56.000]  Then the cost of education is going to plummet, healthcare, a lot of things, and the rich aren't going to have this financial advantage from owning highly appreciated assets when not having to work.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.363]  It will shift the balance back to the everyday person.
[01:44:58.363 --> 01:45:00.185]  This is exactly what happened in the Great Depression.
[01:45:00.185 --> 01:45:01.427]  It was a great reset.
[01:45:01.807 --> 01:45:03.669]  We had bubbles back there in the 20s.
[01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:04.910]  It got extreme.
[01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:06.672]  Rich versus everyday people.
[01:45:06.672 --> 01:45:10.155]  When the bubbles burst, yes, it hurt the everyday person at first.
[01:45:10.155 --> 01:45:15.781]  But from then on, the everyday person's income and wealth grew faster than the richest.
[01:45:15.781 --> 01:45:17.082]  So we need this reset.
[01:45:17.082 --> 01:45:22.327]  It is false to say, oh, we can take this bubble economy and now engineer it for the everyday person.
[01:45:22.327 --> 01:45:25.050]  No, this is definitely being engineered against the everyday person.
[01:45:26.312 --> 01:45:29.994]  And I mean, I think the establishment has not been reading history books.
[01:45:29.994 --> 01:45:33.617]  Elites almost never get away with what they're attempting right now.
[01:45:33.617 --> 01:45:34.137]  Exactly.
[01:45:34.137 --> 01:45:35.638]  No, no, it never lasts.
[01:45:35.638 --> 01:45:38.720]  I just did a big issue in my newsletter on this, income inequality.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:41.181]  When it gets to these extremes, it never lasts.
[01:45:41.181 --> 01:45:47.805]  It tells you you're at the top of a major stock market and bubble peak that will not be seen for decades.
[01:45:47.805 --> 01:45:49.967]  And you're going to have to go through a big reset.
[01:45:50.487 --> 01:45:52.309]  And that's what we try to help people do in our book.
[01:45:52.309 --> 01:46:00.116]  And you know, by the way, our book today on harrydentresearch.com, it's free if you just pay shipping and handling $4.95.
[01:46:00.116 --> 01:46:01.697]  We want people to hear this.
[01:46:01.697 --> 01:46:06.362]  If you look at what we say and listen to what people like you say, it's absolutely clear what's going on.
[01:46:06.362 --> 01:46:08.444]  There's nothing unclear about it at all.
[01:46:08.444 --> 01:46:09.445]  Well, I didn't know that.
[01:46:09.445 --> 01:46:12.027]  I mean, sometimes people say free book and then it's $15 for shipping.
[01:46:14.849 --> 01:46:15.089]  $4.99?
[01:46:15.089 --> 01:46:19.151]  I mean, that really is what shipping costs.
[01:46:19.151 --> 01:46:22.512]  That's not even the cost of the handling.
[01:46:22.512 --> 01:46:23.333]  Well, that's amazing.
[01:46:23.333 --> 01:46:24.853]  So you're offering the book free today?
[01:46:24.853 --> 01:46:26.134]  For sure, yeah.
[01:46:26.134 --> 01:46:30.816]  You guys pay $5 for shipping and basically you get a free book.
[01:46:30.816 --> 01:46:32.756]  Well, harrydentresearch.com.
[01:46:32.756 --> 01:46:33.997]  Everybody needs to get the book.
[01:46:33.997 --> 01:46:34.957]  It's excellent.
[01:46:34.957 --> 01:46:36.458]  I want to go to some phone calls now.
[01:46:36.458 --> 01:46:40.579]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in North Carolina.
[01:46:40.579 --> 01:46:41.640]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:46:43.953 --> 01:46:45.333]  Hello, gentlemen.
[01:46:45.333 --> 01:46:48.894]  Go ahead.
[01:46:48.894 --> 01:46:52.375]  Your watchers have limited time and information to do researching.
[01:46:52.375 --> 01:46:57.157]  I've kind of stumbled on some information that I just wanted to verify with you guys.
[01:46:57.157 --> 01:46:58.397]  Sure, brother.
[01:46:58.397 --> 01:47:00.497]  Go ahead and ask your question.
[01:47:00.497 --> 01:47:04.579]  Basically, what it has to do with is Goldman Sachs.
[01:47:04.579 --> 01:47:07.579]  They had an article they posted back in 2007-2008 on their website called BRICS.
[01:47:10.498 --> 01:47:11.739]  Beyond.
[01:47:11.739 --> 01:47:16.882]  We gave $10 billion in bailout money to Goldman Sachs.
[01:47:16.882 --> 01:47:20.083]  It was a lot more than $10 billion worth, but yeah.
[01:47:20.083 --> 01:47:21.064]  $10 billion.
[01:47:21.064 --> 01:47:21.524]  $10 billion.
[01:47:21.524 --> 01:47:24.205]  It was a lot more than $10 billion.
[01:47:24.205 --> 01:47:24.966]  Was it?
[01:47:24.966 --> 01:47:28.348]  Like I said, limited time research is what we have.
[01:47:29.429 --> 01:47:39.954]  But what I'm getting to is that kind of threw a cog in my spokes because the IMF versus the BRICS, the petrodollar, things that are going on.
[01:47:42.566 --> 01:47:49.774]  To find out that Goldman Sachs that we bailed out is heading up and constructing the BRICS is what this document states.
[01:47:49.774 --> 01:47:51.395]  Yeah, they're heavily involved.
[01:47:51.395 --> 01:47:53.377]  It's a trilateral commission.
[01:47:53.377 --> 01:48:00.164]  They're building three giant global corporate super governments and transferring national sovereignty into those.
[01:48:00.164 --> 01:48:03.447]  Senator Goldwater leaked it all back when they were first proposing it.
[01:48:04.088 --> 01:48:11.354]  And so when they claim that the Federal Reserve System is in competition with the BRICS, it's total theater, at least at one level.
[01:48:11.354 --> 01:48:19.059]  The Russians and Chinese are wanting to move to BRICS, thinking it's their alternative, but it's part of the same larger structure, in my view.
[01:48:19.059 --> 01:48:21.001]  But that's a really great question.
[01:48:21.001 --> 01:48:21.981]  Hundreds of billions.
[01:48:22.922 --> 01:48:28.527]  Since 2008, have been given to mainly foreign banks out of the banker bailout package.
[01:48:28.527 --> 01:48:31.330]  Mr. Dent, your comment on that statement?
[01:48:31.330 --> 01:48:33.212]  Yeah, and more than that, you know, just the U.S.
[01:48:33.212 --> 01:48:37.216]  alone, three and a half trillion in free money printing.
[01:48:37.216 --> 01:48:40.859]  They buy these bonds, inject new money into the financial system.
[01:48:41.199 --> 01:48:47.103]  If they'd have given this $3.5 trillion to households, we could have sent $30,000 per household.
[01:48:47.103 --> 01:48:48.624]  Don't you think people would rather have that?
[01:48:48.624 --> 01:48:50.746]  This has all gone into financial institutions.
[01:48:50.746 --> 01:48:52.927]  It's been more like $10-11 trillion worldwide.
[01:48:52.927 --> 01:49:05.356]  So, yes, there's bailout money, there's special interest money, but this broad QE is just creating money that goes into financial institutions and turns into a gambling casino.
[01:49:06.156 --> 01:49:13.918]  Goldman Sachs makes most their money not on investment banking anymore, and these brokerage firms don't do it as much on brokerage or banks on banking.
[01:49:13.918 --> 01:49:24.020]  They're speculating on markets that are rigged where they can leverage up, borrow money for nothing, leverage up, and make high profits on low-risk investments until the bubble bursts.
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:27.321]  And then they all go down, and then they're all going to be wanting bailouts again.
[01:49:27.321 --> 01:49:31.042]  Goldman Sachs is the last person anybody should give a bailout.
[01:49:31.042 --> 01:49:32.762]  They do just fine on their own greed.
[01:49:33.382 --> 01:49:35.109]  Thank you so much, Steve.
[01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.812]  We gotta jump.
[01:49:35.812 --> 01:49:37.398]  Jerry in West Virginia, go ahead.
[01:49:39.492 --> 01:49:41.613]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[01:49:41.613 --> 01:49:46.156]  I'm calling for the closure of the United Nations in New York.
[01:49:46.156 --> 01:49:49.377]  It is the biggest joke and the waste of money.
[01:49:49.377 --> 01:49:54.560]  It appears to be doing nothing, never did anything, and it just... Well, it's trying to usurp U.S.
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.561]  sovereignty, so I mean, it does do something.
[01:49:56.561 --> 01:49:58.622]  It basically is a criminal organization.
[01:49:58.622 --> 01:49:59.603]  I beg your difference.
[01:49:59.603 --> 01:50:03.265]  I don't think it does anything, but I think with the collapse of the U.S.,
[01:50:04.205 --> 01:50:13.872]  The only outlet we have is to start a war with Ukraine, to get everybody taken away from the realities of the war, just like sports do.
[01:50:13.872 --> 01:50:27.823]  And thirdly, I would like to see everybody out the politicians, and out their foibles, and out their roundabout ideas, and then begin to really put the pressure on the politicians that they fess up to their faults.
[01:50:28.483 --> 01:50:34.586]  And that may be a way of getting back at some of the revenge we need to do at the moment.
[01:50:34.586 --> 01:50:37.687]  I'm 73, and I'm worried about the future of Social Security.
[01:50:37.687 --> 01:50:38.588]  No, I hear you, brother.
[01:50:38.588 --> 01:50:38.908]  I hear you.
[01:50:38.908 --> 01:50:40.268]  They're planning to loot that.
[01:50:40.268 --> 01:50:41.249]  Quick question for Dent.
[01:50:41.249 --> 01:50:42.650]  He can answer it after the break.
[01:50:42.650 --> 01:50:44.590]  Do you have any questions for Dent?
[01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:45.811]  Yes, I have a question.
[01:50:45.811 --> 01:50:47.832]  What's happening to Social Security?
[01:50:47.832 --> 01:50:48.812]  Great question, Jerry.
[01:50:48.812 --> 01:50:51.293]  We'll try to answer that straight ahead.
[01:50:51.293 --> 01:50:53.694]  They're getting ready to loot the education funds.
[01:50:53.694 --> 01:50:55.775]  That ought to tell you where they're going.
[01:50:55.775 --> 01:50:56.736]  Private education funds.

[01:51:58.249 --> 01:52:01.632]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[01:52:01.632 --> 01:52:05.135]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[01:52:05.135 --> 01:52:11.219]  What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:52:11.219 --> 01:52:12.340]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:14.821]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:52:14.821 --> 01:52:16.382]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:52:16.382 --> 01:52:21.105]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[01:52:21.105 --> 01:52:25.708]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[01:52:25.708 --> 01:52:28.350]  How we can come together and win the human race.

[01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:59.931]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:52:59.931 --> 01:53:03.574]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:53:03.574 --> 01:53:04.935]  A pair of scissors.
[01:53:04.935 --> 01:53:10.718]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[01:53:10.718 --> 01:53:15.642]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:53:15.642 --> 01:53:16.622]  The phone line.
[01:53:16.622 --> 01:53:21.886]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:53:21.886 --> 01:53:25.628]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:53:25.768 --> 01:53:29.092]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:53:29.092 --> 01:53:31.556]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:53:31.556 --> 01:53:35.901]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[01:53:35.901 --> 01:53:37.003]  Scissors can't cut it.

[01:54:15.377 --> 01:54:15.957]  Welcome back.
[01:54:15.957 --> 01:54:17.337]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:17.337 --> 01:54:19.838]  We've got Mr. Dent five minutes in the next hour, then he'll be gone.
[01:54:19.838 --> 01:54:27.681]  We'll take three or four more calls in this segment, then a few more in the next segment, then I'm going to shift gears into all the world news and breaking news we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:54:27.681 --> 01:54:30.061]  For me, this is what the world boils down to.
[01:54:30.061 --> 01:54:35.443]  You've got government by conquest, government by liberty, innovation, free market, freedom.
[01:54:35.443 --> 01:54:37.664]  And again, you're always somewhere in that spectrum.
[01:54:39.156 --> 01:54:50.283]  But you have a lot of special interests that want the command and control, controlled markets, where they use the government to set up an economic system where the old robber barons are in control and nobody else is.
[01:54:50.283 --> 01:54:51.464]  And that's where we're going.
[01:54:51.464 --> 01:55:04.012]  And then there's scapegoating capitalism that brought us here, even partial capitalism, as the problem, and saying socialism and communism and collectivism is the answer, when it's a nightmare.
[01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:11.956]  And if you look at what they've done all over the world, they get you addicted to these pension funds, public and private, then they loot them, then they take them.
[01:55:11.956 --> 01:55:16.120]  And now they're announcing they want to take over and tax education funds.
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:19.043]  They want to start taking, you know, to quote, protect them.
[01:55:19.043 --> 01:55:21.965]  So I don't think the stock market's safe.
[01:55:21.965 --> 01:55:24.007]  I don't think 401ks are safe.
[01:55:24.007 --> 01:55:28.451]  And I've always said this because I've seen the very same globalists steal these things
[01:55:29.312 --> 01:55:30.773]  Buy increment all over the world.
[01:55:30.773 --> 01:55:36.879]  Now, maybe Harry Dent has something else to say about this, but what's your view?
[01:55:36.879 --> 01:55:39.221]  Well, again, we see this extreme income inequality.
[01:55:39.221 --> 01:55:41.102]  It's always a sign of that's what's happening.
[01:55:41.102 --> 01:55:45.826]  The oligarchs, like you say, business people say they love the free market system.
[01:55:45.826 --> 01:55:46.587]  They do not.
[01:55:46.587 --> 01:55:50.490]  They always want a monopoly or a government favored position if they can get them.
[01:55:50.490 --> 01:55:54.534]  So that special interest just should not be allowed to lobby, period.
[01:55:54.534 --> 01:55:55.815]  That'd be my first rule.
[01:55:56.475 --> 01:55:58.655]  I want to go back to calls.
[01:55:58.655 --> 01:56:00.716]  What happens, though, to Social Security?
[01:56:00.716 --> 01:56:02.136]  What do you think about its future?
[01:56:25.202 --> 01:56:28.285]  Well, they're going to have to restructure that in a lot of ways.
[01:56:28.285 --> 01:56:31.268]  There's $67 trillion in unfunded entitlements.
[01:56:31.268 --> 01:56:36.533]  That's more than our total government and private debt at $60 trillion a day, which is way more than people think.
[01:56:36.533 --> 01:56:39.036]  So I count about $129 trillion.
[01:56:39.036 --> 01:56:42.119]  Unfunded entitlements, like a company that promised pension or health
[01:56:42.199 --> 01:56:52.166]  There are more than 70 towns, I was reading years ago in the LA Times, in California, where the average bureaucrat is retiring on half million dollar salaries.
[01:56:52.166 --> 01:56:54.967]  I mean, that is insane, where you've got city managers getting paid $800,000 a year.
[01:56:57.742 --> 01:56:57.882]  Yeah.
[01:57:18.744 --> 01:57:20.525]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[01:57:20.525 --> 01:57:22.846]  Long time fan, first time caller.
[01:57:22.846 --> 01:57:23.967]  My question's pretty simple.
[01:57:23.967 --> 01:57:24.687]  I'm 29 years old.
[01:57:24.687 --> 01:57:27.348]  I have a family of three, wife and a young child.
[01:57:27.348 --> 01:57:31.470]  What are some things on a small level that I can do
[01:57:43.195 --> 01:57:51.899]  Well, you know, self-employed, you have more flexibility.
[01:57:51.899 --> 01:57:59.283]  I would do everything to cut your costs, increase your income in your business, if you can do some things part-time outside of your business.
[01:57:59.283 --> 01:58:01.524]  Cash and cash flow are king here.
[01:58:01.524 --> 01:58:07.006]  But you've got to realize, what I tell people, it's going to be the young people that are going to win when this bubble bursts.
[01:58:07.006 --> 01:58:10.468]  Because the price of education, which is the worst thing that can happen to younger people,
[01:58:10.788 --> 01:58:11.528]  That's right.
[01:58:11.528 --> 01:58:15.350]  Hard-working people end up coming out on top during a depression.
[01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:18.652]  But hard-working people get screwed during these rigged economies.
[01:58:18.652 --> 01:58:21.913]  We'll be right back in one minute with the third hour.
[01:58:21.913 --> 01:58:22.193]  Stay with us.
[01:58:39.417 --> 01:58:42.839]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.839 --> 01:58:48.682]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:48.682 --> 01:58:52.063]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[01:58:52.063 --> 01:58:55.565]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[01:58:55.565 --> 01:59:01.648]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:59:01.648 --> 01:59:03.029]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:59:03.029 --> 01:59:05.170]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:59:05.250 --> 01:59:06.831]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:59:06.831 --> 01:59:11.613]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers and the rest of the garbage.
[01:59:11.613 --> 01:59:16.195]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[01:59:16.195 --> 01:59:18.857]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[01:59:18.857 --> 01:59:26.900]  And to celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month, we're slashing prices on InfoWarsLife.com products like Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:29.862]  The sale is only running for the month, 20% off and there's a lot of other
[01:59:30.402 --> 01:59:32.403]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:04.810 --> 02:00:09.656]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.

[02:00:11.237 --> 02:00:12.779]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.779 --> 02:00:16.984]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.984 --> 02:00:21.489]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.489 --> 02:00:22.690]  Jeremy Cliff
[02:00:27.628 --> 02:00:29.929]  Dylan, Slim, Seth, we'll get to all of you.
[02:00:29.929 --> 02:00:33.870]  Mr. Dent is going to be with us until 20 after this five-minute segment and the next 12-minute segment.
[02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:41.513]  Then I will get into some of the other economic news, some of the other world news I've not hit on yet.
[02:00:41.513 --> 02:00:46.834]  But going back to the phone calls, Jeremy in Colorado, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:00:46.834 --> 02:00:49.955]  Go ahead.
[02:00:49.955 --> 02:00:51.136]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:51.136 --> 02:00:51.756]  Hi, Harry.
[02:00:51.756 --> 02:00:52.976]  I was going to ask about
[02:00:55.438 --> 02:01:12.146]  Student loans and the potential of using precious metals to offset the accelerating effects when the time comes to, I don't know, I anticipate the death of the dollar as a world reserve status.
[02:01:12.146 --> 02:01:14.308]  I anticipate that as inevitable.
[02:01:14.308 --> 02:01:18.850]  And I'm wondering if it would be a good way to negate some of the
[02:01:20.474 --> 02:01:25.455]  Well, I've got another question, but I want him to answer yours.
[02:01:25.455 --> 02:01:32.397]  What about Obama saying they're going to give people free college, but then if you actually read the fine print, you just pay for it all in the second half?
[02:01:32.397 --> 02:01:35.777]  I mean, we're in such debt, and they're like, free, free, free, you'll get everything free.
[02:01:35.777 --> 02:01:36.957]  This is insane.
[02:01:36.957 --> 02:01:44.899]  But what about, you know, his question about student loans and, you know, I guess keeping gold, hoping later it goes up in value so you can then pay off your loans?
[02:01:46.069 --> 02:01:48.050]  Well, first of all, the student loan thing is a bubble.
[02:01:48.050 --> 02:01:50.272]  Now there's more of that than credit cards.
[02:01:50.272 --> 02:01:58.038]  It's because education costs are in a bubble and people who don't already have rich parents can't afford to get into college anymore without getting heavily in debt.
[02:01:58.038 --> 02:02:00.800]  So that's a terrible thing for the future.
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:02.841]  Gold is not the solution.
[02:02:02.841 --> 02:02:05.964]  This is one of the things we have warned and we've been right about.
[02:02:05.964 --> 02:02:09.106]  We argue with Peter Schiff, people who agree with us about the debt.
[02:02:09.646 --> 02:02:13.489]  And then the stimulus, you know, being artificial and not sustainable.
[02:02:13.489 --> 02:02:15.931]  Gold is an inflation hedge.
[02:02:15.931 --> 02:02:17.972]  In the 70s, it was a great hedge.
[02:02:17.972 --> 02:02:20.234]  Gold does not like deflation.
[02:02:20.234 --> 02:02:22.296]  When bubbles burst, money gets destroyed.
[02:02:22.296 --> 02:02:30.001]  Wealth suddenly disappears when stocks are worth, you know, $4,000 on the Dow one day and $20,000, you know, previous.
[02:02:30.001 --> 02:02:34.164]  Debts, half of the private debt in this country, like in the Great Depression, are going to be written off.
[02:02:34.164 --> 02:02:37.627]  That is money that was created out of thin air by banks disappear.
[02:02:38.207 --> 02:02:41.910]  The central banks have created money that's going to disappear at some point.
[02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:50.015]  And by the way, Harry, I don't disagree with you overall, but I bought most of my gold at $300 to $500 an ounce, and I'm still holding it, whether it goes up or down as an emergency backup.
[02:02:50.015 --> 02:02:52.216]  I don't think it should be more than 10% of what people do.
[02:02:52.216 --> 02:02:53.757]  A small amount.
[02:02:53.757 --> 02:02:58.340]  A small amount, especially because in certain times, I'd rather have silver coins than gold.
[02:02:58.340 --> 02:02:58.960]  Sure.
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:00.021]  More tradable.
[02:03:00.021 --> 02:03:02.663]  Oh yeah, I've got more silver than I've got gold, but just expanding on that,
[02:03:03.443 --> 02:03:06.347]  I mean, Schiff is right in line with your predictions.
[02:03:06.347 --> 02:03:09.510]  He's made a lot of the similar predictions have been right.
[02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:13.294]  I'm seeing long term, though, there's so much volatility.
[02:03:13.294 --> 02:03:15.196]  I don't think we can say either way.
[02:03:15.196 --> 02:03:19.701]  You may disagree with that, but just honing in on gold here for just a moment, though,
[02:03:22.105 --> 02:03:25.388]  Even though the Chinese and others are hoarding it, you just still think it's going to be going down?
[02:03:25.388 --> 02:03:30.732]  Because even though we've seen other commodities plunging, gold's actually gone up some, right?
[02:03:30.732 --> 02:03:31.292]  No, no.
[02:03:31.292 --> 02:03:34.575]  Gold was at $19.34, and it recently got to $11.50.
[02:03:34.575 --> 02:03:37.137]  It's gone down as much as iron ore.
[02:03:37.137 --> 02:03:38.198]  Not quite as much as oil.
[02:03:38.198 --> 02:03:42.681]  Oil's also- Well, I know it's been going down overall the last few years, but it had been bouncing up a little bit.
[02:03:42.681 --> 02:03:43.822]  Well, it bounced the last couple months.
[02:03:43.822 --> 02:03:45.003]  Well, oil's bouncing right now.
[02:03:45.003 --> 02:03:45.844]  It's not going to last.
[02:03:46.304 --> 02:03:53.826]  We've been predicting gold would bounce, maybe up to about $1,314, maybe even $1,400, but I think it's going down.
[02:03:53.826 --> 02:04:04.769]  We've got a number of commodity charts on our book, and it shows when you trade sideways after a major surge for a number of years, it's oil and gold and silver and copper, and then break down below that, then you're dead.
[02:04:04.769 --> 02:04:08.410]  I mean, we told you, when oil broke $1,525, it was over.
[02:04:08.410 --> 02:04:10.771]  When oil broke $80, it's over for a long time.
[02:04:11.852 --> 02:04:15.893]  Gold, the last time it peaked in silver was with the commodity cycle back in 1980.
[02:04:15.893 --> 02:04:26.334]  Well, commodity cycles have peaked again, so we've been warning gold's gonna go down more than up, and it is the best protection in an inflationary season like the 70s.
[02:04:26.334 --> 02:04:35.076]  It is not the best protection in a deflationary debt deleveraging season like the 30s, and that is where I have differed with Peter Schiff, and he's been wrong, and I've been right.
[02:04:35.076 --> 02:04:36.136]  Gold keeps going down.
[02:04:36.136 --> 02:04:38.917]  He keeps saying it's gonna go to 5,000 to 10,000.
[02:04:38.917 --> 02:04:40.077]  I don't think it gets above 1,500.
[02:04:41.377 --> 02:04:42.399]  All right, Harry, stay there.
[02:04:42.399 --> 02:04:43.220]  Thank you, caller.
[02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:44.642]  That was a good question.
[02:04:44.642 --> 02:04:45.584]  Cliff and others.
[02:04:45.584 --> 02:04:48.228]  We're going to go right to you after this break.
[02:04:48.228 --> 02:04:52.374]  Cliff's listening in Texas on 92.1 FM.

[02:07:12.515 --> 02:07:14.658]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[02:07:14.718 --> 02:07:16.299]  The establishment is the opposite.
[02:07:16.299 --> 02:07:21.083]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.

[02:08:10.130 --> 02:08:14.375]  I know you can see me now, here's a surprise.
[02:08:20.890 --> 02:08:22.712]  Harry Dent's with us for 12 more minutes.
[02:08:22.712 --> 02:08:24.733]  Let's get to as many of your calls as possible.
[02:08:24.733 --> 02:08:30.058]  And Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs is in studio with us to break down what's really happening in Russia.
[02:08:30.058 --> 02:08:33.701]  Now here's the story from three months ago, back in October.
[02:08:33.701 --> 02:08:36.604]  Russia, or it's more than three months ago, five months ago.
[02:08:36.604 --> 02:08:39.827]  Russia deploying tactical nuclear arms in Crimea.
[02:08:40.447 --> 02:08:43.569]  NATO's tactical nuclear weapons must go.
[02:08:43.569 --> 02:08:45.710]  Being moved in up against Russia.
[02:08:45.710 --> 02:08:48.432]  Does Russia think their new nuclear weapons could win a war?
[02:08:48.432 --> 02:08:50.513]  Forbes.
[02:08:50.513 --> 02:08:51.694]  No longer unthinkable.
[02:08:51.694 --> 02:08:52.334]  Should U.S.
[02:08:52.334 --> 02:08:54.536]  ready for limited nuclear war?
[02:08:54.536 --> 02:08:57.437]  Breaking out of defense.
[02:08:57.437 --> 02:09:00.719]  Russia has threatened nuclear attacks, says Ukraine Defense Minister.
[02:09:00.719 --> 02:09:02.200]  Newsweek.
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:07.984]  Well, we saw an explosion that looks like a nuke and damaged houses 15 miles away.
[02:09:07.984 --> 02:09:09.605]  I'm not saying it's not a chemical plant.
[02:09:10.322 --> 02:09:14.305]  But it's not getting a lot of attention in Ukraine, and it looks bad.
[02:09:14.305 --> 02:09:20.769]  And I've grown up in Texas and seen chemical plants blow up, and they have multiple explosions afterwards that are just as big or bigger.
[02:09:20.769 --> 02:09:27.433]  So, this does not look like anything I've ever seen but a nuke.
[02:09:27.433 --> 02:09:33.857]  That doesn't mean that it was a nuke, but it's okay to ask that question, because we're not getting the truth out of Russia.
[02:09:33.857 --> 02:09:34.478]  That's coming up.
[02:09:34.918 --> 02:09:35.798]  Uh, right now.
[02:09:35.798 --> 02:09:36.939]  Cliff, thanks for holding.
[02:09:36.939 --> 02:09:39.319]  You're listening on 90.1 in Austin.
[02:09:39.319 --> 02:09:40.100]  Uh, go ahead, Cliff.
[02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:41.960]  You're on the air.
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:42.480]  Well, sure.
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:44.241]  Hey, uh, glad I got you.
[02:09:44.241 --> 02:09:49.562]  Hey, uh, have you ever heard of the, uh, Shemitah by Jonathan Cahn?
[02:09:49.562 --> 02:09:52.643]  Uh, you know, my audio's breaking up a little bit from you.
[02:09:52.643 --> 02:09:54.784]  Maybe you're clear to dent, but I can't really understand you.
[02:09:54.784 --> 02:09:57.224]  Have I ever heard of what?
[02:09:57.224 --> 02:09:57.745]  The Shemitah.
[02:09:57.745 --> 02:09:59.645]  It's a book by Jonathan Cahn.
[02:09:59.645 --> 02:10:01.646]  Uh, no, I haven't.
[02:10:01.646 --> 02:10:02.246]  Tell us about it.
[02:10:03.826 --> 02:10:07.871]  Well, he gives the aspect of everything that's been happening in our world.
[02:10:07.871 --> 02:10:12.235]  God has allowed it to happen because we haven't been following his ways.
[02:10:13.689 --> 02:10:19.770]  But I would suggest that you get the book because it says a lot about our country in it and what's going to happen.
[02:10:19.770 --> 02:10:22.171]  And this is only part of what's been going on.
[02:10:22.171 --> 02:10:27.912]  And so it's not allowed that World Church Center to be bought down because of our arrogance.
[02:10:27.912 --> 02:10:33.493]  Well, I do think that great wealth creates great decadence and arrogance and then corruption sets in.
[02:10:33.493 --> 02:10:35.013]  And I am a Christian.
[02:10:35.013 --> 02:10:39.414]  One of my biggest problems is the establishment churches are telling people not to be politically involved.
[02:10:40.815 --> 02:10:43.456]  And so America's moral compass seems to be broken.
[02:10:43.456 --> 02:10:47.099]  Let me get Mr. Dent's take on that.
[02:10:47.099 --> 02:10:48.860]  Yeah, no, I just find the same thing.
[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:52.903]  I don't comment on religion because, you know, you turn off people or not.
[02:10:52.903 --> 02:10:54.083]  But I see the same thing.
[02:10:54.083 --> 02:11:00.127]  When things get this extreme in wealth and stuff, everything gets corrupted by the special interests.
[02:11:00.127 --> 02:11:07.012]  A small group of people have so much power at every level in religion and politics and business.
[02:11:08.032 --> 02:11:10.434]  That it cannot be any other way.
[02:11:10.434 --> 02:11:12.716]  That's why we have cycles.
[02:11:12.716 --> 02:11:19.620]  You know, God, the universe, natural systems never go too far in one direction without resetting and going the other direction.
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:22.482]  We can't go up forever without getting way out of balance.
[02:11:22.482 --> 02:11:23.443]  And we can't go down.
[02:11:23.443 --> 02:11:25.824]  And when things go up, people think they'll go up forever.
[02:11:25.824 --> 02:11:27.525]  And that's why I talk to people.
[02:11:27.525 --> 02:11:28.566]  I prove to them otherwise.
[02:11:28.866 --> 02:11:31.730]  And when things go down, people think it'll go down forever.
[02:11:31.730 --> 02:11:33.012]  Neither is true.
[02:11:33.012 --> 02:11:34.895]  These ups and downs correct each other.
[02:11:34.895 --> 02:11:38.520]  That's why capitalism works better than top-down planning.
[02:11:41.794 --> 02:11:43.636]  I just had the crew pop in my head.
[02:11:43.636 --> 02:11:49.921]  We're actually going to be interviewing on air next month the author of the book that the caller just raised.
[02:11:49.921 --> 02:11:54.805]  So, thank you, caller, for calling in with that information.
[02:11:54.805 --> 02:12:04.753]  Now, before we go any further with our guest, and by the way, that book is, he's also written the book The Harbinger.
[02:12:05.453 --> 02:12:12.276]  Again, if you're a radio listener and it sounds like I'm bumbling around, it's because they're flashing stuff on screen in live time.
[02:12:12.276 --> 02:12:20.099]  So this is a transmission where we're very interactive and things are unfolding as we go along here.
[02:12:20.099 --> 02:12:23.440]  Let's go ahead now and go to another caller.
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:25.921]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dylan in Illinois.
[02:12:25.921 --> 02:12:26.762]  Dylan, you're on the air.
[02:12:35.726 --> 02:12:49.819]  Real estate prices to go down and causing slow growth in their economy in the last four months and it's like the Texas housing boom and retail stores are closing and malls are closing.
[02:12:49.819 --> 02:12:55.405]  How do you know if a real estate crash is coming from China's biggest bubble?
[02:12:56.584 --> 02:13:05.887]  Well, I mean, you know, Dent's been saying that China's going to be the big place to see the bubble probably first break, and I just saw the Chinese government come out and revise their numbers last week.
[02:13:05.887 --> 02:13:13.028]  I saw a lot of analysts say that clearly now China has crested and is starting to really accelerate a downward spiral.
[02:13:13.028 --> 02:13:14.649]  Can you elaborate on that, Harry?
[02:13:15.615 --> 02:13:30.223]  Yeah, first of all, China, I mean, China has to be growing slower than they say, because they never tell you the truth there, or commodity prices wouldn't be falling, because China is the largest buyer of commodities to feed their export and industrial machine in the world now, by far.
[02:13:31.124 --> 02:13:33.126]  So, I mean, that's one thing.
[02:13:33.126 --> 02:13:39.332]  Yes, commodities going down and oil is good for the everyday person long term, but it is going to cause some huge disruption.
[02:13:39.332 --> 02:13:42.476]  There's $6 trillion owed in U.S.
[02:13:42.476 --> 02:13:50.464]  dollars to banks and bondholders from emerging country companies who depend on commodity prices, and they're going to start defaulting.
[02:13:50.464 --> 02:13:51.265]  These frackers
[02:13:51.764 --> 02:14:00.006]  Who invested a trillion dollars, created a million jobs, like you say, especially in Texas, and a whole real estate boom that went much stronger than the last one there.
[02:14:00.006 --> 02:14:03.387]  That's going to implode because these guys are dead.
[02:14:03.387 --> 02:14:07.107]  They have to have over $80 to really make it long term.
[02:14:07.107 --> 02:14:10.848]  And under $55, they really start doing terrible.
[02:14:10.848 --> 02:14:13.449]  They're not going to reinvest when their wells run out.
[02:14:13.449 --> 02:14:15.729]  They're not going to be able to pay back their debts.
[02:14:15.729 --> 02:14:16.989]  And you got a half a trillion there.
[02:14:16.989 --> 02:14:19.390]  So I actually see this oil collapse.
[02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:25.552]  As a trigger for the next worldwide debt crisis, we have way more debt than anybody knows.
[02:14:25.552 --> 02:14:29.013]  All it takes is a trigger, just like the subprime crisis.
[02:14:29.013 --> 02:14:30.793]  It wasn't the whole crisis last time.
[02:14:30.793 --> 02:14:35.455]  It was the trigger that got the markets to start thinking about debt and worrying about debt.
[02:14:35.455 --> 02:14:40.156]  And the more you look around and worry about debt, you say, holy smokes, we got more debt than anybody knows.
[02:14:40.156 --> 02:14:41.217]  And the whole thing comes down.
[02:14:41.217 --> 02:14:43.958]  So I think this is a very important trigger.
[02:14:43.958 --> 02:14:46.718]  I've been telling people, watch oil to finally bounce here.
[02:14:46.718 --> 02:14:48.119]  And boy, it's barely bouncing.
[02:14:48.763 --> 02:14:49.564]  So you don't think oil is stabilized?
[02:14:49.564 --> 02:14:51.105]  You think more volatility is coming?
[02:15:13.309 --> 02:15:17.191]  We've said for a long time, oil, if it broke $80, it's dead, which it did.
[02:15:17.191 --> 02:15:25.818]  It's ultimately going to $10 to $20 in the next several years, but it'll probably vary between $10 and maybe... So it still will be volatile just going down overall?
[02:15:26.471 --> 02:15:30.774]  Yeah, it's not just going to go down and stay down, but it's going to be between 10 and 70.
[02:15:30.774 --> 02:15:33.796]  Most oil companies can't make it over 45 traditional ones.
[02:15:33.796 --> 02:15:36.839]  Most frackers can't make it under 55.
[02:15:36.839 --> 02:15:37.639]  What did it though?
[02:15:37.639 --> 02:15:43.924]  I mean, it was already glut was going in that direction, but the Saudis, are they just trying to pick the time it starts its descent?
[02:15:44.687 --> 02:15:47.930]  Well, the Saudis are playing like Rockefeller in the early 1900s.
[02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:52.695]  They are the low-cost producer with some of the largest reserves.
[02:15:52.695 --> 02:15:57.100]  They're not cutting their production because they want prices to go down.
[02:15:57.100 --> 02:16:00.964]  They want to eliminate their competition so they can be a dominant producer.
[02:16:01.564 --> 02:16:08.927]  They're going to knock out the frackers, they're going to knock out the tar sands in Canada, Venezuela, and Iran.
[02:16:08.927 --> 02:16:12.789]  Many countries like that are just going to fall by the wayside and never come back.
[02:16:12.789 --> 02:16:16.270]  That means Saudi Arabia is going to have higher prices and more dominant power.
[02:16:16.270 --> 02:16:18.511]  And Venezuela then will completely implode.
[02:16:18.511 --> 02:16:20.512]  Oh yeah, Venezuela's dead.
[02:16:20.512 --> 02:16:24.673]  I mean, they can't even make it at 100 near the last 55.
[02:16:24.673 --> 02:16:26.834]  And so that's why their lights aren't on now half the time.
[02:16:26.834 --> 02:16:28.675]  They are already rotting.
[02:16:28.675 --> 02:16:28.855]  Yeah.
[02:16:30.765 --> 02:16:35.449]  Russia, I mean, oil and energy is their largest export sector.
[02:16:35.449 --> 02:16:44.137]  And their government... Can you imagine, they've got a communist government that's run everybody off, kicked all the entrepreneurs out, and now their oil economy's dead.
[02:16:44.137 --> 02:16:47.720]  That is going to be a hellhole inside a hellhole.
[02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:49.681]  Caller, thank you so much, really great question.
[02:16:50.606 --> 02:16:58.493]  You know what scares me, Harry, is that I don't think I've ever historically seen a bubble this big or this prolonged.
[02:16:58.493 --> 02:17:04.638]  So it looks like when the mega-bubble starts popping, it could create a cascade into all these other bubbles.
[02:17:04.638 --> 02:17:11.044]  And, I mean, this could create a Road Warrior-like scenario of collapse if it really goes down.
[02:17:11.044 --> 02:17:16.469]  And, I mean, the general public is so spoiled, on average, I expect this to be explosive.
[02:17:17.557 --> 02:17:18.298]  Yeah, no, I do too.
[02:17:18.298 --> 02:17:28.546]  I mean, not only every bubble in history has gotten greater because our incomes and wealth are greater, and then we can leverage more through debt off that wealth, so the bubbles get greater, but this has been extended.
[02:17:28.546 --> 02:17:33.250]  This bubble should have peaked in 2007 and crashed and never come back.
[02:17:33.250 --> 02:17:40.456]  Instead, we had a first bubble in 2000 crash, a second one in 2007, and now a third one into early 2015.
[02:17:40.456 --> 02:17:45.600]  I say, and I predict strong, this is the last bubble because the last bubble has been totally artificial.
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:46.361]  The other ones had,
[02:17:46.821 --> 02:17:50.524]  Demographic and technology trends behind them, they were just exaggerated.
[02:17:50.524 --> 02:17:52.726]  So this is the last bubble?
[02:17:52.726 --> 02:17:53.487]  This is the last bubble.
[02:17:53.487 --> 02:17:55.389]  When this one ends, they all go.
[02:17:55.389 --> 02:17:57.190]  Real estate around the world.
[02:17:57.190 --> 02:18:00.113]  The last time, okay, Spain went, Ireland went, U.S.
[02:18:00.113 --> 02:18:00.373]  went.
[02:18:00.373 --> 02:18:01.874]  Before that, Japan.
[02:18:01.874 --> 02:18:04.897]  I think all real estate bubbles just about are going to burst.
[02:18:04.897 --> 02:18:07.339]  All commodity bubbles and all stock bubbles.
[02:18:07.339 --> 02:18:08.720]  Because that's what they've done.
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:10.862]  Investors have jumped from one bubble to the next and
[02:18:10.962 --> 02:18:17.926]  But we have record low savings, record low entrepreneurial spirit, record numbers of people on welfare.
[02:18:17.926 --> 02:18:20.308]  You look at the equations, we have a major depression.
[02:18:20.308 --> 02:18:23.030]  It is going to be hell on earth.
[02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.190]  Yeah.
[02:18:24.159 --> 02:18:25.780]  But that's what it takes to get a reset.
[02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:27.962]  I mean, the 30s was the worst time in U.S.
[02:18:27.962 --> 02:18:31.604]  history, but the crisis really only lasted three years.
[02:18:31.604 --> 02:18:35.547]  The whole system reset itself, and then we started to grow again.
[02:18:35.547 --> 02:18:41.090]  All this stuff about Roosevelt, you know, building all this stuff, pulling us out, that was not the real thing.
[02:18:41.090 --> 02:18:50.717]  The system went through a huge reset, huge debt deleveraging, the cost of living went down, and then things turned around, and it was led by the middle class household.
[02:18:50.717 --> 02:18:53.839]  It wasn't led by a bunch of special interests.
[02:18:54.419 --> 02:18:56.581]  That's well known, but they try to hide that fact.
[02:18:56.581 --> 02:18:58.103]  Well, we're in for it.
[02:18:58.103 --> 02:19:00.005]  I got other callers here, but you got to go.
[02:19:00.005 --> 02:19:02.507]  We got Slim and Seth and John and Louis.

[02:19:06.331 --> 02:19:09.734]  It's just really frightening as a father to see the government
[02:19:10.154 --> 02:19:12.256]  Law enforcement and security systems would be a good business.
[02:19:37.057 --> 02:19:38.899]  Absolutely, in a very dangerous business.
[02:19:38.899 --> 02:19:40.321]  You're going to see that expanding.
[02:19:40.321 --> 02:19:41.883]  Thank you so much for your time.

[02:21:37.351 --> 02:21:43.555]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:21:43.955 --> 02:21:49.096]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[02:23:21.238 --> 02:23:22.539]  We're good to go.
[02:23:22.539 --> 02:23:22.959]  We're good to go.
[02:23:50.689 --> 02:23:52.331]  You must read this report.
[02:23:52.331 --> 02:23:53.352]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:24:14.642 --> 02:24:19.266]  I'm gonna go back to some of your phone calls right now ahead of Joe Biggs joining us.
[02:24:19.266 --> 02:24:29.335]  If there was a tactical nuclear weapon used as a warning to the West by the Russians or somebody else in Ukraine, we would not be told about it on the news.
[02:24:29.335 --> 02:24:32.778]  And just so you know, nuclear weapons have been used in war before.
[02:24:32.778 --> 02:24:38.343]  There's a lot of evidence they were used in Korea, smaller ones, and that
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:51.105]  Of course, the head of the military at that time in the Pacific operations, MacArthur, was relieved of command because he was about to call in larger attacks.
[02:24:53.496 --> 02:25:00.379]  The Nazis used some atomic weapons on the Eastern Front, but they were small and weren't high yield.
[02:25:00.379 --> 02:25:02.179]  And that's actually in mainline history.
[02:25:02.179 --> 02:25:10.122]  It's just the official story of Fat Boy and Little Boy and Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we're told, is the first time they were used.
[02:25:10.122 --> 02:25:12.523]  And quite frankly, that's just not the case.
[02:25:12.523 --> 02:25:15.584]  Well, it's the first time they were used in war, but not the last.
[02:25:15.584 --> 02:25:21.066]  And I've seen a bunch of articles in Popular Mechanics, you name it, the last 10 years about, you know, nukes are safe.
[02:25:21.066 --> 02:25:23.047]  We can start using smaller ones in war.
[02:25:24.363 --> 02:25:25.103]  Yes sir, can you hear me?
[02:25:53.246 --> 02:25:59.350]  Okay, well I was just on the call because I got to thinking about some things.
[02:25:59.350 --> 02:26:04.593]  I'm actually a pretty good fan of you and I listen to you on occasions.
[02:26:04.593 --> 02:26:09.276]  My granddad passed away last year in August.
[02:26:09.276 --> 02:26:11.057]  Sorry to hear that.
[02:26:11.057 --> 02:26:11.938]  Well, thank you.
[02:26:11.938 --> 02:26:20.583]  And basically, everything, before he died, he basically said, look, this is going to get worse, okay?
[02:26:20.583 --> 02:26:22.084]  Things are not going to get better.
[02:26:22.952 --> 02:26:43.442]  Because, you know, given the fact that it's either us or we're not getting it, and I feel, I know this because I feel as evangelical Christians as myself, I was reading the Bible the other day and it talked about a great falling away.
[02:26:45.037 --> 02:26:54.364]  I looked at that at first, and when everybody looks at it at first, you'll think, oh, everybody is turning their back on God, and everybody is turning to the world.
[02:26:54.364 --> 02:26:56.786]  But there's more to it than that, I feel.
[02:26:56.786 --> 02:27:02.251]  Evangelical Christians are nowhere to be seen, right?
[02:27:02.251 --> 02:27:08.736]  Absolutely, because they've been taken over at the highest levels by government, and they're now part of the clergy response team.
[02:27:08.736 --> 02:27:12.359]  Even a year ago, when it even came out in Fox News, after we reported it,
[02:27:14.159 --> 02:27:34.667]  The army people leaked it, that they were told, you will be court-martialed, and the General's letter was put out, you will be disciplined up to the point of court-martial, if you are an evangelical Christian, and if you attend the churches and give them money, and if you also are part of the Tea Party.
[02:27:34.667 --> 02:27:38.428]  And it's totally illegal, but it just shows they were testing.
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:41.364]  And nobody got in trouble for that.
[02:27:41.364 --> 02:27:43.107]  I mean, that's beyond the Soviet Union there.
[02:27:43.107 --> 02:27:44.810]  That's like Communist China.
[02:27:44.810 --> 02:27:46.173]  And it's worse.
[02:27:46.173 --> 02:27:49.399]  And so, yes, no one stands up for 55 million babies.
[02:27:49.399 --> 02:27:51.182]  I mean, people stand up, but they get demonized.
[02:27:52.068 --> 02:27:53.789]  And so, of course nobody's going to have rights.
[02:27:53.789 --> 02:27:56.209]  Of course nobody's safe in a world like that.
[02:27:56.209 --> 02:27:58.410]  I spent much of the first hour breaking that down.
[02:27:58.410 --> 02:28:04.552]  Feminists advertise that they had abortions and they say, I killed my son and I feel strong now.
[02:28:04.552 --> 02:28:05.833]  I killed the male.
[02:28:05.833 --> 02:28:07.133]  These are sick freaks.
[02:28:07.133 --> 02:28:08.794]  These people are taking over.
[02:28:08.794 --> 02:28:10.434]  They mean business.
[02:28:10.434 --> 02:28:11.835]  And they love death.
[02:28:11.835 --> 02:28:13.715]  And the Christians won't fight them.
[02:28:13.715 --> 02:28:14.936]  The Christians won't stand up against them.
[02:28:16.021 --> 02:28:17.802]  Because it's all about political correctness.
[02:28:17.802 --> 02:28:23.304]  If you're a chicken-neck commie, or a chicken-neck feminist, and you boss people around, they get on their knees and beg.
[02:28:23.304 --> 02:28:27.745]  They go, you're the authority, CNN said, even though CNN has no viewers.
[02:28:27.745 --> 02:28:31.386]  There's still this hoax that you do what the scum tells you.
[02:28:31.386 --> 02:28:33.267]  You follow the scum's orders.
[02:28:33.267 --> 02:28:34.868]  Because they're scum government.
[02:28:34.868 --> 02:28:38.429]  And you don't want to be called racist, so you support Obamacare, or you turn your guns in.
[02:28:38.849 --> 02:28:40.190]  And I say nobody stands up against it.
[02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:41.451]  The truth is people are mad.
[02:28:41.451 --> 02:28:43.012]  They see through it.
[02:28:43.012 --> 02:28:47.955]  But still, they don't get back in the face of it and say you're a totalitarian, sicko, control freak.
[02:28:47.955 --> 02:28:49.096]  I'm not going to put up with you.
[02:28:49.096 --> 02:28:50.497]  Appreciate your call, brother.
[02:28:50.497 --> 02:28:52.018]  John in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:28:52.018 --> 02:28:57.581]  Yeah, Alex, you want to talk about court-martials?
[02:28:59.057 --> 02:29:02.700]  You've had a cell phone, so you know what a SIM card is.
[02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:04.222]  Yes.
[02:29:04.222 --> 02:29:25.980]  I want you to think about that on a very, very small scale, and I'd be more than happy to talk more about this off the radio, but if you ever wonder about the Gizmo detainees that were released, and why there was so much confidence as to how they would not be able to rejoin the ranks,
[02:29:27.181 --> 02:29:30.943]  They had microchips grafted into their spinal cords.
[02:29:30.943 --> 02:29:32.443]  That's exactly right.
[02:29:32.443 --> 02:29:35.664]  You just released some really secret stuff right there.
[02:29:35.664 --> 02:29:38.205]  I've been told that by some high-level people.
[02:29:38.205 --> 02:29:43.307]  They fused it directly into the vertebra so you basically can't find it or remove it.
[02:29:43.307 --> 02:29:45.007]  I tell you what, I'm going to come back to you briefly.
[02:29:45.007 --> 02:29:48.169]  Stay with us.
[02:29:48.169 --> 02:29:49.569]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.569 --> 02:29:52.090]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.090 --> 02:29:54.771]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.803 --> 02:30:02.188]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[02:30:02.188 --> 02:30:05.693]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[02:30:05.693 --> 02:30:11.782]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[02:30:11.782 --> 02:30:13.184]  I'm all about human potential.
[02:30:13.184 --> 02:30:15.287]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[02:30:15.387 --> 02:30:16.947]  The establishment is the opposite.
[02:30:16.947 --> 02:30:21.729]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[02:30:21.729 --> 02:30:26.330]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[02:30:26.330 --> 02:30:28.971]  How we can come together and win the human race.

[02:31:33.955 --> 02:31:37.897]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:31:37.897 --> 02:31:44.121]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:31:44.501 --> 02:31:49.644]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[02:31:49.644 --> 02:31:53.366]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.

[02:31:58.737 --> 02:32:02.398]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:02.398 --> 02:32:06.679]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:06.679 --> 02:32:08.459]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:08.459 --> 02:32:16.301]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:32:16.301 --> 02:32:17.442]  But for how long?

[02:32:28.251 --> 02:32:31.734]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:31.734 --> 02:32:39.980]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:39.980 --> 02:32:45.405]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:32:45.405 --> 02:32:47.927]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:33:18.652 --> 02:33:34.867]  Coming up, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to re-roll that powerful footage intro you just saw as you zoom in by satellite to the area of Ukraine, Sunday, that saw what appeared to be an atomic explosion, but that we're now hearing, oh, it was a dropped cigarette.
[02:33:34.867 --> 02:33:38.571]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not what chemical plants look like when they blow up.
[02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:41.721]  Okay, we're not saying it's a nuke either.
[02:33:41.721 --> 02:33:46.022]  Could have been some type of fuel-air bomb, a cache of explosives rolled in.
[02:33:46.022 --> 02:33:49.844]  I mean, we don't know, but it damaged houses 15 miles away.
[02:33:49.844 --> 02:34:05.449]  We're going to recap all this, get into the details, here in just a moment with Joe Biggs, who, at the moment it was being reported by European television, did a report from fullwars.com and became the most viral video out there of it unfolding.
[02:34:06.351 --> 02:34:17.197]  But we're trying to ferret out all the details of this, but it appears to be it was in Russian-held areas, so they wouldn't blow up their own facility, so it wouldn't be the Russians sending a message setting off a nuke.
[02:34:17.197 --> 02:34:24.562]  But I'm telling you, that is a atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb signature.
[02:34:24.562 --> 02:34:26.243]  That's exactly what they look like.
[02:34:26.243 --> 02:34:27.824]  That's not what fuel
[02:34:28.704 --> 02:34:31.207]  It looks like when it expands and blows up.
[02:34:31.207 --> 02:34:33.209]  I mean, there's only one thing that moves like that.
[02:34:33.209 --> 02:34:34.710]  It's atomics.
[02:34:34.710 --> 02:34:37.733]  This is very, very suspicious.
[02:34:37.733 --> 02:34:39.015]  We don't know what happened.
[02:34:39.015 --> 02:34:39.896]  We're investigating.
[02:34:41.704 --> 02:34:43.726]  Just like missing nuclear weapons at Dyess.
[02:34:43.726 --> 02:34:45.587]  I mean, that was confirmed.
[02:34:45.587 --> 02:34:52.013]  You notice all the freaking out in the media the days after saying missing nukes, East Coast could be blown up, but not connecting it to Dyess.
[02:34:52.013 --> 02:34:55.395]  So I don't know the inside baseball of what's happening.
[02:34:55.395 --> 02:34:57.237]  I just know this doesn't look good.
[02:34:57.237 --> 02:35:02.541]  So we're going to be breaking that down with Joe Bage, who's been reporting on it since Sunday, here.
[02:35:03.522 --> 02:35:07.324]  Before we go any further though, finishing up with John in Tennessee.
[02:35:07.324 --> 02:35:18.071]  John, you're saying that you have first-hand knowledge that detainees are being given high-tech microchips so they can be tracked when they're let out of Gitmo?
[02:35:18.071 --> 02:35:18.772]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:35:20.171 --> 02:35:27.436]  Yeah, Mr. Jones, it's actually a program that started off being used on our troops ourselves.
[02:35:27.436 --> 02:35:29.217]  Oh, I know!
[02:35:29.217 --> 02:35:43.287]  Being young and dumb and signing paperwork and thinking that you're going to do something that's special, such as myself, I served on a chemical ordnance, biological, radiological response team, and you sign up for these things thinking that it's going to help you.
[02:35:43.287 --> 02:35:45.249]  The chips that you're talking about
[02:35:46.149 --> 02:35:54.131]  Completely small, small, small, doing nano to the point at which they don't even have to be embedded into the spine anymore.
[02:35:54.131 --> 02:35:58.572]  And one way that, you know, there's conspiracy after conspiracy.
[02:35:58.572 --> 02:35:59.693]  You can make all kinds of stuff.
[02:35:59.693 --> 02:36:04.034]  Sure, they're putting them in the vaccines and in fact outside groups have gone and blown it up.
[02:36:05.529 --> 02:36:14.752]  But one thing that they are doing that people don't realize, because there are so many conspiracies, is not everyone, not everybody needs to have one.
[02:36:14.752 --> 02:36:25.675]  So what they've done is they've created this grid, and if you and your family, say you were to go into a bunker, and there's five of you, only one of you has to have had one of those embedded.
[02:36:25.675 --> 02:36:32.477]  And they're able to associate that group that's together and use that as a trackable commodity, if you will.
[02:36:32.477 --> 02:36:34.978]  Well, I know I have a family member who's been in the Army
[02:36:36.179 --> 02:36:41.443]  32 years now, and he got all the special authorizations to stay in even longer, because they have a shortage of troops.
[02:36:41.443 --> 02:36:44.725]  He'll let them basically stay in until they're 60 years old.
[02:36:44.725 --> 02:36:49.689]  And he said that about seven, eight years ago, they were getting the chips.
[02:36:49.689 --> 02:36:51.611]  And then he got real mad when I talked about it.
[02:36:51.611 --> 02:36:54.874]  I didn't say his name, but they figured it out.
[02:36:54.874 --> 02:36:57.055]  And so, yeah, they were getting chips then.
[02:36:57.055 --> 02:36:59.157]  And people make jokes about it when they hear this on air.
[02:36:59.157 --> 02:37:01.739]  No, no, folks, they're giving special personnel chips.
[02:37:01.739 --> 02:37:03.521]  They're giving officers chips.
[02:37:03.521 --> 02:37:04.261]  They're giving high-level
[02:37:05.922 --> 02:37:08.663]  People that are in secretive operations chips.
[02:37:08.663 --> 02:37:09.604]  Joe Biggs is here.
[02:37:09.604 --> 02:37:12.565]  Joe, did you ever hear anything about troops getting chips?
[02:37:12.565 --> 02:37:21.108]  You always hear rumors about it, but you know, when they line you up like cattle into a room and start injecting you with stuff, you have no idea what they're putting in there.
[02:37:21.108 --> 02:37:25.250]  And some of those needles are so big, it's possible that they could do something like that.
[02:37:25.250 --> 02:37:29.972]  And that's a lot of things that you would hear rumors about within the ranks of the military.
[02:37:29.972 --> 02:37:34.634]  But at this point in time, I mean, you know, we've heard that it's happened, but I mean, hopefully I don't have one of me.
[02:37:35.799 --> 02:37:37.300]  Well, it's not rumors with my family.
[02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:38.701]  I mean, it happened.
[02:37:38.701 --> 02:37:39.982]  I mean, this is going on.
[02:37:39.982 --> 02:37:42.003]  This has been going on for a while.
[02:37:42.003 --> 02:37:51.549]  Sir, specifically though, you were in a group, because I know they have ordinance disposal domestically that they've used as the umbrella takeover, because it sounds legitimate.
[02:37:51.549 --> 02:37:55.312]  But I mean, you specifically, they told you, we're giving you a nano-tracker chip?
[02:37:57.412 --> 02:38:22.633]  What they told us was, because of our response team, was you would step up to a line, it was painted on the ground, and your shoulders were rolled up, they would tell you to stay still, and there was this big thing that would come down and it would chu-chunk right into your shoulder, and inside those shots you were told, OK, this is going to help with Theron, this is going to help with VX, this is going to help with all these different things.
[02:38:23.132 --> 02:38:33.496]  And one of the things that you signed up for was, you know, in the event that anything were to ever happen, this will allow us the ability to extract you, to get you what you need, whenever you need.
[02:38:33.496 --> 02:38:43.699]  Basically cutting down on, you know, this will have all of your allergies, all of your family contacts, so in the event of emergency, you know, we're not looking and scounging for everything.
[02:38:43.699 --> 02:38:46.660]  Sure, so, but I mean, did they point blank say, we're putting a chip in you?
[02:38:48.582 --> 02:38:53.044]  Yes, they didn't call it a chip at that time.
[02:38:53.044 --> 02:38:54.845]  That's exactly what they tell them.
[02:38:54.845 --> 02:39:00.007]  They go, this technology will allow us to extract you and have your whole medical history on it.
[02:39:00.007 --> 02:39:03.268]  You no longer have dog tags, you have this.
[02:39:03.268 --> 02:39:05.349]  It was an interior barcode, if you will.
[02:39:05.769 --> 02:39:12.771]  But, you know, looking back on it with my age now and seeing how things have come out, it's a whole different thing.
[02:39:12.771 --> 02:39:16.853]  There was way more to it then than what it was now.
[02:39:16.853 --> 02:39:20.634]  Now, were you told specifically they were putting it into the spinal cord of the Gitmo people?
[02:39:20.634 --> 02:39:23.635]  Because that's what I was told.
[02:39:23.635 --> 02:39:28.216]  No, we were not told that it was administered to the spinal cord.
[02:39:28.216 --> 02:39:30.357]  It is placed typically within
[02:39:31.441 --> 02:39:38.487]  A part of the body in which it would take, you have to have surgical interventions done on a massive level.
[02:39:38.487 --> 02:39:41.229]  This isn't something you could just have cut out of your arm.
[02:39:41.229 --> 02:39:46.273]  No, they stick it in next to the nerve in the spinal cord.
[02:39:46.273 --> 02:39:47.994]  Unbelievable.
[02:39:47.994 --> 02:39:52.538]  You risk some serious stuff trying to go after something that you don't know exactly where it is.
[02:39:53.078 --> 02:40:00.560]  Well, I hope listeners know that I've never even gone public with information about Gitmo, even though I was told this by a high-level source, just because it's too unbelievable.
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:04.721]  But the caller's calling in, you know, breaking down what happened to him.
[02:40:04.721 --> 02:40:08.321]  And I have my cousin who was told they were getting chips, I guess, six, seven years ago.
[02:40:08.321 --> 02:40:09.842]  Just about eight years ago.
[02:40:09.842 --> 02:40:13.823]  Now time flies, and then he wouldn't discuss it after that, said it was classified.
[02:40:13.823 --> 02:40:15.563]  Very, very interesting.
[02:40:15.563 --> 02:40:16.023]  All right.
[02:40:16.023 --> 02:40:17.423]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:40:17.423 --> 02:40:19.404]  Anything else you can add for the viewers or listeners?
[02:40:20.643 --> 02:40:30.210]  The only thing I would say is when it comes to anything that's told to you, please just think very, very quickly, but very, very slowly.
[02:40:30.210 --> 02:40:32.551]  Is this something that I really need?
[02:40:32.551 --> 02:40:40.697]  Is it, you know, that we've survived so long without all of these, these vaccinations and these things are supposed to make us better.
[02:40:40.697 --> 02:40:42.018]  I can tell you firsthand.
[02:40:42.882 --> 02:40:49.885]  There are reasons that you don't know of why things are coming up and being put into your body.
[02:40:49.885 --> 02:40:51.746]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:40:51.746 --> 02:40:54.247]  I've talked about the military being the most awake group.
[02:40:54.247 --> 02:40:56.668]  I mean, not the new recruits, but seasoned people.
[02:40:56.668 --> 02:40:58.749]  Just because they're in the middle of it, they're decompartmentalized.
[02:40:58.749 --> 02:41:02.010]  The police then are another group that statistically is very awake.
[02:41:02.010 --> 02:41:09.613]  Doesn't mean they're not doing terrible things on average sometimes, but the fact is they are easier to wake up because they're not in total la-la land like the general public.
[02:41:09.613 --> 02:41:10.914]  So I just state it like I see it.
[02:41:12.384 --> 02:41:15.666]  What can you say about your colleagues, former colleagues in the military?
[02:41:15.666 --> 02:41:24.211]  Are they waking up or do you concur with what I've personally seen or have you seen something different?
[02:41:24.211 --> 02:41:25.132]  I'll say this.
[02:41:25.132 --> 02:41:28.874]  I think, you know, there's a lot of guys out there that would agree.
[02:41:28.874 --> 02:41:31.615]  There's a lot of guys that are scared to death.
[02:41:31.615 --> 02:41:32.956]  There's families.
[02:41:32.956 --> 02:41:34.197]  There's the three percenters.
[02:41:34.798 --> 02:41:56.084]  There's the Oath Keepers, and then there's just groups of guys that have, you know, their own mythology, if you will, or different hand signals or whatever that, you know, you kind of, you're taught to learn those things for when you are in places where you shouldn't be, and you know how to kind of create secondary forms of that.
[02:41:56.084 --> 02:42:01.646]  So you're saying there's like basically secret languages in the military that people aren't going along with us and know what's happening?
[02:42:03.430 --> 02:42:16.494]  In my specific unit, where we responded, we were basically sent and taught and trained for chemical, biological, radiological, and ordnance response teams, is what we were.
[02:42:16.494 --> 02:42:20.395]  Sometimes in the Army, it's referred to as a CBRN team.
[02:42:20.395 --> 02:42:25.597]  In the Marine Corps, we were not classified or given a specific name.
[02:42:25.597 --> 02:42:29.478]  We had a secondary form of language that was not
[02:42:30.158 --> 02:42:51.520]  Anything extravagant or difficult to learn, but in the event that we needed to communicate because we could not use our voice or we were somewhere where things needed to be communicated to keep people from freaking out or to keep someone from knowing what we know, yes, there was a secondary, very simplex form of communication that was taught amongst our group.
[02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:53.281]  Sure.
[02:42:53.281 --> 02:42:55.282]  Alright, well listen, thank you so much for the call.
[02:42:55.282 --> 02:42:57.823]  We're going to have to call this little snippet of video.
[02:42:57.823 --> 02:43:00.485]  Marine tells story of being microchipped.
[02:43:00.485 --> 02:43:01.786]  And I mean, I know that's true.
[02:43:01.786 --> 02:43:07.109]  In fact, I should ask him how long ago it happened, because it started about, I guess about eight years ago in the Army.
[02:43:07.109 --> 02:43:09.490]  And my cousin got called in with about 400
[02:43:11.531 --> 02:43:33.388]  At a military base in Texas, and they told him, this is classified, but there is a program, some of you will be selected to get an implantable chip, so we can extract you wherever you're at, we'll have your whole history on it, and they said you will, but they said chip flat out, you will be getting a microchip, and it will be put somewhere where the enemy can't find it, and he wouldn't tell me where it was, I know on the Gitmo it's in the spine.
[02:43:34.963 --> 02:43:35.984]  Is that not incredible, Joe?
[02:43:35.984 --> 02:43:37.745]  That's crazy, yeah.
[02:43:37.745 --> 02:43:41.227]  I mean, I wouldn't doubt it, especially when you're high up, you're special ops kind of guys.
[02:43:41.227 --> 02:43:43.389]  They're gonna be out there deep in the field, undercover.
[02:43:43.389 --> 02:43:45.230]  It would make sense that that'd be something they would try.
[02:43:45.230 --> 02:43:48.512]  Sure, all of this stuff makes sense, except it's the globalists are in control of it.
[02:43:48.512 --> 02:43:50.614]  Yeah, that's... I mean, can you imagine?
[02:43:50.614 --> 02:43:51.374]  Yeah.
[02:43:51.374 --> 02:43:55.217]  Like, Samsung came out yesterday and said, yes, we are recording you and listening to you.
[02:43:55.217 --> 02:43:59.000]  And we've been saying it forever, and people mock us and say, you know, we're crazy.
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.581]  And now it's out in mainstream media.
[02:44:02.023 --> 02:44:03.064]  Alright, I want to shift gears.
[02:44:03.064 --> 02:44:10.469]  Let's come back in with that intro that you guys had, coming in by satellite, down on Ukraine currently.
[02:44:10.469 --> 02:44:19.076]  We got this shot just about 30 minutes ago from Google, and this is a shot bringing us into Ukraine.
[02:44:19.076 --> 02:44:24.760]  And then we will break down what's happening there, probably even do some overdrive here with Joe Biggs.
[02:44:26.883 --> 02:44:29.447]  Truly over the top.
[02:44:29.447 --> 02:44:32.611]  Okay, this is Donetsk, Ukraine.
[02:44:32.611 --> 02:44:37.558]  Joe Biggs, give me your first approximation and take on this, and then I'll go over it.
[02:44:37.558 --> 02:44:40.142]  Russia deploying tactical nuke arms to Crimea.
[02:44:40.142 --> 02:44:41.784]  That's from October last year.
[02:44:41.784 --> 02:44:43.686]  Bill Gertz, High Level Sources.
[02:44:44.187 --> 02:44:45.988]  And that, I mean, that guy's got amazing sources.
[02:44:45.988 --> 02:44:47.349]  That's Washington Times.
[02:44:47.349 --> 02:44:51.732]  NATO's tactical nuclear weapons, again, are being moved into that area.
[02:44:51.732 --> 02:44:54.234]  Does Russia think their new nuclear weapons could win a war?
[02:44:54.234 --> 02:44:55.435]  That's Forbes.
[02:44:55.435 --> 02:44:59.098]  Newsweek, Russia has threatened nuclear attack, says Ukraine Defense Minister.
[02:44:59.098 --> 02:45:05.342]  Well, yeah, they've said, if you move armor in up against our border, we reserve the right to use tactical nukes.
[02:45:05.342 --> 02:45:07.123]  No longer unthinkable should U.S.
[02:45:07.123 --> 02:45:09.445]  ready for limited nuclear war.
[02:45:09.445 --> 02:45:12.507]  That's out of defense.
[02:45:12.507 --> 02:45:13.067]  We have
[02:45:14.025 --> 02:45:19.651]  The military and NATO making incredible statements about ready for war with Russia.
[02:45:19.651 --> 02:45:20.291]  Top U.S.
[02:45:20.291 --> 02:45:23.174]  generals have been making just very hawkish statements.
[02:45:23.174 --> 02:45:26.898]  We've got analysts saying this is the most dangerous it's ever been.
[02:45:26.898 --> 02:45:29.280]  I've seen chemical plants blow up growing up in Texas.
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:30.261]  I've seen them on the news.
[02:45:30.261 --> 02:45:34.385]  I've seen them in the distance when I was visiting family in Houston, 20, 30 miles away.
[02:45:35.894 --> 02:45:43.399]  I saw it doesn't go boom with a perfect white hot flash wave and then stop.
[02:45:43.399 --> 02:45:45.781]  It just doesn't look like any explosion I've ever seen.
[02:45:45.781 --> 02:45:47.101]  Joe, you've seen a lot of explosions.
[02:45:47.101 --> 02:45:51.064]  We're going to play this footage for TV viewers and radio listeners right now.
[02:45:51.064 --> 02:45:53.886]  This happened Sunday in Ukraine and we'll get your take on it.
[02:45:53.886 --> 02:45:55.587]  Here it is.
[02:45:55.587 --> 02:45:58.409]  This is the footage of the explosion.
[02:46:00.123 --> 02:46:02.785]  And again, we're going to give folks the audio of that.
[02:46:02.785 --> 02:46:07.630]  We're going to cue up the raw footage from Sunday.
[02:46:07.630 --> 02:46:17.439]  And as soon as this came out, Joe got it off Ukrainian television, as soon as this came out, and we were able to play it.
[02:46:17.439 --> 02:46:19.961]  And again, this was played yesterday.
[02:46:19.961 --> 02:46:21.202]  Here it is, with audio.
[02:46:31.997 --> 02:46:38.764]  We've all seen hundreds of clips of what atomic bombs look like.
[02:46:38.764 --> 02:46:40.846]  Here's the flash.
[02:46:40.846 --> 02:46:42.627]  Shockwave.
[02:46:42.627 --> 02:46:43.508]  That's miles away.
[02:46:43.508 --> 02:46:45.190]  Houses miles away were on fire.
[02:46:45.190 --> 02:46:46.251]  Fifteen.
[02:46:46.251 --> 02:46:47.112]  Fifteen miles away.
[02:46:48.897 --> 02:46:52.158]  And we'll just keep playing that in the background as a loop a few more times.
[02:46:52.158 --> 02:46:53.718]  Joe, what's your take on all this?
[02:46:53.718 --> 02:46:58.879]  So, Sunday night, I get a message, a link sent to me on Facebook, says, you gotta check this out.
[02:46:58.879 --> 02:47:01.300]  I looked at the video, opened it up, and I see this explosion.
[02:47:01.300 --> 02:47:02.160]  I'm like, wow, what is this?
[02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:03.441]  I started digging into it.
[02:47:03.441 --> 02:47:11.082]  When I found the actual raw link on YouTube, it had just been put up maybe five to ten minutes prior, only had five views on it.
[02:47:11.082 --> 02:47:12.723]  I was like, alright, I've gotta get to work.
[02:47:12.723 --> 02:47:13.763]  We've gotta do something with this.
[02:47:13.763 --> 02:47:15.283]  This is unbelievable.
[02:47:15.283 --> 02:47:17.124]  You called me and said, you know, can I do this?
[02:47:17.124 --> 02:47:17.204]  Yeah.
[02:47:18.331 --> 02:47:24.593]  And when I got back to the office, I figured I'd check some of the mainstream sites to see if anybody was talking about this because that's huge.
[02:47:24.593 --> 02:47:26.093]  That's a giant explosion.
[02:47:26.093 --> 02:47:26.874]  It's a telltale.
[02:47:26.874 --> 02:47:28.654]  Still, they're not reporting on it.
[02:47:28.654 --> 02:47:35.496]  Well, you know, Sunday, I guess, you know, people don't want to interrupt the Grammys with, you know, small talk like this with explosions going on in Ukraine.
[02:47:35.496 --> 02:47:41.618]  I mean, that's all I could find on anything on Twitter, on Facebook, on Fox, CNN, BBC, whatever it was.
[02:47:41.618 --> 02:47:43.398]  Everybody want to talk about the Grammys.
[02:47:43.398 --> 02:47:44.659]  Nobody was talking about this.
[02:47:44.659 --> 02:47:45.439]  Now they are today.
[02:47:46.559 --> 02:47:51.061]  Did you ever see anything in Iraq and Afghanistan, explosions that looked anything like that?
[02:47:51.061 --> 02:47:55.464]  I've seen something that looked that big, but didn't have a shockwave like that.
[02:47:55.464 --> 02:47:58.665]  I mean, that footage made my heart thump just watching.
[02:47:58.665 --> 02:48:01.046]  I was like, oh my god, I hope that a nuke didn't go off.
[02:48:01.046 --> 02:48:01.907]  I hope there's not a lot of people.
[02:48:01.907 --> 02:48:04.428]  Because it knocks the people over that are miles away when it comes through.
[02:48:04.648 --> 02:48:12.570]  I mean, the pictures later in that area, you could see buildings were just like, the windows were busted out, there was like parts of the building that were cracked, and things like that.
[02:48:12.570 --> 02:48:14.150]  So I mean, that was a huge explosion.
[02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:16.111]  And we looked, where's the footage of this place?
[02:48:16.111 --> 02:48:16.771]  Yeah.
[02:48:16.771 --> 02:48:17.971]  I mean, where's the crater?
[02:48:17.971 --> 02:48:21.912]  It's not on the news of what happened to this supposed plant.
[02:48:21.912 --> 02:48:23.573]  And they're saying a cigarette did it.
[02:48:23.573 --> 02:48:24.393]  Yeah.
[02:48:24.393 --> 02:48:27.674]  So I asked the question, did a nuke go off in Ukraine?
[02:48:27.674 --> 02:48:30.635]  And a lot of trolls came out, and a lot of people were like, oh, you know, it's not a nuke.
[02:48:31.795 --> 02:48:31.855]  The
[02:48:46.411 --> 02:48:48.713]  Not being able to fight back.
[02:48:48.713 --> 02:48:50.795]  It demolishes the buildings and all that.
[02:48:50.795 --> 02:48:57.861]  So this would be, what I thought, a smaller, and that's what you even said too, it could be a tactical nuclear weapon.
[02:48:57.861 --> 02:48:58.542]  So I don't see the problem.
[02:48:58.542 --> 02:49:00.724]  Well, they've got them now that are just fired from mortars.
[02:49:00.724 --> 02:49:08.311]  The stuff they had back in the 50s and 60s, like the Davy Crockett, was a two-man team, and it was meant in Eastern Europe, but the Russians poured across an overwhelming force.
[02:49:08.311 --> 02:49:09.352]  You just hit them with this.
[02:49:09.352 --> 02:49:12.375]  The issue is the Russians have been threatening to use these in state-run media.
[02:49:13.015 --> 02:49:15.896]  But Russia was in control of this area, I'm told.
[02:49:15.896 --> 02:49:18.276]  But then, what's the Ukrainian government saying?
[02:49:18.276 --> 02:49:26.299]  Well, right now they're saying Kiev has received threats of nuclear retaliation from Russia through unofficial channels if it continues to fight pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.
[02:49:26.299 --> 02:49:39.842]  The Ukrainian Minister of Defense, Valeriy Helete, and it says the Russian side has threatened on several occasions across the unofficial channels that in the case of continued resistance, they are ready to use a tactical nuclear weapon against us.
[02:49:39.842 --> 02:49:41.963]  So, we need to just discuss that fact.
[02:49:42.643 --> 02:49:45.266]  I mean, that's a big escalation right there.
[02:49:45.266 --> 02:49:46.148]  Yeah.
[02:49:46.148 --> 02:49:48.110]  What do you think's going on?
[02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:53.236]  It seems like someone in Ukraine probably did this.
[02:49:53.236 --> 02:49:57.882]  And they want to blame it on Russia to spark something up.
[02:49:57.882 --> 02:49:58.844]  It seems a little odd to me.
[02:49:59.932 --> 02:50:00.813]  And you've been researching.
[02:50:00.813 --> 02:50:03.935]  It's clear that this was a Russian-held plant?
[02:50:03.935 --> 02:50:07.517]  Well, in Dauntess, there's a good bit of those people there as well.
[02:50:07.517 --> 02:50:09.978]  But at this point in time, I'm not quite sure.
[02:50:09.978 --> 02:50:10.899]  I'm still trying to find out.
[02:50:10.899 --> 02:50:12.020]  A lot of the stuff's closed down.
[02:50:12.020 --> 02:50:12.980]  A lot of people aren't.
[02:50:12.980 --> 02:50:13.260]  Well, I know.
[02:50:13.260 --> 02:50:14.401]  There's no media on it.
[02:50:14.401 --> 02:50:15.002]  Yeah.
[02:50:15.002 --> 02:50:16.803]  I mean, you'd think something like this would be a bigger deal.
[02:50:16.803 --> 02:50:23.187]  I'm trying to dig as much as I can, and it's hard to get a lot of, you know, particular... Well, what is Russia Today saying?
[02:50:23.187 --> 02:50:24.548]  What are the Russians saying?
[02:50:24.548 --> 02:50:27.830]  Well, the Russians are saying right now that they think
[02:50:28.686 --> 02:50:32.247]  That there was an artillery strike that came in, and that's what hit it.
[02:50:32.247 --> 02:50:46.332]  Well, then you have the DNR, which is the Dauntless People's Republic, who came out today and just said that they found what was remnants of a Toka U, which is an actual piece that is a warhead.
[02:50:46.332 --> 02:50:49.854]  It shoots a warhead that could be chemical, nuclear, or EMP.
[02:50:51.014 --> 02:50:52.435]  And that's what they found today.
[02:50:52.435 --> 02:50:57.396]  And that's a medium-range or short-range mobile missile launch.
[02:50:57.396 --> 02:50:57.917]  Yeah.
[02:50:57.917 --> 02:50:58.557]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:58.557 --> 02:50:59.177]  Let's stay right there.
[02:50:59.177 --> 02:51:03.599]  When an emergency happens, you could be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[02:51:03.599 --> 02:51:06.900]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere.
[02:51:06.900 --> 02:51:12.322]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[02:51:12.322 --> 02:51:15.443]  Fortunately, there is a simple, effective way to protect yourself.

[02:51:58.524 --> 02:52:01.366]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:52:01.366 --> 02:52:06.489]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:52:06.489 --> 02:52:14.613]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:52:14.613 --> 02:52:19.136]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:52:19.136 --> 02:52:22.938]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:52:23.098 --> 02:52:29.042]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:52:29.042 --> 02:52:32.204]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:52:32.204 --> 02:52:37.588]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[02:52:53.518 --> 02:52:58.863]  Hear that?
[02:52:58.863 --> 02:53:05.168]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:53:05.168 --> 02:53:07.930]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:53:07.930 --> 02:53:11.513]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[02:54:02.541 --> 02:54:14.690]  Donetsk is a major city in eastern Ukraine in the Crimea region and they've been having major battles there between the Russian separatists and the Ukrainian military.
[02:54:16.148 --> 02:54:23.173]  And it's clear that supposedly rebels want to drive the Ukrainian forces out of this area.
[02:54:23.173 --> 02:54:25.835]  The Russians have been threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons.
[02:54:25.835 --> 02:54:27.456]  This would be a clear message.
[02:54:27.456 --> 02:54:31.859]  I'm not saying that's what it is, but there's been so much talk on both sides about this.
[02:54:31.859 --> 02:54:38.063]  And then you've got McCain running around saying it's time to have war in the news directly with Russia.
[02:54:38.063 --> 02:54:39.884]  And Russia says if they start fighting U.S.
[02:54:39.884 --> 02:54:43.607]  or NATO forces directly, that they're not going to fight the armor, they're just going to nuke it.
[02:54:44.321 --> 02:54:46.762]  And then, that's how I've said over and over again, a nuclear war could start.
[02:54:46.762 --> 02:54:47.782]  That's what the analysts say.
[02:54:47.782 --> 02:54:52.984]  They're in the news today, analysts, diplomats, saying the most dangerous thing I've ever seen.
[02:54:52.984 --> 02:54:58.686]  They use attack, or the West uses attack, a weapon, getting overrun.
[02:54:58.686 --> 02:55:11.710]  Remember, during the Pristina situation, during the Kosovo War, the Russians landed at the Pristina airport and took it over, and then they ordered the head of NATO to attack the Russians, and the head general, who's British, said, I will not start World War III, and did.
[02:55:12.947 --> 02:55:15.650]  And he said, the Russians have always had an interest in this country.
[02:55:15.650 --> 02:55:16.851]  I'm not doing it.
[02:55:16.851 --> 02:55:19.594]  Well, now they may have generals that are willing to do it.
[02:55:19.594 --> 02:55:23.779]  And the thing is, the Russians have said, we will launch these weapons at you.
[02:55:23.779 --> 02:55:29.646]  So whether this is an A-bomb going off or not, I keep saying A-bomb, because a lot of these tacticals are very primitive.
[02:55:30.126 --> 02:55:34.750]  It fires like a plutonium bullet into a ball of uranium.
[02:55:34.750 --> 02:55:36.292]  Those are some of those more simpler weapons.
[02:55:36.292 --> 02:55:39.815]  And that looks like the atomic bomb blast I've seen over and over again.
[02:55:39.815 --> 02:55:48.423]  When you see that first shock of the atoms and that first wave of golden light, that's not what conventional explosives or chemicals do.
[02:55:48.423 --> 02:55:52.586]  They expand slowly compared to fissionable material.
[02:55:52.586 --> 02:55:53.847]  And I'm not a nuclear physicist.
[02:55:53.847 --> 02:55:55.289]  I've just studied this.
[02:55:55.289 --> 02:55:56.350]  It looks bad, Joe.
[02:55:56.730 --> 02:56:07.159]  Yeah, well the thing is, is if one person starts using a strategic nuke, or a tactical nuke, and then the other one uses a tactical nuke, then that leads into a strategical nuke.
[02:56:07.159 --> 02:56:07.860]  It escalates.
[02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:11.964]  First they use the little ones, and then they go to the bigger, and then they wipe it out, and then it gets out of hand.
[02:56:11.964 --> 02:56:17.449]  And then you've got people, not only does Russia have this capability, but Pakistan has this kind of capability.
[02:56:17.449 --> 02:56:18.670]  Other people around here are having it.
[02:56:18.670 --> 02:56:19.310]  India?
[02:56:19.310 --> 02:56:19.471]  Yeah.
[02:56:20.111 --> 02:56:29.202]  So it says, outside the U.S., both established and emergency nuclear powers increasingly see nuclear weapons as weapons that can be used in a controlled, limited, and strategically useful fashion.
[02:56:29.202 --> 02:56:30.924]  See, and again, it's all over the news.
[02:56:30.924 --> 02:56:31.945]  Russia and the U.S.
[02:56:31.945 --> 02:56:33.988]  keep saying, oh, it's no big deal to use nukes now.
[02:56:33.988 --> 02:56:34.348]  Keep going.
[02:56:35.029 --> 02:56:40.392]  That's right, because they've only got 160 million people and a half million man army compared to China with three or four million, the US with a million.
[02:56:40.392 --> 02:56:42.193]  They're betting everything on tactical nukes.
[02:57:02.466 --> 02:57:11.851]  And like I said, Pakistan has developed the tactical nukes to stop India's much larger military, which also would have the capability as well, and Iran is seeking this out.
[02:57:11.851 --> 02:57:19.675]  So you get tactical nukes being fired, then it escalates, and everyone's just trying to push the buttons to see who's got the bigger cojones to do it.
[02:57:19.675 --> 02:57:27.820]  And the real weapon is a remote control nuke mine, atomic mines, because they'll put those out, they have spotters by radio, or sat phone now.
[02:57:28.340 --> 02:57:35.105]  The tank brigades come into the area and you just detonate right in the middle of them, take them all out.
[02:57:35.105 --> 02:57:39.868]  Yeah, this is just, it's not a good game to play and they're trying to start something.
[02:57:39.868 --> 02:57:53.098]  It says Russia is moving tactical nuclear weapons systems into recently annexed Crimea, while the Obama administration is backing informal talks aimed at cutting US tactical nuclear deployments in Europe, and that's the Washington free beacon.
[02:57:53.638 --> 02:58:05.165]  Three senior House Republican leaders wrote to President Obama two weeks ago warning that Moscow will deploy nuclear missiles and bombers armed with long-range air-launched cruise missiles into occupied Ukraine territory.
[02:58:05.165 --> 02:58:08.447]  And they've now been patrolling even the edge of our skies.
[02:58:08.447 --> 02:58:12.629]  Because of the provocation, because the West is moving its forces up against Russia.
[02:58:12.629 --> 02:58:16.631]  And I'm not lionizing Russia, but we're starting it.
[02:58:16.631 --> 02:58:17.632]  We're starting it.
[02:58:18.726 --> 02:58:22.627]  I mean, it was about two months ago that NATO General, he's a U.S.
[02:58:22.627 --> 02:58:27.809]  General, I forget his name, he gets up in his little Air Force Uniform and he goes, we're ready to take on the Russians.
[02:58:27.809 --> 02:58:29.570]  I mean, nobody ever talked like that before.
[02:58:29.570 --> 02:58:32.891]  I mean, we're ready to have a war, no big deal.
[02:58:32.891 --> 02:58:38.013]  I mean, I'm sorry, it's not a bunch of Iraqis that we're fighting here, folks, with AK-47s.
[02:58:38.013 --> 02:58:39.454]  It's the Russians with nuclear weapons.
[02:58:41.527 --> 02:58:42.588]  This is GCN.
[02:58:42.588 --> 02:58:43.909]  About war with Russia.
[02:58:43.909 --> 02:58:45.950]  Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:45.950 --> 02:58:46.731]  The New House of Cards.
[02:58:46.731 --> 02:58:46.971]  Stay there.
[02:58:46.971 --> 02:58:47.711]  I don't want to talk about that.
[02:58:47.711 --> 02:58:48.732]  We're going into overdraft.
[02:58:48.732 --> 02:58:57.638]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[02:58:57.638 --> 02:59:04.222]  NASA has already set the countdown timer and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[02:59:04.742 --> 02:59:08.225]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[02:59:08.225 --> 02:59:09.866]  population could perish.
[02:59:09.866 --> 02:59:13.348]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[02:59:13.348 --> 02:59:15.590]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[02:59:15.590 --> 02:59:17.231]  Mass riots will follow.
[02:59:17.231 --> 02:59:19.413]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[02:59:19.413 --> 02:59:23.496]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[02:59:23.496 --> 02:59:29.180]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones,
[02:59:29.420 --> 02:59:30.561]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:01.027 --> 03:00:03.809]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:00:03.809 --> 03:00:06.591]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:25.985 --> 03:00:27.546]  Final segment, we're in overdrive.
[03:00:27.546 --> 03:00:29.847]  Sorry to the other callers, we're just out of time.
[03:00:29.847 --> 03:00:30.828]  Joe, I've been ranting here.
[03:00:30.828 --> 03:00:32.629]  I want you to be able to make other points about this.
[03:00:32.629 --> 03:00:34.751]  I mean, we've got all the mainstream news articles.
[03:00:34.751 --> 03:00:40.894]  Jane's Weapons Quarterly, Washington Times, Forbes, Newsweek, Russia Threatens Nuclear Attacks.
[03:00:40.894 --> 03:00:43.456]  I mean, this is all going on here.
[03:00:43.456 --> 03:00:44.577]  The Russians are saying it.
[03:00:44.577 --> 03:00:46.178]  I don't just believe Newsweek.
[03:00:46.178 --> 03:00:50.941]  When Eber the West started a war with Russia in Georgia in 2008, they rolled nukes in.
[03:00:51.761 --> 03:00:55.103]  With these medium range and short range launchers that are going to start nuking you.
[03:00:55.103 --> 03:00:58.645]  And the NATO troops got back on their airplanes and left.
[03:00:58.645 --> 03:01:00.206]  What is NATO playing with here?
[03:01:00.206 --> 03:01:05.130]  And then let's get into these reports of the wreckage they found of the missile that may have carried the weapon.
[03:01:05.130 --> 03:01:10.613]  Well, it seems like they're ramping the American people up to get ready back, to get that war face on.
[03:01:10.613 --> 03:01:13.595]  You see the American sniper movies coming out.
[03:01:13.595 --> 03:01:17.418]  You see the American public getting back into that, yeah, yeah, you know, we're ready to, we're ready to fight.
[03:01:17.418 --> 03:01:18.058]  We're America.
[03:01:18.058 --> 03:01:18.798]  We can do anything.
[03:01:18.798 --> 03:01:20.560]  You know, but for the past few years,
[03:01:21.340 --> 03:01:25.543]  The way everyone looks at it, even Americans are looking at these wars as garbage.
[03:01:25.543 --> 03:01:26.584]  Iraq was a waste of time.
[03:01:26.584 --> 03:01:28.065]  Afghanistan a waste of time.
[03:01:28.065 --> 03:01:28.705]  All of this stuff.
[03:01:28.705 --> 03:01:32.107]  So a lot of people have been on the down.
[03:01:32.107 --> 03:01:33.888]  But now we have all these new movies coming out.
[03:01:33.888 --> 03:01:35.389]  The TV shows are talking about war.
[03:01:35.389 --> 03:01:36.330]  Everyone's talking about it.
[03:01:36.330 --> 03:01:37.291]  It's always about Russia.
[03:01:37.291 --> 03:01:40.033]  And you start seeing everybody like, I am an American.
[03:01:40.033 --> 03:01:40.833]  Oh, yeah.
[03:01:40.833 --> 03:01:42.014]  And everyone's all pumped up.
[03:01:42.014 --> 03:01:45.156]  And all these books are coming out from Navy SEALs and things like that.
[03:01:45.156 --> 03:01:49.979]  It seems like they're trying to use this propaganda to get the American public back in the mind.
[03:01:51.220 --> 03:01:53.721]  Games, movies, House of Cards, it's all Russia.
[03:01:53.721 --> 03:01:54.201]  Yep.
[03:01:54.201 --> 03:01:57.042]  The whole new House of Cards is about Russia.
[03:01:57.042 --> 03:01:57.643]  Video games.
[03:01:57.643 --> 03:02:01.184]  China's our buddy in House of Cards, but Russia, they're bad.
[03:02:01.184 --> 03:02:01.704]  Yeah.
[03:02:01.704 --> 03:02:05.846]  It seems like they're trying to ramp up the American people to get them behind what's going to be coming up.
[03:02:05.846 --> 03:02:09.387]  And now we see all this stuff starting to happen over there as well.
[03:02:09.387 --> 03:02:13.369]  Well, what frustrates me, Joe, is that Russia is actually fighting radical Islam.
[03:02:13.369 --> 03:02:15.410]  And the West is going to use that against them as well.
[03:02:15.410 --> 03:02:17.771]  I mean, the whole world's really getting up on Russia.
[03:02:17.771 --> 03:02:17.911]  Yeah.
[03:02:18.391 --> 03:02:22.472]  And I even run into people I know who know and listen to the show, and they go, yeah, but the Russians are bad.
[03:02:22.472 --> 03:02:23.652]  Let's kick their butt.
[03:02:23.652 --> 03:02:25.292]  It's like this mindlessness.
[03:02:25.292 --> 03:02:26.353]  I'm sorry.
[03:02:26.353 --> 03:02:29.973]  I mean, our own military got chewed up trying to hold down the countries you were in.
[03:02:29.973 --> 03:02:40.136]  Can you imagine, even if Russia is in trouble, trying to mess with a country that has all these special forces and all these spies and all these weapons and special teams to poison people?
[03:02:40.136 --> 03:02:43.276]  I mean, I think Washington is biting off more than they can chew here.
[03:02:43.276 --> 03:02:46.077]  Yeah, and I don't think Putin is someone that's going to be willing to back down from
[03:02:46.977 --> 03:02:50.583]  Using something like that to use... Well, they're going to turn loose their spies, too.
[03:02:50.583 --> 03:02:51.004]  Yeah.
[03:02:51.004 --> 03:02:52.326]  It's going to get really bad, Joe.
[03:02:53.186 --> 03:02:53.886]  Well, hopefully not.
[03:02:53.886 --> 03:03:02.808]  I hope the people don't buy into this junk that's being fed into the mainstream media every day, and how they're coming out saying, you know, if you don't back all this stuff, then you're not American.
[03:03:02.808 --> 03:03:06.169]  You know, we need to take a step back and look at what's really going on.
[03:03:06.169 --> 03:03:10.290]  And nuclear war, it's not just going to affect that area, it's going to affect the entire planet.
[03:03:10.290 --> 03:03:12.290]  People need to get off their high horse and, you know.
[03:03:12.290 --> 03:03:17.111]  Well, that's what we've got to check, is local radiation meters at local colleges.
[03:03:17.111 --> 03:03:21.832]  If they're suddenly not reporting as of yesterday, that means that they've shut it down.
[03:03:22.532 --> 03:03:25.795]  And we've caught them doing this before when there's been leaks at power plants.
[03:03:25.795 --> 03:03:29.459]  We'll get a report and suddenly the meters around it won't be reading.
[03:03:29.459 --> 03:03:31.201]  It'll say inoperable.
[03:03:31.201 --> 03:03:32.642]  We need to check into that, Joe.
[03:03:32.642 --> 03:03:44.433]  And we need to talk to some of our sources in Europe and some of the agencies that are private that monitor radiation and see if isotopes associated with atomic weapons, because that's what these frogs are usually, atomic.
[03:03:46.718 --> 03:03:48.462]  Most tacticals are not hydrogen.
[03:03:48.462 --> 03:03:54.214]  We need to look into this and see if we have the isotopes from Russian or NATO atomics.
[03:03:54.214 --> 03:03:54.535]  Yeah.
[03:03:54.535 --> 03:03:55.156]  What do you think?
[03:03:55.156 --> 03:03:55.457]  I agree.
[03:03:56.813 --> 03:04:00.515]  Well, earlier today, too, DNR News is the Don't Test People's Republic.
[03:04:00.515 --> 03:04:03.877]  They came out saying that they indeed found the shellings.
[03:04:03.877 --> 03:04:11.621]  They found evidence of the rounds that were being used, but they weren't able to get to it until today.
[03:04:11.621 --> 03:04:16.443]  Yesterday, they said that chemical plant area was continuously hit.
[03:04:16.443 --> 03:04:18.064]  And that's a pro-Russian group, isn't it?
[03:04:18.064 --> 03:04:18.624]  Yes.
[03:04:18.624 --> 03:04:21.366]  So they're saying it's the Ukrainians doing it.
[03:04:21.366 --> 03:04:21.566]  Yes.
[03:04:21.986 --> 03:04:28.587]  So they think that they were trying to continuously hit that chemical area to destroy any evidence of what the rounds that were being used.
[03:04:28.587 --> 03:04:34.789]  And like I said, it's what's called the OTR-21 Tochka, which is a Scarab missile.
[03:04:34.789 --> 03:04:41.070]  And the warhead can shoot off a chemical or 100 kiloton nuclear warhead, EMP or fragmentation filling.
[03:04:41.070 --> 03:04:45.631]  But that's what they are finding out there now, as of today, or tonight, I should say.
[03:04:46.451 --> 03:04:49.914]  Well, we're... Just get everybody on this, let's dig into it.
[03:04:49.914 --> 03:04:51.155]  Try to find out exactly what's happening.
[03:04:51.155 --> 03:04:52.917]  It may be a chemical explosion.
[03:04:52.917 --> 03:04:54.238]  It just looks really suspicious.
[03:04:54.238 --> 03:04:58.341]  It's just weird though, you'd think though, they said there was a weapons cache and then they... Hold on, let's go even further into overdrive.
[03:04:58.341 --> 03:04:59.162]  I want you all to finish.
[03:05:00.816 --> 03:05:02.236]  This alert just came in.
[03:05:02.236 --> 03:05:09.798]  This special announcement is for business owners and leaders of organizations who've been waiting for the right time to build.
[03:05:09.798 --> 03:05:15.720]  General Steel has made it impossible to wait any longer with rock-bottom prices that could save you thousands.
[03:05:15.720 --> 03:05:16.260]  That's right.
[03:05:16.260 --> 03:05:22.842]  General Steel, America's leader in pre-engineered structures, is offering buildings at prices you will never see again.
[03:05:22.842 --> 03:05:23.882]  Don't miss these prices.
[03:05:23.882 --> 03:05:24.683]  A 50 by 100 for $35,000.
[03:05:24.683 --> 03:05:25.224]  You heard right.
[03:05:25.224 --> 03:05:26.225]  That's 5,000 square feet for $35,000.
[03:05:26.225 --> 03:05:29.508]  Manufacturers, if you need a larger building, try a 100 by 100 commercial building for $129,000.
[03:05:29.508 --> 03:05:31.090]  You can't afford to rent with these prices.
[03:05:31.090 --> 03:05:32.632]  Imagine a 70 by 100 foot church building for under $69,000.
[03:05:42.423 --> 03:05:47.605]  With the economy improving and interest rates still at historic lows, you can't afford to wait.
[03:05:47.605 --> 03:05:50.605]  So call 866-91-STEEL.
[03:05:50.605 --> 03:05:52.386]  Lock in your price now.
[03:05:52.386 --> 03:05:52.766]  Call 866-91-STEEL.

[03:05:59.128 --> 03:06:01.970]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[03:06:01.970 --> 03:06:07.094]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[03:06:07.094 --> 03:06:15.220]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[03:06:15.220 --> 03:06:19.743]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[03:06:19.743 --> 03:06:23.546]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[03:06:23.706 --> 03:06:29.650]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[03:06:29.650 --> 03:06:32.812]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[03:06:32.812 --> 03:06:38.196]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[03:08:01.555 --> 03:08:08.181]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:08.181 --> 03:08:11.784]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:11.784 --> 03:08:14.626]  And we are back live, going into the fourth hour live here.
[03:08:14.626 --> 03:08:17.368]  Joe Biggs is sitting next to me.
[03:08:18.149 --> 03:08:24.752]  And of course, Joe, I've seen you in some of the Rolling Stone articles and Esquire articles and stuff when they had embeds with you.
[03:08:24.752 --> 03:08:26.954]  Army Times, you name it.
[03:08:26.954 --> 03:08:32.196]  Loading and preparing the big warheads, the big shells.
[03:08:32.196 --> 03:08:33.117]  155 HE.
[03:08:33.117 --> 03:08:34.597]  The 155 HE.
[03:08:34.597 --> 03:08:39.540]  We probably Googled Joe Biggs artillery and actually pulled up those photos, so you know artillery.
[03:08:39.540 --> 03:08:40.901]  We were just talking during the break.
[03:08:41.681 --> 03:08:44.302]  Look, the Russians say they'll use tactical nuclear weapons.
[03:08:44.302 --> 03:08:45.623]  It looks like one.
[03:08:45.623 --> 03:08:52.927]  You see this orange-white-hot wave go out, and then you see the explosion and a mushroom cloud.
[03:08:52.927 --> 03:08:56.149]  When I've seen atomics shut off, that's what it sends out.
[03:08:56.149 --> 03:09:02.172]  I mean, I've just never seen an explosion where it's only one wave of the explosion and it's energy.
[03:09:02.172 --> 03:09:05.794]  It's, it's, it's, it's, it looks like it's atomic in nature.
[03:09:07.175 --> 03:09:10.917]  I mean, maybe it's something else, maybe I'm wrong, but let's just keep playing that.
[03:09:10.917 --> 03:09:16.020]  Joe, you said you've never seen any artillery like that or any explosion that comes close to that?
[03:09:16.020 --> 03:09:27.346]  I've fired 119ers, 198s, M777 Alpha II howitzers, you know, all kinds of different rounds, Excalibur rounds, which is a rocket-propelled, GPS-assisted projectile.
[03:09:27.346 --> 03:09:31.509]  You know, I've fired so many different artillery rounds, I've never seen an explosion like that.
[03:09:31.509 --> 03:09:34.631]  That seems like that was something that was detonated from that spot.
[03:09:35.421 --> 03:09:42.424]  Because you would think from an artillery round hitting like that it would hit and then send off fragments and then it would be multiple explosions.
[03:09:42.424 --> 03:09:49.007]  This is more centralized in one area and it's one perfect explosion from that area.
[03:09:49.007 --> 03:09:52.848]  That's why it doesn't resemble anything like I've ever seen an artillery on a target.
[03:09:52.848 --> 03:09:59.871]  And when you watch atomic bombs go off, in fact Jacobson's got a bunch of them on tape because I was putting them in a film, some of the first atomic tests
[03:10:02.059 --> 03:10:12.082]  When the film footage is up close, it first flashes and then you see the radiation go out like a bubble or a force field and then the mushroom cloud comes out of that.
[03:10:12.082 --> 03:10:13.822]  That's what you see in this footage.
[03:10:13.822 --> 03:10:21.124]  It's not like it's a gas plant or a chemical plant and it blows up and it's like a big orange, thick, black, red explosion.
[03:10:21.124 --> 03:10:23.485]  It looks atomic.
[03:10:23.485 --> 03:10:24.765]  I'm telling you, it's suspicious.
[03:10:25.205 --> 03:10:26.666]  Yeah, I mean, that's why we have to question it.
[03:10:26.666 --> 03:10:28.487]  That's why we have to do the digging here.
[03:10:28.487 --> 03:10:32.190]  Because, like you said, mainstream media isn't really paying attention to this.
[03:10:32.190 --> 03:10:39.015]  Everyone's more obsessed with the Grammys and what new show's gonna come out and Better Call Saul and all these different programs that are out.
[03:10:39.015 --> 03:10:44.238]  If it was atomic by the Russians or by Ukraine, it's meant to send a message.
[03:10:44.238 --> 03:10:46.180]  Obviously, they know mainstream won't be told about it.
[03:10:46.180 --> 03:10:49.922]  What do you think the message is, if indeed it was a tactical weapon, who would use it?
[03:10:49.922 --> 03:10:54.125]  Well, to say, hey, we're not afraid to use them, obviously, but
[03:10:56.016 --> 03:11:15.918]  It's just like you said with that's how you would use it first was kind of in the middle of nowhere or or or on a strategic location just to say hey well that's why a tactical nuke that's the purpose of one so there's not all that huge collateral damage to show you the awesome power of what it is so people can go like oh my god this is mind-blowing but it doesn't send all that damage it's a warning
[03:11:19.437 --> 03:11:21.258]  Let's watch that footage one more time.
[03:11:21.258 --> 03:11:23.360]  If you're a radio listener, it's on Infowars.com.
[03:11:23.360 --> 03:11:24.641]  It's in Joe Biggs' video.
[03:11:24.641 --> 03:11:27.103]  Give folks the title of your video.
[03:11:27.103 --> 03:11:34.289]  The title of the video was, did a nuclear weapon go off in, or was a nuke used in Ukraine?
[03:11:34.289 --> 03:11:36.971]  It's around 300,000 views right now in the past day and a half.
[03:11:36.971 --> 03:11:42.035]  Now let's watch this shockwave.
[03:11:42.035 --> 03:11:43.216]  How many miles is that away?
[03:11:43.216 --> 03:11:44.677]  15 miles from what I was told.
[03:11:55.421 --> 03:11:56.302]  Let's show this again.
[03:11:56.302 --> 03:12:05.956]  Let's back it up again one more time.
[03:12:05.956 --> 03:12:08.660]  Man, that looks like an atomic bomb.
[03:12:08.660 --> 03:12:09.160]  I mean, I have...
[03:12:10.390 --> 03:12:13.354]  You see how there's that pattern first?
[03:12:13.354 --> 03:12:15.557]  I've only seen that with the Thomas.
[03:12:15.557 --> 03:12:17.841]  Very suspicious.
[03:12:17.841 --> 03:12:20.224]  It's something we'll definitely be looking into.
[03:12:20.224 --> 03:12:24.450]  Have you sent this out to any of your army buddies that were in the nuke corps?
[03:12:24.450 --> 03:12:26.072]  We need to get this looked at by experts.
[03:12:26.793 --> 03:12:27.494]  I haven't thought about that.
[03:12:27.494 --> 03:12:28.374]  Yeah, I can definitely do that.
[03:12:28.374 --> 03:12:34.818]  I've put it out on Facebook and I've had a lot of my military buddies, you know, comment back saying that definitely looks like a nuke to them.
[03:12:34.818 --> 03:12:41.521]  But I'll definitely look into some of my NBC guys, nuclear, biological, chemical guys who are in that MOS.
[03:12:41.521 --> 03:12:47.825]  Well, I know Jacobson's back there and he's the one that's got all these nuke clips we even sent off the government to get from their archives years ago.
[03:12:47.825 --> 03:12:51.827]  And, I mean, we've got a bunch of them where they detonate them and it's exactly the same deal.
[03:12:51.827 --> 03:12:52.988]  It's like a Red Force field.
[03:12:53.348 --> 03:12:54.029]  Yeah.
[03:12:54.029 --> 03:12:55.471]  In fact, Dew knows what I'm talking about.
[03:12:55.471 --> 03:12:59.736]  I call it the force field nukes because we use it on TV all the time.
[03:12:59.736 --> 03:13:01.999]  I mean, it looks just like that, Joe.
[03:13:01.999 --> 03:13:06.725]  I mean, it's just, like you said, bubbled out.
[03:13:06.725 --> 03:13:09.609]  That's a uranium bomb with a plutonium bullet.
[03:13:10.854 --> 03:13:12.756]  I've studied it so much, that's what they look like.
[03:13:12.756 --> 03:13:18.282]  Like a low yield, where it doesn't get the full fission, where it doesn't fully detonate.
[03:13:18.282 --> 03:13:20.925]  Because with these small ones, they just can't get them to fully detonate.
[03:13:20.925 --> 03:13:26.031]  But it doesn't achieve maximum explosion for the amount of radioactive stuff they've got.
[03:13:27.032 --> 03:13:38.639]  I mean, I guess the larger hydrogen bombs, and then of course they've got all the different ones like the systems that are used to just put out radiation, neutron bombs, which they supposedly killed in 79.
[03:13:38.639 --> 03:13:39.239]  That's not true.
[03:13:39.239 --> 03:13:41.961]  They've got a huge program of neutron bombs just here in the U.S.
[03:13:41.961 --> 03:13:42.761]  alone.
[03:13:42.761 --> 03:13:51.766]  But the more high-tech, high-yield, it was a bunch of jacketed, perfectly cut... Hey Alex, sorry to cut in, but we're showing footage right now of the crater.
[03:13:51.766 --> 03:13:52.567]  This is from Rob Dew.
[03:13:53.820 --> 03:13:56.082]  Okay, is that from Ukrainian or Russian news?
[03:13:56.082 --> 03:13:59.524]  Looks like Ukrainian.
[03:13:59.524 --> 03:13:59.844]  I don't know.
[03:13:59.844 --> 03:14:01.466]  We don't know how to read it.
[03:14:01.466 --> 03:14:02.847]  Well, that is a big crater.
[03:14:02.847 --> 03:14:08.731]  I mean, there seems to just be this huge blackout in media coverage of what's going on over there.
[03:14:08.731 --> 03:14:11.793]  You know, for a while we heard there was only 5,000 casualties.
[03:14:11.793 --> 03:14:14.335]  Now they're saying 50,000 of what's going on.
[03:14:14.335 --> 03:14:20.580]  No one's really talking about this and it's being just swept under the rug here in America.
[03:14:20.580 --> 03:14:21.961]  That is a giant crater.
[03:14:21.961 --> 03:14:22.121]  Yeah.
[03:14:23.848 --> 03:14:29.369]  There's no artillery around that's going to be doing that.
[03:14:29.369 --> 03:14:41.591]  And all the trees are... But, I mean, where's the plant?
[03:14:41.591 --> 03:14:46.392]  I mean, that looks like what you see when an A-bomb's gone off, see?
[03:14:46.392 --> 03:14:48.772]  Yeah.
[03:14:48.772 --> 03:14:50.593]  Well, what chemical would there be?
[03:14:50.593 --> 03:14:53.073]  Where's the wreckage if it was a chemical plant that did that?
[03:14:53.534 --> 03:14:54.826]  I know, I don't see anything in that footage.
[03:14:54.826 --> 03:14:55.028]  That's...
[03:14:56.189 --> 03:15:02.311]  Like I said, it's so hard to get any kind of information about what's going on over there, it seems like there's this media blackout.
[03:15:02.311 --> 03:15:05.193]  It's hard to dig to find anything on what's going on over there.
[03:15:05.193 --> 03:15:07.373]  Well, it shows media blackout power.
[03:15:07.373 --> 03:15:23.019]  Because we never said that there was probably a huge epidemic of Ebola going on here in the United States, but we said we've got medical doctors by name, we had them on, you know, saying they've been ordered to cover it up, and then it came out in like AP and stuff last week, just, oh yeah, in New York and New Jersey they've been ordered to cover it up, they're disappearing people.
[03:15:25.219 --> 03:15:26.900]  I mean, that's news in and of itself.
[03:15:26.900 --> 03:15:28.321]  They can disappear people.
[03:15:28.321 --> 03:15:29.382]  Where are they going?
[03:15:29.382 --> 03:15:30.662]  Fort Monmouth in New Jersey.
[03:15:30.662 --> 03:15:32.523]  I mean, maybe they don't even have Ebola.
[03:15:32.523 --> 03:15:35.465]  The point is, why are they disappearing them?
[03:15:35.465 --> 03:15:37.666]  Forbes said they were at the meeting and they were told to cover up.
[03:15:37.666 --> 03:15:40.228]  We're talking about how they're doing that down at the border as well.
[03:15:40.228 --> 03:15:41.649]  Yeah, so we don't know.
[03:15:41.649 --> 03:15:44.170]  It just looks like an atomic bomb to me.
[03:15:44.170 --> 03:15:46.492]  That just so happens what tactical weapons are.
[03:15:48.660 --> 03:15:55.502]  There's nothing wrong with questioning what's happening and trying to look into what we see and analyze it.
[03:15:55.502 --> 03:16:03.104]  Well, if that is the real crater, this is pure bull, because there's not even a... It's of a plant anywhere.
[03:16:03.104 --> 03:16:06.225]  That's a field, which is what the Russians would do as a warning.
[03:16:06.225 --> 03:16:07.245]  It's in the middle of a forest.
[03:16:09.377 --> 03:16:11.739]  There's a chemical plant that's like about two miles away.
[03:16:11.739 --> 03:16:21.148]  It's funny when you look at Google Maps of the area where they're saying the chemical plant is, it says closed over it when you scroll over it, over that area on Google Maps.
[03:16:21.148 --> 03:16:21.988]  That's all it says over there.
[03:16:21.988 --> 03:16:25.491]  It doesn't say the name of the plant anymore.
[03:16:25.491 --> 03:16:27.653]  It just says closed.
[03:16:27.653 --> 03:16:28.394]  I smell a rat.
[03:16:28.394 --> 03:16:29.975]  What do you think's going on?
[03:16:29.975 --> 03:16:30.756]  Something's going on.
[03:16:30.756 --> 03:16:35.020]  Like I said, with what's happening here in the media, hyping people up, it's leading to something.
[03:16:35.020 --> 03:16:35.601]  It seems like
[03:16:36.536 --> 03:16:37.916]  They're trying to push for another war.
[03:16:37.916 --> 03:16:39.797]  Well John McCain said send U.S.
[03:16:39.797 --> 03:16:41.517]  troops to fight.
[03:16:41.517 --> 03:16:42.678]  Let's go fight the Russians!
[03:16:42.678 --> 03:16:43.758]  That's a wonderful idea.
[03:16:43.758 --> 03:16:44.618]  That's what he's all about.
[03:16:44.618 --> 03:16:46.619]  This guy's a bloodthirsty warmonger.
[03:16:46.619 --> 03:16:49.580]  Well what he wants is that money.
[03:16:49.580 --> 03:16:57.082]  You know, the Vice President's son took over the largest gas company in the country.
[03:16:57.082 --> 03:17:02.264]  His stake in it is about $4 billion if he tries to cash out.
[03:17:02.264 --> 03:17:03.124]  He just got out of college.
[03:17:05.100 --> 03:17:06.261]  Gotta be a nice job, huh?
[03:17:06.261 --> 03:17:07.682]  Yeah.
[03:17:07.682 --> 03:17:11.144]  That young, with that kind of money, he's gonna go corrupt very quickly.
[03:17:11.144 --> 03:17:13.806]  Talk about nepotism, though.
[03:17:13.806 --> 03:17:22.731]  I mean, how does the Vice President get away with putting his son in an ownership position in what was a state-run thing connected to the Russians?
[03:17:22.731 --> 03:17:30.016]  I mean, how do you just go, here's half the gas of Ukraine and more to you?
[03:17:30.016 --> 03:17:33.198]  It's a big passing of a torch right there.
[03:17:34.329 --> 03:17:34.749]  There it is.
[03:17:34.749 --> 03:17:38.711]  Son of USVP Joe Biden appointed to board of major Ukrainian gas company.
[03:17:38.711 --> 03:17:41.212]  You read deeper, it's an ownership position.
[03:17:41.212 --> 03:17:46.254]  Just worth unbelievable billions and billions and billions and billions.
[03:17:46.254 --> 03:17:47.294]  Look at him.
[03:17:47.294 --> 03:17:49.175]  It's just all a sick joke.
[03:17:49.175 --> 03:17:52.296]  A totally sick joke, Joe.
[03:17:52.296 --> 03:17:55.697]  Well, we'll continue to dig into this on the Nightly News at 7 o'clock tonight Central.
[03:17:55.697 --> 03:17:56.978]  Anything else, Joe?
[03:17:56.978 --> 03:17:57.398]  Negative.
[03:17:57.398 --> 03:17:57.578]  That's it.
[03:17:59.252 --> 03:18:02.675]  Let's get a hold of some nuclear physicists.
[03:18:02.675 --> 03:18:06.719]  Let's get a hold of some atomic weapons experts.
[03:18:06.719 --> 03:18:12.243]  Maybe somebody can email us and say, here's an example of a gas plant or another plant blowing up where it looks like this.
[03:18:13.527 --> 03:18:14.507]  Try to do some comparing.
[03:18:14.507 --> 03:18:36.011]  Because they'll go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[03:18:45.632 --> 03:18:47.653]  I know that some of those were dropped in Afghanistan.
[03:18:47.653 --> 03:18:48.574]  Yeah.
[03:18:48.574 --> 03:18:51.976]  Would they do something like that?
[03:18:51.976 --> 03:18:53.096]  Possibly.
[03:18:53.096 --> 03:18:55.638]  Guys, pull up a fuel air bomb as we end and go to break.
[03:18:55.638 --> 03:18:58.059]  Maybe we can show a fuel air bomb going up.
[03:18:58.059 --> 03:18:59.360]  I don't think a fuel air bomb's that big.
[03:18:59.360 --> 03:19:02.642]  I don't think it'd be that big, but it would be a substantial size.
[03:19:02.642 --> 03:19:07.044]  But I mean, like I said, it's not going to send a shockwave 15 miles out, I don't think.
[03:19:07.044 --> 03:19:15.129]  For those who don't know, it fills up a whole C-130, they drop the back, roll it out, then it detonates, what, about 500 feet off the ground?
[03:19:17.293 --> 03:19:17.774]  Correct.
[03:19:17.774 --> 03:19:20.377]  I guess what it's good for is sucking the air out of everybody's lungs.
[03:19:20.377 --> 03:19:20.557]  Yep.
[03:19:20.557 --> 03:19:21.318]  And a half mile down.
[03:19:21.318 --> 03:19:21.998]  Mm-hmm.
[03:19:21.998 --> 03:19:23.380]  So it sucks all the oxygen out.
[03:19:23.380 --> 03:19:26.623]  Yep.
[03:19:26.623 --> 03:19:29.887]  There's a fuel air going off.
[03:19:29.887 --> 03:19:31.509]  All right, Len, that's not even a very big one.
[03:19:32.708 --> 03:19:33.568]  All right, Joe.
[03:19:33.568 --> 03:19:34.489]  Well, thank you.
[03:19:34.489 --> 03:19:35.849]  Good job getting on this.
[03:19:35.849 --> 03:19:38.931]  Because, hey, it's very fair to ask, was an atomic used?
[03:19:38.931 --> 03:19:40.812]  Because this is a theater where the Russians say they'll use them.
[03:19:40.812 --> 03:19:41.732]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:19:41.732 --> 03:19:46.994]  And the West says they'll use them, so we need to look at it because it's certainly a wake-up call for people.
[03:19:46.994 --> 03:19:51.577]  Or we need to know what was at that chemical plant and why there's nothing there now.
[03:19:51.577 --> 03:19:53.217]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:19:53.217 --> 03:19:56.379]  All right, Joe Biggs, thank you so much.
[03:19:56.379 --> 03:19:56.879]  We're out of time.
