[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:34.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen
[00:34.960 --> 00:43.960]  we're live on this Tuesday the 10th day already of February 2015 I am your host Alex Jones will
[00:43.960 --> 00:52.120]  be here live for the next three hours I've had economist and analyst Mr. Dent on usually
[00:52.120 --> 00:58.000]  every six months or so but I've been having him on every few weeks as of late Harry Dent
[00:58.000 --> 01:05.680]  because so many of his specific predictions have been coming true on the economy so I
[01:05.680 --> 01:10.360]  want to get an update from him but do something we haven't done when he's been on with us
[01:10.360 --> 01:14.680]  except I think once and that is take phone calls and I really will attempt only have
[01:14.680 --> 01:19.200]  him talk for two segments ahead of opening the phones up as I like the different angles
[01:19.200 --> 01:26.840]  and directions that listeners take us with curveballs that I wouldn't have thought of
[01:26.840 --> 01:34.480]  so that is all coming up today before we go any further obviously we've got some special
[01:34.480 --> 01:41.720]  reports at the crew put together on the push for forced inoculation the facts that measles
[01:41.720 --> 01:45.840]  are something that hardly ever killed people but the measles vaccine is one of the most
[01:45.840 --> 01:51.080]  deadly tied to so many serious side effects because they're not side effects there's a
[01:51.080 --> 01:58.120]  larger social engineering mode to all this also I think I'm going to get Joe Biggs in
[01:58.120 --> 02:04.600]  here he doesn't even know this yet but I'm saying it now at 1.30 today to look at a report
[02:04.600 --> 02:11.800]  that he filed over the weekend I guess it would be Sunday evening just minutes after
[02:11.800 --> 02:19.800]  a blast inside Ukraine destroyed a chemical plant now I've grown up in Texas so I've seen
[02:19.800 --> 02:24.920]  a lot of chemical plant explosions on the news and I've seen them on the horizon when
[02:24.920 --> 02:28.440]  I've been down in South Texas and one blew up and I was like 20 miles away and it was
[02:28.440 --> 02:34.720]  a mushroom cloud so a chemical plant blowing up can look like a nuke but they tend to keep
[02:34.720 --> 02:40.800]  burning and other things around them blow up I'm not saying a tactical nuke went off
[02:40.800 --> 02:47.480]  in Ukraine we simply asked the question he called me up right after it happened and said
[02:47.480 --> 02:53.480]  hey what's this look like to you and I said it looks like a oil refinery or a small nuke
[02:53.480 --> 02:59.840]  going off except the fires basically go out very very quickly and it blew out windows
[02:59.840 --> 03:05.600]  15 miles away and caught houses on fire five miles away reportedly so we've talked to some
[03:05.600 --> 03:10.520]  of our Ukrainian sources and talked to a lot of other people who were over there and they
[03:10.520 --> 03:15.960]  just say that it's not on the news there and if it was being blamed on the Russians you'd
[03:15.960 --> 03:20.480]  be hearing all about it so I'm going to get Joe Biggs in here to go over where it's located
[03:20.480 --> 03:25.560]  he'll have the maps for TV viewers some of the back page articles because the Russians
[03:25.560 --> 03:31.680]  have threatened to use tactical nukes if NATO armor enters into Ukraine and then goes into
[03:31.680 --> 03:37.280]  directly engage Russian forces in fact that's back in the news today the Russians have a
[03:37.280 --> 03:44.600]  public doctrine that if weapons are brought up to their borders or start engaging what
[03:44.600 --> 03:50.760]  they see as basically ethnic Russians they have a right to break away that they're going
[03:50.760 --> 04:01.120]  to start using heavier weapons back in 2008 their chairman of their Joint Chiefs of Staff
[04:01.120 --> 04:06.520]  after the West started an invasion of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and North Georgia Russian
[04:06.520 --> 04:13.360]  held areas for more than 500 years once they started invading that area the Russians poured
[04:13.360 --> 04:19.560]  in pushed back the forces NATO began to land troop carriers and tank carriers in southern
[04:19.560 --> 04:23.880]  Georgia and so the Russians just made the announcement we're stopping our tanks and
[04:23.880 --> 04:28.760]  we're moving tactical nukes in and medium range we're preparing to first attack your
[04:28.760 --> 04:36.120]  forces with tactical nuclear weapons and then we will hit NATO sites with medium range multiple
[04:36.120 --> 04:43.960]  warhead MIRV missiles I say that because they're not long range missiles but they have MIRV technology
[04:43.960 --> 04:48.400]  where the even though it's only shoots 500 to 1,000 miles it pops up and it shoots a
[04:48.400 --> 04:54.200]  bunch in warheads so it's very hard to shoot down with anti-missile systems so this could
[04:54.200 --> 05:03.360]  be going on stay with us the average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges

[09:34.320 --> 09:39.520]  us very much concerns me considering that they have all this bulk ammunition that they're shooting
[09:39.520 --> 09:44.640]  targets of children would you like to tell me who it is that is doing that it is the department of

[10:43.040 --> 10:49.920]  out to be patriots are not they're nothing more than domestic terrorists that's what cobra would
[10:49.920 --> 10:55.600]  say that's what specter would say that's what goldfinger would say because that's who those people
[10:55.600 --> 11:06.000]  are i am supreme cobra commander you call your penny bureaucrats officials and authorities
[11:06.560 --> 11:16.480]  you will kneel before cobra or face my wrath resistance to tyrants is obedience to god that's

[11:38.800 --> 11:49.200]  jones and we are going to be again broadcasting for the next three hours i'm going to get kit daniels
[11:50.080 --> 11:58.560]  to pop in in about 20 minutes to go over a story he's written that's up on info wars dot com
[12:00.640 --> 12:07.360]  where we have a feminist coming out and saying i aborted my baby because he was male
[12:07.360 --> 12:13.920]  female said she didn't want to bring another monster into the world so we're going to be
[12:13.920 --> 12:22.160]  breaking uh that report down meanwhile ap has the story ohio girl 11 charged with murder in two
[12:22.160 --> 12:30.960]  month olds death ohio girl 11 charged with murder in two month olds death killed another girl
[12:30.960 --> 12:36.560]  how could it be that a girl could kill a girl or do something wrong this idea that men and women
[12:36.560 --> 12:43.120]  aren't the same species that we aren't on the same team and they somehow turn chivalry on its head
[12:43.120 --> 12:49.760]  where they have men all over the world but especially in the west apologizing for being male
[12:49.760 --> 12:57.920]  as if we did something wrong you don't see male meerkats apologizing you don't see male
[12:57.920 --> 13:05.600]  whales apologizing you don't see other mammals mongooses apologizing this is how aliens would
[13:05.600 --> 13:10.800]  take over a society by turning men and women against each other to divide and conquer and
[13:10.800 --> 13:16.720]  they sell it as chivalrous to hate yourself chivalrous that men are bad and men are disempowered
[13:16.720 --> 13:25.360]  as if disempowering men empowers women real men and real women that are healthy know that men
[13:25.360 --> 13:30.080]  build up women and women build up men and that men love their daughters as much as they love their
[13:30.080 --> 13:35.200]  sons or more and that women love their sons probably more than their daughters that's usually
[13:35.200 --> 13:42.240]  how it turns out men statistically will end up doing more giving more money fighting harder for
[13:42.240 --> 13:48.480]  daughters and mothers will end up fighting harder for sons this is how it all balances out as a
[13:48.480 --> 13:55.120]  tribal system a unit but you annihilate the meerkat mound or wide open of the globalist
[13:55.120 --> 14:01.040]  cobras to come and snack on us whenever they want to use that allegory when you break up the male
[14:01.040 --> 14:06.400]  and the female there's no longer a nuclear nest now you're wide open for programming
[14:06.400 --> 14:15.360]  and globalist assimilation into the google board and that is the plan but the good news is folks
[14:15.360 --> 14:23.520]  are striking back in a big big way governor gendall you can say what you want about governor
[14:23.520 --> 14:29.680]  gendall the video is up on info wars dot com see a daily caller article but what he's saying is
[14:29.680 --> 14:36.080]  very true and very accurate gendall unveils national plan to repeal common core to three
[14:36.080 --> 14:42.080]  and a half minute clip we're going to play it then we're going to get into all the other news
[14:42.080 --> 14:47.760]  things in ukraine are really heating up did a newt go off that's what some people think
[14:47.760 --> 14:53.920]  we're going to look at that story we're going to look at the economy record snow hitting the northeast
[14:53.920 --> 14:59.520]  uh part of the global warming they say so again pay al gore money you'll he'll fix all of it uh
[14:59.520 --> 15:05.600]  we've got other bizarro story good news charges dismissed against man arrested for drinking ice tea
[15:06.720 --> 15:12.480]  so that's coming up as well today and if you listen carefully the bankers are actually telling us
[15:12.480 --> 15:21.760]  what is going to happen next and we've got harry dent joining us to look at the global economic
[15:21.760 --> 15:28.000]  collapse more and more mainland analysts say it's imminent are you ready for the dow at 6 000
[15:28.640 --> 15:34.720]  i'm not saying it's going to happen but most the money is on that the question is when and if you
[15:34.720 --> 15:39.920]  say well i don't stock why do i care because it it's it's connected to every level of the economy
[15:39.920 --> 15:45.040]  and almost all these publicly traded companies that the stock market goes from 18 000 or 19 000 down to
[15:45.040 --> 15:52.240]  6 000 it is going to be a just a huge event well we'll be like spain or greece or ireland in deep
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.120]  deep doo doo ladies and gentlemen we don't have the tourist industry in most areas of the country
[15:57.120 --> 16:04.480]  like ireland or greece or spain do i hate to say it but just the u.s is not as interesting across
[16:04.480 --> 16:09.120]  the board this place is like ireland or spain or greece they just we just don't have the tourist
[16:09.120 --> 16:13.120]  dollars they have especially with our tsa and the rest of it people are scared to come here
[16:13.120 --> 16:18.160]  because we're not a free country in many respects but i'm babbling let's go to some very exciting
[16:18.160 --> 16:25.120]  rhetoric from governor gendall we insist today that if people come into our country they should
[16:25.120 --> 16:30.640]  respect the right of self-determination religious liberty and freedom of speech for others yet
[16:30.640 --> 16:35.920]  some of these values aren't very fashionable according to the elite that infect our media
[16:35.920 --> 16:41.280]  our government and certainly washington dc so our first point is this and that transitions
[16:41.280 --> 16:46.880]  i mean my second my first point is this the whole point the reason we have publicly funded
[16:46.880 --> 16:51.040]  education as opposed to simply telling families yes this will help you earn more money therefore
[16:51.040 --> 16:55.280]  you should go educate your children there's nothing wrong with saying education is critical
[16:55.280 --> 16:59.040]  for an aspirational society there's nothing wrong with saying education will help us develop our
[16:59.040 --> 17:06.400]  economy and improve our quality of life but fundamentally it is about self-governance it's
[17:06.400 --> 17:11.520]  about teaching the next generation of citizens to be able to hire and fire their leaders and
[17:11.520 --> 17:16.960]  become those leaders and we risk it all that american exceptionalism if we allow the elite
[17:17.840 --> 17:24.000]  oftentimes unelected behind closed doors with no transparency to dictate to us how our children
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.240]  are going to learn about american history and civics and so many other topics that are so
[17:28.240 --> 17:32.400]  important to creating that citizenry with critical thinking and that brings me to my second point
[17:32.400 --> 17:39.520]  in our lifetimes in the last five six years we have seen an overreach of government power that
[17:39.520 --> 17:46.080]  is unprecedented in our country's history and i would argue to you that none of us none of us
[17:46.080 --> 17:50.320]  would have thought possible just a few short years ago and what do i mean by that if i could
[17:50.320 --> 17:54.800]  travel through time and stand on this stage several years ago and i said to you do you really believe
[17:55.520 --> 18:01.760]  the irs would go and after conservative groups because of their beliefs i don't think we would
[18:01.760 --> 18:05.440]  have thought that possible in our country if i stood up here and said do you really believe
[18:05.440 --> 18:10.720]  the department of justice is in a go and spy on ap reporters i don't think we would have thought
[18:10.720 --> 18:15.360]  that possible if i stood up here and said do you really believe the same department of justice
[18:15.360 --> 18:21.120]  through fast and furious would be providing guns to mexican drug cartels even while our
[18:21.120 --> 18:26.880]  administration seems to oppose the the legal the constitutional gun rights of law abiding americans
[18:27.520 --> 18:31.040]  we wouldn't have thought that was possible if i were standing on the stage and said you really
[18:31.040 --> 18:34.880]  believe the federal department of justice would try to sue try to go to court in louisiana to
[18:34.880 --> 18:40.320]  shut down a school choice program we're nearly 90 percent of the kids come from minority families
[18:40.320 --> 18:46.960]  they all come from low income fleeing from schools getting c's d's or f's supposedly on the grounds
[18:47.840 --> 18:53.120]  of integration supposedly on the grounds of the same laws that were designed to protect
[18:53.120 --> 18:58.720]  the most disadvantaged students in our country we wouldn't believe that if i stood on the stage
[18:58.720 --> 19:02.000]  several years ago and said do you really believe our federal government was going to create a new
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.480]  entitlement program we can't afford the ones we've got was going to put government bureaucrats between
[19:06.480 --> 19:12.240]  you and your doctor in the form of obama care we wouldn't believe that so i think parents are right
[19:12.960 --> 19:17.760]  to be skeptical and worried about an overreach by our federal government into our k-12 classrooms
[19:18.400 --> 19:23.280]  now our opponents would tell us they would mock us and say what do you have to worry about
[19:23.280 --> 19:29.120]  but i would argue after what we have seen all the broken promises remember we were told if you like

[24:13.280 --> 24:20.000]  from deep in the heart of texas austin broadcasting worldwide in defense of human liberty i am your
[24:20.000 --> 24:27.120]  host alex jones coming up i aired this just a week or so ago we usually air these intros every
[24:27.120 --> 24:31.120]  few months because we've got dozens and dozens of them but i'm going to air a little two and a
[24:31.120 --> 24:43.440]  half minute intro that darin mcbreen and david night put together and this piece deals with
[24:43.440 --> 24:48.480]  soylent green and shows the mainstream news articles and medical journals where they say
[24:48.480 --> 24:52.160]  let's start killing babies up to age three let's start killing babies up to age five even if
[24:52.160 --> 24:57.200]  they're healthy let's start killing old people let's put the trips on secret don't treat death
[24:57.200 --> 25:04.880]  list i mean all this is really going on and to show how far we've come it was five years ago
[25:07.440 --> 25:15.040]  that paul watson found the medical journal there's a one telegraph killing babies no
[25:15.040 --> 25:20.960]  different from abortion experts say one in telegraph that was that was four five years ago
[25:21.520 --> 25:24.400]  in fact what was the date on that because they came out about four days after us
[25:24.960 --> 25:32.320]  in the telegraph so 2012 it was about three four years ago and back then paul watson found the
[25:33.120 --> 25:35.040]  mainline journal a listener sent us the tip
[25:35.040 --> 25:45.840]  in the journal of bioethics where they said yeah let's start killing kids up to age three and
[25:45.840 --> 25:53.600]  just make it the state or the parents choice and then so-called liberals came out the b mj blogs
[25:53.600 --> 26:00.640]  covered it and were defending the publication of after birth abortion and that was in the
[26:00.640 --> 26:11.840]  journal of medical ethics so when this first came out for a good four five six days only drudge
[26:11.840 --> 26:19.040]  report dot com linked to our story now drudge could go to our article see it had a link to the
[26:19.040 --> 26:28.400]  bioethics journal and that we told the truth we were attacked by msnbc by a whole bunch of other
[26:28.400 --> 26:33.600]  publications as liars saying it wasn't true now fast forward four years
[26:35.920 --> 26:40.480]  and it's all over the news that oh yeah we should start aborting babies after birth
[26:41.360 --> 26:46.960]  this is what's crazy and then joe biggs goes and does a report at ut and gets half the respondents
[26:46.960 --> 26:52.960]  to sign a petition to start aborting kids up to age five and they have the austin american statesman
[26:52.960 --> 26:59.360]  fact checker and all their publications do an article saying we're wrong there is no move
[26:59.360 --> 27:04.080]  to start killing babies after birth see so they want it both ways there is a world government
[27:04.080 --> 27:09.840]  but there isn't a world government yes vaccines can damage you but that's a conspiracy theory they
[27:09.840 --> 27:16.720]  can't even though the insert says it they play these games hoping you don't go look at the facts
[27:16.720 --> 27:23.040]  so i've got all this world news i'm going to get to but but but first i wanted to talk about this
[27:23.040 --> 27:29.680]  dehumanization because when you go to the so-called feminist websites these are anti-human websites
[27:31.120 --> 27:37.840]  these they've gotten women to hate their own species and to turn against their own species
[27:37.840 --> 27:44.320]  and it's a cult of hating men and hating other women that they can't control and it's a group
[27:44.320 --> 27:50.320]  of women given media power you name it university power to sit up there and try to bully women
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.800]  into not being barefoot and pregnant and by the way if women want to be rocket scientists or
[27:58.800 --> 28:04.880]  engineers or phd's more power to you there's always been women like that but biologically at least
[28:04.880 --> 28:11.120]  in certain times in women's lives they want to be barefoot and pregnant they're as happy as a pig
[28:11.120 --> 28:17.040]  and you know what and daddy gets real happy he gets real fat the kids are happy every statistic
[28:17.040 --> 28:24.800]  shows that's a very happy family that's how humans have always been designed that's what we do and
[28:24.800 --> 28:29.920]  that's being dismantled by the same military industrial complex that told us cigarettes were
[28:29.920 --> 28:38.880]  good for our lungs they're lying to us but now the extrapolation ends up being you can't say brown
[28:38.880 --> 28:45.840]  bag day that's racist you can't have men do good at sports or anybody win at sport because that
[28:45.840 --> 28:53.520]  makes somebody else feel bad this is cult like beyond brave new world beyond 1984 beyond the
[28:53.520 --> 29:02.400]  trial by kafka this is beyond the most hardcore dystopic literature nightmares dreamed up by people
[29:02.960 --> 29:07.680]  that lived in the soviet union or were in the soviet union or who fought against the soviet
[29:07.680 --> 29:17.280]  union or who fought against or lived under fascism books like we and the the trial uh in 1984 come
[29:17.280 --> 29:25.440]  out of firsthand experiences of of dehumanization and if we can get women to ever wake up to this
[29:25.440 --> 29:30.320]  fact about how key they are to everything they can re-empower humanity but they've been sabotaged
[29:30.960 --> 29:36.400]  men have been sabotaged as well and so if we can ever get women to realize the scientific mind
[29:36.400 --> 29:40.960]  control they're under that might as well be deployed by an alien species i mean i mean that's
[29:40.960 --> 29:45.760]  how scientific it is then we could save the human race because we're all in this together
[29:45.760 --> 29:50.000]  it's more divide and conquer we'll come back with that report we're on the march on feminists wanting

[35:57.040 --> 36:04.800]  saw the article uh that kit daniels had written dealing with feminist bragging
[36:06.240 --> 36:14.640]  that she had aborted her male baby after she saw the ultrasound because he was quote a monster
[36:14.640 --> 36:21.120]  and that she wasn't going to bring another monster into the world this shows the extremely
[36:23.040 --> 36:29.680]  sick sick sick mindset of these people now it's important to understand that when you go read
[36:29.680 --> 36:34.720]  the article feminist i aborted my baby because he was male and he linked through to the feminist
[36:34.720 --> 36:41.440]  website pushing this the so-called liberal website pushing this that these are the people that say
[36:41.440 --> 36:46.880]  turn your guns in they're killing children let us have socialist health care it's for the children
[36:47.440 --> 36:54.720]  do everything because we love you and we are the ultimate level of compassion and authority

[37:01.280 --> 37:08.880]  or something or you're straight or you're divide divide divide divide and conquer they are waging
[37:08.880 --> 37:14.960]  war on normal individual actions that are a threat to the globalist assimilation they had the
[37:14.960 --> 37:19.280]  canadian government study three years ago where they found environmentalists were six times more
[37:19.280 --> 37:23.040]  likely to steal to steal
[37:26.160 --> 37:34.080]  than conservatives and to not give to charity because they're not environmentalists there are
[37:34.080 --> 37:39.040]  real environmentalists out there that care about our creeks our creeks and rivers and streams and
[37:39.040 --> 37:44.640]  oceans and forests those are called conservationists their movement's been hijacked by eugenicist
[37:44.640 --> 37:49.760]  who then make it all about how humans are bad and all these psas never what do humans do that's
[37:49.760 --> 37:55.280]  good what do humans do that's bad never a discussion of open air gmo planting never a
[37:55.280 --> 38:00.160]  discussion of tens of thousands of cross species chimera creations that are now loose in the oceans
[38:00.160 --> 38:05.840]  uh like the super salmon that within 40 generations will extinct the normal population major university
[38:05.840 --> 38:14.480]  study there are thousands of red level crisis fish infusion artificial black holes uh teleportation
[38:15.520 --> 38:20.880]  systems they're developing where they are teleporting uh molecules and and things now
[38:20.880 --> 38:28.720]  where a lot of top scientists are openly warning it could cause a strangelet a space rip a black hole
[38:28.720 --> 38:34.000]  and a whole host of other little nasties a whole host of little nasties that we see coming out of
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.080]  the hadron superconducting supercollider and other more classified facilities
[38:41.120 --> 38:46.640]  so backing away from this ladies and gentlemen this is a group of anti human trash
[38:48.400 --> 38:52.560]  and just earlier i showed you the mainstream news article headlines and and read them out on air
[38:52.560 --> 38:59.520]  for radio listeners where pepsi's flavoring system is based on dead babies most of vaccines are made
[38:59.520 --> 39:04.320]  out of dead babies that is it's grown on dead baby tissue and you're getting all the weird viruses
[39:04.320 --> 39:12.000]  and bacteria and dna and rna and mitochondrial mutations i mean it's just crazy and you've
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.680]  just got this dehumanization going on where it's now a year old news that they've got secret death
[39:17.680 --> 39:24.160]  panels for veterans and now they've got a computer called watson from ibm deciding who gets care and
[39:24.160 --> 39:29.040]  who doesn't so they go from denying it a year ago to going yeah we do have it but don't worry a
[39:29.040 --> 39:37.360]  computer makes the decision do you know what they called the machines they had in nazi germany
[39:37.360 --> 39:42.240]  they were called three different things they were called hollerists they were called ibm and then
[39:42.240 --> 39:49.200]  its number or they were called watson's and the number of the machine the death count machines
[39:49.200 --> 39:56.720]  were called watson's can't make that up hollerists ibm's and watson's they were all ibm's
[39:58.160 --> 40:02.080]  you can't make that up and those machines they put in your calories your weight your height
[40:02.720 --> 40:06.960]  your age and then it would decide do we just shoot you right away do we starve you to death and work
[40:06.960 --> 40:12.800]  you to death and they do all these quack measurements of your head and your nose and everything else and
[40:12.800 --> 40:20.160]  go well you're not a slob or you're not a jew or you're not uh something else uh you're not you know
[40:20.160 --> 40:26.320]  asian or or african uh you know this shows you're really an arian off your measurements so we're
[40:26.320 --> 40:31.040]  not going to kill you in fact tens of thousands of jews that were put in war forest labor camps
[40:31.040 --> 40:37.760]  would then be reassigned because they the the machine said don't kill them now
[40:38.960 --> 40:46.560]  in 2015 it's been going on since 2014 there is a machine called watson from the same company
[40:46.560 --> 40:49.120]  deciding which u.s veterans to not give treatment to
[40:51.680 --> 40:56.640]  soil and green is made out of people but it's the hatred of humanity it's one thing of the
[40:56.640 --> 41:00.480]  globalists have stolen the planet and they think it's theirs and and they've been doing this for
[41:00.480 --> 41:04.640]  generations they plan to slowly poison everybody dumbest kind of and kill us but the fact that
[41:04.640 --> 41:13.920]  they get fellow traveler women to come out and to say i found out i was pregnant with a boy and
[41:13.920 --> 41:19.760]  i killed him because i'm not bringing a monster into the world well lady you're the monster
[41:19.760 --> 41:26.800]  you're the mentally ill monster on such a hateful power trip that you i mean i have fought and fought
[41:26.800 --> 41:32.640]  and fought and christians have fought and others have fought to make sure that 40 something million
[41:32.640 --> 41:38.080]  more that's how many they've already aborted in china or infanticide it after they're born
[41:39.680 --> 41:45.520]  it turned out it was an imf world bank un program going on since the 50s to get the
[41:45.520 --> 41:50.160]  chinese to sit there and cull their population one child didn't really start in the 70s like they
[41:50.160 --> 41:57.520]  claim our government made a deal with them back door and they've killed tens upon tens of millions
[41:57.520 --> 42:04.160]  of little girls i can't imagine being so twisted to go oh they're girls so it's okay because i'm a
[42:05.840 --> 42:06.800]  male chauvinist
[42:09.920 --> 42:16.000]  it's crazy how twisted these people are so kit daniels is in there in the control room
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.960]  he wrote this story it's linked through to the liberal injustice stories dot com the liberal
[42:22.960 --> 42:29.120]  feminist website and you read this stuff it sounds like a bizarre portlandia episode where she's
[42:29.120 --> 42:35.840]  just using all these university terms that they throw around about how it's this male dominated
[42:35.840 --> 42:42.560]  you know centric society and we've got to get rid of it by culling the men i mean this hey lady
[42:42.560 --> 42:49.200]  society's been culling men forever since the days of pharaoh since the days of the babelonians
[42:49.200 --> 42:54.400]  since the days of the ancient greeks people knew that the males when their numbers got too high had
[42:54.400 --> 42:59.600]  to be done away with because they might become the new ruling group and it was always old men
[42:59.600 --> 43:05.920]  sending the young men off to die so that's all you've done since you act like you're such a pseudo
[43:05.920 --> 43:14.080]  intellectual lady is you just adopted the the the program of playtoe about how they first had
[43:14.080 --> 43:18.240]  to get the women under their control then they could domesticate the other men and then cull them
[43:18.800 --> 43:24.240]  like cattle when needed and rulers would get together for thousands of years but this is
[43:24.240 --> 43:28.880]  documented in the war of the roses and others and say we're having uprisings here in france
[43:28.880 --> 43:34.000]  revving up rises in in england uh it's time for a war and then they would just have a war
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.640]  and then they would march their troops up to kill each other and really they were just wiping out
[43:38.640 --> 43:44.160]  part of the population so the population would learn to hate the french and they would learn
[43:44.160 --> 43:51.040]  to hate the british when meanwhile in most of the wars the elites were simply culling their
[43:51.040 --> 43:56.080]  numbers now the as techs were more sophisticated you've actually got to hand it to them they
[43:56.080 --> 44:02.720]  completely ritualized war with neighboring kingdoms in some cases thousands of miles away they would
[44:02.720 --> 44:08.320]  uh march and then go into central america uh or the folks would march up from central america or
[44:08.320 --> 44:13.280]  from central north america down to southern north america and have big battles and and how do they
[44:13.280 --> 44:18.640]  know when to have the battles it was all astrological sometimes it would be over a hundred years before
[44:18.640 --> 44:22.800]  they would have one and then they would have these ritualized battles saying the earth needs the blood
[44:22.800 --> 44:27.440]  of the warriors and so we're going to wipe everybody out here and then we'll bind some women and
[44:27.440 --> 44:33.040]  children and throw them into cenote pitch to the water gods and to the you know deity of the woman's
[44:33.040 --> 44:38.800]  womb and then we'll uh cut some hearts out to the sun god over here to the winged serpent
[44:40.080 --> 44:47.520]  on and on and on so we're seeing a repeat of all of this so don't worry feminist don't worry
[44:47.520 --> 44:54.320]  there's a reason the population of the world is only 45 male and 51 percent of births are female
[44:54.320 --> 45:01.040]  female despite all of china's culling of women mammals have more female offspring than they have
[45:01.040 --> 45:07.680]  male because the truth is if you get into the genetics
[45:10.480 --> 45:18.160]  the male is just basically like a warrior model of a female without a uterus bigger bones more
[45:18.160 --> 45:26.480]  aggressive and then the female basically is the species so uh you guys are true jackasses
[45:27.440 --> 45:34.560]  when it comes to uh these attempts to dehumanize your yourselves you attack men you attack yourself
[45:34.560 --> 45:40.240]  men attack women you attack yourself and i have no guilt i will not be part of this mental illness
[45:40.240 --> 45:45.680]  i've done nothing to women but empower them and take care of them and and work with them and i
[45:45.680 --> 45:52.000]  enjoy taking care of women i enjoy being sweet to women i enjoy empowering women and they like
[45:52.000 --> 45:58.160]  empowering me and that's the kind of women i want in my life not the parasitic twisted
[45:58.160 --> 46:03.840]  sociopathic psychopathic types that think it's okay most criminals have a rationale
[46:04.880 --> 46:08.800]  when the arian nations or other groups have been out caught engaged in criminal activity they always
[46:08.800 --> 46:13.120]  have an excuse how they were doing or when black gangs or hispanic gangs you know go out and you
[46:13.120 --> 46:17.520]  know kill somebody of another so-called race it's because well they deserved it and that's
[46:17.520 --> 46:22.560]  all the feminist are is a criminal gang paul watson calls it third wave feminism look it's
[46:22.560 --> 46:28.400]  feminism feminism was started to look legitimate to empower women on the surface it was never
[46:28.400 --> 46:32.800]  meant to do that ebra bernays wrote about that in the 20s one of the pioneers of it it was meant
[46:32.800 --> 46:39.280]  to shackle women and enslave them to the state and it's been done that's a fact so it isn't and i'm
[46:39.280 --> 46:43.600]  not just disagreeing with watson here you know watson puts out articles i disagree with he puts
[46:43.600 --> 46:47.440]  out ideas and you know things that i don't agree with he thinks something is in a hoax i think
[46:47.440 --> 46:52.560]  it is a hoax paul's really smart but i want to explain something if i openly say i disagree with
[46:52.560 --> 46:58.080]  something one of my writers wrote or i disagree with one of the nuances on air it's not a a
[46:58.080 --> 47:05.600]  diss or under the bus statement uh it's not a unified cult up here at info wars dot com
[47:05.600 --> 47:09.200]  where it's my way or the highway and everyone has to totally agree with me
[47:09.200 --> 47:14.640]  because my views change day to day as i get more information but it's the mere fact that people
[47:14.640 --> 47:20.640]  are even uncomfortable openly debating someone else or think that if i disagree with something
[47:20.640 --> 47:27.120]  that's a curtain emos written that then i somehow am attacking him that's not the case
[47:27.120 --> 47:32.160]  we're not a cult we love liberty we love freedom we love truth we love justice we love not having
[47:32.160 --> 47:37.600]  a nuclear war we love prosperity we love common sense that's who i hire smart people that love
[47:37.600 --> 47:42.720]  common sense and recognize monsters when they see them who set up their lecturing us like
[47:42.720 --> 47:48.320]  their god bossy control freaks that are so bossy they had the first lady come out last year and
[47:48.320 --> 47:54.400]  say don't use the word bossy because it refers to women well yeah there is an arc type of the bossy
[47:54.400 --> 47:58.960]  control freak out of control woman just like there's an arc type of the bossy out of control
[47:58.960 --> 48:03.600]  control freak male but all these are is want to be dominant women that don't dominate with
[48:03.600 --> 48:08.880]  their beauty or their art or their love or their compassion or with their hard work they dominate
[48:08.880 --> 48:13.920]  him pecking men and other women into saying they're the boss well guess what hillary you
[48:13.920 --> 48:20.720]  ain't the boss guess what uh michelle you're not my boss your criminal scum parasites that
[48:20.720 --> 48:27.600]  want to sell women on hating their sons you're sick freak filth how dare you try to break
[48:27.600 --> 48:34.080]  up the human community it's anti-humanism it's anti-familism whatever word you want to use
[48:34.080 --> 48:40.800]  it it's psychic death joining us is kit daniels to talk about his article kit uh i aborted my baby
[48:40.800 --> 48:45.840]  because it was a boy as the headline and they're very proud of themselves hailing this they're
[48:45.840 --> 48:50.720]  there to push the oberton window they're there to condition us to accept anything and i guess we will
[48:50.720 --> 48:56.240]  if they say it's liberal we'll put a 25 year old soldier or sailor on a death list to not be
[48:56.240 --> 49:01.040]  on a death list to not give them treatment for kidney failure and i guess if it's a boy it's okay
[49:01.040 --> 49:08.080]  kit yeah throughout history tyrants have attempted to dehumanize the population in order to replace
[49:08.080 --> 49:12.560]  god with the state and that's why we see this destruction of our rights because they can treat
[49:12.560 --> 49:18.640]  us like slaves and the tyrants the politicians they can see themselves as gods that's why we see
[49:18.640 --> 49:22.240]  destruction of the bill of rights right now destruction of the family destruction of
[49:22.240 --> 49:29.280]  of prosperity so on so forth and also you mentioned earlier about the ascetic empire it made me
[49:30.560 --> 49:36.480]  made me it reminded me of the fact that the spanish empire was able to take over these
[49:36.480 --> 49:41.040]  ancient empires in central and south america because they'd wiped out all their men yeah
[49:41.040 --> 49:46.560]  that and also they used divide and conquer tactics which is exactly what the establishment has done
[49:46.560 --> 49:51.520]  with the feminist movement ever since the 1960s with gloria steinen and so on so forth that's right
[49:51.520 --> 49:56.800]  what was it less than 400 caquistadors were able to conquer over a million people and just in one
[49:56.800 --> 50:00.800]  valley yeah i think it was even less than that in certain instances i think there's only like 30 or
[50:00.800 --> 50:06.400]  40 men taken over thousands of uh of tribes just because they're playing off rivals each other and
[50:06.400 --> 50:10.720]  that's this is basically common macky of ellie statecraft we saw the busy teen empire do that
[50:10.720 --> 50:14.800]  that's why they survived for a thousand years because they were playing off their rivals within
[50:14.800 --> 50:19.520]  the neighboring uh principalities off each other that's just a comment and they do it to us and
[50:19.520 --> 50:23.840]  they write books about how they're doing it to us because they think we're so stupid yeah because
[50:23.840 --> 50:28.160]  people unfortunately people don't understand history they're using the same strategies over
[50:28.160 --> 50:33.680]  and over again they have used for thousands of years and this even today with the feminist movement
[50:33.680 --> 50:38.240]  they're using this divide and conquer they're pitting women against men through feminism and the
[50:38.240 --> 50:43.440]  women that are into this really think they're not getting ahead because of men it's like people
[50:43.440 --> 50:47.680]  like bill mar that says i'm for death i'm for mass death i want to get the highway moving but
[50:47.680 --> 50:52.400]  banned guns because they kill children no banned guns because he wants a monopoly of power that's
[50:52.400 --> 50:57.440]  what the heavily armed establishment with all their bodyguards wants but when they say clear
[50:57.440 --> 51:02.640]  off the highways you move to a city because it's teeming and there's a lot of jobs it's like a coral
[51:02.640 --> 51:08.240]  reef i've used this analogy many times you might be out in the ocean and go 10 miles before you run
[51:08.240 --> 51:12.720]  along a coral reef off an island everything else is basically dead out there there's not a lot of
[51:12.720 --> 51:17.200]  life until you hit that coral reef now when you hit a coral reef you'd think my gosh it's over
[51:17.200 --> 51:23.680]  populated well no the population being high is what shows you that there's a density of life
[51:23.680 --> 51:29.600]  that it's healthy and so humans say i don't like lines it's like a you know a really good restaurant
[51:29.600 --> 51:33.360]  it's hard to get into it's because it's a really good restaurant i mean go out and live in a ghost
[51:33.360 --> 51:37.280]  town go out in the middle of nowhere and then you'll be moving back really quick but it's the same
[51:37.280 --> 51:42.640]  people that are sitting in the midst of a civilization saying they hate the very civilization
[51:42.640 --> 51:47.440]  that allowed them to develop and they have all these opportunities but instead they're spoiled brats
[51:47.440 --> 51:53.840]  that are so greedy that at a fundamental level they think killing people old ladies veterans
[51:53.840 --> 51:59.040]  children will get them ahead because then they'll get a bigger piece of the pie they don't get the
[51:59.040 --> 52:04.640]  fact we could build this pie to infinity if we weren't letting the global social engineers suppress
[52:04.640 --> 52:09.760]  the true new technologies that we know have been developed we're being put into a new dark age
[52:09.760 --> 52:14.800]  we're only a tiny elite will have access to all of this incredible technology not just life extension
[52:15.760 --> 52:20.720]  but nano tech the list i mean it's incredible but they won't let us have it because they want to go
[52:20.720 --> 52:27.360]  ahead and set up the world government call our numbers dumb us down who's left to basically
[52:27.360 --> 52:32.800]  toy with us it's such a sick plan talk about what this feminist uh breaks down in her story that's
[52:32.800 --> 52:38.880]  being held by liberals it's just ambrosia i mean it comes down to let's kill men men are fundamentally
[52:38.880 --> 52:45.680]  bad men are the problem this is the sick cult we're dealing with well yeah she's uh broadcasting
[52:45.680 --> 52:50.400]  this kind of group mentality of us versus them this is exactly what the establishment wants
[52:50.400 --> 52:54.160]  because they only gain power through groups because they can control groups they can't control
[52:54.160 --> 53:00.720]  individuals so in order to uh to have a power structure as they put they put people in different
[53:00.720 --> 53:05.360]  groups and have the groups fight among each other and they also put their own leaders and
[53:05.360 --> 53:12.800]  charter the groups like al sharpton for example so it's just this whole uh collectivism can only
[53:13.440 --> 53:18.080]  be strengthened it can only exist through group mentality that's unfortunately what we're seeing
[53:18.080 --> 53:24.640]  now now i want to try to invite this witch on the broadcast let's go over some of this article
[53:25.200 --> 53:29.120]  over the past three years i've lost many friends and several of my own family members
[53:29.120 --> 53:33.920]  have completely caught off communication with me i know now that these are adults close quote
[53:33.920 --> 53:38.480]  who are who cannot handle the fact that i have the right to make choices and these choices ultimately
[53:39.440 --> 53:44.640]  hardly ever affect them she goes on to talk about killing her her son can you imagine
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.400]  how unhappy and sick this person is and how they're going to feel later when they finally wake up
[53:50.400 --> 53:54.800]  but see the problem is once you make evil decisions like this a lot of cowards kit
[53:54.800 --> 53:59.680]  keep doubling down saying it's right and the right way to go i mean who in their right mind
[53:59.680 --> 54:04.880]  could say i killed my baby because it was a boy you know in all honesty when i read the article
[54:04.880 --> 54:09.520]  i was thinking myself there's a possibility that she knows she did wrong but she now she's trying
[54:09.520 --> 54:13.200]  to rationalize it by saying oh well this is good for the feminist movement you know this is
[54:13.200 --> 54:19.520]  empowering it made me feel stronger and by avoiding my baby it brought out all the hate
[54:19.520 --> 54:23.520]  against feminism in general and this is how future feminists should have to deal with it
[54:23.520 --> 54:29.920]  so it's really sickening that notice she says though it made her stronger just like when a
[54:29.920 --> 54:34.880]  satanist guts a baby they say it gives them power i mean she is getting power from this
[54:34.880 --> 54:41.040]  it takes a lot of will to consciously say this is a boy this is my son and i'm gonna cap his ass
[54:41.040 --> 54:48.400]  excuse my french i mean this is hardcore my body my body's betrayal was no more i was free i felt
[54:48.400 --> 54:54.480]  strong is her disgusting quote you know i've read a lot of articles about people who uh
[54:54.480 --> 54:58.400]  they can't understand they can't grasp the establishment the new world order so on so forth
[54:58.400 --> 55:03.520]  because they have uh people like you and me we have a moral compass so how can we possibly
[55:04.400 --> 55:11.760]  see transnational uh elites how they operate and how they don't care about humanity when we
[55:11.760 --> 55:16.960]  you and me don't even have that kind of reference point and unfortunately i i think this lady is just
[55:16.960 --> 55:23.040]  like a tyrant because she also doesn't have a moral compass oh she is a tyrant she has something
[55:23.040 --> 55:28.560]  weak and defenseless that was literally part of her soul and then she murdered it and smashed it
[55:28.560 --> 55:32.960]  because it made her feel powerful she is a demon yeah and i hope that people they look at this
[55:32.960 --> 55:38.720]  article and they what they take from it is the fact that this attitude that she's showing this
[55:38.720 --> 55:44.480]  complete disregard for human life and for humanity is what the most powerful people in the world
[55:44.480 --> 55:48.560]  are also share and that's right exactly how they and that's totally key thank you kit daniels your

[1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:38.160]  from austin texas alex jones i almost want to go on a rant right now about petty garbage
[1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:46.720]  because people will get mad if aircraft have cuss words on the sides but they don't care
[1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:50.800]  about aircraft drop bombs on innocent men women and children i'm kind of ripping that off from
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:56.640]  apocalypse now and i was just thinking about uh one time my wife bought me some polo shirts
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:01:01.120]  that were kind of boy scoutish and i wore some of them on air and people thought that was some
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:08.560]  secret code and then joe jennings is wearing a popular style rockabilly shirt today that looks
[1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:14.400]  like uh you're about to go to a big barbecue and eat some ribs and i i just went in there during
[1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:19.040]  the other break and i said listen don't go on tv wearing that with the skull and crossbones on it
[1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:24.080]  people think i'm sending some secret illuminati message and then i thought about it i said you
[1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:30.640]  know what what let's cut to joe in there and we'll we'll cut to the control room shot and let's he
[1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:36.320]  put tape uh like i guess he's a go-go dancer and they put tape somewhere else but he put tape
[1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:39.760]  over the skull and crossbones go ahead and take that tape off because you know what
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:44.400]  intention is what matters in this universe i have to know that's a rockabilly style shirt
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:47.920]  that just means hey i like motorcycles i like to eat barbecue i like to have a good time
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:54.720]  and so when he wears it it isn't bad and i'm not going to bow down to people that want to
[1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:59.120]  criticize and claim we're doing illuminati this we're doing illuminati that i want to promote
[1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:04.000]  liberty and human freedom and empowerment and people can say whatever they want about what i do
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:10.480]  uh and so i mean it's like prismplanet.com we had one of the graphics folks you know
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:15.120]  i said i want a planet on the front you know the earth prism planet and so obviously the
[1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:19.360]  most classic thing is the sun behind the earth it's beautiful people said that's illuminati
[1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:24.560]  because it is illuminati when obama uses that sign you know like meaning a new era a new order is
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:32.560]  coming in but but not when we do it so every symbol has been expropriated it has been taken by the
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:40.000]  new world order whether it's the cross or whether it's the the swastika is a sun symbol in every
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:46.480]  culture in every culture spending clockwise or counterclockwise and it's a very powerful symbol
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:53.680]  it's a very beautiful symbol i've seen um you know museums nordic uh art and i've seen native
[1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:59.600]  american art and indian art from india that's so beautiful but you can't in fact in india
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:04.400]  they're getting complaints that are actually covering up swastikas on multi thousand year old
[1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:09.760]  temples because westerners are coming and becoming offended the indians don't have swastikas carved
[1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:17.120]  on there because they support hitler hitler took the symbol from the tibetans i mean that's what
[1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:22.800]  i'm talking about i'm just sick of it i'm sick of the ignorance i'm sick of the political correctness
[1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:31.600]  it just permeates everything it absolutely drives me up the wall let me tell you there's
[1:03:31.600 --> 1:03:37.360]  illuminati symbolism it's when the whole agenda is anti-gun anti-family pro gmo
[1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:43.600]  pro feature baby formula that brain damages it and then every halftime show is some occultic
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:47.680]  ceremony or during the 9-11 ceremony a few years ago they had an all-seeing eye and
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:53.040]  flash and i in the middle of it i mean that was a ceremony but not when one of my crew comes in
[1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:59.440]  and is wearing a rockabilly outfit that's really popular in austin i wouldn't say popular it's been
[1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:07.520]  popular for a long time uh but uh it's like one time one of our designers did like a 1776 thing
[1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:12.640]  with a skull on it so i wanted a skull with a uh track-oriented hat on it like hey liberty loves
[1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:17.280]  again i had people calling in going what is this you know what the hell you doing with a skull
[1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:23.200]  it it all depends on how it's being used ladies and gentlemen anyways i didn't mean to go off on

[1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:07.600]  did you have us forces massing with mercenaries in poland and in ukraine engaging in combat with
[1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:13.200]  the russians and now you've got john mccain and others this week and last week saying we need to
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:19.920]  give them tanks and air cover and everything else in a fight over an area of ukraine
[1:09:19.920 --> 1:09:27.600]  cramia that has been under russian control off and on for more than 500 years and that russia has fought
[1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:37.040]  five or six major wars a few dozen others sub wars i mean this is part of russia like
[1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:46.480]  florida's part of the u.s. yet the end of world war two they divided up well the nazis kind of
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:50.720]  divided up ukraine until they turned on the russians and that same thing with poland
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:55.920]  but that's the only reason ukraine is kind of its own area is because of world war two
[1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:00.080]  and i'm not saying the russians haven't abused the ukranians and there have been a lot of
[1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:05.760]  problems the point is the west is in there fomenting this this is a really serious situation

[1:11:55.440 --> 1:12:01.040]  on air 20 because people would say you don't have photos of un signs saying it's under un control
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:07.840]  at big bend or at uh the grand canyon so i started you know streaming video to show people

[1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:41.680]  for coming on with us today we're going to get into a whole host of different economic issues but
[1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:48.000]  more and more we do see the establishment analysts are starting to sound more like you
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:56.400]  saying they believe something bigger than 2008 is coming yeah you know we've already we've seen
[1:12:56.400 --> 1:13:01.680]  every bubble that's come up you know the tech bubble in 2000 at the peak and then crashed and then
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:07.120]  the more recent one in 2007 now we got an even bigger bubble every bubble's gone higher and
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:11.600]  every crash has gone lower and there's a simple reason for that the fundamental trends that were
[1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:17.680]  great in the 80s 90s and early 2000s demographics and internet and technology the things that really
[1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:23.600]  make an economy grow innovation the aging of people into the most productive these things are gone
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:29.440]  ever since 2007 government central banks around the world are simply just printing money to make
[1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:33.040]  up for the economic weakness and doing it in greater and greater amounts and of course that's
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:38.080]  like taking more and more of a drug and hoping things work out it doesn't work out and so we
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:44.720]  have to come down harder we have more debt than we had in 2007 and eight at the end of last crisis
[1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:50.720]  private debts come down a little bit but government debts gone way up countries like Japan massively
[1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:57.040]  more debt but the biggest thing to us you know Alex is we really number one focus on demographics
[1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:02.320]  it's the one thing you predict about an economy and its people how old they're going to be how
[1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:07.600]  much they earn spend and do everything as they age I can even predict when people weigh the most or
[1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:13.440]  eat the most calories or or drive the most miles on their card we can put a cradle degree of what
[1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:21.600]  people do in 2015 like 2008 last time around in 1990 before that with the Japanese this is going to
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:28.560]  be a shift year for demographics because in 1990 the Japanese baby boom started to turn down after
[1:14:28.560 --> 1:14:34.960]  a massive real estate and stock bubble we predicted that 89 was going to burst while the rest of the
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:40.240]  world was going to boom and their baby boom in US and Europe were just getting going it did burst
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:44.000]  even though the rest of the world did well it shows how powerful demographics are
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:50.160]  we said 20 years ago and increasingly hey after 2007 the baby boomers in the US are done they're
[1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:54.880]  going to peak on average and the economy will start to slow down and of course that's why governments
[1:14:54.880 --> 1:14:59.360]  have had to step up so much stimulus but there's another thing important that happens this year
[1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:06.960]  in 2015 the everyday person did peak in 2007 at age 46 that's when the average person spends the
[1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:13.520]  most money well the most affluent people the 20% that drive over 50% of our income and spending
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:18.720]  still and are being gooseed up by all of this QE because it makes the stock market and their
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:25.120]  financial assets go up and this 20% owns like 90% of the financial asset they're doing better than
[1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:31.200]  ever but age 53 that's at the end of last year that's when they peak and turn down their kids
[1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:37.440]  leave the nest they slow down and spending and the same year is when car sales the last of the
[1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:43.360]  major segment because because housing obviously peak first in the early 2000 and then furniture
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:49.760]  in 2007 the other big sector well the last big sector is automobiles automobile sales are going
[1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:54.080]  to are going to turn down in the next couple years and people are not going to know why and
[1:15:54.080 --> 1:15:59.520]  and some of the smartest investors George Soros and Warren Buff in the world are making major
[1:15:59.520 --> 1:16:05.840]  acquisitions and investments in car retail dealership the worst place you could be so we use demographics
[1:16:05.840 --> 1:16:12.320]  to look around the corner 2015 is going to be a pivotal year we warned last year that Germany
[1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:16.800]  and Italy we're going to start to go in Europe and then one country after next falls off the
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:22.320]  cliff and that's why we call this recent book the demographic cliff it started with Japan a giant
[1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:27.840]  baby boom peaking and turning down then it shifted to the US now it's shifting to the affluent sectors
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:33.840]  of the US and to Europe one country after the next if these central bankers think they've
[1:16:33.840 --> 1:16:38.080]  had to print a lot of money that's far they're going to have to do way more and then the markets
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:42.880]  just aren't going to tolerate you can only take so much of a drug before you die of the drug itself
[1:16:43.760 --> 1:16:48.480]  now Harry you broke this down last time your new book gets into it and I want to look at some of
[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:53.440]  these other graphs that you've sent along I want to look at what's happening with the major stock
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:17:00.240]  market indexes but shifting gears specifically out of the big issue into all the sub issues
[1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:07.840]  we see this liberal obsession in the west of not having children with having children being bad
[1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:12.240]  and I've had different demographers on to break down the fact that we need one point
[1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:20.640]  you know two people for every person so for two people we need 2.2 2.4 children to be born in a
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:28.640]  country and that we are not doing that now the replacement rate is 2.2 for every two people
[1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:32.640]  and because obviously some people die in car wrecks or whatever so you need more than two people to
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:38.480]  be born every two people living just to keep the culture and economy going but that's not happening
[1:17:38.480 --> 1:17:45.840]  Japan's 1.3 children Germany's 1.3 Italy's 1.3 some are even lower this is accelerating
[1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:54.240]  then meanwhile we have unskilled third world populations that are still climbing and I see
[1:17:54.240 --> 1:18:00.640]  so many policies by the west being put into place to pretty much kill the west I mean I don't think
[1:18:00.640 --> 1:18:06.480]  there's any doubt that we're seeing the west commit suicide yeah you know I unfortunately just
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:11.920]  this is happening everywhere fewer kids per family like you say most emerging countries outside of
[1:18:11.920 --> 1:18:18.160]  China are growing at more than replacement rate but all western countries with a few exceptions
[1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:23.600]  like Australia and Switzerland where only because they attract a lot of immigrants are they more
[1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:28.880]  than replacing themselves every major western country will see the next generation be smaller
[1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:34.240]  than this one that has devastating consequences not only slowing population but even faster
[1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:40.080]  slowing workforce how do you grow with less and less people working but but but even more than
[1:18:40.080 --> 1:18:45.200]  that in the home construction and then home and real estate industry there's going to be more people
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:50.240]  dying than buying homes because old people are sellers when they die or moving to nursing home
[1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:56.400]  and young people buy so it's going to cause huge changes that are very very easy to project Alex
[1:18:56.400 --> 1:19:02.560]  but nobody sees it economists are here they do understand we're not replacing ourselves they
[1:19:02.560 --> 1:19:08.000]  do understand there's going to be like two workers for everyone retiree which is absolutely not
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:13.360]  sustainable especially at ever rising benefits that are not adjusted for life expectancy we'd be
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:18.720]  retiring at age 75 today that we adjusted since social security sure for expectancy well we've
[1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:22.800]  got to go to break when we come back I want to look at Russia I want to look at other things in
[1:19:22.800 --> 1:19:27.520]  the world economy and I get your take on what you think's behind some of these really aggressive
[1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:34.320]  dangerous moves in my view by the west to destabilize Russia where you see oil going and a lot more

[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:36.560]  questions that's coming up in the next segment but since you were on a month ago or so or three
[1:24:36.560 --> 1:24:42.400]  weeks ago there's been a lot of developments a lot of saber rattling john mccain saying let's back up
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:48.640]  ukraine militarily against russia these are in just insane statements out in the open the media
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:57.440]  claims obama is vacillating on ukraine no he's not he's just not admitting that they are sending
[1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:03.840]  more troops more armor more weapons in there in a hot war with russia i mean i i think it's clear
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:10.240]  that's going on uh just economically how does this affect things why would the western establishment
[1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:14.880]  in your view i mean you've ran a lot of operations for bane capital you're a smart guy you've been
[1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:20.080]  around the world looking at this what are your what are your colleagues saying as well about
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:24.720]  what's going on here because a lot of the former analyst and current analyst say this is one of
[1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:30.480]  the most dangerous things they've ever seen well you know it is and it's because we're in a in a
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:36.800]  dangerous cycle uh ever since 9 11 we call it the geopolitical cycle eight things were wonderful in
[1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:44.240]  the world from 1983 and into maybe early 2001 and then we have 9 11 hit and it's been one terrorist
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:50.480]  attack one civil war after the next and this is just another thing russia broke up when we started
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:54.960]  winning the cold war and they kind of had to surrender into the last cycle being positive
[1:25:54.960 --> 1:26:00.480]  and that was a big relief for the world when that cold war threat wore off well we're back in it
[1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:06.640]  and now it's the middle east and it's bokeh haram and it's isis but you know russia broke up and it's
[1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:12.800]  in putin's interest um to kind of put it back together i mean their demographics are poor
[1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:18.640]  especially as you go forward oil prices are dropping the ruble is collapsed they're in big
[1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:24.160]  trouble anything he can do to expand this is exactly what hitler did um in the great depression
[1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:29.040]  when everything was down and germany had gone through a hyperinflation crisis that he decided
[1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:33.040]  the best way to grow was to is to beg are they neighbor take over your neighbors uh you know
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:41.360]  what do they call it uh laban shroud yeah yeah a hostile acquisition you know and and so you know
[1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:47.680]  that's what he wants to do and what he does like any other uh uh guy like him when he sees an opening
[1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:52.400]  goes forth and he kind of backs off for a while you know so he's just looking for openings i mean
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:57.920]  he's got every reason to go into ukraine and the question is should europe and the us fight him
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:02.560]  because we keep trying to get out of wars but there's more civil wars in the middle east and
[1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:07.680]  other places and here we got this these stuff do threaten trade they do threaten a lot of things
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:12.080]  for europe and us so so you know it's kind of this i think do we go in there or not but it's hard to
[1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:18.400]  win these wars and and and we're we're kind of like running out of the ability to do this sort of
[1:27:18.400 --> 1:27:25.600]  thing but if i tell you this geopolitical cycle um does not turn up until around early 2020 so we
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:30.960]  keep telling people whether it's more civil wars where it's the rise in terrorist activity now in
[1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:37.600]  europe which we're not surprised at ices getting more and more defiant and and just brutal this
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:42.960]  is likely to continue for the next yeah what is the demographic bloom in muslims in the middle east
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:48.160]  mean that that population explosion i mean that's just a natural thing than to invade other countries
[1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:54.240]  yeah i mean the they are one of the highest demographic you know for births their whole
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:59.920]  population the poorer populations in general have higher birth rates what i noticed the other day i
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:04.160]  was just just doing an analysis for for one of our articles in our newsletters and i just
[1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:08.400]  think you know look at this rising terror thing in europe and where does it come from and is it is
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:13.360]  it all muslims and not and you know it's not number one the countries the middle east and north
[1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:20.000]  african are the only region that have an absolute you know 90 plus muslim so that's number one flag
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:25.760]  the second thing which is more important to me it's in the middle east with a sudden rise in
[1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:31.120]  wealth of oil that these countries didn't just gradually move into the modern era like like
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:36.480]  indonesia or or bangladesh or other countries or malaysia that have high muslim population
[1:28:36.480 --> 1:28:41.280]  they were suddenly thrown you know this this you know this wealth in the west versus the kind of
[1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:45.680]  backwardness and poverty of their of their nations and then you go and turn around and look at
[1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:52.000]  countries like indonesia that this uh uh almost all muslim and i've been in indonesia twice
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:58.080]  extensively these people don't have any civil wars to speak about they don't have insurgencies
[1:28:58.080 --> 1:29:03.920]  and all this discontent so it's where you get this concentration where you get this clash of west
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:10.080]  versus uh uh older cultures that you get this and i tell you this is bad these people are fighting
[1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:14.240]  for their life they think they're right that's what we don't get they think they are right
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:18.320]  and they have to do this and they'll go to any extreme and that's what makes it so dangerous the
[1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:25.040]  same thing who's back in the corner he's got to do something or russia just died and the west is

[1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:50.640]  over and we've been doing that i don't know six seven years ago we were reaching maybe a million
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:57.280]  and a half people a day with all the different platforms you know maybe six seven eight million
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:02.320]  people a week now it's well over three million a day just the radio show you add it all together
[1:35:02.320 --> 1:35:10.080]  we conservatively reach 20 million people but here's what's different less than half of that's in
[1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:14.720]  the u.s and we are popular in the u.s but most talk shows and things quote target a demographic
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:21.440]  we don't target a demographic we target humanity so we have listeners in japan and in south africa
[1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:27.520]  and in russia and in mexico and in brazil and info or stickers and signs you put up all over the
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:35.120]  world but that's 20 million people worldwide from youtube to all the different platforms that
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:41.200]  see our videos or listen to the radio show we can't measure all the facebook and twitter and the rest
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:47.840]  of it conservatively 20 million imagine if a fraction of the 20 million went and bought survival
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:53.120]  shield x2 true dacian iodine that's the good halogen that so many people are deficient in a
[1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:58.560]  they would really you know get a good response and we come back and be a repeat buyers and then we
[1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:04.320]  would be massively funded to just do incredible things dwarfing what we've done so far we have a
[1:36:04.320 --> 1:36:10.480]  fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the people that tune into this radio show or watch this
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:16.400]  television simulcast that purchase the products look we have our own problems we can't keep on
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:22.000]  supply made in america t-shirts of the molon lobby in fact i'm about to have to pull the trigger on
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:27.840]  central american or something shirts and say we don't have american in stock we just can't get it
[1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:35.360]  in the numbers we want of say the camouflage and i haven't done it yet the point is is that a lot of
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:39.680]  it's just the market scale we've got a gear up to a level to where he can even reach our listeners
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:46.000]  so it's a symbiotic situation we don't get funded like mpr with 400 plus million of taxpayer money
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:52.480]  every year and they have pledge drives to push all their anti-human socialist garbage we don't
[1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:58.720]  get billions of stimulus money like the parent company of msnbc who then they gave over a hundred
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:04.080]  million dollars of stimulus money directly to that outfit and people like rachel madow got raises
[1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:09.200]  off your tax money they have no viewers of course they've got to be state sponsored they're really
[1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:15.920]  state-run media we are funded by viewers and listeners like you so spread the word it's having a
[1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:21.760]  huge effect keep it up redouble your efforts we're having a big effect really creating talking points
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:26.720]  throughout the political spectrum that get us back to americana basic ideas not all the fake
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:31.440]  talking points to confuse the public that establishment media puts out we're having a huge effect
[1:37:32.400 --> 1:37:37.360]  and if you'll just buy the high-quality nutraceuticals if you'll buy the survival shield x2 and get a free
[1:37:37.360 --> 1:37:42.960]  bottle of uh ancient defense when you do that when you go and you get for valentine's day the

[1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:14.400]  and our sponsors as well like mr dent he's not on because he became a sponsor he spent a little
[1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:18.560]  bit of money with us did some advertising for his book i mean that's what it's all about we're all
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:23.920]  symbiotically who are promoting liberty and free market working together but we're at war
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:29.040]  because they've attacked us with the collectivist that are seeking to shut that down that's my next
[1:38:29.040 --> 1:38:34.160]  question for mr dent that i want him to finish up any other points and go to calls he just
[1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:38.960]  talks about and you just talk about sir hard demographics historical cycles but you've got
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:44.560]  all the new fraudulent flash trading computers you've got all the new gaming systems that you've
[1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:50.000]  talked about how does that fit in and how does the clowered and piven socialist crony capitalist
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:54.160]  model fit in where they don't care if they're in more people they don't care if things start
[1:38:54.160 --> 1:39:00.000]  imploding because they've decided to go into a system of artificial scarcity where people are poor
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:05.600]  as a social management system i'm sure you're familiar with the un models and clowered and
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:12.960]  piven and that whole school of thought that's why they rationalize creating such economic chaos
[1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:19.280]  is because the establishment for to a great extent is exempt now they're lobbying for 100 trillion
[1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:26.000]  in every decade in new taxes at davos as a wealth transfer from the middle class to pacify
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:32.400]  the poor masses but as we know a lot of the davos crowd ends up getting some of that stimulus money
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:38.880]  for themselves so so how do the crony capitalist feed into all this when it happens even in more
[1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:43.600]  capitalistic countries like us especially this part of the cycle economists talk about money
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:50.560]  supply we look at money velocity the rate at which money is turning over of its own volition
[1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:57.040]  not just the fed creating more of it magically when money supply is going up and above average it
[1:39:57.040 --> 1:40:02.320]  means we're investing in the future we're making investments that pay off with higher wages and
[1:40:02.320 --> 1:40:08.160]  profits and and growth but when it starts to go down it means oh businesses and people are
[1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:13.120]  getting in a speculative mode people are flipping condos or flipping tech stocks businesses are
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:18.240]  borrowing money cheap the courtesy of the government buying back their own stocks exaggerate
[1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:22.720]  earning for share when they're not really growing that much so so you get into this speculation
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:27.360]  when you start doing that bubbles build you're not really making progress it's artificial
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:33.840]  and then these bubbles will burst so so we're we're already crossed that line by our analysis
[1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:38.720]  where we're going into a deflationary mode and and you again you can keep creating more money
[1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:44.880]  but it gets but it gets spent and left and and leverage less and less and less and all it does
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:49.280]  is create bubbles at first so so this is a very very dangerous point we're at in the economy
[1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:53.840]  I understand the lay of the land and and you broke it down very accurately unlike any other I know
[1:40:53.840 --> 1:41:00.320]  but but what I'm getting at here is you've got this other school of thought in the ruling establishment
[1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:06.400]  and it's not unified but it's a dominant group who openly push collectivism socialism and artificial
[1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:12.240]  scarcity and how it's good to be poor for the general public and how we shouldn't want better
[1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:19.440]  lives they're really setting up this austerity is sexy idea as a way of re-engineering the economy
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:27.520]  scientifically to basically make people poor I mean I see that happening well the reason they're
[1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:31.440]  not getting any of the benefits when you get in a speculative economy the people with the money
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:36.560]  and like you say the special interests incorporated these these oligarchs they're the ones that have
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:42.160]  the the money and and the leverage so so the everyday person's real wages have been going down
[1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:50.720]  since 2000 but the profits and and the incomes and wealth going to the top 0.1 percent 1 percent
[1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:56.000]  and 10 percent have skyrocketed as strongly as in the roaring 20 so these speculative economies
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:01.680]  which are a lot of it is when when governments push interest rates and make money free and when
[1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:07.600]  they give out money in all types of ways or print money it causes money to be abused there is no free
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:12.880]  lunch in life because there shouldn't be a free lunch gets abused and we're getting this all around
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:19.200]  the world it can be fake programs to say they're helping the poor most of the foreign aid overseas
[1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:23.840]  into places like Africa has just gone to the warlords and then the tribal leaders the money
[1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:29.040]  there always ends up there because they've got corruption so what I'm seeing is all the gains
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:35.440]  in the economy and especially since 2008 and 9 when we had all this QE has gone to the very top
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:39.680]  echelons it is definitely not going to the average and I totally agree with you that's an absolute
[1:42:39.680 --> 1:42:44.960]  fact and so I think you just pulled it down we're moving towards the warlord economy the conquest
[1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:50.080]  economy away from the free market economy it's always a mix historically nobody's perfect but
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:57.040]  we're moving away from the swiss model into the Congo model undoubtedly and I even see elite
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:01.520]  saying they're going to have armored redoubt cities in sectors we're all going to be in poor
[1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:08.000]  grids they're moving towards a hunger games model consciously almost like they decided it can't be
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:14.320]  fixed anyways so why not just embrace the warlord model where do you see that going well I know it
[1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:19.200]  starts because the rich get richer in any time of innovation and I call it the fall season like the
[1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:23.840]  roaring 20s or in the last decade or two when there's innovations like information technologies
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:28.320]  moving mainstream there's certain people that will move faster will innovate more will be more
[1:43:28.320 --> 1:43:32.880]  entrepreneurial but once that starts happening you get this elite special interest group and
[1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:38.240]  all they really do is keep saying we want more of the same this is working for us and so that's
[1:43:38.240 --> 1:43:43.520]  what's happening it's got motion behind it and the government is responding to special interests
[1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:48.480]  and not the people I mean it's not just free market capitalism is failing it does get too
[1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:54.080]  greedy at times but democracy is failing here because people are not objecting to it and are
[1:43:54.080 --> 1:44:00.400]  letting it happen people have got to say no you know we can't let the economy be rigged and it is
[1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:06.960]  rigged it's rigged in investments it's rigged and by the fed pushing up stock markets but not wages
[1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:12.240]  of course the average person isn't going to benefit and the very rich are going to do better than
[1:44:12.240 --> 1:44:16.800]  ever and you can only go so far until you get a revolution people start chopping off head
[1:44:16.800 --> 1:44:20.800]  that's it and then soros and others are openly saying they want to take
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:26.320]  the revolution that they've helped engineer by by by rigging the economy and screwing everybody
[1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:32.240]  and then use that to engineer a false socialist revolution to bring in even more control that
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:36.880]  the very same cronies are supporting because they're offshore and exempt from it and want to work
[1:44:36.880 --> 1:44:42.400]  with a more centralized government so and that's more of a something for nothing economy than work
[1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:47.760]  what happens if these bubbles burst then the then the cost of education is going to plummet
[1:44:47.760 --> 1:44:52.560]  in health care a lot of things and the rich aren't going to have this financial advantage from owning
[1:44:52.560 --> 1:44:57.600]  highly appreciated assets when not not having to work it will shift the balance back to the
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:02.080]  everyday person this is exactly what happened the great depression it was a great reset we had
[1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:07.760]  bubbles back there in the 20s it got extreme rich versus everyday people when the bubbles burst
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:13.600]  yes it hurt the everyday person at first but from then on the everyday person's income and wealth
[1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:19.760]  grew faster than the richest so we need this reset it is false to say oh we can take this bubble
[1:45:19.760 --> 1:45:23.840]  economy and now engineer it for the everyday person no this is definitely being engineered
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:29.200]  against the everyday person and I mean I think the establishment has not been reading history books

[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:39.440]  lasts I just did a big issue in my newsletter on this incoming quality when he gets to these

[1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:46.960]  in North Carolina thanks for holding her on the air hello gentlemen go ahead um
[1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:53.600]  your watchers have limited time and information due researching I've kind of stumbled on some
[1:46:53.600 --> 1:46:58.560]  information that I just wanted to verify with you guys that it's kind of sure brother go ahead
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:05.360]  and ask your question basically what it has to do with is is um Goldman Sachs they had an article
[1:47:05.360 --> 1:47:13.600]  they posted back in 2007 2008 on their website called bricks beyond we gave $10 billion in
[1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:20.720]  bailout money to Goldman Sachs um there's a lot more than $10 billion worth but yeah billion
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:27.120]  10 billion there's a lot more than 10 billion it was it okay I just like I said limited time
[1:47:27.120 --> 1:47:34.400]  research is what we have um but what I'm getting to is that kind of threw a cog in in my spokes
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:40.640]  because the IMF versus the bricks uh the petrodollar things that are going on um
[1:47:42.480 --> 1:47:48.720]  to find out that Goldman Sachs that we bailed out is heading up and constructing the bricks is what
[1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:54.400]  this document states yeah they're heavily involved uh it's trilateral commission they're building three
[1:47:54.400 --> 1:48:00.000]  giant global corporate super governments and transferring national sovereignty into those
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:04.800]  senator goldwater leaked it all back when they were first proposing it and so when they claimed
[1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:10.640]  that the federal reserve system is in competition with the bricks it's total theater uh at least
[1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:15.040]  at one level the russians and chinese are wanting to move to bricks thinking it's their alternative
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:20.800]  but it's it's part of the same uh larger structure in my view but that's a really great question
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:27.280]  hundreds of billions since 2008 uh have been given to mainly foreign banks out of the banker
[1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:32.560]  bailout package mr dent your comment on that statement yeah and more than that you know just
[1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:38.640]  the us alone three and a half trillion and three money printing this goes this they buy these bonds
[1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:43.120]  inject new money into the financial system if they'd have given this three and a half trillion
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:47.440]  to households we could have sent thirty thousand dollars per household do you think don't you think
[1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:51.280]  people would rather have that this has all gone into a financial institution it's been more like
[1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:58.000]  10 11 trillion worldwide so yes there's bailout money there's special interest money but but this
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:04.960]  broad qe is just creating money that goes into financial institution and turns into a gambling
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:10.880]  casino Goldman Sachs makes most of their money not an investment banking anymore and these brokerage
[1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:16.000]  firms don't do it as much on brokerage or banks on banking they're speculating on markets that are
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:21.280]  rigged where they can leverage up borrow money for nothing leverage up and make high profits
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:25.760]  on low risk investments until the bubble's birth and then they all go down and then they're all
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:30.320]  going to be wanting bailouts again sure the Goldman Sachs is the last person anybody should
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:36.160]  give a bailout they do just fine on their own greed thank you so much steve we got a jump jerry
[1:49:36.160 --> 1:49:43.280]  in west virginia go ahead alex thank you for taking my call i'm calling for the closure of the
[1:49:43.280 --> 1:49:50.080]  united nations uh in new york it is the biggest joke and the waste of money it appears to be
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:55.280]  doing nothing never did anything and it just uh well it's trying to you start u.s sovereignty so
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:49:59.920]  it i mean it does do something it basically is a criminal organization make your difference i don't
[1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:06.480]  think it does anything but i think with the collapse of the u.s the only outlet we have is to start a
[1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:12.960]  war with ukraine to get everybody taken away from the realities of the war just like sports do
[1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:20.640]  and thirdly i would like to see everybody out the politicians and out their foibles and out their
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:26.720]  roundabout ideas and then begin to really put the pressure on the politicians that they fess
[1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:32.640]  up to their faults and that may be a way of getting back at uh some of the revenge we need
[1:50:32.640 --> 1:50:38.640]  to do at the moment i'm 73 and i'm worried about the future of social no i hear you brother i hear

[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:23.440]  three or four more calls in this segment and a few more in the next segment then I'm going to
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:28.240]  shift gears into all the world news and breaking news we haven't gotten to yet for me this is what
[1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:33.280]  the world boils down to you've got government by conquest government by liberty innovation free
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:40.240]  market freedom and again you're always somewhere in that spectrum but you have a lot of special
[1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:44.480]  interests that want the command and control controlled markets where they use the government
[1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:48.960]  to set up an economic system where the old robber barons are in control and nobody else is
[1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:54.320]  and that's where we're going and then they're scapegoating capitalism that brought us here
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:02.160]  even partial capitalism as the problem and saying socialism and communism and collectivism
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:06.800]  is the answer when it's a nightmare and if you look at what they've done all over the world
[1:55:06.800 --> 1:55:10.800]  they get you addicted to these pension funds public and private then they loot them then they
[1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:15.120]  take them and now they're announcing they want to take over and tax education funds
[1:55:15.920 --> 1:55:21.440]  they want to start taking you know to quote protect them so I don't think the stock market
[1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:27.200]  safe I don't think 401ks are safe and I've always said this because I've seen the very same globalist
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:33.120]  steal these things by increment all over the world now maybe Harry Dent has something else
[1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:39.280]  to say about this but what's your view well again we see this extreme income inequality
[1:55:39.280 --> 1:55:43.680]  is always a sign that's what's happened the oligarchs like you say every business people
[1:55:43.680 --> 1:55:49.040]  say they love the free market system they do not they always want a monopoly or a government
[1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:54.160]  favored position they get them so that special interest just should not be allowed the lobby
[1:55:54.160 --> 1:56:00.000]  period that'd be my first rule for free market capitalism capitalism does work the best no
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:05.040]  socialist or communist existing system has done well in the past or for long but the free market
[1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:11.280]  capitalist system does need some simple rules and regulations so that these oligarchs don't take over
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:17.840]  and they have totally 100 taken over here I mean in in Europe US but but even more so here special
[1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:23.040]  interests have taken over I want to go back to calls what happens though to social security
[1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:27.840]  what do you think about its future well they're going to have to restructure that in a lot of
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:32.720]  ways there's 67 trillion dollars in unfunded entitlements that's more than our total government
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:38.000]  and private debt at 60 trillion a day which is way more than people think so I count about 129
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:43.360]  trillion all unfunded entitlements like a company that promised pension or health care more than 70
[1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:49.520]  towns I was reading years ago in the LA Times in California where the average bureaucrat is
[1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:54.240]  retiring on half million dollar salaries I mean that is insane where you've got city managers
[1:56:54.240 --> 1:57:02.240]  getting paid $800,000 a year but you know out of that 67 trillion the great majority 80 some percent is
[1:57:02.240 --> 1:57:08.000]  health care entitlements and the rest is social security so social security has no chance of working
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:12.720]  out over time with fewer people and in the fact that governments did not fund all the benefits
[1:57:12.720 --> 1:57:16.880]  they promised they're going to worry about later well health care is way worse than that and it's
[1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:24.240]  the same with corporations a lot of companies have high unfunded entitlement so it's bubbles on
[1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:28.320]  bubbles on bubbles on bubbles Andy in Ohio quick question for Mr. Dan
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:35.200]  hey thanks for taking my call a long time fan first time caller my question is pretty simple
[1:57:35.200 --> 1:57:41.520]  I'm 39 years old I have a family of three wife and a young child what are some things on a small
[1:57:41.520 --> 1:57:47.280]  level that I can do to stay survive and get through multiple self-employed to get through a financial
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:57:52.240]  collapse or to happen this year well you know self-employed you have more flexibility I would
[1:57:52.240 --> 1:57:57.440]  do everything to cut your cost increase your income in your business if you can do some things
[1:57:57.440 --> 1:58:02.480]  part-time outside of your business cash and cash flow or king here but you got to realize what I
[1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:07.120]  tell people is going to be the young people they're going to win when this bubble burst because
[1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:11.680]  the price of education which is the worst thing can happen to younger people and as you age health
[1:58:11.680 --> 1:58:16.160]  care those bubbles are going to burst the cost of a house and mortgage are going to get lower we
[1:58:16.160 --> 1:58:21.840]  got more downside on the housing market just to raise the bubble started in 2000 so things are
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:28.240]  going to go away if you can run for them that's right hardworking people will end up coming out
[1:58:28.240 --> 1:58:33.520]  on top during a depression but hardworking people get screwed during these rigged economies

[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:30.320]  they're gonna give people free college but then if you actually read the fine print you just pay
[2:01:30.320 --> 2:01:35.120]  for it all in the second half i mean we're in such debt and they're like free free free you'll get
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:39.760]  everything free this is insane but what about uh you know his question about student loans and
[2:01:40.320 --> 2:01:44.880]  you know i guess keeping gold hoping later it goes up in values you can then pay off your loans
[2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:50.080]  well first of all student loan thing is is a bubble now there's more back and credit cards
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:55.120]  it's because education costs are in a bubble and people who don't already have rich parents can't
[2:01:55.120 --> 2:01:59.600]  afford to get into college anymore without getting heavily in debt so that's a terrible thing
[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:04.960]  for the future gold is not the solution is this one of the things we have warned and we've been
[2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:10.720]  right about who argue with petership people who agree with us about the debt and and the stimulus
[2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:16.000]  you know being artificial and not sustainable gold is a deed is an inflation hedge in the
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:22.160]  70s it was a great hedge gold does not like deflation when bubbles burst money gets destroyed
[2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:28.640]  well suddenly disappears when stocks are worth you know 4 000 on the dow one day and 20 000
[2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:33.200]  you know previous debt half of the private debt in this country like in the great depression are
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:38.320]  going to be written off that is money that was created out of thin air by banks disappear the
[2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:42.240]  central banks have created money that's going to disappear at some point when when and by the way
[2:02:42.240 --> 2:02:46.480]  harry i don't disagree with you overall but i bought most of my gold at 300 to 500 rounds
[2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:50.320]  and i'm still holding it whether it goes up or down as an emergency backup i don't think it
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:55.120]  should be more than 10 of what people do a small amount a small amount especially because in
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:03:00.480]  certain times i'd rather have silver coins and gold sure more tradable oh yeah i've got more
[2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:05.280]  silver than i've got gold but just expanding on that uh yeah i mean shiff is you know right in
[2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:10.320]  line with your predictions he's made a lot of the summer predictions have been right i'm seeing long
[2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:16.000]  term though uh there's so much volatility i don't think we can say either way you may disagree with
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:23.040]  that but just honing in on gold here for just a moment though um even though the chinese and others
[2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:27.200]  are hoarding it you just still think it's going to be going down because even though we've seen
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:33.280]  other commodities plunging gold's actually gone up some right no no gold was in 1934 and it recently
[2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:39.200]  got to 1150 it's gone down as much as iron ore not quite as much as oil oil oil well i know it's
[2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:43.360]  been going down over all the last few years but it it had been bouncing up a little bit last couple
[2:03:43.360 --> 2:03:48.320]  months well oil's bouncing right now not going to last we've been predicting gold would bounce maybe
[2:03:48.320 --> 2:03:55.040]  up to about 1314 maybe even 1400 but i think it's going down where we've got a number of commodity
[2:03:55.040 --> 2:03:59.280]  charts on our book and it shows when you trade sideways after major surge for number of years
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:04.800]  it's old oil and gold and silver and copper and then break down below that then you're down i mean
[2:04:04.800 --> 2:04:12.480]  we told when oil broke 1525 it was over when oil broke 80 it's over for a long time so gold the last
[2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:17.360]  time it peaked in silver was with the commodity cycle back in 1908 well commodity cycles it peaked
[2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:23.520]  again so we've been warning gold's going to go down more than up and it is the best protection
[2:04:23.520 --> 2:04:28.880]  and then inflationary season like the 70s it is not the best protection and a deflationary
[2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:33.840]  debt deleveraging season like the 30s and that is where i have differed with petership and he's
[2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:37.840]  been wrong and i've been right both he's going down he keeps saying it's going to go to five to
[2:04:37.840 --> 2:04:43.440]  ten thousand i don't think it gets above 1500 all right harry stay there thank you caller that was

[2:08:24.720 --> 2:08:30.400]  staff sergeant joe begs is in studio weathers to break down what's really happening in russia
[2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:35.360]  now here's the story from three months ago back in october russia is more than three months ago
[2:08:35.360 --> 2:08:42.480]  five months ago russia deploying tactical nuclear arms in Crimea nato's tactical nuclear weapons
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:48.320]  must go being moved in up against russia does russia think their new nuclear weapons could win a war
[2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:57.600]  forbs no longer unthinkable should us ready for limited nuclear war breaking out of defense russia
[2:08:57.600 --> 2:09:03.680]  has threatened nuclear attacks as ukraine defense minister newsweek well we saw an explosion that
[2:09:03.680 --> 2:09:09.520]  looks like a nuke and damaged houses 15 miles away i'm not saying it's not a chemical plant
[2:09:10.160 --> 2:09:14.880]  but it's not getting a lot of attention in ukraine and it looks bad and i've grown up in
[2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:19.840]  texas and seen chemical plants blow up and they have multiple explosions afterwards that are just
[2:09:19.840 --> 2:09:27.600]  as bigger bigger so this this this this does not look like anything i've ever seen but a nuke that
[2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:32.720]  doesn't mean that it was a nuke but it's okay to ask that question because we're not getting the
[2:09:32.720 --> 2:09:38.400]  truth out of russia that's coming up right now clef thanks for holding your listing on 90.1 in
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:45.920]  austin go ahead clef you're on the air well sure how are you glad i got you have you ever heard
[2:09:45.920 --> 2:09:52.480]  of the uh shamita by jonathan kahn you know my audio is breaking up a little bit from you
[2:09:52.480 --> 2:09:55.520]  maybe you're clear to dent but i can't really understand you have i ever heard of what
[2:09:57.120 --> 2:10:05.120]  the shamita it's a bit by jonathan kahn i know i haven't tell us about it well he gives the aspect
[2:10:05.120 --> 2:10:10.880]  of everything that's been happening in our world that has allowed it to happen because we haven't
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:17.520]  been following his ways so i would suggest you get the book because it's so a lot about our
[2:10:17.520 --> 2:10:21.360]  country in it and what's going to happen and this is only part of what's been going on
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:28.400]  so it's not allowed that world church center to be bought down because of our arrogance well i do
[2:10:28.400 --> 2:10:33.920]  think that great wealth creates great decadence and arrogance then corruption sets in and i am a
[2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:38.160]  christian um one of my biggest problems is the establishment churches are telling people not
[2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:44.080]  to be politically involved uh and and so america's moral compass seems to be broken let me get mr
[2:10:44.080 --> 2:10:50.320]  dent's take on that yeah no i i just find the same thing i don't comment on religion because
[2:10:50.320 --> 2:10:55.520]  because you know you turn off people or not but but i see the same thing when things get this extreme
[2:10:55.520 --> 2:11:02.320]  and wealth and stuff everything gets corrupted by the special interest that a small group of people
[2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:09.760]  have so much power at every level in religion and politics and business uh that it cannot be
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:16.400]  in the other way that's why we have cycles you know god the universe natural systems never go too
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:20.960]  far in one direction without resetting and going the other direction we can't go up forever without
[2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:25.360]  getting way out of balance and we can't go down and when things go up people think they'll go up
[2:11:25.360 --> 2:11:30.080]  forever and i that's why i talk to people i prove to them otherwise and when things go down people
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:35.280]  think it'll go down forever neither is true these ups and downs correct each other that's why
[2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:43.920]  capitalism works better than top-down planning i just had the crew pop in my head we're actually
[2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:49.520]  going to be interviewing on air next month the author of the book uh that the caller just raised
[2:11:49.520 --> 2:11:56.880]  so thank you caller for calling in uh with that information uh now before we go uh any further
[2:11:56.880 --> 2:12:04.160]  uh with our uh guest uh and and by the way that book is uh all he's also written the book the
[2:12:04.160 --> 2:12:08.480]  harbinger again if you're a radio listener it sounds like i'm bumbling around it's because
[2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:15.200]  they're flashing stuff on screen in live time uh so this is a transmission where we're very
[2:12:15.200 --> 2:12:21.600]  interactive uh and things are unfolding as we go along here uh let's go ahead now and go to
[2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:26.720]  another caller uh let's go ahead and talk to dylan in illinois dylan you're on the air
[2:12:28.960 --> 2:12:34.960]  hi uh yes uh i noticed that uh the oil prices hasn't only affected russia but affected china's
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:43.520]  real estate uh prices to go down and causing slow growth in their economy and the last four months
[2:12:43.520 --> 2:12:49.680]  and expected texas housing boom and uh retail stores are closing and malls are closing
[2:12:49.680 --> 2:12:57.360]  how do you know if a real estate crash is coming from china biggest bubble well i mean you know
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:01.600]  dent's been saying that uh china's going to be the big place to see the bubble probably first
[2:13:01.600 --> 2:13:06.240]  breaking i just saw the chinese government come out revised their numbers last week i saw a lot
[2:13:06.240 --> 2:13:12.240]  of analysts say that clearly now china has crested and is starting to really accelerate a downward
[2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:17.920]  spiral can you elaborate on that harry yeah first of all china i mean china has to be
[2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:22.160]  growing slower than they say because they never tell you the truth there or commodity prices
[2:13:22.160 --> 2:13:27.760]  wouldn't be falling because china is the largest buyer of commodities to feed their export and
[2:13:27.760 --> 2:13:34.400]  industrial machine in the world now by far so so i mean that's one thing yes commodities going down
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:39.200]  and oil is good for the everyday person long term but it is going to cause some huge disruption
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:46.720]  there's six trillion dollars owed in us dollars to banks and bondholders from emerging country
[2:13:46.720 --> 2:13:51.600]  companies who depend on commodity prices and they're going to start defaulting these hackers
[2:13:51.600 --> 2:13:56.160]  who invested a trillion dollars created a million jobs like you say especially in texas
[2:13:56.160 --> 2:14:00.400]  and a whole real estate boom that went much stronger than the last one there that's going
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:06.960]  to implode because these guys are dead they have to have over 80 dollars to really make it long term
[2:14:06.960 --> 2:14:12.800]  and under 55 they really start doing terrible they're not going to reinvest when their wells
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:17.440]  run out they're not going to be able to pay back their debts and you got a half a trillion there so
[2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:24.000]  i actually see this oil collapse as a trigger for the next worldwide debt crisis we have way
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:29.280]  more debt than anybody knows all it takes is a trigger just like the subprime crisis it wasn't
[2:14:29.280 --> 2:14:34.240]  the whole crisis last time it was the trigger they got the markets to start thinking about
[2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:37.680]  debt and worrying about debt and the more they more you look around worry about that you say
[2:14:37.680 --> 2:14:41.520]  holy smokes we got more debt than anybody knows and the whole thing comes down so
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:46.400]  i think this is a very important trigger i've been telling people watch oil to finally bounce
[2:14:46.400 --> 2:14:51.360]  here and boy it's barely bouncing and it really crashed i think oil is going to turn around in
[2:14:51.360 --> 2:14:55.920]  the next few months and go back down to 30 bucks or something like that and then people are going to
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:15:02.000]  have to realize these fractures and a lot of these emerging country exporters are dead and there's
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:07.040]  going to be a lot of debts that aren't going to be paid so you don't think oil is stabilized
[2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:14.800]  you think more volatility is coming well i think it'll be stable we've said for a long time oil
[2:15:14.800 --> 2:15:19.360]  if it broke 80 it's dead which it did it's ultimately going to 10 to 20 dollars in the next
[2:15:19.360 --> 2:15:24.640]  several years but it'll probably vary between 10 dollars and maybe so it still will be volatile
[2:15:24.640 --> 2:15:29.280]  just going down overall yeah it's not just going to go down to stay down but it's going to be between
[2:15:29.280 --> 2:15:35.040]  10 and 70 most oil companies can't make it over 45 traditional ones most fractures can't make it
[2:15:35.040 --> 2:15:40.080]  uh under 55 what did it though i mean it was already glut was going in that direction but the
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:45.840]  Saudis are they just trying to pick the time it starts its descent well the Saudis are playing
[2:15:45.840 --> 2:15:51.520]  like Rockefeller in in in the early 1900s there are the low cost producer with some of the largest
[2:15:51.520 --> 2:15:56.960]  reserves they're they're not cutting their production because they want prices to go down
[2:15:56.960 --> 2:16:02.480]  they want to eliminate their competition so they can be a dominant producer longish arm
[2:16:02.480 --> 2:16:06.480]  they're going to knock out the frackers they're going to knock out the tar sands in Canada
[2:16:06.480 --> 2:16:12.400]  Venezuela and Iran many countries like that are just going to fall by the wayside and never come
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:16.800]  back that means Saudi Arabia is going to have higher prices and more dominant and Venezuela
[2:16:16.800 --> 2:16:22.640]  then will completely implode oh yeah they Venezuela is dead i mean they can't even make it at 100
[2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:27.280]  nevertheless at 55 so that's why their lights aren't on now half the time and they are already
[2:16:27.280 --> 2:16:36.000]  rotting yeah say russia i mean oil is and energy is their largest export sector in their government
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:40.880]  if you imagine they got a communist government that's run everybody off kicked all the entrepreneurs
[2:16:40.880 --> 2:16:46.400]  out and now their oil economy is dead that is going to be a hellhole inside a hellhole
[2:16:47.600 --> 2:16:53.360]  caller thank you so much really great question you know what scares me harry is that i don't think
[2:16:53.360 --> 2:16:59.680]  i've ever historically seen a bubble this big or this prolonged so it looks like when the mega
[2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:05.280]  bubble starts popping it could create a cascade into all these other bubbles and i mean this could
[2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:12.480]  create a road warrior like scenario of collapse if it really goes down and i mean i mean the general
[2:17:12.480 --> 2:17:19.200]  public is is so spoiled on average i expect this to be explosive yeah i did too i mean not only
[2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:23.600]  every bubble in history has gotten greater because our incomes and wealth are greater and then we can
[2:17:23.600 --> 2:17:28.400]  leverage more through debt off that wealth so the bubbles get greater but this has been extended
[2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:34.480]  this bubble should have peaked in 2007 and crashed and never come back instead we had a first bubble
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:41.440]  in 2000 crash a second one in 2007 and now a third one into early 2015 i say and i predict
[2:17:41.440 --> 2:17:46.000]  trying this is the last bubble because the last bubble has been totally artificial the other ones
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:51.760]  had demographic and technology trends behind them they were just exaggerated so this is the last
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:57.520]  bubble just the last bubble when this one ends they all go real estate around the world the last
[2:17:57.520 --> 2:18:03.440]  time okay spain went island went us went before that japan i think all real estate bubbles just
[2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:07.840]  about are going to burst all commodity bubbles and all stock bubbles because because that's what
[2:18:07.840 --> 2:18:13.360]  they've done investors have jumped from one bubble to the next and got but we have record low savings
[2:18:13.360 --> 2:18:18.400]  things record low entrepreneurial spirit record numbers of people on welfare you look at the
[2:18:18.400 --> 2:18:24.800]  equations we have a major depression it is going to be hell on earth yeah but that's what it takes
[2:18:24.800 --> 2:18:30.400]  to get a reset i mean the 30s was the worst time in us history but the crisis really only lasted
[2:18:30.400 --> 2:18:36.320]  three years the whole system reset itself and then we started to grow again all this stuff about
[2:18:36.880 --> 2:18:41.600]  roosevelt you know building all this stuff pulling us out that was not the real thing the system
[2:18:41.600 --> 2:18:47.600]  went through a huge reset huge debt deleveraging the cost of living went down and then things
[2:18:47.600 --> 2:18:54.800]  turned around and it was led by the middle class wasn't led by a bunch of special interest that's
[2:18:54.800 --> 2:18:59.360]  well known but they try to hide that fact well we're in for it i got other callers here but you

[2:24:18.400 --> 2:24:24.960]  if there was a tactical nuclear weapon used as a warning to the west by the russians or somebody
[2:24:24.960 --> 2:24:30.800]  else in ukraine we would not be told about it on the news and just so you know nuclear weapons
[2:24:30.800 --> 2:24:36.640]  have been used in war before there's a lot of evidence they were used in korea smaller ones
[2:24:37.760 --> 2:24:45.600]  and that of course the head of the military at that time in the pacific operations macArthur was
[2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:56.560]  relieved of command because he was about to call in larger attacks the nazis used some atomic weapons
[2:24:56.560 --> 2:25:01.600]  on the eastern front but they were small weren't high yield and then that's actually in mainline
[2:25:01.600 --> 2:25:08.400]  history it's just the official story of fat boy and little boy and harashima and nagasaki were
[2:25:08.400 --> 2:25:12.720]  told is the first time they were used and quite frankly that's just not the case well it's the
[2:25:12.720 --> 2:25:17.360]  first time they were used in war but not the last and i've seen a bunch of articles in popular
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:22.560]  mechanics you name it the last 10 years about you know nukes are safe we can start using smaller ones
[2:25:22.560 --> 2:25:29.440]  in war as bunker busters and the rest of it the russians have said if western armors brought
[2:25:29.440 --> 2:25:34.800]  anywhere into eastern ukraine uh they will use tactical nuclear weapons on it and i've got those
[2:25:34.800 --> 2:25:38.960]  mainstream new articles in front of me we're going to be talking about that and repeating it all
[2:25:38.960 --> 2:25:45.040]  with joe biggs coming up in the next segment but right now let's go ahead and talk to sheth in
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:51.360]  kentucky sheth thanks for holding sorry he couldn't talk to dent he had to go yes uh can you hear me
[2:25:51.360 --> 2:25:58.960]  yes sir i can okay well i would just want to call uh because uh you know i got to think about some
[2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:05.600]  things i'm actually a pretty good fan of you and i listen to you on on occasions uh my granddad passed
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:15.040]  away uh last year august uh in august sorry and base well thank you and basically everything before
[2:26:15.040 --> 2:26:22.000]  he died he basically said look this is going to get worse okay things are not going to get better
[2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:31.600]  because uh you know given given the fact that it's either us or or we're not getting it and i feel
[2:26:31.600 --> 2:26:39.520]  i know this because i feel this as as evangelical christians as myself uh i was reading the bible
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:46.480]  the other day and it talked about uh a great falling away now i looked at that at first and
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:50.960]  when everybody looks at it at first you'll think oh everybody is turning their back on god and
[2:26:50.960 --> 2:26:57.360]  everybody is it's turning to to the world but there's more to it than that i feel evangelical
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:27:04.480]  christians are nowhere to be seen right absolutely because they've been taken over at the highest
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:10.160]  levels by government and they're now part of the clergy response team even a year ago when it even
[2:27:10.160 --> 2:27:16.320]  came out in fox news after we reported it was the the army people leaked it that they were told you
[2:27:16.320 --> 2:27:21.680]  will be court marshaled and the general's letter was put out if you you will be disciplined up the
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:26.720]  point of court marshal if you are evangelical christian and if you attend the churches and give
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:37.600]  them money and if you also are part of the tea party and it's totally illegal but it just shows
[2:27:37.600 --> 2:27:42.960]  they were testing and nobody got in trouble for that i mean that's beyond the soviet union there
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:49.520]  that's like communist china that it's worse and so yes no one stands up 55 million babies i mean
[2:27:49.520 --> 2:27:53.920]  people stand up but they get demonized and so of course nobody's going to have rice of course
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:58.880]  nobody's safe in a world like that i spent much of the first hour breaking that down feminists
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:04.960]  advertise that they had abortions and they say i killed my son and i feel strong now i killed the
[2:28:04.960 --> 2:28:11.840]  male these are sick freaks these people are taking over they mean business and they love death uh and
[2:28:11.840 --> 2:28:16.560]  the christians won't fight them the christians won't stand up against them because it's all
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:21.120]  about political correctness if you're a chicken neck commie or a chicken neck feminist and you
[2:28:21.120 --> 2:28:25.920]  boss people around they get on their knees and beg they go you're the authority cnn said even though
[2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:31.840]  cnn has no viewers there's still this hoax that you do what the scum tells you you follow the
[2:28:31.840 --> 2:28:36.640]  scum's orders because they're scum government and you don't want to be called racist so you support
[2:28:36.640 --> 2:28:40.800]  obama care where you turn your guns in and i say nobody stands up against the truth is people are
[2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:46.240]  mad they see through it uh but still they don't get back in the face of it and say you're a totalitarian
[2:28:46.240 --> 2:28:51.280]  sicko control freak i'm not going to put up with you appreciate your call brother john and tennessee

[2:29:08.640 --> 2:29:14.480]  and i'd be more than happy to talk more about this off the radio but if you ever wonder about the
[2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:22.480]  gizmo detainees that were released and why there was so much confidence as to how they would not uh
[2:29:22.480 --> 2:29:29.760]  be able to uh rejoin the ranks um they had microchips grafted into their spinal cords

[2:33:59.840 --> 2:34:06.800]  did a report from four wars dot com and became the most viral video out there of it unfolding but
[2:34:06.800 --> 2:34:10.400]  we're trying to figure it out all the details of this but it appears to be it was in russian held
[2:34:10.400 --> 2:34:15.440]  areas so they wouldn't blow up their own facility so it wouldn't be the russian sending a message
[2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:23.840]  setting off a nuke but i'm telling you that is a that is a atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb signature
[2:34:23.840 --> 2:34:30.640]  that's exactly what they look like that's not what fuel looks like when it expands and and
[2:34:30.640 --> 2:34:36.160]  blows up i mean there's only one thing that moves like that it's it's atomics this is this is very
[2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:43.120]  very suspicious we don't know what happened we're investigating just like missing nuclear weapons
[2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:47.760]  at dais i mean that was confirmed you notice all the freaking out the media the days after
[2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:53.280]  saying missing nukes east coast to be blown up but not connecting it to dais so i don't know the
[2:34:53.280 --> 2:34:57.840]  the inside baseball what's happening i just know this doesn't look good so we're going to be breaking
[2:34:57.840 --> 2:35:04.320]  that down with joe begs uh who's been uh reporting on it since sunday uh here before we go any further
[2:35:04.320 --> 2:35:10.560]  though finishing up with john in tennessee uh john you're saying that you have first-hand knowledge
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:16.880]  that the tainese are being um given high-tech microchips so they can be tracked when they're
[2:35:16.880 --> 2:35:23.200]  let out of gitmo is that what you're saying yeah mr jones it's actually a program that started
[2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:30.320]  off uh being used on uh our troops ourselves oh i know terribly uh being young and dumb and
[2:35:30.320 --> 2:35:35.520]  signing paperwork and thinking that you're going to do something that's special such as myself uh
[2:35:35.520 --> 2:35:40.800]  i served on a chemical ordinance biological radiological response team and you sign up for
[2:35:40.800 --> 2:35:46.960]  these things thinking that it's going to help you the chips that you're talking about completely
[2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:52.400]  small small small going nano to the point that which they don't even have to be embedded into
[2:35:52.400 --> 2:35:58.960]  the spine anymore and one way that uh you know there's conspiracy after conspiracy you can make
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:03.360]  all kinds of sure they're putting them in the vaccines and in fact outside grips have gone
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:09.120]  and blown it up but one thing that they are doing that people don't realize because there are so many
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:16.080]  conspiracies is not everyone and not everybody needs to have one so what they've done is they've
[2:36:16.080 --> 2:36:22.160]  created this grid and if you and your family say you were to go into a bunker and there's five of you
[2:36:22.160 --> 2:36:27.280]  only one of you have to have had one of those embedded and they're able to associate that
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:33.200]  group that's together and use that as a trackable uh commodity if you will well i know i have a
[2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:38.800]  family member who's been in the army 32 years now and he got all the special authorizations
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:42.480]  to stay in even longer because they have a shortage of troops he'll let them basically stay in until
[2:36:42.480 --> 2:36:48.080]  they're 60 years old and he said that this is about seven eight years ago they were they were
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:52.560]  getting the chips and then he got real mad when i talked about it didn't say his name
[2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:58.160]  but they figured it out uh and so yeah they were getting chips then and people make jokes about it
[2:36:58.160 --> 2:37:02.000]  when they hear this on air no no folks they're giving special personnel chips they're giving
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:08.480]  officers chips they're giving high level uh people that are in secretive operations chips
[2:37:08.480 --> 2:37:13.280]  joe biggs is here joe did you ever hear anything about troops getting chips you always hear rumors
[2:37:13.280 --> 2:37:19.360]  about it but you know when they line you up like cattle into a room and start injecting you with stuff
[2:37:19.360 --> 2:37:23.280]  you have no idea what they're putting in there and some of those needles are so big it's possible
[2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:27.680]  that they could do something like that and that's a lot of things that you would hear rumors about
[2:37:27.680 --> 2:37:32.400]  within the ranks of the military but at this point in time i mean you know we've we've heard
[2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:37.360]  that it's happened but i mean hopefully i don't have one of me well it's not rumors with my family
[2:37:37.360 --> 2:37:42.720]  i mean it happened i mean this is going on this has been going on for a while sir specifically
[2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:47.760]  though you were in a in a group um because i know they have ordnance disposal domestically that they've
[2:37:47.760 --> 2:37:52.480]  used as the umbrella takeover because it sounds legitimate um but but i mean you specifically
[2:37:52.480 --> 2:37:59.360]  they told you we're giving you a nano tracker chip uh what they told us was because of our
[2:37:59.360 --> 2:38:04.880]  response fee was uh you would step up to a line and stand it on the ground and you'd roll they'd
[2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:10.080]  roll your shoulders are rolled up they would tell you to stay still um and there was this big thing
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:16.320]  that would come down and it would jump right into your shoulder and inside those uh shots you were
[2:38:16.320 --> 2:38:21.040]  told okay you know this is going to help with sarin this is going to help with vx this is going to
[2:38:21.040 --> 2:38:25.520]  you know help with all these different things and one of the things that you signed up for was
[2:38:25.520 --> 2:38:30.720]  you know in the event that anything were to ever happen this will allow us the ability to extract
[2:38:30.720 --> 2:38:35.360]  you to get you what you need whenever you need basically cutting down on you they'll still have
[2:38:35.360 --> 2:38:41.040]  all of your allergies uh all of your family contacts so in the event of emergency you know
[2:38:41.040 --> 2:38:46.000]  we're not looking and scouting for everything so but i mean do they point blank say we're putting
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:53.600]  a chip in you uh yeah yeah it was uh they didn't call it a chip uh at that time that's exactly
[2:38:53.600 --> 2:38:58.160]  what they tell them they'll go that they go this this technology will allow us to extract you and
[2:38:58.160 --> 2:39:01.840]  have your whole medical history on it you no longer have dog tags you have this they don't
[2:39:01.840 --> 2:39:09.120]  it it it was an interior barcode if you will but you know looking back on it with my age now
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:14.240]  and seeing how things have come out it's a whole different thing there there was way more to it
[2:39:14.240 --> 2:39:19.040]  than than what it was now you know now now were you told specifically they were putting it into
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:24.240]  the spinal cord of the get more people because that's what i was told yeah you know we were not
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:31.280]  told that it was uh administered to the spinal cord we it is placed uh typically within uh
[2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:36.800]  a part of the body in which it would take uh you have to have surgical intervention done
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:42.640]  on a massive level this isn't something you could just have cut out of your arm um no no they stick
[2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:48.960]  it in next to the nerve in the spinal cord uh unbelievable and you risk you risk some serious
[2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:53.920]  stuff trying to go after something that you don't know exactly where it is well i hope listeners
[2:39:53.920 --> 2:39:57.840]  know that i've never even gone public with the information about get my we know i was told this
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:02.240]  by a high level source just because it's too unbelievable but the caller is calling in you
[2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:06.720]  know breaking down uh what happened to him and i have my cousin who was uh told they were getting
[2:40:06.720 --> 2:40:11.040]  chips i guess six seven years ago just about eight years ago now time flies and then he wouldn't
[2:40:11.040 --> 2:40:17.440]  discuss it after that said it was classified very very interesting all right well thank you so much
[2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:22.320]  anything else you can add for the viewers or listeners the only thing i would say is when it
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:30.000]  comes to anything that's told to you uh please just think very very quickly but very very slowly
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:36.080]  is this something that i really need is that you know that we've survived so long without all of these
[2:40:36.640 --> 2:40:41.920]  these uh vaccinations and these things are supposed to make us better i can tell you firsthand
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:48.960]  there are there are reasons that you don't know of of why things are coming up and being put into
[2:40:48.960 --> 2:40:54.160]  your body well let me ask you this i i've talked about the military being the most awake group
[2:40:54.160 --> 2:40:57.760]  i mean not the new recruits but seasoned people just because they're in the middle of it they're
[2:40:57.760 --> 2:41:02.080]  decompartmentalized the police then or another group that statistically is very awake doesn't
[2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:05.840]  mean they're not doing terrible things on average sometimes but the fact is they are easier to wake
[2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:10.720]  up because they're not in total all all land like the general public uh so i just state it like i see
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:16.640]  it what can you say about your colleagues former colleagues in the military are they waking up or
[2:41:16.640 --> 2:41:22.400]  or uh do you do you concur with with what i've personally seen or have you seen something different
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:29.040]  um i'll say this i think uh you know there's a lot of guys out there that would agree there's a
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:35.040]  lot of guys that are scared to death uh there are families there's the three percenter there's the
[2:41:35.040 --> 2:41:41.120]  oath keepers uh and then there's just groups of guys that have you know their own mythology you
[2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:47.360]  will or different hand signals or whatever that you know you kind of you're you're taught to learn
[2:41:47.360 --> 2:41:52.960]  those things for when you are in places where you shouldn't be um and you know how to kind of
[2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:58.400]  create secondary forms of that um so you're saying there's like basically secret languages in the
[2:41:58.400 --> 2:42:05.120]  military that that people aren't going along with us know what's happening in and my specific unit
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:12.400]  where we responded we were basically stamped and taught and treated trained for chemical biological
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:18.400]  radiological and ordinate response team is what we were sometimes in the army is referred to as a
[2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:25.920]  speedbrained team uh in the Marine Corps we were not classified or given a specific name uh we had
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:33.600]  a secondary form of language uh that was not anything extravagant or or difficult to learn
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:38.640]  but in the event that we needed to communicate because we could not use our voice or we were
[2:42:38.640 --> 2:42:43.200]  somewhere where things need to be communicated to keep people from freaking out or to keep
[2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:49.360]  someone from knowing what we know yes there was a secondary very simplex form of communication
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:55.440]  that was taught amongst our group sure all right well listen thank you so much for the call we're
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:42:59.760]  going to have to call this little snippet of video uh marine tell story of being microchipped
[2:42:59.760 --> 2:43:04.240]  and i mean i know that's true but i should ask you how long ago it happened because it started
[2:43:04.240 --> 2:43:10.320]  about i guess about eight years ago in the army and um my cousin got called in with about 400 um
[2:43:11.360 --> 2:43:15.840]  at a military base in texas and they told him this is classified but there is a program some of
[2:43:15.840 --> 2:43:19.920]  you will be selected to get an implantable chip so we can extract you wherever you're at i'll have
[2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:24.480]  your whole history on it and they said you will you but they said chip flat out you will be getting
[2:43:24.480 --> 2:43:31.200]  a microchip uh and it will be put somewhere where the enemy can't find it and uh he wouldn't tell me
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:36.880]  where it was i know on the get mode it's in the spine is that not incredible joe that's crazy yeah
[2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:41.040]  i mean i wouldn't doubt especially when you're high up your your special ops kind of guys
[2:43:41.040 --> 2:43:44.320]  they're going to be out there deep in the field undercover it would make sense that that'd be
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:47.920]  something they would try sure all of this stuff makes sense except it's the globalist during
[2:43:47.920 --> 2:43:53.200]  control yeah that's i mean can you imagine yeah like samsung came out yesterday and said yes
[2:43:53.200 --> 2:43:56.960]  we are recording you and listening to you and we've been saying it forever and people mock us
[2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:02.560]  and say you know we're we're crazy and now it's out in mainstream media all right i want to shift
[2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:08.560]  gears let's come back in with that intro that you guys had uh coming in by satellite uh down on
[2:44:09.360 --> 2:44:15.120]  ukraine currently we got this shot just about 30 minutes ago uh from google and this is a shot
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:22.720]  bringing us into ukraine and then we will break down what's happening there probably even there's
[2:44:22.720 --> 2:44:33.120]  some overdrive here with joe biggs truly over the top okay this is donask ukraine uh joe biggs
[2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:38.560]  give me your first approximation and take on this and then i'll go over it rush to deploying tactical
[2:44:38.560 --> 2:44:44.560]  new arms to kramia that's from october last year bill dirts high level sources and that i mean that
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:50.000]  guy's got amazing sources that's washington times nato's tactical nuclear weapons uh again are being
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:55.520]  moved into that area does russia think their new nuclear weapons can win a war that's forbes news
[2:44:55.520 --> 2:45:00.000]  week rush has threatened nuclear attack says ukraine defense minister well yeah they've said
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:05.360]  if you move armor end up against our border we reserve the right to use tactical nukes uh no
[2:45:05.360 --> 2:45:12.960]  longer unthinkable should us ready for limited nuclear war that's uh that's out of defense we have
[2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:19.840]  the military and nato making incredible statements about ready for war with russia top u.s generals
[2:45:19.840 --> 2:45:24.400]  have been making just very hawkish statements we've got analysts saying this is the most dangerous
[2:45:24.400 --> 2:45:29.440]  it's ever been i've seen chemical plants blow up growing up in texas i've seen them on the news
[2:45:29.440 --> 2:45:34.240]  i've seen them in the distance uh when i was visiting family in houston 20 30 miles away
[2:45:34.240 --> 2:45:42.320]  i saw the it doesn't go boom with a perfect white hot flash wave and then stop uh it just
[2:45:42.320 --> 2:45:46.400]  doesn't look like any explosion i've ever seen joe you've seen a lot of explosions and we're going
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:51.520]  to play this footage for tv viewers and radio listeners right now this happens sunday in ukraine
[2:45:51.520 --> 2:45:59.440]  and we'll get your take on it here it is this is the footage of the explosion and again we're
[2:45:59.440 --> 2:46:04.960]  uh and again we're going to give folks the audio of that we're going to queue up the raw footage
[2:46:05.600 --> 2:46:13.040]  uh from sunday and as soon as this came out uh joe um got it off ukraine in television
[2:46:13.600 --> 2:46:19.360]  as soon as this came out and and we were able to play it and and again um this was played
[2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:36.720]  yesterday here it is with audio we've all seen hundreds of clips of what atomic bombs look like
[2:46:38.640 --> 2:46:47.120]  here's the flash shock wave you guys miles away houses miles away we're on fire 15 miles away
[2:46:47.120 --> 2:46:52.960]  and we'll just keep playing that in the background as a loop a few more times joe what's your take
[2:46:52.960 --> 2:46:58.080]  on all this so sunday night i get a message a link sent to me on facebook says you got to check this
[2:46:58.080 --> 2:47:02.320]  out i looked at the video opened it up and i see this explosion i'm like wow what is this i started
[2:47:02.320 --> 2:47:08.240]  digging into it when i found the actual raw link on youtube it had just been put up maybe five to
[2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:12.880]  ten minutes prior only had five views on it i was like all right i've got to get to work we got to
[2:47:12.880 --> 2:47:17.360]  do something with this this is unbelievable you called me and said you know can i do this yeah
[2:47:18.080 --> 2:47:22.560]  and when i got back to the office i i figured i'd i'd check some of the mainstream sites to see if
[2:47:22.560 --> 2:47:27.040]  anybody was talking about this because that's huge that's a giant explosion as a telltale still
[2:47:27.040 --> 2:47:31.280]  they're not reporting on it well you know sunday i guess you know people don't want to interrupt the
[2:47:31.280 --> 2:47:36.000]  grammy's with you know small talk like this with explosions going on in ukraine i mean that's all i
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:42.080]  could find on anything on twitter on facebook on fox cnn vbc whatever it was everybody wanted to
[2:47:42.080 --> 2:47:47.120]  talk about the grammy's nobody was talking about this now they are today you know and did you ever
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:51.680]  see anything in iraq and afghanistan explosions it looked anything like that i've seen something
[2:47:51.680 --> 2:47:57.360]  that looked that big but didn't have a shockwave like that i mean that that that footage it made
[2:47:57.360 --> 2:48:01.440]  my heart thump just watching i was like oh my god i hope that a nuke didn't go off i hope there's not
[2:48:01.440 --> 2:48:05.040]  a lot of people didn't knock the people over that are miles away when it comes through i mean the
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:09.360]  pictures later in that area you could see buildings were just like the windows were busted out there
[2:48:09.360 --> 2:48:13.520]  was like parts of the building that were cracked and things like that so i mean that was a huge
[2:48:13.520 --> 2:48:17.760]  explosion and we looked where's the footage of this place yeah well i mean where's the crater
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:22.560]  where it's not on the news of what happened to this this supposed plant and they're saying a
[2:48:22.560 --> 2:48:28.640]  cigarette did it yeah so i asked the question did a nuke go off in ukraine and a lot of trolls came
[2:48:28.640 --> 2:48:32.960]  out and a lot of people were like oh it's you know it's not a nuke but we have the capability of what's
[2:48:32.960 --> 2:48:38.720]  called a tactical nuclear weapon which is a smaller weapon that will not create as much collateral
[2:48:38.720 --> 2:48:44.240]  damage you know like a strategic nuclear weapon a strategic nuclear weapon pretty much renders anybody
[2:48:46.240 --> 2:48:51.760]  not being able to fight back it demolishes the buildings and all that so this would be
[2:48:51.760 --> 2:48:57.680]  what i thought a smaller and that's what you even said too it could be a tactical nuclear weapon
[2:48:57.680 --> 2:49:00.960]  so i don't see the problem they've got them now that are just fired from mortars the stuff they
[2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:05.840]  had back in the fifties and sixties like the david crockett was a two-man team and it was meant in
[2:49:05.840 --> 2:49:09.200]  eastern europe of the russians poured across an overwhelming force you just hit him with this
[2:49:09.200 --> 2:49:13.680]  the issue is the russians have been threatening to use these in state-run media but but russia
[2:49:13.680 --> 2:49:18.400]  was in control of this area i'm told but then what's the ukrainian government saying well right
[2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:22.080]  now they're saying Kiev has received threats of nuclear retaliation from russia through unofficial
[2:49:22.080 --> 2:49:26.720]  channels if it continues to fight pro-russian separatists and eastern ukraine the ukrainian
[2:49:26.720 --> 2:49:32.560]  minister of defense uh velarity helite and it says the russian side is threatened on several
[2:49:32.560 --> 2:49:36.880]  occasions across the unofficial channels that in the case of continued resistance they are ready
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:43.200]  to use a tactical nuclear weapon against us so we need to just discuss that fact i mean that that's
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:51.200]  a big escalation right there yeah what do you think's going on it seems like someone in ukraine
[2:49:51.200 --> 2:49:58.320]  probably did this and they want to blame it on russia to spark something up it seems a little
[2:49:58.320 --> 2:50:04.560]  odd to me and you've been researching it's clear that this was a russian held plant um well in
[2:50:04.560 --> 2:50:09.600]  dawn test there's a good bit of those people there as well but at this point in time i'm not quite
[2:50:09.600 --> 2:50:13.520]  sure i'm still trying to find out a lot of the stuff's closed down a lot of people i know there's no
[2:50:13.520 --> 2:50:18.080]  media on it yeah i mean you'd think something like this would be a big deal as much as i can and it's
[2:50:18.080 --> 2:50:24.400]  hard to get a lot of uh you know particular what is russia today saying what are the russians saying
[2:50:24.400 --> 2:50:30.560]  well the russians are saying right now that they think that there was an artillery strike that came
[2:50:30.560 --> 2:50:35.520]  in and that's what hit it well then you have the dnr which is the dawn test people's republic
[2:50:35.520 --> 2:50:44.480]  who came out today and just said that they found what was remnants of a toka u which is an actual
[2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:49.920]  piece that uh is a warhead it shoots a warhead that could be chemical nuclear or emp
[2:50:49.920 --> 2:50:56.800]  and that's what they found today and that's a that's a medium range or short range a mobile

[2:53:56.640 --> 2:54:09.920]  Donetsk is a major city in eastern Ukraine in the Crimea region and they've been having major
[2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:17.760]  battles there between the russian separatist and the Ukrainian military and it's clear that
[2:54:17.760 --> 2:54:23.920]  supposedly rebels want to drive the Ukrainian forces out of this area the russians have been
[2:54:23.920 --> 2:54:28.160]  threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons this would be a clear message i'm not saying that's
[2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:33.040]  what it is but there's been so much talk on both sides about this and then you've got McCain
[2:54:33.040 --> 2:54:38.720]  running around saying it's time to have war in the news directly with russia and russia says if
[2:54:38.720 --> 2:54:42.880]  they start fighting us or nato forces directly that they're not going to fight the armor they're
[2:54:42.880 --> 2:54:46.640]  just going to nuke it and then that's how i've said over and over again nuclear war could start
[2:54:46.640 --> 2:54:50.560]  that's what the analysts say they're in the news today analysts you know diplomats saying the most
[2:54:50.560 --> 2:54:57.120]  dangerous thing i've ever seen you use they use attack or the west uses attack a weapon getting
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:55:03.680]  overrun remember during the pristina situation during the kosovo war the russians landed at the
[2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:07.840]  pristina airport and took it over and then they ordered the head of nato to attack the russians
[2:55:07.840 --> 2:55:13.200]  and the head general who's british said i will not start world war three and did and he said the
[2:55:13.200 --> 2:55:17.840]  russians have always had an interest in in this country i'm not doing it well now they may have
[2:55:17.840 --> 2:55:22.640]  generals that are willing to do it and the thing is the russians have said we will launch these
[2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:27.760]  weapons at you so so whether this is a a bomb going off or not i keep saying a bomb because a lot of
[2:55:27.760 --> 2:55:33.600]  these uh tacticals are very primitive it fires like a plutonium bullet into a ball of uh of
[2:55:33.600 --> 2:55:38.400]  uranium those are some of those more simpler weapons and that looks like the atomic bomb blast
[2:55:38.400 --> 2:55:43.280]  i've seen over and over again when you see that first shock of the atoms and that first wave of
[2:55:43.280 --> 2:55:48.480]  golden light that's that's that's not what conventional explosives or chemicals do they
[2:55:48.480 --> 2:55:54.240]  expand slowly compared to uh fissionable material and i'm not a nuclear physicist i've just
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:55:59.760]  studied this it looks bad joe yeah well the thing is is if one person starts using a strategic
[2:55:59.760 --> 2:56:05.040]  new or a uh a tactical nuke and then the other one uses tactical nuke and that leads into
[2:56:05.040 --> 2:56:09.840]  strategical nuke uh you know escalate first they use the little ones and then they go to the bigger
[2:56:09.840 --> 2:56:14.000]  and then they wipe it out and then it gets out of hand and then you've got people not only is russia
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:18.560]  have this uh capability but pakistan has this kind of capability other people around here having
[2:56:18.560 --> 2:56:23.840]  india yeah so it says outside the u.s both establish an emergency uh nuclear powers increasingly
[2:56:23.840 --> 2:56:28.560]  see nuclear weapons as weapons that can be used in a controlled limited and strategically useful
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:32.880]  fashion see and again it's all over the news russia and the u.s keep saying oh it's no big
[2:56:32.880 --> 2:56:37.440]  deal to use nukes now keep going berry was an analyst with the center for strategic and budgetary
[2:56:37.440 --> 2:56:42.960]  assessments says russia has not only developed new relatively low yield tactical nukes but also
[2:56:42.960 --> 2:56:48.400]  routinely war game they're used to stop both nato and chinese conventional forces should
[2:56:48.400 --> 2:56:52.960]  they overrun mass cows feeble post-soviet military and like you said right because they've only got
[2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:57.440]  160 million people and a half million man army compared to china with three or four million
[2:56:57.440 --> 2:57:01.760]  the u.s with a million they're they're saying oh they're betting everything on tactical nicks
[2:57:01.760 --> 2:57:08.000]  yeah and like i said pakistan has developed the tactical nukes to stop india's much larger military
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:13.360]  which also would have a capability as well and iran is seeking this out so you get tactical nukes
[2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:17.520]  being fired that it escalates and everyone's just trying to push the buttons to see who's got the
[2:57:18.080 --> 2:57:23.840]  the bigger cahones to do it and the real weapon is a remote control nuke mines atomic mines
[2:57:23.840 --> 2:57:29.600]  because they'll put those out they have spotters by radio or sat phone now the the tank brigades
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:33.200]  uh come you know come into the area and you just detonate right in the middle of them take
[2:57:33.200 --> 2:57:38.480]  them all out yeah yeah this is just it's not a it's not a good game to play and they're trying
[2:57:38.480 --> 2:57:42.960]  to start something it says russia is moving tactical nuclear weapons systems into recently
[2:57:42.960 --> 2:57:48.160]  annexed Crimea while the obama administration is backing informal talks aim at cutting us
[2:57:48.160 --> 2:57:53.680]  tactical nuclear deployments in europe in europe and that's the washington free be a beacon three
[2:57:53.680 --> 2:57:58.080]  senior house republican leaders wrote to president obama two weeks ago warning that moscow will
[2:57:58.080 --> 2:58:03.200]  deploy nuclear missiles and bombers armed with long-range air launch cruise missiles and to
[2:58:03.200 --> 2:58:08.560]  occupied ukraine territory and they've now been patrolling even the edge of ours guys yeah because
[2:58:08.560 --> 2:58:12.960]  of the provocation because the west is moving its forces up against russia yeah and i'm not
[2:58:12.960 --> 2:58:19.680]  lionizing russia but we're starting it yeah we're starting it and i mean i was about two
[2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:24.560]  months ago that nato general he's a u.s. general i forget his name he gets up in his little air
[2:58:24.560 --> 2:58:29.600]  force that uniform he goes we're ready to take on russia's i mean nobody ever talked like that before
[2:58:29.600 --> 2:58:35.280]  i mean we're ready to have a war no big deal i mean i'm sorry it's not a bunch of iraqis
[2:58:35.280 --> 2:58:39.680]  that we're fighting here folks with ak-47s it's the russians with nuclear weapons war
[2:58:41.360 --> 2:58:47.040]  this is gcn about war with russia communications radio networks the new house of cards stay there
[2:58:47.040 --> 2:58:51.760]  i won't talk about that we're going to overdraft what disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain
[2:58:51.760 --> 2:58:58.480]  of mass pandemics economic meltdowns and violent food riots all at the same time nasa has already
[2:58:58.480 --> 2:59:04.560]  set the countdown timer and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away
[2:59:04.560 --> 2:59:10.320]  former cia director james wilsey says two-thirds of us population could perish in a matter of
[2:59:10.320 --> 2:59:15.440]  seconds the world as we know it will cease to exist the world's economy will be wiped out
[2:59:15.440 --> 2:59:20.800]  mass riots will follow ancient diseases will reemerge how will you shield yourself and your

[3:00:25.840 --> 3:00:29.680]  final segment we're in overdrive sorry the other collars were just out of time
[3:00:29.680 --> 3:00:33.120]  joe i've been ranting here we need to be able to make other points about this and we've got all
[3:00:33.120 --> 3:00:39.520]  the mainstream news articles james weapons quarterly washington times forbs newsweek russia
[3:00:39.520 --> 3:00:44.480]  threatens nuclear attacks i mean this is all going on here the russians are saying and i
[3:00:44.480 --> 3:00:49.920]  don't just believe newsweek when ever the west started a war with russia in georgia in 2008
[3:00:49.920 --> 3:00:54.160]  they rolled nukes in with these medium range and short-range launchers that we're gonna start nuking
[3:00:54.160 --> 3:00:59.680]  you yeah and the nato troops got back on their airplanes and left uh what is nato playing with
[3:00:59.680 --> 3:01:03.280]  here and then let's get into these reports of the wreckage they found of the missile that may have
[3:01:03.280 --> 3:01:08.960]  carried the weapon well it seems like they're ramping the american people up to get ready back
[3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:14.160]  to get that war face on you see the american sniper movies coming out you see the american
[3:01:14.160 --> 3:01:17.920]  public getting back into that yeah yeah you know we're ready to we're ready to fight we're american
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:23.360]  we can do anything you know but for the past few years the way everyone looks at it even americans
[3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:28.160]  are looking at these wars as garbage iraq was a waste of time afghanistan a waste of time all of
[3:01:28.160 --> 3:01:32.960]  this stuff so a lot of people have been on the uh you know the down but now we have all these new
[3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:36.960]  movies coming out the tv shows are talking about war everyone's talking about it's always about russia
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:41.840]  yeah and and you start seeing everybody like i am an american oh yeah and everyone's all pumped up
[3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:45.840]  and all these books are coming out from navy seals and things like that it seems like they're
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:51.600]  trying to use this propaganda to get the american public back in the mind and in books video games
[3:01:51.600 --> 3:01:55.760]  movies house of cards it's all russia the whole new house of cars and about russia
[3:01:56.800 --> 3:02:01.520]  the video game shine is our buddy in house of cards but russia they're they're bad yeah
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:04.640]  it seems like they're trying to ramp up the american people to get them behind
[3:02:04.640 --> 3:02:09.200]  what's going to be coming up and now we see all this stuff starting to happen over there as well
[3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:13.760]  well what frustrates me joe is that russia is actually fighting radical islam and the west
[3:02:13.760 --> 3:02:17.600]  is going to use that against them as well i mean the whole world's really getting up on russia
[3:02:17.600 --> 3:02:22.000]  yeah and i even run to people i know who know and listen to show they go yeah but the russians
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:27.200]  are bad let's kick their butt it's like this mindlessness i'm sorry i mean our own military
[3:02:27.200 --> 3:02:31.600]  got chewed up trying to hold down the country's you were in can you imagine even if russia is in
[3:02:31.600 --> 3:02:36.640]  trouble uh trying to mess with a country that has all these special forces and all these spies and
[3:02:36.640 --> 3:02:41.440]  all these weapons and and and special teams the poison people and i mean i think washington's
[3:02:41.440 --> 3:02:45.120]  biting off more than chew here yeah and i don't think putin someone that's going to be willing
[3:02:45.120 --> 3:02:50.480]  to back down from using something like that to use well they're going to turn lose their spies to
[3:02:50.480 --> 3:02:55.120]  yeah it's going to get really bad joe well hopefully not i hope the people don't buy into
[3:02:55.120 --> 3:02:59.520]  this this this junk that's being fed into the the mainstream media every day and how they're
[3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:03.120]  coming out saying you know if you don't back all this stuff that you're not american you know we
[3:03:03.120 --> 3:03:08.080]  need to take a step back and look at what's really going on and nuclear war it's not just going to
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:11.840]  affect that area it's going to affect the entire planet people need to get off their high horse and
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:17.360]  you know well that's what we've got to check is local radiation meters at local colleges if they're
[3:03:17.360 --> 3:03:22.880]  suddenly not reporting as of yesterday yeah that means that they've shut it down and and we've caught
[3:03:22.880 --> 3:03:27.200]  them doing this before when there's been leaks at power plants we'll get a report and suddenly
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:32.400]  the the meters around it won't be reading it'll say inoperable we need to check into that joe
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:37.440]  and we need to talk to some of our sources in europe and some of the uh agencies that are private
[3:03:37.440 --> 3:03:42.240]  that monitor radiation and see if isotopes associated with atomic weapons because that's
[3:03:42.240 --> 3:03:48.800]  what these frogs are usually atomic uh we most tacticals are not hydrogen and we need to look
[3:03:48.800 --> 3:03:55.040]  into this and see if we have the isotopes from russian or nato atomics yeah what do you think
[3:03:55.040 --> 3:04:01.120]  i agree uh well earlier today too dnr news is the don't test people's republic they came out
[3:04:01.120 --> 3:04:08.960]  saying that they indeed found the shellings they found evidence of the rounds that were being used
[3:04:08.960 --> 3:04:13.680]  but they weren't able to get to it until today yesterday they said that chemical plan area was
[3:04:13.680 --> 3:04:19.680]  continuously uh hit and that's a pro russian group isn't it yes so they're saying they think
[3:04:19.680 --> 3:04:24.320]  so they're saying it's the ukraine is doing yes so they they think that they were trying to continuously
[3:04:24.320 --> 3:04:28.720]  hit that chemical area to destroy any evidence of what the rounds that were being used and like
[3:04:28.720 --> 3:04:36.160]  i said it's what's called the otr-21 tochka which is a scarab uh missile and the warhead can shoot
[3:04:36.160 --> 3:04:41.360]  off a chemical or a hundred kiloton nuclear warhead emp or fragmentation filling but that's
[3:04:41.360 --> 3:04:48.240]  what they are finding out there now as of today or tonight i should say well we're just get everybody
[3:04:48.240 --> 3:04:52.720]  on this let's dig into it try to find out exactly what's happening it may be a chemical explosion
[3:04:52.720 --> 3:04:55.680]  it just looks really suspicious it's just weird though you think though they said there was a
[3:04:55.680 --> 3:04:59.120]  weapons cash in there hold on let's go even farther into overdrive i want you to be able to finish
[3:05:00.640 --> 3:05:06.400]  this alert just came in this special announcement is for business owners and leaders of organizations

[3:05:29.440 --> 3:05:34.640]  000 dollars manufacturers if you need a larger building try 100 by 100 commercial building for
[3:05:34.640 --> 3:05:40.880]  129 000 you can't afford to rent with these prices imagine a 70 by 100 foot church building for under
[3:05:40.880 --> 3:05:47.040]  69 000 with the economy improving and interest rates still at historic lows you can't afford to

[3:08:14.160 --> 3:08:20.160]  here joe biggs is sitting next to me and of course joe i've seen you in some of the rolling
[3:08:20.160 --> 3:08:25.520]  stone articles and esquire articles and stuff when they had embeds with you uh army times you name
[3:08:25.520 --> 3:08:33.280]  it you uh loading and preparing uh the big uh warheads the uh big uh shells five h e the one
[3:08:33.280 --> 3:08:38.480]  five five h e we probably google joe biggs artillery and actually pull up those photos so you know
[3:08:38.480 --> 3:08:43.680]  artillery we were just talking during the break look the russians say they'll use tactical nuclear
[3:08:43.680 --> 3:08:51.440]  weapons it looks like wine you see this orange white hot wave go out and then you see the explosion
[3:08:51.440 --> 3:08:56.960]  and a mushroom cloud when i've seen atomic shut off that's what it sends out i mean i've just never
[3:08:56.960 --> 3:09:03.280]  seen an explosion where it's only one wave of the explosion and it's energy it's it's it's
[3:09:03.280 --> 3:09:09.360]  it's it's it looks like it's atomic in nature uh i mean maybe it's something else maybe i'm wrong
[3:09:09.360 --> 3:09:14.000]  but let's just keep playing that joe you said you've never seen any artillery uh like that or
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:18.720]  any explosion that comes close to that i've fired one one niners one nine or eight and triple seven
[3:09:18.720 --> 3:09:23.920]  altitude howitzers uh you know all kinds of different rounds and caliber rounds which is a
[3:09:23.920 --> 3:09:29.120]  rocket pergelled uh gps assisted uh projectile you know i i fired so many different artillery
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:33.600]  rounds i've never seen an explosion like that that seems like that was something that was detonated
[3:09:33.600 --> 3:09:38.000]  from that spot because you would think from an artillery round hitting like that it would
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:44.320]  hit and then send off fragments and then it would be multiple explosions this is more centralized
[3:09:44.320 --> 3:09:50.480]  in one area and it's one perfect explosion from that area that's why it doesn't resemble anything
[3:09:50.480 --> 3:09:55.920]  like i've ever seen an artillery on a toy and when you watch atomic bombs go off in fact jacobson's
[3:09:55.920 --> 3:09:59.760]  got a bunch of them on tape as i was putting them in a film some of the first atomic test
[3:10:01.360 --> 3:10:07.280]  when when the film footage is up close it it first flashes and then you see the radiation go out
[3:10:07.840 --> 3:10:12.320]  like a bubble or a force field and then the mushroom cloud comes out of that yeah that's what
[3:10:12.320 --> 3:10:17.840]  you see in this footage it's not like it's a gas plant or a chemical plant it blows up and it's like
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:25.040]  a big orange thick black red explosion it's it looks atomic that's i'm telling you it's suspicious
[3:10:25.040 --> 3:10:28.560]  yeah i mean that's why we have to question it that's why we have to do the digging here because
[3:10:28.560 --> 3:10:33.440]  like you said mainstream media isn't really paying attention to this everyone's more obsessed with
[3:10:33.440 --> 3:10:37.840]  the grammy's and what new show's going to come out and better call sol and all these different
[3:10:37.840 --> 3:10:43.360]  programs that are out if it was atomic by the russians or by ukraine it's meant to send a message
[3:10:44.080 --> 3:10:47.600]  obviously they know mainstream won't be told about what do you think the message is if indeed it
[3:10:47.600 --> 3:10:54.560]  was a tactical weapon who would use it well to say hey we're not afraid to use them obviously but
[3:10:55.840 --> 3:11:00.000]  it's just like you said was that's how you would use it first was kind of in the middle of nowhere
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:05.440]  or or or on a strategic location just to say hey well that's why a tactical nuke that's the purpose
[3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:10.720]  of one so there's not all that huge collateral damage to show you the awesome power of what it
[3:11:10.720 --> 3:11:15.840]  is so people can go like oh my god this is mind-blowing but it doesn't send all that damage it's a warning
[3:11:19.280 --> 3:11:23.440]  let's watch that footage one more time if you're a radio listener it's on info wars.com it's in
[3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:29.360]  joe biggs this video give folks a title of your video uh the title of the video was did a nuclear
[3:11:29.360 --> 3:11:36.240]  weapon go off and or was a nuke using new Ukraine it's around 300 000 views right now in the past
[3:11:36.240 --> 3:11:44.640]  day and a half now let's watch this shockwave how many miles is that away if 10 miles from what i was told
[3:11:44.640 --> 3:11:57.600]  let's show this again let's back it up again one more time
[3:12:05.600 --> 3:12:11.760]  man that that looks like an atomic oh no i mean i have you see how there's that pattern first
[3:12:11.760 --> 3:12:18.640]  mm-hmm that i've only seen that with the toms very suspicious it's something we'll definitely
[3:12:18.640 --> 3:12:23.600]  be looking into for uh have you sent this out to any of your army buddies that were uh in the
[3:12:23.600 --> 3:12:27.920]  nuke core we need to get this looked at by experts now i haven't thought about that yeah i can definitely
[3:12:27.920 --> 3:12:32.000]  do that i've i've put it out on facebook and i've had a lot of my military buddies you know
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:36.480]  comment back saying that definitely looks like a nuke to them but uh i'll definitely look into
[3:12:36.480 --> 3:12:42.000]  some of my uh nbc guys nuclear biological chemical guys who are that mos well i know
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:45.520]  Jacobson's back there and he's the one that's got all these nuke clips we even sent off to the
[3:12:45.520 --> 3:12:49.920]  government to get from their archives years ago and i mean we've got a bunch of them where they
[3:12:49.920 --> 3:12:54.800]  detonate them and it's exactly the same deal it's like a red force field yeah in fact do knows what
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:59.600]  i'm talking about i call it the force field uh uh nukes because we use it on tv all the time
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:06.720]  i mean it looks just like that joe i mean it just it's just like you said bubbled out
[3:13:06.720 --> 3:13:12.240]  that's a uranium bomb with a plutonium bullet because i've studied it so much that's what they
[3:13:12.240 --> 3:13:18.080]  look like like a low yield or where it doesn't get the full fission where it doesn't fully detonate
[3:13:18.080 --> 3:13:21.440]  because with these small ones they just can't get them to fully detonate i mean it doesn't you
[3:13:21.440 --> 3:13:27.200]  know achieve maximum explosion for the amount of radioactive stuff they've got because i mean i
[3:13:27.200 --> 3:13:32.240]  guess the larger hydrogen bombs and and then of course they've got all the different ones uh like
[3:13:32.240 --> 3:13:37.600]  the uh systems that are used to just put out radiation uh neutron bombs which they supposedly
[3:13:37.600 --> 3:13:42.640]  killed in 79 that's not true they've got a huge program of neutron bombs just here in the us alone
[3:13:42.640 --> 3:13:49.520]  but the more high tech high yield it was a bunch of jacketed perfectly cut hey alex started to cut
[3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:54.320]  in but uh we're showing footage right now of the crater this is from rob dew okay this is
[3:13:54.320 --> 3:14:00.560]  is that from ukrainian or russian this looks like ukrainian i don't know we don't know how to read it
[3:14:01.280 --> 3:14:07.520]  well that is a big crater i mean there seems to just be this huge blackout and media coverage
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:12.000]  of what's going on over there you know for a while we heard there was only 5 000 casualties now they're
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:17.920]  saying 50 000 of what's going on no one's really talking about this it's being just swept under
[3:14:17.920 --> 3:14:25.600]  the rug here in america that is a giant crater yeah there's no artillery around it's going to be doing
[3:14:25.600 --> 3:14:35.200]  that and all the trees are but i mean where's the plant
[3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:46.240]  i mean that looks like what you see when an a bombs gone off see
[3:14:48.400 --> 3:14:53.280]  well what chemical would there be where's the wreckage if it was a chemical plant that did that
[3:14:53.280 --> 3:14:57.920]  i know i don't see anything in that footage that's like i said it's so hard to get any kind of
[3:14:57.920 --> 3:15:02.640]  information about what's going on over there it seems like there's this media blackout it's hard
[3:15:02.640 --> 3:15:08.240]  to dig to find anything on what's going on well it shows media blackout power because we never said
[3:15:08.240 --> 3:15:11.840]  that there was probably a huge epidemic of Ebola going on here in the united states what we said
[3:15:11.840 --> 3:15:15.920]  we've got medical doctors by name we had them on you know saying they've been ordered to cover it up
[3:15:15.920 --> 3:15:20.880]  and then it came out in like ap and stuff last week just oh yeah in new york and new jersey
[3:15:20.880 --> 3:15:26.080]  they've been ordered to cover it up and they're disappearing people uh i mean that that's news
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:31.200]  in and of itself they can disappear people where are they going or monmouth in new jersey i mean
[3:15:31.200 --> 3:15:35.760]  maybe they don't even have a bowl of the point is why are they disappearing them yeah forbs
[3:15:35.760 --> 3:15:38.560]  said they were at the meeting and they were told to cover up we're talking about how they're doing
[3:15:38.560 --> 3:15:43.360]  that down at the border as well yeah so we don't know it just looks like an atomic bomb to me
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  that just so happens what tax tactical weapons are yep there's nothing wrong with questioning
[3:15:50.640 --> 3:15:57.520]  what's happening and trying to look into what we see and analyze it well if that is the real
[3:15:57.520 --> 3:16:03.600]  crater this is pure bull because there's not even a a of a plant anywhere i mean that that's a field
[3:16:03.600 --> 3:16:07.200]  which is what the russians would do is a warning it's in the middle of a forest
[3:16:09.200 --> 3:16:13.760]  there's a chemical plant was like about two miles away what's funny when you look at google maps of
[3:16:13.760 --> 3:16:18.800]  the area where they're saying the chemical plan is it says closed over it when you scroll over it
[3:16:18.800 --> 3:16:23.760]  over that area on google maps that's all it says over it doesn't say the uh the name of the plant
[3:16:23.760 --> 3:16:30.640]  anymore it just says closed man i smell a rat what do you think is going on something's going on
[3:16:30.640 --> 3:16:34.880]  like i said what with what's happening here in the media hyping people up it's leading to something
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:39.680]  it seems like they're trying to push for another war and just like well john mccain said send us
[3:16:39.680 --> 3:16:44.640]  troops to fight let's go fight the russians that's a wonderful idea that's what he's all about this
[3:16:44.640 --> 3:16:52.640]  guy's a bloodthirsty war monger well what he wants is that money you know the vice president's son
[3:16:52.640 --> 3:16:59.120]  took over the largest gas company in the country well his stake in it is about four billion dollars
[3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:07.520]  if he tries to cash out yeah he just got out of college gotta be a nice job huh yeah that kind of
[3:17:07.520 --> 3:17:12.240]  that young with that kind of money he's gonna go corrupt very quickly talk about nepotism
[3:17:13.600 --> 3:17:18.480]  i mean how does the vice president get away with putting his son in an ownership position
[3:17:18.480 --> 3:17:24.720]  and what was the state-run thing connected to the russians i mean how do you just go here's here's
[3:17:24.720 --> 3:17:33.200]  you know half the gas of ukraine and more to you yeah it's a big uh passing of a torch right there
[3:17:34.160 --> 3:17:38.960]  there it is son of us vp joe biden appointed to board of major ukrainian gas company you read
[3:17:38.960 --> 3:17:43.840]  deeper it's an ownership position just worth unbelievable billions and billions and billions
[3:17:43.840 --> 3:17:52.800]  and billions look at him it's just all a sick joke a totally sick joke joe well we'll continue to
[3:17:52.800 --> 3:17:57.520]  dig into this on the nightly news seven o'clock tonight central anything else joe negative that's it
[3:17:59.120 --> 3:18:04.720]  let's get a hold of some nuclear physicists let's get a hold of some atomic weapons experts
[3:18:06.560 --> 3:18:11.200]  maybe somebody can email us and say here's an example of a gas plant or another plant blowing
[3:18:11.200 --> 3:18:16.480]  up where it looks like this yeah try do some comparing because they'll go boom explode yeah
[3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:20.480]  exactly it would be but it doesn't go and then there's an explosion yeah there would be multiple
[3:18:20.480 --> 3:18:24.560]  that's what an a bomb does is then the explosion that's what i was saying if they hit a weapons
[3:18:24.560 --> 3:18:28.800]  cache if they hit a chemical plant there would be separate explosions within that that's why it
[3:18:28.800 --> 3:18:33.520]  looks like it's a centralized something was placed there to make that go off there was nothing not
[3:18:33.520 --> 3:18:37.040]  fired yeah nothing was fired at it i don't there was such a symmetrical explosion yeah
[3:18:37.040 --> 3:18:42.720]  yeah so definitely need some digging into what about a fuel air bomb
[3:18:45.360 --> 3:18:49.440]  i know that some of those were dropped in afghanistan yeah would they do something like that
[3:18:51.920 --> 3:18:56.960]  possibly guys pull up a fuel air bomb as we end and go to break maybe we can show a fuel
[3:18:56.960 --> 3:19:01.040]  air bomb going up i don't think a fuel air bomb is that big i don't think it'd be that big but it
[3:19:01.040 --> 3:19:06.240]  would be a substantial size but i mean like i said it's not going to send a shock wave 15 miles out
[3:19:06.240 --> 3:19:11.920]  i don't think for those who don't know it it fills up a whole c 130 they drop the back roll it out
[3:19:12.640 --> 3:19:18.640]  then it detonates what about 500 feet off the ground and correct i guess what it's good for
[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:22.960]  is sucking the air out everybody's lungs yep and a half mile down mm-hmm so it sucks all the oxygen
[3:19:22.960 --> 3:19:33.040]  out yep there's a fuel air going off all right land that's not even a very big one all right
[3:19:33.040 --> 3:19:38.800]  joe well thank you good job getting on this because hey it's very fair to ask was an atomic use
[3:19:38.800 --> 3:19:42.480]  because this is a theater where the russians say they'll use them yeah exactly the west says they'll
[3:19:42.480 --> 3:19:47.280]  use them so we need to look at it because it's certainly a wake-up call for people or we need to
[3:19:47.280 --> 3:19:53.600]  know what was at that chemical plant and why there's nothing there now yeah exactly all right joe
[3:19:53.600 --> 3:20:05.440]  bigs thank you so much we're out of time
