[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  from the front lines of the information war it's
[00:29.960 --> 00:50.320]  Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it's Friday June 21st 2019 we just kicked
[00:50.320 --> 00:57.480]  off this worldwide live radio slash TV broadcast to the horror and the discuss
[00:57.480 --> 01:02.760]  to the globalist this is the tip of the spear in the fight for a pro-human
[01:02.760 --> 01:11.960]  future thanks for joining us well my friends where should we start
[01:14.160 --> 01:18.600]  Trump ordered military strike on Iran then backed off hours later the Iranian
[01:18.600 --> 01:24.560]  say that Trump called them to say that we have aircraft on the way we're gonna
[01:24.560 --> 01:29.840]  bomb your missile installations that fired these weapons at our aircraft and
[01:29.840 --> 01:38.960]  then he called right back and said we're not doing it so there you have it
[01:38.960 --> 01:45.520]  ladies and gentlemen that's a big deal and I happen to know the inside
[01:45.520 --> 01:52.200]  baseball of what went on and I'm not at liberty to get into it but I can tell
[01:52.200 --> 02:00.560]  you this everybody better think they're lucky stars for people like Tucker
[02:00.560 --> 02:08.200]  Carlson and the guest he had on last night because the president basically
[02:08.200 --> 02:13.120]  watches Fox News 18 hours a day when he's not out doing public events or
[02:13.120 --> 02:22.160]  reading letters but it did let's just say this it's on in the background and Sean
[02:22.160 --> 02:30.960]  Hannity foaming at the mouth for war turned Trump off and then the way Tucker
[02:30.960 --> 02:35.040]  Carlson handles it and of course Trump calls him you know smartest newsman out
[02:35.040 --> 02:43.440]  there it's pretty much true Carlson is really matured into he was a race or
[02:43.440 --> 02:50.760]  should be a triple crown winner but let me tell you something it's scary to know
[02:50.760 --> 02:55.800]  that somebody I used to make fun of and not like when he was more of a liberal on
[02:55.800 --> 03:04.560]  CNN is the only thing standing between us potentially World War three because
[03:04.560 --> 03:10.120]  when daily beast normally lies a lot got it right a few days ago when they made
[03:10.120 --> 03:15.880]  fun of Tucker and said oh look he's the one keeping Trump from attacking
[03:15.880 --> 03:20.680]  according to people in the White House he had the left allied with the
[03:20.680 --> 03:26.880]  warmongering neocons what a disgusting group of people there's a lot more to
[03:26.880 --> 03:35.600]  this too from my sources that are not Tucker Carlson I'll just leave it at
[03:35.600 --> 03:47.520]  that we'll sleep at that but I do know a lot more than I can tell you and let's
[03:47.520 --> 03:54.720]  just say this it's very dangerous trying to hold up a new big war where
[03:54.720 --> 03:58.720]  globalists will make hundreds of billions of dollars but everybody in
[03:58.720 --> 04:06.400]  Washington knows who's behind this and who's pushing us the neocons Saudi
[04:06.400 --> 04:13.760]  Arabia and Israel and I am not an enemy of Israel I'm glad that there is a
[04:13.760 --> 04:17.960]  country there that has some basic freedoms and things not perfect if the
[04:17.960 --> 04:20.840]  Islamists were given Israel they'd fight over forever like they've always done
[04:20.840 --> 04:28.320]  that said if Israel wants to go to war with Iran they are big boys and they
[04:28.320 --> 04:34.640]  can do it and the same thing goes for Saudi Arabia so I don't want to be a
[04:34.640 --> 04:40.480]  power slave of Israel I don't want to be Israel's attack dog and I don't want
[04:40.480 --> 04:44.560]  World War three now we're gonna get more of this we come back and so much more
[04:44.560 --> 04:48.080]  they have gone into overdrive their disinfo against myself and I'll
[04:48.080 --> 04:52.800]  destroy her they are really trying to see us up to be taken down tweed your
[04:52.800 --> 04:57.360]  prayers ladies and gentlemen wait till you hear all this big broadcast on the
[04:57.360 --> 05:03.680]  Friday edition in the 40 years that I've been in American politics I've never
[05:03.680 --> 05:08.240]  seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and
[05:08.240 --> 05:13.520]  evidence no longer matters the false claim that you purposely said kitty
[05:13.520 --> 05:19.680]  porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false it's a
[05:19.680 --> 05:24.080]  smear somebody sends you something that's encrypted you don't even open it
[05:24.080 --> 05:28.080]  it ends up swept up in the discovery of nine million documents and then it's
[05:28.080 --> 05:33.280]  blamed on you this is Kafka esque this is bizarre but the way the mainstream
[05:33.280 --> 05:38.840]  media rushes out to say Jones said kitty porn it is really outrageous I have a
[05:38.840 --> 05:42.720]  lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and
[05:42.720 --> 05:46.240]  corrected and clarified but I went to where the big boys where's the Wall
[05:46.240 --> 05:50.440]  Street Journal where's Associated Press when are they going to report that they
[05:50.440 --> 05:55.120]  made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate so we both need your
[05:55.120 --> 06:00.600]  help and I urge folks to continue to support info wars with your dollars
[06:00.600 --> 06:16.240]  we've got it waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from
[06:16.240 --> 06:30.680]  the front lines ladies and gentlemen again thank you for joining us on this
[06:30.680 --> 06:38.400]  June 21st 2019 global transmission we'll be here live for the next four hours
[06:38.400 --> 06:41.400]  then I'll be back to Sunday as well four to six p.m. the Sunday
[06:41.400 --> 06:46.800]  transmission I want shroyer I'll knock it out of the park as usual 3 p.m. central
[06:46.800 --> 06:52.560]  as well David night kicking it all off weekday mornings 8 a.m. the David
[06:52.560 --> 06:57.520]  night show syndicated radio TV transmission dominating the internet
[06:57.520 --> 07:04.040]  dominating relaunching Americana 1776 worldwide promoting true populism and
[07:04.040 --> 07:08.920]  Renaissance culture and a pro-human future so we are enemy number one only at
[07:08.920 --> 07:17.280]  Trump to the globalist okay let me tell you what's coming up today dramatic
[07:17.280 --> 07:21.400]  cliffhanger events the Iranians have pledged that if any of their
[07:21.400 --> 07:25.520]  installations get bombed or targeted they're going to fire more than a hundred
[07:25.520 --> 07:33.680]  thousand missiles at Israel and Saudi Arabia then a giant war will kick off
[07:33.680 --> 07:38.920]  that most analysts believe will suck Russia and China into it but at bare
[07:38.920 --> 07:44.480]  minimum in Vladimir Putin's words will be a catastrophe even if it is
[07:44.480 --> 07:53.880]  contained Trump reportedly had decided to have the strikes carried out then
[07:53.880 --> 08:00.840]  hours before the bomb started falling after aircraft had already taken off
[08:00.840 --> 08:04.440]  they were ordered to be pulled back now I don't normally believe mainstream
[08:04.440 --> 08:11.200]  media but now it's been confirmed that indeed that is what happened and the
[08:11.200 --> 08:15.000]  Iranians said that Trump called them up and said look tit for tat you shot down
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.440]  our aircraft we think it's you with these ships we're gonna bomb some of
[08:18.440 --> 08:23.200]  these missile bases you got a couple hours to get people out of them we don't
[08:23.200 --> 08:29.880]  want to kill anybody but it's tit for tat whatever the Iranians said Trump
[08:29.880 --> 08:36.680]  called back minutes later and said now we're not gonna strike it's off and you
[08:36.680 --> 08:42.000]  need to negotiate reportedly Trump told him and the word is he's really having
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.920]  trouble stopping the neocons kicking off a new war now the best way to break this
[08:47.920 --> 08:52.440]  down is to air a Tucker Carlson piece from last night dealing with the
[08:52.440 --> 08:58.760]  warmongers and then we'll dig more into this then coming up border patrol
[08:58.760 --> 09:03.800]  sector facilities at more than double capacity that's what we've got to send
[09:03.800 --> 09:07.640]  a strong message and start deporting people in mash or more will come and
[09:07.640 --> 09:11.240]  then the whole system will completely fail it's already collapsed but it will
[09:11.240 --> 09:19.000]  permanently fail it's like having a tiny blood vessel on your brain leaking and
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.320]  you're sick you can't see you got to have brain surgery but of a big one bust
[09:24.320 --> 09:33.840]  you just die so that's the bottom line ladies and gentlemen and Trump is
[09:33.840 --> 09:38.360]  deporting at a slower rate than Obama because the whole system is completely
[09:38.360 --> 09:41.920]  overwhelmed and everybody they have in the board patrol and ice is at the
[09:41.920 --> 09:45.880]  border trying to stem the flow just there and that's why there's a huge
[09:45.880 --> 09:52.080]  backlog the dam has broken it's gonna take dramatic action to stop it that's
[09:52.080 --> 09:57.640]  all coming up also Polish member of Parliament invites AOC for educational
[09:57.640 --> 10:04.680]  visit to real concentration camps yeah I know it's not a concentration camp when
[10:04.680 --> 10:09.840]  a hundred thousand people every couple weeks or so get caught and you've got
[10:09.840 --> 10:15.360]  to try to screen them I mean what do you think happens anywhere else in the
[10:15.360 --> 10:20.160]  world this is completely normal these people are fleeing hell in many cases
[10:20.160 --> 10:24.200]  many cases a third of the children have been kidnapped and we're trying to check
[10:24.200 --> 10:33.680]  to see who their mommy really is ladies and gentlemen and they're saying no we
[10:33.680 --> 10:39.560]  don't want that what a monstrous evil woman AOC is meanwhile speaking of
[10:39.560 --> 10:44.480]  women three female athletes file federal complaint over transgender
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.480]  competition three high school girls from Connecticut just saying the word
[10:49.480 --> 10:53.000]  girl is hateful because some people don't consider that to be a gender that
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.760]  the left actually teaches that three high school girls from Connecticut have
[10:57.760 --> 11:01.280]  filed a federal discrimination complaint over being forced to race against
[11:01.280 --> 11:06.640]  biological males and track competitions I got a better idea if let's say your
[11:06.640 --> 11:11.120]  daughters were playing softball and you showed up to the softball to play a
[11:11.120 --> 11:16.520]  team and half of more boys you'd say hey I'm taking my girls home that league
[11:16.520 --> 11:21.240]  would just collapse and understand these are public schools but people need to
[11:21.240 --> 11:26.960]  not participate in any of this and then let it be the you know the two
[11:26.960 --> 11:30.560]  transgender boys that have already won the state championship and have
[11:30.560 --> 11:35.920]  genitals male genitals and male bodies and male hearts and male blood let them
[11:35.920 --> 11:42.000]  have their farce but see they want to hijack every institution and so it's
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.200]  men winning all the track men winning all the cycling men winning all of the
[11:48.200 --> 11:52.760]  wrestling and the powerlifting winning everything imagine your daughter is
[11:52.760 --> 12:01.600]  playing rugby and a giant man who couldn't make it in regular rugby is now
[12:01.600 --> 12:08.200]  on the field assaulting her yeah remember the guy that came in and yelled
[12:08.200 --> 12:16.480]  scream ma'am it's ma'am and photos him in prison bench pressing 400 pounds the
[12:16.480 --> 12:27.040]  powerlifter a prisoner who wants to bully people so he wears a pink shirt hey
[12:27.040 --> 12:36.840]  guys we're ready for you it's ma'am I'm a psychotic and I'm going to bully you
[12:36.840 --> 12:46.800]  gotta find the prison photos of that guy shocking now I digress again I had an
[12:46.800 --> 12:50.480]  epiphany about the future I'm gonna talk about that later if I don't forget but
[12:50.480 --> 12:54.360]  it ties into the land where the internet ends from the New York Times we're gonna
[12:54.360 --> 13:00.440]  get into that also we're going to look at some of these new big AI developments
[13:00.440 --> 13:04.440]  and you'd think you never agree with Maxine Waters but I agree with her on
[13:04.440 --> 13:10.240]  one thing she thinks that Facebook's new digital currency is dangerous that's
[13:10.240 --> 13:14.560]  because her husband owns a big bank that she swindles money through on record
[13:14.560 --> 13:19.880]  it's been real illegal but she can do it don't be racist tens of millions of
[13:19.880 --> 13:24.680]  dollars her husband so she gets lots competition against regular banks can't
[13:24.680 --> 13:31.280]  do that no the problem isn't that lady it's that it has blockchain and so
[13:31.280 --> 13:34.120]  everything you ever buy everything you ever do and who it passes to will all
[13:34.120 --> 13:38.880]  be tracked which is perfect for the global social score and social
[13:38.880 --> 13:42.600]  conditioning and social engineering which Facebook admits they're going to do
[13:42.600 --> 13:47.640]  they said watch what you say anywhere not just on Facebook will punish you for
[13:47.640 --> 13:52.120]  off-platform activity oh well that's okay but then they buy up every other tech
[13:52.120 --> 13:57.960]  company along with Google thousands of companies a year and then they have the
[13:57.960 --> 14:01.720]  global currency approved by Goldman Sachs JP Morgan that that means that this
[14:01.720 --> 14:07.080]  is the global currency CIA created Facebook that's on record their life
[14:07.080 --> 14:11.240]  log project ended the day Facebook launched and this is the world
[14:11.240 --> 14:19.960]  government this is the system oh speaking of censorship YouTube was given a
[14:19.960 --> 14:27.040]  list by their boss the system run by George Soros they were given a list of
[14:27.040 --> 14:36.040]  dozens of YouTube sites they're posting in part or my information and they act
[14:36.040 --> 14:41.480]  like that's illegal for you to talk about Alex Jones or for you to post Alex
[14:41.480 --> 14:45.080]  Jones or for you to edit Alex Jones or for you to whatever and so they
[14:45.080 --> 14:51.920]  promptly deleted them all but now on a roll of fraud media matters has listed
[14:51.920 --> 14:57.120]  Caitlin Bennett who's been around for years and does do work for us but it's

[20:08.320 --> 20:19.880]  you big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[20:19.880 --> 20:27.360]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex
[20:27.360 --> 20:41.480]  Jones all right ladies and gentlemen there have been big new developments in
[20:41.480 --> 20:49.400]  whoever attempted to plant child porn on us and the FBI because that multiple
[20:49.400 --> 20:53.680]  conversations with my lawyer norm pattis and they've given us a letter
[20:53.680 --> 20:57.240]  actually did it several days ago I've been so busy we're about to release an
[20:57.240 --> 21:01.160]  article in info wars dot com with Paul Watson we just wanted to also get the
[21:01.160 --> 21:05.040]  authorization to delete it they said yes obviously delete it that's not
[21:05.040 --> 21:09.320]  obstructing because you're the victim not a suspect and we also want to do the
[21:09.320 --> 21:13.200]  procedure to put out the metadata without the metadata that could
[21:13.200 --> 21:17.480]  reconstruct the potentially illegal images because the FBI calls them
[21:17.480 --> 21:22.320]  potentially illegal I've never seen them normally joining us next segment
[21:22.320 --> 21:26.160]  there is a hundred thousand dollar reward I don't have a million dollars
[21:26.160 --> 21:30.560]  plus I put the offer out wrong but I've paid a hundred and fifteen thousand out
[21:30.560 --> 21:35.840]  before for one contest we've paid out close to a million dollars in contest
[21:35.840 --> 21:41.560]  total so there will be a hundred thousand dollars for anyone that gives
[21:41.560 --> 21:45.640]  information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator or perpetrators we're gonna
[21:45.640 --> 21:52.280]  put some leads out and some metadata and email addresses to who did this it
[21:52.280 --> 22:00.560]  was connected to so-called QAnon and it was done right when I criticized QAnon
[22:00.560 --> 22:06.120]  so as I've always been clear I'm not saying that the lawyers for Sandy Hook
[22:06.120 --> 22:10.040]  or the families are the ones that did this the media said that I'm pissed
[22:10.040 --> 22:13.080]  because we spent tons of money going through all the emails that they
[22:13.080 --> 22:19.920]  demanded and that they know you know damn well when they ran to the cops with
[22:19.920 --> 22:24.640]  this reportedly trying to get me indicted for it that that's wrong and
[22:24.640 --> 22:28.120]  that's why I'm pissed and I never made threats to them either I said whoever
[22:28.120 --> 22:31.520]  did this I metaphorically want to see you with your head on the pike I want to
[22:31.520 --> 22:35.600]  see you in prison so I'm sick of the media misrepresenting all that but I'll
[22:35.600 --> 22:38.280]  talk more about it coming up next segment I want to get into the whole
[22:38.280 --> 22:46.880]  situation with Iran and how dangerous all of that is and and the fact that the
[22:46.880 --> 22:56.360]  neocons are still trying to start a war harder than ever and Tucker Carlson has
[22:56.360 --> 23:01.640]  done a great job breaking all that down before I go to that clip though it is
[23:01.640 --> 23:06.640]  essential for folks to understand that this is a battle of wills and the
[23:06.640 --> 23:10.160]  globalists are working around the clock with everything they've got to shut us
[23:10.160 --> 23:14.720]  down but like an arm wrestling contest when you get focused when you spread the
[23:14.720 --> 23:18.160]  word when you pray for us when you buy the products at m4store.com they're
[23:18.160 --> 23:23.920]  already great that you already need it stands in defiance of them and they are
[23:23.920 --> 23:29.000]  beside themselves now they don't know what to do they don't know how to
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.880]  respond and they're unable to shut others down so this is a real battle of
[23:32.880 --> 23:37.080]  wills and Trump says he's preparing to move against them with any trust he's
[23:37.080 --> 23:40.880]  moved against the universities and so is the governor of Texas and their
[23:40.880 --> 23:45.520]  discrimination against conservative and nationalist and Christian views so
[23:45.520 --> 23:50.240]  we're fighting back but this operation really is the tip of the spear the
[23:50.240 --> 23:53.680]  enemy wants to capture the flag they want to capture the standard because they
[23:53.680 --> 23:57.920]  understand that we really have our ear to the ground and know what we're doing
[23:57.920 --> 24:02.200]  and there's very few people out there the president actually listens to but the
[24:02.200 --> 24:08.600]  president gets boiled downs on a daily sometimes weekly basis of things I've
[24:08.600 --> 24:14.240]  said especially when I say this is an emergency message to the president they
[24:14.240 --> 24:18.800]  then get that to him he's he's directed people to do that and he has shown what
[24:18.800 --> 24:23.920]  he calls the clips every day and I am in the clips you were in the clips
[24:23.920 --> 24:28.080]  seriously listeners he scans what everybody's doing particularly Tucker
[24:28.080 --> 24:32.880]  Carlson and info wars and that's why they want us off the air and that's why
[24:32.880 --> 24:35.720]  it's essential that we're running one of the biggest specials ever it's gotta

[25:35.520 --> 25:39.560]  up so thank you I salute you I'm in your hands here's part of Hector Carlson's
[25:39.560 --> 25:44.520]  report the full reports on info wars.com since 9 11 the US has spent
[25:44.520 --> 25:48.800]  trillions of dollars and thousands of American lives trying to remake the
[25:48.800 --> 25:53.760]  Middle East in our image it's sad to say it out loud but we have to it hasn't
[25:53.760 --> 25:57.240]  worked many of us thought it would but it hasn't by every measure our foreign
[25:57.240 --> 26:01.440]  wars have ended in dismal failure for the United States however noble they're
[26:01.440 --> 26:04.760]  intentions and some did have noble intentions Donald Trump was one of the
[26:04.760 --> 26:08.640]  rare Republican politicians honest enough to admit this he said it out loud
[26:08.640 --> 26:12.480]  three years ago and promised not to repeat the same mistakes if elected
[26:12.480 --> 26:16.960]  president and partly because he said that he was elected president now
[26:16.960 --> 26:21.160]  something fascinating is happening the very people in some cases literally the
[26:21.160 --> 26:26.840]  same people who lured us into the Iraq quagmire 16 years ago are demanding a
[26:26.840 --> 26:31.280]  new war this one with Iran the president to his great credit appears to be
[26:31.280 --> 26:36.240]  skeptical of this very skeptical Iran recently downed an unmanned American
[26:36.240 --> 26:40.200]  drone the president speaking today seemed to suggest this shouldn't
[26:40.200 --> 26:46.000]  necessarily trigger a conflict with Iran watch Iran made a big mistake this
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.080]  drone was in international waters clearly we have it all documented I
[26:50.080 --> 26:54.760]  would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting
[26:54.760 --> 27:00.240]  that drone down and fortunately that drone was unarmed it was not there was
[27:00.240 --> 27:05.200]  no man in it and there was no it was just it was over international waters
[27:05.200 --> 27:08.560]  clearly over international waters but we didn't have a man or woman in the drone
[27:08.560 --> 27:12.200]  we had nobody in the drug would have made a big difference let me tell you
[27:12.200 --> 27:15.440]  would have made a big big difference I find it hard to believe it was
[27:15.440 --> 27:18.160]  intentional if you want to know the truth I think that it could have been
[27:18.160 --> 27:25.800]  somebody who was loose and stupid that did it so that's not nearly bellicose
[27:25.800 --> 27:29.480]  enough for the permanent foreign policy establishment in Washington many of whom
[27:29.480 --> 27:34.160]  crave a war with Iran and see every provocation as an opportunity to start
[27:34.160 --> 27:37.640]  one senator Lindsey Graham for example says Americans ought to be ready to
[27:37.640 --> 27:42.440]  fight and die for shipping lanes on the other side of the world watch so here's
[27:42.440 --> 27:47.200]  what to watch for if the Iranians follow through on their threat to start
[27:47.200 --> 27:52.320]  enriching again at higher levels to basically take their enrichment program
[27:52.320 --> 27:57.920]  to a kind of a nuclear level in terms of a weapons grade production Israel's in
[27:57.920 --> 28:01.840]  a world of hurt so the best thing the president can do is stop that and how do
[28:01.840 --> 28:06.480]  you stop that to make Iran understand you're not gonna let that happen I think
[28:06.480 --> 28:10.360]  you should put there or refiners on our target list that it should look at sinking
[28:10.360 --> 28:16.920]  the Iranian Navy at the attack shipping again so in Washington there are no real
[28:16.920 --> 28:21.680]  consequences for being wrong and as a result policymakers are they make the
[28:21.680 --> 28:25.760]  same mistakes again and again and it's certainly not just Lindsey Graham at the
[28:25.760 --> 28:29.880]  New York Times left-wing warmonger Brett Stevens is also calling on America to
[28:29.880 --> 28:34.720]  sink the Iranian Navy many on the left are for it John Bolton cheers him on
[28:34.720 --> 28:38.120]  from within the White House Bill Crystal nods with approval from outside the
[28:38.120 --> 28:42.320]  White House none of these people will admit their actual intentions let's say
[28:42.320 --> 28:46.680]  they don't really want a war with Iran that's a crock they want to war badly
[28:46.680 --> 28:50.400]  badly enough to lie about it that's why they're putting American troops into
[28:50.400 --> 28:55.040]  situations where conflict is inevitable in order to start a war everyone in
[28:55.040 --> 28:59.120]  Washington knows exactly what's happening they've seen it many times before

[32:59.920 --> 33:11.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:29.920 --> 33:42.600]  Ladies and gentlemen coming up in the next hour I'm gonna open the phones up
[33:42.600 --> 33:46.880]  and cover the waterfront of the week's news the latest breaking information and
[33:46.880 --> 33:51.320]  obviously what you think about the Iran situation where the globalists are
[33:51.320 --> 33:55.520]  still gonna try to kick off a war in the next coming days and weeks and months
[33:55.520 --> 34:00.240]  probably sooner rather than later Trump reportedly was going to hit them
[34:00.240 --> 34:04.520]  yesterday retaliation for a drone shot down then he pulled back at the last
[34:04.520 --> 34:08.560]  minute we'll look at every angle of this maybe even try to get Joel Scowles
[34:08.560 --> 34:13.360]  in the pop back in for one segment coming up in the two hours after this
[34:13.360 --> 34:17.520]  one there's a lot of other news with Communist Party calling for more
[34:17.520 --> 34:22.040]  violence in the US getting more people elected we're gonna look more at that we're
[34:22.040 --> 34:27.320]  gonna look at how women are fighting back in sports other places against
[34:27.320 --> 34:31.760]  biological men dominating all the sporting events so people are finally
[34:31.760 --> 34:37.200]  finding their backbone and saying no to this insanity but for the next two
[34:37.200 --> 34:41.920]  segments we have a lot of really big breaking news and I just want to stake
[34:41.920 --> 34:45.200]  this again because I don't like talking about myself every day on the show and
[34:45.200 --> 34:48.320]  what's happening but we're forced to because as you've seen we're national
[34:48.320 --> 34:53.280]  news international news if they can take us down they set the precedent to take
[34:53.280 --> 34:58.040]  everyone else down media matters run by George Soros the admitted Nazi
[34:58.040 --> 35:02.440]  collaborator he said that on 60 minutes the news says that's a conspiracy
[35:02.440 --> 35:10.040]  theory George Soros is media matters and in fact I have another list of those
[35:10.040 --> 35:15.040]  that I believe Daria you just printed can I have that list from yesterday
[35:15.040 --> 35:22.280]  because they've updated their article now and it shows the news sites that they
[35:22.280 --> 35:32.440]  want banned but they create they created a list of sites that post some of my
[35:32.440 --> 35:37.520]  content on YouTube and here it is and most of these I've never even heard of
[35:37.520 --> 35:43.680]  info wars fans grand tyranny crusher heard of that one General Shepard
[35:43.680 --> 35:51.040]  Eric Miller max I mean I've hardly heard of any of these baked blunts info wars
[35:51.040 --> 35:59.160]  that's a EU and they said oh look they're posting his content take them down and
[35:59.160 --> 36:03.800]  YouTube did I mean when when when media matters snaps its fingers and says jump
[36:03.800 --> 36:08.920]  Google a trillion dollar company ask how high oh there were a trillion dollar
[36:08.920 --> 36:11.640]  company they've lost a hundred and thirty something billion since it was
[36:11.640 --> 36:15.200]  announced they're gonna be breaking up the antitrust because their censorship of
[36:15.200 --> 36:19.360]  yours truly trumps single us out specifically my name hope he goes
[36:19.360 --> 36:22.840]  ahead and lets the other shoe drop on that but then today they put out a new
[36:22.840 --> 36:30.240]  report on the same article update to and it says every copycat channel listed
[36:30.240 --> 36:34.840]  has been uploaded in force content has been removed and most now showing a
[36:34.840 --> 36:37.480]  message saying they were terminated for a violation of YouTube's term of service
[36:37.480 --> 36:44.600]  the channels for info wars personalities remain up so other people that we sponsor
[36:44.600 --> 36:47.720]  that are contractors who already had their own channels who wanted to do work
[36:47.720 --> 36:50.760]  with us who go out and do man on the street great work never violate YouTube
[36:50.760 --> 36:57.000]  strict rules Millie Weaver and Caitlyn Bennett they are now targeted for
[36:57.000 --> 37:04.720]  deletion and the bosses of Google over at media matters in DC are very upset
[37:04.720 --> 37:09.240]  Liberty hangout seems to mainly post content from info wars personality
[37:09.240 --> 37:15.040]  Caitlyn Bennett no it's Caitlyn Bennett a journalism graduates site a nice
[37:15.040 --> 37:19.000]  young lady and you don't like her having speech you want to get rid of her
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.760]  Millennial Millie Millie Weaver known her eight years she's been reporting for us
[37:23.760 --> 37:27.600]  often on as a contractor for eight years never gotten in trouble they want her
[37:27.600 --> 37:33.160]  band Harrison Smith does his own reports for info wars was up there pre-ban and
[37:33.160 --> 37:38.720]  of course Paul Joseph Watson he said that YouTube channel eight years eight
[37:38.720 --> 37:43.960]  years never violates all their rules any of it they want him gone because they're
[37:43.960 --> 37:48.880]  copycats of me now it's not just ban Alex Jones it's been anyone that sounds
[37:48.880 --> 37:54.600]  like him anybody that doesn't want all the state championships for track to be
[37:54.600 --> 37:58.560]  won by men running against women anybody that doesn't want war with Iran
[37:58.560 --> 38:04.480]  anybody that's worried about 5g or glyphosate or GMOs or vaccine dangers
[38:04.480 --> 38:08.760]  and liability protection our secret government experimentation or anybody
[38:08.760 --> 38:11.880]  that's worried about collapsing borders or anybody worried about not having jobs
[38:11.880 --> 38:17.160]  and the rust belt you know all the really evil stuff I talk about now the
[38:17.160 --> 38:20.200]  truth is I don't say a lot of bad things they take out a context what I've said
[38:20.200 --> 38:23.440]  and lie about it that's why my lawyer Norm Patis is joining us for the next
[38:23.440 --> 38:27.960]  three segments or what's left of this one and two more next segment we'll get
[38:27.960 --> 38:34.000]  into the United States Department of Justice letter and the reward we have
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.320]  out and then confirming that we're not suspects as they talked to Norm last week
[38:38.320 --> 38:41.680]  and the fact that we're allowed to delete it now because that won't be
[38:41.680 --> 38:45.440]  obstruction because they have copies of it and that they were doing an
[38:45.440 --> 38:49.120]  investigation I'm gonna show you who did it what how they hit it saying it was
[38:49.120 --> 38:55.440]  photos of Rockefeller and things but also putting Sandy Hook in the byline
[38:55.440 --> 39:00.080]  right at the time I was being first sued having Sandy Hook on the byline it
[39:00.080 --> 39:03.760]  went into spam but then later all the Sandy Hook terms get subpoenaed and
[39:03.760 --> 39:08.360]  there it is hidden there and then the other side says we're sending them
[39:08.360 --> 39:14.120]  child porn what a comedy of eras so we'll talk more about that in a moment and
[39:14.120 --> 39:19.120]  and clarify some things but Norm the latest here on this this is just
[39:19.120 --> 39:23.800]  looking about this a few days ago this is now all over the news Alex Jones
[39:23.800 --> 39:28.720]  attacks Sandy Hook family lawyer as a quote little white Jew boy in latest
[39:28.720 --> 39:34.280]  unhinged outburst now it's funny no one could think that from what I said we
[39:34.280 --> 39:40.160]  have the court transcript a government document that says I said white shoe boy
[39:40.160 --> 39:45.280]  not once but twice stereotypical Ivy League student a feminine or immature
[39:45.280 --> 39:50.680]  establishment pretending to mainstream US social power structures I said if you
[39:50.680 --> 39:56.440]  think you establishment white shoe boys are gonna destroy me think again well
[39:56.440 --> 40:02.440]  they just turned that by the magic alchemy of fake news into Jew boy and
[40:02.440 --> 40:08.160]  we'll play that clip coming up but Norm first they said in the AP that I wrote
[40:08.160 --> 40:11.400]  a book called nobody died at Sandy Hook and lost a lawsuit this week not true
[40:11.400 --> 40:17.320]  I've never read the book not in the book I'm told and then now this that I'm
[40:17.320 --> 40:22.800]  calling people Jew boy when I didn't and now just everything else it's open
[40:22.800 --> 40:26.440]  season fake news what do you make of this is a famous constitutional and
[40:26.440 --> 40:31.240]  criminal lawyer I don't have to be a lawyer to make sense of it it's just
[40:31.240 --> 40:35.120]  pure hooey you could be a you could be a half-wit and see it let me tell you
[40:35.120 --> 40:40.000]  something that I don't think you know the court transcript that was submitted
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.160]  to Judge Bellis in Connecticut and that was transcribed by the plaintiffs
[40:45.160 --> 40:49.880]  lawyers had Jew boy in there now in the court transcript rather than shoe boy
[40:49.880 --> 40:54.520]  now I was sitting right next to you on the set last Friday when you spoke I
[40:54.520 --> 41:00.520]  didn't hear Jew boy I heard white shoe boy we had our own transcript done of
[41:00.520 --> 41:05.640]  that proceeding and we hear shoe boy and we didn't tell our court reporter what
[41:05.640 --> 41:09.080]  to write we just said give us a transcript and so there's shoe boy
[41:09.080 --> 41:13.600]  they've got Jew boy but I say white shoe boy all the time I got that term from
[41:13.600 --> 41:19.280]  it's a it's just a little confirmation bias there are people who don't like you
[41:19.280 --> 41:23.200]  they're determined to get you and if you say something they can turn against you
[41:23.200 --> 41:27.880]  they'll turn it twisted even get it wrong if it serves their purposes so you
[41:27.880 --> 41:33.200]  know that that's what was tendered to the court and I'm sure that's what the
[41:33.200 --> 41:37.480]  media is relying upon when they reported it you didn't say it you weren't
[41:37.480 --> 41:42.400]  referring to Maddie it's not a reasonable interpretation of that but it
[41:42.400 --> 41:46.320]  serves political purposes to make you out to be a threatener and to get those
[41:46.320 --> 41:49.760]  headlines and to drive people away from you and as sure as I'm sitting here
[41:49.760 --> 41:54.520]  today in New Haven Connecticut they will use that to try to de-platform you
[41:54.520 --> 41:59.680]  further or to as an example of hate speech and it just wasn't so I told you
[41:59.680 --> 42:03.280]  last week I mean I or maybe it was earlier this week it's been a long week
[42:03.280 --> 42:09.920]  that this experience of what has happened to you in the last seven days is my
[42:09.920 --> 42:15.160]  first personal experience with fake news on a national level and it is stunning
[42:15.160 --> 42:19.640]  to me you know it is stunning to me as an ordinary guy who goes about his
[42:19.640 --> 42:22.680]  business in courts from day-to-day I don't pay as much attention to the news
[42:22.680 --> 42:28.240]  as I should or as I should I should say I hear people talk about fake news but
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.120]  I've never seen it up close and personal and now I have and it stings and it
[42:32.120 --> 42:37.800]  hurts and it makes me angry I can't imagine how it makes you feel well it
[42:37.800 --> 42:41.200]  shows they're desperate and they're upset about nationalism in America waking up
[42:41.200 --> 42:45.200]  but guess what America's not going back to sleep corporate media is all going
[42:45.200 --> 42:51.680]  bankrupt and everyone is exiting the big mega leftist cities the exodus is
[42:51.680 --> 42:55.920]  accelerating people are running from you like the plague we'll be right back with
[42:55.920 --> 43:01.440]  Norm Pattis with the big news in the 40 years that I've been in American
[43:01.440 --> 43:06.280]  politics I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and
[43:06.280 --> 43:12.080]  truth and evidence no longer matters the false claim that you purposely said
[43:12.080 --> 43:18.640]  kitty porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false it's a
[43:18.640 --> 43:23.000]  smear somebody sends you something that's encrypted you don't even open it
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.040]  it ends up swept up in the discovery of nine million documents and then it's
[43:27.040 --> 43:32.240]  blamed on you this is Kafka-esque this is bizarre but the way the mainstream
[43:32.240 --> 43:37.960]  media rushes out to say Jones said kitty porn is really outrageous I've a lot
[43:37.960 --> 43:41.720]  of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and
[43:41.720 --> 43:45.200]  corrected and clarified but I went to where the big boys where's the Wall
[43:45.200 --> 43:49.400]  Street Journal where's Associated Press when are they going to report that they
[43:49.400 --> 43:54.120]  made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate so we both need your

[47:01.880 --> 47:19.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:19.880 --> 47:26.680]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[47:26.680 --> 47:34.440]  listening to Alex Jones very powerful article on info wars.com you were ten
[47:34.440 --> 47:38.800]  minutes from war which could have triggered a world war definitely a
[47:38.800 --> 47:43.080]  huge Middle East war with Israel bombing nuclear facilities after Iran would
[47:43.080 --> 47:47.640]  retaliate by firing over a hundred thousand missiles at them that that's
[47:47.640 --> 47:55.160]  the default a catastrophe Trump called it off ten minutes from war Trump stopped
[47:55.160 --> 48:01.360]  Iran strike after asking how many would die I have confirmed that almost all of
[48:01.360 --> 48:07.160]  his advisors are telling him massive war Trump is saying no and that it's been
[48:07.160 --> 48:11.920]  people like Tucker Carlson that are barely able to talk the president out of
[48:11.920 --> 48:15.200]  it and I'm gonna leave it at that but that's coming up next hour or open the
[48:15.200 --> 48:20.640]  phones up getting back to this ladies and gentlemen I'm not gonna play
[48:20.640 --> 48:25.880]  religious or race cards here on air but everybody knows that I am not anti
[48:25.880 --> 48:29.880]  Semitic and that the left beats people over the head with that they say
[48:29.880 --> 48:35.280]  Trump's anti-Semitic it's just preposterous you know President Trump
[48:35.280 --> 48:41.400]  daughter is married an Orthodox Jew Jared Kushner I didn't even think of it as
[48:41.400 --> 48:46.880]  a big deal that my first wife was was part Jewish her family was pretty much
[48:46.880 --> 48:55.040]  agnostic her dad was you know a Christian and I guess you'd say a not
[48:55.040 --> 48:59.920]  Jewish but when the Nazis learned about that they made it a big deal to say
[48:59.920 --> 49:02.760]  horrible things about my children so I don't think it's very funny when the
[49:02.760 --> 49:06.640]  white supremacists are all over the internet calling my children horrible
[49:06.640 --> 49:11.120]  names to have people then when I clearly said white shoe boy which means an
[49:11.120 --> 49:17.920]  east coast Yale or Harvard white shoe law firm is a term that's heavily used
[49:17.920 --> 49:23.440]  in the northeast by the regular classes against what they see as the
[49:23.440 --> 49:27.120]  establishment and so they knew exactly what they were doing when they did this
[49:27.120 --> 49:32.000]  Alex Jones attacks Sandy Hook family's lawyer as a little white Jew boy plus
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.680]  Maddie the guy I was talking about some of the rant not much of it that's
[49:36.680 --> 49:41.760]  that's an Italian name or a French name and I knew that before I looked it up
[49:41.760 --> 49:45.360]  and I looked up this morning they said Italian or French so it's just wrong at
[49:45.360 --> 49:50.920]  every level and it shows folks that they'll do anything they'll say and do
[49:50.920 --> 49:55.400]  they do not care it's crazy we had our own transcript done when they played the
[49:55.400 --> 50:01.080]  clip in court and the separate stenographer says white shoe boy white
[50:01.080 --> 50:06.720]  shoe boy white shoe law firms so definitely out to get me in more ways than one
[50:06.720 --> 50:10.240]  but the good news is this came in days ago but I've been so busy it just was
[50:10.240 --> 50:15.480]  on you know put the side and Paul Watson's about to publish an article on
[50:15.480 --> 50:24.080]  this info wars.com and news wars.com most people aren't buying the hoax that I
[50:24.080 --> 50:28.240]  sent child porn to Sandy Hook families why would I just jump off a cliff then
[50:28.240 --> 50:34.680]  that's just insane no they wanted 9.6 million emails but you had 57,000 with
[50:34.680 --> 50:38.920]  anything with Sandy Hook term in it or a whole bunch of other terms right at the
[50:38.920 --> 50:43.920]  time I was sued last year I was in a press conference in DC about these suits
[50:43.920 --> 50:50.600]  I've sent turns out two emails with a couple of attachments people saying
[50:50.600 --> 50:54.600]  here's clips of David Rockefeller hoping I'd open the attachments it went to the
[50:54.600 --> 50:59.280]  spam we were publishing all the metadata except for the child porn metadata
[50:59.280 --> 51:03.160]  because you can use that data to re-create it. We've been told go
[51:03.160 --> 51:06.840]  ahead and destroy it by the FBI and so has Patis and it confirms his
[51:06.840 --> 51:12.240]  conversation with him last week in that conversation they said that I was the
[51:12.240 --> 51:16.320]  victim but you saw thousands of headlines and I've had friends and
[51:16.320 --> 51:20.120]  family call just this morning my personal trainer came over to stretch me out
[51:20.120 --> 51:24.520]  and stuff had been over in a few days he said yeah here's my cousin asking
[51:24.520 --> 51:28.160]  if it's true they saw it the headline on the news Alex Jones sent child porn
[51:28.160 --> 51:32.440]  they said if it's true why would he do that that's so destructive yeah no
[51:32.440 --> 51:35.960]  kidding if you hear I jump into a woodchipper don't believe it I was put
[51:35.960 --> 51:42.360]  in it gosh man it's just unbelievable and so going back to Norm Patis and I
[51:42.360 --> 51:46.720]  appreciate him joining us the $100,000 reward is out there a million's too much
[51:46.720 --> 51:49.680]  so I walked that back plus I didn't put the reward out right we've done it
[51:49.680 --> 51:53.360]  officially correctly we're gonna put out the metadata so people can help track
[51:53.360 --> 51:57.360]  this it'll obviously be the ISPs that need to help but we really need to bust
[51:57.360 --> 52:01.560]  this person and their QAnon address that they use we don't know that's really
[52:01.560 --> 52:04.640]  one of the people in QAnon but that's the perfect part about QAnon is it's a
[52:04.640 --> 52:10.360]  perfect intelligence op and so Norm roll through this and talk about this for
[52:10.360 --> 52:14.280]  viewers well let me just backtrack a second if it's alright with you I'm
[52:14.280 --> 52:18.080]  looking at page 28 of the transcript the plaintiff's lawyers in the Sandy Hook
[52:18.080 --> 52:22.200]  case submitted to the court were you were you are quoted as saying he's a white
[52:22.200 --> 52:27.680]  Jew boy that thinks he owns America my copy of the transcript is unsigned so
[52:27.680 --> 52:31.760]  I don't know if they gave a certified copy our copy of the certified transcript
[52:31.760 --> 52:38.000]  which came in after the court hearing or says he's a white shoe boy that thinks
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.520]  he owns America so I don't know you know it just you know is it an innocent
[52:42.520 --> 52:48.800]  mistake I'm not so sure about that why did we hear white shoe boy and why did
[52:48.800 --> 52:53.200]  your adversaries here white Jew boy and why is the copy of the transcript that
[52:53.200 --> 52:59.040]  says white Jew boy unsigned I'd like to know but moving on to the letter the
[52:59.040 --> 53:02.920]  letter confirms a discussion that we had we were promised the letter either last
[53:02.920 --> 53:07.540]  Friday or Monday of this week I believe it only arrived on Tuesday and what the
[53:07.540 --> 53:13.160]  letter says is that these items were retrieved and it gives file names for
[53:13.160 --> 53:18.160]  them and gives us the opportunity to locate them within the databases we
[53:18.160 --> 53:23.000]  maintain on behalf of this litigation but the it's interesting to me what we
[53:23.000 --> 53:28.160]  learned the file paths were bombed four of them and excuse me they all are
[53:28.160 --> 53:32.720]  Lanza backslash Lanza that's a name obviously of the Sandy Hook shooter
[53:32.720 --> 53:39.920]  emails QAnon at onionmail.info and then something called Yimmy's Y-M-M-I-E-S
[53:39.920 --> 53:45.920]  at Yimmy's at Danwin and then there's a number and so forth I don't know who
[53:45.920 --> 53:49.880]  sent these I really don't know if this is going to be enough of a trail to give
[53:49.880 --> 53:55.480]  you the opportunity to locate the senders but it's fake news to suggest
[53:55.480 --> 53:59.720]  that you knew them what these emails contained opened them that knew that
[53:59.720 --> 54:04.400]  they contained explosive and criminally and culpatory material or even that you
[54:04.400 --> 54:09.240]  sent them to anybody I was court ordered to give over emails that we
[54:09.240 --> 54:14.400]  retrieved by using search terms your your computers your data people were
[54:14.400 --> 54:17.880]  exhausted I felt bad when I met some of them I thought I'd been a
[54:17.880 --> 54:21.400]  sadist with them because we pressed them to work around the clock for days
[54:21.400 --> 54:26.680]  using search terms now then in court pleadings the Sandy Hook lawyers said
[54:26.680 --> 54:30.640]  well you know if the defendants had done minimal due diligence they would have
[54:30.640 --> 54:34.400]  spotted these and not sent them those lawyers didn't spot them themselves
[54:34.400 --> 54:39.640]  either they sent their money or their data to a California data processing term
[54:39.640 --> 54:44.200]  which by means of sophisticated data processing was able to sort through the
[54:44.200 --> 54:48.520]  tens of thousands of emails and just happened to find these so you know that
[54:48.520 --> 54:54.360]  the notion that you are somehow at all responsible for these could not be more
[54:54.360 --> 54:58.920]  false and there is not a courtroom or a place where I can go under the oath
[54:58.920 --> 55:05.600]  under oath that I will refuse to go to assert this you did not send me there is
[55:05.600 --> 55:09.280]  not a shred of evidence to suggest you knew that anybody sent them on your
[55:09.280 --> 55:13.200]  behalf there is not a shred of evidence that even the Costco lawyers could
[55:13.200 --> 55:17.160]  figure out what they were they spent whatever it was to have somebody troll
[55:17.160 --> 55:21.080]  through this you didn't spend the hundred thousand dollars that it would
[55:21.080 --> 55:24.400]  have taken for somebody to run through it control through you every bit of
[55:24.400 --> 55:27.920]  metadata because you're the one who's being sued they've made they've
[55:27.920 --> 55:30.720]  invested by the way we've already spent a lot of money just going through the
[55:30.720 --> 55:34.440]  nine million emails and fighting out to turn them all over and I remember when
[55:34.440 --> 55:37.680]  the Costco people were in court asking to have the judge order us to open all
[55:37.680 --> 55:40.960]  attachments you can't even do that under law if you don't know what
[55:40.960 --> 55:44.600]  attachments are I mean we would then go to prison if we would have opened
[55:44.600 --> 55:47.920]  these potentially it's just we need relief from this I need you to go to a
[55:47.920 --> 55:51.400]  special hearing with the judge about who didn't sign the transcript to put the
[55:51.400 --> 55:54.880]  fake thing on the transcript first of all I don't know that maybe that we're
[55:54.880 --> 55:58.400]  just given a copy and the signed copy was filed in court to be honest with you
[55:58.400 --> 56:02.600]  you know I only noticed this this morning as we were preparing for it needs
[56:02.600 --> 56:06.760]  to be fixed can't we have a hearing I don't know if we can have a hearing we're
[56:06.760 --> 56:10.240]  going to be in the state Supreme Court Monday filing papers and we will file
[56:10.240 --> 56:14.680]  a certified transcript with it and we'll make note of this error it's by far
[56:14.680 --> 56:19.480]  it's not an innocent error I mean as an example of how loaded these terms are a
[56:19.480 --> 56:23.960]  press organization contacted me a legal publication about this dispute and about
[56:23.960 --> 56:28.600]  Costco claims that we should have known we sent them to you and I wrote as I
[56:28.600 --> 56:31.800]  typically do when I don't have a lot of time my response rather than answer the
[56:31.800 --> 56:36.000]  phone call and I said unlike Costco off Costco often beater mr. Jones does not
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.440]  weigh his money now I get a pushback that's anti-semitic I said what do you
[56:40.440 --> 56:43.320]  mean it's anti-semitic everybody talks about people who are loaded weighing
[56:43.320 --> 56:47.000]  rather than counting their money well Costco off and beater those could be
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.160]  Jewish names you're talking about money in association with Jewish names and
[56:50.160 --> 56:54.200]  yada yada yada I said I stand by my comments now it's been too busy a week
[56:54.200 --> 56:57.920]  here for me to know whether they've printed it or not but it's pure alchemy
[56:57.920 --> 57:02.640]  they just turn everything into something racial it's it's like AOC
[57:02.640 --> 57:08.160]  saying cauliflower is racist because it's white in an era of identity politics
[57:08.160 --> 57:11.640]  if you have an aggrieved identity you think you own the English language and
[57:11.640 --> 57:15.240]  can tell the rest of us how to use it intentions used to matter but now the
[57:15.240 --> 57:19.040]  hurt feelings of the agreed to do and we're driving ourselves crazy and into
[57:19.040 --> 57:22.320]  the ground with this nonsense stay there I want to come back with it with a
[57:22.320 --> 57:28.560]  clarification took to this Chris Matty individual and the judge and all the
[57:28.560 --> 57:32.320]  rest of this because I didn't say Jubal and everybody knows it and I didn't
[57:32.320 --> 57:35.400]  threaten Matty and everybody knows it and then the media runs around saying it
[57:35.400 --> 57:39.400]  like it's all true so it must be true so I want to make again a very clear
[57:39.400 --> 57:43.600]  clarification like we did on Saturday and like we did on Friday that they
[57:43.600 --> 57:47.440]  ignore I want to make this totally clear because they're representing things
[57:47.440 --> 57:52.360]  that are not correct I just want listeners understand money is what
[57:52.360 --> 57:55.960]  allows us to beat this and stand against this and we're seeing a lot of orders
[57:55.960 --> 58:00.480]  right now with the save info or 50% off but we make only like five ten dollars
[58:00.480 --> 58:03.720]  on higher marked up stuff we're making like two dollars on the toothpaste at
[58:03.720 --> 58:07.800]  that price and we're moving a ton okay but you move a couple hundred thousand
[58:07.800 --> 58:11.000]  dollars or something and you get twenty thousand dollars that doesn't pay for all
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.600]  the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to sell
[58:13.600 --> 58:17.080]  millions and millions and millions of dollars a product I want to expand not
[58:17.080 --> 58:20.760]  contract and for six months we've not just made a standstill the enemy's been
[58:20.760 --> 58:25.000]  winning and I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this I like
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.800]  to be expanding I like to be winning I like to be fighting and we are winning
[58:27.800 --> 58:31.240]  the info war that's why we're so hated but we need to be retreaded we need to
[58:31.240 --> 58:34.560]  be tuned up we need to be fixed up we never have time to get it to dry up we
[58:34.560 --> 58:38.960]  got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us then they're
[58:38.960 --> 58:42.320]  really gonna plant child porn on us then they're gonna kill me or you or
[58:42.320 --> 58:45.560]  anybody else me the Democrats now we're going into a full revolutionary fervor
[58:45.560 --> 58:50.600]  funded by foreign banks in the chai comms so go to infowarstore.com
[58:50.600 --> 58:55.920]  what you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the
[58:55.920 --> 59:03.960]  western world's history this is a digital AI enforced gag order not to say
[59:03.960 --> 59:09.080]  the name Alex Jones or info wars.com
[59:11.640 --> 59:17.160]  this is Nazi Germany level this is racketeering this is cartels mr. president
[59:17.160 --> 59:24.080]  we need your help we need it now you can take on big tech they saw info wars as
[59:24.080 --> 59:29.360]  a dominant independent anti-war pro-human pro-sovereign pro-family
[59:29.360 --> 59:34.560]  populist organization so they thought first they come for Alex Jones then
[59:34.560 --> 59:39.160]  when people say okay take him off the air everyone else like dominoes would fall
[59:39.160 --> 59:43.520]  the way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a
[59:43.520 --> 59:47.280]  standard of freedom and free speech understand that they believe they can
[59:47.280 --> 59:54.960]  take us down they'll take everybody else down. You're listening to the Alex
[59:54.960 --> 1:00:12.040]  Jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin Texas broadcasting
[1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:26.320]  worldwide it's Alex Jones. Alright final segment with Norm Hattis I want to make one more
[1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:31.120]  point on the white shoe boy situation I want to show how on target my use of the
[1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:36.200]  English language in terms is from time to time sometimes I butcher it but I said
[1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:41.920]  white shoe boy white shoe boy means stereotypical Ivy League effeminate or
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:45.560]  immature establishment pertaining to mainstream US social power that's from
[1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:52.560]  definitions and of course we've got countless others that show that white
[1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:58.320]  shoe or white shoe law firm this is from Wikipedia the phrase comes from white
[1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:03.520]  buck lace suede buckskin shoes for the Red Soul long popular in Ivy League
[1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:09.240]  colleges a 1953 s-square article describes social strata at Yale University
[1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:12.760]  explains that white shoe applies primarily to the socially ambitious and
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:18.400]  the socially smug types it is pertaining to Yale so a lot of these guys are
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:21.940]  Yale graduates they're there in Connecticut next door to Yale the
[1:01:21.940 --> 1:01:28.480]  courthouses down the street from Yale I gave the exact naming to show off my
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:39.080]  understanding of rhetorical lexicons and that gets transmuted into Jew oh sorry
[1:01:39.080 --> 1:01:51.320]  it also goes on an s-square to say wasp that's right members of the white elite
[1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:58.400]  wasp white Anglo-Saxon Protestant white Anglo-Saxon Protestant now turns
[1:01:58.400 --> 1:02:06.640]  into Jew in the magical courtroom wow thanks a lot Connecticut wow thanks a
[1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:11.400]  lot you're really the good guys aren't you up there liberals norm I want to
[1:02:11.400 --> 1:02:14.760]  finish up and we may have to go a little bit the next segment on this but let's
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:17.320]  do a few more minutes the next segment because I want to just be be totally
[1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:22.080]  clear on this on this many thing but but what do you make of the magnitude of
[1:02:22.080 --> 1:02:26.240]  this alchemy because we could play the clip here you know where I'm yelling and
[1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:28.960]  you know getting upset and saying you white shoe boys think you know it all
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:32.720]  I mean that's so clear what I said and everybody I know in Connecticut knows
[1:02:32.720 --> 1:02:37.800]  that term it's where it comes from what do you make of this when you say if you
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:41.360]  if you were to Belch they'd call the Environmental Protection Agency and
[1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:44.720]  make an air pollution complaint there are plenty of people up here for whom
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:49.400]  you are toxic but understand there's a growing number who aren't after we argued
[1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:53.760]  the other day against sanctions for you one of the marshals came up to me the
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:56.760]  next day I was in court on trial in another matter and said you know I
[1:02:56.760 --> 1:03:00.240]  agreed with everything you said on behalf of Mr. Jones in that courtroom the
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:05.120]  judge was wrong that was from a marshal in the courthouse I have people I was on
[1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:08.520]  the radio on him at the Vinnie Penn Show a local journalist you've interviewed
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:13.360]  with him we were talking about what's going on and and and he was said you
[1:03:13.360 --> 1:03:16.400]  know we're still talking about the Sandy Hook kids seven years later I said one
[1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:20.400]  of the concerns Mr. Jones has is that people other people are using this
[1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:25.080]  tragedy to advance their own agendas and I you know it's no mystery to us that
[1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:28.560]  the Sandy Hook complaint was filed more than five years after most of the
[1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:32.240]  utterances and only after Hillary Clinton lost an election in which you
[1:03:32.240 --> 1:03:36.200]  were believed to have played a pivotal role so the cases become a political
[1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:40.560]  hot potato the children of Sandy Hook and their families are now pawns in a
[1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:46.200]  game that long since ended and you know as tragic as that shooting was the
[1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:50.760]  future is ahead of us but yet the legacy of Sandy Hook continues not because
[1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:54.720]  you're talking about it but because it's become a political brick bat and when
[1:03:54.720 --> 1:03:59.280]  that brick bat gets a little stale or a little limp in the hands then suddenly
[1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:02.080]  you're breathing you know you're they're gonna tarry with the anti-Semitism
[1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:07.880]  exactly and then they and then in a child porn and and just saying Jew boy
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:12.600]  none of this is true and it's just crazy how mainstream media lies like this and
[1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:16.360]  how they've got all these different angles that come out of it it just never
[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:21.240]  seems in this is why media is not trusted this is why they're hated it's
[1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:23.880]  shocking I mean people don't get it that's what I told the judge in court
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:26.920]  the other day I said you know Alex Jones didn't create his listeners people
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:29.880]  listen to Alex Jones because there's a legitimacy crisis in this country
[1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:33.600]  there's a fundamental lack of trust in big institutions and it's reporting like
[1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:37.760]  this and distortions like this that create the trust whether we agree with
[1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:40.880]  you or whether you and I agree on every issue or not it doesn't really matter
[1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:46.200]  you're right to speak does and when people resort to this truth why I'm to
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:49.760]  try to silence you that term you're right let's finish up on the other side
[1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:54.080]  to get into the big war news which is huge stay with us folks info wars.com
[1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:57.400]  tomorrow's news today
[1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:05.240]  info wars the most banned network in the world viewers and listeners I wouldn't
[1:05:05.240 --> 1:05:09.600]  be here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've
[1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:13.600]  seen but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to
[1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:17.360]  tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last
[1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:20.840]  week the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars you
[1:05:20.840 --> 1:05:24.360]  went and looked it up and found out the truth and so I feel very strong and I
[1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:27.920]  feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart I want you to
[1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:31.160]  know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for all you've done

[1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:39.000]  committed to fight to the end but I want to win and without you I'm gonna be

[1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:47.040]  could win we're a key chess piece in this fight we're being used by God you're
[1:05:47.040 --> 1:05:50.840]  being used by God this is Providence so I salute you and I thank you for all
[1:05:50.840 --> 1:05:56.640]  you've done from the bottom of my heart info wars the most banned network in
[1:05:56.640 --> 1:05:59.080]  the world
[1:05:59.080 --> 1:06:11.000]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:15.840]  you live from the front lines of the info war
[1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:25.880]  I'm Alex Jones your host we're into hour number two on this Friday June 21st
[1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:33.040]  2019 global transmission we came within 10 minutes of launching a new war in the
[1:06:33.040 --> 1:06:37.400]  Middle East over a hundred thousand missiles Israel would have faced along
[1:06:37.400 --> 1:06:41.240]  with Saudi Arabia that would have been rained down on them by Iran but in the
[1:06:41.240 --> 1:06:44.960]  last minute Trump said no next segment we'll give you the inside baseball and
[1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:49.040]  why that happened why it's so important because the same neo-gans and leftist are
[1:06:49.040 --> 1:06:53.680]  pushing for war as we speak the Democratic Party now officially in
[1:06:53.680 --> 1:06:58.840]  national polls sees war as anti-trump because Trump is seen as anti-war the
[1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:04.360]  now Democrats and Gallup polls 57% that's the latest the one a month ago was
[1:07:04.360 --> 1:07:13.400]  54% want war period and want us to stay in over 120 nations total and complete
[1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:16.640]  madness will also open the phones up throughout the rest of the broadcast
[1:07:16.640 --> 1:07:20.440]  have a couple special guests popping in some stations don't care the first hour
[1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:27.480]  most do but let's recap with famous top 10 criminal and First Amendment and
[1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:31.480]  civil rights lawyers out there Norm Patis and of course you see him a lot on
[1:07:31.480 --> 1:07:35.200]  the national news care some of the biggest cases out there just did a big
[1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:39.080]  one the big divorce case with a Russian oligarch and his wife did it the other
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:42.320]  big murder case in Connecticut but he's done some of the biggest First Amendment
[1:07:42.320 --> 1:07:46.600]  cases in the country and he's seen the dangerous trend towards destroying him
[1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:49.600]  so recapping what we covered in just the next few minutes will let you go
[1:07:49.600 --> 1:07:54.160]  you're busy on the other info we didn't get into and why this is so serious
[1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:59.400]  again this is not about Alex Jones folks this is a premeditated move to end free
[1:07:59.400 --> 1:08:03.560]  speech and the Democratic Party law firm biggest in Connecticut that's also
[1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:09.840]  suing me is suing pushing reparations and suing Harvard trying to get the
[1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:17.280]  first photos ever of slaves taken from Harvard and given to the descendants so
[1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:20.560]  I mean these guys are really undermining this they're the ones that
[1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:25.680]  bankrupted Smith and Wesson our oldest gun company won't be able to get those
[1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:30.480]  firearms soon our military uses them the 308 Remington 700 don't want a sweet
[1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:35.080]  shooting gun my son's got a couple of them so do I I've shot deer at a thousand
[1:08:35.080 --> 1:08:42.040]  yards with them like take a candy from a baby gone bankrupt over so we I have the
[1:08:42.040 --> 1:08:48.640]  system coming after me but I want to clarify something Friday I had gotten a
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:53.000]  lot of really rough family news I'm gonna leave it at that and I had also had a
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:56.440]  French TV crew here that said they were coming about the First Amendment it was
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:09:01.600]  really about Sandy Hook and so I was already pissed off and about once a
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:05.200]  year I will almost have like a Tourette syndrome type event before the news runs
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:09.760]  with Jones diagnosed Tourette syndrome that's a turn of the phrase that's
[1:09:09.760 --> 1:09:16.080]  hyperbole like when I set a deposition I almost have a form of I would say the
[1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:22.520]  public collective well I guess the term would be psychosis in that when you get
[1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:27.120]  lied to so much people believe that the earth is flat I don't believe that but
[1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:32.280]  because they've been lied to so much a lot of people believe the earth is flat
[1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:36.720]  now now I believe that's totally wrong but it's a collective psychosis when
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:40.800]  you've been lied to almost no one believed last week that the Iranians
[1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:44.120]  really attacked those ships I said they might have done it because they said we
[1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:48.520]  may sink them in the straight or most they sure shot down that drone that didn't
[1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:51.320]  mean I want war it didn't mean I'm pushing a war I said it could really be
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:57.760]  them my listeners got really mad at me because people now don't buy anything
[1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:04.360]  because they've been lied to so much so they spun that but I legitimately got
[1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:09.520]  angry on air and I'm not gonna sit there and watch the corporate news and all
[1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:13.400]  the rest of them with their latest lies that we'll recap in a moment say I lost
[1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:16.960]  a suit this week for a book I didn't write the book I've never read called
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:21.400]  nobody died at Sandy Hook did no such thing people have a right to write that
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:24.080]  book I don't think they should have you know they basically just didn't fight it
[1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:29.240]  and let them win the case I'm not in the book I've not read the book I'm told
[1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:35.200]  I'm not in it that's a total hoax ultimate fake news top of yahoo top of AP
[1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:40.760]  top of Twitter for days ultimate fake news Cyop MSM falsely claims Alex Jones
[1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:46.320]  loses Sandy Hook defamation case totally insane that's on news wars.com and we've
[1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:49.280]  had lawyers sending them letters and calling them for days they just go
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:52.960]  we're leaving it up okay that matter you're not on the book we're just gonna
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:57.520]  say it because it creates the illusion that I'm this criminal and I'm losing so
[1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:02.240]  some big event can happen I think coming soon unfortunately for me but it just
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:05.560]  shows how desperate the enemy is they then put out all over the news that I
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:09.960]  threatened Chris Matty no I didn't that's not my intent and I didn't do it I
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:13.400]  said I'm mad at you guys making me spend hundreds of thousands of dollars
[1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:18.640]  going through six no nine million emails 9.6 million emails and and then
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:23.320]  running to the FBI because we later learned going oh look this is criminal
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:28.600]  this is criminal the FBI said no Alex is a victim that's what I'm mad about this
[1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:31.780]  happens to everybody that's in the media they get sent this crap we didn't open it
[1:11:31.780 --> 1:11:35.480]  went to spam not that I'm gonna put your head on a pike I said we're gonna put
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:38.880]  out this big reward we're gonna catch who's done it and their heads gonna get
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:43.040]  put on a pike that's figurative and I said whoever you are that did this that's
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:47.400]  not Chris Matty I don't think Chris Matty would do that anymore that I would
[1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:51.280]  send child porn to the to the Sandy Hook family and then no one sent that to
[1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:56.040]  them law firms going through raw emails that had hidden attachments sent it to
[1:11:56.040 --> 1:12:01.120]  lawyers not to the families so it's lie upon lie upon lie and that's when I'm
[1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:06.520]  angry about is just the years of this crap and now the Jew boy thing when I
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:11.400]  said you white shoe boys from Yale that means Yale that year for me there you're
[1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:16.920]  in the town with Yale the establishment at Yale or whoever's running things in
[1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:22.680]  that town stop lying about me you go oh we'll just say Jew boy we'll just keep
[1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:27.160]  doubling down that's why you're not trusted it's why you're not liked it's
[1:12:27.160 --> 1:12:33.720]  why you're hated but do not build up your ambulance chaser type you know
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:38.040]  reputation that I'm threatening you I would never want you to be a martyr
[1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:41.800]  never want you to get hurt I don't want anyone to hurt you I would never do that
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:46.880]  and you know that I didn't say Jew boy I didn't say I want you hurt I didn't
[1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:52.080]  send the family's child porn damn it I'm the victim and my crew's the victim I
[1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:57.480]  had two people put over this crap excuse me I'm getting mad again Norm I'm sorry
[1:12:57.480 --> 1:13:01.800]  I'm sorry just to go ahead and fill folks in here briefly I was president in the
[1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:05.840]  studio when Hurricane Alex last hit and I kept my chair but briefly and I'm
[1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:09.400]  holding on to the arm rest here in Connecticut take a deep breath I'll
[1:13:09.400 --> 1:13:14.040]  sort this out for you there's no question in my mind that you did not
[1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:18.680]  threaten Chris Maddie you were frustrated you were a motive you were
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:23.280]  out of control but that's a long way from a threat and if you ever any a person
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:27.600]  had a reason to lose control it was you and this week it's even worse I mean
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:32.440]  Jew boy threat child porn I mean the next thing you know you're going to be
[1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:39.880]  blamed for the shooting down the drone in Iran I mean at some point you stop
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:43.360]  being a scapegoat and you start being an ordinary American and maybe that's what
[1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:47.440]  your new branch should be rather than Alex Jones conspiracy theorist it's
[1:13:47.440 --> 1:13:51.600]  Alex Jones ordinary American he's mad as hell and he's not going to take it
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:56.120]  anymore and when he gets mad everybody gets scared that's not hate speech that's
[1:13:56.120 --> 1:13:59.880]  fear speaking and I'm proud to stand next to you well I just I don't even know
[1:13:59.880 --> 1:14:03.840]  who Chris Maddie is other than just leave him aside well I'm saying I wish that
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:07.480]  guy no harm and I don't want him any harm and I'm sick of the media running
[1:14:07.480 --> 1:14:11.320]  around acting like I'm threatening him to make people more victim just like
[1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:15.520]  they say that I say nobody died at Sandy Hook to reopen the wounds in my name
[1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:18.800]  and then it's the same thing always in my name and they're the ones doing it
[1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:22.840]  you see Alex Alex don't let yourself be a bit player in the crisis acting that
[1:14:22.840 --> 1:14:26.040]  the lawyers are doing on the other side let's focus on the first amendment let's
[1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:29.520]  focus on what ordinary Americans care about no I totally agree just hearing
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:34.480]  I'm getting mad again vicious of plaintiffs lawyers you know and this is
[1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:38.840]  one of the reasons they are anything for a buck all right well listen Norm I
[1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:41.440]  appreciate you and I appreciate the fine work you're doing we're going to the
[1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:44.680]  Supreme Court aren't we we're going to the courts next week to try to overturn

[1:14:55.280 --> 1:14:58.520]  Monday morning saying how about a little justice or did we forget about that
[1:14:58.520 --> 1:15:02.560]  along the way but we've sacrificed truth we've tracked sacrifice the American
[1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:06.960]  way let's hope the courts aren't immune to claims for justice and let's be clear
[1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:11.320]  I did not lose a lawsuit I did not write a book that Jim Fetzer wrote the way they
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:15.960]  said I lost a lawsuit in AP this judge ruled at the preliminary level to not
[1:15:15.960 --> 1:15:22.280]  throw out the lawsuit against me saying because of things I said on air I mean

[1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:33.920]  would otherwise be a stunning display of contempt for time are honored well

[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:16.240]  secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is
[1:19:16.240 --> 1:19:20.840]  an old-school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:24.280]  freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so
[1:19:24.280 --> 1:19:27.520]  concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support
[1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:31.280]  and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press
[1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:34.240]  they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:37.680]  been co-opted by big corporation or billionaire sugar daddies who've been
[1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:41.760]  able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have
[1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:46.320]  or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that they
[1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:50.400]  are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy
[1:19:50.400 --> 1:19:53.640]  and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the
[1:19:53.640 --> 1:20:20.200]  platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:20.200 --> 1:20:38.440]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:41.560]  all right i really do want to stop talking about myself but we've been
[1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:45.040]  ganged up on i'm trying to destroy us and we don't fight back we're gonna be
[1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:49.080]  gone it's like them saying trump said all mexicans are criminals and bad people
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:53.240]  these are they've got a lot of very fine people come to this nation and they
[1:20:53.240 --> 1:20:57.000]  coming on work visas at my hotels and casinos and golf courses and they're
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:00.600]  wonderful people you've also got a lot of really really bad horrible people
[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:04.840]  coming in who are criminals who are fleeing justice that's not all mexicans
[1:21:04.840 --> 1:21:13.160]  are bad it's asinine it's insane and it's the same thing they do to me the
[1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:18.760]  good news is raw story has retracted this is something that we don't see
[1:21:18.760 --> 1:21:27.560]  anymore this is good alex jones ladies and gentlemen
[1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:31.480]  attacks sandy hook family's lawyer as little white shoe boy
[1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:36.920]  in latest unhinged tirade and here is the original article that i have a
[1:21:36.920 --> 1:21:40.760]  screenshot of and i have a print off of where it said
[1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:48.920]  jew boy and we've got the clip queued up where i was ranting angry last
[1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:52.680]  friday and clearly i'm not saying jew boy
[1:21:52.680 --> 1:21:57.880]  why in the hell would i mail email child porn to the sandy hook families
[1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:02.680]  again why not jump off a cliff why would i get up here on air and say jew boy
[1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:06.440]  when i've never been against jews and i get persecuted because i'm not against
[1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:14.600]  jews it's just absolutely ridiculous but
[1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:17.240]  i'm going to get into the iran stuff it's really our top story and all this other
[1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:21.640]  news next segment i just had to get to this because
[1:22:21.640 --> 1:22:25.320]  the lies are getting so intense that i don't feel sorry for myself
[1:22:25.320 --> 1:22:31.640]  but i really worry about the country because the the media used to lie a lot
[1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:36.200]  but mainly on politics normally if they said something like a plane crashed or
[1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:39.640]  there was a tornado here you could believe it sometimes they lie about stuff
[1:22:39.640 --> 1:22:43.160]  like that now where i don't even it's very frustrating
[1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:47.240]  we've really gotten to a bad point but i'm glad that raw story
[1:22:47.240 --> 1:22:51.000]  who did run the fake news and is on the list to get sued by the way
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:56.680]  and we sent retraction letters to where they said that i sent child porn to
[1:22:56.680 --> 1:22:59.880]  the families no i didn't somebody sent us hidden images
[1:22:59.880 --> 1:23:05.480]  buried in stuff about david rockerfeller
[1:23:05.480 --> 1:23:09.480]  right after i got sued by the sandy hook families and it was never opened and
[1:23:09.480 --> 1:23:16.280]  they subpoenaed it and found hidden metadata hidden child porn hidden code
[1:23:16.280 --> 1:23:21.160]  i can't go through 9.6 million emails nobody can
[1:23:21.160 --> 1:23:25.560]  and again i'm angry that we spent trying to not send them
[1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:29.000]  anything that was private that would hurt any listeners
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:32.120]  in court battles like five or six of them just that level
[1:23:32.120 --> 1:23:35.720]  hundreds of thousands of dollars there was like a hundred and fifty thousand
[1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:40.440]  dollars total and then another processing things and
[1:23:40.440 --> 1:23:43.960]  computer stuff and two people quit because they were working
[1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:47.800]  18 hours a day and just just said i can't handle this we lost two of our
[1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:52.360]  it people over this that's why i'm angry and then you get all the material and
[1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:56.520]  you stand it with some fancy pants california thing and go oh look he's
[1:23:56.520 --> 1:23:59.960]  got child porn see i'm not going to blow up again
[1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:03.960]  it just getting framed by the process
[1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:07.640]  pisses me off i don't think those lawyers sent us the child porn i never
[1:24:07.640 --> 1:24:10.440]  said that but they know damn well when they
[1:24:10.440 --> 1:24:14.360]  frame this stuff up with the media what they're doing
[1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:17.960]  i'm gonna stop right there i i just want justice and i'm a good guy i'm not a
[1:24:17.960 --> 1:24:22.040]  criminal i don't even speed anymore i used to
[1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:24.920]  drive fast on at night when nobody was around
[1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:27.560]  but my work is so important now that it's been
[1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:32.440]  years since i drove a hundred miles an hour
[1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:36.920]  i like to drive fast i like to get on the open road i like to go 150 miles an
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:39.880]  hour and if i ever get out in death valley or
[1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:43.080]  something i'll do it again where it's safe or montana
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:47.480]  where it's a hundred mile an hour speed limit but it's just i i'm mr goody
[1:24:47.480 --> 1:24:52.680]  two shoes i i pay all the garbage taxes i do everything i'm supposed to do i
[1:24:52.680 --> 1:24:56.600]  take care of little old ladies i give money to charity and i got all this
[1:24:56.600 --> 1:25:00.840]  scum constantly saying i'm a bad person no i'm a good person
[1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:04.200]  you globalists are the bad people and no matter how long you try to paint me up
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:08.120]  as the bad guy america knows the truth enough about that here
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:11.160]  let's play the white shoe boy comment which means
[1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:15.240]  elites from yale that's who these people are here it is
[1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:18.680]  you are not a suspect you are not a target you are not a person of interest
[1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:23.960]  you are a victim and that's the story here i wonder the person of interest is
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:27.160]  look you're showing chris maddie's photograph oh no that was an
[1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:31.720]  accessional cut i'm he's a nice obama boy he's a good chris maddie is your
[1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:35.400]  adversary in this litigation just as i am the adversary of the people of
[1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:39.320]  that have sued you and it is my responsibility to take their case apart
[1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:44.040]  if i can and he will attack you white shoe boy that thinks he owns america
[1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:47.720]  i'm not going to engage in a personal attack on chris maddie i want to find out
[1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:51.480]  who sent the and that's not that's they they aim at whatever i'm talking
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:54.200]  about here and that was inadvertent
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:58.520]  and again we've already clarified that so there you go white shoe boy and again
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:02.200]  this is the left this is what they do
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:06.920]  alex jones attacks sandy mcfamily's lawyer as little white
[1:26:06.920 --> 1:26:11.480]  shoe boy in latest unhinged outburst and then somebody sending press releases
[1:26:11.480 --> 1:26:15.160]  out to the media saying that and there's i've now
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:19.000]  learned officially during the break there's three different court transcripts
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.800]  that were done two of them say white shoe boy
[1:26:21.800 --> 1:26:26.760]  one of them says white shoe boy the one that says white shoe boy is not signed
[1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:30.920]  somebody is playing games and we're going to find out
[1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:34.280]  who is sending the emails out to the media
[1:26:34.280 --> 1:26:38.200]  with a doctored transcript i believe saying that
[1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:41.160]  but you just had your lion ears hear that didn't you
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:43.560]  all right we're gonna break i'm gonna reset i'm gonna get focused i'm not

[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.560]  want to get pissed this is the way to get pissed
[1:26:57.560 --> 1:27:01.000]  and i knew where this whole thing was going from the start but you know what
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:05.640]  i'm proud of what i've done against evil and i'm proud of what you've done
[1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:09.000]  standing with us and i do it all over again and it just confirms everything
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.880]  we thought about the system it's unbelievably corrupt and we've got
[1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:15.160]  good people trying to fix the system and they're all being attacked and that's
[1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:18.680]  why this is happening all right we're gonna go to break

[1:32:59.640 --> 1:33:13.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:13.160 --> 1:33:31.560]  we were 10 minutes from striking iran they may have responded by launching
[1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:34.760]  over 100 000 missiles in israel and saudi arabia
[1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:38.600]  the tucker carlson and others last minute begged the president said you're
[1:33:38.600 --> 1:33:42.840]  being set up with the neocons he decided to call off the raid after he'd already
[1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:45.400]  given the order i've confirmed that happened
[1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:49.640]  from two people involved in the whole situation
[1:33:49.640 --> 1:33:52.440]  think about how this country is on the knife's edge
[1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:56.440]  trump overall means well but it's true he can be
[1:33:56.440 --> 1:34:00.760]  influenced by people he respects that's why they try to control who's around him
[1:34:00.760 --> 1:34:04.200]  if trump had good people around him we would defeat the globalist very quickly
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:06.920]  here's the president's latest comments
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:13.320]  oh absolutely when i came here iran was
[1:34:13.320 --> 1:34:17.560]  in 14 to 18 different sites of confliction
[1:34:17.560 --> 1:34:20.760]  they were extremely hostile they were hostile when they signed the deal they
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:26.360]  were screaming death to america and i think probably iran
[1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:30.600]  made a mistake i would imagine it was a general or somebody that
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:35.800]  made a mistake in shooting that drone down and fortunately that drone was
[1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:40.920]  unarmed it was not there was no man in it and there was no it was just
[1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:44.280]  it was over international waters clearly over international waters but we
[1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:47.640]  didn't have a man or woman in the drone we had nobody in the drone
[1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:50.520]  would have made a big difference let me tell you would have made a big big
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:56.280]  difference but uh i have a feeling i may be wrong
[1:34:56.280 --> 1:35:00.120]  and i may be right but i'm right a lot i have a feeling that
[1:35:00.120 --> 1:35:03.640]  it was a mistake made by somebody that shouldn't have been doing what they
[1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:06.360]  did i think they made a mistake and i'm not just
[1:35:06.360 --> 1:35:09.800]  talking to cut the country made a mistake i think that somebody under the
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:14.600]  command of that country made a big difference talking to iran's leadership
[1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:17.720]  let's just see what happens you just let's see what happens it's all gonna
[1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:20.920]  work out
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:26.920]  say it i don't know i i find it hard to believe it was intentional if you want
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:30.520]  to know the truth i think that it could have been somebody who was
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:36.120]  loose and stupid that did it but will be able to report back and you'll
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:39.800]  understand exactly what happened but it was a very foolish move
[1:35:39.800 --> 1:35:42.760]  that i can tell you if you feel like they're members of your administration
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:47.160]  who are trying to push you into conflict no not at all not at all in fact in many
[1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:50.360]  cases it's the opposite but i will say look i said
[1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:53.960]  i want to get out of these endless wars i campaigned on that i want to get out
[1:35:53.960 --> 1:35:57.640]  we've been in afghanistan for 19 years as you know we've reduced very
[1:35:57.640 --> 1:36:02.280]  substantially in afghanistan we beat the caliphate we took back
[1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:06.520]  100 of the caliphate when it was 99 percent justin i said
[1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:09.080]  we're going to get out we're going to start peeling back and everybody went
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:12.040]  crazy because it was 99 so i said all right so we'll finish it up so we got
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:14.920]  100 and we're pulling that back out of
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:18.840]  syria we're pulling a lot of people back but this is something this is a new
[1:36:18.840 --> 1:36:22.520]  wrinkle this is a new fly in the ointment what happened shooting down the
[1:36:22.520 --> 1:36:26.200]  drone and this country will not stand for it
[1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:36.440]  then i can tell you thank you very much
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:39.800]  you know i don't normally play air raid sirens and marching
[1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:44.600]  but just to set the flavor here we've been playing it quite a bit because
[1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:47.480]  if we have a war with iran it will probably turn into a regional war
[1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:51.080]  and then it could expand from there and we have a military expert jolscowson
[1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:54.200]  the head of world affairs brief dot com the editor of that
[1:36:54.200 --> 1:36:58.120]  also a well-known author a researcher and
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:01.000]  expert anti-globalist that's been fighting them for 40 years
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:04.280]  along with his family fighting him for 60 70 years
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:08.440]  clonks cowson and others your former naval aviator as well
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:12.520]  watching all this unfold it was almost
[1:37:12.520 --> 1:37:16.280]  like prophetic yesterday where we've got to get word to trump tug of
[1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:19.080]  curls is going to talk to trump everybody's got to call the white
[1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:22.840]  house you tell them don't strike iran it's a setup and
[1:37:22.840 --> 1:37:26.200]  he orders the strike last minute calls right back and says no we're not going
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:29.880]  to do it now i'm going my gut like he said get out of afghanistan the
[1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:33.480]  military basically said no you can't do it he said well i'm violating my gut
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:37.240]  okay we'll keep some troops there this is an amazing time
[1:37:37.240 --> 1:37:40.440]  joel how would you characterize what's happened and
[1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:44.280]  i think the neocons are going to push for more provocations
[1:37:44.280 --> 1:37:47.720]  well indeed they are alex and the next one is going to be something that
[1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:51.480]  involves the killing of american servicemen this is the
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:55.160]  of red line that donald trump has tacitly set up
[1:37:55.160 --> 1:37:58.920]  is that i mean when he's when he said and he asked the general i said how many
[1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:02.440]  people is the strike going to kill and he said about 150 and he said
[1:38:02.440 --> 1:38:05.800]  now that's not proportional you know nobody was killed when this drama
[1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:10.440]  john was shut down so he is sensitive to the fact that
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:13.400]  civilian deaths he's sensitive to the fact that he's promised to get out of
[1:38:13.400 --> 1:38:17.960]  these endless wars but i don't buy his excuse
[1:38:17.960 --> 1:38:22.360]  that he feels like it was a mistake i don't think that iran
[1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:26.680]  shot it down by mistake this was an intentional provocation by the deep
[1:38:26.680 --> 1:38:30.920]  state to send a drone over the border into iran and i'm not
[1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:34.040]  buying for example that it was in international waters
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:38.280]  you've got to remember that the Strait of Hormuz is only 21 miles wide
[1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:43.560]  both oman and iran own both sides of the strait there is no international
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:46.120]  waters in the straits of hormuz it's either iran or
[1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:52.040]  oman and they recovered debris from the drone in iranian
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:57.400]  waters and that indicates that it was tracking in fact i've seen the track
[1:38:57.400 --> 1:39:01.480]  that the iranians provided of the drone and it clearly went into
[1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:05.320]  the iranian side of the border so i think this was an intentional
[1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:10.200]  provocation iran was right to be able to shoot it down this was a spy drone
[1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:13.960]  of course they couldn't tell if this was a reaper drone or whether or not it was
[1:39:13.960 --> 1:39:17.800]  a reaper predator drone or a global hawk from the air they looked the same
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:22.200]  from radar they looked the same both of them the one that was shot or attempted
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:24.920]  to shoot down last week and the one that was shot down
[1:39:24.920 --> 1:39:29.160]  yesterday was with the transponder off so the u.s
[1:39:29.160 --> 1:39:33.880]  central command says well they were in normal airspace of airline traffic going
[1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:37.000]  between oman and uh and other middle eastern canine but that
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:41.400]  isn't true with your transponder off you're telling him i'm a military aircraft
[1:39:41.400 --> 1:39:45.240]  and let's not forget uh you are a private pilot not just a former naval
[1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:48.760]  aviator by the way breaking news this morning i said you know i don't want
[1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:51.800]  to believe mainstream news saying that trump ordered the strike and then
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:55.400]  called it off but all the mainstream media said it was true
[1:39:55.400 --> 1:39:59.240]  uh the iranians said well he did call and say the strike was happening but then
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:02.600]  he called and called it off so who knows what's going on now i believe
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:06.200]  trump mark dice tweets turns out it was just more fake news
[1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:10.200]  that trump ordered an attack on iran but then called it off at the last minute
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:13.320]  what a shocker trump has just given an interview to chuck
[1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:17.240]  todd of meet the press an exclusive interview
[1:40:17.240 --> 1:40:20.360]  to his enemies says he hadn't given the final approval
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:24.040]  to iran strikes so is the pentagon saying that he'd taken the safety off
[1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:27.720]  had gotten the aircraft ready so technically they believe he'd ordered it
[1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:32.200]  and i mean this is getting really dangerous let's play this clip
[1:40:32.200 --> 1:40:35.800]  so did you green light something or had you said
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:39.080]  if we do it i'll do this what was it what was the order you nothing is
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:42.600]  green lighted until the very end because things change right you never gave a
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:45.480]  final no no no but we had something ready to go
[1:40:45.480 --> 1:40:48.840]  subject to my approval and they came in and they
[1:40:48.840 --> 1:40:52.440]  came in about a half an hour before they said sir we're about ready to go
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:56.360]  i said i want a better place in the air we're playing in the air we're about
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:40:59.320]  ready to go yeah no but they would have been pretty
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:02.280]  soon uh and things would have happened to a point
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:05.240]  where you wouldn't turn back or couldn't turn back
[1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:08.920]  so uh they came and they said sir we're ready to go we'd like a decision i
[1:41:08.920 --> 1:41:11.080]  said i want to know something before you go
[1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:15.720]  how many people will be killed in this case iranians
[1:41:15.720 --> 1:41:19.960]  i said how many people are going to be killed uh sir i'd like to get back to
[1:41:19.960 --> 1:41:23.960]  you on that great people these generals they said uh
[1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:30.200]  came back said sir approximately 150 and i thought about it for a second i said
[1:41:30.200 --> 1:41:35.960]  you know what they shut down an unmanned uh drone plane whatever you
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:40.280]  want to call it and here we are sitting with 150
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:44.520]  dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:48.840]  after i said go ahead yeah and i didn't like it i didn't think it was
[1:41:48.840 --> 1:41:53.000]  i didn't think it was proportionate so as you said y'all that's basically the
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.960]  president's thinking so he had that he had the safety off but hadn't pulled the
[1:41:55.960 --> 1:41:59.720]  trigger well i think that's true uh i don't
[1:41:59.720 --> 1:42:03.960]  think airplane planes were in the air on the aircraft carrier you launch
[1:42:03.960 --> 1:42:07.480]  uh in close proximity to a target they probably would have launched
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:13.000]  10 15 minutes before the strike and so it was probably not airplanes in the air
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  but nevertheless the point is i'm i'm concerned that donald
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:21.320]  trump is not being given the big picture now pepe escobar in strategic culture
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:24.600]  wrote a major uh piece where he was going to say
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:28.440]  you know here's the the problem uh you're going to close the straits for mousse
[1:42:28.440 --> 1:42:32.040]  you're going to raise oil 50 percent you're going to have the derivatives
[1:42:32.040 --> 1:42:35.240]  meltdown and you're going to have a hezbollah launching thousands of
[1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:39.480]  missiles at israel if you attack iran if he gets that message he's going to be
[1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:42.760]  very very cautious about going through with this war plane
[1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:47.240]  but as you said the neocons aren't going to stop i would expect within days
[1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:50.360]  just like we saw last week a provocation now this we're going to see more
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:54.040]  how do we avert that with jolscow's and enter in chief at world affairs brief

[1:44:03.320 --> 1:44:08.840]  facts and truth and evidence no longer matters the false claim that you
[1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:12.520]  purposely said kitty porn to the sandy hook
[1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:18.200]  plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as falls it's a smear somebody sends you

[1:44:22.440 --> 1:44:26.680]  discovery of nine million documents and then it's blamed on you this is
[1:44:26.680 --> 1:44:29.960]  Kafka-esque this is bizarre but the way the mainstream
[1:44:29.960 --> 1:44:33.800]  media rushes out to say jones sent kitty porn
[1:44:33.800 --> 1:44:37.480]  it is really outrageous i have a lot of respect for those media outlets and
[1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:41.320]  those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified but i went to
[1:44:41.320 --> 1:44:43.960]  wear the big boys where's the wall street journal where's
[1:44:43.960 --> 1:44:48.360]  associated press when are they going to report that they made a mistake and what
[1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:52.760]  they said about you was inaccurate so we both need your help and i urge
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:58.520]  folks to continue to support info wars with your dollars
[1:44:58.520 --> 1:45:02.520]  info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under
[1:45:02.520 --> 1:45:07.080]  unprecedented attack the last year or so it's it's it's orwellian it's it's
[1:45:07.080 --> 1:45:09.800]  biblical it's it's authoritarian it's insane
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:14.520]  and i keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time
[1:45:14.520 --> 1:45:17.800]  to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation
[1:45:17.800 --> 1:45:22.040]  and say hey we're sinking i've begged for your support before and thanks for
[1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:26.120]  keeping us afloat but this is the real sos if you don't buy a bunch of products
[1:45:26.120 --> 1:45:30.280]  and spread the word and keep fighting info wars will be shut down not just
[1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:34.520]  crippled and so we've reached that point it'll make the enemy happy but you know
[1:45:34.520 --> 1:45:37.000]  whatever we have withstood so many other attacks
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:40.920]  we've gone through so much because of your support you have you have been there
[1:45:40.920 --> 1:45:44.280]  but let me tell you they are pissed they haven't been successful
[1:45:44.280 --> 1:45:47.640]  and they're giving us their full assault so we need your prayers

[1:47:18.200 --> 1:47:30.440]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:33.800]  from deep in the heart of fema region six
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:41.320]  austin texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:45.880]  as above so below the old alchemist said and it's true
[1:47:45.880 --> 1:47:50.120]  trump is dealing with incredible hoaxes by the hour so are we
[1:47:50.120 --> 1:47:54.280]  the latest raw story and others are now retracting that i said
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:59.000]  that the plaintiffs lawyers for sandy hook families are white jew boys
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:02.280]  and they're having to retract that i sent them child porn
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:05.000]  we got the letter from the justice department hall wasa is writing an
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:10.200]  article right now for info wars.com but i showed that to you last hour but
[1:48:10.200 --> 1:48:14.600]  the left is just getting crazier and crazier and crazier and crazier
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:17.640]  not just here but all over the world massive censorship
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:22.200]  is intensifying and president trump
[1:48:22.200 --> 1:48:26.360]  decided not to kill 150 people potentially innocent people that iran strike
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:30.360]  what about iran's response to all scowls and you're a former naval aviator
[1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:32.600]  you really do a lot of research on international politics one of the
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:36.600]  smartest brains out there obviously won't see on national news but you've
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:38.680]  because you tell the truth but you've headed up some of the biggest
[1:48:38.680 --> 1:48:40.840]  movements in this country to try to get conservatism
[1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:45.160]  back into congress uh been one of the main enemies the left behind the scenes
[1:48:45.160 --> 1:48:48.600]  so you see you're a smart guy people should listen
[1:48:48.600 --> 1:48:52.040]  what do you think this bodes big picture what are they going to try next to get
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:56.520]  this war going like tucker carlsson said he's in dc
[1:48:56.520 --> 1:49:00.360]  everybody knows this is about uh going to war for
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:03.640]  saudi arabia and israel well saudi arabia and israel are going to get
[1:49:03.640 --> 1:49:07.800]  attacked when they do this iran's going to launch huge attacks it's believed
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:11.400]  or will iran just take it so a how are they going to try to provocate
[1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:16.040]  and and how could this war go from bad to worse
[1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:21.000]  well iran has been amazingly resistant to the tendency or the temptation to
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:24.200]  retaliate knowing that it's going to bring on a full-scale war of
[1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:28.120]  destruction from the united states so i think that
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:31.960]  it's very possible that iran would take a strike
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:35.480]  they would have absorbed this strike even if it had killed 150 people probably
[1:49:35.480 --> 1:49:40.920]  without retaliating but they've got a list on their agenda of
[1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:44.520]  things that they can really hurt the world economy israel and
[1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:48.280]  and saudi arabia not to mention us troops they
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:53.560]  you know they are the major supporter of hezbollah which has thousands of small
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:57.400]  caliber rockets and missiles that they can fire into
[1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:01.320]  israel and overwhelm the the dome iron dome system
[1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:05.080]  in fact they've been building up those arsenals now for many many months
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:10.760]  and so it's a real potential threat siri is fairly neutralized they can't
[1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:14.200]  really handle any attacks on israel on behalf of
[1:50:14.200 --> 1:50:17.320]  iran but iran's got tremendous missile throw
[1:50:17.320 --> 1:50:21.240]  capacity over a thousand missiles that they could throw into the middle east
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:25.880]  and the us patriot systems or the israeli systems are not going to be able to handle
[1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:29.400]  what they can throw out the biggest impact of course will be the shutting
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:32.120]  down of the straight hormones that iran can do
[1:50:32.120 --> 1:50:36.120]  in that very narrow straight they can shut down 30 percent of oil exports around
[1:50:36.120 --> 1:50:39.160]  the world which will cause oil prices to skyrocket
[1:50:39.160 --> 1:50:42.360]  rocket insurance rates will skyrocket on ships
[1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:47.240]  and worse yet there's a threat of a derivatives meltdown that's a quadruple
[1:50:47.240 --> 1:50:51.320]  trillion amount of money that could start a collapse
[1:50:51.320 --> 1:50:55.800]  of the world economy now that said the fed has the capability
[1:50:55.800 --> 1:50:59.960]  of to declare that there is no emergency and to keep derivatives from
[1:50:59.960 --> 1:51:03.160]  from collapsing and i think that they might pull
[1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:06.680]  that off as they have in the past but i think it's very very important
[1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:10.680]  understand that this really is a provocation in a false flag and in
[1:51:10.680 --> 1:51:14.120]  this week's world affairs brief which just came out this morning
[1:51:14.120 --> 1:51:18.680]  i outlined all of the details on the former false flags of last week
[1:51:18.680 --> 1:51:22.120]  as well as what's happening this week with the provocation of the drones and
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:26.600]  your listeners can get a free copy of that briefing just by emailing me at
[1:51:26.600 --> 1:51:33.320]  editor at world affairs brief dot com and i'll be happy to share with them
[1:51:33.320 --> 1:51:37.560]  clearly they want war with iran and it's not just israel and saudi arabia that
[1:51:37.560 --> 1:51:41.560]  wanted clearly i think they know that it can derail
[1:51:41.560 --> 1:51:45.480]  trump you were saying yesterday though that would probably get him reelected
[1:51:45.480 --> 1:51:49.080]  uh i think there's two sides to that if it goes badly
[1:51:49.080 --> 1:51:53.400]  and you know just like supposedly herbert walker bush's war went
[1:51:53.400 --> 1:51:57.640]  well but but but still people didn't like it just a year after he launched it
[1:51:57.640 --> 1:52:00.520]  um i mean i don't think trump's going to be
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:04.360]  goaded into war unless like you said people die and the iranians
[1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:07.800]  as a third point are reporting that there was a second
[1:52:07.800 --> 1:52:11.400]  plane with 35 personnel on board from the us
[1:52:11.400 --> 1:52:14.920]  that was a following right beside the drone they say as part of the
[1:52:14.920 --> 1:52:19.720]  provocation reuters reports that they did not blow that out of the air
[1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:24.920]  well they understand what the u.s uh trigger point is on this and so it's
[1:52:24.920 --> 1:52:27.240]  but you're right about it being inevitable and i write about it in
[1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:30.920]  today's world affairs brief here's the two reasons why this is inevitable
[1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:35.400]  number one which i've covered in the past iran is the only muslim country that
[1:52:35.400 --> 1:52:41.080]  is capable of being self-sufficient in airplanes rockets missiles boats
[1:52:41.080 --> 1:52:43.960]  they've got the full range of weaponry that they're developing they're much
[1:52:43.960 --> 1:52:47.560]  stronger when the u.s tried to take them out in 2004
[1:52:47.560 --> 1:52:51.400]  and and didn't because israel refused to go ahead with that until the u.s took
[1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:55.880]  care of syria which the russians thwarted but the second major reason
[1:52:55.880 --> 1:53:00.760]  is that iran is the sponsoring nation of all those nations who are savvy about
[1:53:00.760 --> 1:53:06.360]  the us and their phony war on terror the nations of syria uh
[1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:10.120]  yemen and uh now which used to be on the side of the globalist but
[1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:15.880]  switch sides and iran is back and hezbollah and lebanon and syria these
[1:53:15.880 --> 1:53:19.960]  nations are fully aware that the u.s is backing terror around the world
[1:53:19.960 --> 1:53:24.120]  including isis and al-qaeda and are fighting against it and that's why the
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:27.640]  u.s has put out this major propaganda piece that i ran as the
[1:53:27.640 --> 1:53:31.560]  greatest terror sponsor in the world it's an absolute falsehood
[1:53:31.560 --> 1:53:35.160]  they're fighting the u.s back war on terror and that's why they're against
[1:53:35.160 --> 1:53:40.040]  saudi arabia and israel and turkey which is now switched side to to the russian
[1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:43.960]  side is no longer in the u.s camp fully in that regard but turkey's got all the
[1:53:43.960 --> 1:53:49.240]  intelligence they were part of the supply chain to isis and al-qaeda they
[1:53:49.240 --> 1:53:53.640]  know that the u.s was uh was sponsoring all and doesn't that give turkey
[1:53:53.640 --> 1:53:59.400]  incredible blackmail power it does and but the u.s you know has blackmail
[1:53:59.400 --> 1:54:03.080]  power too because turkey's a member of nato and they can threaten to cut off
[1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:08.680]  uh turkish membership in nato but it's still a giant mexican standoff and you
[1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:12.520]  bring in pakistan in india and the chinese and the straight of hormuz and
[1:54:12.520 --> 1:54:15.480]  what's happening in europe and the collapsing third world i mean
[1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:17.800]  i know people that go to all these different caribbean islands used to be
[1:54:17.800 --> 1:54:19.880]  nice they say they're all becoming hellish
[1:54:19.880 --> 1:54:23.880]  they're all being found with poison in the alcohol uh people are dying
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:27.720]  everywhere i mean just things are deteriorating quickly in the world why
[1:54:27.720 --> 1:54:31.800]  would you say that's happening blooming populations overpopulation
[1:54:31.800 --> 1:54:35.800]  in the third world uh not enough jobs break down a society
[1:54:35.800 --> 1:54:39.720]  evil corruption a why is it all breaking down or do you agree it is
[1:54:39.720 --> 1:54:46.200]  and then b what's the big hot spot that kicks off the big world war
[1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:49.880]  well things are deteriorating because of globalist intervention
[1:54:49.880 --> 1:54:55.480]  and cia intervention destabilizing undermining sanctions create a lot of
[1:54:55.480 --> 1:54:58.520]  social unrest uh in the middle east as well as the
[1:54:58.520 --> 1:55:03.160]  displacement of millions of people uh they have refugee camps in jordan and
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:06.520]  have been turkey and they have them in other countries
[1:55:06.520 --> 1:55:11.000]  this is a real problem for the united states and the united states wants that
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.880]  kind of conflict they want that kind of social unrest
[1:55:13.880 --> 1:55:17.080]  and the only reason that iranians have said death to america is because the
[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:20.600]  us has had those sanctions on for for so many years
[1:55:20.600 --> 1:55:24.200]  but the one thing i want to get at before i answer the other part of your
[1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:27.720]  question alex is i'm really worried that
[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:31.640]  trump started out this impromptu press conference in the oval offices bashing
[1:55:31.640 --> 1:55:35.000]  iran it shows that he's not getting the message
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:39.800]  now i know you have tried to get uh information into the white house i know
[1:55:39.800 --> 1:55:44.680]  pepe has to go bottom from the left he's a marxist has tried to get it it's a
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:48.360]  you know the correct truth in this particular case but i'm not sure that's
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:51.560]  getting directly to trump otherwise he wouldn't continue to
[1:55:51.560 --> 1:55:56.920]  parrot the establishment propaganda about iran being the greatest terror in
[1:55:56.920 --> 1:56:00.120]  organization the world in the 56 countries trying to undermine
[1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:05.000]  liberty it's just not true so y'all stay there stay there do five more minutes with
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  us i want you to talk about solutions and ideas and and ways to put pressure on
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:11.880]  trump to know that we understand what he's doing is right and that war is
[1:56:11.880 --> 1:56:15.720]  unpopular and how this whole unfolds will come right back in two minutes on
[1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:18.840]  the side of break one more time to listeners
[1:56:18.840 --> 1:56:22.600]  we've got all the products you need the best non-gmo heirloom seeds the best
[1:56:22.600 --> 1:56:26.600]  water filtration the highest rated air filtration everything we've got
[1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:31.160]  is the highest rated for the price fact document cam shot please guys
[1:56:31.160 --> 1:56:35.000]  let's show people an example their tb viewers so here you here's a very simple
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:39.640]  graph okay you can get a super high quality stuff supposedly for the cost
[1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:43.240]  okay super high quality stuff as it goes up supposedly
[1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:46.200]  cost more it's not really true in every case
[1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:51.240]  uh versus cost you've got these two lines i try to find the best spot of the
[1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:54.600]  highest quality product that you can get for an affordable price a lot of times
[1:56:54.600 --> 1:56:59.400]  that highest quality product for an affordable price
[1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:02.760]  is usually right in the middle or even lower
[1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:07.000]  when stuff that costs a lot more but isn't it's good take ion filters

[1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:51.480]  info war's life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine
[1:58:51.480 --> 1:58:55.480]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new
[1:58:55.480 --> 1:58:59.320]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including
[1:58:59.320 --> 1:59:02.280]  promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[1:59:02.280 --> 1:59:06.760]  eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[1:59:06.760 --> 1:59:10.600]  researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[1:59:10.600 --> 1:59:14.440]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[1:59:14.440 --> 1:59:18.440]  they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[1:59:18.440 --> 1:59:21.640]  we now have the fruit of this research a fast acting
[1:59:21.640 --> 1:59:25.480]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[1:59:25.480 --> 1:59:29.880]  pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine
[1:59:29.880 --> 1:59:33.560]  in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[1:59:33.560 --> 1:59:37.240]  activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune
[1:59:37.240 --> 1:59:42.440]  and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[1:59:42.440 --> 1:59:46.280]  head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block
[1:59:46.280 --> 1:59:49.240]  chewable tablets
[1:59:49.240 --> 2:00:14.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:18.040]  all right jill scowson editor chief at worldoffirstrafe.com
[2:00:18.040 --> 2:00:21.320]  expert on a lot of things that are unfolding great to have with us
[2:00:21.320 --> 2:00:25.000]  in closing i had to cut you off because the break
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:27.960]  ways to stop this what's happening in the world
[2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:30.920]  why the borders are collapsing you know the un's funding that but but but it's
[2:00:30.920 --> 2:00:34.440]  obviously getting worse and where you see all this going if
[2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:38.760]  if trump and others don't take corrective action
[2:00:38.760 --> 2:00:42.760]  well you know i've i've long said i'm pessimistic about
[2:00:42.760 --> 2:00:46.600]  long-term change because of how deeply the deep state is
[2:00:46.600 --> 2:00:50.440]  is hidden down deep in the bowels of government and international government
[2:00:50.440 --> 2:00:54.040]  and even in all western governments and then when they have the other
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:57.320]  existential threats from russia and china which eventually are going to attack
[2:00:57.320 --> 2:01:01.080]  the west but trump can make a change and one of
[2:01:01.080 --> 2:01:05.720]  the biggest you know agendas of the new world order of the globalist
[2:01:05.720 --> 2:01:10.120]  is to create chaos in the world through constant warfare
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:13.720]  this is not the big terrible war which i still believe is going to be triggered
[2:01:13.720 --> 2:01:18.040]  by north korea this is going to be a major regional war
[2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:21.800]  and i'll tell you if they do in this next false flag attack attack
[2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:26.680]  us troops and kill americans trump is going to go on a rampage like we've
[2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:29.000]  never seen before and there's no stopping him
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:34.600]  trump has this psychological problem of getting on a bandwagon once he makes a
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:37.080]  compromise like in north korea and once he
[2:01:37.080 --> 2:01:40.680]  falsely reads kim young as sincere and believes his
[2:01:40.680 --> 2:01:44.520]  nuclear denuclearization then he continues to go
[2:01:44.520 --> 2:01:47.240]  down that path and almost nothing can stop him
[2:01:47.240 --> 2:01:50.920]  we're at a junction where trump has turned back from the brink of war on a
[2:01:50.920 --> 2:01:55.000]  ramp if we can get the proper information as i've
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:58.760]  outlined in today's world affairs brief on all the false flag
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:02.760]  proofs that can get to him and what this provocation about the drone was all
[2:02:02.760 --> 2:02:06.200]  about if this kind of information you get to donald trump
[2:02:06.200 --> 2:02:10.280]  we can get him on a track where he starts to back up his decision not to go
[2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:14.120]  to war and get on that bandwagon and then we've got him
[2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:18.280]  charging ahead and slowly hopefully we can turn him around on the whole issue of
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:22.120]  iran being the bogeyman now ultimately alex he's got to get a briefing
[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:24.600]  sometime about the deep state and how they created
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:29.640]  terrorists how they created isis how they still use terrorism today and and
[2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:33.480]  it's not enough to say we've got people in the white house will accept this
[2:02:33.480 --> 2:02:37.240]  i don't think it's getting to trump yet because of the way he talks about a
[2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:40.760]  radical you saw him come out and say that hillary and obama
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:45.320]  founded isis he gets the briefings and it's not that he has a bad memory
[2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:49.640]  it's that he gets it and then he gets other stuff and then he gets and he
[2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:53.320]  knows all this i don't know i don't know how you would describe
[2:02:53.320 --> 2:02:56.680]  trump he's real sharp when you talk to him and he has a lot of energy
[2:02:56.680 --> 2:03:00.040]  but i just wonder sometimes because i used to hear this oh
[2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:03.480]  he goes with the last thing he heard i think oh that's left his propaganda
[2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:08.200]  no it's kind of true no he he really didn't say
[2:03:08.200 --> 2:03:11.880]  directly that obama and clinton funded funded isis what he now found that he
[2:03:11.880 --> 2:03:15.480]  said he said they were the founders of it no
[2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:19.160]  that's not what he meant you know in his loose way of speaking he was referring
[2:03:19.160 --> 2:03:23.080]  to the fact that uh that obama signed this iran
[2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:27.480]  agreement and he they did other things that allowed isis to grow up in this
[2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:32.440]  vacuum yes i'm not doing it but he does not know that our own deep state
[2:03:32.440 --> 2:03:35.960]  actually created isis by separating 50 percent of the
[2:03:35.960 --> 2:03:39.160]  syrian rebels and saying you're now called isis so we're gonna sure you're
[2:03:39.160 --> 2:03:42.200]  right overall on that you're correct but it's not splitting here but you're
[2:03:42.200 --> 2:03:44.600]  right let's expand on this in 60 seconds
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:47.480]  what do you make a trump making comments that they expunged off the internet
[2:03:47.480 --> 2:03:52.280]  on meet the press last week that he knows who really did 9 11
[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:55.320]  well i don't think he does know because it's not the government and that's who
[2:03:55.320 --> 2:03:59.560]  did 9 11 and uh that's not who's he's referring to
[2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:04.760]  uh so you know trump just doesn't have the basis
[2:04:04.760 --> 2:04:08.840]  to make informed decisions about the deep state he continues to prove that he
[2:04:08.840 --> 2:04:12.040]  doesn't by the way joe you've got to stay a
[2:04:12.040 --> 2:04:15.640]  few more minutes now because i've decided that when i cover
[2:04:15.640 --> 2:04:18.680]  9 11 and the fact that it wasn't inside job
[2:04:18.680 --> 2:04:22.040]  if we say that we've got to then do a five minute dissertation
[2:04:22.040 --> 2:04:25.560]  on the main anomalies of it because obviously i was the first to officially
[2:04:25.560 --> 2:04:28.840]  question it and all the rest of it and the people think we're blaming our
[2:04:28.840 --> 2:04:33.400]  country not criminal elements of the government uh and so i i i think that's
[2:04:33.400 --> 2:04:35.960]  important so can you do five more minutes and elaborate on why you're
[2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:39.000]  saying 9 11's an inside job i'll be happy to
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:41.880]  all right we'll come back and we'll have the floor for five minutes
[2:04:41.880 --> 2:04:45.560]  that means i'm gonna shut up because if i start getting to 9 11
[2:04:45.560 --> 2:04:49.640]  i mean it's i've made four films on it i've done the thousands of shows on it
[2:04:49.640 --> 2:04:55.960]  and it just gives me a headache it was an inside job but what is an inside job
[2:04:55.960 --> 2:04:59.640]  you know the worst part about getting old and i'm still strong at 45
[2:04:59.640 --> 2:05:02.520]  is that i won't be there for my children someday that's why i need to make them
[2:05:02.520 --> 2:05:06.840]  strong now now i can be there for my children now i can make them strong
[2:05:06.840 --> 2:05:11.000]  now i can instruct them now i can teach them what i've learned but not once i'm
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  gone you think of this digital age your words going
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:15.720]  forever but now they're even better getting rid of what you said they were
[2:05:15.720 --> 2:05:18.840]  before it's so much easier to burn video or
[2:05:18.840 --> 2:05:23.240]  text or languages now that we have high tech book burning isn't it but i have
[2:05:23.240 --> 2:05:28.200]  joined my will to the resistance i can't be destroyed now as long as i realize
[2:05:28.200 --> 2:05:31.240]  i've done right and the longer the people know the truth and you can't be
[2:05:31.240 --> 2:05:35.080]  destroyed either as long as you bind yourself to something and
[2:05:35.080 --> 2:05:39.160]  commit to it and go through the fire for it there is a magic that then takes
[2:05:39.160 --> 2:05:42.280]  place the transcend space and time when you commit
[2:05:42.280 --> 2:05:46.040]  be a word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos that
[2:05:46.040 --> 2:05:49.720]  overrides everything the enemy's doing so please now
[2:05:49.720 --> 2:05:54.120]  commit to support info wars however you can and realize your provision to info
[2:05:54.120 --> 2:06:05.640]  wars is your own provision
[2:06:07.800 --> 2:06:11.800]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to god
[2:06:11.800 --> 2:06:17.400]  it's alex johns thomas jeverson said that
[2:06:17.400 --> 2:06:21.320]  that's true he also said the only thing that evil men in
[2:06:21.320 --> 2:06:24.360]  tyrosy to flourish is a good man do nothing well jules
[2:06:24.360 --> 2:06:28.440]  scousen is a really smart former net naval aviator
[2:06:28.440 --> 2:06:32.360]  the top expert in the world on secure homes best-selling author
[2:06:32.360 --> 2:06:35.640]  and his whole family are full of a lot of great folks like jules scousen's
[2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:39.960]  uncle clion scousen that was head of the fbi uh in utah
[2:06:39.960 --> 2:06:43.800]  and uh wrote the naked communists the naked capitalists that was the blueprint
[2:06:43.800 --> 2:06:47.880]  for berry goldwater than ron paul and the whole resistance
[2:06:47.880 --> 2:06:51.000]  uh that we now have today he was dead on john bird society all of it
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:58.120]  great people uh really uh the uh blood of freedom and resistance to this
[2:06:58.120 --> 2:07:02.200]  and so we don't say 9-11's an inside job to put down america or we hate the
[2:07:02.200 --> 2:07:06.040]  american flag no ladies and gentlemen we say that
[2:07:06.040 --> 2:07:12.360]  because criminal elements are working with radical islam in a dialectic
[2:07:12.360 --> 2:07:15.400]  to invade the middle east to destabilize it to then collapse your
[2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:19.000]  exporters they want the middle east to fail not to stop islam
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:23.160]  but to radicalize it and collapse it further they need to be attacked
[2:07:23.160 --> 2:07:27.240]  so they have an ethos to attack us so since you mentioned it joe
[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:30.120]  you can have five minutes ten minutes whatever amount of time you want from a
[2:07:30.120 --> 2:07:33.000]  guy that's landed on the decks of aircraft carriers and from a guy that's
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:35.720]  a smart fellow and who's written a lot of material that's
[2:07:35.720 --> 2:07:39.400]  proven to be accurate when we say inside job what do we mean
[2:07:39.400 --> 2:07:44.440]  when trump says i know who did it i may bring it out he was on television
[2:07:44.440 --> 2:07:48.200]  two days after 9-11 we played this clip in fact when we post this later
[2:07:48.200 --> 2:07:52.120]  uh to info wars dot com we're not live we'll add the two or three shows
[2:07:52.120 --> 2:07:55.960]  cnn local news where he said there were bombs in the buildings they blew them
[2:07:55.960 --> 2:07:59.640]  up actually trump does know who did it
[2:07:59.640 --> 2:08:03.480]  he just i don't think he's ready to give out the specifics
[2:08:03.480 --> 2:08:07.000]  uh but when he says you know that hillary found that isis you're right
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:10.840]  they're saying out of the iran deal but when you say 9-11's an inside job
[2:08:10.840 --> 2:08:14.600]  joe scousen editor-in-chief at worldoffirstbrief.com
[2:08:14.600 --> 2:08:19.640]  what do you mean quantify that but when i looked at 9-11 in detail i began to
[2:08:19.640 --> 2:08:23.480]  realize immediately there are many many things here that the terrorists
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:26.520]  could not simply have done if they were ordinary terrorists
[2:08:26.520 --> 2:08:31.320]  for example as a pilot i know that a terrorist training on a sesna aircraft
[2:08:31.320 --> 2:08:34.680]  wouldn't even know how to turn off the autopilot and take control of the
[2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:37.880]  airplane he wouldn't know how to drive that airplane
[2:08:37.880 --> 2:08:41.960]  over and you have to be a pilot to realize how big the east coast is from
[2:08:41.960 --> 2:08:45.960]  the midwest to drive that airport and find new york would be an impossibility
[2:08:45.960 --> 2:08:50.280]  without the navigation system and it takes three to six months to learn how
[2:08:50.280 --> 2:08:54.440]  to do all of these electronic glass cockpit uh procedures
[2:08:54.440 --> 2:08:57.720]  there's no way that a terrorist with minimal training it couldn't even fly
[2:08:57.720 --> 2:09:00.360]  assessment is going to be able to control those airplanes
[2:09:00.360 --> 2:09:05.640]  as a pilot for 9-11 truth as a member we had access to the radar tapes for
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:08.120]  example showing that these airplanes that took off from
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:12.680]  boston logan airport rendezvoused with other airplanes from the west coast
[2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:17.560]  which i believe were military aircraft drone controlled computer
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:22.040]  controlled aircraft that were loaded with equipment and explosives to be able
[2:09:22.040 --> 2:09:27.320]  to fly those into the tower but those aircraft that took off did not in fact
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:30.440]  return and fly into that and the same thing happened with
[2:09:30.440 --> 2:09:35.960]  the flight 77 that flew into the pentagon for example there's
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:38.920]  evidence abundant evidence that there had to have been a missile on that
[2:09:38.920 --> 2:09:41.800]  airplane and terrorists could not have put the missile on
[2:09:41.800 --> 2:09:46.120]  because there was a hole in that airplane when it crashed into the pentagon
[2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:49.720]  now it exceeded the g forces that were capable of that airplane unless it was
[2:09:49.720 --> 2:09:53.480]  beat up with stronger engines that means it had to be a military style
[2:09:53.480 --> 2:09:58.600]  aircraft painted to look like an american airline's
[2:09:58.600 --> 2:10:02.840]  you know aircraft but one of the key witnesses who saw that
[2:10:02.840 --> 2:10:07.880]  aircraft crashed into the pentagon said he saw the airplane crumple up
[2:10:07.880 --> 2:10:12.200]  onto the wall the wall held up like a champ and then the aircraft exploded
[2:10:12.200 --> 2:10:15.880]  into a thousand pieces and that tells you that that
[2:10:15.880 --> 2:10:20.040]  airplane was loaded with explosives that's why there were only confetti-sized
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:25.400]  pieces around the pentagon it wasn't that the crash itself would do that
[2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:27.880]  in fact one of the key elements if you look at the
[2:10:27.880 --> 2:10:31.880]  debris that was found inside the pentagon was half of a radome
[2:10:31.880 --> 2:10:35.720]  now that's the fiberglass nose of an aircraft which hadn't
[2:10:35.720 --> 2:10:40.200]  hit an intact wall of the pentagon would have shattered into a thousand pieces
[2:10:40.200 --> 2:10:44.440]  to have half of that radome inside the pentagon means
[2:10:44.440 --> 2:10:48.520]  that there had to be a hole in that wall before that airplane crashed
[2:10:48.520 --> 2:10:52.040]  and no terrorists could have put a missile on that airplane
[2:10:52.040 --> 2:10:56.760]  no terrorists could have made the modification for example on the 767's
[2:10:56.760 --> 2:11:01.400]  which flew into the second the south tower which we all saw that bulging
[2:11:01.400 --> 2:11:06.520]  modification i called Boeing after that as a pilot and i said
[2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:09.720]  did you authorize that modification on the Boeing
[2:11:09.720 --> 2:11:13.800]  that aircraft that hit the tower knowing as an f4 pilot that every
[2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:17.080]  modification we did in the military did that had to be signed off by the
[2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:21.640]  manufacturer and boeing said we didn't do it
[2:11:21.640 --> 2:11:25.320]  now this spokesman did not deny that there was no bulge on the air they just
[2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:29.480]  said we didn't do that modification so boeing was
[2:11:29.480 --> 2:11:33.320]  acknowledging to me that they had actually modified that aircraft
[2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:37.160]  every pilot does a walk around the aircraft at least the copilot does and
[2:11:37.160 --> 2:11:39.960]  i know you're going into areas where you're an expert as a naval pilot and
[2:11:39.960 --> 2:11:43.080]  the famous pilot and then got it survived a crash nobody else wouldn't
[2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:46.840]  in all the rest of it but what about building 7 with the CIA and FBI and at
[2:11:46.840 --> 2:11:50.120]  47 stories tall they say on the news it's collapsed
[2:11:50.120 --> 2:11:53.960]  in its own footprint an hour before it collapses 25 minutes before
[2:11:53.960 --> 2:11:57.080]  i mean and then i interviewed the head of emergency management deputy head
[2:11:57.080 --> 2:11:59.880]  who they said died a week after he was on the show but really
[2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:03.080]  they witnessed relocated him for national security reasons i mean they
[2:12:03.080 --> 2:12:06.360]  blew that sucker up they had a countdown i've talked to the cops that were
[2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:10.840]  there who heard the FEMA countdown to blow it up
[2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:15.480]  exactly true all of these buildings the towers one and two and building seven
[2:12:15.480 --> 2:12:19.240]  came down with controlled demolition it was a much more sophisticated on
[2:12:19.240 --> 2:12:23.320]  towers one and two uh it's very obvious if you read the your
[2:12:23.320 --> 2:12:26.920]  audience listens to the tape recordings and the material from architects for
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:30.360]  9 11 truth the case is an absolute slam dunk
[2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:35.320]  that these towers resisted and did not collapse because of the aircraft crashing
[2:12:35.320 --> 2:12:39.160]  into them they were they were taken down by controlled demolition
[2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:42.760]  and building seven is so obvious the controlled definition and it shows for
[2:12:42.760 --> 2:12:47.560]  example how the united states had power over the national institute of
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:50.920]  technology or a mist that they actually got these
[2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:55.720]  certified engineers to falsely say that the building came down without controlled
[2:12:55.720 --> 2:12:59.160]  demolition now that shows how much power the deep state had
[2:12:59.160 --> 2:13:01.960]  but when you go through all of these things including dick cheney in the
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:05.240]  situation in the room in the winehouse telling this air force officer
[2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:09.080]  the orders still stand meaning you cannot interdict this airplane and we know
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:14.120]  that from the head of uh department transportation and other witnesses
[2:13:14.120 --> 2:13:18.040]  that's right who were there in the in the white house or in the situation room
[2:13:18.040 --> 2:13:21.000]  and saw cheney whipping his head around said have you
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:25.240]  the orders changed no they have not changed you know let that airplane hit
[2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:28.600]  the pen it's a hundred miles out it's 50 miles out it's 20 miles out sir the
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:32.760]  order still changed have i didn't tell you they changed you there was a stand
[2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:36.440]  down there was a stand down and much of the
[2:13:36.440 --> 2:13:41.240]  of course they were you know
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:44.280]  scenarios going on where they had airplanes in the air
[2:13:44.280 --> 2:13:47.320]  doing dive bombing at the white house telling nato that these are all
[2:13:47.320 --> 2:13:50.920]  controlled exercises you're not to interdict into these aircraft
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:54.280]  all of this could not have been done by the terrorists loading those buildings
[2:13:54.280 --> 2:13:57.880]  with explosives sure what about flight 93 the word is because we even know they
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:00.920]  gave them awards and it came out the audio tapes from
[2:14:00.920 --> 2:14:05.160]  norad they said they put two aim nines in the flight 93 which would be a
[2:14:05.160 --> 2:14:09.560]  sidewalker well that's right in fact i was
[2:14:09.560 --> 2:14:16.600]  listening to the f a tapes as a pilot and i heard the united f a calling for
[2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:22.120]  flight 93 which wasn't responding and flight united flight in the central f
[2:14:22.120 --> 2:14:25.640]  a sector said we have this aircraft in sight
[2:14:25.640 --> 2:14:29.080]  and we'll try to contact they tried to contact there was nothing and then
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:33.720]  suddenly you see on the tape recording it says this is a hijacking etc and
[2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:38.040]  there's a bomb on board and apparently the hijacker was
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:42.280]  keying the microphone transmitting when he thought he was talking on the intercom
[2:14:42.280 --> 2:14:46.360]  and the united pilots heard it and then the united pilots said to the
[2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:50.360]  controllers this airplane just exploded there was a bomb
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:54.040]  or something that went on board and they saw the explosion but the airplane did
[2:14:54.040 --> 2:14:58.520]  not go down and it kept flying but they saw an actual
[2:14:58.520 --> 2:15:04.040]  explosion on on board well airplane flight 93 did not crash in
[2:15:04.040 --> 2:15:06.840]  shanksville the amount of debris there is not
[2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:11.000]  consistent with any large aircraft flying it was never recovered that degree
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:14.040]  in fact one witness and so here's the problem you just did like eight nine
[2:15:14.040 --> 2:15:17.400]  minutes we can go for 10 days i know you've got things to do
[2:15:17.400 --> 2:15:20.440]  and it's important we should make a whole new film in retrospect
[2:15:20.440 --> 2:15:24.920]  about 9 11 the final autopsy or something because you can go on for days
[2:15:24.920 --> 2:15:30.040]  and what was the real target of that everything why don't you come back on
[2:15:30.040 --> 2:15:33.640]  in the next few weeks and we'll do two hours you and i
[2:15:33.640 --> 2:15:37.160]  uh we'll kind of map it out on 9 11 how's that sound
[2:15:37.160 --> 2:15:40.520]  good maybe we can do that in studio sometime well hey i'll fly you here
[2:15:40.520 --> 2:15:42.840]  whenever you're ready you name the time we'll fly it

[2:20:54.760 --> 2:20:58.200]  i've been preoccupied obviously covering the iran crisis
[2:20:58.200 --> 2:21:02.440]  because that could end human life on this planet pretty quick
[2:21:02.440 --> 2:21:05.560]  and i've got a bunch of other huge breaking stories here
[2:21:05.560 --> 2:21:08.920]  that are up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com but i want to hear from
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:13.400]  you specifically about what what do you think trump should do
[2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:18.360]  concerning iran i don't like the mollus i'd like to see the regime change but
[2:21:18.360 --> 2:21:23.800]  clearly israel saudi arabia want us to do their dirty work
[2:21:23.800 --> 2:21:27.560]  and iran is not iraq they've got a lot of high-tech weapons they've got sleeper
[2:21:27.560 --> 2:21:30.840]  cells this is going to get really bad they block
[2:21:30.840 --> 2:21:34.440]  that straight up hormones it's going to kill the recovery
[2:21:34.440 --> 2:21:38.120]  people the left is maneuvering here's the key element to say
[2:21:38.120 --> 2:21:44.920]  the left is maneuvering that trump saying the nuclear deal is bad
[2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:49.320]  is causing iran to do all this stuff while they engage in provocations
[2:21:49.320 --> 2:21:53.000]  so they're maneuvering him to say oh you you you broke the nuclear deal that was
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:58.440]  a scam by clinton carry obama and so then when
[2:21:58.440 --> 2:22:01.160]  there's a big war they're going to blame trump on top of it
[2:22:01.160 --> 2:22:05.480]  and and trump knows he's being maneuvered into that okay
[2:22:06.760 --> 2:22:10.200]  but still they're going to continue to do it you heard jill scowls and he's
[2:22:10.200 --> 2:22:15.640]  accurate about 98 percent of the time just like we are
[2:22:15.640 --> 2:22:17.960]  he's been wrong about a few things he admits to it
[2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:21.400]  he thought we were going to war with uh north korea because trump was very
[2:22:21.400 --> 2:22:25.400]  serious about it but north korea backed down some but then it's now been
[2:22:25.400 --> 2:22:30.680]  welshing on that deal but hey do i want war with north korea and i get the fact
[2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:33.160]  you don't want nuclear weapons to proliferate but it was the clinton's
[2:22:33.160 --> 2:22:37.640]  that gave all the missile secrets out and the icbm technology
[2:22:37.640 --> 2:22:43.320]  and and the merb technology the reentry delivery devices
[2:22:43.320 --> 2:22:48.120]  so yeah this is a very very very very very very very very dangerous time
[2:22:48.120 --> 2:22:51.800]  and i want to take your calls on it where do you think it's going what's your
[2:22:51.800 --> 2:22:55.160]  gut level tell you specifically on iran

[2:23:01.560 --> 2:23:06.440]  subject 877-789-2539

[2:23:20.200 --> 2:23:23.160]  hezbollah sleeper cells all over europe and the us
[2:23:23.160 --> 2:23:26.040]  shiites aren't like a fake foe army like the
[2:23:26.040 --> 2:23:31.000]  wahhabist and you've got all the rest of this going on
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:34.040]  they're in bed with the democrats there's just a lot of double crossing
[2:23:34.040 --> 2:23:38.200]  and trump is right to stay out of that war
[2:23:38.840 --> 2:23:43.640]  to stay out of that war stay out of that war stay out of that war because they
[2:23:43.640 --> 2:23:47.160]  want to get everybody over a barrel
[2:23:48.280 --> 2:23:52.840]  in other news kit daniels writes for news wars dot com
[2:23:52.840 --> 2:23:57.480]  please get the story out jesse smallett could face new charges as special

[2:24:07.080 --> 2:24:11.240]  the more we keep them for worse than this that pisses the globalist off because
[2:24:11.240 --> 2:24:17.400]  people get reminded of all this hoaxing look i love everybody
[2:24:17.400 --> 2:24:22.600]  i'm a christian and it's not just a name i i have an ethos of loving
[2:24:22.600 --> 2:24:26.200]  black people loving white people loving hispanic loving humans
[2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:31.640]  but let's not lie to ourselves i grew up in dallas texas
[2:24:31.640 --> 2:24:35.640]  where i don't know about 20 percent of black people
[2:24:35.640 --> 2:24:39.080]  are the most fulminate the mouth racist you've ever
[2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:42.760]  seen you might go over with your football buddy and his mama makes you the
[2:24:42.760 --> 2:24:47.960]  best you know southern cooking you ever got northerners call it soul food and
[2:24:47.960 --> 2:24:50.440]  make a big thing about it it's just southern cooking
[2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:54.920]  but then when you're walking home a couple black dudes try to kill you
[2:24:54.920 --> 2:24:59.000]  because you're a white cracker so the fact that black people the only ones
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:04.440]  ever got attacked is a load of crap and if you think there's really
[2:25:04.440 --> 2:25:07.800]  white people in chicago at 2 30 at night trying to beat up a
[2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:12.440]  black guy you're crazy any black guy i'll tell you
[2:25:12.440 --> 2:25:16.840]  number one problem black guys have in the cops
[2:25:17.960 --> 2:25:20.920]  some black guys may have chips on their shoulders about the cops and there's
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:25.560]  some bad cops out there i've run into them there's bad people period
[2:25:25.560 --> 2:25:30.680]  but everybody knows the truth ladies and gentlemen the statistics show it a
[2:25:30.680 --> 2:25:33.880]  black man's biggest problem is another black man
[2:25:33.880 --> 2:25:38.280]  now you think i like that no and i like those speakers that got booed
[2:25:38.280 --> 2:25:41.800]  at the reparations who are saying how about the democratic party
[2:25:41.800 --> 2:25:44.920]  that literally ran slavery how about you pay reparations
[2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:48.440]  you're actually an organization a corporation that existed then and
[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:51.640]  exist now not somebody's great great great great great great great great
[2:25:51.640 --> 2:25:54.280]  great great great great granddaddy they don't know who they are and they get a
[2:25:54.280 --> 2:25:59.560]  bill in the mail and you spend on that
[2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:05.000]  that's what it gets even crazier is you realize
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:08.680]  that the democratic party wants to totally and completely disenfranchise
[2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:11.000]  people
[2:26:12.360 --> 2:26:17.320]  and they want to open old wounds over and i'm not trying to keep black people
[2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:20.120]  from getting money
[2:26:20.200 --> 2:26:23.000]  i'm pointing out you're not going to get that money without a bunch of strings
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:27.480]  attached from these evil democrats the former nfl player he's the guy that
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:30.440]  really knocked it out of the park
[2:26:32.680 --> 2:26:39.720]  it's all reparations is a bunch of politicians teaching you how
[2:26:40.600 --> 2:26:44.040]  they're going to take care of you can't take care of yourself
[2:26:44.040 --> 2:26:48.280]  it's disgusting and it's a bunch of leaders who want to get part of that
[2:26:48.280 --> 2:26:52.440]  money that you're never going to see and again he pointed out it's a democratic
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:54.760]  party
[2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:59.880]  that made sure 40 plus percent of black babies never made it out of their mama
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:03.400]  that's why i've had left this so many years ago who thought i was a racist
[2:27:03.400 --> 2:27:05.800]  like them and i told you this stuff 20 years ago
[2:27:05.800 --> 2:27:08.440]  before was ever on tv i said listen i'll go to these
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:14.040]  planned parent events and i'll go to these uh deals and protest them
[2:27:14.040 --> 2:27:17.560]  and black people walk over before the age of cell phones
[2:27:17.560 --> 2:27:20.840]  who are usually the local managers for the white folks
[2:27:20.840 --> 2:27:24.200]  and white folks too and they'll go listen like i only want to say the things
[2:27:24.200 --> 2:27:27.000]  they say because the media will say i said them but you know what they say
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.240]  if you live in the black community you've been around these these managers
[2:27:29.240 --> 2:27:31.240]  these white people these black people that manage
[2:27:31.240 --> 2:27:36.040]  the other black people and they'll say listen trying to get rid of these people
[2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:39.560]  nobody wants these blah blah blah and now you see all the videos people saying
[2:27:39.560 --> 2:27:43.000]  it you see the abortion doctor saying that black abortion doctors asian
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:46.760]  abortion doctors going if we don't kill these black people
[2:27:46.760 --> 2:27:50.040]  now we have to kill them later black people are bad
[2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:52.280]  and it's like well yeah because you're setting up a system
[2:27:52.280 --> 2:27:55.160]  well that's geared to that and you're telling them they are and then you're
[2:27:55.160 --> 2:27:59.000]  filling them follow all this hate god you're nasty
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:02.120]  so they got so many chips on their shoulders they can't get a job at some
[2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:06.280]  business without looking for imaginary racism because you brainwashed them
[2:28:06.280 --> 2:28:12.840]  so damn bad look what you did to them how you pimped them
[2:28:12.840 --> 2:28:16.120]  it's like that HBO show about pimps and she's been run over she's been hit
[2:28:16.120 --> 2:28:19.320]  she's dying and she's like baby i'm gonna get back on the street i'm gonna go

[2:37:24.280 --> 2:37:29.320]  it came out that obama well we'll just tell people what you said then we'll
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:32.680]  play the clip and you were very clear we don't want anything to happen to obama
[2:37:32.680 --> 2:37:35.640]  that would turn him into a martyr we don't want anything to happen to them
[2:37:35.640 --> 2:37:39.320]  except the court of law they say trumps are
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:42.200]  involved in treason they all over the news said they want to kill him they
[2:37:42.200 --> 2:37:44.200]  say they're gonna shoot him they don't get in trouble
[2:37:44.200 --> 2:37:47.240]  we are calling for cooler hezboor fail we don't want
[2:37:47.240 --> 2:37:51.560]  violence but hubbington posts uh all of them
[2:37:51.560 --> 2:37:57.800]  info wars host calls obama treasonous ads find the tallest tree and rope so
[2:37:57.800 --> 2:38:02.280]  there you go oh and and now they're calling for you your name your face to
[2:38:02.280 --> 2:38:05.720]  be banned everywhere so they can do it and be clear
[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:09.160]  about it you can do it as part of a question saying we don't want him to
[2:38:09.160 --> 2:38:12.280]  get hurt but what is the punishment for treason tell
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:15.400]  us about it well normally i just kind of catch
[2:38:15.400 --> 2:38:19.160]  the the after flak of the target alex jumps
[2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:22.440]  and so normally i'm just kind of catching the flak that comes after alex
[2:38:22.440 --> 2:38:25.960]  takes the brute of it uh but now i'm definitely being targeted
[2:38:25.960 --> 2:38:30.040]  and i think they've well your average video when you were still on youtube at
[2:38:30.040 --> 2:38:32.040]  like 10 million views of course was scared of you
[2:38:32.040 --> 2:38:35.560]  well look like abraham lincoln my god the democrats fear
[2:38:35.560 --> 2:38:39.400]  abraham lincoln it's true that i i i did free the slaves the democrats hated me
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:42.040]  back then now they hate me again because i'm trying to free the people
[2:38:42.040 --> 2:38:46.200]  but they even quote in here what i actually said in some of these articles
[2:38:46.200 --> 2:38:50.120]  i say i'm not saying this should happen they even quote it but of course they
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:52.520]  run the headline but so now i'm definitely a target alex
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:55.480]  jones and shell porn actually they sent it to him yeah exactly the bottom
[2:38:55.480 --> 2:38:58.760]  pair headline because they know everybody reads the headline but i think
[2:38:58.760 --> 2:39:01.720]  that they've tied it out alex because they hit me with a twitter suspension
[2:39:01.720 --> 2:39:06.440]  about 48 hours ago or now and before this before this so boom they hit me with
[2:39:06.440 --> 2:39:10.200]  a twitter suspension and then they published dozens of articles on
[2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:13.560]  inquisitor newsweek having to pose yahoo shares it and everything
[2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:16.840]  and it's all perfectly timed out i'm sure it's not a coincidence
[2:39:16.840 --> 2:39:20.760]  and again though we can play the clip on subscribe star and this is like listen
[2:39:20.760 --> 2:39:23.560]  we're barely getting the funding to keep going we appreciate everybody i'm
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:26.200]  getting all the hosts of people to start their own subscribe stars to start your
[2:39:26.200 --> 2:39:30.120]  own websites and you get enough money your own crew your own companies the
[2:39:30.120 --> 2:39:33.960]  answers i've gotten paul to finally get it is to replicate is to expand
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:37.880]  so they can get other people online subscribe star.com forward slash alex
[2:39:37.880 --> 2:39:41.560]  jones make a donation that way we get 95% of the money not 20%
[2:39:41.560 --> 2:39:45.320]  like we sell a product at such slow prices so this is why
[2:39:45.320 --> 2:39:48.920]  obviously we do have to support ourselves within four store and we are
[2:39:48.920 --> 2:39:51.800]  launching new things because we know we're a target for destruction we don't
[2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:55.480]  want the mother my god i mean yeah yeah no we're fighting so
[2:39:55.480 --> 2:39:58.120]  far we've handled two and a half years of this but
[2:39:58.120 --> 2:40:01.400]  the truth is we have children because we know we're not going to live forever we
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:05.080]  love humanity it's the same thing so i can say that people like oh and paul
[2:40:05.080 --> 2:40:08.520]  watson are not my biological children but in a way i've been a mentor you've
[2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:11.000]  also helped me been a mentor that's how it works but
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:13.880]  that that's what this is about so so but let's get back to your great evil
[2:40:13.880 --> 2:40:17.000]  this light so let's let's let's go to the clip though because
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:20.840]  i made it very clear in my statement because we look we know what they say
[2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:23.720]  about trump they're just totally untethered they'll say anything
[2:40:23.720 --> 2:40:27.400]  i know that if i come out and i say something directly about obama that
[2:40:27.400 --> 2:40:30.360]  they'll attack me like this so i'm making sure to say no we don't want
[2:40:30.360 --> 2:40:32.920]  violence happen like you were saying we don't want obama to be a minor but
[2:40:32.920 --> 2:40:36.760]  they're engaged in treason wow so here's right yeah here's a clip
[2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:40.040]  folks obama was emailing hillary clinton on her illegal server
[2:40:40.040 --> 2:40:43.800]  under a secret name that came out in emails and he claimed that he didn't
[2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:48.280]  know she had it barack obama is a treasonous
[2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:51.080]  he belongs in jail he belongs in guantanamo bay
[2:40:51.080 --> 2:40:55.480]  yeah i mean you i mean look i'm not saying this should happen but barack
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:40:59.000]  obama you know find the tallest tree in a rope
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:04.120]  new clinton email review uh review reveals multiple security incidents
[2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:08.120]  again this is coming uh another judicial watch dump
[2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:12.600]  so that's that's the clip right there alex and i noticed most of the articles
[2:41:12.600 --> 2:41:15.080]  don't even have the video no none of them have the video
[2:41:15.080 --> 2:41:17.880]  so none of them they won't show where it's like when they said i call people
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:20.280]  jew boy they won't show it because i didn't say it
[2:41:20.280 --> 2:41:23.240]  and here's the point here's the context of the clip that they'll never actually
[2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:27.080]  cover barack obama committed treason
[2:41:27.080 --> 2:41:32.600]  that's your headline not not owin shroyer info wars host says obama committed
[2:41:32.600 --> 2:41:35.800]  treason no the headline is obama committed treason
[2:41:35.800 --> 2:41:39.640]  that's the headline alex they still don't get it
[2:41:39.640 --> 2:41:43.000]  so what do we call this video we post it up to info wars our own video streams
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:44.840]  that's right because they're trying to shut us down
[2:41:44.840 --> 2:41:49.640]  um i mean how do you like like like media hoax claims owin shroyer calls for
[2:41:49.640 --> 2:41:52.760]  obama to be hung well i've never i never said the words
[2:41:52.760 --> 2:41:56.200]  hang or lynched so those are the words that they're inserting into this story
[2:41:56.200 --> 2:41:59.960]  but again it even says you can look at this
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:05.960]  i'm not saying this should happen i'm not saying when we come back when we come
[2:42:05.960 --> 2:42:08.440]  back it gets even worse like i got some screenshots somewhere here here they
[2:42:08.440 --> 2:42:12.760]  are document cam shot place when we come back i'll show you all this
[2:42:12.760 --> 2:42:16.840]  for radio listeners go to info wars dot com we have a feed there you can see it
[2:42:16.840 --> 2:42:21.320]  ladies and gentlemen they even then they retweeted it to get you banned yeah they
[2:42:21.320 --> 2:42:26.440]  quote me on twitter with fake quotes was edited quotes so it's next level fraud
[2:42:26.440 --> 2:42:30.680]  i forgot about that aspect so now i get suspended from twitter for something i
[2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:34.360]  never said on twitter and the guy that put the exact quote of what i said not on
[2:42:34.360 --> 2:42:37.880]  twitter gets me suspended and he's still on twitter
[2:42:37.880 --> 2:42:41.400]  but there's no bias alex why are they coming after us so much
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:44.760]  the audience gets it because we're promoting americana we're defeating the
[2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:49.160]  globalists how do you defeat them spread it word of mouth the forbidden show

[2:47:26.600 --> 2:47:46.120]  so what is it the establishment on shroyer
[2:47:46.120 --> 2:47:50.920]  is so afraid of where they engage in all this and what are they building
[2:47:50.920 --> 2:47:54.120]  towards you know i know nationalism is
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:57.400]  exploding populism is exploding the globalists recognize that they can't
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:00.600]  stop it and i think trump means well overall
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:05.080]  he's been stopping these fake wars but if he doesn't take action against the
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:08.760]  censorship if he doesn't start breaking up big tech like he said he would do
[2:48:08.760 --> 2:48:13.000]  every week he waits they get more arrogant more out of control while paying
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:16.600]  him lip service oh my gosh i opened the phones up
[2:48:16.600 --> 2:48:20.200]  15 20 minutes ago we're gonna go to some calls starting here with carlos and
[2:48:20.200 --> 2:48:24.920]  johnny and todd and marcos and brandon and chase and and lou and steve we'll
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:28.280]  get to those calls and then the great nick baggots will take over about 15
[2:48:28.280 --> 2:48:31.240]  after next hour but oh and
[2:48:31.240 --> 2:48:36.360]  uh again it's not about us it's the fact that the lies
[2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:40.360]  like they even said that trump called off the attack
[2:48:40.360 --> 2:48:42.840]  when it turns out he didn't and i just thought well they wouldn't tell a
[2:48:42.840 --> 2:48:47.000]  whopper that big and then it wasn't true i mean it just a little and they go oh
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:51.400]  trops told you know 50 000 lies and then they're lying about that
[2:48:51.400 --> 2:48:57.160]  well i just hope that the boldness and the openness of these lies is waking
[2:48:57.160 --> 2:49:01.080]  people up to who these people really are they're not your friends and
[2:49:01.080 --> 2:49:04.440]  they're not honest people and you should not trust them for anything
[2:49:04.440 --> 2:49:08.200]  but i just look at what's happened to me here and you can see it's it's the same
[2:49:08.200 --> 2:49:10.680]  thing that they do to you alex where they say oh
[2:49:10.680 --> 2:49:14.520]  it's just a coincidence that twitter and facebook and instagram and youtube and
[2:49:14.520 --> 2:49:18.040]  everybody banned alex jones in the same week that's just a coincidence
[2:49:18.040 --> 2:49:21.320]  nothing to see here no collusion just like it's a coincidence that for the
[2:49:21.320 --> 2:49:24.280]  first time since i guess they think that they've totally destroyed you by
[2:49:24.280 --> 2:49:27.640]  faking news that you sent child porn i guess that they really thought that
[2:49:27.640 --> 2:49:30.280]  was going to bring you down they they figured that
[2:49:30.280 --> 2:49:33.960]  i'm not it's time to not just hit me with the flak that mrs alex jones and it
[2:49:33.960 --> 2:49:37.560]  just target me so they i'm already off facebook and youtube i've been banned
[2:49:37.560 --> 2:49:41.400]  there for a while but i still had twitter so they suspended me on twitter
[2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:45.080]  uh i had to double appeal i got suspended for a tweet that read
[2:49:45.080 --> 2:49:48.200]  what's the punishment for treason because that's what i'm covering in the
[2:49:48.200 --> 2:49:51.080]  segment that they're all freaking out about the fact that barack obama
[2:49:51.080 --> 2:49:53.720]  committed treason and i've got the us code right here
[2:49:53.720 --> 2:50:00.440]  18 us code subsection 2381 and the punishment for treason
[2:50:00.440 --> 2:50:04.360]  is death if you are guilty of treason you shall suffer death
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:09.080]  so that's just in the code so i'm just alluding to the fact that obama
[2:50:09.080 --> 2:50:11.880]  committed treason and that punishment for treason is death
[2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:15.960]  but i didn't say that on twitter this i won't even
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:19.480]  say this guy's name because he's so pathetic
[2:50:19.480 --> 2:50:23.560]  that i feel like i might might lower my iq and my vitality just by saying his
[2:50:23.560 --> 2:50:28.360]  name he actually quotes me on twitter what i
[2:50:28.360 --> 2:50:31.800]  never said on twitter he quotes what i said on twitter
[2:50:31.800 --> 2:50:36.360]  targets me for flagging and then i get suspended from twitter for a tweet that
[2:50:36.360 --> 2:50:40.040]  reads what's the punishment for treason but the guy who actually
[2:50:40.040 --> 2:50:44.520]  gives the exact quote of what i said which is what they're suspending me for
[2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:47.720]  doesn't get suspended now to answer the question about
[2:50:47.720 --> 2:50:50.840]  trump and big tech
[2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:54.680]  you know alex maybe he thinks he's so popular now with these rally numbers
[2:50:54.680 --> 2:50:58.280]  and everything he doesn't think he needs to address big tech but he needs to not
[2:50:58.280 --> 2:51:01.320]  think about it from getting himself reelected he's gonna do his damn job
[2:51:01.320 --> 2:51:04.520]  and which i know he says he's going after him i believe it but he'll give the
[2:51:04.520 --> 2:51:07.000]  orders they just ignore him they brag about that
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:10.520]  well the good news is josh hallie from missouri which by the way there are now
[2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:13.560]  zero abortion clinics in missouri that's right you're from missouri he was the
[2:51:13.560 --> 2:51:17.000]  first group for google years ago tell us about this badass so so hallie
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:20.200]  former attorney general i meant to talk about that more the other day because he
[2:51:20.200 --> 2:51:23.000]  says he's going after him and he's gonna strip 230 from him
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:26.120]  he's gonna do everything he can he's committed their immunity is what they
[2:51:26.120 --> 2:51:28.520]  live off of and so he's committed to using anything
[2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:31.960]  he can he comes from a legal background so he's gonna do anything he can try to
[2:51:31.960 --> 2:51:35.160]  break them up and now he's in congress and bringing
[2:51:35.160 --> 2:51:37.640]  this to the hill all the time he's not getting much help
[2:51:37.640 --> 2:51:40.200]  because he's one of the few that doesn't take money from these big tech
[2:51:40.200 --> 2:51:42.920]  companies by the way i meant to play that on monday i should have i should have
[2:51:42.920 --> 2:51:46.120]  played that but yeah if you want to get attacked do what josh hallie's doing he's
[2:51:46.120 --> 2:51:49.240]  got the big wave os but you can clearly see the collusion
[2:51:49.240 --> 2:51:52.040]  here alex i mean it's not a coincidence that i'm suspended from twitter and then
[2:51:52.040 --> 2:51:54.760]  they write dozens of headlines about me where they clearly
[2:51:54.760 --> 2:51:57.800]  aren't i mean they're not honest about what i said they're not putting the
[2:51:57.800 --> 2:52:00.280]  context into it and they're missing the headline which is bronco mama
[2:52:00.280 --> 2:52:02.440]  committed treason the punishment treason is death
[2:52:02.440 --> 2:52:05.960]  that's the headline but this is about now targeting
[2:52:05.960 --> 2:52:11.480]  so what do we call this interview though um
[2:52:11.480 --> 2:52:14.840]  we're gonna post this i mean the the the magnitude is
[2:52:14.840 --> 2:52:18.120]  you know msm hoax claims owens roger said hang obama
[2:52:18.120 --> 2:52:24.280]  that's not even the issue the thing is msm hoax distracts from obama's treason
[2:52:24.280 --> 2:52:28.840]  ignores obama's treason focuses on hating obama obama
[2:52:28.840 --> 2:52:33.240]  hanging story hoax no no no it's the the left
[2:52:33.240 --> 2:52:40.520]  are it media free media attacks free speech instead of treason by obama
[2:52:40.520 --> 2:52:43.480]  yeah it's but that's what these people are doing let's go for it let me show
[2:52:43.480 --> 2:52:46.440]  people this we're gonna go to phone calls who's right shotgun with me
[2:52:46.440 --> 2:52:50.440]  let me show people this this this this this ted cruise video
[2:52:50.440 --> 2:52:54.360]  again if you're two of you i'm showing you the youtube screenshot
[2:52:54.360 --> 2:53:00.040]  yesterday morning he goes on the washington post live feed
[2:53:00.040 --> 2:53:03.240]  talks trash about me says things i didn't say
[2:53:03.240 --> 2:53:06.040]  but then says i have a right to say it defense of first amendment okay i'll
[2:53:06.040 --> 2:53:09.800]  take that backhand in defense
[2:53:09.880 --> 2:53:13.960]  okay ted's beard looks good by the way he's getting a little fat though like me
[2:53:13.960 --> 2:53:20.280]  so the live feed has 49 viewers since then it has
[2:53:20.280 --> 2:53:25.560]  336 our video on info wars that we posted has like 20
[2:53:25.560 --> 2:53:28.360]  000 last time i checked so our own platform has 20 000
[2:53:28.360 --> 2:53:32.520]  views of ted cruise lives about alex jones but still defense free speech
[2:53:32.520 --> 2:53:37.400]  now every comment almost every comment
[2:53:37.400 --> 2:53:42.840]  is anti ted cruise so the whole washington post fun about jeff
[2:53:42.840 --> 2:53:46.280]  bezos has 300 something views after a huge
[2:53:46.280 --> 2:53:49.400]  conference and a huge fee they don't show the conference because nobody's
[2:53:49.400 --> 2:53:56.440]  there first comment by anthony lds
[2:53:56.440 --> 2:54:01.240]  says only crime he committed was getting a nationalist elected alex jones
[2:54:01.240 --> 2:54:05.480]  nothing wrong another commenter christ says
[2:54:05.480 --> 2:54:09.480]  at least one politician has some bleeping balls thank god almighty
[2:54:09.480 --> 2:54:14.120]  defending free speech so lying ted cruise just is mad at alex jones
[2:54:14.120 --> 2:54:18.600]  got done on trump elected as president not him but alex jones definitely helped
[2:54:18.600 --> 2:54:22.680]  lying ted hold on to his senate seat over
[2:54:22.680 --> 2:54:28.440]  robert orort from lying ted back to lying ted
[2:54:28.440 --> 2:54:33.800]  he's one hell of a liar folks this next person says he's right we should defend
[2:54:33.800 --> 2:54:37.000]  free speech amen not a fan of ted cruise from the
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:40.360]  perspective of being a democrat i'm a fan of him that he seems that he is a
[2:54:40.360 --> 2:54:44.360]  force for good the republican party and then it just goes on but most of
[2:54:44.360 --> 2:54:49.400]  the comments here uh are against him ted looked

[2:59:32.120 --> 2:59:35.720]  chess piece in this fight we're being used by god you're being used by god

[2:59:39.160 --> 2:59:49.080]  from the bottom of my heart info wars the most banned network in the world
[2:59:49.080 --> 2:59:54.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:54.520 --> 2:59:58.760]  breaking news out of silicon valley facebook has banned a number of prominent
[2:59:58.760 --> 3:00:02.040]  conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures facebook is
[3:00:02.040 --> 3:00:05.800]  purging several high-profile names from its platform this may be one of the
[3:00:05.800 --> 3:00:09.640]  biggest and most impactful decisions facebook has ever made facebook
[3:00:09.640 --> 3:00:13.240]  taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies alex jones mylo

[3:00:32.760 --> 3:00:36.360]  danger is my middle name dangerous like hurting other people
[3:00:36.360 --> 3:00:39.880]  or dangerous as in saying things that mark zuckerberg doesn't like
[3:00:39.880 --> 3:00:44.680]  this is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship how
[3:00:44.680 --> 3:00:47.640]  dangerous is info what is the difference at this point
[3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:51.800]  between trump's twitter feed and info wars dot com info wars tells viewers
[3:00:51.800 --> 3:00:55.080]  that the world is out to get them none of this seems to repel president
[3:00:55.080 --> 3:01:00.360]  trump info wars content is useful to him info wars personalities align with
[3:01:00.360 --> 3:01:03.800]  them i want them shut down i want them silence i want them muted i think
[3:01:03.800 --> 3:01:07.160]  they are horrible for our society i want them shut down
[3:01:07.160 --> 3:01:10.680]  i want them silenced i want them muted because these corporations
[3:01:10.680 --> 3:01:16.040]  are controlled by a liberal few we're very focused on making sure that our
[3:01:16.040 --> 3:01:20.360]  recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups
[3:01:20.360 --> 3:01:23.560]  where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content and
[3:01:23.560 --> 3:01:27.640]  we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist
[3:01:27.640 --> 3:01:32.280]  primarily do to violate our policies or or do things that are dangerous
[3:01:32.280 --> 3:01:35.960]  screw your rules your rules go against our values and they are patently
[3:01:35.960 --> 3:01:39.720]  unamerican mark zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions
[3:01:39.720 --> 3:01:43.960]  he's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have
[3:01:43.960 --> 3:01:48.200]  we need a digital fill of rise they're becoming the public square
[3:01:48.200 --> 3:01:51.720]  and they control how we interact with each other and if you think
[3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:54.120]  that you are going to throw up your hands and say well they're private
[3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:57.560]  companies you are absolutely insane and you are part of the problem
[3:01:57.560 --> 3:02:01.000]  you are a bad person you should be censored off the internet bad yes
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:04.760]  but get out of here alex info wars might have been banned from from twitter but
[3:02:04.760 --> 3:02:07.080]  it seems to have found a new home over at trump's twitter feed
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:12.520]  president trump's furious reaction to facebook's action showcases that he is
[3:02:12.520 --> 3:02:18.760]  i'm sorry to say but info wars president info wars the most banned
[3:02:18.760 --> 3:02:23.880]  network in the world how dangerous is info wars
[3:02:23.880 --> 3:02:29.400]  the bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order
[3:02:29.400 --> 3:02:35.320]  it must be followed there's about four minutes between the order being given
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:39.720]  and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so
[3:02:39.720 --> 3:02:45.000]  as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:49.720]  attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious
[3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:54.680]  political economic and military responses they're voting for peace on
[3:02:54.680 --> 3:02:58.280]  planet earth if they vote for trump but if they vote for
[3:02:58.280 --> 3:03:04.840]  hillary it's war we came we saw he died
[3:03:04.840 --> 3:03:08.760]  with her you'll end up in world war three i want the iranians to know that if
[3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:13.400]  i'm the president we will attack iran right now senator for us to control
[3:03:13.400 --> 3:03:17.560]  all of the airspace in syria would require us to go to war
[3:03:17.560 --> 3:03:23.480]  against syria and russia the u.s. military has just raised the threat level
[3:03:23.480 --> 3:03:27.160]  to def con too meanwhile hillary clinton is still
[3:03:27.160 --> 3:03:32.360]  threatening russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further
[3:03:32.360 --> 3:03:35.880]  hacking it's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions
[3:03:35.880 --> 3:03:41.720]  of course not because she's really loud noise
[3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:44.280]  all right looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties
[3:03:44.280 --> 3:03:50.200]  we'll try to get leon back on in a few minutes
[3:03:50.360 --> 3:03:54.280]  when the president gives the order it must be
[3:03:54.280 --> 3:04:19.880]  followed
[3:04:19.880 --> 3:04:33.560]  Infowars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen
[3:04:33.560 --> 3:04:54.400]  Schreuer in ForWars.com forward slash show.
[3:04:54.400 --> 3:04:58.880]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with
[3:04:58.880 --> 3:05:04.280]  the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[3:05:04.280 --> 3:05:11.520]  The false claim that you purposely said kitty porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous
[3:05:11.520 --> 3:05:13.360]  as well as false.
[3:05:13.360 --> 3:05:14.360]  It's a smear.
[3:05:14.360 --> 3:05:18.120]  If somebody sends you something that's encrypted, you don't even open it.
[3:05:18.120 --> 3:05:22.800]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents and then it's blamed on
[3:05:22.800 --> 3:05:23.800]  you.
[3:05:23.800 --> 3:05:24.800]  This is Kafkaesque.
[3:05:24.800 --> 3:05:25.800]  This is bizarre.
[3:05:25.800 --> 3:05:32.000]  But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say, Jones sent kitty porn is really outrageous.
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:37.080]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected
[3:05:37.080 --> 3:05:38.080]  and clarified.
[3:05:38.080 --> 3:05:39.680]  But I wonder where are the big boys?
[3:05:39.680 --> 3:05:40.920]  Where's the Wall Street Journal?
[3:05:40.920 --> 3:05:41.920]  Where's Associated Press?
[3:05:41.920 --> 3:05:46.920]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was
[3:05:46.920 --> 3:05:47.920]  inaccurate?
[3:05:47.920 --> 3:05:52.920]  So we both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support Infowars with your
[3:05:52.920 --> 3:05:53.920]  dollars.
[3:05:53.920 --> 3:06:00.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:06:00.640 --> 3:06:02.360]  You want to stop tyranny?
[3:06:02.360 --> 3:06:03.920]  Well so does he.
[3:06:03.920 --> 3:06:09.240]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:09.240 --> 3:06:23.440]  So they claim Ellen Schreuer wants to kill Obama, didn't say it.
[3:06:23.440 --> 3:06:26.680]  They claim I lost a lawsuit this week for writing a book about Sandy Hook, never wrote
[3:06:26.680 --> 3:06:29.040]  the book, not in it.
[3:06:29.040 --> 3:06:30.600]  They claim I sent child porn.
[3:06:30.600 --> 3:06:34.840]  Paul Watson's got the article going up here in just a few minutes to Infowars.com where
[3:06:34.840 --> 3:06:38.000]  the FBI says I'm the victim and the letter.
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:43.880]  But that's how these people operate and their lies and their propaganda just get worse and
[3:06:43.880 --> 3:06:48.000]  worse and worse by the minute.
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:50.920]  This is the time we live in and I just got a call from Norm Patis calling over and over
[3:06:50.920 --> 3:06:52.680]  again.
[3:06:52.680 --> 3:06:57.200]  So we need to check on all the Infowars' comments.
[3:06:57.200 --> 3:07:01.120]  Judge Bellis up there says she got called by the state police.
[3:07:01.120 --> 3:07:07.800]  She got called by the FBI that someone on Infowars made death threats at her.
[3:07:07.800 --> 3:07:15.200]  And of course, that's going to be comments by you know who, our little friends.
[3:07:15.200 --> 3:07:20.800]  Remember the internal documents came out a few months ago before I got banned on Facebook?
[3:07:20.800 --> 3:07:22.720]  Democratic Party?
[3:07:22.720 --> 3:07:23.720]  Business Insider?
[3:07:23.720 --> 3:07:28.200]  They said, hey, some of the comments on Alex Jones' Facebook page that he still has his
[3:07:28.200 --> 3:07:31.400]  personal one that you didn't ban.
[3:07:31.400 --> 3:07:35.680]  They say that Alex Jones lets anti-semitic comments happen.
[3:07:35.680 --> 3:07:40.480]  The internal documents showed 4% of the comments in an article were anti-semitic as if that's
[3:07:40.480 --> 3:07:41.480]  my fault.
[3:07:41.480 --> 3:07:43.480]  They said, well, the threshold's 30%.
[3:07:43.480 --> 3:07:49.840]  And then the big Democratic Party lobbying groups all hit all of the pages with anti-semitic
[3:07:49.840 --> 3:07:53.120]  comments, and the pages were all taken down.
[3:07:53.120 --> 3:07:58.200]  And I was certified a hate figure because of the comments.
[3:07:58.200 --> 3:07:59.760]  So that's a pretty simple thing.
[3:07:59.760 --> 3:08:00.760]  Email somebody child porn.
[3:08:00.760 --> 3:08:01.760]  They don't open it.
[3:08:01.760 --> 3:08:04.200]  They're child porn purveyor.
[3:08:04.200 --> 3:08:08.120]  Make some anti-Jewish comments on somebody's Facebook commenter.
[3:08:08.120 --> 3:08:10.800]  We gon' ban your butt forever.
[3:08:10.800 --> 3:08:13.800]  That's the left, folks.
[3:08:13.800 --> 3:08:16.600]  But this is them and their death throes.
[3:08:16.600 --> 3:08:18.840]  Everybody's emptying out of the blue cities.
[3:08:18.840 --> 3:08:21.200]  Everybody's emptying out of their states.
[3:08:21.200 --> 3:08:22.200]  Everyone's turning against them.
[3:08:22.200 --> 3:08:23.520]  Look at this shot here.
[3:08:23.520 --> 3:08:30.160]  I've got a call here from the Daily Beast.
[3:08:30.160 --> 3:08:35.640]  Doing a story on Judge Bellis saying the FBI contacted her about debt threats made against
[3:08:35.640 --> 3:08:37.600]  her on the implore site.
[3:08:37.600 --> 3:08:42.000]  I'm guessing this refers to anonymous commenters, not any actual implores, employees, but wanted
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:44.520]  to reach out in case you wanted to comment.
[3:08:44.520 --> 3:08:47.520]  And you know what the headline's gonna be.
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:53.040]  Jones and his followers after, just like they lie and say, I sent people up to Sandy Hook
[3:08:53.040 --> 3:08:54.440]  to investigate 9-11.
[3:08:54.440 --> 3:09:01.360]  It's these lawyers and these Democrats that live off of Sandy Hook.
[3:09:01.360 --> 3:09:09.640]  I talked about it in Google Analytics 0, it's.023 or something.
[3:09:09.640 --> 3:09:12.360]  And that's with all the coverage.
[3:09:12.360 --> 3:09:15.360]  Can't stand it.
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:20.120]  It don't matter to them, though, because it's their baby.
[3:09:20.120 --> 3:09:24.800]  They squeeze so much money out of these dead kids, suing the hero dead teacher, suing him.
[3:09:24.800 --> 3:09:25.800]  It never ends.
[3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:28.120]  You know, he's taken over, but I promise to take your calls.
[3:09:28.120 --> 3:09:31.360]  Dr. Nick Beggus is ready to take over in the war room.
[3:09:31.360 --> 3:09:35.880]  But remember, every minute the show's on air, they can't stand it.
[3:09:35.880 --> 3:09:39.720]  And every minute you spread the word and say, hey, that forbidden show, the one you can't
[3:09:39.720 --> 3:09:42.200]  name, the one they don't want you to hear, hear what he's really saying.
[3:09:42.200 --> 3:09:46.840]  Learn why they're so scared, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[3:09:46.840 --> 3:09:51.360]  Because if they can't shut us down, they've thrown everything they've got at us, well,
[3:09:51.360 --> 3:09:53.640]  they're pretty worthless to the globalist, aren't they?
[3:09:53.640 --> 3:09:57.880]  That's why they're all going bankrupt.
[3:09:57.880 --> 3:10:01.680]  Carlos in Canada, then Chase and Johnny.
[3:10:01.680 --> 3:10:03.720]  Carlos, thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:10:03.720 --> 3:10:04.720]  Go ahead.
[3:10:04.720 --> 3:10:06.400]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[3:10:06.400 --> 3:10:12.640]  For a minute yesterday, I thought, when I heard that the attacks were going to be launched
[3:10:12.640 --> 3:10:19.240]  against Iran, I said, oh my God, there goes President Trump's Nobel Peace Prize.
[3:10:19.240 --> 3:10:22.320]  I believe today he has earned it.
[3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:26.000]  This decision was great, a great decision.
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:31.240]  Now he has to follow it with some other equally important decisions.
[3:10:31.240 --> 3:10:35.320]  One of them, I believe, because of circumstances and the time span and the threats that have
[3:10:35.320 --> 3:10:41.720]  been issued by Iran about enrichment of uranium and so on.
[3:10:41.720 --> 3:10:46.800]  So far, they have complied with an agreement that was signed, but not ratified by the United
[3:10:46.800 --> 3:10:50.760]  States Senator of Congress with Iran.
[3:10:50.760 --> 3:10:56.320]  But the European Union wants to work with Iran to maintain that agreement.
[3:10:56.320 --> 3:11:01.080]  And that agreement, as long as it's complied for 10 years, it gives the world an opportunity
[3:11:01.080 --> 3:11:07.240]  to look into better relationships in the Middle East all around.
[3:11:07.240 --> 3:11:15.080]  So I believe if President Trump was really wise in this instance, with all respect to
[3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:21.600]  the information he has that I don't have, I would suggest that he allow trust in the
[3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:29.240]  allies in Europe to keep the agreement with Iran going on while the United States thinks
[3:11:29.240 --> 3:11:38.440]  about proposals to renew and improve the existing agreement, not forcefully, but diplomatically
[3:11:38.440 --> 3:11:44.400]  by showing the reasons why 10 years is not enough or whatever could be renegotiated.
[3:11:44.400 --> 3:11:50.680]  I believe with all my heart that if those decisions are made, I believe that substance
[3:11:50.680 --> 3:11:52.600]  can be achieved in the Middle East.
[3:11:52.600 --> 3:11:59.640]  To many people, like Senator Schumer, we're celebrating the fact that they thought that
[3:11:59.640 --> 3:12:06.160]  they were going to get themselves a blockage of the streets of her moves, and like other
[3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:12.920]  journalists have written, the pipelines were going to flow through Saudi Arabia, to Israel,
[3:12:12.920 --> 3:12:14.680]  and so on to Europe.
[3:12:14.680 --> 3:12:21.800]  Well, those dreams have to be put aside because a world war is certainly in the making that
[3:12:21.800 --> 3:12:25.760]  is insisted upon.
[3:12:25.760 --> 3:12:26.760]  Those are really great points.
[3:12:26.760 --> 3:12:27.760]  God bless you, Carlos.
[3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:29.760]  I appreciate your call.
[3:12:29.760 --> 3:12:33.040]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lou in Arizona.
[3:12:33.040 --> 3:12:34.040]  You're on the air.
[3:12:34.040 --> 3:12:35.040]  Lou, thanks for holding.
[3:12:35.040 --> 3:12:36.040]  What do you think about the situation?
[3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:37.040]  Yeah, Alex.
[3:12:37.040 --> 3:12:44.440]  I wanted to point out that not anybody is really talking about Iran as one of the last
[3:12:44.440 --> 3:12:48.000]  industrial countries that's not part of like the global banking system.
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:49.000]  No, you're right.
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:53.880]  They're one of the last countries the globalists don't control that can actually produce industrial
[3:12:53.880 --> 3:12:54.880]  goods.
[3:12:54.880 --> 3:13:00.880]  Yeah, I mean, one of the ones is like North Korea, and North Korea is like right on the
[3:13:00.880 --> 3:13:05.560]  doorstep of China and has that protection in China, so they could, they could never put
[3:13:05.560 --> 3:13:10.560]  together, you know, to advance the globalist plan, they could never put together a UN invasion
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:15.440]  force like they did in the First Gulf War, but like to have a real threat to fight them.
[3:13:15.440 --> 3:13:19.520]  I think that's what they're setting up with Iran is that they, and why Trump is here doing
[3:13:19.520 --> 3:13:23.160]  this stable rattling and getting them, because I don't know if you heard this from like the
[3:13:23.160 --> 3:13:27.360]  Ayatollah about a month back, but he just said, he came out and said, there's not going
[3:13:27.360 --> 3:13:28.360]  to be any fighting for him.
[3:13:28.360 --> 3:13:32.080]  Well, that's, that's obvious playing of any smart person because it's like they're just
[3:13:32.080 --> 3:13:36.000]  going to get one over and killed completely if they, you know, he knows there's no wind
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:37.000]  to be had.
[3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:38.960]  It's like the whole world coming at him.
[3:13:38.960 --> 3:13:43.120]  But you have to, you're not the only person with power there, and it's like you do this
[3:13:43.120 --> 3:13:46.720]  stable rattling for a long period of time and get him like, you have to get him worked
[3:13:46.720 --> 3:13:50.720]  up slowly so that they know that a fight is coming, but they don't have anything else
[3:13:50.720 --> 3:13:51.720]  to do but fight.
[3:13:51.720 --> 3:13:55.680]  And so they need to rank it to put up a good fight against the whole United Nations army,
[3:13:55.680 --> 3:13:57.520]  and that's what Trump is there for.
[3:13:57.520 --> 3:14:02.480]  But don't make any mistake, we never, in a million years, let Trump lead such a force.
[3:14:02.480 --> 3:14:08.240]  It's going to be the next president and certainly a Democrat to lead that kind of like global
[3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:14.400]  force that's going to then, you know, be a platform to get into a greater control, greater
[3:14:14.400 --> 3:14:16.240]  layers of control of the global government.
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:17.480]  Well, that's definitely it.
[3:14:17.480 --> 3:14:22.800]  And you look at how Bush was bad, Bush Sr., but then the Clintons like tripled the sanctions,
[3:14:22.800 --> 3:14:26.800]  half million kids died, and Madeleine Albright said it was true, it was a good price to pay.
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:30.600]  These are bloodthirsty monsters when they shake their fingers at those of us in the
[3:14:30.600 --> 3:14:32.480]  press and call us fake news.
[3:14:32.480 --> 3:14:35.240]  These are conscious liars.
[3:14:35.240 --> 3:14:36.240]  Thank you so much, Lou.
[3:14:36.240 --> 3:14:39.960]  I'm going to get a few more calls in and then Dr. Nick Beggars has taken over.
[3:14:39.960 --> 3:14:46.000]  We've had a very tumultuous day, a lot of other news is going to be breaking on infowars.com,
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:52.320]  but they're definitely a year and a half out from this election or less making their move
[3:14:52.320 --> 3:14:53.320]  on info wars.
[3:14:53.320 --> 3:14:58.280]  So more than ever, download the shows, save them, and whatever they say about us in the
[3:14:58.280 --> 3:15:02.080]  future, they're able to shut us down, please defend us, folks, because they want to capture
[3:15:02.080 --> 3:15:09.880]  us as a symbol and then create a mutated straw man out of it that they can then run around
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:12.280]  and do terrible things in my name.
[3:15:12.280 --> 3:15:19.440]  They want to set us up, shut us down, put me in prison, that's their whole homeland
[3:15:19.440 --> 3:15:25.960]  show thesis, or say, amidst their plan, so they can then say horrible things in my name.
[3:15:25.960 --> 3:15:29.680]  And they're just already doing things that are just astronomically crazy.
[3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:34.000]  They're escalating against everybody really fast, which shows I believe they're getting
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:35.480]  ready to make their move on Trump.
[3:15:35.480 --> 3:15:38.080]  And I think this war where that ran was a big part of it.
[3:15:38.080 --> 3:15:42.080]  They wanted me off the air ahead of this war because they thought I would be against it.
[3:15:42.080 --> 3:15:44.880]  Well, a lot of folks are against it and nobody's buying it.
[3:15:44.880 --> 3:15:46.880]  So we're in a whole new ball game.
[3:15:46.880 --> 3:15:48.840]  Dr. Nick Beggars is coming up.
[3:15:48.840 --> 3:15:49.840]  A few more calls.
[3:15:49.840 --> 3:15:53.280]  Stay with us.

[3:17:27.720 --> 3:17:29.280]  I sued the IRS in one.

[3:19:52.680 --> 3:19:57.280]  We're not going to back down.
[3:19:57.280 --> 3:20:17.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:17.160 --> 3:20:22.400]  All right, the great Roger Nick Beggars coming up in the next segment.
[3:20:22.400 --> 3:20:24.840]  I appreciate him letting me and X a few segments here.
[3:20:24.840 --> 3:20:28.560]  I want to normally host the fourth hour of Fridays because we're got incredible stuff
[3:20:28.560 --> 3:20:32.840]  going on right now and I promise to take a few of your calls, but you know, his dad's
[3:20:32.840 --> 3:20:36.800]  the guy that freed up all the land for the people in Alaska, they took his airplane down
[3:20:36.800 --> 3:20:37.800]  for that.
[3:20:37.800 --> 3:20:41.680]  So, you know, doing the right thing gets expensive on people to do it, but that's how we got
[3:20:41.680 --> 3:20:42.680]  here.
[3:20:42.680 --> 3:20:43.680]  So I'm not a victim.
[3:20:43.680 --> 3:20:46.960]  I'm a target and it's getting crazy though.
[3:20:46.960 --> 3:20:50.440]  They're saying that Owen wants to kill Obama, all of the news, but not showing the clip.
[3:20:50.440 --> 3:20:52.400]  They're saying I'm doing all these horrible things.
[3:20:52.400 --> 3:20:55.480]  Even though we have the FBI letter saying I was the victim of somebody sending his child
[3:20:55.480 --> 3:21:00.160]  porn and then they knew right what to, you know, basically subpoena everything just magically
[3:21:00.160 --> 3:21:02.640]  when I'm sure it's all just a coincidence.
[3:21:02.640 --> 3:21:05.760]  Probably is it's, it's getting correct.
[3:21:05.760 --> 3:21:11.040]  They say I said Jew boy on air and I didn't and then you see the video and I don't say
[3:21:11.040 --> 3:21:12.040]  that.
[3:21:12.040 --> 3:21:19.360]  I say white shoe boys, white shoe boys, meaning Yale lawyers, that's the definition from
[3:21:19.360 --> 3:21:23.080]  Esquire, you first set it to 54.
[3:21:23.080 --> 3:21:27.240]  So they're going into overdrive because they're panicking.
[3:21:27.240 --> 3:21:32.000]  Let's go ahead and take calls who's been holding the longest here, Todd in Wyoming, you're
[3:21:32.000 --> 3:21:33.000]  on the air.
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:34.000]  Go ahead.
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  Hey Alex.
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:36.000]  Welcome.
[3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:37.000]  Hey Alex.
[3:21:37.000 --> 3:21:42.800]  I think Iran's an important topic, but I think is more important is that we, in the bleeding
[3:21:42.800 --> 3:21:47.200]  that's going on at Info Wars, I think you guys, I don't need to, you need to do like
[3:21:47.200 --> 3:21:53.320]  a raffle lottery that you guys can like sell a ticket because, you know, you're our Elvis,
[3:21:53.320 --> 3:21:54.320]  you know.
[3:21:54.320 --> 3:21:59.000]  I'll tell you what scares me when I really push hard for funds, we get enough in to keep
[3:21:59.000 --> 3:22:01.320]  going and I'd like to have reserves.
[3:22:01.320 --> 3:22:02.440]  So I mean, we're not just up here.
[3:22:02.440 --> 3:22:03.920]  Oh, we need help right now.
[3:22:03.920 --> 3:22:06.600]  It's crazy how enough comes in to keep operating.
[3:22:06.600 --> 3:22:11.520]  I feel a lot better to be able to focus more on news if we have a lot of extra capital.
[3:22:11.520 --> 3:22:16.240]  So just folks, please get your staple coffee and toothpaste at infoworshore.com and please
[3:22:16.240 --> 3:22:19.880]  support our local MNFM station because that's really the backbone they've tried to target
[3:22:19.880 --> 3:22:24.800]  unsuccessfully because conservative talk show owners and managers understand the leftist
[3:22:24.800 --> 3:22:27.520]  of BS.
[3:22:27.520 --> 3:22:28.520]  So thanks for the support.
[3:22:28.520 --> 3:22:30.840]  What's your view on Iran, my friend?
[3:22:30.840 --> 3:22:35.160]  Well, you know, like I was saying though, but like every two weeks I get paid.
[3:22:35.160 --> 3:22:38.120]  I buy product every two weeks.
[3:22:38.120 --> 3:22:41.600]  If you guys did a, you know, like a raffle lottery where the winner would get, you know,
[3:22:41.600 --> 3:22:45.160]  a big prize and get flowing down and get to be on your show.
[3:22:45.160 --> 3:22:46.760]  I think that would pump the info.
[3:22:46.760 --> 3:22:47.760]  Done.
[3:22:47.760 --> 3:22:52.280]  We should have a monthly raffle and everybody buys raffles.
[3:22:52.280 --> 3:22:53.440]  You've got like three winners.
[3:22:53.440 --> 3:22:58.560]  One person gets a original Alex Jones painting I do for you while you're here right in front
[3:22:58.560 --> 3:22:59.560]  of you.
[3:22:59.560 --> 3:23:02.440]  I thought the best painter, but and then you get to be on the show for 30 minutes and
[3:23:02.440 --> 3:23:06.960]  you know, whatever for the winner on the second place person, you know, gets a firearm
[3:23:06.960 --> 3:23:11.760]  or something, you know, delivered to the FFL dealer of their choice and the third place
[3:23:11.760 --> 3:23:16.040]  person gets us steak knives.
[3:23:16.040 --> 3:23:17.040]  Yeah.
[3:23:17.040 --> 3:23:18.040]  Yeah.
[3:23:18.040 --> 3:23:19.040]  Trump just needs, we just need to get out of Iran.
[3:23:19.040 --> 3:23:21.040]  We couldn't need to quit being in a world's police.
[3:23:21.040 --> 3:23:22.040]  It's bull crap.
[3:23:22.040 --> 3:23:23.040]  I agree, brother.
[3:23:23.040 --> 3:23:24.040]  Thanks for the call.
[3:23:24.040 --> 3:23:26.040]  Let's go ahead and talk to chase the Patriot in California.
[3:23:26.040 --> 3:23:27.040]  They're on the air.
[3:23:27.040 --> 3:23:28.040]  Chase.
[3:23:28.040 --> 3:23:29.040]  Alex, what a year.
[3:23:29.040 --> 3:23:30.040]  Hey, I want to get into first thanking you.
[3:23:30.040 --> 3:23:41.040]  I just celebrated my one year anniversary and you did the reporter challenge last year.
[3:23:41.040 --> 3:23:42.040]  Yes, sir.
[3:23:42.040 --> 3:23:45.280]  And when you were going through that, that's when they started hitting you just completely
[3:23:45.280 --> 3:23:48.120]  hardcore banning you everywhere.
[3:23:48.120 --> 3:23:51.840]  But I'm just continuing going and I just celebrated my one year anniversary.
[3:23:51.840 --> 3:23:52.960]  But thank you for that.
[3:23:52.960 --> 3:23:54.440]  I go live every night.
[3:23:54.440 --> 3:23:58.400]  But anyway, we're having a real power struggle right now in our government.
[3:23:58.400 --> 3:24:03.320]  And I want to talk about my representative, Congressman Nunez, who's sadly, he's been
[3:24:03.320 --> 3:24:05.520]  doing great against the deep state.
[3:24:05.520 --> 3:24:10.240]  But now, you know, when you see his connections to Saudi Arabia, it scares me.
[3:24:10.240 --> 3:24:13.840]  But on the other side, you have Rand Paul, who yesterday on the floor of the Senate
[3:24:13.840 --> 3:24:16.960]  was raising alarm, a very powerful speech.
[3:24:16.960 --> 3:24:17.960]  You know, there's an article.
[3:24:17.960 --> 3:24:18.960]  I saw that.
[3:24:18.960 --> 3:24:19.960]  I should have heard that.
[3:24:19.960 --> 3:24:20.960]  I meant to hear that.
[3:24:20.960 --> 3:24:21.960]  I forgot to send that to the crew.
[3:24:21.960 --> 3:24:26.880]  Yes, because if you remember back, February of this year, it was reported about, you
[3:24:26.880 --> 3:24:31.080]  know, the administration trying to push for Saudi nuclear deal.
[3:24:31.080 --> 3:24:33.400]  And that is something that should not be happening.
[3:24:33.400 --> 3:24:36.120]  And they are trying to arm Saudi Arabia.
[3:24:36.120 --> 3:24:39.520]  So again, it's this proxy war situation.
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:43.840]  And you know, I'm concerned because my own congressman, so I dug down deep into it.
[3:24:43.840 --> 3:24:46.480]  And there's this name that came up, Derek Harvey.
[3:24:46.480 --> 3:24:50.800]  It was actually fired from the National Security Council because he was the go-between.
[3:24:50.800 --> 3:24:52.960]  He was trying to set up the Saudi deal.
[3:24:52.960 --> 3:24:56.640]  And now he happens to be working in the office of Congressman Nunez.
[3:24:56.640 --> 3:24:58.760]  So my, you know, my alert is up.
[3:24:58.760 --> 3:24:59.760]  I'm very concerned.
[3:24:59.760 --> 3:25:04.520]  I've tried to actually ask Congressman Nunez about it, and he kind of just brushed me off.
[3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:06.360]  So it's alarming, Alec.
[3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:09.360]  Have you, have you remember hearing about that at all?
[3:25:09.360 --> 3:25:10.840]  Yes, I do.
[3:25:10.840 --> 3:25:13.520]  And you've also got Sean Hannity foaming at the mouth wanting war.
[3:25:13.520 --> 3:25:16.960]  And I like Sean, but, you know, just, this is not good.
[3:25:16.960 --> 3:25:17.960]  Wars are not good.
[3:25:17.960 --> 3:25:18.960]  We don't need this.
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:20.640]  They can really get out of control.
[3:25:20.640 --> 3:25:21.880]  Thank you so much, Chase.
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:24.200]  Yeah, it's just, it's just crazy.
[3:25:24.200 --> 3:25:29.240]  And remember, they want us off the air while they launch all this.
[3:25:29.240 --> 3:25:30.600]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[3:25:30.600 --> 3:25:34.880]  Let's take a few more calls here as fast as we can.
[3:25:34.880 --> 3:25:39.640]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[3:25:39.640 --> 3:25:40.640]  Marcus here on the air.
[3:25:40.640 --> 3:25:41.640]  Thanks for holding.
[3:25:41.640 --> 3:25:42.640]  Hey, Alex.
[3:25:42.640 --> 3:25:47.040]  Yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[3:25:47.040 --> 3:25:50.160]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City.
[3:25:50.160 --> 3:25:54.240]  And one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[3:25:54.240 --> 3:25:59.160]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[3:25:59.160 --> 3:26:04.840]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching
[3:26:04.840 --> 3:26:07.320]  2020.
[3:26:07.320 --> 3:26:08.320]  That's it.
[3:26:08.320 --> 3:26:10.960]  I think a war over there, they're going to sabotage him.
[3:26:10.960 --> 3:26:16.560]  They're going to, I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[3:26:16.560 --> 3:26:19.880]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[3:26:19.880 --> 3:26:23.360]  And he's done the right thing so far, but these provocations, these ships, and now
[3:26:23.360 --> 3:26:28.040]  this drone, it's, it's, it's a time to be praying, my friend.
[3:26:28.040 --> 3:26:29.040]  I agree entirely.
[3:26:29.040 --> 3:26:32.840]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[3:26:32.840 --> 3:26:35.840]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[3:26:35.840 --> 3:26:39.360]  Like even I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[3:26:39.360 --> 3:26:41.880]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[3:26:41.880 --> 3:26:45.480]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[3:26:45.480 --> 3:26:50.520]  You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[3:26:50.520 --> 3:26:51.920]  who are going to continue.
[3:26:51.920 --> 3:26:53.840]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[3:26:53.840 --> 3:26:58.320]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten
[3:26:58.320 --> 3:27:01.560]  a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:03.280]  Brother, that's the best thing I've heard.
[3:27:03.280 --> 3:27:05.080]  I want you to understand something.
[3:27:05.080 --> 3:27:07.640]  They don't want to just get me off here.
[3:27:07.640 --> 3:27:11.720]  Once they've silenced me, they plan to set me up and prison me or kill me.
[3:27:11.720 --> 3:27:16.320]  They want to fully capture Info Wars so they can then take control of it and use it as
[3:27:16.320 --> 3:27:18.520]  a vehicle against the liberty movement.
[3:27:18.520 --> 3:27:19.520]  That's the enemy's paradigm.
[3:27:19.520 --> 3:27:22.480]  That's why we've got to stay on air as long as possible.
[3:27:22.480 --> 3:27:26.480]  And if they do shut us down, you've got to fight for our name because they want to take
[3:27:26.480 --> 3:27:32.280]  over Info Wars, lie about us, and then use the fraud, the straw man against everybody.
[3:27:32.280 --> 3:27:36.000]  And I will not be turned into a weapon against the human community.
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:39.080]  I want a pro-human future, but that is the score.
[3:27:39.080 --> 3:27:40.760]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[3:27:40.760 --> 3:27:47.280]  Okay, Steve, Johnny, and Johnny, if you call me back on Sunday, I'll take your calls.
[3:27:47.280 --> 3:27:48.280]  Just go to the other line.
[3:27:48.280 --> 3:27:49.280]  I'm out of time.

[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:53.640]  He's got a lot to cover.

[3:29:52.040 --> 3:29:57.080]  Well, we're very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[3:29:57.080 --> 3:30:01.040]  We're going into the season of war, and they have been inches from shutting down the final
[3:30:01.040 --> 3:30:05.840]  mega-counts we have, do their criminal activity and their digital fraud, and we need to know
[3:30:05.840 --> 3:30:10.840]  that we've got capital to go six months a year, we need to end here, we need to be provisioned,
[3:30:10.840 --> 3:30:14.560]  and you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy
[3:30:14.560 --> 3:30:15.560]  fearlessly.
[3:30:15.560 --> 3:30:19.720]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin, I'm bloody
[3:30:19.720 --> 3:30:23.840]  and then I'm up politically, I'm banging heads with them, and they can't help but attack
[3:30:23.840 --> 3:30:26.040]  back with lies, and that just brings more people here.
[3:30:26.040 --> 3:30:30.780]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you, and I need war bonds, I need gas, I need ammo
[3:30:30.780 --> 3:30:32.280]  politically now.
[3:30:32.280 --> 3:30:36.120]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases,
[3:30:36.120 --> 3:30:39.520]  and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[3:30:39.520 --> 3:30:42.720]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy, I want to raise a couple million dollars right
[3:30:42.720 --> 3:30:46.720]  now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us,
[3:30:46.720 --> 3:30:49.120]  and I will never back down to have my commitment.
[3:30:49.120 --> 3:30:52.880]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right
[3:30:52.880 --> 3:30:55.040]  about this.
[3:30:55.040 --> 3:31:00.040]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast
[3:31:00.040 --> 3:31:04.200]  over the years and that has stood with us, and I want to thank all of our sponsors
[3:31:04.200 --> 3:31:08.440]  and all of our affiliates, but I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated
[3:31:08.440 --> 3:31:13.040]  attack we've been under, you're our only sponsors, and when you don't buy the products, they're
[3:31:13.040 --> 3:31:17.880]  absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[3:31:17.880 --> 3:31:22.560]  So remember, you are the Info War, I'm not the leader, you are the leader, when you take
[3:31:22.560 --> 3:31:24.200]  action nothing stops you.
[3:31:24.200 --> 3:31:29.600]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented,
[3:31:29.600 --> 3:31:34.440]  and if you go there and buy great products that you already need, from across the board,

[3:31:48.360 --> 3:31:54.880]  Thank you for making InfoWare possible, God bless you.
[3:31:54.880 --> 3:31:58.840]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square,
[3:31:58.840 --> 3:32:03.200]  the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[3:32:03.200 --> 3:32:07.120]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by
[3:32:07.120 --> 3:32:11.280]  some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government, it is completely
[3:32:11.280 --> 3:32:16.960]  independent of all that, it is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression
[3:32:16.960 --> 3:32:21.080]  of the freedom of press and freedom of speech, that in fact the founders were so concerned
[3:32:21.080 --> 3:32:25.520]  with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations
[3:32:25.520 --> 3:32:28.920]  just like this, because this was the kind of press they wanted, and that ultimately we
[3:32:28.920 --> 3:32:32.960]  now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire
[3:32:32.960 --> 3:32:37.440]  sugar daddies, who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views a person
[3:32:37.440 --> 3:32:42.440]  is allowed to have or express or hear, and the InfoWars audience has broken through that.
[3:32:42.440 --> 3:32:46.800]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[3:32:46.800 --> 3:32:51.520]  freedom, and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation,
[3:32:51.520 --> 3:32:57.440]  lawfare, and libel targeting youth.
[3:32:57.440 --> 3:33:14.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:14.440 --> 3:33:28.400]  Because there is a war on, for your mind, with Nick Begich, and welcome back to infowars.com,
[3:33:28.400 --> 3:33:35.200]  and I appreciate being here at this last half hour and the fourth hour of this Friday.
[3:33:35.200 --> 3:33:40.200]  You know, thinking about where I'm coming from today, I'm in Alaska, you know, this
[3:33:40.200 --> 3:33:45.400]  is the lightest spot, you know, right now.
[3:33:45.400 --> 3:33:47.000]  We have the white night, right?
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:53.520]  The sun doesn't go down, and for most of the day, and it's kind of like the rest, but
[3:33:53.520 --> 3:33:59.600]  we have 19 hours a day, like plus here in Anchorage today, and the longest day of the
[3:33:59.600 --> 3:34:04.960]  year, and the images for those who get to see them is me flying into a really remote
[3:34:04.960 --> 3:34:08.360]  area of Alaska where I have some property.
[3:34:08.360 --> 3:34:13.720]  You know, I'm thinking about the context of today's program, you know, the last couple
[3:34:13.720 --> 3:34:18.800]  hours, particularly thinking about where we are in the world, you know, at the brink
[3:34:18.800 --> 3:34:27.120]  of World War III, or the edge of Armageddon, or the last days, the doom and gloom, you
[3:34:27.120 --> 3:34:33.160]  know, the brink of the big one, you know, and that's where we're sitting.
[3:34:33.160 --> 3:34:38.280]  And, you know, I think about sort of what I've been doing the last 25 years is a lot
[3:34:38.280 --> 3:34:47.120]  of work in the mind control manipulation propaganda, if you will, on a 21st century
[3:34:47.120 --> 3:34:49.440]  platform of technology.
[3:34:49.440 --> 3:34:56.880]  And so when we start to think about the shaping of the public opinion, the moving of the herd
[3:34:56.880 --> 3:35:04.240]  as the elites look at us so often, you really start to get the picture because big media,
[3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:11.920]  big tech, the internet, all of it has allowed for the biggest level of profiling on an individual
[3:35:11.920 --> 3:35:17.360]  basis has ever been contemplated by any government program.
[3:35:17.360 --> 3:35:25.400]  I mean, beyond total awareness, beyond, you know, every aspect of invasiveness, you know,
[3:35:25.400 --> 3:35:31.880]  we know from recent disclosures, the whole background, as it's being reported at least
[3:35:31.880 --> 3:35:37.400]  in some outlets of Zuckerberg and you know what he was up to and how that all came about.
[3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:42.160]  But it all makes perfect sense, quite frankly, whether it was the chicken or the egg, it doesn't
[3:35:42.160 --> 3:35:43.160]  really matter.
[3:35:43.160 --> 3:35:48.280]  The fact that these systems are used against us individually by both corporate government
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:53.480]  entities, under the guise of national security or fair trade or free markets or whatever
[3:35:53.480 --> 3:35:58.560]  BS they want to feed you to tell you why your liberty has been removed.
[3:35:58.560 --> 3:36:05.040]  And reality creation as a concept is what I really want to talk about.
[3:36:05.040 --> 3:36:09.840]  What I want to talk about last week, and there was just too much going on this week as well,
[3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:16.320]  but reality creation is really the sub theme of the multimedia event we see playing out
[3:36:16.320 --> 3:36:24.160]  in the gulf between Iran and fiction or maybe not.
[3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:27.840]  But here's the point that I would raise.
[3:36:27.840 --> 3:36:31.080]  What is our interest in the Middle East, if any at all?
[3:36:31.080 --> 3:36:35.960]  I mean, if they choke off all the oil and gas coming out of there, do we care?
[3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:36.960]  How does it affect us?
[3:36:36.960 --> 3:36:42.800]  Will it make a big mess of the economy and shove oil prices up?
[3:36:42.800 --> 3:36:43.800]  Maybe.
[3:36:43.800 --> 3:36:44.800]  You know, I don't know.
[3:36:44.800 --> 3:36:45.800]  Maybe.
[3:36:45.800 --> 3:36:50.000]  The oil prices go up, that's for sure, and we're exporting oil now, so I guess American
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:55.000]  companies make more money, at least on the development side, small producers.
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:36:58.520]  And you know, here's the deal on all of it.
[3:36:58.520 --> 3:37:04.960]  It's a global manipulation of as many players as have power, and those are the people with
[3:37:04.960 --> 3:37:08.200]  high technologies which happens to be the United States.
[3:37:08.200 --> 3:37:12.960]  Now why are we being drawn into some mess in the Middle East again?
[3:37:12.960 --> 3:37:19.920]  Because some people's vision of the world is Armageddon, quite frankly, that idea of
[3:37:19.920 --> 3:37:21.640]  a World War III.
[3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:24.480]  You know, who benefits from this?
[3:37:24.480 --> 3:37:30.320]  And they're the same players that my dad used to complain about when he was in the Congress
[3:37:30.320 --> 3:37:36.840]  in the early 70s, it's the arms industry, the high tech arms industry, and when you
[3:37:36.840 --> 3:37:42.560]  look at the real money spent in federal budgets, you know, the buck stops there, and most of
[3:37:42.560 --> 3:37:50.040]  that is spent to pretend or to be, or to pretend to be, the global hammer for the police department
[3:37:50.040 --> 3:37:54.000]  of the United Nations, who none of us voted for, right?
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:58.480]  I mean, we don't vote for anybody in the United Nations, I don't care, you know, what they
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:03.760]  do as a dialogue, but they're not going to tell me what to do as a sovereign soul.
[3:38:03.760 --> 3:38:09.360]  And you know, the country itself has been hijacked to go promote globalist agendas through
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:11.960]  these kinds of institutions.
[3:38:11.960 --> 3:38:14.440]  And I resent it as an American.
[3:38:14.440 --> 3:38:20.080]  I resent it as just a human being, forget my citizenship, because I think it tramples
[3:38:20.080 --> 3:38:24.880]  over the sovereignty of other sovereign citizens around the world that don't live in the United
[3:38:24.880 --> 3:38:30.160]  States, that we ought to respect also, regardless of whether we like their forms of government.
[3:38:30.160 --> 3:38:36.120]  I mean, the Saudis, you know, it's a kingdom for God's sake, you know, that hides their
[3:38:36.120 --> 3:38:40.160]  women and beats them in public, you know, but they're our ally because we don't make
[3:38:40.160 --> 3:38:45.040]  value just what they do within the culture, moral culture, I guess we exempt that.
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:47.200]  But then we condemn others for whatever they do.
[3:38:47.200 --> 3:38:52.120]  You know, I don't get it, you know, sometimes it gets a bit confusing from my perspective
[3:38:52.120 --> 3:38:57.360]  as an American, but look around the world with governments that we prop up in the nature
[3:38:57.360 --> 3:38:58.360]  of the nonsense.
[3:38:58.360 --> 3:39:03.120]  Then you look at where we have our conflicts in the world today.
[3:39:03.120 --> 3:39:04.520]  And why are we there?
[3:39:04.520 --> 3:39:06.800]  You know, why did we go there in the first place?
[3:39:06.800 --> 3:39:08.800]  You know, what is our vital interest?
[3:39:08.800 --> 3:39:15.040]  You know, the whole reason we're in the Middle East today, actively in Syria and Iraq, it's
[3:39:15.040 --> 3:39:19.800]  because we destabilized Iraq under the guise of weapons of mass destruction that weren't
[3:39:19.800 --> 3:39:25.200]  there and then, you know, the terrorists, they weren't there, you know, so we, and now
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:30.040]  we have terrorists everywhere, you know, because we've made a lot of people angry and wiped
[3:39:30.040 --> 3:39:34.480]  out a tenth of their population in the course of these wars, you know, along with them wiping
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:35.480]  out a bunch of people.
[3:39:35.480 --> 3:39:39.480]  So here, you know, the killing has to stop, I think, is right.
[3:39:39.480 --> 3:39:46.760]  I'm glad no one has died in whatever's going on in Iran, and I would be highly skeptical
[3:39:46.760 --> 3:39:51.880]  of whatever's thrown our way because Iranians know also it's, you know, it's demolition
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:39:52.880]  time.
[3:39:52.880 --> 3:39:57.040]  But here's, if people go back to World War II and remember what happened there, you know,
[3:39:57.040 --> 3:40:01.240]  before the war, there was all these alliances nobody knew about, they weren't public.
[3:40:01.240 --> 3:40:06.520]  My Iran's alliances are with China and Russia and others, I'm sure, and sort of attack when
[3:40:06.520 --> 3:40:11.240]  you attack all the same as NATO states, you know, and how that all worked.
[3:40:11.240 --> 3:40:16.600]  So we need to be mindful of what we decide we want to engage and decide, indeed, is it
[3:40:16.600 --> 3:40:21.080]  our interest we're defending or someone else's, and perhaps that someone else might spend
[3:40:21.080 --> 3:40:25.040]  their own interests instead of us, or change.
[3:40:25.040 --> 3:40:28.080]  And that might be an interesting thought, you know, for all of us to contemplate as
[3:40:28.080 --> 3:40:32.880]  Americans, but getting back to the story of the day, which is, you know, our Begeddon
[3:40:32.880 --> 3:40:35.440]  reality creation, you know, we can see it happen.
[3:40:35.440 --> 3:40:38.000]  And let me tell you something about the physics of it.
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:44.800]  You know, human beings actually participate in the creation in a more fundamental way
[3:40:44.800 --> 3:40:49.360]  that quantum physics shows us, where we actually impact our reality, you know.
[3:40:49.360 --> 3:40:55.440]  So we think, and then we speak the words, and then reality begins to happen if the words
[3:40:55.440 --> 3:40:57.440]  have any power at all in them.
[3:40:57.440 --> 3:41:00.720]  And that power that gets injected in them is generally human emotion.
[3:41:00.720 --> 3:41:05.720]  It can be what people call good emotions or bad emotions, but it's emotional content
[3:41:05.720 --> 3:41:11.280]  that sort of shoves the information in a way that takes form.
[3:41:11.280 --> 3:41:19.280]  So when you have millions of listeners, like what Alex has, that empowers individuals to
[3:41:19.280 --> 3:41:26.080]  look at an issue together, millions at a time together, look at an issue, contemplate it
[3:41:26.080 --> 3:41:32.600]  and send our energy into that for change, you know, and push it along with whatever we
[3:41:32.600 --> 3:41:34.800]  can do.
[3:41:34.800 --> 3:41:37.440]  Whatever we can do as individuals do that.
[3:41:37.440 --> 3:41:41.760]  That might be talking to your neighbors about this network and this program, or it might
[3:41:41.760 --> 3:41:46.320]  be calling your congressman, which always is, you know, you think, does that really matter?
[3:41:46.320 --> 3:41:47.320]  It really does.
[3:41:47.320 --> 3:41:52.120]  Handwrite a letter, it really does matter, because these are the old tools that still
[3:41:52.120 --> 3:41:56.200]  get the message through in a way that people know is amplified.
[3:41:56.200 --> 3:42:04.360]  So do what you can in your own reality creation and push back against the globalist elite
[3:42:04.360 --> 3:42:08.720]  because the countermeasure to what's being created, and I want to talk about that in
[3:42:08.720 --> 3:42:16.520]  the terms of a matrix of information versus what already exists in the universe with us
[3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:22.000]  as human beings, created in the likeness and image of God, whatever that means, and I want
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:26.080]  to explore that a little bit after the break, and we'll talk about it.
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:31.560]  And what is coming, how do we reshape this reality to be one that changes the world in
[3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:36.480]  a new direction and not the one this train wreck is headed into?
[3:42:36.480 --> 3:42:42.400]  This is Dr. Nick Begitz standing in for Alex Jones on the ImpaWars, impawars.com.
[3:42:42.400 --> 3:42:53.920]  We'll be right back.
[3:42:53.920 --> 3:43:02.520]  So the InfaWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[3:43:02.520 --> 3:43:07.440]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[3:43:07.440 --> 3:43:13.080]  one another. It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[3:43:13.080 --> 3:43:17.880]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[3:43:17.880 --> 3:43:22.120]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[3:43:22.120 --> 3:43:26.480]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[3:43:26.480 --> 3:43:30.280]  and supporting InfaWars. And it's all because the audience spends there, whatever it is,
[3:43:30.280 --> 3:43:34.640]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually
[3:43:34.640 --> 3:43:39.040]  compete with the corporate-driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time
[3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:43.680]  support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to
[3:43:43.680 --> 3:43:47.960]  see and what views they want to hold. And it's the ultimate American democratic expression
[3:43:47.960 --> 3:43:53.280]  and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[3:43:53.280 --> 3:43:58.760]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from infawars.com, when you spread the videos,
[3:43:58.760 --> 3:44:04.760]  you are changing the world? It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist. It
[3:44:04.760 --> 3:44:09.520]  is you, the InfaWars, across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood against
[3:44:09.520 --> 3:44:13.480]  the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world. And
[3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:18.040]  that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[3:44:18.040 --> 3:44:22.520]  You are the InfaWard. And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important
[3:44:22.520 --> 3:44:27.720]  than ever that everyone go to infawars.com forward slash news letter and sign up via
[3:44:27.720 --> 3:44:33.080]  email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles,
[3:44:33.080 --> 3:44:37.720]  breaking news, intel, you name it. And so now I ask you more than ever to share the
[3:44:37.720 --> 3:44:42.080]  infawars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're
[3:44:42.080 --> 3:44:47.960]  listening to. The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infawars.com

[3:45:53.480 --> 3:45:59.080]  I just want listeners to understand. Money is what allows us to beat this and stand against
[3:45:59.080 --> 3:46:03.600]  this. And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save InfaWars 50% off. But we
[3:46:03.600 --> 3:46:08.680]  make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff. We're making like $2 on the toothpaste
[3:46:08.680 --> 3:46:12.840]  at that price. And we're moving a ton of it, okay? But you move a couple hundred thousand
[3:46:12.840 --> 3:46:16.720]  dollars or something and you get $20,000. That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure,
[3:46:16.720 --> 3:46:20.080]  the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew. So we need to sell millions and millions and millions
[3:46:20.080 --> 3:46:21.080]  of dollars of product.
[3:46:21.080 --> 3:46:25.240]  I want to expand, not contract. And for six months, we've not just made a standstill.
[3:46:25.240 --> 3:46:29.760]  The enemy's been winning. And I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[3:46:29.760 --> 3:46:32.800]  I like to be expanding. I like to be winning. I like to be fighting. And we are winning
[3:46:32.800 --> 3:46:36.640]  the Info War. That's why we're so hated. But we need to be retreaded. We need to be
[3:46:36.640 --> 3:46:39.880]  tuned up. We need to be fixed up. We never have time to get in the dry. We got a lot
[3:46:39.880 --> 3:46:45.040]  of holes shot at us. And the enemy wants to silence us. Then they're really going to plant
[3:46:45.040 --> 3:46:48.600]  child porn on us. Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else. I mean, the Democrats
[3:46:48.600 --> 3:46:52.640]  now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks and the chai comm show.
[3:46:52.640 --> 3:46:56.840]  Go to infowarsstore.com.
[3:46:56.840 --> 3:47:09.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:09.960 --> 3:47:29.040]  Welcome back. And, you know, I love it. During the break, Connor, who's helping today in
[3:47:29.040 --> 3:47:34.640]  the production of the show, and I were talking about quantum. It's kind of where I left off.
[3:47:34.640 --> 3:47:40.440]  It's sort of this, what are we really questioned? And I get on this theme a lot. And it's important
[3:47:40.440 --> 3:47:45.600]  to me to stay on this theme a lot because I think it's fundamental to everything we're
[3:47:45.600 --> 3:47:54.400]  doing here. I do believe, along with the big three, right? Christians, Jewish, Muslims,
[3:47:54.400 --> 3:48:00.480]  I believe even Hindus and Buddhists and a bunch of other people believe this too, that
[3:48:00.480 --> 3:48:05.640]  we're created in the image and likeness of the Creator God. And, you know, you think
[3:48:05.640 --> 3:48:11.080]  about that sort of how this creation thing goes, according to Genesis, you know, people
[3:48:11.080 --> 3:48:14.600]  who want to look that up and a lot of the listeners here, I know are Christians. So
[3:48:14.600 --> 3:48:19.960]  I'm going to use that as a reference point if that's okay. And if it's not okay, I apologize.
[3:48:19.960 --> 3:48:24.640]  I don't mean to pick one over another or offend anybody. That's not my objective here. It's
[3:48:24.640 --> 3:48:30.320]  to illustrate a point that science says the same thing. And why is it important? Because
[3:48:30.320 --> 3:48:36.440]  here's the deal. It says, first, there's obviously a thought, you know, God has a thought, and
[3:48:36.440 --> 3:48:43.240]  then a word, a spoken, a vibration is spoken, and then something is created. And this is
[3:48:43.240 --> 3:48:49.160]  essentially what physics is telling us, that we are sort of a bunch of wave fronts coming
[3:48:49.160 --> 3:48:55.480]  together that we perceive as physical matter. And we perceive it through our sensory organism
[3:48:55.480 --> 3:49:01.480]  body, right? And let me tell you how we do that. Okay, for sight, for instance, it's
[3:49:01.480 --> 3:49:07.680]  a bandwidth, you look at the electromagnetic spectrum, which is this long line, if you
[3:49:07.680 --> 3:49:15.040]  can picture this line with all the different things x-rays, visible radiations, ultraviolet
[3:49:15.040 --> 3:49:19.280]  electricity, you know, all of this stuff along the spectrum. And the visual system,
[3:49:19.280 --> 3:49:25.400]  our eyes can see a bandwidth that allows us just to see what we see, see what we see.
[3:49:25.400 --> 3:49:30.800]  But what we're really seeing is a certain amount of reflected light that we can, you
[3:49:30.800 --> 3:49:36.400]  know, construct with our brain into some kind of form. And that's what we do. With hearing,
[3:49:36.400 --> 3:49:41.440]  it's the same kind of thing, a sound wave vibrates its inner ear and converts into a
[3:49:41.440 --> 3:49:46.160]  signal that we perceive as words or sounds that we translate and interpret according
[3:49:46.160 --> 3:49:50.880]  to what language we speak in the language. And a lot of other things transfer that we
[3:49:50.880 --> 3:49:59.440]  don't see between us as human beings that connect us uniquely, better than the internet.
[3:49:59.440 --> 3:50:05.120]  And this is what I was alluding to in the last segment was this connection is what the
[3:50:05.120 --> 3:50:12.320]  false sense of what we are is created, because that's sort of the artificial, the internet,
[3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:18.240]  if you think about it as connecting human beings, but with an intermediate, the operator
[3:50:18.240 --> 3:50:25.600]  of the system, as well as the government, the co-venturer, if you will, of the system,
[3:50:25.600 --> 3:50:30.200]  all right, because they invented the internet. Okay, so think about that as a way of tying
[3:50:30.200 --> 3:50:35.000]  consciousness together. And PBS did a special called the World Wide Mind, where they say
[3:50:35.000 --> 3:50:39.720]  in the century, you know, this will all be electronically connected. Now, I don't like
[3:50:39.720 --> 3:50:45.880]  any of that as a way of looking at humanity, if you will, because humanity has already
[3:50:45.880 --> 3:50:51.200]  connected this way. Fundamentally, we're already hooked up one another, if you will, and along
[3:50:51.200 --> 3:50:56.440]  with everything else in the universe, according to the most advanced theories and physics
[3:50:56.440 --> 3:51:01.600]  and quantum physics. And then there's all these really weird aspects of what we are
[3:51:01.600 --> 3:51:07.240]  as human beings that can be explained in lots of different ways and things that are happening
[3:51:07.240 --> 3:51:14.600]  within the creation itself that we get to participate in. And the force of that has everything
[3:51:14.600 --> 3:51:19.800]  to do with us having free and independent thought as starting point, because when the
[3:51:19.800 --> 3:51:27.320]  thoughts of a lot of humans line up, powerful effects take place. And this is why the reality
[3:51:27.320 --> 3:51:33.040]  creation model of the globalists and our New World Order or whatever you want to call it,
[3:51:33.040 --> 3:51:39.000]  the devil, I mean, I don't care what you call it, the symbolism, the hidden meaning, whatever
[3:51:39.000 --> 3:51:45.680]  is the same outcome, and that outcome is a corrupted humanity, a humanity that's lost
[3:51:45.680 --> 3:51:52.760]  itself in the illusion of connectedness through the internet, through mechanisms that really
[3:51:52.760 --> 3:51:59.560]  regulate control and manipulate speed. They do not free you to anything or provide you
[3:51:59.560 --> 3:52:05.320]  the freedom that you already are. And this is also what they tamp down in the human spirit
[3:52:05.320 --> 3:52:13.680]  by increasing anxiety, fear, tension, those very things that stop a human mind from reaching
[3:52:13.680 --> 3:52:22.760]  higher ordered thinking. And that leap beyond the higher ordered thinking into the realm
[3:52:22.760 --> 3:52:28.800]  of anomalous human potential that the military often referred to and used to be referred
[3:52:28.800 --> 3:52:37.240]  to in a lot of these programs under the name extra sensory perception. And these studies,
[3:52:37.240 --> 3:52:43.640]  which I've reported on for years and an info war store, as of my books and videos on mind
[3:52:43.640 --> 3:52:49.800]  control mind effects, you can go there and you support this network when you do. But
[3:52:49.800 --> 3:52:57.120]  the thing about all this is, it's playing out now in a way that many of us predicted
[3:52:57.120 --> 3:53:02.400]  and we anticipated and we put noted carefully. But you know, when you're in the reality versus
[3:53:02.400 --> 3:53:06.760]  writing about the future, you know, in terms of prediction models based on what you see
[3:53:06.760 --> 3:53:11.440]  in the technology trends, it's way different when you're in it. And now we're in it. And
[3:53:11.440 --> 3:53:16.720]  it's way worse. But we have the potential of moving in the other direction. Let me give
[3:53:16.720 --> 3:53:22.200]  you a couple of ideas. One of them is there was some work done in these programs that
[3:53:22.200 --> 3:53:26.560]  show that if you could link people up where it like we are right now, everyone listening
[3:53:26.560 --> 3:53:32.360]  right at this very moment are linked together. And you could hold a thought. It was the equivalent
[3:53:32.360 --> 3:53:36.800]  of some super duper, you know, try and hold a thought for more than a few seconds, your
[3:53:36.800 --> 3:53:40.920]  mind drifts, right? It goes from that thought to the next one to the next one. And it's
[3:53:40.920 --> 3:53:45.280]  just the way the human mind kind of wanders around, you know, it's like you can't get
[3:53:45.280 --> 3:53:50.240]  it to sit stills like a two year old running around your house. And so your mind doesn't
[3:53:50.240 --> 3:53:54.360]  why it's mine long enough to hold a thought is pretty challenging. And so but what we
[3:53:54.360 --> 3:54:00.440]  know is the cumulative effect of holding that same thought lays out neural pathways within
[3:54:00.440 --> 3:54:05.880]  the brain that then allow for the projection perhaps of that thought to take deeper and
[3:54:05.880 --> 3:54:10.560]  more meaningful form. But when you have a million people having a thought for a million
[3:54:10.560 --> 3:54:15.880]  seconds even, well, that's a million cumulative seconds. That's worth a lot of discipline
[3:54:15.880 --> 3:54:19.640]  on the part of one person, you know, holding a thought for three or four seconds if you're
[3:54:19.640 --> 3:54:26.040]  asking. So I mean, the compound effect. So what I'm saying is if you can get the media
[3:54:26.040 --> 3:54:31.680]  to get enough people to see the reality the way they do, you can manifest that reality
[3:54:31.680 --> 3:54:37.840]  in a pretty direct and in an indirect way. And that's kind of part of that reality shaping
[3:54:37.840 --> 3:54:42.320]  thing that we get to do as humans. And most people don't do much of it because they're
[3:54:42.320 --> 3:54:49.200]  so unconscious, they just kind of get pushed along by whatever is pushing the button. But
[3:54:49.200 --> 3:54:53.760]  as soon as emotion gets charged into it, then things start to happen. And so we need to
[3:54:53.760 --> 3:54:59.120]  be really responsible. And you know, you think about emotion and how that plays into the
[3:54:59.120 --> 3:55:07.080]  dialogue in this century and how much tribalism is emerging in the debate to separate us from
[3:55:07.080 --> 3:55:13.840]  our humanity so that we speak against each other with a tone that doesn't represent anyone
[3:55:13.840 --> 3:55:25.440]  or any human that believes in the idea of created in the image of divinity. For goodness sake,
[3:55:25.440 --> 3:55:30.000]  that's what we've forgotten foundationally. And so, you know, we can pour a lot of energy
[3:55:30.000 --> 3:55:36.960]  into what we do and we should do it collectively independently as individuals. We don't need
[3:55:36.960 --> 3:55:42.440]  to wait for some squishy group to form or some club to form. There's organizations that
[3:55:42.440 --> 3:55:46.280]  are great for getting information out and for wars is one of them. That's why you should
[3:55:46.280 --> 3:55:51.040]  support it. That's why people should look at the products and get those that support
[3:55:51.040 --> 3:55:59.120]  this network and recognize that the war is our own individually. We all have a part to
[3:55:59.120 --> 3:56:05.120]  play in it. What we decide to do with it is up to us individually. You know, going into
[3:56:05.120 --> 3:56:13.960]  this weekend on in Alaska, the longest day of the year, the lights are on and let's keep
[3:56:13.960 --> 3:56:19.840]  them lit for liberty and for a new democracy that really represents the republic as it
[3:56:19.840 --> 3:56:25.720]  was originally intended. And let's take a look at what we're doing in the world and
[3:56:25.720 --> 3:56:34.400]  it's pull back, pull back, stand down. Let's take a look a little closer before we ever
[3:56:34.400 --> 3:56:40.040]  send our sons and daughters to war. That's not what America is about. We're about so
[3:56:40.040 --> 3:56:45.720]  much more than that and take a look, you know, internally as to what we can do and start
[3:56:45.720 --> 3:56:50.520]  to do that. And I'm not saying each of us need some big grand plan. There's plenty of
[3:56:50.520 --> 3:56:57.240]  plenty of those out there, but do the grand plan that you personally believe you can accomplish.
[3:56:57.240 --> 3:57:02.960]  And that's the one that's the right one for you as an info warrior in this together. You
[3:57:02.960 --> 3:57:08.320]  know, whatever step that is, talk to your neighbors, write a letter to your congressman.
[3:57:08.320 --> 3:57:14.280]  Absolutely support this network and go into the weekend refresh knowing that you make
[3:57:14.280 --> 3:57:19.160]  a difference as we all make a difference. You know, looking at what's going on in Iran
[3:57:19.160 --> 3:57:26.880]  and the Gulf restraint, let's make sure it's not another false flag. And even if it is
[3:57:26.880 --> 3:57:31.760]  over aggression, let's always ask questions. Is it worth our sons and daughters before
[3:57:31.760 --> 3:57:38.440]  we launch the first counter offense? Hey, this is Dr. Nick Begich in the info wars and
[3:57:38.440 --> 3:57:46.440]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show. The globalist are hyper competitive scientific
[3:57:46.440 --> 3:57:50.640]  dictators. They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words and they
[3:57:50.640 --> 3:57:54.320]  believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way
[3:57:54.320 --> 3:57:59.800]  of their great destiny to merge with AI gods. We're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're
[3:57:59.800 --> 3:58:03.600]  fighting them hard right here in the third dimension. But one of the biggest places that
[3:58:03.600 --> 3:58:08.760]  we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control on our lives is our bodies.
[3:58:08.760 --> 3:58:14.040]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from fourslife.com, I couldn't do it. That's
[3:58:14.040 --> 3:58:18.600]  why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical
[3:58:18.600 --> 3:58:25.760]  bottom and double the strength of it in a new formula, ultra 12. Ultra 12 is undoubtedly
[3:58:25.760 --> 3:58:29.920]  the strongest highest quality B 12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[3:58:29.920 --> 3:58:34.760]  It is amazing experience pure medical bottom and B 12 for yourself and fund the second
[3:58:34.760 --> 3:58:41.000]  American evolution against the tyrants at info wars store.com in fourslife.com or triple
[3:58:41.000 --> 3:58:46.480]  a two five three three one three nine info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in
[3:58:46.480 --> 3:58:52.240]  modern medicine introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural
[3:58:52.240 --> 3:58:57.520]  way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus
[3:58:57.520 --> 3:59:04.800]  passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed
[3:59:04.800 --> 3:59:10.880]  that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[3:59:10.880 --> 3:59:15.800]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[3:59:15.800 --> 3:59:22.040]  of this research a fast acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[3:59:22.040 --> 3:59:27.360]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research
[3:59:27.360 --> 3:59:32.160]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme
[3:59:32.160 --> 3:59:37.800]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air
[3:59:37.800 --> 3:59:47.840]  you breathe. Head to info wars life.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[3:59:47.840 --> 3:59:51.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
